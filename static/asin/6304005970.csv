Greene's characters (not all of them) are renown for their religiousness and he feels this is the best way to view characters and give them justice and the best writers are those with a religious sense of life. This shows in this film with its opening at a church a cremation...and aunt augusta is soon on a journey throughout europe the arab world and africa. These are all areas the author knows and there are memorable characters the african butler wordsworth,an american on a train as a companion to the banker accompanying aunt augustus,and mr Visconti. A film about relationships from anolder woman's perspective and although she finds her bawdy,she comments on his lacking sufering,dreams and love...memories...what are men without these. Rather than the human laws (and there are police episodes heree as well)the aunt's laws are those of the ten commandments which transfigures her life,she call 'perception.',as well as the american on the train despite her drug taking in the kenneddy craze she notes his religion and almost takes it up.

It's the story of a stuffy British man whose mother has just died and his &#34;aunt&#34; who suddenly shows up out of the blue and leads him into a world of crime, travel, drugs, sex and &#34;adventure&#34;. Maggie's basically giving a drag performance here- it's pretty ridiculous. Then there are the flashback sequences using the Liz Taylor &#34;White Diamonds&#34; lens. Amazingly this project was first developed for Katharine Hepburn! Maggie looks older as Aunt Augusta than she does today on Downton Abbey! Well almost. What is with this period and decaying, decrepit, decadent diva characters? The great diva characters of the 60's warped into these weird old floozies. From Hepburn's &#34;Madwoman of Chaillot&#34; to Angela Lansbury's take on the same character in &#34;Dear World&#34; and then later in &#34;Sweeney Todd&#34;- the divas went degenerate in the 70's.

395283,A1HO9J4DCQDGP9,6304005970,"Kali ""bengaligirl""","[80, 81]","Maggie Smith is deliciously wonderful as the unconventional Augusta, a woman with a shady and colorful past.  Arriving at the funeral of her sister after man years absence, she plucks her staid stick-in-the-mud  nephew from his humdrum existence in suburban England and drags him with  her on a journey of self-discovery, introducing him to her many Bohemian  friends as well as her West Indian lover Wordsworth played brilliantly by  Louis Gossett Junior.  Augusta's nephew is played with excellent British  stuffiness by Alec McCowan who finds out to his horror that there is more  to his own past than that of his Aunt. Compelled by a sense of duty mingled  with confusion he sets out to help the madcap Augusta in her bid to raise  the funds to free one of her old flames Mr. Visconti who is being held to  ransom by a band of desperate men.  This film is delectably funny, quirkily  humorous in a sardonic come sartorial way whilst at the same time  maintaining equilibrium in the form of its characters who are larger than  life but totally human and believable.  Maggie Smith however steals the  show with her portrayal of Augusta a woman with a past as colorful as a  patchwork quilt.  There are little twists and turns that add to the piquant  essence of the whole film, such as Henry's true parentage both maternal and  paternal, and Augusta's own self-interpretation of her life and actions  over the years.

And my reaction is.... eh. Oh, it was mildly amusing on occasion, but I can't say it did much for me. And in the end, I found I didn't particularly care for any of the characters.Interesting to note that Katharine Hepburn was not only considered for this role, she was signed and production had already started (or pre-production, at least) before she was fired. I can't find out just what the problem was; I've read conflicting reports as to why she was dropped from the project---or why she dropped the project (the phrasing depends on which explanation you've read). Well, at least it didn't cause any lasting rift with her longtime friend, director George Cukor, because he directed her in two additional films in later years...I think Maggie Smith has fun with the role (she was nominated for an Oscar for this), and I absolutely cannot imagine Hepburn in the part; I don't think it would have suited her, as written. And I don't think Hepburn could possibly have played the title character in all the flashbacks; she was simply too old by that point. (Maggie, in contrast, was able to play the younger scenes easily enough since they were close to her own age; she was made up to appear much older in the present-day sequences.)I've read a number of reviews that said the book was far better than the film, and I suppose that could easily be the case since I've never read the book.

395290,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,6304005970,Stephanie De Pue,"[8, 9]","""Travels with My Aunt,"" (1972), a comedy/adventure/dramatic film, was based upon a novel of the same name, penned by its greatly praised British author Graham Greene rather late in his long life, and his long, prolific, greatly-honored literary career. The script was written by J. Presson Allen; the short -109 minutes - full-color film was directed by George Cukor. (Bhowani Junction,A Star Is Born (Deluxe Edition)) Mind you, this particular underlying novel never has been a critical favorite. Nor has the movie, starring Dame Maggie Smith,fresh off her Oscar-winning turn inThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, who was also Oscar-nominated for the title role of Aunt Augusta Bertram.Stuffy retired bank manager Henry Pulling, played by Alec McCowen, (Shakespeare: The Animated Tales) meets, at his mother's funeral,  his Aunt Augusta, an elderly eccentric with more-than-shady dealings, who has had no part in his life since his christening.  Pulling has never married, is presumably still a virgin, and looks forward to nothing more now than a lifetime of cultivating his suburban dahlias.  Until Aunt Augusta pulls him right out of his rut, and drags him along on a whirlwind adventure, as she attempts to rescue an old lover.The plot's episodic, and not as tight as some of the writer's great spy stories. But you can see the Greene touch in some of the book's flavorful characters. In addition to Aunt Augusta, there's the Turkish cop, Colonel Hakim, one of several powerful third world law 'enforcers' created by Greene, played by Daniel Emilfork. There's 'Tooley,' the airhead hippie girl met on the Orient Express (played by Cindy Williams, then at the height of her popularity inLaverne & Shirley - The Complete First Season.  And Zachary, whom Aunt Augusta calls 'Wordsworth,' an emigrant from Sierra Leone, a part of the world with which Greene was very familiar, as he'd spent World War II there as a spy. Wordsworth, as played by Lou Gossett Jr., (Lou Gossett Jr. Three Movies Collection) is fiercely in love with Augusta, a woman at least twice his age, and devotes his life to her.All the leading actors do very well here, scenery is good, and pace is quick enough.  Cukor was, of course, known as a woman's director, and it would seem to most viewers, I think, that Dame Maggie was born to play Aunt Augusta, among other parts.  Still, I understand consideration is being given to remaking this movie, and I imagine there are other women in that stable of powerful English theatrical Dames who can play her: hello Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Judi Dench.  We shall see.Greene (1904-1991), who was one of the more illustrious British writers of the 20th century, enjoyed a very long life, and a very long, distinguished, prolific writing career. Some of his writing highlights areThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics),The End Of The Affair, andThe Third Man. Many of his books were bestsellers; most - 56% is the percentage I've seen-- were made into movies, some more than once. He was one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created morally complex characters, while he explored moral and theological dilemmas through psychologically astute character studies, presented in exciting dramas on the international stage.  This one is very hard to find, but worth seeing, not least for the acting, if you can.",4,Dame Maggie Smith Was Born to Play Aunt Augusta,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,3424,"['Travels', 'My', 'Aunt', '1972', 'comedy/adventure/dramatic', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'penned', 'greatly', 'praised', 'British', 'author', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'rather', 'late', 'long', 'life', 'long', 'prolific', 'greatly-honored', 'literary', 'career', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'J.', 'Presson', 'Allen', 'short', '-109', 'minutes', 'full-color', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Bhowani', 'Junction', 'A', 'Star', 'Is', 'Born', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Mind', 'particular', 'underlying', 'novel', 'never', 'been', 'critical', 'favorite', 'movie', 'starring', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'fresh', 'off', 'Oscar-winning', 'turn', 'inThe', 'Prime', 'Miss', 'Jean', 'Brodie', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Oscar-nominated', 'title', 'role', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', 'Bertram.Stuffy', 'retired', 'bank', 'manager', 'Henry', 'Pulling', 'played', 'Alec', 'McCowen', 'Shakespeare', 'Animated', 'Tales', 'meets', 'mother', 'funeral', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', 'elderly', 'eccentric', 'more-than-shady', 'dealings', 'who', 'had', 'part', 'life', 'christening', 'Pulling', 'never', 'married', 'presumably', 'still', 'virgin', 'forward', 'nothing', 'more', 'now', 'lifetime', 'cultivating', 'suburban', 'dahlias', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', 'right', 'rut', 'along', 'whirlwind', 'adventure', 'rescue', 'old', 'lover.The', 'plot', 'episodic', 'not', 'as', 'tight', 'writer', 'great', 'spy', 'stories', 'can', 'see', 'Greene', 'touch', 'book', 'flavorful', 'characters', 'addition', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', 'Turkish', 'cop', 'Colonel', 'Hakim', 'one', 'several', 'powerful', 'third', 'world', 'law', ""'enforcers"", 'created', 'Greene', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Emilfork', ""'Tooley"", 'airhead', 'hippie', 'girl', 'met', 'Orient', 'Express', 'played', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'then', 'height', 'popularity', 'inLaverne', 'Shirley', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'Zachary', 'whom', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', ""'Wordsworth"", 'emigrant', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'part', 'world', 'Greene', 'was', 'very', 'familiar', ""'d"", 'spent', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'there', 'spy', 'Wordsworth', 'played', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Three', 'Movies', 'Collection', 'fiercely', 'love', 'Augusta', 'woman', 'least', 'twice', 'age', 'life', 'her.All', 'leading', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'scenery', 'good', 'pace', 'quick', 'enough', 'Cukor', 'was', 'course', 'known', 'woman', 'director', 'would', 'seem', 'most', 'viewers', 'think', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Aunt', 'Augusta', 'other', 'parts', 'Still', 'understand', 'consideration', 'being', 'given', 'remaking', 'movie', 'imagine', 'are', 'other', 'women', 'stable', 'powerful', 'English', 'theatrical', 'Dames', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'hello', 'Dame', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'shall', 'see.Greene', '1904-1991', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'illustrious', 'British', 'writers', '20th', 'century', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'long', 'life', 'very', 'long', 'distinguished', 'prolific', 'writing', 'career', 'writing', 'highlights', 'areThe', 'Power', 'Glory', 'Penguin', 'Classics', 'End', 'Affair', 'andThe', 'Third', 'Man', 'Many', 'books', 'were', 'bestsellers', 'most', '56', '%', 'percentage', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'were', 'made', 'movies', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'one', 'better-known', 'Catholic', 'converts', 'time', 'many', 'thrillers', 'one', 'deal', 'Catholic', 'themes', 'guilt', 'redemption', 'created', 'morally', 'complex', 'characters', 'explored', 'moral', 'theological', 'dilemmas', 'psychologically', 'astute', 'character', 'studies', 'presented', 'exciting', 'dramas', 'international', 'stage', 'one', 'very', 'hard', 'find', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'least', 'acting', 'can']",Travels With My Aunt VHS
