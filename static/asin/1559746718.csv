182651,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,1559746718,Annie Van Auken,"[3, 3]","Although THE MARX BROS. IN A NUTSHELL is now available on DVD, my review partially pertains to the original 1991 VESTRON VHS release. The tape is SP mode with HiFi sound and is a good transfer.This 95 minute Gene Kelly-narrated documentary is an accurate but selective overview of the comedy team's career. Excerpts are provided of all the Marxes most popular comedies. Missing are clips fromAT THE CIRCUS(1939),GO WEST(1940),A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA(1946) andLOVE HAPPY(1949).Most vintage footage is fragmentary or edited. One complete piece is a 1931 PARAMOUNT publicity short that recreates a scene from the boys' 1924 Broadway revue, ""I'll Say She Is."" A theatrical agent skit in doggerel rhyme, it has a running gag of imitations of Maurice Chevalier's ""You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me.""Groucho gets the most post-brothers career coverage; this documentary in fact opens with a shot of Carnegie Hall's marquee advertising his 1972 one man show. Several examples of ""You Bet Your Life"" are included, as well as an hilarious guest appearance on ""What's My Line?""Harpo is seen doing his famous ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" clarinet bit, but the scene is cut before he fills the air with bubbles. Chico's solo moment is leading Aussie troops from his piano in singing ""Waltzing Matilda."" Also included is the trio's final filmed appearance, a cameo from a 1959 TV show.Besides a wealth of historic home movie, newsreel, studio publicity and motion picture excerpts, the program is fleshed out nicely with comments from:Irving Brecher - writerDick Cavett - Groucho's friendGeorge Fenneman - announcer, ""You Bet Your Life""George Folsey - cinematographerCharlotte Granet - friend of Groucho and Eden MarxMargaret Irving - co-star,ANIMAL CRACKERS(1930)Robert Klein - comedianNorman Krasna - writerArthur Marx - Groucho's sonBill Marx - Harpo's sonBob Marx - Gummo's sonMaxine Marx - Chico's daughterNat Perrin - writerRobert Pirosh - writerMorrie Ryskind - writerDavid Steinberg - comedian",5,"""Tie on-a da bed, t'row da rope outta da windah!""",1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,1989,"['THE', 'MARX', 'BROS', 'IN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'review', 'partially', 'original', '1991', 'VESTRON', 'VHS', 'release', 'tape', 'SP', 'mode', 'HiFi', 'sound', 'good', 'transfer.This', '95', 'minute', 'Gene', 'Kelly-narrated', 'documentary', 'accurate', 'selective', 'overview', 'comedy', 'team', 'career', 'Excerpts', 'are', 'provided', 'Marxes', 'most', 'popular', 'comedies', 'Missing', 'are', 'clips', 'fromAT', 'CIRCUS', '1939', 'GO', 'WEST', '1940', 'NIGHT', 'IN', 'CASABLANCA', '1946', 'andLOVE', 'HAPPY', '1949', '.Most', 'vintage', 'footage', 'fragmentary', 'edited', 'One', 'complete', 'piece', '1931', 'PARAMOUNT', 'publicity', 'short', 'scene', 'boys', '1924', 'Broadway', 'revue', ""'ll"", 'Say', 'theatrical', 'agent', 'skit', 'doggerel', 'rhyme', 'running', 'gag', 'imitations', 'Maurice', 'Chevalier', 'Brought', 'New', 'Kind', 'Love', 'Me', 'Groucho', 'most', 'post-brothers', 'career', 'coverage', 'documentary', 'fact', 'shot', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'marquee', 'advertising', '1972', 'one', 'man', 'show', 'Several', 'examples', 'Bet', 'Life', 'are', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'hilarious', 'guest', 'appearance', 'What', 'My', 'Line', 'Harpo', 'seen', 'doing', 'famous', ""'m"", 'Forever', 'Blowing', 'Bubbles', 'clarinet', 'bit', 'scene', 'cut', 'air', 'bubbles', 'Chico', 'solo', 'moment', 'leading', 'Aussie', 'troops', 'piano', 'singing', 'Waltzing', 'Matilda', 'Also', 'included', 'trio', 'final', 'filmed', 'appearance', 'cameo', '1959', 'TV', 'wealth', 'historic', 'home', 'movie', 'newsreel', 'studio', 'publicity', 'motion', 'picture', 'excerpts', 'program', 'fleshed', 'out', 'nicely', 'comments', 'Irving', 'Brecher', 'writerDick', 'Cavett', 'Groucho', 'friendGeorge', 'Fenneman', 'announcer', 'Bet', 'Life', 'George', 'Folsey', 'cinematographerCharlotte', 'Granet', 'friend', 'Groucho', 'Eden', 'MarxMargaret', 'Irving', 'co-star', 'ANIMAL', 'CRACKERS', '1930', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'comedianNorman', 'Krasna', 'writerArthur', 'Marx', 'Groucho', 'sonBill', 'Marx', 'Harpo', 'sonBob', 'Marx', 'Gummo', 'sonMaxine', 'Marx', 'Chico', 'daughterNat', 'Perrin', 'writerRobert', 'Pirosh', 'writerMorrie', 'Ryskind', 'writerDavid', 'Steinberg', 'comedian']",N/A

There were some very interesting footage that I had never seen, especially the ""I'll Say She is"" footage that I enjoyed very much. (It seems some of the jokes used in ""I'll Say she is"" were recycled for ""Monkey Business"") But overall the content was superficial at best and the clips were repetative.

182656,A2R6RA8FRBS608,1559746718,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","The Marx Brothers In A Nutshell is a solid documentary about the greatest comedy team in history although it is not without one or two flaws. The film shows us the best of The Marx Brothers on the silver screen; and we get great interviews with family members but not with the brothers themselves. The quality of the footage is excellent and the sound is very good as well.The documentary covers quite a bit of ground in just 98 minutes. We get still photos of the young brothers when they were doing the vaudeville circuit and Broadway plays. The bulk of the motion picture archival footage comes from their films which they made at Paramount Studios and MGM Studios. We get good insight from directors who worked with them and the children of the Marx Brothers about what made each brother tick and how they created characters that were, in essence, extensions of what they were actually like when the cameras weren't rolling. I found the personality insights to be fascinating. We see Groucho who wasn't always quite so pleasant; Chico who was warm, friendly and very much able to pick up any girl he wanted; and Harpo who was relatively quiet and a great father even though he had children late in life.In addition, look for some great commentary by Woody Allen, Dick Cavett and others who actually worked with the comedy team all those years ago. There is also some very good coverage of the influence of their relatives upon the brothers when they were just breaking into show business.The documentary also tells us much about their excellent rapport with Irving Thalberg at MGM Studios; and we see the ups and downs of their careers. There is some footage of the brothers after the comedy team split up and they each went their separate ways; but it wasn't quite enough footage to satisfy me personally.The DVD has no extras; the 98 minute documentary is what you get. Therefore, if you like this you might want another Marx Brothers retrospective documentary to flesh out your understanding of these greatly talented men.Overall, I highly recommend The Marx Brothers In A Nutshell; my only complaint is that we get little, if any, interview footage directly with the brothers. If you like this DVD then you should strongly consider other Marx Brothers documentaries.",4,it's just like a movie !!!,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,2274,"['Marx', 'Brothers', 'A', 'Nutshell', 'solid', 'documentary', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'team', 'history', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'flaws', 'film', 'best', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'silver', 'screen', 'get', 'great', 'interviews', 'family', 'members', 'not', 'brothers', 'quality', 'footage', 'excellent', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'well.The', 'documentary', 'covers', 'quite', 'bit', 'ground', 'just', '98', 'minutes', 'get', 'still', 'photos', 'young', 'brothers', 'when', 'were', 'doing', 'vaudeville', 'circuit', 'Broadway', 'plays', 'bulk', 'motion', 'picture', 'archival', 'footage', 'films', 'made', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'get', 'good', 'insight', 'directors', 'who', 'worked', 'children', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'what', 'made', 'brother', 'tick', 'how', 'created', 'characters', 'were', 'essence', 'extensions', 'what', 'were', 'actually', 'when', 'cameras', 'were', ""n't"", 'rolling', 'found', 'personality', 'insights', 'be', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Groucho', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'quite', 'so', 'pleasant', 'Chico', 'who', 'was', 'warm', 'friendly', 'very', 'much', 'able', 'pick', 'up', 'girl', 'wanted', 'Harpo', 'who', 'was', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'great', 'father', 'even', 'had', 'children', 'late', 'life.In', 'addition', 'look', 'great', 'commentary', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'others', 'who', 'actually', 'worked', 'comedy', 'team', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'coverage', 'influence', 'relatives', 'brothers', 'when', 'were', 'just', 'breaking', 'show', 'business.The', 'documentary', 'also', 'much', 'excellent', 'rapport', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'MGM', 'Studios', 'see', 'ups', 'downs', 'careers', 'footage', 'brothers', 'comedy', 'team', 'split', 'up', 'went', 'separate', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'enough', 'footage', 'satisfy', 'personally.The', 'DVD', 'extras', '98', 'minute', 'documentary', 'what', 'get', 'Therefore', 'like', 'might', 'want', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'retrospective', 'documentary', 'flesh', 'out', 'understanding', 'greatly', 'talented', 'men.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'A', 'Nutshell', 'only', 'complaint', 'get', 'little', 'interview', 'footage', 'directly', 'brothers', 'like', 'DVD', 'then', 'should', 'strongly', 'consider', 'other', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'documentaries']",N/A

Casey ""Tim Casey""","[1, 1]",".. except that the DVD is a bit ""squished"" - the interviewees are all a bit ""wider"" than they should be and also a bit garish in color. The laserdisc of this documentary (it was produced around 1983) didn't exhibit these problems, so whoever did the transfer of the video master to DVD screwed up a bit.Another drawback to the DVD is that the movie clips are all from the ""premastered"" laserdisc masters. The currently available DVDs of these individual films have superior transfers.The only drawback to the documentary itself is the lack of clips from the MGM films. They apparently had permission from MCA (the then-owners of the Paramount films, 1929 - 1933) but not from MGM (the owners and creators of the MGM films, 1935 onward). There is only one clip from any of these later films - a bit from ""A Night At The Opera"" that actually comes from the original trailer, which is public domain.(EDIT: Now that I've watched the entire DVD while fixing the aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro, I realize there are actually quite a few scenes from MGM's ""A Night At The Opera"" (1935) and ""A Day At The Races"" (1936). So they're not from public domain trailers. For some reason, the documentary has absolutely NO clips from the later films.)Other than that, this is the best documentary I've seen on the Marx Brothers. It will even bring a tear to your eye when Groucho's son Arthur talks about the day Harpo died. And as another reviewer has mentioned, this is the only documentary that includes interviews with people who were actually there, and those interviews are hilarious. Additional interviewees such as Dick Cavett and David Steinberg repeat stories that Groucho had told them years before, and they re-tell them very well.There are no existing ""in-depth"" interviews with any of the four Marx brothers that I am aware of, only ""fluff"" publicity interviews from when they were active and a few nasty ""old fogey"" interviews from Groucho and Zeppo that you'd rather not watch.I've seen the other two Marx Brothers documentaries, and I don't really remember them. This one I'll remember forever. It's as good as it gets.",4,No reason to trash this great documentary,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,2118,"['..', 'DVD', 'bit', 'squished', 'interviewees', 'are', 'bit', 'wider', 'should', 'be', 'also', 'bit', 'garish', 'color', 'laserdisc', 'documentary', 'was', 'produced', '1983', 'did', ""n't"", 'exhibit', 'problems', 'so', 'whoever', 'did', 'transfer', 'video', 'master', 'DVD', 'screwed', 'up', 'bit.Another', 'drawback', 'DVD', 'movie', 'clips', 'are', 'premastered', 'laserdisc', 'masters', 'currently', 'available', 'DVDs', 'individual', 'films', 'have', 'superior', 'transfers.The', 'only', 'drawback', 'documentary', 'lack', 'clips', 'MGM', 'films', 'apparently', 'had', 'permission', 'MCA', 'then-owners', 'Paramount', 'films', '1929', '1933', 'not', 'MGM', 'owners', 'creators', 'MGM', 'films', '1935', 'onward', 'only', 'one', 'clip', 'later', 'films', 'bit', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', 'actually', 'original', 'trailer', 'public', 'domain', 'EDIT', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'entire', 'DVD', 'fixing', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Final', 'Cut', 'Pro', 'realize', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'few', 'scenes', 'MGM', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera', '1935', 'Day', 'Races', '1936', ""'re"", 'not', 'public', 'domain', 'trailers', 'reason', 'documentary', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'clips', 'later', 'films', 'Other', 'best', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'will', 'even', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'when', 'Groucho', 'son', 'Arthur', 'talks', 'day', 'Harpo', 'died', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'only', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'there', 'interviews', 'are', 'hilarious', 'Additional', 'interviewees', 'such', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'David', 'Steinberg', 'repeat', 'stories', 'Groucho', 'had', 'told', 'years', 're-tell', 'very', 'are', 'existing', 'in-depth', 'interviews', 'four', 'Marx', 'brothers', 'am', 'aware', 'only', 'fluff', 'publicity', 'interviews', 'when', 'were', 'active', 'few', 'nasty', 'old', 'fogey', 'interviews', 'Groucho', 'Zeppo', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'watch.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'two', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'documentaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'remember', 'one', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'forever', 'as', 'good']",N/A
