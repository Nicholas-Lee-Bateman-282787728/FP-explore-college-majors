It's the story of what has become of a once majestic ocean liner, moored and forlorn at a pier in South Philadelphia.  A history of the ship's glory days and how she came by her present condition and dilemma is lovingly presented. This ship is a floating piece of history and Americana that deserves better, as the DVD recounts.  Once you have seen this movie you'll want to join the SS United States Conservancy and find out how to help save her.In fact, visit [...] for more information about the SS United States, her current status and a movement underway to restore her to some semblance of her former glory.  SSUSC was instrumental in helping to get this film made and released to DVD.",5,Narrative on a forgotten icon,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,832,"['missed', 'piece', 'iconic', 'ship', 'SS', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'aired', 'selectively', 'PBS', 'stations', 'country', 'buy', 'DVD', 'story', 'what', 'become', 'once', 'majestic', 'ocean', 'liner', 'moored', 'forlorn', 'pier', 'South', 'Philadelphia', 'A', 'history', 'ship', 'glory', 'days', 'how', 'came', 'present', 'condition', 'dilemma', 'lovingly', 'presented', 'ship', 'floating', 'piece', 'history', 'Americana', 'better', 'DVD', 'recounts', 'Once', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'join', 'SS', 'United', 'States', 'Conservancy', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'help', 'save', 'her.In', 'fact', 'visit', '[', ']', 'more', 'information', 'SS', 'United', 'States', 'current', 'status', 'movement', 'underway', 'restore', 'semblance', 'former', 'glory', 'SSUSC', 'was', 'instrumental', 'helping', 'get', 'film', 'made', 'released', 'DVD']",SS United States: Lady in Waiting
1182397,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B001DO0304,Kevin Killian,"[19, 20]","One memory I have of my dad is him taking me to see the SS United States, the subject of Robert Radler's new documentary, when it came to dock in Nerw York Harbor.  I would sit on his shoulders and he would point out, from the dock, the various features of the great ship.  ""There are many liners,"" he said, ""but this one's the grandest ship ever christened.""  He and my mom never went anywhere, they were too bsuy raising a passel of kids out on Long Island, but I remember one time his old wartime buddy and the friend's wife were setting sail on a voyage to Europe, and they invited my parents to a shipboard party before the sail--and I got to go too--course, I was only a tadpole and remember hardly anything except the clouds of confetti that enveloped us everywhere we walked on the huge, wide, sun deck of the United States.  A sun deck big as a supermarket!When I saw the documentary ""Lady in Waiting"" all these floods of memory came rolling in, but I think the film will work even if you have never heard to the ship before; it is designed to appeal to anyone who has ever sailed anywhere--or ever wanted to, and its clever combination of vintage, newsreel and originally shot footage and contemporary interviews mimics somewhat the easy, almost hypnotic motion of a great craft on the water.And passion!  The people you will hear and see speaking of their love of the SSUS love the old ""lady in waiting"" (now biding its time in Philadelphia where it has become part of the scenery), and that love shines through every frame of this stirring documentary.  At times you have to pinch yourself and say, ""And this isn't a madeup story, dramatic and inspirational as it is.  By golly, this is real!""New material supplements well-chosen clips so the feeling throughout is a delicate balance between past and present--the two worlds collide in an eerie, romantic way.  All right, the ship is 700 thousand tons of steel but it comes alive as a living, breathing presence, both in mothballs and in period footage of her glory days.The whole doc goes by in what seems like minutes.  I can't wait to see what happens with the preservation campaign, more power to the conservancy.  Let it shine as it did for my late father, whose dream it always was to sail away on it.  Sadly, by the time he could raise enough money to take himself and my mom to Europe, the ship he loved had been decommissioned!  Everyone who has ever had a dream should be able to identify with the warm hearts and high hopes of the makers of SS UNITED STATES: LADY IN WAITING.",5,The Grandest Ship Ever Christened,1229212800,"12 14, 2008",2008,2548,"['One', 'memory', 'have', 'dad', 'taking', 'see', 'SS', 'United', 'States', 'subject', 'Robert', 'Radler', 'new', 'documentary', 'when', 'came', 'dock', 'Nerw', 'York', 'Harbor', 'would', 'sit', 'shoulders', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'dock', 'various', 'features', 'great', 'ship', 'are', 'many', 'liners', 'said', 'one', 'grandest', 'ship', 'ever', 'christened', 'mom', 'never', 'went', 'anywhere', 'were', 'too', 'bsuy', 'raising', 'passel', 'kids', 'out', 'Long', 'Island', 'remember', 'one', 'time', 'old', 'wartime', 'buddy', 'friend', 'wife', 'were', 'setting', 'sail', 'voyage', 'Europe', 'invited', 'parents', 'shipboard', 'party', 'sail', 'got', 'go', 'too', 'course', 'was', 'only', 'tadpole', 'remember', 'hardly', 'anything', 'clouds', 'confetti', 'enveloped', 'everywhere', 'walked', 'huge', 'wide', 'sun', 'deck', 'United', 'States', 'sun', 'deck', 'big', 'supermarket', 'When', 'saw', 'documentary', 'Lady', 'Waiting', 'floods', 'memory', 'came', 'rolling', 'think', 'film', 'will', 'work', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'ship', 'designed', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'sailed', 'anywhere', 'ever', 'wanted', 'clever', 'combination', 'vintage', 'newsreel', 'originally', 'shot', 'footage', 'contemporary', 'interviews', 'mimics', 'somewhat', 'easy', 'almost', 'hypnotic', 'motion', 'great', 'craft', 'water.And', 'passion', 'people', 'will', 'hear', 'see', 'speaking', 'love', 'SSUS', 'love', 'old', 'lady', 'waiting', 'now', 'biding', 'time', 'Philadelphia', 'where', 'become', 'part', 'scenery', 'love', 'shines', 'frame', 'stirring', 'documentary', 'times', 'have', 'pinch', 'say', ""n't"", 'madeup', 'story', 'dramatic', 'inspirational', 'golly', 'real', 'New', 'material', 'supplements', 'well-chosen', 'clips', 'feeling', 'delicate', 'balance', 'past', 'present', 'two', 'worlds', 'collide', 'eerie', 'romantic', 'way', 'right', 'ship', '700', 'thousand', 'tons', 'steel', 'alive', 'living', 'breathing', 'presence', 'mothballs', 'period', 'footage', 'glory', 'days.The', 'whole', 'doc', 'what', 'like', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'preservation', 'campaign', 'more', 'power', 'conservancy', 'Let', 'shine', 'did', 'late', 'father', 'dream', 'always', 'was', 'sail', 'away', 'Sadly', 'time', 'could', 'raise', 'enough', 'money', 'take', 'mom', 'Europe', 'ship', 'loved', 'had', 'been', 'decommissioned', 'Everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'dream', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'warm', 'hearts', 'high', 'hopes', 'makers', 'SS', 'UNITED', 'STATES', 'LADY', 'IN', 'WAITING']",SS United States: Lady in Waiting
