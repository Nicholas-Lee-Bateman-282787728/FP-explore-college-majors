1637323,AKOJXI7735NT0,B00BPFPM7A,M. Kenny,"[3, 3]","I saw this film on the Late, Late Show many, many years ago and really loved it.  Finally someone at Warner Bros. has put it on DVD.  The print is pretty good with no major problems and is clean and the sound is crisp and clear.  I was watching The Quite Man recently and remembered this film, made by Ford around the same time, and looked on Amazon and WOW! there it was.  It is a DVD R but that is better than nothing.The stories are good and the acting fits each story.  The Majesty of the Law is a ""country Irish"" story with all the expected expressions (""Is it yourself?""  ""That it is"", etc) but a good story line of a man set in the ""ould ways"" and refusing to pay a fine for hitting a man who called him a liar and willing to go to jail for it.  ""One Minute's Wait"" is about a train arriving at a station for, as the title say, a quick stop.  The stop goes on for some time as the train is delayed time and again for different comic reasons while we see the interaction between the crew, passengers and station personnel unfold to comic effect.  Broadly acted in the Irish stage tradition.  ""1921"" is an adaption of a play called ""The Rising of the Moon"" and involves trying to free a political prisoner, about to be hanged by the ""Black and Tan"", during ""The Troubles"" just before Ireland was free from English rule.  Not a really serious look at the times (as Ford's ""The Informer"" was) but with enough drama and humor to satisfy.If you enjoy Irish storytelling, especially in a lighter vein, you will enjoy this film.",5,FInally on DVD.,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,1527,"['saw', 'film', 'Late', 'Late', 'Show', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'loved', 'Finally', 'someone', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'put', 'DVD', 'print', 'pretty', 'good', 'major', 'problems', 'clean', 'sound', 'crisp', 'clear', 'was', 'watching', 'Quite', 'Man', 'recently', 'remembered', 'film', 'made', 'Ford', 'same', 'time', 'looked', 'Amazon', 'WOW', 'was', 'DVD', 'R', 'better', 'nothing.The', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'acting', 'fits', 'story', 'Majesty', 'Law', 'country', 'Irish', 'story', 'expected', 'expressions', 'etc', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'man', 'set', 'ould', 'ways', 'refusing', 'pay', 'fine', 'hitting', 'man', 'who', 'called', 'liar', 'willing', 'go', 'jail', 'One', 'Minute', 'Wait', 'train', 'arriving', 'station', 'title', 'say', 'quick', 'stop', 'stop', 'time', 'train', 'delayed', 'time', 'again', 'different', 'comic', 'reasons', 'see', 'interaction', 'crew', 'passengers', 'station', 'personnel', 'unfold', 'comic', 'effect', 'Broadly', 'acted', 'Irish', 'stage', 'tradition', '1921', 'adaption', 'play', 'called', 'Rising', 'Moon', 'trying', 'free', 'political', 'prisoner', 'be', 'hanged', 'Black', 'Tan', 'Troubles', 'just', 'Ireland', 'was', 'free', 'English', 'rule', 'Not', 'really', 'serious', 'look', 'times', 'Ford', 'Informer', 'was', 'enough', 'drama', 'humor', 'satisfy.If', 'enjoy', 'Irish', 'storytelling', 'especially', 'lighter', 'vein', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film']",The Rising of the Moon
