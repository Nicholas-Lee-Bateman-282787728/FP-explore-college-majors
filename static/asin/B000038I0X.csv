Christopher ( Peter ) Knightthe name Adrianne Curry his new wife, ring a bell?below is someone under 30, awwwww, man lighten up!  42 yr old here.A couple years ago, I was working at Blockbuster right after graduating from college. I saw the cover to this movie on the shelf since I'd starting working there, but judged it as kinetic crap by its horribly cheesy cover and name. Yes, I judged this movie by its cover. A customer about my age (25) then told me, unprovoked, that it was one of the funniest movies he had seen in years. He said he was surprised by it and that I should check it out. So, I did.Wow. I laughed and laughed and laughed. I hadn't seen a movie that made me laugh that hard in a long time. I actually couldn't wait to watch it again--this time with my girlfriend. What a disaster. She absolutely hated it as much as I liked it. We didn't even get through 45 minutes of it because she couldn't take it anymore. Apparently, she thought it was one of the most un-funny movies she'd ever seen. A negative funniness even, if that's possible.What does this tell us?This movie probably has a target audience of 18-30 year old males.Its rather dark view of the motives of women and, to that end, perceived ""psycho"" women, is fit-form to any man who's been with a woman that went too far, too fast--no matter how well the both of you got along. This movie is funny because of the powerlessness men feel in the face of a psycho woman--they can absolutely tear you apart and make everyone else think that it's your fault because you're the one who is falling apart. As Yoda might say: Dark, this movie is.French Stewart is completely impotent emotionally, physically, and mentally in this relationship. If you're a man, you probably know this emotion all too well. This movie capitalizes on that darkest of dark corners with which to view a woman in a relationship such as this. In that sense, the movie is almost hyperbolic. Needless to say, it doesn't paint women in any sort of real favorable light. No wonder my girlfriend hated it.So, guys, watch this movie, laugh you arse off--and don't show it to your girlfriend, she'll hate it.

516898,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000038I0X,Only-A-Child,"[1, 6]","""Love Stinks"" is a generally unfunny comedy that will leave you wondering why anyone financed something that promised so little and delivered about what you would have expected from a simple-minded script and an unimpressive cast.Fans of French Stewart (""3rd Rock From the Sun"") will at least be entertained by his many one-liners. Unfortunately they are the only elements that work in this ill-advised movie. Like a lot of this mid-budget stuff, ""Love Stinks"" places its characters in ultra upscale surroundings and shows them living posh life styles; trying to fool viewers into believing it is a high-end production. But few moviegoers come from the richest portion of the 20-something demographic. Those living a less than swank lifestyle found viewer identification difficult;  so the movie was quickly pulled from its theatrical distribution.Almost everyone else will have difficulty connecting with the film, which is basically the story of Seth's (Stewart) efforts to escape the grasp of the beautiful Chelsea, his materialistic and totally controlling interior decorator. Like this is a continuing problem for all of us!Chelsea is played by former beauty queen Bridgette Wilson (""I Know What You Did Last Summer""). Wilson is a better actress than she is given credit for as people tend to dismiss her because of a non-acting background, and she is well suited to this type of bad girl role. But the script gives her no opportunity to add dimension to this character.  At least most of us have seen this sort of mega-manipulative blonde at work. Desperate to marry, Chelsea gets the rich Seth in her sights, pressures him into a quick commitment, moves in and alters his priorities, then makes his life hell when he postpones the marriage. Most of this is told in an extended flashback, necessary for no reason other than to pad the running length so the movie will qualify as a feature.Of course Wilson and Stewart's acting gets a boost by relative comparison to the barely competent performances of the supporting cast, which includes talent challenged Tyra Banks and Tiffany Amber Thiesen. Steve Hytner (Kenny Bania from ""Seinfeld"") also appears but adds little to the comic quality of the film.""Love Stinks"" was written and directed by the guy who is blamed for creating ""Full House"" and ""Hangin' with Mr. Cooper"".Ultimately, all you are left with are Stewart's occasional one-liners and Wilson's beauty. These are not enough to carry a whole feature film but are at least something for which to be thankful if you should be forced to actually view the entire film.Then again, what do I know?

516902,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000038I0X,Reviewer,"[5, 22]","Right out of the chute, I have to tell you-- this is one scary movie.  That's right, scary.  I mean, to think that there are people running around out there in the world who actually think this kind of inane prattle is ""funny"" is downright frightening.  And if anything about ""Love Stinks,"" directed by Jeff Franklin, reflects real life in even some remote, unimaginable way, then please stop the world, I wanna get off.  This is a one note movie about a television sitcom writer named Seth (French Stewart), who gets involved with a woman, Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson),  with marriage on her mind and him in her sights.  She wants to, he doesn't, and that's about it; one note, and even at that, it's out of tune.  Unfortunately, what the makers of this movie would pass off as humor is no laughing matter; it's merely a no-joke display of mean-spiritedness and bad acting that is-- at it's best moments-- infantile, gross and disgusting.  Comedy, of course, is the most subjective of genres, and individual tastes and sensibilities will weigh in heavily in regards to how this movie will be received.  But to anyone with half a brain and any self-respect whatsoever, being subjected to ninety minutes or so of this would have to be considered nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment.  Suffice to say that after this debacle, director Franklin will not be making the Hollywood ""A"" list anytime soon.  Nor the ""B,"" ""C,"" ""D"" or ""F"" lists.  The good news for him is that whatever project he takes on next couldn't possibly turn out any worse than this,  and that means he's only got one way to go from here, and that's up.  As far as the performances go, French Stewart-- who obviously went into this with his eyes wide open-- had better hope that ""Third Rock From the Sun"" lasts, well...forever.  Because if this is the best he can manage after the jump-start his career's received from TV, he'd be well advised to take the ""Rock"" money and run.  And Bridgette Wilson?  What on earth could've possessed her to take this part?  With her talent and looks this is the best she could come up with?  It makes you wonder if she even read the script before signing on to this project.  I'd like to think she either owed someone a BIG favor, or better yet, was the victim of a plot by a bitter and disgruntled manager or agent to malign her for personal, as yet undisclosed, reasons.  The bottom line is, Stewart and Wilson both have a lot to offer; it just seems so sad to see them wasted in something as unworthy as this ridiculous, offensive movie that isn't worth the film that retains it's untoward images.  The supporting cast includes Bill Bellamy as Larry, Tyra Banks as Holly (proving here that beauty does not necessarily equate with acting ability), Steve Hytner as Marty, Jason Bateman (in a horrendous performance) as Jesse, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Rebecca.  A supercilious effort that has to resort to bathroom humor, cat cruelty and an Elvis impersonator in it's feeble attempt at getting a laugh-- which it doesn't (and note that even the word ""humor"" is used loosely within the context of this sentence)-- ""Love Stinks"" is a movie to be avoided at all costs.  If someone perchance suggests to you that this one is entertaining and good for some laughs, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!  Or at least for the nearest exit.  Immediately.
