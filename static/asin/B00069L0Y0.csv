864260,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00069L0Y0,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[1, 1]","When the movie tag line reads ""Revenge was all he had left"" you could be forgiven for expecting a straight out of the box Van Damme / Seagal style beat em up, but like wine, Jean Claude seems to be improving with age. Although the script is dogged with formula trappings, gone are the complicated and annoyingly overlong martial art fight scenes where the heroes can take inhuman beatings, and take on a whole army single handed, replaced instead, with a great deal of gunfire and short graphic violent episodes. JCVD plays Ben Archer who gets mixed up in a drug trafficking, INS corruption, Oriental mafia style yarn, whose wife is murdered and son is kidnapped 10 minutes into the picture. Surprisingly though, we don't follow the standard pattern from here, and what follows is dark, gritty, and often extremely violent but reasonably plausible revenge story. Well deserving of an R rating, and probably bordered the NC17 rating especially in one scene where someone is tortured to death with an electric drill. The director cleverly leaves much to the subjective imagination of the viewer as a lot of violence happens just off screen, but there are also plenty of action sequences to balance the script, and please fans alike. I've always liked Van Damme movies (with a few exceptions) and it's nice to see him evolving and becoming more actor driven. With out a hint of an opportunity to do his trade mark ""box splits"" he instead almost quietly wades through the picture with a brooding menace that is both believable and engaging. Overall, and despite some sizeable plot holes, and lack of back story this is a good movie, and although (like the aforementioned Seagal) most of Jean Claudes movies are straight to video these days, this one at least probably deserved a theatrical release. Even though it has a small studio feel, and lacks the production polish of say ""The Punisher"" or ""Man on Fire"" it's not far behind in entertainment value. DVD quality is good but not exceptional, and ""extra's"" are a bit thin on the disc. Purchase if you are a big fan, otherwise rent first.

864264,A1GSNXORN62759,B00069L0Y0,David,"[3, 6]","""Wake of Dead"" is the most loathsome, disgusting, unethical, and poorly shot film I've seen in a while. Even if you took out the scenes with Van Damme harassing and screaming at a defenseless 11-year old girl, thrusting in an unpleasant sex scene, stabbing a villain in the genitals, and having the good guys torture a buffoon with an electric drill, it would still be the nadir of Van Damme's dying career. This film is basically about Ben Archer (Van Damme) trying desperately to get out of the violence and secrecy that being a ""mob-enforcer"" entails and live his life straight for his wife (a social worker) and his young boy.  Or, as he says in his thick-tongued accent: ""I'n fished. I'n tyred. I ded stuff in ma pass I'n note prood off, in ma life, I juss wantta prootek ma famile."" Even though he says ""I loaf ma wiffe,"" and thinks thrusting his waist proves it, he cannot protect her. When his wife takes her work home - when she brings home a Chinese druglord's daughter who ran away - the Chinese come looking.  It would have probably only taken about a week to get his daughter back from the American government and court system (I don't care what kind of ""investigating"" Van Damme's wife does, no one is going to believe a desperate story from a desperate little girl trying to stay in the country), the Chinese drug lord tracks down his daughter and does the most logical thing to do when you're in a straight-to-video action flick: he shoots everyone in the vicinity. But still, he doesn't get his daughter back! Of course, Van Damme's wife is killed. So he gets angry and kills the drug lord and about fifty other idiots. Well, all this happens after Van Damme turns maudlin, drinks gallons of liqueur, and cries out: ""I'n oing to mizzah. I'n oing to mizzah."" This drawn out scene made me a little uncomfortable; it probably reflects what Van Damme does every night when he thinks about the pathetic scripts he's given.There are plenty of fight scenes for you action lovers, although Van Damme seems to have decided to give up beating people to death - like he did in his early films - and now relies wholly on shooting everyone several times.  This might have something to do with that huge shiner he has on his forehead. (Did someone crack him over the head with a liqueur bottle?) It doesn't help cover it up much when the whole film is shot entirely in extreme facial close-ups! Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he doesn't look like he can fight. If I ever got into a fight with Van Damme, the first thing I would do would be to block all his punches with my face and head and deflect all his kicks to my solar plexus and gut. . . so I do admit he would take me in a fight. But it really doesn't do wonders for your career as an ""action superstar"" if you get beat up a lot.dd",1,wok of deeth -- theyre air much wahrs,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",2005,2796,"['Wake', 'Dead', 'most', 'loathsome', 'disgusting', 'unethical', 'poorly', 'shot', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Even', 'took', 'out', 'scenes', 'Van', 'Damme', 'harassing', 'screaming', 'defenseless', '11-year', 'old', 'girl', 'thrusting', 'unpleasant', 'sex', 'scene', 'stabbing', 'villain', 'genitals', 'having', 'good', 'guys', 'torture', 'buffoon', 'electric', 'drill', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'nadir', 'Van', 'Damme', 'dying', 'career', 'film', 'basically', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'Van', 'Damme', 'trying', 'desperately', 'get', 'violence', 'secrecy', 'being', 'mob-enforcer', 'entails', 'live', 'life', 'straight', 'wife', 'social', 'worker', 'young', 'boy', 'thick-tongued', 'accent', 'n', 'fished', 'n', 'tyred', 'ded', 'stuff', 'ma', 'pass', 'n', 'note', 'prood', 'off', 'ma', 'life', 'juss', 'wantta', 'prootek', 'ma', 'famile', 'Even', 'loaf', 'ma', 'wiffe', 'thrusting', 'waist', 'can', 'not', 'protect', 'When', 'wife', 'work', 'home', 'when', 'home', 'Chinese', 'druglord', 'daughter', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'Chinese', 'come', 'looking', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'only', 'taken', 'about', 'week', 'get', 'daughter', 'back', 'American', 'government', 'court', 'system', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'kind', 'investigating', 'Van', 'Damme', 'wife', 'one', 'going', 'believe', 'desperate', 'story', 'desperate', 'little', 'girl', 'trying', 'stay', 'country', 'Chinese', 'drug', 'lord', 'down', 'daughter', 'most', 'logical', 'thing', 'do', 'when', ""'re"", 'straight-to-video', 'action', 'flick', 'everyone', 'vicinity', 'still', ""n't"", 'get', 'daughter', 'back', 'course', 'Van', 'Damme', 'wife', 'killed', 'angry', 'drug', 'lord', 'fifty', 'other', 'idiots', 'Well', 'Van', 'Damme', 'maudlin', 'drinks', 'gallons', 'liqueur', 'cries', 'out', 'n', 'oing', 'mizzah', 'n', 'oing', 'mizzah', 'out', 'scene', 'made', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'probably', 'what', 'Van', 'Damme', 'night', 'when', 'pathetic', 'scripts', 'are', 'plenty', 'fight', 'scenes', 'action', 'lovers', 'Van', 'Damme', 'have', 'decided', 'give', 'up', 'beating', 'people', 'death', 'did', 'early', 'films', 'now', 'wholly', 'shooting', 'everyone', 'several', 'times', 'might', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'huge', 'shiner', 'forehead', 'Did', 'someone', 'crack', 'head', 'liqueur', 'bottle', ""n't"", 'help', 'cover', 'up', 'much', 'when', 'whole', 'film', 'shot', 'entirely', 'extreme', 'facial', 'close-ups', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'look', 'can', 'fight', 'ever', 'got', 'fight', 'Van', 'Damme', 'first', 'thing', 'would', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'block', 'punches', 'face', 'head', 'deflect', 'kicks', 'solar', 'plexus', 'gut', 'do', 'admit', 'would', 'take', 'fight', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'wonders', 'career', 'action', 'superstar', 'get', 'beat', 'up', 'lot.dd']",N/A
864265,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00069L0Y0,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[2, 2]","It's another action movie with a story of revenge, but Wake of Death takes itself more seriously than one would expect of the typical Van Damme film.  Realism has taken over (in most of Van Damme's recent films) resulting in better acting and plot details, and some bloodier action but less of it.The directing and music set a tone that places Wake of Death in an action/revenge category a bit more sophisticated than the rest.  However, if we wanted to see a beautiful epic drama there are plenty of other films out there with superb acting and stories, this is not that, but to see how far Van Damme is maturing in this sense is a bit of a treat, as is the bonus of some action that won't always be found in the other hollywood films.  Wake of Death focuses more on story, though it is just a matter of revenge, it pays attention to some details keeping it interesting between action scenes, which there are not very many of until the last 30 minutes of the film.I personally prefer watching Van Damme films for the action, and in the case of Wake of Death the action element is not completely satisfied.  The good news is the action is contained in a certain reality, making things flow better with the story.  However, the car chase scenes were a bit distracting to enjoy, as the scenes were not smooth but appeared choppy with fequent editing and directing.  The hand to hand combat scenes were almost always over before they began, so do not expect any martial arts like in the good ole days (no Kickboxer of Bloodsport here).The story focuses around a Chinese Triad member (Simon Yam) , and father, who's young 14 year old girl has fled to the U.S. after witnessing the death of her mother by her father's knife.  Ben Archer's (Van Damme) wife takes her in out of kindess, but good deeds seem to go unrewarded as the father and his gang come to the U.S., very ticked off and will have nothing stand in their way.  The worst occus (though predictable) and Ben Archer's son is also kidnapped.  He thus sets out for revenge and to get his son back.  Simon Yam (KillZone) does an ok job as appearing villainous but never overwhelmed me as a great opponent for Van Damme.Wake of Death should be viewed by Van Damme fans.  Action is there, though not as much as one would hope, but it's a neat watch to see how Van Damme has changed his film style around over the years, where the action has gone away, improved acting and well-created story (though unoriginal) have emerged.Acting - 4Action - 3Characters - 3.5Story - 3.5Overall - 3.5",3,[3.5] Nothing too original here,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2536,"['action', 'movie', 'story', 'revenge', 'Wake', 'Death', 'more', 'seriously', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'typical', 'Van', 'Damme', 'film', 'Realism', 'taken', 'over', 'most', 'Van', 'Damme', 'recent', 'films', 'resulting', 'better', 'acting', 'plot', 'details', 'bloodier', 'action', 'less', 'it.The', 'directing', 'music', 'set', 'tone', 'Wake', 'Death', 'action/revenge', 'category', 'bit', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'rest', 'However', 'wanted', 'see', 'beautiful', 'epic', 'drama', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'films', 'there', 'superb', 'acting', 'stories', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'Van', 'Damme', 'maturing', 'sense', 'bit', 'treat', 'bonus', 'action', 'wo', ""n't"", 'always', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'hollywood', 'films', 'Wake', 'Death', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'matter', 'revenge', 'attention', 'details', 'keeping', 'interesting', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'many', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film.I', 'personally', 'prefer', 'watching', 'Van', 'Damme', 'films', 'action', 'case', 'Wake', 'Death', 'action', 'element', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'good', 'news', 'action', 'contained', 'certain', 'reality', 'making', 'things', 'flow', 'better', 'story', 'However', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'were', 'bit', 'distracting', 'enjoy', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'smooth', 'appeared', 'choppy', 'fequent', 'editing', 'directing', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'scenes', 'were', 'almost', 'always', 'began', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'martial', 'arts', 'good', 'ole', 'days', 'Kickboxer', 'Bloodsport', 'here', '.The', 'story', 'Chinese', 'Triad', 'member', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'father', 'who', 'young', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'fled', 'U.S.', 'witnessing', 'death', 'mother', 'father', 'knife', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'Van', 'Damme', 'wife', 'out', 'kindess', 'good', 'deeds', 'seem', 'go', 'unrewarded', 'father', 'gang', 'come', 'U.S.', 'very', 'ticked', 'off', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'stand', 'way', 'worst', 'occus', 'predictable', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'son', 'also', 'kidnapped', 'thus', 'out', 'revenge', 'get', 'son', 'back', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'KillZone', 'ok', 'job', 'appearing', 'villainous', 'never', 'overwhelmed', 'great', 'opponent', 'Van', 'Damme.Wake', 'Death', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'Action', 'there', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'neat', 'watch', 'see', 'how', 'Van', 'Damme', 'changed', 'film', 'style', 'years', 'where', 'action', 'gone', 'away', 'improved', 'acting', 'well-created', 'story', 'unoriginal', 'have', 'emerged.Acting', '4Action', '3Characters', '3.5Story', '3.5Overall', '3.5']",N/A

Much like Desert Heat which ressurected his film making he makes another good one.This movie is about a little girl who witnesses her father kill her mother.

But when her father realizes what happens he takes action.He has Jean Claude Van Dammes wife killed and is about to have his son killed when he escapes. When Van Damme gets back he finds his wife dead and he has his brother go searching for the kiler. Van Damme goes on a killing spree killing anyone who was in connection to his wifes death. And finally gets to the big man himself, the one who has his wife killed. In the end he kills him and gets wounded himself.The main thing that sticks out in this film is Van Dammes acting, not his fighting. It seems like a blah blah story but if you would see his acting its magnificant. He really looks sad when he finds his wife dead, when he kills the people who killed his wife he has tears in his eyes why hes doing it. Like in one scene he beats a man over and over with a pistol and starts to cry why he does it, like getting all the anger out.This has to be his best acting peroformance of his career.

864269,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00069L0Y0,Jason,"[6, 7]","The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1.  Who is he?  Ben Archer, a worn down bouncer with weatherbeaten features who's ready to quit his rugged life at high-profile clubs (think Swayze from Road House, but with an accent)2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged? His wife Cynthia (Lisa King) gets her throat slit (gruesome close-up afterwards), his father-in-law gets blasted, and his mother-in-law gets an explosive head-shot from close range (like popping a water balloon with a pin).3.  Does he take his shirt off?  Because it's such an essential plot device, there is an early shower scene, a sex scene, and a bath scene in which JCVD is shirtless.4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress? He gets to ""say goodbye"" to Cynthia very early in Cinemax-quality bawdy tryst.5.  Is there a tournament?  This is a grisly, evil, realistic battle to the death.  It's JCVD at his skull-crushing darkest.  There is no time for a stupid tournament with rules.6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Didn't you hear me!?  JCVD has people to maim, kill, and torture!7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  This is serious!  Borderline psychotic executioners do not do the splits.8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  No, but his brother punches someone in the balls, and performs a free castration later.9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  He's fighting the Chinese Triad.  What do you think?10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  No.  In fact, JCVD kills about 50 guys who previously thought they were unbeatable.11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  No hindrance, this is all about the revenge killing.12.  Does he win?  JCVD does everything but cure cancer in this one.  You're damn right he wins.I think the message in this one is that JCVD is against human trafficking, drugs, and the Chinese Triad.  Basically, a Chinese girl named Kim runs away after her mother is murdered, becomes an import into America, gets pseudo-adopted by an INS agent, Cynthia Archer, and is tracked down by her Chinese Triad father named Sun Quan - the same guy who killed Kim's mother.  During the hunt for his daughter, Sun Quan's people kill everyone Archer knows, and in doing so, they unleash the Charles Bronson within JCVD.The action rivals the blockbuster movies spewed forth by the biggest budget of Hollywood movies.  Awesome fights and action, a motorcycle chase that could be in the X-Games, a few graphic, gruesome deaths, superb acting (JCVD's best acting to date), great cinematography, and one of the top five car chases in cinema history, there really isn't anything missing.  A few of the deaths are stunning, and along with the ominous music, are almost Tarantinoesque.  One particularly gory moment involves some angry associates of JCVD, a power-drill, and an unfortunate enemy with information.I can't give this movie enough credit.  It should have made it to theatres.  It's better than the majority of action movies that have been produced in the last ten years.  In my opinion, this could easily be considered the best of all JCVD movies.  Wake of Death is highly recommended for not just JCVD-aholics, but action fans as well.",5,DEATH WISH VAN DAMME!,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,3193,"['Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Review', 'Matrix', 'JCVD-RM', '1.', 'Who', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'worn', 'down', 'bouncer', 'weatherbeaten', 'features', 'who', 'ready', 'quit', 'rugged', 'life', 'high-profile', 'clubs', 'think', 'Swayze', 'Road', 'House', 'accent', '2', 'Which', 'family', 'member/friend', 'must', 'be', 'avenged', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'Lisa', 'King', 'throat', 'slit', 'gruesome', 'close-up', 'afterwards', 'father-in-law', 'blasted', 'mother-in-law', 'explosive', 'head-shot', 'close', 'range', 'popping', 'water', 'balloon', 'pin', '.3', 'take', 'shirt', 'off', 'such', 'essential', 'plot', 'device', 'early', 'shower', 'scene', 'sex', 'scene', 'bath', 'scene', 'JCVD', 'shirtless.4', 'have', 'sex', 'C-List', 'actress', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Cynthia', 'very', 'early', 'Cinemax-quality', 'bawdy', 'tryst.5', 'there', 'tournament', 'grisly', 'evil', 'realistic', 'battle', 'death', 'JCVD', 'skull-crushing', 'darkest', 'time', 'stupid', 'tournament', 'rules.6', 'training', 'needed', 'tournament', 'Did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'JCVD', 'people', 'maim', 'kill', 'torture', '7', 'Does', 'do', 'splits', 'training', 'tournament', 'serious', 'Borderline', 'psychotic', 'executioners', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'splits.8', 'punch', 'someone', 'balls', 'No', 'brother', 'punches', 'someone', 'balls', 'free', 'castration', 'later.9', 'do', 'series', 'flying', '360', 'kicks', 'fighting', 'Chinese', 'Triad', 'What', 'do', 'think', '10', 'enemy', 'unbeatable', 'fact', 'JCVD', '50', 'guys', 'who', 'previously', 'thought', 'were', 'unbeatable.11', 'overcome', 'injury', 'other', 'hindrance', 'hindrance', 'revenge', 'killing.12', 'win', 'JCVD', 'everything', 'cure', 'cancer', 'one', ""'re"", 'damn', 'right', 'think', 'message', 'one', 'JCVD', 'human', 'trafficking', 'drugs', 'Chinese', 'Triad', 'Basically', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'named', 'Kim', 'away', 'mother', 'murdered', 'import', 'America', 'pseudo-adopted', 'INS', 'agent', 'Cynthia', 'Archer', 'tracked', 'down', 'Chinese', 'Triad', 'father', 'named', 'Sun', 'Quan', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'killed', 'Kim', 'mother', 'hunt', 'daughter', 'Sun', 'Quan', 'people', 'kill', 'everyone', 'Archer', 'doing', 'so', 'unleash', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'JCVD.The', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'spewed', 'forth', 'biggest', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'Awesome', 'fights', 'action', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'could', 'be', 'X-Games', 'few', 'graphic', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'superb', 'acting', 'JCVD', 'best', 'acting', 'date', 'great', 'cinematography', 'one', 'top', 'five', 'car', 'chases', 'cinema', 'history', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'missing', 'few', 'deaths', 'are', 'stunning', 'ominous', 'music', 'are', 'almost', 'Tarantinoesque', 'One', 'particularly', 'gory', 'moment', 'angry', 'associates', 'JCVD', 'power-drill', 'unfortunate', 'enemy', 'information.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'movie', 'enough', 'credit', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'theatres', 'better', 'majority', 'action', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'opinion', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'considered', 'best', 'JCVD', 'movies', 'Wake', 'Death', 'highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'just', 'JCVD-aholics', 'action', 'fans', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Stars Jean Claude Van Damme as Ben Archer Simon Yan as Sun Quan, Danny Keogh as Mac Hoggins, Lisa King as Cyintha Archer, Valerie Tian as Kim, & Tony Schiena as Tony lol a LA Cop. Story is Ben Archer has been working for the mafia in LA for years he wants to spend more time with his Wife Cyintha who's a social worker & his Son Nicholas. INS finds some Illegal immigrants from China Cyintha finds a girl Kim she wants to take her with her her boss Mac Hoggins doesn't think it's a good idea the girl is The Daughter of Sun Quan & he's came to Los Angeles to get her Hoggins is an inside man for Sun Quan. Hoggins rats Cyintha Archer out & it results in her death. Nicholas & Kim escape when Archer finds his wife dead you can see the hate & I like the anger & vengeance portrayed by Van Damme. The kids are found by Archer's old mob friends they decide to help Archer go after the killers. They go to this hk3r house you get some decent kills cool scene a head gets blown off with a shot gun. Eventually all fingers point to Hoggins Mob guys find him take him to a garage Hoggins is tortured it's an entertaining well done scene. We also get a great chase scene that goes through a mall & a we get a decent fight. Just a well shot scene. Back at the mob pad Sun Quan's henchies have took Nicholas & Kim & killed Archer's friends. We get another chase scene where Archer saves Kim while a tanker of gas is getting ready to explode. Archer & A cop Tony decide to Sun Quan he has Archer's son & we get a pretty brutal finish. A lot of good action. Phillippe Martinez did a good job Ringo Lam was originally attached to direct he left after a few weeks I don't know why? But Martinez with a $14 million budget made it look like it was big budget. Jean Claude Van Damme gave  solid performance. Simon Yan was good as the villain he didn't ham it up like DeNiro, Don Johnson or Segal did in Machete. The kids didn't annoy me especially Valerie Tian she was good. Tony Schirna was ok. You could tell The Mob guys had fun with there roles. Wake Of Death was released in theaters overseas but was direct to DVD in the US & I look at movies like Predators & Mas hitt y  released this year & they get all the marketing & the buzz  & there just glorified direct to DVD clunker. You know Wake Of Death had a small budget & delivers & it got no buzz.

This one deserves it.Wow!  ""In Hell"" and now this!  Van Damme and his agent are starting to wise up when accepting scripts.  Not that these movies are going to bring back his hey-day status, but they should provide some rebounding credibility for Mr. Damme.There are a few moments of typical Damme campy moments, but for the most part, he pulls off a pretty decent performance.  There is some rather raw action scenes as well as some disturbing ones to boot.  Of course, revenge may do that to some people.It's a shame Van Damme has a list of way below par movies, because if he just had BloodSport, Timecop, Cyborg, and these two recent ones to his name, I bet he would be...well, in a better position than he has been in recent years.After watching ""In Hell"" and ""Wake of Death"" you begin to hope the industry will take another look at him.

864273,A2GUFUEIW9P6BL,B00069L0Y0,Kyle,"[3, 3]","I had first heard about this movie over at action kings about 3 or 4 months ago, and after reading about who was directing and the production company, I had little hope for this. Then the trailer came and so did the plot. Wake of Death is Van Damme's latest movie and it is good!The film takes place in LA. Van Damme plays Ben Archer who is an ex mob enforcer just quiting his job to protect his family. His wife is with the immigration and she takes in a little girl who has snuck onto a boat from China to the US. She ran away because she saw her dad kill her mother right in front of her. So Ben's wife takes her in for a week. Her dad comes to LA and is searching for her. He finds out that she is staying with this lady. He tracks the wife down and kills her brutally. Ben comes to find out what happened and from their he goes on a rampage. Im not going to get into all of the characters involved as from what I said above is the main plot of the movie.Now as to what I thought of the film. The movie itself is good. Never really slow or boring. The budget was 24 million, but it felt much more to me. This is Van Dammes best yet. His acting is great and he takes his role seriously. All of the other characters were good too! Van Dammes brother was a good actor. I would like to see him in more movies. Sure the plot is not original, but who cares, as it is still an entertaining movie. The movie is bloody throughout. There is one torture seen that is intense, and graphic. But very realistic. Yes there is a car chase, and 2 nice explosions. The explosions I loved because they were not computerized. In Wesley Snipe's latest movie ""Unstoppable"", they were computerized a little. Not in this movie they weren't and I was glad to see that.Now my ONLY complaint is a simple one. In most of the DTV's, there is always at 1 thing wrong. Something in the movie is too short and should be expanded. The finale with Vandamme should have been a little bit longer. Even 5 minutes would do it, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Wake of Death is certainly 1 of the best DTV movies I have every seen. I bought it the first chance I could.

864275,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00069L0Y0,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","Along withIn Hell, ""Wake of Death"" constitutes a short-lived period in Jean-Claude Van Damme's DTV career wherein dark, gritty drama and quasi-realism were played over high-octane action. In a way, these movies were forerunners to the darkly fantastic comeback Van Damme staged inJCVD, and they're pretty strong in their own right. I can definitely see where all of the reviews more positive than my own came from. However, I'm not entirely sold on the aforementioned trade-off: ""Wake of Death"" brings a lot of cool, stylish additions to the Van Damme formula, but does so at the expense of what I consider to be the man's strengths.The story: Ben Archer (Van Damme) is a gangster trying to break away from his degenerate lifestyle when he's forced headlong into a quest for revenge by the death of his wife, brought on by the antics of an international crime lord (Simon Yam,Election) searching for his runaway daughter.The only other film of note by director Philippe Martinez is the abysmalThe Chaos Experiment, so I was genuinely surprised by how much talent he managed to pour into this one. The attention to production detail shows, the screenplay (co-penned by a writer ofThe Invisible) packs more than a bit of drama, and even the soundtrack is noteworthy - a first in my JCVD DTV experience. There are next to none of those annoying editing montages, which pleased me to no end. Most importantly, Van Damme seems to really be in to his character: there's definite dark energy at work when Ben talks about being tired of his life and wanting out of the business, which probably touched on Van Damme's own feelings regarding his career at the time. Four years before anybody was actually noticing his acting skill, Van Damme was dramatically mopping the floor with just about every other action hero of his generation...but sadly, this came at the expense of other talent. In general, the acting in the film is good, but I was very disappointed by how little exposition Simon Yam's character was afforded. Perhaps it had to do with Yam's discomfort with the English language, but he doesn't get nearly as many scenes or lines as I would've preferred for a performer of his caliber.Though the film is built on the context of every character being a different shade of grey with no clear-cut good guys or bad guys, I didn't appreciate how generally despicable the ""good guys"" were; look no further than the interrogation scene with the drill. Additionally, the action was sort of hit & miss with me. There's a surprisingly cool motorcycle chase through a mall and an intense car chase close to the end of the movie, not to mention a couple serviceable shootouts, but the martial arts content suffers. This is particularly frustrating since the cast includes Tom Wu (Belly of the Beast), Arnold Chon (Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon), and actor/action coordinator Philip Tan (Bloodsport 2): only two of them actually get to fight, and then those brawls aren't very good. Van Damme does the minimal amount of work this time around, punching and kicking guys when necessary but preferring to use semiautomatics and the butts of shotguns. If there was at least one good punch-up to be had, my review could've easily been one star brighter, but it's not to be.Van Damme would drift between decent and forgettable flicks following this one, but I like to think that ""Wake of Death"" at least helped him keep direction: movies like this helped differentiate his DTV filmography from the far spottier Seagal and Lundgren's. At this point in his career, even a so-so vehicle like this was welcome, as it showed fans that Jean-Claude was still putting his back into his career.",3,"""The only thing you postpone in life...is death""",1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,3670,"['withIn', 'Hell', 'Wake', 'Death', 'short-lived', 'period', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'DTV', 'career', 'wherein', 'dark', 'gritty', 'drama', 'quasi-realism', 'were', 'played', 'high-octane', 'action', 'way', 'movies', 'were', 'forerunners', 'darkly', 'fantastic', 'comeback', 'Van', 'Damme', 'staged', 'inJCVD', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'strong', 'own', 'right', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'where', 'reviews', 'more', 'positive', 'own', 'came', 'However', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sold', 'aforementioned', 'trade-off', 'Wake', 'Death', 'lot', 'cool', 'stylish', 'additions', 'Van', 'Damme', 'formula', 'so', 'expense', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'man', 'strengths.The', 'story', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'Van', 'Damme', 'gangster', 'trying', 'break', 'away', 'degenerate', 'lifestyle', 'when', 'forced', 'headlong', 'quest', 'revenge', 'death', 'wife', 'brought', 'antics', 'international', 'crime', 'lord', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'Election', 'searching', 'runaway', 'daughter.The', 'only', 'other', 'film', 'note', 'director', 'Philippe', 'Martinez', 'abysmalThe', 'Chaos', 'Experiment', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'talent', 'managed', 'pour', 'one', 'attention', 'production', 'detail', 'shows', 'screenplay', 'co-penned', 'writer', 'ofThe', 'Invisible', 'more', 'bit', 'drama', 'even', 'soundtrack', 'noteworthy', 'first', 'JCVD', 'DTV', 'experience', 'are', 'next', 'none', 'annoying', 'editing', 'montages', 'pleased', 'end', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Van', 'Damme', 'really', 'be', 'character', 'definite', 'dark', 'energy', 'work', 'when', 'Ben', 'being', 'tired', 'life', 'wanting', 'business', 'probably', 'touched', 'Van', 'Damme', 'own', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'career', 'time', 'Four', 'years', 'anybody', 'was', 'actually', 'noticing', 'acting', 'skill', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'dramatically', 'mopping', 'floor', 'just', 'other', 'action', 'hero', 'generation', 'sadly', 'came', 'expense', 'other', 'talent', 'general', 'acting', 'film', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'exposition', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'character', 'was', 'afforded', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'do', 'Yam', 'discomfort', 'English', 'language', ""n't"", 'get', 'nearly', 'as', 'many', 'scenes', 'lines', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'performer', 'caliber.Though', 'film', 'built', 'context', 'character', 'being', 'different', 'shade', 'grey', 'clear-cut', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'how', 'generally', 'despicable', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'look', 'further', 'interrogation', 'scene', 'drill', 'Additionally', 'action', 'was', 'sort', 'hit', 'miss', 'surprisingly', 'cool', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'mall', 'intense', 'car', 'chase', 'close', 'end', 'movie', 'not', 'mention', 'couple', 'serviceable', 'shootouts', 'martial', 'arts', 'content', 'suffers', 'particularly', 'frustrating', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Wu', 'Belly', 'Beast', 'Arnold', 'Chon', 'Max', 'Havoc', 'Curse', 'Dragon', 'actor/action', 'coordinator', 'Philip', 'Tan', 'Bloodsport', '2', 'only', 'two', 'actually', 'get', 'fight', 'then', 'brawls', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Van', 'Damme', 'minimal', 'amount', 'work', 'time', 'around', 'punching', 'kicking', 'guys', 'when', 'necessary', 'preferring', 'use', 'semiautomatics', 'butts', 'shotguns', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'good', 'punch-up', 'be', 'had', 'review', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'been', 'one', 'star', 'brighter', 'not', 'be.Van', 'Damme', 'would', 'drift', 'decent', 'forgettable', 'flicks', 'following', 'one', 'like', 'think', 'Wake', 'Death', 'least', 'helped', 'keep', 'direction', 'movies', 'helped', 'differentiate', 'DTV', 'filmography', 'far', 'spottier', 'Seagal', 'Lundgren', 'point', 'career', 'even', 'so-so', 'vehicle', 'was', 'welcome', 'showed', 'fans', 'Jean-Claude', 'was', 'still', 'putting', 'back', 'career']",N/A

Van Damme's performance rises far above the short comings of this averagely scripted revenge movie. His character develops into a cold and calculating assassin, not afraid to take a life in cold blood in the name of revenge. There is little of Van Damme's trade mark flashy martial sequences some fans of his may expect from a Van Damme movie. Instead, the movie lends itself more towards sporadic claustrophobic fight sequences and gun play. For the finale of the movie much of the martial arts duties fall to actor Tony Schiena who is top lining Bauer Martinez Studios next action movie release, Action Star. The violence is graphic in places and feels a little strange while watching it unfold when your normal diet of so called action movie's these day's have PG-13 ratings and Seagal has gone soft. The only major problem I had with Wake Of Death was in the performances from the actress playing Van Damme's wife and the actor playing her boss which were both very poor and not very convincing at times. Phileppe Martinez direction is spot on and draws a great performance from Van Damme matching anything he has done with Ringo Lam in the past. Van Damme has now buried the dreaded Derailed and I look forward to good things to come with Kumite and hopefully a further Phileppe Martinez movie, Cover Play.

director),the film at times has a film noir look to it and along with the sharp editing and solid acting throughout,it makes this film hard to turn away from.The plot involves one Ben Archer(Van Damme)who is a mobster.He is tired and wants out of the organization,much to the chagrin of his boss and compatriots.In Hong Kong a young girl witnesses the death of her mother by the hands of her father who is a gangland boss there.She flees to the U.S.in a boat with other refugees,where Van Dammes wife,an immigration officer,takes her temporarily into her custody and brings her home overnight.The next day Archers wife visits her parents food establishment in Chinatown with the young girl in tow,along with the Archers only son.The girl`s father has been anxiously looking for his wayward daughter(being the only witness to the murder)and he and his men track her down and burst into the restaurant.All are murdered except for the children who miraculously escape and run to Ben`s bosses`home and safety.Ben comes upon the scene,has a brief shootout with the remaining gang members and upon discovering the gruesome scene in the restaurant,is beside himself with grief.With the help of a fellow mobster they seek out the culprits Archer spotted leaving the murder scene,at a Chinese brothel.Archer takes out his revenge and they leave.Back at the mobster`s home a policeman comes calling asking about the hit.Of course the group is mum but he gives them all a tip.Archer`s wife`s immigration boss,has been showing up in unexpected places,specifically at the site of Archers hit.He leaves and Archer and the rest spring into action capturing and returning the immigration boss to their digs for questioning.At first their captive is unresponsive but one of them is all too handy with a drill and a rather long drill-bit,and he is soon singing like a canary.Ben receives a call from the cop who gave them the heads up on the immigration boss and asks him to come to the morgue,as they are pulling heroin bags out of dead bodies.While he is gone the Chinese  mob moves in to kill Archer`s friends.At the morgue there is chaos as the evidence has been removed by the Chinese bosses` men.Archer chases after them and after a harrowing time manages to save the young Chinese girl.However they have taken Archers only son and now he must confront the Chinese boss,save his son and take him down...if possible.The location is aboard a ship at the docks and things start out white hot as Archer sends his car exploding into some of the bosses men guarding the ship.He boards the vessel and it is a steady grind to take out each foe and get to his son.Finally the boss,with a knife at his sons throat,confronts Archer;both at either end of a gangway.It is high noon at night as the intensity is so palpable you can cut it with a knife.The bosses daughter comes running from down below yelling at her father.He briefly looks down then up and into into Archers eyes,then they both simultaneously fire a shot;with both going down.The boss is killed but Archer is also badly wounded.Barely hanging on,his precious sons flies into his arms and the nightmare is finally over.After viewing the film you can see just how much Van Damme has matured as an actor.He absolutely nails his emotional moments and he really feels the character he plays in this one.This film never lets the intensity drop one bit throughout and with Martinez` great directing hand,the pace never slows.Film noir is evident throughout with close ups and slow motion scenery to enhance the particular moment on hand and to give it more depth and impact.Watch for veteran film actor Burt Kwouk as Van Dammes wifes`father,in too short a role.Technically speaking this film is clear and crisp and in its original aspect ratio of 1:78:1.Extras include a 10 and one half minute featurette on the making of the film and the trailer.All in all a very fine Van Damme film with some of the karate moves you have come to expect from JCVD,along with a high adrenaline,heavy action laden film that is intense from the first frame to the last.Highly recommended.",4,Intense and lots of Van

His costars arent too shabby either.I have reviewed some of Van Damme's more recent films including "" In Hell""and one of my all time favorites from Van Damn ""Until Death"". The difference maker in his latest films is a creative director and producer who focus on believable characters that show vulnerability and human weakness that we all have to some extend in real life. In turn, the audience can relate to Van Damme's character in these movies because they are not ""super human"" and ""far fetched"" like the boring and repetitive Steven Seagal characters.Let me say that I think Steven Seagal is a wonderful person in real life who participates in various charities. On the other hand, he needs to show more weaknesses and not be afraid to change his looks in his movies, IE: grow a beard or even wear some glasses for at least an hour of the movie.Now, Van Damme isn't afraid to be ""un-attractive"" or even ""un-likable"" in his movies. That is the hallmark of a great actor.I notice that many of the A list Hollywood actors ""overact"" their roles and yet, they manage to get nominated for starring in boring movies.Van Damme delivers another excellent performance in this dark thriller without over acting.I rate this movie 5 stars-",5,Underrated actor-Van Damme Shines Again!!,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,1500,"['look', 'character', 'reactions', 'family', 'deaths', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'Amazing', 'stage', 'presence', 'underlying', 'dark', 'yet', 'courageous', 'feel', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character.Once', 'again', 'Van', 'Damme', 'powerful', 'tear', 'jerking', 'performance', 'over-acting', 'role', 'costars', 'arent', 'too', 'shabby', 'either.I', 'have', 'reviewed', 'Van', 'Damme', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'including', 'Hell', 'one', 'time', 'Van', 'Damn', 'Death', 'difference', 'maker', 'latest', 'films', 'creative', 'director', 'producer', 'who', 'focus', 'believable', 'characters', 'show', 'vulnerability', 'human', 'weakness', 'have', 'extend', 'real', 'life', 'turn', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'super', 'human', 'far', 'fetched', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'characters.Let', 'say', 'think', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'wonderful', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'various', 'charities', 'other', 'hand', 'show', 'more', 'weaknesses', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'change', 'looks', 'movies', 'IE', 'grow', 'beard', 'even', 'wear', 'glasses', 'least', 'hour', 'movie.Now', 'Van', 'Damme', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'be', 'un-attractive', 'even', 'un-likable', 'movies', 'hallmark', 'great', 'actor.I', 'notice', 'many', 'A', 'list', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'overact', 'roles', 'yet', 'manage', 'get', 'nominated', 'starring', 'boring', 'movies.Van', 'Damme', 'excellent', 'performance', 'dark', 'thriller', 'acting.I', 'rate', 'movie', '5', 'stars-']",N/A

We don't quite know what is going on or why at this short point in time.  We DO know that the film cuts from one shot to the next VERY quickly which makes seeing and comprehending what's going on even more difficult.  This pre-title sequence ends with Van Damme walking up to two corpses in a what looks like a morgue and then...the title song and credits roll.This fast-cut confusion made me very worried that I was in for a disaster of a straight to DVD movie.  Fortunately, I was wrong.  Everything climbed uphill from there and eventually even that opening was brought back full circle, into context, and the entire film managed to make sense.  There are flaws to be sure, most notably that the villain Simon Yam (a great Hong Kong action star) has a terrible English speaking voice, too high-pitched and thickly accented to be commanding (though he is commanding when silent).  Other flaws include lack of character development (why is the villain so cold and why is Van Damme in the business he's in?) and minor quibbles like Van Damme's wife, an INS official, questioning a Chinese refugee in english when she herself speaks Chinese.  There's also some dark lighting and quick editing that make it hard to see every detail of the action scenes, but...These flaws, however, are outshone by a gritty performance by Van Damme (a better actor than anyone gives him credit for), some truly exciting stunt sequences (there's a great motorcycle jump in a mall), and suspenseful direction that will make you sweat (drills, guns, and a switchblade, oh my!), and some that will make you jump (Van Damme and a window is all I will say).Overall, WAKE OF DEATH is a success for Van Damme.  He gets to show off his dramatic acting side in this one as well as his trademark naked backside which he likes to show off in almost every movie he makes.  Oh, and for those of you who like to see him kick people...he does that a few times as well!",3,"Part action/revenge, part gangster/drama=Good Van Damme!!!",1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,2055,"['WAKE', 'OF', 'DEATH', 'somewhat', 'confusingly', 'middle', 'car', 'chase', 'Van', 'Damme', 'car', 'bash', 'eachother', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'why', 'short', 'point', 'time', 'DO', 'know', 'film', 'cuts', 'one', 'shot', 'next', 'VERY', 'quickly', 'seeing', 'comprehending', 'what', 'going', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'pre-title', 'sequence', 'Van', 'Damme', 'walking', 'up', 'two', 'corpses', 'what', 'morgue', 'then', 'title', 'song', 'credits', 'roll.This', 'fast-cut', 'confusion', 'made', 'very', 'worried', 'was', 'disaster', 'straight', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'wrong', 'Everything', 'climbed', 'uphill', 'eventually', 'even', 'opening', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'full', 'circle', 'context', 'entire', 'film', 'managed', 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'flaws', 'be', 'sure', 'most', 'notably', 'villain', 'Simon', 'Yam', 'great', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'star', 'terrible', 'English', 'speaking', 'voice', 'too', 'high-pitched', 'thickly', 'accented', 'be', 'commanding', 'commanding', 'when', 'silent', 'Other', 'flaws', 'include', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'why', 'villain', 'so', 'cold', 'why', 'Van', 'Damme', 'business', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'Van', 'Damme', 'wife', 'INS', 'official', 'questioning', 'Chinese', 'refugee', 'english', 'when', 'Chinese', 'also', 'dark', 'lighting', 'quick', 'editing', 'make', 'hard', 'see', 'detail', 'action', 'scenes', 'flaws', 'however', 'are', 'outshone', 'gritty', 'performance', 'Van', 'Damme', 'better', 'actor', 'anyone', 'credit', 'truly', 'exciting', 'stunt', 'sequences', 'great', 'motorcycle', 'jump', 'mall', 'suspenseful', 'direction', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'drills', 'guns', 'switchblade', 'oh', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'Van', 'Damme', 'window', 'will', 'say', '.Overall', 'WAKE', 'OF', 'DEATH', 'success', 'Van', 'Damme', 'show', 'off', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'side', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'trademark', 'naked', 'backside', 'show', 'off', 'almost', 'movie', 'Oh', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'kick', 'people', 'few', 'times', 'as', 'well']",N/A
864288,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00069L0Y0,Tsuyoshi,"[13, 19]","The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents.  Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years.  But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life.Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China.  And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2').  And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room.[TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently.  'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases.  Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos.  These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.'So how good is this film?  It depends on your expectaions.  'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious.  My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.'  But it's just my idea.  The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed.  The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing.  (Case in point.  You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.)  But  most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall.  I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story.Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director.  (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb  says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!)  As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America.Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back.  I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.'  'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.",2,(2.5 Stars) His Best in Years But Still Needs Something More,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,3093,"['title', ""'Wake"", 'Death', 'new', 'film', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'rightly', 'given', 'very', 'violent', 'contents', 'Van', 'Damme', 'bouncer', 'Ben', 'Archer', 'who', 'quitting', 'job', 'seeing', 'what', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', '20', 'years', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Cynthia', 'Lisa', 'King', ""'Home"", 'Alone', '4', 'kid', 'home', 'just', 'quiet', 'life.Anyone', 'who', 'rules', 'action', 'flicks', 'will', 'detect', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'family', 'when', 'kind-hearted', 'Cynthia', 'who', 'INS', 'officer', 'way', 'home', 'little', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'found', 'refugees', 'China', 'little', 'girl', 'connected', 'Chinese', 'triad', 'fact', 'daughter', 'ruthless', 'Sun', 'Quan', 'Simon', 'Yam', ""'Tomb"", 'Raider', '2', 'events', 'occur', 'night', 'when', 'Cynthia', 'Ben', 'are', 'sleeping', 'together', 'bed', 'showing', 'part', 'bodies', 'ill-lit', 'room', '[', 'TYPICAL', 'REVENGE', 'STORY', ']', 'Yes', 'Van', 'Damme', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'serious', 'days', 'have', 'seen', ""'In"", 'Hell', 'recently', ""'Wake"", 'Death', 'similar', 'course', 'time', 'revenge', 'story', 'more', 'violent', 'actions', 'shoot-outs', 'car-chases', 'script', 'standard', 'one', 'one', 'inventiveness', 'found', 'relations', 'Van', 'Damme', 'hero', 'former', 'associates', 'French', 'mafiosos', 'French', 'gangsters', 'give', 'timely', 'help', 'two', 'Van', 'Damme', 'character', 'more', 'bloody', 'fashion', 'Italian', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'seen', 'helping', 'Arnie', ""'Eraser"", ""'So"", 'how', 'good', 'film', 'expectaions', ""'Wake"", 'Death', 'shows', 'fairly', 'good', 'car', 'stunts', 'shoot-outs', 'lack', 'imagination', 'director', 'side', 'too', 'obvious', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', ""'Derailed"", 'worst', 'far', ""'Timecop"", 'arguably', 'best', 'par', ""'The"", 'Order', 'just', 'idea', 'point', 'Van', 'Damme', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'here', 'actions', 'logics', 'look', 'awfully', 'disjointed', 'bad', 'guy', 'motive', 'bring', 'back', 'daughter', 'cost', 'never', 'explained', 'relations', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'confusing', 'Case', 'point', 'get', 'glimpse', 'two', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Burt', 'Kwouk', ""'Cato"", ""'Rerurn"", 'Pink', 'Panther', 'Jacqui', 'Chan', ""'The"", 'World', 'Susie', 'Wong', 'moment', 'appear', 'screen', 'get', 'killed', 'leaving', 'impression', 'most', 'damaging', 'thing', 'film', 'shoddy', 'editing', 'virtually', 'killed', 'good', 'stunts', 'such', 'two', 'motorcycles', 'running', 'shoppoing', 'mall', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'certain', 'point', 'story.Philip', 'Martinez', 'formerly', 'producer', 'B', 'action', 'films', 'such', ""'Dot"", 'Kill', ""'House"", '9', 'second', 'film', 'director', 'Incidentally', 'first', 'feature', 'was', 'imdb', 'Verdict', '03', 'starring', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'Jerry', 'Springer', ""'Wake"", 'Death', 'decided', 'shoot', 'film', 'South', 'Africa', 'story', 'set', 'America.Fans', 'Van', 'Damme', 'might', 'hail', 'film', 'come-back', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'still', 'fondly', 'remember', 'joyful', 'thrills', 'when', 'watched', ""'Timecop"", 'Soldiers', ""'Wake"", 'Death', 'good', 'Grade-B', 'straight-to-video', 'actioner', 'not', 'good', 'enough']",N/A
