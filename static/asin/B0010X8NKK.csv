Now it is not uncommon to see humans, gods (human like with elven ears), and demons (human like with ears like Ryoko of Tenchi fame) living, working, and going to school together.  Ren is your typical high school boy with an unusual problem, he lives with the schools most beautiful and intelligent girl (Kaede) because his parents and her mom died in an accident and the other guys are very jealous forming the Knights for Kissing Kaede, or the KKK (no relation to the other version).  Then two new girls are transferred to the school, Sia and Rin.  Sia is a god and Rin is a demon and both of their fathers are the Kings of their respected realms.  And both are in love with Ren, which of course makes the rest of the male population even MORE upset.  Throw in Aya, another human who has known Ren as long as Kaede and Padoma, a demon girl who is attached to Rin and therefore also attached to Ren, and his best friend who is a bit of a womanizer and you have the main cast of characters.  So you have one guy, five girls, and a couple of ultra powerful fathers, and one very difficult choice you get a very entertaining storyline....WHO WOULD YOU PICK????This disk was entertaining from the get go.  The dubbing is great and story gets you hooked right from the start.  Watching the fathers get out of trouble with the teacher in episode one and four is great and seeing Sia club her father when he gets out of hand is worth watching.  see you next disk",5,choices......choices,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,1545,"['been', '10', 'years', 'gates', 'heavens', 'underworld', 'opened', 'Now', 'not', 'uncommon', 'see', 'humans', 'gods', 'human', 'elven', 'ears', 'demons', 'human', 'ears', 'Ryoko', 'Tenchi', 'fame', 'living', 'working', 'going', 'school', 'together', 'Ren', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'unusual', 'problem', 'schools', 'most', 'beautiful', 'intelligent', 'girl', 'Kaede', 'parents', 'mom', 'died', 'accident', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'jealous', 'forming', 'Knights', 'Kissing', 'Kaede', 'KKK', 'relation', 'other', 'version', 'Then', 'two', 'new', 'girls', 'are', 'transferred', 'school', 'Sia', 'Rin', 'Sia', 'god', 'Rin', 'demon', 'fathers', 'are', 'Kings', 'respected', 'realms', 'are', 'love', 'Ren', 'course', 'rest', 'male', 'population', 'even', 'MORE', 'upset', 'Throw', 'Aya', 'human', 'who', 'known', 'Ren', 'as', 'long', 'Kaede', 'Padoma', 'demon', 'girl', 'who', 'attached', 'Rin', 'therefore', 'also', 'attached', 'Ren', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'bit', 'womanizer', 'have', 'main', 'cast', 'characters', 'So', 'have', 'one', 'guy', 'five', 'girls', 'couple', 'ultra', 'powerful', 'fathers', 'one', 'very', 'difficult', 'choice', 'get', 'very', 'entertaining', 'storyline', '.WHO', 'WOULD', 'YOU', 'PICK', 'disk', 'was', 'entertaining', 'get', 'go', 'dubbing', 'great', 'story', 'hooked', 'right', 'start', 'Watching', 'fathers', 'get', 'trouble', 'teacher', 'one', 'four', 'great', 'seeing', 'Sia', 'club', 'father', 'when', 'hand', 'worth', 'watching', 'see', 'next', 'disk']","Shuffle, Vol. 1"

1127635,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B0010X8NKK,maskedgamer,"[1, 1]","The beginning episodes are very goofy and light hearted. They are meant to be fun and believe me far from reality. This is an anime when girls actually fall for the ""nice guy"" and as we all know ""nice guys"" are not the type of men that women chase after. The main character Rin is as nice as they come, and for the most part is lacks qualities that most women would find attactive. He is indecisive,cowardly, easily manipulated, affraid of hurting others feelings so he alows himself to get manipulated. He is too sensitive, He doesn't stick up for himself, and is always apologizing for everything that upsets anyone. He is ideally what women do not want. However, in this Anime this nice guy ""Rin"" finished first. He has his pick of the litter and just about every girl wants him.The anime really plays around with this concept and for the most part is is very entertaining. Sometime however it is a bit disgusting. Especially with the Primula character who is supposed to be a young girl, but most of the time is placed at the center of sex jokes, which really is kind of disturbing considering she really is an innocent childlike character in the Anime. I didn't really find those parts funny or sexy...mostly just strange and made me question if I wanted to see the other episodes. One I saw that the first Volume was just fun and games, I was in for a shocker when I got deeper into the anime. You get to take a closer look into the lives of the girls and get to see that Beauty is only skin deep and not everything is what is seems. Each of the girls have their skeletons, and we get a chance to meet them all.This part of the Anime is what made it very real and extremely realistic, no matter how over the top the Anime was at times. In earlier episodes we watch these beautiful girls fight over Rin but then we get to see each of their real flaws,and who they truly were. We learn that some of them have serious problems from low selfesteem, to regret, to shame, to the downright phsychotic. Just like in real life dating and meeting women, no matter how beatiful they are, they all have their problems. Things aren't always as they seem, and this pretty much is the same note the rest of the series takes off on. I liked watching the anime, but like I said I wouldn't break my neck to watch it. The character of Rin, and his uncanny ability to attract so many females with his many flaws just always seemed like a downer to this Anime. Had he been designed as a more believable character with traits that you could imagine in the slightest bit seeing women being attracted to this anime may have been better, but it just didn't hit it off for me.",3,"Worth watching but, I wouldn't go out my way to see it.",1236470400,"03 8, 2009",2009,2656,"['beginning', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'goofy', 'light', 'hearted', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'believe', 'far', 'reality', 'anime', 'when', 'girls', 'actually', 'fall', 'nice', 'guy', 'know', 'nice', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'type', 'men', 'women', 'chase', 'main', 'character', 'Rin', 'as', 'nice', 'come', 'most', 'part', 'lacks', 'qualities', 'most', 'women', 'would', 'find', 'attactive', 'indecisive', 'cowardly', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'affraid', 'hurting', 'others', 'feelings', 'so', 'get', 'manipulated', 'too', 'sensitive', ""n't"", 'stick', 'up', 'always', 'apologizing', 'everything', 'anyone', 'ideally', 'what', 'women', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'However', 'Anime', 'nice', 'guy', 'Rin', 'finished', 'first', 'pick', 'litter', 'just', 'girl', 'him.The', 'anime', 'really', 'concept', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Sometime', 'however', 'bit', 'disgusting', 'Especially', 'Primula', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'girl', 'most', 'time', 'placed', 'center', 'sex', 'jokes', 'really', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'considering', 'really', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'character', 'Anime', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'parts', 'funny', 'sexy', 'mostly', 'just', 'strange', 'made', 'question', 'wanted', 'see', 'other', 'episodes', 'One', 'saw', 'first', 'Volume', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'games', 'was', 'shocker', 'when', 'got', 'deeper', 'anime', 'get', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'lives', 'girls', 'get', 'see', 'Beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'not', 'everything', 'what', 'girls', 'have', 'skeletons', 'get', 'chance', 'meet', 'all.This', 'part', 'Anime', 'what', 'made', 'very', 'real', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'matter', 'how', 'top', 'Anime', 'was', 'times', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'fight', 'Rin', 'then', 'get', 'see', 'real', 'flaws', 'who', 'truly', 'were', 'learn', 'have', 'serious', 'problems', 'low', 'selfesteem', 'regret', 'shame', 'downright', 'phsychotic', 'Just', 'real', 'life', 'dating', 'meeting', 'women', 'matter', 'how', 'beatiful', 'are', 'have', 'problems', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'seem', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'note', 'rest', 'series', 'liked', 'watching', 'anime', 'said', 'would', ""n't"", 'break', 'neck', 'watch', 'character', 'Rin', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'attract', 'so', 'many', 'females', 'many', 'flaws', 'just', 'always', 'seemed', 'downer', 'Anime', 'Had', 'been', 'designed', 'more', 'believable', 'character', 'traits', 'could', 'imagine', 'slightest', 'bit', 'seeing', 'women', 'being', 'attracted', 'anime', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'off']","Shuffle, Vol. 1"
1127636,A2HNB7J7QQ090E,B0010X8NKK,Peter Parker,"[0, 0]","If you are relatively new to anime and appreciate what are termed school harem shows, you will enjoy Shuffle!, as it is one of the best of this genre to come along in years.  On the other hand, if you are an anime veteran (years of avid fandom), you might see this story as cliche and formulaic, since many of the individual setups and gags have been done before.  However, I would suggest Shuffle! to any fan of harem or school drama for the aspects that are unique as well as it being a well-told story.Seasoned harem fans will compare it to Love Hina and Girls Bravo, and a long list of Urusei Yatsura and Tenchi imitators, but Shuffle!'s early comedic focus serves primarily to endear you to the characters and provide lighthearted, if stock, entertainment.  This mood won't last, however, as it begins to resemble more straight school dramas like Da Capo, To Heart, Canvas and more recently Clannad.  In fact, Shuffle! veers further toward melodrama than would seem appropriate given its initial chapters, but along with its fantasy/sci-fi elements, thus provides a deeper experience.Shuffle!, along with most modern harem anime series, is an adaptation of  text-based games called visual novels in Japan, the most popular type being dating simulation games (Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the second half of January 2004 in Japan).  The player is more or less surrounded by beautiful girls matching various standard character types and works toward developing a romantic relationship with each one of the characters in turn.  These game adaptations are definitely hit-and-miss, since most of the self-paced games provide little to the animation producer beyond characters and story concepts.  Note that the lead character, the male protagonist, must always be an original creation since in the game this is the player, who obviously is not one of the characters.  Fortunately, Shuffle! was directed by Naoto Hosoda, a veteran of Boogiepop Phantom, R.O.D. the TV, Utawarerumono, DearS and several other highly successful anime series.But Shuffle exceeds those low expectations and becomes a worthy series that stands on its own.  The creators rapidly set the stage, drawing the viewer into its somewhat zany universe of humans, demons and gods without wasting time.  The pacing and editing are excellent, the music and sound are superior to most such series, and the animation is on par with all but the highest quality anime.  While hardcore anime fans will recognize similarities to well-worn character archetypes amongst the girls, each is written with sufficient depth to make them unique, interesting and attractive to all but the most jaded viewer.  The plot is continually engaging, and the characters all change and grow in often dramatic and unpredicted ways.Maybe most significantly for genre fans, Rin Tsuchimi, the male protagonist is a well-written, complex character deserving of the attention garnered from the girls; far different from the wimpy, irritatingly clueless and introverted male leads typical of standard harem shows (think the absolute opposite of Yukinari in Girls Bravo).If you like harem series, Shuffle! is one of those worth buying, because you will watch it more than once in the coming years.  Out of the 100 or so new animated TV series produced every year in Japan, generally only 5 or 6 merit the cost of purchase on DVD in the U.S. by non-collectors, though many more are licensed and released here.  For the hardcore harem fan, Shuffle! is a required purchase.  For the casual anime fan, especially new fans looking to expand their library with quality titles that represent good animated story-telling in the context of modern Japanese culture, Shuffle! is certainly worth the investment.",4,Worthy of Any Fan Shelf,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,3761,"['are', 'relatively', 'new', 'anime', 'appreciate', 'what', 'are', 'termed', 'school', 'harem', 'shows', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Shuffle', 'one', 'best', 'genre', 'come', 'along', 'years', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'anime', 'veteran', 'years', 'avid', 'fandom', 'might', 'see', 'story', 'cliche', 'formulaic', 'many', 'individual', 'setups', 'gags', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'However', 'would', 'suggest', 'Shuffle', 'fan', 'harem', 'school', 'drama', 'aspects', 'are', 'unique', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'well-told', 'story.Seasoned', 'harem', 'fans', 'will', 'compare', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Girls', 'Bravo', 'long', 'list', 'Urusei', 'Yatsura', 'Tenchi', 'imitators', 'Shuffle', 'early', 'comedic', 'focus', 'serves', 'primarily', 'endear', 'characters', 'provide', 'lighthearted', 'stock', 'entertainment', 'mood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'however', 'resemble', 'more', 'straight', 'school', 'dramas', 'Da', 'Capo', 'Heart', 'Canvas', 'more', 'recently', 'Clannad', 'fact', 'Shuffle', 'veers', 'further', 'melodrama', 'would', 'seem', 'appropriate', 'given', 'initial', 'chapters', 'fantasy/sci-fi', 'elements', 'thus', 'deeper', 'experience.Shuffle', 'most', 'modern', 'harem', 'anime', 'series', 'adaptation', 'text-based', 'games', 'called', 'visual', 'novels', 'Japan', 'most', 'popular', 'type', 'being', 'dating', 'simulation', 'games', 'Shuffle', 'was', 'second', 'highest-selling', 'computer', 'game', 'second', 'half', 'January', '2004', 'Japan', 'player', 'more', 'less', 'surrounded', 'beautiful', 'girls', 'matching', 'various', 'standard', 'character', 'types', 'developing', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'one', 'characters', 'turn', 'game', 'adaptations', 'are', 'definitely', 'hit-and-miss', 'most', 'self-paced', 'games', 'provide', 'little', 'animation', 'producer', 'characters', 'story', 'concepts', 'Note', 'lead', 'character', 'male', 'protagonist', 'must', 'always', 'be', 'original', 'creation', 'game', 'player', 'who', 'obviously', 'not', 'one', 'characters', 'Fortunately', 'Shuffle', 'was', 'directed', 'Naoto', 'Hosoda', 'veteran', 'Boogiepop', 'Phantom', 'R.O.D', 'TV', 'Utawarerumono', 'DearS', 'several', 'other', 'highly', 'successful', 'anime', 'series.But', 'Shuffle', 'low', 'expectations', 'worthy', 'series', 'own', 'creators', 'rapidly', 'set', 'stage', 'drawing', 'viewer', 'somewhat', 'zany', 'universe', 'humans', 'demons', 'gods', 'wasting', 'time', 'pacing', 'editing', 'are', 'excellent', 'music', 'sound', 'are', 'superior', 'most', 'such', 'series', 'animation', 'par', 'highest', 'quality', 'anime', 'hardcore', 'anime', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'similarities', 'well-worn', 'character', 'archetypes', 'amongst', 'girls', 'written', 'sufficient', 'depth', 'make', 'unique', 'interesting', 'attractive', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewer', 'plot', 'continually', 'engaging', 'characters', 'change', 'grow', 'often', 'dramatic', 'unpredicted', 'ways.Maybe', 'most', 'significantly', 'genre', 'fans', 'Rin', 'Tsuchimi', 'male', 'protagonist', 'well-written', 'complex', 'character', 'deserving', 'attention', 'garnered', 'girls', 'far', 'different', 'wimpy', 'irritatingly', 'clueless', 'introverted', 'male', 'typical', 'standard', 'harem', 'shows', 'think', 'absolute', 'opposite', 'Yukinari', 'Girls', 'Bravo', '.If', 'harem', 'series', 'Shuffle', 'one', 'worth', 'buying', 'will', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'coming', 'years', '100', 'so', 'new', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'produced', 'year', 'Japan', 'generally', 'only', '5', '6', 'merit', 'cost', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'non-collectors', 'though', 'many', 'more', 'are', 'licensed', 'released', 'here', 'hardcore', 'harem', 'fan', 'Shuffle', 'required', 'purchase', 'casual', 'anime', 'fan', 'especially', 'new', 'fans', 'looking', 'expand', 'library', 'quality', 'titles', 'represent', 'good', 'animated', 'story-telling', 'context', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Shuffle', 'certainly', 'investment']","Shuffle, Vol. 1"
