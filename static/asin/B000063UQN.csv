695942,A2QMRHJOWJSDOQ,B000063UQN,"Clark Paull ""(Sleepin' with the TV on)""","[61, 64]","It's with a heavy heart that I sit here and try to put into words what The Clash's music has meant to me ever since I bought an import 7"" of ""White Riot"" b/w ""1977"" back in, uh, 1977, so at the risk of being accused of playing I-was-a-punk-before-you-were-a-punk, let's concentrate on this amazing documentary put together by ex-DJ Don Letts, punk rock insider and the man who purportedly introduced the London punk scene to dub.  This past Christmas, I was dragged kicking and screaming into the DVD age with the purchase of a DVD player and this, my first DVD.  Letts unveils a plethora of crystal-clear live footage, none of which I even knew existed, and most of which looks like it was shot yesterday.  Thankfully, the majority of said footage concentrates on the band pre-""Combat Rock,"" before they began to lose the plot and while they really were The Only Band That Mattered.  Weaving the live material with band interviews that are actually interesting and compelling (what a concept!), Letts tells the story of a bunch of regular Joes (no pun intended) that on any given night, might well have been the best damn band on the planet and a group of guys many of the naive among us (myself included) felt were going to change the world. The interviews reveal Joe Strummer to be, not surprisingly, the master storyteller in the group, Paul Simonon to be not as quiet as many of us thought, Mick Jones to have dental work rivalling that of Mike Meyers as Austin Powers, and, sadly, Topper Headon as a mere shadow of his former self, barely intelligible most of the time.  Bonus features include a Letts-shot featurette, ""The Clash On Broadway,"" additional interview footage, photos, a discography and many other things I'm still too technically inept to describe with any degree of accuracy.  If you're looking for a testimonial as to why you should shell out the long green for this DVD, all I can say is that the first time I watched it, I never moved once and I'm not even sure I remembered to breathe.  Highly recommended for not only Clash fans, but music lovers in general, and a glowing testimonial to the beautiful noise made by a bunch of ragged louts with guitars and amplifiers and how that noise can change the lives of so many.",5,Rest In Peace Sweet Prince...,1041984000,"01 8, 2003",2003,2245,"['heavy', 'heart', 'sit', 'here', 'try', 'put', 'words', 'what', 'Clash', 'music', 'meant', 'ever', 'bought', 'import', '7', 'White', 'Riot', 'b/w', '1977', 'back', 'uh', '1977', 'so', 'risk', 'being', 'accused', 'playing', 'I-was-a-punk-before-you-were-a-punk', 'let', 'concentrate', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'put', 'together', 'ex-DJ', 'Don', 'Letts', 'punk', 'rock', 'insider', 'man', 'who', 'purportedly', 'introduced', 'London', 'punk', 'scene', 'dub', 'past', 'Christmas', 'was', 'dragged', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'DVD', 'age', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'player', 'first', 'DVD', 'Letts', 'plethora', 'crystal-clear', 'live', 'footage', 'none', 'even', 'knew', 'existed', 'most', 'was', 'shot', 'yesterday', 'Thankfully', 'majority', 'said', 'footage', 'concentrates', 'band', 'pre-', 'Combat', 'Rock', 'began', 'lose', 'plot', 'really', 'were', 'Only', 'Band', 'That', 'Mattered', 'Weaving', 'live', 'material', 'band', 'interviews', 'are', 'actually', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'what', 'concept', 'Letts', 'story', 'bunch', 'regular', 'Joes', 'pun', 'intended', 'given', 'night', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'damn', 'band', 'planet', 'group', 'guys', 'many', 'naive', 'included', 'felt', 'were', 'going', 'change', 'world', 'interviews', 'reveal', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'be', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'master', 'storyteller', 'group', 'Paul', 'Simonon', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'quiet', 'many', 'thought', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'have', 'dental', 'work', 'rivalling', 'Mike', 'Meyers', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'sadly', 'Topper', 'Headon', 'mere', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'barely', 'intelligible', 'most', 'time', 'Bonus', 'include', 'Letts-shot', 'featurette', 'Clash', 'Broadway', 'additional', 'interview', 'footage', 'photos', 'discography', 'many', 'other', 'things', ""'m"", 'still', 'too', 'technically', 'inept', 'describe', 'degree', 'accuracy', ""'re"", 'looking', 'testimonial', 'why', 'should', 'shell', 'out', 'long', 'green', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'never', 'moved', 'once', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'remembered', 'breathe', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'not', 'only', 'Clash', 'fans', 'music', 'lovers', 'general', 'glowing', 'testimonial', 'beautiful', 'noise', 'made', 'bunch', 'ragged', 'louts', 'guitars', 'amplifiers', 'how', 'noise', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'so', 'many']",N/A
695943,A3J5UO5QMTFSWB,B000063UQN,"Connoisseur Rat ""armchair experientialist""","[2, 2]","So says the ever-sagely punk rock poet Joe Strummer, the featured player in this high-quality documentary about his legendary, incendiary and influential band, The Clash.Don Letts, a one-time DJ at the band's favorite club, the Roxy (and subsequent member of Mick Jones' post-Clash project, Big Audio Dynamite), culls from his catalog of amazing archival footage and draws upon his unparalleled access to the band to show us just how the Clash rose to the be the powers they were (and, to some extent, how crushed they became).The film starts out as an almost standard, run-of-the-mill rockumentary, with two exceptions: 1) this particular rock-doc is about one of the greatest bands of all time, so the music clips, although short, are stunning.  And 2) Joe Strummer was one of the world's more interesting and compelling narrators in both thought and tone.  He's immensely quotable and the timbre and tenor of his voice would no doubt have you captured and enraptured no matter what he was commenting on.Some great stories are told about the formation of the band and the origins of songs like ""I'm So Bored With The USA,"" ""Garageland"", ""White Riot"", and ""London's Burning"".  And it's a real treat to see outtakes of the band in the studio actually recording some of their albums (the shot of Joe, with headphones on, recording the vocal for ""All The Young Punks"" sends chills down my spine).But the movie really takes off toward the end, with the descriptions of how the band began to crumble and implode.  Letts' history with the band members grants him an access much more important than mere physical access - he has an emotional intimacy with them as well, so he really gets them to open up.Thus, it is very powerful to hear Strummer's stinging yet bittersweet words about Mick Jones.  Because on one hand, he says Jones began behaving like ""Elizabeth Taylor in a filthy mood"" (ha!) and that ""punctuality wasn't one of his talents.""  But at the same time he adds: ""his was a talent worth waiting for.""  And later, he implores all would-be bands out there: ""If it works, don't mess with it - do what you have to do to bring it forward.""In watching the film's captivating conclusion, you get the sense that if just one little thing had gone differently for them (i.e. drummer Topper Headon not doing drugs, or Mick Jones having ""a little more self-control"") they might have played together for another twenty years.Such is the fine line between the powerful and the crushed, and Letts does a mostly-excellent job in showing us how this line is drawn, and what happens if it is crossed.p.s. of the 44 minutes of bonus interview footage, make sure to listen to the 11 minutes with Paul Simonon - he tells some very amusing stories with topics including (but not limited to): a night in a Scottish jail with assorted Clash fans, abusing Legs McNeil, and wearing a rabbit suit.  Actually, one of my favorite things about this film is being able to hear more from Paul, because - much as I love them - I'd already heard plenty over the years from Mick and Joe and almost nothing from Paul.  (That said, Joe tells a particularly hilarious tale of his own about stealing a mic from 200 ft above the stage of the English National Opera).",4,"""Either you became a power or you were crushed""",1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,3234,"['So', 'ever-sagely', 'punk', 'rock', 'poet', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'featured', 'player', 'high-quality', 'documentary', 'legendary', 'incendiary', 'influential', 'band', 'Clash.Don', 'Letts', 'one-time', 'DJ', 'band', 'favorite', 'club', 'Roxy', 'subsequent', 'member', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'post-Clash', 'project', 'Big', 'Audio', 'Dynamite', 'culls', 'catalog', 'amazing', 'archival', 'footage', 'unparalleled', 'access', 'band', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'Clash', 'rose', 'be', 'powers', 'were', 'extent', 'how', 'crushed', 'became', '.The', 'film', 'out', 'almost', 'standard', 'run-of-the-mill', 'rockumentary', 'two', 'exceptions', '1', 'particular', 'rock-doc', 'one', 'greatest', 'bands', 'time', 'music', 'clips', 'short', 'are', 'stunning', '2', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'more', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'narrators', 'thought', 'tone', 'immensely', 'quotable', 'timbre', 'tenor', 'voice', 'would', 'no', 'doubt', 'have', 'captured', 'enraptured', 'matter', 'what', 'was', 'commenting', 'on.Some', 'great', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'formation', 'band', 'origins', 'songs', ""'m"", 'So', 'Bored', 'USA', 'Garageland', 'White', 'Riot', 'London', 'Burning', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'outtakes', 'band', 'studio', 'actually', 'recording', 'albums', 'shot', 'Joe', 'headphones', 'recording', 'vocal', 'Young', 'Punks', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'movie', 'really', 'off', 'end', 'descriptions', 'how', 'band', 'began', 'crumble', 'implode', 'Letts', 'history', 'band', 'members', 'grants', 'access', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'mere', 'physical', 'access', 'emotional', 'intimacy', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'open', 'up.Thus', 'very', 'powerful', 'hear', 'Strummer', 'stinging', 'yet', 'bittersweet', 'words', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'one', 'hand', 'Jones', 'began', 'behaving', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'filthy', 'mood', 'ha', 'punctuality', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'talents', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'talent', 'worth', 'waiting', 'later', 'would-be', 'bands', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'bring', 'forward', 'watching', 'film', 'captivating', 'conclusion', 'get', 'sense', 'just', 'one', 'little', 'thing', 'had', 'gone', 'differently', 'i.e', 'drummer', 'Topper', 'Headon', 'not', 'doing', 'drugs', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'having', 'little', 'more', 'self-control', 'might', 'have', 'played', 'together', 'twenty', 'years.Such', 'fine', 'line', 'powerful', 'crushed', 'Letts', 'mostly-excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'line', 'drawn', 'what', 'crossed.p.s', '44', 'minutes', 'bonus', 'interview', 'footage', 'make', 'sure', 'listen', '11', 'minutes', 'Paul', 'Simonon', 'very', 'amusing', 'stories', 'topics', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'night', 'Scottish', 'jail', 'assorted', 'Clash', 'fans', 'abusing', 'Legs', 'McNeil', 'wearing', 'rabbit', 'suit', 'Actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'things', 'film', 'being', 'able', 'hear', 'more', 'Paul', 'much', 'love', ""'d"", 'already', 'heard', 'plenty', 'years', 'Mick', 'Joe', 'almost', 'nothing', 'Paul', 'said', 'Joe', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'tale', 'own', 'stealing', 'mic', '200', 'ft', 'stage', 'English', 'National', 'Opera']",N/A

What I found so intresting about this documentary was how it was able to capture The Clash for who they were; a great live band with a message. Politically speaking, every Clash fan knows how far to the left they were; this film provides us more with the attitude that they took in order for the song to be written. It is also able to capture one of Joe Strummer's last interviews.The Clash have, and will always be considered fraternal twins to The Beatles. The Marxist song-writing and their powerful delivery is probably the way John Lennon's solo career would had developed. Hell, this IS the band he wishes he was in.My hat goes off to the way this film was presented. It wasn't just a one camera ordeal but creative slides of fascinating filmmaking. All four members also spoke their truth of the band, and why it had to fall apart. This compilation is for the die hard rock fan that wants to know why rock music (or any genre) still matters. It also helps us understand why the ability to perform a song can affect so many people.

The result is a riveting documentary, sure to please Clash fans, both casual and diehard.  From their origins in mid-1970's England to their worldwide fame and breakup, it's all here.Even the backing music, during the interviews, is music by The Clash.  &quot;Guns of Brixton,&quot; &quot;Bankrobber,&quot; and other songs play behind Joe Strummer's resonant baritone as he describes the band's trials and tribulations, war stories and the stories behind the songs, and these songs sound great.  Chapters describe landmark Clash shows, from dingy clubs in their early days to Shea Stadium in NYC during the height of the popularity.Interviews with Joe Strummer yield amazing lines, which seem to put everything about music and life in perspective.  Topper Headon seems to nearly cry as he recalls his addiction and exit from the group.  Strummer's recall of an encounter with Paul Simonon (bass) and Mick Jones (guitar and vocals) in which he thought he might have to punch Mick then &quot;leg it&quot;?  HILARIOUS.  Why didn't he punch the beefier Simonon?  Paul looked quite &quot;tasty,&quot; said Joe, and we know that Strummer didn't fancy a fight with him.  I laughed so hard I almost choked on my soup.

695947,A356RFKNIG043B,B000063UQN,K. Swanson,"[1, 1]","4.5 starsThe Clash became great once they transcended their punk beginnings and started writing songs with memorable melodies. Name another punk band that turned into a singles machine. You can't, because the Clash broke the mold. Most punk bands sucked because they couldn't play, and once the anger was gone, so was the edge. The Clash had two great songwriters who were willing to grow, and who also loved reggae, country, and many other styles, so they morphed into real musicians.Hence London Calling, one of the best records of its time, and miles advanced from their first album of only two years before. The intelligence contained in that advance is clearly on display here. Now that Strummer's dead, this will be the final word on their history, and that's no shame. It's a great doc that moves a little too quick past the early successes but all the interviews are good and it's easy to see why these guys were great: they had brains and focus. Topper was the least brilliant of the mob but he was a hell of a drummer, and that was the push over the top. When he left, forget it.The Broadway film extra is also excellent.All we need now is a film that focusses entirely on '76 to '81 and forgets the rest; Combat Rock made money but their genius peaked on London Calling and to a (much) lesser extent on Sandinista. Once a punk band gets rich, things start getting painfully ironic, and fast...There's a sweet soundboard recording of a show from NYC, 6/13/81, available for free on various live music torrent sites, that shows just how musical and yet full-throttle these guys could be.

The Clash made me the person I am today.  This film is a great and enlightening tribute to their genius and influence, and really drives home the brilliance of their musicianship.

Instead of using a narrator, the story of the Clash is told mostly by Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, and Paul Simonon.  The documentary doesn't have a great deal of depth, but you get a quick overview of how the guys met, their earlier work, their influences, and their politics.  They talk about growing up on the Beatles and the Kinks and not wanting to end up playing concerts with symphonies, like Rod Stewart.They go on to cover their early concerts, writing songs, recording the albums, and the eventual dissolution of the band.  Overall you get a decent amount of information and some interesting stories.  The best aspect is watching the guys seemingly come to a few conclusions about their career right in front of the camera as they share some of their regrets.  For any fan of the Clash, this is a great source of information and a way to learn a bit more about the band.What Not to Expect:  This is not a great introduction to the Clash.  If you're not at least familiar with the band and punk rock in general, there's not much here to bring you up to speed.  You might feel a little lost.  This is really a better fit for Clash fans who would like to see some extra interviews with the band.You also shouldn't expect to see a lot of songs.  If that's what you're looking to find, go for a concert film.  There are a lot of snippets from tracks throughout their career, but no song is played in it's entirety.",4,Good For Clash Fans,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,1520,"['What', 'Can', 'Expect', 'documentary', 'fashioned', 'Beatles', 'Anthology', 'only', '9', 'hours', 'shorter', 'Instead', 'using', 'narrator', 'story', 'Clash', 'told', 'mostly', 'Joe', 'Strummer', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'Paul', 'Simonon', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'depth', 'get', 'quick', 'overview', 'how', 'guys', 'met', 'earlier', 'work', 'influences', 'politics', 'talk', 'growing', 'up', 'Beatles', 'Kinks', 'not', 'wanting', 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'concerts', 'symphonies', 'Rod', 'Stewart.They', 'go', 'cover', 'early', 'concerts', 'writing', 'songs', 'recording', 'albums', 'eventual', 'dissolution', 'band', 'get', 'decent', 'amount', 'information', 'interesting', 'stories', 'best', 'aspect', 'watching', 'guys', 'seemingly', 'come', 'few', 'conclusions', 'career', 'right', 'front', 'camera', 'share', 'regrets', 'fan', 'Clash', 'great', 'source', 'information', 'way', 'learn', 'bit', 'more', 'band.What', 'Not', 'Expect', 'not', 'great', 'introduction', 'Clash', ""'re"", 'not', 'least', 'familiar', 'band', 'punk', 'rock', 'general', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'bring', 'up', 'speed', 'might', 'feel', 'little', 'lost', 'really', 'better', 'fit', 'Clash', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'extra', 'interviews', 'band.You', 'also', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'lot', 'songs', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'find', 'go', 'concert', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'snippets', 'tracks', 'career', 'song', 'played', 'entirety']",N/A

The Clash probably stayed together two years too many (they hung up their spurs in 1985), but their peak years from 1977-1981 were well worth it. Westway captures the exuberance of the punk period into which the Clash thrust themselves in 1977, and documents their own journey up til the departure of Jones (the McCartney to Strummer's Lennon) in the early Eighties.I picked this up in the days after Joe Strummer's passing in December 2002, and I can safely say this is a fine tribute (albeit released before his untimely death). Strummer was easily the most lucid of the original punks (only John Lydon rivals him for candor and interesting insights into the era), and his interview segments are worth the price of admission alone.The other band members aren't forgotten, though, and each details his own musical background and evolution in the band. Once the film is over, you find it sad to know that 1.) the band can never truly reunite and 2.) there will never be a band that can match them for expanding the range of punk.So let the kiddies have their Avrils and their Blink-182. The Clash were the real deal, and this film captures just how damn special they really were.

I've been one since 1978, and I can't begin to tell you how much I've been wanting to get a documentary dvd on the only band that matters.  So, I was excited to see this available, as well as the other dvd that highlights their videos.  I bought both at the same time.  Westway to the World could have been so much more.  So very, very much more.  While I really liked the interviews with the band members and the documentary itself, it was just too short.  The lack of adequate live footage of them performing was very irritating.  I kept waiting to be blown away, but it didn't happen.  I was also disappointed that there weren't more ""outside"" sources commenting on the band.  Surely the producers could have found ten to fifteen people who were associated with the band that could have rounded out what they had.  I found myself going to the extra features, but they were pretty lame, as well.  It's too bad that this piece may become the definitive dvd on the band, as it is just not enough.  They deserve more.  Joe deserves more.
