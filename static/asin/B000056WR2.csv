They run in the prison courtyard, then sing in a chapel. A disturbance draws the guards away. One man attacks another, he is stabbed in the chest and falls. Next a man takes a taxi to a courtroom where a lawyer defends a man accused of cocaine possession. Does cocaine overrule the US Constitution? The jury says `not guilty'. This young man is from Michigan Law School. He sees old newspaper articles about Edward Dodd. There is another case involving drugs. Can he make a deal? Yes. Dodd counts his pay. Another client arrives for her son, accused of murder. ""You do cases cheap"" says the interpreter. Dodd specializes in drug cases which test the Constitution (entrapment, bugging telephones, etc.).The new lawyer will handle this case he wants to be a criminal lawyer (to save the innocent accused?). Roger Baron and Dodd drive to Sing-Sing prison to interview their shackled client. ""What went down?"" They ask about his first crime, a gang murder. They do research on this case to learn more. A private investigator located other witnesses. One is in an institution. Is he reliable and credible? The police never called him. ""Who killed Kennedy?"" ""Lee Harvey Oswald"" he says. [They say 59% of the American people today believe in a conspiracy.] The Manhattan DA calls Dodd for a meeting at a restaurant. They talk about a deal. Dodd doesn't agree. A reporter talks to Dodd, there is a newspaper article. At night Dodd is attacked by a member of a Nazi gang. Phony teardrop tattoos? Dodd goes to visit the address and gets a surprise from the members of this gang, the ""Aryan Army"". Dodd visits his client and tells about the offered deal.The investigation returns to the crime scene. Dodd visits the DA to tell him ""no deal"". Can they learn more about Chuck Louder? ""A good fight is one you win!"" The Prosecutor opens the tria. Gang warfare cuts back on tourism, somebody has to be found guilty to make an example. ""I read the Post"" says one juror. [Then a liberal newspaper.] The detective tells about the arrest. A retired detective testifies from his wheelchair. Dodd visits a machine shop to find his attacker. Where does he live now? But he won't talk. What about his family? Was he murdered to make it look like a suicide? An eyewitness identifies Kim. What did she see? The prosecutor has a surprise witness - a fellow prisoner. What will Dodd do? He talks to his client again.Roger visits that machine shop to talk to a worker who visited the trial. ""You don't know anything."" An investigation into that shop owner reveals new evidence about his past. Dodd makes a dramatic entry into an apartment! What is a ""through and through""? He explains what they did for an air-tight case. [This is educational.] There is a confrontation in a parking garage at night! ""I can't do it."" The mystery is solved. Is Dodd in danger? The mystery is solved. Is Dodd in danger? ""Freeze!"" Can Dodd call an unexpected witness? Will DA Reynard provide information to free his client? That detective walks into the courtroom. ""It was a trade-off."" The defense rests. Kim is released from prison. Dodd is released from prison. Dodd talks about the need to defend the accused.This story is based on a true crime but doesn't give details. That accident case could be more interesting.

I get goosebumps every time I hear his speech about ...""the only good fight is one you win!"", said with the passion and spite that only James Woods has perfected.  His comment on plea bargaining, that ""..this isn't ... Yale, he [the client] doesn't care if we go down but go down nobly. He's looking at 40 years of hard time, and he bet it all on me!""  James Woods looks good with a pony tail, and the opening scene where his new intern, played by Robert Downey, Jr., mistakes him for the cocaine dealer is hilarious.  So is the scene where Downey tells Woods he is quitting because he is ""tired of using exalted legal principles to get off guilty little pricks"".  (I bet Downey was glad for those exalted legal principles in his own case.) I have to disagree with the comment that this movie realistically portrays the ""insidious relationship between police, district attorneys and their snitches"".  I wholeheartedly doubt that the frame at the heart of this movie is routine anywhere in the United States.  But the movie does say something meaningful about the tragedy that happens when good people with good motives go too far.

Enter Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.) who idolizes him from his activist past and wants to work for him.Roger is in the front office one day when the mother of Shu Kai Kim comes in and, through an interpreter, begs them to represent her son. He has been charged with murder in the prison where he has served eight years for a crime he didn't commit. In fact, the killing was clearly self-defense against a member of the Aryan Brotherhood.It becomes clear that the only way to get him off on the prison case is by reopening the Chinatown shooting for which he had been convicted eight years before. Dodd manages to do that, but finds himself in a very, very complicated and messy investigation in trying to uncover evidence that has been buried for eight years.But Dodd and Baron are way smarter than they look.

James Woods plays a pig-tailed, civil-rights, badly dressed, very eloquent, and very jaded lawyer who smokes marijuana and is prone to over-statements. A very young looking Robert Downey Jr. - it is 1989 - works as his admiring associate. They are approached by the mother of an Asian man who has spent eight years in prison for murder. She wants Wood to defend him for the recent murder in prison of a right-wing thug who tried to kill him. We see the event and it is clearly self defense. Downey persuades Woods to take the case, even though Woods hasn't handled a murder case in ten years. He spent the ten years defending drug dealers. Woods looks into the history of the Asian man and decides to file to reopen the eight-year old case. He finds a statement in the file that helps him get the case reopened. There was a witness who claimed that he saw the murder and it was committed by a non-Asian. Woods succeeds in getting the new trial, but faces several problems: this witness is clearly crazy, the prosecution has a witness who swears that she saw his client commit the murder, and forensics prove that the killing was done with the Asian's gun.Woods is threatened by a man who beats him up and tells him to drop the case. Why? The DA offers his client a much smaller sentence. Why? When Woods' client rejects the offer, the DA decides to try the case himself. Why? Woods finds a witness, but the witness is killed. Why? The trial drama is very interesting, but the DA is able to present a better case.

Then it is all a question of details. Gritty details. When you are working on a big business like the Colombian connection, you need informers and of course these have a price and that price is simple, total and absolute protection and impunity in their everyday criminal life.In this very particular case there seemed to be some kind of family business that made the informer nervous and he had to kill some kind of boyfriend of his daughter or something and then cover up his crime by having the police arrest and have an other man accused, as long as he was not a Caucasian nor someone from his own band or gang and that's how a Korean was dragged into prison and stayed there eight years.But the film is nothing so far. The point is how the defense attorney is going to get the truth out and his client out of the can. He has to force a couple of people into saying what has to be said and then he can trap the district attorney into revealing that the Korean was just the price to pay for the information about the Colombian connection. A pay off.Then the film is finished and we can go home and rest on our beds with no fear.

Clever dialogue, sharp acting, scary violence, moving innocence trodden under the heel of official corruption and cynicism,  if this is boring I have no idea what to suggest.There are more good one liners in this movie than in a Fred Allen retrospective.  At the very beginning the young idealistic apprentice lawyer who has come to work with the great Eddie Dodd, mistakes the pony tailed defense lawyer for the cocaine dealer he is defending!  Boy is he embarrassed.Later, when Dodd confronts the neo nazi brotherhood about whether they were behind his street attack, the guy with the rifle standing in the house decorated with swastikas says: ""if we were behind it, you wouldn't be here now"".When the dirty cop points a gun at him, fires a round past his temple and sugests he back off, he slows briefly but says, scared but resolute, ""sorry guys, can't do it,  I've gotta be in court.""You may not enjoy it, but i am a cheapskate with over 100 copied vhs tapes from the tube, and I am about to plunk down hard cash to buy this one.  Along with Witness, Fugitive, Don Juan de Marco, One Eyed Jacks, The Sting, True Lies, and a few others, this goes in my collection of movies to watch more than once.The unappreciated reference above was to a scene where the mother of the innocent convict says: ""We asked everywhere for a lawyer to help us, and everywhere they mentioned your name.""  Oh?  says Eddie Dodd, genuinely flattered, ""What did they say?"".  She replies, ""They all say, you work cheap.""And the brilliant bad guy DA is one of the classic hateable guys in film, the more than cold father of the kid who shoots hiimself in ""Dead Poets Society"".  i hope this is enough, not to persuade you, but to let you decide for yourself, whether to try it.And I hope the bored guy above donates his copy to the library.
