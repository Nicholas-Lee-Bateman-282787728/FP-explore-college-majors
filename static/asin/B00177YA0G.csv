1156287,A2Y7SJS20P9WF4,B00177YA0G,"Derek ""bookluver662""","[1, 1]","This dvd is not really "" essential"" in understanding the movie but is a good sampling of the show for those who have never seen it or the fan who wants a few of the most memorable episodes but doesn't want to purchase all nine seasons of the series.  Included in this set are :1. The Pilot- basically set's up the whole series.2. Beyond the Sea- A ""psychic"" episode that showcases Scully.3. The Host- one of the most popular ""monster of the week"" episodes4. Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose- Another ""psychic"" episode as well as a comedy episode.5. Memento Mori- a ""conspiracy"" episode that deals with Scully's cancer.6. Post Modern Prometheus- a comic retelling of Frankenstein.7. Bad Blood- a comic vampire story. Voted by fans as favorite episode.8. Milagro- Another episode showcasing the Scully character about a writer who can bring can literally kill with the written word.Each episode is introduced by the creators and there is also a panel discussion of the movie with the stars and creators included as special features.Overall, this is a good value for the money ($10 at Walmart)with some quality episodes. My only gripe and the reason that I gave the dvd 4 stars instead of 5 is that the dvd is too Scully focused. One episode focusing on the Mulder character should have been included. Perhaps ""Paper Hearts"" from season 4, an excellent episode that showcases the dramatic talents of David Duchovny, in a story that deals with the abduction of his sister. I'm not really sure why ""Milagro"" was included on this set and the ""Paper Hearts"" episode or another season 6 episode would have made the dvd perfect. IMHOStill, I would recommend this dvd to anyone who wanted to find out what the show was about or the casual fan who doesn't have alot of bucks to spend on sets.",4,A Good Sampling of the Series but too Scully Focused,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,1778,"['dvd', 'not', 'really', 'essential', 'understanding', 'movie', 'good', 'sampling', 'show', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'fan', 'who', 'few', 'most', 'memorable', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'want', 'purchase', 'nine', 'seasons', 'series', 'Included', 'set', 'are', ':1', 'Pilot-', 'basically', 'set', 'up', 'whole', 'series.2', 'Sea-', 'A', 'psychic', 'episode', 'Scully.3', 'Host-', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'monster', 'week', 'episodes4', 'Clyde', 'Bruckman', 'Final', 'Repose-', 'psychic', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'comedy', 'episode.5', 'Memento', 'Mori-', 'conspiracy', 'episode', 'deals', 'Scully', 'cancer.6', 'Post', 'Modern', 'Prometheus-', 'comic', 'retelling', 'Frankenstein.7', 'Bad', 'Blood-', 'comic', 'vampire', 'story', 'Voted', 'fans', 'favorite', 'episode.8', 'Milagro-', 'episode', 'showcasing', 'Scully', 'character', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'bring', 'can', 'literally', 'kill', 'written', 'word.Each', 'episode', 'introduced', 'creators', 'also', 'panel', 'discussion', 'movie', 'stars', 'creators', 'included', 'special', 'features.Overall', 'good', 'value', 'money', '10', 'Walmart', 'quality', 'episodes', 'only', 'gripe', 'reason', 'gave', 'dvd', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'dvd', 'too', 'Scully', 'focused', 'One', 'episode', 'focusing', 'Mulder', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'Perhaps', 'Paper', 'Hearts', 'season', '4', 'excellent', 'episode', 'dramatic', 'talents', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'story', 'deals', 'abduction', 'sister', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'why', 'Milagro', 'was', 'included', 'set', 'Paper', 'Hearts', 'episode', 'season', '6', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'dvd', 'perfect', 'IMHOStill', 'would', 'recommend', 'dvd', 'anyone', 'who', 'wanted', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'casual', 'fan', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'alot', 'bucks', 'spend', 'sets']",N/A
1156288,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00177YA0G,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""X-Files Revelations"" was released in conjunction with the 2008 X-Files movie ""I Want To Believe"".  Like the movie, ""Revelations"" is concerned more with the tradition of monsters of the week episodes in the X-Files TV series, vice the mythology episodes, and the 1998 movie ""FIght The Future"", that dealt with a complicated alien-human conspiracy.Series creater/producer Chris Carter chose eight classic episodes for inclusion in this two disk offering.  The ""Pilot"" episode recounts the first meeting of FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully and sets up their classic believer/skeptic dynamic.  ""Beyond the Sea"" reverses the usual order by making Scully the believer of a condemned man who makes psychic predictions.  ""The Host"" is an unusually creepy episode featuring a human flukeworm.  The superbly moving ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"" features actor Peter Boyle as a clairvoyant with a unhappy gift.""Memonto Mori"" has Mulder exploring a bizarre lab experiment while Assistant Director Skinner bargains with the infamous Cigarette-Smoking Man for Agent Scully' life.  ""Post-Modern Prometheus"" is a superbly executed sendup of the Frankenstein story, presented in black and white.  ""Bad Blood"" is a more or less hilarious take on the vampire genre, with Mulder and Scully stuck in a trailer park in Texas.  ""Milagro"" features an unexpected serial killer.Fans of the X-Files likely had their own preferences for classic episodes, but this is a decent selection and a great introduction to the series, augmented by commentary from Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz.  ""The X-Files Revelations"" is highly recommended to fans and newcomers for a look back at a classic science fiction show.",5,Monsters of the Week...,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,1689,"['X-Files', 'Revelations', 'was', 'released', 'conjunction', '2008', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'Want', 'Believe', 'movie', 'Revelations', 'concerned', 'more', 'tradition', 'monsters', 'week', 'episodes', 'X-Files', 'TV', 'series', 'vice', 'mythology', 'episodes', '1998', 'movie', 'FIght', 'Future', 'dealt', 'complicated', 'alien-human', 'conspiracy.Series', 'creater/producer', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'chose', 'eight', 'classic', 'inclusion', 'two', 'disk', 'offering', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'first', 'meeting', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'up', 'classic', 'believer/skeptic', 'dynamic', 'Sea', 'usual', 'order', 'making', 'Scully', 'believer', 'condemned', 'man', 'who', 'psychic', 'predictions', 'Host', 'unusually', 'creepy', 'episode', 'featuring', 'human', 'flukeworm', 'superbly', 'moving', 'Clyde', 'Bruckman', 'Final', 'Repose', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'clairvoyant', 'unhappy', 'gift', 'Memonto', 'Mori', 'Mulder', 'exploring', 'bizarre', 'lab', 'experiment', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Skinner', 'infamous', 'Cigarette-Smoking', 'Man', 'Agent', 'Scully', 'life', 'Post-Modern', 'Prometheus', 'superbly', 'executed', 'sendup', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'presented', 'black', 'white', 'Bad', 'Blood', 'more', 'less', 'hilarious', 'take', 'vampire', 'genre', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'stuck', 'trailer', 'park', 'Texas', 'Milagro', 'unexpected', 'serial', 'killer.Fans', 'X-Files', 'likely', 'had', 'own', 'preferences', 'classic', 'episodes', 'decent', 'selection', 'great', 'introduction', 'series', 'augmented', 'commentary', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'X-Files', 'Revelations', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'look', 'back', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'show']",N/A

I own all nine seasons and the movie so the episodes were nothing new. I paid $16 dollars so minus the 8.50 for the movie ticket- I paid 8 dollars to have a concise best of collection.

1156290,A1IFCQ7CC2TMFC,B00177YA0G,gunngirl,"[8, 9]","A few reviewers mentioned the extras and answered a lot of questions so suffice it to say I will just offer an opinion on this box set. Just like the previous ""Mythology"" DVD sets forThe X-Files Mythology, Vol. 2 - Black OilThe X-Files Mythology, Vol. 3 - ColonizationThe X-Files Mythology, Vol. 1 - AbductionandThe X-Files Mythology, Vol. 4 - Super Soldiersthat were put out several years ago, this offers a lot and nothing at the same time. Actually, the mythology DVD'swere probably better because you were introduced to certain themes of the show through all those episodes in a row and it served some purpose of showing the casual or new viewer what they were getting into and what the show was about. Not to say that this doesn't do that, but I don't care for the ""The Essential Guide to the X-Files Movie"" stamp on the front because this doesn't do that at all. I found no real extras that set up anything that we already didn't know and couldn't find out and while many of the episodes chosen here, particularly:PilotMilagroBad BloodClyde Bruckman's Final ReposeBeyond the SeaAre excellent in their own right, other than the Pilot, I don't see how these episodes set you up for the movie, or let you know what the heck happened during the show, at the end of the show or even the central theme of the show. This is really a (sort of) ""best of"" collection and I use that loosely since it's really not that at all either. If you wanted to intro your friend to the show, or showcase some of the best acting or writing of the show, I'd certainly use ""Beyond the Sea"", ""Clyde Bruckman..."" and ""Milagro"" and that just may be enough to pull them in. Sadly, this is still for hard core fans of the show and hard core fans don't need it--they already have all the eps on DVD.HOWEVER, in this DVD's defense I will say that these episodes are poignant for Mulder and Scully's RELATIONSHIP which says much for what the movie is centered on, which is just fine by me. The episodes picked nail the growing, sexy, complicated, sexually tension filled relationship, partnership and friendship of two of the most complex characters on TV and for that this set succeeds.Still, if this were a true ""Guide to the X-Files Movie"" they would have somehow gotten ahold of those ""Secrets of the X-Files"" shows shown a couple of times during the series with a brand new one created to include seasons 6-9 to update us on everything we need to know going into the movie. I'm a rabid fan and have followed everything but I'd still buy that. A montage of clips of Mulder and Scully with an overview of the series? Sign me up!If you must own everything X-Files, go right ahead and buy, but fans should not look for anything new, and newbies should just expect good episodes that will entertain, intrigue, (probably confuse because they're out of order) and (hopefully) make you want more.

1156292,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B00177YA0G,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[1, 1]","A little truth-in-advertising admonition is called for here: ""X-Files Revelations"" is billed as the ""essential guide to the X-Files movie"" (the one that opened in theaters in July 2008).  In actuality, this two-DVD set should have been more accurately described as ""a compilation of classic X-Files episodes that, while not really having anything to do with the new movie, will get you in the mood for it"".  But I guess that didn't sound as catchy.Anyway, you get eight very good episodes here, each accompanied by two or three minutes of optional introductory comments by show creator Chris Carter and producer/writer Frank Spotnitz, with a cute cameo by Gillian Anderson in the final introduction.  You also get the trailer from the new movie, and an entertaining, informative 26-minute panel discussion (made up of Carter, Spotnitz, Anderson, and David Duchovny) about the movie and the series in general, taped at a sci-fi/fantasy convention sometime in 2007.  What interesting about the panel discussion is that David Duchovny, who jumped ship from the series in its late going, is the one who speaks most enthusiastically and eloquently about the show and the movies.With its inexpensive price and interesting special features, this compilation is a good deal for folks like me who enjoy ""The X-Files"" but don't own every season and haven't seen every episode.  Oh, and for what it's worth, I enjoyed the new movie, ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"".  Sure, it was understated and decidedly non-bombastic for a summer genre release, but what's wrong with that?  I liked the acting, the creepiness, and the genuine thematic subtext.  Good stuff.  Do yourself a favor if you missed it in the theaters: pick up this well done compilation DVD to kill time while you're waiting for the movie to come out on DVD, and then pick it up when it does come out.
