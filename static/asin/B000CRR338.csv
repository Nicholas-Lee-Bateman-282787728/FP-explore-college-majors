Ham Sr. ""Boogie Daddy""","[1, 2]","At least 3 times I have started watching this Buried Alive movie,... it is just so dumb and so boring I stop and eject it every time. I agree with another reviewer-this movie must be filled with Soap Opera actors/B Movie stars. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It is slow and I suppose there is some moral there but I am not sure what. I saw a review of this movie where it is referred to as 4 obituaries,... which must say a lot about the plot and signifigance of it. Well enough said.

Once again, we have a hero who is estranged from his wife and son, and a corporate biggie who is the wife's daddy, too.  Everything pretty much goes as expected and unfortunately the special effects are pretty inadequate.For disaster movie freakos, this one's passable.",2,DOWN COMES THE MOUNTAIN,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,585,"['Considering', 'premise', 'already', 'been', 'utilized', 'movie', 'called', 'AVALANCHE', 'little', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'far', 'classic', 'cinema.A', 'new', 'condominium', 'complex', 'endangered', 'irresponsible', 'blasting', 'villain', 'keep', 'name', 'clean', 'resulting', 'landslide', 'not', 'surprise', 'Once', 'again', 'have', 'hero', 'who', 'estranged', 'wife', 'son', 'corporate', 'biggie', 'who', 'wife', 'daddy', 'too', 'Everything', 'pretty', 'much', 'expected', 'unfortunately', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'inadequate.For', 'disaster', 'movie', 'freakos', 'one', 'passable']",Buried Alive
