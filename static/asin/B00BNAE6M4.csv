1636241,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00BNAE6M4,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]","This is a pretty standard TV movie with a pretty standard romantic comedy plot. It is the story of how a French chef who owns a fancy but struggling restaurant learns to deal with a widowed dad and former fireman who opens up the ""Five Alarm Grill"" next door. At first there is a lot friction between them, but over time, they warm to each other. Most of the characters in this movie are likable and fairly realistic. They do a good job with their roles. There is nothing terribly original about the plot, but at the same time, there is also nothing outlandish or unrealistic. This is simply a nice, clean love story. It is one of the better TV movies I have seen and I recommend it for a nice low-key evening of watching.",4,Enjoyable,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,722,"['pretty', 'standard', 'TV', 'movie', 'pretty', 'standard', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plot', 'story', 'how', 'French', 'chef', 'who', 'fancy', 'struggling', 'restaurant', 'learns', 'deal', 'widowed', 'dad', 'former', 'fireman', 'who', 'up', 'Five', 'Alarm', 'Grill', 'next', 'door', 'first', 'lot', 'friction', 'time', 'warm', 'other', 'Most', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'likable', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'roles', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'original', 'plot', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'nothing', 'outlandish', 'unrealistic', 'simply', 'nice', 'clean', 'love', 'story', 'one', 'better', 'TV', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'recommend', 'nice', 'low-key', 'evening', 'watching']",A Taste of Romance

1636274,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00BNAE6M4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[25, 29]","Hey, there. I just saw A Taste of Romance. I can't wait to tell you about it. Had I mesmerizing powers, I would right now look you in the eyeball and compel you to watch this movie. Later, you can thank me for it. Pardon me a moment as I ransack the attic for my watch on a fob. It swings fine and with hypnotic purpose.It's another Hallmark Channel joint, so it's very much of the family friendly persuasion. I feel it's one of the best films to air on that network; that's how much I enjoyed it. Don't let the standard romantic plot dishearten you. Take in instead the expert execution of that same standard plot, and the across-the-board chemistry of an engaged cast, and the movie's big heart.Here's what's on the menu: Sara Westbrook (Teri Polo) is a classically trained chef, fancy head chef's uniform and perfect posture and very uptight. In Central Valley (wherever that is), she runs Chez Varenne, a restaurant specializing in exquisite French cuisine. Sara is a food psychic, so good at her job she can detect all the ingredients in any dish you care to place before her (I've the same preternatural skill, but it only works if you place a Reese's Pieces before me). Chez Varenne is underperforming. It boasts an underwhelming clientele; it's barely turning a profit. Sara is more uptight than ever. She's desperately wracking her brain.It's hard to wrack your brain when the place next door is blasting rock & roll noises. Sara's new work neighbor is Gill Callahan (James Patrick Stuart), widower and retired fireman and now fledgling restaurateur. Gill just opened the Five Alarm Grill, an eatery that trots out barbecued comfort food. Sara welcomes Gill by busting in and asking him to turn down the music. Gill refuses. And, just like that, the birth of a feud and the onslaught of pranks from both parties. Here's another bitter pill for Sara, that the Five Alarm Grill attracts such robust business, never mind that Gill tends to make up his recipes as he goes along.There's no arguing that Polo and Stuart draw up sparks together. The conflict between their characters arises not only from their natural professional competitiveness - Sara's precise, artful presentation versus Gill's messy, improvised dishes. Other things are in play. There's Sara's creeping demoralization as her hard work still results in her restaurant's flirting with insolvency. There's Gill's inertia rooted in his reluctance to move on even though his wife's been gone for two years. Teri Polo is really, really good in this movie. She's tough and brittle and appealingly vulnerable and, when given opportunity, so funny. What she does in that stream-of-consciousness babble meltdown in her kitchen (you'll know the scene) is priceless stuff. It reduced me to big smiles.Okay, Sara at one end, Gill at the other, and it seems an unnegotiable impasse. But here's the bridge. 9-year-old Hannah (Bailee Madison) is obssessed with many things French, ever since her mom years ago promised her a trip to France. It's not a stretch that Hannah would approach Sara for French lessons in language and in cooking. Sara, for her part, immediately takes to Hannah. She doesn't know yet that Hannah is Gill's daughter. If she hadn't yet enchanted you as young Snow White (Once Upon A Time) or as an enterprising girl scout (Smart Cookies), Bailee Madison's Hannah should do the trick. Bailee is a captivating find. She doesn't try to get away with just reciting her lines and looking cute. She acts the hell out of this movie. Her composure amazes me, more so because it's not at the cost of a child's natural exuberance. But even Hannah needs a little help orchestrating a love connection for her dad. Thank goodness for those ruined crab cakes. They provide the opening move in a detente between two warring chefs. I'll stop right here. So, A Taste of Romance. Don't lollygag, you romantic fool.
