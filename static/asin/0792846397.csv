Burchfield,"[0, 0]","I remember Powers Boothe as Tommy's father, he did all right in his role with this well filmed, if somewhat &#34;pro primitives/ pro environment movie, Charley Boorman was perhaps even better as his lost son turned &#34;Indian&#34;.The &#34;look&#34;of the film is almost National Geographic film in quality following the adventures of Charley and his adopted family.. It mostly looks good except in the use of nudity among the tribe. You see a lot of bare breasts but also a lot of strategically placed vines covering genitals ( one example being when some of the tribal women are rescued from a life of forced prostitution- they rip off their dresses and grab the nearest vines to cover themselves.)There's a bit of &#34;natives know best&#34; environmentalism all the way, like James Cameron has been accused of with Avatar, not too bad except the way in which the evil dam project is destroyed in the end. Bill Markham, Boothe, blasts his own dam but most of the destruction is caused by a flood generated by his son's tribe (he never gets him back, even after finding him) in a silly magic rain dance ritual led by his son Charley.The film is beautiful to look at, and worth the effort in spite of the &#34;preachiness&#34;.One last note, I'd always wondered about the &#34;Indians&#34; so I looked up this movie through Amazon's imdb link- learned almost nothing except that most of them made only this one movie.

Erland,"[36, 40]","Bill Markham (Powers Boothe), an American engineer supervising a development project in the Amazon Rainforest has his young son Tomme (Charley Boorman) abducted by an elusive Indian tribe known as ""The Invisible People."" Bill spends the next ten years combing the jungles trying to find Tomme and bring him home.When they are finally reunited Tomme is now a young man and the adopted son of the tribal chief and shaman (Ruy Polanah). He has also chosen a wife and is about to be married. And so the struggle begins, not only between father and son, but between two very foreign cultures in search of mutual understanding and acceptance.While the two fathers and son work through the implications of their chance meeting danger looms on the horizon. A neighboring tribe of cannibals known as ""The Fierce People"" will soon attack. The ensuing confrontation will force Bill to join in the battle in an effort to defeat a mutual enemy.Everything about this film is first rate. Acting (Powers Boothe, Charley Boorman and Ruy Polanah), directing (John Boorman), cinematography, and screenplay. It even has an important message to get across (saving the Rainforest) and does so without preaching to the audience or jeopardizing the integrity of the story.It has been some twenty years since the release of this film, yet it still remains to be relatively unknown by a vast majority of movie watchers. Why it hasn't received more attention by now is a total mystery to me. This is one of the true undiscovered gems of cinema that everyone should experience.

Walker ""geminiwalker""","[96, 107]","The beauty and power of the rainforest juxtaposed to the beauty and power of &quot;civilization,&quot; on of my favorite themes. Who is the true savage? Powers Boothe plays a construction engineer building a dam in the rainforest that is increasingly changing the structure of the most valuable real estate on earth. Not only is it effecting the plants and animals, creating desert where there was once rich vegetation, but it is affecting the indigenous tribes in horrendous ways. Charley Boorman plays the beautiful young son who is kidnapped by the leader of the &quot;Invisible People.&quot; His father and mother (played by the beautiful Meg Foster) spent the next ten years searching for the boy as he is being raised in tribal customs.Meanwhile, as the living space for the tribes grows increasingly smaller, the &quot;Invisible People,&quot; who are basically good hearted, land loving indigenous people who keep to themselves and only want to survive, are increasingly threatened by the &quot;Fierce People,&quot; a carnivorous, cannibalistic tribe who are desperately seeking space for themselves.We watch Tomme grow up, learn from his new &quot;father&quot; who loves him dearly and was perhaps initially attracted to the tyke's golden blond hair and his own need for a son. We watch Tomme go through a ritual rite of passage that sends him on a dangerous quest for the special green rock that allows what are now his people to become &quot;Invisible.&quot; It is in this quest that Tomme and his father cross paths again, and a lesson is learned about the cost of the damage civilization has brought to what is truly a beautiful and rich country better off left alone.For a long time I couldn't find this movie anywhere. Not even at amazon.com. I cherish the copy I did finally find. I am thrilled to see that it is now available on DVD, but would like to see a DVD created with educational &quot;special features&quot; about the rain forest and the fight to preserve it.

Soon thereafter their young son, Tommy, (Charley Boorman) disappears into the jungle. Tommy, now Tomme, was abducted by a peaceful Amazonian tribe known as the ""Invisible People"". Meanwhile, ten years pass as Tomme learns the ways of the indigenous people while his father continues to search for him. Finally, Bill Markham finds his son. But he soon learns that Tomme is happy with his new tribal family and doesn't wish to return to the outside world. Later the ""Invisible People"" are forced into a disasterous situation by a rival tribe and Tomme goes off to find his father so that he may help them recover their kidnapped women. The movie ends with Bill Markham destroying the dam so that Tomme and his people can continue to live their traditional lifestyle in the rainforest.I certainly have sympathy with this movie's central theme - which is the importance of preserving the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous people. In addition, the cinematography of this beautiful natural environment is impressive and the film even does a fairly decent job at depicting a somewhat, though not entirely, authentic portrait of the customs and rituals of an Amazonian tribe.I liked the earlier part of the movie. But the latter portion increasingly slips into an unrealistic sort of action-adventure flick. For example, the ""Invisible People"" are supposedly so isolated that they have never had contact with the outside world. But yet Tommee manages to travel by foot to the large city where the Markham family is living and then somehow tracks down his father. It is all highly implausible and, at times, quite ridiculous.I still consider this a film worth watching.

This commentary is on an unusual glitch that I discovered with the DVD.  I'm referring to the MGM &quot;Contemporary Classics&quot; edition (in case there's another version out there).I was surprised to discover that, when the native people were speaking, some of the subtitling was left off.  Moments of indigenous dialogue were left un-subtitled in the VHS version (moments when a character appeared to be saying something like  &quot;Move&quot; or &quot;Hey, look.&quot;).  However, with the DVD, there was one scene where a bit of dialogue that was significant to the development of the plot went unsubtited, and we were all left in the dark.  It happened in only one significant scene, that I noticed, and eventually it was apparent what the character had said, but it was still frustrating and strange.However, I still recommend that you get the DVD.  When comparing scenes between the DVD and my old VHS copy (in order to see what had been said during the previously mentioned scene), I discovered that the old pan and scan version occasionally cut out almost 50% of the screen!

156711,A282SV3AIUE154,0792846397,"K. Feucht ""OncoDoc""","[3, 9]","This movie is supposedly based on a true story and is presented by various eco-environmental groups as a moving and compelling argument to save the rain forests. Because of its high reviews on Amazon.com, I decided it demanded a re-watch, having seen it many years ago. The story is quite simple. A young engineer in charge of building a dam in the Amazon basin is out with his family near the construction site, when the young (about 7 year old) son is taken captive by a tribe which was isolated from civilization. This boy grows up in that tribe and becomes a leader. Ten years later, the father eventually finds his son, but is caught in the cross-fire of inter-tribal warfare. The raiding tribe has made contact with civilization and has procured machine guns, and thus have hauled off the young ladies of the tribe to be prostitutes. Meanwhile, son  weds a young tribal lady, only to find her as a captive of the warring tribe. Using his now alienated father for assistance, the girls are rescued and son decides to stay primitive rather than go back to his roots. Upset with the dam that father has built, son calls on the frogs to make it rain, and a heavy rain coupled with new sympathies of father, father dynamites the dam and the progress of man is halted.While this movie is reportedly based on a true story, it is quite clear that much of the events are fictitious. Hollywood needed to make a statement, and didn't seem to be concerned about truth. Thus, when they made statements at the end lamenting the loss of the primitive savage and rain forest, they give numbers that any credible thinker would question. The filmography of the movie was okay, but not great. It is clear that the film crew had three or four locations at most. But, what about the movie? Why would it get such a low rating from me? This movie would be best thought of as a merger of Al Gore in Inconvenient Truth and Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon, with a story line written by Margaret Mead. The script writer had tried to develop the innocent savage theme of Margaret Mead, perhaps not realizing that most of what Margaret Mead wrote about her adventures to the South Pacific were a total fiction, and should have been condemned to the genre of the Harlequin Romances rather than credible science. Unfortunately, Mead was devoured by the non-critical ideologues of academia and was sold as an argument against civilization and for the peace-loving, amoral primitive man, not driven by money, greed or passions. This movie makes light of the alternate belief structure of the primitive Amazonian. They are able to call on the frogs to make rain, without explanation as to how they might have the power to do this.This leads to a beautiful non-sequitor, in which we should not destroy rain forest because if we were sensitive to ""Mother Earth"", we could pray to frogs who would help us destroy the advance of modern technology. The movie leaves out that these primitives live in constant fear of the spirit world, which is an ugly taskmaster, and not the benevolent loving God of the Judeo-Christian faith. A favorite scene of the movie was the swimming hole, where the naked young Amazonian men would meet the equally naked young Amazonian women. It was a mixture of the opening scenes from Margaret Mead's ""Coming of Age in Samoa"" and various scenes from the Blue Lagoon-entirely fictitious and entirely wishful for free-love without bounds or constraints or defined morality. If only the scriptwriters could actually live in one of these communities for a while to see that the female always takes a seriously subservient mode to the man. But, academic fictions contribute to even more fictions, and the most gullible among us, the Academics, sell this trash to us without any thought as to its truth content.The movie poorly asks the question as to which culture or civilization is best. Is it the primitive native of the rainforest, or is it the so-called civilized man? The referential framework for making this judgement in the movie is the question of who treats the earth the best, and clearly, the primitive native wins out. But, that is not really a fair question, since it is not the primitive native making this assertion, but rather, it is the civilized man using the technology and knowledge that is despised to fight technology and ""knowledge"". It suggests that there is a primitive knowledge that is lost (note the very last statement of the movie!), but the movie makes clear that what is lost is a ""knowledge"" of the spirit world, a world that most modern man choses to believe does not exist, but those that are of a Christian heritage would ascribe to the demonic world whose torments are best to be delivered from.Regarding the concern that anthropologists have to preserve primitive cultures, that is a total hypocrisy, since they wish to have access to these cultures, but nobody else. After all, if a primitive culture exists that you don't know exists, it doesn't matter whether or not they exist. Yet, the obsession with preserving primitive culture as a reference point for where modern culture has gone wrong fails. Margaret Mead used several isolated cultures in Samoa and New Guineas to build an argument for feminism and sexual liberation, an argument that is specious at best by denying what we see in man every day as a depraved person. We build utopian or mythical worlds to escape what we see is evil in our own culture, yet fail to grasp that we are chasing nothing but a fantastical creation of our mind devoid of reality.In conclusion, the movie is inconsistent and ambiguous enough to make any decisions regarding either cultural judgments or environmental concerns. The movie offers no greater reference point for making any further judgements, either regarding morality or culture. Thus, one must turn elsewhere for these decisions. It is no wonder that The Emerald Forest has not had a lasting impact, and no wonder that the environmental movement and anthropology comes across as a touch insincere.",1,Not a serious

156712,A3QWNQ2WA7QZYJ,0792846397,kireviewer,"[4, 25]","Anyone who says they like this movie for the social comments or cultural conflicts will tell you that they buy Playboy for the articles.This movie takes place in the Amazon jungles.  It involves a tribe of mostly naked ""Indian"" women.  These are not giant Amazon beauties.  These are petite, but very cute women.  It is unrealistic.  Native women running nude in the jungle, wearing only paint, do not look that good...so, invitingly smooth and tight.  These are not indiginous or native women.  These are actresses who have appeared in other movies.Other than that, this is a pretty good movie.  The jungle scenes are gorgeous.  These scenes, along with nubian little bodies really transport you to another world...a world of wet dreams.There is also a very good action story here, with the hero searching for his lost son.  There are cannibals and destruction of the rain forest.But, don't believe that garbage about this being a study of different cultures, of civilization meeting native Americans.  It is just a very good action story, with some sex thrown in, using the destruction of the rain forest as a backdrop.  It is very mesmerizing and involving.

This is a terrific movie!  It has some faults but I am willing to forgive them for the fun, adventure, and excitement that I got from watching this movie.For openings, the concept is terrific.  It may be the worst nightmare for a parent but we, the audience, are spared that knowing that it won't be much of a movie if the son doesn't reappear.  It is from the perspective of the son that the story holds its' magic.  Suppose you were captured by obscure Amazonian tribesmen around the age of 5 and swept of into the depth of the vast jungle world they live in.  I know...lousy food, no indoor plumbing, no TV, etc. etc. etc..  But let's forget about that (and missing mommy and daddy) and consider the adventure of a lifetime.The story, of course, involves the reuniting of parents and child.  It is something like 7-10 years later and our little boy is now a teenager in his Amazonian society.  The family members reunite, solve a crisis of modern man, and the boy, now a man in his new society, faces the choice of which world to live in.The cinematography is outstanding and the infinite possibilities are well-utilized.  Some parts of the story slow the movie down a bit but the impact remains profound.  This is a movie to watch with just about the whole family.  Some of the corruption of the modern world may cross over a line or two but it does fit into the message of the movie.

Once again, Boorman so ably captures the essence of the outdoors that it almost becomes a tangible supporting character. Nature in the cinematic world of Boorman is an entity to be revered and feared if you know what is good for you.Bill Markham (Powers Boothe) is an American engineer who is in Brazil to help oversee the construction of a dam.  While inspecting the construction site, tragedy strikes when his young son, Tommy (William Rodriguez) disappears.  Haunted by his loss, Markham returns to the rainforest every year for ten years in search of his lost son.  He eventually finds the adult Tommy (Charley Boorman) - now know as Tomme - living with the native ""Invisible People.""  As Markham tries to re-establish his relationship with his son, he slowly learns of the devastating ecological and cultural consequences his industrial world has had upon the area.""The Emerald Forest"" sometimes comes across as too heavy-handed in its critique of modern society's threat towards the natural world.  Yet, despite its labored message, the film's central story of Markham's searching for his son is involving on an emotional and dramatic level.  Furthermore, the scenes with the natives are an insightful venture into an unfamiliar way of life that is as compelling as it is informative.

156729,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,0792846397,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","In his long career as director that spans more than 40 years, John Boorman has made films that are not many in number, but cover a wide variety of topics. Just watch the list of his films and you know what I mean - ""Point Blank"" ""Deliverance"" ""Excalibur"" ""The General"" and ... well ...""Exorcist II: The Heretic."" And don't forget the 1974 sci-fi cult film ""Zardoz"" starring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling. ""The Emerald Forest"" is probably one of his better works, if not his best. The film's message about the vanishing rainforest is still resonant, though it is undermined by the uneven narrative.The storyline itself is simple. Tommy, a young son of an American dam engineer Bill Markham (Powers Booth), is abducted by a rainforest tribe in Brazil. While Bill tries to find the clues as to the whereabouts of the tribe (known as the ""Invisible People""), ten years pass by, turning the missing son into a warrior - now Tomme (played by Charlie Boorman) - fighting to protect his love and land.Visuals of the rain forests are gorgeous, capturing the charms and dangers of the place. Also, the film's actions (including gun fights) are not bad. Strong acting from Charlie Boorman (director's son) is also memorable, but characters' conflicting emotions are not fully explored, often overshadowed by the struggles and battles between two opposing forces. (Strangely, the boy's mother played by Meg Foster has little to do in the story.) The director seems more interested in the adventures of the two males than in the father-and-son relationship, where the film originally started.The end result is not bad, though. This is a very entertaining film with an important message, although the message itself is a bit too obvious for viewers.",4,(3.5 STARS) Beautiful and Enjoyable,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,1741,"['long', 'career', 'director', 'more', '40', 'years', 'John', 'Boorman', 'made', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'number', 'wide', 'variety', 'topics', 'Just', 'watch', 'list', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Deliverance', 'Excalibur', 'General', 'well', 'Exorcist', 'II', 'Heretic', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', '1974', 'sci-fi', 'cult', 'film', 'Zardoz', 'starring', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Emerald', 'Forest', 'probably', 'one', 'better', 'works', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'message', 'vanishing', 'rainforest', 'still', 'resonant', 'undermined', 'uneven', 'narrative.The', 'storyline', 'simple', 'Tommy', 'young', 'son', 'American', 'dam', 'engineer', 'Bill', 'Markham', 'Powers', 'Booth', 'abducted', 'rainforest', 'tribe', 'Brazil', 'Bill', 'find', 'clues', 'whereabouts', 'tribe', 'known', 'Invisible', 'People', 'ten', 'years', 'pass', 'turning', 'missing', 'son', 'warrior', 'now', 'Tomme', 'played', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'fighting', 'protect', 'love', 'land.Visuals', 'rain', 'forests', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'capturing', 'charms', 'dangers', 'place', 'Also', 'film', 'actions', 'including', 'gun', 'fights', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'Strong', 'acting', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'director', 'son', 'also', 'memorable', 'characters', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'fully', 'explored', 'often', 'overshadowed', 'struggles', 'battles', 'two', 'opposing', 'forces', 'Strangely', 'boy', 'mother', 'played', 'Meg', 'Foster', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'director', 'more', 'interested', 'adventures', 'two', 'males', 'father-and-son', 'relationship', 'where', 'film', 'originally', 'started.The', 'end', 'result', 'not', 'bad', 'though', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'message', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'viewers']",N/A
