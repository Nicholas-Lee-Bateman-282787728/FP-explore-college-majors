In this attack the Leaf is almost destroyed. This movie is a little different from other Naruto movies because it has two stories going on at once. Everything is revealed when the stories finally meet with each other. The fight scenes are amazing and very well animated, the story is gripping, and there are a lot of fan fights in this one. Sasuke shows up and Naruto fights along side him for a while in this one. All and all, I would recommend this series and all of it's movies (minus Naruto Shippuden movie 4: the lost tower) to anyone and everyone that asked me.

By far the worst fight scenes I have yet to witness in the Naruto series or movies I have watched to date. Which doesn't say much as there were only a handful of fight moments. The plot was extremely weak, and in many ways did not follow true to the Naruto I know. The leaf village bombed into ruins in the first few minutes by flying ninjas that were seen by everyone coming towards the village, yet there was no defense raised to speak of. It was truly pathetic to see some of the strongest Ninja's in the story stand there and go o no people are flying above us and I have suddenly forgotten the literally hundreds of abilities I know that can deal with that. No one has ever heard of these attacking ninja, then suddenly they have, ""O it's those guys from x years ago we fought that I momentarily forgot about and have never mentioned but we all know that.""

1274551,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B002KFSQSG,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[2, 3]","Pretty much the problem with this movie is that the plotline and excution is falling into DBZ film territory (ends at random and are very repetitive of each other), which is just not good. It seems ridicoulous for an entire army of sky ninja to be allowed to bomb the leaf village while nobody does much of anything, but it happens. Shouldn't there have been at least something resembling a war at home while Naruto and co. discovered the true issue here?But when they do, we are hit by an entirely new problem. We have a moving fortress with immense power feeding off of people. We have the person who thought they were being mentored by the best, only to be betrayed by a truly evil being. We have fighting inside and it crashing down. Sound familar? Yeah, basically all hits on plot points from the second Naruto movie.I know these movies are all filler and formulatic, but this one just went too far. Now the last 30 minutes does put up quite a crazy hit with a worm-like tail beast, with Naruto and Sasuke having to work together to destroy the monstrous creature. This scene is quite good, and the humorous ending after a dramatic falling from the sky to their death sequence was well done. However, the entire middle of this movie was quite dissapointing, and the fight scenes themselves aside from the Naruto/Sasuke team up were weak. And again, the entire rest of the sky ninja bomb, and then basically do nothing for the rest of the movie, their constructions destroyed by some odd amount of bugs that could've never existed. I quess they figured the Sasuke/Naruto sequence was enough to bring people in, and to be honest, it worked.However, it cannot even come close to comparing to Naruto Movie 2: Legend Of The Stone Of Gelel, or Naruto Shippuden: The Movie.

1274552,A2VPRTKCL22TCH,B002KFSQSG,"Q. Pair ""Shaman""","[32, 35]","As most Naruto fans can attest, the release of this movie (in America) was highly anticipated for a good year and a half. I guess thats with any popular Anime movie that we wait to get subbed into English, but this was even more anticipated because of raised expectations from the Shippuuden world. But the question remains, does the second Shippuuden movie live up to the high standard set by the series? Eh, sorta.""Bonds"" follows a pretty formulaic plot, as far as Naruto movies go. Something goes wrong, Naruto is sent on a mission with Sakura and whoever else is picked to have screen time this time around (Hinata being the third team member in this case), an important secondary character is introduced (the spunky tomboy Amaru), bad stuff happens in between, fighting, the bad guy is revealed, fighting, Naruto gets his butt kicked, passionate speech, epic final battle, the end. Now of course the movie is more complex then this, but this is merely the outline of the plot that most of these Naruto movies follow, and to be honest, thats fine with me. It works. One shouldn't go into these movies expecting to see some huge incredible story unfold. Its fan service, and fans love seeing these ninjas do what they do best: fight.The movie was by no means bad, but as is with many movies, it didn't live up to the hype that was provided by the preview. I think the reason this was as much of a disappointment as it was is because the biggest thing fans looked forward to when watching this was seeing Sauske in action with Naruto. Anyone who has followed the series knows that Sauske has been absent for a very long time, and has only recently been getting any airtime. About the time this movie came out, we were starving for a little Sauske action, and we expected to see it in ""Bonds"". Well, we werent totally disappointed, Sauske definitely was in it, and he did his thing, but he's in the movie for all of 10 minutes total. He appears ominously at the beginning, briefly in the middle, and in the epic final battle. Other then that, no Sauske. Its kind of a big jip, but what can you do?There is one aspect to this movie that has a light and dark side to it. Its a big part of the movie so I wont spoil it for those who have yet to see it, but basically the writers decided to incorporate something that was had the potential to be a VERY interesting story in itself, outside of the movie format. The plus is that it does in fact give some depth to the movie and makes it more then just a huge ninja fight fest. The downside however, is that using it in this movie eliminates the possibility of using it in the series for future story development, and I would really love to see that flushed out more. When you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about immediately.There is plenty of action, so no worries there, and all of your favorite Konoha characters are around for the fun, but its nothing you haven't seen before. The Sky ninja thing is kinda interesting for all of a few minutes, but they wear out their welcome in the opening sequence of the movie in the long, drawn out attack on Konoha (it took almost 10 minutes for them to do!)Anyway, bottom line, this is a pretty decent movie with moderate replay value. At the very least you will be entertained, because aside from the action, there is plenty of goofy Naruto goodness to get you laughing, enough action to keep you a little hyped, and enough twists, turns, and depth that the story will keep you from falling asleep in the slow moments. Despite it's shortcomings, I like it. 4/5 stars.",4,A Nice Break From The Naruto Norm,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,3570,"['most', 'Naruto', 'fans', 'can', 'attest', 'release', 'movie', 'America', 'was', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'good', 'year', 'half', 'guess', 'thats', 'popular', 'Anime', 'movie', 'wait', 'get', 'subbed', 'English', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'anticipated', 'raised', 'expectations', 'Shippuuden', 'world', 'question', 'second', 'Shippuuden', 'movie', 'live', 'up', 'high', 'standard', 'set', 'series', 'Eh', 'sorta', 'Bonds', 'pretty', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'as', 'far', 'Naruto', 'movies', 'go', 'Something', 'wrong', 'Naruto', 'sent', 'mission', 'Sakura', 'whoever', 'else', 'picked', 'have', 'screen', 'time', 'time', 'Hinata', 'being', 'third', 'team', 'member', 'case', 'important', 'secondary', 'character', 'introduced', 'spunky', 'tomboy', 'Amaru', 'bad', 'stuff', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guy', 'revealed', 'fighting', 'Naruto', 'butt', 'kicked', 'passionate', 'speech', 'epic', 'final', 'battle', 'end', 'Now', 'course', 'movie', 'more', 'complex', 'then', 'merely', 'outline', 'plot', 'most', 'Naruto', 'movies', 'follow', 'be', 'honest', 'thats', 'fine', 'One', 'should', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'expecting', 'see', 'huge', 'incredible', 'story', 'unfold', 'fan', 'service', 'fans', 'love', 'seeing', 'ninjas', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'fight.The', 'movie', 'was', 'means', 'bad', 'many', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'was', 'provided', 'preview', 'think', 'reason', 'was', 'much', 'disappointment', 'was', 'biggest', 'thing', 'fans', 'looked', 'forward', 'when', 'watching', 'was', 'seeing', 'Sauske', 'action', 'Naruto', 'Anyone', 'who', 'followed', 'series', 'Sauske', 'been', 'absent', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'getting', 'airtime', 'time', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'were', 'starving', 'little', 'Sauske', 'action', 'expected', 'see', 'Bonds', 'Well', 'werent', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'Sauske', 'definitely', 'was', 'did', 'thing', 'movie', '10', 'minutes', 'total', 'ominously', 'beginning', 'briefly', 'middle', 'epic', 'final', 'battle', 'Other', 'then', 'Sauske', 'kind', 'big', 'jip', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'aspect', 'movie', 'light', 'dark', 'side', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'so', 'wont', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'basically', 'writers', 'decided', 'incorporate', 'something', 'was', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'VERY', 'interesting', 'story', 'movie', 'format', 'plus', 'fact', 'give', 'depth', 'movie', 'more', 'then', 'just', 'huge', 'ninja', 'fight', 'fest', 'downside', 'however', 'using', 'movie', 'possibility', 'using', 'series', 'future', 'story', 'development', 'would', 'really', 'love', 'see', 'flushed', 'out', 'more', 'When', 'see', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'immediately.There', 'plenty', 'action', 'worries', 'there', 'favorite', 'Konoha', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Sky', 'ninja', 'thing', 'kinda', 'interesting', 'few', 'minutes', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'opening', 'sequence', 'movie', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'attack', 'Konoha', 'took', 'almost', '10', 'minutes', 'do', 'Anyway', 'bottom', 'line', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie', 'moderate', 'replay', 'value', 'very', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'aside', 'action', 'plenty', 'goofy', 'Naruto', 'goodness', 'get', 'laughing', 'enough', 'action', 'keep', 'little', 'hyped', 'enough', 'twists', 'turns', 'depth', 'story', 'will', 'keep', 'falling', 'asleep', 'slow', 'moments', 'shortcomings', 'like', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

If you've seen the last three Naruto movies then this one shouldn't come as a surprise,  you have a enemy of the leaf villages past who seeks revenge for a past transgression that the leaf village did to it and now in retaliation they strike the leaf with formidable weaponry from the skies hence their known village and what they are called the sky ninja.  As Naruto and company seek to take care of the threat they run into two new characters who have ties both to the sky ninjas and the calamity they caused with one of the couples lives,  also we have the reintroduction of Sasuke who is supposedly on a quest for Orichimaru as throughout the movie he and Naruto will meet up.  I have never been a fan of Sasuke and here he is actually less likable almost apathetic,  they talk about the bonds between him and Naruto but you don't see it at all as Sasuke seems to not even care about his former comrades or friends and former teammate.  Don't get me wrong you do see small specks of morality in Sasuke but there so few and small to barely call him nothing but a power hungry traitor which he is,  as you could probably tell already I truly despise this character as I find nothing redeemable about him after all he tried to kill his supposed best friend for power so excuse me for thinking he's scum not worth saving.
