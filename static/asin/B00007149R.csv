Let me start again, lol.For the very first time in my life, I think I've finally seen a romance comedy that deserves 5 out of 5 perfect stars.Yes that's right- despite the fact I claim time and time again (and even put it in my profile description here at amazon) that romance comedies can NEVER have a chance of winning me over because most of the time this is a genre of movies that *really* doesn't appeal to me in the slightest, I guess I have to make an exception in this particular case because Buying the Cow does just about everything right.It contains actual humor that a guy like me can easily get into (you know, since I'm stubborn and close-minded when it comes to romance comedies) and it features a storyline that eventually leads to an exciting and surprising conclusion.  There's really no flaws anywhere in sight.Everything from the naked guy jumping out a bathroom window and hanging by a rope attached to a steel bar by the toilet, to the woman in the kitchen spraying his naked hanging body with water out of confusion and fear, to the little boy standing below and believing the guy is superman without his cape, to the man walking out from behind a building corner taking out trash when he catches the guy in a peculiar situation, to the two dogs going at it beside the front door, to the police noticing and admiring the two dogs... yeah this is one extremely well-written and hilarious segment.And that's just one part of the film!  I didn't even mention the hilarious waitress with a bad attitude.We're talking about a romance comedy that is funnier more often than it's boring.  That's *incredibly* rare, haha.  It's unheard of!Whoever came up with the storyline deserves some awards.  Like I mention above, there's a twist at the end involving one of the many women that plays a small part throughout the movie, and I guess it shouldn't be taken as a surprise if you've been following the events closely, but nonetheless, I was a bit shocked.Overall, the acting is really good, the humor is definitely a reoccuring theme (to my surprise!) and the film is just really darn good.  Finally, a romance comedy I can proudly award 5 stars without reservations!

723863,A34ZVLFQSI8O2I,B00007149R,"C. Weldon ""Movie Guy""","[7, 8]","The cast alone is a reason to see this movie.  Jerry O'Connell is his usual quirky funny self, Brigitte Wilson follows in her own footsteps as a girl wanting to get married (Love Stinks and Wedding Planner), Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as a guy who is so much of a player, mistakes himself for gay when he wakes up in what he thinks is a guys bed, and Alyssa Milano takes a break from the norm as the stripper with a heart of gold.  O'Connell plays Dave, a commitment phobe who has just been given the ultimatum by his hotter then life girlfriend (played by Bridgett Wilson).  She leaves for New York, leaving him to his own devices.  Little does she know, he is stuck in 1st gear because of a near intimate moment in an airport when he was 16.  The girl in the airport left a mark on his life and he is afraid if he marries his girlfriend he will be missing out on his soulmate.  Reynolds is hilarious as the guy that is so in love with himself he should  be gay.  On his quest for the one, he wakes up in a strange bed and does not remember anything from the night before.  When a guy walks in and starts to clean up around him, he thinks that he has had sex with him and begins to question his sexuality, which leads to very humorous scenes with Reynolds (nearly naked and man is he hot!!!).  Alyssa Milano rounds out the cast as Amy, a stripper who used to date Dave and is now friends with the boys.  A very funny movie and a movie that should be seen if you like movies like Tomcats and American Pie.

This is a generic romantic-comedy with typical characters that are predictable and two-dimensional.  Except for the character of ""Mike"" played with impeccable comic timing by Ryan Reynolds.  I laughed hysterically at his scenes, nearly in tears at times, while only mildly chuckling at the situations and/or antics of the other characters. His time here is sparkling and is the epitome of comedic professionalism.  When you have a supporting role in an otherwise average film, you should make the most of it; and on the strength of his performance alone I can recommend this film.  As for the appearance of Alyssa Milano, she looked alluring as usual, but was otherwise just another disposable bimbo-type character that could have been played by thousands of other actresses with breast implants like hers.  Not to belittle her talent, but she has no scenes here worth mentioning.  As for her acting ability, try watching her television show ""Charmed.""  But for all the raging heterosexuals out there who want to see more of her ""talent,"" you should all buy ""Embrace of the Vampire.""  She is absolutely luscious in that movie.

Who knows why this wasn't a success back in 2002.  I guess maybe because the lead actor and actress weren't that well known (and haven't gone on to major success) and the minor sidekick actor Ryan Reynolds was yet to become a regular lead in higher budget and marketed movies, pretty much just being known for his role on the TV show Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place which ended the year before this was released.  Reynolds though is the reason to buy this, he plays a similar character to Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, and has some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see, such as when he wakes up and thinks he slept with a man, and the Spiderman scene with the kid stumbled upon by the kid's father and its aftermath is absolutely classic.  It also has minor appearance by Alyssa Milano at the end who may have been added to get fans of Charmed which was airing at the same time as this.  Whatever reason you decide to give this great film a go, just buy it, you won't be disappointed.Basic plot revolves around a couple, where the girlfriend goes to New York for a career opportunity. She wants a commitment from her boyfriend who is reluctant to do so.  You see he doesn't believe he's found the one since he met the one for a few seconds at an airport when he was 19.  His friends including one played by Reynolds, tell him why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free, only problem is another friend is getting married.

O'Connell has a graphic design company and has a lovely girlfriend, Bridgette Wilson (House On Haunted Hill, Love Stinks) but work gets in the way, which force the both of them to experiment in dating others. Reynolds tries to cope with the fact that he is becoming gay. It's, its just an awful movie and it really suffers from mad cow diesease, litterally. Reynolds shouldnt of done that scene from Silence OF The Lambs, NO! that was wrong! Ron Livingston (Office Space, Swingers) shouldnt of been in this movie and he just looks too much like Jon Tenney's (HomeGrown, Fools Rush In) older brother. Alyssa Milano (Poison IVy 2, FeaR) has bad choices in movies now. Also starring Kevin Weisman (tv's Alias, tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Annabeth Gish (tv's X-Files, SLC Punk), Fiona Loewi (senior Trip, Love and Death On Long Island) and a weird appearace by John O'Hurley (best known for portraying Elaine Bennetts boss on Seinfeld), you know the guy, ""my buddies call me Timbo"" , it was just too much and it is a forgettable movie.

This news wreacks havoc on David's life as he tries to find the answer to the question the movie asks.This movie is funny, very funny at times and also at times quite stupid, but it is good quality entertainment nonetheless.

It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess.
