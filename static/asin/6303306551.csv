Why the stupid US Government still denies the exsistance of UFO's and their roll in the cover up of these things especially at Roswell and the denial of what happend at Roswell I will never know. There are so many people that have come forward to prove that this actually took place is astounding and it is high time they admitted the truth.,5,Ufo Movie,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,422,"['extremely', 'excellent', 'movie', 'so', 'close', 'truth', 'not', 'funny', 'Why', 'stupid', 'US', 'Government', 'still', 'exsistance', 'UFO', 'roll', 'cover', 'things', 'especially', 'Roswell', 'denial', 'what', 'happend', 'Roswell', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'come', 'forward', 'prove', 'actually', 'took', 'place', 'astounding', 'high', 'time', 'admitted', 'truth']",N/A

Voyles,"[2, 2]","This is a good movie to watch but one thing that I found odd is that the actor who plays the son of JESSE MARCEL in the movie seems to have an angry attitude toward his father's continued insistance that the Roswell saucer crash really happened and was covered up. In real interviews with the real JESSE MARCEL JR, the man seems to be very supportive of his father's continued insistance of the crash. In a way it seems as if this film was made by someone who wanted to support the idea that nothing happened rather than the idea that it did.

Scheurich ""The Professor""","[1, 5]","Regardless what anyone thinks about aliens or their mode of transportation the entire concept has taken on a life of its own. Some of these concepts are very amusing as individuals try to use the controversy to push their personal philosophy on others. Some of my favorites are:They're here to punish us for throwing away aluminum cans and not recycling.They are bad, evil etc.They are good, nice, kind etc.They see us as a threat to the universe and want to exterminate us.We're their food.They want to mate with us because...They want to make us their slaves.As long as there is money to be made there will be movies about UFOs and aliens.",2,A Life of its own,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,641,"['Regardless', 'what', 'anyone', 'aliens', 'mode', 'transportation', 'entire', 'concept', 'taken', 'life', 'own', 'concepts', 'are', 'very', 'amusing', 'individuals', 'try', 'use', 'controversy', 'push', 'personal', 'philosophy', 'others', 'favorites', 'are', ""'re"", 'here', 'punish', 'throwing', 'away', 'aluminum', 'cans', 'not', 'recycling.They', 'are', 'bad', 'evil', 'etc.They', 'are', 'good', 'nice', 'kind', 'etc.They', 'see', 'threat', 'universe', 'want', 'exterminate', 'us.We', ""'re"", 'food.They', 'want', 'mate', 'want', 'make', 'slaves.As', 'long', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'movies', 'UFOs', 'aliens']",N/A
368549,A2FA18B50XGXJX,6303306551,Sam Damon Jr.,"[31, 35]","First off, the entire UFO scene is corroded by &quot;nit-pickers&quot; who couldn't be proven that cookies exist at a grocery store much anything more (&quot;We have no proof that cookies are always in the cookie aisle, sometimes they are seen in the dairy department..&quot;). Essentially they are wannabe-lawyers without practical information to live life by; real people need good-enough information to act on, and this film gives us just that. This is probably THE best UFO/ET movie Hollywood has made yet, better than E.T., Close Encounters and all of the other fairy tales. It takes what took place at Roswell in 1947; puts you there with Major Jesse Marcel, and runs-with-it, to its full conclusion: the worse-case-scenario that indeed alien craft crashed there etc. In an exciting, and dramatic way you see how the truth is covered up with intimidation (Your career will be ruined!) and fear and how the military/government was (is) scared white by the UFO/ET phenomena as it should be. Civilians who seek courtroom-level &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;open-ness&quot; are not so smart. There is a big differance between National Security and a feel-good debating society.The film works on many levels, authentic 1940s look/feel, excellent music, but the key idea is the general concept of a cover-up and what do the men who hid the truth do when they get old and are ready to die? Do they talk? Noone had asked that question until the film. A few years later, Colonel Philip Corso wrote a book from his end as an Army R&amp;D developer (The Day After Roswell) just before he died; so the question is; if someone hid the truth as a young man, would we listen to him as an old man with nothing-to-lose? If we are wannabe lawyers in our mentality, we certainly will be legalistic and not listen because these folks have ruined their &quot;credibility&quot;. Real people, not UFOlawyers understand that in time of war you have to lie at times to protect the common good and that people/situations change...as life is in some ways a struggle, and when the time is right the truth might be able to be revealed. That the USAF has already lied at least twice about Roswell (Weather balloons, lately parachute dummies) should tell you something is not what it appears. Those that say it was project MOGUL sensor balloons to monitor Russian A-Bomb test, geee big deal. After the Russians declared they had &quot;the bomb&quot; most people wouldn't care if you ran kites up to the stratosphere to measure radiation. Why the secrecy now, then? We have spy satellites that everyone in the world has known about since SPUTNIK. Its not the surveillance methodology or the tidbit that we knew the Russians were testing A-Bombs that was worth hiding/deceiving about. Why use stretchers to carry parachute dummies? You simply throw them over your shoulder and walk.The most compelling scene in the movie is when Secretary of Defense Forrestal communicates with the so-called ET; consider this with the fact that he later jumped out of a window (with assistance) to his death (murder). Suggest you read Corso's book in conjunction with this video and consider that the &quot;beings&quot; that are manifesting themselves are NOT cuddly Spielberg toys from outer space and that there may really be indeed a very GOOD REASON why the military/government covers up the UFO/ET mess.",5,An amazing film that takes you from Roswell to the Pentagon,972259200,"10 23, 2000",2000,3363,"['First', 'off', 'entire', 'UFO', 'scene', 'corroded', 'quot', 'nit-pickers', 'quot', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'proven', 'cookies', 'exist', 'grocery', 'store', 'much', 'anything', 'more', 'quot', 'have', 'proof', 'cookies', 'are', 'always', 'cookie', 'aisle', 'sometimes', 'are', 'seen', 'dairy', 'department..', 'quot', 'Essentially', 'are', 'wannabe-lawyers', 'practical', 'information', 'live', 'life', 'real', 'people', 'need', 'good-enough', 'information', 'act', 'film', 'just', 'probably', 'THE', 'best', 'UFO/ET', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'made', 'yet', 'better', 'E.T.', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'other', 'fairy', 'tales', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'Roswell', '1947', 'Major', 'Jesse', 'Marcel', 'runs-with-it', 'full', 'conclusion', 'worse-case-scenario', 'indeed', 'alien', 'craft', 'crashed', 'there', 'etc', 'exciting', 'dramatic', 'way', 'see', 'how', 'truth', 'covered', 'up', 'intimidation', 'career', 'will', 'be', 'ruined', 'fear', 'how', 'military/government', 'was', 'scared', 'white', 'UFO/ET', 'phenomena', 'should', 'be', 'Civilians', 'who', 'seek', 'courtroom-level', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'open-ness', 'quot', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'big', 'differance', 'National', 'Security', 'feel-good', 'debating', 'society.The', 'film', 'works', 'many', 'levels', 'authentic', '1940s', 'look/feel', 'excellent', 'music', 'key', 'idea', 'general', 'concept', 'cover-up', 'do', 'men', 'who', 'hid', 'truth', 'do', 'when', 'get', 'old', 'are', 'ready', 'die', 'Do', 'talk', 'Noone', 'had', 'asked', 'question', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Colonel', 'Philip', 'Corso', 'wrote', 'book', 'end', 'Army', 'R', 'amp', 'D', 'developer', 'Day', 'Roswell', 'just', 'died', 'question', 'someone', 'hid', 'truth', 'young', 'man', 'would', 'listen', 'old', 'man', 'nothing-to-lose', 'are', 'wannabe', 'lawyers', 'mentality', 'certainly', 'will', 'be', 'legalistic', 'not', 'listen', 'folks', 'have', 'ruined', 'quot', 'credibility', 'quot', 'Real', 'people', 'not', 'UFOlawyers', 'understand', 'time', 'war', 'have', 'lie', 'times', 'protect', 'common', 'good', 'people/situations', 'change', 'life', 'ways', 'struggle', 'when', 'time', 'right', 'truth', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'revealed', 'USAF', 'already', 'lied', 'least', 'twice', 'about', 'Roswell', 'Weather', 'balloons', 'lately', 'parachute', 'dummies', 'should', 'tell', 'something', 'not', 'what', 'say', 'was', 'project', 'MOGUL', 'sensor', 'balloons', 'monitor', 'Russian', 'A-Bomb', 'test', 'geee', 'big', 'deal', 'Russians', 'declared', 'had', 'quot', 'bomb', 'quot', 'most', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'ran', 'stratosphere', 'measure', 'radiation', 'Why', 'secrecy', 'now', 'then', 'have', 'spy', 'satellites', 'everyone', 'world', 'known', 'SPUTNIK', 'not', 'surveillance', 'methodology', 'tidbit', 'knew', 'Russians', 'were', 'testing', 'A-Bombs', 'was', 'worth', 'hiding/deceiving', 'about', 'Why', 'use', 'stretchers', 'carry', 'parachute', 'dummies', 'simply', 'throw', 'over', 'shoulder', 'walk.The', 'most', 'compelling', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'Secretary', 'Defense', 'Forrestal', 'so-called', 'ET', 'consider', 'fact', 'later', 'jumped', 'window', 'assistance', 'death', 'murder', 'Suggest', 'read', 'Corso', 'book', 'conjunction', 'video', 'consider', 'quot', 'beings', 'quot', 'are', 'manifesting', 'are', 'NOT', 'cuddly', 'Spielberg', 'outer', 'space', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'indeed', 'very', 'GOOD', 'REASON', 'why', 'military/government', 'up', 'UFO/ET', 'mess']",N/A

It tells the story very well, and it tells the story based on facts. It's not a typical alien abduction movie, nor is it a documentary, it's kind of in between.I find it chilling that one of the aliens say ""There are more coming, not like me. Different races, many species""... It's hard to tell if this was a warning or not. Maybe they really are coming, and maybe they are still on the way. Hell, this was only 50 years ago and we all know that traveling through space takes hundreds or thousands of years, depending on the type of technology used.In any case, this was a very good move. It's very rare, and out of print for over 10 years. It's becoming harder and hader to find. So if you are interested in adding this to your collection, do it now, before it's too late. Most of the remaining copies for sale are used, and most aren't in that good of condition.Also, this movie was intended to be released in exclusively in Canada, and was rated and regioned for Canada.
