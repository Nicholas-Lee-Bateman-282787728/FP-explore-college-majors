911136,A1GGATN5TGXQ5,B0009RQRR4,A. C. Johnson,"[0, 0]","This is a great episode of Mister Rogers, because it shows him trying to do an ""experiment"" and failing at it. Mister Rogers actually gets visibly frustrated while trying to make a rainbow appear and thus the show is a fantastic springboard for talking about when things don't go according to plan. In ""make believe"" a character encounters his own frustration when he is unable, at first, to make a rainbow appear in the sky. In the end everyone is able to make a rainbow and to top it off there is a great factory video of a gold mine.",5,Making A Rainbow,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,536,"['great', 'episode', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'trying', 'do', 'experiment', 'failing', 'Mister', 'Rogers', 'actually', 'visibly', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'make', 'rainbow', 'appear', 'thus', 'show', 'fantastic', 'springboard', 'talking', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'make', 'believe', 'character', 'own', 'frustration', 'when', 'unable', 'first', 'make', 'rainbow', 'appear', 'sky', 'end', 'everyone', 'able', 'make', 'rainbow', 'top', 'off', 'great', 'factory', 'video', 'gold', 'mine']",Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - Going to School

Educational, warm, and fun. Not only did I learn English from the show, but American manners and culture...things I could not learn at home since my parents were immigrants as well. Mr. Rogers always had such positive messages in the show with his singing. Even though I grew up feeling different as an immigrant, watching heartwarming shows like this made me feel very loved. Now I'm an American citizen and my husband and I are serving in the military stationed overseas.

911143,A2S8TS1ZHTH61M,B0009RQRR4,Sunnie Skies,"[17, 20]","Mr. Rogers brings the purity and sincerity to a new generation. As in the newer children's programs of today where there is content that is objectionable for little eyes to see and little ears to hear, Mr. Rogers is an anchor for today's innocent children.I bought this for my three year old grandson and he loves the programs. This video is no exception and proves to be one that sends the message that each child is indeed very special and is accepted just as he/she is.  It has all the elements of honesty and and is appealing with the sounds of the trolly, the puppets, and the gentle, loving voice and face of Mr. Rogers.

911144,A3E06BCCD0AU7B,B0009RQRR4,"sunny swimmer ""sunny swimmer""","[52, 58]","Please note that the other reviewers of this item entered reviews for a different epoisode of Mr. Rogers, and not episode #1481, which called is called ""Competition"". There is nothing about going to school on this DVD, and it does not come with a toy.My three-year old son and I are both enormous fans of Mr. Rogers and own the first week of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood on DVD, as well as the Friendship/Love DVD and Circus Time DVD. All those DVDs are wonderful in that the single episodes hold together and don't leave a lot of unanswered questions (to be answered in a follow on episode).I was hesitant to buy this DVD not only because it was a single 1/2 hour episode for ten dollars, but more because I was concerned it would not hold together conceptually because Mr. Rogers shows ran for half an hour a day for a full week to bring an idea or event to full fruition at the conclusion of a five-episode week. My fears were justified. About six (very interesting minutes) of this DVD is an overview of a crayon factory. The rest of the DVD is equal parts Mr. Rogers drawing with crayons at an easel, and time spent in the Neighborhood of Make Believe preparing for King Friday's art competition. Lady Elaine is certain she will win The Competition because she wants to. She goes so far as to say angrily ""I HATE to lose, I hate it!"" and ""people like you when you win!"" Miss Cow is uncertain how an art contest can even be judged, since art is subjective. Clearly the episode was setting the stage for teaching children about competition, losing, winning, and what art really is. And then just like that, the 30 minutes is over and none of those issues are explained or resolved. My three-year old walked away from that episode hearing that ""people like you better when you win"", and also having learned the word ""hate"". No follow-through, no positive life lesson, no teaching moments. Though I love Mr. Rogers, I will never buy a single episode again and certainly don't recommend anyone else do either. Incidently, the quality of the DVD is a little off in the images are a little jerky and jumpy (it's subtle, but it's there).Perhaps I am nave, but I really cannot imagine that Fred Rogers would approve of his shows being sold as single DVDs at such a high price. The episodes just don't hold together on their own because they were designed to move slowly and to unfold AS A GROUP over a full week to culminate in lessons that are lasting and meaningful, which takes time. Further, selling single episodes is a terrible waste of resources (plastic packaging, cardboard for shipping, etc), which I don't believe Mr. Rogers would have been supporive of. The only reason these these episodes are sold singly is greed, and the result is damaging to the quality of Mr. Rogers' messages and legacy, and to the environment as well.",2,(Review of #1481: Competition) Sadly disappointing dvd,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",2011,2830,"['Please', 'note', 'other', 'reviewers', 'item', 'entered', 'reviews', 'different', 'epoisode', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'not', 'episode', '1481', 'called', 'called', 'Competition', 'nothing', 'about', 'going', 'school', 'DVD', 'not', 'come', 'toy.My', 'three-year', 'old', 'son', 'are', 'enormous', 'fans', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'own', 'first', 'week', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'Neighborhood', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'Friendship/Love', 'DVD', 'Circus', 'Time', 'DVD', 'DVDs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'single', 'episodes', 'hold', 'together', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'lot', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'be', 'answered', 'follow', 'episode', '.I', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'single', '1/2', 'hour', 'episode', 'ten', 'dollars', 'more', 'was', 'concerned', 'would', 'not', 'hold', 'together', 'conceptually', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'ran', 'hour', 'day', 'full', 'week', 'bring', 'idea', 'event', 'full', 'fruition', 'conclusion', 'five-episode', 'week', 'fears', 'were', 'justified', 'six', 'very', 'interesting', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'overview', 'crayon', 'factory', 'rest', 'DVD', 'equal', 'parts', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'drawing', 'crayons', 'easel', 'time', 'spent', 'Neighborhood', 'Make', 'Believe', 'preparing', 'King', 'Friday', 'art', 'competition', 'Lady', 'Elaine', 'certain', 'will', 'win', 'Competition', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'angrily', 'HATE', 'lose', 'hate', 'people', 'when', 'win', 'Miss', 'Cow', 'uncertain', 'how', 'art', 'contest', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'judged', 'art', 'subjective', 'Clearly', 'episode', 'was', 'setting', 'stage', 'teaching', 'children', 'competition', 'losing', 'winning', 'what', 'art', 'really', 'then', 'just', '30', 'minutes', 'none', 'issues', 'are', 'explained', 'resolved', 'three-year', 'old', 'walked', 'away', 'episode', 'hearing', 'people', 'better', 'when', 'win', 'also', 'having', 'learned', 'word', 'hate', 'follow-through', 'positive', 'life', 'lesson', 'teaching', 'moments', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'will', 'never', 'buy', 'single', 'episode', 'again', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else', 'do', 'Incidently', 'quality', 'DVD', 'little', 'off', 'images', 'are', 'little', 'jerky', 'jumpy', 'subtle', 'there', '.Perhaps', 'am', 'nave', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'Fred', 'Rogers', 'would', 'approve', 'shows', 'being', 'sold', 'single', 'DVDs', 'high', 'price', 'episodes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'together', 'own', 'were', 'designed', 'move', 'slowly', 'unfold', 'A', 'GROUP', 'full', 'week', 'culminate', 'lessons', 'are', 'lasting', 'meaningful', 'time', 'Further', 'selling', 'single', 'episodes', 'terrible', 'waste', 'resources', 'plastic', 'packaging', 'cardboard', 'shipping', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'supporive', 'only', 'reason', 'episodes', 'are', 'sold', 'singly', 'greed', 'result', 'damaging', 'quality', 'Mr.', 'Rogers', 'messages', 'legacy', 'environment', 'as', 'well']",Mister Rogers' Neighborhood - Going to School
