1093161,AAZRWLML88IZK,B000U1ZV2G,A kids review,"[1, 2]","""October Road"" opens on a photo of Kurt Cobain , but don't expect to find much rock 'n' roll in this humdrum prodigal-son soap opera. I kept waiting for the unexpected beat, the surprising plot riff, the inverted cliche , but they never came. The drama just plodded predictably down the middle of the road, uninspired, witless, tired.In some ways, ""October Road"" is like ""Ed,"" only without the oddball rhythms or the sly, sunny presence of Tom Cavanagh . A man goes home again -- to a postcard-quaint town, a few early pals, and a woman with whom he has unfinished business. Nick left girlfriend Hannah in 1997, promising he'd be back from Europe in six weeks. Ten years later, he still hasn't shown his face in town, and, worse, he has written a bestselling novel with unflattering portrayals of his friends.In short, he's a cowardly narcissist, although at times it's not clear to what extent the show's executive producers, writer Scott Rosenberg and director Gary Fleder , are aware of that. Nick decides to leave New York and move back in with his widower father, to start tying up loose ends. Typically, his motivation is self-centered: He has writer's block. He thinks that resolving his past will enable him to move forward with a new novel. But maybe he'll grow up, too, and maybe he can win back the girl, although Hannah is still furious at him and, of course, dating his nemesis, Ray ""Big Cat"" Cataldo.Greenberg, one of the actors in HBO's semi-reality series ""Unscripted,"" pays Nick with a tormented sincerity that rivals Dawson in the early years of ""Dawson's Creek."" By the second episode of ""October Road,"" when the cant of emo-lite on the soundtrack is interrupted for Jackson Browne's ""The Pretender,"" the volume of Nick's world-weary earnestness is a little too loud. When he later tries to get a teaching job by singing ""Where Is Love"" from ""Oliver!"" on the lawn outside the dean's bedroom in the middle of the night, his emotional telegraphing is just deafening.Naturally, Nick left behind a few quirky working-class buddies, one of whom, Eddie, is particularly hurt by the way he was portrayed in Nick's novel. Nick still plays air guitar to Thin Lizzy and Boston with the guys, but he is most focused on Hannah, now the single mother of a 9-year-old -- hint, hint -- boy named Sam.Nick has his suspicions about Sam, and he pursues them with nary a concern for the well-being of the kid. This being one of those perfectly Hallmark New England towns that only exist on TV, Sam is precocious, of course, and cloyingly so because, as Hannah explains, he prefers ""wise beyond his years"" to ""precocious.""Prepon emerges from the rampant self-involvement and mediocrity with the most dignity. She blows Greenberg away in their dramatic scenes. She always seemed too grown-up for ""That '70s Show,"" and she fits into a more adult context nicely. If anything in ""October Road"" survives, I hope it's her.",1,"I kept waiting for the unexpected beat, the surprising plot riff, the inverted cliche , but they never came.",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,2915,"['October', 'Road', 'photo', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'much', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'humdrum', 'prodigal-son', 'soap', 'opera', 'kept', 'waiting', 'unexpected', 'beat', 'surprising', 'plot', 'riff', 'inverted', 'cliche', 'never', 'came', 'drama', 'just', 'plodded', 'predictably', 'middle', 'road', 'uninspired', 'witless', 'tired.In', 'ways', 'October', 'Road', 'Ed', 'only', 'oddball', 'rhythms', 'sly', 'sunny', 'presence', 'Tom', 'Cavanagh', 'man', 'home', 'again', 'postcard-quaint', 'town', 'few', 'early', 'pals', 'woman', 'whom', 'unfinished', 'business', 'Nick', 'left', 'girlfriend', 'Hannah', '1997', 'promising', ""'d"", 'be', 'back', 'Europe', 'six', 'weeks', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'still', ""n't"", 'shown', 'face', 'town', 'worse', 'written', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'unflattering', 'portrayals', 'friends.In', 'short', 'cowardly', 'narcissist', 'times', 'not', 'clear', 'what', 'extent', 'show', 'executive', 'producers', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Rosenberg', 'director', 'Gary', 'Fleder', 'are', 'aware', 'Nick', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'move', 'back', 'widower', 'father', 'start', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Typically', 'motivation', 'self-centered', 'writer', 'block', 'resolving', 'past', 'will', 'enable', 'move', 'forward', 'new', 'novel', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'up', 'too', 'maybe', 'can', 'win', 'back', 'girl', 'Hannah', 'still', 'furious', 'course', 'dating', 'nemesis', 'Ray', 'Big', 'Cat', 'Cataldo.Greenberg', 'one', 'actors', 'HBO', 'semi-reality', 'series', 'Unscripted', 'Nick', 'tormented', 'sincerity', 'rivals', 'Dawson', 'early', 'years', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'second', 'episode', 'October', 'Road', 'when', 'cant', 'emo-lite', 'soundtrack', 'interrupted', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'Pretender', 'volume', 'Nick', 'world-weary', 'earnestness', 'little', 'too', 'loud', 'When', 'later', 'get', 'teaching', 'job', 'singing', 'Where', 'Love', 'Oliver', 'lawn', 'dean', 'bedroom', 'middle', 'night', 'emotional', 'telegraphing', 'just', 'deafening.Naturally', 'Nick', 'left', 'behind', 'few', 'quirky', 'working-class', 'buddies', 'one', 'whom', 'Eddie', 'particularly', 'hurt', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Nick', 'novel', 'Nick', 'still', 'air', 'guitar', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'Boston', 'guys', 'most', 'focused', 'Hannah', 'now', 'single', 'mother', '9-year-old', 'hint', 'hint', 'boy', 'named', 'Sam.Nick', 'suspicions', 'Sam', 'concern', 'well-being', 'kid', 'being', 'one', 'perfectly', 'Hallmark', 'New', 'England', 'only', 'exist', 'TV', 'Sam', 'precocious', 'course', 'cloyingly', 'so', 'because', 'Hannah', 'wise', 'years', 'precocious', 'Prepon', 'rampant', 'self-involvement', 'mediocrity', 'most', 'dignity', 'Greenberg', 'away', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'always', 'seemed', 'too', 'grown-up', 'Show', 'more', 'adult', 'context', 'nicely', 'anything', 'October', 'Road', 'hope']",October Road: Season 1

1093172,A1WSFHRBY2ZD1R,B000U1ZV2G,"T. Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[18, 23]","""October Road"" was not suppose to be a hit.  It wasn't even suppose to be a series.  After filming the pilot in the winter of 2005, ABC initially passed on the series during their selections for a fall line-up.  But in January of 2007, in a last minute decision (and in desperate need of new material with the up-coming writer's strike) ABC greenlite 5 additional episodes.  And then something crazy happened.  The show premiered and over 14 million people watched its first season.""October Road"" while not a great series by any stretch, is definitely a worthy addition to ABC's lineup.  But unfortunately it has the fatal flaw of thinking that it is much more original and better written than it really is.  The characters are likeable enough, but they are all characters that we have seen many times before, and the series has yet to add anything new or fresh into the mix.  And the same can really be said about the premise of the series.  The main idea is that ""you can never go home again,"" but this is a theme that is continuously used in the latter years of long running series.  But ""October Road"" fails to be as poigagnt as it wants because their isn't enough emotional investment with the characters that is required for the storylines to be particularly impacting or emotional.But alas, what ABC has presented here are 6 very well produced, acted, and edited episodes that together make up a first season of a series that shows promise, but needs serious work (and with the season 2 ratings being half of its premier audience, they need to work fast).The series itself focuses on a young author, who returns to his hometown for the first time in nearly a decade.  He originally left for a trip to Europe, but for one reason or another he decided to never return, leaving behind several friends, a girlfriend, and his father. In the 10 years, Nick has written a very revealing novel (akin to ""The Catcher and the Rye"") that does not paint his friends in a very flattering light.  Eventually, Nick is asked by the college in his hometown to come back to do a seminar, and upon returning home, he decides to stay and try to get inspired for his next novel.The ultimate flaw of the series is that it is just unrealistic for this story to be taken seriously in 2007.  Even in 1997 when Nick left there was email, cell phones, and plane tickets.  Why would he stay away for 10 years, and why would nobody ever tell him that his high school sweetheart happened to have a kid almost exactly 9 months after he left, etc.  But anyway, Buena Vista has included all 6 episodes on 2 discs along with a making-of featurette and deleted scenes.",4,Can you Ever Go Home Again?,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2640,"['October', 'Road', 'was', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'hit', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'suppose', 'be', 'series', 'filming', 'pilot', 'winter', '2005', 'ABC', 'initially', 'passed', 'series', 'selections', 'fall', 'line-up', 'January', '2007', 'last', 'minute', 'decision', 'desperate', 'need', 'new', 'material', 'up-coming', 'writer', 'strike', 'ABC', '5', 'additional', 'episodes', 'then', 'something', 'crazy', 'happened', 'show', 'premiered', '14', 'million', 'people', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'October', 'Road', 'not', 'great', 'series', 'stretch', 'definitely', 'worthy', 'addition', 'ABC', 'lineup', 'unfortunately', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'thinking', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'better', 'written', 'really', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'enough', 'are', 'characters', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'series', 'yet', 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'fresh', 'mix', 'same', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'premise', 'series', 'main', 'idea', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'theme', 'continuously', 'used', 'latter', 'years', 'long', 'running', 'series', 'October', 'Road', 'be', 'as', 'poigagnt', ""n't"", 'enough', 'emotional', 'investment', 'characters', 'required', 'storylines', 'be', 'particularly', 'impacting', 'emotional.But', 'alas', 'what', 'ABC', 'presented', 'here', 'are', '6', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'acted', 'edited', 'episodes', 'together', 'make', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'promise', 'serious', 'work', 'season', '2', 'ratings', 'being', 'half', 'premier', 'audience', 'need', 'work', 'fast', '.The', 'series', 'young', 'author', 'who', 'hometown', 'first', 'time', 'nearly', 'decade', 'originally', 'left', 'trip', 'Europe', 'one', 'reason', 'decided', 'never', 'return', 'leaving', 'several', 'friends', 'girlfriend', 'father', '10', 'years', 'Nick', 'written', 'very', 'revealing', 'novel', 'akin', 'Catcher', 'Rye', 'not', 'paint', 'friends', 'very', 'flattering', 'light', 'Eventually', 'Nick', 'asked', 'college', 'hometown', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'seminar', 'returning', 'home', 'stay', 'try', 'get', 'inspired', 'next', 'novel.The', 'ultimate', 'flaw', 'series', 'just', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', '2007', 'Even', '1997', 'when', 'Nick', 'left', 'was', 'email', 'cell', 'phones', 'plane', 'tickets', 'Why', 'would', 'stay', 'away', '10', 'years', 'why', 'would', 'nobody', 'ever', 'tell', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'happened', 'have', 'kid', 'almost', 'exactly', '9', 'months', 'left', 'etc', 'anyway', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'included', '6', 'episodes', '2', 'discs', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes']",October Road: Season 1
