949208,A23JNLBAE18XO0,B000BT96OG,Frank R. Schoonover,"[4, 5]","The Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collection Volume 2 is yet another wonderful set in the same way as Volume 1 is wonderful. It features the final nine episodes of the first season and the first eighteen episodes of the second season. This series premiered on the CBS TV network in 1962 and ran for a total of nine seasons. For the first two seasons, this was the #1 watched show on TV. It has also been rerun in syndication lots of times and as a result of that, many new fans have discovered the series and became part of this unique pop culture phenomenon known as The Beverly Hillbillies. Volume 2 offers more of the same and then some of this wonderful, classic and still as funny as heck TV show.This DVD set, like it's predecessor and it's follow-up, offers episodes that have been digitally remastered using the original episode negative that are owned by the estate of the late Paul Henning for not only superb quality, but far more superior quality than of those previously issued public domain DVD sets. Likewise, it is also the only set that is approved of and authorized by the estate of the late Paul Henning. It also has original cast sponsor commercials. Episode commentary by Stephen Cox, who is the author of the novel called The Beverly Hillbillies Book. It also has interviews with the cast members and special footage. Volume 2 offers the rest of the first season and the first half of the second season as this also makes mincemeat out of all those public domain issued DVD sets. It is also, alongside it's predecessor and it's follow-up The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Ultimate Christmas Collection, the definitive Beverly Hillbillies set as it has all the stuff that those public domain DVD sets lacked and also missed. It is also well worth the price that you pay for them.MPI Home Video does a wonderful job with Volume 2 and it's predecessor and it's follow-up. As stated, the episodes are digitally remastered from the original episode negatives owned by the Paul Henning estate for superb and superior quality. The episodes audio sounds great and also, the episodes look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were initially shown on the CBS TV network. It doesn't get any better than this.This and it's predecessor and it's follow-up, are THE ones to have and own in your DVD library. Whether you watched it during it's first run or discovered the show in syndicated reruns like myself, this set is THE one to own and to keep. Once you have this and it's aforementioned Ultimate Christmas Collection, you will never watch those public domain DVD sets anymore. In fact, you just might get rid of those public domain DVD sets once you have these. Likewise, this is THE best collection yet and again, MPI Home Video does a wonderful job on this set.This is THE one set to own alongside Volume 1 and the aforementioned Ultimate Christmas Collection. No true blue Beverly Hillbillies fan should be without this set in their DVD library.",5,"LIkewise, The Way That It Was Meant To Be Issued.

Too bad they didn't work a deal with Paramount for access to the 35mm fine grain negatives!That said, the extras are great!  And I am glad they restored the origional sponsored titles!  ""K E doulble-L O double-Good Kelloggs best to you"" is sung by Earl as part of the opening theme as the Clampetts drive past a Kellogg's billboard (in Beverly Hills?).  Other episodes have the Clampetts pass a large truck with a WINSTON ad on it's side, the goodness of cigarettes is sung as part of the opening theme.The cast commercials have been removed from the shows and stuck back-to-back on disc 4 as an extra.  I am glad to have these as they brought back fond memories, but since these were story specific (the story line is carried over as the concept for the commercial) I would have prefered these to be left intact in the episodes they played in.It is quite out of character to see the Clampetts talking of the goodness of Winston Cigarettes!The 1966 interview with Irene Ryan on Art Linkletter's show is also priceless.
