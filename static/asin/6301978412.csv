287681,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301978412,Douglas M,"[6, 6]","In 1931, Joan Crawford was rapidly reaching a box office peak. ""Possessed"" might well be the best film she made in this period, with the exception of ""Grand Hotel"". She stars as Marion who breaks away from her small town and heads to New York becoming Mrs Moreland, the mistress of prominent lawyer and politician Clark Gable. Crawford became famous as the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who crossed over and at this point in her career, the formula was not cliched. This was a film which really tested the censorship and there is at least one moment when the dialogue heard does not match the lips of the actors. Crawford looks stunning and while she overacts at times with her trademark burning conviction, she is warm and has obvious chemistry with Clark Gable with whom she was heavily involved off-screen at the time. Gable is before his prime, stiff, wooden and unconvincing as a very up-market professional.The film has been released as one of the Warner's Archive Collection which means it is unrestored with no extras and very expensive. In this case, the print is not good with a lot of dirt and popping. Furthermore, the photography lacks clarity and the soundtrack is sometimes fuzzy for this is an early talkie.",3,Crawford pre-code classic but poor print,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1232,"['1931', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'rapidly', 'reaching', 'box', 'office', 'peak', 'Possessed', 'might', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'made', 'period', 'exception', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Marion', 'who', 'away', 'small', 'town', 'heads', 'New', 'York', 'becoming', 'Mrs', 'Moreland', 'mistress', 'prominent', 'lawyer', 'politician', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Crawford', 'became', 'famous', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'crossed', 'over', 'point', 'career', 'formula', 'was', 'not', 'cliched', 'was', 'film', 'really', 'tested', 'censorship', 'least', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'dialogue', 'heard', 'not', 'match', 'lips', 'actors', 'Crawford', 'stunning', 'times', 'trademark', 'burning', 'conviction', 'warm', 'obvious', 'chemistry', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'whom', 'was', 'heavily', 'involved', 'off-screen', 'time', 'Gable', 'prime', 'stiff', 'wooden', 'unconvincing', 'very', 'up-market', 'professional.The', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'one', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'Collection', 'unrestored', 'extras', 'very', 'expensive', 'case', 'print', 'not', 'good', 'lot', 'dirt', 'popping', 'Furthermore', 'photography', 'clarity', 'soundtrack', 'sometimes', 'fuzzy', 'early', 'talkie']",N/A

Only an actress who's career spanned 6 decades can play in two pictures, in two different decades with the same title. (BTW, in case you're wondering ""Possessed"" from 1947 is much better with a totally different plot.) In 1931 Joan stared in 4 major motion pictures, (3 with Clark Gable) and ""Possessed"" was certainly the one that cemented them in history as one of the most beloved and intriguing movie couples. Because they each had such a genuine endearment and chemistry in this picture. ""Possessed"" follows the standard Joan Crawford/MGM story...Beautiful girl meets handsome boy, doesn't know what to do about her past;in the end finds happiness... But this picture is especially memorable because MGM teams Joan with Clark Gable. They were always magical to watch together. They both always lit up the screen, because anyone could tell that when Joan looked into Clark Gable's eyes she had fire in hers. Joan's brief comments on the making of this film: Back with Clark, both of us in strong parts, great reviews. Clearance Brown again, thank God. The movie also reminds me of ""The Bride Wore Red"" (another of Joan's classics) because Marian (Joan's character) decides to reinvent herself as a woman of society to lure her man into her web; she doesn't want anyone to find out her true identity because if they do they will see that she was just a shopgirl who had nothing but a pretty face and a kind heart.

Will this affair ever lead to marriage?The plot and story line is sharp and believable, the direction by Clarence Brown is good with some incredibly lavish settings. Crawford and Gable are just perfect in their parts looking terrific doing it.Crawford is strong and likable as she moves from factory girl to ""kept woman,"" apparently without missing a beat.Gable playing a somewhat subservient role, gets to strut his stuff.

287685,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,6301978412,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[1, 2]","Every time Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made a movie together, magic happened. This was partly because they were in love offscreen, but also because they were so much alike. Both had humble beginnings and became superstars, as well as legends. It's easy to detect their chemistry--every scene sizzles with a sexual and romantic undercurrent, even when not written in the script.In the 1931 hit POSSESSED, Joan plays a gold-digger who leaves behind poor factory life and moves to the big city in search of love and happiness. She is told the only way she will survive is if she hooks a rich man. In walks a handsome millionaire (Clark Gable)--and the fireworks begin!This is Joan Crawford at her most youthful and appealing. She was never more beautiful or glamorous--except, perhaps, in what I consider to be another radiant performance, as Lane Bellamy in Flamingo Road.  Joan sings, laughs, and smiles through her tears--as only she could do so gloriously.  Gable is pitch-perfect as the would-be governor willing to give up the opportunity for his love--of Joan, a woman considered under his class.She decides to sacrifice her love for his career, and leaves him, but love eventually brings them back together in a teriffic scene in which Gable gives a passionate speech. When the rumor of an illicit affair threatens to ruin his election possibilities, Joan stands up in the audience and proudly professes that love is not a crime and that Gable was able to love a woman such as her, against all odds, was proof he was a great man. The crowd applauds and Joan runs away into the pouring rain, crying, to be followed by Gable who tells her winning or losing is not important as long as they are together.  It's a beautiful film about doing what is right and following your heart.",5,Crawford and Gable--what a match!,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",2005,1783,"['time', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'made', 'movie', 'together', 'magic', 'happened', 'was', 'partly', 'were', 'love', 'offscreen', 'also', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'alike', 'had', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'became', 'superstars', 'as', 'well', 'legends', 'easy', 'detect', 'chemistry', 'scene', 'sexual', 'romantic', 'undercurrent', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'written', 'script.In', '1931', 'hit', 'POSSESSED', 'Joan', 'gold-digger', 'who', 'poor', 'factory', 'life', 'moves', 'big', 'city', 'search', 'love', 'happiness', 'told', 'only', 'way', 'will', 'survive', 'rich', 'man', 'walks', 'handsome', 'millionaire', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'fireworks', 'begin', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'most', 'youthful', 'appealing', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'beautiful', 'glamorous', 'perhaps', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'radiant', 'performance', 'Lane', 'Bellamy', 'Flamingo', 'Road', 'Joan', 'sings', 'laughs', 'smiles', 'tears', 'only', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'gloriously', 'Gable', 'pitch-perfect', 'would-be', 'governor', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'opportunity', 'love', 'Joan', 'woman', 'considered', 'class.She', 'sacrifice', 'love', 'career', 'love', 'eventually', 'back', 'together', 'teriffic', 'scene', 'Gable', 'passionate', 'speech', 'When', 'rumor', 'illicit', 'affair', 'ruin', 'election', 'possibilities', 'Joan', 'up', 'audience', 'proudly', 'love', 'not', 'crime', 'Gable', 'was', 'able', 'love', 'woman', 'such', 'odds', 'was', 'proof', 'was', 'great', 'man', 'crowd', 'applauds', 'Joan', 'away', 'pouring', 'rain', 'crying', 'be', 'followed', 'Gable', 'who', 'winning', 'losing', 'not', 'important', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'together', 'beautiful', 'film', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'following', 'heart']",N/A
287686,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6301978412,Lawyeraau,"[2, 3]","This is a superlative film in which Joan Crawford gives the performance of a lifetime. This 1947 film opens with an disoriented woman (Joan Crawford) wandering the streets of Los Angeles and searching for someone named David. She is ultimately brought to the psychiatric ward of a hospital for evaluation, after she collapses. She is now catatonic.The film then flashes back to those events that brought her to that state. It turns out that she is Louise Howell. She had an affair with David Sutton (Van Heflin), a man who treated her badly and did not return her love. For him, she was just a fling, while for her, he was more, much more. She smothered him and obsessed over him. This is the beginning of her slow descent into another reality.Her marriage to a wealthy man (Raymon Massey) sets into motion a series of events that over time cause Louise's already tenuous grip on reality to loosen even more. Louise's obsession with her former lover finally takes her over the edge into the unchartered territory of a paranoid schitzophrenic with most unfortunate consequences for David.Ms. Crawford's performance of a woman descending into the snakepit of madness is a wonder to behold. One senses her tenuous grip on reality. One feels her face life with trepidation, and her fear and confusion is palpable. This is certainly one of Ms. Crawford's best and most poignant performances. The viewer gets the sense that Ms. Crawford poured her heart and soul into this magnificent performance.Joan Crawford fans and lovers of classic movies will enjoy this engrossing film.",5,FATAL ATTRACTION NINETEEN FORTIES STYLE...,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,1571,"['superlative', 'film', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'performance', 'lifetime', '1947', 'film', 'disoriented', 'woman', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'wandering', 'streets', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'searching', 'someone', 'named', 'David', 'ultimately', 'brought', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'hospital', 'evaluation', 'now', 'catatonic.The', 'film', 'then', 'back', 'events', 'brought', 'state', 'out', 'Louise', 'Howell', 'had', 'affair', 'David', 'Sutton', 'Van', 'Heflin', 'man', 'who', 'treated', 'badly', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'love', 'was', 'just', 'fling', 'was', 'more', 'much', 'more', 'smothered', 'obsessed', 'beginning', 'slow', 'descent', 'reality.Her', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'man', 'Raymon', 'Massey', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'over', 'time', 'cause', 'Louise', 'already', 'tenuous', 'grip', 'reality', 'loosen', 'even', 'more', 'Louise', 'obsession', 'former', 'lover', 'finally', 'edge', 'unchartered', 'territory', 'paranoid', 'schitzophrenic', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'consequences', 'David.Ms', 'Crawford', 'performance', 'woman', 'descending', 'snakepit', 'madness', 'wonder', 'behold', 'One', 'tenuous', 'grip', 'reality', 'One', 'face', 'life', 'trepidation', 'fear', 'confusion', 'palpable', 'certainly', 'one', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'best', 'most', 'poignant', 'performances', 'viewer', 'sense', 'Ms.', 'Crawford', 'poured', 'heart', 'soul', 'magnificent', 'performance.Joan', 'Crawford', 'fans', 'lovers', 'classic', 'movies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'engrossing', 'film']",N/A

Much earlier, there was the Crawford who could sing, dance, smile sweetly, and generally stun you with her expressive eyes and laughter. In THE POSSESSED, she plays Marian, a sort of role that looks forward to the future tougher women who could kick back her tormentors with relish. Marian is what was then gently known as a 'gold digger' whose rough edges hid the basic sweetness that few were permitted to suspect existed. In walks Mark Whitman (Clark Gable), a young and powerful lawyer whose star is clearly on the ascendant. Gable's role of a tough and smart leading man set the stage for many such roles that would culminate in 1939 with Rhett Butler in GONE WITH THE WIND. Whitman and Marian like each other, but because she had an inapprorpiate backgroud, they had to keep their connection quiet. When Whitman is offered the chance to be governor, she realizes that her presence could be a liability so she bows out. There is a terrific scene near the end in which he is going to give a speech at a town meeting hall. His rival for the election has ordered his goons to heckle Whitman. Gable's manly response to the hecklers and Crawford's defense of her relationship to him is a gem that perfectly captures the chemistry that reflected their off-screen affair.

287690,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6301978412,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Possessed is a fine drama with lots of great acting and more. Joan Crawford gives a stunning performance as a poor working class girl who goes to the big city (New York) to find a rich man and take him for what he's worth; and Clark Gable also turns in an admirable performance as the man she lays her hands on. The plot moves along at a very good pace and you'll never be bored. The cinematography is very well done throughout the film; and the choreography works best in crowd scenes including the political rally and the party scenes as well.When the action starts, we quickly meet Acme Paper Box company employees Marian Martin (Joan Crawford) and the man who loves her, Al Manning (Wallace Ford). Although Al loves her, Marina doesn't want just love. She's a gold digger through and through; and she wants to strike it rich. She happens to meet drunken playboy Wally Stuart (Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher) just as his train pulls into the local train stop with him drinking at the end of the coach car; and they wind up drinking champagne and chatting for an hour! Wallace gives Marian his card and tells her to look him up if she ever gets to New York; and Marian begins to think about it. Marian doesn't have the material things she wants; Al can't afford them and her mother (Clara Blandick) doesn't exactly have too much dough, either.Marian does make it to New York; and Wallace encourages her to find a rich man--just so long as the guy isn't a buddy of his. That doesn't matter to Marian--she actually manages to quickly hook the fabulously wealthy Mark Whitney (Clark Gable) as he enters Wallace's apartment; and they hit it off pretty fast. Three years pass by and they're having a ball; but for the sake of appearances Marian agrees to take on the alias of ""Mrs. Moreland."" That way Mark and Marian can keep their affair looking as if he's not her ""sugar daddy"" and she's not his mistress.Things begin to get complicated when Al Manning, who is now wealthy, comes unexpectedly to New York--and he's become rich himself! He wants Marian's hand now more than ever; and he falls for the story that she's been married to some guy named Moreland. Marian and Mark keep their relationship a secret from Al; and Al unwittingly makes things rocky between Marian and Mark when he tells Mark he needs his money for a highway public works project.Of course the plot can go anywhere from here. Will Marian and Mark keep their relationship a secret from Al or will they tell him the truth and send him away? What about Mark's ambition to be Governor of New York--how does that impact on his relationship with Marian? Marian may have to choose between Mark and Al; and that could be a very touch decision to make. Will Marian choose to be single once again and dump both men?

However, I have seen a number of early Joan Crawford movies lately and I was favorably impressed with her glamour and talent.  That was a pleasant surprize because she was a has-been when I saw her in her later movies.  I can't even remember the names of her later axe-murder movies although I vividly recall ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" which demeaned both her and her co-star Bette Davis.In ""Possessed"", Crawford plays a small town hick who gets a passing invitation to visit a rich playboy in New York whom she met briefly.  She decides to take him up on his invitation despite the protestations of others (including her mother played in a brief appearance by ""Auntie Em"" Clara Blandick).  Well, the offer turns out to have been inspired by champagne and Crawford finds herself too alone in the big city.  Things change and the scene turns to that of a successful concubine whose amore has to chose between love and power.  The dilemna leads to the fairly powerful conclusion.I confess that I was a bit mystified by the plot because I had mistaken this movie accidently as her 1947 version of a movie by the same name.  I kept waiting for her to start to go nuts and I was much more impressed with what I got instead.  This was a delicate subject matter for 1931 and it was interesting to see how the writer and director handled it.  Her character acquired the name ""Mrs. Moreland"" to suggest a widow or divorcee rather than a young maiden.  Better to assume that innocence was lost in the sanctity of a prior marriage than in the seduction of a...well, you get the idea.  Of course, the audience knows all this but it's interesting to see the lengths that are taken to elevate the morality of an affair.  I've seen to many great and greater movies to rate this higher than a ""3 star"" movie.

287696,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6301978412,Silver Screen,"[14, 15]","""Possessed"" was the third film pairing Joan Crawford and Clark Gable and my personal favorite of the duo's.Crawford plays Marian Martin, a young lady who works at a paper box factory but yearns for more than clocking in and out and marrying the staid but faithful Al Manning (Wallace Ford)whose biggest concern seems to be what flavor of ice cream to bring for dessert.  After getting off work one afternoon, she meets the intoxicated but wealthy Wally Stuart (Skeets Gallagher)who stokes the fire of change within Marian, causing her to leave for New York and look him up.  Once there, she meets his friend Mark Whitney (Gable), a lawyer who has been burned once by an ex-wife and is not interested in going near the flame again.  Mark and Marian begin a relationship, with Marian being redubbed ""Mrs. Moreland"" in order to protect her reputation.  (This being the early 1930s, Marian must have an explanation for her fancy apartment and nice things - - saying she is a wealthy divorcee will prevent any speculation).Things appear to go swimmingly for Mark and Marian for several years, although Marian longs to marry Mark and Mark's friends question why he doesn't marry her.  When Mark decides to run for governor and Marian overhears some well-meaning friends telling him that his relationship with Marian could prove to be an embarrassment, and suggest that he terminate the relationship, Marian does the dirty work for him and tells him that she is going to marry Al Manning, who has managed his way out of the paper box factory and into success with construction.  Once Marian tells Al about her relationship with Mark, Al is not interested in having ""used goods.""  All ends well, however, when Mark makes it clear that being governor is not as important as being with Marian.This movie was very daring for its time.  Marian, in the beginning, is nothing short of a gold digger, who knows upon coming to New York that she must become the kept woman of a wealthy man to get what she wants.  Atypical for movies of the period, she is not punished for her actions, but rewarded with a fabulous wardrobe (by Adrian), an incredible Park Avenue apartment (by Cedric Gibbons) and a decent man who loves and respects her (and looks like Clark Gable!)  Indeed, when the movie was released in 1931, some cities would not screen the flick, considering the movie scandalous and unethical and parents were encouraged to leave the kiddies at home, for such adult fare.Crawford, wonderfully attired in Adrian's stunning creations, looks absolutely stunning.  Forget the Warner Brothers Crawford of the late 1940s, with the harsh mouth and almost mannish features.  This Crawford was breathtaking, one that simply seduced the camera.  She WAS Marian - - and every other working girl out there that paid hard-earned money to see her films.  It was no wonder that the shopgirls loved her so much.  If Crawford could rise above the paper box factory and snag Gable, while looking so elegantly attired, so too, perhaps, could they.Gable, while not in his best role, does what he can with a rather one dimensional part. Rather than coming across as a rakish attorney with a kept woman on the side, who wants to have his cake and eat it too, he seems a sincere man who has been hurt once before and wants to do the right thing by everyone.Gable and Crawford were, at the time, in the midst of their own extramarital affair and at the height of their passionate love for one another and it does show in this film.  The love and affection seems genuine, as does the easiness with which they act together.While their film ""Strange Cargo"", released in 1940, got better reviews and is generally considered to be their best picture together, this film is my personal favorite and has a certain tenderness that the other films do not.As an added bonus, watch for Marian's mother in the beginning of the film - - she is played by Clara Blandick who, in 1939, would go on to immortality playing Judy Garland's Auntie Em in ""The Wizard of Oz.""",4,Crawford + Gable = Magic,1113350400,"04 13, 2005",2005,4018,"['Possessed', 'was', 'third', 'film', 'pairing', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'personal', 'favorite', ""duo's.Crawford"", 'Marian', 'Martin', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'paper', 'box', 'factory', 'yearns', 'more', 'clocking', 'marrying', 'staid', 'faithful', 'Al', 'Manning', 'Wallace', 'Ford', 'biggest', 'concern', 'be', 'what', 'flavor', 'ice', 'cream', 'bring', 'dessert', 'getting', 'off', 'work', 'one', 'afternoon', 'intoxicated', 'wealthy', 'Wally', 'Stuart', 'Skeets', 'Gallagher', 'who', 'fire', 'change', 'Marian', 'causing', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'look', 'up', 'Once', 'there', 'friend', 'Mark', 'Whitney', 'Gable', 'lawyer', 'who', 'been', 'burned', 'once', 'ex-wife', 'not', 'interested', 'going', 'flame', 'again', 'Mark', 'Marian', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Marian', 'being', 'redubbed', 'Mrs.', 'Moreland', 'order', 'protect', 'reputation', 'being', 'early', '1930s', 'Marian', 'must', 'have', 'explanation', 'fancy', 'apartment', 'nice', 'things', 'saying', 'wealthy', 'divorcee', 'will', 'prevent', 'speculation', '.Things', 'appear', 'go', 'swimmingly', 'Mark', 'Marian', 'several', 'years', 'Marian', 'longs', 'marry', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'friends', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'marry', 'When', 'Mark', 'run', 'governor', 'Marian', 'well-meaning', 'friends', 'telling', 'relationship', 'Marian', 'could', 'prove', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'suggest', 'terminate', 'relationship', 'Marian', 'dirty', 'work', 'going', 'marry', 'Al', 'Manning', 'who', 'managed', 'way', 'paper', 'box', 'factory', 'success', 'construction', 'Once', 'Marian', 'tells', 'Al', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Al', 'not', 'interested', 'having', 'used', 'goods', 'well', 'however', 'when', 'Mark', 'clear', 'being', 'governor', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'being', 'Marian.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'daring', 'time', 'Marian', 'beginning', 'nothing', 'short', 'gold', 'digger', 'who', 'coming', 'New', 'York', 'must', 'become', 'kept', 'woman', 'wealthy', 'man', 'get', 'what', 'Atypical', 'movies', 'period', 'not', 'punished', 'actions', 'rewarded', 'fabulous', 'wardrobe', 'Adrian', 'incredible', 'Park', 'Avenue', 'apartment', 'Cedric', 'Gibbons', 'decent', 'man', 'who', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Indeed', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1931', 'cities', 'would', 'not', 'screen', 'flick', 'considering', 'movie', 'scandalous', 'unethical', 'parents', 'were', 'encouraged', 'leave', 'kiddies', 'home', 'such', 'adult', 'fare.Crawford', 'wonderfully', 'attired', 'Adrian', 'stunning', 'creations', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Forget', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Crawford', 'late', '1940s', 'harsh', 'mouth', 'almost', 'mannish', 'features', 'Crawford', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'one', 'simply', 'seduced', 'camera', 'WAS', 'Marian', 'other', 'working', 'girl', 'there', 'paid', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'see', 'films', 'was', 'wonder', 'shopgirls', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'Crawford', 'could', 'rise', 'paper', 'box', 'factory', 'snag', 'Gable', 'looking', 'so', 'elegantly', 'attired', 'so', 'too', 'perhaps', 'could', 'they.Gable', 'not', 'best', 'role', 'what', 'can', 'rather', 'one', 'dimensional', 'part', 'Rather', 'coming', 'rakish', 'attorney', 'kept', 'woman', 'side', 'who', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'sincere', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'hurt', 'once', 'before', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'everyone.Gable', 'Crawford', 'were', 'time', 'midst', 'own', 'extramarital', 'affair', 'height', 'passionate', 'love', 'one', 'show', 'film', 'love', 'affection', 'genuine', 'easiness', 'act', 'film', 'Strange', 'Cargo', 'released', '1940', 'got', 'better', 'reviews', 'generally', 'considered', 'be', 'best', 'picture', 'together', 'film', 'personal', 'favorite', 'certain', 'tenderness', 'other', 'films', 'do', 'added', 'bonus', 'watch', 'Marian', 'mother', 'beginning', 'film', 'played', 'Clara', 'Blandick', 'who', '1939', 'would', 'go', 'immortality', 'playing', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'Wizard', 'Oz']",N/A
287697,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301978412,Simon Davis,"[8, 9]","The 1931 drama &quot;Possessed&quot;, which was the third onscreen meeting of MGM greats Joan Crawford and Clark Gable, was the film that really put them on the map as an acting team to be reckoned with. It paved the way for many more highly successful teamings of these two legendary performers during the 1930's at MGM. After appearing only briefly  in one of Joan Crawford's earlier 1931 starring vehicles &quot;Dance Fools Dance&quot;, Gable made such an impression on both the audience and the powers at MGM with his onscreen chemistry with Crawford that they were repeatedly teamed to great effect in many dramas and even screwball comedies. &quot;Possessed&quot;, was definately one of their better teamings and stands up beautifully even today with it's potent dialogue and believable characters.The story of &quot;Possessed&quot;, is in many ways classic Joan Crawford material detailing as it does the rise of a disgruntled factory worker in a small American town to the heights of Park Avenue society and power, with all the wealth, intrigue, men and romance that goes with it. Joan plays Marian Martin a girl seemingly doomed to a dull life  as an employee in a small town paper factory. Marion however possesses an inner drive the tells her she is cut out for more in life than the thankless existence she currently endures. Inspired by the sight of the wealthy life enjoyed by others on a train passing through town Marian decides to take the plunge and leave the awful existence she leads including the man who hopes to marry her Al Manning (Wallace Ford) and travel to New York in search of a better life. Once there Marian makes the acquaintance of rising young lawyer Mark Whitney who is being touted as the next governer of New York. Mark is instantly attracted to Marian's  absolute honesty and yearning for a better existence and very quickly the two become involved in an affair. Due to her humble background the affair is kept quiet and Marian is passed off as wealthy divorcee &quot;Mrs. Moreland&quot;. Marian learns the ways of the rich and powerful however things begin to get more complicated after a couple of years have passed when Mark is in line for the govenorship and Al suddenly turns up in New York now successful and determined to marry the still supposedly uninvolved Marian. Seeing the impossible situation she now finds herself in Marian realises that her background and &quot;keep woman status&quot;, can only be a liability to Mark's hope of the governor's role after over hearing some of his supporters urging him to get rid of her before the election takes place. She deliberately breaks up with him by pretending to be going off with Al who is &quot;one of her people and of the class she really belongs to&quot;, and walks out of his life after a heated argument. Later at one of the election rallies however when Mark's opponents have planted leaflets attacking their earlier relationship Marian rises to Mark's defence and exposes the gossip as the hateful muckraking it undoubtedly is upon which Mark comes after her promising to be with her regardless of what happens in the future.Being pre code this drama has a pleasingly realistic edge to its dialogue and storyline. In many ways it has an almost curiously modern approach to the material at hand which has allowed this film to age well over time. Joan Crawford and Clark Gable have an incredible screen chemistry in their work together in &quot;Possessed&quot;, which helped to make them one of the most successful screen teams of the 1930's decade. Destined to make eight films together &quot;Possessed&quot;, shows them as a relatively new teame but the electricity on screen and indeed off as well is very evident. Joan Crawford delivers an extremely balanced performance as Marian. She is just as convincing in the earlier factory scenes as she is in the later Park Avenue ones and her transformation from gauche working girl to society hostess is totally believable. Before he got caught in his &quot;Gable playing Gable&quot; performances Clark Gable is refreshingly restrained playing the politically hopeful Mark Whitney in &quot;Possessed&quot;. He displays a real development in his acting from earlier acting efforts even that same year and &quot;Possessed&quot;, put him on the road to superstardom before another year was out. Directed with a sure hand by talented Clarence Brown the material and performances are mature and underplayed throughout making this a viewing experience to cherish. Joan Crawford also noticeably underwent a transformation in this role appearing far more beautiful and sophisticated than in her previous work and complimented greatly by the artistry of the legendary Adrian who designed her stunning wardrobe in &quot;Possessed&quot;, to great effect. All the great MGM expertise in every department are evident in this production with Cedric Gibbon's stunning  New York interiors in particular a real stand out.&quot;Possessed&quot;, is one of the better Crawford/Gable teamings and all lovers of these performers work should not miss this film. While it contains certain elements that are a part of each performers established screen persona the formula here is not so confining yet to stifle the individuality that each brings to their characters. Crawford and Gable on screen is what Hollywood chemistry is all about and it's always a pleasure to see this great romantic team perform together.

The duo would make eight movies together, become lovers and would be life-long friends until Gable died in the early sixties.This film (not to be confused by Joan's Oscar nominated performance in 1947's ""Possessed"") tells the story of a poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks who meets the man of her dreams, a dashing New York City attorney. Probably more evident in this film than any other the chemistry between Gable and Crawford is evident. The story is well-written, well-directed and superbly plotted and it's one of my favorites.",5,"""One Great Film""",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,624,"['1931', 'Possessed', 'was', 'third', 'film', 'star', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'duo', 'would', 'make', 'eight', 'movies', 'together', 'become', 'lovers', 'would', 'be', 'life-long', 'friends', 'Gable', 'died', 'early', 'sixties.This', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Joan', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', '1947', 'Possessed', 'story', 'poor', 'girl', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'who', 'man', 'dreams', 'dashing', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'attorney', 'Probably', 'more', 'evident', 'film', 'other', 'chemistry', 'Gable', 'Crawford', 'evident', 'story', 'well-written', 'well-directed', 'superbly', 'plotted', 'one', 'favorites']",N/A
