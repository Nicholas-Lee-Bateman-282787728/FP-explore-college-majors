I like the fact that it dealt with &#34;loving oneself&#34; in order to demand proper love and respect.CONSIt dealt with forgiveness and YES, that's a good thing.  However, usually in these stage plays where women are hurting, the writers push past the emotions to deal with the forgives.  Nonetheless most of these writers eliminate the fact that these emotions have to be worked through.  People who usually deny their emotions now find that they come back to haunt them later.Overall, it was a good play.

Many distractions caused me not to be able to watch this movie through several times.So tonight we watched this movie all the way through several times on a great quite evening. So I said this to say, if you start this play and don't like this play, just give this play a chance.To start off about this movie, this movie started of with good laughs and I love the clothes and decorations on the set.This movie speaks reality and tells the truth about many situations. For one why do some men always want to know where their woman/wife's locations is at all times? Why do men cheat on their wives and then lie about it? Why do some women cheat with married men? Why do some men always want things their way? How do you know if you are with the right person, the wrong person? If you want to know the answers/solutions to theses questions, watch this play..No commitments, no strings attached, do you say this, have you heard someone else say this? Watch this play. Do you love yourself? Do you refuse to set yourself up to go through the pain that you may have seen growing up? Watch this play. Are you looking for a husband? Do you know the deal breakers for a relationship? Do you think that just because a man has good attributes he is a good husband. Buy this play.This play will inspire you and touch you in so many ways.This play is so so great and awesome full of surprises and jokes that will make you roll on the floor laughing. And you know anytime Shirley Murdock is in something, it will be great.The only regret I have is not being able to watch this on the first attempt, but life happens and life calls and at least I have the ability to watch this any time I want, even if I have to stop the play and start over.  I will say this, there are many parts that you will want to stop and rewind anyway.And as far as the woman not showing while pregnant, I really think that the reason for this was because sometimes during the stages of pregnancy, women go through different things during each trimester. I think this was a message that the woman was in the early stages of life in the womb and how her decision would impact the life that was in her womb.I could be wrong, but I think there was a message for the reason she was not showing. And remember some women don't show until the end anyway. Many women carry their babies different.Great cast! I love the different faces in this play. I love myself better than that! Amen! Great play with Godly solutions! Great christian play, that shows faith, love, forgiveness, honesty, repentance, what God do you serve?, endurance, a family that not only talked the talk, but walked it! Fight for your marriage, many people don't. This is a great play to share with your church, community, date night, girls night, couple's night, etc. The issues are real and need to be told, keep plays like this coming.Get your hot coco, tea, and popcorn ready!

It was so choppy (all over the place) and the minor details were not realistic e.g. baby shower but she's not at all showing, all family randomly coming over, baby shower gift says the opposite gender of what she's having, and no fake sink for the hair shop or other tools.
