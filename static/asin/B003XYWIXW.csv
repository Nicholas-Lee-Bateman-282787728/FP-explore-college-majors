But the last thirty minutes or so is like a crime drama with police questioning a would-be victim about the events that took place that night. So it get points for doing something different, and sort of changing genres in the third act. However, the film as a whole is just average. The killer isn't exactly menacing. He is skinny and pale and wears a hood, instead of a creepy mask.

I, like others, wondered why they didn't simply leave the maze, or cry out, or take some logical steps toward their own survival. I waited, and thought about turning it off. Then, an astonishing thing happened. I watched as THE MAZE transformed from a mediocre-at-best slasher film (the first, tedious hour) into a tense, interesting thriller (the final 30 minutes). This almost makes up for the first two thirds of the movie. Almost. Perhaps, if it had been split evenly in half, w/ the morons running aimlessly to their deaths lasting only 45 minutes, then maybe it would have made the payoff more effective. As it is, THE MAZE only makes me groan, wishing the entire movie could have been as well-done as the final third...",3,Missed Opportunity...,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,846,"['watched', 'first', 'hour', 'THE', 'MAZE', 'grew', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'idiotic', 'characters', 'doing', 'idiotic', 'things', 'others', 'wondered', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'simply', 'leave', 'maze', 'cry', 'out', 'take', 'logical', 'steps', 'own', 'survival', 'waited', 'thought', 'turning', 'off', 'Then', 'astonishing', 'thing', 'happened', 'watched', 'THE', 'MAZE', 'transformed', 'mediocre-at-best', 'slasher', 'film', 'first', 'tedious', 'hour', 'tense', 'interesting', 'thriller', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'almost', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'movie', 'Almost', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'been', 'split', 'evenly', 'half', 'w/', 'morons', 'running', 'aimlessly', 'deaths', 'lasting', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'payoff', 'more', 'effective', 'THE', 'MAZE', 'only', 'groan', 'wishing', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'well-done', 'final', 'third']",N/A

1371241,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003XYWIXW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 4]","The Maze (Steve Shimek, 2010)I'm sure, if I looked really really hard, I could have found a worse way to start off the day's movie-watching than The Maze, a worthless direct-to-video mess from Steve Shimek, whose major claim to fame is Dragon Wars (to which, I am pained to report, a sequel is being filmed as we speak). But off the top of my head, I can't imagine how. Let me put it this way: I've seen thousands of movies over the years. My spreadsheet lists 2,854 as of right now, and I know there are a lot missing from that list I saw before I started keeping a record back in the mid-nineties. Before today, there were eight films on that list I haven't seen all the way through; they were simply so awful I couldn't finish watching them. Now, there are nine. I finished watching such execrable messes as Spiker, The Living Impaired, the recent remake of It's Alive, Open Water 2, and Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie (the highest film I've actually watched all the way through on my 100 Worst Films of All-Time list; it's at #2). But this? Nope. It joins the smallest subset in my entire movie-watching career.There is a plot to it, though it's one of those plots that can be summed up in one sentence: five kids break into a corn maze one night and find there's a killer in there with them. And I rush to add that movies with plots this simple can be done correctly, and are on a fairly regular basis. But if plot is not going to be the main strength of your film, you have to have something to balance that out. Bela Tarr makes plotless films all the time, and they're fantastic because the characters are so finely-detailed that you can't help but be drawn into their day-to-day lives. Tarr is also a true auteur with the camera, the kind of guy who makes every shot pregnant with meaning. And yes, I realize it's ludicrous to even think about comparing Steve Shimek with Bela Tarr. I certainly didn't go into this expecting Satantango. But still, it's illustrative of my point: when you don't have plot, you need something else. This movie has nothing. The characters are badly-acted cardboard cutouts. You can find more nuanced and dimensional characters in a random Steven Seagal film. The camerawork is competent at best (and it is rarely at its best). The soundtrack exists, which is the best thing I can say about it. The set is, well, a corn maze. I've seen a couple of other horror flicks try to use a corn maze as a set, and it has yet to actually work. But here's the real kicker. At no point, at least at no point during the hour of this mess I was able to choke down, is there even the merest iota of tension or suspense. Given that this is supposed to be a horror film, or at least a slasher-film actioner, that is an unforgivable sin.
