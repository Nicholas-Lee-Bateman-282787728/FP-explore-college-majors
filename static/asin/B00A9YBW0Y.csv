1607042,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00A9YBW0Y,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 3]","Pedophilia is a very touchy subject.  I take it very personally.  I&#8217;ve seen the effect that it has on children and on parents, and being a parent myself I honestly abhor nothing more than child abuse.  I find nothing as repugnant, disgusting and reprehensible than the molestation of an innocent child and so films that touch upon this subject usually spark something almost primal in me.I want to kill people.&#8216;The Hunt&#8217; dares to pretty much break every preconceived notion I have towards the subject and dares to make me question everything I think I know and or feel about the subject.  No, &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; does not make me side with pedophilia, that is not what I mean.  What I mean is that &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; dares to question the integrity of a child and the condemning nature of a community stricken by fear of a monster.  This is precisely where &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; soars as a social commentary, because it presents a portrait of humanity that feels extremely authentic and honest; brutally so.I can&#8217;t remember the last time I was this uncomfortable and this frustrated while watching a film.Thomas Vinterberg&#8217;s melodrama from Denmark covers a terrible time in the life of Lucas, a man working at a Kindergarten and going through a rough divorce.  While he struggles to see more of his son, Marcus, he gives of himself to all who surround him with love, including the children he supervises at the school.  He is a charming and kindhearted man, but when his best friend&#8217;s young daughter, Klara, shows him special attention, he does his best to direct her affections elsewhere.  This causes a problem, for when Klara gets her feelings wounded she makes some harsh comments that are misconstrued by Grethe, the headmistress at the Kindergarten, and soon Lucas is being accused and practically crucified as a pedophile, despite a jarring lack of evidence and no real accusation made by Klara (outside of an obviously coaxed one).  Immediately, Lucas is ostracized.  His once welcoming and comforting community has now turned their backs on him and have outright lashed out at him.  His best friend has shut him out and his life begins to completely spiral downward.&#8216;The Hunt&#8217; makes a very bold statement with regards to our reputations; for once they are tarnished they are rarely ever restored completely.Where &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; succeeds is in conflicting our emotions in such a unique way.  As I mentioned, I find child abuse to be utterly repulsive.  I loathe nothing more.  This is why &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; is so frustrating.  As the viewer, you know that he is innocent, and so when he is ostracized, condemned and violently mistreated you are frustrated because it feels so unjust, but when you factor in the fact that you are the ONLY one who knows of his innocence, it becomes frustrating in a different way.  You realize that you understand and completely agree with his mistreatment.  Had you been in the shoes of the community, you&#8217;d feel the same way and possibly react in the same manner, and while I wanted to punch Grethe in the face for destroying Lucas&#8217;s reputation by taking it upon herself to handle the situation, I almost sympathize with her because, in that situation (she felt betrayed and even partially at fault for possibly allowing something like that to happen on her watch so-to-speak), you may have possibly done the same thing.&#8216;The Hunt&#8217; also marvelously showcases how panic can spread like a virus in close communities, for once an accusation is made soon it&#8217;s being made ten times over.The one issue I take with the film is the conclusion, although not entirely.  In fact, my issue is merely a technicality to be honest and the more I think about it the less it bothers me.  Initially, I found the suddenness of the final scenes to feel rushed and not very well thought out.  There should have been a few sequences of progression that would have colored in the lines a tad and helped us to accept the surface acceptance that Lucas experiences in the finale.That being said, the final scene is perfection and further solidifies the themes Vinterberg and Lindholm create here.The performances by the entire cast are extraordinary.  Mad Mikkelsen has been getting some seriously great ink for his very honest portrayal of Lucas, but for me it was Thomas Bo Larsen who stole the whole film.  As the conflicted father, broken at the seams at the thought of his very best friend abusing his daughter, I connected to him on a personal level and felt his every shudder.  His breakdown at his daughter&#8217;s bedside shook me to my core.  Annika Wedderkopp is also rather sensational here, delivering a powerfully stirring child performance that feels organic and understanding.As a whole, &#8216;The Hunt&#8217; is unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen on the subject, for it refuses to take a stand on either side of the situation and merely presents it to us in an honest and remarkably astute light.",5,Unlike anything I've seen

Having been a teacher, I know the damage a child or adolescent can make by making an off-the-cuff remark as is depicted in this movie.  Once the remark is made into something bigger by adults who mean well, instead of being innocent until proven guilty, the accused is simply guilty even when proven innocent.  Thus, people in societies around the world need to reevaluate the ways in which they handle such off-the-cuff remarks by child made against their teachers.  Being a teacher is being set up to fail because kids say all kinds of things and parents and school boards blow their childish remarks way out of proportion.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the subtitles were not posted long enough to read them in English.

There is no other film that comes close.This film in the most realistic way I have ever seen (or can envision seeing it) shows the quietly disgusting side of humanity and mob mentality at its worst, but not the kind with the pitchfork where you get strung up in the square, but the kind where the mob lurks in the shadows too cowardly to own up to their horrific behavior.Here's it is.  What happens when someone is falsely accused of a horrific act by a child?  Well the Hunt ventures into this territory like no other film I have ever seen.  As I was watching it, I said to myself, how stupid can people be, to always blindly believe children, when they are prone to wild tales of exaggeration and lying as a matter of course?  How can you simply disbelieve and turn your back on a friend you have had your whole life over an unproven and utterly ridiculous allegation?Moreover, how disgusting can officials be in asking loaded questions of little children so that any which way they answer, a horrific accusation is made. And the answer is sickeningly simple.  It is easy for people to be this way.  To be so void of common sense, to let fear grip them in such fashion as to make them forget all sense of right and wrong and perspective.And that is why the Hunt is like a quiet, yet raking shot gun blast to the face.  The more you watch the Hunt the more you realize that this could very well happen and just in this way.  You will be very angry ( and I mean seething vengeance minded angry) watching the Hunt, because there truly is no justice or peace once accused.  And the worst part is, you know it happens in real life, far too often, and ultimately you simply have no other option but to churn inside because you know it can be you in a heart beat that this could happen to.

1607047,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00A9YBW0Y,Doug Park,"[1, 1]","THE HUNT never leaves its Smaller Town, Denmark, setting; it doesn't have many big dramatic twists and turns beyond those described in the premise-synopsis; and it shows little or nothing of things that would be crucial in most big Hollywood productions: police interrogations, hearings, news flashes, interviews with the other children besides the original ""accuser"" and what they (supposedly) said. Nevertheless, there is an immediate realism here, with excellent dialogue and interactions of all kinds by ordinary people, that more than compensates if you do not absolutely need big-film elements. THE HUNT also makes fine use of nuances of mannerism and subtle everyday symbolism. Some great scenery too.Excellent character development and fine acting, especially by Mads Mikkelsen (who co-starred in another excellent Danish film,A Royal Affair), Annika Wederkopp, and all the actors who play the various other children. THE HUNT simply and straightforwardly shows how this sort of random ""accusation,"" embellished and escalated by adults, can irrevocably ruin any of us, including the very best of us. Yet, it also shows the other perspective: How, even when there is no solid evidence and tons of reasonable doubt, Lucas's former closest friends will never be able to entirely discount the possibility of some truth somewhere to the allegation, especially when it involves their own children. Moreover, even those without involvement or first-hand knowledge of the case(the local grocery store staff, etc) are eager to jump on the sanctimonious bandwagon and get in their chops. Finally, it's very revealing of how the biggest, most horrible mistakes and misjudgments are the hardest to admit or correct.Throughout this film, the first thought in my mind was simply ""This is exactly how such a non-incident would occur, as well as what might very well happen afterward.""",4,"""I can see it in his face""",1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1877,"['HUNT', 'never', 'Smaller', 'Town', 'Denmark', 'setting', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'big', 'dramatic', 'twists', 'described', 'premise-synopsis', 'little', 'nothing', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'crucial', 'most', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'productions', 'police', 'interrogations', 'hearings', 'news', 'flashes', 'interviews', 'other', 'children', 'original', 'accuser', 'what', 'supposedly', 'said', 'Nevertheless', 'immediate', 'realism', 'here', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'interactions', 'kinds', 'ordinary', 'people', 'more', 'compensates', 'do', 'not', 'absolutely', 'need', 'big-film', 'elements', 'HUNT', 'also', 'fine', 'use', 'nuances', 'mannerism', 'subtle', 'everyday', 'symbolism', 'great', 'scenery', 'too.Excellent', 'character', 'development', 'fine', 'acting', 'especially', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'who', 'co-starred', 'excellent', 'Danish', 'film', 'A', 'Royal', 'Affair', 'Annika', 'Wederkopp', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'various', 'other', 'children', 'HUNT', 'simply', 'straightforwardly', 'how', 'sort', 'random', 'accusation', 'embellished', 'escalated', 'adults', 'can', 'irrevocably', 'ruin', 'including', 'very', 'best', 'also', 'other', 'perspective', 'How', 'even', 'when', 'solid', 'evidence', 'tons', 'reasonable', 'doubt', 'Lucas', 'former', 'closest', 'friends', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'entirely', 'discount', 'possibility', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'allegation', 'especially', 'when', 'own', 'children', 'Moreover', 'even', 'involvement', 'first-hand', 'knowledge', 'case', 'local', 'grocery', 'store', 'staff', 'etc', 'are', 'eager', 'jump', 'sanctimonious', 'bandwagon', 'get', 'chops', 'Finally', 'very', 'revealing', 'how', 'biggest', 'most', 'horrible', 'mistakes', 'misjudgments', 'are', 'hardest', 'admit', 'correct.Throughout', 'film', 'first', 'thought', 'mind', 'was', 'simply', 'exactly', 'how', 'such', 'non-incident', 'would', 'occur', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'happen', 'afterward']","The Hunt 2012  Jagten  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
1607048,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00A9YBW0Y,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","Other reviewers have commented very cogently on the film's thematic preoccupations with the ways in which allegations of pedophilia can ruin a person's life, even if they have not done anything.  What is perhaps most noteworthy about Thomas Vinterberg's film is the way in which the story has been told: with no music to influence the viewers' attitude towards the characters, or set the mood for each sequence, we are left to make up our minds for ourselves.  Charlotte Bruus Christensen's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' expressions through tight close-ups: we see the way in which Lucas' (Mads Mikkelsen) life is ruined through the way in which he begins to look wildly about him, as if fearful of reprisal.  The sequence taking place on Christmas Day where Lucas sits in a pew and looks behind him at his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) is particularly effective; through a series of shot/reverse shots, we see Theo's face becoming more and more anxious as he understands just how much mental strain Lucas undergoes.  The sequence builds up to an uncomfortable climax as the two men are seen in two-shot, with Lucas grabbing Theo's lapels and shaking him.  In the background, the carols sung by the infants' choir stop abruptly, and everyone stares at the two men.  Vinterberg's film is intelligently set around the changing seasons, running from autumn to Christmas; as the festive season approaches, so life becomes more and more unbearable for Lucas: so much for the season of goodwill.  The title is deliberately ambiguous: not only referring to the annual winter hunt - where all the menfolk gather in good-natured celebration of a time-honored ritual, but to the way Lucas is hunted by the rest of his community.

The message of the movie is powerful and righteous, but the quality of the movie itself is another story. This movie reminded me of ""Passion of Christ"" which is also powerful for similar reasons: unjust accusations, torture/martyrdom and then possible crucifiction. The accused teacher in this movie makes almost no attempt to solve the situation: he throws some words, alienates people around him. The headteacher in the kindergarten is about as ridiculous as can be: she says ""I always believe children"". Anyone who spent time with children knows that children lie from time to time (and they do not always understand the consequences). It looks like the village people have not had a sacrifice for some time and were looking for blood but that is where another problem lies. Perhaps the idea was to show that these people knew so little about children and life that they could not figure out how to go about these things, except to jump to conclusions. However, the characters are shown in general as fairly reasonable and likely educated people. This is where I find this movie so unrealistic.

1607054,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00A9YBW0Y,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","THE HUNT as directed by Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration) is a profoundly moving film that should be seen by everyone. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, the film takes a brave stand on the current obsession with pedophilia, demonstrating that at times the accusing children are the true criminals when the stories are fabricated by the 'abused ones'. One of the reasons this film is so powerful is the extraordinary acting by Mads Mikkelsen who offers one of the most impressive performances on film.Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a 42 year- old teacher whose life has recently been bruised by divorce and the loss of custody of his son. He has found work in a very small Danish town as a teacher of kindergarten where his students and faculty and parents love him for his kindness and his exceptional skills in dealing with children. He meets an eligible girl Nadja (Alexandra Rappaport) who is eager to establish a relationship with him, and finally his ex-wife is allowing his son to come live with him. But everything about his life becomes a nightmare when one of his pupils Klara (Annika Wedderkoop), the young daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), who adores Lucas suddenly turns on him, creating a lie she shares with the school principal Grethe (Susse Wold). Grethe `believes children' and Lucas is cast out of the community as a pedophile. Even Theo refuses to hear Lucas' denial about the lie as well as the folk in the little church in the town. The degree of agony one child's lie creates in the life of the innocent Lucas is almost unbearable to observe.Throughout the story and the film Mads Mikkelsen delivers a highly nuanced performance, one that will remain indelibly imprinted on viewers' minds - hopefully. This is a brilliant little film. In Danish and English with subtitles.

American audiences know Mads Mikkelsen as the primary villain in the James Bond movie ""Casino Royale"".  But he has been a successful leading man in Danish films for many years.  (Be sure to catch him in ""After the Wedding"".)Mikkelsen plays a divorced father falsely accused of a sexual crime by a 6-year-old girl pouting because she got her feelings hurt for a few moments.  Just as frightening as his character living under that shadow is that the school leaders, the child psychologist, and the parents of the other schoolchildren take the lie as fact purely on faith without any kind of investigation, despite the man's protests of innocence.  Not only that, but in fact the school leaders and the child psychologist practically spoonfeed the little girl her story, so sure are they that her tentative self speaks an immutable truth.  When she feebly attempts to retract her story the adults simply don't believe her -- they even tell her that she is just trying to repress the memory.  The lie takes on a life of its own thanks to the unwillingness of the adults to give the man --- a lifelong member of the community --- the benefit of the doubt.What happens to the man next is largely predictable, and check out the DVD bonus features for an alternate ending that is equally disturbing.

Mikkelsen is able to capture the loyalty of the audience and bring you on this hideous journey even when the topic leaves you squirming in your seat.  You feel how uncomfortable he is from the very beginning and evolve with the character as he discovers that those closest to him are able to turn their backs on an instant.

The Hunt was released early last year, garnering a Best Actor award at Cannes for Mads Mikkelson's portrayal of Lucas.This Danish movie, sensitively directed by Thomas Vinerberg, is set in a small village where Lucas is a kindergarten teacher. Klara (Annika Wedderkopp) behaves inappropriately towards Lucas, who tries to nip this in the bud by returning her gift to his best friend, Klara's father, Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen). In a fit of pique, the young Klara tells the nursery staff (with a fair amount of prompting) that Lucas displayed his genitals to her. Like the story of The Crucible, other children, resenting Klara's spotlight, join in with their own fabrications, further discrediting Lucas.In a flash, Lucas' already troubled world is turned upside down. Ostracized by the little community, Theo tries to maintain tenuous contact, but his wife Agnes (Anne Louise Hassing) is adamant that Theo cut Lucas off. This separation is particularly painful for both parties. Overt acts of violence by other village residents follow.Even though the incident resolves itself, it is a heartbreakingly sad movie. Some scenes had me in tears at how easily a community can turn on a decent man, without thorough investigation. Fine performances all round, but Mads Mikkelson as the quietly stoic Lucas, never becomes maudlin nor loses hope.

1607076,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00A9YBW0Y,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","Possible spoilers ahead.This Danish film by Thomas Vinterbert, who also co-wrote with Tobias Lindholm, takes an all-too-familiar topic both in film and real life to new levels of tension.  Set in a small Danish town, Mads Mikkelsen gives a remarkable performance as a kindergarten teacher who is charged with molesting one of his students.  Vinterbert isn't interested in keeping the audience guessing about Lucas' (Mikkelsen) guilt or innocence.  We know right away this is a false accusation because of Lucas' rejection of a student's inappropriate gesture.Lucas is a divorced father of a teenage son who lives with his mother.  Marcus (Lasse Fogelstrom) is determined to live with his father, even after learning of the accusation.  The focus of the film here is the scant evidence of wrongdoing and how it affects Lucas, his son, girlfriend and his friendship with his best friend, Theo (Lasse Fogelstrom).Even the young girl, Klara quickly recants her accusations, saying she was just mad at Lucas.  No one pays attention however.  Minds are already made up.  The general hysteria even leads to other children accusing Lucas, with obviously rehearsed, but inaccurate detail.  These are kids who had loved having Lucas as their teacher.  Eventually, Lucas is exonerated, both by the law and by the townsfolk and it appears all is forgiven.  I can't say that I loved the ending, but it (and the alternate) would seem appropriate to heighten Vinterbert's point.  This movie is hard to watch, but is well made and contains some strong performances.The Blu ray version I watched was excellent in every way.  Shot digitally, it still looks very film-like.  The detail is excellent as are the colors and textural contrast.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The audio comes with a Danish DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There are scenes where English is spoken as well.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, English and English SDH.  The dialog is very clear.  Even with the scenes where Danish and Swedish accented English is spoken, it is easily understood.  The soundtrack features a quiet guitar most of the time, yet is quite evident as scenes develop.  Extras include the alternate ending, some outtakes, deleted and extended scenes, a short making of featurette and a trailer.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 4 1/2 stars.

When she thought she could get that from this kind teacher of hers, and he had to explain to her that her kiss was inappropriate, it all went to hell.

1607079,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00A9YBW0Y,Paul Allaer,"[17, 18]","""The Hunt"" (2012 release from Denmark; original title ""Jagten""; 106 min.) brings the story of Lucas (played by Mads Mikkelsen), a forty-something, recently divorced man. He is aching over the loss of his marriage and the fact that his teenage son is living with his ex-wife. Lucas is helping out at the local kindergarten, where the kids adore him. We also get to know Klara, the 5 or 6 yr. old  daughter of Lucas' best friend Theo. After having overheard a racy conversation by Klara's brother and his friends, Klara flaps out some words to the kindergarten's principal, implying improper behavior by Lucas. Things develop rapidly from there, and soon thereafter other kids at the kindergarten also come forward with similar allegations. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie. To tell you more of the plot would do a big disservice to your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie demonstrates how a young child unknowingly can cause destruction of a life and of a community. It is a very difficult issue, as of course we tend to believe what young kids tell us, since they have no reason to lie, right? Except that at such a young age, young kids may not yet fully comprehend the difference between telling the truth and telling lies, or at least certainly they cannot fully anticipate or comprehend the consequences of their actions. Second, the acting in this movie is outstanding throughout, none more so that Mad Mikkelsen as the accused sexual offender. Mikkelsen also excelled in last year's ""A Royal Affair"", another outstanding movie from Denmark. No surprise that he won the Best Actor award at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival (where this movie premiered). But kudos as well to the little girl who played Klara in what obviously at times had to be a very difficult/awkward shoot. Third, I read that this movie was made on a budget of about $3.5 million, proving once again that you don't need a superhero saving the world or an action movie in which everything is blown to smithereens every 5 minutes to engage an audience and make a gripping movie.I have no idea why it has taken more than a year for this movie to arrive in US theatres, but better late than never I suppose. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figured this probably wouldn't stick around for very long so I went to see it right away. Imagine my surprise that the screening I saw this at (a matinee show) was absolutely PACKED! That is great news indeed, and I can only hope this movie proves to be a big hit on the art-house theatre circuit. All that aside, if you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this.

Finally, after 3/4 of the film passes, the protagonist begins to stand up for himself- a welcome development.As much as I expected this film to be a character study of the wrongly accused, and how they rise up to meet the challenge and viscerally defend themselves, Lucas' unwillingness to aggressively counterpunch is frustratingly courageous.My one complaint is the ending- a one shot reminder that all is not past and rehabilitated.

I made the mistake of going to Vudu and reading all the expert reviews there and ignored the member reviews. Big mistake! I also judged on the fact that it's got a high over all star rating here and there at Vudu. Yep the critics made this sound like some horrifying heart stopper,. The truth is this movie while well acted is slow, tedious and boring. I've seen a couple of what I consider far better films on the subject. This one applies to much bland reality to it. There's no suspense at all, no sense of dread, not much emotion either. There's nothing that kept me drawn in. I mean the people in the film play this sort of like it would happen in real life, but it's downright not all that interesting. I love foreign movies, and don't mind subtitles, but sometimes the titles here moved too fast and I did miss about 15% of the entire sentences here and there in the movie. The actor playing the lead, I thought he was fine, but it's a role that is not all that demanding if you want my opinion. I understand he has already won a couple best actor awards for this at a couple of prestigious film festivals, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I couldn't see much all that memorable about his performance. Though I agree the film tells the story in a believable way, there are also holes in the story that didn't make any sense to me. And I also don't think the title is fitting at all. Primarily there was no &#34;Hunt&#34; at all. Once they started to question this man and if or not he was perhaps a pedophile, they weren't hunting him, they were avoiding him or telling him he's not welcome.

1607092,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B00A9YBW0Y,S. Spilka,"[6, 8]","SPOILERS.Here in America, we have waited a year for this movie, which got rave reviews in Europe and England. Finally it arrived, just in time for the Oscars. I hope Mads gets the Oscar. I am, once more, impressed by the emotional range, the precision, and the visceral power of his acting. When he crawls into his couch, like a beaten dog, after the fight in the church, you don't see the ""handsome and sexy man,"" as he is often touted, but a miserable man at the end of his tether. Mads is a towering actor.The plot of the movie is tight and suspenseful, but I was troubled by two things which, in my view, diminish its true greatness.Yes, the whole village turns against Lucas when the false rumors that he is a child molester take wings. Men in the supermarket beat him up within an inch of his life, and others ignore him, as if he were a ghost, the one who lived amongst them all his life.  But some men support him: his son Marcus is his passionate advocate, and so is Marcus's godfather. Even Ole, Klara's father, sometimes doubts Lucas's guilt, reflects on it, and is determined to find the truth.By contrast, the women in the movie seem like some Greek mythology furies who want to tear Lucas apart. They are all impervious to doubt and reason. Perhaps the worst one is Grethe, in whose kindergarten this drama occurred. As soon as Klara reveals to her that Lucas molested her, Grethe gets into action. She never allows Lucas to defend himself but immediately announces the false accusation to all the parents and the village. Before the police has a chance to investigate Lucas, Grethe calls a friend to interrogate Klara. When Klara--all four years of her--tries to deny the accusation or pedal it back, Grethe insists that Klara repeat the accusation.  This interrogation is chilling.Klara's mother is also furious with Lucas, perhaps understandably. But when poor Klara, who sees the havoc she had unwittingly created, wants to repair her mistake and tell her mother the truth that Lucas had done nothing wrong, the mother won't have it. She tells Klara that the molestation happened, certainly, and that Klara just wants to repress the awful memory.Lucas's ex-wife, as we hear her on the phone, is also nasty and hysterical.Who then is more rational? Perhaps Lucas's American girl-friend? Well, no. When Lucas tells her about the accusation laid against him, she bursts out laughing. Really, she laughs. She later tries to cover it up, but she seems not to know or care really if he is a child molester. He throws her out, and good for him. But at the end of the movie, they are back together again.

It stars the excellent Mads Mikkelsen as Lucas you may remember him from `A Royal Affair' or `The Three Musketeers'. He is a kindergarten teacher where he does everything for the kids including bum wiping. He is in a battle with his ex wife over access to his teenage son, who wants to live with his father. Lucas has a best friend in Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen) and one of Lucas' charges is his young five year old daughter, Klara.One day Klara makes an accusation against her favourite teacher to the Head mistress and before you can say `J'accuse, the local authorities are involved including the most unprofessional child counsellor I have ever seen. He is at first sent home and then the old chestnut that children do not tell lies is pulled out of the hat and all of a sudden he is guilty as charged. Worse still half the school now claim to be victims, talk about the power of suggestion. What happens next is the spiral he is thrown into from being a revered and valued member of the community to social pariah over night where even his friends have judged him and found him wanting.Director Thomas Vinterberg has made a quietly, powerful film of emotional torture and the effects of being over trusting of kids. This is one of those films that just pull you in and make you actually live the on screen antics, even the dog is good. It is in Danish and some English with fairly good sub titles and runs for 115 minutes and I found it absolutely engrossing. To tackle such an emotive subject and get the balance just right is some feat and Mikkelsen puts in a sterling performance, but actually so do all of them Anika Wedderkopp playing the young Klara looks like having a career path already mapped out judging by her performance here.

1607099,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00A9YBW0Y,Turfseer,"[2, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0'The Hunt' takes its name from a fraternity of men in Denmark who bond over hunting. Except in the case of this film, the hunted is one of their own. Lucas is a kindergarten teacher who is having a hard time with his estranged ex-wife obtaining visitation rights in regards to their teenage son, Marcus. Things get a whole lot more difficult for Lucas when he's accused of molesting one of his nursery school pupils, little Klara, who also happens to be the daughter of his best friend and neighbor, Theo.It's all a misunderstanding as little Klara sees some picture of naked men on her brother's iPad at home. But when she arrives at school and gives Lucas a kiss on the cheek, he tells her that the kiss should be for her own parents. Klara also can't understand why Lucas won't accept a heart shaped piece of embroidery she gives him. Before you know it Klara implies that she saw Lucas' erect penis. The school director calls in a male staff member who asks Klara leading questions. Lucas is then accused of additional sexual misconduct and the accusations spread like wildfire around the town, even before the police become involved.The story becomes a cautionary tale of modern day witch hunts. Things like this have happened in the U.S., especially in cases where psychologists 'uncover' past abuse through alleged exploration of so-called repressed memories. The mere suggestion of misdeeds causes the purported victims to become convinced that criminal behavior may have occurred, when it actually did not.The nightmare escalates for Lucas when almost all his friends desert him, including Theo, who is egged on by his wife, who's now in panic mode. Lucas bitterly throws his new girlfriend, Nadja, out of his house, as she expresses doubts as to his innocence.One of the weaknesses of the story is that we never get to see Lucas interact with an attorney, nor are any of the courtroom scenes shown. Instead, another one of Lucas' best friends, Bruun, described as Marcus' 'godfather', helps with his defense. We learn that legal case against Lucas falls apart, after scores of children (after being coached by either their parents or school personnel) all accuse Lucas of sexual abuse, in the basement of his house. Police investigators, however, discover that Lucas has no basement!Despite the legal victory, Lucas remains ostracized and in two powerful scenes, he's beaten up while attempting to buy food at a supermarket and then has his beloved dog, Fanny, killed by a faceless tormentor. Lucas still has two things going for him: the love of his son, Marcus and his determination to prove his innocence.Lucas finally is able to bring most of the community back on his side when he confronts his former best friend, Theo, in church on Christmas eve. Theo was much affected beforehand, when he saw Lucas being beaten up at the supermarket. As a result of the confrontation, Theo talks with Klara, who again denies Lucas did anything wrong and he finally comes to believe Lucas' claims of innocence.I'm not completely sure if I believe that Theo would have come to accept Lucas at the end, given the community pressure as well as the fears of his own wife. After all, he could have been ostracized by the community himself. But the way it turns out, after a year has passed, somehow many (not all) have forgiven Lucas, when we see that Marcus is being accepted as an adult into the local hunting society (animal rights people beware--this is NOT a touchy-feely movie toward animals, especially deer!).Director Thomas Vinterberg throws in a twist at the end, when an anonymous hunter takes a shot at Lucas, just to remind him that not all in the community believe in his innocence.'The Hunt' plays out highlighting the savagery lurking beneath a staid bourgeoisie society. Leaving out the legal battle on screen seems intentional, as the focus is on the errant community members, who decidedly refuse to give Lucas not one iota of a benefit of a doubt. Perhaps Vinterberg reasoned that this potboiler of a story might have ended up diluted, if he showed us a few more rational members of this community, pleading Lucas' case before the bar of justice.Nonetheless, 'The Hunt' accomplishes what it sets out to do--a gripping tale of an innocent man falsely accused, fighting for himself and his way of life. Not all of it is necessarily completely believable, especially how Lucas ends up being restored to the community, through the efforts of his old friend, who finally sees the light. But that final gunshot is a tragic reminder, that not everyone is so forgiving, as Lucas' old pal, Theo.",3,"Not completely believable but still a gripping, well-done tale of savagery beneath the surface of staid bourgeoisie society",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,4664,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '3.5', ""5.0'The"", 'Hunt', 'name', 'fraternity', 'men', 'Denmark', 'who', 'bond', 'hunting', 'case', 'film', 'hunted', 'one', 'own', 'Lucas', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'who', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'estranged', 'ex-wife', 'obtaining', 'visitation', 'rights', 'regards', 'teenage', 'son', 'Marcus', 'Things', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'difficult', 'Lucas', 'when', 'accused', 'molesting', 'one', 'nursery', 'school', 'pupils', 'little', 'Klara', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'daughter', 'best', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'Theo.It', 'misunderstanding', 'little', 'Klara', 'picture', 'naked', 'men', 'brother', 'iPad', 'home', 'when', 'school', 'Lucas', 'kiss', 'cheek', 'kiss', 'should', 'be', 'own', 'parents', 'Klara', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Lucas', 'wo', ""n't"", 'accept', 'heart', 'shaped', 'piece', 'embroidery', 'know', 'Klara', 'saw', 'Lucas', 'erect', 'penis', 'school', 'director', 'male', 'staff', 'member', 'who', 'Klara', 'leading', 'questions', 'Lucas', 'then', 'accused', 'additional', 'sexual', 'misconduct', 'accusations', 'spread', 'wildfire', 'town', 'even', 'police', 'become', 'involved.The', 'story', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'modern', 'day', 'witch', 'hunts', 'Things', 'have', 'happened', 'U.S.', 'especially', 'cases', 'where', 'psychologists', 'past', 'abuse', 'alleged', 'exploration', 'so-called', 'repressed', 'memories', 'mere', 'suggestion', 'misdeeds', 'purported', 'victims', 'become', 'convinced', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'may', 'have', 'occurred', 'when', 'actually', 'did', 'not.The', 'nightmare', 'Lucas', 'when', 'almost', 'friends', 'desert', 'including', 'Theo', 'who', 'egged', 'wife', 'who', 'now', 'panic', 'mode', 'Lucas', 'bitterly', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Nadja', 'house', 'doubts', 'innocence.One', 'weaknesses', 'story', 'never', 'get', 'see', 'Lucas', 'interact', 'attorney', 'are', 'courtroom', 'shown', 'Instead', 'one', 'Lucas', 'best', 'friends', 'Bruun', 'described', 'Marcus', 'defense', 'learn', 'legal', 'case', 'Lucas', 'apart', 'scores', 'children', 'being', 'coached', 'parents', 'school', 'personnel', 'accuse', 'Lucas', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'basement', 'house', 'Police', 'investigators', 'however', 'discover', 'Lucas', 'basement', 'legal', 'victory', 'Lucas', 'ostracized', 'two', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'beaten', 'up', 'attempting', 'buy', 'food', 'supermarket', 'then', 'beloved', 'dog', 'Fanny', 'killed', 'faceless', 'tormentor', 'Lucas', 'still', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'love', 'son', 'Marcus', 'determination', 'prove', 'innocence.Lucas', 'finally', 'able', 'bring', 'most', 'community', 'back', 'side', 'when', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'Theo', 'church', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'Theo', 'was', 'much', 'affected', 'beforehand', 'when', 'saw', 'Lucas', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'supermarket', 'result', 'confrontation', 'Theo', 'talks', 'Klara', 'who', 'again', 'Lucas', 'did', 'anything', 'wrong', 'finally', 'believe', 'Lucas', 'claims', 'innocence.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'believe', 'Theo', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'accept', 'Lucas', 'end', 'given', 'community', 'pressure', 'as', 'well', 'fears', 'own', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ostracized', 'community', 'way', 'out', 'year', 'passed', 'somehow', 'many', 'not', 'have', 'forgiven', 'Lucas', 'when', 'see', 'Marcus', 'being', 'accepted', 'adult', 'local', 'hunting', 'society', 'animal', 'rights', 'people', 'beware', 'NOT', 'touchy-feely', 'movie', 'animals', 'especially', 'deer', '.Director', 'Thomas', 'Vinterberg', 'twist', 'end', 'when', 'anonymous', 'hunter', 'shot', 'Lucas', 'just', 'remind', 'not', 'community', 'believe', 'innocence', 'Hunt', 'plays', 'highlighting', 'savagery', 'lurking', 'staid', 'bourgeoisie', 'society', 'Leaving', 'out', 'legal', 'battle', 'screen', 'intentional', 'focus', 'errant', 'community', 'members', 'who', 'decidedly', 'refuse', 'give', 'Lucas', 'not', 'one', 'iota', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'Perhaps', 'Vinterberg', 'reasoned', 'potboiler', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'diluted', 'showed', 'few', 'more', 'rational', 'members', 'community', 'pleading', 'Lucas', 'case', 'bar', 'justice.Nonetheless', 'Hunt', 'accomplishes', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'gripping', 'tale', 'innocent', 'man', 'falsely', 'accused', 'fighting', 'way', 'life', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'completely', 'believable', 'especially', 'how', 'Lucas', 'up', 'being', 'restored', 'community', 'efforts', 'old', 'friend', 'who', 'finally', 'light', 'final', 'gunshot', 'tragic', 'reminder', 'not', 'everyone', 'so', 'forgiving', 'Lucas', 'old', 'pal', 'Theo']","The Hunt 2012  Jagten  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"
