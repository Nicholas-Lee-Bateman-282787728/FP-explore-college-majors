958666,A26VCXQU8MLCK9,B000CFX7E4,"circawdm ""ArtDealerPro""","[0, 0]","I love opera-classical and pop and rock and roll - all. I never would have guessed a group of four men in their 30's could have the trained and fantastic quality of individual voices, and blend them so very, very well so they sound like almost one voice. The songs are as varied and interesting as the way they are sung by this group of very talented young men. On top of everything else, they are good showmen, each with their own brand of charisma, good looks and style. This is the kind of music that I play when I want to relax or cheer myself up or both. Their music is invigorating and stirring, and many of the songs are tender, and the pure and lovely tones are both calming but also make me smile and feel the ""chills"" at the same time. I always looked at Simon Cowell as abit of a ""Scrooge"" of sorts, even when he was ""right"" about a singer on ""American Idol."" I was turned off by his cynical and abit arrogant demeanor. Fortunately, he picked a real winner with these four guys! Also, fortunately, these young men seem to be genuine, humble and very kind indeed, considering all of the women and men  of all ages who adore them and come to see them all around the world. I have introduced Il Divo to 4-5 of my friends who never before liked opera, and who now like me, feel that this group is truly very fine and has a huge career ahead of them. Bravo, and encore! A song for everyone in their repertoire.

Holland,"[19, 24]","Ok, I bough this at Target a few days a go out of sheer morbid curiosity as to what this DVD could possibly contain that would be worth watching.You see, I'm not a ""fan"" of Il Divo. I really liked their first CD because it was something new and fresh that hadn't been done before, but I didn't care for the other stuff they've released since then quite as much.So I got this DVD because it's pretty cheap and I figured maybe there'll be something on there of interest to me.Well, I'm glad I got this thing because it is a very well done, documentary/mini concert DVD.To me the mini concert was the real treat. Recorded in an ancient Roman amphitheater in Madrid, the setting was stunning and the guys really sang excellently. Wasn't too sure why they included O Holy Night in the dead of what appeared to me a mid summer concert, but whatever.The concert is really just a promo for their follow up release ""Ancora"".The documentary portion was cool because they let the guys talk and it's pretty funny because these guys have a really good sense of humor about it all and seem really grounded....all except the American David Miller...he comes across like a the stereotypical opera prick...uptight and overbearing.Simon Cowel is also interviewd and much to the surprise of those who know him only as the caustic, cynical prick he is on American Idol, he actually comes across as a very decent and insightful businessman.Finally they give us 2 music vidoes from their first CD...Regressa Mi and Mama. Both are very well done but a little hard to get because the ""storyline"" in both videos is a bit hard to make out...especially in Mama....where the guys aren't shown singing at all....it's a bit confusing but still nice to watch.",4,Surprisingly Good!,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,1728,"['Ok', 'bough', 'Target', 'few', 'days', 'go', 'sheer', 'morbid', 'curiosity', 'what', 'DVD', 'could', 'possibly', 'contain', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching.You', 'see', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Il', 'Divo', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'CD', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'fresh', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'other', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'released', 'then', 'quite', 'much.So', 'got', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'figured', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'something', 'interest', 'me.Well', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'thing', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'documentary/mini', 'concert', 'DVD.To', 'mini', 'concert', 'was', 'real', 'treat', 'Recorded', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'amphitheater', 'Madrid', 'setting', 'was', 'stunning', 'guys', 'really', 'sang', 'excellently', 'Was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'why', 'included', 'O', 'Holy', 'Night', 'dead', 'what', 'appeared', 'mid', 'summer', 'concert', 'whatever.The', 'concert', 'really', 'just', 'promo', 'follow', 'release', 'Ancora', '.The', 'documentary', 'portion', 'was', 'cool', 'let', 'guys', 'talk', 'pretty', 'funny', 'guys', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'seem', 'really', 'grounded', 'American', 'David', 'Miller', 'stereotypical', 'opera', 'prick', 'uptight', 'overbearing.Simon', 'Cowel', 'also', 'interviewd', 'much', 'surprise', 'who', 'know', 'only', 'caustic', 'cynical', 'prick', 'American', 'Idol', 'actually', 'very', 'decent', 'insightful', 'businessman.Finally', 'give', '2', 'music', 'vidoes', 'first', 'CD', 'Regressa', 'Mi', 'Mama', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'little', 'hard', 'get', 'storyline', 'videos', 'bit', 'hard', 'make', 'out', 'especially', 'Mama', '.where', 'guys', 'are', ""n't"", 'shown', 'singing', '.it', 'bit', 'confusing', 'still', 'nice', 'watch']",N/A

The DVD gives you a good bit of understanding about how this revolutionary sound came to be. This group is the brainchild of Simon Cowell (sp), who I understand is quite popular among reality TV fans. The film exposes his intent to bring operatic voice to pop music. Obviously, his vision was the right vision at the right time, as this group promises to introduce the world to virtually new genre of musical sound that will only rise in popularity.You will learn of the diverse backgrounds of the four young singers, each themselves, previously successful soloists.
