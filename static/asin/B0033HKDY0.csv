I had never used Instant Video, easy and worked beautiful on my MAC.  I loved each episode.  It is a FAMILY drama that has a key character in Amy a teen.  But don't be discouraged, it intertwines all members of the family and friends.  I especially enjoyed the story line with Jack (the grandfather)starting a romance.  So few shows today show adult characters and their life changes.  The beautiful backdrop is a bonus.  I may have to visit the Canadian Rockies.Please come out with Season Two on Instant Video!  It may give me the incentive to look into Prime Membership.The show is hard to find in the states.",5,Wonderful Family Drama,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,753,"['saw', 'episode', 'accident', 'one', 'day', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'ordered', 'season', 'had', 'never', 'used', 'Instant', 'Video', 'easy', 'worked', 'beautiful', 'MAC', 'loved', 'episode', 'FAMILY', 'drama', 'key', 'character', 'Amy', 'teen', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'discouraged', 'members', 'family', 'friends', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'line', 'Jack', 'grandfather', 'starting', 'romance', 'few', 'shows', 'today', 'show', 'adult', 'characters', 'life', 'changes', 'beautiful', 'backdrop', 'bonus', 'may', 'have', 'visit', 'Canadian', 'Rockies.Please', 'out', 'Season', 'Two', 'Instant', 'Video', 'may', 'give', 'incentive', 'look', 'Prime', 'Membership.The', 'show', 'hard', 'find', 'states']",N/A
1320086,A29URL2MNFSAPT,B0033HKDY0,Amazon Customer,"[36, 37]",This is a Canadian show filmed in the beautiful mountains of Alberta. It's about a teenage girl who is a talented horse whisperer. Lots of family drama and growing pains. Well worth it if you've never seen or heard of it. It's definitely something you could watch with your parents or your kids.,4,Fantastic family friendly series,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,295,"['Canadian', 'show', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'mountains', 'Alberta', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'talented', 'horse', 'whisperer', 'Lots', 'family', 'drama', 'growing', 'pains', 'Well', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'definitely', 'something', 'could', 'watch', 'parents', 'kids']",N/A
1320087,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B0033HKDY0,A_Plain_Janeite,"[4, 5]","I bought the ""Complete First Season"" last year (the original Canadian release). It contains all 13 episodes from that season (as was shown on the CBC network in Canada). And I've been holding off buying more seasons, hoping the price would go down as they released season 5.Now the GMC network is releasing Heartland seasons (so far, just 2).  However, you need to be advised that they actually contain more than 1 season in the set.As I noted in my title, the ""Complete First Season"" (GMC label) is in fact Season 1: Episodes 1-13 AND Season 2: Episodes 1-9.  GMC's ""Complete Second Season"" (that I purchased last week) is really Season 2: Episodes 10-18 AND Season 3: Episodes 1-14.So if you're trying to mix and match the original Canadian releases, which apparently they're phasing out (Amazon had been selling them- seasons 1 to 4 to be exact, but they're now disappearing in favor for the GMC labeled ones), be advised you can't without missing some episodes along the way!Now I'm going to have to either purchase only the GMC editions (who knows when the other half of season 3, and half of season 4 will be released by GMC), or only the Canadian ones..  Not sure why E1 Entertainment decided to back this re-release being the Canadian editions were Region 1, and worked just fine for those of us in the US.  What they should have done was convert them to BluRay discs if they wanted to revamp the line.Even though I'm in the US, I discovered this show on the CW network, and ended up finding all the episodes online, so I'm now caught up with everything that's been put out, and am anxiously awaiting season 6!FYI, Canada is set to release Season 5 in this September, around the time of the newest season (6) being aired on Sunday Sept. 16th.  Whether Amazon US will carry that is not known (but you could check the Canadian side at Amazon.ca  or eBay).  For official info I recommend looking up search ""CBC Heartland"", or add /cbcheartland  on Facebook.Hope this helps clear up any confusion!!",5,"BE ADVISED: ""GMC"" Release Is Season 1: Ep. 1-13 & Season 2: Ep. 1-9",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,2002,"['bought', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'last', 'year', 'original', 'Canadian', 'release', '13', 'episodes', 'season', 'was', 'shown', 'CBC', 'network', 'Canada', ""'ve"", 'been', 'holding', 'off', 'buying', 'more', 'seasons', 'hoping', 'price', 'would', 'go', 'down', 'released', 'season', '5.Now', 'GMC', 'network', 'releasing', 'Heartland', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'just', '2', 'However', 'need', 'be', 'advised', 'actually', 'contain', 'more', '1', 'season', 'set.As', 'noted', 'title', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'GMC', 'label', 'fact', 'Season', '1', 'Episodes', '1-13', 'AND', 'Season', '2', 'Episodes', '1-9', 'GMC', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'purchased', 'last', 'week', 'really', 'Season', '2', 'Episodes', '10-18', 'AND', 'Season', '3', 'Episodes', '1-14.So', ""'re"", 'trying', 'mix', 'match', 'original', 'Canadian', 'releases', 'apparently', ""'re"", 'phasing', 'out', 'Amazon', 'had', 'been', 'selling', 'them-', 'seasons', '1', '4', 'be', 'exact', ""'re"", 'now', 'disappearing', 'favor', 'GMC', 'labeled', 'ones', 'be', 'advised', 'ca', ""n't"", 'missing', 'episodes', 'way', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'purchase', 'only', 'GMC', 'editions', 'who', 'when', 'other', 'half', 'season', '3', 'half', 'season', '4', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'GMC', 'only', 'Canadian', 'ones..', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'E1', 'Entertainment', 'decided', 'back', 're-release', 'being', 'Canadian', 'editions', 'were', 'Region', '1', 'worked', 'just', 'fine', 'US', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'was', 'convert', 'BluRay', 'discs', 'wanted', 'revamp', 'line.Even', ""'m"", 'US', 'discovered', 'show', 'CW', 'network', 'ended', 'up', 'finding', 'episodes', 'online', ""'m"", 'now', 'caught', 'up', 'everything', 'been', 'put', 'out', 'am', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'season', '6', 'FYI', 'Canada', 'set', 'release', 'Season', '5', 'September', 'time', 'newest', 'season', '6', 'being', 'aired', 'Sunday', 'Sept.', '16th', 'Whether', 'Amazon', 'US', 'will', 'carry', 'not', 'known', 'could', 'check', 'Canadian', 'side', 'Amazon.ca', 'eBay', 'official', 'info', 'recommend', 'looking', 'up', 'search', 'CBC', 'Heartland', 'add', '/cbcheartland', 'Facebook.Hope', 'clear', 'confusion']",N/A

The horses are beautiful and the actors are very good at interacting with them. It's all realistic. I love the show because it is enjoyable for everyone. Not just teenagers, my mom watches the show with me. It's one of the only good horse shows on tv. WildFire was a great show until it ended. So other than Heartland I don't know any horse shows on tv. Which upsets me greatly. I have been around and riding horses since I was 2 years old. Since my family and I have owned numerous horses. Right now I am taking care of nine.

I came across the series on Netflix and was hooked and have purchased 4 out of the 5 seasons available (still need to get season 3).  It is a shame that Hollywood and New York can no longer create shows that are not completely filled with blood, sex, nudity, Drugs, cursing, immoral & amoral characters as heros, violence etc.  I'm in no way a prude, have watched and enjoyed my share of R rated movies and even dropped a few F bombs, but in the last few years, I've been leaning toward BBC & Canadian productions because they are producing TV shows with stories and characters that I can admire.  Without being to smarmy, Heartland has good character development, values and moral messages that I can admire, relate to and enjoy.
