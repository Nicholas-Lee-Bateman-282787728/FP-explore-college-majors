435882,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,6304798466,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[7, 7]","This is a  clever late 90's Japanese film with English subtitles about ballroom dance lessons. No, this isn't your Arthur Murray dance studio.  The subtitles are very easy to read and clearly defined.  The cast is a memorable diverse, intriguing, group of characters taking dance lessons.Since the Japanese are reserved about public intimacy, dance lessons are of a clandestine nature. The consensus here is that men are considered losers if they take dance lessons or lessons are just a reason to hold a woman in your arms.The story focus is on Mr. Shugiyama, an overworked middle-aged man with a wife, daughter at home.  From his commute, he spots a beautiful woman in a window as she teaches her students dance steps.His intention is to meet the girl, but she blatantly tells him that she takes this serious and if he is there just to meet her, then he should not take lessons.  She adamantly informs him that this is a classroom, not a disco. To &quot;save face&quot;, he hangs in there and learns to dance rather than become a failure.The array of characters:A balding, quirky, Mr. Aoki, has been dancing for five years, he wears a long frizzy wig piled loosely on his head because he believes the wig gives him inspiration to be like his idol, Donny Burns, a Latin dance king. While he dances, he gives these funny facial movements that equate with his suave, cool, bawdy dance numbers. He comes across like a combination Don Juan and Madonna striking a pose! He is known to dance &quot;creepy.&quot;An extremely shy and reserved heavy-set man with thick glasses gets his fulfillment learning to dance. He becomes alive once he learns the steps.Also, an abrasive dance instructor who isn't afraid to spew her insults when needed and she trades verbal jabs with the male customers.As the movie reaches the climax, a number of dance halls and amateur dance contests are held.An unusual treat is the Drifter's song &quot;Save the Last Dance For Me.&quot; It is the only English lyrical song, quite fitting for the occasion. This movie is a gem, full of humor and silliness.

435886,A15S44J4NHU4LS,6304798466,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[11, 19]","I've had two people recommend this film to me when I told them I enjoyed Baz Luhrman's Strictly Ballroom.  This is a Japanese film that tells the story of a businessman named Mr. Sugiyama and how he fell in love with ballroom dancing.  Mr. Sugiyama is married and has a daughter.  Everyday on his way back home from work, he admires a woman from the subway at the stop in front of the Kishikawa dance school.  One day, he gets up the nerve to drop by the school and asks about lessons.  At first, he wants to see how far he can take this crush with Mai (the woman he's been admiring), but is quickly set straight when she tells him she doesn't date students.  She also hopes that Mr. Sugiyama took up dancing because he truly wanted to dance and not as an excuse to ask her out.What I like about this film is that it doesn't take any short cuts in the story telling.  You don't see Mr. Sugiyama as a beginner in one scene and a world-class competitor the next.  You see him struggle and develop his love for dance slowly.  He really sweats it out.  (However, this virtue becomes a vice as the film sometimes seems to drag.)  There are no delusions of grandeur on Mr. Sugiyama's part.  He doesn't wish to compete in an international competition (such as the one Mai lost in some time ago).  He just loves to dance.  It is entirely believable that Mr. Sugiyama's commitment to dance rekindled the flame/love Mai had for competing.  Mai appears to be a bored snob when we first see her looking longingly out the dance studio window.  By the end though, she looks like a hopeful, first-time competitor ready to take on the world.An implicit theme throughout this whole film is the Japanese culture.  We learn that ballroom dancing is something that most people are ashamed to be associated with (as are any public displays of affection).  We learn that families are formed out of practical reasons and not out of passion or love.  (I suppose Mr. Sugiyama's character in the film embodies the typical Japanese -- polite, courteous, and, sadly, repressed.)  There are many other interesting and humorous characters in the film as well.  We have an eccentric  office worker who dons a wig and turns into Donny Burns world-champion Latin dancer at night.  A chubby middle-aged man that sweats profusely but picks up dance steps quicker than Mr. Sugiyama.  A squirrelly man that has some dance experience before but decides to help and hang out at the dance studio.  An emotional woman who holds two jobs and finds time to practice for competition.  A discerning private detective that understands Mr. Sugiyama's affair with dancing.  Mr. Sugiyama's teenage daughter that thinks her father has gone mad.  Truly colorful characters.Had I not been set up to compare this film with Strictly Ballroom, I might've enjoyed Shall We Dance more.  One note about the music in this film.  It just isn't as inspiring and as integral as it is in Strictly Ballroom.  Sure, it's ballroom dancing with classical music.  But it has no passion.  In Strictly Ballroom, when they were dancing the Paso Doble you could associate the music with the love between the dance partners.  In Shall We Dance, you almost have to ignore the music to appreciate the story.This is a very character-driven story.  Nonetheless, it's a good film for the family.

435887,A20VXYT5DL0ZC6,6304798466,"Amazon Customer ""Creator, Entrepreneur, Free ...","[16, 16]","""Shall We Dance?"" is my favorite film of all time! Is that saying too much? No!! I'm a great admirer of Japan and Japanese culture, but I was caught totally unaware when I walked into the theater to see this movie. I ended up coming back 15 times, and was only stopped from seeing it again because the theatrical run ended. Then luckily, the movie came out on LaserDisc(not DVD), so I could watch it in better quality video at home. I also have the VHS for my bedroom VCR. The movie translates very well into home video--probably because it's such a warm and sweet-hearted movie. I can't think of another movie that approaches this one for pure ethereal beauty and pure enjoyment. The music is also so great. I won't give anything away but the music is a big part of the success of this movie, but in a very subtle way. I also love without reservation every actor in the film, and every character. From the beautiful, graceful lovely Mai and elegant Sugiyama-san, to Donny Burns-Latin Champ-impersonator Aoki-san and ballroom terror Toyoko-san, and warm hearted Tamako-sensei, you have to love the entire cast of characters. Also, the cinematography is out of this world, capturing the flow of ballroom excitement and beauty and also wistful scenes of Tokyo at night (make sure you watch the entire sequence of the exquisite closing credits at the end). Director and screenwriter Masayuki Suo deserves an honorary Academy Award for this creation of supreme perfection. I encourage you to go to the Amazon.com DVD page for this film and vote to make it available on disc--(it's a national tragedy that this film is not yet available in digital format). I guarantee you won't be sorry to buy this video, and you'll join the thousands of Americans clamoring for its release on DVD.

While adding my rave review to the list, I ask the question:  Why tamper with perfection?  The US-made re-make is about to hit the screens with A-list cast Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon.  I know for a fact that a large majority of the U.S. population will never watch a subtitled film, so I can understand the reason for re-making it.  However, I think everyone who has written here will agree that there's no way this Gere/Lopez/Sarandon re-make will capture the spirit of the original, certainly not the two driving forces that propel it.First, there's the drudgery of the Japanese salaryman...like millions of others Tokyo-based wage slaves, Koji Yakusho's unhappy accountant takes his hours-long train ride home each evening, beaten down a bit more by his lot in life.  He spies a dance studio, a dancer...and slowly - night after night - develops a small dream.  The night he finally decides to get off the train is a magnificent scene...there's a complete struggle going on inside his body to hop off and stay off that train.  I wonder how the re-make will possibly capture even a smidgen of that angst.Second, there are the strong mores of Japanese society and the overrriding ethos of ""the upright nail gets hammered down.""  In the U.S., to a large extent, the spirit of the individual endures - if you want to dance, you dance.  In Japan, not only is Koji Yakusho's character battling himself, he's battling his country's perception of his decision to dance, which basically can be summarized as:  ""Guys don't.""  Again, I challenge the re-make to capture this tension.I will point out that I'm not dead set against any re-make:  I'm a big fan of the Argentinian film ""Nueve Reinas,"" and thought that 2929 Entertainment's recently released ""Criminal"" really compared quite well to the original.  Still, I urge those of you with any interest in seeing the upcoming release of ""Shall We Dance"" to do yourself a favor and invest 118 minutes in the original, a great look at Japanese society.",5,Why tamper with perfection,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,2112,"['see', 'one', 'hundred', 'well-written', 'summaries', 'pages', 'average', 'five-star', 'rating', 'adding', 'rave', 'review', 'list', 'ask', 'question', 'Why', 'tamper', 'perfection', 'US-made', 're-make', 'hit', 'screens', 'A-list', 'cast', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'know', 'fact', 'large', 'majority', 'U.S.', 'population', 'will', 'never', 'watch', 'subtitled', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'reason', 're-making', 'However', 'think', 'everyone', 'who', 'written', 'here', 'will', 'agree', 'way', 'Gere/Lopez/Sarandon', 're-make', 'will', 'capture', 'spirit', 'original', 'certainly', 'not', 'two', 'driving', 'forces', 'propel', 'it.First', 'drudgery', 'Japanese', 'salaryman', 'millions', 'others', 'Tokyo-based', 'wage', 'slaves', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'unhappy', 'accountant', 'hours-long', 'train', 'ride', 'home', 'evening', 'beaten', 'down', 'bit', 'more', 'lot', 'life', 'dance', 'studio', 'dancer', 'slowly', 'night', 'night', 'small', 'dream', 'night', 'finally', 'get', 'off', 'train', 'magnificent', 'scene', 'complete', 'struggle', 'going', 'body', 'hop', 'off', 'stay', 'off', 'train', 'wonder', 'how', 're-make', 'will', 'possibly', 'capture', 'even', 'smidgen', 'angst.Second', 'are', 'strong', 'mores', 'Japanese', 'society', 'overrriding', 'ethos', 'upright', 'nail', 'hammered', 'down', 'U.S.', 'large', 'extent', 'spirit', 'individual', 'want', 'dance', 'dance', 'Japan', 'not', 'only', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'character', 'battling', 'battling', 'country', 'perception', 'decision', 'dance', 'basically', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'Guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'Again', 'challenge', 're-make', 'capture', 'tension.I', 'will', 'point', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'dead', 'set', 're-make', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Argentinian', 'film', 'Nueve', 'Reinas', 'thought', '2929', 'Entertainment', 'recently', 'released', 'Criminal', 'really', 'compared', 'quite', 'well', 'original', 'Still', 'urge', 'interest', 'seeing', 'upcoming', 'release', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'do', 'favor', 'invest', '118', 'minutes', 'original', 'great', 'look', 'Japanese', 'society']",Shall We Dance?

435890,A1SSA0MF161794,6304798466,Ava Barbi,"[11, 17]","While the 2004 remake was lost in translation, Masayuki Suo's original ""Shall We Dance?"" is a stunning visual poem that also serves as the filmmaker's commentary about Japanese society -- with tongue-in-cheek ribbing of U.S. society.  Suo's masterpiece snickers at American vanity and artificiality, especially in the toupee-wearing character.Actor Kji Yakusho is winning as Shohei Sugiyama, a hardworking man who in yearning to satisfy his emotional void, ends up violating a Japanese taboo.  In his new pastime -- learning to dance in public -- he experiences youth, vitality and joy.  Along with some fancy footwork, he also learns to unleash his feminine principle, and it is that full balance which allows him to reconnect with his wife.Transplanting Suo's ""Shall We Dance?"" to America is like injecting profanity into a haiku.  The American cinematic imaginaton is as subtle as a migraine, except for films such as the satirical ""Lost In Translation,"" which excelled in its appreciation of Japanese culture and was moody in its existentialism.So it comes as no surprise that while I admired Jennifer Lopez's dancing and loved the soundtrack, I interpreted the 2004 remake of ""Shall We Dance?"" as a dumbed-down version for the kinds of U.S. citizens who thrive on fat jokes and homophobic humor.  A movie that focuses more on insults makes emotionally and intellectually inferior people feel better about overworking themselves only to find at retirement age that an Enron has robbed them of a financially solvent future.In the remake of ""Shall We Dance?"" I found the verbal and visual references to Bobby (the plus-size single mom who was taking dance lessons) as a fat cow to be highly offensive.

As much as I enjoyed Gere, Sarandon and Lopez in the American version of this film, this Japanese original has more soul, I think, and more interesting messages. In the American film, a key message seems to be about married couples understanding and being witness to each other's lives, while in the Japanese version a key message is about daring to love ballroom dance for its own sake -- in a culture that frowns on ballroom romanticism. And another message in the Japanese story is about dance partners needing to trust each other as they perform their roles: ""The man protects the woman."" This film pulls you into really caring about the simple, middle-aged accountant who dares to become a real ballroom dancer, and the traditional wife who tries to figure out and accommodate the changes in her husband. A great film to have on hand because you will want to watch it again. POSTSCRIPT: I just watched this film again -- the full 136-minute version in Japanese with no dubbing or subtitles. I don't speak Japanese. AND I STILL LOVED IT. Every single minute. I'd forgotten how touching the husband-wife relationship is and how much the lead actor, Koji Yakusho, reminds me of Gregory Peck. (His wife reminds me of Renee Zellwegger.) Yes, the American version is entertaining enough, but the Japanese version is everything a story on film should be, making you really care about the characters.

They go to work, they are bored for the whole day, accomplish a few tasks,  work late to appease their boss, once in a while go out and drink with the  co-workers (if 2~3 times a week means sometimes) and go home and hopefully  catch their kids still awake if they're lucky.  Repeat same tasks  tommorrow.No wonder they wear strictly starched collars and seem like  robots to most people.  They all look the same, dress the same and act the  same.  It is the Group mentality that permeates this.Shohei Sugiyama is  in the same boat, but he wants more out of life than to spend his life  working for the company and filling out his spare time with the mundane  homelife.  So one day, on the subway, he spots a beautiful dancer and all  the emotions he locked away in his soul begins flowing out.  Soon, he joins  and secretly takes lessons to see the dancer every day.However, the  dancer, Mai, has no interest in him.  While dance has opened up Shohei to  life and art, it has made Mai hard.  She is a professional dancer, under  the rigors of competition, politics and time ticking away.  She is the cold  person that Shohei has shed.In an American movie, Shohei and Mai would  have eventually learned that they loved each other and hooked up (like  Strictly Ballroom and The Cutting Edge), but in Shall we Dance, the  relationship becomes more genuine.  Shohei teaches Mai to become a person  again, not to take competitive dancing so seriously and Mai shows Shohei  that work, material possessions are not everything.  They need each other,  and later on, Shohei realizes that it not on a sexual level.The other  characters are very good as well.  Tanaka plays an overweight beginner who  was forced to dance as exercise for his diabetes.  He is first painfully  shy but by the end, dance brings him out of his shell.  The other is Aoki,  the wig wearing Latino dancer wannabee.  He is deeper than we all first  make him out to be (as comic relief).  Dance is his life and he sees no  meaning beyond it.  It crushes him when he is embarrassed by a fellow  dancer and cannot show his face in the studio anymore.  The final  interesting character is his wife, who has accepted her domicility, only to  have it crashing down on her when her husband begins doing things without  her knowing about it.Shall We Dance? is less about dancing and more  about what impact dance can have on peoples lives.  This is a movie that  focuses on the characters and puts interesting ballroom dance competitions  as a backdrop. It is a film full of life, but not of life easily found.  Try Shall we Dance?

That film has its own charms, but this story really works better in its original context.  The overworked, suffocating salaryman living his life of quiet desperation is a familiar figure to the Japanese, whose preoccupation with respectability and conformity can weigh heavily on those seeking professional acceptance and success.

In addition to dance, there is a connection with the characters and their personal struggles.  The story has a fortitude and strength in character development and plot that is timeless.  Unlike the US version of the same film, it is not about some middle aged professional well-monied, power monger wanting to go slumming on the sly with a ghetto dance teacher.  This version is about a man who is struggling to find meaning in his life which is filled with an emptiness he can't quite grasp.  He supports his family by extended hours and commute times in some sort of accountancy type firm.  He connects to the despair he sees on the face of the woman peering out from the dance studio window, this isn't wonderlust, this is a shared sense of loss, futility, and disappointment.  Watching these two characters find and fill the source of this loss through dance is powerful and lends hope to all of us.Additionally the dance scenes are wonderful.

His co-worker, a geek, transformed himself into another person when he was on the dance floor.  I thought it was funny that he could wear a wig and impersonate a sex symbol.

435906,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6304798466,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[28, 29]","Masayuki Suo won over audiences across the world with ""Shall We Dance?"", a sweet crowd-pleasing dance flick. Despite its serious look at Japanese culture, it's a charming and funny story about a man struggling to inject some sparkle into an unfulfilling life, and the dance that helps him do it.Shohei Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) is a successful businessman, with a lovely house, loving wife, and a lovely teen daughter. But though he has everything a person could want, he is unhappy and doesn't even know why. But one day on the way home, he sees a beautiful woman (Tamiyo Kusakari) looking sadly out of a dance studio. He sees her there every day, and eventually he hops out of the train and signs up for dancing lessons.Since ballroom dancing is frowned on in Japan, Sugiyama keeps his lessons a secret, and it's a bit of a struggle for him to overcome his natural stiffness. Because of his odd hours and the perfume on his shirts, his wife is afraid that he's having an affair, and hires a detective to follow him. But after Mai rejects him, Sugiyama begins to have a love affair -- with ballroom dancing itself.There's something very sweet and pure about ""Shall We Dance?"", which you hardly ever see in movies. Not just because of the lack of naughty material in it, but because the story itself has a sweet joy just ingrained into the dancing, the dialogue, and the way Sugiyama drags himself from the doldrums.In Japan, ballroom dancing is considered kind of embarrassing and seductive, which gives Sugiyama's passion for the dance a ""forbidden fruit"" quality. But the film doesn't lapse into cliche territory. Sugiyama's affection for the beautiful Mai is based in something more than attraction, since he senses that she is as sad as he is. Their growing relationship is a beautiful thing to watch.But don't think that it's all dancing and depression. Masayuki Suo gives the film some comic flair with a systems analyst who clearly has fantasies about being a wild-dancing Latin lover. But the director never descends to slapstick or hijinks, preferring to stick to the warm'n'fuzzy brand of comedy. The scripting is solid, with plenty of quotable gems like ""Dance is more than the steps. Feel the music and dance for sheer joy."" That could have been the tagline for this film.Koji Yakusyo is entirely lovable as Sugiyama -- you can actually see this everyman getting happier as he gets more and more into his dancing lessons. Ballerina Tamiyo Kusakari plays Mai with sensitivity and depth, managing to convey a wealth of emotion in small gestures. The supporting characters, like the graceless Tanaka and the hysterical Aoki aren't as well fleshed out, but they are lovable.""Shall We Dance?"" is a unique little movie about joie de vivre. It's not a truly great film, but it is a wonderful one that will leave you with a smile on your face.",5,"Yes, I'd love to ""Dance""",1097798400,"10 15, 2004",2004,2846,"['Masayuki', 'Suo', 'won', 'over', 'audiences', 'world', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'sweet', 'crowd-pleasing', 'dance', 'flick', 'serious', 'look', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'charming', 'funny', 'story', 'man', 'struggling', 'inject', 'sparkle', 'unfulfilling', 'life', 'dance', 'do', 'it.Shohei', 'Sugiyama', 'Koji', 'Yakusho', 'successful', 'businessman', 'lovely', 'house', 'loving', 'wife', 'lovely', 'teen', 'daughter', 'everything', 'person', 'could', 'want', 'unhappy', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'why', 'one', 'day', 'way', 'home', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'Tamiyo', 'Kusakari', 'looking', 'sadly', 'dance', 'studio', 'day', 'eventually', 'train', 'signs', 'up', 'dancing', 'lessons.Since', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'frowned', 'Japan', 'Sugiyama', 'lessons', 'secret', 'bit', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'natural', 'stiffness', 'odd', 'hours', 'perfume', 'shirts', 'wife', 'afraid', 'having', 'affair', 'detective', 'follow', 'Mai', 'Sugiyama', 'have', 'love', 'affair', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'something', 'very', 'sweet', 'pure', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'movies', 'Not', 'just', 'lack', 'naughty', 'material', 'story', 'sweet', 'joy', 'just', 'ingrained', 'dancing', 'dialogue', 'way', 'Sugiyama', 'doldrums.In', 'Japan', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'considered', 'kind', 'embarrassing', 'seductive', 'Sugiyama', 'passion', 'dance', 'forbidden', 'fruit', 'quality', 'film', ""n't"", 'lapse', 'cliche', 'territory', 'Sugiyama', 'affection', 'beautiful', 'Mai', 'based', 'something', 'more', 'attraction', 'as', 'sad', 'growing', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'watch.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dancing', 'depression', 'Masayuki', 'Suo', 'film', 'comic', 'flair', 'systems', 'analyst', 'who', 'clearly', 'fantasies', 'being', 'wild-dancing', 'Latin', 'lover', 'director', 'never', 'slapstick', 'hijinks', 'preferring', 'stick', 'warm', ""n'fuzzy"", 'brand', 'comedy', 'scripting', 'solid', 'plenty', 'quotable', 'gems', 'Dance', 'more', 'steps', 'Feel', 'music', 'dance', 'sheer', 'joy', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tagline', 'film.Koji', 'Yakusyo', 'entirely', 'lovable', 'Sugiyama', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'everyman', 'getting', 'happier', 'more', 'more', 'dancing', 'lessons', 'Ballerina', 'Tamiyo', 'Kusakari', 'Mai', 'sensitivity', 'depth', 'managing', 'convey', 'wealth', 'emotion', 'small', 'gestures', 'supporting', 'characters', 'graceless', 'Tanaka', 'hysterical', 'Aoki', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'are', 'lovable', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'unique', 'little', 'movie', 'joie', 'vivre', 'not', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'wonderful', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'smile', 'face']",Shall We Dance?

Over the weekend, I checked the film out from my local library. Now that I have seen the film, I can't imagine seeing the US version.The premise of the film revolves around a sucessful but bored accountant named Shoshei Sugiyama. One night after cocktails with his co-workers, as he is going home on the train, he looks out the window and notices a pretty, young Japanese woman (Mei Kishikawa) gazing out of a window from a ballroom dance studio. For a couple of nights, he sees her but then he decides to go see about taking dance lessons from her. Shoshei ends up being in a class of beginner ballroom dancers with an eccentric dance instructor. Over the course of the film, Shoshei grows to enjoy ballroom dancing as well as enjoying life itself again.I enjoyed this cute comedy a lot. The supporting cast was hilarious like the lecherous Tomio Aoki who has a preference for young, pretty dancers for his dance partners. The female dance instructors were pretty funny, namely Toyoko Takahashi who is a big drama queen. The choreography was amazing. The actors and actresses did a splendid job of pulling off the dance moves including the times they had to collide into other dancers. I don't know why the US had to make their own version of this endearing Japanese comedy. I have not seen that version nor will I ever. Nothing will copmare to ""Shall We Dansu?"".

435910,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,6304798466,Ernest Jagger,"[6, 6]","This film, released in 1997, and starring director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's regular, Koji Yakusho, in the title role is a wonderfully charming film. Sugiyama, (Koji Yakusho) [one of my favorite actors] is an overworked accountant whose life seems to be very unfulfilling to him. He has a beautiful wife, a charming daughter, and a new home. Moreover, he is well secured in his job. However, while on his commute from work to home he notices a woman on the top floor of a dance studio. He is fascinated at seeing the woman [maybe even sexually]. However, as the film moves along, we see that it is the drudgery of his life which causes him to seek out this dancer, and take dancing lessons.One of the better roles in the film is by Aoki, (Naoto Takenaka). He gives a fabulous performance as a co-worker who has been secretly going to these dance lessons for years. I thought he was just fabulous in his respective role. There are some very hilarious moments with him and the other dancers in the film. This is not an action film, but a charming comedy-drama about one man who decides that he is willing to take the risk of learning how to dance in a society that does not look at ball-room dancing very favorably: at least in the film. The strong mores of Japanese society keep Aoki, and Sugiyama from letting anyone else know what they are doing every Wednesday night.However, the wife of Sugiyama begins to suspect that her husband may be having an affair, as she smells perfume on his clothes. Sugiyama has kept this secret from everyone, including his wife. Therefore, his wife hires a private investigator to look into his activities, and what he is doing on these wednesday nights. This is not a film with complex plots, or action, or tense situations [except Sugiyama and Aoki's fears of being exposed], but is is sure one hell of a charming film that is a real treat to watch. I thought everyone in the film was incredible, and a delight to watch.

His life drags on with an almost morbid drudgery. He even ""sold his soul"" to the company to buy the house that he lives in with his wife and daughter (only fairly wealthy people can even think of affording houses in urban Japan). But something still seems missing regardless of his great material success. Then one day he sees the stunningly beautiful Mai Kishikawa from his train. She stares longingly at some point in the distance from a window. Sugiyama's life changes at that moment. Lured by Kishikawa's beauty, he joins the dance school where she teaches. He then enters, for Japanese culture, the forbidden world of dancing. Though he takes a huge risk by doing so, the experience energizes him. But his wife becomes suspicious and hires a private detective to find out where her husband goes at night.So begins the story of ""Shall we &#12480;&#12531;&#12473;?""; a gorgeous and moving film about opening minds and lives to new possibilities. By the end of the movie most of the main characters have experienced life transformations that expand their horizons irreversibly. Their previous myopic perspectives explode into new visions of how to live meaningfully. And none of these changes take place in isolation. All of the characters learn from each other. The snobbish Mai learns to open up by observing Sugiyama's struggles with dancing. Likewise, Sugiyama gains a new appreciation of his family life through his successes and failures with the dance school. And the hilarious Mr. Aoki sheds his masks and finally finds his true self. Even the private detective hired by Sugiyama's wife starts turning up at dance halls and competitions. Basically, everyone learns not to take life so seriously. The director seems to be asking his Japanese audience to overcome certain shameful aspects of their culture and start enjoying themselves. And, most of all, that one can redeem oneself and grow even after suffering great shame and embarrassment.The movie is liberating in more than a thematic sense. Beautiful shots of dance halls and Japanese city streets abound. The camera dances with the dancers in many scenes. A lot of thought went into the cinematography and it shows. The film also has a deliberately meditative pacing. No intense action here. This encourages interactive reflection and introspection rather than passive acquiescence. It engages the viewer who decides to engage. And though the focus of the film involves competition, the film ends up not emphasizing the usual ""win win"" aspect of tournaments. This isn't a typical Hollywood movie about rising to the toppermost of the poppermost. It contains complex multi dimensional characters who have real flaws. It's inspiring, funny, tragic, cute, intense, and beautiful all at once.""Shall we &#12480;&#12531;&#12473;?"" presents a great example of mature Japanese cinema. Anyone who thinks that Japanese films consist merely of flame-throwing robots and underwear obsession will find a huge surprise here. The movie targets adults directly and it deals with its subject matter intelligently and scrupulously. Anyone interested in Japanese culture or just in great cinema should see it.",5,Learn to let go...,1137196800,"01 14, 2006",2006,3256,"['Mister', 'Sugiyama', 'problem', 'Everything', 'strived', 'business', 'world', 'turned', 'up', 'empty', 'life', 'drags', 'almost', 'morbid', 'drudgery', 'even', 'sold', 'soul', 'company', 'buy', 'house', 'wife', 'daughter', 'only', 'fairly', 'wealthy', 'people', 'can', 'even', 'think', 'affording', 'houses', 'urban', 'Japan', 'something', 'still', 'missing', 'regardless', 'great', 'material', 'success', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Mai', 'Kishikawa', 'train', 'longingly', 'point', 'distance', 'window', 'Sugiyama', 'life', 'changes', 'moment', 'Lured', 'Kishikawa', 'beauty', 'dance', 'school', 'where', 'then', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'forbidden', 'world', 'dancing', 'huge', 'risk', 'doing', 'so', 'experience', 'wife', 'suspicious', 'private', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'husband', 'night.So', 'story', 'Shall', '12480', '12531', '12473', 'gorgeous', 'moving', 'film', 'opening', 'minds', 'lives', 'new', 'possibilities', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'experienced', 'life', 'transformations', 'expand', 'horizons', 'irreversibly', 'previous', 'myopic', 'perspectives', 'explode', 'new', 'visions', 'how', 'live', 'meaningfully', 'none', 'changes', 'take', 'place', 'isolation', 'characters', 'learn', 'other', 'snobbish', 'Mai', 'open', 'up', 'observing', 'Sugiyama', 'struggles', 'dancing', 'Likewise', 'Sugiyama', 'gains', 'new', 'appreciation', 'family', 'life', 'successes', 'failures', 'dance', 'school', 'hilarious', 'Mr.', 'Aoki', 'masks', 'finally', 'true', 'self', 'Even', 'private', 'detective', 'hired', 'Sugiyama', 'wife', 'turning', 'up', 'dance', 'halls', 'competitions', 'Basically', 'everyone', 'not', 'take', 'life', 'so', 'seriously', 'director', 'be', 'asking', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'overcome', 'certain', 'shameful', 'aspects', 'culture', 'start', 'enjoying', 'most', 'one', 'can', 'redeem', 'grow', 'even', 'suffering', 'great', 'shame', 'embarrassment.The', 'movie', 'liberating', 'more', 'thematic', 'sense', 'Beautiful', 'shots', 'dance', 'halls', 'Japanese', 'city', 'streets', 'abound', 'camera', 'dancers', 'many', 'scenes', 'lot', 'thought', 'went', 'cinematography', 'film', 'also', 'deliberately', 'meditative', 'pacing', 'intense', 'action', 'here', 'interactive', 'reflection', 'introspection', 'rather', 'passive', 'acquiescence', 'viewer', 'who', 'engage', 'focus', 'film', 'competition', 'film', 'up', 'not', 'emphasizing', 'usual', 'win', 'win', 'aspect', 'tournaments', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'rising', 'toppermost', 'poppermost', 'complex', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'real', 'flaws', 'inspiring', 'funny', 'tragic', 'cute', 'intense', 'beautiful', 'once', 'Shall', '12480', '12531', '12473', 'great', 'example', 'mature', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Japanese', 'films', 'consist', 'merely', 'flame-throwing', 'robots', 'underwear', 'obsession', 'will', 'find', 'huge', 'surprise', 'here', 'movie', 'targets', 'adults', 'directly', 'subject', 'matter', 'intelligently', 'scrupulously', 'Anyone', 'interested', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'just', 'great', 'cinema', 'should', 'see']",Shall We Dance?

This movie is absolutely great. It's very similar to Tampopo. After seeing this movie I checked on Amazon, and they do share their main actor (Kji Yakusho) so maybe it's not a coinceidence.Shall We Dance and Tampopo are both about someone changing their lives by trying to become proficient in a certain area (dancing and noodle cooking), in both cases the main characters are an older man and a younger woman, and both movies are tender Japanese comedies that satirize movie conventions and Japanese culture.The difference is that in Tampopo, an older man is motivating and training a younger woman, and in Shall We Dance it is the younger woman who motivates and train the older man. Yakusho plays the role of a man stuck in the Japanese work rut, who sees a beautiful pensive woman at the window of a dance school every evening when he passes by on the train. So he decides to enroll to be able to dance with that woman.

It's good social satire and heartwarming without being dopy. The acting is sensational, and it is often sidesplittingly funny. ""Shall We Dance"" offers informative satirical insights into modern Japanese culture such as self-conscious shyness, subjugation of the individual to workaholic values, and inflexible gender roles, through a clever screenplay marvelously directed and performed. The script and plot are tight and it is almost impossible to stand outside the story. While the westerner with no experience in Japan will find the movie enjoyable, the depth of the social satire and irony will appeal to anyone who has even a superficial understanding of modern Japanese culture.

The supporting cast and the lead actor are middle-aged. The lead businessman, Shohei Sugiyama (played to perfection by Koji Yakusho) is drawn to dance with false hopes and perseveres to achieve more than the attention of Mai, whose face enticed him from the start to the dance studio. His elusive hope,icily pretty and elegant, Mai (Tamiya Kusahari)lead dance-instructress is played with controlled detachment, maintaining a formal and emotional distance long enough to make you feel like the novice dancer, Shohei, waiting to come to life with her personal attention. What this film conveys is much larger than the trite plot summaries in the reviews. The script makes you feel the novice who changes over time, gaining confidence and regard. A subplot with Shohei's wife and daughter about to expose his private passion (dance)as equivalent infidelity only adds to the tension and merges into the denouement. The changes inside the colorful supporting characters unfold as the film moves toward a joyous finish with many other revelations. When you appear to be let down by the longing replaced with reality, the film moves upward still, achieving other delightful 'lessons' beyond the expected romance between the pining novice and his instructress. It cannot be stated enough that only in Japan, such painful personal honesties or effronteries by the actors are handled with careful delicacy and honesty, conveyed with such grace and politeness that makes it impossible to duplicate by other countries.

There are a few draggy spots, but hey, other than that anyone should have a really good time with this film.This film needs to be viewed with a Japanese sensibility, and not an American one to fully appreciate the gravitas of this matter.Excellent companion films would be STRICTLY BALLROOM,MARILYN HOTCHKISS' SCHOOL OF BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM,THE COMPANY,WHITE NIGHTS and BILLY ELLIOT.The Hollywood remake with Richard Gere and JLo is okay, but really lacks the humbleness and warmth of the original.",4,Japan's taboo: DANCING? 4+1/2 enthusiastic stars,1185580800,"07 28, 2007",2007,1635,"['one', 'perfectly', 'pleasant', 'heartwarming', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'charm.SHALL', 'WE', 'DANCE', 'sneak', 'peak', 'Japanese', 'taboo', 'dancing', 'yes', 'dancing', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'Maybe', 'way', 'Americans', 'may', 'view', 'men', 'who', 'do', 'ballet', 'Japanese', 'view', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'same', 'just', ""n't"", 'manly', '.What', 'more', 'issue', 'here', 'how', 'Japanese', 'view', 'closeness', 'man', 'woman', 'husband', 'wife', 'relationships', 'are', 'stoic', 'functional', 'yet', 'distant', 'cool.Mr', 'Sugiyama', 'reason', 'MUST', 'take', 'up', 'dancing', 'reason', 'initially', 'dancing', 'becomes', 'obsession', 'then', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'wife', 'private', 'detective', 'follow', 'whereabouts', 'So', 'lovely', 'story', 'Mr.Sugiyama', 'cast', 'very', 'colorful', 'characters', 'hidden', 'taboo', 'world', 'ballroom', 'dancing.The', 'film', 'really', 'dancing', 'how', 'peoples', 'emotions', 'larger', 'humanity', 'actors', 'play', 'parts', 'heartwarming', 'convincing', 'way', 'just', 'downright', 'delightful', 'film.Why', 'four', 'stars', 'Well', 'let', 'give', '4', '1/2', 'are', 'few', 'draggy', 'spots', 'hey', 'other', 'anyone', 'should', 'have', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'film.This', 'film', 'needs', 'be', 'viewed', 'Japanese', 'sensibility', 'not', 'American', 'one', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'gravitas', 'matter.Excellent', 'companion', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'STRICTLY', 'BALLROOM', 'MARILYN', 'HOTCHKISS', 'SCHOOL', 'OF', 'BALLROOM', 'DANCING', 'AND', 'CHARM', 'THE', 'COMPANY', 'WHITE', 'NIGHTS', 'BILLY', 'ELLIOT.The', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'JLo', 'okay', 'really', 'humbleness', 'warmth', 'original']",Shall We Dance?

435928,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6304798466,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 11]","At the beginning of ""Shall We Dansu,"" the 1996 Japanese film Americanized as ""Shall We Dance"" last year, it is explained that in Japan ballroom dancing is regarded with great suspicion.  After all, Japan is a country where couples do not go walking hand in hand or say, ""I love you"" to each other.  Those who flout convention to engage in such activities are certified eccentrics to most of their fellow citizens, but that is not how they see themselves.  Certainly that is not how Shohei Sugiyama (Kji Yakusho) sees himself.Sugiyama is a forty-something who goes to sit at a desk and work in an office building and then goes home to his wife (Hideko Hara) and daughter (Ayano Nakamura).  As he commutes home the train stops at a station and when he looks up, Sugiyama sees a lovely young woman looking out the window of a dance school.  Every time the train stops at that station, there she is.  So one day he gets off the train and goes up to the dance studio where he signs up for lessons.  At first it looks like Sugiyama has two left feet, but he seems slightly more competent than his two classmates in beginning ballroom, the slightly overweight Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) and the extremely talkative Tokichi Hattori (Yu Tokui).The problem is that the dancing class ends up not being taught by Mia Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari, a ballerina by occupation), the woman in the window, but rather by the school's director, Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura).  Meanwhile, Mia gives personal lessons to others while Sugiyama can only sneak glances.  We learn that Mai was once a world level competitive dancer, but now she is reduced to these circumstances.  When she senses that she is Sugiyama's goal, Mia politely chastises him.  But by then it has become clear that Mia is a symbol of an ideal, and that Sugiyama is there to dance.Of course his wife has become equally suspicious and hires a detective to find out what her husband is up to when he keeps coming home late from work.  They are not as aware of how Sugiyama has changed because of his lessons as we are, but they have noticed the differences.  Perhaps the biggest cultural differences this movie reflects from a Western perspective is that when the detectives and Sugiyama's family find out what he is up to, they choose bewildered acceptance over anguish recrimination, although a final confrontation is forthcoming in the wake of the big dance contest.The biggest difference between ""Shall We Dansu"" and ""Shall We Dance"" is the casting and performance of Kji Yakusho.  The stories are essentially the same to such a degree that it really does make a big difference which of the two you watch first.  But Yakusho is such a figure of quiet dignity that he becomes the eye of the storm that is created around him by the hopes and dreams of his fellow dancers.  Sugiyama is brought into sharp contrast when his character discovers a kindred spirit at work in Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), who can only do the Latin dances he loves when he is wearing a stupid looking wig.  With Sugiyama thoughts and feelings are communicated more by how he stands than anything he says, which explains why his dancing becomes so important to him.Writer-director Masayuki Suo's film will certainly resonate more with a Japanese audience who can better appreciate what he has to say about the repression of males in that society.  But it is being on the outside looking in that makes us enjoy this film because it does compel us to think across cultural lines.  That is why it makes sense that I am not only comparing ""Shall We Dansu"" with ""Shall We Dance"" in terms of DVDs I watched this week, but also with ""The Grudge"" as well.",5,Mr. Sugiyama decides to take some ballroom dancing lessons,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,3678,"['beginning', 'Shall', 'Dansu', '1996', 'Japanese', 'film', 'Americanized', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'last', 'year', 'explained', 'Japan', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'regarded', 'great', 'suspicion', 'Japan', 'country', 'where', 'couples', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'walking', 'hand', 'hand', 'say', 'love', 'other', 'who', 'flout', 'convention', 'engage', 'such', 'activities', 'are', 'certified', 'eccentrics', 'most', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'not', 'how', 'see', 'Certainly', 'not', 'how', 'Shohei', 'Sugiyama', 'Kji', 'Yakusho', 'himself.Sugiyama', 'forty-something', 'who', 'sit', 'desk', 'work', 'office', 'building', 'then', 'home', 'wife', 'Hideko', 'Hara', 'daughter', 'Ayano', 'Nakamura', 'home', 'train', 'stops', 'station', 'when', 'up', 'Sugiyama', 'lovely', 'young', 'woman', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'dance', 'school', 'time', 'train', 'stops', 'station', 'So', 'one', 'day', 'train', 'up', 'dance', 'studio', 'where', 'signs', 'up', 'lessons', 'first', 'Sugiyama', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'slightly', 'more', 'competent', 'two', 'classmates', 'beginning', 'ballroom', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'Masahiro', 'Tanaka', 'Hiromasa', 'Taguchi', 'extremely', 'talkative', 'Tokichi', 'Hattori', 'Yu', 'Tokui', '.The', 'problem', 'dancing', 'class', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'taught', 'Mia', 'Kishikawa', 'Tamiyo', 'Kusakari', 'ballerina', 'occupation', 'woman', 'window', 'rather', 'school', 'director', 'Tamako', 'Tamura', 'Reiko', 'Kusamura', 'Meanwhile', 'Mia', 'personal', 'lessons', 'others', 'Sugiyama', 'can', 'only', 'sneak', 'glances', 'learn', 'Mai', 'was', 'once', 'world', 'level', 'competitive', 'dancer', 'now', 'reduced', 'circumstances', 'When', 'Sugiyama', 'goal', 'Mia', 'politely', 'then', 'become', 'clear', 'Mia', 'symbol', 'ideal', 'Sugiyama', 'there', 'dance.Of', 'course', 'wife', 'become', 'equally', 'suspicious', 'detective', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'husband', 'up', 'when', 'coming', 'home', 'late', 'work', 'are', 'not', 'aware', 'how', 'Sugiyama', 'changed', 'lessons', 'are', 'have', 'noticed', 'differences', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'cultural', 'differences', 'movie', 'Western', 'perspective', 'when', 'detectives', 'Sugiyama', 'family', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'up', 'choose', 'bewildered', 'acceptance', 'anguish', 'recrimination', 'final', 'confrontation', 'forthcoming', 'wake', 'big', 'dance', 'contest.The', 'biggest', 'difference', 'Shall', 'Dansu', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'casting', 'performance', 'Kji', 'Yakusho', 'stories', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'such', 'degree', 'really', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'two', 'watch', 'first', 'Yakusho', 'such', 'figure', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'eye', 'storm', 'created', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'fellow', 'dancers', 'Sugiyama', 'brought', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'when', 'character', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'work', 'Tomio', 'Aoki', 'Naoto', 'Takenaka', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'Latin', 'when', 'wearing', 'stupid', 'looking', 'wig', 'Sugiyama', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'are', 'communicated', 'more', 'how', 'anything', 'why', 'dancing', 'so', 'important', 'him.Writer-director', 'Masayuki', 'Suo', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'resonate', 'more', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'who', 'can', 'better', 'appreciate', 'what', 'say', 'repression', 'males', 'society', 'being', 'outside', 'looking', 'enjoy', 'film', 'compel', 'think', 'cultural', 'lines', 'why', 'sense', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'comparing', 'Shall', 'Dansu', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'terms', 'DVDs', 'watched', 'week', 'also', 'Grudge', 'as', 'well']",Shall We Dance?

It's about an everyday salary man named Sugiyama with a wife and child who has lost the joy in his life. While riding home on the Shinkansen (train), he happens to look up and see a woman looking mournfully out of the window of a dance studio. After the second night of seeing her at the window, he decides to go inside and check it out. His first motive to take classes at the dance studio was to meet the pretty dance instructor named Mai he saw standing at the window. But then as he learns to dance more, you can see he has found joy in ballroom dancing, thus bringing joy into his life. You can see the difference in how he rides his bike to work. :) Of course he has to keep this secret from his family. His wife even starts to think he's having an affair.And the other characters like Toyoko and Aoki-san are hilarious, especially when you see how serious they are about ballroom dancing. You don't have to be a fan of ballroom dancing to enjoy this film. You can see how Sugiyama's earnestness to dance has transformed everyone around him.

First, you can see what the ordinary Japanese semi-middle class family life is like. No guns or swords, no blood, no samurai or soldiers - this is a very cultural film about modern Japan. Secondly, this movie shows how much the Japanese people admire the European/Western culture (in this film's case the ballroom dancing, sportsmanship, and Blackpool!). If you are, or thinking about, learning Japanese, listen to how Tamako-sensei (the elderly female dance instructor) speaks. As well as speaks gently, she shows the gentle heart of the traditional Japanese lady. Koji Yakusho (Memoirs of a Geisha,Babel) has proved he is one of the most brilliant actors in Japan, and my favourite one is definitely Naoto Takenaka, who plays a funny funny bloke who specialises Latin dance to fill the 'gap' in his everyday life and hopefully find a nice girl too.FYI: Obviously I have already seen the Hollywood version of this film, but it's not the same thing at all. It's supposed to be a re-make of this Japanese original, but, in my view, it's a little bit too 'westernised' and almost feels like a different film.

435941,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,6304798466,moviemusicbuff,"[10, 10]","This is one of my favorite foreign films of all time! It deals with a middle-age businessman Mr. Sugiyama (Koji Yakusho) who leads a workaholic and dull life. One day as he rides the subway back home, his eye is fixed on a lovely dancer Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari). This leads him to take up ballroom dancing just to meet her -- there he meets up with other interesting characters who take up dancing. Soon Mr. Sugiyama finds great fulfillment and friendship as he participates in the ballroom dancing competition along with his fellow dancers. Not only that, but Mr. Sugiyama finds that his personal and family life, the lives of the other dancers, his instructors and all concerned are transformed for the better as a result. (I don't want to give away anymore! You have to watch it for yourself.)Even though I'm definitely not a dancer, this movie made me want to dance.  The viewer can fully identify with Mr. Sugiyama, who feels as though he has 2 left feet. (Also, ballroom dancing may not be a manly activity to get involved in.) The actor who steals the show in this movie is the one who plays Mr. Aoki (Naoto Takenaka) -- a ostracized colleague of Mr. Sugiyama who tries to get girls to dance with him through pretending to be the great Latin dancer Donnie Burns.  Aoki's exaggerated facial expressions and body movements are hilarious!  Tamiyo Kusakari does a great job of playing the lovely dancer Mai whose life is also transformed as she instructs these men and turns them from clumsy beginners to accomplished dancers.I loved this story because it deals with the theme of redemption and transformation.  It also talks about the interdependency of our lives upon one another and how we can effect positive change upon each other.  It talks about the importance of trusting one another and reconciling relationships.  All these important themes are captured in a heartwarming and hilarious comedy. It is rare to find a movie these days that will make you smile and feel good about life after you watch it. This is one of them.  It is such a great movie! Shall We Dance?

There is none of the emotional pain and distress that abounds in this movie.Sugiyama is a Tokyo work drone who has just bought a house, the ulitimate status symbol, and is now going to have to work for the rest of his life to pay for it, a fact which depresses him.  On his way home from work one night he sees a beautiful woman staring out of the window of a dance studio.  After a few more trips, always looking for her out of the train window, he gets up the courage to get off at the stop and go up to the studio.  In Japan, dancing is akin to one of the seven deadly sins, because even husbands and wives don't touch each other in public and do so with a stranger is more than embarassing. Since ballroom dancing not only involves touching, but being close to, a stranger in public, it is not regarded highly by society in general.The object of his affection, a beautiful champion ballroom dancer who made the finals at Blackpool, makes it quite clear he shouldn't be dancing just to get close to her, but to his surprise he finds that, even though he started out for that reason, he enjoys the dancing.  His older teacher soon enters him in a dance contest and he makes the final.As a ballroom dancer myself, I enjoy this film for the highly realistic portrayal of what it is like to learn to dance. I also empathise strongly with the characters, particularly the fat guy dancing to lose weight.  It is not easy to be one of society's outcasts, and all the dancers at the studio verge on outcasts.If you're quick enough reading subtitles and enjoy a truly great film that manages to be engrossing, subtle, heart-wrenching and yet uplifting, without all the need for Hollywood talk and special effects, then this is the film for you.

It has become a classic ""sleeper hit,"" probably more popular today than when first released in the mid 1990's.  The main plot path is well worn: middle-age family man (Koji Yakusyo) seeking another turn at bat with an unattainable woman-in-a-dance-studio-window (Tamiyo Kusakari).  By becoming an amateur expert dancer no less!  The script delivers sufficient surprises and subplots to ensure the viewer's full attention.  It also leaves no subplot loose ends, and provides feel-good happy endings all around (more or less).  Directing, acting, camera, and music (not all original) are first rate.  So are the subtitles!  In camera shots of the dance studio window from subway windows are especially well done.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",4,"Amusing, Poignant, Engaging, And Just Plain Charming.

435964,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,6304798466,Zack Davisson,"[9, 9]","Dancing has always been a form of rebellion.  From the unseemly closeness of the Waltz to the banned gyrations of Elvis the Pelvis to modern day Freak Dancing, the freedom of expression and sexuality that accompanies dancing has shocked and shamed across the centuries, making heroes of those daring enough to challenge the rhythm of the music.  Heroes like Shohei Sugiyama.In the prescribed world of the Japanese salaryman, a pattern of life is expected.  ""The nail that sticks up gets hammered down"" is a familiar Japanese expression.  Middle-aged Shohei Sugiyama has always filled the role expected of him, going to work, doing his job and burying the passion of his soul into a deep and secret chamber.  One day, glimpsed in a window, he discovers something that revives the long-forgotten feelings and brings up that need for freedom and expression that he sought to stifle forever.  Fiery and sexy, dance instructor Mai Kishikawa ignites not only his passion for her, but Shohei's passion for life.  As he comes to say, ""At my age, it's embarrassing to say so, but every day I feel so alive. ""A comedy, Masayuki Suo's ""Shall we Dance?"" is peppered with wacky elements and crazy juxtapositions that one would expect of this situation.  Tomio Aoki,  played by Naoto Takenaka (""Ping Pong,"" ""Waterboys,"") possibly my favorite modern Japanese actor, is an ill-fitting mentor to the blossoming Shohei.  A co-worker at the same office, on the weekends Tomio transforms into the flamboyant and be-wigged Donny Burns, Latin world champion.  Only the monotonous and repressed world of the Japanese salaryman could produce such a character, as those who have lived with the freedom of expression all their lives would feel no need to rebel in such a manner.There is a lightness and grace to ""Shall we Dance?"" that is a-typical of a Japanese film, and it is no wonder that it has been so successful abroad.  Masayuki Suo is a fantastic director, and I would love the success of ""Shall we Dance?"" to open the door to American releases of some of his other films, including the Sumo comedy ""Sumo do, Sumo don't.""I have never seen the American re-make, so I can offer no comparisons other than to say that Masayuki Suo's ""Shall we Dance?"" is not just a great Japanese movie, but a great movie period.",5,The lust for passion and the freedom of dancing,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",2005,2291,"['Dancing', 'always', 'been', 'form', 'rebellion', 'unseemly', 'closeness', 'Waltz', 'banned', 'gyrations', 'Elvis', 'Pelvis', 'modern', 'day', 'Freak', 'Dancing', 'freedom', 'expression', 'sexuality', 'dancing', 'shocked', 'shamed', 'centuries', 'making', 'heroes', 'daring', 'enough', 'challenge', 'rhythm', 'music', 'Heroes', 'Shohei', 'Sugiyama.In', 'prescribed', 'world', 'Japanese', 'salaryman', 'pattern', 'life', 'expected', 'nail', 'up', 'hammered', 'down', 'familiar', 'Japanese', 'expression', 'Middle-aged', 'Shohei', 'Sugiyama', 'always', 'filled', 'role', 'expected', 'going', 'work', 'doing', 'job', 'burying', 'passion', 'soul', 'deep', 'secret', 'chamber', 'One', 'day', 'glimpsed', 'window', 'something', 'long-forgotten', 'feelings', 'up', 'need', 'freedom', 'expression', 'sought', 'stifle', 'forever', 'Fiery', 'sexy', 'dance', 'instructor', 'Mai', 'Kishikawa', 'not', 'only', 'passion', 'Shohei', 'passion', 'life', 'say', 'age', 'embarrassing', 'say', 'so', 'day', 'feel', 'so', 'alive', 'comedy', 'Masayuki', 'Suo', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'peppered', 'wacky', 'elements', 'crazy', 'juxtapositions', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'situation', 'Tomio', 'Aoki', 'played', 'Naoto', 'Takenaka', 'Ping', 'Pong', 'Waterboys', 'possibly', 'favorite', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'ill-fitting', 'mentor', 'blossoming', 'Shohei', 'co-worker', 'same', 'office', 'weekends', 'Tomio', 'transforms', 'flamboyant', 'be-wigged', 'Donny', 'Burns', 'Latin', 'world', 'champion', 'Only', 'monotonous', 'repressed', 'world', 'Japanese', 'salaryman', 'could', 'produce', 'character', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'freedom', 'expression', 'lives', 'would', 'feel', 'no', 'need', 'rebel', 'such', 'manner.There', 'lightness', 'grace', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'a-typical', 'Japanese', 'film', 'wonder', 'been', 'so', 'successful', 'abroad', 'Masayuki', 'Suo', 'fantastic', 'director', 'would', 'love', 'success', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'open', 'door', 'American', 'releases', 'other', 'films', 'including', 'Sumo', 'comedy', 'Sumo', 'do', 'Sumo', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'American', 're-make', 'can', 'offer', 'comparisons', 'other', 'say', 'Masayuki', 'Suo', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'period']",Shall We Dance?
