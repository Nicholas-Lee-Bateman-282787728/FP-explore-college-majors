I tried to watch this movie three times and I have yet to finish it. This movie is moronic to the extreme. It is stupit and lame, and the only reason I want to finish watching it is because I paid about $10 for it. Please be warned that this is a bad, unintelligent movie. If you don't believe me, read the reviews in the DVD rental company that starts with an N and end in X. By the way, I only remember seeing John Candy in this movie from a distance driving a car!

Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[3, 3]","Since this movie is available from many different video companies (it's obviously in the public domain because no one wants anything to do with it), I will let you know that I am writing in response to the Trinity company release, which should be cited for false advertising with its cover picture of John Candy.John Candy has only a very, very minor role in the movie. It's an Anthony Newley/Stephanie Powers vehicle with a prominent role for Isaac Hayes, although he gets remarkably little to do.But don't let any of the star names entice you, this movie is an embarrassment for all involved with it and a total waste of time for anyone watching it.The writing is amateurish, the editing is even worse, and the music is a total insult to the audience. There's no point in talking about the plot, because there isn't one worth mentioning. There is nothing funny about anything at all in the entire film.The only reason this movie is still around to sully our lives is that it's free--the video companies don't have to pay anything for it, and it's no wonder why.",1,Absolutely awful.,1252627200,"09 11, 2009",2009,1063,"['movie', 'available', 'many', 'different', 'video', 'companies', 'obviously', 'public', 'domain', 'one', 'anything', 'do', 'will', 'let', 'know', 'am', 'writing', 'response', 'Trinity', 'company', 'release', 'should', 'be', 'cited', 'false', 'advertising', 'cover', 'picture', 'John', 'Candy.John', 'Candy', 'only', 'very', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'movie', 'Anthony', 'Newley/Stephanie', 'Powers', 'vehicle', 'prominent', 'role', 'Isaac', 'Hayes', 'remarkably', 'little', 'do.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'star', 'names', 'entice', 'movie', 'embarrassment', 'involved', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'anyone', 'watching', 'it.The', 'writing', 'amateurish', 'editing', 'even', 'worse', 'music', 'total', 'insult', 'audience', 'point', 'talking', 'plot', ""n't"", 'one', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'nothing', 'funny', 'anything', 'entire', 'film.The', 'only', 'reason', 'movie', 'still', 'sully', 'lives', 'free', 'video', 'companies', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'anything', 'wonder', 'why']",N/A

902584,A15LK8DSFQZZ52,B00097E6S6,"Patricia R. Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[6, 8]","I don't know who wrote the blurb for this movies - John Candy does not ""head up the cast"" of this movie unless you consider under a minute of screen time ""heading up"" the cast. It's not about a jealous husband trying to get his wife back. It's about a gold-digging wife (Stephanie Powers) who sleeps with her exhusband (Anthony Newley) on a regular basis while draining her present husband dry. And setting up a deal to curry political favor by sleeping with the man running for mayor of wherever this city is supposed to be. They can't even get the name right - Anthony Newley's character is ""Sweeney"" not ""Skeet"". The photo of John Candy on the box is from a later time, also. It's a young John Candy in the film and he has about 1 minute of screen time.The drawing power for me was Isaac Hayes and John Candy. Isaac Hayes plays Anthony Newley's buddy/sidekick and he is in the movie for much too short a time. a young John Candy plays a cop in a ""blink and you'll miss him"" role. So if you thought that pairing would be cool to see, you're probably right, it would be. It didn't happen in this movie.If you like a long pointless movie about characters you don't care about doing stuff that doesn't make any sense to anyone, this is the movie for you. Especially if you're not a John Candy fan, you probably won't notice he's in the movie. If you want to see something funny with Isaac Hayes or John Candy, keep looking.

It started out slow, so I thought it was going to be a made-for-boring movie but it picked up, was fun to watch and wound up being a good movie.John Candy's picture appears on the cover of the DVD case but he is not the main character or STAR of the movie.  I'm sure he was put on the cover because he has greater Star Recognition than all the others.  His character, who comes in halfway through the movie, is  just supporting.
