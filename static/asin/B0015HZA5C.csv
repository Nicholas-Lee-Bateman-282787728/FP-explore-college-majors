A family movies into a house and ends up solving a missing child case from 30 years ago.  The acting was alright although I wasn't wild about  ~ Fairuza Balk, who played the female lead.  She seemed rather stiff at some points and at others it seemed as though she was trying too hard.  It's odd because I did enjoy her in The Craft.  It seemed that everything came together really quickly in the end.  The movie never really explained much about what happened to the son or what kind of medical problems the mother was having.  The only explaination given was the mother was driving and wrecked the car and son was in car and ended up in a coma.  It would have been nice to have know if she hit a tree or another vehicle or what exactly.  Also, it would have been nice to have know what sort of mental ailments she had aside from guilt.

Very bad acting by unknown actors.  Usually expected. But these people were the bottom of the barrel of Bad actors. The movie plot was very weak. But most annoying, was the overused sound effect of the startling  loud banging of a large steel door, at the end of a long hallway sound, that ALL  these elcheapo Horror movies use anymore, to surprise you, especially after a very quiet scene, where the actors are practically whispering to each other.  Then, you already expect the loud BANG, noise to happen. And it does.  Too often.  I hate movies with no substance, and excessive annoying startling sound effects.  GRINDhouse Road must be a gag title, the Movie Producer chose, because this garbage is rehashed Grind Garbage effects and acting and plot used in all the low budget trash.

1149512,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B0015HZA5C,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[13, 13]","Grindstone Road will not score any points for originality; the plot and the ""twist"" at the end have been used and re-hashed quite a few times. But there is something eerie about this film - the way that it is delivered, perhaps, that makes it worthwhile. Fairuza Balk is toned down a bit (at least during the first half of the movie) and has lost that famous scowl from her younger days. Here, she convincingly plays a grieving mother, and since the film involves a total of about six characters, the success of the film rests on Balk's shoulders, and she delivers a steady performance. I have always considered Fairuza Balk, Asia Argento, and Parker Posey to be very underrated actors. But here, she gets a boost from the eerie atmosphere of the film's setting. This movie is strikingly similar to ""Danika"" is you have not seen that one. This one winds up somewhere between a remake of The Ring and Godsend. If you combine those two films with a cheaper budget, you've got this one. This is purely a genre flick, so if you are a fan of Balk or the genre in general, pick this up. If not, you will probably not like the movie.",4,Has its Moments,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",2008,1126,"['Grindstone', 'Road', 'will', 'not', 'score', 'points', 'originality', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'have', 'been', 'used', 're-hashed', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'something', 'eerie', 'film', 'way', 'delivered', 'perhaps', 'worthwhile', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'least', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'lost', 'famous', 'scowl', 'younger', 'days', 'Here', 'convincingly', 'grieving', 'mother', 'film', 'total', 'six', 'characters', 'success', 'film', 'rests', 'Balk', 'shoulders', 'steady', 'performance', 'have', 'always', 'considered', 'Fairuza', 'Balk', 'Asia', 'Argento', 'Parker', 'Posey', 'be', 'very', 'underrated', 'actors', 'here', 'boost', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'setting', 'movie', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'Danika', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'one', 'up', 'somewhere', 'remake', 'Ring', 'Godsend', 'combine', 'two', 'films', 'cheaper', 'budget', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'purely', 'genre', 'flick', 'so', 'are', 'fan', 'Balk', 'genre', 'general', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'movie']",Grindstone Road

1149514,A2VPDTH3KMTHIE,B0015HZA5C,"Richard A. Back ""Video Voyeur""","[11, 11]",I am always pleased when I am able to find a well made movie that relies on a good story and acting instead of high priced special effects.  Grindstone Road is one of them.  Fairuza Balk stars as a despairing woman who is agonizing over her feeling of guilt caused by having a quarrel with her 11 year old son immediately preceding a horrible automobile accident that left him in a coma and on life support years ago.  Even though her supportive husband wants to move on with life and forget the son she refuses to do so.  They buy an old house in the country in an attempt to start their life over but find out that the house has a past of its own including the disappearance years ago of an 11 year old boy with the same first name as their comatose son.  Hannah{Balk} begins to have visions and sleepwalking dreams and begins researching old newspaper articles concerning the missing boy.  Is she losing her mind over the guilt over her son or is she really seeing visions of the missing boy?  Is she somehow connected with the disappearance?  Is the former teacher who first appeared when she initially came to look at the house somehow involved?  Are her kindly neighbors who told her about the house and its past somehow not telling her everything?  All are revealed in the fast paced ending.  all in all a very worthwhile way to spend an hour and one half.

1149515,A3R4XIOYH1OOPV,B0015HZA5C,"Stephanie C ""Stephanie""","[5, 5]","This is one of those movies that you read so many negative reviews about that you either don't bother with it, or find a good price and check it out just to see if it's really that bad. I'd seen previews for it and it always caught my eye so I decided to get it and am glad I did.A good movie doesn't have to be full of A-listers. And I wish there wasn't some stigma that if it didn't make it to the box office, it must not be very good. Grindstone Road is entertaining, has a good story line, and has just enough twists to keep you guessing. Everything doesn't have to keep you on the edge of your seat from scene one to the end to still be a good solid movie. Grindstone Road holds it's own.So basically there's a couple, Hannah and Graham. They have a little boy named Daniel who's in a coma from a bad car accident he and Hannah were in. Wrenched with guilt as any mother would be, her and Graham try to put what happened behind them by moving away from the city to try and put the pieces of their lives back together again. Graham seems to have already given up on Daniel ever coming back to them, while Hannah refuses to believe that, or even let it cross her mind. She never gives up hope.As soon as they move into their farmhouse, strange things start happening that only seem to happen to Hannah. She's hearing things, seeing things, and seems to be getting messages of the paranormal kind that she doesn't quite understand but wants to find out. Graham on the other hand thinks she's just mentally and emotionally lost it. After all, he's not seeing and hearing these things but has tried to be a supportive husband for her ""fragile state"". Bottom line: he doesn't believe her and finds logic in everything she keeps trying to tell him. Whatever he can't find logic in.. then he chalks it up to her not dealing with Daniel and the accident, and thinks she's just losing it.To say anymore will give away alot of the movie. That's the basic premise and things just take off from there. There's never any dull or boring moments. It was just suspenseful enough to keep you guessing while trying to put the pieces together of why these things were happening. There's clues throughout the movie that finally come together around the last 5-10 minutes, so you're not left dazed and confused with the whole thing. What I really like is this is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and find some clue or something new you missed each time before.I think it was put together really well and really built up to a great ending. Even at the point where you've figured it all out as far as who's who and what's what, it still peaks your curiosity of wanting to know what's going to happen next. I would highly recommend this movie because it's actually a pretty good movie. It has just enough elements of any good suspense/thriller to hold your interest, while keeping you guessing and waiting for what's going to happen next. It all falls together with great timing... not too predicatable but doesn't leave you in the dark either.Rent it or buy it at a good price.
