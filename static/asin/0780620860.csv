30173,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0780620860,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","It's a bit ""Huh!"" to me, that Paul Rudd seems to be more marketable now that he's older, rather than when he was younger and exuded that teen heartthrob vibe. Rudd's a good-looking dude, a darn capable actor, and he touts the ability to deliver one-liners in a wickedly dry way, which probably helped to cast him in teen flicks likeClueless (Special Whatever! Edition)and OVERNIGHT DELIVERY. Yet, years later, it's films likeKnocked Up - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)andForgetting Sarah Marshall (Widescreen)that have made him more of a household name, even though he hasn't really changed things up. On the other hand, Reese Witherspoon has always stood out, was tapped for stardom from jump. OVERNIGHT DELIVERY is a little known gem, made in 1998. I'm not even sure if it actually had a theatrical run, but it does star Paul Rudd and Reese Witherspoon, and their performances are enough for me to consider this romantic comedy road flick a near must-see classic.Students Wyatt Tripps (Rudd) and his girlfriend Kimberly (Christine Taylor) have been going out for years, even though they attend different colleges hundreds of miles apart. When Tripps thinks his girl is cheating on him (with someone named the Ricker), he gets hammered and composes a nasty letter in retaliation and fires it off via overnight delivery. But then he learns that his suspicion is wrong (""The Ricker's a dog!""). So the hapless Wyatt finds himself scrambling on a cross country trip, with only 24 hours to intercept that letter and accompanied by a cynical  fellow student who part times as a stripper (she helped him pen that poison letter). And, honestly, when this stripper is played by Reese Witherspoon, well, who really cares if Tripps ends up retrieving that written McGuffin or not.Paul Rudd has always been likeable, and, here, you can't help but pull for his square, idealistic, kinda wound up character, even if you do get frustrated with how long he comes to his senses. Because, even while he's getting his Galahad on and pursuing his too-good-to-be-true girlfriend, there's Reese Witherspoon, man, who's sitting right next to him, and she's never looked hotter and she's quietly pining away. Reese does well as Ivy, tempering her character's sarcastic, hard-bitten edge with a veiled sweetness and vulnerabity. There's a certain wildness to Ivy. Not only is she a stripper and dates professors, she also flashes dudes on the road (in a PG-13 kind of way) and she dines and dashes. Not that I'm condoning not paying for meals, but this girl rocks, and again it's Reese Witherspoon playing her. So it's pretty much a sure thing that Paul Rudd will sooner or later get over his cluelessness.OVERNIGHT DELIVERY is romantic and energetic and it's funny. It reminds me quite a bit ofThe Sure Thing, one of my all-time favorite John Cusack movies, and, in fact, there are times when Paul Rudd seems to be channeling John Cusack. Tripps and Ivy do get into some hilarious improbable scrapes, some of which are even life-endangering. As it turns out, Paul Rudd is also pretty handy with the physical comedy. The two leads get nice support from Christine Taylor and Larry Drake. Christine Taylor (DODGE BALL, THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE) has the thankless role of Tripps' sweetheart, all sweetness and light shooting out of her bum, but you know, chances are, she won't end up with the guy. Larry Drake, whom I've only ever seen in the slasher horror DR. GIGGLES, is a friggin' hoot as the persistent (and kinda manic) overnight delivery guy, on his first day running the delivery route. He's tapped as the villain in the piece, but really he's just a guy doing his job and it's just too bad that Paul and Reese have to get that package back. So pity poor Dr. Giggles, who ends up being steamrolled by undergrad romance.",4,"""The Ricker's a dog!

Paul Rudd, who has done fine work elsewhere (Clueless, The Object of My Affection) is way over-the-top way too often and should have been hemmed in more by director Jason Bloom (Bio-Dome). Rudd plays Trips, a college student who sends his old high school sweetheart a hate note when he finds out she's been cheating on him. When she manages to convince him otherwise, he decides to intercept the letter, which just happens to have been sent--are you sitting down?--by overnight delivery.Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie) as Trips' girlfriend Kimberly and the always-watchable Reese Witherspoon as Ivy, a fellow student (and exotic dancer) who offers to drive Trips cross-country to Kimberly's college, emerge relatively unscathed. In Taylor's case, it's because she only appears at the beginning and the end of the movie; in Witherspoon's, it's because her character is simply a lot less silly (and more believable) than Rudd's--although she does perform a striptease and engage in a couple of other fairly demeaning acts.More than anything, Overnight Delivery resembles one of those John Cusack vehicles from the 1980s like The Sure Thing or Say Anything. If you've already seen those movies (along with John Hughes' entire output from the same era) and if you're a really big Reese Witherspoon fan...well, it may just keep you mildly entertained for 87 minutes. And that's more than can be said for some romantic comedies--especially those overly complicated two-hour affairs that really only have 87 minutes worth of story to tell.

You must enjoy screwball road pictures; not quite the Gable and Colbert level, but still lots of diverting fun with, of course, the predictable but cute romance.Paul Rudd's character longs to see his distant sweetheart until he discovers, erroneously, that she's cheating on him.  Out of despair, he meets stripper, Reese Witherspoon in her early brunette 20's, who convinces him to send his girlfriend an overnight delivery- a douzy of a Dear Jane/Poison pen letter.  Once he finds he's all wrong about the unfaithfulness, the movie becomes a madcap, cross-country lunacy race against time as he and the stripper attempt to intercept the letter via fighting it out with a courier and each other.In the battle of the sexes, Rudd takes most of the beating physically as well as emotionally as the two leads  fight it out in a love-hate-don't know what you want scenario.There's no T&A;, except a bit from Paul Rudd- Reese does do a quick striptease down to her scivies before a brawl breaks out; there's some swearing for exclamation-which they could've left out and a bit of crude sexual humor early on.Good escapism, if you like RC's, and talented, as we know, actors.  I found it at Walgreens' cheapo pile.
