I was never once on the edge of my seat! Sam Neill is usually a great actor, but not in this one. The movie begins with a scene of Neill being told his wife and 2-year-old son were in an accident and the son died. This tragic scenario, which Neill responds to blandly, bears no relation to the rest of the movie, except to explain how tranquillizers got on the boat they were on - they played a minor role in one instance. The plot was not for a moment even remotely believable - Kidman pretends to fall in love with a man who is attacking her to get him off his guard, and then has sex with him. She goes from tormented and hysterical to totally in control like someone threw a switch in her brain. There was no excitement, no redeeming message, no emotional drama.

451768,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305161933,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 9]","Before director Phillip Noyce went on to do the Jack Ryan films, he made the little ditty known as Dead Calm.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched it, but let me tell you it was one of the first films that I have seen that would not allow me to pinpoint a direct love or hate.  At the beginning, when the plot was taking it's time to take off, I was not enjoying this film.  I felt that I was having trouble really understanding John and Rae and the relationship that they have.  I think this stayed with me throughout the film, and when they finally split up I finally began to enjoy it.I thought that there were some really wild scenes in this film.  The infamous ""rape"" scene was intense.  I never saw that coming at all.  The chemistry between Zane and Kidman was perfect, while the connection between Rae and John was not.  I think, honestly, Sam Neill was miscast in this film, or he was trying to play too deeply into his character.  At first I felt that we were watching a film about robots, but then I saw our characters go into the water and I knew that technology wasn't around in the 80s (for fear of other crew being shocked).  I also had trouble distinguishing the ethnic background of the characters.  Kidman was heavy on the Australian accent, but Neill and Zane seemed almost American.  Not that this normally makes any difference, but I think it would have put these characters on sturdier ground.I don't know my exact feelings on this film.  It was good, it was bad, then it somehow seemed good again.  The ending was completely laughable.  I really thought they should have just ended with the two of them in each other's arms, but instead they had toss in there a classic clich&eacute;d Hollywood moment.It was a well rounded film, but somehow some edges were getting dull.  It is almost like having a flat spot on your tire.  You hear the noise, but know that you can continue driving if you want to.  For those of you out there that are considering watching this film because you are a fan of Kidman, I would have you look at both sides of the story.  This is not the best work from her, but it does give us a good indication on where she is going with her acting career.  Second, she does get naked.  So, if acting doesn't matter and you would rather see Kidman naked, than Dead Calm may be the film for you.I don't know why I am so wishy-washy with this film, but I can't seem to want to say if it was bad or good.  Rather, more of a combination of both.  The scenes with Kidman and Zane are the best, while Neill is what brought this film down.  Nothing was revealed prior about him (or rather about anyone), so it is hard to connect with the characters, but it does carry some decent suspense.Overall, if you find this film for free somewhere, I think you should get it, but I wouldn't spend more than a penny on this film.Grade:  *** out of *****",3,You know what I'd love for lunch?,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",2004,2882,"['director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'went', 'do', 'Jack', 'Ryan', 'films', 'made', 'little', 'ditty', 'known', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'watched', 'let', 'tell', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'pinpoint', 'direct', 'love', 'hate', 'beginning', 'when', 'plot', 'was', 'taking', 'time', 'take', 'off', 'was', 'not', 'enjoying', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'really', 'understanding', 'John', 'Rae', 'relationship', 'have', 'think', 'stayed', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'split', 'up', 'finally', 'began', 'enjoy', 'it.I', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'wild', 'scenes', 'film', 'infamous', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'intense', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'chemistry', 'Zane', 'Kidman', 'was', 'perfect', 'connection', 'Rae', 'John', 'was', 'not', 'think', 'honestly', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'was', 'miscast', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'play', 'too', 'deeply', 'character', 'first', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'film', 'robots', 'then', 'saw', 'characters', 'go', 'water', 'knew', 'technology', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', '80s', 'fear', 'other', 'crew', 'being', 'shocked', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'distinguishing', 'ethnic', 'background', 'characters', 'Kidman', 'was', 'heavy', 'Australian', 'accent', 'Neill', 'Zane', 'seemed', 'almost', 'American', 'Not', 'normally', 'difference', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'characters', 'sturdier', 'ground.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exact', 'feelings', 'film', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'bad', 'then', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'good', 'again', 'ending', 'was', 'completely', 'laughable', 'really', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'ended', 'two', 'other', 'arms', 'instead', 'had', 'toss', 'classic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hollywood', 'moment.It', 'was', 'well', 'rounded', 'film', 'somehow', 'edges', 'were', 'getting', 'dull', 'almost', 'having', 'flat', 'spot', 'tire', 'hear', 'noise', 'know', 'can', 'continue', 'driving', 'want', 'are', 'considering', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'Kidman', 'would', 'have', 'look', 'sides', 'story', 'not', 'best', 'work', 'give', 'good', 'indication', 'where', 'going', 'acting', 'career', 'Second', 'get', 'naked', 'So', 'acting', ""n't"", 'matter', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'Kidman', 'naked', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'you.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'am', 'so', 'wishy-washy', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'good', 'more', 'combination', 'scenes', 'Kidman', 'Zane', 'are', 'best', 'Neill', 'what', 'brought', 'film', 'down', 'Nothing', 'was', 'revealed', 'prior', 'rather', 'anyone', 'hard', 'connect', 'characters', 'carry', 'decent', 'suspense.Overall', 'find', 'film', 'free', 'somewhere', 'think', 'should', 'get', 'would', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'penny', 'film.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

The same can certainly be said for the claustrophobic scene in which Sam Neill is left to siphon air through a pipe as he attempts to escape from a sinking ship.

It soon becomes apparent to Sam & Nicole that this guy isn't quite what he seems.There's some snappy dialogue here, to accompany the gorgeous scenery, plus some very tense moments aboard the two vessels we see in the picture.

But this is a film with its intent squarely on the box office; and, aside from the riveting Nicole Kidman, whose sensual vitality dominates the film, nothing so interesting materializes.  Nonetheless the tension is nearly unbearable even though it's all predictable: the idyllic couple aboard their yacht alone on the open ocean take on a psychopath whose ship is sinking.  Well, we can see he's a nut case from the first grin, and our only thought is, keep him away from your wife!  So naturally the husband, played with leading man true grit by Sam Neill, leaves her alone with him while he pokes around in the other vessel with anticipated horrific consequences.The close ups on Nicole Kidman's face are so intense you can feel her skin and almost smell her breath.  She proves to be quite an actress as she wrestles with the psycho, played with such fidelity by Billy Zane that I found myself repeatedly urging her to shoot the sickie.As the situation rapidly becomes impossible for our heroic couple, we realize that it's all very stagy, and upon further thought, fake; yet the intense photography, the seemingly veracious nautical business, and the fine acting by all, plus all that water, make it almost real.

Billy Zane and Sam Neil are really amazing in this movie, while I felt Nicole Kidman played her role out in a painfully average kind of way. I like that the director didn't pull any punches and showed you everything including a fairly graphic child death and a very uncomfortable quasi-rape scene. The movie moves along very nicely which surprises me because I didn't expect it to paced so well with such a small cast and locale. I also have to speak of the soundtrack composed by Graeme Revell, because it is just so incredibly well done and fits perfectly with the movie. Graeme comes from an industrial music background, which I am pretty well versed in, and some of that background leaks into his score, making it a very haunting and just extra special for me. Really my only complaint is Nicole Kidman, I feel she was miscast, but I must tell you, I am not a big fan of hers to begin with, so if you are a fan, you'll probably love her in this.

Though Nicole Kidman, Sam Neil and Billy Zane are all very recognizable actors, this film was set before their rise to stardome.  These are not only the three main characters in the film, but after the first 10 minutes, basically the only 3 charcaters in this film.  The setting is in seclusion out in the open ocean - 2 small ships.  One is the fancy little yaught that the Neil and Kidman characters are vacationing on, and the other, in the process of sinking, with a fleeing Billy Zane who comes abaord the couple's yaught.  The husband (Neil) tries to salvage the sinking ship while Zane rests up, but when he wakes, his true self comes to life as the films' villain, kidnapping the wife (Kidman) and stealing the yaught.The limited setting of a small yaught kept me wondering how interesting and up-to pace the plot would actually be.  Surprisingly, there are some little twists and surprising events along the way, mostly trying to figure out this villain - who he really is and what his intentions are.  He's obviously psychotic, yet at the same time very weird and unusual.  And while the suspenseful thrills aboard the yaught take place between Kidman and Zane, Neil is in a very tight spot, trapped inside the other ship quickly sinking.  In the end, like many thrillers, it's all not over till its over.  The climax finally picks up the greatest pace and came to a satisfying conclusion.Though there is only so much you can do with a film like this, the creators did a decent job of making the most out of it.

451785,A2MB7ZIINKGPY1,6305161933,"D. Steinmetz ""dwsteinme""","[0, 0]","I'm not sure what it is about this film that hooked me. I remember renting this right after it came out on video (you know, VHS tapes...anyone remember those??). I thought it was slick, but curiously subdued. Much as Steven Spielberg had done years earlier with 'Duel', director Phillip Noyce took a story and stripped it down to a bare-bones thriller. 'Duel' was reduced to &#34;man-vs-truck&#34;, and 'Dead Calm' became &#34;troubled couple-vs-deranged killer&#34;. A word of caution, a couple of spoilers ahead, although I don't reveal how the film ends.John (Sam Neill) and wife Rae (Nicole Kidman) take a trip on their yacht, yearning for isolation, solitude and a chance to heal after the catastrophic loss of their young son. This isolation comes back to haunt them later, as they appear to be in the middle of the ocean, and help is far away. After picking up a man in a rowboat (Billy Zane, in a eerily psychotic role), John is suspicious of the man's story, and decides to investigate the damaged ship Zane escaped from, leaving Rae alone with the survivor. The film splits at this point, telling almost two different tales. Rae, who soon discovers Zane is certifiable, and John, who enters into his own struggle to survive, going almost beyond the point of human endurance to stay alive on a slowly sinking ship. The movie is almost two films in one, which adds to the suspense. As John tries to keep the damaged schooner afloat, Rae has to survive the unpredictable mood swings of a mentally disturbed killer, not to mention his romantic advances, while trying to rescue her hubby.Again, this is a subdued film. I suspect Noyce was aiming for something like a Hitchcock effect, only barely missing the mark. Graeme Revell's creepy, minimalist soundtrack matches perfectly with the scenic solitude of the open ocean. Just as Spielberg had done with Dennis Weaver in 'Duel', who often found himself alone, driving through canyons and desert terrain, Kidman and Neill seem to be at the mercy of the open sea as much as the dangerous behavior of Billy Zane. Even though it's never really established how far they are from land, it's obvious there won't be any police station or Coast Guard ship around the next corner.The film is not without its issues. Rae is able to communicate with her hubby (although John can't speak to her, thanks to his radio being damaged), but she never thinks to send out a distress call or SOS? And towards the end of the film, Hughie (Zane's character) appears to be vanquished, and the couple appears to just carry on with their vacation...like nothing happened. Nicole has her sexy one-piece on, and Sam is making her breakfast and washing her hair. Right. I would have been making a bee-line for the nearest port or harbor.The film is short on dialog, and the action may be lacking for some, but all in all, 'Dead Calm' is a curious, well-crafted thriller. It's amazing to me now just how young Nicole Kidman looked in this. A sweet, peaches-and-cream complexion, and looking even younger than she actually was (early 20's). She looks, and sounds, like she just got out of high school. She has aged remarkably well. Sam Neill, an accomplished actor, is a bit one-dimensional in this...the stalwart Navy man trying to help his wife recover from their child's death, but he played it pretty well. It was Billy Zane (the only American in the cast) who nearly steals the show as a dangerously unbalanced psychopath.Those blokes down under occasionally pull off a cinematic gem, and this is one of them. It came as no surprise to learn this film was produced by Kennedy Miller Productions, who gave us the first two Mad Max movies. George Miller produced this just a few years after losing his long time partner, Byron Kennedy, who died in a helicopter crash in 1983.",5,Unusual little thriller.,1356480000,"12 26, 2012",2012,3803,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'film', 'hooked', 'remember', 'renting', 'right', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'know', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'anyone', 'remember', 'thought', 'was', 'slick', 'curiously', 'subdued', 'Much', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'done', 'years', 'earlier', ""'Duel"", 'director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'took', 'story', 'stripped', 'down', 'bare-bones', 'thriller', 'was', 'reduced', '34', 'man-vs-truck', '34', 'Calm', 'became', '34', 'troubled', 'couple-vs-deranged', 'killer', '34', 'word', 'caution', 'couple', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'do', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'how', 'film', 'ends.John', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'wife', 'Rae', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'take', 'trip', 'yacht', 'yearning', 'isolation', 'solitude', 'chance', 'heal', 'catastrophic', 'loss', 'young', 'son', 'isolation', 'back', 'haunt', 'later', 'appear', 'be', 'middle', 'ocean', 'help', 'far', 'away', 'picking', 'up', 'man', 'rowboat', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'eerily', 'psychotic', 'role', 'John', 'suspicious', 'man', 'story', 'decides', 'investigate', 'damaged', 'ship', 'Zane', 'escaped', 'leaving', 'Rae', 'alone', 'survivor', 'film', 'point', 'telling', 'almost', 'two', 'different', 'tales', 'Rae', 'who', 'soon', 'discovers', 'Zane', 'certifiable', 'John', 'who', 'own', 'struggle', 'survive', 'going', 'almost', 'point', 'human', 'endurance', 'stay', 'alive', 'slowly', 'sinking', 'ship', 'movie', 'almost', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'suspense', 'John', 'keep', 'damaged', 'schooner', 'afloat', 'Rae', 'survive', 'unpredictable', 'mood', 'swings', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'killer', 'not', 'mention', 'romantic', 'advances', 'trying', 'rescue', 'hubby.Again', 'subdued', 'film', 'suspect', 'Noyce', 'was', 'aiming', 'something', 'Hitchcock', 'effect', 'only', 'barely', 'missing', 'mark', 'Graeme', 'Revell', 'creepy', 'minimalist', 'soundtrack', 'matches', 'perfectly', 'scenic', 'solitude', 'open', 'ocean', 'Just', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'done', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', ""'Duel"", 'who', 'often', 'found', 'alone', 'driving', 'canyons', 'desert', 'terrain', 'Kidman', 'Neill', 'seem', 'be', 'mercy', 'open', 'sea', 'as', 'much', 'dangerous', 'behavior', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'Even', 'never', 'really', 'established', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'land', 'obvious', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'police', 'station', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'ship', 'next', 'corner.The', 'film', 'not', 'issues', 'Rae', 'able', 'communicate', 'hubby', 'John', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'thanks', 'radio', 'being', 'damaged', 'never', 'send', 'out', 'distress', 'call', 'SOS', 'end', 'film', 'Hughie', 'Zane', 'character', 'be', 'vanquished', 'couple', 'just', 'carry', 'vacation', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Nicole', 'sexy', 'one-piece', 'Sam', 'making', 'breakfast', 'washing', 'hair', 'Right', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'bee-line', 'nearest', 'port', 'harbor.The', 'film', 'short', 'dialog', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'lacking', 'Calm', 'curious', 'well-crafted', 'thriller', 'amazing', 'now', 'just', 'how', 'young', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'looked', 'sweet', 'peaches-and-cream', 'complexion', 'looking', 'even', 'younger', 'actually', 'was', 'early', '20', 'just', 'got', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'remarkably', 'well', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'bit', 'one-dimensional', 'stalwart', 'Navy', 'man', 'trying', 'help', 'wife', 'recover', 'child', 'death', 'played', 'pretty', 'well', 'was', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'only', 'American', 'cast', 'who', 'nearly', 'show', 'dangerously', 'unbalanced', 'psychopath.Those', 'blokes', 'down', 'occasionally', 'pull', 'off', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'one', 'came', 'surprise', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Kennedy', 'Miller', 'Productions', 'who', 'gave', 'first', 'two', 'Mad', 'Max', 'movies', 'George', 'Miller', 'produced', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'losing', 'long', 'time', 'partner', 'Byron', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'died', 'helicopter', 'crash', '1983']",N/A

One could theorize that the whole movie is actually a product of Kidman's mind.  One could bring up the fact that the couple has sailed out to the metaphorical calm waters to get away from the insanity of the things that have happened in their life only to have insanity come rowing a boat out to meet them and now they (specifically her) must learn to deal with that insanity.  That's getting a little deep, so I'll stick to what I know.Kidman and Neill are trying to get over the tragic loss of their child by sailing out to the middle of nowhere to get away from things.  They run across a sinking schooner which has only one survivor (Zane).  He rows out to them and climbs aboard.  Neill, out of curiosity, rows over to the sinking ship to find out what happened.  This leaves Zane and Kidman on the boat...alone.  I think what I wrote about accepting the insanity is pretty accurate as Kidman, in order to survive,  feigns a relationship with Zane when she realizes that her life is in danger.  Neill discovers what really happened on that boat and most of his story becomes trying to catch up with Zane and Kidman.Metaphors aside, this is a good movie.  The screenplay is taught.  There are no scenes where you think to yourself that this is totally unnecessary.  Everything establishes character or advances a situation.  Neill's desperate struggle to get to the boat and his resourcefulness are real highlights.The DVD doesn't really add too much, but I still recommend it for those who care about the quality of picture.

451788,APYCNRS112N2B,6305161933,Eat The Rich Books,"[7, 29]","Dead Calm is one of those movies that many have told me they liked, yet I have never really gotten into it. Maybe under one circumstance or another I've started watching it, or had an opportunity (a friend?) But just never  got far past the opening.So I finally sit down in front of it for 96  mins. I guess it tries hard to be a serious thriller, yet I can't take  anything very seriously on a sailboat in the middle of nowhere. Phillip  Noyce directed it, and, besides the two Jack Ryan movies he directed, he's  made a couple of seriously flawed films (The Saint, Sliver). Maybe this  movie takes itself a little too seriously.I far prefer a campier  version, like Kill Cruise (with Jurgen Prochnow, Jennifer Rubin, and Patsy  Kensit) There the captain is a drunk, and his two passengers are the lowest  form of party girls. When it starts to hit the fan there, you expect it.  You've waited for it. You want it. You love it.Here it's hard to imagine  why Nicole Kidman didn't just kill Billy Zane any of the 1st  50 or so  opportunities she had.

451789,A1RBHMMBLODH9R,6305161933,Fogcatcher,"[7, 7]","Wow!  Director Phillip Noyce sets you adrift with this thriller, where a relaxing voyage across the south pacific becomes a nightmarish trip of murder and madness.Couple John and Rae Ingram are recovering from the loss of their only child due to a tragic accident.  John, an experienced sailor and naval officer, takes his wife Rae on a cruise aboard their yacht to get her mind off the accident.  While alone, many hundreds of miles from shore, they discover a black schooner that appears battered and unseaworthy, looming in the distance.  A sole survivor from the disabled ship rows his way over to the Ingram's yacht at a hectic pace.  Hughie, as he identifies himself, is obviously distraught from his experience aboard the schooner.  The Ingrams graciously take the stranger in and let the exhausted man rest below.John, suspicious of Hughie, decides to explore the ghostly abandoned vessel while his guest sleeps.  Upon boarding, he discovers a shop of horrors below deck.  Meanwhile, Hughie awakens and realizes John has discovered his dirty secret.  He commandeeres the yacht with Rae as his captor, and leaves John alone with the crippled schooner.This movie has a brilliant score that resonates with spine-tingling heavy breathing and fast rythm, adding intensity and desperation to every scene it's in.  It's especially creepy when Joe discovers the corpses on the stricken vessel.  But the most hyper-ventilating scene is where Joe runs out of air in the slowly sinking ship, while stuck in a compartment below deck.  Whew!This is an amazing film, considering it has so few actors and settings.  Seasoned actor Sam Neill played convincingly as John Ingram, the caring husband and mariner.  Nicole Kidman, refreshingly young and innocent as Rae Ingram, debuted to the world her acting talent.  And as for Billy Zane, he adds flair (or is it flare?!!) to his part as the psychotic Hughie.  I think you'll really enjoy this movie.  It has all the elements of a really good thiller.",4,Dead Calm is Dead On!,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,1991,"['Wow', 'Director', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'adrift', 'thriller', 'where', 'relaxing', 'voyage', 'south', 'pacific', 'nightmarish', 'trip', 'murder', 'madness.Couple', 'John', 'Rae', 'Ingram', 'are', 'recovering', 'loss', 'only', 'child', 'due', 'tragic', 'accident', 'John', 'experienced', 'sailor', 'naval', 'officer', 'wife', 'Rae', 'cruise', 'yacht', 'get', 'mind', 'accident', 'alone', 'many', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'shore', 'discover', 'black', 'schooner', 'battered', 'unseaworthy', 'looming', 'distance', 'sole', 'survivor', 'disabled', 'ship', 'way', 'Ingram', 'yacht', 'hectic', 'pace', 'Hughie', 'obviously', 'distraught', 'experience', 'schooner', 'Ingrams', 'graciously', 'take', 'stranger', 'let', 'exhausted', 'man', 'rest', 'below.John', 'suspicious', 'Hughie', 'explore', 'ghostly', 'abandoned', 'vessel', 'guest', 'sleeps', 'boarding', 'shop', 'horrors', 'deck', 'Meanwhile', 'Hughie', 'John', 'discovered', 'dirty', 'secret', 'yacht', 'Rae', 'captor', 'John', 'alone', 'crippled', 'schooner.This', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'score', 'spine-tingling', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'fast', 'rythm', 'adding', 'intensity', 'desperation', 'scene', 'especially', 'creepy', 'when', 'Joe', 'corpses', 'stricken', 'vessel', 'most', 'hyper-ventilating', 'scene', 'where', 'Joe', 'air', 'slowly', 'sinking', 'ship', 'stuck', 'compartment', 'deck', 'Whew', 'amazing', 'film', 'considering', 'so', 'few', 'actors', 'settings', 'Seasoned', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'played', 'convincingly', 'John', 'Ingram', 'caring', 'husband', 'mariner', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'refreshingly', 'young', 'innocent', 'Rae', 'Ingram', 'debuted', 'world', 'acting', 'talent', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'flair', 'flare', 'part', 'psychotic', 'Hughie', 'think', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'elements', 'really', 'good', 'thiller']",N/A

451791,A3942G0XBGQHRW,6305161933,Greg Johnson,"[0, 0]","Dead Calm 1988Director:Phillip NoyceWritten by: Terry HayesProduced by: Dean SemlerMusic: Graeme RevellStarring: Nicole Kidman, Sam Neil, Billy ZaneThis is a 1988 version of Tony Hayes psychological thriller.  There was an earlier attempt of this film that was never completed.  All things considered it remains an intense piece of work.  The story starts in an Australia train station with John Ingram (Sam Neil) an Australian naval captain told by the police his wife has been in an accident and later at the hospital he is told his son went through the window in a head on collision along a high speed expressway.  Horrible things sometimes happen, but I disagree with following decisions to deal with John's son's death by going on an extended South sea cruise. A south sea cruise is not so easy.  Rae is understandably crushed and needs a long recovery.  She is on medication part of the time and probably knows of the damage to her dead son's face.  A woman who has been through this will be years recovering and overwhelmed with guilt.  Is sailing an 80 foot Ketch on the Pacific Ocean the solution? Anyone who has sailed the Pacific like I have knows you need to be well braced with your wits about you. You need the competence to read charts, handle gear, take watch, manage the radio, maintain a very large boat, and a hundred things to be careful about: flat ocean or rough. This includes keeping an eye for pirates!  I would lobby to leave the child's death out.  Let John and Rae start with a good life and let that provide the impact polarization for what eventually happens. Leave it out!  This particular  audience is grieving this boys death for the whole movie:. Whatever happens in this movie John and Rae will suffer on and on in this cut. Following that though I have very few complaints about this one.  Once out to sea they run into a black schooner with a man urgently rowing toward their boat.  John's seamanship aboard the beautiful well rigged Saracen is very impressive here as he hails the schooner, taking notes and positions in his log.  In fact John's seamanship is a key feature in the film and the film's out come.  After taking the panicky Warriner on board John doesn't believe a word of Hughie's story.  But John fails to use his radio to call for help. He just suspects trouble and takes a huge risk.  Instead he puts Hughie to bed and leaves Rae with him while he rows to the haunting Orpheus.  Inside panic breaks loose when he finds many bodies some decapitated in one of the companionways.  John frantically rows back to Rae but never makes it as Hughie beats Rae unconscious and motors off with Rae towards the horizon.  What follows is a real struggle for all three characters.  I think the remainder of the story is well told.  Rae shows her strength as a tough woman with superior knowledge of her boat and smarter than the winged out Hughie.  Hughie is somewhere between PTSD and psychotic. He seems completely lost and convinced he is on an ocean cruise with beautiful woman listening to blues slide guitar.John shows his cunning again by getting the old bucket Orpheus running in a plethora of rising water.  The video tape coming live with the ships engines is a good way to tell the tale of Hughie's struggles and gives a hint of how he came to lose is mind.  John gets trapped by a collapsed boom imprisoning him in the cabin of Orpheas.  This is one of the most frightening moments of Dead Calm. John appears hopelessly trapped with no chance of escape, but more good seamanship gets him out of trouble.  There is some very effective sailing near the end that reveals again Rae can be counted on in a storm. It also shows for the first time in the film the beauty of sailing. Finally the sailboat out of fuel gets put underway by Rae.  There is excellent music in this movie (Graeme Revell) with powerful drums and color atura,  which make the movie worth watching intrinsically.  Rae and John eventually take out Hughie with a flare to finish a good story.  Just one small request.  Never tie up an insane pirate sharing your boat.  Over the side!

451795,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,6305161933,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[0, 0]","I'm like a lot of people in that I first discovered Nicole Kidman when I caught this gripping Australian thriller on cable.  Though I had initially low expectations for both the film and the actress, both delivered the goods and then some.  Dead Calm is that rarity amongst thrillers -- a suspenseful, scary film that actually engages the viewer and sticks in the mind after the final credits role.The plot is admirably simple and straight forward.  Sam Niell and Nicole Kidman play a married couple mourning the death of their son (who dies in the film's first few minutes -- though you can see the development coming miles away, both the direction of Phillip Noyce and the performances of Neill and Kidman make the death into a realistic tragedy as opposed to a mere plot device).  Looking to escape their grief and save their marriage, they board their sailboat (Neill's character is a Naval officer) and take a vacation from society.  After a few days at sea, they pick up a desperate castaway (Billy Zane) who claims to be escaping from a disease-stricken pleasure cruise...This is a film that works despite of, rather than because, of its plot.  Many of the character's actions don't make much logical sense...In the hands of a lesser cast or director, these flaws would certainly have meant the death of any other film.  However, the talent here is all top notch.  Phillip Noyce manages to emphasize how isolated his characters are without making the film itself feel overly stagy; the viewer feels the story's claustrophobia without ever feeling cramped themselves.  The film's cast does a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life, despite the inconsitencies inherent in the plot.  All of them are familiar enough faces that the audience feels like they know them even as the fast-paced plot unfolds but none of them are such huge stars that they seem impervious to harm.  Sam Neill, of course, has made a career of playing well-meaning, upright men who have to prove themselves stronger than they might actually appear and he does an excellent job in this film.  Billy Zane has always had a rather irreverent attitude to his film work and while that has kept him from becoming a major star, it makes him perfect as the film's villian.  With his jittery nervousness, Zane manages to make the audience laugh without ever making his character seem to be less of a threat.  It is perhaps the ultimate compliment that a film psycho can be given in that the audience enjoys his time on screen and are just as happy once he's gone.However, the film truly belongs to Nicole Kidman.  Whether her character is being petulant and casually flirtatious or terrified and victimized or finally displaying an unexpected iron-clad will as she battles with Zane, Kidman is never less than riveting.  Her character is a difficult one and not all of her actions add up but, through Kidman's fascinating and magnetic performance, none of that matters.  After years of being overshadowed by her marriage to Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman has only recently been acknowledged as a talented actress and radiant star in her own right.  Those of us who were lucky enough to see her in Dead Calm -- years before she became Mrs. Tom Cruise -- already knew that.",4,Gripping,1017014400,"03 25, 2002",2002,3246,"[""'m"", 'lot', 'people', 'first', 'discovered', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'when', 'caught', 'gripping', 'Australian', 'thriller', 'cable', 'had', 'initially', 'low', 'expectations', 'film', 'actress', 'delivered', 'goods', 'then', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'rarity', 'amongst', 'thrillers', 'suspenseful', 'scary', 'film', 'actually', 'viewer', 'sticks', 'mind', 'final', 'credits', 'role.The', 'plot', 'admirably', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'Sam', 'Niell', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'play', 'married', 'couple', 'mourning', 'death', 'son', 'who', 'film', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'can', 'see', 'development', 'coming', 'miles', 'away', 'direction', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'performances', 'Neill', 'Kidman', 'make', 'death', 'realistic', 'tragedy', 'opposed', 'mere', 'plot', 'device', 'Looking', 'escape', 'grief', 'save', 'marriage', 'board', 'sailboat', 'Neill', 'character', 'Naval', 'officer', 'take', 'vacation', 'society', 'few', 'days', 'sea', 'pick', 'up', 'desperate', 'castaway', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'who', 'be', 'escaping', 'disease-stricken', 'pleasure', 'cruise', 'film', 'rather', 'plot', 'Many', 'character', 'actions', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'logical', 'sense', 'hands', 'lesser', 'cast', 'director', 'flaws', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'meant', 'death', 'other', 'film', 'However', 'talent', 'here', 'top', 'notch', 'Phillip', 'Noyce', 'emphasize', 'how', 'isolated', 'characters', 'are', 'making', 'film', 'feel', 'overly', 'stagy', 'viewer', 'story', 'claustrophobia', 'ever', 'feeling', 'cramped', 'film', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'inconsitencies', 'inherent', 'plot', 'are', 'familiar', 'enough', 'audience', 'feels', 'know', 'even', 'fast-paced', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'none', 'are', 'such', 'huge', 'stars', 'seem', 'impervious', 'harm', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'course', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'well-meaning', 'upright', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'prove', 'stronger', 'might', 'actually', 'appear', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'always', 'had', 'rather', 'irreverent', 'attitude', 'film', 'work', 'kept', 'becoming', 'major', 'star', 'perfect', 'film', 'villian', 'jittery', 'nervousness', 'Zane', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'ever', 'making', 'character', 'seem', 'be', 'less', 'threat', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'compliment', 'film', 'psycho', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'audience', 'time', 'screen', 'are', 'just', 'happy', 'gone.However', 'film', 'truly', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Whether', 'character', 'being', 'petulant', 'casually', 'flirtatious', 'terrified', 'victimized', 'finally', 'displaying', 'unexpected', 'iron-clad', 'will', 'Zane', 'Kidman', 'never', 'less', 'riveting', 'character', 'difficult', 'one', 'not', 'actions', 'add', 'up', 'Kidman', 'fascinating', 'magnetic', 'performance', 'none', 'matters', 'years', 'being', 'overshadowed', 'marriage', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'acknowledged', 'talented', 'actress', 'radiant', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'who', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'years', 'became', 'Mrs.', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'already', 'knew']",N/A

The couple, John and Raye (played by Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill) take a sea voyage for some together and healing time. About 1200 miles from land, a man takes a dingy to their boat, and tells them a pack of lies about the misfortune of the people on his boat nearby.  John seeing some obvious holes in the man's story, locks him in the cabin when he falls asleep, and goes to the other boat to investigate.  That's when the trouble starts... John is left behind when the nutcase wakes and escapes from the locked cabin and, in a fight with Raye, eventually drives the boat away leaving John behind.The couple, through the other hardships of their life, now must deal with this crazy lunatic... and fight for their lives miles and miles out at sea - with no help and no longer a radio to call for help!!!

If this one doesn't shock you, you better get your girlfriend to check your pulse.The story is simple:  Nicole Kidman and Sam Neill hit the ocean for some quality time together to forget the auto accident that claimed their only child.  Kidman is barely there at first--she was driving when their son was killed and suffers from overpowering sorrow and guilt.  When the couple floats up on a disabled ship with only one surviving passenger--Billy Zane--they take him aboard, unaware that they've just taken in an angel of death.  From this point on the terror mounts relentlessly as Kidman and Neill struggle to deal with Zane and the hellfire he brings with him.  Eventually separated, the husband and wife must dig deep within themselves just to stay alive.The great cast makes what could have been a routine B-movie work.  Kidman is particularly outstanding as the emotionally vampirized young wife who slowly evolves into a strong woman who can rescue her man when she needs to.  Neill, one of the industry's most underrated performers, is stalwart and professional as always.  Zane gives Anthony Perkins a run for his money as the psychotic young man who can only destroy what he doesn't understand--everything.A marvelous dish of cold chills, Dead Calm is highly recommended to anyone who loves a good, intelligent scare.",4,DELIGHTFUL BONE-CHILLER,1021075200,"05 11, 2002",2002,1451,"['When', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'promotional', 'editor', 'Try', 'Stay', 'Calm', 'believe', 'when', 'say', ""'re"", 'not', 'up', 'challenge', 'one', ""n't"", 'shock', 'better', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'check', 'pulse.The', 'story', 'simple', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'hit', 'ocean', 'quality', 'time', 'together', 'forget', 'auto', 'accident', 'claimed', 'only', 'child', 'Kidman', 'barely', 'first', 'was', 'driving', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'suffers', 'overpowering', 'sorrow', 'guilt', 'When', 'couple', 'up', 'disabled', 'ship', 'only', 'one', 'surviving', 'passenger', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'take', 'aboard', 'unaware', ""'ve"", 'just', 'taken', 'angel', 'death', 'point', 'terror', 'relentlessly', 'Kidman', 'Neill', 'struggle', 'deal', 'Zane', 'hellfire', 'Eventually', 'separated', 'husband', 'wife', 'must', 'dig', 'deep', 'just', 'stay', 'alive.The', 'great', 'cast', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'routine', 'B-movie', 'work', 'Kidman', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'emotionally', 'vampirized', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'slowly', 'strong', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'rescue', 'man', 'when', 'Neill', 'one', 'industry', 'most', 'underrated', 'performers', 'stalwart', 'professional', 'always', 'Zane', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'run', 'money', 'psychotic', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'destroy', 'what', ""n't"", 'understand', 'everything.A', 'marvelous', 'dish', 'cold', 'chills', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'intelligent', 'scare']",N/A
451804,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6305161933,Lee Armstrong,"[11, 12]","Released in 1989, this low-budget film is remarkable for several reasons. Most obviously, it was Nicole Kidman's first leading role, which she handles brilliantly. At 20, we can already see the star quality and intensity of concentration that distinguishes much of her later work. As Rae Ingram, she hits so many levels from adoring wife to loving and then grieving mother, seductress, warrior, and survivor. The special effects at the beginning of the movie where the child is flung through the windshield, while emotionally unpleasant, are well executed. As the plot mechanism which leads John &amp; Rae into the dead calm cruise, what follows with the struggle with Hughie Warriner effectively puts the grieving out of mind. Sam Neill as John Ingram does a great job of playing the loving husband, grieving father, and skilled naval officer who winds up stranded on a sinking boat and must use hits wits &amp; skill to survive. Billy Zane as Hughie seems to enjoy letting loose as the crazed killer on the high seas. Australian director Phillip Noyce would later go on to make several big-budget features with Harrison Ford, &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; &amp; &quot;Patriot Games.&quot; &quot;Dead Calm&quot; was the feature that first got Hollywood's attention for him. He does an amazingly masterful job of crafting an intense, sometimes too intense, experience on the boat that not only holds our attention but rivets us to the outcome. As I see the ads for the &quot;Survivor&quot; series on television, this film is kind of like the original &quot;survivor&quot; with Kidman being the million-dollar winner. Last but not least, the dog is a real character in the piece and one of the cutest of canines.  &quot;Dead Calm&quot; is amazing because they accomplished so much with so little.

The result is &quot;Dead Calm,&quot; an intense thriller that will leave you adrift in suspense for 90 minutes.The story, which revolves around an Australian couple taking a vacation to recover from the death of their young child in an automobile accident, might sound like the perfect movie to relax to on any evening, however it isn't. While sailing Australia's Great Barrier Reef and the South Pacific, the young couple played by Nicole Kidman (&quot;Days of Glory&quot;; &quot;Batman Forever&quot;) and Sam Neill (&quot;Renaissance Man&quot;; &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;) pick up a castaway played by Billy Zane (&quot;Titanic&quot;; &quot;Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight&quot;) who is the sole survivor of a sinking ship.After hearing his story Neill's character decides to go to the ship and check it out firsthand. That was his big mistake. Soon Zane hijacks the yacht and Kidman, leaving Neill to sink in the ship he fled. The sinister motives for Zane's departure from the ship are later discovered as the movie progresses, however it is Kidman's and Zane's chemistry and performance that make this movie one of the best suspense thrillers I have ever seen.As usual, Zane, is the ideal villain. I wouldn't be surprised if it was this film that led to Hollywood's decision to cast him as a villain in almost every film he has done since &quot;Dead Calm&quot;. He was brilliant in &quot;Titanic&quot;, and the most sinister and witty horror villain since Freddy Kruegger in &quot;Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight&quot; However, his performance as the deranged castaway in this film mixes his ability to use his intense sex appeal with his professionalism to the fullest extent.Director Philip Noyce (&quot;U2: Rattle &amp; Hum&quot;) happens to be one of Australia's most gifted actors. Along with Stephen Norrington (&quot;Blade&quot;) these gifted Australian directors give Hollywood a new reason to head &quot;Down Under&quot; when searching for top-notched directors for their films.&quot;Dead Calm&quot; represents Australia's prominence in world cinema when it comes to intelligent thrillers produced at half the costs associated with a major Hollywood Thriller nowadays.

Noyce's film is fairly straight forward and something that Hitchcock might have tackled (in fact he kind of did with ""Life Boat"" but within a very different context).SPOILERS:  John and Rae Ingram (Sam Neill and Nicole Kidman)are enjoying the quiet peacefulness of the ocean when they come across Hughie (Billy Zane)in a dingy. It seems he's a survivor from a damaged schooner. The couple rescue Hughie and John goes over to investigate the schooner realizing that Hughie isn't telling the truth about what happened. He makes off with John's boat with Rae still on board. It's up to John to figure out a way to pursue his ship so he can save his wife. END OF SPOILERS:A well made Austrailan thriller looks quite good in its Blu-ray debut. My only complaint is that the original ending isn't included as an extra here (the ending was reshot to clarify the fate of a character) and there aren't any special features such as a commentary track from director Noyce. We do get the original theatrical trailer but the film certainly deserves better than this bare bones presentation on Blu-ray. Audio sounds quite nice with a nice surround mix that put you in the middle of the action.Although ""Dead Calm"" sails onto Blu-ray without any special features the transfer keeps the film on an even keel and makes up for the lack of a strong wind in the form of special features giving us more background on the making of the film. At this price, I'd recommend the film even without the extras it deserves.",4,Exceptional suspense thriller receives nice looking BD transfer lacking extras though,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,1681,"['Phillip', 'Noyce', 'Patriot', 'Games', 'Quiet', 'American', 'Rabbit', 'Proof', 'Fence', 'Clear', 'Present', 'Danger', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'gripping', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'decade', 'release', 'Noyce', 'film', 'fairly', 'straight', 'forward', 'something', 'Hitchcock', 'might', 'have', 'tackled', 'fact', 'kind', 'did', 'Life', 'Boat', 'very', 'different', 'context', '.SPOILERS', 'John', 'Rae', 'Ingram', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'are', 'enjoying', 'quiet', 'peacefulness', 'ocean', 'when', 'come', 'Hughie', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'dingy', 'survivor', 'damaged', 'schooner', 'couple', 'rescue', 'Hughie', 'John', 'investigate', 'schooner', 'realizing', 'Hughie', ""n't"", 'telling', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'off', 'John', 'boat', 'Rae', 'still', 'board', 'up', 'John', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'pursue', 'ship', 'can', 'save', 'wife', 'END', 'SPOILERS', 'well', 'made', 'Austrailan', 'thriller', 'quite', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'debut', 'only', 'complaint', 'original', 'ending', ""n't"", 'included', 'extra', 'here', 'ending', 'was', 'reshot', 'clarify', 'fate', 'character', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'features', 'such', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Noyce', 'do', 'get', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'bare', 'bones', 'presentation', 'Blu-ray', 'Audio', 'quite', 'nice', 'nice', 'surround', 'mix', 'put', 'middle', 'action.Although', 'Dead', 'Calm', 'Blu-ray', 'special', 'features', 'transfer', 'film', 'even', 'keel', 'up', 'lack', 'strong', 'wind', 'form', 'special', 'features', 'giving', 'more', 'background', 'making', 'film', 'price', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'even', 'extras']",N/A
