The assortment of talented character actors along with Paul & Jamie just make this sitcom hilarious.  I have watched many a re-run over the years and am glad they finally released the 3rd season and can only hope they continue on.If you've never watched the show, find some re-runs on TV before committing to the DVDs or rent some.  I find the show appealing because it is about two obsessive compsulsive people and their adventures in life - from dealing with their neighbors to their crazy friends and family.  The sitcom did suffer some low points along the way, as most long-running shows do.  Still, I think you'll like it if you give it a try.",5,I forgot how much I love this show,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",2007,831,"['show', 'can', 'be', 'quirky', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', 'drawn', 'sitcom', 'as', 'much', 'am', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'assortment', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Jamie', 'just', 'make', 'sitcom', 'hilarious', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 're-run', 'years', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'released', '3rd', 'season', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'continue', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'find', 're-runs', 'TV', 'committing', 'DVDs', 'rent', 'find', 'show', 'appealing', 'two', 'obsessive', 'compsulsive', 'people', 'adventures', 'life', 'dealing', 'neighbors', 'crazy', 'friends', 'family', 'sitcom', 'did', 'suffer', 'low', 'points', 'way', 'most', 'long-running', 'shows', 'do', 'Still', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'give', 'try']",N/A

1036628,A3QEPSZ62L6BU5,B000KX0IPO,Julius Weber,"[0, 0]",All very old now but one of the better sitcoms of its era starring Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt (although I often wondered about her total suitability). It was written to show the complexity of the dynamics within a young married couple in New York. One sees a lot of the basic ideas in Frasier and Seinfeld but perhaps Mad About You seems very slow. Part of the problem is that they are too few main characters (although too many secondary characters) which reduces the number of intra-main-characters story lines. Also the set was drab and lacked compartmentalization. I think that Helen Hunt failed to rise to the character created by Paul Reiser and Danny Jacobson and perhaps this was not her natural stage.

But at least we now have the third season, which is one of the show's best.  My partner and I used to watch this series early on in our relationship, and we kind of identified with the two lead characters, Paul and Jamie Buchman, who are coping with married life.  Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt are perfect in their roles, and they work so well together.  Their comic timing along with that of their delightful co-stars Leila Kenzle, John Pankow and especially the wonderful Anne Ramsay as Jamie's wacky sister, Lisa, is what makes ""Mad About You"" such a great sitcom.  This show makes me laugh out loud.  I think almost every episode during its third season is a winner, but a few of my favorites are: ""The Ride Home"" (Paul and Jamie go to a party and meet guest stars Eric Stoltz--who plays her old boyfriend--and Wendie Malick), ""Giblets for Murray"" (a hysterical Thanksgiving episode), ""Purseona"" (Jamie and Lisa switch purses accidentally), ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" (the Buchmans go on vacation) and ""Cake Fear"" (Paul celebrates his birthday).
