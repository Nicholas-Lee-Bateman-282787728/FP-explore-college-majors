498370,A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,B00000F4IE,Chris Fung,"[10, 11]","I didn't go to this movie expecting that much, but I got a very nice surprise. George Hickenlooper's movie has some marvellously deft touchs which are only occasionally marred by heavy-handed directing.This movie is about sex and creativity and commerce. It's also about dealing with failure and while younger people may not feel like this is a particularly useful thing to comtemplate, most of us on the other side of J. Lo will recognize something of Byron Tiller, here played extremely well by Andy Garcia, in our own pasts (and one hopes, inshallah not our presents).Byron is a writer whose initial critical success is met with stunning commercial failure. There follows a long slow spiral into a creative desert where, shut out by the business-people who actually run the show, Byron is tempted (like St. Anthony in the Hieronymous Bosch painting) by a saturnine and suitably time-worn procureur, Luther Fox (played to a T by Mick Jagger). Fox offers Byron a way to make some money, and more importantly get closer to the creative action by providing intimate services to Andrea (Olivia Williams), the wife of a famous and eminently well-published novelist Tobias Alcott (James Coburn).Left to pick up after the emotional trainwreck is Byron's wife (Julianne Margulies) and Byron himself. The most effective parts of the movie are those which deal with the destructiveness of pride (or its second cousin, desire for success), the seductiveness of art and the way in which many many of us labor under the fear that we are not nearly as good as others think we are and that failure is just around the corner.Certainly this movie is a riff on Faust but one where willfull blindness plays an overwhelming role. And here one is confronted with what seems initially to be the biggest logical holes in the script: How can Jagger's louchly polished Fox still have illusions of emotional intimacy with his long-time trick, Jennifer (easily and finely played by Anjelica Huston)? How can an experienced writer like Byron NOT insist on a contract with Alcott when the two (in one of the movie's more predictable but nicely performed turns) decide to co-author Alcott's final novel?Still, the fact that in real life, otherwise intelligent people get conned all the time suggests that reality is much closer to the world that Hickenlooper brings to life so deftly than most of us would like to think. In fact, con men (like advertisers) know that the way to pull off a con is to promise the mark something that he or she already desires (the illusion of being inside the loop, the illusion of illicit gain, the illusion of imminent success) and Hickenlooper -and Olivia Williams' deliciously Macchiavellian Andrea know this too.We're left to wonder at the self-deludedness of both Fox and Byron both of whose faces crumble heart-breakingly as they realize the scams that they have led themselves into. I'm reminded here of the work of a couple of colleagues of mine who have worked with female sex workers and their male clients. What my colleagues report is that the men almost invariably cast their relationships with the prostitutes in other than economic terms, -for the men, it's about lust or virility or even companionship, or emotional attachment- while the women have no such illusions.Some of the best dramatic work in this movie comes from the interactions (always short, interestingly) between Garcia and Margulies and between Garcia and Jagger. The cameos with Huston and Jagger were gems also but lacked (as indeed they perhaps should have done) the intensity of the other interactions. Jagger in particular deserves a great deal of praise for his performance here, it is a delight to watch, and his role as interlocuter via voice over is handled well too. One gets the feeling that this a very good British movie in some ways which is certainly a point in its favor.Indeed, this movie would have been one of the most thought-provoking movies of the year for me if the ideas behind the movie had not been overwhelmed in places by hysterica; action: Byron ransacking the escorts' dressing room was one of these (does the red-blooded American male have to attack the furniture in order to show frustration or rage?), as was the contrived chance encounter between Byron and his wife in the hotel.Nevertheless, we can forgive Hickenlooper's hinting at a hopeful ending to Byron's story, even as it recycles the strange Protestant idea that suffering will lead a person of genius to creativity and thus redemption. Movies that have the courage to even creep close to the abyss of fear and failure that we older folk know is out there, deserve a certain amount of forgiveness for their sins and appreciation of their good points -at least in my book.",4,"Sirens of success, ghosts of failure",1039651200,"12 12, 2002",2002,4750,"['did', ""n't"", 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'much', 'got', 'very', 'nice', 'surprise',

498371,A11PTCZ2FM2547,B00000F4IE,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[5, 5]","Well, let's see.  When his first novel (entitled ""Hitler's Child"") fails to generate sales and his publisher refuses to print his second book, what is a starving writer to do?Work for a male escort service, of course!As goofy as this premise is, THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS actually delivers a compelling story that is both fun and painful to watch.  Unable to get his old job back and desperately strapped for cash, hard luck novelist Byron Tiller (Andy Garcia) is lured by the seductive enticement of ""easy money"" as an escort for Elysian Fields, a playground for rich, neglected housewives.  Problem is, there's nothing ""easy"" about Byron's new career, and this character learns lesson after lesson--about himself, about the importance of his marriage--via a very unforgiving school of hard knocks.The tragic irony of this film manifests itself over and over.  By trying to provide for and protect his family, Byron's poor decision to join Elysian only serves to destroy it.  And naturally--irony of ironies--Byron's best client is the exotic, beautiful Andrea Alcott (Olivia Williams), who just happens to be married to Pulitzer-prize winning novelist Tobias Alcott (played wonderfully by James Coburn).  The ailing Tobias seeks Byron's aid to rewrite his last novel; the young writer eagerly agrees; the stage is set for dismal, heartbreaking disappointment (should have insisted on a written contract, dude).Garcia is so soft-spoken and restrained in this role, even after getting knocked down again and again, that I--unlike some of the reviewers here--actually was relieved when he finally unleashed some anger and frustration by trashing the wardrobe room at Elysian Fields.  I'll bet the character felt better; I know I did.Mick Jagger as the articulate, whiskey-sipping proprietor of Elysian Fields was an unexpected and delightful surprise.  The ending was a bit uneven and sappy, but entirely predictable.  For all you struggling writers out there, I would recommend you forego becoming an escort and pick something safer.

498372,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00000F4IE,Grady Harp,"[7, 9]","THE MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS is ostensibly a story about male escort services, the type of escorts needed by older ladies who require bright, worldly, attractive men.  But if you're expecting an expose on the life of male escorts pass this one by.  This film is a well made tale about what men and women will do to find money/success/love - all wrapped into a tidy little package about a writer on the skids who needs to support his beloved family and just happens to meet a resource in an escort service.  An incidental plus is that the writer is assigned to a women who is married to a dying famous writer, a man who is completely informed about his wife's needs and turns those needs into a benefit for him (finishing his last novel).  In the hands of less than superb actors this could become a TV novella, but given the cast of Andy Garcia (wirter), Julianna Margulies (his wife), Mick Jagger ( the 'pimp'), Anjelica Huston (jagger's client),and Olivia Williams (the 'other woman') and James Coburn (the dying writer) the whole film works well.

I personally had no idea he could act, and as soon as I realized he had a key role in what was promised to be a serious drama, I was disheartened.  But I was very, very pleasantly surprised.

I frankly, had never even heard of it, and just happened to stumble across the DVD in the Public Library.The film had enough potential that its lapses into folly and caricature were nearly unforgiveable.  Earlier in the film, Julianna Margulies' character demonstrated a cloying interpretation of unconditional love that was more suited to a giggling adolescent than a mature adult.  Margulies's acting displays sufficient range and intelligence in the film that it was clear (to me, anyway) that the fault for this early characterization lay more in the writing and direction than in any lack of skill on the part of the actor.  Her character's father was portrayed as the cliched one-dimensional ""I told my daughter you'd never amount to anything!"" jerk.There are a number of early scenes (particularly those used to set up the desperation of Garcia's character) that are so exaggerated or implausible that they do a real disservice to the film.

498376,A3H7HJ8O42U70Z,B00000F4IE,"""johntchance""","[3, 3]","This independent film starring Andy Garcia looked promising and it is enjoyable to sit through, but the movie is an elephant balanced on one leg. Somehow Garcia is this failed L.A. novelist that use to work in the Ad game. Now he's married with baby and no income is coming his way. His current novel is unpublishable. the wife's father is rich, but hates him. He told his former boss in the Ad agency off, and can't get that job back. So what is a hero to do? Go to work as a male escort for pimp, Mick Jagger. Now the film is full of good actors and pleasant faces. That babe Olivia Williams of RUSHMORE fame shows up as the lady who wants Garcia as an escort, and her dying husband is played by the great James Colburn.The whole thing is played 100% serious, but probably worked better as that Rob Schneider gigolo film comedy I never saw. Why? Because it's ridiculous to think that Garcia can't get another ad job in a city as big as Los Angeles, even if he did anger the old boss. Garcia is so pained by having to be a prostitute, I am reminded of the seriousness that Costner tried to portray in the campy POSTMAN.Now if that wasn't bad enough, James Colburn isn't just the husband of Garcia's client, but a famous writer of the day.

498377,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00000F4IE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","At the beginning of ""The Man from Elysian Fields,"" Byron Tiller (Andy Garcia) thinks he has reached the low point of his life.  Having spent seven years writing a novel entitled ""Hitler's Child"" he finds his book has been marked down to $3.99 and can be found in the remainder bin.  He gets to tell his wife, Dena (Julianna Margulies) that he has sold a book and garnered another few pennies of royalties, but we know that did not happen.  Tiller has labored over his second book, about migrant workers, only to be told no one wants to read books about microcosms or with too much of that symbolism junk.  But even this bad news is not the low point for Byron.  That comes when he is approached by Luther Fox (Mick Jagger), who offers him employment at Elysian Fields, a male escort service.  There are rich women who would pay to be escorted by someone with both looks and brains, and with no other prospects, Byron agrees to give it a try, giving credence to Fox's belief that, ""A man can always support his family if he's willing to do what's necessary.""The fact that Byron is a writer struggling to be a success is a major part of this story, but we get a bit distracted by the fact that screenwriter Phillip Jayson Lasker (who wrote episodes of ""Barney Miller"" and ""The Golden Girls""), is doing a twist on the familiar idea of someone turning to prostitution to survive.  Such stories are almost always about young women out on their own, they are not about married men with a child at home (as ""American Gigolo"" amply proved).  Byron is assigned to escort Andrea Alcott (Olivia Williams), the wife of the famous writer Tobias Alcott (James Coburn), who is terminally ill.  Byron once took a class on Alcott's Pulitzer Prize winning writings and even bones up on his works to be prepared to charm his wife.  Of course, Mrs. Alcott wants to be more than merely charmed, and if Byron is not surprised that he can go through with it, then he is surprised that Alcott walks in on the scene and does not seem bothered by another man being in his wife's bed.What is going to happen is probably obvious to us, but Byron starting descending through the various levels of his personal hell with the best of intentions.  But while he lies with Alcott's wife he tells lies to his own, and it is just a question of which is the bigger mistake.  What makes it all worthwhile is not the paycheck that he gets from Elysian Fields, but the rapport he establishes with Alcott and the offer that would be the answer to all of Bryon's prayers.  There are some definite homages here to ""Sunset Blvd.,"" but ""The Man from Elysian Fields"" is about a different type of suicide.  My main problem with the script is that when Byron finds out finds out exactly how he has been victimized there is a way out of it (specifically a way of proving that which cannot be proven).  But director George Hickenlooper's film will find what relative redemption it can offer in a different way.There are a couple of minor characters in this 2002 film that bring the storyline into sharp relief.  Anjelica Huston plays Jennifer Adler, the one client that Fox still sees, and who provides him with a moment of brutal clarity that convinces him it is time for him to get out of this business.  The other is Michael Des Barres as Nigel Halsey, the experience gigolo at Elysian Fields who teaches Bryon the ropes and who is forced to have his own moment of honest reflection when a question is asked by a most surprising client.  What the two characters have in common is that while others may be visiting for a short while or a long time in this world, they will never be leaving.  In our brief visit to these world we meet some interesting characters acting out a modern morality play.",4,"More than ""American Gigolo"" meets ""Sunset Blvd.""",1101168000,"11 23, 2004",2004,3748,"['beginning', 'Man', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'Byron', 'Tiller', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'reached', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'Having', 'spent', 'seven', 'years', 'writing', 'novel', 'entitled', 'Hitler', 'Child', 'book', 'been', 'marked', '3.99', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'remainder', 'bin', 'tell', 'wife', 'Dena', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'sold', 'book', 'garnered', 'few', 'pennies', 'royalties', 'know', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Tiller', 'labored', 'second', 'book', 'migrant', 'workers', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'one', 'read', 'books', 'microcosms', 'too', 'much', 'symbolism', 'junk', 'even', 'bad', 'news', 'not', 'low', 'point', 'Byron', 'when', 'approached', 'Luther', 'Fox', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'who', 'employment', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'male', 'escort', 'service', 'are', 'rich', 'women', 'who', 'would', 'pay', 'be', 'escorted', 'someone', 'looks', 'brains', 'other', 'prospects', 'Byron', 'give', 'try', 'giving', 'credence', 'Fox', 'belief', 'man', 'can', 'always', 'support', 'family', 'willing', 'do', 'what', 'necessary', 'fact', 'Byron', 'writer', 'struggling', 'be', 'success', 'major', 'part', 'story', 'get', 'bit', 'distracted', 'fact', 'screenwriter', 'Phillip', 'Jayson', 'Lasker', 'who', 'wrote', 'episodes', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Golden', 'Girls', 'doing', 'twist', 'familiar', 'idea', 'someone', 'turning', 'prostitution', 'survive', 'Such', 'stories', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'young', 'women', 'out', 'own', 'are', 'not', 'married', 'men', 'child', 'home', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'amply', 'proved', 'Byron', 'assigned', 'escort', 'Andrea', 'Alcott', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'wife', 'famous', 'writer', 'Tobias', 'Alcott', 'James', 'Coburn', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill.', 'Byron', 'once', 'took', 'class', 'Alcott', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'writings', 'even', 'bones', 'up', 'works', 'be', 'prepared', 'charm', 'wife', 'course', 'Mrs.', 'Alcott', 'be', 'more', 'merely', 'charmed', 'Byron', 'not', 'surprised', 'can', 'go', 'then', 'surprised', 'Alcott', 'walks', 'scene', 'not', 'seem', 'bothered', 'man', 'being', 'wife', 'bed.What', 'going', 'happen', 'probably', 'obvious', 'Byron', 'starting', 'descending', 'various', 'levels', 'personal', 'hell', 'best', 'intentions', 'Alcott', 'wife', 'own', 'just', 'question', 'bigger', 'mistake', 'What', 'worthwhile', 'not', 'paycheck', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'rapport', 'Alcott', 'offer', 'would', 'be', 'answer', 'Bryon', 'prayers', 'are', 'definite', 'homages', 'here', 'Sunset', 'Blvd.', 'Man', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'different', 'type', 'suicide', 'main', 'problem', 'script', 'when', 'Byron', 'out', 'out', 'exactly', 'how', 'been', 'victimized', 'way', 'specifically', 'way', 'proving', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'proven', 'director', 'George', 'Hickenlooper', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'what', 'relative', 'redemption', 'can', 'offer', 'different', 'are', 'couple', 'minor', 'characters', '2002', 'film', 'bring', 'storyline', 'sharp', 'relief', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Jennifer', 'Adler', 'one', 'client', 'Fox', 'still', 'who', 'moment', 'brutal', 'clarity', 'time', 'get', 'business', 'other', 'Michael', 'Des', 'Barres', 'Nigel', 'Halsey', 'experience', 'gigolo', 'Elysian', 'Fields', 'who', 'teaches', 'Bryon', 'ropes', 'who', 'forced', 'have', 'own', 'moment', 'honest', 'reflection', 'when', 'question', 'asked', 'most', 'surprising', 'client', 'What', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'common', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'visiting', 'short', 'while', 'long', 'time', 'world', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'leaving', 'brief', 'visit', 'world', 'meet', 'interesting', 'characters', 'acting', 'out', 'modern', 'morality', 'play']",The Man from Elysian Fields VHS
498378,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00000F4IE,Lawyeraau,"[2, 2]","This is a finely cast film with some terrific performances by the late James Coburn, Angelica Huston, and Mick Jagger. Not even they, however, can save this film from going belly up. The plot is improbable, and the main character, played by Andy Garcia, is unbelievable.The plot is simple. Good-looking, former ad agency hotshot turned writer, appropriately named Byron (Andy Garcia), has written and published his first book that, despite warm reviews, has ended up as a remainder. His second book has been rejected by his publisher. His supportive, stay at home wife, Dena (Juliana Margulies), and young child need him to bring home the bacon, so what is an aspiring young writer to do? Why he turns to a male escort service that just happens to have an office in the same building in which Byron has an office that he uses for his writing. Right away you know that the film is in trouble, as one would think that a financially strapped writer would give up the luxury of an office rental.This escort service is deliciously run by Luthor Fox, which Faustian role is played with silken, Machiavellian overtones by Mick Jagger due to a bit of inspired casting. Luthor himself still dabbles in the field by servicing Jennifer, one of his original clients, played with sophisticated finesse by Angelica Huston. Byron is initially reluctant to do this sort of work, because he does love his wife, and because he seems to have some moral scruples.Fortuitously for him, Byron's first assignment is to escort a coldly beautiful, young woman named Andrea, played with icy hauteur by the lovely Olivia Williams. Andrea just happens to be married to aging Pulitzer Prize winning novelist, Tobias Alcott (James Coburn). Before Byron knows it, his moral scruples are blowing in the wind. It turns out that this assignment has him servicing both the Alcotts in ways he could never have imagined. Of course, his pact with the Alcotts has its short lived financial rewards, but its long term impact on his marriage, his writing career, and his psyche is another matter.There are some juicy and memorable moments in the film. Tobias Alcott has a knack for entering his wife's room to chat, at just precisely the wrong moment. When Luthor decides to take his business arrangement with Jennifer to a new level, he gets an ego shattering surprise that has some cinematic interest. There are also some less than memorable moments in the film. The scene at the end, when Byron realizes just where his pact with the Alcotts has led him, causing him to indulge in an act of purely gratuitous vandalism, is a bit of ham handed, laughable overkill.The plot holes also do not help this film. Byron's paying for an office in which to write, when he does not have two sticks to rub together, is ridiculous. Byron's seeming disinclination to get a ""respectable"" job does not really justify his resorting to getting a job with the escort service. His verbal pact with the crusty Tobias, regarding a collaborative writing effort, does not seem to be a sound basis for Byron getting a new house in a more upscale neighborhood and doing scads of shopping with Dena. Moreover, Byron's seeming naivete does not jive with his being a former ad agency hotshot. In short, Byron comes across as a bit of a dolt and, ultimately, unsympathetic. The character of Dena does not fare much better, as Ms. Margulies is too one dimensional as the sweetly trusting wife.This film is moderately enjoyable, at best, and only so due to the stellar performances of Mick Jagger, James Coburn, and Angelica Huston. Andy Garcia and Juliana Margulies are eminently forgettable in their respective roles, while Olivia Williams manages to hold her own in an undeveloped role. The allegorical pretensions of the film are merely just that, as the film careens midway and degenerates into pure hogwash.",3,BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR...,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,3842,"['finely', 'cast', 'film', 'terrific', 'performances', 'late', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'Not', 'even', 'however', 'can', 'save', 'film', 'going', 'belly', 'up', 'plot', 'improbable', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'unbelievable.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Good-looking', 'former', 'ad', 'agency', 'hotshot', 'turned', 'writer', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Byron', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'written', 'published', 'first', 'book', 'warm', 'reviews', 'ended', 'up', 'remainder', 'second', 'book', 'been', 'rejected', 'publisher', 'supportive', 'stay', 'home', 'wife', 'Dena', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'young', 'child', 'need', 'bring', 'home', 'bacon', 'what', 'aspiring', 'young', 'writer', 'do', 'Why', 'male', 'escort', 'service', 'just', 'have', 'office', 'same', 'building', 'Byron', 'office', 'writing', 'Right', 'away', 'know', 'film', 'trouble', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'financially', 'strapped', 'writer', 'would', 'give', 'up', 'luxury', 'office', 'rental.This', 'escort', 'service', 'deliciously', 'run', 'Luthor', 'Fox', 'Faustian', 'role', 'played', 'silken', 'Machiavellian', 'overtones', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'due', 'bit', 'inspired', 'casting', 'Luthor', 'still', 'field', 'servicing', 'Jennifer', 'one', 'original', 'clients', 'played', 'sophisticated', 'finesse', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Byron', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'do', 'sort', 'work', 'love', 'wife', 'have', 'moral', 'scruples.Fortuitously', 'Byron', 'first', 'assignment', 'escort', 'coldly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Andrea', 'played', 'icy', 'hauteur', 'lovely', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Andrea', 'just', 'be', 'married', 'aging', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novelist', 'Tobias', 'Alcott', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Byron', 'moral', 'scruples', 'are', 'blowing', 'wind', 'out', 'assignment', 'servicing', 'Alcotts', 'ways', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'imagined', 'course', 'pact', 'Alcotts', 'short', 'lived', 'financial', 'rewards', 'long', 'term', 'impact', 'marriage', 'writing', 'career', 'psyche', 'are', 'juicy', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film', 'Tobias', 'Alcott', 'knack', 'entering', 'wife', 'room', 'chat', 'just', 'precisely', 'wrong', 'moment', 'When', 'Luthor', 'take', 'business', 'arrangement', 'Jennifer', 'new', 'level', 'ego', 'shattering', 'surprise', 'cinematic', 'interest', 'are', 'also', 'less', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Byron', 'just', 'where', 'pact', 'Alcotts', 'led', 'causing', 'indulge', 'act', 'purely', 'gratuitous', 'vandalism', 'bit', 'ham', 'handed', 'laughable', 'overkill.The', 'plot', 'holes', 'also', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'film', 'Byron', 'paying', 'office', 'write', 'when', 'not', 'have', 'two', 'sticks', 'rub', 'together', 'ridiculous', 'Byron', 'seeming', 'disinclination', 'get', 'respectable', 'job', 'not', 'really', 'justify', 'resorting', 'getting', 'job', 'escort', 'service', 'verbal', 'pact', 'crusty', 'Tobias', 'regarding', 'collaborative', 'writing', 'effort', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'sound', 'basis', 'Byron', 'getting', 'new', 'house', 'more', 'upscale', 'neighborhood', 'doing', 'scads', 'shopping', 'Dena', 'Moreover', 'Byron', 'seeming', 'naivete', 'not', 'jive', 'being', 'former', 'ad', 'agency', 'hotshot', 'short', 'Byron', 'across', 'bit', 'dolt', 'ultimately', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'Dena', 'not', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'Ms.', 'Margulies', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'sweetly', 'trusting', 'wife.This', 'film', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'best', 'only', 'so', 'due', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Mick', 'Jagger', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Andy', 'Garcia', 'Juliana', 'Margulies', 'are', 'eminently', 'forgettable', 'respective', 'roles', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'hold', 'own', 'undeveloped', 'role', 'allegorical', 'pretensions', 'film', 'are', 'merely', 'just', 'that', 'film', 'midway', 'pure', 'hogwash']",The Man from Elysian Fields VHS
498379,AD2BIAIH78QI5,B00000F4IE,"Linda McDonnell ""TutorGal""","[4, 4]","Yes, the only reason I went to see ""The Man from Elysian Fields"" is because I HAD to see what a Mick Jagger movie would be like. I know he made a movie many years ago called ""Fitzcarraldo"" and I believe his notices were good for that, but never having seen that opus, I said, ""Alright, TutorGal, let's go to it!""This is a somewhat surprising movie because it does feature many strong performances, Mick's among them. He owns an escort service called Elysian Fields and one day manages to entice down-on-his-luck writer Andy Garcia to sign on. Garcia's the actual star of the movie, but I've got to admit my interests lay with Mick and with another supporting player, James Coburn. Garcia finds himself having to ""service"" the years-younger wife of Coburn. He's an old Hemingway-esque writer, who's working on one last book and permits the young wife to amuse herself since he's too sick to do much of that kind of thing anymore. Garcia connects with him on a writing level, so here we have a rather uneasy almost menage a trois situation. A further complication is that Garcia is a married man, and his wife is starting to ask a lot of questions rather angrily.The film is an interesting turn on the usual ""woman who has to turn tricks to support her REAL lifestyle"" type of story, if such a type can be said to be usual. Garcia does a good job of portraying the degradation he feels in this emasculating experience of being considered only for his body and his sexuality. And poor Mick, bless him, has a role somewhat like Belle Watling in ""Gone with the Wind"", the male madam who's in unrequited love with his best customer, wealthy Anjelica Huston. He's just such a weird persona in real life, Mick, that the whole experience of watching him act as this urbane kept man is fascinating.Why three stars and not more? Well, notwithstanding The Mick and even the feisty job by Coburn, it IS a seedy sort of film and made me feel bad. I think it's a type of women's power fantasy against men. You can watch it and see what you make of it.

498381,A1PICWXVZHP61T,B00000F4IE,"Maeve of Tara ""Avid Reader""","[3, 3]","To begin with, Mick Jagger, James Coburn (especially James Coburn), and Andy Garcia turn in solid performances. The mood and  cinematography are befittingly noir, the ironic nuances clever, the opening scenes reasonably realistic, the middle ... most of it needs that you suspend belief, and the ending, after a brief foray into reality, is unacceptably schmaltzy.That said, I do recommend this film. After all, we know that truth can be stranger than fiction, and you deal with the contradictions here by labeling them as ""allegorical."" Besides, this IS a cautionary tale, not only for authors and artists, but for everyone. Firstly, accept that in the Arts, it's not the best man who wins but the luckier one, and second, never take anyone's promise just by his/her word, but oh! do secure that CONTRACT SIGNED AND SEALED in front of witnesses and notary. Byron the down-on-his-luck author gets royally screwed by the person for whom he is paid to do that to her in bed. Spoiler? No. Because  just this part alone (how Byron gets cheated by the beautiful, icy, Andrea) makes it worth watching to absorb the lesson.I bought MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS because of the reviews I read here --- and... now comes the big confession: because I too am an author. Got five published novels, even readers in far off New Zealand and Turkey, as feathers on my cap, and am of course broke a la Byron the Author; so how could I ever not purchase this film?As I've said earlier, MAN FROM ELYSIAN FIELDS opens realistically enough. Byron has published a novel which, though well received by critics, has ended up in the bargain bin due to lackluster sales, there is no immediate hope for a second book contract, and financially he is in deep you-know-what. Now the plot loses credibility because Byron is presented as so desperate for money that he accepts work as a ""well-paid escort to women, in and out of bed."" Byron is married, loves his wife, and doesn't want to cheat on her; Garcia plays this part convincingly. It is the director and the writers who don't give us, the viewers, enough reason to believe that he is doing this out of desperation. True, many authors (as pointed out by another reviewer further down the line here) work as waiters, tele-marketers (ah, but many telemarketing jobs are getting outsourced to other countries), or ad agency copy-writers. In fact, Byron too has worked in an ad agency and lost his job because of a dispute with his boss. Still, there are other jobs out there, and the writers do not show him as trying long and hard enough to find something more suited than working for the escort service.What I found believable, however, is that Byron did co-write a book with the famous author Tobias Alcott (played by James Coburn) whom he'd admired from afar until the day serendipity placed them in each other's orbit, without the benefit of a contract. The character of Pulitzer winner Tobias Alcott is quite well-drawn, he is the true hero of this movie, an honorable, sophisticated man who loves his wife more than his own male ego, who looks death in the eye with such a natural grace that he not only commands your respect, but of course, your trust... and I'm afraid that I, too, would have trusted him and written that book with him without the contract....So, over all, this is a good film, and Mick Jagger's acting is better than good, a suitable match to James Coburn's stellar delivery. When you're finished viewing this film, you'll be wondering: Did Byron have no recourse, could he not have contested Tobias' sole authorship of this book?

The movie is clearly part fantasy and allegory, with the director and editor playing with reality to advance their theses---which they do admirably. One wonders about what else in their lives such critics are unimaginative. But I digress...casting and performances are excellent. A wondrous Mick Jagger, who someone else here described well as ""...a satanic purring Siamese cat, is perfectly cast as the owner of a high-end male escort service. ""Decadent"" is the most perfect description of his character and persona. The rest of the cast is suitably lovely, the women all ""troppo mangiabile"" and James Coburn and Andy Garcia both virile in their own ways, appropriate to the plot. Nicely shot, great music, very atmospheric. And, the ultimate lesson of the story is one which I have learned, personally, to both my regret and happiness: unconditional love from a special someone is a gift that you squander at your life-long peril.

In George Hickenlooper's film, ""The Man from Elysian Fields"" (Mick Jagger as Luther Fox) is  an escort service owner who promises and I would assume delivers rich women to a place as blissful and full of happiness as said Elysian Fields.Enter Byron Tiller (Andy Garcia) struggling writer, at the end of his rope financially and with a wife (Juliana Maguiles) and a child to support. Luther offers Byron the chance to make great money by escorting rich women. One of the women Byron escorts is Andrea Alcott (Olivia Williams) wife of a very famous and prolific author, Tobias Alcott. Tobias (James Coburn), in his 70's and very ill asks Byron to help him co-author a novel and Byron jumps at, what he feels will be, the chance of a professional lifetime. The only catch is Byron must continue to ""date"" Andrea and thus sets the scene for Byron's downfall both professional and personal.Byron Tiller, as played by Andy Garcia, is a tormented, fragmented yet proud man: he does not like what he has to do in order to care for his family yet he feels he has no other opportunities available to him. Garcia plays Tiller with the same intensity and vulnerability that he exhibited in ""When a Man Loves a Woman."" In a way, he grows to love Andrea but knows it is wrong for he truly loves his wife. He flings himself headfirst into the co-authoring project yet he knows it takes him away from his wife and child who need more than just the money he gives them to live on. His ego supplants his common sense and he ultimately has to pay the consequences. Garcia does a masterful job making Byron's personal and professional conflicts real and understandable.Olivia Williams, so good in ""The Sixth Sense"" plays Andrea Tobias very quietly with all her feelings and emotions intact. She is fascinating to watch. Watch her eyes and body language in the final scene with Byron. It's classic movie acting. Juliana Marguiles, James Coburn and Mick Jagger do excellent work also.In many ways, ""The Man from Elysian Fields"" is like the very old Faust legend: the man who sells his soul to the devil for riches and success.
