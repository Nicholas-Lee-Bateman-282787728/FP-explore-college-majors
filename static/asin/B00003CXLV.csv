Shane Falco, a former football star who had the makings of a great future (thrown away with an embarrassing championship game) is given the chance at stardom once again when he is approached to join the team.  Assembling a hodgepodge of ridiculous `athletes', the team's coach, Jimmy McGinty, sets out to make history happen, or just have some fun.The film is completely predictable and absolutely nothing new, but it is a load of laughs and a ton of fun.The cast is inspired and effective.  Keanu Reeves is one of the most talentLESS actors on the planet, but he is pretty good here (dare I say BEST TURN?).  I can't complain about him at all really, which is a shocker.

528713,ALJUWINH5ZW7S,B00003CXLV,Avery,"[0, 3]","Let's get the only two eliments that I liked about the movie out of the way first.  1) The cast: With Keanu Reeves, John Favreau, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans and Gene Hackman.  2)The soundtrack: lots of great sport theme songs you would here at a real football or baseball game.  The Movie itself.  Well, maybe Hollywood thought the world needed a up to date sports comedy.  Taking off of other such sports movie as Major League or Necessary Roughness where you have a bunch of underdogs (that are made of rookies, has-beens, and off-the-wall characters) that, if only they work as team, they will beat even the best of the best, win the hearts of all fans and ulitmately get the girl.  I like movies like this, but this one didn't seem work.  The crew didn't seem to click together, like the actors were just doing this movie inbetween their real projects (Keanu- waiting for Matrix sequels, Favreau- getting back to directing and writing, Orlando Jones- making an actual funny movie with non-recycled gags).  The plot seemed too hokie.  They needed a story line that could bring together a bunch of underdogs (In Major League, the owner wanted to put together the worst team so she could get relocated to a new stadium.  In Necessary Roughness, the actual college players were pulled from the field because of bribes and under the table perks they were getting).  In this movie, the actual pro-team players go on strike mid season forcing the owners to bring in average joes (with remarkable abilities ofcourse) to fill in their places (which is probably taking off the real life strike Pro Baseball went through and owners recruited outside players).  The striking proplayers turn into the school bullies, all loyally following their quarterback, as they attempt to torment the players (turning over Falco's ((Reeves)) truck on more than one occasion).  There is bar fight, a leading lady (which claims she doesn't date football players, but just happens to fall for one in this particular instance) and plenty of slap-stick gags that seems they may appeal best to 12 year old males.  This isn't the first time Keanu has played a former football player.  He goes from Johnny Utah (college quarterback turned FBI surfer in Point Break to Footsteps Falco in this movie).  This isn't the first football movie for John Faveau, he played an over-weight nerd in Rudy. Gene Hackman played a better coach in Hoosiers.  For some of these actors like Orlando Jones or Rhys Ifan this may be a big deal.  Major motion pictures with big names to help out on their resume.  Not that they haven't played in other movies with equally big stars, this one didn't hurt.  For me, with the amount of actors in the movie, it makes playing &quot;6 degrees of Kevin Bacon&quot; that much easier. All and all, don't worry about rushing to your local video store to see this one anytime soon.  If you like any of the actors in this movie, then it may be something you may want to pick up.",2,Boring and Recycled,987638400,"04 19, 2001",2001,2963,"['Let', 'get', 'only', 'two', 'eliments', 'liked', 'movie', 'way', 'first', '1', 'cast', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'John', 'Favreau', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Gene', 'Hackman', '2', 'soundtrack', 'lots', 'great', 'sport', 'theme', 'songs', 'would', 'here', 'real', 'football', 'baseball', 'game', 'Movie', 'Well', 'maybe', 'Hollywood', 'thought', 'world', 'needed', 'up', 'date', 'sports', 'comedy', 'Taking', 'other', 'such', 'sports', 'movie', 'Major', 'League', 'Necessary', 'Roughness', 'where', 'have', 'bunch', 'underdogs', 'are', 'made', 'rookies', 'has-beens', 'off-the-wall', 'characters', 'only', 'work', 'as', 'team', 'will', 'beat', 'even', 'best', 'best', 'win', 'hearts', 'fans', 'ulitmately', 'get', 'girl', 'movies', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'crew', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'click', 'together', 'actors', 'were', 'just', 'doing', 'movie', 'inbetween', 'real', 'projects', 'Keanu-', 'waiting', 'Matrix', 'sequels', 'Favreau-', 'getting', 'back', 'directing', 'writing', 'Orlando', 'Jones-', 'making', 'actual', 'funny', 'movie', 'non-recycled', 'gags', 'plot', 'seemed', 'too', 'hokie', 'needed', 'story', 'line', 'could', 'bring', 'together', 'bunch', 'underdogs', 'Major', 'League', 'owner', 'wanted', 'put', 'together', 'worst', 'team', 'could', 'get', 'relocated', 'new', 'stadium', 'Necessary', 'Roughness', 'actual', 'college', 'players', 'were', 'pulled', 'field', 'bribes', 'table', 'perks', 'were', 'getting', 'movie', 'actual', 'pro-team', 'players', 'go', 'strike', 'mid', 'season', 'forcing', 'owners', 'bring', 'average', 'joes', 'remarkable', 'abilities', 'ofcourse', 'fill', 'places', 'probably', 'taking', 'off', 'real', 'life', 'strike', 'Pro', 'Baseball', 'went', 'owners', 'recruited', 'players', 'striking', 'proplayers', 'turn', 'school', 'bullies', 'loyally', 'following', 'quarterback', 'attempt', 'torment', 'players', 'turning', 'over', 'Falco', 'Reeves', 'truck', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'bar', 'fight', 'leading', 'lady', ""n't"", 'date', 'football', 'players', 'just', 'fall', 'one', 'particular', 'instance', 'plenty', 'slap-stick', 'gags', 'may', 'appeal', 'best', '12', 'year', 'old', 'males', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'Keanu', 'played', 'former', 'football', 'player', 'Johnny', 'Utah', 'college', 'quarterback', 'turned', 'FBI', 'surfer', 'Point', 'Break', 'Footsteps', 'Falco', 'movie', ""n't"", 'first', 'football', 'movie', 'John', 'Faveau', 'played', 'over-weight', 'nerd', 'Rudy', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'played', 'better', 'coach', 'Hoosiers', 'actors', 'Orlando', 'Jones', 'Rhys', 'Ifan', 'may', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'Major', 'motion', 'pictures', 'big', 'names', 'help', 'out', 'resume', 'Not', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'other', 'movies', 'equally', 'big', 'stars', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'amount', 'actors', 'movie', 'playing', 'quot', '6', 'degrees', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'quot', 'much', 'easier', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'about', 'rushing', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'see', 'one', 'anytime', 'soon', 'like', 'actors', 'movie', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'may', 'want', 'pick', 'up']",N/A

Keanu Reeves is all-American Shane Falco, an Ohio State QB who once fumbled the big game play on national television and his career was over before it started. The best character actor working today, Gene Hackman plays Jimmy McGinty, a retired coach who comes back one more time to inspire his team by respecting their talent and unique ability to rise above and beyond their former selves. Secondary roles are filled with former cop and tight end Jon Favreau, slippery fingers running back, Orlando Jones, and head cheerleader/bartender, Brook Langdon, who bond to comprise the little team that might.As team coaches try to develop this odd squad into players, the NFL prima donnas who walked off the job over money taunt Falco for his ""never was"" status by turning over his truck. Brett Cullen is the on-strike QB who is in Falco's face but the woe of QB Falco doesn't end there because on the field his team mates accidentally sack him as well. Poor Falco can't win for trying, but the lovely head cheer leader rubs his bruises with sweet potato lotion and everything is better.Comedy abounds in this ""loosers are winners, too"" film with the hysterical cheerleading squad of  lap dancers from the Pussykat Klub who can't even spell the team's name but manage to distract the opposition at just the right play, and the running jokes between the obsessive Bateman (Favreau) and Hackman's McGinty who needs his player to ""get me the ball"" and then worries his player won't kill anyone in the process of retrival.

You have seen it before, in movies like Major League, but the comedy in this movie is second to none.Amidst a players strike the Washington Sentinels hire replacement players and coaches to finish the season. With only three more wins the Sentinels can make the playoffs. Enter Gene Hackman. He is the maverick coach that brings in the most unlikely group of players the league has ever seen. In just a few weeks he works his magic and tries to transform this group of losers into a winning team. Hackman is probably to greatest actor on the planet, and he proves why in this movie. He takes an ordinary script with average dialogue and delivers it in such a way to make you feel and believe what he is saying. Keanu Reeves is the &quot;Never Was&quot; quarterback who does his best to lead the team to victory, and along the way falls in love with the head cheerleader. Along the way he has to deal with angry striking players, and a bevy of nuts that have given up their day jobs to play professional football. The group includes an insane S.W.A.T. cop, a felon on work release, a Sumo wrestler, two professional body guards, and the fastest grocery clerk on the planet played brilliantly by Orlando Jones (the 7UP guy).The action is well paced and the football sequences look real enough to please the avid football fan. Veteran announcers John Madden and Pat Summerall lend their talents to the film and give that added touch of realism. Hackman is the consummate wise old coach, and Reeves gives a passable performance as the struggling quarterback. Even the romantic scenes are well written and evenly placed within the film, but the real star of this movie is the in your face slapstick, side splitting humor peppered throughout the film.

Hackman is great as Coach McGinty and Reeves is quite believable as the unsure of himself ""never was"" Shane Falco. Whether due to the writing or the director we're presented with a bunch of guys who had a shot at the brass ring, missed their chance and have just one more shot for a little bit of glory. They start out disliking or not knowing each other and eventually `gel' as a team.  The fight in the bar is hysterical and the dance number in the jail afterwards is a must see, not to mention Shane Falco's parking problems.  There are a lot of standouts in this film: Orlando Jones, Jon Favreau, Faizon Love, Evan Parke as the preacher, Rhys Ifans as the ""Wirary"" Welshman and the egg vomiting Sumo Ace Yonamine (you gotta love this huddle scene).

528725,AVHCWL9AHLEL9,B00003CXLV,Christopher Ware,"[1, 3]","The impression I got from this movie was that they took the basic premise of NECESSARY ROUGHNESS (replace the regular athletes with a group of semi-talented ones and mix in a big dose of humor) and added a little melodrama to it.  The problem I had was that it couldn't seem to make up its mind if it wanted to be a drama with a little bit of comic relief or a comedy with a dramatic theme.  Neither the drama nor the comedy were focused on and that gave a certain weakness to the film.  It made me unable to take some of Hackman's more passionate speeches seriously.  If they were going to do a dramatic film, they should not have even touched the strippers turned cheerleaders.  If they were doing a comedy, there should have been more scenes with them.  Things of this nature, where they took an idea and tried to do it both comedically and dramatically, were what made me give the movie only three stars rather than four.  If the filmmakers could have made up their mind which way they wanted to go, then this film would have been more solid as a whole.There were two individual aspects of the film that bugged me.  First, Keanu's character's romance with the cheerleader was focused on a little too much.  It just seemed out of place.  Second, I would have liked a little more closure at the end...what happened to these characters afterward?As it is, the dramatic scenes are really well done and the comedic scenes are funny without going too much over the top.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching this movie.  I just think it could have been done a little differently and that would have made a world of difference.

While such movies usually provide their share of chuckles despite the unoriginal plot lines, &quot;The Replacements&quot; rarely even does that.  The plot centers around NFL owners having to draft replacements to fill in for the real players who have gone out on strike.  Predictably, the usual ragged band of louts and misfits show up to play for coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) of the fictitious Washington Sentinels, including washed up quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves).  Throw in a sub-plot involving a love interest for Reeves, a slightly eccentric owner (played by Jack Warden), and, or course, the entire season coming down to one final play as time is running out, and well, you can pretty much guess what happens.

Even if your skills, tactics, conditioning, experience and teamwork are fully up to snuff, you still have to win the game inside your head before you can win on the field.

I consider it to be Keanu Reeve's finest role, as an understated humble star college quarterback who flopped his first go around in the pros, and is given a second chance by the ever magnificent Gene Hackmen (Coach McGinty), during an NFL Strike (Well it's not the NFL because they use different names for the teams, but it is meant to be loosely based on the 1987 NFL strike).What I truly loved about it was the development of each replacement player's character, a genuine soulful treatment of their real fears and  their desperation for a second chance at  ""greatness, no matter how brief"".  The kind that ""stays with a man.""  What makes it all work in my opinion is Gene Hackman (who I believe is one of the top 5 actors of all time), who just shines as a coach who cares greatly about the game and his players and making sure his players do everything they can to live out their second chance.  Keanu is terrific as a man who has been kicked in the teeth, and rises in a genuine, realistic way back to lead his team.  The other characters like Brian Murphy, the deaf receiver, and Nigel ""Wiry"" Gruff, are all terrific, Jon Favreau, etc... are all fantastic.  The cheerleaders are great, Brooke Langton is great as Keanu's love interest, the story is excellent, and hilarious, and you just can't help but feel like you've ""been part of something great.""I cannot recommend the Replacements enough.

Director Howard Deutch and writer Vince McKewin do just that. This film features a silly slapstick, broadly drawn set of characters who are believably played by a very talented cast.The legendary Gene Hackman plays straight man to Orlando jones, Fraizon Love, Jon Favreau , personal favorite Rhys Ifans ( of "" Notting Hill "" fame ) and many other wonderful performers.The plot is simple enough. A group of former college players ( and a former English football star with a serious gambling problem ) and at least one convict are assembled in a desperate attempt to keep the the Washington Sentinels on the field in the face of a players strike. Hackman is brought on board by that living acting institution Jack Warden, to take this assemblage of unheard of misfits and mold them into a viable professional team. What proceeds from that point is pretty much what one would expect, which is just fine with me. The casting is perfect. The lesser known actors, whether they play football players or exotic dancers turned cheerleaders are dead on perfect in their roles. I particularly enjoyed Keanu Reeves's on screen chemistry with the lovely and charming Brooke Langton.But of course, the signature scene of this film is where the Replacement players sign and dance to the disco era classic "" I Will Survive "" while behind bars for a fight they has against the Sentinel's regular players.

In other words, comedy and football (as well as other sports) have had a place in films for almost as long as The Great Train Robbery. This one gave two real (acting) pros a chance to make a few bucks: Jack Warden, playing his last film role almost anonymously, since he is not even mentioned on the DVD container, and Gene Hackman, now retired, who probably made more than a few bucks co-starring. They did the best with what they had to work with: which wasn't much, Most of the film is the kind of clowning around that  passes for comedy when you use writers still attending Southern Cal's movie writing course (and, failing it). Saving the production, as it usually does, are the Big Games, which provide stunning examples of how, ""Heart"" beats Johnny Unitas and Company any time (it's needed in a film). Incidentally, for those who remember, Hackman is given several chances verbally to tout that grand song from Damn Yankees (which I saw in its first run on Broadway).

It also parodies how seriously we as a nation take football in almost satiric fashion.The film contains some motifs that are certain to be recognized, such as the speedy wide receiver who can get open but can't catch the ball (a-la NECESSARY ROUGHNESS).  The former walk-on linebacker out of Michigan State is obviously modeled on the character Tackleberry from POLICE ACADEMY.  However, these somewhat recycled thematic elements do not take away from the film.  Rather, they add to its charm - and this film is surprisingly heavy on charm!The acting, for the most part, is right on.  As he played an inspirational basketball coach in HOOSIERS, Gene Hackman proves that he is equally up to the task of portraying a determined (if somewhat burned out) football coach in THE REPLACEMENTS.

528751,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXLV,"""flickjunkie""","[24, 28]","Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen ""losers to winners"" sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummeled in a college bowl game and he was labeled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things.  You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational ""Hoosiers"" imitation was misplaced.This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel ""The Leg"" Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.  The scenes with an incredulous Pat Summerall and John Madden were also fabulous.This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.

528758,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00003CXLV,Jason,"[1, 5]","When Gene Hackman is in a sports movie, it's impossible to see him as anyone other than coach Norman Dale from Hoosiers.  Unfortunately, Keanu Reeves is more Shooter than he is Jimmy Chitwood.  Nonetheless, this travesty of a sports movie was given the nod, and the rest is history.The setup for the movie is stolen straight from Major League.  A pro team has no players, but this time it's a strike instead of an insane owner.  A wily, unknown coach is hired to build a team.  A motley crew of assorted clich&eacute;s is soon picked up.Once again Coach Hackman amazes with his complete lack of coaching ability, as he insists on picking up a former college QB with a rag-arm to lead his team.  Surely there were countless other guys in the Arena league or in the CFL who would have loved the chance at the NFL, but Hackman goes with a guy who can't throw a fit, let alone a football.  His QB of choice, Shane ""Footsteps"" Falco (Reeves), is a guy who had a horrible bowl game in his college finale, and was rightfully branded as a choke artist. (Side note: In this movie Keanu essentially plays the same Johnny Utah role he did in Point Break)Aside from Falco, Hackman picks up some token athletes while several others fill in the movie gaps (with Major League counterparts in parenthesis):1) A psycopathic, borderline idiot to play linebacker (Favreau) and serve as the Wild Thing, er, Card (Ricky Vaughn)2) The wild, crazy foreigner, a chain-smoking British guy who used to be a soccer star, and can now do the field-goal kicking duties (Pedro Serrano)3) The big, brooding, intimidating, scary ex-convict (Pedro Cerrano mixed with Ricky Vaughn)4) The anonymous black guy with track star speed and an uncanny knack for witty, funny one-liners (Willie Mays Hayes)5) The handicapped guy who overcomes his deafness (Jake Taylor)6) The three obese offensive linemen who aren't really athletes (Eddie Harris)7) Eventually one of the smarmy pros comes back to the team, QB Eddie Martell, and nobody likes him (Roger Dorn)8) Annabelle (Brooke Langton), a cheerleader, and love-interest for Falco, does nothing except display the top half of her boobs during every scene on camera (Lynn Wells)With the puzzle pieces in place, there is an awkward lack of sexual chemistry between Annabelle and Falco, meaningless coach-speak from Hackman (who mails it in by recycling his Coach Dale routine), the coming together as a team scene (an absolutely wretched scene where the team dances together in a jail to the song ""I Will Survive""), and the inevitable match-up versus the superior opponent.The absolute best part of the movie is at the beginning when Falco is throwing a metal football from a trophy while underwater.  It's the best scene Keanu has ever been in because he couldn't speak.A serviceable sports movie, The Replacements provides just enough sports action for the die-hard sports fan to enjoy, and just enough preposterousness for the cynic to ridicule.

One great movie.""The Replacements"" is a movie about athletes who forget salary caps and product endorsements (although this feature is chock-full of product placement) and remember football.""The Replacements"" is a light comedy, but nevertheless, like ""Any Given Sunday,"" pushes an agenda.  It portrays athletes as money-grubbing crybabies more interested in counting their money than playing.  It suggests that heart and love of the game are lost in professional football, but the agenda is equally lost in the humor and excitement of the hard-hitting games.The Washington Sentinels represent the riffraff-composed Washington Redskins who became a darkhorse team during the 1987 National Football League players' strike.  Upon the mid-season strike, the NFL coaches scrambled together a bricolage of players to finish out the season.Less retired and more fired Coach Jimmy McGinty, played by Gene Hackman (from Mississippi Burning), is rehired to coach the Washington Sentinels, a ragtag and bobtail consisting of has-beens and never-were, one being former Ohio State quarterback Shane ""Footsteps"" Falco, AKA Keanu Reeves.This jaded group of players met in discord, but with Coach McGinty's tutelage and Falco's lead-by-example bravado, they soon began working as a team, to ultimately compete in their final showdown against Dallas.Off the field, Falco is making a `pass' at Sentinel head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell, played by Brooke Langton.  However, Annabelle, with her ""I don't date football players...especially quarterbacks"" schtick, makes for a tough opponent.In the end, Farrell, in light of Falco's growing on her like bacteria in a petri dish, discovers that she does indeed date quarterbacks.""The Replacements"" is not an Oscar candidate but it isn't running for one either.  It is an upbeat movie that instills faith in quixotical dreams.  It adds a little humor, mostly from the mouth of Orlando Jones, who plays Clifford Franklin, as spice for a feelgood entr&eacute;e.If you're tired of the sausage of summer action movies perpetually coming from Hollywood's movie meatgrinder, relax, enjoy, and revel in ""The Replacements.""",4,In the Red Zone of Hollywood: Touchdown!

Hackman (tell me a bad Hackman movie?) reprises his role as a coach who is possibly a better leader (or are they the same?) as he began with Norman Dale in Hoosiers.Here the curmudgeon Jack Warden assigns Hackman the veteran NFL Coach the job of coaching the replacements or scabs for the now striking NFL players. But Hackman sees in his replacements the men who never got a second chance. If you listen to his conversations about greatness and glory and changing your life it almost (don't give up on me here) becomes spiritual.So Keanu Reeves becomes the team quarterback and although he is particulary wooden, he is less wooden here and you begin to believe in him. Hackman and Reeves don't become father and son but they might become mentor and student.It's kind of a neat story but if you take really great sports movies, Hoosiers, Natural, Titans, they chose to pass up the opportunities to pander with racial humor and the Burt Reynalds obligatory barroom brawl and cleavage. I think that's why we didn't take ""Replacements"" all that seriously.Kudos to Hackman and Reeves. The football sequences may be the most believable, and don't get me wrong, the brawling, the towel snapping humor and the cleavage is all wonderful. But how did you want us to take the storyline? It's difficult to take Hackman's pep talk about inside every boy is the chance to become a great man, when the camera then flashes on the adult cheerleaders doing the bump and grind and grind and grind.While you'll enjoy the movie, I don't think Citizen Kane should be concerned.

I love movies and The Replacements is the funniest football movie I've ever seen.The Replacements is the story about the Washington Sentinels. A fictional football team in a fictional league. The league has had a players strike and the teams are told to replace them. Washington hires Jimmy McGinty(Hackman) a former coach to lead them. The lead player is QB Shane Falco(Reeves) a QB that never got a chance. McGinty puts a team of misfits and former players around Falco and expects him to lead them to victory.Gene Hackman is great in the film. He is one of the best actors of all-time. Few can play a charcter like him. I like the way he plays Jimmy McGinty. McGinty has the fire of Mike Ditka and the wisdom and heart of Vince Lombardi. Hackman does a great job playing him.Keanu Reeves is also great in the film. This is one of the better charcters he's ever played. So often does Keanu work in films with so many other great actors and he always holds his own. He's with Hackman and he holds true to the statement I just said.

Today, nearly a century later, this situation remains unchanged. Surely thousands of talented and creative people have been turned away by now, yet still the movie business seems to have more than its fair share of incompetents. Perhaps it is true that what the mediocre do best is to defend their turf.Take The Replacements - please! If someone hadn't apparently cast a spell on Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman which caused them accept roles in this effort, then it would have no reason at all to exist.The Washington Sentinels football team is having an okay season until its league has a players' strike with only four games left until the playoffs. The gruff old owner [Jack Warden] begs his team's former coach, Jimmy McGinty [Gene Hackman], to work for him again. His idea is to finish the season with replacement players, aka scabs. McGinty happens to have a list in his head of potential players, most of whom have missed their chance at glory and have dropped off the face of the Earth. One of these is Shane Falco [Keanu Reeves], an ex-college quarterback whose former team suffered the worst defeat in Sugar Bowl history. Shane now scraps barnacles off boats for a living. Other replacements include a sumo wrestler, a soccer player, a deaf-mute and a guy who is fresh out of prison. McGinty has one week to whip these men into shape. For some reason, the cheerleaders have gone missing, too, and it is up to Annabelle [Brooke Langton] to recruit new ones. Meanwhile, the striking players have nothing better to do than to hassle the replacements.I do not expect a movie always to mirror real life. Still, when I see movies that veer totally from reality, it makes me uncomfortable. Often, these movies simply aren't clever enough to divert my attention from such shortcomings. When a movie has plot holes but is well made, you don't think about these faults until after it is over. Watching The Replacements, I couldn't quit thinking about how dumb it was to imagine anyone's simply going out and replacing an entire professional team within a week. To me, this is an example of having a funny idea that is not strong enough to support a whole movie and then proceeding to force things into place to try to make it work.Mr. Reeves and Mr. Hackman have not fallen in stature in my eyes, but surely this is the low point in both star's careers. I hope that they have now learned that loving to watch football does not automatically qualify one to make a movie about the sport. As for director Howard Deutch, the movie is sadly about on par with his other efforts. These include The Odd Couple II, Grumpier Old Men and Getting Even With Dad. The latter was the film that finally persuaded Macauly Culkin to quit making movies entirely.",1,Doesn't work as comedy or as a movie about football,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2914,"['day', 'first', 'studio', 'opened', 'Hollywood', 'former', 'farmer', 'field', 'were', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'movie', 'business', 'were', 'jobs', 'available', 'Today', 'nearly', 'century', 'later', 'situation', 'unchanged', 'Surely', 'thousands', 'talented', 'creative', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'turned', 'away', 'now', 'yet', 'still', 'movie', 'business', 'have', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'incompetents', 'Perhaps', 'true', 'what', 'mediocre', 'do', 'best', 'defend', 'turf.Take', 'Replacements', 'please', 'someone', 'had', ""n't"", 'apparently', 'cast', 'spell', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'caused', 'accept', 'roles', 'effort', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'reason', 'exist.The', 'Washington', 'Sentinels', 'football', 'team', 'having', 'okay', 'season', 'league', 'players', 'strike', 'only', 'four', 'games', 'left', 'playoffs', 'gruff', 'old', 'owner', '[', 'Jack', 'Warden', ']', 'team', 'former', 'coach', 'Jimmy', 'McGinty', '[', 'Gene', 'Hackman', ']', 'work', 'again', 'idea', 'finish', 'season', 'replacement', 'players', 'aka', 'scabs', 'McGinty', 'have', 'list', 'head', 'potential', 'players', 'most', 'whom', 'have', 'missed', 'chance', 'glory', 'have', 'dropped', 'off', 'face', 'Earth', 'One', 'Shane', 'Falco', '[', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', ']', 'ex-college', 'quarterback', 'former', 'team', 'suffered', 'worst', 'defeat', 'Sugar', 'Bowl', 'history', 'Shane', 'now', 'barnacles', 'off', 'boats', 'living', 'Other', 'replacements', 'include', 'sumo', 'wrestler', 'soccer', 'player', 'deaf-mute', 'guy', 'who', 'fresh', 'prison', 'McGinty', 'one', 'week', 'whip', 'men', 'shape', 'reason', 'cheerleaders', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'too', 'Annabelle', '[', 'Brooke', 'Langton', ']', 'recruit', 'new', 'ones', 'Meanwhile', 'striking', 'players', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'hassle', 'replacements.I', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'movie', 'always', 'mirror', 'real', 'life', 'Still', 'when', 'see', 'movies', 'veer', 'totally', 'reality', 'uncomfortable', 'Often', 'movies', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'clever', 'enough', 'divert', 'attention', 'such', 'shortcomings', 'When', 'movie', 'plot', 'holes', 'well', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'faults', 'Watching', 'Replacements', 'could', ""n't"", 'quit', 'thinking', 'how', 'dumb', 'was', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'simply', 'going', 'out', 'replacing', 'entire', 'professional', 'team', 'week', 'example', 'having', 'funny', 'idea', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'support', 'whole', 'movie', 'then', 'proceeding', 'force', 'things', 'place', 'try', 'make', 'work.Mr', 'Reeves', 'Mr.', 'Hackman', 'have', 'not', 'fallen', 'stature', 'eyes', 'surely', 'low', 'point', 'star', 'careers', 'hope', 'have', 'now', 'learned', 'loving', 'watch', 'football', 'not', 'automatically', 'qualify', 'one', 'make', 'movie', 'sport', 'director', 'Howard', 'Deutch', 'movie', 'sadly', 'par', 'other', 'efforts', 'include', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'II', 'Grumpier', 'Old', 'Men', 'Getting', 'Even', 'Dad', 'latter', 'was', 'film', 'finally', 'persuaded', 'Macauly', 'Culkin', 'quit', 'making', 'movies', 'entirely']",N/A

If you don't know much about American football, then it's pretty easy to follow. The only thing I found difficult was trying to figure out which player was which, with all their gear on!It's surprisingly funny at the same time, and you're always laughing! Whether its during the bar fight (don't mess with the BIG guys) or the extremely camp dancing to ""I Will Survive"" in the jail, you'll be crying with laughter.Rhys Ifans is a great choice for this, as are all of the actors. I wouldn't have said Keanu was the best choice for this, as he has a hockey background (which was gave him the nickname ""The Wall"" when he was younger), and it must have taken a lot of training for all the actors to act like professional football players.Of course, you're got to have the cheerleaders in a football movie. And since all the players have been replaced, the cheerleaders need to be replaced too. Cue some very bad cheerleading from not very nice looking girls. And then the cheerleaders are . . . strippers. Thankfully, they don't strip, although their ""routine"" is very suggestive, and definitely distracts all the players.You've got the obvious storyline too - Shane Falco (Keanu) falls in love with the head cheerleader (Annabelle Farrell). Never heard that storyline before.If you're a fan of Friends (how come all the movies I watch have a character from Friends in it?!) look out for Jon Favreau, who played Monica's boyfriend, Pete, from some of the earlier seasons. He was the guy who was the multi-millionaire, who became a wrestler, and lost Monica.The extras are pretty basic, and they could have done so much more. You've got the trailer (a must-have for me) which is actually really good, and also the commentary, ""The Making of the Replacements"" and ""Making the Plays: An Actor's Guide to Football"". ""The Making Of . . ."" is presented by Orlando Jones, who is so camp, its not funny! It's not really the greatest making of I've ever seen though.If you don't like ""I Will Survive"" by Gloria Gaynor, probably not the best idea to watch this movie. It gets played a lot! But there are a lot of great songs, so now I'm after the soundtrack. Rumour has it; there's a Dogstar song tucked away in the soundtrack, so I'll be getting my hands on that!If you're a sports fan you'll love this. If you like Keanu Reeves, you'll love this. If you like a laugh, you'll love this! Don't make me watch the bar fight again, cos there was nearly an accident!

The soundtrack fits like a glove and is often hilarious, especially when the ex-stripper cheerleaders are distracting the opposing team or sending the male fans into fits of desire.

Orlando Jones (in a funny performance) starts singing ""I Will Surive"" and we end up with these macho guys singing along and dancing in the holding room.  It blew me away with its freshness.  Add to this the addition of prostitutes as sexually charged cheerleaders and this gives THE REPLACEMENTS the honor of being one of the freshest and funniest sports movies ever made.  In a world where overpaid athletes worry more about their salaries and endorsements than their fans, THE REPLACEMENTS gives us a bunch of misfits who have the heart and talent, even if they are a little rough around the edges.  Director Howard Deutch keeps the action crisp and exciting, and even in using the expected cliches, he gives us a movie that provides much entertainment.  Keanu Reeves uses his acting chops very well for a change; his dismissive and laconic personality adds to his charm as he realizes he is the heart behind the team.  Gene Hackman takes his cliche role and elevates it to his usual standard of excellence, and the cast of football players is superb:  David Denman as the deaf mute; Brett Cullen as the arrogant striking quarterback; Jones; Rhys Ifans in his role as the superkicker; and so on.  Jon Favreau is brilliant as the somewhat demented SWAT team member, who comes on like a charging bull.  Brooke Langton as the head cheerleader and Keanu's love interest is also effective.  The football action is fast and furious, and the team's devotion to each other carries the ball for the movie.  I am not the greatest fan of sports movies, but THE REPLACEMENTS is one of the best.

Loosely based on a football strike from 1987, The Replacements is a lightweight comedy that provides the laughs. It manages to blend the humor pretty well into a sports movie about playing football with heart. The film would not be good if it weren't rounded out by such a good cast. The always dependable Gene Hackman becomes the good guy/mentor to Reeves' quarterback. Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans, and Jon Favreau and the rest of the team provide comic relief as the out there players.

528797,A1W9IFSHMYDQJU,B00003CXLV,"Nettie ""Nettie""","[0, 0]","Wow! If I could give this movie any more stars I would give it 10!!It has it all ~ Great direction, a superb cast of very funny 'cats' and a really rocking soundtrack.It's stars the very excellent KEANU REEVES, as Shane 'Footsteps' Falco, a professional football player who bombed back in '96.He and his fellow team mates are given a 'second chance' to make it big as the 'replacements' when the real Washington Sentinels go on strike.This is based on true events, which I always find more endearing.Howard Deutch has made a gem of a film, which I'd gladly watch over and over again with no difficulty.His sense of what is humourous is spot on and I just love the way different scenes are interspliced to give the movie it's own unique style.The guys that directed the 'plays' on the football field did a marvellous job! You get to see the real action and it keeps you glued to your seat [I'm definately going to find out more about American football]. The background music is well chosen to suit the situations that come up and just plain ROCKS!!This is definately a film to watch whilst wearing headphones!! LOLWatch 'The Replacements' and you will understand exactly why I love Keanu Reeves. Mr Reeves is absolutely awesome as the quaterback with the hard task of getting his rag-tag team together. He's humble yet when it comes to the crunch can stand up there on his own.His character reminds me of Neo [from 'The Matrix' if ya didn't know...], due to his initial self-doubt, but with the help of a good strong woman [Annabelle, played very well by Brooke Langton], anything is possible [I'm sounding all Matrixy now LOL].The other characters are uniquely wonderful and played marvellously. My favourites are:ORLANDO JONES as 'Clifford Franklin'. Has to be seen to be believed. This gentleman is a real talent and had me rolling with laughter. He has some great lines.RHYS IFANS as 'Nigel Gruff'. Man! he is soooooo funny and has some real classic moments.JON FAVREAU puts his all into 'Bateman' ~ not to be messed with, but truely hillarious!GO BUY THIS MOVIE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!Now regarding the DVD version of this movie all I have to say is I'm glad that Mr Deutch decided to keep those scenes he was thinking about cutting out [*phew*].  There's a driving scene which is absolutely priceless!!My only regrets are that there are no deleted scenes [I would have loved to have seen more of Keanu 'dancing']. And it would have been nice to had a 'music only' soundtrack, because the music in this movie is so awesome!!I would also like to say that I am a tad disappointed with Warner Bros for not distributing this movie in England as yet! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

I'm not sure if people that do not understand football will enjoy this movie as much, but The Replacements hits every thing that Any Given Sunday missed.Any Given Sunday has more star actors/actresses, ex-NFL players, etc. but it missed the spirit that this movie captures. The pure love of the game was never captured by Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday but The Replacements (the other NFL strike year movie last year) does that and more.This movie is comparable to Major League with an NFL twist and less comedy.  The Washington Sentinels (which is fictional; no NFL team names in this movie) with their new coach (Gene Hackman) must win 3 out of 4 games to go to the playoffs.  The replacement players consist of a sumo wrestling offensive lineman, 'choker' quarterback, ex-convict defensive back, reborn again christian halfback, etc.  It makes for an enjoyable movie and captures the excitement, comraderie and adrenaline that anyone who plays or watches football feels on a regular basis.If you're a fan of the game, you'll be cheering for the onscreen team as much as you did for your favorite pro or college team's last big game.

528810,A13910TC3NZ6LE,B00003CXLV,Sam Bethune,"[1, 2]","As football movies go, &quot;The Replacements&quot; doesn't break any new ground.  I found it rather similar to &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; except that the latter movie dealt with a college football team on probation whereas this film is about a pro team that replaces its striking players with unknowns looking for a second chance at glory.  The rather ugly word &quot;scab&quot; comes to mind here and thankfully is used only a few times in the film.Keanu Reeves is good but unremarkable as ex-college quarterback Shane Falco, who choked in a bowl game only to become a footnote in college football history.  One customer reviewer refers to Reeves' performance as a &quot;comeback&quot;, but I question the accuracy of that statement. &quot;The Replacements&quot; is Reeves' first movie since &quot;The Matrix&quot;, which although critically panned did reasonably at the box office and is somewhat of a cult favorite.  I for one don't think his career was in decline to begin with.  Gene Hackman turns in his usual fine performance as the team's coach, rehired by owner Jack Warden.As one might expect with this type of picture, the replacement players are a ragtag unruly bunch until Falco provides some much needed leadership.

Since it was supposedly a football movie, I did not rush to the theater to see it, but waited.  When I finally watched it I definately thought that this movie was right up my alley.  It starts out with the football league players all going on strike since they weren't making enough money.  The players were portrayed as spoiled know it all types.  So, to salvage the season, the owner of the Washington Sentinels hires a coach played by Gene Hackman to scout and put together a team of replacement players.  The variety of guys is incredible and sets the audience up for a lot of laughs to follow.  The quarterback of this team is played by Keanu Reeves who plays a solid working class guy who is now given a second chance for glory.There is the inevitable romance, tons of laughs, and football sequences where you don't have to know much about the game to understand what is going on.  I thought that this was a cute, funny, romantic movie to watch.  I'm not sure if it's one that I could watch over and over again or if it really has any memorable lines, but definately worth watching at least once.

528816,A10C5CJK1YKGV0,B00003CXLV,Steffan Piper,"[0, 0]","Every year when it's Superbowl time, I pull this movie out to remind me of a few very important things. The main thing first: American Football isn't what it used to be. Second, neither are the players. I'll probably watch it two or three times during the course of the week as well, just to make sure I get enough mileage out of the jokes, but more importantly the message. I won't take it too seriously though as it is just a movie that's meant to be tongue-in-cheek even if it is based on actual events.Football used to be a sacred institution, a pinnacle of inspiration for `the everyman', a place many men would hope their son's would end up. But it just doesn't feel the way it used to when you devote your evening to getting into the game and carefully watching it unfold. Following a team throughout the year doesn't have the same allure when your five million dollar player blows his knee in game three, the quarterback gets arrested for felony animal abuse or testing positive for steroids or some other such nonsense.In the film and in real life, the players in question drive hundred thousand dollar cars, live in castles and seem to go on strike when the wind blows too hard inside the temperature controlled arena. But don't get me wrong, a team is comprised of everyone of its players and those players that do the most work are often the least recognized. These days college ball has the allure, the attraction and the equivalent fan base that pro football used to have.This film was obviously (to those that saw it) inspired by the dramatic events that took place in 1987 for the Replacement Sunday Games. Thirteen teams brought together replacement players for probably some of the most interesting football to ever grace the small screen, with both Pat Summerall and John Madden in both versions. It was shortly after this that my interest in all things NFL waned. But to be honest, being from Pennsylvania, I grew up a die-hard Steelers fan and rooted `one for the thumb' back in '81. It wasn't because of the replacement players that my interest vanished, but the lack of them after the strike ended. A lot of fans and viewers were left with a bad taste in their mouths from over-paid debutante's that had lost their way. Sports commentators in general, historians and those with the NFL hated all this and were quick to put it behind them, but the newspapers were full of personal stories about these players for some time and the fans loved it, just as it's played out in the film. There's more truth in this film than some may realize.In 1987, I was sixteen going on seventeen, and I remember the news reports for the open call for replacement players. As a teenager, I often thought I could take over the world and remember being bummed thinking how cool it would be if I could've tried out as a replacement player. For me, the strike was a very romantic moment in sports history as I envisioned myself as one of those players. The reality is, I think a lot of people felt the same way which was why those games were so memorable and so popular.So, in 2000, Keanu Reeves takes the field as Shane Falco, a would-be hero had he not blown his career at `The Sugerbowl' earlier in life. A stink that Rhys Ifans gambling-addicted character 'Nigel Gruff' says could be smelt all the way back in Whales. ""What a bloody shambles that was!""I have some good memories when this film came out and when I saw it for the first time. For me, I'll always enjoy this film for its simplicity and it's art which it has in spades. The casting seems completely intentional from Gene Hackman as Jimmy McGinty (""That old Coach from the Eighties""), the ever-timeless Jack Warden as a would-be Jack Kent Cook, and yes, it's the Washington Sentinels, too. It would be pretty hard not to get that reference. The film is also graced with a long list of great faces that seem to get just enough screen-time to build the characters and give them enough life making them all endearing. Orlando Jones, ""Jumbo"", the ""Wirey"" Welshman, psycho ""Batemen"" (nod to Bret Easton Ellis, maybe?) and the rest. A very memorable cast indeed. John Madden and Pat Summerall get quite a bit of screentime as well, bringing some real football authenticity to the film.I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this is really a `Tak Fujimoto' film. Those that don't know may end up googling it, those that do know understand exactly what I'm saying. Tak Fujimoto is hands down one of the finest living cinematographers in Hollywood today and every film he's involved in bears his mark. All the shots, the light, the natural look and the attention to detail. If you're making a film, you probably want Tak Fujimoto as the DP. Tak Fujimoto has a way of giving even the most simple of films an incredibly high-end and classic look, something that is often emulated but rarely duplicated.The Replacementsis probably one of the better films made about the sport in the last thirty years. If you collect up all the films made about football, it's definitely in the top 5. More for its originality and comedic value than anything else, like drama or intrigue.If you're interested in any of the music that you heard during the film, or theThe Replacements soundtrack, please

Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman), a former championship coach, is brought in to put together a team for the Washington Sentinels, a team that could have a chance at the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The team McGinty huddles together includes a Japanese sumo wrestler, two gangsters, a psychotic cop, a Welsh soccer player, and Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves)-a former college star who lost a big bowl championship and was never heard from again. The team struggles to find unity, but eventually find their groove together and along the way Falco falls in love with the team's cheerleading coach.Ever since THE MATRIX, Reeves has finally been able to shake the &#34;Bill & Ted&#34; goofiness that haunted his acting. He does a fairly believable job in THE REPLACEMENTS and for Keanu Reeves, that's saying a great deal. Gene Hackman is just the ... as McGinty, a coach who has a personality a lot like Mike Martz (of the St. Louis Rams). The film has a wonderful supporting cast including Orlando Jones, Jon Favreau, Rhys Ifans, and Ace Yonamine.The major drawback of the film is that there isn't much continuity; the movie felt disjointed with scenes not flowing into each other well at all. This lack of continuity was somewhat covered by the awesome rocking soundtrack. However, music should never be the star of a film and when it plays a bigger part than the script, a movie almost always suffers.I found the film to be more enjoyable than I originally thought it would be and I was impressed by Keanu Reeves.

I believe that this one is one of the few that will rise above the rest.  With great actors like Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves it's hard to go wrong.  The story of the movie is simple enough.  The players for the Washington Sentinels go on strike.  To fill the empty slots the owner of the team hires Hackman to find a replacement team.  From there on is where the extreme comedy comes into play.  Reeves plays Shane Falco, a washed out college quarterback who comes back to lead the Sentinels to victory.  The rest of the cast really helps the movie as well.  Actors like Jon Favreau (Swingers, Very Bad Things) and Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Little Nicky) join the team and for me, they made the movie.

I truly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it.",3,"An Enjoyable, Laugh Out Loud Comedy",976406400,"12 10, 2000",2000,942,"['movie', 'made', 'sport', 'world', 'Most', 'sort', 'run', 'together', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'forgettable', 'believe', 'one', 'one', 'few', 'will', 'rise', 'rest', 'great', 'actors', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Keanu', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'story', 'movie', 'simple', 'enough', 'players', 'Washington', 'Sentinels', 'go', 'strike', 'fill', 'empty', 'slots', 'owner', 'team', 'Hackman', 'find', 'replacement', 'team', 'where', 'extreme', 'comedy', 'play', 'Reeves', 'Shane', 'Falco', 'washed', 'out', 'college', 'quarterback', 'who', 'back', 'lead', 'Sentinels', 'victory', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Actors', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Swingers', 'Very', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Rhys', 'Ifans', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Little', 'Nicky', 'join', 'team', 'made', 'movie', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'movie', 'know', 'could', ""n't"", 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
528823,A3GFOHZK47GEZQ,B00003CXLV,"Virginia Trammell Jericho ""Virgie""","[2, 3]","Second chances, Romances, and vindication all wind up in the film ""The Replacements"" which happens to be loosely based on the NFL Strike of 1987 and the drama that surrounded the eventual Superbowl Champion Washington Redskins.  Like the Redskins, the ""Replacements"" in this film are former or undrafted players who are asked to fill in to play because the roster is emptied due to a strike.  Gene Hackman is the coach and has to go try and get a washed up Quarterback named Shane Falco to join the squad.  Falco is played by Keanu Reeves and he fits the jock role pretty well.  With determination and grit, this group of misfits, which includes a chain smoking place-kicker, soon come together to show that there is no I in Team, but there is in Win.  Sports and movie fans alike will not be surprised to see Hackman again in the coach's seat (Hoosiers) or the fact that Reeve's again plays a ""former"" Ohio State Buckeye Quarterback (Johnny Utah from Point Break) in this film.  Great cast and in between those funny parts are some serious ones.  The film is not dull and does a good attempt at meshing both the comedy parts as well as the serious ones, which really heat up during the end of the regular season.  Great for friends or the whole family,  I highly recommend it for any Saturday evening!",4,"Great ""Feel Good"" Film starring Gene Hackman",1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,1302,"['Second', 'chances', 'Romances', 'vindication', 'wind', 'up', 'film', 'Replacements', 'be', 'loosely', 'based', 'NFL', 'Strike', '1987', 'drama', 'surrounded', 'eventual', 'Superbowl', 'Champion', 'Washington', 'Redskins', 'Redskins', 'Replacements', 'film', 'are', 'former', 'undrafted', 'players', 'who', 'are', 'asked', 'fill', 'play', 'roster', 'emptied', 'due', 'strike', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'coach', 'go', 'try', 'get', 'washed', 'up', 'Quarterback', 'named', 'Shane', 'Falco', 'join', 'squad', 'Falco', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'jock', 'role', 'pretty', 'well', 'determination', 'grit', 'group', 'misfits', 'chain', 'smoking', 'place-kicker', 'soon', 'come', 'together', 'show', 'Team', 'Win', 'Sports', 'movie', 'fans', 'alike', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'Hackman', 'again', 'coach', 'seat', 'Hoosiers', 'fact', 'Reeve', 'again', 'former', 'Ohio', 'State', 'Buckeye', 'Quarterback', 'Johnny', 'Utah', 'Point', 'Break', 'film', 'Great', 'cast', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', 'serious', 'ones', 'film', 'not', 'dull', 'good', 'attempt', 'meshing', 'comedy', 'parts', 'as', 'well', 'serious', 'ones', 'really', 'heat', 'up', 'end', 'regular', 'season', 'Great', 'friends', 'whole', 'family', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Saturday', 'evening']",N/A
