Shelley Long plays her part quite over the top--possibly for comic effect, though sometimes it was hard to tell. The brief summary in the product review just about covers the plot--it isn't deep, though there are some serious issues involved (the ""groom's"" inability to commit, the father's absentee approach--or escape from--parenting, the mother's absorption in her work, to the exclusion of her daughter).As far as family friendliness goes, they ""honeymoon"" on an island resort, so with all of the beachwear there is some skin, but no nudity. There are no bedroom scenes, not even implied. Some language incidents that might concern some parents--someone calls someone else an a** and the mother admires a hotel employee's bu**. There were three or four times when common swear words were used. Also, there is a scene of note when the jilted woman and her mother are on the ""honeymoon"". The ex-fiancee has eventually followed them and the mother lets the ex  shower in their room, since he can't get a room and had to sleep on the beach. The mother leaves while he is showering and the daughter returns to the room, not knowing what is going on. She is in her bikini, having just come from the beach. She is laying out the clothes she is going to change into when her ex walks out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. She asks what he is doing there. He answers, ""Showering, want to join me?"" That is as far as it goes.There is more than one romance in the storyline, and I will say that the outcome of one of them was not what I had expected, and you usually get what you expect in these chick flicks.As my 3 star rating indicates, this is OK for what it is, but it does not come highly recommended from me.",3,Very fluffy chick flick,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,1830,"['bought', 'whim', 'when', 'wanted', 'mental', 'escape', 'stressful', 'things', 'definitely', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'part', 'quite', 'top', 'possibly', 'comic', 'effect', 'sometimes', 'was', 'hard', 'tell', 'brief', 'summary', 'product', 'review', 'just', 'covers', 'plot', ""n't"", 'deep', 'are', 'serious', 'issues', 'involved', 'groom', 'inability', 'commit', 'father', 'absentee', 'approach', 'escape', 'parenting', 'mother', 'absorption', 'work', 'exclusion', 'daughter', '.As', 'far', 'family', 'friendliness', 'honeymoon', 'island', 'resort', 'beachwear', 'skin', 'nudity', 'are', 'bedroom', 'scenes', 'not', 'even', 'implied', 'language', 'incidents', 'might', 'concern', 'parents', 'someone', 'someone', 'else', 'a**', 'mother', 'hotel', 'employee', 'bu**', 'were', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'when', 'common', 'swear', 'words', 'were', 'used', 'Also', 'scene', 'note', 'when', 'jilted', 'woman', 'mother', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'ex-fiancee', 'eventually', 'followed', 'mother', 'ex', 'shower', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'room', 'had', 'sleep', 'beach', 'mother', 'showering', 'daughter', 'returns', 'room', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'bikini', 'having', 'just', 'come', 'beach', 'laying', 'out', 'clothes', 'going', 'change', 'when', 'ex', 'bathroom', 'wrapped', 'towel', 'what', 'doing', 'there', 'Showering', 'want', 'join', 'as', 'far', 'more', 'one', 'romance', 'storyline', 'will', 'say', 'outcome', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'had', 'expected', 'usually', 'get', 'what', 'expect', 'chick', 'flicks.As', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'OK', 'what', 'not', 'come', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
