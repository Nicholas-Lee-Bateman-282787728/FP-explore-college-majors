323793,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,6302636779,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 4]","`The Nun's Story' is an engaging tale about an aspiring nun who wishes to serve in the missions of the Belgian Congo. Multi-faceted Audrey Hepburn makes the story absorbing enough with her excellent performance as Sister Burt.  There's the drama of the Congo, World War II is breaking out in Europe, and her vocation is on the line, but mainly we care about her own development.The inner conflict is written all over Hepburn's face as she grapples with self-will. Obedience being the hardest vow, she, nevertheless, finds perfectionism, a manifestation of pride, her biggest stumbling block. Having a low tolerance for her own failures, she meets into agnostic-skeptic Dr. Fortunati played with colorful zest by Peter Finch. He challenges her motivation and makes her contemplate ""a change of habit"" to sport another movie's title. Then, with war beginning in Europe, she struggles with the community's edict to remain nuetral.Constrasting Hepburn's role in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' she really demonstrates a conflicted, resolute, yet fragile nun with great skill. Hepburn is the centerpiece because even with a good story, she makes us care deeply about her character. The movie makers painstakingly put together a movie that really understood the religious aspects and got it right. Absorbing and genuine, `The Nun's Story' makes the movie a must-see mission.",4,Stumbling Perfectionist in a Fractured World,1175817600,"04 6, 2007",2007,1362,"['Nun', 'Story', 'engaging', 'tale', 'aspiring', 'nun', 'who', 'serve', 'missions', 'Belgian', 'Congo', 'Multi-faceted', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'story', 'absorbing', 'enough', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Sister', 'Burt', 'drama', 'Congo', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'breaking', 'out', 'Europe', 'vocation', 'line', 'mainly', 'care', 'own', 'development.The', 'inner', 'conflict', 'written', 'Hepburn', 'face', 'self-will', 'Obedience', 'being', 'hardest', 'vow', 'nevertheless', 'perfectionism', 'manifestation', 'pride', 'biggest', 'stumbling', 'block', 'Having', 'low', 'tolerance', 'own', 'failures', 'agnostic-skeptic', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'played', 'colorful', 'zest', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'motivation', 'contemplate', 'change', 'habit', 'sport', 'movie', 'title', 'Then', 'war', 'beginning', 'Europe', 'community', 'edict', 'remain', 'nuetral.Constrasting', 'Hepburn', 'role', ""'Breakfast"", 'Tiffany', 'really', 'conflicted', 'resolute', 'yet', 'fragile', 'nun', 'great', 'skill', 'Hepburn', 'centerpiece', 'even', 'good', 'story', 'care', 'deeply', 'character', 'movie', 'makers', 'painstakingly', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'really', 'understood', 'religious', 'aspects', 'got', 'right', 'Absorbing', 'genuine', 'Nun', 'Story', 'movie', 'must-see', 'mission']",N/A

323796,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302636779,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There are few films that can say so much with so little; but `The Nun's Story' does just that.  In a simple and none-to-evasive premise the film tackles the weighty subject of faith and all its variables but never feels heavy handed or overly stuffed.  In fact, despite its two-hour-plus running time, the film has a very breezy feel to it; relaxed and nicely paced and totally engaging.The film tells the story of young Gabrielle van der Mal who desires to become a nursing nun in the Congo.  She pursues her passion yet is met with setbacks, both inside the convent but also within herself.  She taps into something every intimate; very internal that causes her to question whether this course was the right course for her.  She questions whether this life of a nun, no matter how important to her, is really a life she can fully commit to.Can she fully give herself over, even when she doesn't fully agree?Like I mentioned, the plot is quite simple.  Gabrielle is accepted into the nunhood (her new name being Sister Luke) and eventually makes her way to her desired destination; the Congo.  She becomes nurse to an unbelieving Doctor (played by Peter Finch) and it is under his thumb that she begins to doubt herself to a fuller extent.Director Fred Zennemann tackles this subject with a beautiful delicacy that really elevates the film, tapping into that genuine and intimate place that Gabrielle finds herself.  We are given a very real look at the conflicting emotions of those devoted in faith and it asks some very weighty questions and delivers a very personal answer.  Zennemann is matched all the way by his stars, Hepburn especially.  Audrey (my favorite Hepburn) is stunning as Gabrielle.  She captures, sometimes without even a word, this woman's inner demons.  She manages to make her a three dimensional, real person to us, complete with flaws and quirks and very genuine concerns.  Peter Finch is in fine form as Dr. Fortunati, the man who helps bolster in Gabrielle the courage to question her own aspirations, and Edith Evans (Dame Edith Evans) is stunning as the Reverend Mother Emmanuel, a woman so devoted to her faith that she sparks controversy within her actions.`The Nun's Story' is not simply a film for the religious.  This is a film for everyone.  Don't allow the subject matter to be off putting, for the film is developed in a way that will cause no discomfort or offence.  This is a movie that handles its weighty matter with grace and serenity; delivering an honest portrait while remaining easy to swallow.  With some stunning performances and some poignant material, `The Nun's Story' remains easily one of the most important films of the 50's.",5,Soft and subtle yet resoundingly powerful...,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,2680,"['are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'Nun', 'Story', 'just', 'simple', 'none-to-evasive', 'premise', 'film', 'weighty', 'subject', 'faith', 'variables', 'never', 'feels', 'heavy', 'handed', 'overly', 'stuffed', 'fact', 'two-hour-plus', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'very', 'breezy', 'feel', 'relaxed', 'nicely', 'paced', 'totally', 'engaging.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'Gabrielle', 'van', 'der', 'Mal', 'who', 'become', 'nursing', 'nun', 'Congo', 'passion', 'yet', 'met', 'setbacks', 'convent', 'also', 'something', 'intimate', 'very', 'internal', 'question', 'course', 'was', 'right', 'course', 'questions', 'life', 'nun', 'matter', 'how', 'important', 'really', 'life', 'can', 'fully', 'commit', 'fully', 'give', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'fully', 'agree', 'mentioned', 'plot', 'quite', 'simple', 'Gabrielle', 'accepted', 'nunhood', 'new', 'name', 'being', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'eventually', 'way', 'desired', 'destination', 'Congo', 'nurse', 'unbelieving', 'Doctor', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'thumb', 'doubt', 'fuller', 'extent.Director', 'Fred', 'Zennemann', 'subject', 'beautiful', 'delicacy', 'really', 'film', 'tapping', 'genuine', 'intimate', 'place', 'Gabrielle', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'real', 'look', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'devoted', 'faith', 'very', 'weighty', 'questions', 'delivers', 'very', 'personal', 'answer', 'Zennemann', 'matched', 'way', 'stars', 'Hepburn', 'especially', 'Audrey', 'favorite', 'Hepburn', 'stunning', 'Gabrielle', 'sometimes', 'even', 'word', 'woman', 'inner', 'demons', 'make', 'three', 'dimensional', 'real', 'person', 'complete', 'flaws', 'quirks', 'very', 'genuine', 'concerns', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'fine', 'form', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'man', 'who', 'bolster', 'Gabrielle', 'courage', 'question', 'own', 'aspirations', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'Dame', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'stunning', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'Emmanuel', 'woman', 'so', 'devoted', 'faith', 'controversy', 'actions.', 'Nun', 'Story', 'not', 'simply', 'film', 'religious', 'film', 'everyone', 'Do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'subject', 'matter', 'be', 'off', 'putting', 'film', 'developed', 'way', 'will', 'cause', 'discomfort', 'offence', 'movie', 'weighty', 'matter', 'grace', 'serenity', 'delivering', 'honest', 'portrait', 'remaining', 'easy', 'swallow', 'stunning', 'performances', 'poignant', 'material', 'Nun', 'Story', 'remains', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'films', '50']",N/A
323797,AB4F6UHL20U95,6302636779,Anne Rice,"[6, 6]","Perhaps no film I've ever seen has so well captured the essence of the Roman Catholic Church before Vatican II. This is a simple and perfectly sustained work of art about the spiritual struggle of one soul who seeks to be a nun and a nurse in a semi-cloistered convent before and during World War II.  It is a lense through which one can see tne entire religion and its deepest values: complete dedication to Our Lord Jesus Christ, complete love of neighbor and of enemy, complete abandon to the will and the way of Christ.  Watching the film tonight, I can hardly believe that it was made in 1959, even though I've watched it many times over the years.  It is timeless in its power.  For Catholic and non-Catholic, it provides profound religious truths.  It transcends its subject matter and asks of the viewer: if you believe in Him, what are you doing for Him?

323798,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,6302636779,Artist & Author,"[6, 9]","The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it should be taken as a historical piece and not indicative of the life of many if not most nuns today.  Yes, there are still cloistered nuns that follow the strict rules of silence depicted here.  However, for example, the hospital nun who visited my mother as she was dying lived in her own apartment in town, didn't wear a habit, and seemed to me to be much more interested in the people she was serving than in following onerous rules of piety.That said, 'The Nun's Story' certainly comes in among the 1000 best movie ever made.  It is a very powerful drama, with flawless performances by the main characters.  In most ways, it fairly accurately depicts the pre Vatican II Catholic Church.  Since Vatican II, a lot has changed, and this change is spotlighted by this film when comparing Sister Luke's life with that of most nuns today.In a lot of ways, Sister Luke's convent was similar to the Pharisees so vividly depicted in Scripture.  They were so concerned with following every letter of the Law that they failed to perceive and serve the real, everyday needs of the people.  They were so focused on serving God that they forgot that Jesus said that 'if you have done it to the least of these (people), you have done it to Me.'  This is not to suggest in any way that the sisters were not really sincere in their desire to serve God; indeed, their desire, and the sacrifices they willing made, needs to be admired.I think Sister Luke would have made it as a nun today.  Of course there are still rules and disciplines that need to be observed.  But, as Jesus told the Pharisees, if a cow is stuck in a pit on the Sabbath, you forget the rules about only resting on the Sabbath and help the distressed cow.  If Jesus thought that about a cow, how much more so can the 'rules' be broken to serve another human being in distress?It is purely this dichotomy that distressed Sister Luke so much that he eventually had to leave the convent.  She was there to serve the needs of people, hurting people, not to follow endless rules to the letter.  She complained that the Convent expected that a sister counseling a lady who, for example, really needed comforting as she was dying, had to forsake the patient at the tone of the bell tolling silence.  Sister Luke couldn't reconcile the emotional affliction of that woman with the perceived benefits of silent meditation.The whole movie is full of conflicts like this.  At one point. Sister Luke, an outstanding science student was asked to fail an exam so as to not appear to be superior to another, less talented nun in the same course.  What the Mother Superior didn't seem to realize was that for Sister Luke to give a false, wrong answer on the final exam, would make her into a liar.  As one is watching this movie, they would do well to look for situations such as these and ask himself what God, through the lens of today's Catholic catechism, would expect her to do.  Protestants should ask themselves the same things through their doctrines.Knowing that everyone in religious life in this movie was sincerely trying to serve God in their best way possible, one can see the makings of great drama.  The big question addressed by 'The Nun's Story' is which way is the right way?  Or, maybe, different people need different ways of serving God, so both are right?  Perhaps, like Sister Luke, you'll want to pray about it.

323806,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6302636779,Classic film buff,"[5, 5]","Quite possibly ""The Nun's Story"" is the best film about organized religion to come out of Hollywood, in the this case a nun in the Roman Catholic Church. It neither proselytizes nor judges; Sister Luke's spiritual journey unwinds as it happened, allowing the audience to form their own conclusions.  This is based on the true-life story of an actual former Belgian nun Marie-Louise Habets, who became friends with author Kathryn Hulme when they were both working together in a charitable organization for displaced persons in the wake of World War II.  Ms. Hulme novelized what Ms. Habets had told her about her life, but the basic facts are true, in the beautifully written best seller ""The Nun's Story.""  Even though, the book had been a blockbuster in sales, and the talented and successful director Fred Zinnemann had bought the screen rights, at first no Hollywood studio would touch it, the rationale being who wants to see a film about how to become a nun?  This changed when Audrey Hepburn, agreed to play Sister Luke, suddenly every studio wanted the property, with Warner Brothers winning the prize.  What a difference having one of the biggest stars in movies on board will do!The film details with compassion and a sense of wonder, the story of Sister Luke, born Gabrielle Van der Mal, the daughter of an eminent surgeon, who is herself gifted in medicine, but mistakes her vocation for the religious order of nursing nuns she joins.  The movie is book ended with her first and last days in the religious life.  In between, we see the rigorous process a young woman used to undergo in the novitiate, the stepping-stones beginning as postulant, then novice, before taking final vows as a professed nun.  This is most likely a time capsule because I don't believe most Roman Catholic orders of nuns these days would go through such a tough, exacting, exhaustive training.  As the Superior General of the order, Reverend Mother Emmanuel (Dame Edith Evans) warns Gabrielle's class of postulants, "" Dear Children, It is not easy to be a nun...in a way it is a life against nature.""  As we view the sometimes-severe, repressive tasks and rules designed to remove the candidates from the outer world into a closer spiritual communion with Christ, we marvel at the sheer courage, strength, discipline and determination of those who complete their novitiate and become professed nuns.  Despite her misgivings that she in not perfected in the Holy Rule of her order, Gabrielle is professed in her vows, and is now rechristened Sister Luke.  Her religious life after her profession, will take her first to a mental sanitarium in her native Belgium, where she is almost killed by a deranged patient.  She realizes her ambition to be sent to the Belgian Congo where she assists in surgery to a brilliant agnostic doctor in a hospital run by her order.  Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, she is sent back to Belgium, for what is supposed to be a temporary stay, but the war interferes, and she is posted to a hospital on the Dutch border for the duration.  The one obstacle that continues from her beginning as a postulant and threads through her religious life is total obedience to what is perceived to be the will of God as exemplified by the Holy Rule of her order.  Ultimately this is to be her fatal flaw in her life as a nun, she cannot blindly obey without question, and this will finally defeat her, and cause to leave the order but not the Church.No other actress could have portrayed Sister Luke as well as Audrey Hepburn.  She is simply magnificent, not a wrong note is struck.  This performance was the realization of the acting promise shown in her earlier films, it is her finest, truest portrait, in which she becomes an actress of the first rank.  There is no coasting here on her considerable charm, she must deliver the goods; she does and then some.  The Givenchy outfits are replaced by the austere, simple black and white habits in which she looks just as breathtaking, the inner beauty shining through.  The soul of Sister Luke is illuminated on her countenance through the peaks and valleys that document her religious life; her torturous, heart wrenching inner struggle with her vocation in the last portion of the film is etched in the pain of the dark circled eyes in the thin, wan face.  Both her son Sean Ferrer, and her companion Rob Wolders have said this film holds a special place in their hearts as the character had many similarities to Ms. Hepburn.  Interesting to note how much the actual Marie-Louise Habets and Audrey Hepburn had in common, both Belgian born, both worked for the resistance in World War II, Ms. Habets had nursed Ms. Hepburn through a back injury sustained on her next film, and finally and most importantly both did exemplary charitable work for the African natives.  This breakthrough performance so totally different from anything she'd attempted before should have won Ms. Hepburn her second Oscar, it didn't, although she did receive a nomination and deservedly won her second NY Film Critics Award as Best Actress and a British Academy Award for Best Actress.An ensemble of renowned actresses augment and support her, in addition to Dame Edith Evans as the regal Reverend Mother Emmanuel, there is Dame Peggy Ashcroft as Mother Mathilde, Sister's Luke's superior in the Congo, and in lesser roles Mildred Dunnock, Beatrice Straight, Patricia Collinge, Margaret Phillips, Barbara O'Neil, Ruth White and in a small but harrowing cameo Colleen Dewhurst in her motion picture debut.  Peter Finch gives a vital, forceful performance as Doctor Fortunati, the Congo surgeon, who will not let his fierce admiration for Sister Luke prevent him from trying to make her to face the truth about her fitness to be the nun her order expects her to be.  As Doctor Van der Mal, Sister Luke's father, Dean Jagger brings poignancy and an unspoken yearning in losing this favorite child with her gift for medicine, so like him in many ways, to the convent.Director Fred Zinnemann does an extraordinary job handling a controversial situation the story of a nun leaving the convent with superb tact and delicacy.  He had mentioned in an interview about this film that the struggle of the individual with his conscience was always a subject that continued to attract him, he would continue his cinematic variations on this theme with ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""Julia"".  The screenplay by dramatist Robert Anderson, is literate and eloquent, one of the best-realized adaptations of a famous novel, completely capturing it's essence.  Franz Waxman's musical score is powerful and majestic complementing the action on the screen, but appropriately silent in the final absorbing minutes, a first for a Warner's Brothers film!  The cinematographer Franz Planer uses a somber palette of subdued, muted shades for the scenes in Belgium, primarily blacks, whites, grays and pale blues, when the story shifts to Africa, the vivid, blazing, tropical colors bursting onscreen are almost overwhelming to the viewer.  All of these factors blend together perfectly to create a soaring work of film art. What's gratifying to report is that apparently at the time, film audiences DID want to see a film about becoming a nun, since this was the top grossing Warner Brother's film of 1959, and was rewarded with eight Oscar nominations,including Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. After viewing this film, if you haven't already go back and read the original book, it will add to your appreciation.For the final word, let's hear from the woman who inspired it all, Marie-Louise Habets, who made these comments after the third time she had viewed the film. ""I'm never going to see it again, because if I do I'm going to run right back to the convent...I could just sit there and cry my eyes out, not with regret or anything, but because of the beauty of it.""",5,"""Incandescent Audrey Hepburn in an exquisite tapestry of the religious life""",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,7917,"['Quite', 'possibly', 'Nun', 'Story', 'best', 'film', 'organized',

It details with wonderful accuracy the plight of a woman caught in an order of nuns that asks her to be a nurse and cloistered nun all in one. The schizo life-style does not suit Audrey Hepburn who suffers to live it, from Belgium to the Belgian Congo and back to the ravages of WW II. She must make a decision weather to aid the allies or stay in the convent and be neutral and therfore somewhat conspirstorial; it all couched under the vow of obedience which haunts her from the very start, acting as a metaphor for individual will vs. institutional Church. For the time this was produced, the themes and the ending are daring indeed. The Catholic Church hated this film but could not have it cut or condemned because it was a blockbuster in one week.On the cutting edge of Vatican II this story, beginning in the 20's, ending in ww II, is quite prophetic. Audrey Hepburn has more than just convent ways..she is a nun, with a habit that makes her look like a true nun. A stunning performance and an academy award winning one, but she did not get it. In any case, get The Nun's Story and learn about religious life in the Catholic Church before it disappeared. By the way, where is the lbx DVD of this film????The DVD is out and the opening  logo, the Warner Bros shield, is missing as are the bells, which chime in again at the dramatic conclusion. What a cover for this DVD! It's that awful German poster from years ago.

Any time I can catch this movie I do, the story never grows old and Sister Lukes's struggles seem relevant today.  The really poingnant thing about the movie is seeing the naive earnestness of the Colonials in Africa and knowing what fate they will meet 25 years later when the natives rise up and destroy them.Audrey Hepburn is incredible as a nun, she does such a great job conveying Sister Luke's stubborn resolve not to be completely cowed by the convent &amp; it's rules.

323822,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302636779,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","Capturing one's spiritual crisis hardly sounds like the ideal cinematic subject, but master director Fred Zinnemann does an unparalleled job of dramatizing the inner turmoil and the quest for serenity and immaculate devotion in the life of a Belgian novice in the 1930's. This is no small feat as so much of the story has to do with evoking what is essentially a journey of introspection in this 1959 classic. Fortunately, Audrey Hepburn is luminous as the novice, Sister Luke, who begins the movie as Gabrielle (""Gaby"") van der Mal, the daughter of a notable surgeon, who dreams of going to the Congo as a nurse for the natives. Proving she doesn't need Givenchy couture or an adoring leading man to complete her, Hepburn brings her character to shimmering life in a fully dimensional performance. It also helps that Robert Anderson has written an impressive screenplay based on Kathryn Hulme's expansive novel based on a friend who was indeed a Belgian nurse and a former nun.The story has three discrete parts. The first focuses on Gaby's induction into the Catholic order and the exacting transition she makes from postulant to novice. What strikes me most about this part of the movie is not so much the deeper spirituality at the foundation of the training but the near cult-like behavior demanded of the postulants. It's an impressive rite of passage with particularly effective turns by Mildred Dunnock as the humorless Mother of Postulants and especially Edith Evans as the Reverend Mother, a figure concurrently maternal and fearsome. The newly named Sister Luke is assigned to the mental ward of a Belgian asylum where she experiences an episode of terror with a young Colleen Dewhurst as a combative schizophrenic patient.The film's second section has Sister Luke fulfilling her dream to go to the Congo but only to treat the European patients at a white hospital. Still, she makes an impression on the native population as well as Dr. Fortunati, a bellowing atheist and brilliant surgeon who is soon impressed by Sister Luke's medical skills. The two bond, and there is an unspoken feeling of romance, especially during her bout with tuberculosis. However, her skills demand her to go back to Belgium now on the verge of WWII. The third and last part of the movie has Sister Luke back at the convent and struggling with her vows, especially as the Nazis invade and personal tragedy occurs. Zinnemann smartly avoids wartime action shots and lets the nuns recite news headlines as a means of visualizing the carnage surrounding the order. The film ends with an extremely moving, wordless sequence of Sister Luke deciding her fate.As a Belgian who suffered through WWII, Hepburn has an obvious affinity with Gaby/Sister Luke, and even covered head to toe by her habit, she lets her beautiful face express a full range of emotions. Peter Finch plays Dr. Fortunati with convincing swagger, and a gallery of fine character actresses make strong impressions despite the constrictions of their habits. In the Congo sequence, Peggy Ashcroft is a lively presence as Mother Mathilde, and Dorothy Alison makes the optimism of Sister Aurelie palpable and ultimately poignant. Dean Jagger plays the small role of Gaby's father with his requisite paternal appeal. Franz Planer's cinematography is first-rate, especially the National Geographic-like scenes in the Congo, and Franz Waxman does his usual sterling work on the stentorian music score. The new 2006 DVD only offers the original trailer as an extra, a shame since the film is so accomplished in many ways.",5,A Luminous Hepburn Guided by a Masterful Zinnemann Makes an Introspective Journey Cinematic,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",2006,3563,"['Capturing', 'one', 'spiritual', 'crisis', 'hardly', 'ideal', 'cinematic', 'subject', 'master', 'director', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'unparalleled', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'quest', 'serenity', 'immaculate', 'devotion', 'life', 'Belgian', 'novice', '1930', 'small', 'feat', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'do', 'evoking', 'what', 'essentially', 'journey', 'introspection', '1959', 'classic', 'Fortunately', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'luminous', 'novice', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'who', 'movie', 'Gabrielle', 'Gaby', 'van', 'der', 'Mal', 'daughter', 'notable', 'surgeon', 'who', 'going', 'Congo', 'nurse', 'natives', 'Proving', ""n't"", 'need', 'Givenchy', 'couture', 'adoring', 'leading', 'man', 'complete', 'Hepburn', 'character', 'shimmering', 'life', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'performance', 'also', 'Robert', 'Anderson', 'written', 'impressive', 'screenplay', 'based', 'Kathryn', 'Hulme', 'expansive', 'novel', 'based', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'indeed', 'Belgian', 'nurse', 'former', 'nun.The', 'story', 'three', 'discrete', 'parts', 'first', 'Gaby', 'induction', 'Catholic', 'order', 'exacting', 'transition', 'postulant', 'novice', 'What', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'spirituality', 'foundation', 'training', 'near', 'cult-like', 'behavior', 'demanded', 'postulants', 'impressive', 'rite', 'passage', 'particularly', 'effective', 'turns', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'humorless', 'Mother', 'Postulants', 'especially', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'figure', 'concurrently', 'maternal', 'fearsome', 'newly', 'named', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'assigned', 'mental', 'ward', 'Belgian', 'asylum', 'where', 'episode', 'terror', 'young', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'combative', 'schizophrenic', 'patient.The', 'film', 'second', 'section', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'fulfilling', 'dream', 'go', 'Congo', 'only', 'treat', 'European', 'patients', 'white', 'hospital', 'Still', 'impression', 'native', 'population', 'as', 'well', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'bellowing', 'atheist', 'brilliant', 'surgeon', 'who', 'soon', 'impressed', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'medical', 'skills', 'two', 'bond', 'unspoken', 'feeling', 'romance', 'especially', 'bout', 'tuberculosis', 'However', 'skills', 'demand', 'go', 'back', 'Belgium', 'now', 'verge', 'WWII', 'third', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'back', 'convent', 'struggling', 'vows', 'especially', 'Nazis', 'invade', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'occurs', 'Zinnemann', 'smartly', 'wartime', 'action', 'shots', 'nuns', 'recite', 'news', 'headlines', 'means', 'visualizing', 'carnage', 'surrounding', 'order', 'film', 'extremely', 'moving', 'wordless', 'sequence', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'deciding', 'fate.As', 'Belgian', 'who', 'suffered', 'WWII', 'Hepburn', 'obvious', 'affinity', 'Gaby/Sister', 'Luke', 'even', 'covered', 'head', 'toe', 'habit', 'beautiful', 'face', 'express', 'full', 'range', 'emotions', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'convincing', 'swagger', 'gallery', 'fine', 'character', 'actresses', 'make', 'strong', 'impressions', 'constrictions', 'habits', 'Congo', 'sequence', 'Peggy', 'Ashcroft', 'lively', 'presence', 'Mother', 'Mathilde', 'Dorothy', 'Alison', 'optimism', 'Sister', 'Aurelie', 'palpable', 'ultimately', 'poignant', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'small', 'role', 'Gaby', 'father', 'requisite', 'paternal', 'appeal', 'Franz', 'Planer', 'cinematography', 'first-rate', 'especially', 'National', 'Geographic-like', 'scenes', 'Congo', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'usual', 'sterling', 'work', 'stentorian', 'music', 'score', 'new', '2006', 'DVD', 'only', 'original', 'trailer', 'extra', 'shame', 'film', 'so', 'accomplished', 'many', 'ways']",N/A

The movie is set in the years prior to and during WWII, and it was made in 1959. Most of the movie takes place in Belgium, but about a fifth of the movie is set in the Belgian Congo (later Zaire, now Congo again), where Sister Luke is sent to work as a nurse in a hospital -- her desired assignment all along, but one that she had to wait for. There she works with a brillant but difficult doctor (Peter Finch) who has his own demons to battle.  Their strained relationship is the emotional crux of the story.It is this portion of the movie that may be of interest to Africanists. The scenes set in Congo were filmed there, evidently in Kisangani. There is something of a documentary quality to much of this part of the film: Congolese people at work and play, life around a missionary hospital, colonial officials and uniformed native soldiers, colonial architecture, etc. It is really a sort of window on the past, and while the movie is not about the Belgian Congo, it does give a good idea of what part of the Belgian Congo looked like, and what life was like for the urban inhabitants in the Belgian Congo.

323826,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,6302636779,"Elizabeth G. Melillo ""gloriana""","[84, 88]","The underlying themes of this film, most unfortunately, can be missed today, when the young cannot remember anything like the sort of nuns depicted (though, admittedly, presented here in a style melodramatic for any age), and the ""life against nature"" could be taken as having elements that would not have been considered when it was produced. As well, and as any Amazon list mania visitor can see, Audrey Hepburn is ""favourite actress"" of so many that the viewer can become too wrapped up in it's being a film featuring her that the overall messages become blurred.The main character, Sister Luke, is brilliantly portrayed by Audrey Hepburn, who captures, in expression particularly, the intense struggle of one whose dedication is enormous, but (to borrow the words of Dr Fortunati) cannot ""fit the mould."" In an era when nuns were not to admit, even to themselves, that professional achievement played any part in their choice of convent life, yet where (it is apparent) one who was not a nun had no chance for such positions as nursing supervisor in the Congo, the conflict depicted is absorbingly intense. Sister Luke is a brilliant and extremely devoted nurse, yet, while her faith is clear, she obviously is one who is accepting the (for her, extraordinary) burdens of vowed life for the sake of the nursing opportunities.From the beginning, the young nun who expresses her personal motto as ""all or nothing"" is in conflict with the obedience demanded by her Order's Rule, and specific practise of which, as some of the conversations, particularly those with the Abbess, bring forth, seem much at odds with the demands of the apostolic work (for example, having to observe silence when one is working a night shift in a hospital.) The viewer can see the sense of Sister Luke's position, and Audrey Hepburn's depiction of Sister Luke as gradually deteriorating with the inner conflict is superb. It is notable that Sister Luke, despite having achieved her desired goal of the Congo assignment, and being in a far less rigid atmosphere than elsewhere, feels the struggle most keenly after facing that there is no point where, as she'd hoped, obedience becomes natural.The depiction of convent life may not be far from the practise of some Orders in that era, but the action does cross the border into sheer melodrama. Where the same scenes exist in the book (which was based on a true story), some of them make less sense in the film version because details the reader would have known are eliminated. For example, in the original, Sister Luke is assigned to the mental sanitorium because she is the only Sister in transit with a diploma in psychiatric nursing, where the film, with its dramatic music as she receives word of the transfer, makes it appear that she is sent there as punishment for disobeying the ludicrous suggestion that she ""fail her exams to shows humility."" As well, with no reference to the experience in psychiatric nursing, the film's Sister Luke seems a naive young nurse left all alone in the ward with the dangerous patients, and whose opening the ""Archangel's"" padded cell was an act of misguided ignorance. Her castigating herself for her pride and disobedience seems cruel in the film, where, in the book, the dangerous ""heroism"" is indeed proud and reckless, since she had the background to know the possible consequences.The scenery, in both the Belgian and Congo sequences, is splendidly captured and has a powerful impact. One unexpectedly poignant feature is in seeing the depiction of the last years of the Belgian Congo, when both church and state were apparently strong. When Sister Luke's professor of tropical medicines speaks of how the Congo she would see in 1930 was far different from what he found 20 years earlier, one is reminded of how the security the colonials imagined they had then would be destroyed within a few decades.Overall, the outstanding cast and powerful cinematography (an example of the latter being the actions of Gabrielle's removing her jewellery on her entrance days, then leaving her ring and crucifix before she exits the convent), and a musical score which can occasionally be obtrusive but is generally effective, combine to give an excellent depiction of conflict -

Based on the true story of former nun Marie Louise Habets, made in Rome, Belgium and the Congo jungles, the film follows Audrey Hepburn's Gabrielle Van Der Mal/Sister Luke from its early sequences of the pious cloistered life behind the convent walls, through harrowing scenes in a mental asylum, to her dream assignment in the missionary Congo hospital, and back to Europe when World War II had broken out and the nuns were forbidden by the order to take sides. ""The Nun's  Story"" is magnificent and touching. It is excellent in every department, but its brightest star is Audrey Hepburn who carries the film effortlessly in every scene as strong-willed, passionate, and devoted Gabrielle/Sister Luke. This story of her ultimate rebellion against vows of obedience versus her calling as nurse and supporting the resistance movement in Belgium torn by war was deservingly one of the big box-office hits of the 50s.Fred Zinneman never denied or was ashamed of being a Hollywood director, ""I will always think of myself as a Hollywood director, not only because I grew up in the American film industry, but also because I believe in making films that will please a mass audience, and not just in making films that express my own personality or ideas.

Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 4]","Loosely based on the life Marie Louise-Habets, THE NUN'S STORY by Kathryn Hulme was a best-selling novel of 1956, but it drew little interest from the film industry until director Fred Zinnemann brought the project to Audrey Hepburn's attention.  The result was a bidding war for the project with Warner Bro.s the winner, and although the studio feared the subject would be too esoteric for most audiences, THE NUN'S STORY not only picked up numerous Academy Award nominations, it was among the most financially successful films of 1959--and one of Audrey Hepburn's greatest box office successes.The story concerns Gabrielle van der Mal, the daughter of a noted Belgian surgeon, who enters a convent with what she believes to be a true calling from God and in the hope that her medical experience and skills will be of use to the church.  Now known as Sister Luke, she is xcited by an assignment to the Belgian Congo, she is disappointed when she finds her assignment is to a European hospital instead of a native hospital.  With passing time--and under the possibly negative influence of Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch)--she begins to place her calling as a nurse before her calling to the church, and as such she begins to question whether she had a true calling as a nun.  While in the Congo she contracts tuberculosis, and although she recovers she is returned to Beglium, where she finds her place in the convent increasingly unteneble, and with the onset of World War II she finds she cannot maintain the neutrality the church demands.  Significantly torn, she elects to leave the convent, and in a powerfully evocative scene does this, walking away into an unknown future and an unknown fate.Although some may find it a bit too long, THE NUN'S STORY is among the most visually beautiful films of its era, filmed on location in the Congo and in Europe, flawlessly costumed, perfectly filmed.  The direction is subtle, and each performance shines in a truly memorable cast that includes Peggy Ashcroft, Patricia Collinge, Colleen Dewhurst, Mildred Dunnock, Edith Evans, Dean Jagger, Barbara O'Neill, and Beatrice Straight--as well as the aforementioned Peter Finch, who adds a certain sexual tension to the mix.  But the focus is on Audrey Hepburn, and if any film proves that Hepburn was not just an actress but an artist, it is THE NUN'S STORY.  She so beautifully captures Sister Luke's spiritual tug of war.  At the film's conclusion one feels that Sister Luke has demanded too much of herself, and--unable to acheive spiritual perfection--has almost deliberately faultered into a more worldly point of view.  What ever the interpretation made, THE NUN'S STORY is brilliant, start to finish, and not to be missed.

I bought this movie because I am an Audrey Hepburn fan and read the book after seeing the movie. I didn't really care for the book. It was really hard to read, I think because of the lack of dialogue. Almost the entire thing was narrative and the nun spent pretty much the entire book thinking about how bad she was (which the Catholic Church put into her head), and how she just couldn't obey, which was depressing. The movie was pretty similar, but I enjoyed it.I quit being Catholic ages ago, for many reasons that do not belong in an Amazon review. But one was the guilt trips that the Church shoves down your throat. But boy, was it worse back then, and especially for nuns. They couldn't so much as take a drink of water between meals without permission! (I wondered what gave some of them the power to give that permission, but they never addressed that.) They couldn't talk after hours. They weren't allowed to keep photos of their family. They weren't allowed to make friends with their fellow nuns. They weren't allowed to be proud of anything they had accomplished. They had to get all their hair chopped off (I think they weren't allowed to be attractive). They weren't allowed to look in mirrors. They weren't even allowed to mourn when a fellow nun died! Worse, when they commit these horrible sins, they have to lie on their stomachs and announce how fallible they are in front of their fellow nuns. The rest of the world is off lying and stealing and eating cake and they have to feel incredibly guilty for drinking water! I know nuns don't have any such requirements these days, but the Catholic Church hasn't much escaped from the fear factor and guilt thing. A little progress, maybe.As a movie, and a piece of entertainment, I really liked The Nun's Story. Bad, chopped off hair could not hide Audrey Hepburn's beauty (not that you can tell nuns have hair).

323840,A1345VRK5MYG7,6302636779,James L.,"[15, 15]","In a truly great performance, Audrey Hepburn stars as Gabrielle (and later, Sister Luke), a young Belgian girl and daughter of a famous surgeon, who enters the convent with the ultimate dream of working as a nurse in the Belgian Congo.  From the outset, Hepburn has difficulty working within the vow of obedience, and it becomes a daily struggle to remain faithful to her vow.  The struggle becomes more pronounced in the Congo when working with Peter Finch, a brilliant surgeon who sees her conflict but is not a believer.  Hepburn and Finch have a relationship that is one of the highlights of this film.  The Nun's Story is not an action packed feature, but rather a character study about coming to grips with one's faith, character, and true self.  Hepburn does a terrific job of portraying Sister Luke's conflicts, all the more difficult given the emotional restraint she must show in the role of a nun. The supporting cast of film veterans adds to the excellence of the acting.  I also enjoyed the insight into the training and demands placed on nuns.

323845,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6302636779,JLind555,"[252, 267]","""The Nun's Story"" is probably Audrey Hepburn's best film and by far the one which shows to best effect her enormous acting talent.  It is the autobiographical tale of Sister Luke, a very young Belgian nun, who enters the convent at age 17 for specifically the wrong reason: her doctor father refuses to let her marry the young man she loves because there is insanity in his family background.  She won't admit to him, as she is too young to admit it to herself, that her underlying reason in entering the convent was to spite her father, who believes women have a duty to marry and have children, but he is powerless to oppose her in this; he can prevent her from marrying her fiance, but who is he to defy God?  Sister Luke, as played by Hepburn, wins us over instantly: she's generous, open-hearted, all or nothing, trying and failing and trying again, expecting too much of herself, wanting to fit in to the routine of her cloister, but feeling stifled by its constraints.  The atmosphere of the convent is brought so vividly to life that we feel the conflicts pulling her in opposite directions: the peace and serenity that are embodied in the Reverend Mother Emmanuel (Edith Evans is so great in this role that she doesn't seem to be acting at all), and the incessant weight of seemingly arbitrary and nonsensical rules and regulations that attempt to crush all individuality and spontaneity.  The pivotal conflict arises in the first half of the movie, when Sister Luke is asked by her Mother Superior to fail a qualifying examination for a nursing post in the Congo so that a less gifted nun can have her place, and Sister Luke has to make a choice: her failure will be a gift from God, but her success in the examination will win her a position in the Congolese hospital where her talents can be most fully utilized.  And this is where Sister Luke has to face her inner dilemma: the convent, with all its rules and regulations, hasn't managed to crush her individuality -- she is too much her own person to let go of herself.It is in the Congo that Sister Luke comes into her own.  She falls in love with the country and its people as soon as she steps off the boat.  She is sent to the European hospital to assist Dr. Fortunati, a brilliant, cynical surgeon who immediately sees through Sister Luke and understands her better than she understands herself.  The meeting of minds between these two is awesome to watch and in itself makes the movie worth seeing.  Dr. Fortunati, brilliantly played by Peter Finch, tells Sister Luke time and again that she will never be the kind of nun her convent expects her to be.  The sexual tension between the two is evident but downplayed; Dr. Fortunati knows it's impossible and Sister Luke simply refuses to acknowledge it.  The climax comes when Sister Luke is ordered back to the mother house in Belgium, and we suspect that Dr. Fortunati may have had a hand in it, to force her to face up to the fact that she is more nurse than nun.The year is 1939 and World War II is about to begin.  Sister Luke, chafing at the constraints of the mother house, is drawn into the war in ways her convent never imagined or would sanction.  She assists a young lay nurse, who looks up to her as a role model, to work for the Resistance.  She is glad when a German woman dies in the convent hospital.  And she is finally forced to see inside herself and realize that while she may be able to accept chastity and poverty, obedience is impossible.  At this point Sister Luke realizes she can no longer go on living a lie.  The scenes in which her confessor and Reverend Mother Emmanuel attempt to dissuade her from leaving the convent are the most powerful in the film.  ""You joined the convent to be a nun, not a nurse"", remonstrates Reverend Mother.  But this is precisely where she's wrong; Sister Luke is much more a nurse than she will ever be a nun.  After 17 years at war with herself, Sister Luke signs the papers severing her from her convent, and goes out into the world.Hepburn's performance in a role which demands so much from her is incredible; we not only feel but share all her conflict and inner pain.  There is no way she could come across as a plain, mousy nun (Hepburn would be drop-dead beautiful even in a burlap sack) but her acting is so convincing that we forget she is the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn and see her only as a soul in torment.  Peter Finch is excellent as Dr. Fortunati and all of the minor characters are very well portrayed, but the real soul of the movie is Edith Evans as Reverend Mother Emmanuel, concerned with the spiritual health of her flock, and despairing yet fatalistic as one of her flock inexorably slips away.  The movie is long (two and a half hours) but it's never boring; it grabs our interest from the opening frame and holds it to the final frame in which Hepburn turns a corner out of the convent grounds and out of our sight.  The one jarring note, especially after 40 years, is the patronizing paternalism of the Belgian colonization in the Congo; except for the education and medical care provided by the Church, the cruelty of Belgian colonial occupation was legendary and makes us wonder what Sister Luke's fate would have been if she had returned to the Congo after she left the convent.  At the end of the film we are left with great respect and admiration for an incredibly strong yet fallible young woman whose journey to self-knowledge is a life-long project.",5,A soul torn in

Boullosa,"[7, 7]","Regardless of your individual religious convictions (or the lack thereof), this film deserves to be seen for its fantastic performances and the scrupulous care with which the original material was transferred to the screen.  ""The Nun's Story"" is based on the book of the same name by Katherine Hulme, who wrote it as fiction; however, the book was a memoir of the real-life experiences of Hulme's friend and companion.The cast list alone should tell you something: Dame Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Dean Jagger, Beatrice Straight, Colleen Dewhurst, Mildred Dunnock, Peter Finch, Niall McGinnis (a VERY long way from ""Curse of the Demon"" and ""Anna Karenina"").  Directed by Fred Zinneman (""High Noon""), the film also boasts a powerful score by Franz Waxman and gorgeous cinematography - it was filmed in Cinemascope, which had recently superceded Technicolor as the color transference system of choice.""The Nun's Story"" recounts Gabrielle Van der Mal's seventeen years in a strict Belgian order of nuns between the two world wars.  Gaby (Audrey Hepburn) is the daughter of a renowned Belgian pulmonary surgeon (Dean Jagger) and has inherited his passion for medicine - she is already skilled in basic nursing and the use of a microscope.  The Van der Mal family is devout, but her distinguished scientist father is nevertheless dismayed when his highly intelligent daughter announces her intention of joining an order of nursing nuns whose members also serve out in the Belgian Congo.  Gaby is planning, under the convent's aegis, to train at the School for Tropical Medicine and obtain a certificate that will allow her to go out to the Congo as a nurse.It must be remembered that in 1925, ordinary women were barred from becoming doctors, certainly from entering a field as challenging as tropical medicine, and that nuns would be a rare exception to this restriction. Thus, the film hints from the beginning that Gaby's motives for entering the religious life go beyond mere spiritual dedication.  Gaby is sincere in her religious ardor, but it is only one reason that she selects this life.From the outset, the very gifts that make Gaby a likely asset to her order's nursing staff, her intelligence and decisive temperament, present problems in her training as a nun.  Her order's Rule is ""Poverty, Chastity, Obedience.""  As her father says the day he delivers her to the convent, ""Gaby, I can see you poor, I can see you chaste; but for the life of me, I cannot see you obedient."" And, indeed, the training in obedient, unthinking detachment that makes responding to a prayer bell a higher priority than completing the administering of medicine to a patient, all chafe at Gaby's essential nature.  She is influenced and encouraged in this struggle by the charismatic Superior General of the order, played with a wonderful combination of majesty and compassion by the great Dame Edith Evans.Nevertheless, despite some bumps in the road, Gaby passes successfully through her year as a postulant and takes her initial vows, where she is given the name Sister Luke.  As Sister Luke she enters the School of Tropical Medicine, receives her coveted certificate, and sets out on the life she has chosen for herself, although it will require three years of further testing by her superiors, who do not quite trust that she has subdued her will and is sufficiently ""in the mold"", before she is sent out to the Congo.  During the three-year testing period, Sister Luke passes through two major crises that force her to reexamine her fitness for the religious life, but at last she takes her final vows, and is told to prepare herself to go out to the Congo, where she will join a small group of nursing sisters attached to two hospitals, one for white Europeans and one for the Congo natives.The film then covers the next decade of Sister Luke's life in the Congo, and her struggles to combine her commitment to becoming a fine nurse AND a fine nun, one who personifies her Order's Rule.  However, an appropriate balance between the two becomes more elusive, rather than closer, as the years progress.  Sister Luke's struggle is not helped by the entry onto the scene of Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch), a difficult but gifted surgeon that Sister Luke must work with.  He brings a sexual charge into the atmosphere and is, moreover, an atheist.  He discerns immediately that Sister Luke, whose skills he considers to be far above those of other nursing sisters he has worked with, is NOT ""in the mold"".  When Sister Luke contracts tuberculosis, Dr. Fortunati tells her plainly that he believes her health is reflecting her emotional conflict, but Sister Luke refuses to accept his diagnosis.By the time this confrontation occurs, World War II is shaping ominously on the horizon - years have gone by, and suddenly the Mother House in Belgium recalls Sister Luke, ostensibly to accompany a difficult patient home to Europe.  Sister Luke goes very reluctantly, by now hopelessly in love with the African landscape, and she plans to return.  But within a short time of her return, WWII finally erupts, Germany invades Holland and then Belgium, and Sister Luke's return to the Congo is cut off.It is now nearly 17 years since she entered the convent, and Sister Luke is horrified to find that, after all this time, she is as unable as ever to subdue her worldy feelings to the spiritual direction of the Order. She is consumed with an un-Christian hatred of the enemy (who also occupied Belgium during World War I) that is completely at variance with her spiritual training.  Her hatred is fanned into a blazing bonfire when she learns that her father has been killed by German strafing as he stopped to help the wounded along a road on which thousands were fleeing to the countryside.This information brings Sister Luke to a crossroads that, in reality, she has been approaching since she first entered the convent.  The crisis she passes through as she considers whether to persevere or break her vows dwarfs her previous struggles, and her decision gives the film its stunning ending.Whether or not you yourself accept the tenets of Christianity or any other religion is not important - the film is a work of art that examines a unique life and a set of experiences that few in today's fast-paced modern world can imagine.  The point is not Gaby's Christianity - the point is one woman's struggle to reconcile two seemingly opposing facets of her character, both of which she sincerely honors, and the inevitable confrontation that forces her to give one up.Today, there are few Orders left that reflect the severe character of the one that Gaby enters so young.  The film offers a fascinating portrait of life inside such an Order and is exquisitely filmed.  It manages to convey the austere beauty of life inside the Mother House, but does not spare the hypocrisies, petty jealousies, and mistakes that flourish within it.  The more colorful life of the nursing nuns in the Congo is also gorgeous. The performances are magnificent, and it is a tribute to Hepburn that her youthful beauty does not undermine her portrayal of Sister Luke.This is a fantastic film and not to be missed.",5,Fantastic

There are no car chases, romances, explosions or battle scenes. Instead it is a simple quiet story of a Belgian nurse named Sister Luke/Gabriel van der Mal and her experiences in various convents and hospitals. She throws her whole heart into whatever she does, always expecting perfection and usually finding her achievements not up to her standards. Because of her independent disposition, strong will and failure (in her opinion) to live in obedience to the Holy Rule, she eventually leaves the convent but still retains her faith in God and respect for the other nuns.Audrey Hepburn considered Sister Luke her finest role and it's easy to see why. Most people remember her for her light, romantic comedies (Roman holiday, Sabrina, Love in the Afternoon, etc.) where she plays basically the same ditzy, flighty, whimsical persona over and over. The Nun's Story, on the other hand, was one of the very few times she showed that she really was a serious dramatic actress. Here, she avoids all grand, broad, theatrical strokes, embedding Sister Luke in a rich and marvelous fabric of subtlety. Usually I&#8217;m not too fond of extremely low-key, cerebral, detached performances but it really works well for this particular role because Sister Luke is supposed to be sweet, shy, quiet and reserved. She&#8217;s not the sort of person who &#8216;lets it all out&#8217; every time she&#8217;s under the slightest bit of pressure instead she keeps it all bottled up. For instance Mr. Fortunati, one of the doctors she works with teases her about her vows.Dr. Fortunati: Tommorow Mother Matilda is going to take you to the leper colonies to meet Father Melandin. I think the trip will do you good. Religion hasn&#8217;t made him tense and disciplined.Sister Luke: (obviously perturbed) A nun is a disciplined person sir.Dr. F: Yes but not necessarily tense. As a physician it&#8217;s not my duty to inquire into the mind but I&#8217;d say tension is the sign of an exhausting inner struggle. What do you think?(Sister Luke remembering one of her vows is not to engage in useless conversations remains silent.)Dr. F: (sarcastic tone) The grand silence, eh?Sister L: (Can&#8217;t take it anymore) Don&#8217;t you realize that every time you make me talk to you like this I should go down before my sisters and proclaim my fault?Dr. F: (realizing he has gone too far in ribbing her) I&#8217;m sorry.Hepburn&#8217;s performance is a beautiful one&#8212;seamless from to bottom&#8212;with her soft, soothing voice and subtle facial expressions very much like Jennifer Jones Oscar winning performance in The Song of Bernadette. Probably her finest moments are:1. The shocked look on her face when Mother Marcella tells her to fail her examination to give a lackluster student a chance of getting to the top of class.2. The way she trembles as she is tempted to give the wrong answers during the test. She can&#8217;t bring herself to fail after she&#8217;s worked so hard so instead she answers correctly.3. When she&#8217;s sick in bed. Dr. Fortunati gives her a prairie oyster for medicine. I love the look on her face after she swallows it. You can tell it must have been disgusting.4. The way her face brightens up as she holds the black baby during the scene where the other nuns are teaching the natives how to wash their babies.Dame Edith Evans is magnificent as the Sister Luke&#8217;s closest friend, Mother Emmanuel. (The Abbess at the beginning of the movie) Edith Evans was one of those Shakespearian character actresses who always gave 110% whether the role was small or large. Her rich, warm, creamy voice and the way she relishes every word is a pleasure to the ears. You get the feeling she truly cares about her flock.Probably her finest moments were:1. Her speech to the novices about the difficulties of a nun's life. When they kneel and ask to be admitted into the congregation. The way she delivers the line, &#34;Arise in the name of God.&#34; is priceless. She concludes with probably the most profound sentiment in the whole film. &#34;Remember dear children, you can very easily cheat us your sisters. But you can never cheat yourself or God.&#34;2. When she gives Sister Luke the whip &#34;This is the discipline for penance in private. You will use it twice each week while you are saying the Miserere. Remember it is essentially a symbol of penance. Too much is just as bad as too little.3. When Sister Luke tells her she wants to leave the convent because she can't help being too hard on herself. With sadness and conviction, Mother Emmanuel says &#34;When you leave, I shall keep you in my heart and prayers.&#34;Three other performances really stood out to me.1. Colleen Dewhurst in her debut as a dangerous lunatic who calls herself the Archangel Gabriel. When she asks Sister Luke for a glass of water, she speaks in a normal tone of voice and looks completely sane and composed. But when Sister Luke gives her the glass--BOOM! A wrestling match ensues.2. Dorothy Alison as Sister Aurelie, a bubbly, cheerful, good-hearted nun who works in the Congo. She asks Illunga, a voodooist servant to come inside the church and see her new nativity set. He shakes his head and continues his work. She tells Sister Luke &#34;I would give anything if I could only convert him.&#34; The next day another native beats her to death because the local witch doctor told him if he killed a white woman he would be freed from the ghost of his dead wife. The way she staggers towards him with her arms open as if ready to forgive him after the first blow always gives me the chills. Immediately after Aurelie's death, Illunga becomes a Christian--he attends the Christmas Eve service no longer wearing the witch doctor's necklace. Aurelie's death was not in vain.3. Errol John as Illunga, the kindly black nurse who works for the nuns. His subtle facial expressions are amazing and makes me wish there was an Academy award category called &#8220;Best Actor/Actress in a Cameo Appearance.&#8221;  The most powerful moments are:a.) The skeptical look on his face as he's sweeping and Aurelie invites him in.b.) When he and his friends tackle her murder. He takes off the culprit's witch doctor necklace and stares at it. The way he trembles all over and the look on his face conveys so much.c.) The calm, peaceful and resolute expression at the Christimas Eve.I also love how the screenplay treats the relationship between Dr. Fortunati and Sister Luke. He is gruff, sarcastic and likes to tease but deep down inside, he really does care about her. Before she leaves, he tells her that he is afraid he will never see her again and no nurse could ever take her place. Does Hollywood still know how to make a movie where a man and woman are only close friends?Fred Zinneman's simple, fine, unfussy, stagey direction is perfectly suited to this quiet, serious drama and while it does not quite rise to the greatness of William Wyler's work in Ben-Hur he did manage to get me feeling some strong emotions and care about the characters.Franz Planer's cinematography contains soft, pastel colors and his Congo scenes are some of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen. The screenplay is intelligent and does a great job exploring the details cloistered life. Not one line is wasted. Every word has a meaning. Like the screenplay, the film editing has no wasted minutes--every scene is brief, concise and to the point.Five stars all the way.",5,The art of subtlety.,1388966400,"01 6,

This is the story of a Belgian ""DK (doc's kid)"" (Audrey Hepburn) who becomes a nun, and offers a lot of insight on the Catholic church's teaching of near self-hatred to its nuns. The late George Carlin didn't even scratch the surface of that issue in some of his sketches about being raised in Catholic schools. Carlin was doubtlessly far from the only person tipped over into agnosticsm by that factor. Hepburn's Sister Luke is a bit tougher, but she still has her problems. For example, she develops a number of ""BFF"" friendships, only to find out that friendship with any mortal is considered disloyal to God. At one point Sister Luke is pressured into deliberately failing an exam qualifying her for the mission in a hospital in the Congo because she would have outscored another novice who was preferred for the post. She meets a number of teaching sisters who are not as extreme as others in this viewpoint. Indeed, George Carlin's not seeking a career in the Church meant he didn't know the half of it about how humility can morph over into beating up on yourself. As well as becoming so ingrained into the system that it becomes institututionalized. Eventually Sister Luke ends up having a crisis of conscience over the outbreak of World War II that forces her to re-examine her conflicting identities as a nun and as a Belgian.One accidental bit of childish humor in this film concerns the practice of Congolese villagers of calling Sister Luke ""Mama Luke"". When I got to school a few days later I learned that some of my classmates had also seen the film. Especially the Italian guys, who were amused by the fact that ""Mama Luke"" sounded like one insult in Italian that was sort of vulgar.

323874,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6302636779,Roland E. Zwick,"[18, 18]","Perched high atop the list of the finest American movies of the 1950's, Fred Zinnemann`s ""The Nun's Story"" is an intensely beautiful and powerful film about a woman who undergoes a crisis of faith and, through her struggle, learns the importance of finding one's true path in life.  Based on the novel by Kathryn Hulme, the film tells the story of Gabrielle van der Mal, a Belgian woman who enters the convent in the 1930`s, spends a brief period working as a nurse in the Congo, then leaves the order after years of intense personal struggle with herself and with God.  Among American films of its time, ""The Nun's Story"" stands virtually alone in its ability and willingness to dramatize a conflict taking place in the deepest recesses of a character's mind and soul.Audrey Hepburn - sans makeup and the kind of fashion-plate wardrobe that had already become the hallmark of her movie career - delivers one of her richest performances as the strong-willed and fiercely independent Sister Luke, whose very psyche is torn asunder by the battle between her own innate, personal pride and a sincere desire to live a life of obedience to the Church and its rules.  With everything but her countenance hidden beneath a nun's habit, Ms. Hepburn is forced to draw on her resources as an actress, having to convey the titanic internal conflict taking place within her character almost entirely through facial expressions, vocal intonations and body language.  And she proves herself more than equal to the challenge.  She is brilliantly complemented by Peter Finch, playing the cynical but humane Dr. Fortunati, a dedicated surgeon who is as concerned about Sister Luke's spiritual health as her physical health.  The relationship between the two is handled with a great deal of subtlety and tact, never allowing the obvious romantic attraction between the two attractive people to come too much to the fore.  Rounding out the excellent cast are Dean Jagger as Gabrielle's loving and concerned father, Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock as two older nuns who help guide Sister Luke along the way, and the incomparable Edith Evans, simply astounding as the Reverend Mother who sees unwavering devotion to God and the Church as the one and only goal of a serious nun.Among other things, ""The Nun's Story"" is that rare film dealing with religion and spirituality that doesn't contain a single hokey or sentimental moment, that knows the difference between religion and religiosity, that is respectful without being unduly reverential, and that acknowledges the complexity of the human heart in matters of devotion and faith.  It also is not afraid to take its time to set the scene and tell its story, never feeling the need to rush headlong into the next dramatic moment just to keep the movie going.  In a perfect blending of form and content, the film is every bit as thoughtful, subtle and contemplative as its subject matter, its mood greatly enhanced by the rich and evocative Franz Waxman score that underlines the seriousness of the work.In addition to all its other fine virtues, ""The Nun's Story"" features one of the greatest final scenes and closing shots in motion picture history, a masterpiece of precision and understatement that demonstrates the kind of taste Zinnemann always displayed as a director.  The movie is made up of small, beautifully observed moments that, when put together, provide a powerful glimpse into the heart and life of a fascinating, caring individual who wants to do great things in the world but who realizes that the path she has chosen is not the one that will ultimately lead her to her rightful destiny.On every level of filmmaking, this is truly one of the greats.",5,the art of subtlety,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,3700,"['Perched', 'high', 'list', 'finest', 'American', 'movies', '1950', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 's', 'Nun', 'Story', 'intensely', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'film', 'woman', 'who', 'crisis', 'faith', 'struggle', 'importance', 'finding', 'one', 'true', 'path', 'life', 'Based', 'novel', 'Kathryn', 'Hulme', 'film', 'story', 'Gabrielle', 'van', 'der', 'Mal', 'Belgian', 'woman', 'who', 'convent', '1930', 's', 'brief', 'period', 'working', 'nurse', 'Congo', 'then', 'order', 'years', 'intense', 'personal', 'struggle', 'herself', 'God', 'American', 'films', 'time', 'Nun', 'Story', 'virtually', 'alone', 'ability', 'willingness', 'dramatize', 'conflict', 'taking', 'place', 'deepest', 'recesses', 'character', 'mind', 'soul.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'sans', 'makeup', 'kind', 'fashion-plate', 'wardrobe', 'had', 'already', 'become', 'hallmark', 'movie', 'career', 'one', 'richest', 'performances', 'strong-willed', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'very', 'psyche', 'torn', 'asunder', 'battle', 'own', 'innate', 'personal', 'pride', 'sincere', 'desire', 'live', 'life', 'obedience', 'Church', 'rules', 'everything', 'countenance', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'nun', 'habit', 'Ms.', 'Hepburn', 'forced', 'draw', 'resources', 'actress', 'having', 'convey', 'titanic', 'internal', 'conflict', 'taking', 'place', 'character', 'almost', 'entirely', 'facial', 'expressions', 'vocal', 'intonations', 'body', 'language', 'more', 'equal', 'challenge', 'brilliantly', 'complemented', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'playing', 'cynical', 'humane', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'dedicated', 'surgeon', 'who', 'as', 'concerned', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'spiritual', 'health', 'physical', 'health', 'relationship', 'two', 'handled', 'great', 'deal', 'subtlety', 'tact', 'never', 'allowing', 'obvious', 'romantic', 'attraction', 'two', 'attractive', 'people', 'come', 'too', 'much', 'fore', 'Rounding', 'out', 'excellent', 'cast', 'are', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'Gabrielle', 'loving', 'concerned', 'father', 'Peggy', 'Ashcroft', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'two', 'older', 'nuns', 'who', 'help', 'guide', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'way', 'incomparable', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'simply', 'astounding', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'who', 'unwavering', 'devotion', 'God', 'Church', 'one', 'only', 'goal', 'serious', 'other', 'things', 'Nun', 'Story', 'rare', 'film', 'dealing', 'religion', 'spirituality', ""n't"", 'contain', 'single', 'hokey', 'sentimental', 'moment', 'difference', 'religion', 'religiosity', 'respectful', 'being', 'unduly', 'reverential', 'complexity', 'human', 'heart', 'matters', 'devotion', 'faith', 'also', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'time', 'set', 'scene', 'tell', 'story', 'never', 'feeling', 'need', 'rush', 'headlong', 'next', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'just', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'perfect', 'blending', 'form', 'content', 'film', 'bit', 'thoughtful', 'subtle', 'contemplative', 'subject', 'matter', 'mood', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'rich', 'evocative', 'Franz', 'Waxman', 'score', 'seriousness', 'work.In', 'addition', 'other', 'fine', 'virtues', 'Nun', 'Story', 'one', 'greatest', 'final', 'scenes', 'closing', 'shots', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'masterpiece', 'precision', 'understatement', 'kind', 'taste', 'Zinnemann', 'always', 'displayed', 'director', 'movie', 'made', 'small', 'beautifully', 'observed', 'moments', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'provide', 'powerful', 'glimpse', 'heart', 'life', 'fascinating', 'caring', 'individual', 'who', 'do', 'great', 'things', 'world', 'who', 'path', 'chosen', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'rightful', 'destiny.On', 'level', 'filmmaking', 'truly', 'one', 'greats']",N/A

I was very glad to see it released on DVD.  So many of my favorite classic movies are not released on DVD.  The Nun's Story is an enthralling story of a young idealistic young woman who was brilliant in medicine thanks to the tutelage of her doctor father.  Upon learning that the man she loves carries genes that will pass on severe mental disabilities, they decided that it wouldn't be right to marry.  Gabrielle decides that since her life in the world was essentially over, the convent would be her best option.  She works hard to become the perfect nun.  Along with all the spiritual struggles she went thru, she was also able to obtain degrees in tropical medicine (the first step towards service in the Congo) to one in psychiatry.  Sister Luke's spiritual troubles make you want to reach out and hug her, to let her know that she wasn't a bad nun and an excellent nurse.  It was obvious that she would have made a cracker jack doctor herself if the conventions of the time would have allowed her to attend medical school.  Even tho this movie has religious overtones, it was, nevertheless a fantastic movie and the scenes that were shot on site in the Belgium and the Congo were breathtaking.  I adored the author of the book, Kathrine Hulme for many many years.  I first read the book in 10th grade and loved it.  I have a very dog-eared paperback copy that has been well loved.  Only with the advent of used book merchants was I actually able to obtain a hard cover copy of the book.  If you like Audrey Hepburn, you'll love her in this.

323885,AX5M99FZN281B,6302636779,Thomas A. DiMaggio,"[25, 28]","""The Nun's Story"" ranks with ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", and ""Chinatown"", as one of the very best films ever produced in Hollywood. Its director, Fred Zinnemann, has never received a fraction of the credit he deserves, for this and for other masterpieces of intelligent narrative filmmaking such as 1966's ""A Man for All Seasons"", perhaps because he serves his stories so well that Oscar Wilde's dictum -- that the aim of art is to reveal art and conceal the artist -- has been all too well fulfilled. What I truly love about the story of Sister Luke is that it is in no sense a polemic: it is possible to see that, for certain persons (such as the Reverend Mother, played to angelic perfection by Edith Evans), the ""Holy Rule"" can indeed be the way to a blissful sense of unity with the eternal, while for a creative and dynamic spirit like Sister Luke's, that same discipline can ultimately only stifle and defeat that which makes her fully human.The scene in which Sister Marcella urges her to fail her medical qualifying examinations deliberately, in order to combat her sense of intellectual pride, is one of the most exquisite moments in cinema -- there is no doubt that this is, in every sense, a monstrous demand, while there is also no doubt that the person suggesting it is doing it out of a genuine sense of concern for the young nun. (Where on earth is this type of mature moral complexity in today's movies?) The only aspect of the film that is likely to trouble intelligent viewers is the racial subtext of the Congo scenes. To hear adult Congolese men casually referred to as ""boys"" is cringe-inducing; and that the Catholic Church was perfectly willing to segregate blacks and whites in different hospitals (the one for the Congolese being of course vastly inferior in services and facilities)shows just how far we as a species have yet to go on the road to civilization. But this is a blemish on a large-souled and utterly transfixing work.The relationship between Sister Luke and Dr. Fortunati (the late Peter Finch in a flawless performance)is one that every aspiring filmmaker should be tied to a chair and forced to watch a dozen times, in order to see how real adults interact, when they have something more important (gasp!)than sex at the center of their concerns. Whatever one's own religious beliefs, or lack of them, this is the finest portrayal I know of on film of what it means to seek transcendence in life; and that is, for all decent persons, the Question of Questions. I cannot believe that any person who sees ""The Nun's Story"" will not feel that their own search for the lasting values in human existence has not been helped on its way by this beautiful film.",5,Soul Food -- Make That A Soul Banquet,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,2719,"['Nun', 'Story', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Treasure', 'Sierra', 'Madre', 'Chinatown', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'never', 'received', 'fraction', 'credit', 'other', 'masterpieces', 'intelligent', 'narrative', 'filmmaking', 'such', '1966', 'A', 'Man', 'Seasons', 'perhaps', 'stories', 'so', 'well', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'dictum', 'aim', 'art', 'reveal', 'art', 'conceal', 'artist', 'been', 'too', 'well', 'fulfilled', 'What', 'truly', 'love', 'story', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'sense', 'polemic', 'possible', 'see', 'certain', 'persons', 'such', 'Reverend', 'Mother', 'played', 'angelic', 'perfection', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'Holy', 'Rule', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'way', 'blissful', 'sense', 'unity', 'eternal', 'creative', 'dynamic', 'spirit', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'same', 'discipline', 'can', 'ultimately', 'only', 'stifle', 'defeat', 'fully', 'human.The', 'scene', 'Sister', 'Marcella', 'fail', 'medical', 'qualifying', 'examinations', 'deliberately', 'order', 'combat', 'sense', 'intellectual', 'pride', 'one', 'most', 'exquisite', 'moments', 'cinema', 'doubt', 'sense', 'monstrous', 'demand', 'also', 'doubt', 'person', 'suggesting', 'doing', 'genuine', 'sense', 'concern', 'young', 'nun', 'Where', 'earth', 'type', 'mature', 'moral', 'complexity', 'today', 'movies', 'only', 'aspect', 'film', 'likely', 'trouble', 'intelligent', 'viewers', 'racial', 'subtext', 'Congo', 'scenes', 'hear', 'adult', 'Congolese', 'men', 'casually', 'referred', 'boys', 'cringe-inducing', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'segregate', 'blacks', 'whites', 'different', 'hospitals', 'one', 'Congolese', 'being', 'course', 'vastly', 'services', 'facilities', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'species', 'have', 'yet', 'go', 'road', 'civilization', 'blemish', 'large-souled', 'utterly', 'transfixing', 'work.The', 'relationship', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'Dr.', 'Fortunati', 'late', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'flawless', 'performance', 'one', 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'should', 'be', 'tied', 'chair', 'forced', 'watch', 'dozen', 'times', 'order', 'see', 'how', 'real', 'adults', 'interact', 'when', 'have', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'gasp', 'sex', 'center', 'concerns', 'own', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'lack', 'finest', 'portrayal', 'know', 'film', 'what', 'seek', 'transcendence', 'life', 'decent', 'persons', 'Question', 'Questions', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'person', 'who', 'Nun', 'Story', 'will', 'not', 'feel', 'own', 'search', 'lasting', 'values', 'human', 'existence', 'not', 'been', 'helped', 'way', 'beautiful', 'film']",N/A

It is one of the most, if not the most, powerful film I have ever seen dealing with religion, personal conflict and the will to keep going.The Nun's story follows the story of the young Gabrielle van der Mal (Audrey Hepburn) who decides to become a nun. We see how she becomes one of many, dealing with religion, personal feelings and her obligations. She becomes a nun in hospitals, studying to be able to go to Congo, where she becomes the assistent of a Doctor. But even though Gabrielle, now named sister Luke, wants to do everything right and according to the rules a nun must live to, the inner struggle just becomes stronger and stronger.Audrey Hepburn once again delivers. She acts extremely powerful and is totally believable as the struggeling sister. This was her prove to the world back in the 1950's, that she also could act in stead of just looking pretty on the screen. Her third oscar nomination followed for this role, which she sadly didn't won, but definitely deserved.The rest of the cast also acts great. Peter Finch potrays the doctor sister Luke gets assigned to. He acts convincingly and gives a satisfying performance.The film also features a fantastic supporting cast which have been rightly selected by the filmmakers and helps bringing the story to life even more.The locations, are from dark and sad to colorfull and bright. The beauty of the exotic Congo has been magnificently captured on camera and gives the film a fantastic atmosphere and look.Next to Hepburn's beautiful performance, the thing that grabbed me the most was the story. It is extremely powerful and emotional. It even had a kind of thriller edge to it sometimes. Those moments made me wispher things to the screen like: ""No no no, don't do that"".The story just pulls you in and keeps you there till the very end of the film. It is drama from the highest level.Wonderful filmmaking, beautiful locations, a fasenating Hepburn and one of the most powerful stories I have ever seen.And that last shot, those last few seconds of the film will always be burned in my memory.",5,Powerful.

323890,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6302636779,Trevor Willsmer,"[10, 10]","Seen again for the first time in a couple of decades, Warner's beautifully restored DVD of The Nun's Story is a real surprise, avoiding the mawkish sentimentality that usually accompanied old Hollywood's approach to Catholicism with a sober, quiet unostentatious majesty and a mostly successful attempt to avoid clich&eacute; (there's no romance with Peter Finch's surgeon as you might expect). Fred Zinnemann, who now seems on the verge of being completely forgotten, constantly does things slightly differently - not just jump cutting from continent to continent, but avoiding convention in subtle ways. When Sister Luke departs for the Congo, not only is her departure handled in the bare minimum of shots but they're also not the ones you usually expect: no head on shots of the ship leaving for the open sea, but instead zooming out from a sideways view before cutting to the ship's wake. The visual economy never feels Spartan, but at the same time it fits the subject matter perfectly.Audrey Hepburn too is something of a revelation. Too often an irritatingly kooky pixie clotheshorse, here she abandons many of her usual affectations that you either find charming or maddening to give the kind of sincere and grounded performance that was too rarely asked of her. It's a quietly powerful and surprisingly honest film that stands up to the test of time. Shame that for some reason Zinnemann gets Dean Jagger to voice one of the bit players as well, which briefly takes you out of the movie before a sudden act of unexpected violence shocks you back in, but there's little else to fault in it.The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer.",5,Powerful and unsentimental,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,1649,"['Seen', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'couple', 'decades', 'Warner', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'DVD', 'Nun', 'Story', 'real', 'surprise', 'avoiding', 'mawkish', 'sentimentality', 'usually', 'accompanied', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'approach', 'Catholicism', 'sober', 'quiet', 'unostentatious', 'majesty', 'mostly', 'successful', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'clich', 'eacute', 'romance', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'surgeon', 'might', 'expect', 'Fred', 'Zinnemann', 'who', 'now', 'verge', 'being', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'constantly', 'things', 'slightly', 'differently', 'not', 'just', 'jump', 'cutting', 'continent', 'continent', 'avoiding', 'convention', 'subtle', 'ways', 'When', 'Sister', 'Luke', 'Congo', 'not', 'only', 'departure', 'handled', 'bare', 'minimum', 'shots', ""'re"", 'also', 'not', 'ones', 'usually', 'expect', 'head', 'shots', 'ship', 'leaving', 'open', 'sea', 'instead', 'zooming', 'out', 'sideways', 'view', 'cutting', 'ship', 'wake', 'visual', 'economy', 'never', 'Spartan', 'same', 'time', 'subject', 'matter', 'perfectly.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'too', 'something', 'revelation', 'Too', 'often', 'irritatingly', 'kooky', 'pixie', 'clotheshorse', 'here', 'many', 'usual', 'affectations', 'find', 'charming', 'maddening', 'give', 'kind', 'sincere', 'grounded', 'performance', 'was', 'too', 'rarely', 'asked', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'surprisingly', 'honest', 'film', 'up', 'test', 'time', 'Shame', 'reason', 'Zinnemann', 'Dean', 'Jagger', 'voice', 'one', 'bit', 'players', 'as', 'well', 'briefly', 'movie', 'sudden', 'act', 'unexpected', 'violence', 'shocks', 'back', 'little', 'else', 'fault', 'it.The', 'only', 'DVD', 'original', 'trailer']",N/A
