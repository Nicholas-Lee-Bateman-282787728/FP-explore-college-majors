But *Basically*, it is too slow, too long, boring, annoying, pretentious, confusing, and silly. Central characters aren't developed well and there are too many unnecessary minor roles, scenes draw out while annoying background music never stops.... and the story -the story is just a mess. Some of the negative customer reviews do a good job pointing out issues I had. Trust me, they're mostly right. You wont believe in a miracle after witnessing this fiasco of a film. You'll just find it's a bunch of nonsense with some silly ""mystical"" bull thrown in with another Spike Lee 'joint' about racist America. Imagine it is not a portrayal of black soldiers in WW2--take out that part-- and then it has nothing going for it. It's a shame that when blacks finally get a film tribute for their service in the war and white America reminded of it's racism its in a poorly made movie.

1214621,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B001LLH8S4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 10]","MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA got panned pretty severely. And I can see why. Lacking cohesion and hopscotching around like a child with A-D-D, the story is tough to follow. And what about the title? Exactly what is ""the Miracle""? Some might say it's that this film ever got made. But there are some upsides to it that I think make this a semi-watchable flick.The first plus is that it focuses on a little known regiment of black WW II fighters called ""The Buffalo Soldiers."" Spike Lee had apparently been aching to do another ""black story"" and found his muse in Nazi occupied Italy.Although there's been some bashing related to overacting on the main characters' parts, I didn't find that to be the case. Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, and the rest of these band of brothers did fine in my eyes. Although Spike did have them doing things that weren't being done during this time (specifically the ""high five"" which wasn't realized until the late 70s), I did find their delivery of the story to be engaging enough, and kept me watching during its entire, lengthy, 2 hours and 40 minute run time.I also really liked the on-site filming locations in Italy, which gave the entire production a very real quality. The cobbled streets, twisted landscape, and ancient-looking buildings were all well-shown in the film and had me ogling at various times.But, as they say, all good things must come to an end. Although Spike Lee tries admirably to keep the story together, he too often wanders off on tangents that have nothing to do with the story. One particularly infuriating scene involves John Leguizamo (THE HAPPENING). He's in modern day Italy with his lover and his only use for being in the film is that he throws a newspaper out a window so that it lands on a man's table. Why couldn't the man have simply seen it at a newsstand? Why the whole set up with Leguizamo and the hot chick? Sex for the sake of sex, perhaps?The other, less infuriating, item that shows Spike wandering away was when he films the Buffalo boys being refused food service at a place back in the States before they were shipped overseas. Why this played a role in the film and what it had to do with the Miracle is anyone's guess.Finally, there's the tough sell of the Miracle itself. Although people can debate what qualifies as a miracle, I think most would say it equates to something supernatural that cannot be explained by normal evidence. And here lies perhaps the biggest problem for Miracle at St. Anna. There really isn't a miracle. Perhaps it's well enough that one of the Buffalo men made it home and found his way to peace. Perhaps it's that the world spun and allowed the last surviving Buffalo Soldier to avenge the people of St. Anna and his fallen brothers. Perhaps ...but not likely.",3,Perhaps Spike Lee Needs More Focus...,1235952000,"03 2, 2009",2009,2759,"['MIRACLE', 'AT', 'ST.', 'ANNA', 'got', 'panned', 'pretty', 'severely', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Lacking', 'cohesion', 'hopscotching', 'around', 'child', 'A-D-D', 'story', 'tough', 'follow', 'what', 'title', 'Exactly', 'what', 'Miracle', 'might', 'say', 'film', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'are', 'upsides', 'think', 'make', 'semi-watchable', 'flick.The', 'first', 'little', 'known', 'regiment', 'black', 'WW', 'II', 'fighters', 'called', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'had', 'apparently', 'been', 'aching', 'do', 'black', 'story', 'found', 'muse', 'Nazi', 'occupied', 'Italy.Although', 'been', 'bashing', 'related', 'overacting', 'main', 'characters', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'case', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'rest', 'band', 'brothers', 'did', 'fine', 'eyes', 'Spike', 'did', 'have', 'doing', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 'done', 'time', 'specifically', 'high', 'five', 'was', ""n't"", 'realized', 'late', '70s', 'did', 'find', 'delivery', 'story', 'be', 'engaging', 'enough', 'kept', 'watching', 'entire', 'lengthy', '2', 'hours', '40', 'minute', 'run', 'time.I', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'on-site', 'filming', 'locations', 'Italy', 'gave', 'entire', 'production', 'very', 'real', 'quality', 'cobbled', 'streets', 'twisted', 'landscape', 'ancient-looking', 'buildings', 'were', 'well-shown', 'film', 'had', 'ogling', 'various', 'times.But', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'admirably', 'keep', 'story', 'together', 'too', 'often', 'off', 'tangents', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'One', 'particularly', 'infuriating', 'scene', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'THE', 'HAPPENING', 'modern', 'day', 'Italy', 'lover', 'only', 'use', 'being', 'film', 'newspaper', 'out', 'window', 'man', 'table', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'man', 'have', 'simply', 'seen', 'newsstand', 'Why', 'whole', 'set', 'up', 'Leguizamo', 'hot', 'chick', 'Sex', 'sake', 'sex', 'perhaps', 'other', 'less', 'infuriating', 'item', 'Spike', 'wandering', 'away', 'was', 'when', 'films', 'Buffalo', 'being', 'refused', 'food', 'service', 'place', 'back', 'States', 'were', 'shipped', 'overseas', 'Why', 'played', 'role', 'film', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'Miracle', 'anyone', 'guess.Finally', 'tough', 'sell', 'Miracle', 'people', 'can', 'debate', 'what', 'miracle', 'think', 'most', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'supernatural', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'normal', 'evidence', 'here', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'really', ""n't"", 'miracle', 'Perhaps', 'well', 'enough', 'one', 'Buffalo', 'men', 'made', 'home', 'found', 'way', 'peace', 'Perhaps', 'world', 'spun', 'allowed', 'last', 'surviving', 'Buffalo', 'Soldier', 'avenge', 'people', 'St.', 'Anna', 'fallen', 'brothers', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'likely']",Miracle at St Anna

When the Germans assault the village, the Buffalo soldiers try to keep them from killing everyone including a small boy that seemed frightened of one of the Partisans.

1214633,AVPM4HFPBHGFK,B001LLH8S4,Deborah P,"[0, 1]","I wasn't sure I liked this movie the first time I saw it.  I think that's my first response to a lot of Spike Lee's movies. The first time I watched this one, I was looking for the over-all story. It would give that part alone about 3 out of 5 stars. But as a snap shot of black history, I thought this movie was well done. When I watched it  (on video) the second time, I was more into watching how the very individualized  black characters react to racism in the 1940s. When that was more central to my focus the movie meant more to me. (Also interesting: How different groups with totally different agendas appeal to God to be on their side)When the story was about racism and when it wasn't, the story was more about individual people in a certain situation than it was about the situation (WWII) itself. Spike showed the Germans as good and bad, as strong and weak, some only really interested in getting back to their daily lives with wives and children--and some of them only interested in honor and glory and advancing their own rank in the military. (I never understood the comparison to Clint Eastwood's WWII movies: Clint used individual people to give a big but intimate picture of the whole war.)It took some getting used to the big, simple guy who adopts the little boy--but I did second time I saw it. The little boy, I never got used to. Seems like a casting error to me most of the time, but he did a good job just looking tiny and vulnerable sometimes. Still, something about him was too clumsy at times--but I got over it.In the end, I would say I liked the characters and how they showed up in the story. And that's what Spike Lee movies are all about. It's usually not about how you move from A to B to C to the end with his movies. It's always about the characters. And I liked them and I liked the bit of black history the movie revealed.

1214635,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001LLH8S4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 8]","Fantastic!  I was deeply touched by ""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" and its fictional story by James McBride and directed by Spike Lee.  But moreso for using the Blu-ray as a way to educate people of the African Americans who fought in World War II and many before that time.VIDEO & AUDIO:The film is presented in 1080p high definition (2:35:1).  Overall, the picture quality is very good.  Most of the scenes are all outdoor shots and the sunlight and the rain showers and the different weather patterns were featured well on video. Shot in a beautiful Italian village with the mountains in the backdrop, lush surroundings.  Really good location in terms of where they shot this film.And of course, the film is full of action.  Similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"", the film has its share of violent moments and dismemberment.  Some scenes such as one part with the Nazi's talking on top of a mountain, displayed quite a bit of noise in the background, but that scene is fairly short, so nothing to worry about.  But all in all, very good picture quality.The sound is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48khz/24-bit) audio.  The sound is incredible.  From the battle scenes of hearing the multiple gun shots, missiles starting up from the rear channels of your speakers and then flying towards the sides and then front speaker channels and hearing the blast.  And then the subtle moments of hearing the rain all around you.  Those were well done and similar to the video, you definitely get very good audio quality as well!SPECIAL FEATURES:""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" comes with three features and personally, I felt that the two major features are important because they interview African American Veterans who fought in World War II but also showcased the history of the ""Buffalo Soldier"".  Included in the special features:* Deeds Not Words - Director Spike Lee, Writer/Screenwriter James McBride and several veterans who served in World War II in Italy in a live roundtable discussion (about 18 min. long) in regards to their experiences in World War II and being in Italy, how they were treated and then how they were treated back home.  But to see how far African Americans have come and also talking about Obama being the next President (obviously, shot before he won the election).  Very good special feature!* The Buffalo Soldier Experiences - Learning the history of the Buffalo soldier.  A very informative documentary that is about 18 minutes long and went as far back from the Civil War to the present.  Also, a woman who talked about how she bonded with one of the men and has always wondered what has happened to the two guys that stayed in her village, not knowing if they lived or died.  But will always be grateful for their heroism.* Deleted Scenes - There were several deleted scenes and extended scenes.  Some that were rather important and wish they kept in the film but then again, with the film at 160 minutes already, it's going a bit long.JUDGMENT CALL:""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" is an epic film which I enjoyed it a lot. In fact, after the film, I really felt it was fantastic.But there are a few things that prevent it from being excellent.Granted, compared to other war films and fictional and a bit far-fetched at times.  The death of the Italian man in the beginning of the film by an older Corporal Hector Negron is surprising that he's had a gun in his possession near the bank check out area where he works and waiting for revenge 40+ years after World World War II is a bit far-fetched.As for timing, at 160 minutes, it is long and for some, the love triangle focusing on Renata, Stamps and Bishop may have tacked on some additional minutes which some may seem uncalled for.  But I actually felt the film needed it.  Because the truth is the Italians didn't have the racial intolerance towards Blacks like how things were in the U.S.  This village was the home of poor Italians, they didn't have TV.  They looked at the 92nd Infantry Division as heroes.  And thus, the men were treated as equals and some had relationships with the Italian women in the village.If anything, I think that the storyline of the Italian Fascists who capture the Nazi was difficult because they are thrown into the movie with not much character development.  Were we supposed to care about these men?  Obviously one is a traitor but would one really go as far to have his countryman killed for revenge?And then the use of characters such as reporter Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Enrico (John Leguizamo) or Colonel Driscoll (D.B. Sweeney).  Men that would seem to have an important part in the film but they don't.  If anything, they were used as transitional phases for other points in the film.But I'm sure I can nitpick and find what could be edited or not be edited but personally, I was satisfied with the film.  It is a tearjerker.  These four characters that have different personalities, you do care for them but the adventure from beginning to end, I was left speechless.  Omar Benson Miller as Private First Class Sam Train was indeed the gentle giant and he had a wonderful performance.  As did the other three men, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso and Derek Luke.  Great performances by these four men!""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" was really a fantastic film.  It had a good balance from action, heartwarming moments and scenes that captured your attention.  And the fact that you have a Blu-ray that does go into the Buffalo Soldiers and interviewing those who fought in the war and also those who were villagers in Italy in contact with the soldiers validating certain parts of the film and their experiences, it was great to have all that included in conjunction with the very good picture and audio quality in the Blu-ray.Overall, ""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" is a fantastic Blu-ray release that I recommend wholeheartedly!",4,"A fantastic, touching and beautiful film.

It certainly is not in the same class as Clint Eastwood's two Iwo Jima masterpieces, especially ""Letters.""  Clint had one other advantage: He was making historical films. Spike used a novel only loosely based on the St. Anna de Stazzema atrocity.This film seems pasted together.  Train's relationship with the boy was the film's most successful aspect, but the supernatural aspect with the boy's brother didn't work and seemed out of place.  The statue head came off as a gimmick that gave me no reason to empathize with Negron when he saw it at film's end.  I couldn't help but think that the black actors were too-old boys from the hood and not from 1944.  There was no lead-in to why Renata hopped into the sack with the obnoxious Cummings.  A quibble: I question whether ""let's book"" was a WWII-era expression, but maybe it was.

Wong,"[14, 20]","Since Spike Lee has slammed renowned director/actor Clint Eastwood for his lack of utilizing Africain Americans in his two war movies--I was curious to see how bad after reading the many reviews on this film was.  The verdict?  This has to rank as one of Spike's worst movies right up there with ""Jungle Fever"", ""Girl Six"", ""School Daze"", ""Mo Better Blues"", etc.  You would think after he made two successful films like ""The 25th Hour"" or ""Inside Man"" but unfortunately he loaded this movie with his racial polemnics, stereotypes, irrevelant subplots--it's like he threw in the whole kitchen sink in this one!!  Also the Black soldiers in this are depicted almost without exception as street types rather than the trained battle worn soldiers they truly were--what a disservice.  What really surprised me was when the english speaking Italian Renata beds down with the most unsympathetic character in the movie!!  Don't get me wrong there is some good acting in this film particularly from Derek Luke who has been in better movies than this like ""Spartan"" and ""Antwone Fisher"" and also the Italian actors were excellent too.  In fact I found the segments with Italian partisans more involving than the subplots of the infantry--figure that out.  What this film needed was a better story and director perhaps John Singleton, Carl Franklin, Bill Duke and even Mr Eastwood himself.  I've heard that many of the Italian survivors of the atrocity are angry at Lee and James McBride, the writer of this story for taking liberties to the story.  If you want a better film on the contributions of Africain Americans to the war effort, rent ""Glory"".

I almost didn't look at ""Flags of Our Fathers"" {FOF} or ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" as your typical war film. It was more of a reconciling of truths that soldiers needed to come to terms with instead of a ""no man left behind"" type of battle compilation (like ""Saving Private Ryan"").""Miracle at St. Anna"" (MSA) is closer to the scope of ""FOF"" than perhaps Spike wants to be. This film has scope, grandeur, a very solid cast, although some potholes in script and dialogue. I'm officially on the Laz Alonso (Corp. Hector Negron) bandwagon. His inherent sadness and disappointment as an older man (juxtaposed by his calm/self-assuredness as a young man) is palpable onscreen. He conveys a wide range of emotion with his eyes, something that many actors fail to do. Derek Luke and Michael Ealy (2nd Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps and Sgt. Bishop Cummings respectively) are like 2 sides of a coin-one fire and passion, the other cool and professional. Omar Benson Miller (PFC Train) is a giant chocolate teddy bear, and newcomer Matteo Sciabordi (Angelo) shows how war can absolutely paralyze you with fear.I chose to view the miracle of ""MSA"" as one lone boy-family murdered, hungry, desperate, and lost-being able to live a full life, be successful, and take back what the war took from him years ago. It's a powerful message of redemption and love.The score is a wonderful piece of work (with respect to other reviewers who believed that some of the music was out of place; the spiritual was-and is-an integral part of Black American history). Spike generally employs the talents of Terrence Blanchard (who scored 'When the Levees Broke' and 'Four Little Girls' as well), and he doesn't disappoint.

1214654,APEOO1ATR5VHB,B001LLH8S4,"Hype Currie ""scholar of pop culture""","[1, 4]","Miracle at St. Anna is the latest film from director Spike Lee. It is his first war movie, and arguably only the second action-based thriller after 2007's Inside Man. The WWII period film actually opens in the early 80's: A post-office clerk (Laz Alonso) abruptly shoots a customer with a vintage military pistol. An ensuing police investigation finds an Italian stone bust worth millions in the suspect's apartment. A rookie reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) prods him about it, and the main narrative begins: in 1944, four black men, members of the 92nd Infantry ""Buffalo Soldiers"" fight their way behind enemy lines in Axis-controlled Italy. They include the towering Train (Omar Benson Miller), level-headed Stamps (Derek Luke), preacher turned apostate Bishop (Michael Ealy), and Afro-Latin/de facto translator Hector (Alonso). Train obsessively carries the aforementioned bust, retrieved from a previous battle.The quartet manages to find shelter in the Italian village of St. Anna- locals there include partisans who fight against the Nazis. The group also looks after an injured Italian boy (Matteo Sciabordi) with a dark secret, whose foreign tongue and vivid imagination endears him to the God-fearing Train. Meanwhile, resident cynic Bishop frequently butts heads with Stamps, not just over orders but in getting the attention of the pretty Renata (Valentina Cervi).The narrative touches on the conflict and the comfort that the soldiers manage to find in the sleepy village: A Nazi radio broadcast mocks the soldiers' plight as they fight for a country that won't allow them to be served at a restaurant (a scene at an American ice cream parlor illustrates this, with a twist); the group openly dance and flirt with local women, and debate whether their efforts will truly have any impact back home. Conflict with a racist commanding officer threatens to undermine everything as Nazis march toward the town.Lee adapted Miracle at St. Anna from James McBride's 2004 novel, who also wrote the screenplay. The film even manages to offer some quasi-sympathetic Nazis- one, an officer (who likes to read poetry) whose complaints about lack of food and supplies falls on deaf ears; another, a soldier who balks at slaughter of civilians. The cinematography from Matthew J. Libatique is at least as sympathetic as Ernest Dickerson's was to Lee's early work. Lots of wide shots are seen of the Italian countryside, giving scope to how overwhelmed and isolated the four protagonists are.The film lingers a little too long in a few scenes with the villagers and a sub-plot involving a traitor among the partisans, and a court trial epilogue ends rather abruptly, but overall the story is extremely engaging, a portrait of men who sacrificed greatly not only for their country but for a community that was not afforded the same human rights that were being defended on the world stage.Extras are minimal here; hopefully a deluxe 2-disc edition will eventually be available.",4,Lee Film Highlights Forgotten Soldiers of World War II,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",2009,2972,"['Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'latest', 'film', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'first', 'war', 'movie', 'arguably', 'only', 'second', 'action-based', 'thriller', '2007', 'Inside', 'Man', 'WWII', 'period', 'film', 'actually', 'early', '80', 'post-office', 'clerk', 'Laz', 'Alonso', 'abruptly', 'customer', 'vintage', 'military', 'pistol', 'ensuing', 'police', 'investigation', 'Italian', 'stone', 'bust', 'worth', 'millions', 'suspect', 'apartment', 'rookie', 'reporter', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'main', 'narrative', 'begins', '1944', 'four', 'black', 'men', 'members', '92nd', 'Infantry', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'fight', 'way', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Axis-controlled', 'Italy', 'include', 'towering', 'Train', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'level-headed', 'Stamps', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'preacher', 'turned', 'apostate', 'Bishop', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Afro-Latin/de', 'facto', 'translator', 'Hector', 'Alonso', 'Train', 'obsessively', 'aforementioned', 'bust', 'retrieved', 'previous', 'battle.The', 'quartet', 'find', 'shelter', 'Italian', 'village', 'St.', 'Anna-', 'locals', 'there', 'include', 'partisans', 'who', 'fight', 'Nazis', 'group', 'also', 'injured', 'Italian', 'boy', 'Matteo', 'Sciabordi', 'dark', 'secret', 'foreign', 'tongue', 'vivid', 'imagination', 'God-fearing', 'Train', 'Meanwhile', 'resident', 'cynic', 'Bishop', 'frequently', 'heads', 'Stamps', 'not', 'just', 'orders', 'getting', 'attention', 'pretty', 'Renata', 'Valentina', 'Cervi', '.The', 'narrative', 'touches', 'conflict', 'comfort', 'soldiers', 'manage', 'find', 'sleepy', 'village', 'Nazi', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'soldiers', 'plight', 'fight', 'country', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'be', 'served', 'restaurant', 'scene', 'American', 'ice', 'cream', 'parlor', 'twist', 'group', 'openly', 'dance', 'flirt', 'local', 'women', 'debate', 'efforts', 'will', 'truly', 'have', 'impact', 'back', 'home', 'Conflict', 'racist', 'commanding', 'officer', 'threatens', 'undermine', 'everything', 'Nazis', 'march', 'town.Lee', 'adapted', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'James', 'McBride', '2004', 'novel', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'even', 'offer', 'quasi-sympathetic', 'Nazis-', 'one', 'officer', 'who', 'read', 'poetry', 'complaints', 'lack', 'food', 'supplies', 'deaf', 'ears', 'soldier', 'who', 'slaughter', 'civilians', 'cinematography', 'Matthew', 'J.', 'Libatique', 'least', 'as', 'sympathetic', 'Ernest', 'Dickerson', 'was', 'Lee', 'early', 'work', 'Lots', 'wide', 'shots', 'are', 'seen', 'Italian', 'countryside', 'giving', 'scope', 'how', 'overwhelmed', 'isolated', 'four', 'protagonists', 'are.The', 'film', 'lingers', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'few', 'scenes', 'villagers', 'sub-plot', 'involving', 'traitor', 'partisans', 'court', 'trial', 'epilogue', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'story', 'extremely', 'engaging', 'portrait', 'men', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'greatly', 'not', 'only', 'country', 'community', 'was', 'not', 'afforded', 'same', 'human', 'rights', 'were', 'being', 'defended', 'world', 'stage.Extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'here', 'hopefully', 'deluxe', '2-disc', 'edition', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'available']",Miracle at St Anna

I'm therefore stunned that there are so many negative reviews, and I can only posit that too many people came to the movie with rigid expectations or were just incapable of relating to the themes which are explored.  Those themes, set in the Italy of WWII, are numerous and masterfully layerered and interwoven: the horrors and pointlessness of war, romance and lust, bonds of family, care of children, empathy and brutality, betrayal and revenge, patriotism and alienation, existence of God and the problem of evil, death and afterlife, and especially racism and its transcendence.As one would expect from a Spike Lee movie, the acting, plot construction, scenery, soundtrack, etc. are all excellent, with the result that this movie is deeply powerful and gripping.  The three hours felt like one hour, and I expect to remember this movie for a long time.

1214658,AGCB3FQOLCTLU,B001LLH8S4,James W Polichak,"[5, 6]","As some others have said about the 1-star reviews, I don't know what movie they watched because it wasn't the one I watched.But we see two major errors in the negative reviews. So let's deal with them.1) ""all the white people are racist""This is so wrong it's amazing that anyone could claim it. The entire film revolves around the caring, even loving, relationships between white and black characters. Yes, there are some white racists. It's the 1940s.But let's go group by group.US Military Officers: we have roughly 3.First, there is the idiot racist junior officer who is immediately in charge of the main characters. He's the kind of man who refuses to believe what the troops on the ground say because they don't fit his mental understanding of what ""has to be the truth"". He also refuses to let there be any response to his orders. Yes, he's white and he's doing this to black troops. But this type of character exists in hundreds of war movies, and sends people to their deaths through their idiocy regardless of color, what war, what time in history.Because these people exist, and untold thousands of men have died because of their mental defects.Second, there is the brief appearance by a high-ranking officer who understands the situation and treats the black characters with respect. This character appears in countless films as well.Third, the MPs in the flashback to basic training in Mississippi. They attempt to prevent the conflict between the black soldiers and white shop-owner from escalating to violence. Let's call them neutral.Second, Nazis: we have a Nazi officer who commits atrocities and those who follow the orders to do so. We also have a Nazi officer and Nazi soldier who are critical to the miracle and subsequent acts. Saying too much would involve spoilers.Third, Italian Partisans: again, good and bad, and the difference is critical to the film.Fourth, Italian Civilians: the central relationship of the movie is one between a black soldier and a white civilian. Most of the rest of the Italians show nothing but positivity (or more) to the black soldiers. Again, there is a special, critical link between the black soldiers and the Italians that is very important but not going to spoil things.Fifth, US Civilians: There are those in the basic training flashback, who are typical racists for the most part. It's Mississippi in the 1940s. Then there are those who appear in the ""current"" time of the initial event. They are eager to do their job and show no concern about color. We even have a black woman put a white man with authority in his place, and he takes it.2) the ""over-sexed Negro"" stereotype.Again, this is just wrong, and it is due to failure to consider the range of characters.We have a group of young men in a new place. I can tell you with the utmost certainty that, regardless of color or anything else, a group of young men in a new place will include some who are looking for sexual relationships with new women. Many groups of men go to new places solely for this purpose. Many businesses and events exist primarily to facilitate the interaction of young men with women, and they make most of their money from the young men who are eager to pay for access to women.Now such a group of young men will very often feature two types who come into conflict. There is the nice guy, who wants to win over the woman by showing her respect and being realistic about their situation. He will also usually try to maintain group cohesion to a considerable effort.Then we have the young man who will make it his primary mission to get the woman. He will say whatever it takes, do whatever he can, to get her. He will push aside the nice guy. He will abandon the group. What he wants is the woman. It does not matter who the woman is. I have seen a friend gently stroking the arm of another friend's 60-something mother with a cast on her leg, in front of her husband, her brother, her son, and a bunch of his friends. When he left, we all looked around to say ""Did you just see what I saw?"" Yes, we did all see it.When Mr Raging Hormones gets the woman, the nice guy is angry at him, especially if he was essentially knocked out of the way. The nice guy is often more angry or disgusted at the woman. Either she was too foolish to see through the sex-hound's blandishments, or she saw them and accepted them.No ""over-sexed Negro"", just the dynamics of groups of young men with regard to women.Now let's think about film-making and stereotypes. A film is short. Miracle at St Anna is 160 minutes and that's long. The more characters a film has, the less time there is to spend on each of them. It is impossible to give every secondary, tertiary, there-for-a-few-seconds, character a unique complex personality. The result is that some characters must serve as a function, as a role, not as true characters, as individuals. The result will be that some characters are stereotypes.If this were an epic Band of Brothers type production, maybe we'd have fewer stereotypes. But even in Band of Brothers, David Schwimmer's idiot officer is the same person as the idiot officer in St Anna. He just got promoted out of combat duty. I'm sure we could go through the holy Saving Private Ryan and find a list of stereotypes as well. Did anyone think that Private Ryan, once found, would say ""Great! Get me out of here!"" instead of ""No way, I will fulfill my duty.""? No, that's not what the noble soldier does.But even in an epic-length production, we must remember that there is truth to some stereotypes. How many of us can say that there is no aspect of ourselves that is stereotypical of something: our age, our occupation, our gender, our race, our physical appearance?To get to the positive: This film is entirely about the complex relationships between black men and white men and women in a life-and-death situation in a foreign nation. The love between a black soldier and an Italian civilian is the central relationship in the film. The steps that a black man will take to avenge the evils done by white men motivate the telling of the tale.Black men treat white people as having supernatural spiritual powers. White people treat black men in the same way. We are dealing with miracles, and with people who believe in them. There is more, but we will avoid spoilers.But this film is ultimately about the care and love between black men and white men that transcends status and time.And there is one scene that is so heartbreaking that it brings tears to my eyes whenever I remember it, and it is powerful enough that it comes to my mind unbidden often enough that I had to buy this film several years after first seeing it. The moment would not go away, and should not go away.Those who see only stereotypes or nitpick at errors about what sayings or actions were in the film that were not common in the WW2 era are missing things that are so much more important that I feel sorry for them.See and feel the relationships, and find the miracles.

1214659,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B001LLH8S4,Jason Bean,"[4, 8]","I'll admit, Spike Lee is far from my favorite filmmaker. I like 'she's gotta have it' and 'Clockers' but was never taken with his later films like 'Summer Of Sam' and 'Inside Man'. 'Miracle at St Anna' has not only made me a fan again but it's easily one of the best films that I've seen concerning war and the impact it has on people.Starting with a murder in the 1980's, 'Miracle at St Anna' flashes back to a group of four Buffalo Soldiers during World War II. After an attack by the German's (and a disastrous call by their ignorant captain) soldiers Stamps, Cummings, Negron and Train end up behind enemy lines in Italy. Train finds a young Italian boy named Angelo and the soldiers take him to nearby village that's being exploited by both sides of the war. The characters find a sort of solace between enemy lines but of course the village has problems of it's own. This may sound typical and maybe heavy-handed but there's even MORE going on in this film than it seems. Eveything plays out in a sort of dream-like quality with some episodic moments that're both fascinating and engaging. Spike Lee's usual themes of racism and prejudice are in full-swing but they are only a few of the many elements at work.While the flash-forwards in the 1980's are filled with star-named actors like John Leguizamo, John Turturro and Joseph Gordan-Levitt it's really the lesser known actors in the WWII flashbacks that stand out. Derek Luke, Laz Alonso, Michael Ealy, and Omar Benson Miller as the four soldiers are exceptional. In fact I'm not really sure what the point was to the 1980's story, though it definitly grabs your attention at the beginning. I realize it was part of the original novel (by the screen writer James Mcbride) and the ending is quite moving, I'm just not sure how necessary it was.Like I said, 'Miracle at St Anna' is an excellent cinematic experience and is easily my favorite of Spike Lee's films to date.

But Spike Lee goes beyond those two narrow conceptions of war in Miracle At St. Anna. I think Mr. Lee is trying to capture the humanity and the miracle inherent in the human spirit.Lee takes us into the world of four black soldiers caught in a town behind enemy lines in Italy during World War II. Some of the clich&eacute;s of war movies exist here, the men of different backgrounds and different values thrown together because of war, but Lee doesn't use these clich&eacute;s so we can fill in the blanks he delves into the character of these men showing us their foibles, idiosyncrasies, their strengths, their humanness. And you care about the men and the experience they go through. This same depth of character isn't reserved for the Americans, Lee allows us to see that all the participants of war aren't necessarily hero's or villains but people caught up in something others have created but they share the capacities for loving their families, enduring the hardships of war, as well as the horror of seeing your friends and comrades die in horrible circumstances and extravagances that we all can be pushed to.Yes, the movie does have a couple sub-plots but none seem tacked on, an after thought, or distracting in fact those scenes add to our getting to know the characters better they are an organic part of the movie.I was disappointed by the lack of special features, I usually like the making of documentaries, but every DVD doesn't need to have a gag reel. & the quality of the movie more than makes up for the lack of extras.I think this may be the first fully actualized war movie I've ever seen.

However, this being a World War II movie got my attention especially since it is about an aspect of World War II that doesn't get alot of attention (even during the war), the Italian Campaign.I knew there were black Army units but I thought they mostly stuck to supply (the Red Ball Express).  I didn't realize there were black combat units until a few years ago.  Shame really because it sounds like many of them showed valor along the lines of the Japanese-American units.The scene that really bothers me is the scene where they try to get Ice Cream in Alabama and are refused service, unless they go to the back.

1214667,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B001LLH8S4,Kevin R. Austra,"[5, 8]","Leonard Nimoy said it best years ago when he wrote that a director cannot ride a bad script.  In MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA there are great actors, locations, and military hardware.  The problem is that they go nowhere with the story.  Add to an already lame screenplay other half developed subplots and bizarre occurrences and you have MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA.This could have been a great war film about the 92nd Infantry Division ""Buffalo Soldiers.""  Having spent considerable time assigned to Fort Huachuca, Arizona I am quite familiar with the history of the Buffalo Soldiers.  They certainly deserved better than this film.Summary:  An aging veteran shoots a man with a luger.  In the subsequent police investigation they locate a sculptured marble head in the veteran's apartment.  The film then flashes back to 1944 Italy and a squad of GI's caught behind German lines.  The squad from the 92nd Infantry Division ends up dragging along extra baggage in the way of a shell shocked Italian youth, a marble statue head, Italian resistance fighters, and a solitary German prisoner.  The soldiers move into an unoccupied Italian village and wait for something to happen while at the same time voicing their own voluminous personal agendas.In the soldiers' midst is an Italian traitor who betrays them to the Germans.  At the point of being relieved by elements of their Infantry Division the Germans counterattack and decimate the relief force and all but one of the squad members.  The film then moves back to the 1980s and rejoins the pre-trial hearing involving the shooting incident.In addition to the main story there are also the side stories including the massacre at St. Anna, German soldier gone AWOL, the shell shocked Italian boy summoning up images of his dead friend, and a German captain questioning his colonel's implausible Nazi idealism.I had high hopes for this film.  Instead it does not even come close to films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS.  In watching the film I was rooting for the squad to succeed, but could not understand why they were loitering about in the village.  The other detractor in the film was historical accuracy.  Although the massacre at St. Anna is based on a true event it became a sideline event in this film.  I also could not help noticing some of the mismatched German SS and army insignia on some of the soldiers.There is also too little of actor Christian Berkel in this film.  Berkel has appeared in several war films as a German soldier such as DOWNFALL, BLACK BOOK, and VALKYRIE.  In fact in ST. ANNA Berkel also appeared with Waldemar Kobur who also had supporting roles in BLACK BOOK and VALKYRIE.  Berkel's role as the German officer who spares the last GI in the squad is fleeting at best and is part of one of those subplots that just never developed properly.The final street battle scene is fairly impressive and to some extent redeems the end of the movie in the same way that the final battle scene of CASTLE KEEP brought some measure of excitement to an otherwise lackluster film.",2,Disappointing Outing for Spike Lee,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,3053,"['Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'said', 'best', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'wrote', 'director', 'can', 'not', 'ride', 'bad', 'script', 'MIRACLE', 'AT', 'ST.', 'ANNA', 'are', 'great', 'actors', 'locations', 'military', 'hardware', 'problem', 'go', 'nowhere', 'story', 'Add', 'already', 'lame', 'screenplay', 'other', 'half', 'developed', 'subplots', 'bizarre', 'occurrences', 'have', 'MIRACLE', 'AT', 'ST.', 'ANNA.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'war', 'film', '92nd', 'Infantry', 'Division', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'Having', 'spent', 'considerable', 'time', 'assigned', 'Fort', 'Huachuca', 'Arizona', 'am', 'quite', 'familiar', 'history', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'better', 'film.Summary', 'aging', 'veteran', 'shoots', 'man', 'luger', 'subsequent', 'police', 'investigation', 'locate', 'sculptured', 'marble', 'head', 'veteran', 'apartment', 'film', 'then', 'back', '1944', 'Italy', 'squad', 'GI', 'caught', 'German', 'lines', 'squad', '92nd', 'Infantry', 'Division', 'up', 'dragging', 'extra', 'baggage', 'way', 'shell', 'shocked', 'Italian', 'youth', 'marble', 'statue', 'head', 'Italian', 'resistance', 'fighters', 'solitary', 'German', 'prisoner', 'soldiers', 'move', 'unoccupied', 'Italian', 'village', 'wait', 'something', 'happen', 'same', 'time', 'voicing', 'own', 'voluminous', 'personal', 'agendas.In', 'soldiers', 'midst', 'Italian', 'traitor', 'who', 'Germans', 'point', 'being', 'relieved', 'elements', 'Infantry', 'Division', 'Germans', 'counterattack', 'decimate', 'relief', 'force', 'one', 'squad', 'members', 'film', 'then', 'back', '1980s', 'pre-trial', 'hearing', 'involving', 'shooting', 'incident.In', 'addition', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'also', 'side', 'including', 'massacre', 'St.', 'Anna', 'German', 'gone', 'AWOL', 'shell', 'shocked', 'Italian', 'boy', 'summoning', 'up', 'images', 'dead', 'friend', 'German', 'captain', 'questioning', 'colonel', 'implausible', 'Nazi', 'idealism.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'film', 'Instead', 'not', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'films', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'FLAGS', 'OUR', 'FATHERS', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'rooting', 'squad', 'succeed', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'were', 'loitering', 'about', 'village', 'other', 'detractor', 'film', 'was', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'massacre', 'St.', 'Anna', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'became', 'sideline', 'event', 'film', 'also', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'noticing', 'mismatched', 'German', 'SS', 'army', 'insignia', 'soldiers.There', 'also', 'too', 'little', 'actor', 'Christian', 'Berkel', 'film', 'Berkel', 'appeared', 'several', 'war', 'films', 'German', 'soldier', 'such', 'DOWNFALL', 'BLACK', 'BOOK', 'VALKYRIE', 'fact', 'ST.', 'ANNA', 'Berkel', 'also', 'appeared', 'Waldemar', 'Kobur', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'supporting', 'roles', 'BLACK', 'BOOK', 'VALKYRIE', 'Berkel', 'role', 'German', 'officer', 'who', 'last', 'GI', 'squad', 'fleeting', 'best', 'part', 'one', 'subplots', 'just', 'never', 'developed', 'properly.The', 'final', 'street', 'battle', 'scene', 'fairly', 'impressive', 'extent', 'end', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'CASTLE', 'KEEP', 'brought', 'measure', 'excitement', 'otherwise', 'lackluster', 'film']",Miracle at St Anna

However, whenever he attacks an ambitious theme, he seems to ""over produce"". Here, he directs James McBride's screenplay about the courageous contribution of African-American soldiers in WWII, something which has been overlooked by every contemporary filmmaker from John Ford to Clint Eastwood. Lee's foray into epic war movies sadly backfires. The opening scene was unexpected and powerful, leaving you to believe that something really exciting would follow. NOT! The lack of character development and muddled plot lines result in us not getting a sense for these 4 soldiers from the all-black 92nd Infantry Division trapped in a village in Tuscany with Germans closing in. The location shots are lush and the soundtrack provides the suspense and pathos lacking in the dialogue and acting. The actors' efforts are lost in a film almost entirely in Italian or German WITH SUBTITLES! It's hard enough to follow along without having to read dialogue. Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Laz Alonso are excellent in their thin feature parts. However, Omar Benson Miller is miscast in a pivotal role as a Forrest Whitaker wannabee who talks like minstrel player. His bumbling teddy bear shuffle-along act quickly got on my nerves. Also, I blinked and completely missed Kerry Washington!

After lambasting Clint Eastwood - not to say his accusations were specious - in collaboration with the screenwriter James McBride, he ends up committing comparable indiscretions and taking too long in doing so..  I had a hard time in staying in the appropriate era, as the actors voiced present era interpretations of Vietnam Era mentalities in a film about a black squadron in World War II. Black soldiers of that era were alienated from white peers however they were of similar mind regarding the cause. It was not a perception of fighting ""the white man's war,"" it was an opportunity to advance the premise of equality by demonstration of bravery, valor and patriotism commensurate with any other soldier, with the objective of securing a non-segregated seat at America's diverse ethnic table.At the core, this story of  four black soldiers who in part due to the bigotry and incompetence of their company commander find themselves isolated behind enemy lines and forced to fend for themselves by establishing a partnership with the Italian locals.  Over the course of interaction each member of each group is required to overcome biases, both internal and external, as well as inculcated beliefs of the value of another human being.There is much to be commended in MASA, starting with the aspiration to bring the story of the Buffalo soldiers to a wider audience; often the cinematography of the Italian countryside is breathtaking and although I had personal reservations regarding the infusion of ""trickster"" role from the African American oral tradition, for many viewers the underlying story of sublimation of self-interest in the course of transition  to selfless dedication and sacrifice for the benefit of another will be appealing.Unfortunately, far too many characters are portrayed as caricatures; the Germans are nearly all heartless executioners of a meagerly defensible people, while essentially every aspect of the African Diaspora was ineffectually and superficially infused in the roles of a mere four  men.

After watching it on DVD, I regretted that decision.While ""Miracle at St. Anna"" isn't perfect, it's entertaining and moving, with some powerful scenes sure to hit the emotions.Many critics have labeled it a mess, but I don't quite see the mess they're speaking of.It seems they're not used to Spike Lee's method of filmmaking. His ""joints"" can seem disjointed. But I personally thought he toned down some of his more eccentric idiosyncrasies.I've also read that many people are wondering what exactly is the ""miracle."" What I like about this movie is that it doesn't highlight what the miracle is. It leaves it up to us, the viewer -- something that most big movies don't do, as they'd rather spoonfeed us, hold our hands and explain EVERYTHING, so we don't have to think or make our own decisions.I also have another response to those critics who say Spike Lee presented the main white character as a stereotypical, one-dimensional racist. That may be so, but in doing so, he's presenting a litmus test for those same individuals who are quick to point out ""racism"" directed toward white characters, but have yet to criticize ongoing racism toward minorities, in both film and real life.This movie was better than I thought it would be. It's nowhere near the train wreck that critics and others tried to make it out to be. I believe their criticism of this movie was more directed at Spike Lee, than the movie itself.Spike Lee kept the sentimentality to a minimum (something that Spielberg couldn't help himself to do with in his otherwise great movie Saving Private Ryan, nor could Eastwood achieve in his similarly good movie Letters From Iwo Jima).And it was a surprise to find out which character would survive at the end. That's something that most filmmakers give away long before the film's conclusion.Viewers should put aside their dislike of Spike Lee, and not go with the majority of self-absorbed critics, and see how Miracle at St. Anna, despite its flaws, is still a rich movie.",3,"Not perfect, but moving slice of history-based fiction",1242432000,"05 16, 2009",2009,2105,"['hearing', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movie', 'avoided', 'seeing', 'theater', 'watching', 'DVD', 'regretted', 'decision.While', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'sure', 'hit', 'emotions.Many', 'critics', 'have', 'labeled', 'mess', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'mess', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'of.It', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'method', 'filmmaking', 'joints', 'can', 'seem', 'disjointed', 'personally', 'thought', 'toned', 'down', 'more', 'eccentric', 'idiosyncrasies.I', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'miracle', 'What', 'like', 'movie', ""n't"", 'highlight', 'what', 'miracle', 'up', 'viewer', 'something', 'most', 'big', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', ""'d"", 'rather', 'spoonfeed', 'hold', 'hands', 'explain', 'EVERYTHING', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'make', 'own', 'decisions.I', 'also', 'have', 'response', 'critics', 'who', 'say', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'presented', 'main', 'white', 'character', 'stereotypical', 'one-dimensional', 'racist', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'doing', 'so', 'presenting', 'litmus', 'test', 'same', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'racism', 'directed', 'white', 'characters', 'have', 'yet', 'criticize', 'ongoing', 'racism', 'minorities', 'film', 'real', 'life.This', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'nowhere', 'train', 'wreck', 'critics', 'others', 'tried', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'believe', 'criticism', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'directed', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movie', 'itself.Spike', 'Lee', 'kept', 'sentimentality', 'minimum', 'something', 'Spielberg', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'do', 'otherwise', 'great', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'could', 'Eastwood', 'achieve', 'similarly', 'good', 'movie', 'Letters', 'Iwo', 'Jima', '.And', 'was', 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'character', 'would', 'survive', 'end', 'something', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'give', 'away', 'long', 'film', 'conclusion.Viewers', 'should', 'put', 'aside', 'dislike', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'not', 'go', 'majority', 'self-absorbed', 'critics', 'see', 'how', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'flaws', 'still', 'rich', 'movie']",Miracle at St Anna

Mr Lee, however, does know how to direct a movie, and this is a fairly good one.  It's about 4 black American soldiers trapped behind German lines in late 1944 Italy with a turncoat ex-partisan guerilla double-crossing his former friends.  Great cinematography lends an authentic feel to the movie showing the wonderful Italian countryside. The dialogue is fine, but the movie lacks suspense. What better way to build suspense than to have trapped people with a double-crosser amongst them and the enemy all around? Sadly, that doesn't happen here, and hurts the movie. Now, about subliminal messages: Mr Lee is no different from other directors who put messages about racism, etc...in their movie. Even Steven Speilberg awkwardly placed several messages about Jewish soldiers in ""Saving Pvt Ryan"".  That didn't detract from the movie, and the same holds true here. Let's face it, the black soldiers faced tough times down south and German and Italian POWs were sometimes treated better than those soldiers.  The only dumb scene was near the end when Pvt Negron was given a pistol by a German officer, and the next minute the American reinforcements arrive.  It'd have been better if he got the luger off a dead German soldier, and there was some brief battle scene allowing Negron to escape. Other than that, its a pretty well-done movie.

More specifically, it is the story of 4 black soldiers separated from their unit who come into contact with a young Italian boy and a family of Italian peasants. One of the soldiers particularly takes a liking to the traumatized boy-and his imaginary friend-and sort of ""adopts"" the boy as his own. In turn, the boy calls his new friend his ""chocolate giant."" The story is very Christian and religion is a major factor in bringing together these people from two completely different worlds. The brutal racism of the era is also well depicted and there seems to be sort of an epiphany on the part of the black soldiers when they come into contact with these ""white folks"" who do not treat them like animals.I'm not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but I do think he is a talented filmmaker who has made some quality films. Thus, I was disappointed with what I would regard as a somewhat amateurish production. The story was moving and had a lot of potential, but I think Lee blew it here. The battle sequences were awkward, the dialogue was often weak and inane, and too many of the characters were exaggerated to the point of near caricatures.

1214689,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001LLH8S4,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 7]","**1/2Over the course of the last few decades, war movies have become so unflinchingly brutal and authentic in their depiction of life on the battlefield that they've become all but impossible to sit through - and I say this as a compliment, not as a denigration.  They SHOULD be impossible to sit through.  This IS war we're talking about after all.That being said, it should also be pointed out that ""The Miracle at St. Anna"" - a highly fictionalized account of an actual event - devotes only a minimal amount of time to carnage and bloodshed as it unfolds its story of four African-American soldiers (Laz Alonso, Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Omar Benson Miller) trapped behind enemy lines in Italy during the closing days of WW II.  The film recounts their experiences with sympathetic villagers, anti-Fascist partisan fighters, Nazi soldiers (of both good and bad stripe), an orphaned boy they take under their wing and, of course, the requisite beautiful Italian peasant girl (Valentina Cervi) who wears tight sweaters and has a steamy encounter with one of the men.This latest work by Spike Lee certainly has its heart in the right place and there are scenes of undeniable intensity and power where he once again demonstrates his bona fides as a director of genuine vision and power (the brutal massacre of a group of unarmed villagers at the hands of the Nazis - the one truly nonfiction moment in the story - is the emotional high point of the movie).Yet, the movie, as a whole, adds up to much less than the sum of its parts, a victim of both overreaching and over-length (the movie takes a full two hours and 40 minutes to tell its story).  Interestingly, the screenplay by James McBride (based on his novel) suffers from trying to do too much and too little at one and the same time.  At some points, it seems as if he is doing his best to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the narrative mix, while, at others, the movie feels thin and underdeveloped, with the characters stuck for long stretches of time in a storyline that doesn`t seem to be going anywhere all that interesting or dramatic.  The diffuse and meandering plot drains the film of much of its narrative and emotional energy, and the movie is further hampered by the use of an uninteresting murder subplot - set in the 1980s - as an all too conventional framing device for the main story.  It is in these scenes, in particular, where Lee's grand opera style of filmmaking - bolstered by Terence Blanchard's melodramatic score - most threatens to fall over the edge into pretentiousness.  Moreover, the bathos and low comedy that frequently creep into the writing, as well as the fact that the four men seem more like clearly differentiated ""types"" than fully-rounded human beings, serve to undercut the generally fine performances by a large and gifted cast.Apart from the gripping war-is-hell scenes, ""The Miracle at St Anna"" is at its best when it's focusing on the bitter irony of men being called upon to do their patriotic duty of fighting and dying in a foreign land - all for a country that forces them to serve in black-only units in the field and to eat in segregated diners back home.  One of the characters even confesses, at one point, that he feels more ""free"" and accepted in Italy than he does in the United States.There's probably a first-rate two-hour-long movie buried somewhere in the midst of ""The Miracle at St. Anna.""

1214695,A3A3490HHAZIB2,B001LLH8S4,Stacy K.,"[25, 36]","As it happens, the US 92nd Infantry Division was a dumping ground for incompetent white officers.  The general staff operated on the assumption that these imcompetents would do the least damage, overall, commanding Negro soldiers, who were generally tolerated by the white man's army only at the insistence of the Roosevelt Administration.  The high percentage of bad reviews this excellent and historically accurate movie has received has little to do with the movie itself, and everything to do with the persistence of institutional and structural racism in the US, because this movie is, as I say, painstakingly accurate.  It is worth noting that the full range of racial attitudes are depicted here among every group.  For instance, a second white company commander informs the divisional commander of why these men were isolated on the far side of a river their own company commander insists they didn't cross.  White MPs intervene on behalf of the black soldiers who were denied service at a cafe in Mississippi, to no avail.  A German officer stops a man under his command from shooting a wounded and unarmed black American.  The black soldiers in this movie also represent the full range of men serving in the 92nd; just as white soldiers were not all exemplary, neither was every black man heroic simply because he was black.  But this isn't just a war movie, it is also a complex mystery, which also makes it enigmatic to the typical Clint Eastwood/John Wayne fan.

1214698,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B001LLH8S4,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[2, 5]","I can't shake the feeling that one of the reasons that Spike Lee did this film, besides the fact that the story focuses on a portion of the Buffalo Soldiers, was the fact that Lee (and others) was (were) so disappointed in the lack of acknowledgement of African-Americans in Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers.  Those with short memories may already have forgotten, or perhaps didn't even know, that there was a tiff between Eastwood and Lee over the lack of minority (read: African-American) representation in Eastwood's much hyped film.Moving along past that feeling, Miracle at St. Anna focuses on a group of Buffalo Soldiers that are cut-off from their unit after crossing a river.  The men wind up in a Tuscan village, behind enemy lines, trying to hold out until they can escape or be rescued.  Without a working radio to contact their unit, unable to speak the language (for the most part), and not sure who to trust around them as things in the village just don't seem quite right.Throw in racial tension that comes from flash backs, a company commander that is an obvious redneck bigot, and others along the way just to make sure the story really uses all of the long running time to score points about racism during World War II and previously, and perhaps a lot since.I'd like to say Miracle at St. Anna is a good film, but unfortunately several things detracted from that rating for me along the way.  Parts of the film did, as another reviewer notes, seem out of place and/or felt like they were shoe-horned in.  Are scenes missing that would have helped make it all flow better and make more sense?  I don't know, but it all comes through somewhat forced.  Thrown on top of the scenes dealing with racism at points not directly related to the on-going story line, you get the feeling that Lee should have cut those portions while expanding other.On top of all of that the musical score is obnoxiously melodramatic for my tastes and distracts from the film more than enhances it.  The volume levels for the score drown out action and dialogue at times and just plain makes the film seemed all the more forced.What could have been and should have been a more enjoyable film watching experience instead was less than I wanted and hoped for.  On the plus side, the featurette about the Buffalo Soldiers is interesting, the action sequences are fairly good (with a few notable exceptions: one scene with the Chocolate Giant carrying what was obviously a doll was laughably fake, as well as a few other scenes that just don't come off as well as they should), and the main story line is actually interesting, despite it too being shoe-horned into semi-current events in a way that leaves you thinking all along about what really links those events with the events that we're watching.Picture quality on the Blu-ray is quite nice, but again the audio seems to distract (due to the musical score) more than it should.In summary: a film that should have been better, shorter, and more tightly packaged.

1214702,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001LLH8S4,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 6]","With all respect to the filmmakers including the director Spike Lee, ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is a big misfire. I don't say the film is unwatchable, but after sitting through the overlong film that deals with such important historical events as the ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" all African-American regiments in the U.S. army, my impression was simply this: ""What is the point?""The film begins with a murder at a post office in New York City in 1983. Before a rookie news reporter, the arrested elder postal worker Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) recounts his experiences during the WWII in Italy, 1944, when he and three other black soldiers were trapped in a small village while fighting the German army. The frame story is a bit too long, but effective enough to lead us to the story within it.""Miracle at St. Anna"" is part a war movie with several combat scenes, which are pretty bloody. But basically the film is about the four soldiers (played by Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso and Omar Benson Miller), and a group of Italians they encounter. There are a few subplots including a strange boy who seems to speak with his invisible friend. Private Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller who looks like young Forest Whitaker) tries to protect him.I know the film is based on a work of fiction (by James McBride and the screenplay was adapted by the writer too), not a documentary about true events in Italy during WWII and the ""Buffalo Soldiers."" Also, I understand it is only natural that the story revolves around the four fictional soldiers. We need someone we can relate to.Unfortunately in this film there is none we can relate to. These characters - most Italians and Germans too - are all types at best, conventional and flat, repeatedly used in other films. The narrative is also confusing with one flashback within flashback.With its rambling narrative and too many cameos (talented actors like John Leguizamo appear briefly, apparently only to prolong the story) that are detracts the viewers from the main story, ""Miracles at St. Anna"" is a typical example of too many things going on, blurring the meaning of the ""miracle"" of the title, and more importantly, the historical importance of the ""Buffalo Soldiers.""",2,Too Many Things Going On,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,2206,"['respect', 'filmmakers', 'including', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'big', 'misfire', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'unwatchable', 'sitting', 'overlong', 'film', 'deals', 'such', 'important', 'historical', 'events', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'African-American', 'regiments', 'U.S.', 'army', 'impression', 'was', 'simply', 'What', 'point', 'film', 'murder', 'post', 'office', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1983', 'rookie', 'news', 'reporter', 'arrested', 'elder', 'postal', 'worker', 'Aubrey', 'Stamps', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'experiences', 'WWII', 'Italy', '1944', 'when', 'three', 'other', 'black', 'soldiers', 'were', 'trapped', 'small', 'village', 'fighting', 'German', 'army', 'frame', 'story', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'effective', 'enough', 'lead', 'story', 'Miracle', 'St.', 'Anna', 'part', 'war', 'movie', 'several', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'bloody', 'basically', 'film', 'four', 'soldiers', 'played', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Michael', 'Ealy', 'Laz', 'Alonso', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'group', 'Italians', 'encounter', 'are', 'few', 'subplots', 'including', 'strange', 'boy', 'who', 'speak', 'invisible', 'friend', 'Private', 'Sam', 'Train', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'who', 'young', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'protect', 'him.I', 'know', 'film', 'based', 'work', 'fiction', 'James', 'McBride', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'writer', 'too', 'not', 'documentary', 'true', 'events', 'Italy', 'WWII', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers', 'Also', 'understand', 'only', 'natural', 'story', 'four', 'fictional', 'soldiers', 'need', 'someone', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Unfortunately', 'film', 'none', 'can', 'relate', 'characters', 'most', 'Italians', 'Germans', 'too', 'are', 'types', 'best', 'conventional', 'flat', 'repeatedly', 'used', 'other', 'films', 'narrative', 'also', 'confusing', 'one', 'flashback', 'flashback.With', 'rambling', 'narrative', 'too', 'many', 'cameos', 'talented', 'actors', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'appear', 'briefly', 'apparently', 'only', 'prolong', 'story', 'are', 'viewers', 'main', 'story', 'Miracles', 'St.', 'Anna', 'typical', 'example', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'blurring', 'meaning', 'miracle', 'title', 'more', 'importantly', 'historical', 'importance', 'Buffalo', 'Soldiers']",Miracle at St Anna
1214703,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001LLH8S4,Turfseer,"[4, 7]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***While the history of the African-American combat soldiers in World War II has been told before (for example Danny Glover's 1997 TV Movie ""Buffalo Soldiers""), it's a subject that's well worth being told from a new and fresh perspective. So here Spike Lee has decided to adapt Jame McBride's book which tells the story of the four black 'Buffalo Soldiers' of the 92nd Infantry Division, stuck inside an Italian town behind German lines during World War II.The idea that the protagonist, Hector Negron, has been waiting for years working inside the post office in New York City, with a gun at his side, hoping that one day the Italian partisan who betrayed him and his unit and all the Italian people he had befriended during the war, would simply walk in and ask to buy some stamps, seems quite far-fetched. In the book, Negron has the gun for protection but even if that were the case, wouldn't one of his co-workers have noticed that the gun was there in all the years he was working at the post office? Even worse is all the time wasted on introducing the reporter and the police detective who are investigating the shooting. All we really needed was to show the shooting, cut to the detective interviewing Negron for a about a minute and then flashback to the war.Spike Lee never tires in reminding us of the extent of the discrimination suffered by the black soldiers in World War II by their commanding officers. I didn't find it unbelievable that the racist officer Nokes would order artillery fire on the Buffalo soldiers' position simply because he couldn't believe that the soldiers were capable of making it to the other side of the river despite being surrounded by a whole slew of Germans. By the same token, it wasn't unreasonable to believe that the Germans would broadcast propaganda toward the black soldiers through a loudspeaker during the battle. Lee wants us to see the irony as the Germans remind the black soldiers that they're fighting for a government who treats them like second class citizens. But why does Lee focus on the propaganda broadcast for so long? We get the point in the first thirty seconds but it just goes on and on; one gets the impression that Lee revels in driving the point home despite adding unnecessary minutes to the narrative.Another example of Spike Lee overkill is the flashback to the diner a year before down south. The flashback is in two parts. The first part is the good one where we see the four Buffalo soldiers being told to eat out back by the racist store owner as four German POW's are chowing down in plain view. But then Lee undermines that excellent sequence by having the Buffalo soldiers return, point their weapons at the store owner and ask for him to serve them. Just like Tarantino who fulfills an adolescent need for revenge by having Hitler unrealistically killed in 'Inglourious Basterds', Lee does the same thing here, with the full knowledge that in real life, the Buffalo soldiers would have been court-martialed or even worse, ended up lynched for threatening a white store owner.Some have said that Spike Lee is hypocritical after his denunciation of the James Coffey prisoner character in the movie 'The Green Mile'. Lee coined the term ""the magical Negro"", defined in Wikipedia as ""a supporting, sometimes mystical stock character in fiction who, by use of special insight or powers, helps the white protagonist get out of trouble."" The magical Negro is ""in some way outwardly or inwardly disabled, either by discrimination, disability or social constraint."" And isn't that what Private Samuel Train is? He's a simpleton who sacrifices himself for the young white protagonist, Angelo. While I thought the child actor who plays the young boy was quite good, was it all that necessary to have him refer to Train as the 'chocolate soldier' ad nauseum? There comes a point when 'cute' becomes 'obnoxious'.The middle of the 'Miracle' gets bogged down with a series of slow-moving scenes including Train's interactions with the boy, the soldiers' discussions with the Italian villagers and the extensive machinations of the partisans. Although probably anachronistic, I did enjoy Bishop's conflict with Cummings which involved the issue of black collaboration with whites. Bishop's position, which advocates that progress has been made by blacks via-a-vis a white racist society, was probably more reflective of the 1940s than Cummings' militant viewpoint, which basically advocated separatism and sounded like it came from someone who was active in the 1960s and beyond. Bishop and Cummings also come to blows over the Italian woman, Renata, which is another way in which Lee attempts to 'humanize' his characters. One truism is revealed: women will take 'bad boys' over 'ordinary guys' any day.Lee's penchant for 'balance' may give the wrong impression about the German soldier in World War II. They were just as bad in regards to committing atrocities as the specialized 'Nazi' units. Yes there could have been a 'good' German office such as Eicholz, the former English teacher and the deserter Han Brandt, who ended up saving Angelo, but they were the exception to the rule. And even many so-called ""good"" Germans agreed in principle that the Jewish people were less than sub-human and needed to be segregated, deported or even eliminated in one way or another. One thing is certain: Eicholz handing his own gun over to Negron at the film's denouement would never have happened.'Miracle' could have been a good film with extensive editing as well as Lee's toning down of all the heavy-handed moralizing. It also wouldn't have hurt to pare down the soundtrack which unfortunately underscores the dialogue throughout the entire film. Because Lee is bent on throwing in the kitchen sink, he leaves us with an 'epic' that's overlong and clumsy with too many subplots coupled with an obvious anachronistic perspective.",3,Preacher Lee's

I got tired of the whole Train character in about two seconds. And the Italian woman with the glorious breasts was nice but then they have her say that she is married and then develop some kind of emotional thing with one guy then turn around and have sex with the other guy and then right before she dies she redeems her virtue by looking at the 'good guy' and saying his name as if to say, ""it was you that I wanted... but the other guy was just so damned smooth that I couldn't stop myself'. This movie was ridiculous up to the very end when SPOILER ALERT 'Seat Belts' becomes a great revelation.That big stupid 100 pound bowling ball of a statue head that the big stupid idiot carries around for the entire movie was just that SToOpId. And so were other things like the newspaper fling out the window when John Leguizamo (who is in the movie for no other reason)is having his morning coffee and sex to land on just the right guys table at just the right time. This stupid junk was also seen when the mail man just happens to have just that one guy come up to his window and he just happens to have that gun.The only part I liked was the part of the Italian partisan 'The Butterfly' and I wish they would have done more with him.This movie was just plain bad.

I understand he wants to evolve his filmaking skills but this subject matter just doesn't suit him.  I got the impression he was overthinking the whole project and tryint too hard.  It was like he wanted to finally make his grand sweeping epic.  This was like Spike lee trying to do The English Patient or Titanic.  After 2 hours of trying to absorb this film, I became exhausted with all the tired, drawn out meaningless dialogue and the cast of thousands!  there were just WAY TOO MANY characters and subplots and too many points trying to be made.  And the languages!  There were like 4 different dialects, italian, german, puerto rican, jamaican, aagh! I also didn't like that 2/3 of the movie seem to be subtitles.  I don't mind if a whole movie is in subtitles, or just a few scenes here and there.  but this movie had every other scene in subtitles, it's like make up your mind! And if one more character said ""boom boom"", I was going to boom boom on the dvd.  The scenes with the child and the buffalo solider were borderline disturbing calling him a ""chocolate giant"", and the other soldiers constantly offering ""chocolate"" to everyone, chocolate, chocolate!  It almost seemed like there was something else goin' on.  I think this film would have been fantastic if it shed alot of the characters and dialogue and just focused on one subject. LESS IS MORE.  I did like the scene where the nazi woman broadcaster was talkin' sh** while the soldiers were crossing the river, that was classic Spike Lee.  The rest of the film had no focus and was ill-conceived.

1214706,A22FOZ8JT0BJ80,B001LLH8S4,"zx2781 ""zx2781""","[141, 191]","I had wanted to like this movie so much. As much as I wanted to like Windtalkers. Both had potential to be really great but were unable to rise above an absolutely juvenile and cheesy script.  I am an avid WWII buff and I give alot of license to war movies and don't pick them apart for their accuracy or lack there of but this one not only insults the viewer but the legacy of the 92nd/Buffalo.The Good : Absolutely beautiful cinematography. If you could mute the sound (dialogue) one might think they were watching a pretty decent WWII era movie. Battle scenes were shot well. Uniforms were pretty dead on accurate and the weapons were accurate although  Thompson SMGs  and 1911 .45 caliber HGs did not have 100 round clips......The Bad : Awful and embarrassing dialogue embellished with overacting which made it almost comical. Obligatory nudity. Soldiers using language and phrases that would be used only today. A German louspeaker that blares Axis Sally's propaganda for several square miles over the battlefield and is audible to all. Fragmented story with a total lack of cohesion (like this review). My favorite is the commanding white officer (Nokes?) stating that the Germans were going to cause a race riot by piping in the propaganda. I think that those valiant soldiers were more interested in staying alive and protecting their comrades than starting a race riot in Italy under fire. But then again this shows the mentality of Spike Lee and the writer.The Ugly :  All white officers and soldiers portrayed as bigoted haters.  In one instance  the commanding officer refuses to believe members of the 92nd crossed the river so does not send supporting artillery strikes. His reasoning for this is ""He is lying"".This same commanding officer condescendingly orders a black soldier to get him water. The black soldier spits into the canteen before giving it to white officer. Not only does this lower the mentality of the movie several notches but  also slanders the memory of those brave men of the 92nd/Buffalo that fought for their country.This movie had potential, unfortunately it was executed by someone who was unable to deliver. It is filled with contemporary language, modern topics of discussion,  poor acting, and endless preaching about the evils of  America. Spike Lee had scolded Clint Eastwood for not having any African Americans in Iwo Jima and had wanted him to rewrite history. Well, Spike has done that with this movie.",1,High hopes for St. Anna,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2450,"['had', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'As', 'much', 'wanted', 'Windtalkers', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'really', 'great', 'were', 'unable', 'rise', 'absolutely', 'juvenile', 'cheesy', 'script', 'am', 'avid', 'WWII', 'buff', 'give', 'alot', 'license', 'war', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'apart', 'accuracy', 'lack', 'there', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'insults', 'viewer', 'legacy', '92nd/Buffalo.The', 'Good', 'Absolutely', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'could', 'mute', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'were', 'watching', 'pretty', 'decent', 'WWII', 'era', 'movie', 'Battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'shot', 'well', 'Uniforms', 'were', 'pretty', 'dead', 'accurate', 'weapons', 'were', 'accurate', 'Thompson', 'SMGs', '1911', '.45', 'caliber', 'HGs', 'did', 'not', 'have', '100', 'round', 'clips', 'Bad', 'Awful', 'embarrassing', 'dialogue', 'embellished', 'overacting', 'made', 'almost', 'comical', 'Obligatory', 'nudity', 'Soldiers', 'using', 'language', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'only', 'today', 'German', 'louspeaker', 'Axis', 'Sally', 'propaganda', 'several', 'square', 'miles', 'battlefield', 'audible', 'Fragmented', 'story', 'total', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'review', 'favorite', 'commanding', 'white', 'officer', 'Nokes', 'stating', 'Germans', 'were', 'going', 'cause', 'race', 'riot', 'piping', 'propaganda', 'think', 'valiant', 'soldiers', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'staying', 'alive', 'protecting', 'comrades', 'starting', 'race', 'riot', 'Italy', 'fire', 'then', 'again', 'mentality', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'writer.The', 'Ugly', 'white', 'officers', 'soldiers', 'portrayed', 'bigoted', 'haters', 'one', 'instance', 'commanding', 'officer', 'believe', 'members', '92nd', 'crossed', 'river', 'so', 'not', 'send', 'supporting', 'artillery', 'strikes', 'reasoning', 'lying', '.This', 'same', 'commanding', 'officer', 'condescendingly', 'orders', 'black', 'soldier', 'get', 'water', 'black', 'soldier', 'spits', 'canteen', 'giving', 'white', 'officer', 'Not', 'only', 'lower', 'mentality', 'movie', 'several', 'notches', 'also', 'memory', 'brave', 'men', '92nd/Buffalo', 'fought', 'country.This', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'executed', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'deliver', 'filled', 'contemporary', 'language', 'modern', 'topics', 'discussion', 'poor', 'acting', 'endless', 'preaching', 'evils', 'America', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'had', 'scolded', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'having', 'African', 'Americans', 'Iwo', 'Jima', 'had', 'wanted', 'rewrite', 'history', 'Well', 'Spike', 'done', 'movie']",Miracle at St Anna
