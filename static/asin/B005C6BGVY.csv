Well, I am glad to say that her short appearance didn't hurt this entry in the series one bit. Eating Out: Drama Camp may actually be the funniest in the whole series, thanks to hilarious performances from Drew Droege as Dick Dickey, and Mink Stole. There's also plenty of nudity and sexual shenanigans on display as well, but that's to be expected from this series.

The boys, and some girls, as well as a transgender character, compete for an acting prize, while trying to keep their libidos under control (a camp rule), which isn't easy.Like the first three films in this series, this is a very cartoonish but entertaining romp, filled with sight gags, overacting and unrealistic situations, with lots of hot, buff guys in simulated sexual situations to keep you watching.  It's a formula that works for writer/director Q. Allan Brocka, and you can't blame him for sticking with it (Be forewarned that film #5 is already in production). Personally, I'd watch anything that features Mink Stole, who reprises her role as Casey's aunt/landlady, but who now has a hunky younger lover who she met ""on My Face.""
