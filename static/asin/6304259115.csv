The carpool in question are four kids that the moms usually take to school and one other who had to tag along that day. Theres also one of those first love situations. Anyway you should see this movie.,5,Crazyness in a Van,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,320,"['good', 'movie', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'good', 'carpool', 'question', 'are', 'four', 'kids', 'moms', 'usually', 'take', 'school', 'one', 'other', 'who', 'had', 'tag', 'along', 'day', 'Theres', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'love', 'situations', 'Anyway', 'should', 'see', 'movie']",Carpool VHS

The problem I had was with the moral problems of the script. Especially the point in the mall, here the father & children are free from being hostages (albeit from a harmless Arnold). At that point, they actually help in the escape of Arnold who, however sympathetic, has comitted a criminal act. So they are then guilty of aiding & abetting a criminal. I know that this didn't bother anyone else reviewing this, nor am I a moralist. But it seemed quite wrong, especially in a family film. The ending somewhat abets this by having Arnold give back the money & perform community service. But I don't see how in a film you can encourage aiding & abetting a criminal. Liking him, being sympathetic & compassionate to him, forgiving him, yes. Helping him crossed a line that shouldn't have been crossed.",2,Morally problematic,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",2008,919,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'well-made', 'performances', 'were', 'good', 'especially', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'Rhea', 'Pearlman', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'moral', 'problems', 'script', 'Especially', 'point', 'mall', 'here', 'father', 'children', 'are', 'free', 'being', 'hostages', 'harmless', 'Arnold', 'point', 'actually', 'help', 'escape', 'Arnold', 'who', 'however', 'sympathetic', 'comitted', 'criminal', 'act', 'are', 'then', 'guilty', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'criminal', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'anyone', 'else', 'reviewing', 'am', 'moralist', 'seemed', 'quite', 'wrong', 'especially', 'family', 'film', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'having', 'Arnold', 'give', 'back', 'money', 'perform', 'community', 'service', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'film', 'can', 'encourage', 'aiding', 'abetting', 'criminal', 'Liking', 'being', 'sympathetic', 'compassionate', 'forgiving', 'yes', 'Helping', 'crossed', 'line', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'crossed']",Carpool VHS

Even the legendary Ernst Borgnine could not save this movie from being almost unwatchable because it was so senseless. Acting was weak at best, even from Brognine in the limited role he played . Harvey Korman managed to hold the primary 4 characters together to some degree.If for no other reason than to find out what happened to the primary characters, I watched this movie until the end. Thankfully it was free or I would have asked for my money back.
