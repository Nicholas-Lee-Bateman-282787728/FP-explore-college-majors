I know it was a very busy movie filled with a bunch of different popular actors and actresses. The movie starts off on a Valentine morning with several couples together. As the day goes along some have fights and are struggling to make it through the day. This movie is 100% a chick flick. I really didn't like the story because it was like three or four different stories that the writer tried to combine but it can out all over the place. If you like cheezy comedy romances this is your movie. I'm going to give it 2 stars out of 5 because it wasn't bad enough to get a one but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. For the parents, the movie doesn't have any nudity except for a high schoolers butt. The sexual innuendo in the movie is not overwhelming for a normal romance comedy.",3,Valentine's Day,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,914,"['have', 'folks', 'Young', 'love', 'Full', 'promise', 'full', 'hope', 'ignorant', 'reality', 'been', 'awhile', 'saw', 'film', 'know', 'was', 'very', 'busy', 'movie', 'filled', 'bunch', 'different', 'popular', 'actors', 'actresses', 'movie', 'off', 'Valentine', 'morning', 'several', 'couples', 'together', 'day', 'along', 'have', 'fights', 'are', 'struggling', 'make', 'day', 'movie', '100', '%', 'chick', 'flick', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'story', 'was', 'like', 'three', 'four', 'different', 'stories', 'writer', 'tried', 'combine', 'can', 'out', 'place', 'like', 'cheezy', 'comedy', 'romances', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', '2', '5', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'get', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'friend', 'parents', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'nudity', 'high', 'schoolers', 'butt', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'movie', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'normal', 'romance', 'comedy']",N/A

This particular one happens to have a fairly long list of well-known actors, many of whom do a pretty decent part with their lines. It also has the broad range of situations a movie like this usually has from kids who have crushes to an older couple and everything in between. It's the kind of movie you feel like you've seen many times before. The setting of this one is valentine's day in Los Angeles. As is typical with a movie like this, there are so many characters and so many plot lines that it's difficult to flesh all of them out very well, so the quality of the movie depends on good writing and tight scripts that don't waste too many minutes on things that are peripheral to the stories. As it turns out, this particular one is fairly well-done.

1313903,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG99UE,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 12]","Okay, if you take `Love, Actually' and dumb it down to the point where it becomes a preposterous hodgepodge of predictability that holds no merit whatsoever and tests the patients of any sane individual then you would have `Valentine's Day'.  I'm tired of the idea Hollywood has that by simply placing a countless amount of `stars' in a film is going to produce a great movie.  The backbone of any film is not the stars involved by the script they are given.  When you hand a bunch of good actors a crappy script the BEST you can pray for is for one of them to handle the material in a way that makes THEM look good (in this film that person would be Anne Hathaway).  There really isn't anything else you can expect.  The movie is still going to be bad because the material is bad.`Valentine's Day' is a BAD movie.The love sick spoon fed clich&eacute;s that are delivered here are vomit inducing, especially when they are handled with such sub-par conviction.  I could spend the entirely of this review criticizing every `couple' presented here, but I don't really care to spend much time forming this review; the film doesn't deserve it.  Let's just say that Ashton Kutcher's character is the most unrealistic depiction of naivety shown in film this year, and the films ridiculous form of character development is insulting.  Everything is so formulaic and uninspired.  I mean, the atrocious way in which Eric Dane's character is handled (especially his big announcement) is just cringe inducing.  Queen Latifah is thankless here, as is Shirley MacLaine, which is sad since she is marvelous elsewhere.  That whole subplot with MacLaine and Elizondo is so forced.  I actually loved the repartee between Cooper and Roberts, but that is minor; and Hathaway is always delicious, as she is here (the films only comedic slam-dunk) but even her `story' is littered with predictable clich&eacute;s.This whole movie is just kind of gross.Personally, this film is a preposterous rip-off of `Love, Actually', which is actually a lovely movie.  I recommend seeing that film ten times over before subjecting yourself to this nonsense.One major complaint that I feel the urge to expose is that this film never ends.  The problem with introducing us to an onslaught of characters is that you have to bring all of their respective stories to a fulfilling conclusion.  That draws out the films conclusion endless amounts here.  It's not like any of the conclusions are really all that fulfilling, but you spend far too long finding out what happens to whom.  I just wish that there had been more thought put in to actually building a smart film.  This film is a throwaway and should prove to be an embarrassment for everyone involved.Just plain awful.",1,Not much love here...,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2735,"['Okay', 'take', 'Love', 'Actually', 'dumb', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'preposterous', 'hodgepodge', 'predictability', 'merit', 'whatsoever', 'patients', 'sane', 'individual', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'Valentine', 'Day', ""'m"", 'tired', 'idea', 'Hollywood', 'that', 'simply', 'placing', 'countless', 'amount', 'stars', 'film', 'going', 'produce', 'great', 'movie', 'backbone', 'film', 'not', 'stars', 'involved', 'script', 'are', 'given', 'When', 'hand', 'bunch', 'good', 'actors', 'crappy', 'script', 'BEST', 'can', 'pray', 'one', 'handle', 'material', 'way', 'THEM', 'look', 'good', 'film', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else', 'can', 'expect', 'movie', 'still', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'material', 'bad.', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'BAD', 'movie.The', 'love', 'sick', 'spoon', 'fed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'are', 'delivered', 'here', 'are', 'vomit', 'inducing', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'handled', 'such', 'sub-par', 'conviction', 'could', 'spend', 'entirely', 'review', 'criticizing', 'couple', 'presented', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'forming', 'review', 'film', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'character', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'depiction', 'naivety', 'shown', 'film', 'year', 'films', 'ridiculous', 'form', 'character', 'development', 'insulting', 'Everything', 'so', 'formulaic', 'uninspired', 'mean', 'atrocious', 'way', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'character', 'handled', 'especially', 'big', 'announcement', 'just', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'thankless', 'here', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'sad', 'marvelous', 'elsewhere', 'whole', 'subplot', 'MacLaine', 'Elizondo', 'so', 'forced', 'actually', 'loved', 'repartee', 'Cooper', 'Roberts', 'minor', 'Hathaway', 'always', 'delicious', 'here', 'films', 'only', 'comedic', 'slam-dunk', 'even', 'story', 'littered', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.This', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'gross.Personally', 'film', 'preposterous', 'rip-off', 'Love', 'Actually', 'actually', 'lovely', 'movie', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'film', 'ten', 'times', 'subjecting', 'nonsense.One', 'major', 'complaint', 'feel', 'urge', 'expose', 'film', 'never', 'problem', 'introducing', 'onslaught', 'characters', 'have', 'bring', 'respective', 'stories', 'fulfilling', 'conclusion', 'out', 'films', 'conclusion', 'endless', 'amounts', 'here', 'not', 'conclusions', 'are', 'really', 'fulfilling', 'spend', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'whom', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'thought', 'put', 'actually', 'building', 'smart', 'film', 'film', 'throwaway', 'should', 'prove', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'everyone', 'involved.Just', 'plain', 'awful']",N/A

The diversity of storyline is a great strength and also the biggest obstacle to fully enjoying this film from start to finish. I found that it was difficult to follow who was who for much of the film. I recognize that some characters, specifically the two on the airplane, are purposefully vague, but some, for instance, like the young lady who turns out to be the babysitter for the young boy are vague without clear justification. By the end of the film, though, all is forgiven as each story wraps up in a satisfying and enjoyable way.There were only a couple of oddities that didn't seem to fit well into the story, most notably the football star, who was underdeveloped, and some characters that seemed to be plugged in just to add star value, like Queen Latifah as the football star's agent. In other films similar to this the key characters tend to be tied together to a single group of friends and I think that works a little better, but since this story is tied to the day itself it works.Overall, a fun film with tons of star power that ends the way the viewer comes to believe it should. Much better than the Rotten Tomato score.Notice: The film features explicit sexual conversation and describes deviant sex acts prominently, although there is no full nudity and no explicit visual sex scenes. Two characters who are in high school plan on having sex at lunch, while another character is cheating on his wife of 15 years with another character that doesn't know it. Homosexuality also plays a role in the film. There isn't much in the way of foul language, and no drug use. PG-13 is a low rating and parents of teens and tweens should use discernment when allowing their children to watch this film as it probably should have been rated R for all of the sexual content.",4,Fun and Satisfying,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1883,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'more', 'series', 'intertwining', 'stories', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'diversity', 'storyline', 'great', 'strength', 'also', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'fully', 'enjoying', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'found', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'much', 'film', 'recognize', 'characters', 'specifically', 'two', 'airplane', 'are', 'purposefully', 'vague', 'instance', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'babysitter', 'young', 'boy', 'are', 'vague', 'clear', 'justification', 'end', 'film', 'forgiven', 'story', 'up', 'satisfying', 'enjoyable', 'way.There', 'were', 'only', 'couple', 'oddities', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'well', 'story', 'most', 'notably', 'football', 'star', 'who', 'was', 'underdeveloped', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'plugged', 'just', 'add', 'star', 'value', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'football', 'star', 'agent', 'other', 'films', 'similar', 'key', 'characters', 'tend', 'be', 'tied', 'together', 'single', 'group', 'friends', 'think', 'little', 'better', 'story', 'tied', 'day', 'works.Overall', 'fun', 'film', 'tons', 'star', 'power', 'way', 'viewer', 'believe', 'should', 'Much', 'better', 'Rotten', 'Tomato', 'score.Notice', 'film', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'conversation', 'describes', 'deviant', 'sex', 'prominently', 'full', 'nudity', 'explicit', 'visual', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Two', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'plan', 'having', 'sex', 'lunch', 'character', 'cheating', 'wife', '15', 'years', 'character', ""n't"", 'know', 'Homosexuality', 'also', 'role', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'way', 'foul', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'PG-13', 'low', 'rating', 'parents', 'teens', 'tweens', 'should', 'use', 'discernment', 'when', 'allowing', 'children', 'watch', 'film', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'rated', 'R', 'sexual', 'content']",N/A

1313918,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B002ZG99UE,Brad Baker,"[6, 9]","The reviews said ""Valetines Day"" is a flop. I'd say it flops pretty good. Very good. But, then I love Taylor Swift..Old pro Garry Marshall directs this spring-time valentine to southern California. The Hollywood sign looms in the distance, as a truck-load of intertwining couples make-up and break-up, all centered around sending flowers on ""Valentines Day"". They meander down Sunset Boulevard, cruise by Rodeo Drive, and check into the Beverley Wilshire. At the center of this under-rated romantic comedy is Ashton Kutcher as Reed, who proposes to Morley, played by a luscious Jessica Alba. Morley says ""yes"", but later changes her mind; an immature young woman unable to love somebody else. Of course a chick-flick, ""Valentines Day"" has room for the men: You can ponder Ms. Alba half-dressed in her bed, Jennifer Garner in her underwear, and a good dose of young Hollywood hotties like Jessica Biel and Anne Hathaway. But it's Kutcher who makes the movie. Finally almost acting, Kutcher is touching here, as a heart-broken lover, who decides to turn his sorrow into saving his female best friend. The movie starts slow, and gags fall flat, but the second half lights up. It will melt the hardest heart. Supporting actors are good; including George Lopez, Queen Latifah, Kathy Bates and Paul Williams(somewhere). Very talented Jamie Foxx is mis-cast as a black TV announcer; strangely out-of-place around so many young white hunks. And Jessica Alba is shaky and insecure, perhaps too close to the character she portrays. 42-year-old Julia Roberts is lovely and restrained, as Capt. Kate Hazeltine; on a 24-hour furlough, coming home to see the most important man in her life. Shirley MacLaine is memorable. An argument with her husband drives him to the classic-movie-night at Hollywood Cemetery Forever; an actual location containg the caskets of June Mathis and the movie star she created: Rudolph Valentino. Taylor Swift is very funny as a ditsy Valley Girl. The dialogue is fast, but you don't really mind. ""My only real love is my blackberry"". ""Oh. I'm sorry. I really have to take this.."" Surely no classic, ""Valentines Day"" will be remembered.

Not the same story but the same sort of premise where unrequited love gets requited.The pairing of Ashton Kutcher and George Lopez as coworkers at a flower shop was actually very promising for a future road movie with those two. I'm just saying...There's really something for everyone in this from the woman who hates Valentine's Day (Jessica Biel) to the surprising ""gay"" twist that is kept quiet until the final scenes. Sadly, Jessica Alba still can't act her way out of bag of hammers and she plays a crucial girlfriend role to Kutcher.The big surprise (and i""m giving nothing away as you learn this in her first scene) in this is the casting out of character of Anne Hathaway who moonlights as a role playing phone sex woman to pay her bills.DVD is not worth getting as it has zero extras, but it is worth a rental especially if your partner's in the mood for a chick flick with enough guy moments to make it worthwhile for guys.",4,"a ""she/he's in it, too?"" type of movie",1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,1282,"['Gary', 'Marshall', 'must', 'have', 'dirt', 'everyone', 'Hollywood', 'EVERYONE', 'cast', 'tens', 'movie', 'course', 'good', 'luck', 'charm', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'here', 'Julie', 'Roberts', 'too', 'sign', 'Richard', 'Gere', ""'d"", 'have', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Valentine', 'Day', '.Anyway', 'delightful', 'sort', 'American', 'version', 'British', 'hit', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Not', 'same', 'story', 'same', 'sort', 'premise', 'where', 'unrequited', 'love', 'requited.The', 'pairing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'George', 'Lopez', 'coworkers', 'flower', 'shop', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'promising', 'future', 'road', 'movie', 'two', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'really', 'something', 'everyone', 'woman', 'who', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'surprising', 'gay', 'twist', 'kept', 'quiet', 'final', 'scenes', 'Sadly', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'bag', 'hammers', 'crucial', 'girlfriend', 'role', 'Kutcher.The', 'big', 'surprise', 'i', 'm', 'giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'learn', 'first', 'scene', 'casting', 'character', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'moonlights', 'role', 'playing', 'phone', 'sex', 'woman', 'pay', 'bills.DVD', 'not', 'worth', 'getting', 'zero', 'extras', 'rental', 'especially', 'partner', 'mood', 'chick', 'flick', 'enough', 'guy', 'moments', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'guys']",N/A

1313930,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG99UE,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 2]","Gary Marshall's ""Valentine's Day"" is a romantic comedy with Attention Deficit Disorder, constantly shifting back and forth between stories, never staying on any one long enough for something meaningful to sink in. Just when we reach a genuinely charming moment, we cut to another subplot and find ourselves having to invest all over again before yet another cut to a different subplot, and it keeps going like this for just under two hours. It doesn't help that the film is essentially a showcase of stardom, every story featuring very famous people; you want to see them as their characters, but instead you're distracted by their celebrity. There are specific plotlines I enjoyed, and there are characters I found endearing. But on the whole, ""Valentine's Day"" is overlong, overstuffed, and overambitious.There's no adequate way to describe every plotline, which is just as well since I doubt the average moviegoer would have the patience to keep track of them all. So then how can I describe this movie to you? Let's begin with the general idea: ""Valentine's Day"" is a collection of small narratives in which Los Angeles natives, whose stories all interconnect to some degree, go through the ups and downs of love and relationships on February 14. Probably the best place to start is with Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher), a florist who proposes to his girlfriend, Morley (Jessica Alba); for reasons he has yet to understand, everyone around him is surprised by this, including his friend, a schoolteacher named Julia (Jennifer Garner).She's head over heels in love with a heart surgeon named Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey), who, for lack of a better term, is quite good at juggling things. Julia's best friend is Kara (Jessica Biel), a publicist for football player Sean Jackson (Eric Dane), who at age thirty-five is ready to consider retiring. Kara becomes hopelessly neurotic every Valentine's Day due to her failure in the relationship department, and is once again organizing her annual I Hate Valentine's Day party. Strangely enough, this appeals to Kelvin Moore (Jaime Foxx), a sports reporter; on this particular day, he's on the streets covering Valentine's Day stories, although he would like nothing more than to stick to what he does best, and lo and behold, Sean Jackson is ready to make an announcement.Sean's agent, the tough-talking Paula (Queen Latifah), has just hired a new receptionist. Her name is Liz (Anne Hathaway), a cash-strapped college student who earns extra money by moonlighting as ... something her new boyfriend, a mailroom clerk named Jason (Topher Grace), has trouble accepting because he's from Indiana and therefore likes simple things.Meanwhile, Reed is supposed to make a delivery to one of Julia's students, a boy named Edison (Bryce Robinson), who claims to be in love and desperately wants to give a valentine to the girl of his dreams. This is a tough year for Edison because his mother isn't there, and he's now being raised by his grandparents, Edgar and Estelle (Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine). They realize they're having problems of their own when Edison's babysitter, a high school student named Grace (Emma Roberts), confides to them that she and her boyfriend, Alex (Carter Jenkins), had planned to lose their virginity on Valentine's Day before she had a change of heart. Her friend, Felicia (Taylor Swift), seems infatuated with her boyfriend, Willy (Taylor Lautner), who sent her a gigantic white teddy bear as a Valentine's Day gift.As it turns out, an interesting - if ultimately misleading - relationship is developing in the skies above; a businessman named Holden Bristow (Bradley Cooper) and a soldier named Kate Hazlitine (Julia Roberts) are on a plane headed for Los Angeles. While they have a pleasant enough conversation, and while they're both very nice, respectable people, they ultimately reveal little about what they're going back for and who they hope to meet once they arrive. Yes, something is at work here. No, it's not what you think it is.Did you get all that? I told you there was no adequate way to describe every plotline. Sorting through this movie is mentally exhausting, and the fact that Marshall and writer Katherine Fugate didn't take this into account shows a serious lack of insight on their part.If I had to pick one plotline that works best as far as performance, story, and characterization, it would have to be the one starring Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper. The Ashton Kutcher/Jennifer Garner/Jessica Alba plotline is cute and somewhat appealing, but it's also conventional, following the rules of pretty much every romantic comedy ever made. The worst plotline is the one starring Bryce Robinson; never once did I believe that a boy that young could ever be so romantically inclined. And don't tell me that you had a boyfriend or girlfriend back in grade school - you and I both know romance doesn't exist before puberty. As for every other plotline, I can't say I responded to them, in large part because they kept interrupting each other. That, as well as moments of desperate physical comedy and obvious verbal gags, made ""Valentine's Day"" a tedious, unrewarding experience, one that left me wanting a dose of Ritalin.",3,Love is

The film is overly-packed with characters played by huge A-list celebrities. The filmmakers clearly either tried to out-do and or were inspired by the huge success of He's Just Not that into You. This is evident from the rare style both films share, the fact that both were written by some of the same people, and that both were released by the same studio.He's Just Not that into You worked for two reasons: 1.) It had perhaps five or six less main characters, allowing for more time to be spent getting to know them; 2.) It was written significantly better.Valentine's Day is jam-packed with things that make us smile and chuckle, but never really get us to the point of laughing. It's cute yes, and no it's not horrible - but it's not great either.This film would have been better served as a 12 hour mini-series or even as an entire sitcom spread out over years and years of seasons. Even then, it would still be thick with characters. Having them all jam-packed into two hours with individual conflicts and resolutions is absurd.None of them seem like characters at all. It just feels like tiny seconds spent with the movie stars that we know them all for, and it's not their fault. It's easy to see how appealing this project would be to an actor, knowing they could step in and play a small roll without ever seeing most of the other talent involved. Several actors never appear in a scene together. Imagine the excitement of seeing how it all came together, for the first time at the Hollywood premier. Most of us would have done the same in their shoes.The two characters that were given the most attention in the story are best friends Reed (Ashton Kutcher) and Julia (Jennifer Garner). Out of respect to the one person who will read this and not see the so-called `twists' coming from two miles out - I'll spare you the  details of how predictable everything that happens is. Let's just say, we've seen every little turn and mishap and mildly humorous event, a thousand times before, in some other romantic comedy.On a positive note, you could surely find worse films to pass your two hours with. As chaotic as it is, it is still a blast to see so many popular faces in one movie, and literally everyone was brilliant.  And while the writers didn't develop the characters well at all, or give any of them interesting unique situations to find themselves in -they did do a pretty descent job of tying everyone's story together by the end of the film.As if seeing all of them wasn't entertaining enough, it's even more fun to see who's paired up with whom. Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper play strangers who strike up a conversation while sitting next to each other on an airplane. Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace are the cutest odd couple in the film. Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift take us back to High School. And Jamie Foxx and Jessica Biel re-unite from their previous film Stealth, as two people who are exactly what the other needs.Please keep in mind that I see virtually every film that comes out and tend to have high expectations from talented actors and directors (especially acclaimed talents like Gary Marshal who have directed flawless films like Pretty Woman and Georgia Rule). Some of you will no-doubt like this film very much, and I hope that you do. But if you find yourself appreciating the idea of the film more than the film itself; then do yourself a favor. Rent He's Just Not that into You.

Overlong at 122 minutes, this enterprise is directed with little nuance by Garry Marshall who seems to be throwing his film back to the broad shenanigans of his late-1970's sitcoms likeLaverne & ShirleyandMork & Mindy. However, even more than Marshall's superficial direction, the real culprit is Katharine Fugate's (Army Wives) clich&eacute;-ridden, laugh-free screenplay. The contrived storyline she concocts forces about twenty recognizable actors to play out the slings and arrows of romance over the course of Valentine's Day in present-day Los Angeles.If you keep count of such things, there appears to be five interconnecting major stories. Character names are irrelevant in keeping track of them since we are meant to be awestruck by the star wattage of the cast, so I will just refer to the actors directly in my synopsis. Story #1: Julia Roberts is an uptight US Army captain on a one-day leave from Iraq and Bradley Cooper is her seatmate on the plane ride home to LA. Story #2: In the San Fernando Valley, Ashton Kutcher is a harried florist who has just proposed to his selfish, careerist girlfriend Jessica Alba, while his best friend Jennifer Garner has fallen in love with Patrick Dempsey, a deceptive doctor whom she doesn't know is married. Story #3: Emma Roberts (Julia's niece) turns 18 and methodically plans to lose her virginity with boyfriend Carter Jenkins that afternoon while her parents are presumptively away from the house. Story #4: Eric Dane is a closeted professional football player who struggles with inevitable retirement and complicates the livelihoods of both his romantically challenged publicist Jessica Biel and tough-minded &uuml;ber-agent Queen Latifah.Story #5: Anne Hathaway is Latifah's receptionist moonlighting as a phone sex operator as she begins to date mail clerk Topher Grace. The various plots intertwine with each other, and even more actors are thrown in for good measure like Jamie Foxx as a roving TV reporter and Shirley MacLaine and Hector Elizondo as grandparents hitting a rough spot. Does anybody shine above the others? You know you're in trouble when Kutcher is the one who gives the most dimensional performance in the film. Garner somehow survives with her appeal intact even in the silly revenge scene in the restaurant and theAlias-inspired throttling of the heart-shaped pi&ntilde;ata that follows. Biel and Hathaway both work a bit too strenuously in their predictable parts, though both manage amusing moments. Alba continues to be a vacuous screen beauty, and the same could be said of Dempsey. It's not too surprising that both play characters who end up with the fuzzy end of the lollipop.Julia Roberts is wasted in her constricted role, but her niece Emma acquits herself even as singer Taylor Swift plays her gangly, airheaded best friend with surprising &eacute;lan. Dane is wooden as if he doesn't know how to play a conflicted character, but Cooper manages to register in his equally ambivalent part. Foxx, Latifah and Grace play their accustomed roles with little surprise or impact. 76-year-old MacLaine gets the benefit of playing a romantic scene with Elizondo in front of a movie screen showing her 24-year-old self in 1958'sHot Spell. Before you can sayLove Actually, it all ends rather neatly with nary a trace. Poof! The 2010 DVD has a predictable set of extras - a bland commentary track from Marshall that matches the bland tone of the movie, a six-minute featurette that allows some of stars to share their Valentine's Day stories, a five-minute cast tribute to Marshall, a disposable music video from Jewel, a few deleted scenes, and a three-minute sneak preview of ""Sex and the City 2"", appropriate since that movie caters to the same demographic audience.",2,"Unmemorable, Studio-Packaged Filler Showcases Twenty Stars in Trivial Pursuit of Romance",1274659200,"05 24, 2010",2010,3950,"['heavily', 'packaged', '2010', 'omnibus', 'rom-com', 'brings', 'new', 'meaning', 'term', 'trivial', 'pursuit', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'served', 'movie', 'so', 'bereft', 'dramatic', 'gravity', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'Overlong', '122', 'minutes', 'enterprise', 'directed', 'little', 'nuance', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'who', 'be', 'throwing', 'film', 'back', 'broad', 'shenanigans', 'late-1970', 'sitcoms', 'likeLaverne', 'ShirleyandMork', 'Mindy', 'However', 'even', 'more', 'Marshall', 'superficial', 'direction', 'real', 'culprit', 'Katharine', 'Fugate', 'Army', 'Wives', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'laugh-free', 'screenplay', 'contrived', 'storyline', 'forces', 'twenty', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'play', 'out', 'slings', 'arrows', 'romance', 'course', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'present-day', 'Los', 'Angeles.If', 'keep', 'count', 'such', 'things', 'be', 'five', 'interconnecting', 'major', 'stories', 'Character', 'names', 'are', 'irrelevant', 'keeping', 'track', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'awestruck', 'star', 'wattage', 'cast', 'will', 'just', 'refer', 'actors', 'directly', 'synopsis', 'Story', '1', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'uptight', 'US', 'Army', 'captain', 'one-day', 'leave', 'Iraq', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'seatmate', 'plane', 'ride', 'home', 'LA', 'Story', '2', 'San', 'Fernando', 'Valley', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'harried', 'florist', 'who', 'just', 'proposed', 'selfish', 'careerist', 'girlfriend', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'best', 'friend', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'fallen', 'love', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'deceptive', 'doctor', 'whom', ""n't"", 'know', 'married', 'Story', '3', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Julia', 'niece', '18', 'methodically', 'plans', 'lose', 'virginity', 'boyfriend', 'Carter', 'Jenkins', 'afternoon', 'parents', 'are', 'presumptively', 'away', 'house', 'Story', '4', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'closeted', 'professional', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'inevitable', 'retirement', 'livelihoods', 'romantically', 'challenged', 'publicist', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'tough-minded', 'uuml', 'ber-agent', 'Queen', 'Latifah.Story', '5', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Latifah', 'receptionist', 'moonlighting', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'date', 'mail', 'clerk', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'various', 'plots', 'intertwine', 'other', 'even', 'more', 'actors', 'are', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'roving', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'grandparents', 'hitting', 'rough', 'spot', 'anybody', 'shine', 'others', 'know', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'when', 'Kutcher', 'one', 'who', 'most', 'dimensional', 'performance', 'film', 'Garner', 'somehow', 'appeal', 'intact', 'even', 'silly', 'revenge', 'scene', 'restaurant', 'theAlias-inspired', 'throttling', 'heart-shaped', 'pi', 'ntilde', 'Biel', 'Hathaway', 'work', 'bit', 'too', 'strenuously', 'predictable', 'parts', 'manage', 'amusing', 'moments', 'Alba', 'be', 'vacuous', 'screen', 'beauty', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Dempsey', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'play', 'characters', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'fuzzy', 'end', 'lollipop.Julia', 'Roberts', 'wasted', 'constricted', 'role', 'niece', 'Emma', 'even', 'singer', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'gangly', 'airheaded', 'best', 'friend', 'surprising', 'eacute', 'lan', 'Dane', 'wooden', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'play', 'conflicted', 'character', 'Cooper', 'register', 'equally', 'ambivalent', 'part', 'Foxx', 'Latifah', 'Grace', 'play', 'accustomed', 'roles', 'little', 'surprise', 'impact', '76-year-old', 'MacLaine', 'benefit', 'playing', 'romantic', 'scene', 'Elizondo', 'front', 'movie', 'screen', 'showing', '24-year-old', 'self', ""1958'sHot"", 'Spell', 'can', 'sayLove', 'Actually', 'rather', 'neatly', 'nary', 'trace', 'Poof', '2010', 'DVD', 'predictable', 'set', 'extras', 'bland', 'commentary', 'track', 'Marshall', 'bland', 'tone', 'movie', 'six-minute', 'featurette', 'stars', 'share', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'stories', 'five-minute', 'cast', 'tribute', 'Marshall', 'disposable', 'music', 'video', 'Jewel', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'three-minute', 'sneak', 'preview', 'Sex', 'City', '2', 'appropriate', 'movie', 'caters', 'same', 'demographic', 'audience']",N/A

There is the old man who has just learned that his wife had an affair a long time ago. He thinks, ""(You) telling the truth has made everything else a lie."" There is the little boy striving to obtain a timely delivery of flowers to give to a little girl and, for a time, he gives them to an adult woman instead. There is the couple of 18 year-olds who are planning their first sexual experience each. There is the young woman having an affair with an older doctor, believing his statement that he is divorced. Upon being told by the florist, who has a lot of inside information as to what is actually going on, that he is actually still married, she plans a trip to find out, and to nail him with creative revenge if indeed he had been lying to her.Valentine's Day is not joyful for everyone.

And because I'm a masochist, I managed to sit through this entire putrid affair of shallow characters with minimal development and convoluted connections.  Sadly, it has taken me the past few months to get over the kidney stones this movie caused, and I apologize beforehand for this review, and for watching this abortion of romance.  A brief summary:Jennifer Garner, teacher of a Kid who is not that cute, sexual conquest of Patrick Dempsey (who is juggling women), friend of florist Ashton Kutcher who proposes to Jessica Alba and sells the aforementioned Kid flowers.  Meanwhile, Jessica Biel - Garner's friend - hosts an ""I Hate Valentine's Day"" party when not doing her actual job of working with Latifah, employer of Anne Hathaway (who moonlights as a phone sex worker but is newly dating Topher Grace, who is so wooden in one scene he actually bursts into flames), as an agent/publicist for gay NFL Quarterback Eric Dane - covered by sports news anchor Jamie Foxx, who finds burgeoning romance with Jessica Biel - who's dating Bradley Cooper, a rich guy who shares a plane ride with Julia Roberts, who just so happens to be the Kid's mother.  You get all that?  Just in case it wasn't convoluted enough for you, there's a pointless teenage romance sub-plot with the Kid's older sister scheduling lunchtime sex with her emaciated boyfriend, George Lopez spewing tired, retread jokes about Mexican immigrants, Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift displaying their lack of acting chops as high-school sweethearts (even though Swift still manages to be immensely likeable), Kathy Bates in a role I already forgot, and the duo of Hector Elizando and Shirley MacLaine taking up too much time with old people romance...something most want to see less than Kathy Bates' nude scene in About Schmidt {{shudder}}Aside from the atrocious lack of character development, which results in the audience not caring about a single character or relationship other than possibly the mother-son connection, the messages in this film are horrible.  It's the anti-Valentine's Day message, as multiple people get their hearts broken, ""love"" is superficially found mere hours after an engagement is called off, and a husband is told to essentially just get over the fact that his wife went whoring around on him during their early years after matrimony.Only in Hollywood could there be a film where Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Anne Hathaway, and Jennifer Garner have troubles finding men.  I have an easier time believing the plot ofIron EagleorToy Soldiers, both of which are unfathomably unrealistic and inexplicably star Lou Gossett Jr.  Simply put, if you're looking for romance or realism, I recommend the horror movieValentinerather than Valentine's Day.",2,Needed a Valentine's Day Massacre,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2884,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'present', 'hesitantly', 'made', 'plans', 'dinner', 'movie', 'planning', 'chick-flick', 'surprise', 'hey', 'day', ""'m"", 'masochist', 'managed', 'sit', 'entire', 'putrid', 'affair', 'shallow', 'characters', 'minimal', 'development', 'convoluted', 'connections', 'Sadly', 'taken', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'get', 'kidney', 'movie', 'caused', 'apologize', 'beforehand', 'review', 'watching', 'abortion', 'romance', 'brief', 'summary', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'teacher', 'Kid', 'who', 'not', 'cute', 'sexual', 'conquest', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'who', 'juggling', 'women', 'friend', 'florist', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'aforementioned', 'Kid', 'flowers', 'Meanwhile', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Garner', 'friend', 'Hate', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'party', 'when', 'not', 'doing', 'actual', 'job', 'working', 'Latifah', 'employer', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'who', 'moonlights', 'phone', 'sex', 'worker', 'newly', 'dating', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'who', 'so', 'wooden', 'one', 'scene', 'actually', 'flames', 'agent/publicist', 'gay', 'NFL', 'Quarterback', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'covered', 'sports', 'news', 'anchor', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'burgeoning', 'romance', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'who', 'dating', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'rich', 'guy', 'who', 'shares', 'plane', 'ride', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'Kid', 'mother', 'get', 'Just', 'case', 'was', ""n't"", 'convoluted', 'enough', 'pointless', 'teenage', 'romance', 'sub-plot', 'Kid', 'older', 'sister', 'scheduling', 'lunchtime', 'sex', 'emaciated', 'boyfriend', 'George', 'Lopez', 'spewing', 'tired', 'retread', 'jokes', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'displaying', 'lack', 'acting', 'chops', 'high-school', 'sweethearts', 'even', 'Swift', 'still', 'be', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'role', 'already', 'forgot', 'duo', 'Hector', 'Elizando', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'taking', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'old', 'people', 'romance', 'something', 'most', 'want', 'see', 'less', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'nude', 'scene', 'About', 'Schmidt', 'shudder', 'Aside', 'atrocious', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'results', 'audience', 'not', 'caring', 'single', 'character', 'relationship', 'other', 'possibly', 'mother-son', 'connection', 'messages', 'film', 'are', 'horrible', 'anti-Valentine', 'Day', 'message', 'multiple', 'people', 'get', 'hearts', 'broken', 'love', 'superficially', 'found', 'mere', 'hours', 'engagement', 'called', 'off', 'husband', 'told', 'essentially', 'just', 'get', 'fact', 'wife', 'went', 'whoring', 'around', 'early', 'years', 'matrimony.Only', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'film', 'where', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'have', 'troubles', 'finding', 'men', 'have', 'easier', 'time', 'believing', 'plot', 'ofIron', 'EagleorToy', 'Soldiers', 'are', 'unfathomably', 'unrealistic', 'inexplicably', 'star', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Simply', 'put', ""'re"", 'looking', 'romance', 'realism', 'recommend', 'horror', 'movieValentinerather', 'Valentine', 'Day']",N/A

I rate it so highly because it was not what I typically expect from a romantic comedy (which I rarely watch as a rule).  I thought the acting was good, the stories were amusing, and the ending was in some cases quite surprising (SPOILERS:  I loved the addition of the gay couple, as well as the age range/relationship range of the couples, and in particular the mother/child relationship - I thought it was wonderful that a Valentine's Day movie covered the gamut of love!)  Yes some of it was cliched, but it's a romantic comedy - how far off of the beaten path can you really go with that?While Taylor Swift's character and her boyfriend were obnoxious, that was kind of the entire point...and I LOVED the line about him being uncomfortable taking his shirt off in public.  I honestly was pretty happy with all of the cast; again, this was not meant to be anyone's best movie, but for what it was I felt it was excellent.To sum up, if you're looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy you will be happy and probably even pleasantly surprised.

1313989,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B002ZG99UE,"L P ""lilip""","[0, 2]","This was a cute movie and quite entertaining for when you are bored and just want to watch something to take your mind off. However, I must admit that if it hadn't been filled with a star-studded cast, it would be really boring and pretty bad actually. In fact, the one thing that made this movie semi bearable was the fact that nearly every scene had an important, often high-caliber star hidden in there somewhere and half of the fun of this movie was pointing out the stars - like ""oh, there is Brad Cooper"" or ""Wow, Jessica Biehl"" and ""Hey, this is Kathy Bates.""This movie is about the lives of about half a dozen couples or so and some lonely souls in between in the span of roughly twenty-four hours during Valentine's Day. In the end, all their stories interconnect. Most of it is pretty predictable and right on formula and as I write, I must admit that the most fun really in this movie was pointing out the stars part and seeing what they are up to.There are comatosely, slow moments - like the story line about that old couple played by Shirley MacClaine and Hector Elizondo. Sorry, didn't care hearing about their WWII romance and how she cheated on him like 50 years ago. Whatever.  The other part I fast forwarded through was all the juvenile, silly parts with Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift (haha - how cute - yes we get it - both are named ""Taylor"" - very clever) whose idea of romance is planning on having sex during lunch time ""because it is the only time we got today."" Taylor Swift cannot act and is dumb like a rock and appears ot be playing herself mainly. The scenes with her are cringe-worthy and I must say - never having paid any attention to her face before really - I realized how much she looks like a cross between a rat and a pig and just weird. Anyway, the ""high schooler"" segment just didn't seem to fit the theme and pace of the rest of the movie and it was obvious she got the part not because of her acting skills (she has none), but because of her name. In fact, having a big name seems to have the prerequisite for being signed on to this movie.Having said that, I believe one of the huge issues with this film is in fact that it is filled left and right with a star-studded cast; packed in fact. While entertaining from a fun perspective as mentioned above, it was pretty bad from a narrative, acting, character-development and substance angle. I mean they had these stars - some of whom are amazing actors - packed into this meaningless, superficial patchwork of a movie, totally underutilizing them (I dont think anyone had more than three minutes of screen time per scene) - eventually leading to a watered-down story and equally watered down characters. This is a perfect example of why quantity doesn't necessarily equal quality - as this was just overkill. And is ultimately this overkill that did not allow the individual talents and strengths of each actor to shine through.Jessica Alba, aside from looking washed out from that awful blonde hair, had a total of five minutes of screen-time and the story of her, Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner seemed wrapped up ""too quickly"". Overall, they just stuffed too many story lines and too many issues and conflicts in there for any single one of them to be satisfactorily resolved or even meditated on and fleshed out. It was an assembly line ""check and go"".There was also a lot of not so subtle product placement in this movie and overall it seemed all a little bit too much like a promotion for Valentine' Day - sort of as if the industry got together and thought of a way to make a two hour, star cast commercial to somehow revive the holiday. That is, I guess, why nearly all actors are either high profile, established ones or otherwise big names (Lautner from the Twilight movies and Swift the mega country music star etc.). I wonder why any of them signed up for this piece of tourist trinket in the first place and how the studio could afford them all. I hear Roberts gets paid something like 20 million per movie and all other actors are well established enough, so their salaries lie in the millions as well. This wasn't a cheap and I assume the only way they could afford it was all that product placement. Emma Roberts obviously got the part because of her aunt Julia Roberts - no question about it.In the end you had a lot of loose ends, many superficial endings, unbelievable and unauthentic human relationships and interactions and just not much substance but instead lots of frosting in the from of super stars. If you are looking for a sensitive, intelligent and somewhat meaningful story, you will be disappointed. But ifyou look ot fill your time with mindless banter, go for it.",3,Fluffy and Lightweight Star Studded Movie with Very Little Substance,1300579200,"03 20, 2011",2011,4694,"['was', 'cute', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'when', 'are', 'bored', 'just', 'want', 'watch', 'something', 'take', 'mind', 'off', 'However', 'must', 'admit', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'filled', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'boring', 'pretty', 'bad', 'actually', 'fact', 'one', 'thing', 'made', 'movie', 'semi', 'bearable', 'was', 'fact', 'nearly', 'scene', 'had', 'important', 'often', 'high-caliber', 'star', 'hidden', 'somewhere', 'half', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'pointing', 'out', 'stars', 'oh', 'Brad', 'Cooper', 'Wow', 'Jessica', 'Biehl', 'Hey', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'movie', 'lives', 'dozen', 'couples', 'so', 'lonely', 'souls', 'span', 'roughly', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'end', 'stories', 'interconnect', 'Most', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'right', 'formula', 'write', 'must', 'admit', 'most', 'fun', 'really', 'movie', 'was', 'pointing', 'out', 'stars', 'part', 'seeing', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'to.There', 'are', 'comatosely', 'slow', 'moments', 'story', 'line', 'old', 'couple', 'played', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'hearing', 'WWII', 'romance', 'how', 'cheated', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'other', 'part', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'was', 'juvenile', 'silly', 'parts', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'haha', 'how', 'cute', 'yes', 'get', 'are', 'named', 'Taylor', 'very', 'clever', 'idea', 'romance', 'planning', 'having', 'sex', 'lunch', 'time', 'only', 'time', 'got', 'today', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'dumb', 'rock', 'ot', 'be', 'playing', 'mainly', 'scenes', 'are', 'cringe-worthy', 'must', 'say', 'never', 'having', 'paid', 'attention', 'face', 'really', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'cross', 'rat', 'pig', 'just', 'weird', 'Anyway', 'high', 'schooler', 'segment', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'theme', 'pace', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'obvious', 'got', 'part', 'not', 'acting', 'skills', 'none', 'name', 'fact', 'having', 'big', 'name', 'have', 'prerequisite', 'being', 'signed', 'movie.Having', 'said', 'believe', 'one', 'huge', 'issues', 'film', 'fact', 'filled', 'left', 'right', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'packed', 'fact', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'perspective', 'mentioned', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'narrative', 'acting', 'character-development', 'substance', 'angle', 'mean', 'had', 'stars', 'whom', 'are', 'amazing', 'actors', 'packed', 'meaningless', 'superficial', 'patchwork', 'movie', 'totally', 'underutilizing', 'dont', 'think', 'anyone', 'had', 'more', 'three', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'scene', 'eventually', 'leading', 'watered-down', 'story', 'equally', 'watered', 'down', 'characters', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'quantity', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'equal', 'quality', 'was', 'just', 'overkill', 'ultimately', 'overkill', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'individual', 'talents', 'strengths', 'actor', 'shine', 'through.Jessica', 'Alba', 'aside', 'looking', 'washed', 'out', 'awful', 'blonde', 'hair', 'had', 'total', 'five', 'minutes', 'screen-time', 'story', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'seemed', 'wrapped', 'up', 'too', 'quickly', 'Overall', 'just', 'stuffed', 'too', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'too', 'many', 'issues', 'conflicts', 'single', 'one', 'be', 'satisfactorily', 'resolved', 'even', 'meditated', 'fleshed', 'out', 'was', 'assembly', 'line', 'check', 'go', '.There', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'product', 'placement', 'movie', 'overall', 'seemed', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'promotion', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'sort', 'industry', 'got', 'together', 'thought', 'way', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'star', 'cast', 'commercial', 'somehow', 'revive', 'holiday', 'guess', 'why', 'nearly', 'actors', 'are', 'either', 'high', 'profile', 'established', 'ones', 'otherwise', 'big', 'names', 'Lautner', 'Twilight', 'movies', 'Swift', 'mega', 'country', 'music', 'star', 'etc.', 'wonder', 'why', 'signed', 'up', 'piece', 'tourist', 'trinket', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'studio', 'could', 'afford', 'hear', 'Roberts', 'paid', 'something', '20', 'million', 'movie', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'well', 'established', 'enough', 'salaries', 'lie', 'millions', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheap', 'assume', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'afford', 'was', 'product', 'placement', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'obviously', 'got', 'part', 'aunt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'question', 'it.In', 'end', 'had', 'lot', 'loose', 'ends', 'many', 'superficial', 'endings', 'unbelievable', 'unauthentic', 'human', 'relationships', 'interactions', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'instead', 'lots', 'frosting', 'super', 'stars', 'are', 'looking', 'sensitive', 'intelligent', 'somewhat', 'meaningful', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'ifyou', 'look', 'ot', 'fill', 'time', 'mindless', 'banter', 'go']",N/A

Some people (usually female and betrothed) love it.  Some people (usually uncreative males and singles) dread it.  Both groups feel different ways for the same reason: it's a publically sanctioned way of demanding that people account for the strength and honesty of their emotions.  Hence the schmaltz.Some people call that schmaltz ""romance.""  I think romance has its time and place, but my experiences have led me to a place where, while not jaded per se, I'm a bit more skeptical of the giant teddy bears and heart-shaped chocolates than your average Swoony McTenderHeart who happens to be in love.  If you ask me, the genre ""romantic comedy"" is either redundant or an oxymoron; I rarely voluntarily go to watch movies of this variety.  Keep that in mind as you read the rest of this very short review:This movie isn't bad.  It is about 90% predictable (shame on this website's staff reviewer for giving away Bradley Cooper's secret!), but the stories aren't overly sweet (for the most part) and there are some good one-liners and rejoinders (although many of the jokes have been done over and over again in past movies).  Ashton Kucher's acting is the worst I've seen from him, but others (Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, and the tow-headed little boy) make up for it with funny and sometimes subtle performances.  And although this has to be the seven hundredth time I've watched Jennifer Garner find true love (It was right in front of her this whole time!  Again!), she manages not to make the obvious script any more overbearing.The film follows the lives of various people (talent agents, sportscasters, mailroom boys, elementary school teachers, ditzy blonde cheerleaders) as they find, lose, and find love again.  It works a lot like Altman's SHORT CUTS or the more recent LOVE, ACTUALLY.  The star-studded cast is nice to see in a movie of this breadth, but it's stale, uninvigorating material.One character quotes a poem that says that love is not gentle, it is meant to be devastating.  This is why, he says, people fall head over heels into love.  Well, this movie contains almost no devastation at all, just some gloomy people who (almost) all end up finding their warm fuzzies.  It would've been nice to see that devastating love in action, but for a movie that is so obviously trying to capitalize on the schmaltz of this holiday, it's forgiveable (if not regretable) that the devastation was set aside for the traditional teeth-rotting sweetness of it all.",3,The Devastating Fuzzies,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,2550,"['Oh', 'schmaltz', 'so', 'hard', 'escape', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'people', 'usually', 'female', 'betrothed', 'love', 'people', 'usually', 'uncreative', 'males', 'singles', 'dread', 'groups', 'feel', 'different', 'ways', 'same', 'reason', 'publically', 'sanctioned', 'way', 'demanding', 'people', 'account', 'strength', 'honesty', 'emotions', 'Hence', 'schmaltz.Some', 'people', 'call', 'schmaltz', 'romance', 'think', 'romance', 'time', 'place', 'experiences', 'have', 'led', 'place', 'where', 'not', 'jaded', 'se', ""'m"", 'bit', 'more', 'skeptical', 'giant', 'teddy', 'bears', 'heart-shaped', 'chocolates', 'average', 'Swoony', 'McTenderHeart', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'ask', 'genre', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'redundant', 'oxymoron', 'rarely', 'voluntarily', 'go', 'watch', 'movies', 'variety', 'Keep', 'mind', 'read', 'rest', 'very', 'short', 'review', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', '90', '%', 'predictable', 'shame', 'website', 'staff', 'reviewer', 'giving', 'away', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'secret', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'overly', 'sweet', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'good', 'one-liners', 'rejoinders', 'many', 'jokes', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'over', 'again', 'past', 'movies', 'Ashton', 'Kucher', 'acting', 'worst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'others', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'tow-headed', 'little', 'boy', 'make', 'up', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'performances', 'be', 'seven', 'hundredth', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'was', 'right', 'front', 'whole', 'time', 'Again', 'not', 'make', 'obvious', 'script', 'more', 'overbearing.The', 'film', 'lives', 'various', 'people', 'talent', 'agents', 'sportscasters', 'mailroom', 'boys', 'elementary', 'school', 'teachers', 'ditzy', 'blonde', 'cheerleaders', 'find', 'lose', 'find', 'love', 'again', 'lot', 'Altman', 'SHORT', 'CUTS', 'more', 'recent', 'LOVE', 'ACTUALLY', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'breadth', 'stale', 'uninvigorating', 'material.One', 'character', 'poem', 'love', 'not', 'gentle', 'meant', 'be', 'devastating', 'why', 'people', 'fall', 'head', 'heels', 'love', 'Well', 'movie', 'almost', 'devastation', 'just', 'gloomy', 'people', 'who', 'almost', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'devastating', 'love', 'action', 'movie', 'so', 'obviously', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'schmaltz', 'holiday', 'forgiveable', 'not', 'regretable', 'devastation', 'was', 'set', 'aside', 'traditional', 'teeth-rotting', 'sweetness']",N/A

I thought it would be nothing but a chick flick, and it does start out as one. There's no one main couple, and no real main characters (unless you count the characters played by Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner) Overall the film was enjoyable, with fun roles played by Anne Hathaway and Queen Latifah. There's a lot of other good actors in this (Topher Grace, Jessica Alba, Shirley MacLaine, and a few others I cannot name)I was disappointed in one thing, though. The old couple's situation... I was angry that the matter of adultery was so easily resolved at the end. Yes, you should forgive people you love if they make a mistake, but you shouldn't forgive someone JUST because you love them (what if someone you love raped you, or did something else really horrible?) The grandfather put it succinctly when he first learned of his wife's affair after she said 'i wanted to tell you the truth'. He said 'The truth makes everything else feel like a lie' and that is a very, VERY good way of putting adultery. It is terrible and it hurts people, so I was disappointed that this couple reunited at the end, as if saying that adultery was okay and if someone you love cheats on you, you should forgive them just because you love them! How BS is that? That makes adultery seem not like a big deal. Thank goodness the character played by Jennifer Garner dealt with her lover's infidelity by humiliating him instead of forgiving him, otherwise this movie would have lost its meaning.I liked that the character done by Latifah 'got into' her employee's adult phone entertainment thing instead of just firing her. It was hilarious when she took on her 'African Queen' persona. I laughed out loud at that.

I think this movie would have been charming even if it didn't have well known actors in it.  From the name it's obviously a romantic comedy.  There is a lot going on in this movie too.  Tons of characters and everyone is connected to everyone else in a way.Reed Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) is a florist who has just proposed to his girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba) on Valentine's Day.  She says yes, which surprises all of his friends including coworker Alphonso (George Lopez).  Meanwhile, Julia Fitzpatrick (Jennifer Garner) it troubled because she is going to be spending Valentine's Day without her boyfriend Dr. Harrison Copeland (Patrick Dempsey) and is toying with the fact of surprising him at his work.  However, she doesn't know that he has a wife he intends on surprising instead of working.  On a plane Kate Hazeltine (Julia Roberts) makes friends with Holden Bristow (Bradley Cooper) while she struggles to reach a special someone on her one day leave from the army.  And these are just some of the plot lines running through the movie.  Taylor Swift, Taylor Lautner, Queen Latifah, Shirley MacLaine and others also have their own roles and stories in the movie.Despite all these characters, stories, and connections, the movie was actually easy to follow.  The transitions between characters flowed smoothly and I could remember who was who.  All of the actors did a fantastic job and some of it was uproariously funny.  Anne Hathaway especially had a hilarious role.  Because I did enjoy the characters, I do wish that the movie had been longer so they could have explored each of them further and developed the parts more.The music was great.  Because Taylor Swift was in the movie of course she had a song in it as well.  But there were also songs by Jewel and Carina Round.

Written as romance comedy, the movie is actually an interesting study of love and friendship, and what happens when people find out about things they were not meant to know.

The star-studded film includes about 19 different actors and actresses.

As almost all romantic comedies are, the plot lines are blatantly predictable. Yet that's why we watch them - for the happy endings. From young, puppy love to tender, long-lasting love; Valentine's Day covers it all. There are also plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in this light-hearted feel-good flick.

When I saw Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxx on ""Lopez Tonight,"" I got the impression that this film was going to be a comedy. But while watching the film, it seemed to have too many serious scenes to be considered a comedy. The situation with Ashton Kutcher's character was so sad that it was kind of a downer for the rest of the film, and when he tried to help another friend the scenes after that were predictable. But the ""awkward"" scenes were entertaining. The lady who paid an athlete's publicist was funny at the I Hate Valentine's Day party, but when she was on her own, she just seemed pitiful. George Lopez going fishing cracked me up, but his character wasn't all that interesting and a little stereotypical. Jamie Foxx's character was interesting to watch with his anti-Valentine's Day attitude, but then his ending was a storybook conclusion. Julia Roberts' character was fascinating, but after she got off the plane it reminded me too much of ""Pretty Woman"" with guys being a little too giving and trusting. And the married couple was a complete downer. I felt so bad for the husband, but I guess the film was trying to show that married people work through anything. The phone sex part was overkill, but I thought Queen Latifah's character was funny with the African queen stuff. The crazy part is she was the only one who I didn't see on somebody's talk show pushing the movie heavily, but she was the funniest out of all of these superstars.I'm glad I didn't see this film on Valentine's Day though.

There is an ""older"" love story with the MacLaine character as she tells her husband of thirty years she had an affair years before. At the same time we see a young teen romance between the Lautner and Swift characters and we see Ashton's character coming to terms with being dumped by the girl he has proposed to. There is even a romance between a ten year old who pines away for his school teacher.As the credits roll at the end of the film bloopers are shown. As a bonus too there are many deleted scenes added to the DVD.""Valentine's Day"" was a massive success earning over $200,000,000 and it ultimately has produced a sequel called ""New Year's Eve"" hitting theatres at the end of 2011.

1314028,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG99UE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 8]","""Valentine's Day"", the new film from director Garry Marshall (""Pretty Woman"") owes much of it's inspiration to the far superior ""Love, Actually"", written and directed by Richard Curtis. Both films, set around emotionally charged holidays, depict the loves won and lost by a series of couples. In ""Love, Actually"", the film features an amazing who's who of British actors, most of whom can carry their own films, delivering funny, insightful, romantic and dramatic portrayals of people who are in love and most are confused by it. Most of the characters in ""Love, Actually"" could be the subject of their own films. ""Valentine's Day"" takes the same formula (even throwing in a pivotal scene at LAX to match the first film's scenes at Heathrow) but the acting caliber isn't as good. Neither is the writing and directing for that matter. With a star-studded roster of talent playing the various characters, we are still left with a hollow, empty feeling. None of theIn a film with so many recognizable names, it is difficult to say one or two of these people are the stars, but Reed Bennet played by Ashton Kutcher interacts with a fair number of the other actors, making him one of the more central characters. Reed owns a high-end flower shop and delivers pricey bouquets with his employee (George Lopez) when he isn't helping with the customers flowing into his shop. But Reed isn't simply a defacto Cupid; he is in love and proposes to his girlfriend Morley (Jessica Alba) as soon as she wakes up on Valentine's Day. Later, Alex, a young boy arrives and wants flowers delivered to his teacher (Jennifer Garner) who just happens to be Reed's best friend. A little later, a doctor (Patrick Dempsey) arrives and wants to have flowers delivered to both his girlfriend (Garner) and his wife. Reed becomes worried and decides he has to tell Garner about her boyfriend's indiscretions. Jessica Biel plays a PR Agent, whose client, a football quarterback (Eric Dane), now a free agent, is trying to create some buzz and keep his career afloat. They turn to his agent, Paula (Queen Latifah) for help. She is working with a new temp secretary (Anne Hathaway) who makes the majority of her living doing phone sex in a variety of different voices. She has recently started dating a guy who works in the mailroom (Topher Grace). Things are going well, but she wants to keep her secondary job a secret. Meanwhile, Julia Roberts has fallen asleep on a plane, traveling home to Los Angeles, her head lying against the stranger, Bradley Cooper, in the seat next to her. When she wakes up, they begin to talk and flirt a little, and he learns she is traveling fourteen hours to spend one day with her loved one before traveling fourteen hours back to her military post. And Alex's grandparents (Hector Elizando and Shirley MacLaine) aren't sure how to provide his teenaged babysitter with the advice she needs, she is planning on having sex for the first time with her boyfriend, but things go very wrong. As the two teenagers deal with the news of their impending intercourse traveling among their circle of friends, their two closest friends, played by real-life couple Taylor Lautner (""Twilight"") and Taylor Swift, also give them their two cents worth.I will give the film some credit; as you sit and watch the film, you are never bored. The narrative moves back and forth between the various couplings so fast it would be impossible to be bored. But are these stories particularly well-written or even all that engaging? Not really. Unfortunately, most quickly devolve into bits of pure slapstick or feature over-the-top performances, making them little more believable than an episode of ""Two and a Half Men"".Certain characters work better than others and these characters make their stories more successful. Ashton Kutcher is pretty good as Reed. He has the most screen time and he doesn't seem to waste a minute. He proposes to his girlfriend with a unique proposal, runs off to work and interacts with his co-worker, played by George Lopez. At work, he is, naturally, very busy as he is a florist trying to maintain control of his shop on Valentine's Day. Later, he has to figure out how to deal with the news he learns about his best friend's (Jennifer Garner) relationship and tries to make good on his promise to the 10 year old who wanders into his shop and wants to have some roses delivered to his teacher (also Garner). Throughout this chaotic day, Kutcher maintains a relatively low key performance, given the nature of his character and what we usually get from Kutcher.Jennifer Garner is also good as the young teacher who feels she has finally found true love. Later, when she learns the truth, we feel her pain. Given how quickly these moments happen, it is a testament to the actress' skill that we are able to follow along with her.I also liked the budding relationship between Topher Grace and Anne Hathaway. We pick up their relationship the morning after the first time they sleep together. They seem to be a normal, young, healthy couple. Throughout the day, we learn they both work at the same agency, in entry level positions and we learn a 'funny' secret about Hathaway's character. Frankly, her secondary job isn't all that funny or interesting and it seems included to shock us into laughs when we hear her say scandalous things or use a funny accent to play a character for one of her clients. When Topher learns it is Valentine's Day, he decides to invite her on a real date at a restaurant. Their date provides some genuine comedy that would make this story become the most memorable. But the phone sex thing interferes again and returns as the main focal point of this story, making it seem like little more than a situation comedy.In fact, this is the overriding problem with ""Valentine's Day"". Every time the filmmakers begin to approach anything genuinely funny or touching, the story and situation take a turn for the worse, ruining anything we have already seen.Jessica Biel's character hates the very thought of Valentine's Day and hosts an I Hate Valentine's Day party for her friends. Naturally, because she is so bitter, she will find love, in this case in the form of Jamie Foxx's character, a struggling Sports reporter assigned by his boss (Kathy Bates) to do a puff piece on Valentine's Day. Her party is set at an Indian restaurant where a wedding is also being held. Naturally, as Biel's party gets a little more outrageous, Marshall begins to cut to reactions of the shocked Indian guests. Har, har!Patrick Dempsey's doctor initially appears charming when he gives his girlfriend, Garner, a cute little trinket for Valentine's Day. But his character quickly reveals his true self and has nowhere to go from there. Why does he keep playing these thankless, one-note characters?So why does ""Love, Actually"" work so much better? We spend longer periods with each of the couples before moving on. Each couple has a specific purpose to the story and, in some cases, a specific aspect of love to portray. Oh, let's face it. The main reason ""Actually"" works so much better is that the actors are so much better. Heads and shoulder above their American counterparts. Skyscrapers above their counterparts.Marshall isn't intent to just keep the story moving, flashing from one couple to the next and back again. He also has to make sure we run the entire gamut of emotions throughout the day. Therefore, some moments are so saccharin and sweet, others are meant to be slapstick, others just plain sweet. Some cute and others sexy. But because the actors are a mixed bag, they can't keep up with this changing pace and everything begins to resemble a bouquet of flowers that has been sitting in a vase for too long.",2,"Indifference, Actually",1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,7737,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'new', 'film', 'director', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'much', 'inspiration', 'far', 'superior',

1314031,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG99UE,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","""Valentine's Day"" is directed by Garry Marshall, director of the hit romantic comedy ""Pretty Woman."" His latest outing offers a much more complicated narrative than the film that made Julia Roberts a star 20 years ago. ""Valentine's Day"" is an ensemble rom-com with more than 15 characters in it, and all events happen in one day, on Feb 14. In a sense this project is more ambitious than ""Love Actually"" ... maybe too ambitious.For all these characters seem crammed into the 125-minute film, and not all of them are really memorable. Perhaps you may want to know more about a few characters, like Julia Roberts's Captain Kate Hazeltine traveling 14 hours to make an important rendezvous, or about a unique job by Anne Hathaway's character (speaking in a fake Russian accent). Chances are you may like some of them, but their story is soon interrupted by other less interesting ones, and it takes a while to meet them again.The film's tone shifts restlessly, sometimes very tender, sometimes downright silly, but thankfully it never gets serious, if a bit too sentimental. Though one plot thread resolves with a nice twist, some threads feel rushed and even incomplete, and some scenes should have been left out of the script altogether.The impressive cast includes Jessica Alba, Kathy Bates, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Eric Dane, Patrick Dempsey, Hector Elizondo (Garry Marshall regular), Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Ashton Kutcher, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, George Lopez, Shirley MacLaine, Emma Roberts, Julia Roberts and Taylor Swift. But remember, some of them (Kathy Bates, for instance) appears only for a few minutes.""Valentine's Day"" will be compared with other films with multiple plots like ""Love Actually."" Using an ensemble cast is hard to pull off, especially when the film belongs to the genre that is getting overcrowded every year. ""Valentine's Day"" has moments, both comical and touching, but sadly they will not stay with you for long.",3,"Actually, I'm Just Not That Into This Ensemble Romantic Comedy",1268697600,"03 16, 2010",2010,1990,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'directed', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'director', 'hit', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'latest', 'outing', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'narrative', 'film', 'made', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'star', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'ensemble', 'rom-com', 'more', '15', 'characters', 'events', 'happen', 'one', 'day', 'Feb', '14', 'sense', 'project', 'more', 'ambitious', 'Love', 'Actually', 'maybe', 'too', 'ambitious.For', 'characters', 'seem', 'crammed', '125-minute', 'film', 'not', 'are', 'really', 'memorable', 'Perhaps', 'may', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'few', 'characters', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Captain', 'Kate', 'Hazeltine', 'traveling', '14', 'hours', 'make', 'important', 'rendezvous', 'unique', 'job', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'character', 'speaking', 'fake', 'Russian', 'accent', 'Chances', 'are', 'may', 'like', 'story', 'soon', 'interrupted', 'other', 'less', 'interesting', 'ones', 'while', 'meet', 'again.The', 'film', 'tone', 'shifts', 'restlessly', 'sometimes', 'very', 'tender', 'sometimes', 'downright', 'silly', 'thankfully', 'never', 'serious', 'bit', 'too', 'sentimental', 'one', 'plot', 'thread', 'nice', 'twist', 'threads', 'feel', 'rushed', 'even', 'incomplete', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'script', 'altogether.The', 'impressive', 'cast', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Jessica', 'Biel', 'Bradley', 'Cooper', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Garry', 'Marshall', 'regular', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Jennifer', 'Garner', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Taylor', 'Lautner', 'George', 'Lopez', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'remember', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'instance', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'will', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'multiple', 'plots', 'Love', 'Actually', 'Using', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'hard', 'pull', 'off', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'belongs', 'genre', 'getting', 'overcrowded', 'year', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'moments', 'comical', 'touching', 'sadly', 'will', 'not', 'stay', 'long']",N/A
1314032,A35V32HZEGZH04,B002ZG99UE,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[0, 0]","I watched ""Valentine's Day"" with my wife, and it was not quite what I expected.  I anticipated that, with twenty famous actors, it would be a class B film where numerous temporally unemployed actors appear briefly to get a quick payday.  Instead, I actually think that two actors, Hector Elizondo and Shirley Maclaine took the job seriously.""Valentine's Day"" is a film about the adventures of twelve couples on Valentine's day.  The one thing  in common about each couple is that, in one way or another, they celebrate the holiday.The variety of celebrations is impressive.  Some unique celebrations are: a party of those who hate the holiday; couples gathered in a cemetery to watch old movies; and a jilted girl showing up at her lover's dinner party to serve him stuffed castrated hog.Some of the couple combinations were interesting: there is the press agent paired with the sports announcer, the physician with two dates, the ""phone sex"" girl with an Indiana conservative, and an African queen with a sex starved Russian.  One couple actually celebrates in their home with their children.Valentine's Day"" is not a bad movie.  Instead of a plot it really has a least twelve plots.  This could be changed into a really good movie by singling out one of the better themes and presenting it in more detail.  I nominate the two grandparents whose  celebration of love impresses their grandchildren.  Another decent theme is the one where a man discovers that his best friend is a better candidate for a lasting love than the girl he is chasing.  A third possibility is the tale of a NFL quarterback who discovers what is really meaningful in his life.So, if you like having a brief glimpse of Hollywood stars, watch this film, or get a tape of the last Oscar awards.  Otherwise, I suggest you read a good book.  .",3,Too Many Stars?,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,1813,"['watched', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'wife', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'expected', 'anticipated', 'twenty', 'famous', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'class', 'B', 'film', 'where', 'numerous', 'temporally', 'unemployed', 'actors', 'appear', 'briefly', 'get', 'quick', 'payday', 'Instead', 'actually', 'think', 'two', 'actors', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'took', 'job', 'seriously', 'Valentine', 'Day', 'film', 'adventures', 'twelve', 'couples', 'Valentine', 'day', 'one', 'thing', 'common', 'couple', 'one', 'way', 'celebrate', 'holiday.The', 'variety', 'celebrations', 'impressive', 'unique', 'celebrations', 'are', 'party', 'who', 'hate', 'holiday', 'couples', 'gathered', 'cemetery', 'watch', 'old', 'movies', 'jilted', 'girl', 'showing', 'up', 'lover', 'dinner', 'party', 'serve', 'stuffed', 'castrated', 'hog.Some', 'couple', 'combinations', 'were', 'interesting', 'press', 'agent', 'paired', 'sports', 'announcer', 'physician', 'two', 'dates', 'phone', 'sex', 'girl', 'Indiana', 'conservative', 'African', 'queen', 'sex', 'starved', 'Russian', 'One', 'couple', 'actually', 'home', 'children.Valentine', 'Day', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Instead', 'plot', 'really', 'least', 'twelve', 'plots', 'could', 'be', 'changed', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'singling', 'out', 'one', 'better', 'themes', 'presenting', 'more', 'detail', 'nominate', 'two', 'grandparents', 'celebration', 'love', 'impresses', 'grandchildren', 'decent', 'theme', 'one', 'where', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'better', 'candidate', 'lasting', 'love', 'girl', 'chasing', 'third', 'possibility', 'tale', 'NFL', 'quarterback', 'who', 'what', 'really', 'meaningful', 'life.So', 'like', 'having', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'watch', 'film', 'get', 'tape', 'last', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'Otherwise', 'suggest', 'read', 'good', 'book']",N/A
