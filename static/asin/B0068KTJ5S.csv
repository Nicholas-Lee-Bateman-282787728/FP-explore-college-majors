The scenery and action is so real.  Many of these characters have gone on to be with their Saviour in real life.  Its a wonderful movie that takes place in the 19th century about a circuit riding preacher and the amazing things he prayed for and what those real camp meeting days were like. Revival meetings were portrayed with realism.,5,Sheffey best Christian movie historical film 19th century,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,436,"['Sheffey', 'one', 'best', 'Christian', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'photography', 'acting', 'supurb', 'scenery', 'action', 'so', 'real', 'Many', 'characters', 'have', 'gone', 'be', 'Saviour', 'real', 'life', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'place', '19th', 'century', 'circuit', 'riding', 'preacher', 'amazing', 'things', 'prayed', 'what', 'real', 'camp', 'meeting', 'days', 'were', 'like', 'Revival', 'meetings', 'were', 'portrayed', 'realism']",Sheffey
1513338,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B0068KTJ5S,C. Long,"[1, 1]","This movie tells the story of Robert Sheffey, an interesting and inspiring circuit-riding preacher in the 19th century. It is based upon true events, though some things surrounding Sheffey may be folklore. This movie is a very interesting portrayal of a man that seemed to just be passionate about Jesus and bringing people to Him. It is not really a documentary per se, but you will feel like you've gotten to know Sheffey after seeing the movie. Simple faith, love put in practice, concern for people and all of God's creation, the power of prayer, the importance of being born again, dangers of alcohol, importance of forgiveness, dead religion vs. genuine faith, the futility of living for this world as opposed to living for God, and much more are prevalent themes in this movie.It was produced/filmed in the late 1970's by Bob Jones University. Now, my first thought when I found this out, even before watching the movie, was: ""How good can the quality of this film possibly be, given it was basically done by a Christian University in the late 70's?"" Well, the answer to that is: ""Better than you might think!"" Although you can definitely tell this was a non-Hollywood production from the late 70's, the quality level is actually reasonably good all things considered - especially since the film was remastered for DVD. The acting is a bit stilted and the dialog is definitely predictable in places, and I did think there were a few scenes that bordered on being ""cringe worthy"". But overall, this 2+ hour movie was reasonably done - it held my attention - and the acting, while not great, didn't really distract too much - it was alright all things considered.Not everything in the film is necessarily 100% on the mark - and some of the ""Christianny scenes"" were VERY predictable. But I do believe this movie can be a real encouragement to Christians of the importance of really believing and living out our faith. As for kids watching this, I think this can definitely be a ""family night"" movie, but be aware that younger children might get bored with it.Reviewed by MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Interesting and Encouraging,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2122,"['movie', 'story', 'Robert', 'Sheffey', 'interesting', 'inspiring', 'circuit-riding', 'preacher', '19th', 'century', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'things', 'surrounding', 'Sheffey', 'may', 'be', 'folklore', 'movie', 'very', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'man', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', 'passionate', 'Jesus', 'bringing', 'people', 'Him', 'not', 'really', 'documentary', 'se', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'know', 'Sheffey', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Simple', 'faith', 'love', 'put', 'practice', 'concern', 'people', 'God', 'creation', 'power', 'prayer', 'importance', 'being', 'born', 'again', 'dangers', 'alcohol', 'importance', 'forgiveness', 'dead', 'religion', 'vs.', 'genuine', 'faith', 'futility', 'living', 'world', 'opposed', 'living', 'God', 'much', 'more', 'are', 'prevalent', 'themes', 'movie.It', 'was', 'produced/filmed', 'late', '1970', 'Bob', 'Jones', 'University', 'Now', 'first', 'thought', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'even', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'How', 'good', 'can', 'quality', 'film', 'possibly', 'be', 'given', 'was', 'basically', 'done', 'Christian', 'University', 'late', '70', 'Well', 'answer', 'Better', 'might', 'think', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'was', 'non-Hollywood', 'production', 'late', '70', 'quality', 'level', 'actually', 'reasonably', 'good', 'things', 'considered', 'especially', 'film', 'was', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'acting', 'bit', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'definitely', 'predictable', 'places', 'did', 'think', 'were', 'few', 'scenes', 'bordered', 'being', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'overall', '2+', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'reasonably', 'done', 'held', 'attention', 'acting', 'not', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'distract', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'alright', 'things', 'considered.Not', 'everything', 'film', 'necessarily', '100', '%', 'mark', 'Christianny', 'scenes', 'were', 'VERY', 'predictable', 'do', 'believe', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'real', 'encouragement', 'Christians', 'importance', 'really', 'believing', 'living', 'out', 'faith', 'kids', 'watching', 'think', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'family', 'night', 'movie', 'be', 'aware', 'younger', 'children', 'might', 'get', 'bored', 'it.Reviewed', 'MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",Sheffey

It was made by Liberty Bible College students as a project, but they have produced an excellent movie of a country evangelist in the 1800s.  Sheffey had an amazing encounter with the Lord and left behind a life that would guarantee education and success in business.  Instead he went to the mountain people with the message of the love of Jesus.  He not only preached it, but he lived it.  His experiences with the mountain people are certain to touch your heart.  There is a particular section where he gives away his beloved horse to a poor family along the road that is certain to bring tears to your eyes.

A little over 2 hours long and it seemed so short-due to the fact of how INTERESTING it was. Both my husband and I was glued to the tv. It showed perserverence in the face of many troubles. We both had a few laughs on how he got thru to a few of the people he went to preach to and a few tears during a couple of the emotional scenes.*************************&#8203;******************************&#8203;******************************&#8203;******************************&#8203;******************************&#8203;*This would be a GREAT movie for anyone who wants to take a glimpse into what people back then had to do to spread the Word of God.
