978438,A3BVRA2QL3TIOQ,B000ERVKGC,carl womack,"[9, 9]","Mike investigates the death of a tobacco company scientist who was going to expose the company's corrupt tactics to get people to smoke more. Plus Mike also finds himself investigating the murder of one of the family members who owns the company.As with all Mike Hammer episodes (starring Stacy Keach) there's perfectly timed action, drama, suspense and a bit of humor.Mike Hammer isn't like many detectives. He doesn't win all the fights he's in, and he's often behind on his rent. Mike is pretty much like the real deal, in fact he's as close to the real thing as you can get. He uses deduction and luck to solve his cases, and he uses the aide of his employees Nick and Velda to help him.A New Leaf is not the best of the Mike Hammer videos, but it is ok to watch for the fact it does have a pretty good plot to it. There are dozens of suspects to choose from to try and figure out ""who done it"".But what makes this story unique for Mike Hammer fans is that Mike is told by his doctor that he needs to quit smoking or he'll die very soon. So he does, but not without cost. He immediately begins eating like a pig, and being ill tempered to everyone he comes in contact with, including Velda and Nick. Quitting smoking is hard enough, but when Mike is asked by the company to be their model, it really becomes a pain.So if you like do watch ""who done it"" movies, you will find Mike Hammer in New Leaf to be a pretty good story to watch.",4,Mike Hammer Takes On Big Tobacco,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1438,"['Mike', 'death', 'tobacco', 'company', 'scientist', 'who', 'was', 'going', 'expose', 'company', 'corrupt', 'tactics', 'get', 'people', 'smoke', 'more', 'Mike', 'also', 'investigating', 'murder', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'company.As', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'episodes', 'starring', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'bit', 'humor.Mike', 'Hammer', ""n't"", 'like', 'many', 'detectives', ""n't"", 'win', 'fights', 'often', 'rent', 'Mike', 'pretty', 'much', 'real', 'deal', 'fact', 'as', 'close', 'real', 'thing', 'can', 'get', 'deduction', 'luck', 'solve', 'cases', 'aide', 'employees', 'Nick', 'Velda', 'help', 'him.A', 'New', 'Leaf', 'not', 'best', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'videos', 'ok', 'watch', 'fact', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'plot', 'are', 'dozens', 'suspects', 'choose', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'done', 'what', 'story', 'unique', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'fans', 'Mike', 'told', 'doctor', 'quit', 'smoking', ""'ll"", 'die', 'very', 'soon', 'not', 'cost', 'immediately', 'eating', 'pig', 'being', 'ill', 'tempered', 'everyone', 'contact', 'including', 'Velda', 'Nick', 'Quitting', 'smoking', 'hard', 'enough', 'when', 'Mike', 'asked', 'company', 'be', 'model', 'really', 'pain.So', 'like', 'do', 'watch', 'who', 'done', 'movies', 'will', 'find', 'Mike', 'Hammer', 'New', 'Leaf', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'watch']",N/A
