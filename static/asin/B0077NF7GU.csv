It is similar to three other ones who use humor to deal with the topic of zombies (the other ones being excellent: Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Warm Bodies).The plot follows the usual pattern, relieved by the comedy. One of the survivors is his buddy who accidentally harpoons live, non-zombies. Another is a huge, muscular guy who faints at the sight of blood and so, has to be led around blindfolded so he doesn't faint at the sight of bloodied zombies, but he fights them off through the instructions of his flaming gay lover. The movie also has a number of jabs at the government: the government spokesman refers to the zombies as being really dissidents in the pay of the Americans. Also, what does Juan decide to do when the Socialist world is collapsing all around him? Why, he goes for capitalism and establishes a business. When he answers the phone, he says, ""Juan of the Dead. We kill your loved ones. How can I help you?""Unfortunately, the ending is unsatisfying.

1527583,AYG1U47VFZ165,B0077NF7GU,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I really wanted to find something exceptional to say about JUAN OF THE DEAD, mostly because I'm a pretty big fan of zombie flicks - even those with ample doses of humor, but the best I can say is that it wasn't a bad film.  It just wasn't all that particularly entertaining.  I think the central problem I had with it was that it was a comedy, and, as a comedy, it just didn't bring anything all that new to the picture.  Granted, it was novel using the `zombie' storyline metaphorically against the plight of the Cuban people ... but, creatively, is that all ya got?Juan (played by Alexis Diaz de Villegas) is a bit of a slacker/loser/nitwit.  Down on his luck in a land that has little to offer, he's taken to doing odd jobs in order to make the occasional buck.  However, when he seeks to reconnect with his young daughter, wouldn't you know it that the island would suddenly be overrun by zombies?  Now, he's found a new career - ""taking out the undead"" (meaning ""disposing of zombies for a price"") - and he finds he's finally good at something in life.  But will he allow his little girl to grow up in a land overrun by the Undead, or will he become a better person and see to it that she's given escape from the danger?  And ... will he go with her now that he's finally found his calling?Quite a bit of JUAN OF DEAD humorously mirrors much territory already covered by SHAUN OF THE DEAD (not necessarily a bad thing), but the film is held back by its independent budget.  A few of the special effects are almost laughably bad (maybe that's what the producers intended, or was it all they could afford?), but the zombie make-up and splatter-gore is probably as good as anything else done inside or outside Hollywood or any major studio these days.  As I said above, my chief complaint is that, independently, the film just didn't plumb any new ground.  The social commentary was interesting, but it's hardly enough to sustain a picture at 96 minutes.Still, Mr. de Villegas does an awfully nice job attacking the simple material, and he gleans quite a bit of mileage out of some wonderfully deadpan delivery.  Plus, he's surrounded here by an impressive assortment of nitwits and oddballs that serve up a handful of respectable laughs.  As a zombie picture, it's clearly flawed, but as a comedy it's probably worth the chuckles.  There's nothing wrong with being a middle-of-the-road horror comedy, and, on that level alone, JUAN won't win accolades but may win over its share of fans.JUAN OF THE DEAD is produced by La Zanfona Producciones and Producciones de la 5ta Avenida.  DVD distribution is being handled through EntertainmentOne.  The film is written and directed by Alejandro Brugues, and I'd certainly be inclined to watch how his career develops.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't add that the film served as an Official Selection to the Toronto International Film Festival.  It all looks and sounds pretty spiffy, though I did have to crank up the volume on this one as compared to other discs in order to hear the center (dialogue) track.  Special features?  Well, they're acceptable; there's a brief behind-the-scenes featurette along with a few deleted scenes (nothing all that grand, frankly).RECOMMENDED for fans of zombie flicks and, certainly, anyone who likes their horror with more than a few laughs.  While JUAN OF THE DEAD certainly isn't bloody brilliant, it's passable fair, especially given the fact that it's an import here.  I'd imagine Cuban had a lot of fun with this homegrown zombie comedy, but, for all its gore, it left me only wanting more.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at EntertainmentOne (EOne) provided me with a DVD screener copy of JUAN OF THE DEAD by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Average Zom-Com Produces Modest Laughs for JUAN and All!,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,3801,"['really', 'wanted', 'find', 'something', 'exceptional', 'say', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'mostly', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'even', 'ample', 'doses', 'humor', 'best', 'can', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'think', 'central', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'was', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'picture', 'Granted', 'was', 'novel', 'using', 'zombie', 'storyline', 'metaphorically', 'plight', 'Cuban', 'people', 'creatively', 'ya', 'got', 'Juan', 'played', 'Alexis', 'Diaz', 'Villegas', 'bit', 'slacker/loser/nitwit', 'Down', 'luck', 'land', 'little', 'offer', 'taken', 'doing', 'odd', 'jobs', 'order', 'make', 'occasional', 'buck', 'However', 'when', 'reconnect', 'young', 'daughter', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'island', 'would', 'suddenly', 'be', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'Now', 'found', 'new', 'career', 'taking', 'out', 'undead', 'meaning', 'disposing', 'zombies', 'price', 'finally', 'good', 'something', 'life', 'will', 'allow', 'little', 'girl', 'grow', 'up', 'land', 'overrun', 'Undead', 'will', 'become', 'better', 'person', 'see', 'given', 'escape', 'danger', 'will', 'go', 'now', 'finally', 'found', 'calling', 'bit', 'JUAN', 'OF', 'DEAD', 'humorously', 'mirrors', 'much', 'territory', 'already', 'covered', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'film', 'held', 'back', 'independent', 'budget', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'almost', 'laughably', 'bad', 'maybe', 'what', 'producers', 'intended', 'was', 'could', 'afford', 'zombie', 'make-up', 'splatter-gore', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'anything', 'else', 'done', 'inside', 'outside', 'Hollywood', 'major', 'studio', 'days', 'said', 'chief', 'complaint', 'independently', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'plumb', 'new', 'ground', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'interesting', 'hardly', 'enough', 'sustain', 'picture', '96', 'minutes.Still', 'Mr.', 'de', 'Villegas', 'awfully', 'nice', 'job', 'attacking', 'simple', 'material', 'quite', 'bit', 'mileage', 'wonderfully', 'deadpan', 'delivery', 'surrounded', 'here', 'impressive', 'assortment', 'nitwits', 'oddballs', 'serve', 'up', 'handful', 'respectable', 'laughs', 'zombie', 'picture', 'clearly', 'flawed', 'comedy', 'probably', 'worth', 'chuckles', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'middle-of-the-road', 'horror', 'comedy', 'level', 'alone', 'JUAN', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'accolades', 'may', 'win', 'over', 'share', 'fans.JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'produced', 'La', 'Zanfona', 'Producciones', 'Producciones', 'de', 'la', '5ta', 'Avenida', 'DVD', 'distribution', 'being', 'handled', 'EntertainmentOne', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Alejandro', 'Brugues', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'be', 'inclined', 'watch', 'how', 'career', 'develops', 'Also', ""'d"", 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'film', 'served', 'Official', 'Selection', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'looks', 'pretty', 'spiffy', 'did', 'have', 'crank', 'up', 'volume', 'one', 'compared', 'other', 'discs', 'order', 'hear', 'center', 'dialogue', 'track', 'Special', 'features', 'Well', ""'re"", 'acceptable', 'brief', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'grand', 'frankly', '.RECOMMENDED', 'fans', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'certainly', 'anyone', 'who', 'horror', 'more', 'few', 'laughs', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'bloody', 'brilliant', 'passable', 'fair', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', 'import', 'here', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'Cuban', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'homegrown', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'gore', 'left', 'only', 'wanting', 'more.In', 'interests', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'disclose', 'fine', 'folks', 'EntertainmentOne', 'EOne', 'provided', 'DVD', 'screener', 'copy', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'request', 'expressed', 'purposes', 'completing', 'review']",Juan of the Dead

I can't attest to its landmark creds, JUAN OF THE DEAD supposedly the first zombie film to come out of Cuba. And the parallels to SHAUN OF THE DEAD are glaringly obvious. I do know that I had a lot of fun watching it. That, in terms of viewer gratification, JUAN OF THE DEAD makes a fine ambassador to world cinema. Who knew a Cuban cast & crew can shoot a subversive picture in Cuba that pokes fun at their own government and not get, uh, frowned at for it? I did hear the film's early screening took place at the firing range (no, it didn't).Tall and gangly slacker Juan (Alexis D&iacute;az de Villegas) has a mantra: ""I survived Mariel, I survived Angola, I survived the Special Period... Just give me a chance, and I'll sort it out."" Both at 40-something, he and his bumbling best friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) have reached that age in which regret at having lived a wasted life begins to eat away. In repressed Havana, Cuba, Juan and Lazaro are caught in day-to-day inertia. Sometimes they eke out a living by fishing off their raft. And, sometimes, they indulge in petty crimes. To Juan's ongoing dismay, his estranged daughter Camila (Andrea Duro) wants no part of him. I think she's very sensible. Juan dreams of redeeming himself in his kid's eyes. Here's his chance coming.Should the zombie apocalypse hit Havana, could you tell the difference? That's one of the running jokes that abound in this film. Promising writer/director Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s injects his pet project with irreverence. He lobs wicked social commentary at the expense of the Castro administration and what it's wrought. In Cuba, Miami is viewed as the promised land. Characters in the film occasionally voice an ongoing internal conflict: stay home with their roots or seek out a better life across the waters. As the infection grows, Cuban news media quickly appoint most of the blame to US-affiliated ""dissidents"" (and a bit of the blame on the ""expired drugs at the polyclinic"").But where others eye the end of the world, Juan sees opportunity. He gathers his motley posse and launches a zombie-slaying service. Nowadays, he answers the telephone like so: ""Juan of the Dead. We kill your loved ones."" But, of course, in Spanish. Not a news flash: JUAN OF THE DEAD - or ""Juan de los muertos"" - is filmed in Spanish with English sub-titles.JUAN OF THE DEAD is both hilarious send-up and gory splatterfest, a credible cousin to SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Lead actor Alexis D&iacute;az de Villegas, who himself boasts a zombie's wasted musculature, heads a cast that seems to be having fun but not neglecting to put in some good work. Amidst the snide tomfoolery, there's good character development and also moments of pathos. I think I'll keep an eye out for more of this director's work. Against all odds, Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s has crafted a highly watchable picture. Even Fidel Castro gave this one a thumbs up (no, he didn't).The DVD's bonus stuff:- Making Of featurete (00:18:09 minutes, in Spanish with English sub-titles)- 13 Deleted Scenes (00:13:35 minutes, with director & cast commentary)- Trailer",4,"Shuffling, bloodthirsty zombies... or nasty dissidents?",1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,3157,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'panacea', 'zombie', 'fatigue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'attest', 'landmark', 'creds', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'supposedly', 'first', 'zombie', 'film', 'come', 'Cuba', 'parallels', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'are', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'do', 'know', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'terms', 'viewer', 'gratification', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'fine', 'ambassador', 'world', 'cinema', 'Who', 'knew', 'Cuban', 'cast', 'crew', 'can', 'shoot', 'subversive', 'picture', 'Cuba', 'fun', 'own', 'government', 'not', 'get', 'uh', 'frowned', 'did', 'hear', 'film', 'early', 'screening', 'took', 'place', 'firing', 'range', 'did', ""n't"", '.Tall', 'gangly', 'slacker', 'Juan', 'Alexis', 'D', 'iacute', 'Villegas', 'mantra', 'survived', 'Mariel', 'survived', 'Angola', 'survived', 'Special', 'Period', 'Just', 'give', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'sort', 'out', '40-something', 'bumbling', 'best', 'friend', 'Lazaro', 'Jorge', 'Molina', 'have', 'reached', 'age', 'regret', 'having', 'lived', 'wasted', 'life', 'eat', 'away', 'repressed', 'Havana', 'Cuba', 'Juan', 'Lazaro', 'are', 'caught', 'day-to-day', 'inertia', 'Sometimes', 'eke', 'out', 'living', 'fishing', 'off', 'raft', 'sometimes', 'indulge', 'petty', 'crimes', 'Juan', 'ongoing', 'dismay', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Camila', 'Andrea', 'Duro', 'part', 'think', 'very', 'sensible', 'Juan', 'dreams', 'redeeming', 'kid', 'eyes', 'Here', 'chance', 'coming.Should', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'hit', 'Havana', 'could', 'tell', 'difference', 'one', 'running', 'jokes', 'abound', 'film', 'Promising', 'writer/director', 'Alejandro', 'Brugu', 'eacute', 'pet', 'project', 'irreverence', 'wicked', 'social', 'commentary', 'expense', 'Castro', 'administration', 'what', 'wrought', 'Cuba', 'Miami', 'viewed', 'promised', 'land', 'Characters', 'film', 'occasionally', 'ongoing', 'internal', 'conflict', 'stay', 'home', 'roots', 'seek', 'out', 'better', 'life', 'waters', 'infection', 'Cuban', 'news', 'media', 'quickly', 'appoint', 'most', 'blame', 'US-affiliated', 'dissidents', 'bit', 'blame', 'expired', 'drugs', 'polyclinic', '.But', 'where', 'others', 'eye', 'end', 'world', 'Juan', 'opportunity', 'motley', 'posse', 'zombie-slaying', 'service', 'telephone', 'so', 'Juan', 'Dead', 'kill', 'loved', 'ones', 'course', 'Spanish', 'Not', 'news', 'flash', 'JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'Juan', 'de', 'los', 'muertos', 'filmed', 'Spanish', 'English', 'sub-titles.JUAN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'hilarious', 'send-up', 'gory', 'splatterfest', 'credible', 'cousin', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'Lead', 'actor', 'Alexis', 'D', 'iacute', 'Villegas', 'who', 'zombie', 'wasted', 'musculature', 'cast', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'not', 'neglecting', 'put', 'good', 'work', 'Amidst', 'snide', 'tomfoolery', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'also', 'moments', 'pathos', 'think', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'more', 'director', 'work', 'odds', 'Alejandro', 'Brugu', 'eacute', 'crafted', 'highly', 'watchable', 'picture', 'Even', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'gave', 'one', 'thumbs', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", '.The', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Making', 'featurete', '00:18:09', 'minutes', 'Spanish', 'English', 'sub-titles', '13', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', '00:13:35', 'minutes', 'director', 'cast', 'commentary', 'Trailer']",Juan of the Dead

1527588,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B0077NF7GU,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 0]","I ask one thing above all else of a horror - and in particular a zombie - movie: surprise me.  And, of course, by &#34;surprise&#34; I don't mean having someone leap out of nowhere; rather, I mean, bringing something original to the genre - and &#34;Juan of the Dead&#34; succeeds in spades on that one.  Yes, if you can scare me too that would be nice; but having watched so many horror films over such a long period, I don't honestly believe any movie's really, truly going to scare me very much.  Also, while the movie is long on innuendo and even whimsy, it is mercifully short on gore - even when a virtual army of zombies are beheaded en masse.I was a little leery going into this film since the blurb on the DVD case flat out compares it to &#34;Shaun of the Dead.&#34;  But, to my pleasant surprise, &#34;Juan of the Dead&#34; bears no resemblance other than in the title.  Nor does it bear much resemblance to other foreign language zombie films - and for one primary reason: I had to actually read the English subtitles at the bottom of the screen, word by word.  Why?  Because there really was a story here; and that story was indigenous to the setting - Havana, Cuba; whereas almost every other zombie film I've seen that had sub-titles could have taken place anywhere in the world.  And whereas the dialogue of most zombie films is strictly survival oriented, the dialogue here was mostly based on the culture where the story takes place.  In fact, only one character in the entire film - an American preacher with a stillborn plan to save the survivors - ever referred to the zombies as &#34;zombies.&#34;  They were mostly depicted simply as &#34;dissidents.&#34;  And their sudden appearance on the scene was simply taken for granted - no attempt was made to figure out how they became zombies; the prevailing attitude was &#34;oh well, here they are...we'll have to find a way around them so we can go on with our normal life.&#34;  In fact it was only near the end that leaving Havana was even considered an option.The movie it reminded most of, particularly in the main characters' laid back attitude, was the British zombie flick &#34;Dog House.&#34;  Like the characters in &#34;Dog House,&#34; Juan and his friends never really took the zombies all that seriously; and, accordingly, never took great pains to thwart their attack or to make their way past them.  Quite frequently, when some characteristic of the zombies was pointed out, the response was to shrug it off as pretty much like the people's normal routine anyway.  And in its suggestion of the attempt to preserve normalcy in the midst of a zombie onslaught, it reminded me a great deal of the zombie movie &#34;The Mad&#34; starring Billy Zane, wherein the zombies are not even discovered to be undead until they have already wreaked havoc on the community.The ending leaves the viewer with a quandary: when the others escape, in a makeshift boat, Juan chooses to remain behind.  Given his encounter with a zombie while saving a boy just minutes before he's to join the others, one has to wonder if he was bitten or if, as he tells them, he doesn't want to leave Cuba.  It's a mystery, and always will be.",5,What A Surprise!,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,3190,"['ask', 'one', 'thing', 'else', 'horror', 'particular', 'zombie', 'movie', 'surprise', 'course', '34', 'surprise', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'having', 'someone', 'leap', 'nowhere', 'rather', 'mean', 'bringing', 'something', 'original', 'genre', '34', 'Juan', 'Dead', '34', 'spades', 'one', 'Yes', 'can', 'scare', 'too', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'having', 'watched', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'films', 'long', 'period', 'do', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'believe', 'movie', 'really', 'truly', 'going', 'scare', 'very', 'much', 'Also', 'movie', 'long', 'innuendo', 'even', 'whimsy', 'mercifully', 'short', 'gore', 'even', 'when', 'virtual', 'army', 'zombies', 'are', 'beheaded', 'masse.I', 'was', 'little', 'leery', 'going', 'film', 'blurb', 'DVD', 'case', 'flat', 'out', '34', 'Shaun', 'Dead.', '34', 'pleasant', 'surprise', '34', 'Juan', 'Dead', '34', 'resemblance', 'other', 'title', 'bear', 'much', 'resemblance', 'other', 'foreign', 'language', 'zombie', 'films', 'one', 'primary', 'reason', 'had', 'actually', 'read', 'English', 'subtitles', 'bottom', 'screen', 'word', 'word', 'Why', 'really', 'was', 'story', 'here', 'story', 'was', 'indigenous', 'setting', 'Havana', 'Cuba', 'whereas', 'almost', 'other', 'zombie', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'had', 'sub-titles', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'anywhere', 'world', 'dialogue', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'strictly', 'survival', 'oriented', 'dialogue', 'here', 'was', 'mostly', 'based', 'culture', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'fact', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'American', 'preacher', 'stillborn', 'plan', 'save', 'survivors', 'ever', 'referred', 'zombies', '34', 'zombies.', '34', 'were', 'mostly', 'depicted', 'simply', '34', 'dissidents.', '34', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'scene', 'was', 'simply', 'taken', 'granted', 'attempt', 'was', 'made', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'became', 'zombies', 'prevailing', 'attitude', 'was', '34', 'oh', 'well', 'here', 'are', ""'ll"", 'have', 'find', 'way', 'can', 'go', 'normal', 'life.', '34', 'fact', 'was', 'only', 'end', 'leaving', 'Havana', 'was', 'even', 'considered', 'option.The', 'movie', 'reminded', 'most', 'particularly', 'main', 'characters', 'laid', 'back', 'attitude', 'was', 'British', 'zombie', 'flick', '34', 'Dog', 'House.', '34', 'characters', '34', 'Dog', 'House', '34', 'Juan', 'friends', 'never', 'really', 'took', 'zombies', 'seriously', 'accordingly', 'never', 'took', 'great', 'pains', 'thwart', 'attack', 'make', 'way', 'Quite', 'frequently', 'when', 'characteristic', 'zombies', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'response', 'was', 'shrug', 'off', 'pretty', 'much', 'people', 'normal', 'routine', 'anyway', 'suggestion', 'attempt', 'preserve', 'normalcy', 'midst', 'zombie', 'onslaught', 'reminded', 'great', 'deal', 'zombie', 'movie', '34', 'Mad', '34', 'starring', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'wherein', 'zombies', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'discovered', 'be', 'undead', 'have', 'already', 'wreaked', 'havoc', 'community.The', 'ending', 'viewer', 'quandary', 'when', 'others', 'escape', 'makeshift', 'boat', 'Juan', 'remain', 'Given', 'encounter', 'zombie', 'saving', 'boy', 'just', 'minutes', 'join', 'others', 'one', 'wonder', 'was', 'bitten', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'Cuba', 'mystery', 'always', 'will', 'be']",Juan of the Dead

But with the current zombie craze reaching an all time high, it seems like every other movie, TV show, and book features my flesh eating friends! There's a LOT of contemporary zombie action, so it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish something truly special from the crowded pack. The perfectly titled ""Juan of the Dead"" is a movie I wanted to see and thought I'd almost assuredly like. I assumed it would be an amusing, if not particularly substantial, addition to the undead canon. Well, not only did I like it, I LOVED this little Cuban film. (Yes, it is in subtitles). It takes familiar horror and survivalist themes and filters them through a deceptively smart and engaging screenplay. What's more, it is absolutely hilarious! I laughed out loud often in ""Juan of the Dead"" and that came as somewhat of a surprise to me. It is simultaneously silly AND witty. An astute political satire, an unusual cultural commentary, a non-stop splatter-fest, as well as a feast of slapstick mayhem: ""Juan of the Dead"" has emerged as one of my favorite films this year, a truly memorable horror comedy.First, the film benefits greatly from its Cuban flavor which, right off the bat, makes it feel different from other comparable films. Juan (Alexis Dias de Villegas) is an irresponsible slacker who wastes most of every day with his clueless best friend Lazardo (Jorge Molina). The two actors play off each other so well, it's hard not to laugh at just about every interaction they have. Without much explanation, they start to notice unusual changes to their surroundings. With reports of a strange flu, a movement of alleged political dissidents, and a suspected American plot, the news reports seems to have figured out what is going on. Listen closely, there is much humor to be mined from these broadcasts but they are often in the background. But Juan and Lazardo are above politics and as their neighborhood turns to murder and carnage, their instinct for survival and capitalism kick in. With a group of companions and friends (including their grown children), they set to ridding Cuba from the attacking dissidents (the ridiculous explanation given for the undead) for a handsome fee.The movie is fast, incredibly fun, and really really funny. Seriously, writer/director Alejandro Brugues has done a commendable job balancing the disparate elements of the film and made it an experience that you can appreciate for both its smarts and its silliness. I love that this is the first film to be shot in contemporary Cuba without government financing and that it still so candidly hits its satiric political targets. The creatures and effects aren't exactly high tech, but they fit perfectly into this underdog film. Remember, this isn't a big budget Hollywood affair, that's part of its appeal. There is plenty of blood and gruesomeness amidst the laughter. ""Juan of the Dead"" exceeded my expectations at every turn! If you like horror/comedy (obviously, this even gives a nod to Shawn of the Dead with its title), I give this my complete support and biggest recommendation. A great buddy comedy, you might even be surprised by the amount of heart this little film has as well as it draws to its conclusion. Absolutely loved it, the most fun I've had with a movie in quite a while.

However, if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, Fido, and other similar films this movie is definitely worth your time.The movie centers around Juan, living aimlessly in Havana (the movie shows how beautiful Cuba can be, and how sad and decayed life in Havana is under communism).  He spends his time on fishing and petty crime along with his similarly minded associates.  Juan has survived many bad times (there is mention of Angola and the ""special period"" of starvation in Cuba) and has no desire to leave Cuba, considering himself a survivor.  His primary emotional attachment is to his estranged daughter, who thinks little of him and tells him that she and her mother are moving to Miami (mom is already in Spain).The movie shows the zombie outbreak through the lens of state media, where the zombies are mistaken as ""dissidents"" supported or directed by Americans.  The official story wears thin as time goes on (and society collapses).  Juan and his associates try to maintain their existence through the downward spiral.  Finally, the group (with Juan's daughter) start a ""business"" of zombie eradication -- being paid to deal with their customers re-animated loved ones.There are many fun scenes and plot developments that give laugh out loud moments.  There are some times when the movie loses focus and scenes seem disjointed.

I will give the movie points for its exotic setting and for sneaking in some subtle geo-political satire along with its walking dead, but I just didn't think the overall effect was as potent as some reviews make it seem.Slacker Juan and his friends turn entrepreneurial when a plague of zombies hits Havana - for a fee, they will rid you of your dead loved ones.  Juan and his misfit crew are the closest thing that Cuba has for heroes, but when Juan finally turn away from merely pecuniary interests toward humanitarian, he finds a zeal for his country and the love of his daughter that he'd never had before.The 'zombie slacker' film pioneered by Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead was, in the beginning, a great twist on a concept starting to grow cold.  It still can be an effective satirical tool, and Juan of the Dead does score some points off of U.S-Cuban relations, the Cuban culture, and human nature in general.  That was probably where the movie was most successful.  There is also a lot more of the film that veers toward slapstick, or at least broad comedy, which some viewers will appreciate and others won't.Though the comedy is uneven, the acting is good.

The band of freedom fighters are a very Motley Crew indeed which include a Muscle Mary who faints at the sight of blood and they use any weapon they can from nun chucks to boat paddles - genius.This is a brilliant and refreshing film which although it has Zombies at its core has a great big heart that it wears on its sleeve all tied up with more gags than you can shake a stick at.

One day an old man he knows starts acting strangely, like trying to bite him. The government blames the domestic ""dissidents"" and foreign intervention for the bloody chaos that follows. So what should Juan do? Start up a company with his slacker friend Lazaro (Jorge Molina) and make money by getting rid of the ""dissidents,"" of course!First, a Spanish-Cuban movie ""Juan of the Dead"" (""Juan de los Muertos"") is a comedy. Or I should call it a zombie horror comedy. ""Juan"" does parody the zombie movie genre's numerous conventions as ""Shaun of the Dead"" does, but what is really great about Alejandro Brugu&eacute;s' film is the film's satirical edge that is aimed at the country's current situation. The two main characters' behaviors are for the most part far from heroic, and probably that is exactly the point.As a zombie film, the story is decent with several gory scenes. The gore effects are acceptable; make-up effects are passable; and the film shows several unique ways to dispatch zombies (don't miss the unforgettable Revolution Square scene).
