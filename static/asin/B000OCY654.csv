Mason ""relyonme""","[1, 1]","If you haven't seen FAUBOURG TREM&Eacute;, then this is definitely the documentary to buy if New Orleans interests you, or like me, you've just awoken to its special charm via the TV series TREM.It is a very well detailed account of the city's history, almost from Big Bang until today, and is very much more extensive than that other fine documentary, FAUBOURG TREM&Eacute;, which deals more with the neighbourhood of the same name from which the TV series takes its cue.All the better known aspects of N.O. are covered, so that you are not left in any doubt as to why music, particularly jazz, refined cuisine and the art of living in general took such firm hold here. It must have been a truly amazing place during the last century and a half, and although much was lost in the devastation caused by Katrina, and the general effect of modern day utilitarianism, some of its magic still appears to live on.As I haven't been there, this documentary will have to stand as a good substitute for the real thing.

1063232,AJQ9QIJMHXS1A,B000OCY654,"Roger Ashton ""Cowboy Buff""","[0, 0]","Yes this was a VERY well done documentary. However, I was expecting more about the early years. Like the Battle of New Orleans and the city's part during the Civil War. But, in all fairness, this was a two hour program and it's difficult to cover the history of a city so rich in culture and history in that amount of time.  So 4 stars for being a great program and one star off because of what I would have preferred in the story.",4,Not EXACTLY what I expected,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,431,"['Yes', 'was', 'VERY', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'However', 'was', 'expecting', 'more', 'early', 'years', 'Battle', 'New', 'Orleans', 'city', 'part', 'Civil', 'War', 'fairness', 'was', 'two', 'hour', 'program', 'difficult', 'cover', 'history', 'city', 'so', 'rich', 'culture', 'history', 'amount', 'time', 'So', '4', 'stars', 'being', 'great', 'program', 'one', 'star', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'story']",American Experience: New Orleans
