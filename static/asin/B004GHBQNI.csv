Christine has the absolute most annoying speech/voice that I can't stand to listen to her to do the DVD. She emphasizes words so strangely...such as &#34;in-haaaaaaale&#34;, &#34;ex-haaaaaale&#34;...OMG! If I could do the DVD without listening to her I would. I can't properly explain how very annoying this DVD is, but trust me, she's ridiculous.",1,I cannot stand her voice!,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,413,"['far', 'most', 'annoying', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'own', 'own', 'LOTS', 'Christine', 'absolute', 'most', 'annoying', 'speech/voice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'listen', 'do', 'DVD', 'words', 'so', 'strangely', 'such', '34', 'in-haaaaaaale', '34', '34', 'ex-haaaaaale', '34', 'OMG', 'could', 'do', 'DVD', 'listening', 'would', 'ca', ""n't"", 'properly', 'explain', 'how', 'very', 'annoying', 'DVD', 'ridiculous']",N/A
1406935,AUFV4KVKDEYO4,B004GHBQNI,Isabel,"[0, 0]","I'm an intermediate-advanced runner and I like doing yoga for flexibility and stretching. This DVD works that, plus it adds strength work for legs, hips and core. The poses are hold long enough to feel them, but not too long to be unbearable. I believe it's a great practice, it can look easy but it's intense! The only caveat is that is long (around 75 min). I also do like that Christine explains what you are working and why is good for runners, although I guess this can become irritating when you have heard in 1000 times. The studio is weird, kind of a castle?? or church?? Regarding the exercisers, they look normal people and I do like that. It makes you feel you are in a real class.  I do recommend the DVD regardless the cons,  not for daily practice, but once a week or so",5,Good practice - but long,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,784,"[""'m"", 'intermediate-advanced', 'runner', 'like', 'doing', 'yoga', 'flexibility', 'stretching', 'DVD', 'strength', 'work', 'legs', 'hips', 'core', 'poses', 'are', 'hold', 'long', 'enough', 'feel', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'unbearable', 'believe', 'great', 'practice', 'can', 'look', 'easy', 'intense', 'only', 'caveat', 'long', '75', 'min', 'also', 'do', 'Christine', 'what', 'are', 'working', 'why', 'good', 'runners', 'guess', 'can', 'become', 'irritating', 'when', 'have', 'heard', '1000', 'times', 'studio', 'weird', 'kind', 'castle', 'church', 'Regarding', 'exercisers', 'look', 'normal', 'people', 'do', 'feel', 'are', 'real', 'class', 'do', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'regardless', 'cons', 'not', 'daily', 'practice', 'once', 'week', 'so']",N/A
1406936,A7TKK3JUZNI3M,B004GHBQNI,Pam,"[1, 1]",I didn't know yoga could be so fun and challenging at the same time. She is a great instructor. I feel like she is actually teaching a class not just making a video for a company. My only complaint is the length of the workout.  It is an hour and 20 minutes.I can only make time to do this about once a week. It has help me with building strength and with flexibility.

Yoga has become an essential part of my routine. This program is the perfect compliment to my running. The instructor's cueing is precise and spot on. She hits all the hot spots..the hips, the hamstrings, everything in between. She forces you to hold the poses until you can't anymore. Even though I do this routine weekly, I'm usually sore after...which to me is a good thing. My beefs with this workout? It is boring. The participants are creepy and expressionless, except for the older woman, who tries to suppress a smile when the instructor is adjusting her.

I recommend this dvd for all runners. It is broken up into body sections or you can just do the whole dvd.
