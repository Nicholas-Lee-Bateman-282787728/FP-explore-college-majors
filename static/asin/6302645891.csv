325608,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,6302645891,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[5, 5]","The basic story: A woman is sold into marriage by her father to a wealthy merchant who already has 3 other wives.  She moves from her small village to his large house, is given a servant girl while learning the ways of the household. She meets the other wives and soon discovers that life is very different than what she was used to in her small village.Gong Li plays the young woman and is excellent at capturing her character's transistion from naive girl to knowledgeable woman and eventual break from reality upon her treatment for discovering a crime within the family.The film is beautifully shot, considering that there is basically one set used for the entire work: the large, multi-family house. It is carefully divided into seasons (each marked with calligraphy between chapters) and each season brings a new level of awareness to the characters as well as the viewer in this ""key-hole"" look into an era long-past in China's culture.The film's title is derived from the red lanterns that are raised in front and throughout the particular wife's ""house"" that the husband is staying with for the night.  She is given control over what is eaten for dinner (which they all eat together) and other special treatments. This becomes the crux and the protaganistic element of the film and is eventually the downfall of two wives and a servant girl.Each wife has their own distinct personality, ranging from the wisdom of the elderly first wife, the quiet, falsely sympathetic persona of the second, the playful, cat-like fiestiness of the opera-star third wife and the naive curiousity of the newest forth.  We learn about the household thru each of these characters and we see how one wife's actions can affect the entire group.The music is authentic throughout and it blends beautifully with the cinimatography and acting, making this a near-perfect film. My only critisism would be that in places the dialog (which is entirely in chinese with subtitles)is a bit muddy, but that would only matter to a Chinese-speaking person.  Other than that, I would highly recommend this engrossing film to anyone interested in Chinese culture, polygamy or art films.",4,A near-perfect film,1027296000,"07 22, 2002",2002,2158,"['basic', 'story', 'woman', 'sold', 'marriage', 'father', 'wealthy', 'merchant', 'who', 'already', '3', 'other', 'wives', 'small', 'village', 'large', 'house', 'given', 'servant', 'girl', 'learning', 'ways', 'household', 'other', 'wives', 'soon', 'discovers', 'life', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'was', 'used', 'small', 'village.Gong', 'Li', 'young', 'woman', 'excellent', 'capturing', 'character', 'transistion', 'naive', 'girl', 'knowledgeable', 'woman', 'eventual', 'break', 'reality', 'treatment', 'discovering', 'crime', 'family.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'considering', 'basically', 'one', 'set', 'used', 'entire', 'work', 'large', 'multi-family', 'house', 'carefully', 'divided', 'seasons', 'marked', 'calligraphy', 'chapters', 'season', 'new', 'level', 'awareness', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'viewer', 'key-hole', 'look', 'era', 'long-past', 'China', 'culture.The', 'film', 'title', 'derived', 'red', 'lanterns', 'are', 'raised', 'front', 'particular', 'wife', 'house', 'husband', 'staying', 'night', 'given', 'control', 'what', 'eaten', 'dinner', 'eat', 'together', 'other', 'special', 'treatments', 'crux', 'protaganistic', 'element', 'film', 'eventually', 'downfall', 'two', 'wives', 'servant', 'girl.Each', 'wife', 'own', 'distinct', 'personality', 'ranging', 'wisdom', 'elderly', 'first', 'wife', 'quiet', 'falsely', 'sympathetic', 'persona', 'second', 'playful', 'cat-like', 'fiestiness', 'opera-star', 'third', 'wife', 'naive', 'curiousity', 'newest', 'forth', 'learn', 'household', 'characters', 'see', 'how', 'one', 'wife', 'actions', 'can', 'affect', 'entire', 'group.The', 'music', 'authentic', 'beautifully', 'cinimatography', 'acting', 'making', 'near-perfect', 'film', 'only', 'critisism', 'would', 'be', 'places', 'dialog', 'entirely', 'chinese', 'subtitles', 'bit', 'muddy', 'would', 'only', 'matter', 'Chinese-speaking', 'person', 'Other', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'engrossing', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'polygamy', 'art', 'films']",N/A
325609,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6302645891,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 0]","""Raise the Red Lantern"" took me three nights to watch, not because it was a dull story, but because my ocular senses had to recover from the glory of each of the scenes. What may have been lacking in story depth, made up for in visuals as this story of a concubine in China desperately adjusts to a life she was not eager to step into. Handed limited options, Songlian (the fourth mistress) is handed the keys to an elaborate castle, one full of red lanterns, foot massages, lavish food, and a maid to wait on her hand and foot. Alas, not all is as perfect as it may seem, with three other mistresses under one roof (coupled with a scored maid) - the events get dramatic, mistresses pine for time with the ""Master"", and the hardships of living in this culture become clear as ""Raise the Red Lantern"" couples history, fiction, and amazing visuals to weave an important story to the screen. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first - a two hour film that deals with an archaic tradition that may focus more on the dramatics than an actual compelling story, but I was wrong. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" proves itself Oscar-worthy (alas, overshadowed by the ""Mediterraneo"" win) and coincidentally extremely passionate and watchable nearly 17 since it's release.Boasting big sets, amazing decor, and a taboo subject, ""Raise the Red Lantern"" pulls the viewer in with its stark realism, the elaborate nature of women in China in the 1920, and a score that is both haunting and refreshing. The smallest of scenes will pull you further into the film than imagined, and the subtle-ness of evil in contrast to women vying for the attention of one man is done in such a way that the emotions of sympathy, anger, frustration, and jealousy will boil up within. This is a movie that doesn't speak often, but says quite a bit through imagery and small actions. There is one scene in particular that was filmed gorgeously by director Yimou Zhang, which involves the discovery and subsequent downfall of Songlian's way of life. The long shot followed by her transformation was invigorating to say the least. Coupled with the stark beauty of winter, there is no question as to why this film has been lauded by critics and viewers alike. There is something unique about the way Zhang creates a sense of claustrophobia by keeping us in two-three rooms, yet each scene is fresh and new - that sense of stale surroundings is never present. This is a beautiful film, yes, but the acting is like more icing on the cake. Li Gong does a impressive job as Songlian, as we see her from the early excitement/nervousness about this change in her life, to seeing what tricks need to be pulled, to that question of sanity. This makes you revert back to the beginning of the film to wonder if something else had been missed. Your perception of Songlian will revert backwards as you attempt to see who she really is. Has she found a life, or merely unable to cope with the realities of the surroundings? Given the power of Songlian, it is tough to see anyone else stealing her glory, but Yan'er nearly does. Watch this subtle performance - as the maid scorned by another lover - she nearly steals every scene. Between these two, it is a delicate balance.With the beauty of the scenes and the acting, it is nearly a perfect film, but what pulls me back from applauding every minute of this film is the overall story behind ""Raise the Red Lantern"". There were just these moments where Zhang used the scenery to fill time, where the story itself was merely an hour and twenty minutes of physical story, but the eloquence of the background allowed for more. Don't get me wrong, the story is important - but perhaps not two-hours worthy.FILM: The film itself is breathtaking. Watch this with someone or alone on a snowy night. It challenges the mind and opens your heart to a part of history that needs to be discussed. I was reminded of our modern issues with polygamy, and how this Chinese tradition echos that ideal.VISUAL: MGM's release of this film (up converting on my Blu player) is immaculate. If this ever finds a true Blu release, it will easily be added to the collection. The reds are solid, the whites of the snow are delicate, and the long shots of the Master's villa nearly transforms you from the couch to the screen. It is easy to get lost in ""Raise the Red Lantern"" purely by the cinematography. The 2.35 widescreen is amazing, no matter which size screen you are working with.SOUND: Brilliant as well. The bold oriental sounds permeate through the visuals, giving two of our senses a crisp dose of intensity. The Chinese/Mandarin language with the English subtitles work to create the language, without leaving big gaps or being too overbearing. It nearly felt like a 5.1 surround, but it isn't specified. If it were 2.0, it was impressive.EXTRAS: Lacking. The only downturn to this film. There is nothing that builds the character of the film - i.e. how it was made, director or cast feelings, etc., etc. - I think the only thing we have it a preview. Rather sad considering the immaculate nature of this film.Overall, I was very pleased with this film. ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is one of those films that you shouldn't judge by the cover. It seems like another drab historical film, but in the end it is nothing but rewards to both the senses and the mind. Despite the lacking features, I am excited about adding this film to the collection, and look forward to the other films Yimou Zhang has released.Grade: **** out of *****",4,What color is your

How manipulating the other wives were to get the master's time.Songlian was chosen to be mistress number four.Songlain had a servant Yan'er who secretly desired to be mistress #4. She would have red lanterns in her room.The red lanterns signified where the master was going to spend time with the next mistress. Yan'er was also pregnant for the master. On Songlian's wedding night Meishan(wife 3)faked an illness on her wedding night,so the master could spend time with her so he left. When the master finally spent time with Songlian, early in the morning Meishan sang(opera singer) on the roof tops in order to disturb them. After a while Songlian tried to manipulate as well.She lied about being pregnant.Her plan was if the master spent time with her enough eventually she would be pregnant. Yan'er was her servant and since Yan'er did Songlian's laundry you know she told. Mistress 2 and 3 were great manipulators. This was well written.There is a room on the roof tops full of spirits. Eventually you find out what it is used for. Meishan was secretly having an affair with Dr. Gao. There are so many other things going on.Songlian liked the Master's son but knew she could never have him. The son played a flute,and so did she but the Master found out about the flute and destroyed it. Meishan's fate reminded me of the mistress's fate in SHANGHAI TRIAD. Gong Li can act, if this is your first Art House movie YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. This movie was banned in China in 1991. Gong Li was given Frances highest acting award in 1998.

This film is one of many collaborations between the director Zhang Yimou and the actress Gong Li.  Be warned however, this film moves at a snail's pace.

325615,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302645891,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I'm a huge fan of Yimou and Li's previous collaboration, `Ju Dou', which came out the year before `Raise the Red Lantern' was released.  As much as I adore `Ju Dou', I may have to concede to believing that `Raise the Red Lantern' is even better.  Both films establish similar themes of marital pain and suffering, but there are added elements to `Raise the Red Lantern' that make its impact partially more impactful.I can't shake it.The film centers on a young woman named Songlian who is sent off to become the fourth wife (or fourth mistress) of a Chinese nobleman.  She lives in her own home and her fortunes are dependent on her favor in the eyes of her husband.  If he chooses to dwell with her, then her lanterns are lit and special attention is shown her.  If she loses his favor and he decides to visit one of his other wives, she loses that position and that favor is shifted.  This is obviously not the life that this educated woman wanted for herself, and she soon shows a distilled attitude towards the customs looming over her head.  It doesn't help that the other wives, especially the third wife, Meishan, show intense jealousy, and Songlian's own maid Yan'er, who had dreams herself of becoming that coveted `fourth wife', shows resentment towards the youngest, newest member of the family.  Songlian soon begins to resist inclusion into the way of life around her and her elevated ideals are put to the test as she becomes more and more aware of the reality of her situation.The film is technically stunning.  The cinematography is sharp and intimate and the use of colors (reds and yellows predominantly) are beautiful to look at.  The sets are authentic and convey the atmosphere effortlessly, and the collective ensemble is spot on, with Gong Li continuing her slew of flawless 90's work and Saifei He committing herself to a memorable turn as the malicious yet misunderstood Meishan.The emotional core here circles around Songlian's conflicted ideals and the way that life is practically stripped from her thanks to the life she is sold into.  Her dignity is replaced by a dependency she cannot rise above and soon has to learn to adjust to and even exploit for her own favor, but as the final frames attest, there is only so much adaption one can undergo before they lose themselves completely.  Songlian's struggle to maintain her own identity is seen throughout the film, but none more so than in those final moments where the eventualities of her fate are exposed to us.From start to finish, `Raise the Red Lantern' is a stunning piece of cinema.",5,Raise you lantern high!,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,2571,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Yimou', 'Li', 'previous', 'collaboration', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'was', 'released', 'As', 'much', 'adore', 'Ju', 'Dou', 'may', 'have', 'concede', 'believing', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'even', 'better', 'films', 'establish', 'similar', 'themes', 'marital', 'pain', 'suffering', 'are', 'added', 'elements', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'make', 'impact', 'partially', 'more', 'impactful.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'it.The', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Songlian', 'who', 'sent', 'off', 'become', 'fourth', 'wife', 'fourth', 'mistress', 'Chinese', 'nobleman', 'own', 'home', 'fortunes', 'are', 'dependent', 'favor', 'eyes', 'husband', 'dwell', 'then', 'lanterns', 'are', 'lit', 'special', 'attention', 'shown', 'favor', 'visit', 'one', 'other', 'wives', 'position', 'favor', 'shifted', 'obviously', 'not', 'life', 'educated', 'woman', 'wanted', 'soon', 'distilled', 'attitude', 'customs', 'looming', 'head', ""n't"", 'help', 'other', 'wives', 'especially', 'third', 'wife', 'Meishan', 'show', 'intense', 'jealousy', 'Songlian', 'own', 'maid', ""Yan'er"", 'who', 'had', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'coveted', 'fourth', 'wife', 'resentment', 'youngest', 'newest', 'member', 'family', 'Songlian', 'soon', 'resist', 'inclusion', 'way', 'life', 'elevated', 'ideals', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'more', 'more', 'aware', 'reality', 'situation.The', 'film', 'technically', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'sharp', 'intimate', 'use', 'colors', 'reds', 'yellows', 'predominantly', 'are', 'beautiful', 'look', 'sets', 'are', 'authentic', 'convey', 'atmosphere', 'effortlessly', 'collective', 'ensemble', 'spot', 'Gong', 'Li', 'continuing', 'slew', 'flawless', '90', 'work', 'Saifei', 'committing', 'memorable', 'turn', 'malicious', 'yet', 'misunderstood', 'Meishan.The', 'emotional', 'core', 'here', 'Songlian', 'conflicted', 'ideals', 'way', 'life', 'practically', 'stripped', 'thanks', 'life', 'sold', 'dignity', 'replaced', 'dependency', 'can', 'not', 'rise', 'soon', 'learn', 'adjust', 'even', 'exploit', 'own', 'favor', 'final', 'frames', 'attest', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'adaption', 'one', 'can', 'undergo', 'lose', 'completely', 'Songlian', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'own', 'identity', 'seen', 'film', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'final', 'moments', 'where', 'eventualities', 'fate', 'are', 'exposed', 'us.From', 'start', 'finish', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'stunning', 'piece', 'cinema']",N/A

This is an incredible story of jealousy and envy and its repercussions. Set in 1920's China, 19 year old Songlian, (Gong Li), has just married Chen, a wealthy land-owner, and has become his fourth wife. Her father died while she was studying in college and because of financial hardship she was reluctantly forced to marry a much older man. She must now share her husband with his first three wives. Each wife lives in their own part of the estate and must wait each evening to see who the husband will spend the night with. When he chooses, this wife's section of the home will be lit with beautiful red lanterns and she will be pampered and be the one who decides what the other wives will eat for dinner. Songlian soon realizes that the other wives will stop at nothing to be Chen's choice. They will manipulate, cheat, and much worse to have the dubious honor of his company in their beds. With the husband, purposely never actually shown in the film, Yimou emphasizes the daily dramas that ensue when these women are left to their own jealous and catty devices. Instead of resenting their husband, the woman turn on each other for the power of control over the household. The story is based on a novel call ""Wives and Concubines"" by Su Tong. The story is broken down into the four seasons and the colors of each season along with the bright red of the lanterns adds to visual effectiveness of the film. The house has a haunting quality which gives the movie an almost ghost like quality from the start. The music that is played when the lanterns are lit also adds a dimension of intensity to the already suffocating fate of these four women.",5,Favorite Zhang Yimou Film,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",2012,1795,"['RAISE', 'THE', 'RED', 'LANTERN', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'favorite', 'film', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'director', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'incredible', 'story', 'jealousy', 'envy', 'repercussions', 'Set', '1920', 'China', '19', 'year', 'old', 'Songlian', 'Gong', 'Li', 'just', 'married', 'Chen', 'wealthy', 'land-owner', 'become', 'fourth', 'wife', 'father', 'died', 'was', 'studying', 'college', 'financial', 'hardship', 'was', 'reluctantly', 'forced', 'marry', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'must', 'now', 'share', 'husband', 'first', 'three', 'wives', 'wife', 'own', 'part', 'estate', 'must', 'wait', 'evening', 'see', 'who', 'husband', 'will', 'spend', 'night', 'When', 'wife', 'section', 'home', 'will', 'be', 'lit', 'beautiful', 'red', 'lanterns', 'will', 'be', 'pampered', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'other', 'wives', 'will', 'eat', 'dinner', 'Songlian', 'soon', 'other', 'wives', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'be', 'Chen', 'choice', 'will', 'manipulate', 'cheat', 'much', 'worse', 'have', 'dubious', 'honor', 'company', 'beds', 'husband', 'purposely', 'never', 'actually', 'shown', 'film', 'Yimou', 'daily', 'dramas', 'ensue', 'when', 'women', 'are', 'left', 'own', 'jealous', 'catty', 'devices', 'Instead', 'resenting', 'husband', 'woman', 'turn', 'other', 'power', 'control', 'household', 'story', 'based', 'novel', 'call', 'Wives', 'Concubines', 'Su', 'Tong', 'story', 'broken', 'down', 'four', 'seasons', 'colors', 'season', 'bright', 'red', 'lanterns', 'visual', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'house', 'haunting', 'quality', 'movie', 'almost', 'ghost', 'quality', 'start', 'music', 'played', 'when', 'lanterns', 'are', 'lit', 'also', 'dimension', 'intensity', 'already', 'suffocating', 'fate', 'four', 'women']",N/A

I know three-strip technicolor is sometimes shot without aid of a filter in order to get that glowy effect-- how much is hard to tell though, since this is obviously not even remotely the best source. The picture quality is not the only issue. The sound could use a little cleaning up as well, and the English subtitles were riddled with the kinds of mistakes common to cheap, bootlegged versions of Chinese cinema. One exmple was use of the word ""savant"" when ""servant"" was intended.

325626,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302645891,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Can inevitable and hopeless sadness ever be adequately described? Maybe, but not, I think, by amateur film enthusiasts or any but a few professional critics, and only then if they can tame their professional enthusiasms, can write well and know when to stop. That leaves out, among us amateurs, nearly all of us. As for the professionals, I've read only two or three commentaries by professional film critics that I think do justice to Raise the Red Lantern. Partly, this is due to the utterly foreign, cloistered culture we're observing. Partly, it's due to the intense but withheld emotions and motivations we gradually become aware of. Mainly, I think, it's due to the fact that deep sadness simply can't be adequately described, and the more we try, the less we convey.Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old student in 1920 China, must leave college when her father dies. Her stepmother arranges for her to marry a rich man as a fourth ""wife."" From then, Songlian's life, everything, depends on the attention she will receive from this man we scarcely see. The first mistress is middle-aged, serene and cool. The second is attractive and appears sympathetic and friendly. The third is young, beautiful and intensely jealous that Songlian may replace her as the most favored by Master Chen. Each has a maid. The servants reflect the attitudes of those they serve, but above all else, they reflect their roles in the Master's house. Again and again we return to an overhead shot that shows us where the universe begins and ends for Songlian...a stone courtyard with stone buildings on either side and the entrance at the end of the courtyard leading up low stairs to where Songlian now will live. When the Master intends to visit one of the wives for the night, it is the custom that the servants ceremoniously raise red lanterns outside the apartment of the favored wife.And this is all that their lives...and now, Songlian's life...consists of. There is no outside world, only their duty to serve the Master and to follow the customs of the Chen family, which goes back generations. If the red lantern is raised frequently outside Songlian's doorway, a servant tells her, she will soon be running the establishment. The other wives know this. Songlian is educated, sullen and resentful. She may realize that she must establish herself in the favor of the Master and find her place in the world of the wives, but we realize she may not have the guile needed. The intensity of establishing and maintaining ""place"" means resentments and betrayals. There can be no friendships. Songlian does not play this game well. Songlian's life eventually becomes as desolate as the cold snow that drifts down into the courtyard.Raise the Red Lantern is a gorgeous movie, as are most of Yimou Zhang's films. The seasons change from spring to summer to fall and to winter. We keep returning to Songlian and to the view of the courtyard, but we also see out over what seems the endless tile roofs of the Master's mansion. High on the roof is a small stone shed that is kept locked and which, it is whispered, had something to do with a former wife.At first the stone exteriors seem small and the interiors seem to go on and on. We see Songlian dressed lavishly to await the Master's visits. We see ornate furniture, wall scrolls, braziers against the chill and the red lanterns. We seldom see tears. Raise the Red Lantern is no tragedy, but it is a kind of slow-playing, hopeless melodrama. It is a reserved world where for these four women and their servants, everything depends on the Master. For Songlian, everything depends on her willingness to bend completely to this life from which she cannot leave, and to accept that there can be no relief from the need to scheme and plot to maintain a position against the other wives. To befriend can lead to betrayal. To sympathize can lead to rejection. To let slip a secret can lead to death. The customs of the ancient Chen family must be honored and followed, and can be cruel. To serve the Master whenever he wishes, with skill and charm, and to bear him a son, is what life has become, and there is no escape. The Master's life goes on. Our last view of Songlian is in the courtyard, in winter, wandering.Anyone who reads this should shake their head and wonder what all the fuss is about.

Nineteen year-old Songlian (Gong Li) resolves cynically to marry (or become the mistress of) a wealthy man to lift herself out of poverty. Her father has died and left the family penniless. She marries into the Chen family, becoming the fourth mistress (concubine) of the wealthy master. Like the three previous ""wives"" she is assigned her own lavish quarters where, on nights the master elects to sleep with her, red lanterns are hung out.The four mistresses or ""sisters"" share meals (except for the one chosen as the master's sleeping partner for the night; she receives special treatment) and socialize. It is soon apparent that there is a web of jealousy, suspicion and intrigue that underlies their relationships, as they vie for the master's favor.The first mistress has borne the master a son, who is now around Songlian's age. The third mistress is a former singer in the Chinese opera. She is unhappy with her status as mistress and later confides in Songlian that she is meeting clandestinely with Dr. Gao, the family's physician.Songlian is assigned a servant girl, Yang, who regards her mistress with contempt and jealousy. When Songlian discovers that Yang has secretly raised red lanterns in her own servant quarters, she flies into a rage, smashes the lanterns and drags Yang out for punishment. Yang becomes ill from shock and later dies.On her birthday Songlian gets drunk and inadvertently reveals the secret of the third mistress's affair with Dr. Gao. The first mistress goes to the hotel where a tryst is underway and catches them in flagrante delicto. The master is away, and when Meishan's transgression is exposed, his retainers drag her to the tower and she is hanged. When Songlian discovers what has happened, she goes mad and is seen wandering aimlessly dressed in a schoolgirl's uniform.A stunningly beautiful film with rich, lavish sets and costumes, breathtaking color, a compelling script based on the novel Wives and Concubines by Wu Tong, and consummate acting. Unfortunately the subtitles on the DVD copy I watched were laughably bad (example: servant is rendered as savant) and interfered with my understanding and enjoyment of the movie.

Of course the whole story of a man having four 'wives' who are really not any more than kept women or concubines is unsavory but even so this vision of harem life is especially disturbing as the women in this harem all turn out to be either petty or downright vicious.  Perhaps this infighting is inherent in this kind of situation but the infighting in this case becomes deadly and the film leaves you feeling like many films from the new Chinese cinema leave you feeling and thats that old China was bad for women. This is probably true, it is probably also true that old feudal China(and its really not so very ancient history, this picture takes place in the 1920's) was good only for a handful of powerful feudal lords.  But there is another message in this film and thats that willful women get punished. That is another unsavory aspect of this film. The Gong Li character was willful and proud before she ever entered the compound as wife number three and yet she came of her own free will. Much is made of the fact that she unlike the other wives was educated and has a brain and will of her own but nonetheless she becomes as petty as the others. The film is very powerful as it is but it just rings false to me that the Gong Li character would not find a way to continue cultivating her mind and become a stronger and stronger presence as she gained age and wisdom. In other words I think a willful woman would not allow herself to be undermined by others so easily. But she does so and she simply becomes another victim that loses her identity in bits and pieces until she is nothing but a walking shadow. It almost seems that Zhang Yimou is just reaffirming all our suspicions about backward old China. Of course to a westerner the most valued thing is individuality so it almost seems Yimou is catering to our own fears in the telling of this story about identity robbery. It is a captivating story and it is impossible not to admire the consummate craftsmanship with which it is put together but there is something inconsistent about the psychology of that main character and though it may be true that women had no official powers in old china it is also certainly true that women did exert their influence in unofficial ways but the Chinese to this day(Zhang Yimou included)do not tell stories about powerful women who are not punished. In Shanghai Triad Gong Li plays another kind of willful woman who also unintentionally brings about destruction and again she meets a similar fate. Its a strange kind of role she plays in both films. She is willful and cruel and selfish and yet somehow we don't blame her for it and she wins our sympathy in the end because she is ultimately rendered helpless.",5,Strong and willful...and helpless,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,2909,"['Well', 'impossible', 'not', 'give', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'example', 'consummate', 'craft', 'acting', 'directing', 'something', 'story', 'find', 'bit', 'unsavory', 'course', 'whole', 'story', 'man', 'having', 'four', ""'wives"", 'who', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'more', 'kept', 'women', 'concubines', 'unsavory', 'even', 'so', 'vision', 'harem', 'life', 'especially', 'disturbing', 'women', 'harem', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'either', 'petty', 'downright', 'vicious', 'Perhaps', 'infighting', 'inherent', 'kind', 'situation', 'infighting', 'case', 'deadly', 'film', 'feeling', 'many', 'films', 'new', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'leave', 'feeling', 'thats', 'old', 'China', 'was', 'bad', 'women', 'probably', 'true', 'probably', 'also', 'true', 'old', 'feudal', 'China', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'very', 'ancient', 'history', 'picture', 'place', '1920', 'was', 'good', 'only', 'handful', 'powerful', 'feudal', 'lords', 'message', 'film', 'thats', 'willful', 'women', 'get', 'punished', 'unsavory', 'aspect', 'film', 'Gong', 'Li', 'character', 'was', 'willful', 'proud', 'ever', 'entered', 'compound', 'wife', 'number', 'three', 'yet', 'came', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'Much', 'made', 'fact', 'other', 'wives', 'was', 'educated', 'brain', 'will', 'own', 'nonetheless', 'as', 'petty', 'others', 'film', 'very', 'powerful', 'just', 'false', 'Gong', 'Li', 'character', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'continue', 'cultivating', 'mind', 'become', 'stronger', 'stronger', 'presence', 'gained', 'age', 'wisdom', 'other', 'words', 'think', 'willful', 'woman', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'undermined', 'others', 'so', 'easily', 'so', 'simply', 'victim', 'identity', 'bits', 'pieces', 'nothing', 'walking', 'shadow', 'almost', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'just', 'reaffirming', 'suspicions', 'backward', 'old', 'China', 'course', 'westerner', 'most', 'valued', 'thing', 'individuality', 'almost', 'Yimou', 'catering', 'own', 'fears', 'telling', 'story', 'identity', 'robbery', 'captivating', 'story', 'impossible', 'not', 'admire', 'consummate', 'craftsmanship', 'put', 'together', 'something', 'inconsistent', 'psychology', 'main', 'character', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'women', 'had', 'official', 'powers', 'old', 'china', 'also', 'certainly', 'true', 'women', 'did', 'exert', 'influence', 'unofficial', 'ways', 'Chinese', 'day', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'included', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'stories', 'powerful', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'punished', 'Shanghai', 'Triad', 'Gong', 'Li', 'kind', 'willful', 'woman', 'who', 'also', 'unintentionally', 'destruction', 'again', 'similar', 'fate', 'strange', 'kind', 'role', 'films', 'willful', 'cruel', 'selfish', 'yet', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'sympathy', 'end', 'ultimately', 'rendered', 'helpless']",N/A

325639,AN0VOJ255J2V5,6302645891,James Fairchild,"[0, 0]","Zhang Yimou is one of a handful of the greatest directors in the world. His early films tackled subjects that enraged the Chinese establishment for their unstinting views of sex, Chinese politics, and other taboos, resulting at one time in his being barred from filmmaking for four years. Eventually, he turned to making martial arts thrillers of extraordinary technical virtuosity, presumably to palliate the Chinese government. One of his earliest films, Raise the Red Lantern, is in my opinion his best. The film involves the politics of half a dozen women married to a rich lord and the vicious intrigues they engage in. Yemou's direction is so powerful that this seemingly innocuous subject takes on unexpected dimensions. Gong Li, who was having a scandalous affair with the director, stars as the young newcomer battling the established wives for the lord's favors. The film even takes an unexpected gothic turn that heightens its intensity. Few films have so offended the Chinese government, who suspected it of being a thinly veiled allegory of its harsh indifference to its citizens.

325640,A2HCU3HYEYJELG,6302645891,"James Gebhardt ""Film Addict""","[9, 11]","Red Lantern is a carefully crafted story centered around a young woman named Songlian, played by the ever-brilliant Gong Li. Songlian's hopes and dreams of college and a better life are cruelly cut short by the sudden and unexpected death of her father. With no money for school and at the insistence of her mother, Songlian is forced to marry Chen, a wealthy landowner who already has three wives of his own. Each of the wives reside in separate wings of his centuries-old castle estate. The living quarters are extremely upscale and come complete with a personal servant and maid. But, like the storied bird in the gilded cage, their lives are sad, empty and lonely.Although the wives command respect and obedience from the hired help, they are nothing more than chattel to the wealthy Chen. Each day, the wives, along with their respective servant, stand at the entrance of their quarters waiting to see at which door the ""red lantern"" will be placed. This is how Chen chooses his wife for the evening. The ""lucky"" chosen wife is treated to a ritual foot massage by one of the older woman servants and her apartment is filled with large glowing red lanterns which burn brightly through the night. There are so many lanterns set up both inside and out that it, at first appearances, seems romantic but quickly ends up underscoring the true nature of the rite. It's a custom that quickly becomes apparant to be nothing more than lewd, sadistic sexual subjugation. It's not romantic, it's not passionate ... it's just a cruel game for Chen's entertainment. As the story progresses, we see struggle in almost every scene. There are secret alliances between the wives, the servants and the elite that frequent the master's estate. There is continual animosity between the wives as they plot and scheme to stay viable and remain in the master's good favor. There is an oversupply of backstabbing, betrayal and class struggle to be found between all of the major players. We also see the formation and disintegration of relationships between the wives. And, although the master tries to present himself as a peacemaker, it is gradually realized that he is actually the instigator of most of the hostility. Having the wives scratch and claw (metaphorically, that is) for his attention only serves to satisfy his own massive ego. Cycles of abuse are perhaps no more apparant when we see the wives, who are clearly victims in their own right, begin to victimize each other in an attempt to elevate their standing within the social order of the castle. The film is rich with many moments that are both sad and poignant. For example, although Songlian did not originally welcome the ritualistic foot massage, she grew to like it and missed it tremendously on those nights when she was not selected to be the ""wife of the evening"". She, along with the other unchosen wives, had to endure the very loud rattling sound of the foot massage from across the courtyard. It only further reminded them that they were unwanted and that they were not special. Did she miss the actual foot massage or what the massage represented? It became nothing more than a cruel Pavlovian experiment on the part of Chen. Chen seems to enjoy manipulating the women. Alternating between reward and punishment, he carefully trains them as if they were pets. The castle is a cauldron of sorts and it's only a matter of time before everything bubbles over. Without giving too much away, I'll only say that the storyline moves along resulting in tragic consequences that could hardly be seen as being entirely unexpected.The heart of this film is in its exploration of the indomitable female psyche. The film continually centers around very strong female characters struggling to survive under horrific conditions both psychologically and emotionally. The ability of the female psyche to maintain personal identity and spiritual freedom within the male-dominated Zeitgeist of feudal China is intrinsic to this story and although this sort of struggle is not really unique to Asian culture, it is handled in a very deliberate unapologetic fashion that makes this film not only special to watch but, necessary as well.I've been working backwards through director, Yimou Zhang's body of work and, in the process I unwittingly saved the best for last. Just kidding ... well, maybe a little. Yimou Zhang is certainly a director who likes to experiment. It seems like he's not content to make the same film over and over no matter how good the recipe is. Each of his films has a unique and distinct quality. This film is lensed in a very traditional straightforward fashion with equal amounts of closeups and far shots. The storyline is engrossing and carried along in a rich narrative style. The dialogue, although integral to the story seems almost secondary to the unspoken communication in the form of facial expressions, body language and other physical interactions between the characters. The film had many long visual sequences which seemed to tell the story better than any carefully worded text ever could. In my opinion, this is Gong Li's finest performance to date and I highly recommend seeing this film.",5,This is the one to watch,1159401600,"09 28, 2006",2006,5172,"['Red', 'Lantern', 'carefully',

I am certain that the current direction that the Chinese directors are taking in film making are just another example of compromises that the industry has been willing to take to include special effects for profit. Generally speaking, special effects has meant a reduction in story effectiveness. How serious can one accept a film where the characters are running on tree tops such as in Crouching Tigers Hidden Tigers? This makes for more viewers but but little of any deep feelings after the empty popcorn container has been disposed of in the lobby. Yes the fifteen year olds will be back to see such absurd movies again several times before school starts in the fall. Make no mistake even the director I am sure will miss making films such as ""Raise the Red Lantern"". To be sure he has built his reputation on quite a few good films mostly staring Gong Li and this is my favorite of all.Without giving much of the story away this film creates the most poignant study of the differences in personalities. If I had a fifteen year old I'd ask him or her to watch carefully to learn about how our perceptions of what we see in others may be greatly mistaken. The focus of the different wives living in relatively the same proximity makes such an impression. Without the silly fighting that the West mistaken believes is commonly characteristic of the far East you come away greatly impacted by the story of Raise the Red Lantern.

If she has to marry, she reasons, she might as well marry a rich man, and heedless of her mother's warnings that she will become little better than a concubine in a rich man's house (or, who knows, perhaps to spite her mother for forcing her to leave school), she becomes the fourth wife of a wealthy businessman.From the start, everything goes wrong.  Even her status in the household as fourth wife is ominous (the number four is considered unlucky in Chinese); she is an independent maverick in a place where she is expected to conform, and she finds herself trapped by the ""customs of the house"" which must be rigidly adhered to at all times.  With nothing to do to occupy their time, the wives spend their days scheming against each other; the first wife, old and no longer attractive, at least has the status of being the mother of the oldest son; the second wife, jealous of the younger women, plots at their destruction, and the third wife fights against the constraints of her existence by taking the disastrous step of an extramarital affair.Songlian is no match for the forces arrayed against her in this menage; when she tries to assert her place by falsifying a pregnancy and her ruse is discovered, she is relegated to a state of perpetual disgrace.  Shunned by the master of the house and held in contempt by everyone else, ignored even on her birthday, she retaliates by getting drunk and blurting out the secret of the third wife's liaison.  The ""customs of the house"" demand the ultimate punishment, and the third wife meets the fate which other adulterous wives in the family have met before her.  Songlian is left to go slowly and inexorably insane in this exquisite prison while the master of the house takes yet another wife, this one even younger than she is.Gong Li is incredible as Songlian; she is so stunningly beautiful and such a great actress that she dominates every scene she is in.  The film moves slowly but it's never boring, and although it's shot almost entirely within the confines of the house, the complexities of the building underscore the complexities of the relationship to the master and to each other that the wives are trapped in.  Zhang Yimou has directed other fine films, but Red Lantern is his masterpiece.Judy Lind",5,Life in a gilded cage,991180800,"05 30, 2001",2001,2549,"['Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'fascinating', 'look', 'life', 'early', '20th-century', 'China', 'story', 'Songlian', 'Gong', 'Li', 'best', 'role', 'date', '19', 'years', 'old', 'harassed', 'mother', 'leave', 'college', 'marry', 'father', 'death', 'family', 'impoverished', 'marry', 'reasons', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'marry', 'rich', 'man', 'heedless', 'mother', 'warnings', 'will', 'become', 'little', 'better', 'concubine', 'rich', 'man', 'house', 'who', 'perhaps', 'spite', 'mother', 'forcing', 'leave', 'school', 'fourth', 'wife', 'wealthy', 'start', 'everything', 'wrong', 'Even', 'status', 'household', 'fourth', 'wife', 'ominous', 'number', 'four', 'considered', 'unlucky', 'Chinese', 'independent', 'maverick', 'place', 'where', 'expected', 'conform', 'trapped', 'customs', 'house', 'must', 'be', 'rigidly', 'adhered', 'times', 'nothing', 'do', 'occupy', 'time', 'wives', 'spend', 'days', 'scheming', 'other', 'first', 'wife', 'old', 'longer', 'attractive', 'least', 'status', 'being', 'mother', 'oldest', 'son', 'second', 'wife', 'jealous', 'younger', 'women', 'plots', 'destruction', 'third', 'wife', 'fights', 'constraints', 'existence', 'taking', 'disastrous', 'step', 'extramarital', 'affair.Songlian', 'match', 'forces', 'arrayed', 'menage', 'when', 'assert', 'place', 'falsifying', 'pregnancy', 'ruse', 'discovered', 'relegated', 'state', 'perpetual', 'disgrace', 'Shunned', 'master', 'house', 'held', 'contempt', 'everyone', 'else', 'ignored', 'even', 'birthday', 'getting', 'drunk', 'blurting', 'out', 'secret', 'third', 'wife', 'liaison', 'customs', 'house', 'demand', 'ultimate', 'punishment', 'third', 'wife', 'fate', 'other', 'adulterous', 'wives', 'family', 'have', 'met', 'Songlian', 'left', 'go', 'slowly', 'inexorably', 'insane', 'exquisite', 'prison', 'master', 'house', 'yet', 'wife', 'one', 'even', 'younger', 'is.Gong', 'Li', 'incredible', 'Songlian', 'so', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'scene', 'film', 'slowly', 'never', 'boring', 'shot', 'almost', 'entirely', 'confines', 'house', 'complexities', 'building', 'complexities', 'relationship', 'master', 'other', 'wives', 'are', 'trapped', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'directed', 'other', 'fine', 'films', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'masterpiece.Judy', 'Lind']",N/A

This film is full of metaphors. Each wife symbolizes something that the Chinese people gave up in order to obtain the economic equality promised by communism. The first wife symbolizes China's history and traditions, the second wife with her cut-throat, backstabbing ways symbolizes personal integrity, the third wife who gave up her opera career symbolizes the art community that became a sterile machine for turning out Communist propaganda, the fourth wife who gave up her university studies represents the loss of intellectual freedom and progress under Mao who was well-known for his hatred of intellectuals, and the fifth wife who has no story represents the future of the Chinese people. What will become of her? This question is left unanswered. The husband represents the Chinese communist government, micromanaging it's citizens and even forcing them to live in compounds. The wives never know from one day to the next which wife will be favored and given power over the household, just as it was with the revolutionaries and counterrevolutionaries.

325658,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,6302645891,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[1, 1]","This is one of the best films I ever saw - and this is also one of the saddest things I ever saw...  Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.The film was adapted from a succesful Chinese novel, &#34;Wives and concubines&#34;, written in 1990 by Su Tong. The action in both the book and the film is set in 1920s China.Nineteen-year-old Songlian (Gong Li), whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, marries into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the Fourth Mistress (wife) of the household. Her husband, called The Master,  is much older - he is at least 50. We never see his face in the film. The Master reigns supremely over the whole household and especially decides on a daily basis which wife he will spend the night with; whomever he chooses gets red lanterns lit in her part of the house, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime and more generally gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Other than the four wives, the Master also sometimes choses servant girls to share his bed.The First Mistress, who is as old as The Master and who already years ago bore a son (The Young Master) to her husband is out but also above the melee - for many reasons, not the least of which is her age... The other three wives are however in constant competition against each other, continually vying for their husband's attention. At least one of the servant girls is also taking part in this contest, willing to be elevated to the rank of wife... This fight is merciless and frequently ugly. Nothing more will be said.When I saw this film in cinema in 1992 it impressed me and encouraged me to look for more of modern Chinese films - and it certainly didn't lose any of its power since. This film is of course first a darn good story and a good character study but it is also much more than that. I think that both the writer Su Tong and the director Zhang Yimou played the official Chinese censorship a nasty trick, because under cover of denounciation of polygamy and old times of warlords and Kuomintang, this book is in reality a merciless indictment of AUTHORITARISM in general! The Master has total power over the household, his wives and all servants - and even if he is not really a monster, this very fact of concentration of all authority and power in one hands generates already great injustice and many tragedies...Another lesson of this film is a warning about the price one needs to pay for comfort and avoidance of hard labour. The First Mistress, was probaly not asked her opinion about marrying The Master - their marriage was probably arranged since the childhood. But the other three had other options - especially the Third and Fourth Mistresses; they chose however to become de facto concubines (the title of wife is a pure courtesy) for material security and especially to avoid hard work. And The Master delivered what he promised - but as the film shows, the price they have to pay for this is VERY high.Finally, the film shows that fight to the death should not be waged just for the pride and honor - such a fight should be fought only when the prize is REALLY worth it.This film was the one which made Gong Li, already famous in China, a star known in the whole world. It also still remains the best film made by Zhang Yimou I saw - I liked it better than &#34;Shanghai Triad&#34; (which is not bad by the way) and martial arts/historical dramas like &#34;Hero&#34;, &#34;House of Flying daggers&#34; (not bad either) and &#34;Curse of Golden Flower&#34;.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[21, 23]","This outstanding tale set in 1920's is a breakthrough for modern cinema, and completely dispels the myth that foreign films are boring and pretentious.  The story is about a young girl called Songliang (Gong Li) who leaves university after money dries up following her father's death and she becomes a concubine.  She becomes just one mistress in a long lin that has passed through the family.  Entering as the fourth mistress, her other 'sisters' are not so willing to accept her and its these factions that form that are the real fascination.'Raise The Red Lantern' is a movie about power, as the mistresses try to gain their master's affection over one another, although the ultimate goal is to bear a male heir to ensure that their position is truly safe.  Interwoven into this are subplots involving the servants and questions about whether allegiance and duty should come before love and the quest for happiness.  It's a remarkably restrained movie, with the superb cast refusing to court our sympathy even in the most distressing of scenes.  What is spectacular about this though, is that the characters are all distinctly human in that even ther heroine is flawed.  This marks it out as a refreshing piece of cinema compared to the glitz of other popular movies.The strength of the women and the individual is another thing which is stressed.  Whilst the women struggle for power over one another, it is the master who has the real power.  Also interesting is the way in which the movie is filmed, as several times the women appear to be encaged in red lanterns, the symbol of who the master has chosen to stay with that night.This is a movie to treasure, a definite modern classic.",5,Only one word will suffice - mesmerising,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,1690,"['outstanding', 'tale', 'set', '1920', 'breakthrough', 'modern', 'cinema', 'completely', 'dispels', 'myth', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'boring', 'pretentious', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'called', 'Songliang', 'Gong', 'Li', 'who', 'university', 'money', 'up', 'following', 'father', 'death', 'concubine', 'just', 'one', 'mistress', 'long', 'lin', 'passed', 'family', 'Entering', 'fourth', 'mistress', 'other', ""'sisters"", 'are', 'not', 'so', 'willing', 'accept', 'factions', 'form', 'are', 'real', 'fascination', ""'Raise"", 'Red', 'Lantern', 'movie', 'power', 'mistresses', 'try', 'gain', 'master', 'affection', 'one', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'bear', 'male', 'heir', 'ensure', 'position', 'truly', 'safe', 'Interwoven', 'are', 'subplots', 'involving', 'servants', 'questions', 'allegiance', 'duty', 'should', 'come', 'love', 'quest', 'happiness', 'remarkably', 'restrained', 'movie', 'superb', 'cast', 'refusing', 'court', 'sympathy', 'even', 'most', 'distressing', 'scenes', 'What', 'spectacular', 'though', 'characters', 'are', 'distinctly', 'human', 'even', 'ther', 'heroine', 'flawed', 'out', 'refreshing', 'piece', 'cinema', 'compared', 'glitz', 'other', 'popular', 'movies.The', 'strength', 'women', 'individual', 'thing', 'stressed', 'women', 'struggle', 'power', 'one', 'master', 'who', 'real', 'power', 'Also', 'interesting', 'way', 'movie', 'filmed', 'several', 'times', 'women', 'appear', 'be', 'encaged', 'red', 'lanterns', 'symbol', 'who', 'master', 'chosen', 'stay', 'night.This', 'movie', 'treasure', 'definite', 'modern', 'classic']",N/A

For once, I have cause to rate the movie because of the quality of the DVD.  I shall seek a refund.The movie?  It was a good movie.  I had just seen ""Letter to Three Wives"" and I was conscious of the similarity in that both movies have a main character who was ever-present except on film.  With appologies to the purists, I will make no more comparisons between those two movies.  This was a very good Bluebeard story set in China of 1920.  The excellent cultural aspects of the setting of this ""modern"" fairy tale are quite impressive.  The movie moves along well and there is an aura of mystery throughout the movie that controls our interest.  The acting is very good as well.  Why didn't I rate this with 5 stars?

Songlian (Gong Li) becomes the Fourth Wife of a much older wealthy man named Chen Zuoqian.  Being the new youngest concubine in the harem, it seems that the four girls are constantly competing for the master husband's attention.  The eldest wife really doesn't seem to care (she's rather old and unappealing anyway), but the competition of the other three is the foundation of this story.  It's played out in a way that you as a viewer will start to determine who your favorite concubine is, but as the story plays out, everyone is not as innocent (or even as evil) as it first seemed.  Even the master seems like a pleasant person and very attentive to happiness of the concubines.This DVD was first released by Razor Digital with the most horrific video quality you could ever imagine.  Even worse than anything from Madacy (from Canada).  If you bought that eyesore, get rid of it and buy this newer release.  This one from MGM World Films is from a much better source.After I bought that horrid version from Razor Digital, I went on line and found an original master from Hong Kong released by ERA International.

325686,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,6302645891,trashcanman,"[3, 3]","Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou put out three of the best films of the past decade with his masterpieces Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Curse of the Golden Flower. These films (released over a mere four years) combine amazing performances and eye-melting visuals with intense emotions and thrilling action. It's only natural that I'd want more. After all, martial-arts isn't exactly the only thing Asian cinema has going for it and I was eager to see what else the master had for me. 1991's ""Raise the Red Lantern"" stars the luminescent and eternally beautiful Gong Li as an educated woman who resigns herself to marrying a wealthy man when her father's death leaves her family in dire financial straits. Now you're thinking ""resigns to marrying a wealthy man? Isn't that most girls' dream?"" Well this story takes place in 1920's China where wives of wealthy men were little more than concubines to be used and discarded more or less as the husband saw fit so for a young girl who has everything going for her to accept such a fate is essentially giving up on any hope of happiness or freedom. Raise the Red Lantern is a sad story and a powerful social commentary on the nature of the partriarchal order of things across the world.Songlian arrives at her new home and is quickly informed of the family traditions. Each wife (she is the fourth) has their own abode decorated with numerous red lanterns. Depending on which wife is favored at the moment, their home interior and exterior is lit with these lanterns and the wife is lavished with privileges that are practically waved in the other wive's faces. In addition, each wife must honor daily rituals involving her ""sisters"" such as morning visits and group meals. The fact that each woman is put in direct competition with the other three brings out more than a little drama. Among the tenets of feminine Asian culture is a vicious-yet-restrained brand of passive aggression. Seldom is it put on display as it is in this film. With Asian culture being focused so intently on the facade of order, propriety, and politeness to openly vent anger is to lose face and demean yourself in the eyes of others. So what you get in a situation such as this is women in a psychological life-or-death struggle where a smiling face and pleasant tone masks the most virulent hate. Songlian is the youngest of the women and most independent and therefore the black sheep of the group. Even her servant is instantly and outwardly disgusted by her. Songlian is often outwardly antagonistic and temperamental, often choosing to be deliberately snarky and avoiding playing the games the other wives play. Naturally, this makes her our protagonist. But the truth is that each of these women is doing the best they can to simply deal with their lot in life, and their coldness and viciousness is only a function of their master's insistence on honoring the cruel traditions that put them at each others' throats.Along with Songlian, we are quickly introduced to the First Mistress, Yuru, who is old and out of the race to become the favored wife. However, being the original wife she is afforded an amount of authority, but tends to choose to stay out of the affairs of the younger girls and their petty conflicts. Zhuoyun is the middle-aged Second Mistress, described as having the face of a Bhudda and the heart of a scorpion. Always smiling and pleasant, but often scheming in the most evil and selfish ways imaginable. Songlian's primary rival for the master's attentions is the Third Mistress, Meishan. As beautiful as Songlian and with exceptional talents as a songstress, Meishan is the spoiled brat of the bunch who regularly feigns sickness to get attention. As the Fourth Mistress and the newest wife, Songlian is expected to have the lanterns in her villa lit for a long time, but between her own bad attitude, Meishan's drama-queening, and Zhuoyun's schemes to give birth to a son by the master while the younger girls' antics turn the master (who seems to be getting a little action with a young servant on the side) away from them, everybody's got their hands full. What really made me love this film was not a young Gong Li (who would eventually become the most captivating actress in the world), and it's not the drama, and it's not even the indictment of this cruel and senseless male-first society. All that stuff was great, but as with many of Zhang Yimou's other works the visuals in this film are simply magnificent and outshine even the impressive performances. There's a reason the lanterns get top billing in this one. The way they are used to augment the already gorgeous sets is just amazing. The film is made up entirely of static shots that almost make one feel as if they are watching a play at times and this was done to preserve the perfect visual symmetry of these beautiful sets and the way that the color highlights them. There's only one word to describe the interior of Meishan's home: wow. The costumes are also fantastic to look at. In fact EVERYTHING in this movie is fantastic to look at.As a metaphor for oppressive government or patriarchal society as a whole and as a low-budget visual powerhouse, Raise the Red Lanterns is a masterpiece. However, there were some story elements that felt underdeveloped and I was not really pleased with the ending. However, I would highly recommend this film to any and all fans of Asian cinema. It's doubtful you will be disappointed.",4,"Passive aggressive, much?",1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,5448,"['Chinese', 'filmmaker', 'Zhang', 'Yimou', 'put', 'out', 'three', 'best', 'films', 'past',

Obviously, you'll want to get the 2007 release, not the 2006.Unbelievably bad DVD rendition of this film. The first thing to greet you are the constant film damage blips and scratches which continue throughout the film. They couldn't find an undamaged celluloid original to copy to DVD? One of the most acclaimed Chinese films of its time and its presented this way? Shame! And then there's the translation. What a pathetic translation. It's all over the place with misspellings, typos, disjointed sentences, missing words, and ridiculous transliterations. You have to grapple with this translation to comprehend the meanings. They couldn't find an actual English speaker with a minimum sixth grade education to double-check the English? Beyond comprehension.I give it one star to ward you off from this edition. The 2007 release must be the production this version should have been. It's truly beyond belief that they placed this version into production. Were they in a hurry? What a disgrace.As to the drama itself? Wow, what a bummer. It definitely wasn't ""groovy."" Another Chinese woman caught in a claustrophobic cultural/social cage story. Never seen one of those before, have you? But Gong Li was gorgeous and talented as always, and it was all well acted and filmed and costumed. The story continued straight ahead to depressing, but if that's your thing, go for it. I would have given it four stars. It's a good film, all in all. Zhang Yimou is the ""in"" Chinese director these days, so you're not supposed to say bad things, so I won't say anymore.But if you like this one, you must see ""Farewell, My Concubine"" if you haven't already. Different director (of different talents) but also starring (partly) Gong Li. Cultural traps again, but much more complex. For me, that one travels miles over this one, is a much richer experience, and won't leave you feeling at the bottom of the bottomless pit. Same historical period but it operates on so many more levels.

Gong Li is truely one of the great actresses of her time, Chinese or otherwise.  The film it's self deserves 5 stars on it's own merits, but the way the distributers have chosen to handle it's transfer is the biggest crime a film like this should have to endure.  I own a copy of this film on vhs and it is far superior to the dvd transfer.  The transfer looks like it was made from the worst possible copy they could find.  And don't get me started on the subtitles...  It's shocking that the distributors would let something like this out, but then again we are talking about money.  Please forget about purchasing this version of the film on dvd. Hopefully someday, this film will get the treatment it truely deserves, and be released in a restored version with subtitles that don't obstruct the enjoyment of this wonderful film.
