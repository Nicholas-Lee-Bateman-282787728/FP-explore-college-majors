Murphy,over the years,starred in many films produced by Paramount,but this one is a property of Hollywood Pictures,a subsidiary of Buena Vista and a sister of Touchstone. Murphy plays a congressman who goes out of his way to frame a colleague of his who's a devious criminal. Murphy is either mildly vulgar or not vulgar at all unlike when he's on stage. Around the time of this 1992 theatrical release,Murphy began to clean his image,in the aspect of film roles.

There are segments in it that are quite good. On the other hand, Eddie Murphy sucks and kills every scene he is in. Moreover, the script is very poorly developed. I wish the makers took their time and filmed it with a much better script because it's as good as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. In my line of work, I have one BS meter test; simply, I listen to one person's talk for at least two minutes before I determine if he is a fraud or not. Well, Eddie Murphy's character doesn't survive it for longer than thirty seconds. So it's hard for me to believe that he was fooling everybody in Washington, D.C. In the last twenty minutes, for a desperate attempt at deus ex machina, Eddie Murphy's character hatches one big plan to make good with everybody by getting the bad guys. I am like, ""Really? Long ways to go."" So, power lines cause cancer? Can't anyone come up with a better and more believable hook? It was labeled as ""funny movie?"" Please, make me laugh for once.

However, it is at heart an Eddie Murphy movie, and you know that Eddie Murphy is always over the top.The plot is relatively simple.  Eddie Murphy is a small-time con artist.  Having recently overheard a conversation between several lobbyists and a congressman, Eddie realizes that (in his opinion) being a congressman is the biggest con of all.  One day he happens to be in the right place at the right time when a congressman with virtually the same name as his dies.  Eddie runs for election to replace the dead congressman with his only platform being that ""you know the name"".  You must know that Eddie wins in a landslide.Eddie's initial goal is to figure out how he can get as much money as possible.  However, as is the case with all con artists, their undoing is when they begin to care.  In Eddie's case, his undoing is a beautiful woman and a little girl diagnosed with cancer.  The combination of the two makes Eddie care about someone other than himself, and you see Eddie change from that point.Lane Smith plays Dick Dodge, a senior congressman on the powerful Power and Industry committee.  Dick Dodge is a wheeler and dealer who knows all the ins and outs of Washington, and the best way to wield power and profit from his position.  Initially Eddie looks to Dick as a mentor.  While Eddie initially identified with Dick Dodge, as Eddie discovers that there is a harmful side-effect on ordinary people by the actions of people such as Dodge, Eddie eventually uses his abilities to remove Dodge from power.This movie is a bit more cerebral than Eddie's typical movies.  ""Trading Places"" was generally slapstick and situational comedy.  ""Beverly Hills Cop"" was one-liners and irony.  The humor in this movie is often more subtle, and in some cases may be lost on some viewers.  There are places in the movie where the humor is slapstick and one-liners, however, much of the humor is satirical and often harder to discern.While this movie is certainly not Eddie's best, neither is it among his worst.  There are places in the movie that are inspired.  However, for every inspired part of the movie there are tired jokes and typical Washington political satire.

He ran with intentions of getting rich and left with intentions of helping the little people that get ran over by those corporate fat cats in the oval office.

If you've ever wondered why nothing changes in the world, it's because the bozos in politics won't allow concrete change to happen. They wallow their time in games, photo-shoots, and siphoning taxpayers money to their tricks and buddies.In this movie, comedian Eddie Murphy plays a small-time con-man who saw that the fastest way to make money is to be in the place where money is printed and played - Washington. All you need are big smiles, a great-looking personality, heaps of charisma, and a bag of tricks up your sleeves and a few sleeping partners in crime. When he finally gets to Washington, his first change of heart comes when he meets with a cancer-stricken girl and her mom, and a potential love of his life. A rolling adventure begins as the con-man, Jr. exposes the cons in his superiors in major scandals.The con games sound like reality to me! If only politicians have a heart and soul these day! They don't want to know that real people are suffering when all they do is to bask in the wealth of taxpayers' money. Now, you know the reality of  politicians is to find ways to steal our hard-earned money with all their games!",5,Politician = Elite Con = Legal Scammer,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,1261,"['Want', 'be', 'legal', 'scammer', 'con-man', 'go', 'join', 'politics', 'comedy', 'light', 'going-ons', 'political', 'circles', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wondered', 'why', 'nothing', 'changes', 'world', 'bozos', 'politics', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'concrete', 'change', 'happen', 'wallow', 'time', 'games', 'photo-shoots', 'siphoning', 'taxpayers', 'money', 'tricks', 'buddies.In', 'movie', 'comedian', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'small-time', 'con-man', 'who', 'saw', 'fastest', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'be', 'place', 'where', 'money', 'printed', 'played', 'Washington', 'All', 'need', 'are', 'big', 'smiles', 'great-looking', 'personality', 'heaps', 'charisma', 'bag', 'tricks', 'sleeves', 'few', 'sleeping', 'partners', 'crime', 'When', 'finally', 'Washington', 'first', 'change', 'heart', 'when', 'cancer-stricken', 'girl', 'mom', 'potential', 'love', 'life', 'rolling', 'adventure', 'con-man', 'Jr.', 'cons', 'superiors', 'major', 'scandals.The', 'con', 'games', 'sound', 'reality', 'only', 'politicians', 'have', 'heart', 'soul', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'suffering', 'when', 'do', 'bask', 'wealth', 'taxpayers', 'money', 'Now', 'know', 'reality', 'politicians', 'find', 'ways', 'steal', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'games']",N/A
