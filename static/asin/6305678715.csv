Well, that would be if it were a made-for-TV film, which I'm assuming that it wasn't.It's not the cast that's the problem.  Sean Connery is good, as usual.  And while I've been very hit-and-miss on Mark Harmon -- I hated his interpretation of Ted Bundy, and NCIS is absolutely unwatchable -- I think that he's pretty decent here.  Even Meg Ryan, who's been in quite a few completely overrated films -- ""You've Got Mail,"" anyone? -- doesn't completely stink here.But rather, I believe that it was the screenplay.  Mr. Connery and Mr. Harmon have somewhat of a love-hate relationship here, for at least a couple of reasons.  One guy hooking up with another guy's daughter might be one of them.  And this little ""love triangle"" is what's blas&eacute; for me; it seemed to be a cheap little plot device to try and bring some interest to the characters and their plights.I decided to watch this film because it was on ""free"" TV, it was in HD, I'd never seen it before, and it was set in San Francisco.  I lived in the city for a year and a half, and I still live very close and visit fairly often.  I wanted to see what SF looked like in the 80s, and I guess not much has changed really; steep hills, narrow houses, lots of fog.  And lots of mediocre films still get made there I suppose.Well, if you're really bored and you can watch this film for free, I'd perhaps give it a peek.

473083,A2TXR85WQLE32N,6305678715,D. S. Thurlow,"[12, 14]","1988's ""The Presidio"" paired veteran actor Sean Connery with a young Mark Harmon and a younger Meg Ryan in a rather mundane San Francisco murder mystery.  The movie was set at the U.S. Army's beautiful Presidio of San Francisco military base and in San Francisco itself.Connery is Lieutenant Colonel Caldwell, the cantankerous, by-the-book Provost Marshal of the Presidio; Harmon is Jay Austin, forced out of the military by Caldwell and now a hot-headed San Francisco police detective.  When a military policeman is murdered during a break-in at the Presidio Officer's Club, the two must cooperate on the investigation.  Their difficult relationship is made more challenging by Austin's attraction to Caldwell's beautiful but rebellious daughter, played with aggressive gusto by Meg Ryan.The murder investigation leads to a conspiracy with ties back to the Vietnam War, culminating in a violent shoot-out in a bottled water warehouse.  The plot will seem clumsy to audiences now savy on crime forensics; the even clumsier dialogue sometimes threatens to bury the movie altogether.The movie has its redeeming features.  Connerly and Harmon manage to craft a little ""old bull, young bull"" buddy chemistry on screen.  A scene in which Caldwell impresses Austin by using a little hopkido to clean up a bar with a loud-mouthed drunk may be the highpoint of the movie.  The movie makes good use of its location shooting around the Presidio.This movie is recommended as mild entertainment for fans of Sean Connery and Mark Harmon.",3,"Two good actors, no plot...",1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,1524,"['1988', 'Presidio', 'paired', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'young', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'younger', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'rather', 'mundane', 'San', 'Francisco', 'murder', 'mystery', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'beautiful', 'Presidio', 'San', 'Francisco', 'military', 'base', 'San', 'Francisco', 'itself.Connery', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'Caldwell', 'cantankerous', 'by-the-book', 'Provost', 'Marshal', 'Presidio', 'Harmon', 'Jay', 'Austin', 'forced', 'military', 'Caldwell', 'now', 'hot-headed', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'detective', 'When', 'military', 'policeman', 'murdered', 'break-in', 'Presidio', 'Officer', 'Club', 'two', 'must', 'cooperate', 'investigation', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'made', 'more', 'challenging', 'Austin', 'attraction', 'Caldwell', 'beautiful', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'played', 'aggressive', 'gusto', 'Meg', 'Ryan.The', 'murder', 'investigation', 'conspiracy', 'ties', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'culminating', 'violent', 'shoot-out', 'bottled', 'water', 'warehouse', 'plot', 'will', 'seem', 'clumsy', 'audiences', 'now', 'savy', 'crime', 'forensics', 'even', 'clumsier', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'bury', 'movie', 'altogether.The', 'movie', 'redeeming', 'features', 'Connerly', 'Harmon', 'manage', 'craft', 'little', 'old', 'bull', 'young', 'bull', 'buddy', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'scene', 'Caldwell', 'Austin', 'using', 'little', 'hopkido', 'clean', 'up', 'bar', 'loud-mouthed', 'drunk', 'may', 'be', 'highpoint', 'movie', 'movie', 'good', 'use', 'location', 'shooting', 'Presidio.This', 'movie', 'recommended', 'mild', 'entertainment', 'fans', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Mark', 'Harmon']",The Presidio

The friction and emotional tension between these characters is the heart movie.  The murder mystery takes a back seat.  Another side issue in addition to the murder was the love interest of Connery's daughter, Meg Ryan for Harmon and her friction with her dad.Another friction in the story is that of a military base located near the USA's Saddom and Gamorrah known as San Francisco.The movie bogs down and drifts as the characters treat each other inordinately poorly, and in a manner not justified by what we know.
