685581,A1VKEVP3GO1G9R,B00005UQ9W,Aaron Amos,"[2, 3]","The newest movie to get a bad remake is &quot;13 Ghosts&quot;. It's based  loosely on the original William Castle movie made in the 1960's-1950. Other than that that just about all it shares in common with the original. If you like the other William Castle remake of &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;(another remake that did not to be done, you might like this. This movie is a mess, with too many plot holes. too many special effects etc.. Also why could'nt people watching the movie wear special glasses like they did with the original movie? Having the actors wear them was pretty lame.If you like any of the movie stars fine but I'd rate it as one of 2001's worst movies! I wonder why Matthew Lillard was in this movie? Maybe he has a contract with Warner Brothers?As for me, I wish I spent the movie I used watching this trash and bought the original on DVD.

I am talking about the dazzling visual effects, the detailed make-up on the ghosts, and the very creative killings (always appreciated). All of these things, however, cannot make a movie, which Thirteen Ghosts proves. The plot is simply not there -- wait, let me rephrase -- there is a plot. But it is so corny and cliched, that anyone who has seen a handful of movies can tell exactly where it is heading. Also, the characters are annoying, most noteably the nanny, who spouts off typical and corny ""crazy white people"" lines like she was the female Martin Lawrence. The kid is annoying. I did appreciate Tony Shalhoub, and Shannon Elizabeth is always nice to look at. Also, like I mentioned before, this film looks gorgeous. The first viewing, my eyes were glued to the screen. However, the movie doesn't offer much else. I own it on tape and have only watched it one and a half times. It's a little too boring for what it's trying to do.

685585,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005UQ9W,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 10]","This was a horrible horror film, so to ensure that I don't sound cliched with my review, I am going to write out thir13en ways that this film could have been improved.1. Hacking somebody to bits sells a horror film, not huge boobs. While some may enjoy scenes like this, I find that it distracts from the bigger picture. One of the ghosts had ""huge boobs"" power, which was not very scary in my eyes. What was she going to do? Poke somebody's eye out with the enormous nipples? I don't think she would have sent anyone away in fear. I think most would just cozy in for a warm winter's nap ... because it wouldn't be the holidays if it wasn't much hooter ... hotter at the malls.2. I don't want to sound racist, but the family seemed to be a bit mismatched. Were all the kids adopted? None of them resembled Tony Shalhoub at all. They didn't even look like their burnt mother. I was confused. They also were very disrespectful of a man that just lost his wife to fire. Everybody knows that a fire death takes anywhere from four to eight months recovery. You shouldn't rush him into normality if you can.3. I did enjoy the cameo from the guy in the movie Se7en. It is always good when directors that randomly throw in numbers in their title to create a symbolic reference can use the same actors. Look for the guy from Se7en that ate himself to death, then look for the guy that ate himself to death in Thir13en Ghosts. I think you will be able to spot him well.4. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ... NOW.5. I enjoyed this film better when the characters had names like Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston and when they battled guys like Slimer and the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man. I mean, there was nothing in this film warning people not to cross their beams. That is a warning that should have been mention.6. For some odd reason I never saw 13 ghosts. I was counting too. I think, at the most, I saw five. I think some people in the marketing department got the ax after this film.7. Did anyone catch the phrase ""Semper Ubi Sub Ubi"" written on one of the walls. Not cool.8. Apparently, in this film, the only way to get rid of ghosts is by throwing a flare at them. Now really people, you could tell that the production team had run out of a budget after developing the glasses and had to resort to flare throwing as a battle weapon. These ghosts needed to realize that they were already DEAD, flares wouldn't hurt them. See, never forget the rules. Train your ghost first, then let him terrorize.9. Have your ghosts work for you. This was a very common problem in this film. The ghosts were not working for anyone. If you have 13 spirits that need employment, do not allow them to just sit around and sulk. Get working or get out. Kriticos must have been a softy in the workforce because these spirits did not listen to anything or follow any directions. Ghosts need discipline just like you and I.10. Matthew Lillard needs to stop working ... NOW.11. Can anybody explain to me what F. Murray Abraham was doing in this film? This man is an Oscar winner and he is forced to do work like this? I have no hope for Hollywood.12. Glasshouses need consistency. This film did not, and the first reason why is because the bathroom was not made of glass (unlike the rest of the house). Consistency. Learn this and you may have mastered the ways of the horror genre.13. (Nothing.... There were not 13 ghosts so why should I have to worry about 13 points? Riddle me that bucko!)Overall, this was a horrible film that somehow needed to be watched just once than forgotten about for the remaining days of my existence. Skip it, and you will die a very happy person. Watch it ... and you may become one of the (DUM DAH DAH....) Thir13en Ghosts.Grade: * out of *****",1,Bathrooms. Bathrooms!

685586,A3PHUMOFCIFUGF,B00005UQ9W,Alexander Liu,"[9, 10]","I went in the theatre with high hopes. I watched it. And I left feeling satisfied. This is a great movie, but that isn't to say that it is without its flaws.First off, this movie is way too similar to the previous movie by Dark Castle Entertainment, House on Haunted Hill. Here are a few examples.- Both have a slightly (initially) crazed, pessimistic, comic-relief characterwho knows the ropes around the house. This was Watson Pritchett in House onHaunted Hill, and Dennis Rafkin in 13 Ghosts.- Both have basements. In both versions, when the main characters first gointo the basement, they get a shock. Both have henchmen of the crazymillionaire who die in the basement (the mantainence guy in House on HauntedHill, and the lawyer guy in 13 Ghosts.- Both start off with music playing as we follow the main characters initialarrival at the house. (While House on Haunted Hill had a very cool, verymemorable scene with Marilyn Manson's rendition of 'Sweet Dreams are Made ofThese', 13 Ghosts unfortunately seems to attempt to capture the spirit ofthe previous outing in an almost parody of itself as we hear weird pop musicplaying, seemingly slightly out of place.In my personal opinion, Dark Castle's first film far surpassed the much inferior 13 Ghosts, though I no doubt found myself grinning madly through most of the film. The script seems rather weak and jokes quite lame, but this is no reason to miss the film. Don't go in expecting a Citizen Kane, but do expect a pretty good B-Movie rendition. P.s.

Sure, the set is stylish, but the manic way in which the film is presented is preposterous and obnoxious and downright annoying.  It's funny to me when people try and describe the plot, like it matters.  ""The film is about a struggling family who inherits a strange...yada-yada-yada.""  Seriously, this film doesn't deserve a synopsis.  I once wrote a review detailing 13 reasons to turn this movie off and I stand by every one of them.  This movie is annoying, it isn't scary, it is STUPID (yes, with all capital letters), the acting is atrocious and Shannon Elizabeth keeps her top on.  The house, I digress, is kind of cool (conceptually) but the gimmick wares out its welcome when it has nothing of substantial weight to back it up.

685593,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00005UQ9W,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[1, 2]","""Thir13en Ghosts"" is the second movie made by Dark Castle Entertainment, who brought us the equally chilling ""House On Haunted Hill"" remake in 1999. This film is a remake of William Castle's 3-D ghost house romp. This movie opens with some real-life ""ghost hunters"" hunting ghosts in a wrecking yard, the ghost is very violent, lots of people die. We are then introduced into the Kriticos family, which consists of a father, his daughter and son, and their live-in nanny. Living in a cramped little apartment, they are happy when they inherit their uncle Arthur's glass-walled mansion after his death. Little do they know, Arthur was a ghost hunter, and the basement of the house contains sealed rooms that hold twelve assorted ghosts. When the family goes to see the house one evening, they meet a kooky electrician (who is actually a previous ghost hunter who worked for Arthur). And after entering the house, it seals shut, and begins to shift, hallways disappearing and changing, etc. Turns out this glass-walled ""house"" is a ghost machine, and as the night progresses, the ghosts below are released from their containment.This is one of those movies that is really flashy, jumpy, and loud. It uses these qualities as scare tactics, and they actually work in this film. The ghosts in the movie were scary as hell, each of them have a bit of a backstory and a name. The ghosts that freaked me out in particular were The Pilgrimess, The Angry Princess, and The Jackal. All of them were scary in their own ways, but out of them all, those ones stood out to me. The setting for the film was great, and the whole house set was magnificent - all the walls made of glass, glass floors, etc. It looked awesome. The special effects were great, especially the makeup used on the unique ghosts, and it had plenty of startling action sequences. The acting was decent, good enough in the context of the movie. And the realtor's death was probably the best in the whole film, very original and gruesome. I liked how they incorporated the ""glasses"" theme into this movie. In the original 1960 version, you had to wear actual 3-D glasses to see the ghosts. In this movie, the characters must wear special glasses to see them.Overall, ""Thir13en Ghosts"" is a good horror movie. It's not necessarily scary, but it's startling on many occasions and the ghosts in the movie were really creepy and unique, I've never seen ones quite like this in a horror film. Don't expect a suspenseful mystery thriller, but if you like supernatural horror movies that are jumpy and flashy, you'll enjoy this. 7/10.",4,not scary?  so?,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,2582,"['Thir13en', 'Ghosts', 'second', 'movie', 'made', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'Entertainment', 'who', 'brought', 'equally', 'chilling', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'remake', '1999', 'film', 'remake', 'William', 'Castle', '3-D', 'ghost', 'house', 'romp', 'movie', 'real-life', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'hunting', 'ghosts', 'wrecking', 'yard', 'ghost', 'very', 'violent', 'lots', 'people', 'die', 'are', 'then', 'introduced', 'Kriticos', 'family', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'Living', 'cramped', 'little', 'apartment', 'are', 'happy', 'when', 'inherit', 'uncle', 'Arthur', 'glass-walled', 'mansion', 'death', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'Arthur', 'was', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'basement', 'house', 'sealed', 'rooms', 'hold', 'twelve', 'assorted', 'ghosts', 'When', 'family', 'see', 'house', 'one', 'evening', 'meet', 'kooky', 'electrician', 'who', 'actually', 'previous', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'who', 'worked', 'Arthur', 'entering', 'house', 'shut', 'shift', 'hallways', 'disappearing', 'changing', 'etc', 'out', 'glass-walled', 'house', 'ghost', 'machine', 'night', 'ghosts', 'are', 'released', 'containment.This', 'one', 'movies', 'really', 'flashy', 'jumpy', 'loud', 'qualities', 'scare', 'tactics', 'actually', 'work', 'film', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'were', 'scary', 'hell', 'have', 'bit', 'backstory', 'name', 'ghosts', 'freaked', 'out', 'particular', 'were', 'Pilgrimess', 'Angry', 'Princess', 'Jackal', 'were', 'scary', 'own', 'ways', 'ones', 'stood', 'out', 'setting', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'whole', 'house', 'set', 'was', 'magnificent', 'walls', 'made', 'glass', 'glass', 'floors', 'etc', 'looked', 'awesome', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'makeup', 'used', 'unique', 'ghosts', 'had', 'plenty', 'startling', 'action', 'sequences', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'good', 'enough', 'context', 'movie', 'realtor', 'death', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'original', 'gruesome', 'liked', 'how', 'incorporated', 'glasses', 'theme', 'movie', 'original', '1960', 'version', 'had', 'wear', 'actual', '3-D', 'glasses', 'see', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'characters', 'must', 'wear', 'special', 'glasses', 'see', 'them.Overall', 'Thir13en', 'Ghosts', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'scary', 'startling', 'many', 'occasions', 'ghosts', 'movie', 'were', 'really', 'creepy', 'unique', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'ones', 'quite', 'horror', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'suspenseful', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'like', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'jumpy', 'flashy', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', '7/10']",Thirteen Ghosts

I was expecting to not like it. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Is it a great movie?. God no. Is it fun?. Oh yeah. I found myself enjoying the movie. Former ""Wings"" co-star Tony Shalhoub and his family, including red hot Shannon Elizabeth as his daughter, his little son, and a cliched black nanny, inherit his recently deceased Uncle Cyrus' weird house made entirely of glass. It appears that the uncle collected ghosts and has them locked up in containment cells in the basement. Well, naturally, something happens and the ghosts are set free. Our new owners are locked in the house and must battle the ghosties. The catch is that you can only see them when wearing these special glasses. I won't delve too much into what happens so as not too ruin it for anybody who might see it. F. Murray Abraham co-stars as Uncle Cyrus. Mr. Abraham, have things been this bad since your oscar winning performance in ""Amadeus""?. This movie isn't going to set the cinema on fire, or overly impress most people, but it is solid entertainment. I was expecting to hate it after hearing other people, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. Matthew Lillard and his drool also appear. Is it just me or does he drool a lot?. He did in ""Scream"" and he does in here too. Shannon Elizabeth looks great, but her role is just a typical 'damsel in distress'thing. Rah Digga as the nanny was a horrible cliche. A black character as nothing better than a nanny. It gets worse folks. She is also there to chime in with the typical comical one liners at the most inopportune time. So stereotypical. This is 2002 you filmmakers. Can't we do something better with a character than that?!. I guess not. I do have to say that some of the ghosts were downright creepy. Even if you dislike the movie, you have to admit that the make-up was great, which it was, and that the ghosts were really good. They were. This is the only recent 're-make' of an old horror movie that I have liked. Sure I still dream of the old days when movies were scary without CGI and effects and were just meant to be scary, but this movie managed to have a little of both. The make-up was great and the ghosts themselves were eerie. A couple death scenes were quite cool too. The first 10 minutes or so were pretty interesting to watch.

My expectations could not have been more wrong.The movie chronicles the story of a small family who falls apart after the mother dies in a fire. Along with their mother, all of the family's possessions go up into flames, leaving them to be a struggling family with strong ties to one another.Another storyline opens up, when a psychic ghost hunter (Matthew Lillard, in one of his most poorly acted roles ever) is hired to capture ghosts for an evil man.  Of course, you can tell he is evil because his name is Cyrus. Cyrus collects ghosts for a purpose that is unforeseen at the beginning of the movie.Within the first sequence, Cyrus dies in a ghost hunting accident. And wouldn't you know it? He leaves his whole fortune, complete with his creepy ghost collection house to his last remaining family members. You guessed it, the family I referred to earlier are the lucky recipients of the house.From here on, excitement and terror ensue. Oh wait, no they don't. Absolutely no excitement or terror ever even peeks it's head onto the screen. What does peek it's head onto the screen are bad one-liners from the token black girl (of course there's the standard ""DAMN!

Well, the movie-makers didn't get this right.Forget the William Castle comparisons - isn't everything a copy of a previous idea these days anyway? Thirteen Ghosts (I refuse to use the stupid spelling, thanks) fails on its own lack of merit. Tony Shaloub (an underrated actor who does the best he can in this mess) leads an uninteresting collection of sidekick characters through a formulaic scare plot. There's the sexy but slightly ditzy daughter, the sassy but hip nanny (Rah Digga, whose presence here defines tokenism), the evil lawyer, the sugar-dosed kid brother who ALWAYS gets away from everyone, and worst, a scenery-chewing idiot (the always-irritating Matthew Lillard) who is supposed to link the story together. I was rooting for the ghosts to kill just about every one; I haven't seen characters this annoying since Shelley Duvall in The Shining.The ghosts themselves are interesting, with decent makeup and masks, but were so over the top as to never generate real fear. When one character referenced the most evil ghost of all, it turned out to be as lame as the rest. The only star of the picture is the amazing house/machine/prison. If the re-writers put half the effort into the story that the set designer did into the house, this might have been mildly entertaining. While the puzzle-box contraption is well thought out and certainly complex (Hellraiser fans raise your hands), the series of narrow hallways in place of spooky rooms made this look more like a lethal game of Pac-Man than a haunted house story. Occasionally funny lines (the retort when someone asks where the lawyer went is priceless) but overall the dialogue is ridiculously sophomoric and unrealistic. Yes, I know this isn't a documentary, but Halloween III is Shakespeare compared to this drivel. I used to think Ghost Story was the most disappointing horror movie I had ever seen (great book, though!), but this one is worse.The sound is good overall, with effects happening in back corners when needed, and the soundtrack is appropriately loud and crude for a slacker-era remake flick. There are decent extras on the DVD, including a ""making-of"" featurette and some back-story on each of the ghosts. The latter is a great idea; too bad none of the ghosts seemed to have a personality in the movie. If you must check this out, flip the couple of bucks to rent it. The only scary thing about Thirteen Ghosts is (boo!) paying eight bucks to see it in a theatre or (shudder!) twenty bucks to own it!2002 Bill Holmes",1,Boo.

Murray Abraham, who met his end during a high-tech exorcism. They bring their young son and daughter to the isolated house, which is all but entirely made out of unbreakable glass and etched throughout with bizarre occult scribblings. Ghostbuster Matthew Lillard, Abraham's former paranormalist colleague, tries to clear Shalhoub and his family out of the house, but instead gets himself trapped inside it with them - seems Abraham built the thing as a high-tech ghost-trap, and now that they're all inside it, the mechanism of the house has come to life to release the imprisoned ghosts inside, and ultimately open the doorway to Hell...It's slick and scary, more a roller coaster ride than a spook house. The performances are adequate, but they don't really want to be more than that, since the real star of this production is the house, which is gorgeous to behold. The script is clever, the effects quite good.

Arthur Kriticos, gentle math teacher, is the nephew of a evil scientist named Cyrus Kriticos. Arthur is mourning the loss of his wife and all their belongings when Cyrus dies and leaves him a bizarre house of glass. Inside are trapped 12 ghosts; angry and demented, they'll attack anyone who comes near. Arthur and his remaining family becomes trapped in the house with their housekeeper and a ghost hunter who helped build the house. With the help of special glasses that allow them to see the ghosts, and a handful of spells, they must evade the ghosts and find a way out before one of them becomes the 13th ghost! An ""almost"" movie that could have been good if the house had not become the star of the show.The house. It is a bizarre cube of glass and gears that ticks around like a clockwork. Strange inscriptions are engraved in the glass walls. At the house the family also meets a ghost hunter, Joshua Rafkin, [Adam Kaminsky] who helped to build it. The cube, we learn almost immediately through some quick exposition by Joshua, is actually a containment device holding 12 ghosts--11 who are extremely angry and quite demented, and 1 who is well known to the family: their wife and mother. The ghosts are held back by the spells on the walls, and are kept locked in the basement of the house. But as it ticks around, they are freed, one by one.Each ghost is a masterpiece of special effects; Gregory Nicotero has done his usual amazing job. And the use of the spells and other devices, including glasses that allow the wearer to see the ghosts, allows director Steve Beck to pull off some cute scenes. There are scenes in which only one person present can see the ghost and mayhem ensues, scenes using the containment spells as a shield. But after 10 minutes or so, you've seen the whole movie. Because the plot never really develops, nor do the characters. It's like watching someone play a video game--there's a goal, because games have to have goals, but no deep reason, and watching someone else play gets tiresome after a while.13 Ghosts is probably worth seeing for the effects, but if you watch the middle third of the movie, you'll get everything you can out of it, and maybe your money's worth, if its a rental.",2,An almost good horror film that falls flat because the fx become the stars of the film,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,2331,"['remake', 'William', 'Castle', '13', 'Ghosts', '1960', 'new', 'version', 'differs', 'considerably', 'first', 'Arthur', 'Kriticos', 'gentle', 'math', 'teacher', 'nephew', 'evil', 'scientist', 'named', 'Cyrus', 'Kriticos', 'Arthur', 'mourning', 'loss', 'wife', 'belongings', 'when', 'Cyrus', 'bizarre', 'house', 'glass', 'Inside', 'are', 'trapped', '12', 'ghosts', 'angry', 'demented', ""'ll"", 'attack', 'anyone', 'who', 'near', 'Arthur', 'remaining', 'family', 'trapped', 'house', 'housekeeper', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'who', 'helped', 'build', 'house', 'help', 'special', 'glasses', 'allow', 'see', 'ghosts', 'handful', 'spells', 'must', 'evade', 'ghosts', 'find', 'way', 'one', '13th', 'ghost', 'almost', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'house', 'had', 'not', 'become', 'star', 'show.The', 'house', 'bizarre', 'cube', 'glass', 'gears', 'ticks', 'clockwork', 'Strange', 'inscriptions', 'are', 'engraved', 'glass', 'walls', 'house', 'family', 'also', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'Joshua', 'Rafkin', '[', 'Adam', 'Kaminsky', ']', 'who', 'helped', 'build', 'cube', 'learn', 'almost', 'immediately', 'quick', 'exposition', 'Joshua', 'actually', 'containment', 'device', 'holding', '12', 'ghosts', '11', 'who', 'are', 'extremely', 'angry', 'quite', 'demented', '1', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'family', 'wife', 'mother', 'ghosts', 'are', 'held', 'back', 'spells', 'walls', 'are', 'kept', 'locked', 'basement', 'house', 'around', 'are', 'freed', 'one', 'one.Each', 'ghost', 'masterpiece', 'special', 'effects', 'Gregory', 'Nicotero', 'done', 'usual', 'amazing', 'job', 'use', 'spells', 'other', 'devices', 'including', 'glasses', 'allow', 'wearer', 'see', 'ghosts', 'director', 'Steve', 'Beck', 'pull', 'off', 'cute', 'scenes', 'are', 'scenes', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'present', 'can', 'see', 'ghost', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'scenes', 'using', 'containment', 'shield', '10', 'minutes', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'movie', 'plot', 'never', 'really', 'do', 'characters', 'watching', 'someone', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'goal', 'games', 'have', 'have', 'goals', 'deep', 'reason', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'play', 'tiresome', 'while.13', 'Ghosts', 'probably', 'worth', 'seeing', 'effects', 'watch', 'middle', 'third', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'get', 'everything', 'can', 'maybe', 'money', 'worth', 'rental']",Thirteen Ghosts

Never seen anything quite like it before. The ending is rather predictable granted. The cornball humor isn't TOO over the top as in many horror flicks.... And I appreciate that! The big muck up here is STORY! If they had given each of the ghosts even a brief characterization run over in the actual movie as is in the DVD's special features, it would've given the story what is essential for a flick of this genre... A ghost story!That is afterall the basis of ALL stories... The 5 f's; who, what, where, when, why! How the guy got a hook for a hand? What his mommy did to make him psycho? And of course the circumstances of his death which made him a ghost to begin with? What is a ghost story without these neccesities? Now there is a main storyline here... And this is done rather good... But...Here we have 13 ghosts, and we only get such crucial storyline origins for about 3 of the 13 ghosts, and even those (Spare the dead wife's characterization) are done a bit too vague! So what we are left with is all damned cool looking yet nameless and faceless ghosts that pop up and while they make look very gruesome and may have some scare tactics in that aspect alone... They could've been made so much more creepier had at least a bit of tale been told on each. I take it such origins were never filmed or left out because of time constraints... But this is the movie's biggest flaw. Without it, we're mostly reduced to just eye candy here!And the eye candy is damned good! The ghosts are indeed gruesome. The sets are great, albeit the house is almost entirely CGI... Which should attest to how great it is since it's fooled most the reviewers. I myself thought it was a set till I scoped out the special features on the DVD.... And I usually have a good enough eye to spot CGI.It's not a bad flick. There's far worse out there. Unfortuneatly it's just another eye candy reliant film all in all. By all means if you get the DVD, watch the 13 ghosts characterizations FIRST! That'll definitely add some of the needed storyline flair.Consider my rating a 2.5 stars outta 5!

685628,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005UQ9W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[31, 37]","William Castle was one of the true geniuses of horror, and Thirteen Ghosts represents a modernized, special effects-heavy remake of his 1960 film of the same name.  I would file this effort under C for cool rather than F for frightening, although I suppose many less inured to the tricks of the horror trade might find this film a frightening detour into madness.  Thirteen Ghosts offers an exciting, gory, romping good time, and I think the real key to its success is not its plot, acting, or CGI effects; rather, it is the movie's establishment of something different from your standard horror fare.  For the most part, all of the action takes place in a single setting, a technological marvel of a house built entirely of glass walls.  While the process of shooting scenes in such a highly reflective setting must have been quite a challenge to the crew, the shooting style allows for a more open-ended atmosphere of fear, where things that go bump in the night can appear where you least expect them.  Of course, the characters cannot see any ghosts on their own; no, you can apparently only see ghosts by donning a pair of safety glasses.  The whole glasses thing is a little shaky, but it stands as a more practical substitute for the 3-D glasses the viewers of Castle's original film were required to wear.  The ghosts, for their part, are very well done, especially the &quot;angry princess&quot; who, I have to say, is quite hot (in a bloody, fiendish sort of way).All the madness traces itself to one Cyrus Kriticos (played in an effectively subtle way by F. Murray Abraham).  He is a collector of many things, especially ghosts, aided immeasurably by psychic and borderline nut Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard).  Rafkin does not discover the real agenda behind Kriticos' capturing of specific, tormented souls until it is almost too late, at which point he finds himself trying to undo the wrong he has done by helping the family of Arthur Kriticos survive Cyrus' designs for them.  The always-oddly effective Tony Shalhoub plays Arthur, a man who lost his wife and everything else he has apart from his kids in a terrible fire.  The gorgeous Shannon Elizabeth plays his daughter Kathy, but Elizabeth's talents are rather wasted in this role (and there are far too few scenes graced with her presence).  The struggling family is overjoyed to learn that weird Uncle Cyrus has left Arthur his estate, and they are as excited as they are intrigued by the new home they come to explore.  With glass walls covered with Latin writing everywhere, extremely modern furnishings, and a sense of grade-A rich, eccentric oddness from top to bottom, the family members see the house as a dream come true.  Of course, the dream soon becomes a nightmare.  There are twelve really, really unpleasant ghosts contained in the basement, and the house turns out to be a machine whose ancient yet modern design serves one specific purpose: to open the gates of hell and grant great power to the man who has wrought this abominable mechanism. Our heroes soon find themselves trapped in the house, accompanied by Rafkin, a mysterious stranger, and the family's stereotypical black, ghost-fearing nanny.  They must fight for both their lives and their sanity as each of the twelve ghosts is released and set to the most fiendish of purposes.  The ending is a little hokey, I have to admit, but it cannot undo all the fun to be had along the way.  The special features are also noteworthy.  Along with a look at the making of the film, you get a look at the history of each of the ghosts in the film; frankly, this background material should have been better interwoven into the plot than it was.The special effects are, by and large, quite good.  A lot of CGI animation went into the making of this film, and it works amazingly well.  The ghosts themselves are substantial creatures, each with a history of its own, capable and more than willing to unleash their own eternal horrors on the desperate human beings walking the halls of the glass prison.

Reilly,"[2, 5]","Not a classic, but not a bad way to spend a few hours....Thirteen Ghosts tells the story of a family that inherits a HUGE glass mansion from a rich Uncle. They also inherit a cellar-full of glass cells that are home to such cuddly ectoplasmic entities as First Son, The Breaker, Dire Mother, and (my personal favorite), Angry Princess. The pasty-faced ne'er-do-wells are not too happy to be cooped up in the dingy basement, and they're just dying (sorry...!) to get to know their new neighbors...The cast does the best they can with what they're given; I can get past cheesy lines like ""Who am I??? Dr. Phil??"", but I swear, the next time I see a too-hip-for-the-room black character say something like ""I'm trapped in this house with some crazy white people!"", I'm gonna puke. Rah Digga (Even her NAME is irritating!) utters that tired line, and she also sings/raps/croaks out the closing title song. Yuck....that's the scariest part of the film! And just as a little aside- What is this supposedly dirt-poor family doing with a nanny? Why can't the daughter watch the morbid little boy? Don't ask questions, just accept....The effects are pretty good, and the Ghosts are truly original looking. (I'm particularly smitten with The Angry Princess played by Shawna Loyer...she's JUST....SO.....BEAUTIFUL!!) And Shannon Elizabeth is just as cute as ever.... F.

685631,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B00005UQ9W,David Girod,"[3, 3]","Considering this is a remake of the William Castle ""gimmick"" b-movie, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" is more entertaining than it should be, but not a good as it could have been.What I mean to say is that while I love the William Castle original film, Castle's version was more of a comedy with a nifty 3-D gimmick thrown in. The basic story of a family inheriting a haunted mansion was pure sitcom at best. And while there are some chills sprinkled through the original film, the humor is what I remember most about the film.The remake does away with all of the humor and attempts to go for the jugular as a pure horror film. The basic storyline remains the same in that a family inherits a haunted house from a ghost hunting uncle. And like the original, 12 spirits inhabit the house...so who is the thirteenth ghost? You have to watch to find out.Tony Shalhoub turns in a solid performance as Arthur Kriticos, the widower and family man who inherits the haunted home from his uncle. Shalhoub was only 1 year away from striking gold with his TV show ""Monk"" when this film came out, and I find it difficult watching ""Thirteen Ghosts"" now, and not thinking of the Monk character obsessing about fingerprints all over the glass house?!?! The rest of the cast is solid as well, with F. Murray Abraham chewing up scenes as the ghost hunting uncle and Matthew Lillard still hunting ghosts here in his pre-Shaggy days.The special effects are pretty good, and the make-up for the various ghosts looks great. The glass house featured in the film is pretty inventive, and adds a nice touch of atmosphere. There are a few bumps and jumps that will jolt you out of your seat sprinkled throughout the film, but there is nothing in the movie that will stick with you past the end credits.If you enjoyed the remake of ""The House on Haunted Hill"", then you will probably enjoy this film as well. If you are looking for a spooky ghost story along the lines of ""The Changeling"", you will probably be disappointed.",3,Fun Movie that Should Have Been Much Better,1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,1984,"['Considering', 'remake', 'William', 'Castle', 'gimmick', 'b-movie', 'Thirteen', 'Ghosts', 'more', 'entertaining', 'should', 'be', 'not', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been.What', 'mean', 'say', 'love', 'William', 'Castle', 'original', 'film', 'Castle', 'version', 'was', 'more', 'comedy', 'nifty', '3-D', 'gimmick', 'thrown', 'basic', 'story', 'family', 'inheriting', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'was', 'pure', 'sitcom', 'best', 'are', 'chills', 'sprinkled', 'original', 'film', 'humor', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'film.The', 'remake', 'away', 'humor', 'attempts', 'go', 'jugular', 'pure', 'horror', 'film', 'basic', 'storyline', 'same', 'family', 'haunted', 'house', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'uncle', 'original', '12', 'spirits', 'inhabit', 'house', 'so', 'who', 'thirteenth', 'ghost', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'solid', 'performance', 'Arthur', 'Kriticos', 'widower', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'haunted', 'home', 'uncle', 'Shalhoub', 'was', 'only', '1', 'year', 'away', 'striking', 'gold', 'TV', 'show', 'Monk', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'find', 'difficult', 'watching', 'Thirteen', 'Ghosts', 'now', 'not', 'thinking', 'Monk', 'character', 'obsessing', 'fingerprints', 'glass', 'house', 'rest', 'cast', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'chewing', 'up', 'scenes', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'uncle', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'still', 'hunting', 'ghosts', 'here', 'pre-Shaggy', 'days.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'make-up', 'various', 'ghosts', 'great', 'glass', 'house', 'featured', 'film', 'pretty', 'inventive', 'nice', 'touch', 'atmosphere', 'are', 'few', 'bumps', 'jumps', 'will', 'jolt', 'seat', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'nothing', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'past', 'end', 'credits.If', 'enjoyed', 'remake', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'looking', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'story', 'lines', 'Changeling', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed']",Thirteen Ghosts

It is based upon William Castle's 1960 film, which, although cheesy and dated, is actually a better film than this remake.  Even having seen the previous version, it still took a long time for me to understand what exactly was going on here.  This movie spends more time developing the ""characters"" of the ghosts than it does with the living people in the film.  The characters are completely unmemorable.  The wisecracking housekeeper was clearly added for comic relief, but seems out of place in this movie.  I'm not saying the acting was bad (you can't do better than F. Murray Abraham), but you don't learn enough about any of these people to care about them.  Some of them die, and you're left thinking, ""Who cares?""  Only the bare essentials of the original's plot is used, and very little of anything new was added.  The scene in which the mother, who was alive in the original but has been killed in a fire here, comes back in ghost-form to tell the family how much she still cares is sheer hokiness.  We, as an audience, don't care at all about these people, and even less about her.  Sure the new house looks kinda cool, but the original was much creepier and came complete with a built-in Margaret Hamilton.  And the ""ghost viewers"", which were handed out to movie theater patrons in 1960 (and are included in the DVD of the original version), are only worn by the actors in this version, and look like something the costume department bought by the gross at 68 cents a pair.  At least the one in the original movie showed some imagination.

Litton,"[8, 15]","When &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; and &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; were released earlier this year, I thought I'd been subjected to the most silly and contrived of the year's plots. After seeing &quot;13 Ghosts,&quot; I'm reconsidering that opinion. The film is a rehash of a 1960 camp classic by the same name, though I doubt that the word &quot;remake&quot; is justifiable.The bare bones of the original plot are borrowed, giving the filmmakers room to add their own story structure and plot twists for a modern audience. What a shame, though, that this movie turns out to be little more than an insult to the intelligence of even the most open-minded audience members, not to mention a striking disappointment from Dark Castle Entertainment, whose previous &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; remake was more intense, more likeable, and far more interesting.&quot;13 Ghosts&quot; begins with a scene that could have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film, except to set us up for the surprise at the end. Here, a wealthy man named Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) busies himself searching an auto junkyard in search of a ghost, which he hopes to trap in a box and take back to his mansion. Of course, all hell breaks loose, and Cyrus is killed, leaving behind an expansive mansion and a highly unstable partner, Rafkin (&quot;Scream's&quot; Matthew Lillard).What a break for Cyrus's nephew, Arthur (Tony Shalhoub), who lives in squalor with his two children and a nanny (the movie's obligatory black character) after a fire destroyed his home and took his wife years ago. They get to the house and are immediately enraptured by it's walls, large panes of glass with intricate Latin phrases that become illuminated when a special pair of glasses is worn by the inhabitant. It's never made clear what these glasses are for: they are just there for the unsuspecting family to start seeing the ghosts that start permeating the house once the machine downstairs starts twisting and rolling, thanks to some less-than-effective special effects.There are so many things that go wrong with the movie that its predecessor got right, one has to wonder if the screenwriters actually paid any attention to the original material. The glasses are a ripoff of the theater gimmick for the first movie (special viewers were given to the audience to allow them a choice of seeing the apparitions onscreen or not). Why the characters bother wearing them is beyond me: the audience is able to see the ghosts much of the time, diminishing any effect the movie may have had had we not been able to see what was going on, just as the characters do.The panes of glass with Latin phrases... well, they turn out to be spells, spells which cannot be bypassed by those trapped in the world of the dead, &quot;whether spoken or written,&quot; as one character points out. It's a complete machination on the part of the writers, who throw this, that, and the other into the story whenever it looks like something might get remotely interesting. This provides a very funny scene, however, as Arthur and Rafkin venture into the basement to find the children, carrying a large pane of glass with them for protection.The machine idea is the movie's most contrived, only serving to sink the plot lower into the depths of its own ludicrousness. Apparently, Cyrus collected certain ghosts that were needed to feed power to the machine once it reached its full velocity, therefore opening some eye of hell that would make him the most powerful man on Earth. Completely tongue-in-cheek dialogue for such explanations, though it's never funny, and never interesting or serving to advance the plot.As the credits rolled after the obligatory loud and happy ending, I began pondering why &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; was indeed such a mess. &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; followed a similar strategy of reworking a classic horror movie, but with this film, there is no interest behind the rework. The plot has no energy, no logic, no sense of what it so desperately wants to be about, and the result is a muddled mess of gory bloodshed, ridiculous plot twists and long periods of boredom.

685639,A3RTMB76CJWY9U,B00005UQ9W,DonAthos,"[2, 3]","If you're familiar with the system Roger Ebert employs in reviewing films, you'll know that he does not just have one scale. For instance, he does not compare films like The Godfather with films like Rob Schneider's The Animal; he knows that the audiences of these films come to see them for very different reasons, and therefore they must be rated according to how they live up to the type of film they are. The Animal might not be great when compared to The Godfather, but how is it when compared to other low-brow comedies like it, like the films of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey? (Actually, The Animal stinks pretty much no matter how you rate it, unless you're only comparing it to other Schneider films).I take the trouble of going through this, because, by most accounts, Thirteen Ghosts is not a good movie. It does poorly against The Godfather. But, Ebert is right, and Thirteen Ghosts was never written for the reasons that The Godfather was. It would be unfair to compare the two. Thirteen Ghosts is a horror movie--specifically, a B horror movie (as opposed to something like Poltergeist, The Others or The Sixth Sense) and intentionally so. It was written for fans of B horror films (and there are many; I am one). And, as a B horror film, it is a great movie.Tony Shaloub can act, folks. He's really great. And, actually, so is Matthew Lillard. The two of them conspire to do something that rarely happens in B horror films--they create believable characters that we truly care about. The rest of the cast are servicable (yeah, Elizabeth is hot, but we don't even get any exploitative footage out of her), though the little boy is fairly weak. The special effects and setting serve to create a whole other world that we finally buy into. The ghosts, themselves, are creepy and chilling and menacing. The film creates a good, chilling mood without relying on too many of the B horror film cliches (e.g. no cats jumping out). There are a couple of twists and turns and just enough plot to allow for all of the carnage that eventually takes place.This is not The Godfather, nor does it have to be; The Godfather is available to rent for anyone interested (and it is highly, highly recommended), but Thirteen Ghosts is good to have along side of it for those seeking other things.

685642,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B00005UQ9W,e1x56u$*w#,"[0, 0]","This is one of those movies that I know is not good, but for some reason I just can't help liking anyway.Other reviewers have gone into the details of the plot, so in this review I will just stick to my opinions.I don't like Tony Shalhoub, and find his usual mumbling, bumbling type acting irritating and unsuitable for the part of the father who brings his family to the strange house of glass bequeathed to them by his late brother.  The script is nothing special either.  But in spite of this, I find that there are other things about this movie that make me like it, even though I feel I should know better.First of all there is Matthew Lillard as a psychic who is able to track ghosts.  After being the only thing about that horrible disaster of a live-action Scooby Doo movie that I liked with his great portrayal of Shaggy, I find Lillard quite likeable here too.Next are the superb creature designs and make-up they have crafted for each of the ghosts.  I was so impressed I found myself wishing some company would make action figures for some of them.Then there is the design of the unusual house itself.  It is visually stunning, and when I think of this movie, it is the first thing that springs to mind.  Very well done.There is also Rah Digga as the children's African-American governess Bess.  While I would normally cringe at her stereotypical ""smart-mouthed black chick"" character who just seems calculatingly included to widen the appeal of the movie to a wider demographic, in fact Digga does a great job and pulls it off, making her character quite likeable too and successfully injecting notes of humour into the movie.Combined with decent special effects and an overall polished look to the production, all these factors come together and manage to make this movie somehow work IN SPITE OF its bad script.  Overall I found it quite entertaining and watchable, and while it's certainly not one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, I'm still happy to have it in my collection to pull out from time to time and enjoy watching with a heaping bowl of popcorn.Yeah, one of those ""guilty pleasures"" type movies.",4,"Not great, but strangely appealing",1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,2130,"['one', 'movies', 'know', 'not', 'good', 'reason', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'anyway.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'gone', 'details', 'plot', 'so', 'review', 'will', 'just', 'stick', 'opinions.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'find', 'usual', 'mumbling', 'bumbling', 'type', 'acting', 'irritating', 'unsuitable', 'part', 'father', 'who', 'family', 'strange', 'house', 'glass', 'bequeathed', 'late', 'brother', 'script', 'nothing', 'special', 'either', 'spite', 'find', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'movie', 'make', 'even', 'feel', 'should', 'know', 'better.First', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'psychic', 'who', 'able', 'track', 'ghosts', 'being', 'only', 'thing', 'horrible', 'disaster', 'live-action', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'movie', 'liked', 'great', 'portrayal', 'Shaggy', 'find', 'Lillard', 'quite', 'likeable', 'here', 'are', 'superb', 'creature', 'designs', 'make-up', 'have', 'crafted', 'ghosts', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'found', 'wishing', 'company', 'would', 'make', 'action', 'figures', 'them.Then', 'design', 'unusual', 'house', 'visually', 'stunning', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'Very', 'well', 'also', 'Rah', 'Digga', 'children', 'African-American', 'governess', 'Bess', 'would', 'normally', 'cringe', 'stereotypical', 'smart-mouthed', 'black', 'chick', 'character', 'who', 'just', 'calculatingly', 'included', 'widen', 'appeal', 'movie', 'wider', 'demographic', 'fact', 'Digga', 'great', 'job', 'pulls', 'off', 'making', 'character', 'quite', 'likeable', 'too', 'successfully', 'injecting', 'notes', 'humour', 'movie.Combined', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'overall', 'polished', 'look', 'production', 'factors', 'come', 'together', 'manage', 'make', 'movie', 'somehow', 'work', 'IN', 'SPITE', 'bad', 'script', 'Overall', 'found', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'watchable', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'m"", 'still', 'happy', 'have', 'collection', 'pull', 'out', 'time', 'time', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'heaping', 'bowl', 'popcorn.Yeah', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'type', 'movies']",Thirteen Ghosts

This provides most of the plot, and you get to guess who dies and who does not (Hint:  it's not that hard).So if just want to put your brain on the mantle for awhile, what you get is an almost nonstop barrage of ghosts.  This is refreshing from countless movies that make you sit through bad dialog while waiting to see the special effects.  Not in this movie.  And not the cute Caspar kind of ghosts.  Here you get gory, mutilated ghosts that want to chop you up at every chance they can get.

Unfortunately, Thirteen Ghosts is mostly mindless, with a handful of good moments here and there, but hardly enough to make this worthwhil to even horror buffs.Tony Shalhoub stars as a teacher whose wife was killed in a fire that burned down their house.  Shalhoub and his two kids are in financial troube, but their problems seem to be solved when Shalhoub's late uncle (F. Murray Abraham, proving furhter that he's not nearly as good an actor as his Oscar might indicate) will his house to his niece.  Unlukcy enough for Shalhoub and his family, the entire place locks up and it turns out twelve ghosts inhabit the place and are looking to cause some death and destruction.Thirteen Ghosts is mess, thanks to Steve Beck's hyperkinetic direction.  In true MTV-style, Beck flashes several frames per second, making this an assault on the senses that's even more unbearable than Stigmata.  I don't understand, does Beck actually believe these quick cuts will generate scares?  Does he believe he's made a truly frightening film because of this style?  If he does, I feel sorry for the guy because all he's accomplished is creating doldrums.  Yes, Thirteen Ghosts commits the cardinal sin of a Hollywood thrill ride: it's boring.Why is this?  Aside from the direction, it's pretty obvious who's expendable and who isn't.  You know Shalhoub and his family are going to make it through more or less unscathed, which is too bad because I would have liked to have seen Shannon Elizabeth in a gruesome death scene.  Faring the best of the cast is Matthew Lillard, who's always amusing, and actually kind of likeable here.As I said before, there are a few good points.  A couple of death scenes are fairly memorable and some of the ghosts' physical appearances are appropriately ghastly.  The production design is actually fairly impressive, but not my cup of tea.  The idea of glass walls that make up a house might interest some, but I prefer a good old-fashioned mansion for a haunted abode.It'd be a bit pointless to mention how brainless the movie is (they remove glass at one point for protection from the ghosts) why not just remove more and more glass until they reach outside?) or how goofy the plot twists are (I bet you'd never expect the ending would be taken straight from, gag, Casper!).  I've come to expect such silliness from these films, but certainly, the trashiness factor didn't hurt House on Haunted Hill because it was enjoyable from beginning to end (and really, it was good trash).

685664,AUZ6CGJNPF0UX,B00005UQ9W,"Harvey J.Satan ""Harvey J.Satan""","[0, 0]","When I first saw this film in the theaters,I wasn't exactly won over,but the DVD inclusion of the ""Ghost Files"",helps A LOT! An initial problem with this film,is you don't really get a good perception of the ghosts,visually or background-wise.(Quick cut views,and snippets of information.). But on the DVD,you get F.Murray Abrahams,doing his best Rod Serling impression,with the Ghost Files,containing great images,sketches,explanations,and the missing information that would've made the film less tangled.That said...the film is good,but not great. Tony Shalhoub,always puts in a brilliant performance,and is no less a presents here as the widower,who suddenly inherits a haunted house from a rich dead uncle,F.Murray Abraham.( quite the scoundral.).Eddie Lilliard is the standout performance as the man who can sense the ghosts,and knows what's really going on in the mansion....or so he thinks.Embeth Davidtz,coming quite a ways since ""Army of Darkness"" is the activist who believes in the rights of the undead. ( You laugh,but in this day and age,you can bet there is one somewhere out there!)and Shannon Elizabeth is the teenage daughter,whom gets to scream alot.( Necessary for all horror films.)The film works,for the most part. Although it isn't anywhere close to the original William Castle film,aside from the basic plot. The upgrades are creative,the writing is good,and of course visual effects have come a long way since 1960. But I feel the producers missed the big picture.( As they did with the updated ""House On Haunted Hill""). William Castle was all about entertaining the audience,sure he loved to scare us,but he also loved to tease us too. He loved cheap gimmicks and audience participation.He set up ""shock chairs"" for ""The Tingler"",or handed out ""Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down"" audience voting cards for ""Mr.Sardonicus"". He also wasn't opposed to showing up suddenly,mid-film,and taunting the audience,breaking down the 4th wall. Basically,he didn't take it all too seriously. I think the minor complaint I have,is the new version wants so much to scare,it forgets to tender it a bit,like Castle did. We love Castle because he was,cheesey at times.The only bad part of this film,and I am frankly amazed it even exsists,is the character played by Rah Digga.Her character is not only an added character,but a bad idea as well. Portraying the nanny/babysitter,she is nothing less than a cross between Jar-Jar Binks,Stephen Fetchit,and Whoopi Goldberg.With lines like, ""I don't do windows"" & ""Crazy white people"",it's a wonder why any actress,black or white,would've taken this role. Her character is secondary to the story,and doesn't do all that much,other than recite ""ethnic"" lines. Shame on the writers for this.",4,Wanted: 13th Ghost.

It would have been more productive to sit and look at a blank wall, than watch 13 ghosts. Main reasons? Lack of a plot and lack of acting. But the greatest insult? That it carries the same name as the classic black and white movie.Now I know people don't expect stellar acting out of a horror movie - and neither do I. I expect camp and a certain amount of bad acting, and even enjoy it (the words ""I KICK (...) FOR THE LORD!"" come to mind), but not to this extent.A friend of mine told me that the main two actors are actually respected actors, and have done other movies well. If that really is the case, then I hope it was the directing, or something else that caused them to be so ultra-bad.If it isn't intelligence-insulting stupid racial comments (""You white people are crazy"") that might appeal to the teens and pre-teens, it's the Scream guy's attempted deadpan imbecilic humor. The rating on this movie should not have been R - it should have been PG13, as I can't see how it would appeal to the older audience.It's unfortunate that the trailer for this movie seemed so promising, that I couldn't pass up a chance to see it. And if you're like me, and were intrigued by the moving glass walls, and a promising plot, you're likely to regret every second afterwards.Thirteen ghosts should be considered the Glitter of horror movies. Rent it, if you have to see what it's like. But avoid buying it like the plague.

Based on the classic William Castle horror movie, I was kind of impressed that they didn't make this one stink, as remakes usually do.  However, plot and logic go flying out the window and the film turns to mush a little way into the flick.The plot is centralized around a pretty interesting premise that a group of trapped ghosts can give a man total power of the future.  I can't really say more, cause it could possibly ruin part of the movie, but going off of what I've said, it's pretty clear that this would be an easy idea to screw up.After a pretty cool opening twenty minutes, the film turns into your basic, run of the mill horror films with stupid characters doing stupid things, like running the wrong way constantly, splitting up, etc.  It seems like horror movies nowadays are just content with having scary things jumping out from behind pillars, corners, and whatever else they can hide behind.  The neat thing about this is that sometimes the scary things don't have to hide at all.As in most modern horror movies, the make-up and production values are incredible.  The gory makeup is pretty shocking and the house that is the central figure in the movie is really neat looking.  But the direction seems to squander this with quick cuts and odd camera angles, that instead of creating a sense of tension, as they were meant to do, only make you mad.  Clear shots of the ghosts are never seen, as apparently director Steve Beck decided it would be scarier to never truly see a lot of them clearly.The acting in the movie is pretty good, and Shalhoub doesn't dissapoint.  Matthew Lillard is given some great lines to work with, and he actually does a credible job while continuing to spew saliva all over everyone else.  The rest of the cast is pretty much wasted, but this isn't a drama so you can deal with it.Sometimes the logic in the film slips to a point where you want to stand up and shout out how stupid it is, but the death scenes are relatively well done.  The first major death scene is a doosey that'll make your girlfriend cringe.Overall, this is an entertaining popcorn Halloween horror movie, and that's all it was intended to be.  Even though you might be disappointed in a few aspects of what happens throughout the short hour and a half running time, you'll still feel pretty satisfied when it's all over.  THIR13EN GHOSTS is the film equivalent of eating CiCi's Pizza.

I watched Mullholland Drive and thought it was the dumbest movie I have ever seen.  Before watching Thirteen Ghosts I was hoping that it would be good to relive me of Mullholland Drive.  I was right!Thirteen Ghosts is primarly a horror movie, but it has great thrills and the ghosts are fantastic.  The reason I gave it four stars is because I didn't want it to touch the sci-fi side but it did.  I didn't like the idea of the big metal thing in the room and the thing that the daughter and son were trapped in.I believe Dark Castle entertainment did a good job with the film.  The actors were fantastic and the director did a great job with filming the ghosts and everything. Each ghost had a good story to them and they were all different and unique in their own ways.The story is about a family who lost their mother when their house burnt down.  The father still hasn't overcome it.  One day a man comes to their house and says hes the father's uncle's lawyer.  The uncle was rich and had died.  In his video will he gives the family his all glass mansion.  They are excited and do to check it out.  When they get there they find it very odd because all of the walls are glass with strange writing on them.  In the basement however there are ghosts locked up.I won't tell you anymore.

685672,A27RFBMPCWGZSZ,B00005UQ9W,Jason Waldman,"[0, 0]","On it's own, Thirteen Ghosts is nothing spectacular, unless you're talking about the ghosts themselves, but the DVD version has some cool extras that make it more worthwhile.The movie starts out promising, with a really cool opening scene in a junkyard.  After that, the story kind of goes downhill, with a family moving into a house made out of glass (before you say it, there already is the required ""no throwing stones"" joke in the movie, and it's not funny there, either) that also happens to house a machine designed (allegedly) by the devil and twelve ghosts that are being released one by one to attack the family.  The ghosts are all really cool looking and the attack scenes are awesome.  There are some very chilling moments in those, especially when they come out of nowhere, since the characters need special glasses to see them.Acting-wise, the best I can say about this is that Shannon Elizabeth's in it, but only for the first half.  Tony Shalhoub, who plays the dad and was also in Wings I believe, is decent, but he doesn't have a whole lot to work with.  Matthew Lillard is just a bit too campy in this, while the nanny is just plain annoying and unnecessary.  F. Murray Abraham is decent as Uncle Cyrus, but he's hardly on-screen at all.The plot gets kind of murky, as if the writers didn't know how to get from point A to point B.  There's a plot twist towards the end that's interesting, but isn't anything Earth-shattering.  The whole thing feels extremely rushed, with another character eventually revealing the secret of the house and how to stop it.  The ending is especially unsatisfying, with no insight as to how the dad figured out what was going on.The movie really shines in the extras.  There's a neat documentary on the film, including how they did the makeup and special effects.  The best extra, though, is the ghost files, which gives a history on twelve of the ghosts in the movie.

All the actors in the film give great performances, especially the always lovely Shannon Elizabeth and the witty Mathew (Scream) Lillard. The ghosts in the film look amazing, thanks to KNB FX.

The ghosts are trapped in a special house, which has been willed to his nephew (Tony Shaloub).The different spirits are very spooky, and the grimoire is very well done.

I had heard that it was about a guy inheriting his uncle's haunted house.  When I saw the movie, it was so far off from my expectations, I didn't really like it.  Having watched it a second time, - without those expectations - I realize that it is really a good horror flick.  It is NOT your traditional haunted house kind of story. Go in with the right expectations and I'll bet you'll like it.Tony Shalhoub (the guy who plays Monk on TV) plays Arthur Kriticos, a widower and father of two, he lost everything (including his wife) in a fire and his salary as a math teacher isn't making ends meet. When he is told that he has inherited his uncle's house (the uncle no one liked because he squandered the family fortune), he and the family are ecstatic.  They and their maid ... I know, if he has no money how does he have a maid, but she is the comic relief so I'll leave it alone ... they go up to see the house and sign the lawyer's papers.What they don't know is that the uncle squandered the fortune as a ghost collector, and not your garden variety spook either.  These ghosts, predominantly, are the meanest of the mean and they CAN hurt you.  More than that, he found directions in some ancient grimoire of how to build some elaborate machine to open the eye of hell.

I can teach her love and help her to realize that she is the most beautiful and wonderous creature that has ever graced this earth.Her slash marks are a testimony to the pain of her tortured life. Though blind in one eye, she can still see her image in the mirror. It is this image that has stolen my heart and will forever haunt my dreams. Why did she feel that she had to make herself perfect for men that did not appreciate her? She had already achieved perfection and should have waited for her hero to emerge from the riff raff. Just one look from her dark eyes or a glance at her perfect body would be enough for me to swear an undying love that would last longer than this world.Dana is my soul-mate. Though we are separated by the life/death barrier. I will find her and give her comfort. Maybe she is already expecting me, for my aura is stronger than most and my years of transcendence training under Master Yong-tet may have summoned her to my presence. If she is waiting for me, I hope first to gain her trust, then appease her anger, and finally show her the way to love.But what of her message in the bathroom. ""I'm Sorry"" was written plain to see in her own blood. How could this be? She was in the bathtub and cut herself several times. How could she have stepped out of the tub, wrote the message, then return to the tub? True there was blood all over the bathroom, but around the message it was clear. No blood dripping from other cuts, or bloody footprints. I can only assume she wrote it first by cutting herself once, then entered the tub.But who was she saying she was sorry to? I think perhaps she was delivering a message to me. She did not know me in life, but something told her about me. Perhaps she had her own insight that we were to meet. Maybe she got tired of waiting and the agony that was her life was too much. If only I had found and met her sooner she may still be alive today, happy with me. But alas, her lifeforce fled from her. With her last gasping breath I can only hope she thought of me and hoped I would come for her.Yes, yes my Princess, my Queen. Let me help you melt away your anger and find joy. I am coming. I am almost there. By this time tonight, you and I will be together as one.

Forget the cast and their characters (Annoying kid, and why did Shannon Elizabeth's character have to be so fake and obsessed with bathrooms?), tune in for the actual 13 ghosts and great directing shots given by Steve Beck. Suspense and minorly frightening imagery is displayed throughout. The imagery is flashy -- not subtle -- but it's pulled off very well. The ghosts are all greatly done. The interesting supplement on the DVD explaining each ghost's backstory is a great addition to the DVD.Pardon me for saying to forget about the cast. Half of it does work. Rah Digga as the nanny, Maggie, is here for the one liners. I found her funny and cared for her most as a character. Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is one of the antagonists, and her twist around in the movie wasn't all that surprising, but she played her part fairly well. Matthew Lillard was on and off the whole, but his performance was enjoyable. What was off was Shannon Elizabeth's performance. Was she meant to be playing a 12 year old? Her all too goody show at the beginning just threw me off. And the little kid, egh...I won't bother.Thirteen Ghosts has great horror qualities when it comes to suspense, imagery, and scares.

The cast ranges from the where is my paycheck crowd (F. Murray Abraham and Tony Shalhoub), disappointedly clothed (Shannon Elizabeth about 10 years too old to play virginal teenagers and cutie Embeth Davidtz), and remarkably irritating (Alec Roberts playing a little boy you wish would just die. Matthew Lillard in his the most irritating role ever and that's saying something. And female rapper Rah Digger channeling every offensive black maid stereotype and inventing a few new ones. Come to think of it a black maid is so 1960's anyone who is anyone has a European au pair.) Yes the good old black maid stereotype, Digger is apparently channeling Beulah from Party at Horror beach She exclaims she ain't washing no windows (It's an all glass house) and for you film historians out there she doesn't birth no babies either. The rest of the comic relief is at about the same level. With Lillard practically imploding on his performance in a mad dog style that has to be seen to be believed and underutilized Davidtz stuck with the laughable task of playing an environmentalist ghost protector. On the plus side the ghosts are very well done however they don't have nearly enough screen time and look a bit like the cast of Hellraiser is moonlighting. The set design with a giant glass house with beautiful Latin writings on the walls is where the movie shines. I guess in a haunted house movie the ghosts and house are the real stars.

Murray Abraham, Embeth Davidtz, Shannon Elizabeth, and Matthew Lillard.  It also features Rah Digga and a host of non-speaking(mainly growling and shrieking) ghosts.  The plot is very interesting.  It seems that Cyrus Kriticos(Abraham) has become a collector of dead souls.  He utilizes the psychic abilities of Lillard's character to seek out twelve specific souls that he plans to use in a grand and devious scheme to take over the world.When things go wrong for Cyrus, he sets into motion a series of events that bring his hardluck nephew(Shalhoub) and his two children to a wonderfully designed glass house that they ""inherit"" from him.  Of course, all of this is part of the plan to take over the world.  Tagging along are a lawyer, the housekeeper(Digga), Lillard, and Davidtz' character who is something of an ecto-lover(think PETA for the dead).The house and it's lifeless guests are the real stars of this flick, just as the asylum in ""House on Haunted Hill"" and the ship in ""Ghost Ship.""  All of these flicks bear the production of Dark Castle, who have become known for their slick gore and wonderfully evil CGI.  The best ghosts, to me, were ""the Jackal,"" ""the Hammer,"" and ""the Angry Princess.""  All of the ghosts, however, are done flawlessly by the FX team.Had the film's story been a little spookier, I'd have given it four stars.  As a matter of fact, I feel that it qualifies more as a sci-fi flick than a true horror story.  The ghosts are wonderful, the action is slick, the acting is good(though Elizabeth is too old to be playing such a young and enthusiastic teen), the house is a wonder to look at, and much like the rest of Dark Castle's flicks, it doesn't run too long.  Dark Castle knows when to put a stop to the horror that they crank out, and that's rare in Hollywood these days.The disc's special features, primarily the short biographies of the ghosts, are pretty good.  There isn't too much to fish through, but the quality of the features is what matters.  I rarely look at the extras, but the biographies add quite a bit to the flick.So, if you like stylized gore, any of the other flicks by Dark Castle, or genuinely want to watch a pretty slick flick, I recommend ""Thirteen Ghosts"" to you.",3,"Decent Flick, More Sci-Fi Than Horror Though",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,2271,"['Thirteen', 'Ghosts', 'features', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'also', 'Rah', 'Digga', 'host', 'non-speaking', 'mainly', 'growling', 'shrieking', 'ghosts', 'plot', 'very', 'interesting', 'Cyrus', 'Kriticos', 'Abraham', 'become', 'collector', 'dead', 'souls', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Lillard', 'character', 'seek', 'out', 'twelve', 'specific', 'souls', 'use', 'grand', 'devious', 'scheme', 'take', 'over', 'world.When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'Cyrus', 'motion', 'series', 'events', 'bring', 'hardluck', 'nephew', 'Shalhoub', 'two', 'children', 'wonderfully', 'designed', 'glass', 'house', 'inherit', 'course', 'part', 'plan', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'Tagging', 'along', 'are', 'lawyer', 'housekeeper', 'Digga', 'Lillard', 'Davidtz', 'character', 'who', 'something', 'ecto-lover', 'think', 'PETA', 'dead', '.The', 'house', 'lifeless', 'guests', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'flick', 'just', 'asylum', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'ship', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'flicks', 'bear', 'production', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'known', 'slick', 'gore', 'wonderfully', 'evil', 'CGI', 'best', 'ghosts', 'were', 'Jackal', 'Hammer', 'Angry', 'Princess', 'ghosts', 'however', 'are', 'done', 'flawlessly', 'FX', 'team.Had', 'film', 'story', 'been', 'little', 'spookier', ""'d"", 'have', 'given', 'four', 'stars', 'matter', 'fact', 'feel', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'true', 'horror', 'story', 'ghosts', 'are', 'wonderful', 'action', 'slick', 'acting', 'good', 'Elizabeth', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'such', 'young', 'enthusiastic', 'teen', 'house', 'wonder', 'look', 'much', 'rest', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'flicks', ""n't"", 'run', 'too', 'long', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'when', 'put', 'stop', 'horror', 'crank', 'out', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'days.The', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'primarily', 'short', 'biographies', 'ghosts', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'fish', 'quality', 'features', 'what', 'matters', 'rarely', 'look', 'extras', 'biographies', 'add', 'quite', 'bit', 'flick.So', 'like', 'stylized', 'gore', 'other', 'flicks', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'genuinely', 'want', 'watch', 'pretty', 'slick', 'flick', 'recommend', 'Thirteen', 'Ghosts']",Thirteen Ghosts

They had the good idea (well actually they ripped that off from the original), but reworking that script wasn't a bad idea. However, they didn't pull it off too well. The acting wasn't too bad for the actors that were in it. Shannon Elizabeth has obviously never ben known for immense acting talent and Matthew Lillard who comes off ok for a psycho. The thing I hated most about this movie was that they never went in depth about anything. We got to see about 20 feet of the house before hell started to break loose, and barely any time is spent on charcter development at all. (i.e. the woman that shows up 3/4 through the movie already in the house) Could have been done much better!The good things: The reason I gave this any stars was because the special effects on the ghosts were pretty entertaining. That woman with a box on her head was the best. Creepy and silly at the same time.

685703,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005UQ9W,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","You certainly have to admire the ambition behind ""Thirteen Ghosts,"" especially for people who were inspired by the legacy of William Castle.  The legendary schlock meister was famous for making movies using a single set and pretty much no matter what story they came up with for this updated version of the 1960 film where you had to wear the special glasses to see the ghosts in the movie it was not going to be as impressive as this set.  In creating the home of Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), Production Designer Sean Hargreaves, Art Director Don Macaulay, and Set Decorator Dominique Fauquet-Lemaitre came up with something innovative and visually stunning.  It is a good thing that the characters go on a tour of the house because the audience is sitting there checking out the place too and not paying attention to what anybody is saying.  When you think of all the low-budget horror films that had great stories but minimum productive values and you see how the makers of ""Thirteen Ghosts"" have squandered the opportunity afforded by this fantastic set, I have to agree with one of the characters and screen very loudly (like the sound level on this film) ""AHHHHHH! I HATE IT WHEN THEY DO THAT!""""Thirteen Ghosts"" (a.k.a. ""Thir13en Ghosts"") is one of those movies where it might have worked better if the exposition came in the prologue of the film.  We learn that this wonderful set is not a house but a machine (""designed by the devil and powered by the dead""), which means all the whirling gears, the sliding glass panels, and the spinning circles on the floor, all have significant meanings.  But we do not learn this until about halfway through the film, by which point you are not really in a position to retroactively go back and make sense of what we have already seen.  I appreciated the film a lot more the second time around, but second viewings are supposed to be to explore the depth of a film and not to figure out what was really going on in the first place.  The set is awesome and the ghosts are suitably gruesome, but the story and the characters are not up to the challenge.  I am serious when I say that if you go set the audio track from English to something you do not speak (your choice) that your comprehension of the film would not seriously suffer.  The look of this film is spectacular, an absolute visual treat and I can only imagine what it was like for the cast and crew when they first arrived on the set. But with all the time and effort spent on the set and makeup, paying equal attention the story (rather than the volume level) could have made this a landmark horror film.The DVD extras are sparse but decent.  The commentary shows that the people behind the camera were very much enamored with the giant toy they had constructed and the ghosts they had running around.  We also get the back-stories on the 12 ghosts, narrated by the man who should know, Cyrus Kriticos.  This helps to reinforce the problem of the film in terms of understanding what is going on, because here are all this semi-developed back-stories that are barely touched upon in the film.  Ironically, I think with the backstories this script could be turned into a pretty good horror novel.",3,AHHHHHH!

685708,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005UQ9W,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 5]","Ah yes, the ever-popular B-movie.  This movie is exactly that, and as with all B-movies, there will be those who like it, those who don't, and those who thought it was okay but were generally bored.Trying to put all these somewhat conflicting reviews into perspective, I would say that the plot has a couple of unique twists, the house is great, and there is a death I hadn't seen before.  If the twists, the house or the death didn't hold your interest or intrigue you, then you quickly lost interest and either became bored, or didn't like the movie at all.The story is relatively simple, and some parts of it parallel other horror movies.  A ghost-hunting relative (in this case, an uncle) dies (there's a twist here), leaving a huge mansion and a lot of money to a relatively poor relative.  The poor relative moves his family along with assorted hangers-on and intruders into the relative's house.  The deceased relative had ulterior motives for wanting his heir to move into the house (which I won't talk about - there have to be some surprises), and miscellaneous acts of gory violence ensue.I understood early on that the ghosts appearing and disappearing even when wearing the special glasses was an ability that the ghosts had, but they had to appear to cause physical events.  However, the popping in and out, which was initially interesting, became annoying.  Some of the early manifestations had some level of scare factor.  Most especially the bath tub scene and one scene in the basement; afterward the affect was diluted as you became numb to ghosts popping in and out.The concept that the ghosts in the basement were there to power a portal to hell was interesting, along with the technique the uncle used to unleash the ghosts and direct them to their appropriate locations.There was a lot of acting horsepower in this movie, including Tony Shalhoub, Shannon Elizabeth, F. Murray Abraham, Matthew Dillard, and Embeth Davidtz (who also starred in ""Matilda"", if you can believe that).  In general the acting was decent, though I struggled a couple of times with Tony Shalhoub's struggle to accept Matthew Dillard's insistence that supernatural events were occurring in the house; it felt a bit artificial.  Even with all that horsepower, the real star of the movie was the house, a conglomeration of glass, antiques, Latin inscriptions, and, of course, ghosts.  There were several flaws with the house.  First, the scenes of the central engine were shown time after time, and ultimately began to feel like filler since it didn't really advance the plot.  Second, you never really knew where you were in the house other than in general terms, so while the house was big, the immensity was conveyed only when looking from the outside.  Third, just how did Embeth Davidtz get into the house after it appeared to close up?  Her answer seemed more than a stretch...something the director made up while having a martini.This movie had a lot of potential.  The basic concept was solid, and the acting horsepower unusual for a B horror movie.  However, while there were flashes of excellence, overall the movie delivered only part of the goods.  Those flashes of excellence pushed the movie into a 3-star rating, thus making it watchable.  Forgive the parts of the movie where it drags or has plot implausibilities.",3,"Flashes of Excellence, but still a B-Movie",1043020800,"01 20, 2003",2003,3323,"['Ah', 'yes', 'ever-popular', 'B-movie', 'movie', 'exactly', 'B-movies', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'were', 'generally', 'bored.Trying', 'put', 'somewhat', 'conflicting', 'reviews', 'perspective', 'would', 'say', 'plot', 'couple', 'unique', 'twists', 'house', 'great', 'death', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'twists', 'house', 'death', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest', 'intrigue', 'then', 'quickly', 'lost', 'interest', 'became', 'bored', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'all.The', 'story', 'relatively', 'simple', 'parts', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'ghost-hunting', 'relative', 'case', 'uncle', 'twist', 'here', 'leaving', 'huge', 'mansion', 'lot', 'money', 'relatively', 'poor', 'relative', 'poor', 'relative', 'moves', 'family', 'assorted', 'hangers-on', 'intruders', 'relative', 'house', 'deceased', 'relative', 'had', 'ulterior', 'motives', 'wanting', 'heir', 'move', 'house', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'have', 'be', 'surprises', 'miscellaneous', 'acts', 'gory', 'violence', 'ensue.I', 'understood', 'early', 'ghosts', 'appearing', 'disappearing', 'even', 'when', 'wearing', 'special', 'glasses', 'was', 'ability', 'ghosts', 'had', 'had', 'appear', 'cause', 'physical', 'events', 'However', 'popping', 'was', 'initially', 'interesting', 'became', 'annoying', 'early', 'manifestations', 'had', 'level', 'scare', 'factor', 'Most', 'especially', 'bath', 'tub', 'scene', 'one', 'scene', 'basement', 'affect', 'was', 'diluted', 'became', 'numb', 'ghosts', 'popping', 'out.The', 'concept', 'ghosts', 'basement', 'were', 'there', 'power', 'portal', 'hell', 'was', 'interesting', 'technique', 'uncle', 'used', 'unleash', 'ghosts', 'direct', 'appropriate', 'locations.There', 'was', 'lot', 'acting', 'horsepower', 'movie', 'including', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Matthew', 'Dillard', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'Matilda', 'can', 'believe', 'general', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'struggled', 'couple', 'times', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'struggle', 'accept', 'Matthew', 'Dillard', 'insistence', 'supernatural', 'events', 'were', 'occurring', 'house', 'felt', 'bit', 'artificial', 'Even', 'horsepower', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'was', 'house', 'conglomeration', 'glass', 'antiques', 'Latin', 'inscriptions', 'course', 'ghosts', 'were', 'several', 'flaws', 'house', 'First', 'scenes', 'central', 'engine', 'were', 'shown', 'time', 'time', 'ultimately', 'began', 'feel', 'filler', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'advance', 'plot', 'Second', 'never', 'really', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'house', 'other', 'general', 'terms', 'so', 'house', 'was', 'big', 'immensity', 'was', 'conveyed', 'only', 'when', 'looking', 'outside', 'Third', 'just', 'how', 'did', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'get', 'house', 'appeared', 'close', 'up', 'answer', 'seemed', 'more', 'stretch', 'something', 'director', 'made', 'up', 'having', 'martini.This', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'basic', 'concept', 'was', 'solid', 'acting', 'horsepower', 'unusual', 'B', 'horror', 'movie', 'However', 'were', 'flashes', 'excellence', 'movie', 'delivered', 'only', 'part', 'goods', 'flashes', 'excellence', 'pushed', 'movie', '3-star', 'rating', 'thus', 'making', 'watchable', 'Forgive', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'plot', 'implausibilities']",Thirteen Ghosts

685712,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00005UQ9W,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","There are often times when the local video store fails to have the latest hot release on its shelf. And as you look over what is left on the old racks, you begin to think that it makes more sense to go home and pull out an old movie to watch rather than dish out the money to rent something that night.  I found myself in that predicament the other night and after negotiating with my son we decided to pull out a horror film we hadn't watched in a while: THIR13TEN GHOSTS.Now I barely recall seeing the original film that bore this name from the 60's. And when I saw this in the theater I wasn't sure what to expect. But being a horror fan for most of my life, I watched this film with no expectations and discovered it to be one of those great movies that offer those items that make a horror film one to remember. It had horror, it had humor, it had suspense, it had a touching portion and above all it was about fun. We watch horror films for the same reason we ride roller coasters. Not to try and stimulate a heart attack, but close to it. We watch to get our nerves a tad shaken up, to feel the dampness of sweat on our palms and to feel relief that what we have just witnessed wasn't something that WE had to go through.The story unfolds easily. Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) is a wealthy man who starts off the film attempting to capture a violent ghost with the aid of psychic Dennis Rafkin (Matthew Lillard). During this capture, several men involved are killed as is Cyrus.Move on to the family of Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shaloub), Cyrus' nephew, who has recently lost nearly everything in a fire, including his late wife. Living as best they can, Arthur, his two children and their nanny wake one morning to the arrival of a lawyer with a recorded message on his laptop. It seems that Cyrus has left Arthur and family his estate in his will. And off the family goes to check it out.They arrive to find an unusual house made of glass with inscriptions on nearly every panel of glass. They also run into Dennis pretending to be an employee of the electric company. They all enter the house and are stunned by the antiquities inside as well as the sumptuousness of the house.Dennis goes down to the basement wearing a pair of glasses that enable the bearer to see the ghosts that have been captured and imprisoned there. Not sure what Cyrus is up to, he goes upstairs to warn Arthur and to help get his family out of the house. But it's too late. Wheels, literally, are set in motion when the lawyer gets to the basement first and trips a mechanism that locks up the house and causes a large machine to start up. It also results in the death of the lawyer.Arthur attempts to get his family together and leave but discovers that the house is now sealed. He also finds out that they didn't stay put where he told them to and is now off searching for each of them. Dennis explains who he is and what he did for Cyrus, only to Arthur's disbelief. But once in the basement witnessing the attack of one of the ghosts set free upon his daughter (Shannon Elizabeth), Arthur's viewpoint turns around.The movie then revolves around the family's attempt to reunite and the attacks of the ghosts as they are each released periodically. As each one is turned loose, the real reason for their being gathered grows closer. And with the sudden appearance of an activist who attempts to set spirits free, Arthur, his family and Dennis discover the real meaning behind the ghosts and why they are here.The movie offers some spectacular special effects, using the most grotesque depictions of the ghosts to full effect. They pop up out of nowhere and attack, some character being able to seem them and others not, depending on who is or isn't wearing the glasses. But the attacks are real and the results of each are as well as we see the rips and tears brought upon those attacked.The movie offers a great background story to bring all of the pieces together and the fearful moments are done in a way that they add to that. And fright inducing is what they do. I don't suggest you watch this with your face too close to the screen.The actors all turn in fine performances, especially Lillard as the psychic who when touched feels visions and pain. Shaloub in pre-MONK form does a great job as a loving father. The rest are not the focal point, but do a great job as well.But more than anything, this movie is fun. And I had forgotten that since I first viewed it. It's like the ride through the spook house at the carnival, all noise and jump inducing scares, but thrilling anyway. And when the ride finishes, you feel glad that it's over but wanting to go around and get in line once more.There are few movies that I make a point of adding to my collection with the intent of watching over and over again. This is one movie that I could do that with and be entertained each and every time.",4,NOT SUCH AN UNLUCKY NUMBER,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,4885,"['are', 'often', 'times', 'when', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'fails', 'have', 'latest', 'hot', 'release', 'shelf', 'look', 'what', 'left', 'old', 'racks', 'begin', 'think', 'more', 'sense', 'go', 'home', 'pull', 'out', 'old', 'movie', 'watch', 'rather', 'dish', 'money', 'rent', 'something', 'night', 'found', 'predicament', 'other', 'night', 'negotiating', 'son', 'decided', 'pull', 'out', 'horror', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'while', 'THIR13TEN', 'GHOSTS.Now', 'barely', 'recall', 'seeing', 'original', 'film', 'bore', 'name', '60', 'when', 'saw', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'being', 'horror', 'fan', 'most', 'life', 'watched', 'film', 'expectations', 'discovered', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'offer', 'items', 'make', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'remember', 'had', 'horror', 'had', 'humor', 'had', 'suspense', 'had', 'touching', 'portion', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'horror', 'films', 'same', 'reason', 'ride', 'roller', 'coasters', 'Not', 'try', 'stimulate', 'heart', 'attack', 'close', 'watch', 'get', 'nerves', 'tad', 'shaken', 'up', 'feel', 'dampness', 'sweat', 'palms', 'feel', 'relief', 'what', 'have', 'just', 'witnessed', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'WE', 'had', 'go', 'through.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'easily', 'Cyrus', 'Kriticos', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'film', 'attempting', 'capture', 'violent', 'ghost', 'aid', 'psychic', 'Dennis', 'Rafkin', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'capture', 'several', 'men', 'involved', 'are', 'killed', 'Cyrus.Move', 'family', 'Arthur', 'Kriticos', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'Cyrus', 'nephew', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'nearly', 'everything', 'fire', 'including', 'late', 'wife', 'Living', 'best', 'can', 'Arthur', 'two', 'children', 'nanny', 'wake', 'one', 'morning', 'arrival', 'lawyer', 'recorded', 'message', 'laptop', 'Cyrus', 'left', 'Arthur', 'family', 'estate', 'will', 'family', 'check', 'out.They', 'arrive', 'find', 'unusual', 'house', 'made', 'glass', 'inscriptions', 'nearly', 'panel', 'glass', 'also', 'run', 'Dennis', 'pretending', 'be', 'employee', 'electric', 'company', 'enter', 'house', 'are', 'stunned', 'antiquities', 'as', 'well', 'sumptuousness', 'house.Dennis', 'down', 'basement', 'wearing', 'pair', 'glasses', 'enable', 'bearer', 'see', 'ghosts', 'have', 'been', 'captured', 'imprisoned', 'there', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'Cyrus', 'up', 'upstairs', 'warn', 'Arthur', 'help', 'get', 'family', 'house', 'too', 'late', 'Wheels', 'literally', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'when', 'lawyer', 'basement', 'first', 'trips', 'mechanism', 'up', 'house', 'large', 'machine', 'start', 'up', 'also', 'results', 'death', 'lawyer.Arthur', 'attempts', 'get', 'family', 'together', 'leave', 'discovers', 'house', 'now', 'sealed', 'also', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'put', 'where', 'told', 'now', 'off', 'searching', 'Dennis', 'who', 'what', 'did', 'Cyrus', 'only', 'Arthur', 'disbelief', 'once', 'basement', 'witnessing', 'attack', 'one', 'ghosts', 'set', 'free', 'daughter', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Arthur', 'viewpoint', 'around.The', 'movie', 'then', 'family', 'attempt', 'reunite', 'attacks', 'ghosts', 'are', 'released', 'periodically', 'one', 'turned', 'loose', 'real', 'reason', 'being', 'gathered', 'grows', 'closer', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'activist', 'who', 'set', 'spirits', 'free', 'Arthur', 'family', 'Dennis', 'discover', 'real', 'meaning', 'ghosts', 'why', 'are', 'here.The', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'special', 'effects', 'using', 'most', 'grotesque', 'depictions', 'ghosts', 'full', 'effect', 'pop', 'up', 'nowhere', 'attack', 'character', 'being', 'able', 'seem', 'others', 'not', 'depending', 'who', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'glasses', 'attacks', 'are', 'real', 'results', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'rips', 'tears', 'brought', 'attacked.The', 'movie', 'great', 'background', 'story', 'bring', 'pieces', 'together', 'fearful', 'moments', 'are', 'done', 'way', 'add', 'fright', 'inducing', 'what', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'watch', 'face', 'too', 'close', 'screen.The', 'actors', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'especially', 'Lillard', 'psychic', 'who', 'when', 'touched', 'feels', 'visions', 'pain', 'Shaloub', 'pre-MONK', 'form', 'great', 'job', 'loving', 'father', 'rest', 'are', 'not', 'focal', 'point', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'well.But', 'more', 'anything', 'movie', 'fun', 'had', 'forgotten', 'first', 'viewed', 'ride', 'spook', 'house', 'carnival', 'noise', 'jump', 'inducing', 'scares', 'thrilling', 'anyway', 'when', 'ride', 'finishes', 'feel', 'glad', 'over', 'wanting', 'go', 'around', 'get', 'line', 'once', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'make', 'point', 'adding', 'collection', 'intent', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'be', 'entertained', 'time']",Thirteen Ghosts

685714,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005UQ9W,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","This movie has just one thing going for it. It has one of the neatest, coolest, trickiest sets [much of it computer generated to be sure] I've seen in awhile. After doing a little investigating, I think I found out why. It seems first-time director Steve Beck used to be a director of visual effects at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. He is credited with working on `The Hunt for Red October', `The Abyss' and `Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade'. I can close my eyes and still see the set designs for those movies, so I assume Mr. Beck is a quite talented artist. '13 Ghosts' strongly suggests he should have stayed with visuals.The set I refer to is the house where the characters meet the ghosts. It's actually a huge machine built for the purpose of opening the gates of Hell. It's all steel and glass, pistons and pulleys, and elaborate revolving engines. This effect was enough for me to give the movie two stars instead of one.The plot and the dialog are inane, and the actors look pained, possibly because this kind of movie is where Once Promising Actors go to die. Earlier in their careers, I was impressed by Matthew Lillard, Shannon Elizabeth and Embeth Davidtz, not to mention F. Murray Abraham. From `Amadeus' to THIS? Hopefully, all the leads will be resurrected soon. The dreadful script and tepid acting, however, are not what make '13 Ghosts' so awful. After all, horror movies are in a cinematic world of their own. You can't fairly apply the standards of most other genres to most of them. [Note: The schlock director and promoter William Castle, who directed the original '13 Ghosts', also produced the remarkable ""Rosemary's Baby"", a true exception to the rule.]For a modern horror film to work, it needs to be one or more of the following things: It must be scary. It must be full of sick humor. It must successfully parody other horror movies. It must have a character we care about. It must have a memorable monster or fiend. It must have a sexy lead, most usually female, but sometimes male [""Interview With the Vampire""]. It must have a cool soundtrack.'13 Ghosts' is none of these things. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Come to think of it, the actors rarely appear to be actually IN or ON that fabulous set.

It literally scared the living daylights out of me! And the production design was absolutely AWESOME! The person(s) who designed the overall look of this film must have terrific imaginations. So much thought went into the design of the house, and it was amazing to watch.I was not expecting this film to be five stars. I was expecting another average horror film (which has to be said for the finale). There are similarities between this and Hellraiser, if you've ever seen it.I suppose the finale of this did not match up to the rest. As someone else has already pointed out, once you've seen the end of one haunted house/horror movie, then you've seen them all. So the ending didn't have a lot of thought put into it, unlike the rest of it. There's always something blowing up in these kind of movies these days!Out of the twelve ghosts, my favourite had to be the Angry Princess (Shawna Loyer). She was terrific, and it must have took a lot of courage to appear naked! The best scene was where she appeared in the bath of blood, and Shannon Elizabeth is bending over. The darting eyes are terrific, and add a lot to the character. Otherwise, I wasn't too keen on the rest of the ghosts. I would have liked to see how they came to be the way they were. Poor Shawna though, she had to be in makeup for 5 hours! She hasn't done much else apart from this, but I'll be surprised if she doesn't get grabbed for something else - she's stunning, and will no doubt get more films under her belt soon. There's a lot of people out there who have a slight obsession with her though! She's also a para-legal in training! Ooooh!Both Shannon Elizabeth and Matthew Lillard were great assets to this movie. Is it just me or is Matthew really cute?! Maybe it's just me, but he is! Hubba hubba. The two quibbles I have about this movie, is that there wasn't much development with the family (or maybe there was, but it slowed the film down?). You don't really see much of the family together as a whole, but the camera work with the family right at the start was cool! Just keep your ears open, and you'll work out what's happening. And my second quibble is about Matthew. In the film, he's psychic, and manages to 'see' what will happen to him. Which I thought wasn't fair. You'll have to watch the film to find out what happens, cos if I reveal anymore, Amazon will slap my wrist.This is a great movie, I loved it, and kind of makes up for Lost Highway!

So a good suggestion is to pay no attention to the critics and see the movie yourself, and then draw your own conclusion.  In my opinion, this was an awesome horror movie that keeps you guessing.For a horror movie, the story was very complex.  The directing and acting was really good in the movie.  Especially Matthew Lillard's performance.  There are enough creepy ghosts and surprises that will get you hooked in no time.  If you liked, &quot;House on Haunted Hill,&quot; chances are that you will enjoy this movie as well, being that it was produced by the same people.  The audio and visual effects were incredible, and made the movie that more impressive.  Although all the flashing lights might give you a little bit of a headache; small price to pay, if you ask me.  My only complaint is that I think the movie could've been a little more scarier at certain parts.  Other than that, I thought it was great.I'm not going to take the time to go over the movie's story, because you'll find out when you go see it.  The previews have been very careful about not giving anything away, so I will do the same.  Just know this; Poor family without a home + vengeful ghosts trapped in glass rooms in creepy mansion = one hell of a time!This movie was not as good as &quot;House on Haunted Hill,&quot; but it was still a quality horror movie.  It was certainly a hell of a lot better than those &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; movies.  Go ahead, and give the movie a try.

Okay maybe not the worst movie but still an extremly boring one. Honestly, I feel asleep for 5 minutes while waching this movie. Good actors is the only thing this movie has going for it. The actual acting isn't as good. But anyways thirteen ghosts is based on an uncle who is willing to let his brother and his kids live at his house filled with ghosts whom he is studying. It's based on a movie made a while back (can't remember what year) but that movie was supposedly a good movie (I've never seen it.) For most of my friends this movie did alot for them. But this movie did absolutley nothing for me - didnt scare, didnt have anything new or exciting. Maybe the old movie was better but the antics in this movie just bored me. Id rather watch a Paul Walker movie, yes you heard me right Paul Walker - one of the worst actors I've ever seen.If you want to laugh at supposed to be scary parts wondering if that part was supoosed to be scary, and if you want to fall asleep at the sametime then this is your movie.

685740,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,B00005UQ9W,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Some people seem to get a break in the face of tragedy, yet it seems to somehow go to hell anyway. In another release from Dark Castle illustrating that yes, life can and does suck, Arthur Kritico's on the edge trying to raise his two children after the death of his wife. Fate seems to feel badly for the poor guy, though, for soon afterwards a lawyer pops up on the widow's doorstep, telling him that his dear ol uncle has passed on and left him a mansion in his will. Naturally the family sees a better opportunity and moves in, annoying nanny in tow, only to find out that Uncle Cyrus wasn't the nicest kind of guy after all. He happened to be the kind that traps ghosts within glass walls of their new residence.When arriving the family is clearly and naturally baffled by the glass walls, the strange latin like scribblings, and the strange psychic they encounter. They soon discover their house has been triggered to open and spit out creepy ghosts at them...and that the machine was built by a madman determined to be filled with power through a pact with the devil himself. Since the houses mazes keep changing, it becomes locked, with children Kathy and Bobby lost inside. It's up to the adults to play a little game of 'rescue', but will they find the kids and all get to safety in time?Yes, the plot does sound cleverly wicked and almost 'cool', but sadly it disappointed me on so many levels it was nearly coma-inducing. I like to think of 13 ghosts as a failed opportunity that wasn't meant to be - with it's plot, it shouldn't have been overly difficult to create a film chocked full of eerie moments, trippy sequences, a rapid pace and a mind-bending plot that stood at as glaringly unique. What we ended with instead was something that's nice and shiny on the outside but pointless in the middle, kind of like being excited about a brightly wrapped Christmas present under the tree, only to find out there's only tacky clothes inside once opened. While the story itself sounds dazzling from description alone and the special effects are spectacular on some aspects, once it's peeled open you find out that once again you have been fooled by the glittery paper, gigantic dollar store bow and frilly ribbons.Before I start letting all the bad stuff out in the open, I'll concentrate on existing benefits first. One thing the flick did excel at was the creepy as hell ghosts. They weren't lax on the FX and makeup, and the spirits were menacing as hell and pure evil incarnate. One of my particular favorites was the dead princess - nude in all her glory, splattered with enough blood to make Carrie feel left out at the prom. They also dispensed with a few humans in semi-creative ways (The glass cutting scene anyone?) I know if I encountered one of these I'd drop dead of fight fast enough to make someone's head spin.The second thing that helped me wash down this bitter pill was the mediocre to sometimes good suspense built up at occasional opportune times. I loved the part of the teenager daughter, Kathy, in the bathroom with the prom queen from hell behind her in the mirror. Stuff like this almost made me enjoy the movies; it's just a shame that something with such easy potential fell so hard on its face. But hey, maybe that's what happens when you try to remake a William Castle flick?On the bad side of the table (and this takes up most of the room), the characters are generally despisable. The little ploy, played by Alec Roberts, tended to get on ones' nerves; seeing him get bitch slapped would have been comical and welcome relief. His sister, played by Shannon Elisabeth, did well enough but her character wasn't anything worth praising. I didn't latch on to her and didn't give a s*** what happened to her. Moving along...Matthew Lillard is  usually someone I can't stand, especially in Scream, but here he actually pulls his own weight and floats farther than most of the others. His dialogue was humorous and at least if Hollywood chose to exploit the comic card yet again, they did a decent job this time. Other dialogue, though, needed some tuning up. The nanny's character was unneeded, the family needed live-in help before moving to the mansion?? - and she irritated me to no end.Even though characterization sticks out like a hammered thumb, it wasn't even the main issue. The plot was. It held more holes than a large chunk of Swiss. It was obviously put together just to show off some nifty ghosts, quick deaths and cheap horror gimmicks. 13 Ghosts suffers from what many 90s and above films do - a chance to show off 'cool' effects and think it is enough to dazzle the audience into submission. They had to figure out a way somehow for the plot to 'fit' it . The ending didn't make much sense either and most of the movie, once played back, was paper thin.Yes, 13 Ghosts offers some superficial chills, fun jump scares, but nothing deep and nothing consistent. If you want a ghost story with an actual 'story' (God forbid), head in the other direction - fast! Watch this one only if you don't mind obvious plots for stereotyped audiences in order for Hollywood to cash in on yet another buck.",3,Good,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,5140,"['people', 'seem',

685742,A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B00005UQ9W,"Ravenskya ""Princess of Horror""","[1, 3]","So he already destroyed one of the greatest haunted house movies of all time ""House on Haunted Hill"". I was already upset that once again Steve Beck (The Director) was remaking another movie. How about we come up with something new here. Well needless to say I went into this film with no expectations what so ever, which turned out to be a good thing.The best scene of the film comes right at the beginning (So wait to get your popcorn until later into the film, just don't miss the opening) We begin in a Junkyard full of dangerous looking metal and sharply twisted vehicles. Here we meet Matthew Lillard as Rafkin (I know most of you hate him but I find him quite funny) a pill popping psychic who is one step from losing his last grasp of reality. He steps is in this god forsaken junkyard with F. Murray Abraham (Uncle Cyrus) an instantly dislikable character (Which means he's the bad guy) and about 50 other random people in bio suits. After the opening scene (which ii quite bloody and rather interesting) We discover that they are a bunch of Ghost Trappers and this is the 12th ghost they have trapped in one of these lovely glass boxes with writing all over it.End of really cool beginning (Go get popcorn now)Now we segue into a family scene, Tony Shalhaub plays Arthur the loving father of two, Shannon Elizabeth as Kathy, and Alec Roberts as Bobby. They are a poor family that has lost their mother. They have creditors calling but amazingly can afford to pay Maggie (Rah Digga the token ethnic woman in the movie) to be the nanny that doesn't seem to do anything.Well to sum up and not give too much away, they suddenly find out that they have inherited this huge house made entirely of glass (covered in the same writings as the ghost catcher in the first scene). Once the go in, surprise surprise they get locked in along with Lillard who posed as an electrician and Kalina (the token exposition character ""Oh your confused, let me pull out my handy book that explains the whole movie and sum up a few passages for you"")That's all of the story I'll go into. Now for my opinion of the movie:This is a tough one, the acting was flat, especially on the part of the family. Lillard gave his best ""I'm losing it"" attempt but the whole cast seemed to walk tiredly through the script. No one except Lillard seemed overly concerned with the fact that they could all be killed at any moment, and even he gave in at the promise of money.I have to admit, that this movie did entertain me... I was refreshed at the fact that the ghosts were made with makeup and not computer generated. The sets were brilliant and actually seemed to be the star of the film. The make up crew did go a little overboard with the ghost costumes, the one which is supposed to be a naked woman looked less real than a blow up doll. There was just way too much overzealousness to create ""Scary"" that made it look more campy than frightening.The storyline was filled with glaring plot holes and the infamous ""this is supposed to shock you"" plot twist that you will see coming from the first scene. The tension is built around the fact that the ghosts can only be seen through these special glasses that for some reason there is only enough for one person in the group to ever see the ghosts.Why is the movie a full 2 hours if these people are so outmatched by these terrifyingly evil ghosts? Because apparently you can see a ghost and if you slowly back away they will leave you alone. Also unless you trip you can out run them.Another disappointing part of the movie is the misuse of several of the ghosts who end up becoming random set pieces.So with the bad acting, campy looking ghosts, and typical holey script, is this movie worth watching? My answer is a big fat maybe. If you are in the mood for a campy horror flick that won't scare you too bad, then rent this on video, otherwise wait until it's on TV, watch the opening scene and leave it at that.Recommended:No",3,"Steve Beck Remakes another movie, leaving out the good parts",1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,3952,"['So', 'already', 'destroyed', 'one', 'greatest', 'haunted', 'house', 'movies', 'time', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'was', 'already', 'upset', 'once', 'again', 'Steve', 'Beck', 'Director', 'was', 'remaking', 'movie', 'How', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'here', 'Well', 'needless', 'say', 'went', 'film', 'expectations', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'thing.The', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'right', 'beginning', 'So', 'wait', 'get', 'popcorn', 'later', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'opening', 'begin', 'Junkyard', 'full', 'dangerous', 'looking', 'metal', 'sharply', 'twisted', 'vehicles', 'Here', 'meet', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Rafkin', 'know', 'most', 'hate', 'find', 'quite', 'funny', 'pill', 'popping', 'psychic', 'who', 'one', 'step', 'losing', 'last', 'grasp', 'reality', 'god', 'junkyard', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'Uncle', 'Cyrus', 'instantly', 'dislikable', 'character', 'Which', 'bad', 'guy', '50', 'other', 'random', 'people', 'bio', 'suits', 'opening', 'scene', 'quite', 'bloody', 'rather', 'interesting', 'discover', 'are', 'bunch', 'Ghost', 'Trappers', '12th', 'ghost', 'have', 'trapped', 'one', 'lovely', 'glass', 'boxes', 'writing', 'it.End', 'really', 'cool', 'beginning', 'Go', 'get', 'popcorn', 'now', 'Now', 'segue', 'family', 'scene', 'Tony', 'Shalhaub', 'Arthur', 'loving', 'father', 'two', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Kathy', 'Alec', 'Roberts', 'Bobby', 'are', 'poor', 'family', 'lost', 'mother', 'have', 'creditors', 'calling', 'amazingly', 'can', 'afford', 'pay', 'Maggie', 'Rah', 'Digga', 'token', 'ethnic', 'woman', 'movie', 'be', 'nanny', ""n't"", 'seem', 'do', 'anything.Well', 'sum', 'up', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'suddenly', 'find', 'out', 'have', 'inherited', 'huge', 'house', 'made', 'entirely', 'glass', 'covered', 'same', 'writings', 'ghost', 'catcher', 'first', 'scene', 'go', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'get', 'locked', 'Lillard', 'who', 'posed', 'electrician', 'Kalina', 'token', 'exposition', 'character', 'Oh', 'confused', 'let', 'pull', 'out', 'handy', 'book', 'whole', 'movie', 'sum', 'up', 'few', 'passages', 'story', ""'ll"", 'go', 'Now', 'opinion', 'movie', 'tough', 'one', 'acting', 'was', 'flat', 'especially', 'part', 'family', 'Lillard', 'gave', 'best', ""'m"", 'losing', 'attempt', 'whole', 'cast', 'seemed', 'walk', 'tiredly', 'script', 'one', 'Lillard', 'seemed', 'overly', 'concerned', 'fact', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'killed', 'moment', 'even', 'gave', 'promise', 'money.I', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'did', 'entertain', 'was', 'refreshed', 'fact', 'ghosts', 'were', 'made', 'makeup', 'not', 'computer', 'generated', 'sets', 'were', 'brilliant', 'actually', 'seemed', 'be', 'star', 'film', 'make', 'up', 'crew', 'did', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'ghost', 'costumes', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'naked', 'woman', 'looked', 'less', 'real', 'blow', 'up', 'doll', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'overzealousness', 'create', 'Scary', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'campy', 'frightening.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'filled', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'infamous', 'supposed', 'shock', 'plot', 'twist', 'will', 'see', 'coming', 'first', 'scene', 'tension', 'built', 'fact', 'ghosts', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'special', 'glasses', 'reason', 'only', 'enough', 'one', 'person', 'group', 'ever', 'see', 'ghosts.Why', 'movie', 'full', '2', 'hours', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'outmatched', 'terrifyingly', 'evil', 'ghosts', 'apparently', 'can', 'see', 'ghost', 'slowly', 'back', 'away', 'will', 'leave', 'alone', 'Also', 'trip', 'can', 'out', 'run', 'them.Another', 'disappointing', 'part', 'movie', 'misuse', 'several', 'ghosts', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'random', 'set', 'pieces.So', 'bad', 'acting', 'campy', 'looking', 'ghosts', 'typical', 'holey', 'script', 'movie', 'watching', 'answer', 'big', 'fat', 'maybe', 'are', 'mood', 'campy', 'horror', 'flick', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scare', 'too', 'bad', 'then', 'rent', 'video', 'otherwise', 'wait', 'TV', 'watch', 'opening', 'scene', 'leave', 'that.Recommended']",Thirteen Ghosts

685744,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005UQ9W,Reviewer,"[1, 1]","There's nothing like a good ghost story to get the juices flowing, and not one that merely opens a creaky closet door and says, ""Boo!"" but one that grabs! you by the nape of the neck and commands your attention with a bona fide scare.  Unfortunately, such films are few and far between, and though ""Thir13en Ghosts,"" directed by Steve Beck, is perhaps not the ""Grand Guignol"" it aspires to be, it is nevertheless a valiant attempt and will do in a pinch.  And it does have the added bonus of having something of a unique twist to it:  Whereas most stories dealing with supernatural apparitions are the result of chance encounters or happenstance, even those set within the tried and true venue of the ""haunted house,"" the spirits confronted here do not arise from accident, but by design.  The burning question becomes, of course, by whose design and for what purpose?  Ah, but therein lies our story, eh?In the film's prologue, we are introduced to one Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham), a man of obvious wealth and means who has apparently made it his life's work to capture the disenfranchised spirits of those who have died a violent death, encasing them in holding cubes made of impenetrable glass.  But before the opening credits have ended, Cyrus falls victim to one of his intended trophies, a particularly rambunctious soul who apparently doesn't take kindly to the idea of being kept in a cage.Upon the passing of Cyrus Kriticos, his entire estate-- which is rather substantial-- is bequeathed to his nephew, Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub), a math teacher currently in the throes of some personal travails, who barely knew his uncle and had, in fact, only met him once or twice in his life.  As often happens in life, however, it is from this least expected source that Arthur seemingly finds the solution to his problems, for his inheritance, which includes a rather unique mansion-- albeit in a remote area-- insures his solvency for the rest of his life.  But upon entering this singular house left behind by Cyrus, Arthur's life and that of his family is about to change in ways he could never dream of, none of which are not good, and all of which have to do with something Cyrus left in the basement.  And just like that, with the flapping of the butterfly's wings in China, a tidal wave is about to hit shore a continent away.Working from a screenplay by Neal Stevens and Richard D'Ovidio (from a story by Robb White), Beck has crafted and delivered a less than compelling film that has it's moments, but relies primarily on the special F/X for the impact it's attempting to make.  The film has it's moments, but to put it into perspective using the one hundred floor ""Haunted House Spooky/scary"" scale, it checks in on about the fiftieth floor, just a couple below ""The House on Haunted Hill"" (1999).  ""The Others"" (2001), meanwhile, currently occupies the penthouse, while the dreary ""The Haunting"" (1999) is, and will forever languish in, the basement.The ghosts here are disconcertingly gruesome, though some of them tend to be a bit over the top; a few of them appear to be the product of a mad designer who should have had his sketching crayon taken away from him sooner.  A few less spikes, bolts, piercings and protrusions would have made them more convincing; as it is, they don't have enough ""humanity"" left in them to be credible as formerly living beings.  It's a good case for the ""less is more"" theory, in fact.  The real interest in this film is the house itself, which is perhaps the most unique design in the annals of the cinematic haunted house.  With it's glass walls filled with Latin inscriptions and it's ability to alter itself into a claustrophobic maze at will, it is actually more jarring and shocking than the otherworldly denizens it houses in it's subterranean recesses.  Arguably, it can be said that the house is, in point of fact, the star of the movie.  And Beck does use it to good effect.The real star, however, is Tony Shalhoub, as the unwary nephew, Arthur.  Shalhoub has emerged as one of the finest character actors in the business, and even if the character he is playing is a rather straight forward, ""normal"" every day type, which is basically who Arthur is, nobody does it better.  What makes him so good is that he has the ability and talent to make whatever character he's portraying believable and convincing, whether it's an alien in ""Men In Black,"" a street prophet in ""Life or Something Like it"" or your run-of-the-mill generic math teacher.  He works from the inside out, which gives his characters depth and nuance; deep down Shalhoub IS that person, before he-- whomever it is-- ever makes a physical appearance.  And THAT is good acting.After Shalhoub, however, there's nothing much of note here, performance wise.  Abraham does a good turn as Cyrus, but his role is little more than a glorified cameo with little room for character development, and even though what he does is good, there's no getting around the fact that early on his Cyrus falls into stereotype.Matthew Lillard does a quirky turn as Dennis, but looking at him for any length of time can be distracting; Shannon Elizabeth, as Arthur's daughter, Kathy, is too pert and perky to be effective, with a perpetual smile that would be more fitting in a toothpaste commercial or ""Starship Troopers 2"" than here; Embeth Davidtz (Kalina) is simply underused; young Alec Roberts (Bobby) is annoying; and making her acting debut, Rah Digga (better known as the ""female"" MC and only woman in Busta Rhymes' renowned Flip Mode Squad), as the nanny, Maggie, leaves a lot to be desired, which pretty much sums up ""Thir13en Ghosts.""  This one, as they say, is close-- but no cigar.  There's just not enough magic.",2,"Falls A Bit Short, But the House Is Fun",1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,5737,"['nothing', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'get', 'juices', 'flowing', 'not', 'one', 'merely',

Though it starts off a little confusing as to what exactly the premise is, the movie explains it all in time and takes you on a rollercoaster ride of a excellent horror movie.  Tony Shalhoub, from USA/ABC's Monk fame, plays the hero of this highly entertaining and sometime graphic film.  He stars with Shannon Elizabeth and Matthew Lillard as they try to stop the ghosts and save their lives.  Twelve ghosts have been captured by the evil Uncle Sirius, who has since died and left his evil house of horrors to his nephew, Shalhoub, and his family.  The family gets to the house and the fun starts almost immediately as one by one the ghosts are let out of their cages and want revenge on anybody in anyway.  And these ghosts mean business!!  Thirteen Ghosts has the perfect mix of storyline and gore.  Amazing that a horror movie could have both, but it works well and keeps you glued to your seat.

685746,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B00005UQ9W,Richard Ross,"[1, 3]","Ghost hunter Cyrus Kriticos (F.Murray Abraham) is on a mission to capture the souls of 13 ghosts so that he can unleash a hellish power on Earth. With the assistance of a psychic named Dennis (Matthew Lillard), Cyrus catches 12 souls before being killed on a hunt. Cyrus's nephew Arthur (Tony Shaloub) is a widower with two kids (Shannon Elizabeth plays the oldest) and a housekeeper (Rah Digga) to support. In financial trouble and in risk of being evicted from his apartment Arthur gets some much needed relief when a lawyer representing Cyrus's estate shows up at his door.  He informs Arthur that he is the inheritor of his uncle's mansion. The mansion is a spectacular structure made out of glass that Arthur and his family are all too eager to move into. The only problem is that they also inherit the 12 souls that Cyrus captured. Dennis is also there looking for the money Cyrus owed him and together he and Arthur learn that there is a 13th ghost and only Arthur can catch him. This is the second Dark Castle (a film company created by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis that re-imagines the 50's and 60's horror films of director William Castle for modern audiences) film after 'House On Haunted Hill'. Both films start off very promising establishing a creepy vibe and the promise of genuine scares  before tripping over complicated plot twists that cause the film to be boring and not frightening. This film starts off great beginning in an abandoned junkyard then moving to Arthur's claustrophobic apartment before finally settling in the mansion. There are some wonderfully ominous shots in the beginning but eventually overt gore wins out over any subtlety. The ghosts are definitely disturbing and horrific but they weren't utilized like they should have been. The explanation as to why Arthur is the only man capable of capturing the last ghost is a nice touch and at least provides one unexpected surprise. Shannon Elizabeth factors in the beginning but is absent during the middle act only to reappear in the film's final act. This lets Matthew Lillard, from 'Scream', steal the show. He sells every scene he's in with hyper energy and some good physical comedy. It's a disappointing horror film because it looks like it's going to be fun and scary but is actually little more than a standard gorefest.",2,Unlucky '13',1254355200,"10 1, 2009",2009,2318,"['Ghost', 'hunter', 'Cyrus', 'Kriticos', 'F.Murray', 'Abraham', 'mission', 'capture', 'souls', '13', 'ghosts', 'so', 'can', 'unleash', 'hellish', 'power', 'Earth', 'assistance', 'psychic', 'named', 'Dennis', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'Cyrus', '12', 'souls', 'being', 'killed', 'hunt', 'Cyrus', 'nephew', 'Arthur', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'widower', 'two', 'kids', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'oldest', 'housekeeper', 'Rah', 'Digga', 'support', 'financial', 'trouble', 'risk', 'being', 'evicted', 'apartment', 'Arthur', 'much', 'needed', 'relief', 'when', 'lawyer', 'representing', 'Cyrus', 'estate', 'up', 'door', 'Arthur', 'inheritor', 'uncle', 'mansion', 'mansion', 'spectacular', 'structure', 'made', 'glass', 'Arthur', 'family', 'are', 'too', 'eager', 'move', 'only', 'problem', 'also', 'inherit', '12', 'souls', 'Cyrus', 'captured', 'Dennis', 'also', 'looking', 'money', 'Cyrus', 'owed', 'together', 'Arthur', 'learn', '13th', 'ghost', 'only', 'Arthur', 'can', 'catch', 'second', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'film', 'company', 'created', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', '50', '60', 'horror', 'films', 'director', 'William', 'Castle', 'modern', 'audiences', 'film', ""'House"", 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'films', 'start', 'off', 'very', 'promising', 'establishing', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'promise', 'genuine', 'scares', 'tripping', 'over', 'complicated', 'plot', 'twists', 'cause', 'film', 'be', 'boring', 'not', 'frightening', 'film', 'great', 'beginning', 'abandoned', 'junkyard', 'then', 'moving', 'Arthur', 'claustrophobic', 'apartment', 'finally', 'settling', 'mansion', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'ominous', 'shots', 'beginning', 'eventually', 'overt', 'gore', 'out', 'subtlety', 'ghosts', 'are', 'definitely', 'disturbing', 'horrific', 'were', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'explanation', 'why', 'Arthur', 'only', 'man', 'capable', 'capturing', 'last', 'ghost', 'nice', 'touch', 'least', 'one', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'factors', 'beginning', 'absent', 'middle', 'act', 'only', 'reappear', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', ""'Scream"", 'steal', 'show', 'scene', 'hyper', 'energy', 'good', 'physical', 'comedy', 'disappointing', 'horror', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'fun', 'scary', 'actually', 'little', 'more', 'standard', 'gorefest']",Thirteen Ghosts

1960 version.House on Haunted Hill,another Castle film,was also remade but compared to this,I thought it weak.This one does not start out as strong as it could have,but once the action focuses in on the house,it really takes off.The story opens as an eccentric Abraham,is trying to capture a ghost in a wreckers yard,of all places,with his psychic assistant Lillard.They end up with their prey but at a high cost of lives,including Abraham's.The scene next switches to widower Shaloub,who lives with his two children and nanny.They get notified that Shaloub's uncle,Abraham,has died and he has inherited his mansion.They drive out and it is a spectacular looking affair,filled with glass panels throughout,and all with Latin writing and symbols emblazoned on them.As the lawyer familiarizes them with their new home,a knock on the door reveals Lillard.He comes under a guise which is short lived,and he informs them all of the ghosts that live in the various paneled rooms of the house.The lawyer activates a switch which seals the house and starts the familie's ""adventures"".Shaloub's young son gets away from his nanny and he is the first to encounter a ghost.Slowly but surely the rest end up  wearing special glasses that enable then to clearly see the ghosts.All of the spirits have names and apparently,according to Lillard,the Jackal has been released and they are all in grave danger.The house periodically shifts due to a giant mechanism within its center,and panels that at one moment are open,now close,and visa versa.This unleashes new ghost after new ghost.The family searches for Shaloub's son but instead end up finding Abraham,still alive.They learn that he has both of Shaloub's children hostage,and that in order to save them he must sacrifice himself to become the 13th ghost.Shaloub enters a room with deadly rotating rings which surround his children at regular intervals.Standing in a circle around the mechanism are the 12 ghosts of the house.Shaloub manages to safely jump to his kids in safety while the machine,with the help of the nanny,comes flying apart.The ghosts are all released from bondage and Shaloub's long deceased wife,who was one of the ghosts,appears and tells them she loves them.The opening for the film in the auto wreckers yard,fell back on your traditional kind of gore for gore's sake....just shock value.However,the film gets smart as the scene switches to Shaloub and his family and their visit to his uncle's home.From then on it becomes a really scary affair as these different ghosts,of all shapes and types,begin to appear one after the other,some becoming super deadly.The S/FX are excellent and add to the eery atmosphere.Shaloub does a good job going from the typical and loving father,skeptical of Lillard's words,until finally reluctantly believing what he sees.Actually a good job is done by all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,tricky excess club reel,a featurette,a look at all the ghosts and enhanced content.All in all a very decent scary film,with a solid and believable cast.The film starts off weakly but gains considerable ground thereafter.3 1/2-4 stars.",4,12+1=Scary!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,3337,"['13', 'Ghosts', 'released', 'Oct/01', 'stars', 'others', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Matthew', 'Lillard',

That's enough movies with numbers substituting for letters in the title, all right?Just based on that, I was prepared to crucify this movie. The title screams out ""we're doing a remake, and we want to make it... hip."" Gah. The first thing you must do when watching this film is forget that William Castle made a movie called Thirteen Ghosts. Despite Beck saying in the DVD extras that they did use the original script and just change it a bit, the two look about as much alike as do Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. Consider them two entirely different movies.Once you do that (and get by the soundtrack, which is simply nauseating), this is actually a fun little movie. While it succeeds only in minor ways in being creepy (it's certainly not in the same league as The Eye), the effects are well-done enough that it does succeed in a few places.Arthur Kriticos (Tony Shalhoub, of Monk fame) is a pretty depressed guy. His wife Jean (Kathryn Anderson, a stuntwoman by trade) was killed in a fire six months ago, his kids Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie) and Bobby (Alec Roberts, recently of Traffic) are driving him crazy, the nanny (the annoyingly named Rah Digga in her screen debut) isn't helping matters, and they're broke. Or so they think. The youngest lawyer on the planet, Moss (JR Bourne, doing better here than in Aftershock-honest), shows up to let Arthur and family know that Arthur's eccentric uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham) has died, and left Arthur and crew his rather odd house. And a couple of Cyrus' business partners, Dennis (Matthew ""Shaggy"" Lillard) and Kalina (Embeth ""Ash's Girlfriend"" Davidtz), though none of them knows that yet...You never know what you're going to get from a movie containing Matthew Lillard, and this one is no exception. His performance is strong, but that may only be because the rest of the performances by the main characters here are so weak. F. Murray Abraham is convincing as the epitome of evil in the long opening scene, but other than that, the movie almost begs you to concentrate on the house and the ghosts instead of the plot.When you do that, this movie becomes everything the miserable The Haunting (Jan de Bont, 1999) was not. The architecture is gorgeous, the ghosts are nasty-looking and deeply disturbing (and a few, most notably Shawna Loyer, have gained their own fan clubs). And really, it's a horror film. How much depth of plot do you want? The main actors are capable, and that's really all that's required for a movie of this caliber. It's standard Hollywood fare. And admit it, you want the house.Much of the reason the ghosts are so much fun in this movie, according to the extras, is that the ghosts all had full backstories written for them. One wonders if we'll end up getting movies about them. (Seems the production company would be remiss not to at least make one about the Angry Princess-and more of a naked Shawna Loyer could not be a bad thing-but I want to know about the Jackal...)Good, for what it is. ***",3,"You WROTE the backstories, why not FILM them?",1072051200,"12 22, 2003",2003,3104,"['Thir13en', 'Ghosts', 'Steve', 'Beck', '2001', 'Hey', 'Hollywood', 'Listen', 'up', 'Se7en', 'got', 'away', 'enough', 'movies', 'numbers', 'substituting', 'letters', 'title', 'right', 'Just', 'based', 'was', 'prepared', 'crucify', 'movie', 'title', 'out', ""'re"", 'doing', 'remake', 'want', 'make', 'hip', 'Gah', 'first', 'thing', 'must', 'do', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'forget', 'William', 'Castle', 'made', 'movie', 'called', 'Thirteen', 'Ghosts', 'Beck', 'saying', 'DVD', 'extras', 'did', 'use', 'original', 'script', 'just', 'change', 'bit', 'two', 'look', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Twins', 'Consider', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'movies.Once', 'do', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'simply', 'nauseating', 'actually', 'fun', 'little', 'movie', 'only', 'minor', 'ways', 'being', 'creepy', 'certainly', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Eye', 'effects', 'are', 'well-done', 'enough', 'succeed', 'few', 'places.Arthur', 'Kriticos', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Monk', 'fame', 'pretty', 'depressed', 'guy', 'wife', 'Jean', 'Kathryn', 'Anderson', 'stuntwoman', 'trade', 'was', 'killed', 'fire', 'six', 'months', 'ago', 'kids', 'Kathy', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'American', 'Pie', 'Bobby', 'Alec', 'Roberts', 'recently', 'Traffic', 'are', 'driving', 'crazy', 'nanny', 'annoyingly', 'named', 'Rah', 'Digga', 'screen', 'debut', ""n't"", 'helping', 'matters', ""'re"", 'broke', 'so', 'think', 'youngest', 'lawyer', 'planet', 'Moss', 'JR', 'Bourne', 'doing', 'better', 'here', 'Aftershock-honest', 'up', 'let', 'Arthur', 'family', 'know', 'Arthur', 'eccentric', 'uncle', 'Cyrus', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'died', 'left', 'Arthur', 'crew', 'rather', 'odd', 'house', 'couple', 'Cyrus', 'business', 'partners', 'Dennis', 'Matthew', 'Shaggy', 'Lillard', 'Kalina', 'Embeth', 'Ash', 'Girlfriend', 'Davidtz', 'none', 'yet', 'never', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'movie', 'containing', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'one', 'exception', 'performance', 'strong', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'rest', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'so', 'weak', 'F.', 'Murray', 'Abraham', 'convincing', 'epitome', 'evil', 'long', 'opening', 'scene', 'other', 'movie', 'almost', 'concentrate', 'house', 'ghosts', 'instead', 'plot.When', 'do', 'movie', 'everything', 'miserable', 'Haunting', 'Jan', 'de', 'Bont', '1999', 'was', 'not', 'architecture', 'gorgeous', 'ghosts', 'are', 'nasty-looking', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'few', 'most', 'notably', 'Shawna', 'Loyer', 'have', 'gained', 'own', 'fan', 'clubs', 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'How', 'much', 'depth', 'plot', 'do', 'want', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'capable', 'really', 'required', 'movie', 'caliber', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'admit', 'want', 'house.Much', 'reason', 'ghosts', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'movie', 'according', 'extras', 'ghosts', 'had', 'full', 'backstories', 'written', 'One', 'wonders', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'movies', 'Seems', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'not', 'least', 'make', 'one', 'Angry', 'Princess-and', 'more', 'naked', 'Shawna', 'Loyer', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'thing-but', 'want', 'know', 'Jackal', 'Good', 'what', '***']",Thirteen Ghosts

The story is nothing special as is the acting but the concept of a glass house haunted by 13 ghosts is very good with cool special effects (I haven't seen the original Thirteen Ghosts). The suspense levels are fairly high and the frights come from the look of the ghosts.

685767,A3GGMPRYCQ87CY,B00005UQ9W,The Cool Guy,"[1, 3]","With great pacing, an incredible plot, and clever, well-thought dialogue, you would think this movie would be very good. But somehow, it never quite comes together. I think it comes down to the odd casting choices.The film is a pseudo-documentary revolving around the great actor and country music legend, Billy Ray Cyrus, played by F. Murray Abraham. This itself was an eyebrow-raising decision, but I went along with it. Until about midway through, where F. Murray breaks out into ""Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart."" I'm sorry, but the movie lost me right there.The movie also had Antonio from ""Wings"", being moody a lot. Very moodful. Other members of the cast included a hotter, sexier version of Patricia Heaton from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", starring as a vampire killer / ghost hunter, something like that... Heck, I don't know. All I know is she was really hot. And when she met her fateful end ***WARNING: JUST DID A SPOILER, SORRY*** I was very sad to see it.The deadbeat dad - I mean downbeat dad - had two offspring on the show. One was your regular superhot supermodel daughter, which of course, most families have at least one of. She was very enthusiastic over the new house. Way more enthusiastic than the creepy situation warranted, IMAO. The other was the annoying little kid, which is pretty much required in this type of movie. His main job was to get lost and/or into trouble all the time. The kid also had an extreme obsession with death, which again, is a personality quirk that is very typical of most 8 year olds.The film also had the great actor Creepy Lawyer Guy, starring as ""Creepy Lawyer Guy"". It also featured a goofy sidekick, for comic relief. Who also happened to be psychic. Wow, a silly psychic sidekick! Now say that five times fast.Last but by no means least, the film starred some random black woman, fulfilling the role of ""Generic Stereotypical Black Woman"". Later in the movie, she even does the patented ""Black Woman Freak Out"", complete with raising her hands in the air and muttering to herself about ""all these crazy white folks"". I think this was intended to be very funny. Intended to be. I think.As for scariness, pretty much the scariest thing in the movie was the Menacing CGI gears. Which spun... A lot. And rotated... A lot. And then did it again! Oooh. It would have been more scary perhaps if Miley Cyrus had showed up, but that never happened. (In hindsight, maybe that's okay. She is pretty scary all on her own.)Oh, there was one other thing that was supposed to be pretty scary, and that was a cut-up woman ghost. But the scariness factor was kind of lost on me, because I kept pausing it to look at her boobs. (Thank God for Blu-ray and HD.) I mean seriously, that ghost had a great rack. But I had to wonder how real they were, because all the cuts would have to indicate some rubber latex bodysuit or something. So in the end, disappointment.As far as plot goes (as if you care), all of the ghost-busting shenanigans center around unleashing the ""Ocularist Infernum"", or ""Eye of Hell"". I take it this is a bad thing. The movie never really says. Which is a bit frustrating, because it explains everything else. In endless, coma-inducing detail... But I guess it's safe to assume that this grisly fate - should it come to pass - would result in a massive outbreak of red, itchy eyes. Which would be good for eyedrop sales, but bad for mankind in general. Especially in parts of the world where they can't afford eyedrops.So in the end, great movie! Take your wife, take your kids. Especially if they've never seen a black person, so you can show them how black people act in real life. (Those darn black people! They just crack me up.)

685777,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005UQ9W,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","OK, here again.  Willaim Castle remake.  The second outing from film campany Dark Castle Enterainment (Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis) is based on the film made in 1960, but with special effects and elabolate production designs in place of William Castle's now legendary ""gimmick.""  (If you don't know Castle, see Joe Dante's film ""Matinee"" whose John Goodman character is loosely based on him.)  But like ""House on the Haunted Hill"" the result is not impressive, sporadically scary but ultimately boring.Yes, sorry, but I am bored.  The story is, as with all Castle's films, intriguing.  A father named Arther (Tony Shalhoub) inherits a house from his long-absent uncle Cyrus (F. Murry Abraham).  But the house, of which walls are all made of transparent glass, has a deadly secret -- it keeps a collection of ghosts!  Now Arthur and his family, moving into the haunted house, are to experience most uncomfortable night ever seen.This simple premise is always the strength of the first-rate entertainer Willaim Castle's virtue, and though his films are sometimes based on too incredible setup, he knew how to amuse us, with his well-known gimmicks (like ""Emergo Vision"").  He used for the original a gimmick called ""Illusion-O"" -- the audience wear a pair of special glasses that enable the ghosts on the screen to appear or to vanish, according to the scenes.In the remake, the idea is extended (or borrowed), and the characters can see ghosts (!) provided when they wear special glasses.  That's a good idea, though the director Steve Beck (first-time feature director, previously responsible for special effect art design) ruined it by ... you know what.  Too fast changes of cut, cut, cut ... a train of flashing images of ghosts showing up and suddenly vanishing ....  Watching these scenes is really trying, I warn you, and my eyes started to get weary soon.  And first of all, Matthew Lillard appears as a psychic who can ""see"" or feel the ghosts.  So, what's the point of introducing him while all you can do to see those horrid ghosts is to wear that device?The film is full of such inconsistency as would destroy any suspence -- Embeth Davidtz pops up suddenly in the house where every one is supposed to be trapped within.  Asked by the scared inhabitants how come she made it to the inside, she gives an awkward explanation: in short, she happened to find a door open, but sorry, it is closed now!  Great.  Well, the truth will be revealed after all, but those inept dialogues or situations are all working against the film's total result.The house in case impresses us, with its costly designs, but as the inside layout is not clear, we don't grasp the sense of confined place even after the ghosts are at large.  The sense of thrill is weakened by its so confused presentation of the structure of the house, that we don't know these ghosts are coming or going, behind the glass panel or not.  In this way, things look all in confusion while the story is also muddled.  Soon we lose what little interest we had.Tony Shalhaub is good, as always, and Abraham is standard Abraham, so that's ok.  Shannon Elizabeth (goodlooking foregin student in ""American Pie"" and its esequel) is not bad, Davidts is literally wasted, but most lamentable is Lillard, who is so good in ""Scooby-Doo,"" but here he single-handedly blows up the film with too hammy acting.When I saw this film in theater in Kyoto, before that feature presentation we had a chance to see the trailer of ""Jason X.""  Frankly, I thought that trailer is more interesting than this one.  Perhaps, all of us shared the thought.",2,More Boring Than Scary: Another Messy Willaim Castle Remake,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",2002,3594,"['OK', 'here', 'again', 'Willaim', 'Castle', 'remake', 'second', 'outing', 'film', 'campany', 'Dark', 'Castle', 'Enterainment', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'based', 'film', 'made', '1960', 'special', 'effects', 'elabolate', 'production', 'designs', 'place', 'William', 'Castle', 'now', 'legendary', 'gimmick', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Castle', 'see', 'Joe', 'Dante', 'film', 'Matinee', 'John', 'Goodman', 'character', 'loosely', 'based', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'result', 'not', 'impressive', 'sporadically', 'scary', 'ultimately', 'boring.Yes', 'sorry', 'am', 'bored', 'story', 'Castle', 'films', 'intriguing', 'father', 'named', 'Arther', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'house', 'long-absent', 'uncle', 'Cyrus', 'F.', 'Murry', 'Abraham', 'house', 'walls', 'are', 'made', 'transparent', 'glass', 'deadly', 'secret', 'collection', 'ghosts', 'Now', 'Arthur', 'family', 'moving', 'haunted', 'house', 'are', 'experience', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'night', 'ever', 'seen.This', 'simple', 'premise', 'always', 'strength', 'first-rate', 'entertainer', 'Willaim', 'Castle', 'virtue', 'films', 'are', 'sometimes', 'based', 'too', 'incredible', 'setup', 'knew', 'how', 'amuse', 'well-known', 'gimmicks', 'Emergo', 'Vision', 'used', 'original', 'gimmick', 'called', 'Illusion-O', 'audience', 'wear', 'pair', 'special', 'glasses', 'enable', 'ghosts', 'screen', 'appear', 'vanish', 'according', 'scenes.In', 'remake', 'idea', 'extended', 'borrowed', 'characters', 'can', 'see', 'ghosts', 'provided', 'when', 'wear', 'special', 'glasses', 'good', 'idea', 'director', 'Steve', 'Beck', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'previously', 'responsible', 'special', 'effect', 'art', 'design', 'ruined', 'know', 'what', 'Too', 'fast', 'changes', 'cut', 'cut', 'cut', 'train', 'flashing', 'images', 'ghosts', 'showing', 'up', 'suddenly', 'vanishing', 'Watching', 'scenes', 'really', 'trying', 'warn', 'eyes', 'started', 'get', 'weary', 'soon', 'first', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'psychic', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'feel', 'ghosts', 'So', 'what', 'point', 'introducing', 'can', 'do', 'see', 'horrid', 'ghosts', 'wear', 'device', 'film', 'full', 'such', 'inconsistency', 'would', 'destroy', 'suspence', 'Embeth', 'Davidtz', 'up', 'suddenly', 'house', 'where', 'one', 'supposed', 'be', 'trapped', 'Asked', 'scared', 'inhabitants', 'how', 'come', 'made', 'inside', 'awkward', 'explanation', 'short', 'happened', 'find', 'door', 'open', 'sorry', 'closed', 'now', 'Great', 'Well', 'truth', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'inept', 'dialogues', 'situations', 'are', 'working', 'film', 'total', 'result.The', 'house', 'case', 'impresses', 'costly', 'designs', 'inside', 'layout', 'not', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'sense', 'confined', 'place', 'even', 'ghosts', 'are', 'large', 'sense', 'thrill', 'weakened', 'so', 'confused', 'presentation', 'structure', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ghosts', 'are', 'coming', 'going', 'glass', 'panel', 'not', 'way', 'things', 'look', 'confusion', 'story', 'also', 'muddled', 'Soon', 'lose', 'what', 'little', 'interest', 'had.Tony', 'Shalhaub', 'good', 'always', 'Abraham', 'standard', 'Abraham', 'ok.', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'goodlooking', 'foregin', 'student', 'American', 'Pie', 'esequel', 'not', 'bad', 'Davidts', 'literally', 'wasted', 'most', 'lamentable', 'Lillard', 'who', 'so', 'good', 'Scooby-Doo', 'here', 'single-handedly', 'up', 'film', 'too', 'hammy', 'acting.When', 'saw', 'film', 'theater', 'Kyoto', 'feature', 'presentation', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'trailer', 'Jason', 'X', 'Frankly', 'thought', 'trailer', 'more', 'interesting', 'one', 'Perhaps', 'shared', 'thought']",Thirteen Ghosts

It's telling when an R-rated movie introduces 2 (vapid and annoying, this is no POLTERGEIST) child characters and then conveniently gets rid of them for most of the middle of the story. The kids act as though they are in a G-rated movie, and, similarly, bumbling Tony Shaloub seems to think he's in Disney's HAUNTED MANSION and not an R-rated scare-fest. And there's a PLETHORA of plot-holes which, unlike the doorways of the house in the story, never close, even temporarily. I can ignore ""off"" aspects if the rest of a movie really works but here it's all just too distracting and confusing to turn a blind eye to. Yes, the house is interesting, but it, and the ghosts, quickly become little more than video-game-type obstacles. For the gore-fan, though, there are one or 2 neat ""kills"". One in particular is astoundingly horrible and well-executed. Much obvious care was put into the sets, and I've gotta applaud the minimal use of CGI. However, I don't care about the characters or miss them when they're gone. Plot/motivation revelations in the final quarter are ridiculous and absolutely impossible to swallow. And, as usual with these Hollywood special-effects features, it all goes infuriatingly and unnecessarily pear-shaped in the final reel. Another ball-of-fire resolution.

This was the case for example with ""Ghost Ship"" and ""The House on Haunted Hill"", two other remakes by the Dark Castle Production Company.  I was therefore quite disappointed at just how bad Thirteen Ghosts was.  Thirteen Ghosts is a remake of a William Castle picture by the same title.  The plot (such that it is) centers around a widower's  family who inherits a haunted house.  The house is haunted by the ghosts of thirteen tortured souls that were collected by the previous owner.  The ghosts are kept in place by a series of spells that create a barrier that they can't cross.  The catch is that these spells are written on the glass walls of the house.  The position of the walls is constantly changed by a series of moving gears within the house, thus changing the boundaries by which the ghosts are held.  The ghosts, which can only be seen by special glasses, are quite scary looking.  They remind me of Clive Barker's ""Tortured Souls"" figures.  Unfortunately the ghost visuals can not save the movie from poor dialog, lack of plot, and uninteresting characters.  There are several scenes that will make you jump, and the gore factor is fairly high, but I would not say the movie is particularly scary.  After a while it just gets tedious.
