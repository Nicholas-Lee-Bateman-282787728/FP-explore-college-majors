If you understand that Ashtanga includes a very difficult, set series of poses and would like to get off to a careful and serious start, this is terrific.  If you know you'll never be able to do the Ashtanga Primary Series, but would like to do what you can, this is a great DVD.  It only includes the two Sun Salutations, building them up bit by bit.  Each one is 20-25 minutes long, repeating the salutation by steps until it is complete.This DVD will let you get a solid footing in the salutations.  If you know them cold, you could probably skip to Nicki's other beginner's video.The additional features are well worth watching.  The sample of the full Ashtanga program is amazing, and the interview makes Nicki Doane very accessible.  I love her straightforward, to the point tone.",5,Best Ashtanga instruction I can imagine,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,850,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Ashtanga', 'Yoga', 'not', 'DVD', 'understand', 'Ashtanga', 'very', 'difficult', 'set', 'series', 'poses', 'would', 'like', 'get', 'off', 'careful', 'serious', 'start', 'terrific', 'know', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'Ashtanga', 'Primary', 'Series', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'great', 'DVD', 'only', 'two', 'Sun', 'Salutations', 'building', 'up', 'bit', 'bit', 'one', '20-25', 'minutes', 'long', 'repeating', 'salutation', 'steps', 'complete.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'let', 'get', 'solid', 'footing', 'salutations', 'know', 'cold', 'could', 'probably', 'skip', 'Nicki', 'other', 'beginner', 'video.The', 'additional', 'features', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'sample', 'full', 'Ashtanga', 'program', 'amazing', 'interview', 'Nicki', 'Doane', 'very', 'accessible', 'love', 'straightforward', 'point', 'tone']",N/A

This routine is difficult...to say the least. 10 minutes in and I was profusely sweating. After another 10 minutes I had to stop.Not to say this is bad, in fact i plan to try something ""more my speed"" in the hopes of working back up to this level. The music is also very soothing and inspiring.I look forward to working myself up to this in the future.",5,I overestimated myself,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,448,"['bought', 'DVD', 'tonight', 'hopes', 'beginning', 'yoga', 'regiment.Boy', 'did', 'overshoot', 'routine', 'difficult', 'say', 'least', '10', 'minutes', 'was', 'profusely', 'sweating', '10', 'minutes', 'had', 'stop.Not', 'say', 'bad', 'fact', 'i', 'plan', 'try', 'something', 'more', 'speed', 'hopes', 'working', 'back', 'up', 'level', 'music', 'also', 'very', 'soothing', 'inspiring.I', 'look', 'forward', 'working', 'future']",N/A

Also Nicki Doane's interview explaining Ashtanga is very good. I've given this DVD a three because of these two sections. The actual practice was disappointing. There are no submenus for the Salutation A and B, you just have to skip forward through the practice if you want to do a portion. When I did practice straight through I found Nicki's voice quite abrasive. I'm sorry to say that because I think it is a good practice and in time I'm hoping her voice doesn't irritate me. I doubt I'll be bringing this one out a whole lot. A softer voice and better music would have improved this practice.",3,I'm not quite sure about this one.,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",2005,695,"['loved', 'advanced', 'Ashtanga', 'demonstration', 'something', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'Also', 'Nicki', 'Doane', 'interview', 'explaining', 'Ashtanga', 'very', 'good', ""'ve"", 'given', 'DVD', 'three', 'two', 'sections', 'actual', 'practice', 'was', 'disappointing', 'are', 'submenus', 'Salutation', 'A', 'B', 'just', 'have', 'skip', 'forward', 'practice', 'want', 'do', 'portion', 'When', 'did', 'practice', 'straight', 'found', 'Nicki', 'voice', 'quite', 'abrasive', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'think', 'good', 'practice', 'time', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'voice', ""n't"", 'irritate', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bringing', 'one', 'whole', 'lot', 'softer', 'voice', 'better', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'practice']",N/A

This is the first time I have ever attempted a yoga workout, and I must say it is more difficult than I imagined.  Nicki walks you through every step and uses repetition so you feel as if you have memorized every step even after the first viewing.I bought this DVD with the Beginner's Practice DVD and now realize I was WAY ahead of myself.  The Beginner's Practice DVD is much faster and more difficult and introduces new poses, but the first 45 mins or so are great if you want to do the sun salutations at a faster pace.All in all I do not regret buying this DVD at all.

761362,A2PNBB4GXRG14K,B0000A2ZOK,Roseanne Miske,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderful session of the traditional Ashtanga yoga!  I've tried a couple of Ashtanga DVDs/classes and many of them are so fast paced that it is hard to grasp and get into the poses before having to move on to the next. The pace of this disc is fantastic. Nicki spends time slowly going through each pose (in order) through several cycles until you 'get' it. Then she links the together more as a flow, but still at a very workable pace. Here's the breakdown of the complete program (55 minutes on my player's counter).Chanting and meditation: 0:00 to 6:00 minutesSurya Namaskar A  6:00 (slower paced)Surya Namaskar A  15:48 (faster pace as a flow)Surya Namaskar B  24:00At 39:40, she mentions that if you are tired, you can rest or stop here.Surya B continues.Seated lotus pose/breathing  46:00 to 49:0049:00 Shavasana starts,  ending at 55:00.Usually, I don't bother to watch the interviews on a DVD, but this one with Nicki is very interesting! I highly recommend watching it for the 11 minutes.Plus, inside the case there is a bonus large poster showing each Suryanamaskar A pose in detail!Even as a more advanced yogini, this session is very fulfilling and enjoyable.  Great for a newbie or veteran!",5,HIghly recommended!
