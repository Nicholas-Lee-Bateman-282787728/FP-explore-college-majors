1504535,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005WFWVL4,A kids review,"[0, 0]","Steven Soderbergh is one busy man -- he's directed at least one film a year since 1995, with the exception of 2003 -- and he's also one of those directors who has successfully navigated both independent and mainstream waters with finesse. Last year, we got his latest ensemble hit, Contagion, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly epidemic starring some of Hollywood's biggest stars, and while we've seen outbreak movies before, I found Contagion worthy of 4 stars. The story follows multiple threads as a lethal airborne virus rapidly goes worldwide, charting the paths of those tasked with mitigating the global impact of the disaster and those simply trying to cope with its deadly effects. Bolstered by an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, and Marion Cotillard, just to name a few, Contagion is a tense, tightly plotted, and exceptionally smart disaster movie that simply adds another notch to Steven Soderbergh's already stellar career.",4,Contagion,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,1009,"['Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'one', 'busy', 'man', 'directed', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'year', '1995', 'exception', '2003', 'also', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'successfully', 'navigated', 'independent', 'mainstream', 'waters', 'finesse', 'Last', 'year', 'got', 'latest', 'ensemble', 'hit', 'Contagion', 'apocalyptic', 'thriller', 'deadly', 'epidemic', 'starring', 'Hollywood', 'biggest', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'outbreak', 'movies', 'found', 'Contagion', 'worthy', '4', 'stars', 'story', 'multiple', 'threads', 'lethal', 'airborne', 'virus', 'rapidly', 'worldwide', 'charting', 'paths', 'tasked', 'mitigating', 'global', 'impact', 'disaster', 'simply', 'trying', 'cope', 'deadly', 'effects', 'Bolstered', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'Contagion', 'tense', 'tightly', 'plotted', 'exceptionally', 'smart', 'disaster', 'movie', 'simply', 'notch', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'already', 'stellar', 'career']",N/A

1504539,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005WFWVL4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`Contagion' is one of those films that continues to grow in my eyes as one of the best (in the very least, one of the most underrated) films of 2011.  Ever since first seeing it upon its release, it has only grown in esteem to me; a film that is truly inspired and original in its dissection of a global horror story.  From the film's claustrophobic cinematography to its sharply spliced editing to the perfectly timed performances that soak in the realism of every scene; `Contagion' feels like a documentary embellished with a director's visual approach.In `Contagion', a young woman named Beth contracts what she assumes is a cold, but that cold then spreads rapidly, killing many as it overtakes the globe.  From the vantage point of the doctors striving to find a cure, `Contagion' bypasses the clich&eacute;d approach taken by most viral films (that is, merely focusing on riots in the street and social and moral decline) but giving us a fresh and intriguing look at what happens `behind the scenes'.  Soderbergh and company develop a story that screams realism, from those working for the greater good as well as those focused on stardom and or financial benefits; and it never shies away from presenting the film's `heroes' as imperfect men.With an impressive cast (who nearly all deliver noteworthy performances), Soderbergh's `Contagion' is a magnificent thriller that sends the chills without every sacrificing the intelligence needed to make this film memorable.",5,A behind the scenes look at global panic...,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",2012,1475,"['Contagion', 'one', 'films', 'grow', 'eyes', 'one', 'best', 'very', 'least', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', '2011', 'Ever', 'first', 'seeing', 'release', 'only', 'grown', 'esteem', 'film', 'truly', 'inspired', 'original', 'dissection', 'global', 'horror', 'story', 'film', 'claustrophobic', 'cinematography', 'sharply', 'spliced', 'editing', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'performances', 'soak', 'realism', 'scene', 'Contagion', 'feels', 'documentary', 'embellished', 'director', 'visual', 'approach.In', 'Contagion', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Beth', 'contracts', 'what', 'cold', 'cold', 'then', 'rapidly', 'killing', 'many', 'globe', 'vantage', 'point', 'doctors', 'striving', 'find', 'cure', 'Contagion', 'clich', 'eacute', 'approach', 'taken', 'most', 'viral', 'films', 'merely', 'focusing', 'riots', 'street', 'social', 'moral', 'decline', 'giving', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'look', 'what', 'scenes', 'Soderbergh', 'company', 'develop', 'story', 'realism', 'working', 'greater', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'focused', 'stardom', 'financial', 'benefits', 'never', 'away', 'presenting', 'film', 'heroes', 'imperfect', 'men.With', 'impressive', 'cast', 'who', 'nearly', 'deliver', 'noteworthy', 'performances', 'Soderbergh', 'Contagion', 'magnificent', 'thriller', 'chills', 'sacrificing', 'intelligence', 'needed', 'make', 'film', 'memorable']",N/A

We had a two-person date deal that included a large popcorn and two large drinks, but frankly we found it difficult to enjoy any of the snacks while watching ""Contagion"".The story line is gut-wrenchingly realistic...so much so that I wonder why an outbreak of the type shown in this film hasn't happened before.  The portrayal of the effects of an extremely virulent virus are graphically portrayed, and the manner of death is grim and gritty to say the least.  If you go to see this show you need to be prepared to see (or look away from) a depiction of an autopsy where a person's skull is opened and the skin on the top of the head is pulled over the top of the face (just FYI).References to the technical aspects of identifying and fighting a disease like this was the central focus of the film, but there was not so much technical info that it would put off most viewers.  Yet, at the same time, there were enough of the technical aspects that a scientist would have something to chew on.Be prepared to have a flutter in your stomach throughout most of this movie.  Also be prepared for extremely tense drama, including pulses of strong language.The collection of top-notch actors in this film is quite impressive, and while outbreak kinds of movies have been produced several times over the past several years, this one was top-notch.  It did not seem self-serving or contrived.  The air of authenticity in the film was overwhelming.The film is compelling in a cautionary vision of social and political breakdown that could accompany a global pandemic.  Scarily compelling!I noticed that a few other reviews (i.e., 1-star reviews) stated that this was the most boring film that they'd seen in a long time.  Well, all I have to say about that is that if you go to this film expecting lots of gunfire, explosions, brain-eating zombies or the like you are going to be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for intelligent drama and a story line that is both plausible and terrifying then ""Contagion"" is for you.All in all this film is simultaneously outstanding, disconcerting, grim,and gritty.5 stars (and I'm still thinking about it a day later...)",5,"Gritty, intelligent, and realistically frightening",1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2209,"['wife', 'saw', 'movie', 'recently', 'had', 'two-person', 'date', 'deal', 'included', 'large', 'popcorn', 'two', 'large', 'drinks', 'frankly', 'found', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'snacks', 'watching', 'Contagion', '.The', 'story', 'line', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'realistic', 'so', 'much', 'wonder', 'why', 'outbreak', 'type', 'shown', 'film', ""n't"", 'happened', 'before', 'portrayal', 'effects', 'extremely', 'virulent', 'virus', 'are', 'graphically', 'portrayed', 'manner', 'death', 'grim', 'gritty', 'say', 'least', 'go', 'see', 'show', 'need', 'be', 'prepared', 'see', 'look', 'away', 'depiction', 'autopsy', 'where', 'person', 'skull', 'opened', 'skin', 'top', 'head', 'pulled', 'top', 'face', 'just', 'FYI', 'technical', 'aspects', 'identifying', 'fighting', 'disease', 'was', 'central', 'focus', 'film', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'technical', 'info', 'would', 'put', 'off', 'most', 'viewers', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'enough', 'technical', 'aspects', 'scientist', 'would', 'have', 'something', 'chew', 'on.Be', 'prepared', 'have', 'flutter', 'stomach', 'most', 'movie', 'Also', 'be', 'prepared', 'extremely', 'tense', 'drama', 'including', 'pulses', 'strong', 'language.The', 'collection', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'film', 'quite', 'impressive', 'outbreak', 'kinds', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'several', 'times', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'one', 'was', 'top-notch', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'self-serving', 'contrived', 'air', 'authenticity', 'film', 'was', 'overwhelming.The', 'film', 'compelling', 'cautionary', 'vision', 'social', 'political', 'breakdown', 'could', 'accompany', 'global', 'pandemic', 'Scarily', 'compelling', 'noticed', 'few', 'other', 'reviews', 'i.e.', '1-star', 'reviews', 'stated', 'was', 'most', 'boring', 'film', ""'d"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Well', 'have', 'say', 'go', 'film', 'expecting', 'lots', 'gunfire', 'explosions', 'brain-eating', 'zombies', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'looking', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'story', 'line', 'plausible', 'terrifying', 'then', 'Contagion', 'you.All', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'outstanding', 'disconcerting', 'grim', 'gritty.5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'still', 'thinking', 'day', 'later']",N/A

Yes you will see in fine detail the much needed explanation for a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world (especially Hong Kong, England and America) but I feel the film ends too abruptly.  Small complaint I suppose, but I didn't see it coming and I would have liked more.Anyway, as you can probably guess by the title of the film, Contagion is about a deadly virus that attacks millions of people around the world... exactly what I mention in the previous paragraph, lol.  There's really not much more to the storyline than that, however what Contagion does remarkably well is contain a perfect balance of drama and suspense.  In fact, while quite often the first half of the film ventures dangerously close to boredom territory by dragging its feet with predictable writing that hardly goes the extra mile to stand out from other deadly virus movies, what it makes up for is keeping the surprise factor intact.  Who will be the next person to come into contact with the virus?  I really enjoyed the mysteries and surprises.Unless I missed something, I can't recall there being an explanation for whatever happened to the woman who traveled overseas and came down with the virus symptoms while staying in her hotel room.  I must have missed a vital segment because it seems unlikely such an important character (at the time, at least) would just be writen off like that.  Then again she *did* sort of resemble Matt Damon's wife so maybe I just got the two faces mixed up.Speaking of Matt Damon, I'm used to seeing Matt run around city blocks and save either himself, or somebody else in dramatic fashion (usually before a bomb explodes!)  In Contagion, he's significantly more relaxed and easy going.  It's because he plays the role of a father, and after losing his wife and son -despite not showing much emotion which is definitely atypical for *any* human being after such a traumatic experience- he's still going around searching for answers pertaining to the virus but perhaps not *quite* as much as you'd expect.  The storyline definitely switches between several different characters, and does so quite often.Near the end, the suspense seems to disappear and a return to one drama segment after another comes around again.  Not really a problem however.  Perhaps the highlight for me is when Matt throws a prom dance for his daughter and even decorates the living room to make it as realistic as possible (since the schools across the country have been closed down).Anyway my favorite actor is probably the British guy who was able to cleverly expose peoples lies, however that came around to bite him in the behind as you'll discover later on.Overall, excellent drama, decent suspense, lackluster ending.",4,and the death toll rises,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2857,"['only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Contagion', '5-star', 'rating', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'fond', 'way', 'movie', 'Yes', 'will', 'see', 'fine', 'detail', 'much', 'needed', 'explanation', 'deadly', 'virus', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'especially', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'England', 'America', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'abruptly', 'Small', 'complaint', 'suppose', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more.Anyway', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'title', 'film', 'Contagion', 'deadly', 'virus', 'millions', 'people', 'world', 'exactly', 'what', 'mention', 'previous', 'paragraph', 'lol', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'storyline', 'however', 'what', 'Contagion', 'remarkably', 'well', 'contain', 'perfect', 'balance', 'drama', 'suspense', 'fact', 'quite', 'often', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'ventures', 'dangerously', 'close', 'boredom', 'territory', 'dragging', 'feet', 'predictable', 'writing', 'hardly', 'extra', 'mile', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'deadly', 'virus', 'movies', 'what', 'up', 'keeping', 'surprise', 'factor', 'intact', 'Who', 'will', 'be', 'next', 'person', 'come', 'contact', 'virus', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'mysteries', 'surprises.Unless', 'missed', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'there', 'being', 'explanation', 'happened', 'woman', 'who', 'traveled', 'overseas', 'came', 'down', 'virus', 'symptoms', 'staying', 'hotel', 'room', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'vital', 'segment', 'unlikely', 'such', 'important', 'character', 'time', 'least', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'writen', 'off', 'Then', 'again', '*did*', 'sort', 'resemble', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'wife', 'maybe', 'just', 'got', 'two', 'mixed', 'up.Speaking', 'Matt', 'Damon', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'Matt', 'run', 'around', 'city', 'blocks', 'save', 'somebody', 'else', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'usually', 'bomb', 'Contagion', 'significantly', 'more', 'relaxed', 'easy', 'going', 'role', 'father', 'losing', 'wife', 'son', '-despite', 'not', 'showing', 'much', 'emotion', 'definitely', 'atypical', '*any*', 'human', 'being', 'traumatic', 'experience-', 'still', 'going', 'searching', 'answers', 'pertaining', 'virus', 'perhaps', 'not', '*quite*', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'expect', 'storyline', 'definitely', 'several', 'different', 'characters', 'so', 'quite', 'end', 'suspense', 'disappear', 'return', 'one', 'drama', 'segment', 'around', 'again', 'Not', 'really', 'problem', 'however', 'Perhaps', 'highlight', 'when', 'Matt', 'prom', 'dance', 'daughter', 'even', 'living', 'room', 'make', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'schools', 'country', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'down', '.Anyway', 'favorite', 'actor', 'probably', 'British', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'able', 'cleverly', 'expose', 'peoples', 'however', 'came', 'bite', 'behind', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'later', 'on.Overall', 'excellent', 'drama', 'decent', 'suspense', 'lackluster', 'ending']",N/A

1504553,A2TJG4N8LNJW23,B005WFWVL4,Blythe Dresser,"[1, 1]","I can admit that I can be a little bit of a hypochondriac sometimes.  Maybe a lot.  But I digress... I had never let plague movies scare me very much because usually they were so contrived and overdone that I wouldn't get swept away in the reality of it all.  There's something a bit farcical about the idea that a plague could break out then our movie-star hero would swoop in and save the day within a week.Contagion changes all of that.You know when you're going to see a Steven Soderbergh movie that it's going to be something well-done and carefully planned out.  I think one of his most defining characteristics as a direction is his attention to detail.  Not long before the movie was released I read an interview with him in the local newspaper and he explained that when he decided to make Contagion, he set out to make an outbreak movie that was as realistic and relatable as possible.  That's what hooked me so I dragged my boyfriend to the cinema to check it out.Let me just say now that when the movie was over and we left the theatre, I immediately ran to Target and bought the biggest bottle of Purell that I could get my hands on.Much like Soderbergh's Traffic, this movie tells the intersecting storylines of several different characters and, because of that, there is no one star.  I like it this way.  We meet Matt Damon, a man who is naturally immune to the disease; his wife Gwyneth Paltrow, who is suspected to be patient zero; Marion Cotillard, an investigator with the World Health Organization; Kate Winslet, a doctor with the Center for Diseason Control; Laurence Fishburn, her boss and head of the CDC; and Jude Law, a famous internet blogger who claims the outbreak is a goverment conspiracy.  I think what makes this film so successful is that the outbreak story is approached from almost every imaginable angle.  Also, the events of the film transpire over the span of a year from the day it infects its first host to the day when the plague is finally contained.  This is a much more realistic approach.  Throughout the film Soderbergh answers many of the questions one might not ask until one finds herself in the middle of such a situation:How would the government cope with a global pandemic?How would local businesses services be run?How would the public handle the fear and isolation?What would it take to find a cure?How did such a disease originate?How long would it take to manufacture a treatment?Who would get the vaccine first?Would anyone try to capitalize on the fear for profit?How far would a person go to protect their family/loved ones?How would the public get food/information/help?All I could think as the movie was playing out is how realistic it all seemed.  I had never considered the possibility of such a thing before but as more shocking events unfolded, I suddenly thought about them and how likely it would be for them to transpire in exactly such a way.  It left me feeling very uneasy when the film was over.One thing I read about the movie (and this provides a very minor spoiler) is that Soderbergh showed the final cut to consultants within the CDC as well as medical professionals.  There is a scene where a doctor injects herself with the vaccine.  In the original cut, she injected herself quite quickly through her pantyhose.  The consultants told the director that no doctor would ever consider doing that.  So he went back and reshot this one relatively brief scene so that the doctor roles down her hose, swabs the area with disinfectant and then injects herself.  A fairly small detail that shows Soderbergh's commitment to detail and realism.This movie isn't for the faint at heart, but it isn't a horror movie either.  I wouldn't even call it a thriller, necessarily.  But I think it is a terrific film and is definitely worth a watch if it doesn't scare you senseless along the way.",5,What's truly terrifying is how undrestated and realistic it is...,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,3856,"['can', 'admit', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'hypochondriac', 'sometimes', 'Maybe', 'lot', 'digress', 'had', 'never', 'let', 'plague', 'movies', 'scare', 'very', 'much', 'usually', 'were', 'so', 'contrived', 'overdone', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'swept', 'away', 'reality', 'something', 'bit', 'farcical', 'idea', 'plague', 'could', 'break', 'out', 'then', 'movie-star', 'hero', 'would', 'swoop', 'save', 'day', 'week.Contagion', 'that.You', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'well-done', 'carefully', 'planned', 'out', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'defining', 'characteristics', 'direction', 'attention', 'detail', 'Not', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'read', 'interview', 'local', 'newspaper', 'explained', 'when', 'decided', 'make', 'Contagion', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'outbreak', 'movie', 'was', 'realistic', 'relatable', 'possible', 'what', 'hooked', 'dragged', 'boyfriend', 'cinema', 'check', 'out.Let', 'just', 'say', 'now', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'left', 'theatre', 'immediately', 'ran', 'Target', 'bought', 'biggest', 'bottle', 'Purell', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'on.Much', 'Soderbergh', 'Traffic', 'movie', 'intersecting', 'storylines', 'several', 'different', 'characters', 'one', 'star', 'like', 'way', 'meet', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'man', 'who', 'naturally', 'immune', 'disease', 'wife', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'suspected', 'be', 'patient', 'zero', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'investigator', 'World', 'Health', 'Organization', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'doctor', 'Center', 'Diseason', 'Control', 'Laurence', 'Fishburn', 'boss', 'head', 'CDC', 'Jude', 'Law', 'famous', 'internet', 'blogger', 'who', 'outbreak', 'goverment', 'conspiracy', 'think', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'outbreak', 'story', 'approached', 'almost', 'imaginable', 'angle', 'Also', 'events', 'film', 'transpire', 'span', 'year', 'day', 'first', 'host', 'day', 'when', 'plague', 'finally', 'contained', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'film', 'Soderbergh', 'many', 'questions', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'ask', 'one', 'middle', 'such', 'situation', 'How', 'would', 'government', 'cope', 'global', 'pandemic', 'How', 'would', 'local', 'businesses', 'services', 'be', 'run', 'How', 'would', 'public', 'handle', 'fear', 'isolation', 'What', 'would', 'take', 'find', 'cure', 'How', 'did', 'disease', 'originate', 'How', 'long', 'would', 'take', 'manufacture', 'treatment', 'Who', 'would', 'get', 'vaccine', 'first', 'Would', 'anyone', 'try', 'capitalize', 'fear', 'profit', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'person', 'go', 'protect', 'family/loved', 'ones', 'How', 'would', 'public', 'get', 'food/information/help', 'could', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'playing', 'out', 'how', 'realistic', 'seemed', 'had', 'never', 'considered', 'possibility', 'such', 'thing', 'before', 'more', 'shocking', 'events', 'unfolded', 'suddenly', 'thought', 'how', 'likely', 'would', 'be', 'transpire', 'exactly', 'way', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'uneasy', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'over.One', 'thing', 'read', 'movie', 'very', 'minor', 'spoiler', 'Soderbergh', 'showed', 'final', 'cut', 'consultants', 'CDC', 'as', 'well', 'medical', 'professionals', 'scene', 'where', 'doctor', 'vaccine', 'original', 'cut', 'injected', 'quite', 'quickly', 'pantyhose', 'consultants', 'told', 'director', 'doctor', 'would', 'ever', 'consider', 'doing', 'So', 'went', 'back', 'reshot', 'one', 'relatively', 'brief', 'scene', 'doctor', 'down', 'hose', 'swabs', 'area', 'disinfectant', 'then', 'fairly', 'small', 'detail', 'Soderbergh', 'commitment', 'detail', 'realism.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'faint', 'heart', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'call', 'thriller', 'necessarily', 'think', 'terrific', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', ""n't"", 'scare', 'senseless', 'way']",N/A

From there it just spreads and spreads...and spreads. I always knew Gwyneth Paltrow would be the death of this world.In all honesty though, this film is terrifying but it just moves too fast. You don't really get what's going on until the disease has already claimed lives. That's not to say that the film doesn't have some solid story telling. It does. Contagion follows the lives of five different people. Matt Damon knows about the disease more than most because it claimed the life of not only his wife (Paltrow), but his son as well. From there we see him coping with that, and trying to protect his daughter from falling victim as well. Kate Winslet is the person put in charge of containing and combating the virus, even trying to find the source. Her boss, Laurence Fishburne, is the head of the CDC, so not only is he having to explain to the populace about what's happening, but he's also doing what he can to keep his lover safe. Jude Law is the arrogant blogger hellbent on outing CDC for all the wrong they've done in reaction to dealing with this disease. And finally, the beautiful Marion Cotillard is sent to find find the origin. Once she does, she is subjected to a kidnapping of sorts.So, the director has a lot of story to tell in a slim 106 minutes. He does a respectible job, but some characters don't feel very fleshed out. Well...scratch that, none feel very real. I understand the primary story is about how the world dealt with the quick spread of this very dangerous disease. Yet, the story of the disease centers around the reaction of these five characters. Matt Damon, for instance, lost his wife and son, and on top of that found out she was rearranging her schedule to meet up with another man and cheat on him.

This is a good movie, but its minimalist approach has thrown some people off, but for me it got better with age.This is the antithesis of a Hollywood movie: no high-octane action, no super-heroes, just realistic characters dealing with an epidemic in their own desperate way.  It follows a low-drama, documentary style approach that bounces between the governmental efforts to combat the virus and several human events stories that run through the movie. It has a similar feel to Traffic, which Soderbergh directed. The Matt Damon thread deals with the plight of the average family, the Jude Law thread deals with the financial profiteering aspect, and the Laurence Fishburne / Kate Winslet thread deals with the government response to the virus.All the threads of this movie are very human, showing everyone's warts as they wrestle with the social ramifications of the virus.The performances are all outstanding as you would expect.

1504564,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B005WFWVL4,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I read an amazing book awhile back entitled ""The Hot Zone,"" which I believe is mostly a non-fiction account of how a new strain of Ebola spread from Africa to the east coast of the United States.  The virus was contained, but just barely.  The potential consequences, laid out very nicely by the author of that work, were quite dire.  And so far for me, this film is the closest disaster-type film that demonstrates this same idea, albeit in pictures instead of words.I hate to flog a dead horse -- OK, so I lied -- but I wrote a review of the film ""The Impossible"" awhile back.  After I wrote that review, I was skewered by ad hominems and appeals to emotion by other viewers, obviously logical fallacies to the logicians out there.  But anyways, I juxtaposed that film in a review of ""Aftershock"" later, where I argued that the survivors in the former were impossibly kind, while the survivors in the latter were impossibly cruel.  I also wrote that I enjoyed ""Aftershock"" more because at least it showed human behavior more correctly in a time of crisis.  But this film is probably right in-between the two, and I believe that the looting and crime that they show here are spot-on in believability.And even Matt Damon, who usually plays the nice guy in most of his roles -- minus of course his role in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (a film that I also really liked) -- actually does a little Bad-Will-Hunting here himself.  Even he breaks at one point as his family needs food and supplies, and so the film shows him breaking into a neighbor's house and rummaging through that neighbor's refrigerator.  Ah, I say that, given enough pressure, you could even break Mother Teresa (assuming she were still alive), and I even have some proof of that:  she endured an exorcism herself before she passed away.  Perhaps the Devil was able to break her.  ""So there!"" and ""take that!"" I say to you disbelievers out there of bad human behavior!Most disaster films just plain get it wrong.  ""Contagion"" just plain gets it right.  At least mostly so.  They show how the government tries to use disinformation to avoid a panic, and I also found this believable.  As a matter of fact, while watching, I was thinking about the whole asteroid thing that happened recently.  Supposedly, an earth-killer flew by at about a million miles away.  Luckily, it didn't hit us.  And the government was nice enough to tell us about it in advance, just as it was about to fly by at a very-safe-but-near-miss distance.  But I also thought the following:  what if the government knew that it WOULD have hit us?  Would they have given us that information?I believe they would have tried to hide it.  Americans are often biased to think that the government will divulge the information, but only since they have told us about the negative cases in the past.  Those are easy.  And after all, it took a contractor recently to spill the beans that the government is listening in on our phone conversations.  (I'm not much into conspiracy theories myself, but it's also wise to not completely discredit them out of hand.  Sometimes the government does bad things, such as save all of our emails, as an example.)Well, I say, ""Contagion is Contagious!""  Maybe not as good as ""The Hot Zone,"" and perhaps more of a 4.5.  But I'm rounding up to a 5, since so many disaster movies are just so, well, disastrous, while this one is just so good.",5,Contagious!,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3400,"['read', 'amazing', 'book', 'awhile', 'back', 'entitled', 'Hot', 'Zone', 'believe', 'mostly', 'non-fiction', 'account', 'how', 'new', 'strain', 'Ebola', 'spread', 'Africa', 'east', 'coast', 'United', 'States', 'virus', 'was', 'contained', 'just', 'barely', 'potential', 'consequences', 'laid', 'out', 'very', 'nicely', 'author', 'work', 'were', 'quite', 'dire', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'closest', 'disaster-type', 'film', 'same', 'idea', 'pictures', 'instead', 'words.I', 'hate', 'flog', 'dead', 'horse', 'OK', 'lied', 'wrote', 'review', 'film', 'Impossible', 'awhile', 'back', 'wrote', 'review', 'was', 'skewered', 'ad', 'hominems', 'appeals', 'emotion', 'other', 'viewers', 'obviously', 'logical', 'fallacies', 'logicians', 'out', 'there', 'juxtaposed', 'film', 'review', 'Aftershock', 'later', 'where', 'argued', 'survivors', 'former', 'were', 'impossibly', 'kind', 'survivors', 'latter', 'were', 'impossibly', 'cruel', 'also', 'wrote', 'enjoyed', 'Aftershock', 'more', 'because', 'least', 'showed', 'human', 'behavior', 'more', 'correctly', 'time', 'crisis', 'film', 'probably', 'right', 'in-between', 'two', 'believe', 'looting', 'crime', 'show', 'here', 'are', 'spot-on', 'believability.And', 'even', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'usually', 'nice', 'guy', 'most', 'roles', 'minus', 'course', 'role', 'Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley', 'film', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'actually', 'little', 'Bad-Will-Hunting', 'here', 'Even', 'one', 'point', 'family', 'food', 'supplies', 'so', 'film', 'breaking', 'neighbor', 'house', 'rummaging', 'neighbor', 'refrigerator', 'Ah', 'say', 'given', 'enough', 'pressure', 'could', 'even', 'break', 'Mother', 'Teresa', 'assuming', 'were', 'still', 'alive', 'even', 'have', 'proof', 'endured', 'exorcism', 'passed', 'away', 'Perhaps', 'Devil', 'was', 'able', 'break', 'So', 'there', 'take', 'say', 'disbelievers', 'there', 'bad', 'human', 'behavior', 'Most', 'disaster', 'films', 'just', 'plain', 'get', 'wrong', 'Contagion', 'just', 'plain', 'right', 'least', 'mostly', 'so', 'show', 'how', 'government', 'tries', 'use', 'disinformation', 'avoid', 'panic', 'also', 'found', 'believable', 'matter', 'fact', 'watching', 'was', 'thinking', 'whole', 'asteroid', 'thing', 'happened', 'recently', 'Supposedly', 'earth-killer', 'flew', 'million', 'miles', 'away', 'Luckily', 'did', ""n't"", 'hit', 'government', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'tell', 'advance', 'just', 'was', 'fly', 'very-safe-but-near-miss', 'distance', 'also', 'thought', 'following', 'what', 'government', 'knew', 'WOULD', 'have', 'hit', 'Would', 'have', 'given', 'information', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'tried', 'hide', 'Americans', 'are', 'often', 'biased', 'think', 'government', 'will', 'divulge', 'information', 'only', 'have', 'told', 'negative', 'cases', 'past', 'are', 'easy', 'took', 'contractor', 'recently', 'spill', 'beans', 'government', 'listening', 'phone', 'conversations', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'also', 'wise', 'not', 'completely', 'discredit', 'hand', 'government', 'bad', 'things', 'such', 'save', 'emails', 'example', 'Well', 'say', 'Contagion', 'Contagious', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Hot', 'Zone', 'perhaps', 'more', '4.5', ""'m"", 'rounding', 'up', '5', 'so', 'many', 'disaster', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'well', 'disastrous', 'one', 'just', 'so', 'good']",N/A

It is also an ensemble cast which can be difficult to pull off but this movie manages it. Basically, a very lethal virus sweeps the world, turning into a pandemic.  There is HUGE loss of life until a vaccine is developed.  The first case which brings it into the USA is Gwyn Paltrow who flies home from Asia to Minnesota.  Within a very short time of being home with a cold, she goes into convulsions, is taken to the hospital and dies. Her son goes next and is replicates at swift speed after that.

It seemed to develop exactly as such a pandemic would develop around the world.There is an all star cast.  It would be nice to have more screen time for some of them but then we'd miss getting the bigger picture.  People do panic, loot, try to escape, kidnap people for vaccine trades and so forth and so on.There is a trade off for all of this reality and ensemble acting.

The film takes us into the lives of people sick and dying from an unidentified infectious disease, the public health officials who are trying to track down the paths of contagion to find the source of the infection, the government officials trying to manage information and the responses of the public, the scientists who are trying to identify the agent and develop a vaccine, and the paranoid conspiracy crowd that muddles the picture, often for their own gain. The story begins with a bang as we see Gwyneth Paltrow travel from a business trip in Hong Kong to Minneapolis via a 5 hour overlay in Chicago and then dies a horrible death from the unknown cause. Her husband Matt Damon is then left to pick up the pieces and struggle through months of national turmoil. Parallel to all the confusion and panic, CDC scientists first try to track the source of the disease and calculate infection rates and Kate Winslet is great as a dedicated Epidemiological Investigation Service agent sent out by the CDC to find the cause of the pandemic and calculate mortality and morbidity of this unknown terror. We also see Marion Cotillard as a World Health Organization epidemiologist trying to find the vectors that transmitted the disease from some animal or plant source to humans. We also see Jennifer Ehle, a superb and often overlooked actress, who plays a CDC scientist who maps the molecular structure of the agent and begins the laborious work of developing a vaccine, including the age old technique of researchers in the last century, testing the vaccine on themselves once the crisis has reached unbearable proportions. Jennifer Ehle has many great scenes throughout the film. In once such scene she is describing the genetic structure of the unknown agent to a CDC administrator, Laurence Fishburne, and as she identifies the bat and pig virus sections in the new agent, we hear her amazement and mastery combined with her terror and apprehension. Scenes of civil breakdown with looted pharmacies, empty grocery stores, lack of any government services and protection, are all grim reminders of what could happen in such an emergency. The emergency rooms and hospitals become so filled up that the dying are laid out in gymnasiums. The morgues and funeral homes cease to function and the dead are buried in mass graves and covered by dirt by bulldozers. This is a very intelligent film that never talks down to the viewer and for the most part sticks to the facts and protocols that would be followed in such a disaster. The film is not a science fiction film in that it follows what could happen should such an agent be let loose on the human population. The acting is superb with a top cast. The script never talks down to the viewer and expects to be understood. The film is light on in-depth character development but we see folks reacting to a unique crisis.

In Honk Kong, London and other parts of the world other people are dying from the same unknown illness. The Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization begin studying the disease as more and more people become infected while others, like the original woman's husband, are immune. The disease is eventually discovered to have originated in Hong Kong and has characteristics of both a bat and a pig. Armed with this information doctors try to create a treatment while outside, society is breaking down. Food is scarce, crime is rampant and the flames of discontent are being fanned by a disingenuous internet blogger claiming there is a cure that the American government is keeping secret.Contagion is a well made movie with excellent performances by all involved. It does a credible job of showing how easily a disease like this can spread and how vulnerable we all are. It is also scary how quickly society can decay in the face of an emergency no one clearly understands. Lies and rumors spread almost faster than the disease. People will believe almost anything in order to keep hope alive. The characters were very realistic, with both noble and ignoble tendencies whether they were in power or part of the citizenry.My only quibble is whether this movie was necessary.

If you take exception to this statement, understand that I saw all the good ones around Christmas and that's why I am here talking Contagion.I actually liked this movie despite the fact that it didn't deal with a personal core story as much as fit was a story about how rapidly really bad diseases spread. It reminded me of one of my kids early books called Gossip. The moral in that book is that a little bird tells a larger member of the animal chain something and the information passed from animal to animal gets larger and changes until it is off the charts.What the viewer sees here is akin to the process of something getting spread around. The disease starts out as a sneaky and inexplicable malady that kills and when it picks up momentum, it becomes a race to identify its source and come up with an antidote and manage its spread.Without much more than the slightest thread that links people to one another and make the viewer feel an emotional investment, it still manages to get the viewer squirming. I'm dealing with a cold right now and I felt myself feeling sicker as I watched this on a cushy couch in the family room. Talk about the power of suggestion or am I a closet hypochondriac? Watching the people from the CDC added to the suspense as well as my anxiety.The acting was good as was the script. Though not a weeper, this movie was effective and good. I enjoyed it, it presented me with things to consider given the current political climate, and I did feel better once things got under control in no small part due to the unrelenting efforts by the CDC.

1504584,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005WFWVL4,DanD,"[3, 4]","Steven Soderbergh has amassed an interesting body of films, from sheer popcorn entertainment (the first OCEAN'S 11 movie), to the art-house fare (CHE), to the offbeat (THE INFORMANT!), to the Oscar-worthy (TRAFFIC), to the crappy (the second and third OCEAN'S films).  I broke this down as much as I did to get across a specific point: Steven Soderbergh knows how to make a movie, and not only that, he knows how to make movies HIS way.CONTAGION is proof.  It's a solidly-crafted film revolving based on a Scott Z. Burns (THE INFORMANT!, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM) script.  The film follows various individuals amidst a pandemic: a grieving father/husband; a group of research scientists; an investigator; a conspiracy blogger; and the virus itself, as it passes from person-to-person.  Soderbergh again collects an impressive cast: Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Bryan Cranston, John Hawkes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Elliot Gould, Dmetri Martin, Sanaa Lathan, and others.  Standouts include Matt Damon, as the afore-mentioned father; Winslet as a field-researcher; Fishburne and Ehle as her colleagues; and Gould in a criminally-small role as another researcher.  Other actors are wasted in thankless, meaningless roles and subplots (Cotillard, Law).This latter flaw is what really holds the film back.  As with all massive ensemble films, it's easy to get things tangled, to add to much fuel to the fire.  Soderbergh, usually capable of juggling his casts, seems to lose track; certain story lines are left unfinished (and not in the good, ambiguous sort of way), and other story lines are utterly unnecessary.

1504587,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B005WFWVL4,DarthJustice,"[0, 0]","I recently bought Contagion on blu-ray. Finally after getting the chance to watch it a day later, I decided to write this review while still fresh in my mind.Contagion very vaguely reminds me of the 1996 medical thriller Outbreak. However, Contagion managed to do something Outbreak never did for me--giving me a nice feeling of suspenseful ""what's going to happen next"" dread kind of feeling. I will admit though not really a ""scary"" movie, the way everything was portrayed I found more frightening.Comparisons aside, Contagion is a medical thriller ensemble movie starring Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Late Winslet, Matt Damon and featuring the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. As such, the movie lacks a true central character or storyline. Instead it focuses on three: Laurence Fisburne plays Dr. Leonora Orantes, a CDC worker, Matt Damon as Mitch Ernoff, the husband of Gwynteth Paltrow's character (who is ""patient zero""), and Jude Law as a conspiracy-minded self-serving blogger.Of the three, I enjoyed the storyline following Matt Damon's character and his daughter the most followed by Laurence Fishburne's. Truthfully I didn't care much for Jude Law's storyline. It wasn't really that it was bad or anything, I just felt it more slowed the movie down than anything. I rather would have had more focus on the medical teams trying to come up with a vaccine, Mitch and his daughter surviving as social order began breaking down around them, or even what Kate Winslet's character did while virtually held hostage in the Chinese village.The movie follows the respective characters as they continue trying to live and work as everything begins breaking down and panic, rioting, and looting begins to break out across the United States. I thought Contagion did a great job showing the fear among the public and giving off a sense of dread.The acting was well done and the quality on my HDTV was great so no complaints there. One of the only real complaints I had with the movie was ""Mitch's"" reaction to his wife's and six year old son's deaths. One would expect that having two loved ones die so closely with each other, much less one of which is your child, to have a huge impact on you. Instead, other than a scene or two of anger and crying (not even hard crying) he seemed to take their deaths....rather exceedingly well, actually. Just something I noticed.I think one thing that makes this movie as creepy as it is (if such a word can be used here) is that this is the kind of movie that can actually happen exactly as shown. You don't expect to look out the window one morning to see zombies marching towards your home or a masked serial killer chasing you. But a global pandemic killing millions not only CAN happen but HAS and could very well happen AGAIN.Don't forget to wash your hands.",4,A Scarier Version Of Outbreak,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",2012,2794,"['recently', 'bought', 'Contagion', 'blu-ray', 'Finally', 'getting', 'chance', 'watch', 'day', 'later', 'decided', 'write', 'review', 'still', 'fresh', 'mind.Contagion', 'very', 'vaguely', '1996', 'medical', 'thriller', 'Outbreak', 'However', 'Contagion', 'managed', 'do', 'something', 'Outbreak', 'never', 'did', 'giving', 'nice', 'feeling', 'suspenseful', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'dread', 'kind', 'feeling', 'will', 'admit', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'movie', 'way', 'everything', 'was', 'portrayed', 'found', 'more', 'frightening.Comparisons', 'aside', 'Contagion', 'medical', 'thriller', 'ensemble', 'movie', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Late', 'Winslet', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'featuring', 'likes', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'such', 'movie', 'true', 'central', 'character', 'storyline', 'Instead', 'three', 'Laurence', 'Fisburne', 'Dr.', 'Leonora', 'Orantes', 'CDC', 'worker', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Mitch', 'Ernoff', 'husband', 'Gwynteth', 'Paltrow', 'character', 'who', 'patient', 'zero', 'Jude', 'Law', 'conspiracy-minded', 'self-serving', 'blogger.Of', 'three', 'enjoyed', 'storyline', 'following', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'daughter', 'most', 'followed', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Truthfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'Jude', 'Law', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'was', 'bad', 'anything', 'just', 'felt', 'more', 'slowed', 'movie', 'down', 'anything', 'rather', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'focus', 'medical', 'teams', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'vaccine', 'Mitch', 'daughter', 'surviving', 'social', 'order', 'began', 'breaking', 'down', 'even', 'what', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'character', 'did', 'virtually', 'held', 'hostage', 'Chinese', 'village.The', 'movie', 'respective', 'characters', 'continue', 'trying', 'live', 'work', 'everything', 'breaking', 'down', 'panic', 'rioting', 'looting', 'begins', 'break', 'out', 'United', 'States', 'thought', 'Contagion', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'fear', 'public', 'giving', 'off', 'sense', 'dread.The', 'acting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'quality', 'HDTV', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'no', 'complaints', 'there', 'One', 'only', 'real', 'complaints', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'Mitch', 'reaction', 'wife', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'deaths', 'One', 'would', 'expect', 'having', 'two', 'loved', 'ones', 'die', 'so', 'closely', 'other', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'child', 'have', 'huge', 'impact', 'Instead', 'other', 'scene', 'two', 'anger', 'crying', 'not', 'even', 'hard', 'crying', 'seemed', 'take', 'deaths', '.rather', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'actually', 'Just', 'something', 'noticed.I', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'as', 'creepy', 'word', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'here', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'actually', 'happen', 'exactly', 'shown', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'look', 'out', 'window', 'one', 'morning', 'see', 'zombies', 'marching', 'home', 'masked', 'serial', 'killer', 'chasing', 'global', 'pandemic', 'killing', 'millions', 'not', 'only', 'CAN', 'happen', 'HAS', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'happen', 'AGAIN.Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'wash', 'hands']",N/A

Her young son dies shortly afterwards. Within a few days the mystery virus has struck down tens of thousands more and the world is looking at a rerun of the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, only much worse. There is no known cure. Social order starts to break down and looters rip through stores, looking for food, water and a homeopathic medicine they think might save them. This is where we are half an hour into Contagion and the director hasn't missed a beat. We're gripped. What could go wrong next? What calamities await? Unfortunately, the film starts spinning out of control at this point, and by the end has turned into a shapeless mess which we don't care about. One reason is a sure-footed script that stumbles badly, another is a cast of characters we don't care about (they keep dying off), while another is the irritating fact that the director is trying to cram too much in. He wants to show us what happens, as well as what might happen, plus the personal conflict the (two-dimensional) characters are experiencing, plus what the long-term implications are, and let's not forget the protesters who are furious at what they see as official inaction and incompetence, and we have to find space for the so-called independent journalist-cum-blogger who casts doubt on the authorities' attempts to find a cure while peddling the homeopathic cure and hang on, is he independent, or is he shilling for a firm and making big bucks out of it? Let's also not forget the lone father trying to keep his teen daughter away from her possibly infected boyfriend.

We see researchers and CDC officials (Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne) frantically race against time to find a vaccine; a CDC doctor (Kate Winslet) who actually goes out into the field to fight the disease; a sensationalist journalist (Jude Law) who claims the vaccine already exists, but Big Pharma is suppressing this info because it wants to make trillions in profits; an international medical researcher (Marion Cotillard) actually kidnapped in Asia and held hostage so a village can receive the vaccine; and a husband (Matt Damon) who meets the contagion head on when his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns from a business trip (monkey business, it turns out) in Asia, and becomes one of the first victims of the new disease.And along the way, society as we know it goes to Hades in a hand basket.  Time to lock 'n load.This is a gripping, taut, and (again) highly believable depiction of a mega-outbreak of a deadly disease, a disease killing millions.  The cast gives terrific performances, but (*spoiler!*) don't get too comfortable with several of them, for they aren't around long.  One star off because CONTAGION has too many subplots and story lines to keep track of; the film often gets in its own way.  Having said that, CONTAGION is still one grand dramatic thriller.

This story is simply a diary of an event as seen from the perspective of varying types of citizens. You have a typical family, you have a possibly paranoid sensationalistic journalist/blogger, you have a doctor, you have government, and you have a multi-national body.This movie examines how from nothing, from a plain-ole-yesterday, how do each of these entities realize what is/might be happending, and how they are affected, and how they react as they learn more and more.I mean, as theater-goes WE know the title is contagion, but none of these people know anything in the begining. A family is going to experience and relate to initial events dissimilar to how the W.H.O. is going to, which is dissimilar to how FEMA will, or our Military, etc Each body has their own responsiblities to ""run the possibilities and plan"". The movie even includes a poor asian village, to see how they feel, so sompletely disconnected from immediate assitance (compared to other entities mentioned).So no, it's not fast paced because real life would not be. There are no supermen coming to save the day with virus laser-guns, there is no easy anecdote in all senses of the word. This movies was, quite pointedly, real-life perspectives of a very real and very dangerous situation.Propaganda? None whatesoever. Sure, there were innuendos, but that is because one of the characters - quite rightly so - was a journalist who is pretty much all journalists today. I mean look around, anything that happens is spun every which way in the news for the viewers/hits.I can't even imagine why people are claiming propaganda.

1504604,A2U4US8N80LY8W,B005WFWVL4,D. Reed,"[1, 2]","As someone who studies infectious diseases like flu for a living, this movie was a long time coming. As good as Hollywood is likely to get as far as a 'realistic' portrayal of a pandemic. Certainly much more realistic than 'Outbreak'. I have minor quibbles with the rate of spread of the disease as well as the relative ease and speed with which a vaccine is developed, manufactured and used. But it's nothing like the liters and liters of antisera that Dustin Hoffman gets out of one little tiny monkey in a matter of minutes in 'Outbreak'.Was it a possible candidate for Best Picture? No. As others have noted, the film has a decided lack of focus which makes it more difficult to care about the characters as much as you might like. In trying to portray all aspects of the pandemic, it reaches for more than it should. It might have been better served to focus on one story (ala Legend or Walking Dead) and leave the rest alone. And I don't think it would have mattered which one - Matt Damon's story was certainly foremost but the others were potentially interesting. Esp. Marion Cotillard tracking down the spread of the disease from Hong Kong and being taken hostage. As previously mentioned, the spread is too fast and the vaccine developed too fast to be entirely realistic. The speed with which time passes is also difficult to grasp and at times weeks or months appear to have passed but to the viewer it feels like hours or maybe days. And it's obvious the producers realized this and that's why they added the handy time scale in text at times although it still doesn't help with the disorientation.Not that there aren't aspects to like.

It does a great job of progressing from what appears to be a hopeless situation for some characters and the world in general to the progression to a better (???) outcome.  The subtle twists for the future of some characters that never get expounded upon gave another aspect I love in some movies.

1504608,A28DGKRLV9JTTA,B005WFWVL4,Edward,"[5, 8]","Hollywood studios have new policies that prevent movie producers from offering seven figure deals to A-List stars.  This is due to overall declining revenue per film on average.  Therefore, in order to get A-List talent in a film, producers have created a new technique: offering A-List stars a few tens of thousands for a single day's work.  No script memorization - if you look for it in this film, you will notice that every A-List star is reading from off-scene queue cards or in-scene notes.  Very little or no wardrobe changes - often wearing their own clothes - which you can see here.  And, often, the film crew will come to the star and shoot wherever they are under any weather conditions, which you see in this film.  Often little or no makeup.  The stars usually never read the script and receive a Director's briefing a few minutes before their shoot.The advantage is that you get lots and lots of A-List talent, which you see in this film.  The drawback is that you cannot weave your storyline around any one (or few) characters because you will only have them for a day or two.  Scripts have to be carefully crafted to optimize time and location.This is one of those films, and you will see films like this more and more frequently as time goes on.  From other reviews here you can see the effects: the plot fails to be engaging because there are no characters we empathize with, and no character development because there is no time for it, and little over-arching story.  The stars are on the A-List for a reason, so we get the benefit of their outstanding performances, but they are never put in the position to have to stretch because there is no time for it.With that said, and the complexity of shooting a multi-cast movie from day to day, I give this film's creators four stars.  The plot and plot devices are believable.  The death toll is horrendous, but is rational and believable based on past plagues.  The reactions of all the various players does not go outside the norm of human behavior.  There are no heroes, saints, devils, evil people nor invincible warriors, and the resolution follows all the way through to a believable conclusion.Due to the way this film was made, it could never be a box-office sensation, but it was made well for what it had to work with and you can bet highly profitable for the studio.",4,"A ""multi-cast"" movie",1325721600,"01 5, 2012",2012,2344,"['Hollywood', 'studios', 'have', 'new', 'policies', 'prevent', 'movie', 'producers', 'offering', 'seven', 'figure', 'deals', 'A-List', 'stars', 'due', 'overall', 'declining', 'revenue', 'film', 'average', 'Therefore', 'order', 'get', 'A-List', 'talent', 'film', 'producers', 'have', 'created', 'new', 'technique', 'offering', 'A-List', 'few', 'tens', 'thousands', 'single', 'day', 'work', 'script', 'memorization', 'look', 'film', 'will', 'notice', 'A-List', 'star', 'reading', 'off-scene', 'queue', 'cards', 'in-scene', 'notes', 'Very', 'little', 'wardrobe', 'often', 'wearing', 'own', 'clothes', 'can', 'see', 'here', 'often', 'film', 'crew', 'will', 'come', 'star', 'shoot', 'wherever', 'are', 'weather', 'conditions', 'see', 'film', 'Often', 'little', 'makeup', 'stars', 'usually', 'never', 'read', 'script', 'receive', 'Director', 'briefing', 'few', 'minutes', 'shoot.The', 'advantage', 'get', 'lots', 'lots', 'A-List', 'talent', 'see', 'film', 'drawback', 'can', 'not', 'weave', 'storyline', 'one', 'few', 'characters', 'will', 'only', 'have', 'day', 'two', 'Scripts', 'have', 'be', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'optimize', 'time', 'location.This', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'see', 'films', 'more', 'more', 'frequently', 'time', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'can', 'see', 'effects', 'plot', 'be', 'engaging', 'are', 'characters', 'empathize', 'character', 'development', 'time', 'little', 'over-arching', 'story', 'stars', 'are', 'A-List', 'reason', 'get', 'benefit', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'are', 'never', 'put', 'position', 'have', 'stretch', 'time', 'it.With', 'said', 'complexity', 'shooting', 'multi-cast', 'movie', 'day', 'day', 'give', 'film', 'creators', 'four', 'stars', 'plot', 'plot', 'devices', 'are', 'believable', 'death', 'toll', 'horrendous', 'rational', 'believable', 'based', 'past', 'plagues', 'reactions', 'various', 'players', 'not', 'go', 'norm', 'human', 'behavior', 'are', 'heroes', 'saints', 'devils', 'evil', 'people', 'invincible', 'warriors', 'resolution', 'way', 'believable', 'conclusion.Due', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'box-office', 'sensation', 'was', 'made', 'well', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'can', 'bet', 'highly', 'profitable', 'studio']",N/A

1504615,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B005WFWVL4,Erik North,"[1, 1]","The fears and realities of global viruses have always been in existence since travel was basically invented; but with the explosion of all kinds of technology and modes of transportation, those fears and realities have exploded.  Even as far back as 1918, a virulent strain known as the Spanish flu killed 800,000 people in the United States alone, and as many as eighteen million more across the world.  In our time, such things as bird flu, swine flu, SARS, and H1N1 have put health officials in all corners of the world on edge, especially when it is found out that the strains often develop immunities to the very vaccines we use to treat them.  This is the subject dealt with in CONTAGION, a solid medical science fiction/suspense docudrama that has a degree of realism fueled by a combination of fact and speculation.Like more than a few disaster epics of the 1970s, CONTAGION puts a large cast of all-stars in an insightful, disturbing, and highly charged situation as an unnamed virus, which begins its deadly spread throughout the world as the result of an innocuous occurrence involving a female executive (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong spreads into America, infecting just a few people at first, but pretty soon exploding into a health crisis the likes of which no country has ever seen.  Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet are the doctors based out of CDC headquarters in Atlanta who try to develop the appropriate vaccines for this strain, which, like so many flu bugs, has a genetic code to it seemingly meant to ward off any kind of medicine applied to it.  Marion Cottilard is the French doctor sent by the World Health Organization (WHO) to Hong Kong to track the exact origin of the flu.  Jude Law portrays a conspiracy blogger who contends that the CDC and governments all over the world have the antidote in their hands but are not willing to share it so as to cash in on the deaths of what eventually turn out to be tens of millions of people.  Matt Damon portrays Paltrow's grieving husband who has to stand watch over his two motherless children who might be infected, even though he himself already has the right amount of antibodies to avoid catching the strain.While there have been more than a few ""virus/disease"" films over the years, CONTAGION seems to be the most realistic of the bunch, and, as a result, probably the most frightening.  The tendency to have the entire cast go into hysterics over people dropping dead like flies all around is wisely avoided by director Steven Soderbergh, whose credits include ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC.  Instead, he opts for a docudrama-like approach, with numerous sequences of hand-held camera movements that make the drama seem as realistic as possible without dipping into technique for technique's sake.  The situation is highly realistic, as anyone who has studied the history of previous viral epidemics will easily attest to; not only are such pandemics possible today, they are practically inevitable when taken into account the way technology and travel have evolved, and given the everyday habits of people that can lead to viruses being spread around without anyone knowing about it until it has already happened to them.Instead of being another scary Hollywood shocker (though it is definitely scary), CONTAGION largely succeeds at putting up a plausible scenario for an infectious disease mutating into a worldwide problem in which a cure can't come fast enough.  Furthermore, it also urges us to think about how the entire world's population has become so interdependent on others in times of crises, such as viral epidemics of the kind depicted in this film.",5,Going Viral (Literally!),1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,3643,"['fears', 'realities', 'global', 'viruses', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'existence', 'travel', 'was', 'basically', 'invented', 'explosion', 'kinds', 'technology', 'modes', 'transportation', 'fears', 'realities', 'have', 'exploded', 'Even', 'far', 'back', '1918', 'virulent', 'strain', 'known', 'Spanish', 'flu', 'killed', '800,000', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'alone', 'as', 'many', 'eighteen', 'million', 'more', 'world', 'time', 'such', 'things', 'bird', 'flu', 'swine', 'flu', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'have', 'put', 'health', 'officials', 'corners', 'world', 'edge', 'especially', 'when', 'found', 'strains', 'often', 'develop', 'immunities', 'very', 'use', 'treat', 'subject', 'dealt', 'CONTAGION', 'solid', 'medical', 'science', 'fiction/suspense', 'docudrama', 'degree', 'realism', 'fueled', 'combination', 'fact', 'speculation.Like', 'more', 'few', 'disaster', 'epics', '1970s', 'CONTAGION', 'large', 'cast', 'all-stars', 'insightful', 'disturbing', 'highly', 'charged', 'situation', 'unnamed', 'virus', 'deadly', 'spread', 'world', 'result', 'innocuous', 'occurrence', 'involving', 'female', 'executive', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'America', 'infecting', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'first', 'pretty', 'soon', 'exploding', 'health', 'crisis', 'likes', 'country', 'ever', 'seen', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'are', 'doctors', 'based', 'CDC', 'headquarters', 'Atlanta', 'who', 'try', 'develop', 'appropriate', 'vaccines', 'strain', 'so', 'many', 'flu', 'bugs', 'genetic', 'code', 'seemingly', 'meant', 'ward', 'off', 'kind', 'medicine', 'applied', 'Marion', 'Cottilard', 'French', 'doctor', 'sent', 'World', 'Health', 'Organization', 'WHO', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'track', 'exact', 'origin', 'flu', 'Jude', 'Law', 'conspiracy', 'blogger', 'who', 'CDC', 'governments', 'world', 'have', 'antidote', 'hands', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'share', 'so', 'cash', 'deaths', 'what', 'eventually', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'tens', 'millions', 'people', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Paltrow', 'grieving', 'husband', 'who', 'stand', 'watch', 'two', 'motherless', 'children', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'infected', 'even', 'already', 'right', 'amount', 'antibodies', 'avoid', 'catching', 'strain.While', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'few', 'virus/disease', 'films', 'years', 'CONTAGION', 'be', 'most', 'realistic', 'bunch', 'result', 'probably', 'most', 'frightening', 'tendency', 'have', 'entire', 'cast', 'go', 'hysterics', 'people', 'dropping', 'dead', 'flies', 'around', 'wisely', 'avoided', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'credits', 'include', 'ERIN', 'BROCKOVICH', 'TRAFFIC', 'Instead', 'docudrama-like', 'approach', 'numerous', 'sequences', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'movements', 'make', 'drama', 'seem', 'as', 'realistic', 'possible', 'dipping', 'technique', 'technique', 'sake', 'situation', 'highly', 'realistic', 'anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'history', 'previous', 'viral', 'epidemics', 'will', 'easily', 'attest', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'such', 'pandemics', 'possible', 'today', 'are', 'practically', 'inevitable', 'when', 'taken', 'account', 'way', 'technology', 'travel', 'have', 'evolved', 'given', 'everyday', 'habits', 'people', 'can', 'lead', 'viruses', 'being', 'spread', 'anyone', 'knowing', 'already', 'happened', 'them.Instead', 'being', 'scary', 'Hollywood', 'shocker', 'definitely', 'scary', 'CONTAGION', 'largely', 'putting', 'up', 'plausible', 'scenario', 'infectious', 'disease', 'mutating', 'worldwide', 'problem', 'cure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'fast', 'enough', 'Furthermore', 'also', 'think', 'how', 'entire', 'world', 'population', 'become', 'so', 'interdependent', 'others', 'times', 'crises', 'such', 'viral', 'epidemics', 'kind', 'depicted', 'film']",N/A
1504616,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B005WFWVL4,e. verrillo,"[8, 19]","The premise of this movie was fairly straightforward. A virulent virus, much like the Spanish flu of 1918 that killed somewhere between 40 and 80 million people, is spreading rapidly, endangering the life of Kate Winslet and all of humanity. Normally, I would hunker down with a bowl of popcorn and a quart of ginger ale to watch a movie like this. But I found myself getting very bored after only a few minutes.The first problem with this movie is that it was horribly written. There are whole sections in which the characters say nothing, but just move their mouths to the accompaniment of tense music. Those were the good parts. The actual dialogue was so devoid of emotion that silence was preferable. And the characters were so bland and undeveloped that it was impossible to care whether they lived or died.The second major problem was the premise. Supposedly, an infected bat bites a banana which a pig in Hong Kong then eats, and when the pig is slaughtered, the cook who prepares it for consumption doesn't wash his hands, and then shakes hands with Gwyneth Paltrow, who touches her face and then gets sick and dies. What kind of virus is this? It can be transmitted via saliva like a herpesvirus, survive going through a pig's GI tract like an enterovirus, end up in the blood somehow like blood-borne encephalitis-causing viruses, then get transmitted again via an object (hands), and then enter the body through the mucous membranes (mouth and/or nose), somehow end up in the lungs, and then migrate to the nervous system. It was as if the writers wanted to have it all - a virus which could be transmitted equally by saliva, feces, and blood, and which could survive both interferon-containing saliva and the depredations of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, as well as live outside the host on various objects - and which can kill you in a few days.If, in fact, a virulent neurotropic virus could be transmitted in this casual a manner we would all be dead. (Spanish flu, by the way, only killed people who had previously caught a different flu. When the two viruses combined in their hosts they formed a fatal new virus.) We are surrounded by viruses - of all types - and the reason they haven't killed us all is because viruses mutate rather quickly into less lethal forms so as not to destroy their hosts. We may not need them, but they need us. What neither of us need is this movie.",1,"Very bad writing, and some equally bad science",1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,2401,"['premise', 'movie', 'was', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'virulent', 'virus', 'much', 'Spanish', 'flu', '1918', 'killed', 'somewhere', '40', '80', 'million', 'people', 'spreading', 'rapidly', 'endangering', 'life', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'humanity', 'Normally', 'would', 'hunker', 'down', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'quart', 'ginger', 'ale', 'watch', 'movie', 'found', 'getting', 'very', 'bored', 'only', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'first', 'problem', 'movie', 'was', 'horribly', 'written', 'are', 'whole', 'sections', 'characters', 'say', 'nothing', 'just', 'move', 'mouths', 'accompaniment', 'tense', 'music', 'were', 'good', 'parts', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'was', 'so', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'silence', 'was', 'preferable', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'bland', 'undeveloped', 'was', 'impossible', 'care', 'lived', 'died.The', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'premise', 'Supposedly', 'infected', 'bat', 'banana', 'pig', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'then', 'when', 'pig', 'slaughtered', 'cook', 'who', 'consumption', ""n't"", 'wash', 'hands', 'then', 'shakes', 'hands', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'who', 'face', 'then', 'sick', 'dies', 'What', 'kind', 'virus', 'can', 'be', 'transmitted', 'saliva', 'herpesvirus', 'survive', 'going', 'pig', 'GI', 'tract', 'enterovirus', 'end', 'up', 'blood', 'somehow', 'blood-borne', 'encephalitis-causing', 'viruses', 'then', 'get', 'transmitted', 'again', 'object', 'hands', 'then', 'enter', 'body', 'mucous', 'membranes', 'mouth', 'and/or', 'nose', 'somehow', 'end', 'up', 'lungs', 'then', 'migrate', 'nervous', 'system', 'was', 'writers', 'wanted', 'have', 'virus', 'could', 'be', 'transmitted', 'equally', 'saliva', 'feces', 'blood', 'could', 'survive', 'interferon-containing', 'saliva', 'depredations', 'hydrochloric', 'acid', 'stomach', 'as', 'well', 'live', 'host', 'various', 'objects', 'can', 'kill', 'few', 'days.If', 'fact', 'virulent', 'neurotropic', 'virus', 'could', 'be', 'transmitted', 'casual', 'manner', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'dead', 'Spanish', 'flu', 'way', 'only', 'killed', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'caught', 'different', 'flu', 'When', 'two', 'viruses', 'combined', 'hosts', 'formed', 'fatal', 'new', 'virus', 'are', 'surrounded', 'viruses', 'types', 'reason', 'have', ""n't"", 'killed', 'viruses', 'mutate', 'rather', 'quickly', 'less', 'lethal', 'forms', 'so', 'not', 'destroy', 'hosts', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'need', 'What', 'need', 'movie']",N/A

Watching one person after another get sick and die does not create a premise interesting enough to keep you awake; as the film is linear. Several other films handle the situation with more excitement, although not necessarily accuracy. The absolutely best pandemic film ever made was 'Virus' made by the Japanese in 1980. Virus includes a dual pandemic virus/nuclear holocaust scenario, which is not viable as plutonium has a half life of 50,000 years and no one would survive such a holocaust! Contagion has several real-life scenarios; primarily that getting vacinated would be a political thing...the rich, military and powerful getting the vaccine before the masses, who are dying by the millions. What all these films fail to relate is that ALL governments worldwide are run by the rich, the militaries and the powerfully-corrupt of individual countries. One thing all these governments have in common is that they promote the wholesale deaths of their own countrymen. India, China and Russia for instance do nothing when earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, famine, droughts or any natural disaster take place killing millions. It is called 'natural birth control/natural population control'. Only the well-to-do are saved, while the rest perish. The US is no different. Our government rarely responds to catastrophes until most have perished. They put toxic fluorine in our water and spray us with toxic biologicals, plutonium and chemicals in chemtrails sprayed from air force and NATO aircraft. This film also pushes getting flu shots, which many consider biologically fatal. This keeps the population down, kills the bees necessary for pollination and makes more money for the corrupt medical community. The film does reiterate a scenario, which has some fact: corrupt pharmaceutical companies withholding vaccines for the highest dollar...or even creating a rougue virus spread within the population, for which only they have the antidote! These scenarios are very real and are commonplace. For instance, the US government has routinely withheld disability monies to US veterans with proven military-caused maladies, waiting for them to die off so they won't have to pay them.

1504625,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005WFWVL4,Grady Harp,"[10, 13]","CONTAGION is an important film for the general public to see. It addresses the etiology of contagious diseases, how they begin, how they are introduced in to the world population, how they can be viewed as instances of germ warfare, how they are examined by both the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, how they are disseminated, the processes required for creating a vaccine, how the treatments are managed, how individuals are affected both directly and indirectly, who decides the priorities of treating large number of people around the globe, and how in the face of a world crisis certain evil people can take advantage of the fear and make millions off unsuspecting terrified people. Yes, this information is in articles readily available for public consumption, but nothing surpasses a well-written film for getting the message across in a memorable way. Writer Scott Z. Burns produced the script and Steven Soderbergh mold this story with great skill. The cast is filled with major actors but in a film of this size few of them are given much screen time.Interestingly the film begins with the marker 'Day 2' and the significance of that move is held until the film's satisfying end. Beth Emhoff (Gweneth Paltrow) is returning home form a business trip in Hong Kong, has a layover in Chicago where she calls her husband Mitch (Matt Damon) informing him of the delay. She arrives home ill and son is dead form a seizure disorder brought on by encephalitis - and infection of unknown type that has spread to her brain. Soon after her death her son dies leaving Mitch terrified by the unknown disease. The US Center for Disease control is headed by Dr. Cheever (Lawrence Fishbine) who engages Dr Mears (Kate Winslet) and Dr. Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) and Dr. Sussman (Elliott Gould) to investigate the disease. The World Heath Organization represented by Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) becomes involved as the point of origin of the disease seems to be Hong Kong: her attempt to help the Chinese is at first assisted by young Sun Feng (Chin Han) until the Chinese forces decide to hold her hostage until the vaccine can be sent to save a province in China. As the contagious disease is studied, identified, and a vaccine becomes available some smarmy people such as 'journalist' Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) goes on the internet blogging the use of forsythia as the cure, bilking millions of dollars around the world for his fake cure. The story is both catastrophic and immediate as Soderbergh intentionally develops personal stories to demonstrate how a severe contagious disease can impact both throngs of peoples and individuals as well.The supporting cast is filled with fine actors and the momentum of the story is almost intolerable fast. Steven Soderbergh provides his own cinematography and the electrifying musical score is by Cliff Martinez. This is a fine cinematic accomplishment and one that should be seen by every citizen in the world - for many reasons.

The biological sciences were accurately represented. They even tossed in a bit of alternative medicine to satisfy that audience. And, the social sciences were well represented in showing likely human responses to a sudden rapidly spreading infectious agent.

1504628,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005WFWVL4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","Was it mean that I took my hypochondriac buddy to this film and now he won't leave his house? With CONTAGION, director Steven Soderbergh presents an alarmingly believable account of how a global pandemic might fall out. It's frightening how vulnerable and exposed we all are to catching a virus. The slightest contact... listen, I'm no germaphobe but I'm calling a moratorium on chest bumps with my homies.I've always been fascinated with bio-thriller films, from 1971'sThe Andromeda Strainto 1995'sOutbreak (Keep Case Packaging). I eat up that aspect of the science procedural. Soderbergh lifts his TRAFFIC formula and applies it to CONTAGION. We track an ensemble cast composed of A-list stars as they travel down their respective (and interconnected) story arcs. Not that the virus gives a what that these are some of Hollywood's most recognizable names. It kills all its victims impersonally. And I think that was Soderbergh's point. No one is immune (except, as it turns out, for one person).Hong Kong has given us a wealth of classic kung fu movies. It's provided the backdrop to THE WORLD OF SUSIE WONG. Some of the tallest, most scintillating skyscrapers can be found in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is also where this supremely malevolent viral strain originates. From Hong Kong, CONTAGION follows a traveling American businesswoman (Gwyneth Paltrow) - who later the medical community would designate as ""Patient Zero"" - for as long as she's around (she's not around long), as well as the people with whom she comes into contact (they're not around for long, either). From these carriers, the disease multiplies and mutates and infects and infects and infects. In the U.S. alone, the casualties soon number in the millions.The World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control soon deploy their brightest scientific minds (Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, and Marion Cotillard) to backtrack the virus to its source, limit its impact, and arrive at a successful treatment protocol. Except that these doctors find themselves running into further obstacles. As with other disaster films, man's innate asshatness comes into play. Mass panic, riots, lootings, violence, politics... these are all our favorite pastimes when facing apocalypse. Soderbergh, almost with a dispassionate eye, weaves several plot threads in concert, these different perspectives coalescing into a clinical blanket study on how one uncontrollable pathogen can generate a global collapse.It's really interesting viewing. Only, I wish it impacted the viewer on a more emotional level (and I don't mean the primal fear that this movie immediately invokes). Soderbergh keeps his characters low-key. You'd expect that from the cast of doctors and scientists, all of whom are trained to maintain a detached and analytic mindset. I will say that one of the most heartbreaking moments in this film is what happens to one dedicated epidemiologist when she catches the bug. Soderbergh is again driving home a point here. The epidemiologist's corpse is disposed of in a massive grave filled with other infected corpses. The stark anonymity of this is sobering and so sad.Even Matt Damon's character - who as the husband of ""Patient Zero"" represents the Everyman - for the most part adheres to repressed behavior. I did like those moments in which Damon's character lets his emotions out. I wish he'd done it more. I wish that Soderbergh had done more with Damon, had played more with that one aspect which makes Damon's character unique. The most spirited (and unlikable) role goes to Jude Law who adopts a snaggletooth and plays a slimy blogging journalist. I couldn't wait for him to start coughing and sneezing...CONTAGION is a haunting and frightening cautionary tale. It's intelligent but sterile, harrowing but on an impersonal level. I did find myself connecting to some of the characters (Damon's Mitch, Winslet's Erin Mears, Fishburne's Cheever), but only up to a point. Perhaps the images that'll stay with me are those lingering camera shots of everyday objects such as doorknobs and drinking glasses and those standup poles on the bus... How do you refrain from touching those? My buddy still won't leave his house.The DVD's 2-minute-long bonus featurette: ""CONTAGION: How a Virus Changes the World"" - a quick but informative tutorial on infectious viruses and the protocols in place to deal with them.",4,"""Don't talk to anyone.

Steven Soderbergh creates an appropriate sense of chaotic detachment, mirroring what in all likelihood would actually happen in the event of such an outbreak, and he quite realistically depicts the almost bureaucratic way in which such a pandemic would be ""managed,"" leaving us with a sense that a global viral outbreak would prove to be more than ""just"" a health crisis.

1504649,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B005WFWVL4,J from NY,"[1, 1]","With his trademark brutal realism, director Steven Soderbergh steps in with his take on the apocalyptic genre of film so popular these days.  ""Contagion"" is a film that separates itself pretty well from the 2012 syndrome so many directors like to take advantage of these days.  A virus is borne not because God wants it, not because there is someone who devised it and sent it other people in the mail, but because a few simple accidents in nature occur.  What ensues is a gruelling and very human battle against this disease, as Soderberg follows the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne), a simple man (Matt Damon) who loses his wife in the opening scene (you get to see Gwyneth Paltrow get sick and die, and unlike inSeven (New Line Platinum Series)you get to see the details).The beauty and terror of this masterfully crafted film is the lack of sentimentality.  There are heroes and villains but only *human* heroes and villains. Kate Winslet plays Dr. Ben Mears, a self sacrificing woman who travels the world to research the disease on behalf of the CDC and pays a great price.  Jude Law plays the truly chilling Alan Krumwiede, a wannabe writer/popular blogger who takes advantage of the situation for money and prestige, almost a Hitleresque figure. The performances (especially Winslet and Damon) are fantastic, and anyone who has suffered from a virus long term should see this film.  It's a bit like watching your relatives get it too, and watching how *they* would react.  Recommended.",5,"""Blogging isn't writing!

Sure, this movie had a legion of A-listers including an excellent director, yet still this movie exceeded my already high expectations.  While its pace was consistently somewhat slow, the content, in turn, was consistently interesting, socially revealing and gripping.This movie follows the outbreak of a novel and swiftly lethal virus from patient zero.  With a short incubation period, the highly contagious strain raises the CDC's concern readily ensued by the panic of the masses.  The medical community scrambles in a losing race against time as the numbers of infected and dead patients grow at a staggering pace.  Controversy, capitalism, distrust...all are likely products of slowly-solved epidemics.The cast flawlessly conveys the very best and worst of human qualities responding to a deteriorating society and economy.  Panic, desperation, fear and altruism are all tactfully delivered with humbling realism.  Adding to the already palpable emotions of the characters was the tension-setting music which, coupled with the concept of this movie, shall haunt my thoughts.

1504663,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B005WFWVL4,kacunnin,"[95, 117]","CONTAGION, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is an intensely frightening look at what really could happen should a new and unidentified virus begin to spread globally. Unfortunately, it's not a very successful film. What makes it work is its documentary-style script, which takes viewers through the spread of the virus, the reaction of both governments and everyday people, and the fear that ends up possessing the world. What makes it unsuccessful is actually the same thing - the documentary style of the film makes it almost impossible to become emotionally connected to any of the characters, most of which are played by people we know and want to care about. Because Soderbergh keeps us so detached from his characters, CONTAGION never quite jells as a truly gripping thriller.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Beth Emhof, whose business trip to Hong Kong ends up infecting her (and a lot of other people) with a mysterious and deadly virus. Her husband Mitch (Matt Damon), back home in Minneapolis, is inexplicably immune to the disease, and his horror at what happens to his wife and young step-son is palpable and gut-wrenching. Unfortunately, we see so little of Mitch (and even less of Beth) that it's hard to stay connected. Kate Winslet plays CDC doctor Erin Mears, and for a while we get caught up in her race to unravel the mysteries of this terrible virus. But the film jumps so methodically from Dr. Mears to her boss, Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne), to World Health Organization investigator Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) - and it's hard to keep up, much less get invested in these characters. On top of that, there's a very involved sub-plot about a self-serving Internet journalist (Jude Law) who mouths off about unsavory political connections between the CDC/WHO and the pharmaceutical companies, while he's trying to push a homeopathic remedy that could make him a multi-millionaire. There's also a kidnapping plot, lots of scenes of people gone amok, and a very quick resolution to the virus that is neither comprehensible nor particularly satisfying.Parts of CONTAGION are downright mesmerizing, and there's no doubt Soderbergh knows how to push the panic buttons of moviegoers already worried about H1N1, AIDS, and the latest strain of flu. I just wanted to feel more of a connection to Damon's Mitch, or Winslet's Erin Mears, or Fishburne's Cheever, or Cotillard's Leonora. Soderbergh ends CONTAGION with the kind of lack of closure that will either infuriate its audience or confirm the ultimate reality of its subject matter. Don't expect to find out what happens to everyone . . . or anyone, for that matter. Then again, maybe Soderbergh did us all a favor by keeping us distanced from his characters and not allowing us to actually wrap our proverbial arms around them. It's easier to forget about them that way. And this is definitely a film you won't want to keep thinking about in the wee hours of the morning.",3,"Frightening, realistic, but not a film you can wrap your arms around",1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,2946,"['CONTAGION', 'directed', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'intensely', 'frightening', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'could', 'happen', 'should', 'new', 'unidentified', 'virus', 'begin', 'spread', 'globally', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'very', 'successful', 'film', 'What', 'work', 'documentary-style', 'script', 'viewers', 'spread', 'virus', 'reaction', 'governments', 'everyday', 'people', 'fear', 'up', 'possessing', 'world', 'What', 'unsuccessful', 'actually', 'same', 'thing', 'documentary', 'style', 'film', 'almost', 'impossible', 'become', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'characters', 'most', 'are', 'played', 'people', 'know', 'want', 'care', 'about', 'Soderbergh', 'so', 'detached', 'characters', 'CONTAGION', 'never', 'quite', 'jells', 'truly', 'gripping', 'thriller.Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Beth', 'Emhof', 'business', 'trip', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'up', 'infecting', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'mysterious', 'deadly', 'virus', 'husband', 'Mitch', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'back', 'home', 'Minneapolis', 'inexplicably', 'immune', 'disease', 'horror', 'what', 'wife', 'young', 'step-son', 'palpable', 'gut-wrenching', 'Unfortunately', 'see', 'so', 'little', 'Mitch', 'even', 'less', 'Beth', 'hard', 'stay', 'connected', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'CDC', 'doctor', 'Erin', 'Mears', 'while', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'race', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'terrible', 'virus', 'film', 'jumps', 'so', 'methodically', 'Dr.', 'Mears', 'boss', 'Dr.', 'Ellis', 'Cheever', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'World', 'Health', 'Organization', 'investigator', 'Dr.', 'Leonora', 'Orantes', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'much', 'less', 'get', 'invested', 'characters', 'top', 'very', 'involved', 'sub-plot', 'self-serving', 'Internet', 'journalist', 'Jude', 'Law', 'who', 'mouths', 'off', 'unsavory', 'political', 'connections', 'CDC/WHO', 'pharmaceutical', 'companies', 'trying', 'push', 'homeopathic', 'remedy', 'could', 'make', 'multi-millionaire', 'also', 'kidnapping', 'plot', 'lots', 'scenes', 'people', 'gone', 'amok', 'very', 'quick', 'resolution', 'virus', 'comprehensible', 'particularly', 'satisfying.Parts', 'CONTAGION', 'are', 'downright', 'mesmerizing', 'doubt', 'Soderbergh', 'how', 'push', 'panic', 'buttons', 'moviegoers', 'already', 'worried', 'H1N1', 'AIDS', 'latest', 'strain', 'flu', 'just', 'wanted', 'feel', 'more', 'connection', 'Damon', 'Mitch', 'Winslet', 'Erin', 'Mears', 'Fishburne', 'Cheever', 'Cotillard', 'Leonora', 'Soderbergh', 'CONTAGION', 'kind', 'lack', 'closure', 'will', 'either', 'infuriate', 'audience', 'confirm', 'ultimate', 'reality', 'subject', 'matter', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'everyone', 'anyone', 'matter', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'Soderbergh', 'did', 'favor', 'keeping', 'distanced', 'characters', 'not', 'allowing', 'actually', 'wrap', 'proverbial', 'arms', 'easier', 'forget', 'way', 'definitely', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'keep', 'thinking', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning']",N/A

I don't want to spoil any surprises so I won't tell you who's who, but another beautiful woman winds up kidnapped and forced to teach Chinese schoolchildren in a remote province of China, and yet she manages to stay as drop dead gorgeous and coiffed as if she had Anouk Aimee's hairdresser combing her up after every class.  I never did figure that one out, but the implication, my wife said, is that she didn't really mind being taken hostage at all; we thought maybe she had fallen for her principal captor, or at any rate she believed him when he said he wanted only health for his village and would seize it by any means necessary.

Not this movie. I found the scenario realistic, the characters believable, no one was perfect, even the good guys. There are several big name actors, and not all of them are safe, or squeaky clean.I watched this movie because it came highly recommended by some medical professional family members. I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews saying it was boring and unrealistic and depressing. I found this movie was absolutely none of these things. I will say if you require a movie to be shoot-em-up robots or man eating aliens every five seconds to be enjoyable, this is not your movie.

The film traces the development of a mutant flu, its transmission, the response from the scientific and medical community, and possible societal consequences.The notion of zoonotic transmission of mutant flu strain lingers lack a nagging nightmare, and global interconnectedness and rapid transit via jets (think of them as disease incubators) across sets up the perfect storm. Couple that with the almost nonexistent screening for disease at airports, docks, and border crossings, and it is clear that an infectious disease outbreak in one part of the world can rapidly spread pretty much anywhere. ""Contagion"" taps into that fear and as the film shows in some of its strongest and well-crafted sections, in just a matter of days and weeks, a global pandemic could occur.Its initial depiction of the public health response to such an event seem realistic as epidemiologists plot the rate and route of transmission and infection, field staff try to cope with organizing a response as the health system is soon overwhelmed, and researchers beak out their microscopes and centrifuges.But this section is also the weakest part of the film. Public health researchers would actually be swarming the labs and facilities, not working in lonely pairs. The CDC director would not be calling his from a dark, empty room like the film's staged setting. The amount of activity would make a beehive in midsummer seem relaxed, and the film flubs this portrayal.The social and economic fabric would likely ravel to some degree, possibly as shown in the film. Desperate people would hoard food and drugs, other desperate people would loot, kill, and kidnap, and the healthy would in large measure shun the sick. Misinformation would proliferate via the Internet (e.g., the forsythia cure), and schools and workplaces would shut down. (Did anyone else keep waiting for the power to go off and wonder what Matt Damon and his daughter were finding to eat?)In real life, military-enforced quarantines and curfews might help curtail this breakdown---or perhaps fuel it---in some areas.I understand that movies cannot operate at the same pace as real-life, so the lack of temporal realism did not bother me that much---unlike the often pounding, jarring soundtrack that required keeping my remote available at all times.""Contagion"" falls squarely in the middle of the pack, interesting enough, packed full of potential, but never quite good enough to trigger my ""willing suspension of disbelief.""",3,"Middle of the pack movie, interesting but not quite realistic",1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2574,"['film', 'Contagion', 'plays', 'media-fed', 'fears', 'what', 'might', 'transpire', 'global', 'pandemic', 'film', 'development', 'mutant', 'flu', 'transmission', 'response', 'scientific', 'medical', 'community', 'possible', 'societal', 'consequences.The', 'notion', 'zoonotic', 'transmission', 'mutant', 'flu', 'strain', 'lingers', 'lack', 'nagging', 'nightmare', 'global', 'interconnectedness', 'rapid', 'transit', 'jets', 'think', 'disease', 'incubators', 'up', 'perfect', 'storm', 'Couple', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'screening', 'disease', 'airports', 'docks', 'border', 'crossings', 'clear', 'infectious', 'disease', 'outbreak', 'one', 'part', 'world', 'can', 'rapidly', 'spread', 'pretty', 'much', 'anywhere', 'Contagion', 'fear', 'film', 'shows', 'strongest', 'well-crafted', 'sections', 'just', 'matter', 'days', 'weeks', 'global', 'pandemic', 'could', 'occur.Its', 'initial', 'depiction', 'public', 'health', 'response', 'event', 'seem', 'realistic', 'epidemiologists', 'plot', 'rate', 'route', 'transmission', 'infection', 'field', 'staff', 'try', 'cope', 'organizing', 'response', 'health', 'system', 'soon', 'overwhelmed', 'researchers', 'beak', 'out', 'microscopes', 'centrifuges.But', 'section', 'also', 'weakest', 'part', 'film', 'Public', 'health', 'researchers', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'swarming', 'labs', 'facilities', 'not', 'working', 'lonely', 'pairs', 'CDC', 'director', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'calling', 'dark', 'empty', 'room', 'film', 'staged', 'setting', 'amount', 'activity', 'would', 'make', 'beehive', 'midsummer', 'seem', 'relaxed', 'film', 'flubs', 'social', 'economic', 'fabric', 'would', 'likely', 'ravel', 'degree', 'possibly', 'shown', 'film', 'Desperate', 'people', 'would', 'hoard', 'food', 'drugs', 'other', 'desperate', 'people', 'would', 'loot', 'kill', 'kidnap', 'healthy', 'would', 'large', 'measure', 'shun', 'sick', 'Misinformation', 'would', 'proliferate', 'Internet', 'e.g.', 'forsythia', 'cure', 'schools', 'workplaces', 'would', 'shut', 'down', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'keep', 'waiting', 'power', 'go', 'off', 'wonder', 'what', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'daughter', 'were', 'finding', 'eat', 'real', 'life', 'military-enforced', 'quarantines', 'curfews', 'might', 'help', 'curtail', 'breakdown', '-or', 'perhaps', 'fuel', '-in', 'areas.I', 'understand', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'operate', 'same', 'pace', 'real-life', 'lack', 'temporal', 'realism', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'much', 'often', 'pounding', 'jarring', 'soundtrack', 'required', 'keeping', 'remote', 'available', 'times', 'Contagion', 'squarely', 'middle', 'pack', 'interesting', 'enough', 'packed', 'full', 'potential', 'never', 'quite', 'good', 'enough', 'trigger', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief']",N/A

Somewhere in the world the wrong pig met the wrong bat and a new, highly contagious strain of deadly virus was born.  Unknowingly, Beth is its first victim, infected while on a business trip.  Within hours of her arrival home in Minneapolis, people who came into contact with her are either dead or dying and thousands of others around the world have become infected.  Samples have been collected and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization whose job it is to figure out what in the world is happening.The world is unprepared for this lethal virus.  By day 18, the severity of the outbreak is clear and the social structure starts to deteriorate.  Cities are quarantined, curfews imposed, the dead are buried in mass graves, food is in short supply, and riots erupt.  With no vaccine and no protection and a 25% mortality rate, the scenario is definitely worst case.  Laurence Fishburne plays Dr. Ellis Cheever, the presiding CDC official everyone turns to for reassurance and answers.We've seen similar scenarios many times on film but not quite in this way.  In ""Contagion,"" the science takes center stage.  The science is spot on, it's as real as it gets, and the scientists and researchers are portrayed as the heroes they really are.  The movie accurately portrays how they do their jobs, how passionate they are, how they personally react to a scary situation and how extraordinarily tough and dangerous the work is.  The pressure is intense.  The truth is scary.  From all the experts, it's all a matter of when, not if.How do the people involved in disease investigations mitigate the damage as quickly as possible?  How do they communicate the threat without causing fear and panic?  How much information is the public entitled to know?  How do they handle misconceptions and disinformation which can spread like a disease on the web? As Dr. Sanjay Gupta puts it in the bonus section, ""information itself is a transmissible disease.  It can cause a lot of damage.  It spreads very, very quickly and in some cases people can die from it.""I was both entertained and informed.  To be forewarned is to be forearmed.

He took the best elements and creatively expanded on every level and every aspect. From the synth/electro soundtrack to the medically accurate plot, from the documentary-esque cinematography to the governmental reaction - he developed a vastly updated story for our times. I suspect Michael Crichton would be so proud.It doesn't take fear mongering to recognize Truth. And humans, who are forever cursed with a single lifetime of memory, are not prepared for a true global pandemic. The truth is - we never will be.I'll give you a real-life situation. As I write this it's January 5, 2012. One of the big local stories here is the closing of two hospitals. One of which serves a large portion of our island community. Its sister operation was the only certified transplant center for the state - currently, there isn't any place to do transplants of any kind short of flying six or seven hours to the continental US.However, that's not the 'big' news. It's this: Already the emergency rooms of every single hospital on this island is overwhelmed. There are now seventeen stories that has made national news which detail the problem. There are too many emergencies for the the entire ER system to accommodate. All because two hospitals closed down. Keep in mind, there's nothing ""happening"" now. What the system is experiencing is simple overload, nothing more, nothing less. Just the day-to-day general crises one faces for a population of 900,000 people.So, the question is: What would happen during a biological crisis as was depicted in the film when up to 30% of the population could be incapacitated and the rest ruthlessly desperate for medical help? Can you imagine it? What would the medical community do?I can guarantee several things the film accurately depicts. Here's one: The nurses union would strike. I'm certain they'll find some coldly logical and totally legal reason, but fear is what will be driving their desire to not go to work. It happened before - during the initial days of the AIDS Crisis. No doubt there'll be heroes who step up, but the majority will quietly (and readily) accept their union position. What is a nurses strike going to do the medical system? Can you imagine?And the problems are just starting. I won't even get into how little food is actually in the pipeline for large metropolitan cities. Especially large cities that are entirely dependent on a majority of food being imported to its populace.Given the way our lives are now completely interconnected, and in so many ways dependent, on one another - from food to commerce - the concept of a ""plan of action"" is quite honestly a self-delusion at best and at worst - a lie. A lie that is told to us because we need that semblance of control. When the next sickness comes, anyone not living completely off the grid with absolutely no other human contact, will be negatively affected - one way or another.'Contagion' delivers a true picture of a disease and its life as it interdicts with our own. Terrifyingly scary - yes. But I'm grateful to Director Soderberg for spreading, no pun intended, the message. Sadly, entertainment seems to be the only proven methodology for this kind of knowledge to reach the masses. Can it help? Don't know. But it can't hurt.And I hope that mocking people as ""germaphobes"" - another form of self-delusion - ends with this film. Get a clue, shut up, and repeatedly wash your hands. Cover your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing - and then wash your hands. Don't rub your eyes with your fingers - and wash your hands again. Stay home if you're sick. And wash your hands again.Outstanding film. Watch it - remember - and learn.Personal Note: I broke my own rule and started to read other reviews before posting my own. There's a reviewer who goes by 'Rachel' - who succinctly describes the type of human who lives within his/her own lifetime of memory. Pathetic conspiracy nut, and honestly, kinda scary.Ironically, the slimy narcissist played by Jude Law, the so-called blogging ""journalist"", is her representation in the film.Again, The Truth.Personal Note: Loved seeing Eliot Gould in a small, but pivotal role.

1504689,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B005WFWVL4,M. Bullions,"[3, 4]","Not a lot scares me, when it comes to movies, anyway. I can watch the goriest horror movie, and not be scared, even in the slightest. But ""Contagion"" got under my skin. It has more effect than even the most well-done horror movie, yet, it's not really a horror movie at all. It's mostly a psychological disaster film, and at one point, it feels like something of a docudrama, and then it morphs into a humane psychology story, and has overtones of the power of paranoia and fear that start when the film begins, and don't end until the last, satisfying moments.""Contagion"" is director Steven Soderbergh's first feature this year. A few years ago, he directed two films in the same year, Matt Damon comedy-thriller studio-produced vehicle ""The Informant!"" and porn star Sasha Grey's first mainstream (albeit indie) film, ""The Girlfriend Experience"". This year, he repeats himself, doing two films in the same year, this, and the upcoming independent action thriller ""Haywire"". I'm intrigued to see that one as well, but I can't see it being any better than ""Contagion"".""Contagion"" scared the living crap out of me. It follows characters, living throughout the world, all effected by a mysterious pandemic that threatens the lives of everyone. It's something like bird flu, but not quite. It has the worldwide reaction that H1N1 had on the world, but worse. It becomes a government conspiracy tale, that proves that something of this catastrophic weight is not a cut-and-dry kind of thing. There are twists coming from each imaginable angle. The biggest mystery is how this thing began, which isn't ignored, like I thought it would be.One thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it, is a lot of big names. Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Everybody brings more to the table than you expect them to. Each character's story becomes vital to how the story unfolds, and, even as it begins to delude into something of a cut-and-dry docudrama, it pulls the wool out from under your eyes, and surprises you with realistic, yet not melodramatic emotion, and becomes quite the emotionally draining and devastating tale, leaving such an impression on the audience, making this one impossible to tune out.I choose, for this review, not to really get into each character's story, because, one, it would take up too much time, and two, it's much better experienced, not knowing very much about it, as the story unfolds.It'll stick with you for longer than you expect it to. I read advance reviews before seeing it today, that claim that leaving the theatre, no one in the audience spoke about it, or touched anyone, or contacted with anyone around them. Paranoia is a main ingredient to ""Contagion"", proving that no one is immune to fear that is unspoken, but completely pinpointed, and like I said, impossible to ignore. Seeing an afternoon show, in the college town where I live with a few friends of mine, I didn't quite experience this. However, it's completely believable. It leaves you in such a state of paranoia and euphoria, that it's maddening, considering that there aren't many films like this nowadays.Another thing that ""Contagion"" has going for it is how it's made. Soderbergh doesn't waste any time here. Keeping it concise, at a humane running time (105 minutes), it's a roller-coaster from the very first unsettling scene, right up until the last frame. It's written in a way that feels overall very clinical and to-the-point, yet becomes an emotional journey that makes you feel something for each one of its characters.The scariest thing about ""Contagion"" is its plausibility. Unlike your regular horror movie, it has a base which actually could happen, and has happened, in the past. The scares come from things that human beings encounter every day. No ghosts or zombies (in the literal sense of the world) pop out and scare you, while the typical ominous, trying-to-be scary score plays in the background. It's proof that the quietest movies can be the most terrifying. There's a horrifying atmosphere about this one, that sneaks up on you when you least expect it to.

1504690,A1RP0XAYQEEMDM,B005WFWVL4,"M. Curtis ""Dr. Zaius""","[0, 0]","Two things compelled me to see ""Contagion"".  The first reason is I am a huge fan of director Steven Soderbergh's Academy Award winning film ""Traffic"".  Second, I have heard a lot of positive buzz about ""Contagion"" and decided to check it out.  While it's not 100% perfect, I was certainly not disappointed with my decision to see it and was very entertained.One of the reasons why ""Contagion"" works so well is its top notch cast.  From Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Marion Cotillard and Kate Winslet to veterans Matt Damon, Jude Law and Elliot Gould the parts are very well cast and the actors do very well in their respective roles.  I am not a huge fan of Matt Damon but I believe he gives one of the best performances of his carrer in ""Contagion"".  His character seems to represent the every day person.  He is fortunate enough to be genetically immune to the deadly virus at the center of the film, but one thing he is not immune to, is its deadly consequences.  His wife Beth (Paltrow) and his stepson Clark (Paltrow's ten year-old son from a previous marriage.) die within hours of each other.  He and his teenage daughter from his previous marriage must remain in indefinite isolation, Mitch learns that not only was his wife unfaithful, she was the person who indavertently started the epidemic by a very sad case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Rioting and looting is happening all around him.  While he was not directly effected by the virus it has had devestating impact on him in many ways.Every movie, even a medical thriller such as this, needs to have a villain and Jude Law excels here as anti-government conspiracy theorist Allan Krumwaide.  He is terrific as a man convinced that the virus, named Meningoencpehilitis Virus-1 (MEV-1) was in fact manufactured by the US government and released intentionally in order for pharmeceutical companies could earn billions marketing the cure.  What made me like ""Contagion"" even more is that Allan is soon revealed to be nothing more than a money grabbing opportunist and a liar.  As Matt Damon represents the every day person, Law represents the many conspiracy theorists who emerge whenever any type of diaster emerges.  They all claim to be heroes but they are actually (I know the next part of this statement is not going to make me too many friends.) nothing more than liars and frauds.  I'm glad the movie shows that.Despite the fact that he is only in two scenes Elliot Gould is excellent as Dr. Ian Sussman.  The doctor who defies orders and makes the necessary breakthroughs needed to help develop a vaccine to MEV-1.  His scene where he confronts (and ultimeately slam dunks) Jude Law's character is the best scene in the entire movie.  Gould has the best line in the movie when he tells Law ""Blogging is not writing.  It's graffiti with punctuation.""  Enough said there!I think it was a very smart move on the part of writer Scott Burns and director Soderberg to have the final sequence of just how the epidemic started at the end of the movie.  That sequence is very well done and even a little frightening.  It makes you stop and think how a simple thing as cutting down two trees can have such an impact on people and things.  I always enjoy watching that sequence.I can't wrap up my review without, in all fairness, stating that there is a flaw in the movie.  I had a little trouble buying how quickly MEV-1 spread and how quickly it killed its victims.  I know there is some basis in fact for this.  The Spanish Influenza outbreak in the early twentieth century (Shortly before the end of World War I.) spread rapidly and killed millions of people.  Still, there were survivors of that epidemic.

Director Stephen Soderbergh's intent is somewhat vague---is the movie a political statement or a narrative personal drama?  Unfortunately, the personal storylines aren't fully developed enough to warrant involvement.  Many questions are left unanswered and two of the movie's name stars die rather quickly, although Gwyneth Paltrow's demise is fully explained by the film's finale.  Most of the performances are effective---Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jude Law---but I felt Marion Cotillard gave little to her role.

""Contagion"" is like the movie version, only the lesson learned will stick with you at a lot longer.""Contagion"" begins on Day 2 as Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong speaks affectionately over the phone to a man who is not her husband, her wedding ring clearly visible in the shot.  That indiscretion will embroil her family in a worldwide pandemic when she brings a plague home with her.  It spreads from her to her son and from there to the world.  Matt Damon plays her long-suffering husband Mitch, trying to protect his daughter as the world falls apart.That human story tries to anchor the global events as the virus spirals out of control.  Governments are at first too slow to recognize the threat and then too slow to respond as the contagion outpaces laws, politics, and civility.  It's not long before looting, murder, and mass outages wrack all the major population centers.Throughout the film we follow the stories of individual scientists doing their level best to stem the insidious tide.  Some will rise to the occasion, others selfishly protect their loved ones, and still others simply die trying. Paralleling the plague of the body is the plague of the mind, embodied by Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) as a popular countercultural blogger proposing fictional cures , and his actions prove that disinformation can be more deadly than the virus itself.Despite the personal stories of the scientists and Emhoff, ""Contagion"" is oddly bloodless.  The interspersed newscasts never quite bring home the visceral horror of a world gone mad.  There's so much time hopping between geographies that we never stay anchored with one story long enough to really care about the characters.Still, ""Contagion"" makes up for its lack of narrative with Steven Soderbergh's excellent cinematography. The bare, haunting score accentuates the camera's lingering moments on hands and surfaces where the invisible virus lurks.  Every sniffle, every handshake, takes on a new grim significance.  By the end of the film we get to see what happened in Day 1, but by then we already know what's coming.""Contagion"" is as much as a public service announcement as it is an entertaining film.

Still not sure the real reason for some of the name actors (Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Elliott Gould, Laurence Fishburne) in this story, but I guess that is what you have to do to bring people to a movie such as this.Do not waste your time with this snooze-fest.

It also has a big name cast, including Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet, good actors who are sometimes capable of carrying a script with serious weaknesses that otherwise would be hopelessly dull or implausible.While not heavy-laden with special effects, the ones used, especially the global graphics that display the prevalence and frighteningly likely patterns of spread of the disease, are really quite scary, and the chemical models of the virus are fascinating to behold.  It looks as if the whole world is in for tough tests of the reliability of prevailing patterns of social organization under conditions of extreme threat and the ability of modern science to quickly come up with a cure or preventive.Predictably, rumors spread that an effective medication has been found, but that it is being hoarded by elites.  Sensationalist bloggers make the riot-provoking claim that a cure is well known and easily manufactured, but is being withheld by Big Pharma in a conspiritorial profit-couging scheme.  For a time, social chaos ensues and survivalism becomes a prevailing ethos.None of this is new or novel, but while it lasts, it's exciting.  As the virus evolves into more lethal forms, it looks as if planet earth may have met its epidemological match.And then everyting just sort of fizzles out.  Kind of like a guy running the 400 meters in the Olympics, burning up the track for the first 200, and then, exhausted, he just jogs the rest of the way.  Great beginning and then a good deal of disappointment.  Contagion leaves the viewer wondering, ""what's the upshot?""I had high hopes for this movie, but ended thinking ""Huh?  That's it?""  I can't imagine what the writers were thinking.  Even actors as good as Damon, Fishburne, Law, and Winslet can't make this one satisfying.

1504717,A1SX4RZCS86GLV,B005WFWVL4,"Paper Tiger ""papertiger2000""","[4, 10]","This movie is a decent try but it has too much sugar and euphemism to be great. The director is trying to show us the reality but he also admits that the reality is too harsh for most of us to accept. Who wants to see dead bodies scatter all over the street and periodically explode from gases generated from decomposition? He is right. How many of us have the audacity to face the reality? Let me paint a little about the reality and then you can decide as how unrealistic this movie is.A virus depicted in the film could be easily avoided by simply staying at home for two weeks. After that, all the infected hosts would be dead. A truly deadly virus doesn't kill its host so quickly. The incubation period, when the host is highly contagious but showing no symptom, should be about a few months or a little more. By the time it breaks out, it would be too late as everybody would be infected and only the immune would survive.In reality, it is not the virus that is scary. Assuming staying at home doesn't help, an outbreak like this (killing millions with no cure in sight) would cause a major disruption in our infrastructure, particularly transportation. Given most of us depend on transportation for food and etc. to survive and hardly any of us have food that last more than a week, most of us would starve to death in a month or so.After two weeks of food supply disruption, a major riot would set in. In major cities, only those with weapons and the willingness to kill for food would survive. After a few months or so, everybody would be killing each other for food. Only those who live in the rural area with access to farms would have a chance. They would still need to have enough weapon and enough organization in themselves to band together because a large swarm of hungry city-dwellers would immediately set upon them. They would have to decide to serve them food so that all would be starved to death shortly, kill them, be killed or all of the above.Looting the stores and homes shown in the movie is not shocking at all. In reality, before long, it would be common to sell human body parts in meat markets and those unfortunate would be hunted down and eaten.The government? Don't bet on that. It took FEMA a long time to supply water after Katrina, and took weeks to restore order when food was plenty. It would take probably 2 years to develop the vaccine and another 2 years or so to produce enough of that in peace time. However, because of the disruption in social order and transportation, that time could easily triple or become much longer if not never. By the time all said and done, we would be probably looking at half of the population gone if not more - most would starve to death; others would die of other diseases and unnatural causes (killed by our fellow humans).By the way, once the looting starts, the government would quickly issue a decree to confiscate every firearm and ammunition and stop any sales of such. I laughed when I saw Matt Damon went to find guns for protection from his neighbor. For those of you who don't believe in firearms, well, if you don't believe in firearms to begin with, you should stick to your believes, be true to yourself, and wait defenselessly until they come to rob you and rape and kill your daughter. Things like this can happen and have happened many times such as LA Riot and Katrina. When law and order breaks down, it is up to you and your firearms to protect yourself and your loved ones!For those who believe in the government, what described in the movie is quite true. The government would blockade any infected areas to prevent the infection from spreading, a procedure called ""quarantine."" This is the primary duty of the government - to protect society as a whole.

1504718,AXYJ9QJYS3S78,B005WFWVL4,pastapadre,"[2, 3]","An alarming portrayal of a viral outbreak and its fallout Contagion is essentially a real life horror story - one that very well could prompt concern of a scenario that is unfortunately not far fetched. A fast spreading disease appears out of no where making its way through the population and the movie follows a handful of characters and their different perspectives and circumstances.Expertly orchestrated by director Steven Soderbergh Contagion feels a lot like like an independent film - from the tone to its pacing, imagery, and score. It has those qualities but is littered by a number of recognizable and respected stars in the cast. Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Lawrence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, and Bryan Cranston share the primary screen time. Their characters are all tied together through the world event but are fractured into their own angles.One man has lost loved ones and hangs on to only person he has left (his daughter), the CDC is working on tracking down the origin of the virus and finding a solution, an investigative blogger is seeking out a scoop and championing a conspiracy theory, and a doctor is sent to Hong Kong to try and locate the original source of the virus. This is all happening as the public reacts and the situation escalates. While the factions don't completely merge framing them in this manner establishes the necessary scope of the ordeal.The audience at the packed screening seemed to struggle with processing what was taking place. At times there were audible gasps and on several occasions nervous laughter. As the credits rolled there was a smattering of applause and also heavy chatter. It's a movie that challenges the viewer and is striking in its effectiveness. There is also some very graphic imagery and some disturbing happenings that take place which are unexpected in how they are presented - some of it even caught me off guard to an extent. You'd be hard pressed to find a single up-beat moment in the entire movie.That is likely to result in mixed viewer response. The immediate feeling I have is there will be those who think the movie is excellent and others who find it boring due to a lack of action and its calculated though consistent pace. It is suspenseful in its overwhelming sense of dread and that won't be considered enjoyable for everyone.The conclusion to the film is where it lost me somewhat as it felt rushed and a bit convenient - which was out of place considering everything that had taken place before it. I kept expecting something else to happen right at the end (trying to be unspecific here) to leave the audience with a particular feeling on the way out but it didn't come. Instead it took the opportunity to answer a lingering question which didn't feel as though it was ultimately necessary.Contagion is a very good movie but also a bleak and difficult watch. It's not easily recommendable despite the qualities it possesses and how effective it is in making the scenario feel frightening and potentially real. For those seeking something different than the normal summer fare as the transition was made to the fall season Contagion is definitely an option worth considering.",4,Compelling and frightening in its own right,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,3193,"['alarming', 'portrayal', 'viral', 'outbreak', 'fallout', 'Contagion', 'essentially', 'real', 'life', 'horror', 'story', 'one', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'prompt', 'concern', 'scenario', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'far', 'fetched', 'fast', 'spreading', 'disease', 'where', 'making', 'way', 'population', 'movie', 'handful', 'characters', 'different', 'perspectives', 'circumstances.Expertly', 'orchestrated', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Contagion', 'lot', 'independent', 'film', 'tone', 'pacing', 'imagery', 'score', 'qualities', 'littered', 'number', 'recognizable', 'respected', 'stars', 'cast', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Bryan', 'Cranston', 'share', 'primary', 'screen', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'world', 'event', 'are', 'fractured', 'own', 'angles.One', 'man', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'hangs', 'only', 'person', 'left', 'daughter', 'CDC', 'working', 'tracking', 'down', 'origin', 'virus', 'finding', 'solution', 'investigative', 'blogger', 'seeking', 'out', 'scoop', 'championing', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'doctor', 'sent', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'try', 'locate', 'original', 'source', 'virus', 'all', 'happening', 'public', 'reacts', 'situation', 'factions', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'merge', 'framing', 'manner', 'necessary', 'scope', 'ordeal.The', 'audience', 'packed', 'screening', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'processing', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'times', 'were', 'audible', 'gasps', 'several', 'occasions', 'nervous', 'laughter', 'credits', 'rolled', 'was', 'smattering', 'applause', 'also', 'heavy', 'chatter', 'movie', 'viewer', 'striking', 'effectiveness', 'also', 'very', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'disturbing', 'happenings', 'take', 'place', 'are', 'unexpected', 'how', 'are', 'presented', 'even', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'extent', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'single', 'up-beat', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie.That', 'likely', 'result', 'mixed', 'viewer', 'response', 'immediate', 'feeling', 'have', 'will', 'be', 'who', 'think', 'movie', 'excellent', 'others', 'who', 'find', 'boring', 'due', 'lack', 'action', 'calculated', 'consistent', 'pace', 'suspenseful', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'dread', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'enjoyable', 'everyone.The', 'conclusion', 'film', 'where', 'lost', 'somewhat', 'felt', 'rushed', 'bit', 'convenient', 'was', 'place', 'considering', 'everything', 'had', 'taken', 'place', 'kept', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'happen', 'right', 'end', 'trying', 'be', 'unspecific', 'here', 'leave', 'audience', 'particular', 'feeling', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'Instead', 'took', 'opportunity', 'answer', 'lingering', 'question', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'ultimately', 'necessary.Contagion', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'also', 'bleak', 'difficult', 'watch', 'not', 'easily', 'recommendable', 'qualities', 'how', 'effective', 'making', 'scenario', 'feel', 'frightening', 'potentially', 'real', 'seeking', 'something', 'different', 'normal', 'summer', 'fare', 'transition', 'was', 'made', 'fall', 'season', 'Contagion', 'definitely', 'option', 'worth', 'considering']",N/A

1504724,A3UT7I4QCP1FQR,B005WFWVL4,"Rajesh Motie ""Xanatos Planned This Signature""","[0, 0]","Contagion might be described as a ""cinematic documentary"" (oxymoronic, I know) that realistically imagines what might happen if a new, initially unstoppable virus sprang up and killed people on a global scale. The movie doesn't actually sound particularly unique from the outset, with quotes like ""it's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out"", but when you think about it, most epidemic-themed films are completely fictional, while Contagion tries to paint a picture of what might really happen.The story mostly centers around Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) who is immune to the disease and must protect his daughter from society's collapse, Alan Krumwiede the amateur freelance journalist with a conspiratorial mind, and Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard), an epidemiologist sent to Hong Kong to find the origin of the disease.Most of the performances are solid and make you believe that what is happening in the movie is possible, as they react realistically to it. Cheever has to deal with the accusation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is overreacting to the virus and he is also harassed by Krumwiede. He's an intelligent and affable person, be he makes some bad mistakes.I feared that the filmmakers might be trying to hard to give a ""normal"" perspective on things by including Matt Damon's character, but fortunately he sold the idea of a normal dad who has to become a desperate survivor in a dire time. Through him we can see a lot of how the contagion has a affected the masses, civilization committing suicide, if you will.The other two protagonists are the weakest. I like Jude Law, but his character is a cardboard ""villain"" who gets more and more inhuman as the film progresses. Marion Cotillard's story line is useless (sans the scenes that show us how the disease spreads) and disappears for most of the film, before returning with zero resolution. You must sit through these parts of the movie wondering what the point is.As the global situation worsens, people start rioting and looting and the like, and cities are quarantined. I felt like one or two sections where people started rioting were a bit abrupt, like there needed to be more build-up to show the insecurity of the populace, and then showing them finally snap and begin with the killing and destroying. But overall it's believable, and there are many sequences that portray the utterly ruined city littered with the dead. There is something intense about parts of this film, the cinematography and music combined with the believable premise and shots of the damage done. It constantly made me think to myself ""What if this happened? What would we do? What would I do?""As great as it is, Contagion suddenly ends without ever coming to a point of absolute tension. The audience is suddenly sees how the contagion came about, though the characters are never shown to have learned this themselves. I could have used some more resolution to these character, who I had grown to care about, and perhaps to re-cooperation of the world. But Contagion just ends. It's great while it lasts though. It want to give it a 9, but it falls just short.8 out of 9",4,"""Cinematic documentary""?",1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,3274,"['Contagion', 'might', 'be', 'described', 'cinematic', 'documentary', 'oxymoronic', 'know', 'realistically', 'what', 'might', 'happen', 'new', 'initially', 'unstoppable', 'virus', 'sprang', 'up', 'killed', 'people', 'global', 'scale', 'movie', ""n't"", 'actually', 'sound', 'particularly', 'unique', 'outset', 'quotes', 'figuring', 'faster', ""'re"", 'figuring', 'out', 'when', 'think', 'most', 'epidemic-themed', 'films', 'are', 'completely', 'fictional', 'Contagion', 'paint', 'picture', 'what', 'might', 'really', 'happen.The', 'story', 'mostly', 'Dr.', 'Ellis', 'Cheever', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Dr.', 'Mears', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Centers', 'Disease', 'Control', 'Prevention', 'Mitch', 'Emhoff', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'immune', 'disease', 'must', 'protect', 'daughter', 'society', 'collapse', 'Alan', 'Krumwiede', 'amateur', 'freelance', 'journalist', 'conspiratorial', 'mind', 'Dr.', 'Leonora', 'Orantes', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'epidemiologist', 'sent', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'find', 'origin', 'disease.Most', 'performances', 'are', 'solid', 'make', 'believe', 'what', 'happening', 'movie', 'possible', 'react', 'realistically', 'Cheever', 'deal', 'accusation', 'Centers', 'Disease', 'Control', 'Prevention', 'overreacting', 'virus', 'also', 'harassed', 'Krumwiede', 'intelligent', 'affable', 'person', 'be', 'bad', 'mistakes.I', 'feared', 'filmmakers', 'might', 'be', 'trying', 'hard', 'give', 'normal', 'perspective', 'things', 'including', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'character', 'fortunately', 'sold', 'idea', 'normal', 'dad', 'who', 'become', 'desperate', 'survivor', 'dire', 'time', 'can', 'see', 'lot', 'how', 'contagion', 'affected', 'masses', 'civilization', 'committing', 'suicide', 'will.The', 'other', 'two', 'protagonists', 'are', 'weakest', 'like', 'Jude', 'Law', 'character', 'cardboard', 'villain', 'who', 'more', 'more', 'inhuman', 'film', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'story', 'line', 'useless', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'disease', 'most', 'film', 'returning', 'zero', 'resolution', 'must', 'sit', 'parts', 'movie', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', 'global', 'situation', 'people', 'start', 'rioting', 'looting', 'like', 'cities', 'are', 'quarantined', 'felt', 'one', 'two', 'sections', 'where', 'people', 'started', 'rioting', 'were', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'build-up', 'show', 'insecurity', 'populace', 'then', 'showing', 'finally', 'snap', 'begin', 'killing', 'destroying', 'overall', 'believable', 'are', 'many', 'sequences', 'portray', 'utterly', 'ruined', 'city', 'littered', 'dead', 'something', 'intense', 'parts', 'film', 'cinematography', 'music', 'combined', 'believable', 'premise', 'shots', 'damage', 'done', 'constantly', 'made', 'think', 'myself', 'What', 'happened', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'As', 'great', 'Contagion', 'suddenly', 'ever', 'coming', 'point', 'absolute', 'tension', 'audience', 'suddenly', 'how', 'contagion', 'came', 'about', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'have', 'learned', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'resolution', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'care', 'perhaps', 're-cooperation', 'world', 'Contagion', 'just', 'great', 'want', 'give', '9', 'just', 'short.8', '9']",N/A

in San Fran,comes up with a promising cure route.In the meantime Law who is an internet blogger with many followers,is turning up his own heat on the entire scenario.He does not believe any of the explanations official are coming out with.In fact he himself comes down with the virus and through the use of a homeopathic remedy,cures himself,which goes largely unnoticed by the CDC.This inflames public opinion even more.He also is interviewed on national TV and accuses Fishburne of notifying his own family over the general populace.Fishburne then faces a hearing down the line into his conduct.The CDC in the meantime is trying to trace ground zero of the virus.A WHO rep in Hong Kong is kidnapped and is held in a remote village.She is eventually exchanged in lieu of a batch of developed antibiotics later in the film.It turns out the batch is just placebos,useless.As the developed vaccine gets distributed,life starts to get back to normal for the world(until the next outbreak).As the film ends we see in flashback where the virus originated from.A bulldozer from Paltrows company knocked down a tree in which a bat was nesting.It bit into a piece of banana,which it in turn flew with and rested with on a beam in a farm shed,over top of some pigs.The banana dropped and the pigs digested it.The pigs in turn are shipped into the cities and one infected one arrives in the very restaurant Paltrow was in,in Hong Kong.The film studies in detail how an organization such as the CDC operates,what protocols they use and how they become viral detectives,in search of an answer and a cure.They work in a logical and progressive manner,which to many would appear far too slow.As with many medical cures there are medical heroes,as there are here.The film doesn't just stop there,but shows the other side of the coin in the form of Law.He is an internet guru who many folks listen to and who slams the CDC and big pharma in general for being in cahoots.He cures himself and it is just left there.The director is giving as much latitude to the ""official"" side,as it is to the unofficial/internet.It also shows how our very own social and business structures slowly but surely break down as nurses and a myriad of union members stop working.This brings goods and material supplies to a halt,which in turn triggers hoarding and line ups.And of course this triggers small riots as people get less and less tolerant of others.It is certainly a riveting film which leaves one uncomfortable afterwards,as we see just how easy a virus can spread.But that was the goal of the director and writers,and they certainly achieved it here.The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is a couple of minute cartoon-ish PSA announcement.All in all a disturbing ""realistic"" look at the outbreak of an unknown virus and  how the CDC and their world wide counterparts deal with such things.Throughout we are given a disturbing peak at ourselves and the straws we grasp for in times of turmoil.It isn't pretty,but it engages the viewer.Recommended.",4,A chilling look at what could happen,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,3979,"['Contagion', 'released',

1504731,A3SHQXNOPZBJH,B005WFWVL4,Robert Byrd,"[0, 0]","This is truly an exceptional film.  First, as some frustrated reviewers pointed out who were expecting a faster-paced, cliched, Roland Emmerich type ""end of the world"" disaster flick, this is a relatively slow story about the deadly outbreak of an influenza virus that wipes out millions of people (much like the flu virus of 1918 that killed over 50-million people).  It's contains little of the hysteria and mass panic that normally characterizes the disaster genre film.  Instead, it presents a hyper-realistic version of an outbreak that is absolutely riveting precisely because it seems so likely and real.  I'd call CONTAGION nearly flawless with one major exception: A World Health Organization disease investigator sets off to Hong Kong to determine the origin of the disease.  While there, she works with a Chinese interpreter who has less than honorable intentions for her.  This track of the story seemed wholly unnecessary and was somewhat confusing.  It unfortunately cast a shadow over an otherwise near-perfect film.  But the distraction is not so bad that it significantly diminishes the impact of CONTAGION.  In fact, all the other elements of the story are so strong that I intend to see it again.

The overblown storyline about the blogger stands out the most, but even fishburn's bit with the janitor's son, or the microbiologist savior's kissing scene with her dad just made it seem like an over-dramatized made-for-tv movie.Like a CSI episode it is as if the writer learned some tidbits of information about the virus pathology industry during research, then makes up some hacked together supervirus, packaged with some flashy microbiology terms to give the impression of subject mastery.Also the happy 'realistic' ending seemed ridiculous, given the nature of the virus they were dealing with. In a similar vein, I  suppose Steve will make a movie about the EPA stopping global warming next.Being a Soderbergh film you will see a lot of imho over-dramatised imagery and acting, complete with actors giving 'naturalistic' pauses, stammers, reactions, misspeaks, etc. Perhaps i've grown cynical, but it comes off as very self-indulgent.

From a combination of factors - perhaps statistically inevitable, just like a nuclear accident - a new disease emerges.  It is the product of a mix of DNA, bred in a factory farm in Asia by a freak occurrence.  When transmitted, it grows explosively due to modern transportation; unbelievably deadly, it kills up to 30% of those infected.  Their deaths are horrible to witness.  As a result, within a month, modern society suffers a near-complete breakdown, with panic, rising lawlessness, and in the end mayhem.The plot progresses through a number of characters, some normal people, some remarkable public servants, some self-seeking charlatans.  Paltrow is one of the first victims, a strange elimination but also the perfect vehicle to retrace her steps throughout the film.  Damon is her husband, a good man out of work whose life is thrown into painful turmoil and a struggle for survival.  Cottilard, Winslet, and several others are dedicated officials, whose desperate actions form a fascinating quest to contain and then cure the disease; it is good to see bureaucrats portrayed with realistic and deserved respect.  I will not go on as this could spoil the plot.I watched this twice in a row while on an airplane.  It is an important reminder of a possible near-future, but also truly great storytelling.

Not only did I see if twice in the theater, but have viewed it several times since aquiring in on dvd. There is a magic intermingling between the actors, the cinamatography, and definately the music score that leaves a deep sense of dread in the human psyche. An almost baited mixed breath of bone deep fear, shocking conclusions, and sudden need to take stock in case of the worse case scenarios as the movie unfolds, and we become aware of individuals and the huge populations of the areas where they are located.We know that what we seeing is not only possible, but by all accounts from the WHO, CDC & Prevention and most Intelligent Sectors and Concerened Goverments, this is a time bomb simply waiting to happen. As one character responds to a question concerning whether someone could weaponize the Avian Flu his answer is succinct and terrible at the same time: ""no one has to, the birds are doing it all by themselves."" We see signs of profittering, lies and misdirections by both private person,sectors and some health care monitors, and finally given some hard, cold facts concerning the science, the testing, the production and storage of a treatment protocol. A treatment protocal that will no doubt shock Educated American audiences who assume from their yearly flu shots, and the seemingly empty scares of the last swine flu outbreaks that western goverments and Health Organizations, including our own, can supply the demands for treatments in a quick and timely manner. As the movie progresses the truths of a global pandemic of any unique viral strain becomes all to depressingly shocking and terrifying. While there are moments of levity abd resolution, the overall truth of this film must be addressed and understood. If for no other reason than to prepare oneself for the eventuality.

Viruses specialize as regards how they are transmitted to a host.  But not in this movie.There is no real plot here except 1) there is a virus-based plague; and 2) the Government swings into action to find a cure. Then society starts to break down (which has never happened in modern times in response to a plague, but who knows?)...There are some big named stars in this flick, but mostly the film is an infomercial about how lucky we are to have Government researchers standing around at taxpayer expense to cure Bird Flu or some other plague that might happen some day but never has.

Tepid is the word I'm looking for here, and that's not good when you're talking about a potentially stunning and exciting film.  To be honest, the film looks as though it was made by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) A/V department as a training film for new staff.  Maybe you'd bring it in to a Senate budget subcommittee hearing pleading for a larger budget.What went wrong with 'Contagion'?  Well, to begin with, the script has no zing, no pizzazz, no life.  To employ a bad pun, the movie flatlines quite early.And the ending?  Even more B-O-R-I-N-G! than the rest of the film.  Yeah, it answers a question I was sort of interested in.  Not that much, to be honest.  To say it was anti-climatic is to say that a film of someone sleeping is anti-climatic.  Actually, a guy sleeping would have more life than the ending to this film.Remember 'Outbreak' with Dustin Hoffman?  That was a film about a similar subject, and it was immeasurably better than this film.  Heck, even the decades-old 'The Andromeda Strain' was a better film about an infection, and that disease only killed a few folks.Do yourself a favor and don't let the great trailer and manufactured hype about the film get you to park your rear end in front of this film.  Skip it, and watch 'Outbreak' or 'The Andromeda Strain'.  Or watch a superior SF film like 'Contact' or 'Gattaca'.  Jude Law was in both this film and that the latter.  Damn, he was good in Gattaca.Want to learn about how the CDC and the World Health Organization would confront a pandemic?  Like sitting through a lecture series on the subject?  Then this film is OK.  If you want unbearable tension, compelling characters, and twists and turns leading to a wholly unexpected ending?  Then this film, ain't that film.Too bad.  I had high hopes for this one.  A wasted opportunity.  Who greenlighted this???Update:  I was kind of right about this being a CDC training film.  The producers worked 'very closely' with the CDC in making this film, which accounts for much of the tameness.This disease spreads rapidly throughout the world, killing many.  This would change everything.  But, about all you'll get when you watch this film is an epidemic of yawns.  It just didn't involve me.  It's important to identify with characters in order to care about what happens to them.  That didn't happen for me.

But she isn't the only one.  In Hong Kong, a young man wanders back to his apartment, stricken with a delirious fever.  Then there's the Ukrainian model in London, and the Japanese businessman in Tokyo.  All are crashing hard; and so begins director Steven Soderbergh's most recent film, Contagion.  Modeled, in many ways, after his four-time Oscar winning masterpiece, Traffic, this new film is an evocative journey into germaphobe's worst nightmare.What makes this work so well is the casual intersection of stories that veer in and out of focus as the epidemic makes its way around the globe.  Where a lesser director might have succumbed to the desire to voyeuristically pump up the nightmarish body count, Soderbergh wisely shows a few intimate and unexpected deaths before driving the film to more elevated heights where we witness the medical community's valiant attempts to combat a global pandemic.  By avoiding the morbid horror-movie stereotypes, Soderbergh creates something that is far more terrifying: casual, incidental contact.I highly recommend this film as one of the best I've seen in 2011.Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.",4,Contagion: A One-Minute Film Review,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1291,"['Waiting', 'flight', 'airport', 'lounge', 'adulterous', 'Beth', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'feeling', 'bit', 'weather', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'young', 'man', 'back', 'apartment', 'stricken', 'delirious', 'fever', 'Then', 'Ukrainian', 'model', 'London', 'Japanese', 'businessman', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'crashing', 'hard', 'so', 'director', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Contagion', 'Modeled', 'many', 'ways', 'four-time', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'masterpiece', 'Traffic', 'new', 'film', 'evocative', 'journey', 'germaphobe', 'worst', 'nightmare.What', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'casual', 'intersection', 'stories', 'veer', 'focus', 'epidemic', 'way', 'globe', 'Where', 'lesser', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'succumbed', 'desire', 'voyeuristically', 'pump', 'up', 'nightmarish', 'body', 'count', 'Soderbergh', 'wisely', 'few', 'intimate', 'unexpected', 'deaths', 'driving', 'film', 'more', 'elevated', 'heights', 'where', 'witness', 'medical', 'community', 'valiant', 'attempts', 'combat', 'global', 'pandemic', 'avoiding', 'morbid', 'horror-movie', 'stereotypes', 'Soderbergh', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'casual', 'incidental', 'contact.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2011.Further', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bloodstainedink.wordpress.com']",N/A

After the disease begins to spread, the CDC doctors and local officials work hard to contain the virus, and to find a cure. Hucksters, promoting miracle cures take advantage of the situation to hawk miracle cures with zero effectiveness. The story follows different characters as they follow different paths to the end goal- finding an antidote.While I did find the story enjoyable, I did think they could've handled certain elements better. For instance, I suspect that the doctor who 'notified' his wife prior to the outbreak, would've had his wife already in a protected area. Scientists can't really be expected to work effectively if their loved ones are running around inside known areas about to be quarantined. Second, I am not sure how it really helped to paint patient zero as an adulterous white woman having an illicit affair when she contracts the illness. It just gives the contagion a judgemental quality which I didn't like.

So, initially when I said I wanted to see this film, eyes rolled and there were talks to try to get me out of it. Why? It would get my imagination going even wilder about germs and creepy people. But I went to see it anyway and I enjoyed the film. One thing I am glad I did was eat before I saw the film. Please do NOT think you're going to dinner after seeing this flick. You'll be paranoid about touching everything from your restaurant glass to your plate to the door, and if you have to get on a train, more power to you. I'd recommend walking!Other than disease imagination overload, it was a pretty good flick. I'm a huge fan of Laurence Fishburne so I was delighted to find out he was one of the main characters. I already knew one of my other favorite actors Matt Damon was in this film, and like I've said in another review, if Matt Damon is in it, I know the movie will be good. He RARELY disappoints me with his movie choices.For those who went through the swine flu scare, this will definitely remind you of that time when a disease was making people sick, closing schools and a few were dying. But in this film, millions (or was it billions?) were dying, which made people all the crazier (i.e., looting, fighting, screaming, panicking, accusations flying on the Internet, and Twitter sure did make its way into the conversation). Some characters are immune while others are not, and although the reason why one of the main characters is immune isn't explained very well, he is. So that means that there is either a cure or a few ""chosen"" people who lucked out. But the rest are losing it completely to make sure they don't get this disease that's in the same row with H1N1. Some may also remember the days of polio or think of Spanish flu. Whatever it is you compare it to, the fact is people don't want any parts of it and that's the center of the film.When I saw the ending, I'd pretty much guessed that it had something to do with that and I know there's a select group of people who want to scream ""I told you so!"" but I won't spoil the ending for everyone. I will say this group will have a smug look on their face in hopes that people will think twice about their lifestyles.

1504759,A21XDUIO2A4B8J,B005WFWVL4,Stephen Paul Ives-Butterfield,"[1, 1]","--SPOILER ALERT--""Contagion"" is the coherent and compelling story of a major pandemic set into America's present-day stupidities of insufficient preparation, anti-intellectual societal climate, and the hundred years of social engineering by corporate greed and political corruption for the sake of the superrich.The storyline provides good emphasis on the reaction, competencies, courage, and human failings of frontline scientists.  Matt Damon's character, Mitch Emhoff, is Mister Ordinary Citizen standing up to the deaths of his wife and stepson at the pandemic's beginning--and protecting his temporarily safe teen-age daughter--with quiet heroism.  Elliot Gould's excellently-played character, Dr. Ian Sussman, ignores and illegally sidesteps an official order to close down his lab, knowing that he has resources that will speed curtailing the pandemic.  He does that and then hands over his results to the proper authorities without any suggestion of profiteering.And there are other breath-taking heroes, along with some dispicable villans.However, the American stupidities are glossed over as if the filmmakers were afraid to talk about the elephants in the living room.  They are glossed over as if these conditions have righteous reasons to exist--as if the American people have done the very best that can be done against a govt that has been rampantly illegitimate since at least 1913.The US govt has been a principal in the manufacturing of corporate greed and political corruption since before the end of WWI, when the monied elites lobbied for the shut-down of the people's direct democracy overhauls of state govts.  It was our ""Reform Era"", and it threatened to end superrich domination of the American cash cow.From 1898 to 1918, organized citizens forced direct democracy features into their constitutions to allow the people to deal with govt illegitimacies.  Today, there are 18 states in which the sovereign people have direct control of their now-thoroughly illegitimate govts.  Those direct democracy features are now unused--when they are desperately needed--because of the public's socially-engineered conviction that they would do more harm than good.  So speaketh the superrich.  Corporate greed and political corruption win every day.  The public's mass fascism goes hand-in-glove with govt's mass fascism.  We've been socially engineered into conforming with whatever is best for the superrich and their progeny.  And now we're voting ourselves to death against corruption-aided computers that rob us of fair elections.  (Stop voting, dummies, until justice is done against the illegitimacies.)Our social engineering--directing us away from any rational preparation so that we continue to spend into the already established coffers of the superrich--bit us on the butt badly when Katrina struck New Orleans.  It will bite us badly again when the contagion of the next pandemic hits us (the birds are taking care of weaponizing  bird flu, as a scientist quips in the film, ""Contagion"").  And it will bite us badly again when the supervolcano at Yellowstone erupts to fry and and bury a half to three-quarters of the US landmass.  Superrich caretakers Bush and Obama have given us a curtain of controlled media and junk-scientists to pooh-pooh away the now red-zoned, super-sized caldera at Yellowstone.All of the factors to red-zone that supervolcano, to indicate that this one can erupt any day, have demonstrated that they're in place.  But the junk scientists continue to crow that it may be thousands of years before any serious erruption happens.  No worries.  No need for any prepartion whatsoever.If it weren't for the Yellowstone supervolcano's implications of world-wide volcanic winter for 5-10 years--and the major destruction that a volcanic winter can bring to the global food supply--we simply would not have science news from anywhere about what we face when Yellowstone blows up.  As it is, we have Internet web sites that give us access to the science being done in other countries.  And that is in spite of major pooh-poohing of Internet resources being done by global elites and their political dogs.If Yellowstone produces a middling supereruption of middling explosiveness, it's blast-kill zone is projected to be a 600-mile radius.  About 20 million Americans live inside that radius.  Who do we see about their lack of preparation?Our ignorance is bliss for the superrich and their parasitic puppet politicians.  However, as the film, ""Contagion"", effectively shows for those with eyes to see, what we don't know can kill us.Did the film show us the fastest way to a pandemic vaccine?  Or did it show us a very slow way along which the superrich can maximize their obscene profits?  Again.If it showed us the way that the superrich get to maximize their obscene profits, then it is just another classical sophistry for the superrich.  Lies bundled in plausible falsehoods so that we don't object too much when they actually drag us through it.There've been a lot of classical sophistries wrapped into popular films lately for the benefit of the superrich.  The ones that jump to mind are ""Syriana"" (George Clooney--2005--CYA sophistry for the corporate greed and political corruption corporatism of our nazified govt and big oil); ""The Dark Knight"" (Heath Ledger--2008--CYA sophistry for murderous politicians who are the heroes that war-by-deception neocons need); and ""From Paris With Love"" (John Travolta--2010--CYA sophistry for CIA evils from kidnapping and rendition to torture and murder because one cowboy kills anybody associated with terrorists who everyone wants dead.  Hip-hip-hooray for the CIA.  Airheads and morons, UNITE.)Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans think that 'sophistry' means what the superrich-controlled, whitewashed dictionaries say it means.  Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans aren't educated enough to know the details of the ""1st Sophistic"" and the ""2nd Sophistic"", the eras of sophistry centering on the lives of Aristotle and Cicero, respectively.Too bad that the overwhelming majority of ordinary Americans can be persuaded by pooh-poohs and plausible falsehoods to love anything--e.g.,the shredding of the Constitution, the evaporation of the Declaration of Independence, and the vaporizing of every right and liberty fought, bled, and died for by fighting Americans since 1776.  WW2, Korea, Vietnam, and Gulf veterans?  Go play in traffic.In the next pandemic, the superrich's obscene profits won't just cost us the trillions of dollars they ripped out of us in the 2008 financial meltdown.  (Anyone prosecuted for those frauds yet?  In your dreams.)  The next pandemic can easily cost us many tens of millions of human lives.  1918's Spanish flu cost us 50 to 100 million lives globally.  And that was with no jet planes and a global population accustomed to staying at home.The superrich's social engineering is more serious than most imagine.  ""Contagion"" shows little bitty reflections of just how seriously we're mired into the stupidities of superrich designs.  And it gives us no discussion of the fastest, most prepared way to develop and administer effective vaccine.We should just openly trust a film, the making of which required tens of millions of dollars?  Where did those millions of dollars come from? Ordinary Americans who are well-informed of vaccine technologies?

I really enjoyed the ""geek"" aspect of the movie as those who look at the virus infection do so from a logical, mathematical, scientific aspect as one might expect. We also have the personal aspect of people dying from the infection and their stories and of course the reporter/blogger who gets no respect. (My title is a line from the movie and is not to be considered my personal opinion.)As you can imagine, the virus structure is unique, it travels rapidly, and the body doesn't know how to handle it. Fortunately it has a short incubation period and acts like typical viruses, i.e. not spreading in colder environments. The movie centers on isolating infected people and trying to figure out the origin of the disease. It also deals with the more mundane aspects such as the specifics of burials, quarantines, irrational thinking, and big pharmaceutical companies. In doing so it jumps around a lot, with numerous subplots and no real central character. I believe this is done to give the audience ""the feel"" of the mobility of the virus, and world panic and not because the film director and editor are idiots.

Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) has just welcomed his wife, Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow), back from a business trip to Hong Kong.  She's feverish and weak, but these symptoms of flu turn out to signal something far more dangerous.Other victims of this unknown affliction surface, word spreads, and Drs. Ellis Cheaver (Laurence Fishburne) and Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control brainstorm to figure out the source of the virus.  Mears is hastily sent into the field to gather information while other researchers amp up their efforts to isolate the virus and develop a vaccine.  Among them are independent biologist Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) and CDC Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle).""Contagion"" provides a credible look at what might happen if such a health threat came to pass, and has an almost documentary feel as multiple aspects of the story unfold in parallel time while locations shift from city to city, country to country.  Characters are well drawn; real people act heroically without making a big deal of it.  Yet despite its fine performances, the movie plays on a single emotional and dramatic note.  It moves along, unhurried and deliberate, as director Steven Soderbergh portrays a tense but generally disciplined populace.""Contagion"" provides a thoughtful spin on the Hollywood disaster flm.  Though the formula is borrowed from many 70's blockbusters, ""Contagion"" is far more reflective.

This ridiculous bit of Jaywalking-as-crime is put up as some kind of 'terrible thing.' Were the writers drugged?What was seriously overlooked (or worse: tolerated) was the anti-semitism involved with this arab financing (Production financing money from Abu Dhabi): While Abu Dhabbi and Cairo are mentioned (laughably) for their 'scientific input,' the entire country of Israel is not shown on any maps, nor is it mentioned. What's up with that, Mr. Soderburgh? Did ya get a push for that Jew-hatred from your friends in the White House?Another piece of ignorance was a brief scene where a janitor asks Fishburne about treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder for his son. Instead of actually USING HIS POSITION as filmaker to raise public awareness about the DANGERS of Big Pharma pushing these dangerous drugs, this is given a pass by these cowardly stooges for the worst in our culture.An interesting plot turn that could have actually brought some drama to the movie was Paltrow's adultery - which is so ignored u wonder why it was brought up in the first place, and the kidnapped doctor who runs back to the village after finding out about the 'medicine'. Instead, there are scenes created to carry the picture forward - especially after the cure; and you wonder - towards what end???

This movie reads like a ""who's who"" of the actor's world.  It has Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon, Marion Cotillard, that woman from ""Titanic"", Laurence Fishburne, Bryan Cranston (dude's in everything these days), Ross and Monica's father from friends, Sanaa Lathan, Jude Law...and more!But you can have a cast of very good actors and that still doesn't mean the movie is going to work.  So does ""Contagion"" work?  Yes, it does.  As a slow boil drama.  But it deals with a weighty subject, a the issue of a worldwide catastrophy as a highly communicable fast killing virus breaks out.  The filmgoer should feel the weight of such an horrific event but this largely escapes us as Soderbergh goes about this project in an almost workmanlike procedural fashion.  Where is the hysteria and the sheer horror and sense of displacement that would occur as the virus spreads and becomes known?  ""Outbreak"", which was shot more as an action thriller, managed to give us at least a sense of this.  ""Contagion"" does not as it follows our characters, a few who are early afflicted with the disease and a lot of scientists who are out trying to trace its roots (***spoiler alert*** wash your hands and avoid the swine) and come up with a cure, to the barely triumphant conclusion.  And it seems to be trying to tell us something about ourselves, or share some moral.I freely admit, though, that whatever the moral of the movie is I missed it.  It may be that mankind survives or dies at the whims of a disinterested bioligical world.  Or it could be that our salvation lies within our very biological beings and that SCIENCE (our modern god) is what is capable of saving us so long as we continue to worship and obey (study and act upon its laws) at its feet.  This has all been done before, quite frequently, especially in science fiction (both good and bad, mind you).  Here the movie feels like a hollow event, like there is or should be something more, but all we're left with is what is on the screen...and whatever cold chill might run up and down our spine the next time we see someone leave a restroom without washing their hands or have a flying commuter sneeze or cough near us.",3,Would everyone just please wash their hands more?

The doctors are dumbfounded as the disease manages to spread not only in the Emhoffs' hometown of Minneapolis but also in other communities across the U.S. and the globe. The resulting fears are then stoked by a conspiracy-minded blogger named Alan Krunweide (played by Jude Law) who sees the disease as an attempt to further trim the civil liberties of ordinary citizens while drug companies and medical professionals rake in untold profits. All while actual medical professionals (played by Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard and others) continue to work tirelessly and gain little, if any, advantage in the fight.As already mentioned, this is a very impressive cast.

1504774,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005WFWVL4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","With the immediate subject matter of a global pandemic Steven Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" shows us how the world as we know it slowly disintegrates into chaos, and the people struggling to cope with and survive the situation. The script (penned by Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh's ""Informant"") is obviously written with the recent SARS epidemic in mind, and the film offers a more frightening look at the crisis caused by a lethal virus than ""Outbreak"" does, but its intriguing premise is bogged down by some weak writing that could have been remedied.The medical thriller has an impressive ensemble cast including Marion Cotillard, Matt Damon, Jennifer Ehle, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Winslet. While doctors and researchers of the world (represented by characters by Cotillard, Ehle, Fishburne and Winslet) attempt to identify the cause of the widespread disease and search for the cure, Jude Law's blogger claims his own theory that attracts many online. Meanwhile, the story of Mitch and Beth Emhoff (Damon and Paltrow), married couple with two children, follows the panic among the ordinary people seen from an ordinary family.While the director's detached approach to the characters helps create the film's grim and realistic touch, the familiar faces of the stars keep reminding us that we are watching a movie. ""Contagion"" gives us chilling scenario of the society struck by the deadly virus, and how fear throws people headlong into confusion, but the realism is often undermined by the melodramatic storyline (Cotillard's character in particular) and some turn of events that seem too good to be true.Thus, like in his ""Informant,"" Soderbergh employs styles that are curiously at odds with the contents. For all its excellent acting from the entire cast and some credible moments of the global pandemic, ""Contagion"" lacks power that would make us really worried about the future.",3,Realism of Global Pandemic Not as Gripping as It Should Be,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,1910,"['immediate', 'subject', 'matter', 'global', 'pandemic', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'Contagion', 'how', 'world', 'know', 'slowly', 'chaos', 'people', 'struggling', 'cope', 'survive', 'situation', 'script', 'penned', 'Scott', 'Z.', 'Burns', 'Soderbergh', 'Informant', 'obviously', 'written', 'recent', 'SARS', 'mind', 'film', 'more', 'frightening', 'look', 'crisis', 'caused', 'lethal', 'virus', 'Outbreak', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'bogged', 'down', 'weak', 'writing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'remedied.The', 'medical', 'thriller', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Jude', 'Law', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'doctors', 'researchers', 'world', 'represented', 'characters', 'Cotillard', 'Ehle', 'Fishburne', 'Winslet', 'attempt', 'identify', 'cause', 'widespread', 'disease', 'search', 'cure', 'Jude', 'Law', 'blogger', 'own', 'theory', 'many', 'online', 'Meanwhile', 'story', 'Mitch', 'Beth', 'Emhoff', 'Damon', 'Paltrow', 'married', 'couple', 'two', 'children', 'panic', 'ordinary', 'people', 'seen', 'ordinary', 'family.While', 'director', 'detached', 'approach', 'characters', 'helps', 'create', 'film', 'grim', 'realistic', 'touch', 'familiar', 'stars', 'keep', 'reminding', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'Contagion', 'chilling', 'scenario', 'society', 'struck', 'deadly', 'virus', 'how', 'fear', 'people', 'headlong', 'confusion', 'realism', 'often', 'undermined', 'melodramatic', 'storyline', 'Cotillard', 'character', 'particular', 'turn', 'events', 'seem', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true.Thus', 'Informant', 'Soderbergh', 'styles', 'are', 'curiously', 'odds', 'contents', 'excellent', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'credible', 'moments', 'global', 'pandemic', 'Contagion', 'power', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'worried', 'future']",N/A
1504775,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005WFWVL4,Turfseer,"[1, 19]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***In his new pseudo-documentary, Contagion, Steven Soderbergh has endorsed the idea that modern medicine has taken the place of world religion and elevated the physicians and research scientists to the role of high priests.  Soderbergh is in perfect sync with fear-mongering health organizations such as the CDC, who manufacture health epidemics in order to peddle vaccines to an unsuspecting public, who have gladly given up any sense of individual responsibility for taking care of their own health.  The 'Contagion' is an event that government health bureaucrats probably unconsciously wish for; after all, such an event would confirm all their dire predictions and place them in a position of complete power and control.  Victims in the 'Contagion' must undergo suffering akin to Christ on the cross.  Their rite of 'baptism' is through the modern vaccine, where their 'demons' are exorcised and they end up owing a life-time debt to the medical and research establishment for supposedly saving their life.Unfortunately for modern medicine, contagions as depicted in Soderbergh's film, are strictly a work of complete fiction.  Invariably, every few years, the CDC, partnering with local health organizations, warn of crippling health pandemics, which can only be prevented by mass inoculations (leading to billions of dollars of profits by pharmaceutical companies).  Take, for example, West Nile Virus, one of the latest health scares which was supposed to cause havoc throughout North America.  Usually its small sample of victims turn out to be elderly people who already are suffering from a myriad of health problems.  But of course the pundits of orthodox medicine conclude that all these peoples' problems stem from a single source: a mosquito bite.In Soderbergh's perverse world, alternative practitioners are the 'heretics' who must be suppressed. Jude Law's blogger, Alan Krumweide, has the temerity to expose CDC head Ellis Cheever, who has given advance warning of the impending contagion crisis to family and friends so that they're able to flee Chicago before a quarantine has been imposed. Soderbergh's strategy is to temporarily have Krumweide take down the saintly Cheever a peg, in order to show that he's 'only human'. Later saintly Cheever, gives up his own precious vaccine to save the son of a janitor who works at CDC headquarters. The 'fallen' Cheever (also blamed for delays in the dissemination of an effective vaccine) is restored to the pantheon of saints after his self-sacrifice involving the janitor's son. Meanwhile, Krumweide is exposed as a fraud, after peddling a homeopathic remedy as a cure (which he's surreptitiously marketed to investors) and pretending as well that he's been infected with the virus. Homeland Security partners with modern medicine, just as the Catholic church found their own government allies in bygone days, to take down anyone who dared to question their dogmatic belief systems. Soderbergh is smugly satisfied as the 'evil' blogger is taken away in handcuffs by 'valiant' government security agents!If the imperfect Dr. Cheever is 'canonized' at film's end, there's no need for Dr. Ally Hextall to have her reputation sullied at all. After all, it's Dr. Hextall who identifies the characteristics of the MEV-1 virus , linking it to a genetic mix of bat and pig viruses. Hextall's role here is way beyond a mere priest. She can be likened to a modern day Jesus, a veritable Savior, who miraculously discovers that elusive cure, a vaccine that immediately provides the immunity to the deadly contagion. At the conclusion of 'Contagion', we learn of the pseudo-science behind the MEV-1 virus' origins. It's simply a matter of a bat dropping part of an uneaten banana into a pig's trough. The pig who eats the infected banana ends up in the kitchen of a Macao casino; and because the chef merely forgets to wash his hands, he somehow transmits the virus to Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow). On the other hand, it's unclear why others, such as everyman Mitch Emhoff and his daughter Jory, are immune to the virus, despite close contact with initial victim Beth.If alternative practitioners are directly linked to the work of the devil, bureaucrats who seek to stymie the 'godly' work of vaccine researchers, run a close second. Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) an 'Epidemic Intelligence Officer' is rebuffed by local bureaucrats who are reluctant to commit resources to handle the impending crisis. Worse are the officials who send a ransom of placebos following World Health Organization epidemiologist Orantes's kidnapping by a Chinese epidemiologist after he attempts to save the remaining survivors in his own village who have no access to the 'precious' vaccines. Note more saintly self-sacrifice: Dr. Mears succumbs to the deadly contagion and Orantes nobly runs back to the village to warn them that the vaccines they've obtained, are bogus!In the 1950s, orthodox medicine elevated their first 'miracle worker' to the pantheon of modern day world saviors. That man's name was Dr. Jonas Salk--creator of the polio vaccine. Now Soderbergh wants to outdo even Salk; his 'Contagion' can perhaps be seen as an allegory, likening the deadly plague to cancer itself. Soderbergh's vaccine is so powerful, that it prevents the eradication of the human race.Ultimately, Soderbergh never questions the 'gospel truth' of modern orthodox medicine but always sticks to the 'company line'. Instead he would do well to listen to Edda West who cogently sets the record straight in regards to that earlier 'epidemic' in her article, 'Polio Perspectives': ""That the polio virus is the sole cause of polio is accepted by most people as gospel, and that the Salk and Sabin vaccines eradicated polio in the western world is etched into our collective consciousness as the major medical miracle of our time. But the history of polio and its vaccines is shrouded in a murky mist of politico/scientific manipulation, altered statistics, redefinition and reclassification of the disease, increased cases of vaccine induced paralytic polio, and monkey viruses transmitted by contaminated vaccines to millions of people worldwide.""",1,"For Soderbergh, creators of vaccines are new worldwide

""Outbreak"" is an example of what can go wrong with these type of films. Steven Soderbergh does a really good job of introducing a wide variety of characters (casting well known actors helps us to keep track of who's who)into a story that takes place on a global scale but still impacts humanity on a small, local level.The script by Scott Burns nicely sketches in even minor characters and casting the roles with well known actors helps to bring additional depth to the characters in a largely incident driven script.""Contagion"" provides us with a much more realistic presentation on how medicine and science do battle with a deadly virus that suddenly comes to the forefront. A team of scientists (Kate Winslet, Marion Cottlard, Elliot Gould, Jennifer Ehle)try and crack the genetic code for this virus in a dramatic effort to save lives as pressure is applied to the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne)to come up with a workable vaccine as it becomes clear how deadly the disease becomes. The introduction of the subplot involving a blogger (nicely played by Jude Law)advocating the use of a natural herb and his belief that the government and big Pharma are suppressing the information adds suspense to the story and provides a nice contrast to the main story.The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a sharp presentation with nice skin tones. Black levels and contrast are quite nice. This is an exceptionally nice looking high definition transfer.Audio moves from little to high activity within one scene to the next depending on if the scene is more dialogue or action driven.The special features are quite good as well if a bit on the meager side. We get an 11 minute featurette on the reality of ""Contagion"" where prominent scientists discuss the reality of what we see.

We get a 2 minute PSA and a DVD edition (for the 2 disc edition)of the movie and the dreaded Ultraviolet streaming option as well.Although the film would probably have worked better as a mini-series allowing us to see more detailed, developed characters, ""Contagion"" still manages to be a suspensful ride that shows how a virus can decimate humanity with relative ease in our globe trotting world and how myth/rumor can easily spread like a virus on the internet (and lethal in its own way)that can impact our decisions.I'd suggest a rental because as riveting as this film can be I doubt you'll watch it more than a couple of times.",4,"More realistic (and graphic) than ""Outbreak"" or just about any other ""disease"" movie, ""Contagion"" infects",1325808000,"01 6, 2012",2012,2700,"['very', 'difficult', 'create', 'effective', 'engaging', 'good', 'drama', 'disease', 'Outbreak', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'type', 'films', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'introducing', 'wide', 'variety', 'characters', 'casting', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'story', 'place', 'global', 'scale', 'still', 'humanity', 'small', 'local', 'level.The', 'script', 'Scott', 'Burns', 'nicely', 'even', 'minor', 'characters', 'casting', 'roles', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'bring', 'additional', 'depth', 'characters', 'largely', 'incident', 'driven', 'script', 'Contagion', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'how', 'medicine', 'science', 'do', 'battle', 'deadly', 'virus', 'suddenly', 'forefront', 'team', 'scientists', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Marion', 'Cottlard', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'try', 'crack', 'genetic', 'code', 'virus', 'dramatic', 'effort', 'save', 'lives', 'pressure', 'applied', 'head', 'CDC', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'come', 'up', 'workable', 'vaccine', 'clear', 'how', 'deadly', 'disease', 'introduction', 'subplot', 'involving', 'blogger', 'nicely', 'played', 'Jude', 'Law', 'advocating', 'use', 'natural', 'herb', 'belief', 'government', 'big', 'Pharma', 'are', 'suppressing', 'information', 'suspense', 'story', 'nice', 'contrast', 'main', 'story.The', 'Blu-ray', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'sharp', 'presentation', 'nice', 'skin', 'tones', 'Black', 'levels', 'contrast', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'exceptionally', 'nice', 'looking', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer.Audio', 'moves', 'little', 'high', 'activity', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'depending', 'scene', 'more', 'dialogue', 'action', 'driven.The', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'meager', 'side', 'get', '11', 'minute', 'featurette', 'reality', 'Contagion', 'where', 'prominent', 'scientists', 'discuss', 'reality', 'what', 'see', 'Contagion', 'Detectives', 'brief', '5', 'minutes', 'focusing', 'who', 'decode', 'DNA', 'often', 'lethal', 'virus', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'plan', 'attack', 'developing', 'vaccine', 'disabling', 'virus', 'get', '2', 'minute', 'PSA', 'DVD', 'edition', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'movie', 'dreaded', 'Ultraviolet', 'streaming', 'option', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'mini-series', 'allowing', 'see', 'more', 'detailed', 'developed', 'characters', 'Contagion', 'still', 'be', 'suspensful', 'ride', 'how', 'virus', 'can', 'decimate', 'humanity', 'relative', 'ease', 'globe', 'trotting', 'world', 'how', 'myth/rumor', 'can', 'easily', 'spread', 'virus', 'internet', 'own', 'way', 'can', 'impact', 'decisions.I', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'rental', 'as', 'riveting', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'more', 'couple', 'times']",N/A

1504782,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B005WFWVL4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[3, 3]","Contagion, directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich, The Limey) and written by Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!), is something of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's a highly interesting film about the outbreak of a global pandemic and how various organizations and individuals respond to it.  It has an all-star cast of highly talented actors, it's well researched and intelligently written, and the director manages to follow all of the interweaving sub-stories fairly smoothly.  But all of that said, I found that in the end, except for the odd bit here and there, I was never emotionally engaged by it.  Which, when you remember that you're witnessing the deaths of about half of the characters you see on the screen, is a strong indication that something important is missing.The best part of the film is in the two opening sequences.  In the first sequence, with no real dialogue to speak of, we see a stream of images, of people touching things, of other people then touching those things, then touching themselves, then touching other people, the camera following contact to contact as the viewer is wordlessly shown just how fast and how wide a virus or bacterium could potentially spread.  Then, in the second sequence, the story actually begins on Day Two of the outbreak, and we are shown three individuals - a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a plane coming back to Minnesota from a trip, a young Chinese man (Tien You Chui) in Hong Kong going home from work, and a Japanese businessman (Yoshiaki Kobayashi) on a commuter train in Tokyo - all of whom are all coming down with something. And from these three people, the pandemic proceeds to spread.  The real thing that makes the viewer stay to the end is the final revelation of the mystery:  just where did the virus come from and how were these disparate individuals linked together.  Soderbergh accomplishes this in a clever way which, looking back, should have been obvious from the beginning.  He starts the story at Day Two, but only at the end does he take us back to Day One where all of the clues we are shown along the way are finally tied together.On a technical level, Contagion is praiseworthy for grounding its medical and biological aspects firmly in actual science and in portraying the various government and international health organizations realistically in terms of how they actually respond to infectious outbreaks.  And Contagion is also commendable for showing that not everything goes smoothly, that even in the face of a lethal epidemic, overlapping agencies can be fractious over matters of administrative turf and budget, that commercial considerations can delay critically-needed actions, and that some individuals will take advantage of privilege and power to protect themselves at the expense of others.But for all of its technical accuracy and the clarity of its presentation, Contagion never seems to really connect emotionally.  Part of the reason for this failure to connect on an emotional level is that there really are no surprises. Almost every clich&eacute; that tends to pop up in this genre shows up here.  The doctor who uses herself as a guinea pig to test the vaccine.  The health official who violates ethics by calling to warn his wife to get out of the city before a quarantine is ordered, who in turn ends up telling other people.  The scientist who goes against orders and comes up with a vitally needed discovery.  The riots that ensue when a pharmacy runs out of a medication. Social order breaking down.  About every other character dying at some point.  And finally, a cure is found and the world is saved.  The end.The other part of why Contagion fails to connect is that, in attempting for a global scope, it spreads itself too thin where its characters are concerned.  The ensemble cast is impressive.  Gwyneth Paltrow as Beth Emhoff, the first victim we see succumb to the virus.  Matt Damon as Mitch, her husband, does a creditable job as a man who struggles to cope with the fact that his wife was only coughing the day before and then suddenly goes from seizures to death in a hospital the next, and who then goes home and to find that his young son has died as well. Other myriad roles are filled by high caliber actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Kate Winslet, Bryan Cranston, Jennifer Ehle, Chin Han and others.  There's also a cameo with TV's ubiquitous health authority Dr. Sanjay Gupta as himself.  But all of that acting power ends up largely being wasted because the individual characters are limited in their screen time and character development often ends up being sacrificed to the needs of the plot.  Damon, with Anna Jacoby-Heron as his teen-aged daughter, Jory, gets more screen time than most as the film tries to show what ordinary people would be experiencing in this situation, but again the lack of surprises and the been-there-seen-that feel of their scenes works against him.Two particular performances however are worth pointing out.  Elliot Gould does a low key but perfect turn as Dr. Ian Sussman, a research scientist who decides to follow his instincts and goes against orders to destroy his samples, resulting in a key breakthrough.  In a brief but touching scene, Gould conveys Sussman's weighing the difficulty of his decision just through his facial expression and body language, a masterful performance by a highly underrated actor.  And Jude Law's less than scrupulous freelance blog-journalist Alan Krumwiede (a perfect name for his low-life character) fills the role of the film's only real human villain.  A brief scene between the two gives the film its best single line:  ""Blogging isn't writing,"" an exasperated Gould vents at Law, who's been pestering him for information. ""It's graffiti with punctuation!""  And in another scene with a pharmaceutical rep, Law gets in the film's other memorable line:  ""It's a bad day to be a rhesus monkey.""All in all, Contagion isn't a bad film.  It is interesting if you want a believable and fairly accurate portrayal of just how this scenario would likely unfold.  But the human element is largely lost in the mix, which robs the film of the emotional impact you instinctively feel a film of this sort should have.  Recommended, but adjust your expectations accordingly.",3,"An intelligent and realistic depiction of an epidemic, but it doesn't connect on the emotional level",1317513600,"10 2,

Star-power doesn't guarantee a good flick, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburn, Jude Law, and a flock others do their best to raise this movie a level, and their efforts pay off. The script gives them a chance to do their best - a believable outbreak, as contagious as SARS and as deadly as Ebola starts in a remote corner of the world. It propagates at the speed of jet travel to every major population center, and then the fatalities start to come in. It doesn't reach ""Mad Max"" levels of post-apocalyptic collapse, but does show how social structure sould shudder under the blows. And, in a thoroughly modern touch, the rationality of the CDC is offset by a wingnut internet conspiracy theorist who believes that the government is suppressing life-saving floral extracts.Among all disaster flicks, this stands out for one reason: it gets the science right. Ian Lipkin, M.D. and director of the Northeast Biodefense Center, consulted heavily. The movie virus, although fictional, followed the same path to people via bats and pigs as the real-world Nipah virus did. The movie virus fictionally attacks a genuine human receptor, but the imagined protein actually bonds to a genuine receptor site in biochemical simulations. Lipkin had Winslet pipetting and running gels, and showed Elliot Gould how to handle liquid nitrogen without freezing his hand off (as reported in Science magazine, 2 Sep 2011). Lipkin also suggested the bogus cures spreading across the internet, as actually happened in the SARS outbreak.That said, they didn't do so well on some of the CDC procedures, but hey. They got a big one right, and set the standard for future plague movies.
