As you watch  these episodes you do care  about  what  happens.One of the neat  things about  this series is that  some of the guest  stars were at  the time, not known  and today, they  are well known. One little girl  in one of the episodes titled  ""A Horse From Heaven""  is none other then 10 year  old Christina Applegate!This  DVD  set  consists of 6 DVDs and, this series  is a  series that  really  touches your heart  and, its really sentimental.if you remember this series fondly,  then  you will love owning this series on  DVD!As a sidenote, season  2 ,which  comes  to DVD on January  25th, 2005, will consist  of  13 episodes.",5,A great  sentimental  series!!,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,1106,"['TV', 'series', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'started', '1981', 'ended', '1983', 'time', 'series', 'produced', 'total', '35', 'episodes.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'together', 'complete', 'first', 'season', '21', 'episodes', 'picture', 'quality', 'outstanding', 'always', 'loved', 'watching', 'series', 'fell', 'love', 'girl', 'named', 'Lizette', 'Winkler', 'just', 'so', 'beautiful', 'episode', 'unfolded', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'times', 'bad', 'times', 'watch', 'episodes', 'do', 'care', 'what', 'happens.One', 'neat', 'things', 'series', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'time', 'not', 'known', 'today', 'are', 'well', 'known', 'One', 'little', 'girl', 'one', 'episodes', 'titled', 'Horse', 'Heaven', 'none', 'other', 'then', '10', 'year', 'old', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'DVD', 'set', '6', 'DVDs', 'series', 'series', 'really', 'heart', 'really', 'sentimental.if', 'remember', 'series', 'fondly', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'owning', 'series', 'DVD', 'sidenote', 'season', '2', 'DVD', 'January', '25th', '2005', 'will', 'consist', '13', 'episodes']",Father Murphy - Season 1

Both seasons were great, but what I think really ""killed"" this show was:  (1)Season Two got away from the main theme of Murphy imitating a Franciscan Priest in order to save the orphanage; (2)It followed too closely after the great ""Little House"" series in which Merlin Olsen had a continuing role after Victor French left the show - It was almost like a continuation of the Merlin Olsen Little House character on Father Murphy; and finally, (3) the executive producer of Father Murphy,Michael Landon, began work on his ""Highway to Heaven"" series leading a fan to believe he really wanted to end his ""stint"" with ""period pieces.""",5,In the mold of Little House,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,679,"['thought', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'show', 'seasons', 'were', 'great', 'what', 'think', 'really', 'killed', 'show', 'was', '1', 'Season', 'Two', 'got', 'away', 'main', 'theme', 'Murphy', 'imitating', 'Franciscan', 'Priest', 'order', 'save', 'orphanage', '2', 'followed', 'too', 'closely', 'great', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'Merlin', 'Olsen', 'had', 'continuing', 'role', 'Victor', 'French', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'almost', 'continuation', 'Merlin', 'Olsen', 'Little', 'House', 'character', 'Father', 'Murphy', 'finally', '3', 'executive', 'producer', 'Father', 'Murphy', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'began', 'work', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'series', 'leading', 'fan', 'believe', 'really', 'wanted', 'end', 'stint', 'period', 'pieces']",Father Murphy - Season 1

Has a villain who shows up regularly trying different ways to close the orphanage and send the children to the hated work-house.In real life, Merlin Olsen was a star NFL football player for the LA Rams.""Father Murphy"" is closest to being ""Bonanza"" with kids. ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Road to Avonlea"" are a league above ""Father Murphy"". They have more of everything, bigger budgets, better writers, more charm (depth), more character-acting (Mrs. Olsen), and more character development (opportunity for personality). Several episodes of ""Father Murphy"" do reach the level of ""Little House"". The episode, ""The Horse from Heaven"", is good; the new priest is swindled into using the orphanage's last money to buy a race horse, to win money for food for the orphanage, but later finds that no one has ever been able to break and ride the horse. The tale of Amanda about the bank embezzler doing good deeds is good. Three of the 21 episodes did not interest me. In the league of the ""Christy"" series. The characters are likeable, but not the exceptional star charm of Michael Landon and Melissa Gilbert. ""Little House"" and ""Avonlea"" had the advantage of being based on great books.
