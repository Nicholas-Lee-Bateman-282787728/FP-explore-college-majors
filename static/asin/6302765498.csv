333006,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,6302765498,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[7, 7]","I first saw this movie at like 4:00 AM one night when I was sick. I loved it and thought it was due to my illness. But over the approximately 50 times it was on cable again I came to appreciate it. Molly, you see, goes to a private school by day, earning straight A's and keeping mostly to herself. Sure the resident popular jock thinks she would be good in bed and the geek with red hair has a crush on her - but Angel / Molly has bigger concerns.When she returns home she had a great apartment, but tells her neighbors her mom is sick. You might think that was the big secret but.... then Molly gets all dolled up and goes out to walk Hollywood Blvd. as a hooker.She, and the movie, are fortunate that she has great friends. Dick Shwan, as an older transvestite who walks the streets and looks out for the girls. Susan Tyrell as a lesbian, who hangs with them and watches out for the girls. Both are hysterically funny and truly heartwarming. And a sweet street clown who crushes on a few of the girls knowing they are hookers.All is well until some nut starts killing hookers and a police detective on the case befriends Molly. He cares about her in a platonic / father way and wants her off the streets. Eventually he finds out the truth, Molly's mom just walked out on her and she has no choice but to hook to live. And she has a plan. She will get out via her grades. Heartbreaking even if you knew going in what the situation was. But still a shock at that time.Ultimately after 1980's violence and lots of characters biting the dust, and lots of running in heels that I still don't think anyone can actually do, Molly and the cop team up to find the killer and get him. And they do. At the end of the movie, kind of clear that cop guy is going to get her off the street and she is done with that life and on to something better.It is a little violent and kind of has a lot of 80's dating to it, but has a tight script and some great performances. Sometimes a little cheap cheezy sounding flick can come out pretty good.",5,Excellent Movie,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,2027,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', '4:00', 'AM', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'was', 'sick', 'loved', 'thought', 'was', 'due', 'illness', 'approximately', '50', 'times', 'was', 'cable', 'again', 'came', 'appreciate', 'Molly', 'see', 'private', 'school', 'day', 'earning', 'straight', 'A', 'keeping', 'mostly', 'resident', 'popular', 'jock', 'thinks', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'bed', 'geek', 'red', 'hair', 'crush', 'Angel', '/', 'Molly', 'bigger', 'concerns.When', 'home', 'had', 'great', 'apartment', 'neighbors', 'mom', 'sick', 'might', 'think', 'was', 'big', 'secret', 'then', 'Molly', 'dolled', 'up', 'out', 'walk', 'Hollywood', 'Blvd', 'hooker.She', 'movie', 'are', 'fortunate', 'great', 'friends', 'Dick', 'Shwan', 'older', 'transvestite', 'who', 'streets', 'out', 'girls', 'Susan', 'Tyrell', 'lesbian', 'who', 'out', 'girls', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'truly', 'heartwarming', 'sweet', 'street', 'clown', 'who', 'crushes', 'few', 'girls', 'knowing', 'are', 'hookers.All', 'well', 'nut', 'starts', 'killing', 'hookers', 'police', 'detective', 'case', 'Molly', 'platonic', '/', 'father', 'way', 'streets', 'Eventually', 'out', 'truth', 'Molly', 'mom', 'just', 'walked', 'out', 'choice', 'hook', 'live', 'plan', 'will', 'get', 'out', 'grades', 'Heartbreaking', 'even', 'knew', 'going', 'what', 'situation', 'was', 'still', 'shock', 'time.Ultimately', '1980', 'violence', 'lots', 'characters', 'biting', 'dust', 'lots', 'running', 'heels', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'actually', 'do', 'Molly', 'cop', 'team', 'up', 'find', 'killer', 'get', 'do', 'end', 'movie', 'kind', 'clear', 'cop', 'guy', 'going', 'get', 'off', 'street', 'done', 'life', 'something', 'better.It', 'little', 'violent', 'kind', 'lot', '80', 'dating', 'tight', 'script', 'great', 'performances', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'cheap', 'cheezy', 'sounding', 'flick', 'can', 'come', 'out', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A
