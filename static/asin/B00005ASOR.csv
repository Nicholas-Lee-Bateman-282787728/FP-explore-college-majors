578532,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00005ASOR,Anyechka,"[2, 2]","This beautiful brilliant film is ample proof of why F.W. Murnau was one of the finest directors of the silent era.  He may not have churned out as many films as the likes of, say, Ernst Lubitsch or Thomas Ince, but he proved that quality can be more meaningful than quantity.  He was more interested in pure artistic creative vision than in churning out a lot of films in a short timespan to make a lot of money and be hailed as a commercial success.  What makes this film even more brilliant is the fact that it's told entirely devoid of intertitles, but for some writing on a cake, a letter, a newspaper article, and the text introducing the epilogue.  And yet the film doesn't suffer at all from no explanatory intertitles or dialogue.  Those would actually get in the way and interrupt the flow of this beautiful perfect story of a lonely old man dealing with an increasingly low point in his life.  The best directors of the silent era tried not to over-rely upon intertitles for this very reason, and felt that a really good story could tell itself on its own merits.The plot seems simple enough.  An old doorman at the posh Atlantic Hotel, Emil Jannings, is very proud of his position and his imperial-looking uniform, though many of his neighbors feel he's too full of himself over his high position.  Today one might not think of a hotel doorman/porter as being a very important job at all, but one has to remember that not only does he live in the poor side of town, but also what the economic situation in Germany was like during the Twenties.  A hotel porter living in the slums would have been considered like a prince in this era of off-the-charts inflation and national depression and malaise over the heavy handed treatment it was being given after having lost the First World War.  One day, however, he discovers that another man has taken his job, and finds himself demoted to the position held by the hotel's oldest employee, who has just retired--the lowly, menial, humiliating job of a bathroom attendant.  (It's hard to believe that once such a position actually existed; it just seems lazy that anyone would expect someone to hand them a towel and soap and dry their hands and turn the water on for them instead of doing it themselves!  This part of the plot also really hit home for me, since I had a temp job in an insurance company after graduating college but after only a month or so was told that the job I'd been doing was going to be finished by someone within the company, and my next temp job after that was cleaning the bathrooms in that very same building where I'd once had a more prestigious and less humiliating position.)  This really depresses the old man, and he rankles under the treatment he gets from the people using the bathroom, but he doesn't want to tell his family the truth, so he pretends he's still working as the doorman.  The ruse doesn't hold up, and when it's discovered, he becomes the laughingstock of the whole neighborhood.  Emil Jannings does a super job at portraying this lonely anguished old man's heartbreaking poignant emotional journey.  The ending is also fantastic; though it does rather go against everything that's been established in this poignant character study, to have just ended the film on the depressing note before the epilogue begins would seem wrong.  Hasn't this poor old man already suffered enough slings and arrows?  He deserves a happy ending and to have ""the last laugh.""This film is easily one of the finest films of the silent era, for its brilliance in telling an entire story with nary an interruption for an intertitle but instead a constantly fluid camera doing the work, and possibly could also be considered one of the finest films period.  It does so much with so little, and makes one wonder if film-making has really advanced that much since the Twenties.  One does not need constant talk, be it through spoken dialogue or printed intertitles, to create a beautiful film with a convincing compelling understandable storyline.",5,Brilliant,1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,4025,"['beautiful', 'brilliant', 'film', 'ample', 'proof', 'why', 'F.W', 'Murnau', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'directors', 'silent', 'era', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'churned', 'out', 'many', 'films', 'likes', 'say', 'Ernst', 'Lubitsch', 'Thomas', 'Ince', 'proved', 'quality', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'meaningful', 'quantity', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'pure', 'artistic', 'creative', 'vision', 'churning', 'out', 'lot', 'films', 'short', 'timespan', 'make', 'lot', 'money', 'be', 'hailed', 'commercial', 'success', 'What', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'told', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'intertitles', 'writing', 'cake', 'letter', 'newspaper', 'article', 'text', 'introducing', 'epilogue', 'yet', 'film', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'explanatory', 'intertitles', 'dialogue', 'would', 'actually', 'get', 'way', 'interrupt', 'flow', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'story', 'lonely', 'old', 'man', 'dealing', 'increasingly', 'low', 'point', 'life', 'best', 'directors', 'silent', 'era', 'tried', 'not', 'over-rely', 'upon', 'intertitles', 'very', 'reason', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'could', 'tell', 'own', 'merits.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'old', 'doorman', 'posh', 'Atlantic', 'Hotel', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'very', 'proud', 'position', 'imperial-looking', 'uniform', 'many', 'neighbors', 'feel', 'too', 'full', 'high', 'position', 'Today', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'think', 'hotel', 'doorman/porter', 'being', 'very', 'important', 'job', 'one', 'remember', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'poor', 'side', 'town', 'also', 'what', 'economic', 'situation', 'Germany', 'was', 'Twenties', 'hotel', 'porter', 'living', 'slums', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'prince', 'era', 'off-the-charts', 'inflation', 'national', 'depression', 'malaise', 'heavy', 'handed', 'treatment', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'having', 'lost', 'First', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'day', 'however', 'man', 'taken', 'job', 'demoted', 'position', 'held', 'hotel', 'oldest', 'employee', 'who', 'just', 'retired', 'lowly', 'menial', 'humiliating', 'job', 'bathroom', 'attendant', 'hard', 'believe', 'once', 'such', 'position', 'actually', 'existed', 'just', 'lazy', 'anyone', 'would', 'expect', 'someone', 'hand', 'towel', 'soap', 'dry', 'hands', 'turn', 'water', 'instead', 'doing', 'part', 'plot', 'also', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'had', 'temp', 'job', 'insurance', 'company', 'graduating', 'college', 'only', 'month', 'so', 'was', 'told', 'job', ""'d"", 'been', 'doing', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'finished', 'someone', 'company', 'next', 'temp', 'job', 'was', 'cleaning', 'bathrooms', 'very', 'same', 'building', 'where', ""'d"", 'once', 'had', 'more', 'prestigious', 'less', 'humiliating', 'position', 'really', 'old', 'man', 'treatment', 'people', 'using', 'bathroom', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'family', 'truth', 'still', 'working', 'doorman', 'ruse', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'when', 'discovered', 'laughingstock', 'whole', 'neighborhood', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'super', 'job', 'portraying', 'lonely', 'anguished', 'old', 'man', 'heartbreaking', 'poignant', 'emotional', 'journey', 'ending', 'also', 'fantastic', 'rather', 'go', 'everything', 'been', 'established', 'poignant', 'character', 'study', 'have', 'just', 'ended', 'film', 'depressing', 'note', 'epilogue', 'would', 'seem', 'wrong', 'Has', ""n't"", 'poor', 'old', 'man', 'already', 'suffered', 'enough', 'slings', 'arrows', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'last', 'laugh', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'brilliance', 'telling', 'entire', 'story', 'nary', 'interruption', 'intertitle', 'instead', 'constantly', 'fluid', 'camera', 'doing', 'work', 'possibly', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'period', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'one', 'wonder', 'film-making', 'really', 'advanced', 'much', 'Twenties', 'One', 'not', 'need', 'constant', 'talk', 'be', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'printed', 'intertitles', 'create', 'beautiful', 'film', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'understandable', 'storyline']",N/A
578533,A1S0B6U13Y0F6N,B00005ASOR,"Ben Parker ""Cheshire""","[2, 2]","F. W Murnau works are rare things - he made very few compared to other directors of his day, and many of those he did make have been lost. The reason he made so few can perhaps be understood by watching The Last Laugh. Like Chaplin, Kubrick and Leone, the effort that went into a single picture was the same effort another director might spread across ten. Nosferatu, his famous Dracula story, is great, and i hear his Faust and Sunrise are also things to behold - but many regard &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; as his masterwork, and also one of the greatest movies of all time. Lillian Gish once said that she never approved of the talkies - she felt that silents were starting to create a whole new art form. She was right, but the proof of this can not be seen in the work of Griffith, who was her frequent collaborator, and who she probably was thinking about when she made this statement - but in the work of German director F. W Murnau.D. W Griffith is usually shunned for his stance on racial issues and praised for his abilities as an influential film artist. I believe he doesn't deserve this praise - and this movie is why. Not only was Griffith about as subtle as a migraine, but watching a Griffith silent, you get more words than images. There's a title card telling you what is about to happen in every image before it does. The images themselves are almost unnecessary - his style is more literary than cinematic. The difference between watching Griffith's Intolerance and watching F. W Murnau's The Last Laugh is like the difference between watching a silent comedy by Hal Roach and one by Charlie Chaplin. The latter of each pair (Murnau and Chaplin) were visualists and artists, using few words, constructing beauty and high emotion through seemingly simple situations (a tramp who discovers a lost child, or a hotel doorman who loses his job, which is the basis of The Last Laugh).Silent directors strove to and were praised for their ability to tell stories through images alone, as much as possible, and this is one of the reasons silent cinema reached its pinnacle in F. W Murnau's The Last Laugh - which tells the story of a proud hotel doorman (Emil Jennings), who, after many years of service, is demoted from his position to a mens' bathroom attendant. Murnau tells an incredibly sensitive and human tale, showing how much the job meant to him by having him go to work instead of going to his daughter's wedding. He shows how the position made him respected in his neighbourhood, and how he could not face the neighbourhood without his doorman's uniform. And he tells the story almost entirely through images.There are no title cards telling us what the images are - they are allowed to speak for themselves. The few words used are worked in through letters and signs. Many silent directors cheated and used title cards to explain the images, but only in this movie did the art form of silent movies, which Lillian Gish refers to, take shape.I was amazed at the level of depth and emotional complexity that Murnau was capable of conveying without resorting to title cards (or their equivalent in talkies, the voiceover). This movie is also noteable for its brilliant use of expressionism, and the first brilliant use of a tracking shot. In Murnau's The Last Laugh, silent movies metaphorically were given movement, and learned to run.",5,The Pinnacle of Silent Cinema,1079654400,"03 19, 2004",2004,3357,"['F.', 'W', 'Murnau', 'works', 'are', 'rare', 'things', 'made', 'very', 'few', 'compared', 'other', 'directors', 'day', 'many', 'did', 'make', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'reason', 'made', 'so', 'few', 'can', 'perhaps', 'be', 'understood', 'watching', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'Chaplin', 'Kubrick', 'Leone', 'effort', 'went', 'single', 'picture', 'was', 'same', 'effort', 'director', 'might', 'spread', 'ten', 'Nosferatu', 'famous', 'Dracula', 'story', 'great', 'i', 'hear', 'Faust', 'Sunrise', 'are', 'also', 'things', 'behold', 'many', 'regard', 'quot', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'quot', 'masterwork', 'also', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'once', 'said', 'never', 'approved', 'talkies', 'felt', 'silents', 'were', 'starting', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'art', 'form', 'was', 'right', 'proof', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'work', 'Griffith', 'who', 'was', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'who', 'probably', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'made', 'statement', 'work', 'German', 'director', 'F.', 'W', 'Murnau.D', 'W', 'Griffith', 'usually', 'shunned', 'stance', 'racial', 'issues', 'praised', 'abilities', 'influential', 'film', 'artist', 'believe', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'praise', 'movie', 'why', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'Griffith', 'as', 'subtle', 'migraine', 'watching', 'Griffith', 'silent', 'get', 'more', 'words', 'images', 'title', 'card', 'telling', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'image', 'images', 'are', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'style', 'more', 'literary', 'cinematic', 'difference', 'watching', 'Griffith', 'Intolerance', 'watching', 'F.', 'W', 'Murnau', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'difference', 'watching', 'silent', 'comedy', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'latter', 'pair', 'Murnau', 'Chaplin', 'were', 'visualists', 'artists', 'using', 'few', 'words', 'constructing', 'beauty', 'high', 'emotion', 'seemingly', 'simple', 'situations', 'tramp', 'who', 'lost', 'child', 'hotel', 'doorman', 'who', 'job', 'basis', 'Last', 'Laugh', '.Silent', 'directors', 'strove', 'were', 'praised', 'ability', 'tell', 'stories', 'images', 'alone', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'one', 'reasons', 'silent', 'cinema', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'F.', 'W', 'Murnau', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'story', 'proud', 'hotel', 'doorman', 'Emil', 'Jennings', 'who', 'many', 'years', 'service', 'demoted', 'position', 'mens', 'bathroom', 'attendant', 'Murnau', 'incredibly', 'sensitive', 'human', 'tale', 'showing', 'how', 'much', 'job', 'meant', 'having', 'go', 'work', 'instead', 'going', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'how', 'position', 'made', 'respected', 'neighbourhood', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'face', 'neighbourhood', 'doorman', 'uniform', 'story', 'almost', 'entirely', 'are', 'title', 'cards', 'telling', 'what', 'images', 'are', 'are', 'allowed', 'speak', 'few', 'words', 'used', 'are', 'worked', 'letters', 'signs', 'Many', 'silent', 'directors', 'cheated', 'used', 'title', 'cards', 'explain', 'images', 'only', 'movie', 'did', 'art', 'form', 'silent', 'movies', 'Lillian', 'Gish', 'refers', 'take', 'shape.I', 'was', 'amazed', 'level', 'depth', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Murnau', 'was', 'capable', 'conveying', 'resorting', 'title', 'cards', 'equivalent', 'talkies', 'voiceover', 'movie', 'also', 'noteable', 'brilliant', 'use', 'expressionism', 'first', 'brilliant', 'use', 'tracking', 'shot', 'Murnau', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'silent', 'movies', 'metaphorically', 'were', 'given', 'movement', 'learned', 'run']",N/A
578534,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B00005ASOR,Brad Baker,"[3, 3]","1924's &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; is a short, simple, direct tale of an elderly hotel doorman. Becoming complacent, he is smugly replaced by a younger man, and assigned to work in the washroom. Shocked and ashamed, he steals his old uniform to hide his fate from family and friends. A whirlwind of symbolism, the opening scene dances down a moving, mechanical elevator.  Director F.W. Murnau tosses in multiple-image montages(all composed in the camera), hallucinatory lighting effects, scenes filmed through glass, and what is probably the first portable, hand-held camera shots.  &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; was written by Carl Mayer.  Paul Rotha's &quot;Film Till Now&quot; relates that Mayer &quot;was a careful, patient worker. He would take days over a few shots. He would rather return the money than be forced to finish a script the wrong way. Film mattered most. His little money he gave away to make others happy&quot;.  &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; was an unequaled example of universal co-operation: Director F.W. Murnau, cameraman Karl Freund(who filmed &quot;Dracula&quot; 7 years later), Carl Mayer, and the great German actor Emil Jannings.  &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; DVD contains the unusual &quot;happy&quot;, alternate ending, chapter stops, and several photo stills. After &quot;Faust&quot; in 1926, Murnau was whisked away to America, where he bought extravagant autos and a racing yacht. Talking movies emerged in 1927, but Murnau's final effort, &quot;Tabu&quot;, contained no dialogue.  F.W. Murnau's sound-film talents will never be known.

Murnau didn't have a typical storyline - he could do pure Gothic horror as in Nosferatu, social commentary as in Phantom, fantasy with a religious theme as in Faust, and the redemption of love as in Sunrise. What ties Murnau's work together is its imagery. He excelled at it as few directors ever did. ""The Last Laugh"" is a tale about an older man who is proud of his position as doorman at a prominent German hotel. One night he has had to carry some heavy luggage as part of his duties and he takes a break. As luck would have it, his supervisor sees him taking this short rest and assumes the worst. The next day the old man is reassigned to the job of washroom attendant. He does his best to hide his change of position from his friends, but they find out anyway. To make matters worse, they assume he's always been lying about his job and that he has thus always been a washroom attendant. At this point you might wonder - why exactly is this film named The Last Laugh? There is a somewhat tacked on ending that is the foundation of the film's title. I won't spoil it for you.This is a two disc edition because there are two versions of the film included. The extras include a 40 minute documentary on the making of The Last Laugh that was included with the last edition of the film that was inThe F.W. Murnau Collection (Nosferatu/The Last Laugh/Faust/Tabu/Tartuffe). I thought that the video was perfectly clear on that version, so I'm curious to see what further remastering has done for the visual clarity of the film. The documentary is well-done and quite detailed. This somewhat surprised me since if Kino has a flaw in its DVD productions it is this - it sometimes misses the point entirely of multimedia presentation and of the extra space DVD affords you for extra features. I personally want commentary and featurettes to go with these films, not the text notes that Kino often includes that leave me - at age 50 - squinting at the TV screen.",5,An example of Murnau at his best,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,1963,"['F.W', 'Murnau', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'typical', 'storyline', 'could', 'do', 'pure', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'Nosferatu', 'social', 'commentary', 'Phantom', 'fantasy', 'religious', 'theme', 'Faust', 'redemption', 'love', 'Sunrise', 'What', 'Murnau', 'work', 'together', 'imagery', 'excelled', 'few', 'directors', 'ever', 'did', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'tale', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'proud', 'position', 'doorman', 'prominent', 'German', 'hotel', 'One', 'night', 'had', 'carry', 'heavy', 'luggage', 'part', 'duties', 'break', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'supervisor', 'taking', 'short', 'rest', 'worst', 'next', 'day', 'old', 'man', 'reassigned', 'job', 'washroom', 'attendant', 'best', 'hide', 'change', 'position', 'friends', 'find', 'out', 'anyway', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'assume', 'always', 'been', 'lying', 'job', 'thus', 'always', 'been', 'washroom', 'attendant', 'point', 'might', 'wonder', 'why', 'exactly', 'film', 'named', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'somewhat', 'tacked', 'ending', 'foundation', 'film', 'title', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.This', 'two', 'disc', 'edition', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'film', 'included', 'extras', 'include', '40', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'was', 'included', 'last', 'edition', 'film', 'was', 'inThe', 'F.W', 'Murnau', 'Collection', 'Nosferatu/The', 'Last', 'Laugh/Faust/Tabu/Tartuffe', 'thought', 'video', 'was', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'version', ""'m"", 'curious', 'see', 'what', 'further', 'remastering', 'done', 'visual', 'clarity', 'film', 'documentary', 'well-done', 'quite', 'detailed', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'Kino', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'productions', 'point', 'entirely', 'multimedia', 'presentation', 'extra', 'space', 'DVD', 'affords', 'extra', 'features', 'personally', 'want', 'commentary', 'featurettes', 'go', 'films', 'not', 'text', 'Kino', 'often', 'leave', 'age', '50', 'squinting', 'TV', 'screen']",N/A

You haven't been reading your internet movie reviews. At a variety of movie sites you can read reviews of movies that are seen before the films are released. Sometimes you can read reviews of scripts before a film is even produced. Often the reviewers will warn *minor spoilers* or *major spoilers*, depending on whether they plan on giving away minor plot details or every twist and turn in the story.Some people like spoilers, some don't.I prefer not to know what's going to happen in the movies I watch and the books I read; I want to be surprised. On the other hand, my wife Mindy often reads the ends of novels before deciding if she wants to go on reading. She does this with mysteries. This is a mystery to me.Some people like spoilers, some don't.*Major Spoilers*! I plan on giving away the whole plot of a certain film, and not only that, but some major spoilers about life itself.So if you were planning on rushing out to rent F.W. Murau's silent German Expressionist classic The Last Laugh, and you don't want to know how it ends, quit reading now!Emil Jannings plays the doorman (or porter) of an elite German hotel. He is proud of his job and especially proud of his gaudy uniform. When he returns from work to his dilapidated tenement, his neighbors treat him with deference and respect because of his big lapels and shiny buttons.But the doorman is getting on in years, and when the manager of the hotel sees him take a long break after struggling with heavy luggage, the manager demotes him to restroom attendant.The new job does not have the status of doorman and does not have a uniform.So the former doorman decides to steal a uniform so he can still wear it when he's back in his neighborhood. But when a neighbor spies him at work in the restroom, he becomes the laughing stock of the neighborhood.The man breaks down in tears when he returns the uniform to the hotel security guard. And then the film makers show one of the most amazing title cards in silent films.I'm paraphrasing a bit, but the card says something like this: ""In real life, the porter would have little to look forward to, except his own death. However, the writer took pity upon the man and added this unexpected epilogue.""The film then shows guests in the hotel laughing as they read a newspaper article. The article tells about a millionaire who died in the arms of a hotel restroom attendant. The millionaire's last will and testament specified that his entire fortune would go to the person who held him as he died.The final minutes of the film show the former doorman of the hotel enjoying the hotel's luxuries, along with his friend the security guard. The film ends with the new millionaire tipping all of the bell staff before riding off in a convertible.The title card that changes the doorman's fortune is a classic ""Deus ex machine"" device (or `God from the machine'). This is a phrase that originated in Greek drama, when the writer would paint his characters into such a difficult situation that the only solution was an arbitrary plot intervention by one of the many Greek gods.It is usually quite an annoying device in a play, book or film.If an ordinary Western story concludes with a UFO blasting the bad guy with lasers in the climatic gun fight or a parent's objection to the love match in a Victorian romance resolved by having Dr. Phil enter in and give counsel, the audience is understandably upset.But somehow, this device works in The Last Laugh, because the film makers are so transparent about its use. A (slightly) more recent use of blatant ""Deus ex machine"" is found in Wayne's World. The film appears to be ending with our hero Wayne losing the girl and the villain triumphant. But Wayne speaks to the camera and suggests a different ending. They first try the Scooby Doo ending (""I would have succeeded, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids"") and then finish with the mega-happy ending.I think the ""God from the machine"" device works because there is an acknowledgement of a creator outside of the fictional world.

578537,A2HZFST16PHKSC,B00005ASOR,D. Hutchins,"[0, 0]","Sometime in the early '70s, I watched a weekly UHF series, which showcased cinematic masterpieces. It was hosted by Charles Champlain. After he introduced the particular film for that week, he proceeded to play the film itself. Afterward, there was some discussipon about the film that was just shown.Some were titles I was familiar with; others were unknown to me. But every one of them were cinematic works of art. I remember seeing &quot;The Cabinet Of Doctor Caliagri&quot;, Eisenstein's &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; and &quot;Ivan The Terrible, Part I&quot;, Cocteau's &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot;, as well as Kurosawa's &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. I remember the level of film-making quality, and thinking I never saw anything prior to what I saw in these films, to compare to what these films offered. They were not just thought-provoking, but they, very often, had a human or a dramatic, aspect to them which most commercial films never captured. I was enjoying the beginning of an education in the history of cinema.Another treat in that film series was Murnau's &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;. It wasn't just the story of a working man, and what happened to him when the source of his pride and satisfation was gone, which gripped me. It was also about how the film depicted the &quot;neighbors&quot; and &quot;friends&quot;, who took delight in the doorman'ss humiliation, and how other employees, except for one, were more concerned about their own loyalty to the hotel, rather than expressing personal sympathy. It's a very human story, told in a very simple, but occasionally expressionistic, way.Other reviewers have remarked about the fluid camera work, and the fact of Murnau's using just one title card. I agree that both of those elements contribute to making &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; a memorable film. I'd also add that Emil Jannings should get credit for his stunning, tragic performance.

It's one of the most beautiful, sad, haunting, and innovative silent films ever made.  It is also famous for the fact it is told (except for one) without title cards.  It is told with nothing but visual imagery.  It concerns itself with a doorman who ends up being demoted to washroom attendant.  The man (played brilliantly by Emil Jannings) is very proud of himself and his station, then is told that he is being demoted simply to make room for the young guard.  You really feel for Jennings's character.  How often are you passed over for a promotion or feel that your long tenure of service is not appreciated?  Murnau treats the subject with a deep humanism, making the film more powerful.The cinematography is outstanding.  Murnau's framing is immaculate, and it's to his credit that his visual style is so acute that he can tell this story with only images.  There is only one title card, but it's a rather self conscious one, and it leads to the ""happy"" ending, which is so overplayed and boisterous one thinks that Murnau is just placing it as a farce.

Why?Well, for one, I just got discharged from active duty service in the Army. I lived in a barracks at Fort Dix, NJ, and watched DVD movies on my laptop computer.  So, after buying this gem of a flick, I rushed back to my room to watch it.Nada.Unfortunately, Kino Video -- a company that wants to be noted for its sterling film preservation efforts and highest quality transfers -- was not content with simply letting me watch this disc. No, instead, Kino used this disc as a veritable Trojan horse to smuggle a program called ""PC Friendly DVD"" onto my hard drive. Naturally, there was no labelling at all on the packaging, to let me know that Kino had ulterior motives, but I nonetheless loaded the program onto my hard drive, that I may watch this movie.Ah, but there's one more catch: Once the software downloaded, a pop-up window came along to add insult to injury. Seems that even though I let Kino download a program onto my laptop without my consent, I then needed to register the damn thing before I could watch this movie! Talk about gall!Problem was: My barracks room did not have an internet connection, so I couldn't register their software, thus was I verboten from being able to view this movie until I arrived back at home, sweet home, back in Texas, and was able to watch it on my home DVD player.I talked to an Army buddy who bought Kino's release of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,"" and he was unable to watch it on HIS laptop computer.

This film about an elderly man who loses his indentity is so brilliantly crafted that it requires absolutely no subtitles. You understand what the person is saying in any lanquage and even though the actors are mute. I've not experienced that before in a silent picture.It's true that there are certain similarities between THE BLUE ANGEL where Jennings' Professor goes way overboard in a late life crush on an amoral tart (Marlene Deitrich in a career-making role) & Jennings' Hotel Doorman in THE LAST LAUGH. The main difference is that the Professor chose his way to ruin, the Doorman has it forced upon him by his employer.This is a story that is as relvant today as it was in post-World War I Germany when the film was made. It reminded me very much the 1950's Italian film, UMBERTO, D. Both films address the theme of how indifferently (at best) society tends to treat the elderly. For the Doorman, his entire life is defined by his job. His emotional disintegration is almost too painful to watch.Some viewers may object to the Epilogue tacked on to the conclusion. I was a little puzzeled by it myself at first, but soon realized that it was a perfect ending for this intense character study of a somewhat foolish, harmless old man who didn't deserve all the cruelty heaped upon him--but who does get THE LAST LAUGH in the end.I give this film the highest recommendation to purchase or to rent.",5,No Need for Subtitles,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,1534,"['FW', 'Murnau', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'silent', 'film', 'directors', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'Fritz', 'Lange', 'Emil', 'Jennings', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'indentity', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'absolutely', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'what', 'person', 'saying', 'lanquage', 'even', 'actors', 'are', 'mute', ""'ve"", 'not', 'experienced', 'before', 'silent', 'picture.It', 'true', 'are', 'certain', 'similarities', 'THE', 'BLUE', 'ANGEL', 'where', 'Jennings', 'Professor', 'way', 'overboard', 'late', 'life', 'crush', 'amoral', 'tart', 'Marlene', 'Deitrich', 'career-making', 'role', 'Jennings', 'Hotel', 'Doorman', 'THE', 'LAST', 'LAUGH', 'main', 'difference', 'Professor', 'chose', 'way', 'ruin', 'Doorman', 'forced', 'employer.This', 'story', 'relvant', 'today', 'was', 'post-World', 'War', 'Germany', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', '1950', 'Italian', 'film', 'UMBERTO', 'D.', 'Both', 'films', 'address', 'theme', 'how', 'indifferently', 'best', 'society', 'treat', 'elderly', 'Doorman', 'entire', 'life', 'defined', 'job', 'emotional', 'disintegration', 'almost', 'too', 'painful', 'watch.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'object', 'Epilogue', 'tacked', 'conclusion', 'was', 'little', 'puzzeled', 'first', 'soon', 'realized', 'was', 'perfect', 'ending', 'intense', 'character', 'study', 'somewhat', 'foolish', 'harmless', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'cruelty', 'heaped', 'who', 'get', 'LAST', 'LAUGH', 'end.I', 'give', 'film', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'purchase', 'rent']",N/A

The man snatches one for himself, and of course leaves no tip.It seemed to me that nobody was supposed to believe the happy tacked-on ending, in which someone leaves him a million marks, and, with the one man who didn't laugh at him--a fellow worker--celebrates by having a sumpteous meal in an elegant restaurant, and drives off in a coach and four with his friend. It is between Jannings' failure as a washroom attendant (when we see him fading into the dark color of the washroom walls) and the ""happy ending"" that we see the one card, which clearly says: life doesn't go this way, but for this occasion, we are going to pretend that life goes the way it doesn't.The original title of the film was ""The Last Man,"" not ""The Last Laugh."" There is a sex joke involved in the title,  and the million marks Jannings inherits, so of course the title was changed. (The fact that Jannings has nothing to do with sex makes it all the funnier---ha. ha. ha.) NOTHING about this film will tickle your ribs!One thing that was so shocking about the film is that as soon as Jannings' fortunes change for the worse, everyone laughs at him! I found myself thinking: when the Eskimos put the old man or woman out on an ice floe to die, because he/she could no longer be of any use to the community, DID THEY LAUGH AT HIM? I asked the film owner about this, and he started explaining about how the Germans in the '20s had no hearts, and went on and on about the treaty of Versailles....hey! I am very familiar with some Germans who lived through the '20s, and they didn't all laugh at the unfortunate. As with all other people, some did and some didn't.  The closer you are to being in Jannings' shoes, the more likely you were to laugh at him. But the rich laughed too...The faces in Murnau's films speak volumes; everyone's soul is layed bare. Murnau  make you ralize how actually unnecessary language is most of the time, and how simple so many stories are. The film is perfectly crafted. The only question is: can you stand it?I don't want to see it again. It is my third favorite Murnau film (the glorious ""Sunrisre"" and the terrifying ""Nosferatu"" tying for first and second).But you gotta see it once. And maybe...don't laugh at the misfortunes of others, no matter how foolish they are.",5,"As in ""The Blue Angel,"" Emil Jannings makes me want to die.",1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,3216,"['poor', 'old', 'doorman', 'so', 'PROUD', 'job', 'uniform', 'work', 'one', 'day', 'out', 'been', 'replaced', 'worst', 'possible', 'way', 'someone', 'else', 'already', 'doing', 'job', 'Then', 'when', 'see', 'boss', 'handed', 'slip', 'saying', 'been', 'working', 'there', 'so', 'long', 'hotel', 'management', 'decided', 'put', 'oldest', 'employee', 'home', 'give', 'fellow', 'job', 'giving', 'viewer', 'yet', 'man', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Jannings', 'that', 'even', 'washroom', 'attendant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'either', 'heavy', 'trunk', 'boss', 'floor', 'prove', 'still', 'capable', 'being', 'doorman', 'lift', 'sort', 'stroke', 'rest', 'film', 'walks', 'around', 'conscious', 'only', 'part', 'time', 'unable', 'stand', 'up', 'straight', 'sink', 'man', 'hands', 'arms', 'full', 'little', 'towels', ""n't"", 'offer', 'man', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'course', 'tip.It', 'seemed', 'nobody', 'was', 'supposed', 'believe', 'happy', 'tacked-on', 'ending', 'someone', 'million', 'marks', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'fellow', 'worker', 'celebrates', 'having', 'sumpteous', 'meal', 'elegant', 'restaurant', 'off', 'coach', 'four', 'friend', 'Jannings', 'failure', 'washroom', 'attendant', 'when', 'see', 'fading', 'dark', 'color', 'washroom', 'walls', 'happy', 'ending', 'see', 'one', 'card', 'clearly', 'life', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'occasion', 'are', 'going', 'pretend', 'life', 'way', 'original', 'title', 'film', 'was', 'Last', 'Man', 'not', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'sex', 'joke', 'involved', 'title', 'million', 'marks', 'Jannings', 'inherits', 'course', 'title', 'was', 'changed', 'fact', 'Jannings', 'nothing', 'do', 'sex', 'funnier', '-ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'NOTHING', 'film', 'will', 'tickle', 'ribs', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'Jannings', 'fortunes', 'change', 'worse', 'everyone', 'laughs', 'found', 'thinking', 'when', 'Eskimos', 'put', 'old', 'man', 'woman', 'out', 'ice', 'floe', 'die', 'he/she', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'use', 'community', 'DID', 'THEY', 'LAUGH', 'AT', 'HIM', 'asked', 'film', 'owner', 'started', 'explaining', 'how', 'Germans', ""'20s"", 'had', 'hearts', 'went', 'treaty', 'Versailles', '.hey', 'am', 'very', 'familiar', 'Germans', 'who', 'lived', ""'20s"", 'did', ""n't"", 'all', 'laugh', 'unfortunate', 'other', 'people', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'closer', 'are', 'being', 'Jannings', 'shoes', 'more', 'likely', 'were', 'laugh', 'rich', 'laughed', 'too', 'Murnau', 'films', 'speak', 'volumes', 'everyone', 'soul', 'layed', 'bare', 'Murnau', 'make', 'ralize', 'how', 'actually', 'unnecessary', 'language', 'most', 'time', 'how', 'simple', 'so', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'film', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'only', 'question', 'can', 'stand', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'again', 'third', 'favorite', 'Murnau', 'film', 'glorious', 'Sunrisre', 'terrifying', 'Nosferatu', 'tying', 'first', 'second', '.But', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'once', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'misfortunes', 'others', 'matter', 'how', 'foolish', 'are']",N/A

The absence of sound, and in fact, the near absence of words via title cards, is especially appropriate for the film's depiction of loneliness, despair, and mental stupor.  Sound could add little, if anything at all, to the towering performance by Emil Jannings (who was actually much younger than his character), who conveys a wide array of emotions with only body gestures and facial expressions.To correct the technical info above, this Kino DVD edition is for ALL REGIONS.  It also contains some extra material: an excerpt from the German version showing the ""epilogue"" title card in German, and a still gallery.

578547,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005ASOR,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","The Last Laugh is a stunning, unforgettable German expressionistic masterpiece by director F. W. Murnau. The cinematography is sophisticated and thoughtfully done for its time; the choreography is equally brilliant. The casting was very well done; Emil Jannings turns in a powerful performance as an elderly man who is essentially put out to pasture after a huge misunderstanding; the rest of the actors also act very convincingly. The musical score enhances the film.Equally important, The Last Laugh proves that intertitles were not necessary to tell a story in silent film. Indeed, F. W. Murnau only uses one intertitle near the end to make it clear to the viewer that the ending wasn't his choice; the studio insisted on a contrived happy ending that doesn't fit in with the rest of the story. They even had to change the name of the film from The Last Man to The Last Laugh!When the action begins, we meet the proud and aging doorman at The Hotel Atlantic played by Emil Jannings. The doorman is proud of his rather handsome uniform that connotes prestige and a degree of power. Unfortunately for the doorman, however, one rainy night he must carry an unusually heavy luggage trunk into the hotel; and he stops briefly to rest before going back to his duties. By a stroke of very bad luck the hotel manager (Hans Unterkircher) sees the doorman resting and simply assumes that the doorman is usually sitting down on the job. The following day the doorman must suffer the indignity of finding out that he has been replaced by seeing another younger handsome man performing his responsibilities as doorman! The manager decides that since the doorman has been employed by the hotel for so long he can stay--but only as a lowly washroom attendant with neither a special uniform nor prestige. The doorman makes one last desperate plea to get his job back by trying to lift another heavy trunk in the manager's office--only to stumble and fall, taken ill perhaps by a stroke which leaves him stooped over and unable to stand up straight.Of course, there is more to the plot. The doorman is so intensely honored by his job he actually skips his niece's (Maly Delschaft) wedding to his new son-in-law (Max Hiller). We also see how the doorman's emotional crisis plays out; suffice it to say that things only go from bad to worse when he is spotted in the hotel washroom and word gets out among his neighbors that he isn't the doorman! They even begin to wonder if he was *ever* the doorman.The DVD comes with some still photos among two or three other bonus features. Look also for some great acting by Emilie Kurz as the bridegroom's aunt and Georg John as the Night Watchman at The Hotel Atlantic.The Last Laugh wasn't F.W. Murnau's dream picture after the studio forced him to add on that unlikely ending; but nevertheless it remains quite a masterpiece especially if you keep in mind that the ending simply isn't supposed to be there. As I mentioned above, you can't miss the beginning of the improbable ending; the only title card in the film is at the very beginning of the ending sequence so you know where the filmmakers wanted to end the story with maybe just a very few more minutes.I highly recommend this film for people who appreciate German expressionism in film; fans of the actors and people who enjoy first-rate silent film with dark yet heartfelt themes.",5,The Last Laugh ~~ a brilliant example of German Expressionism in film,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,3368,"['Last', 'Laugh', 'stunning', 'unforgettable', 'German', 'expressionistic', 'masterpiece', 'director', 'F.', 'W.', 'Murnau', 'cinematography', 'sophisticated', 'thoughtfully', 'done', 'time', 'choreography', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'casting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'powerful', 'performance', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'essentially', 'put', 'out', 'pasture', 'huge', 'misunderstanding', 'rest', 'actors', 'also', 'act', 'very', 'convincingly', 'musical', 'score', 'film.Equally', 'important', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'intertitles', 'were', 'not', 'necessary', 'tell', 'story', 'silent', 'film', 'Indeed', 'F.', 'W.', 'Murnau', 'only', 'one', 'intertitle', 'end', 'make', 'clear', 'viewer', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'choice', 'studio', 'insisted', 'contrived', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'story', 'even', 'had', 'change', 'name', 'film', 'Last', 'Man', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'When', 'action', 'meet', 'proud', 'aging', 'doorman', 'Hotel', 'Atlantic', 'played', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'doorman', 'proud', 'rather', 'handsome', 'uniform', 'prestige', 'degree', 'power', 'Unfortunately', 'doorman', 'however', 'one', 'rainy', 'night', 'must', 'carry', 'unusually', 'heavy', 'luggage', 'trunk', 'hotel', 'briefly', 'rest', 'going', 'back', 'duties', 'stroke', 'very', 'bad', 'luck', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Hans', 'Unterkircher', 'doorman', 'resting', 'simply', 'doorman', 'usually', 'sitting', 'down', 'job', 'following', 'day', 'doorman', 'must', 'suffer', 'indignity', 'finding', 'out', 'been', 'replaced', 'seeing', 'younger', 'handsome', 'man', 'performing', 'responsibilities', 'doorman', 'manager', 'doorman', 'been', 'employed', 'hotel', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'stay', 'only', 'lowly', 'washroom', 'attendant', 'special', 'uniform', 'prestige', 'doorman', 'one', 'last', 'desperate', 'plea', 'get', 'job', 'back', 'trying', 'lift', 'heavy', 'trunk', 'manager', 'office', 'only', 'stumble', 'fall', 'taken', 'ill', 'perhaps', 'stroke', 'stooped', 'unable', 'stand', 'up', 'straight.Of', 'course', 'more', 'plot', 'doorman', 'so', 'intensely', 'honored', 'job', 'actually', 'niece', 'Maly', 'Delschaft', 'wedding', 'new', 'son-in-law', 'Max', 'Hiller', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'doorman', 'emotional', 'crisis', 'out', 'suffice', 'say', 'things', 'only', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'spotted', 'hotel', 'washroom', 'word', 'out', 'neighbors', ""n't"", 'doorman', 'even', 'begin', 'wonder', 'was', '*ever*', 'doorman.The', 'DVD', 'still', 'photos', 'two', 'three', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'Look', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'Emilie', 'Kurz', 'bridegroom', 'aunt', 'Georg', 'John', 'Night', 'Watchman', 'Hotel', 'Atlantic.The', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'was', ""n't"", 'F.W', 'Murnau', 'dream', 'picture', 'studio', 'forced', 'add', 'unlikely', 'ending', 'quite', 'masterpiece', 'especially', 'keep', 'mind', 'ending', 'simply', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'mentioned', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beginning', 'improbable', 'ending', 'only', 'title', 'card', 'film', 'very', 'beginning', 'ending', 'sequence', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'end', 'story', 'maybe', 'just', 'very', 'few', 'more', 'minutes.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'German', 'expressionism', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'first-rate', 'silent', 'film', 'dark', 'yet', 'heartfelt', 'themes']",N/A

This has prompted some to dub TLL 'the most silent of silents' ... and very true.  However, nothing extra is actually necessary.  Emil Jannings' expressive face shows all and the 'moving camera' manned by Karl Freund exquisitely reveals the story line.  A Murnau trademark evident in this film is his clever use of light and shadow.  Murnau manipulated lighting in such a way as to elevate it into an almost living, breathing entity.  He utilized this technique in FAUST, NOSFERATU and SUNRISE also to great effect.For the first part of the film we follow an aging hotel doorman as he plunges into the depths of despair. His entire reason for living has been snatched from him through a demotion.  He is forced to surrender his prized doorman's coat and his coveted post at the entryway of the fine hotel for a chair in a basement men's room.  He's a lowly washroom attendant and with every passing day becomes evermore despondent until death appears the only viable escape from his plight.  So well presented is this downfall that we mourn for the poor man and his palpable heartache.In the latter part of the film everything gets turned around.  Our doorman becomes wealthy, life is good again, and his enemies are served their just desserts.  I've been informed that this was done on purpose.  Murnau's happy ending was meant to poke fun at movies with happy endings (thus the title).  As the [sole] title card states, 'Here our story should end for if this were real life the old man would have nothing to look forward to but death. However the author took pity on him and provided a most improbable epilogue.'While I concur, might I also mention that sometimes miracles DO happen?  And certainly one did here, and to one most deserving.By the way.

Which is admittedly an odd thing to say about a film I'm rating as highly as I am, and a Murnau film at that, but allow me some leeway here. The first hour of this movie (released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>The Last Laugh&lt;/em>) is pure, solid-gold Murnau, so vastly depressing that one cannot truly enjoy it unless one has a finely-developed sense of &lt;em>Schadenfreude&lt;/em>. Emil Jannings plays a hotel doorman who lives for his job, but thanks to a misunderstanding is fired, after which his life spirals out of control. It's ugly and heartbreaking and beautifully-shot, and Emil Jannings may have never given a better performance. Had the movie ended with the depression, it would probably be one of the great works of film.But such was not to be. The studio was unimpressed, and demanded a happy ending, leading Murnau to create the final seventeen minutes of the film. His annoyance with the studio bleeds through; the entire extended scene is garish, overdone. It is entirely unlike the rest of the film, and it's pretty bad.

LAUGH brought him international fame and to Hollywood (where he made SUNRISE) and an early death by car accident.The film's plot hinges on a proud hotel doorman whose demotion to a toilet attendant destroys his life. It is enhanced by a great performance by Germany's reigning star Emil Jannings. But it is the energy and innovations that Murnau brings to his camera work--endless breathtaking movements in its hotel scenes, heartbreaking closeups,long evocative dolly shots, that bring the work alive as one of the crowning achievements of ""pure cinema""--its lack of title cards means the entire story is told with pictures. There is a bizarre ""happy ending"" tacked on (at the insistence of its producers) which points with irony to the absurdity of its premise.Film students should approach the film to learn everything they can about its techniques--if they really absorbed them, they would look forward to a lifetime of making good films.",5,The One That Lasts,1230595200,"12 30, 2008",2008,1307,"['LAST', 'LAUGH', 'had', 'tremendous', 'effect', 'film', 'making', 'film', 'makers', 'difficult', 'describe', 'using', 'word', 'important', 'Murnau', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'contribitors', 'expressionist', 'syle', 'heavy', 'shadows', 'accent', 'atmosphere', 'simple', 'expressive', 'composition', 'earlier', 'NOSFERATU', 'had', 'given', 'tremendous', 'clout', 'German', 'film', 'industry', 'LAUGH', 'brought', 'international', 'fame', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'made', 'SUNRISE', 'early', 'death', 'car', 'accident.The', 'film', 'plot', 'hinges', 'proud', 'hotel', 'doorman', 'demotion', 'toilet', 'attendant', 'life', 'enhanced', 'great', 'performance', 'Germany', 'reigning', 'star', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'energy', 'innovations', 'Murnau', 'camera', 'work', 'endless', 'breathtaking', 'movements', 'hotel', 'scenes', 'heartbreaking', 'closeups', 'long', 'evocative', 'dolly', 'shots', 'bring', 'work', 'alive', 'one', 'crowning', 'achievements', 'pure', 'cinema', 'lack', 'title', 'cards', 'entire', 'story', 'told', 'pictures', 'bizarre', 'happy', 'ending', 'tacked', 'insistence', 'producers', 'irony', 'absurdity', 'premise.Film', 'students', 'should', 'approach', 'film', 'learn', 'everything', 'can', 'techniques', 'really', 'absorbed', 'would', 'look', 'forward', 'lifetime', 'making', 'good', 'films']",N/A

It is also important to note that this film changed film-making throughout the world - a landmark of cinematography and story-telling. The camera is not always fixed. It often moves with characters or throughout sets. This is something we are accustomed to in our modern cinema but it was practically non-existent during early cinema.I love the drinking scene at the end of the wedding party. So many important examples here. A mirror is seen in the background of the scene. That is something that one would normally see in a home but on most camera sets mirrors are forbidden, removed or shot around. Here we see the reflection of the actor's backside while he drinks and revels. Moments later the camera and actor are placed on a turnstile and rotated so the room seems to spin. Anyone who drinks can all relate to that and it is a common method of camera placement in modern cinema. In the same scene the character dreams and in that dream the camera is literally walked behind the character jostling and bouncing just as one would imagine a character stumbling about.There are so many examples of the freedom that the camera, the film maker and the actor are given in this film.

An old hotel doorman, played by Emil Jannings, perhaps because of his age, is demoted from his prestigious job to that of washroom attendant.  It's a character study of one man's solitary journey through lonely despair.  If you can overcome the somewhat exaggerated acting style and the black-and-white silence - not even any inter-title cards in this one - it's a harrowing experience.  Jannings is a brilliant silent actor, and the ability to tell a complex story without words is revelatory.  It's obvious that by 1924 Murnau had the medium down cold.With miniatures and some impressive recreations, Murnau built a realistic set of city streets on the studio back lots.  He tells his story with a number of subtle camera techniques - long dollies in and out, spinning rooms, the famous opening shot on the descending glass elevator, distortion, and a camera that seemingly walks through a revolving door.  All of it's common enough now, but it makes of this one of the supplest of silent movies.  Murnau's camera is sinuous, and it pushed the art forward.At the insistence of the studio Murnau adds an `Improbable Epilogue.'  Thankfully he announces it with one of the few title cards in the movie.  The epilogue is so at variance with what precedes it that it's practically sardonic.  The real movie ends right before the epilogue.

Filmmakers of the German UFA studio developed their own distinctive style by using symbolism and milieu to add mood and deeper meaning to a movie.  This style came to be known as German Expressionism.""The Last Laugh""  is a 2-disc set showcasing F.W. Murnau's 1924 silent German Expressionist drama. The film stars Emil Jannings as an aging doorman whose happiness dissolves when he is relieved of the duties and uniform that have for years been the foundation of his identity and pride.  Through Jannings' impressive performance, ""The Last Laugh"" becomes more than the plight of a single doorman.  It is constantly referred to as one of the most poetic and sad dramatizations of the frustrations of the working class.  As a result of his work in ""The Last Laugh,"" Jannings became one of the world's most acclaimed film actors during the 1920's.In the making of the film, three different camera negatives were exposed and edited.  One would be used for striking prints for the German release, another for general international distribution, and the third for American release.  The surviving German negative was reconstructed utilizing material from several sources.  This Deluxe Edition contains the new restored version, the unrestored export version, a 40-minute making-of featurette, and a new stereo recording of the original score by Giuseppe Becce.

If you were to judge by appearances, this would seem to be one of Emil Jannings' ever-popular exercises in onscreen humiliation (The Blue Angel, The Last Command) - and no one did humiliation like Jannings, the man with the most expressive back and shoulders in cinema. A huge worldwide star in the silent era and the first Best Actor Oscar winner, his career and reputation subsequently marred by the Nazi films he made during the war, the film has survived its star's disgrace to become one of the enduring greats. Its story may be simple, but the execution is absolutely extraordinary, the film still seeming extraordinarily fresh and modern even today - a film with an energy and a beating heart that makes for an invigorating piece of pure cinema.Adapted from Nikolai Gogol's The Coat and a Broadway adaptation by Charles W. Goddard (the film's title actually translates from German as The Last Man, as in The Bible's `the last shall be first'), it taps into both the Germans' love of uniforms and the universal tendency to judge others by their appearance. Jannings plays the much-respected chief porter of the prestigious Hotel Atlantic. He may live in a neighbourhood not many steps above a slum, but as long as he has his grandiose military-style porter's uniform, he has the respect of everyone in his neighbourhood. It is the uniform, not money, that is the source of his power and authority, but when he is demoted after a humiliatingly pathetic display of physical strength shows his age, he is stripped of the overcoat like a disgraced officer being cashiered before the entire regiment and sent to work as a lavatory attendant instead, the lowliest position in the entire hotel. At first he attempts to hide his dishonour, but once his secret is out his neighbours' attitudes change almost immediately from love and admiration to contempt as he becomes a joke in their eyes. The only compassion he receives is from the night watchman in a moving drunken scene that you suspect everyone but Jannings wanted for the finale.Yet far from this being a case of just deserts, Jannings' protagonist is a decent man for all his surface pomposity. All he has is the respect his position bestows on him, and once that is gone it is genuinely tragic to see this huge man shrink into himself. It's that human aspect that ultimately is the film's greatest achievement: it's as emotional and moving as it is technically innovative. And the film is incredibly innovative.An attempt to make a silent film with no captions, the film tells its story with images and body language, with only a shot of a letter and a very reluctant onscreen excuse for the unbelievable epilogue imposed on him by his star breaking the flow of images (Murnau passed on the opportunity to direct The Blue Angel, fearing that Jannings would once again demand a happy ending: Jannings even suggested his Last Laugh co-star Molly Delschart for the Dietrich role!). Boasting the top talent in German cinema of the day (a screenplay by The Cabinet of Dr Caligari's Carl Mayer, produced by Eric Pohmer, magnificent production design by future cult director Edgar G. Ulmer), a huge 1.6m DM budget that allowed magnificent sets of the grand hotel and the beautifully rendered slum, and a lavish 180-day shooting schedule that allowed director F.W. Murnau a level of perfectionism rare even now let alone in 1924, the film is the best and most groundbreaking example of what became known as the `unchained camera' technique. And the camerawork is very much a star of the film. Few directors, sound or silent, understood the language of the camera as well as Murnau: Scorsese's been openly stealing from him for decades. You could even make a case that all modern cinema flows from this source, with many of the techniques we take for granted today being tried out here. The camera is rarely still in many of the major sequences, the hotel lobby filled with crane and dolly shots (the later reputedly invented for the film), Karl Freund's striking camerawork at times even assuming the perspective and failing eyesight of its tragic hero.Thankfully the film has received some of the attention it deserves in Kino's two-disc set, with a fine transfer keeping the excellent 1924 score by Giuseppe Becce, the DVD also includes the export version (studios would shoot versions with alternate takes for export so they could have two negatives, one for domestic and one for overseas), an excellent documentary detailing the differences between the different versions (three were shot, one for Germany, the others for export overseas, with many subsequent re-edits happening to both), how the forced perspective sets were designed via production sketches and blueprints and even breakdowns on individual shots. The DVD even tells you what film stock and cameras were used! Very highly recommended.",5,"""Take away a man's uniform - what is left?""",1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,4886,"['Appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceptive', 'were', 'judge', 'appearances', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'Emil', 'Jannings', 'ever-popular', 'exercises', 'onscreen', 'humiliation', 'Blue', 'Angel', 'Last', 'Command', 'one', 'did', 'humiliation', 'Jannings', 'man', 'most', 'expressive', 'back', 'shoulders', 'cinema', 'huge', 'worldwide', 'star', 'silent', 'era', 'first', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'career', 'reputation', 'subsequently', 'marred', 'Nazi', 'films', 'made', 'war', 'film', 'survived', 'star', 'disgrace', 'become', 'one', 'enduring', 'greats', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'simple', 'execution', 'absolutely', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'still', 'seeming', 'extraordinarily', 'fresh', 'modern', 'even', 'today', 'film', 'energy', 'beating', 'heart', 'invigorating', 'piece', 'pure', 'cinema.Adapted', 'Nikolai', 'Gogol', 'Coat', 'Broadway', 'adaptation', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Goddard', 'film', 'title', 'actually', 'German', 'Last', 'Man', 'Bible', 'last', 'shall', 'be', 'first', 'Germans', 'love', 'uniforms', 'universal', 'tendency', 'judge', 'others', 'appearance', 'Jannings', 'much-respected', 'chief', 'porter', 'prestigious', 'Hotel', 'Atlantic', 'may', 'live', 'neighbourhood', 'not', 'many', 'steps', 'slum', 'as', 'long', 'grandiose', 'military-style', 'porter', 'uniform', 'respect', 'everyone', 'neighbourhood', 'uniform', 'not', 'money', 'source', 'power', 'authority', 'when', 'demoted', 'humiliatingly', 'pathetic', 'display', 'physical', 'strength', 'age', 'stripped', 'overcoat', 'disgraced', 'officer', 'being', 'cashiered', 'entire', 'regiment', 'sent', 'work', 'lavatory', 'attendant', 'instead', 'lowliest', 'position', 'entire', 'hotel', 'first', 'hide', 'dishonour', 'once', 'secret', 'out', 'neighbours', 'attitudes', 'change', 'almost', 'immediately', 'love', 'admiration', 'contempt', 'joke', 'eyes', 'only', 'compassion', 'night', 'watchman', 'moving', 'drunken', 'scene', 'suspect', 'everyone', 'Jannings', 'wanted', 'finale.Yet', 'far', 'being', 'case', 'just', 'deserts', 'Jannings', 'protagonist', 'decent', 'man', 'surface', 'pomposity', 'respect', 'position', 'bestows', 'once', 'gone', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'see', 'huge', 'man', 'shrink', 'human', 'aspect', 'ultimately', 'film', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'emotional', 'moving', 'technically', 'innovative', 'film', 'incredibly', 'innovative.An', 'attempt', 'make', 'silent', 'film', 'captions', 'film', 'story', 'images', 'body', 'language', 'only', 'shot', 'letter', 'very', 'reluctant', 'onscreen', 'excuse', 'unbelievable', 'epilogue', 'imposed', 'star', 'breaking', 'flow', 'images', 'Murnau', 'passed', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'Blue', 'Angel', 'fearing', 'Jannings', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'demand', 'happy', 'ending', 'Jannings', 'even', 'suggested', 'Last', 'Laugh', 'co-star', 'Molly', 'Delschart', 'Dietrich', 'role', 'Boasting', 'top', 'talent', 'German', 'cinema', 'day', 'screenplay', 'Cabinet', 'Dr', 'Caligari', 'Carl', 'Mayer', 'produced', 'Eric', 'Pohmer', 'magnificent', 'production', 'design', 'future', 'cult', 'director', 'Edgar', 'G.', 'Ulmer', 'huge', '1.6m', 'DM', 'budget', 'allowed', 'magnificent', 'sets', 'grand', 'hotel', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'slum', 'lavish', '180-day', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'allowed', 'director', 'F.W', 'Murnau', 'level', 'perfectionism', 'rare', 'even', 'now', 'let', 'alone', '1924', 'film', 'best', 'most', 'groundbreaking', 'example', 'what', 'became', 'known', 'unchained', 'camera', 'technique', 'camerawork', 'very', 'much', 'star', 'film', 'Few', 'directors', 'sound', 'silent', 'understood', 'language', 'camera', 'as', 'well', 'Murnau', 'Scorsese', 'been', 'openly', 'stealing', 'decades', 'could', 'even', 'make', 'case', 'modern', 'cinema', 'source', 'many', 'techniques', 'take', 'granted', 'today', 'being', 'tried', 'here', 'camera', 'rarely', 'still', 'many', 'major', 'sequences', 'hotel', 'lobby', 'filled', 'crane', 'dolly', 'shots', 'later', 'reputedly', 'invented', 'film', 'Karl', 'Freund', 'striking', 'camerawork', 'times', 'even', 'assuming', 'perspective', 'failing', 'eyesight', 'tragic', 'hero.Thankfully', 'film', 'received', 'attention', 'Kino', 'two-disc', 'set', 'fine', 'transfer', 'keeping', 'excellent', '1924', 'score', 'Giuseppe', 'Becce', 'DVD', 'also', 'export', 'version', 'studios', 'would', 'shoot', 'versions', 'alternate', 'export', 'could', 'have', 'two', 'negatives', 'one', 'domestic', 'one', 'overseas', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'detailing', 'differences', 'different', 'versions', 'three', 'were', 'shot', 'one', 'Germany', 'others', 'export', 'overseas', 'many', 'subsequent', 're-edits', 'happening', 'how', 'forced', 'perspective', 'sets', 'were', 'designed', 'production', 'sketches', 'blueprints', 'even', 'breakdowns', 'individual', 'shots', 'DVD', 'even', 'what', 'film', 'stock', 'cameras', 'were', 'used', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

578562,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B00005ASOR,William Krischke,"[1, 1]","I think I'm getting the hang of German Expressionism.  It's about watching souls, not people on the screen.  The extreme acting is not maudlin, it's naked: this is what the character is feeling, even if what they would actually be doing in this situation is completely different.And it's about mood, aura; shadows, dreams, nightmares, fears and anxieties.  It's not a very cheerful genre of film, that's for sure.The plot of the film is simple, and rings of Dostoyevsky:  The day before his daughter's wedding, an aging doorman at a hotel is stripped of his prestigious position and demoted to lowly bathroom attendant.  In essence, he is stripped of his pride, and his identity.  The rest of the movie shows him trying to deal, mostly unsuccessfully, with this change.  It is not a happy or optimistic portrait - until the unbelievable, tacked on happy ending, which even the director pauses to disclaim.This is simple everyman tragedy, and that's probably why it works.  It's universal.  Also, maybe it works better because the main character, as played by Emil Jannings, is such a mountain of a man that he requires a certain amount of respect, broadcasts, even in his weakest moments, a sense of dignity.  The buffoon Harker in Nosferatu  completely lacks anything of this quality, and when he laughs at an account of vampires in a book he finds at an inn, you feel like you're being set up for comedy.  Even the vampire himself, in his maudlin menace, is easier to laugh at than take seriously.  He looks like someone who's trying to be menacing.  And that's nothing but comedy.Jannings, on the other hand, does not seem at all comedic.  So while there are no shortage of overacted scenes, as when he freezes, wide-eyed, upon being demoted, and the attendants strip him of his precious doorman's coat, something still rings true.What I feel is that, even if no one would really act like this, this is how the soul feels nonetheless.And then there is that title card at the end.  Our man has been so stripped of identity and respect that he cannot bear to stay at home, so he goes back to the hotel and takes up his position inside the darkened bathroom.  The night watchman pities him and gives him his coat; the camera pans out and he looks as if he is simply waiting for death to take him.  And then, the lone titlecard:""Here our story should really end, for in real life the forlorn old man would have little to look forward to but death.The author took pity on him, however, and quit an improbably epilogue.""And the rest is crap, and the director knows it.  But I have to give him props for admitting it.  Tacked on, improbably endings have become a staple of Hollywood: often producers demand a happy ending because it will make more money, even if a worse movie.  But this is the only time, as far as I know, that a movie lets us know that's what's happening.Directed by FW Murnau (who also directed Nosferatu) and shot by Karl Freund, the film is celebrated for several technical achievements.  As always, I find that some technical achievements really do make a better movie and are worth noting, and that others are little more than historical footnotes.On the ""better movie"" end:  There are no title cards, until the disclaimer near the end.  This is the kind of creative restraint that makes a director tell a better story: everything is shown, not told to us.On the ""historical footnote"" end:  The camera moves.  This was fairly novel at the time, and perhaps audiences took note of it then.  Of course, these days, cameras do much more than move, so I hardly noticed.  Apparently there is a ""famous"" shot in which a camera passes through a window.
