1020754,AY7EXIYJ2LG5S,B000IJ6VAQ,ADSHippin,"[7, 11]","First let me say that I mean with this review no disrespect towards all the fine men and women who live and work at Van Nuys Airport in California. Nor am I trying to disparage or take anything away from it's place in aviation history. However there are times in this movie that you would almost think that aviation all started from this airport.  True it includes some strong arguments for keeping small airports open, and it  does a touch upon the tragedy of Meigs Field in Chicago, which was bulldozed by the Mayor into non existence.In the arguments for protecting general aviation airports, and the history of aviation. I would like to have to have seen a little more coverage of some of the other equally famous airports. Such airports as College Park (the oldest continuously operated airport in the world) in Maryland.  College Park is threatened by the Federal Government because it's so close to Washington Dc. Then there are the airports in Ohio, which with North Carolina share the honors as being the birth place of American Aviation.  What about the now gone and continually threatened General Aviation Airports on Long Island in New York?  Many of those airports where the start of aviation firsts which ended in California.  While just as many started in the west and then ended in the east.  Lt. John M Conroy, who in an F86 was the first man to fly from the west coast to the east coast and back on the same day is a glaring example of this.  Yes they mention the flight, but WHICH AIRPORT did he land at?  How about a word or two about the huge EAA show in Oshkosh Wisconsin?  At this annual event there is upwards of 12,000 aircraft of ALL TYPES present at the same time.  Yes I said TWELVE THOUSAND AIRCRAFT!The truth is there are hundreds of airports scattered across the United States that have histories just as notable as Van Nuys. Yes I can appreciate the need to keep the movie to under 90 min; just as I can also appreciate the understandable bias towards this airport (after all it's a movie about this airport).  But a minor mention of some of these other famous airports by name, a brief description of their contributions, as well as some of the unique threats they face would have made it into a far more interesting and well rounded movie.  Especialy given the amount of time spent discusing General Aviation as a subject.Having damned the movie for those points I will give the movie top marks for the aerial cinematography, and the flying sequences which are truly breathtaking.  Even then I would have loved to have seen a little more of the spectacular Southern California Landscape, preferably with a lovely airplane in the middle of the scene.  The funny thing is that in the ""Special Features"" section of the video there is a sequence titled ""Flight"" that lasts for several minutes which is nothing but flying, and this is what there should have been more of in the main production.  The beauty we see in this sequence truly does capture the magic of flight.In the end I am glad I purchased this movie because of my own passion for aviation.  Despite my criticisms it really isn't a bad movie.  My reason for giving it three stars was because of the over emphasis upon Van Nuys Airport within the broad subject of general aviation.I am adding this comment several days after watching the movie. An excellent companion to the movie is ""One Six Left"".  Which features even more breathtaking aerial footage.  As well as some very interesting interviews with the creators of ""One Six Right"".",3,"Not bad, but a very slanted view point...",1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,3528,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'mean', 'review', 'disrespect', 'towards', 'fine', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'work', 'Van', 'Nuys', 'Airport', 'California', 'am', 'trying', 'disparage', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'place', 'aviation', 'history', 'However', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'would', 'almost', 'think', 'aviation', 'started', 'airport', 'True', 'strong', 'arguments', 'keeping', 'small', 'airports', 'open', 'touch', 'tragedy', 'Meigs', 'Field', 'Chicago', 'was', 'bulldozed', 'Mayor', 'non', 'existence.In', 'arguments', 'protecting', 'general', 'aviation', 'airports', 'history', 'aviation', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'coverage', 'other', 'equally', 'famous', 'airports', 'Such', 'airports', 'College', 'Park', 'oldest', 'continuously', 'operated', 'airport', 'world', 'Maryland', 'College', 'Park', 'threatened', 'Federal', 'Government', 'so', 'close', 'Washington', 'Dc', 'Then', 'are', 'airports', 'Ohio', 'North', 'Carolina', 'share', 'honors', 'being', 'birth', 'place', 'American', 'Aviation', 'What', 'now', 'gone', 'continually', 'threatened', 'General', 'Aviation', 'Airports', 'Long', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'Many', 'airports', 'where', 'start', 'aviation', 'firsts', 'ended', 'California', 'just', 'many', 'started', 'west', 'then', 'ended', 'east', 'Lt.', 'John', 'M', 'Conroy', 'who', 'F86', 'was', 'first', 'man', 'fly', 'west', 'coast', 'east', 'coast', 'back', 'same', 'day', 'glaring', 'example', 'Yes', 'mention', 'flight', 'WHICH', 'AIRPORT', 'did', 'land', 'How', 'word', 'two', 'huge', 'EAA', 'show', 'Oshkosh', 'Wisconsin', 'annual', 'event', 'upwards', '12,000', 'aircraft', 'ALL', 'TYPES', 'present', 'same', 'time', 'Yes', 'said', 'TWELVE', 'THOUSAND', 'AIRCRAFT', 'truth', 'are', 'hundreds', 'airports', 'scattered', 'United', 'States', 'have', 'histories', 'just', 'as', 'notable', 'Van', 'Nuys', 'Yes', 'can', 'appreciate', 'need', 'keep', 'movie', '90', 'min', 'just', 'can', 'also', 'appreciate', 'understandable', 'bias', 'airport', 'movie', 'airport', 'minor', 'mention', 'other', 'famous', 'airports', 'name', 'brief', 'description', 'contributions', 'as', 'well', 'unique', 'threats', 'face', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'well', 'rounded', 'movie', 'Especialy', 'given', 'amount', 'time', 'spent', 'discusing', 'General', 'Aviation', 'subject.Having', 'damned', 'movie', 'points', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'top', 'marks', 'aerial', 'cinematography', 'flying', 'sequences', 'are', 'truly', 'breathtaking', 'Even', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'little', 'more', 'spectacular', 'Southern', 'California', 'Landscape', 'preferably', 'lovely', 'airplane', 'middle', 'scene', 'funny', 'thing', 'Special', 'Features', 'section', 'video', 'sequence', 'titled', 'Flight', 'several', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'flying', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'main', 'production', 'beauty', 'see', 'sequence', 'truly', 'capture', 'magic', 'flight.In', 'end', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'movie', 'own', 'passion', 'aviation', 'criticisms', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'reason', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'was', 'over', 'emphasis', 'Van', 'Nuys', 'Airport', 'broad', 'subject', 'general', 'aviation.I', 'am', 'adding', 'comment', 'several', 'days', 'watching', 'movie', 'excellent', 'companion', 'movie', 'One', 'Six', 'Left', 'Which', 'even', 'more', 'breathtaking', 'aerial', 'footage', 'As', 'well', 'very', 'interesting', 'interviews', 'creators', 'One', 'Six', 'Right']",One Six Right

Well run and well equipped facilities which support non-commercial flying. Meigs Field, Chicago is also featured to a lesser degree to show what can happen to an outstanding airfield, when power politics gets in the way.Meigs was on the shore of Lake Michigan with the city as a backdrop. Unfortunately, the current Mayor Daley wanted to turn it into a park and name it after his wife. Preposterous? You don't know Chicago.Usually, when one closes an airport an X is painted on each end of the runway to show the airport is closed. Mayor Daley used bulldozers to make his X's and through sheer political power closed one of this country's most unique and interesting airports. A true gem.It is a nostalgic presentation with haunting music and lovely photography, interesting comments from various pioneers and stalwarts of aviation and over and over, the planes.
