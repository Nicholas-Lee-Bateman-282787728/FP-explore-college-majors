918310,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000A0GYMS,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[7, 7]","I have ridden many miles on the BMT, IRT and the IND and wondered idly how these underground networks had come to be.  The system is now over a century old, a bit gritty and shopworn, but still carrying passengers in relative safety.  It was a seemingly impossible job to dig all those tunnels, to disrupt ground transportation for years, but it had to be done if New York City were to function and grow.  The city after the Civil War was confined on the southern third of Manhattan Island.  It was crowded with traffic to the point of strangulation.  Expansion was impossible.  It was absolutely necessary that travel go underground where it would be unaffected by automobiles and weather.  The blizzard of 1888 made that obvious, if the summer glut was not enough.Building the subway was as big a project as the Great Wall of China or the Pyramid of Cheops.  This, then, is the story of the visionaries who took on the project and of the men who perished to make it happen.",5,A monumental accomplishment,1320105600,"11 1, 2011",2011,975,"['have', 'ridden', 'many', 'miles', 'BMT', 'IRT', 'IND', 'wondered', 'idly', 'how', 'underground', 'networks', 'had', 'come', 'be', 'system', 'now', 'century', 'old', 'bit', 'gritty', 'shopworn', 'still', 'carrying', 'passengers', 'relative', 'safety', 'was', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'job', 'dig', 'tunnels', 'disrupt', 'ground', 'transportation', 'years', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'were', 'function', 'grow', 'city', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'confined', 'southern', 'third', 'Manhattan', 'Island', 'was', 'crowded', 'traffic', 'point', 'strangulation', 'Expansion', 'was', 'impossible', 'was', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'travel', 'go', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'unaffected', 'automobiles', 'weather', 'blizzard', '1888', 'made', 'obvious', 'summer', 'glut', 'was', 'not', 'enough.Building', 'subway', 'was', 'big', 'project', 'Great', 'Wall', 'China', 'Pyramid', 'Cheops', 'then', 'story', 'visionaries', 'who', 'took', 'project', 'men', 'who', 'perished', 'make', 'happen']",American Experience: New York Underground
918311,A36RM2S7UD5K2R,B000A0GYMS,"R. Whitney ""Ross Whitney""","[0, 3]","This documentary often relies on very unpleasant devices apparently in order to make otherwise uninteresting material interesting. Picture this, if you can: a formal, nineteenth-century studio portrait of one of the subway engineers superimposed over motion pictures of the inside of a subway under construction. That is to say, both are visible over an extended period at the same time, so that you're either trying to view the subway movie through the face of the engineer, or trying to view the face of the engineer through the movie. Confusion and irritation, rather than engagement, is the effect produced. Over this is superimposed narration about the development of the subway, and over THAT is superimposed ragtime piano music--the jarring rhythms of which fight the rhythms of the spoken narration. After a half hour, I couldn't watch or listen to any more.Although much detailed information from contemporary sources (newspapers, especially) is conveyed, the production seems amateurish. I'm surprised that American Experience, which has released such masterful documentaries, released any documentary produced to such standards.",1,An irritating production,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,1139,"['documentary', 'often', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'devices', 'apparently', 'order', 'make', 'otherwise', 'uninteresting', 'material', 'interesting', 'Picture', 'can', 'formal', 'nineteenth-century', 'studio', 'portrait', 'one', 'subway', 'engineers', 'superimposed', 'motion', 'pictures', 'inside', 'subway', 'construction', 'say', 'are', 'visible', 'extended', 'period', 'same', 'time', ""'re"", 'trying', 'view', 'subway', 'movie', 'face', 'engineer', 'trying', 'view', 'face', 'engineer', 'movie', 'Confusion', 'irritation', 'rather', 'engagement', 'effect', 'produced', 'superimposed', 'narration', 'development', 'subway', 'superimposed', 'ragtime', 'piano', 'music', 'jarring', 'rhythms', 'fight', 'rhythms', 'spoken', 'narration', 'half', 'hour', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'listen', 'more.Although', 'much', 'detailed', 'information', 'contemporary', 'sources', 'newspapers', 'especially', 'conveyed', 'production', 'amateurish', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'American', 'Experience', 'released', 'such', 'masterful', 'documentaries', 'released', 'documentary', 'produced', 'such', 'standards']",American Experience: New York Underground
918312,A37KG9AQK1PN10,B000A0GYMS,William B. Dwinnell IV,"[0, 0]","""New York Underground"" is a documentary which covers the development of the New York subway system, from its origins through the construction of the IRT.Presentation in this film is polished, and provides historic footage and imagery and expert discussion. The movie's one hour length was just about right. I found the pace just a tad slow, but not enough to give less than 5 stars. This documentary provides needed context, explaining the pressing need for improved transportation in New York in the early 1800s, and the dramatic effect the subway had on the city once it was installed. The two main subways covered are Beech's pneumatic subway and the IRT (later developments are encapsulated in relatively brief comments toward the end of the movie). One minor complaint: subways in other cities (Boston, London, etc.) were mentioned in passing, but it would have been interesting to get even a little more information on subways which preceded those in New York.",5,Good Presentation of Early NY Subway History,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,966,"['New', 'York', 'Underground', 'documentary', 'development', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'system', 'origins', 'construction', 'IRT.Presentation', 'film', 'polished', 'historic', 'footage', 'imagery', 'expert', 'discussion', 'movie', 'one', 'hour', 'length', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'found', 'pace', 'just', 'tad', 'slow', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'documentary', 'needed', 'context', 'explaining', 'pressing', 'need', 'improved', 'transportation', 'New', 'York', 'early', '1800s', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'subway', 'had', 'city', 'was', 'installed', 'two', 'main', 'subways', 'covered', 'are', 'Beech', 'pneumatic', 'subway', 'IRT', 'later', 'developments', 'are', 'encapsulated', 'relatively', 'brief', 'comments', 'end', 'movie', 'One', 'minor', 'complaint', 'subways', 'other', 'cities', 'Boston', 'London', 'etc', 'were', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'get', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'subways', 'preceded', 'New', 'York']",American Experience: New York Underground
