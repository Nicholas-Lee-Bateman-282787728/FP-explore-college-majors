It tells a story that might well have been the story behind the story of &quot;Cinderella.&quot;Drew Barrymore is  outstanding as Danielle, the movie's lead character.  She is reduced to  peasant's status after her loving and nurturing father dies.  As time  passes, her vain and conniving step-mother goes to extreme lengths to get  one of her daughters noticed by the crown prince of France.  Danielle, in  the meantime, impersonates a courtier in order to save the life of a fellow  peasant and life-long friend, and she gets noticed herself!

456844,A2BHSD9A7ISMAW,6305265488,Amanda,"[1, 1]","At first when I saw they were making this movie I was intrigued, but also skeptical, about this new twist on Perrault's Cinderella, this time starring Drew Barrymore.  Well, Cinderella is my second favourite fairy tale, so I should probably force myself to sit through it for that reason alone.  Barrymore's also not that bad of an actress, not the best, but hey not the worst. Then I notice Anjelica Huston is in it also, and hey I really like her so why not go and see it?Well eventually I completely forgot about the movie, never did get around to seeing it in theatres.  Then while surfing through the channels on my TV I see a commercial for the movie being shown on some station and I'm intrigued all over again.  So I tune in to see the movie, and wow, I was not expecting this movie to be as great as it was.This is not Disney's version of Cinderella, not by a long shot, so if that's what you're looking for in your tale of Cinderella I suggest you search elsewhere.  Instead of the pixie dust and fairy tails you get the legend of Cinderella, the supposedly true story which the fairy tales were later based off of.  The movie opens with the brothers Grimm arriving at a castle in France invited there by an again woman who wishes to tell them the true story of Cinderella without the magical pumpkins or a faery godmother.  I'll spare you all the details of the film which every other reviewer has already gone through.  I will however tell you that the performance is average from Drew Barrymore, no fireworks with her acting here, just the way she usually is, which isn't that bad but she's not going to be winning an Oscar anytime soon I promise you that.  Anjelica Huston was amazing and easily stole the movie away from Barrymore, she was simply delicious as an Evil Stepmother, the role fit her like a glove.  Perhaps my favourite role in the film was of Pierre le Pieu played by Richard O'Brien more widely known as Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I nearly fell off of my seat the first time I saw this movie and he first appeared!You'll not be disappointed at all by this movie if you decide to take the time to sit and watch this movie.  It is however a ""chick-flick"" if you haven't already noticed so considered yourself warned.

It's basically a retelling of the Cinderella story. It is set in the time period and told as a flashback by a supposed descendant of the main character, but it is one of those period pieces that has modern sensibilities written in. I'm not sure how historically accurate everything is, but does that really matter in a fairy tale? The actors were very likable and there was a lot of charisma between the main characters.

A must for anyone who enjoys romantic dramedies or pretty period pieces.  This is both.The overall theme of this movie is sweetness and idealism.  It's got it's share of villains, but the real challenge for Danielle is class conflict - this is a true 90's Cinderella.  To their credit, the issues aren't done heavy-handedly.  Things fit together with the plot and characters, and if you can succeed in ignoring all the philo-babble, this is a great movie to relax with - after all, you know how it ends.The disparate accents of the multi-national cast (American, Scottish, French, Dutch, British) grate a little, but eventually, this gets lost in the lovely French scenery and particularly expressive faces of actors Barrymore, Dougray Scott, and Anjelica Huston.  While the characters have been a bit updated and fleshed out, they hold few surprises.  Danielle/Cinderella is a free-spirited (but chaste) go-getter with heart and her Prince is pretty dull until he meets her.  They discuss philosophy, education, and social responsibility.  Um, this isn't your grandma's Cinderella.Some changes: The stepsisters figure more prominently in the plot and they're both scene stealers (notice how opposite the sisters are in every way).

I decided that it was about time to wipe off the dust and pop in the movie and I am so glad that I did for I had forgotten how much I truly adore this movie.  I mean, I remember that I was impressed when I saw it initially not knowing what to expect really but I think that over time my taste now allows me to completely fall in love with this movie.  Taking the classic story of Cinderella and making it realistic was an endeavor in itself but Andy Tennant and his cast truly deliver brilliantly here.So, in this fresh undertaking we are introduced to Danielle De Barbarac, a young woman who finds herself in a dire situation.  Young Danielle's father has suddenly died and she is now at the mercy of the most merciless of women, her stepmother The Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent and her ghoulish daughter Marguerite (The Baroness' other daughter Jacqueline is actually a kindhearted soul).  The Baroness has turned her father's house into a house of fear and treachery and she is constantly butting heads with Danielle.  Their feud seems to reach its peek about the time that rebellious Prince Henry begins his search for a bride.  A misunderstanding causes the Prince to fall head over heals in love with Danielle and as they secretly court her `big secret' is in danger of being revealed.The direction is wonderful here, the cinematography is beautiful and the whole mood expressed in the film is just warm and delightful.  The actors all do a wonderful job in their respective roles, Drew Barrymore deliver such a well rounded and heart warming performance that I'm astounded at her Oscar snub (especially in a year where Gwyneth Paltrow was embraced for doing the same thing).  Anjelica Huston is the epitome of evil as The Baroness, you can tell she is just eating this up.  Patrick Godfrey is hilarious as Leonardo da Vinci and Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey both are astounding as the two polar opposite stepsisters.  Dougray Scott was having such an awesome year (or few years) so it's odd that his career as fizzled as opposed to sizzled.  He is charming and believable as the arrogant rebel Prince who finds his way through the love of a woman.The film is just an utter delight from start to finish and is sure to please just about everyone.  A wonderful film the whole family can enjoy again and again.  I've always been smitten with Drew Barrymore, but I think I can honestly say that she has never moved me more nor has ever been so close to my heart as she is as Cinderella.",5,A delightful treat for the whole family...,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2610,"['was', 'scanning', 'DVD', 'library', 'other', 'night', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'time', 'Ever', 'decided', 'was', 'about', 'time', 'wipe', 'off', 'dust', 'pop', 'movie', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'had', 'forgotten', 'how', 'much', 'truly', 'movie', 'mean', 'remember', 'was', 'impressed', 'when', 'saw', 'initially', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'really', 'think', 'time', 'taste', 'now', 'completely', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'Taking', 'classic', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'making', 'realistic', 'was', 'endeavor', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'cast', 'truly', 'deliver', 'brilliantly', 'here.So', 'fresh', 'undertaking', 'are', 'introduced', 'Danielle', 'De', 'Barbarac', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'dire', 'situation', 'Young', 'Danielle', 'father', 'suddenly', 'died', 'now', 'mercy', 'most', 'merciless', 'women', 'Baroness', 'Rodmilla', 'De', 'Ghent', 'ghoulish', 'daughter', 'Marguerite', 'Baroness', 'other', 'daughter', 'Jacqueline', 'actually', 'kindhearted', 'soul', 'Baroness', 'turned', 'father', 'house', 'house', 'fear', 'treachery', 'constantly', 'butting', 'heads', 'Danielle', 'feud', 'reach', 'peek', 'time', 'rebellious', 'Prince', 'Henry', 'search', 'bride', 'misunderstanding', 'Prince', 'fall', 'head', 'heals', 'love', 'Danielle', 'secretly', 'court', 'big', 'secret', 'danger', 'being', 'revealed.The', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'here', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'whole', 'mood', 'expressed', 'film', 'just', 'warm', 'delightful', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'respective', 'roles', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'deliver', 'well', 'rounded', 'heart', 'warming', 'performance', ""'m"", 'astounded', 'Oscar', 'snub', 'especially', 'year', 'where', 'Gwyneth', 'Paltrow', 'was', 'embraced', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'epitome', 'evil', 'Baroness', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'eating', 'up', 'Patrick', 'Godfrey', 'hilarious', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'are', 'astounding', 'two', 'polar', 'opposite', 'stepsisters', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'was', 'having', 'such', 'awesome', 'year', 'few', 'years', 'odd', 'career', 'as', 'fizzled', 'opposed', 'sizzled', 'charming', 'believable', 'arrogant', 'rebel', 'Prince', 'who', 'way', 'love', 'woman.The', 'film', 'just', 'utter', 'delight', 'start', 'finish', 'sure', 'please', 'just', 'everyone', 'wonderful', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'again', 'again', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'smitten', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'think', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'never', 'moved', 'more', 'ever', 'been', 'so', 'close', 'heart', 'Cinderella']",N/A

He was actually the one (instead of Henry) to open the Coll&egrave;ge de France in 1530 where ""attendance is free and open to anyone"", and boasts one of  ""the best research libraries of Europe"".He also sent expeditions to the America's, one headed by Jacques Cartier (who supposedly bought servant ""Maurice"").His son Henry II, didn't marry a commoner as in the movie, but did have several mistresses.  One named Nicole de Savigny (who bore him an illegitimate son: Henri de Saint-R&eacute;my).  The other Diane de Poitiers (almost 20 years older), was said to be his ""lifelong companion"", and for 25 years she was the ""most powerful influence in his life and the most powerful woman in France"".  She was also ""immortalized in sculpture and paintings"" (2 .  ""And possessed a sharp intellect and was so politically astute that King Henry II trusted her to write many of his official letters, and even to sign them jointly with the one name HenriDiane.  Her confident maturity and loyalty to Henry II made her his most dependable ally in the court.""  They however never had any children together, so the great-granddaughter/narrator ""Grande Dame Marie Th&eacute;r&egrave;se of France"" actually was Queen Catherine de' Medici's many times distant future g-granddaughter.Finally, the portrait (wedding present) ""Head of a Woman"" by da Vinci, looks a lot like Drew/""Danielle"". **",5,"""Happily Ever After""..

It's not that she can't act or doesn't look the part; it's her private life, the lurid details of which are now public knowledge (e.g., in rehab by age 13!).That being the case, it's virtually impossible to take her seriously as an innocent princess.

I fell in love with this movie since it first came out years ago and I still watch it over and over to this day.Okay, so it's not BBC masterpiece theatre and the accents are iffy. However all the actors are wonderfully cast - Angelica Huston is superbly conniving and manipulative as the stepmother but Dougray Scott and Judy Parfitt standout as the prince and queen mother respectively. The dialogue and storyline is both funny AND smart.Drew Barrymore is quite the revelation in this film. Yes, her character Danielle is kind, intelligent and strong but it's the scenes where she's vulnerable that stands out in my mind.  In the scene where she brushes her stepmother's hair, watch Drew's big luminous eyes shine with hopeful longing for a mother's approval and love. And later in the film when the Baroness coldly rejects her as a ""pebble in a shoe"", the stricken expression on Drew's face just breaks your heart.Ok, now to my complaint about this dvd.

456877,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6305265488,Char,"[2, 2]","The real and true story of Cinderella (and the Prince), the details of which were lost over time.  That is what this story purports to tell, narrated by a regent who is the great, great granddaughter of Cinderella!This is a really, really GOOD, WONDERFUL movie!  Even though I'm seeing it almost 14 years now since it first came out, I'm so glad I happened to take a look at it and didn't miss it!As story, it is an innovative, in-depth account of the classic fairy-tale/myth that has captured the minds and psyches of females down through the centuries.  This version of the story explores, however, new depths in the minds and characterological make-ups of Cinderella (Her name is Danielle) and the Prince of France who doesn't want to become King (His name is Henry).Because this story of the young couple's alternating topsy-turvey and turvey-topsey acquaintanceship before marriage involves character growth in the Prince, who gains new human values that replace his previously self-centered, selfish ways, the story is very wholesome and worthwhile.  Although it is still an absorbing Romance, it provides an experience that greatly supercedes the story as mere Romance.  Through the strong and instructive character of the servant Cinderella/Danielle, values such as human kindness and human equality are emphatically expressed and fiercely lived out.  Her dearest friends are servants and she fights to save them from cruel fates.Danielle is also an exponent of learning, a value which was inculcated by her father's practice of reading to her every night as a child.  The last book her father read to her was ""Utopia,"" or, a book about ""Paradise,"" and she has greatly treasured this book ever since.  The Paradisical thread in the plot has implications in the fact that we find Henry changing into a new kind of potential King, eager to take on his opportunity through Kingship to do great things for humanity through the inspired management of his Kingdom.Another new twist to the old Cinderella plot is that although there are numerous kindly peasant servants, there is no distinct fairy godmother who manifests in order to transform Cinderella for the Ball.  The nearest thing to the godmother in this story, because he adds an outstanding feature to ""Cinderella's"" gown, is Leonardo da Vinci.  This amazing story is set up so that  da Vinci, a friend of the Prince, plays a major supporting role!Another welcome change to the old story is that one of the ""wicked step-sisters"" is not so ""wicked.""  There is a lot of very nice humor in this script and one of the funniest scenes for me occurred when this ""good"" step-sister was forced by her hard mother to come to the masked Ball wearing a horse head-piece.  However, the girl encounters there a fellow, presumably her future soul mate, who seems to really like horses.This movie was made in 1998 and yet there was no portrayal of sex or language use that would be considered objectionable by anyone.  What a pleasant relief!  I was so surprised by this!  I could hardly believe it!I deem this movie a RARE TREASURE.  It's full of beauty; fun; and good, humane, LOVING-AND-LEARNING PRINCIPLES!  In my opinion, both women and men of all ages would enjoy the movie if they had a taste for this sort of thing:  An innocent, fun romance but with depth.I found the closing statement of the Queen/narrator inaudible toward the end, so I listened to it several times and finally got it all.  She says that the couple did ""live happily ever after, but, the point IS that they Lived.""  This refers back to the introduction of the movie in which the Queen states that Cinderella and the Prince were real people who actually were a part of history, but it is a rather ambiguous remark, maybe meant as something to ponder.  I really LOVE this movie, which makes me laugh and smile.The story seems a bit silly at first but it ""takes off"" pretty soon.  The scenery is beautiful, set in the Perigorde region of France.

The premise may be clich&eacute;, but this is much, much more than just another &quot;Cinderella&quot; movie.  Its effects are really quite magical--it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will totally immerse you in its spell.  If you are human, it will produce a lump in your throat that will remain there for hours.  Some people might call this a &quot;woman's&quot; movie, but I, as a man, will proclaim that it really touches my heart every time I watch it, and I freely admit that it does bring tears to my eyes.  I need not go into detail describing the plot--it is a somewhat modernized Cinderella story, replete with the evil stepmother, charming prince, and angelic, mistreated heroine.  Instead of a fairy godmother, there is Leonardo da Vinci--an unexpected but brilliant scripting decision, I feel.  There are no magic pumpkins turning into horses and carriages, but there is magic; it is the magic of true love.The entire cast is superb, particularly Anjelica Huston as the evil stepmother, but all of them are overshadowed by Drew Barrymore.  Anyone who does not feel that Drew Barrymore is one of the greatest actresses of this and any other generation has obviously not seen this movie.  I love all of Drew's movies, but I really believe this movie represents her finest performance.  Even down to the most unimportant nuances of acting, she is simply brilliant.  She is equally convincing as a peasant in the field as she is a royal courtier among the nobility of France.  The emotion she is able to express to the audience is deep and amazingly real.  I really can't say enough about her performance here.All I can do is encourage you to experience this movie.  I believe you will want to watch it more than once; it is just as fresh and moving the second and third time as it is the first.  Don't dismiss it as a &quot;sappy love story&quot; or think its 16th century setting will make it hard to relate to.  This is a story as old as time itself, really, and it is a story that will always be relevant to humankind.

456900,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6305265488,Deborah Earle,"[8, 8]","Those responsible for the casting and historical setting of this version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; must own the same book on The Renaissance that I own from the National Geographic Society. I say this because on one particular page on the Court of the real King Francis I, there is featured a painting called &quot;Three Female Musicians&quot;, in which three dark-haired, dark-eyed ladies play instruments. The casting of Melanie Lynskey as Jacqueline de Ghent, the Good Stepsister, could well have been inspired by this painting. The same page also features an engraving of a tennis match such as the one featured in this film, which French nobles would have played in the 16th Century.As the heroine of the tale, a still-baby-faced Drew Barrymore delivers a fine, charismatic performance as the scullery maid who will not be broken by the authority of her cruel stepmother(Observe,the French don't have a word for &quot;stepmother&quot;, so there is a certain irony to the fact that this story takes place in France).Anjelica Huston matches acting genes with Drew Barrymore as the conniving, overindulged stepmother of noble blood who uses her servants as pawns and refuses to cut her losses in order to adapt to economic adversity. It should be obvious to a viewer that she could have made the three young girls in her care work together to maintain the manor rather than pit them against each other.As the Older Evil Stepsister, Marguerite, Megan Dodds was an interesting choice for the part because her pinched-faced cruelty is obvious to the audience, but not so readily obvious to the handsome Prince Henry, played by a befuddled but good-intentioned Dougray Scott, nor to the King and Queen, played by the appropriately strong and regal Timothy West and Judy Parfitt. Dodds'perfomance reminds me of the old adage, &quot;An indulgent mother makes a sluttish daughter.&quot;Melanie Lynskey's performance as the good Stepsister along with the performances of the actors who play the three servants, is one of the redeeming qualities of the otherwise miserable household. The presence of da Vinci in the story adds a divine benevolence to this tale, and as a child, I did read a version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; in which a male figure had the role of the Fairy Godmother.I have wondered why the accents of the principals were English rather than French. But ultimately, we watch an assertive young woman with a keen intellectual ability form a necessary and loving alliance with a Prince which appropriately takes place over time, proving her mettle against both his tormenters and her own, going out of her way to rescue those she loves, inspiring a childhood friend to do the same on her behalf, encouraging the understanding of societal outcasts, improving the quality of life for her small circle of friends, and justly putting her tormentors in their rightful places.This is a beautiful movie--a da Vinci painting come to life.

The costumes are beautiful.  The scenery is beautiful.  Watching this movie, makes me feel  as if I am part of the fairytale.  Second, this is a great twist on the  Cinderella story.  We see a girl who has been beaten down in almost all  aspects of her life, but does not allow her spirit to be beaten.  Trying to  save one of her beloved servants (though she has become a servant herself)  she goes to court to free him, also meeting the prince.  He is, of course,  smitten, and she keeps up a masquerade of a lady, in order to continue  seeing him.  The story follows the basics of the Cinderella tale (slipper,  wicked stepmother), but in this case, we have a Cinderella who doesn't need  a prince to save her, just to love her for who she is.

456909,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,6305265488,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[24, 26]","Very often ""realistic fantasy stories"" flop like dying fish. ""Ever After"" is one of the few exceptions, a sparkling tale about Cinderella in a semi-historic setting, with an outstanding cast, strong script, and a delightful love story. What's a fairy tale without magic? It's ""Ever After.""Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is a young girl raised alone by her father, who encourages his daughter's intelligence, curiosity and strong will. But her life takes a tragic turn when her father marries a haughty social-climber Baroness Rodmilla De Ghent (Angelica Houston), and brings her and her two daughters Marguerite and Jacqueline (Megan Dodds and Melanie Lynskey) to live with Danielle. He dies tragically of a heart attack, leaving his daughter alone with his widow. Years later, Danielle is treated like one of the servants, with whom she is a loyal friend. Her only relics of her past life are a pair of shoes and a beautiful dress left by her mother.When one of the servants is imprisoned falsely for theft, Danielle goes to try to save him. And there, she bumps into the young Prince Henry, who is being pressured by his stuffy parents to marry -- and Rodmilla is targeting him as a potential mate for one of her daughters. But Henry falls in love with Danielle -- her intelligence, her political knowledge, her love of fun, her bravery, and her strength.As Danielle and the prince grow closer, the scheming of her stepmother threatens to destroy their relationship.The director knows the right way to mix comedy and drama in a way that seems entirely plausible. When Henry ""dumps"" the Spanish princess, or when he wakes his parents with all sorts of bright plans, the audience laughs out of affectionate amusement. You like or dislike the characters exactly as the director wants you to. And he apparently knows that magic is less in plot elements than in the atmosphere -- though the setting is medieval France, there is the sort of bright, ornate look to the castle and clothes that you see in fairy tales. (The only exception is the painfully-90s gown and sparkling makeup that Danielle wears at the climax. This is medieval France, not the Butterfly prom!) The script is full of funny or tense moments, and the frequent uses of Sir Thomas More's ""Utopia"" add an extra dimension of realism. And, in perhaps the most brilliant move in this film, one of the stepsisters is not ""wicked."" Rather the chubby, not-as-pretty but good-natured Jacqueline adds a silent ally to Danielle and prevents Jacqueline and Marguerite from turning, essentially, into one character.Drew Barrymore is exquisite as Danielle, putting on Danielle's intelligence, wit and strength with ease and believability. Thankfully Danielle is never turned into a feminist in the usual sense of the word; she is unafraid to show that she is every inch a man's equal, but the movie doesn't bash viewers with that theme. Dougray Scott is equally good as Henry, mixing pride and confusion, sweetness and boredom into a very believable young prince. Anjelica Huston is almost hammily enjoyable as Rodmilla; Dodds and Lynskey are even better as her daughters. And even Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) makes an appearance to help smooth out the course of true love.This is a family movie in the best sense of the word. The plotline and scripting are clever enough for adults to enjoy thoroughly, but there is nothing that the kids can't watch. So get everyone together and watch this enchanting retelling.",5,Full of magic,1033084800,"09 27, 2002",2002,3468,"['Very', 'often', 'realistic', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'flop', 'dying', 'fish', 'Ever', 'one', 'few', 'exceptions', 'sparkling', 'tale', 'Cinderella', 'semi-historic', 'setting', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'strong', 'script', 'delightful', 'love', 'story', 'What', 'fairy', 'tale', 'magic', 'Ever', 'Danielle', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'young', 'girl', 'raised', 'alone', 'father', 'who', 'daughter', 'intelligence', 'curiosity', 'strong', 'will', 'life', 'tragic', 'turn', 'when', 'father', 'haughty', 'social-climber', 'Baroness', 'Rodmilla', 'De', 'Ghent', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'two', 'daughters', 'Marguerite', 'Jacqueline', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'live', 'Danielle', 'tragically', 'heart', 'attack', 'leaving', 'daughter', 'alone', 'widow', 'Years', 'later', 'Danielle', 'treated', 'one', 'servants', 'whom', 'loyal', 'friend', 'only', 'relics', 'past', 'life', 'are', 'pair', 'shoes', 'beautiful', 'dress', 'left', 'mother.When', 'one', 'servants', 'imprisoned', 'falsely', 'theft', 'Danielle', 'try', 'save', 'there', 'bumps', 'young', 'Prince', 'Henry', 'who', 'being', 'pressured', 'stuffy', 'parents', 'marry', 'Rodmilla', 'targeting', 'potential', 'mate', 'one', 'daughters', 'Henry', 'love', 'Danielle', 'intelligence', 'political', 'knowledge', 'love', 'fun', 'bravery', 'strength.As', 'Danielle', 'prince', 'grow', 'closer', 'scheming', 'stepmother', 'destroy', 'relationship.The', 'director', 'right', 'way', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'way', 'entirely', 'plausible', 'When', 'Henry', 'dumps', 'Spanish', 'princess', 'when', 'parents', 'sorts', 'bright', 'plans', 'audience', 'affectionate', 'amusement', 'dislike', 'characters', 'exactly', 'director', 'apparently', 'magic', 'less', 'plot', 'elements', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'medieval', 'France', 'sort', 'bright', 'ornate', 'look', 'castle', 'clothes', 'see', 'fairy', 'tales', 'only', 'exception', 'painfully-90s', 'gown', 'sparkling', 'makeup', 'Danielle', 'climax', 'medieval', 'France', 'not', 'Butterfly', 'prom', 'script', 'full', 'funny', 'tense', 'moments', 'frequent', 'uses', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'More', 'Utopia', 'add', 'extra', 'dimension', 'realism', 'perhaps', 'most', 'brilliant', 'move', 'film', 'one', 'stepsisters', 'not', 'wicked', 'chubby', 'not-as-pretty', 'good-natured', 'Jacqueline', 'silent', 'ally', 'Danielle', 'prevents', 'Jacqueline', 'Marguerite', 'turning', 'essentially', 'one', 'character.Drew', 'Barrymore', 'exquisite', 'Danielle', 'putting', 'Danielle', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'strength', 'ease', 'believability', 'Thankfully', 'Danielle', 'never', 'turned', 'feminist', 'usual', 'sense', 'word', 'unafraid', 'show', 'inch', 'man', 'equal', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bash', 'viewers', 'theme', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'equally', 'good', 'Henry', 'mixing', 'pride', 'confusion', 'sweetness', 'boredom', 'very', 'believable', 'young', 'prince', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'almost', 'hammily', 'enjoyable', 'Rodmilla', 'Dodds', 'Lynskey', 'are', 'even', 'better', 'daughters', 'even', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'Patrick', 'Godfrey', 'appearance', 'help', 'smooth', 'out', 'course', 'true', 'love.This', 'family', 'movie', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'plotline', 'scripting', 'are', 'clever', 'enough', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'nothing', 'kids', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'So', 'get', 'everyone', 'together', 'watch', 'enchanting', 'retelling']",N/A

Drew shines and endears as Danielle De Barbarac aka Cinderella.  Dougray Scott is Prince Henry and he fits this role perfectly. The rest of the supporting cast (Anjelica Huston, et al) compliment the leads in fine ways.This is what I would expect a modern (sort of) take on our beloved fairy tale to be. It's not trying to be the Disney version, nor is it trying to be the fairy tale. EVER AFTER holds it's own.  The characters and the story are developed in ways that fit their apparent personalities and not just the plot.  For example, it's clear from the beginning that the Baroness (stepmother Anjelica) has no use for Danielle, and her treatment of her up til the very end is nothing but contempt.  Stepsis Marguerite is a spoiled brat who will do whatever to get what she wants.  Danielle is a free spirit (I usually hate describing someone that way) who is full of dreams but makes room for others in those dreams.  Henry is a caged bird trying to break out of the mold expected of him in order to forge his own way in life.  Each of the characters provides depth to the story, including the gypsies (very funny scenes).  EVER AFTER fleshes out the story of Cinderella by giving Henry and Danielle a chance to get to know each other.At the risk of sounding super cheesy, I must say that I can watch this movie over and over and feel like I'm watching it for the first time. The direction is perfect, the visuals are great, and the acting choices are superb.Definitely rent this or watch on TV, but you might find yourself running out to buy it.

456945,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6305265488,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Drew Barrymore and spunky go together pretty well. Conversely, Drew Barrymore and spot-on British accents do not. Still, she is captivating in EVER AFTER, a fresh reinventing of the Cinderella fairy tale. Off the top of my head, when thinking of kid actresses who were able to successfully transition into having grown-up Hollywood careers, Barrymore springs to mind, along with Liz Taylor, Natalie Wood, and Jodie Foster. Barrymore just has a knack for making you invest in her characters.EVER AFTER benefits from the class and charisma of Jeanne Moreau. The movie opens with her welcoming the Brothers Grimm and offering to regale them with the true story of the fabled little cinder girl who, it turns out, had been a living, breathing person. The story shifts to 16th century France.EVER AFTER frames the Cinderella fairy tale in familiar enough trappings, but it's the delightful swerves which had me big grinning. Barrymore plays Danielle, 16th century's Miss Fiercely Independent. Once the beloved daughter of wealth and privelege, the father-less Danielle is forced into household servitude by her cruel step-mother. But, despite grueling hard work and a scaling down of status, Danielle grows up a bright and irrepressible girl, something which can't be said for her insufferable step-sisters.There's a glass slipper. There's a fancy ball. There's even a fairy godmother of sorts. There's a handsome prince, naturally. Specifically, Henry (Dougray Scott), the crown prince of France, chafing under the doom of an arranged marriage. When he flees in panic, he ends up in Danielle's backyard and comes under fire from Danielle's well-trajectoried apples (she thinks he's a thief). Prince Henry meets Danielle again soon after, except that, in the second encounter, Danielle is masquerading as nobility so as to effect a rescue of a family servant. Henry, believing her to be a comtesse, is baffled but smitten hard. ""Baffled and smitten hard"" sort of becomes Henry's default emotional setting. What do you expect when you spring a plucky and enlightened girl on a 16th century gent? It's probably an eyebrow raiser when a girl back in that day drops Thomas More quotes on a bloke.Barrymore carries the film, although the supporting cast does a good job of spotting her. She imbues Danielle with immense likability and a strong sense of self. This is a heroine who doesn't require a prince or shiny knight to come to her rescue. She does her own rescuing, thanks very much. In fact, in a marvelous scene set in the woods featuring gypsy bandits and tree-climbing (guess who climbs the tree?), Danielle ends up rescuing the prince.I like that most of the characters aren't reduced to caricatures. Barrymore's Danielle makes for a wonderfully appealing and high-spirited Cinderella. Anjelica Huston and Melanie Lynskey add dimensions to their roles of, respectively, the icy and calculating step-mother and the one rather sympathetic step-sister. You get the sense that the step-mother may have genuinely cared for Danielle's father and that he may have proved to be her saving grace should he had lived. But you can't gainsay how vile the step-mother is towards her step-daughter. When a despairing Danielle asks her step-mother if she'd ever loved her, the cool, cutting response is: ""How can anyone love pebble in their shoe?""

I am speaking of Ever After starring Drew Barrymore and Angelica Huston.  This is a Cinderella story with a bit of a twist.The film opens with an ageing Princess being visited by to two gentlemen who turn out to be the Brothers Grimm.  She compliments them on their work and mentions her fascination with the tale of the little cinder girl.  While the brothers joke about pumpkins and fairy godmothers the princess reveals the glass slipper and offers to tell them the true tale.Danielle gains a step-mother and two step-sisters when her father marries a Countess.  Soon she runs into the Prince.  She thinks he is a thief and pelts him with apples.  When she realizes her mistake she offers up her life.  But the Prince in on the run so he rewards her with gold.  Danielle uses the gold to buy back the husband of one of the servants.  But to do so she must impersonate a courtier and runs into the Prince again.  She manages to sneak away but only after giving her mother's name as her own.The stage is now set.  The Prince does not want to marry the Spanish Princess his father has arranged for and seeks out Danielle.  Under the pretense that she is a courtier they spend time together and a romance blossoms.  The Prince is all set to announce his engagement (made at midnight at a ball) to Danielle but her step-mother reveals her base heritage and the Prince becomes angry.  But in the end everything works out and the scene returns to the Brothers Grimm and Danielle's great-granddaughter.There are no elements of the fantastic in this tale.  No magic of fairies.  Instead an attempt is made to place the tale firmly into history.  The story is set in France in the Sixteenth century with the Prince being the Crown Prince of France.  A little more cement is added in the form of Leonardo Da.. Vinci who has arrived to be the Royal Artist.  Could this be during the two-year gap in Leonardo's history?  I don't know.  I do know that the movie is filled with humor, adventure and romance and stars a Cinderella who is a bit more competent than other renditions.Angelica Huston is perfect as the step-mother.  She really has the knack of being totally evil and proper at the same time.  My only problem with the film was that the younger step-sister resembled Drew Barrymore a little too much.  But that is a very minor point and hardly detracts from the film.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone who likes a bit of fun, adventure, romance or any combination of the three.",5,Cinerella in a New Light,1085702400,"05 28, 2004",2004,2590,"['past', 'weekend', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'am', 'speaking', 'Ever', 'starring', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Angelica', 'Huston', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'bit', 'twist.The', 'film', 'ageing', 'Princess', 'being', 'visited', 'two', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'work', 'mentions', 'fascination', 'tale', 'little', 'cinder', 'girl', 'brothers', 'joke', 'pumpkins', 'fairy', 'godmothers', 'princess', 'glass', 'slipper', 'tell', 'true', 'tale.Danielle', 'gains', 'step-mother', 'two', 'step-sisters', 'when', 'father', 'Countess', 'Soon', 'Prince', 'thief', 'pelts', 'apples', 'When', 'mistake', 'up', 'life', 'Prince', 'run', 'so', 'gold', 'Danielle', 'gold', 'buy', 'back', 'husband', 'one', 'servants', 'do', 'so', 'must', 'impersonate', 'courtier', 'Prince', 'again', 'sneak', 'away', 'only', 'giving', 'mother', 'name', 'own.The', 'stage', 'now', 'set', 'Prince', 'not', 'want', 'marry', 'Spanish', 'Princess', 'father', 'arranged', 'out', 'Danielle', 'pretense', 'courtier', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'romance', 'blossoms', 'Prince', 'set', 'announce', 'engagement', 'made', 'midnight', 'ball', 'Danielle', 'step-mother', 'reveals', 'base', 'heritage', 'Prince', 'angry', 'end', 'everything', 'out', 'scene', 'returns', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'Danielle', 'great-granddaughter.There', 'are', 'elements', 'fantastic', 'tale', 'magic', 'fairies', 'Instead', 'attempt', 'made', 'place', 'tale', 'firmly', 'history', 'story', 'set', 'France', 'Sixteenth', 'century', 'Prince', 'being', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'France', 'little', 'more', 'cement', 'added', 'form', 'Leonardo', 'Da..', 'Vinci', 'who', 'arrived', 'be', 'Royal', 'Artist', 'Could', 'be', 'two-year', 'gap', 'Leonardo', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'know', 'movie', 'filled', 'humor', 'adventure', 'romance', 'Cinderella', 'who', 'bit', 'more', 'competent', 'other', 'renditions.Angelica', 'Huston', 'perfect', 'step-mother', 'really', 'knack', 'being', 'totally', 'evil', 'proper', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'problem', 'film', 'was', 'younger', 'step-sister', 'resembled', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'very', 'minor', 'point', 'hardly', 'detracts', 'film', 'whole-heartedly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'bit', 'fun', 'adventure', 'romance', 'combination', 'three']",N/A

In fact, it was the 1st fairy tale story I read.  Then came the cartoon theatre release, & I saw it several times as well.  To a child's simple mind & heart, Cinderella embodies the fulfillment of a quite forsaken dream.Now that I am a mother & am retelling the story to my daughter,I am quite critical of the character. I find the cartoon 'Cinderella' character quite pathetic.  Yes, truthful & naive but too soft.Now, Daniella is what I have in mind as the perfect Cinderella.  If I were the prince, I would not fall for a lady-in-distress type of maiden.  I would look for someone who has guts, intelligence & strength - both physically & emotionally.  Yes, Drew/Daniella's physical built was bigger than the ideal fair-framed but hers was more realistic.  If you were made to work on the fields like a slave, you would grow strong & rough.Ever After, despite its slightly different portrayal of a long-known fairy tale character, retained its charm & appeal to folks of both gender & of all ages.

All of them are fun to watch though, I've enjoyed in in its own way.This version is a different twist on the story.  There is no fairy godmother (though Leonardo DaVinci kinda helps out)!  The basic story is the same.. raggedy Cinderella (aka Danielle in this movie, played by Drew Barrymore) falls for the handsome prince (Dougray Scott from Mission Impossible 2).  The cool thing about Cinderella this time, she's no meek little servant!  While she does end up having to do plenty of chores  for the evil step-mother, she kicks butt with a sword and throws a mean punch!The costumes and location of this movie were beautiful.  I especially loved Cinderella's costume she wore at the climactic ball - it was truly breathtaking.  I would have preferred they did the traditional glass slipper, her shoes were... not attractive to me.  The rest of the gown was gorgeous though!!

Sound familiar?  It is; it is Cinderella.  In this version, the main character is a loud mouthed tomboy who has a kind, generous, and loving heart.  Fate would have it that she meets the crown prince of France while saving one of her servants from being sent away to America, and the seeds of love or at least curiosity are sown.""Everafter"" is one of those rare movies that actually transcends to material that is based off of.  Cinderella, at its heart, like many of the Grimms Fairytales, is not a love story, but a morality tale.  That is what folk tales are, morality in story form.  With this in mind, ""Everafter"" does not go for the morality tale, but the love story with morality undertones.What makes ""Everafter"" unique is that is has a great cast and message behind it.  The story, of course, is completely predictable, but the script is dramatic but peppered with a great sense of humor!  The principle message of the movie is that in for a relationship to work, you must be honest, and hiding things only makes the situation worse.  It also highlights that true love is not perfect, and that in love, we must learn to forgive many times.  One of my favorite scenes is the one after the ball between Prince Henry and Divinci.  This shows how the movie treads the line between love at first sight and making the choice to love.Is this a realistic movie?  Absolutely not.  Would you watch a movie about Cinderella and expect realism?  I would hope not.The only thing I would change is the DVD.  There are no extras except a trailer, which is not an extra.  So, where is the special anniversary edition with cast interviews/documentaries on the film and director/cast commentaries???  That is what all of us want!

Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the brave, pure-hearted heroine, and Anjelica Huston is fantastic as her evil stepmother. She plays it with just enough evil, which is masterful acting. Melanie Lynskey (the guys' neighbor in Two An A Half Men) has a supporting role one of as Danielle's (Cinderella's) stepsisters, and she is very charming. Dougray Scott as the Prince was a bit one-dimensional, but he was handsome and rich and championed her in the end, so that made up for it. Megan Dodds overplayed her role a bit as Danielle's other stepsister, but it didn't hurt the film any. The immersing of Leonardo Da Vinci into this film was a brilliant idea, and important to Danielle's success (you'l see). She didn't need a ""fairy godmother"" because she had him.

Boy was I blown away by this film, Drew Barrymore has done the impossible -she made Cinderella accessible to today's independent, free spirited women like me.  Her Danielle (Cinderella) isn't sitting around waiting to be saved by some Prince.  She's strong willed, forceful, has her own opinions and is independent. These very qualities are the qualities that made her Unique and intoxicating to her Prince Charming.  She's a true role model for women of all ages. It's a feminist version without being preachy, and it's the perfect light hearted, yet romantic film that both women and men can enjoy.  It's the type of film that you can watch over and over again, no matter what mood you are in. It's perfectly vapid, but charming and engaging at the same time. I watched it 15 times in two months.  This film is highly recommended.This is a rare case where the VHS Edition of a film outshines the DVD Version. The DVD's Letterboxed aspect ratio is too extreme, even for my 60 Inch Widescreen TV, the picture was still way to small, and it's not even animorphic, so zooming in, still doesn't fill up the screen. The Digital transfer is sharp but the extreme aspect ratio makes the color tones on the cinematography look washed out. As far as the added value DVD Junk that we've come to expect from a Fox release, this DVD is barren.The only thing it contains is the Trailer and some cast bios, and for that they want $29? Don't pay it!  Get the VHS Tape. This is one of those films that's truly meant to fill up an entire screen and you can only get that with the VHS version.This was one of Fox's very first DVD releases so I forgive it for the sloppiness and shallowness of this package - only because I love the movie so much.

457020,A11ID14NBRS9UB,6305265488,"""marshmelly""","[2, 3]","I've said in other reviews i've done, Drew Barrymore is my all-time favorite actress. She portrays a sweetness and honesty to her characters. She does great in Romantic movies and this is my favorite romance movie she's done even though I also love Mad Love, The Wedding Singer, and Never Been Kissed. This is my all-time favorite version of Cinderella I think it's one of the few times where a different version than the original was 10 times better. My fasination with the story of Cinderella really started with this there is so much they did that made the movie better than the original did not.Drew Barrymore plays Danielle Debaberake (sp?) AKA Cinderella. Her mother died when she was a baby and for 8 years it was just her loving father and her. That is until he remarried and suddenly Danielle is left to get used to having a stepmother and two stepsisters around her age. Well 5 min. within the movie her her father dies and her stepmother makes her a servant and constantly verbally abuses her. When Cinderella is 18 is when Drew comes into the picture and she plays a very independent wise spunky and beautiful Cinderella.Anjelica Houston is priceless as the wicked stepmother and adds so much to the sterotype character. Anjelica while playing a mean and self-centered stepmother also adds a tiny touch of tenderness and feelings to the character the main scene you can see this is when Danielle is brushing her hair and the stepmother talks to her. Anjelica is such a classy graceful actress and I can't imagine anyone playing the stepmother better. She is almost worth watching this movie by herself.Dougory Scott plays the prince of france Henry he is very easy on the eyes and is believeable as a prince. The prince is unintentionaly arrogant and at the first of the movie comes off as a little jerky. But that all changes when he meets Danielle. Her stepmother sold one of her fathers long-time servants to the americas when she couldn't pay her taxes and Danielle puts on a nice dress and does her hair and pretends to be part of the court in order to get him released. This is where she meets the prince who is automaticaly and obviously smitten and dumbfounded by her spirit and the fact she's the only &quot;courteer&quot; that has told him like it is and hasn't sucked up to him. Watching the two bump heads at their first few meetings as he at first always comes off jerky to her but the two are still smitten with each other is quite amusing to watch.Her stepsister Margeritte (sp?) is blonde beautiful and bitc*y. She is constantly favored and spoiled by her mother and has her eyes on the prince simply because he's a prince. She ridiculously flirts with him everytime they are together and despite her great amount of effort it's obvious to the viewer that she'll never match up to Danielle. Margerette and her mother is still willing to &quot;take care&quot; of any competition that comes along and spends most of the movie scheming on how to get the princes affections.I love how they made one of the stepsister's nice. Jacalenne is Danielles other stepsister who is actually very sweet softspoken and sympathetic to cinderella but at the sametime wants to please her mother. She is also verbally abused by her mother and is only a level up from Danielle in her mother's point of view. Even her dress is only a slight fancier than Danielle's. Every scene she's in she brings sweetness and innocence.Also unlike the original, the prince and Danielle met long before the &quot;ball&quot; and so they already built affection before then. When she opens up her heart to &quot;Henry&quot; she starts standing up to her stepmother and to Margerette. When I first saw this, this made the movie for me. I myself am a very fiesty &quot;no crap&quot; woman and I found myself getting totally frustrated when someone is mistreated and they just stand there and take it. I kept saying &quot;IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD OF TOLD THEM WHERE TO GO&quot; so when she starts mouthing off back to them I thought &quot;you go girl it's about damn time&quot; one of the most satisfying scenes is when she socks Margerette in the eye. I found myself wishing she could of gotten in a couple more hits because like I said throughout the movie Margerette is a complete bit**.This movie is funny, touching, romantic, dramatic, and just overall entertaining. Everyone in this movie holds their place and whoever cast this movie knows what they are doing cause I can't imagine anyone of these roles being played by anyone else better.This is a great movie for anyone but I do think girls will appreciate it more because of all the romance and the &quot;independent woman&quot; vibe cinderella holds.",5,one of my all-time favorites,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,4695,"[""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'i', ""'ve"", 'done', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actress', 'sweetness', 'honesty', 'characters', 'great', 'Romantic', 'movies', 'favorite', 'romance', 'movie', 'done', 'even', 'also', 'love', 'Mad', 'Love', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'version', 'Cinderella', 'think', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'different', 'version', 'original', 'was', '10', 'times', 'better', 'fasination', 'story', 'Cinderella', 'really', 'started', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'made', 'movie', 'better', 'original', 'did', 'not.Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Danielle', 'Debaberake', 'sp', 'AKA', 'Cinderella', 'mother', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'baby', '8', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'loving', 'father', 'remarried', 'suddenly', 'Danielle', 'left', 'get', 'used', 'having', 'stepmother', 'two', 'stepsisters', 'age', 'Well', '5', 'min', 'movie', 'father', 'dies', 'stepmother', 'servant', 'constantly', 'verbally', 'When', 'Cinderella', '18', 'when', 'Drew', 'picture', 'very', 'independent', 'wise', 'spunky', 'beautiful', 'Cinderella.Anjelica', 'Houston', 'priceless', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'so', 'much', 'sterotype', 'character', 'Anjelica', 'playing', 'mean', 'self-centered', 'stepmother', 'also', 'tiny', 'touch', 'tenderness', 'feelings', 'character', 'main', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'Danielle', 'brushing', 'hair', 'stepmother', 'talks', 'Anjelica', 'such', 'classy', 'graceful', 'actress', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'playing', 'stepmother', 'better', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'herself.Dougory', 'Scott', 'prince', 'france', 'Henry', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'believeable', 'prince', 'prince', 'unintentionaly', 'arrogant', 'first', 'movie', 'off', 'little', 'jerky', 'changes', 'when', 'Danielle', 'stepmother', 'sold', 'one', 'fathers', 'long-time', 'servants', 'americas', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'pay', 'taxes', 'Danielle', 'nice', 'dress', 'hair', 'pretends', 'be', 'part', 'court', 'order', 'get', 'released', 'where', 'prince', 'who', 'automaticaly', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'dumbfounded', 'spirit', 'fact', 'only', 'quot', 'courteer', 'quot', 'told', ""n't"", 'sucked', 'up', 'Watching', 'two', 'bump', 'heads', 'first', 'few', 'meetings', 'first', 'always', 'off', 'jerky', 'two', 'are', 'still', 'smitten', 'other', 'quite', 'amusing', 'watch.Her', 'stepsister', 'Margeritte', 'sp', 'blonde', 'beautiful', 'bitc*y', 'constantly', 'favored', 'spoiled', 'mother', 'eyes', 'prince', 'simply', 'prince', 'ridiculously', 'everytime', 'are', 'together', 'great', 'amount', 'effort', 'obvious', 'viewer', ""'ll"", 'never', 'match', 'up', 'Danielle', 'Margerette', 'mother', 'still', 'willing', 'quot', 'take', 'care', 'quot', 'competition', 'along', 'most', 'movie', 'scheming', 'how', 'get', 'princes', 'affections.I', 'love', 'how', 'made', 'one', 'stepsister', 'nice', 'Jacalenne', 'Danielles', 'other', 'stepsister', 'who', 'actually', 'very', 'sweet', 'softspoken', 'sympathetic', 'cinderella', 'sametime', 'please', 'mother', 'also', 'verbally', 'abused', 'mother', 'only', 'level', 'up', 'Danielle', 'mother', 'point', 'view', 'Even', 'dress', 'only', 'slight', 'fancier', 'Danielle', 'scene', 'sweetness', 'innocence.Also', 'original', 'prince', 'Danielle', 'met', 'long', 'quot', 'quot', 'already', 'built', 'affection', 'then', 'When', 'up', 'heart', 'quot', 'Henry', 'quot', 'standing', 'up', 'stepmother', 'Margerette', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'made', 'movie', 'am', 'very', 'fiesty', 'quot', 'crap', 'quot', 'woman', 'found', 'getting', 'totally', 'frustrated', 'when', 'someone', 'mistreated', 'just', 'stand', 'there', 'take', 'kept', 'saying', 'quot', 'IF', 'THAT', 'WAS', 'ME', 'WOULD', 'OF', 'TOLD', 'THEM', 'WHERE', 'TO', 'GO', 'quot', 'so', 'when', 'mouthing', 'off', 'back', 'thought', 'quot', 'go', 'girl', 'damn', 'time', 'quot', 'one', 'most', 'satisfying', 'scenes', 'when', 'Margerette', 'eye', 'found', 'wishing', 'could', 'gotten', 'couple', 'more', 'hits', 'said', 'movie', 'Margerette', 'complete', 'bit**.This', 'movie', 'funny', 'touching', 'romantic', 'dramatic', 'just', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'place', 'whoever', 'cast', 'movie', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'cause', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'roles', 'being', 'played', 'anyone', 'else', 'better.This', 'great', 'movie', 'anyone', 'do', 'think', 'girls', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'romance', 'quot', 'independent', 'woman', 'quot', 'cinderella']",N/A

457024,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305265488,Matthew Horner,"[6, 6]","When I heard that Drew Barrymore, ex-addict and former all around bad girl, was going to star in a reworking of Cinderella, I decided that her much publicized recovery had gone too far. She had become a child star in that famous fairy tale know as E.T, and I saw no way for this worldly young woman to return to that genre. I was wrong.Ever After is a delight. It's not a masterpiece. It has some structural flaws. But the thoughtfulness and hard work that went into make it a fine entertainment. And Barrymore shows again that she has her famous family's genes.This movie makes a number of changes to the children's classic. Most of them work, and all are intended to update the story. Barrymore's Danielle [Cinderella] is not the helpless victim of the original tale. She's a bright, feisty girl whose had some bad breaks in life and is trying to make the best of them. The always wonderful Anjelica Houston, who can play every thing from comedies [The Addams Family] to thrillers [Prizzi's Honor, The Grifters], portrays the stepmother, Rodnilla, as a miserable, ambitious woman. She's mean-spirited, but hardly evil incarnate. When her husband dies early in the film, her grief seems as genuine as his daugher, Danielle's. Even the stepsisters have changed. Neither are ugly. One is ordinary looking and is secretly appalled at the way Danielle is treated. The other is beautiful to look at, but as heartless as they come on the inside.One of the best changes is in the social outlook. Many fairy tales are basically about impoverished characters in a country that oppresses the poor. They wind up marrying a member. The irony is that they become a member of the group that oppressed them, and once in, they appear to do nothing for the people they let behind. They are too busy living happily ever after. I always felt this sent a not-so-moral lesson to children.In Ever After, Danielle is less than impressed when she meets Price Henry [Dougray Scott]. He is witty and handsome, but it is his father, after all, who has made life so miserable for the commoners. Henry gives no indication that he will be much different. Their second meeting happens only because Danielle must save a servant who has been taken away in lieu of the family's back taxes. She then finds out that he does have a heart and a brain, and that his attitude is a result of his never having know any life but a royal one.The movie is done with a fine sense of humor. The dialog is very well written, and the cast delivers their lines with gusto.

And someone always outbidded me at the last minute. So when I saw this for a reasonable price, I pounced on it. And it's one of those movies that just yell out to you to watch it straight away rather than those that sit there gathering dust, cos you can't bear to watch them - the two sequels to Mad Max, cos the first one was so bad!Drew Barrymore is a great actress in this, going from a little scruff, to almost a member of royalty. You laugh when she first hits the Prince with an apple (good shot!). You ache for her as her world seems to fall apart when Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) learns the truth. You cheer when she renders justice to her oppressors. Despite what other reviewers have said, her accent was certainly not the dodgiest, try Dougray Scott's accent! If you listen very carefully, his true Scottish accent doesn't quite manage to stay hidden.I would have definitely have rated this movie 4 out of 5 if it hadn't been for Dougray Scott. He is just missing something that makes a normal leading man so terrific. I didn't like him at all. And he didn't look like how I imagine Prince Charming to look when I was young. I can't put my finger on why I don't like him, or why he doesn't make a good leading man, it's just something strange.Anjelica Huston was great in the movie. She didn't quite have the evilness I was after, at times she was actually quite nice, especially when she told Danielle how much she looked like her dad. She also reminded me of the character (the name escapes me) she played in Mists of Avalon.There are some things I miss from the original Disney version. The fact that Cinderella & Prince Charming never really meet until the end, and he's supposed to find the woman he loves, and uses her glass slipper to find her. In this, Danielle does leave her glass slipper behind, but he already knows that. And then the Fairy Godmother is missing. But the addition of Da Vinci, if historically incorrect, is a nice twist on the Fairy Godmother.This is definitely a must have for all romantics at heart, and if you're a fan of Dougray Scott, then that's a bonus I suppose.

The plot is conventional, without too many surprises, but it was perfectly cast and holds together throughout. The story is set in Renaissance France. Drew Barrymore's performance as Danielle, an orphan commoner forced to act as a servant to her noble step-mother and step-sisters, is flawless. When one of Danielle's fellow servants is slated for shipment to the Americas as a thief (a scapegoat for the step-mother's debts), Danielle disguises herself as a lady of the court in order to exact his freedom. While in disguise, she is spotted by the French Prince, Henry (Dougray Scott), who is fascinated by her spirit. Believing her to be a noblewoman, he falls in love with her, but her sister Marguerite has her own designs on the prince, and she and her mother will stop at nothing to get Danielle out of the way.The supporting cast is wonderful as well. Anjelica Huston as the stepmother and Megan Dodds as Marguerite just ooze with malice and contempt. Their wicked scheming is both sinister and delightful to watch at the same time. The second step-sister, Jacqueline, who in this version of the story is only slighter better treated than Cinderella herself, is portrayed by Melanie Lynskey. She does a terrific job of showing her character's torn emotions, wanting to please her mother, but sympathetic to her unfairly-treated step-sister. And finally, the addition of Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) to the story as court painter was a stroke of genius in more than one way. A friend of the prince, his words of wisdom end up turning him into something of a matchmaker.The film is further enhanced by beautiful cinematography (the opening credit sequence alone is breathtaking), gorgeous period costumes, and a wonderful musical score. The story is not, of course, historically accurate, but then it isn't supposed to be. This is a fairy tale, and in that regard it is executed to perfection.My only disappointment is with the DVD itself. The &quot;Bonus Features&quot; link in the menu is a joke, as it leads to nothing more than the theatrical trailer. There isn't a single featurette, or cast/crew interview, or anything. A movie like this could have had some great material discussing the process of developing this adaptation, the costumes, and casting choices, the music, etc. I would love to know more about the thought processes behind this film, and for this omission I have to drop my overall rating of the DVD to a four, though I'd give the movie itself a five. I almost hope they release some sort of special edition in the future, with featurettes included, though then I'd be forced to buy it all over again. But nevertheless, this is definitely a DVD worth owning. The charisma of the entire cast makes this the perfect Cinderella story.",4,"A five-star movie, but a slightly disappointing DVD.",1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,2861,"['As', 'far', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'age-old', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'plot', 'conventional', 'too', 'many', 'surprises', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'together', 'story', 'set', 'Renaissance', 'France', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'performance', 'Danielle', 'orphan', 'commoner', 'forced', 'act', 'servant', 'noble', 'step-mother', 'step-sisters', 'flawless', 'When', 'one', 'Danielle', 'fellow', 'servants', 'slated', 'shipment', 'Americas', 'thief', 'scapegoat', 'step-mother', 'debts', 'Danielle', 'lady', 'court', 'order', 'exact', 'freedom', 'disguise', 'spotted', 'French', 'Prince', 'Henry', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'who', 'fascinated', 'spirit', 'Believing', 'be', 'noblewoman', 'love', 'sister', 'Marguerite', 'own', 'designs', 'prince', 'mother', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'Danielle', 'way.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'stepmother', 'Megan', 'Dodds', 'Marguerite', 'just', 'ooze', 'malice', 'contempt', 'wicked', 'scheming', 'sinister', 'delightful', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'second', 'step-sister', 'Jacqueline', 'who', 'version', 'story', 'only', 'slighter', 'better', 'treated', 'Cinderella', 'portrayed', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'terrific', 'job', 'showing', 'character', 'torn', 'emotions', 'wanting', 'please', 'mother', 'sympathetic', 'unfairly-treated', 'step-sister', 'finally', 'addition', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'Patrick', 'Godfrey', 'story', 'court', 'painter', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'friend', 'prince', 'words', 'wisdom', 'end', 'up', 'turning', 'something', 'matchmaker.The', 'film', 'further', 'enhanced', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'opening', 'credit', 'sequence', 'alone', 'breathtaking', 'gorgeous', 'period', 'costumes', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'score', 'story', 'not', 'course', 'historically', 'accurate', 'then', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'fairy', 'tale', 'regard', 'executed', 'perfection.My', 'only', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'quot', 'link', 'menu', 'joke', 'nothing', 'more', 'theatrical', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'single', 'featurette', 'cast/crew', 'interview', 'anything', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'great', 'material', 'discussing', 'process', 'developing', 'adaptation', 'costumes', 'casting', 'choices', 'music', 'etc', 'would', 'love', 'know', 'more', 'thought', 'film', 'omission', 'have', 'drop', 'overall', 'rating', 'DVD', 'four', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'almost', 'hope', 'release', 'sort', 'special', 'edition', 'future', 'featurettes', 'included', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'forced', 'buy', 'over', 'again', 'nevertheless', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'worth', 'owning', 'charisma', 'entire', 'cast', 'perfect', 'Cinderella', 'story']",N/A
457047,A228JH8V9Y700G,6305265488,MortensOrchid,"[3, 3]","Cinderella is the most popular fairy tale of all time.  There are several versions of the story that we might have all read at different points as children.  This had ""chick flick"" written all over it, but I was pleased with the results as they fleshed out this tale as best as they could.Drew Barrymore, the world's most successful comeback child star, plays Danielle, a young peasant girl in France.  Like the fairy tale, her father remarries, gains a family of a step mother and two step sisters, then suddenly dies.  Danielle is left with her new family but finds the true nature of her step mother to be cold and cruel (played wonderfully by Angelica Houston).  Her bitter jealousy of Danielle's good qualities and contempt is obvious.  What the fairy tale versions did not always hint at (with the possible exception of the Disney animated movie) was that the step mother is plotting for her own daughter to be in favor with the royal court and marry the prince.  It makes for many hilarious situations with Danielle and her step mother and sister (see that scene when she knocks her over and her feet go flying over her head).  Her younger step sister, while the weaker and clearly not the favorite of the two, makes for Danielle's unlikely ally.While Danielle tries to keep the peace and home and make the best of her situation, the prince of France one day comes right to her door.  Prince Henry is suffering from a combination of cold feet and growing pains, and when a willful Danielle comes into the picture he is taken aback.  While at first there is animosity between them, but the love will naturally grow.  They incorporate some more modern themes in this story that your average so-and-so in those times might not have been thinking of (education, free thinking, justice system, etc.) because a vast majority were illiterate.  Plus, Danielle is strong enough that she doesn't need the prince to come rescue her from the evil neighbor who bought her.  She slays the dragon herself and has a humbled prince come before her asking her to take him back.  And her fairy godmother is none other than Leonardo DiVinci himself.This is a wonderful take on the most beloved of all fairy tales and leaves wonders to the imagination.",5,The world's most popular fairy tale,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,2238,"['Cinderella', 'most', 'popular', 'fairy', 'tale', 'time', 'are', 'several', 'versions', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'read', 'different', 'points', 'children', 'had', 'chick', 'flick', 'written', 'was', 'pleased', 'results', 'fleshed', 'out', 'tale', 'as', 'best', 'could.Drew', 'Barrymore', 'world', 'most', 'successful', 'comeback', 'child', 'star', 'Danielle', 'young', 'peasant', 'girl', 'France', 'fairy', 'tale', 'father', 'remarries', 'gains', 'family', 'step', 'mother', 'two', 'step', 'sisters', 'then', 'suddenly', 'Danielle', 'left', 'new', 'family', 'true', 'nature', 'step', 'mother', 'be', 'cold', 'cruel', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'bitter', 'jealousy', 'Danielle', 'good', 'qualities', 'contempt', 'obvious', 'What', 'fairy', 'tale', 'versions', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'hint', 'possible', 'exception', 'Disney', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'step', 'mother', 'plotting', 'own', 'daughter', 'be', 'favor', 'royal', 'court', 'marry', 'prince', 'many', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'Danielle', 'step', 'mother', 'sister', 'see', 'scene', 'when', 'over', 'feet', 'go', 'flying', 'head', 'younger', 'step', 'sister', 'weaker', 'clearly', 'not', 'favorite', 'two', 'Danielle', 'unlikely', 'ally.While', 'Danielle', 'tries', 'keep', 'peace', 'home', 'make', 'best', 'situation', 'prince', 'France', 'one', 'day', 'right', 'door', 'Prince', 'Henry', 'suffering', 'combination', 'cold', 'feet', 'growing', 'pains', 'when', 'willful', 'Danielle', 'picture', 'taken', 'aback', 'first', 'animosity', 'love', 'will', 'naturally', 'grow', 'incorporate', 'more', 'modern', 'themes', 'story', 'average', 'so-and-so', 'times', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'education', 'free', 'thinking', 'justice', 'system', 'etc', 'vast', 'majority', 'were', 'illiterate', 'Danielle', 'strong', 'enough', ""n't"", 'need', 'prince', 'come', 'rescue', 'evil', 'neighbor', 'who', 'bought', 'dragon', 'herself', 'humbled', 'prince', 'come', 'asking', 'take', 'back', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'none', 'other', 'Leonardo', 'DiVinci', 'himself.This', 'wonderful', 'take', 'most', 'beloved', 'fairy', 'tales', 'wonders', 'imagination']",N/A

The very next day, Danielle's father leaves the manor and dies of a heart attack before passing the gates.  Ten years later, Danielle has been reduced to nothing more than a servant, while her stepfamily lives the life of luxury.  One day, the prince steals one of Danielle's horses and is brutally hit by Danielle.  When he is recognized by her, he pays her a large sum to keep her silence.  With that money, Danielle dresses as a courtier and frees Mauriece, a servant the Baroness (her stepmother) sold to pay taxes.  When the prince sees her, she gives him an alias: Comtess Nicole de Lancret.  The king tells the prince that he will host a masque and either choose his bride before that night or he will marry a Spanish princess.  Now that the masque is approaching, Danielle is rushing here and there to see the prince, but to make sure that her family doesn't discover her.

He was Danielle's father's top servant. Once I recognized his face, the plot made more sense. The stepmother and wicked stepsister  are sinister and ridiculous at the same time. And the &quot;good&quot; stepsister was a good idea. It made more sense to have one of the other young women be empathetic to &quot;Cinderella.&quot;The young prince was just right, full of strength and spirit, and not too perfect to be believable. And Drew Barrymore! Why, this move makes me want to go out and rent every other movie she's made. She was superb in this film!

It takes place during the Renassiance in France.  The film in and of itself is well made.  The costumes are appropriate for that period of time.  The acting is very good.  The plot is excellent.  The way it is told is fantastic.The "" Cinderella"" character, Danielle, starts out as the original story did.  The girl is a child who gains a step-mother, Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent and 2 step-sisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline, and is doted on by her father.  Shortly thereafter Danielle's father dies.About 10 years later Danielle is a servant in what was her own house.  Danielle is loved and looked after by the other servants.  Prince Henry, the crown prince of France, wants nothing to do with the responsibility that being king will bring him.  Henry runs away, again.  He runs into Danielle, who nearly beats him up for stealing one of her horses.  Once she finds out who he is he pays her to keep quiet.  Danielle uses the money to buy back one of the servants that Rodmilla sold to pay her taxes.  Danielle pretends to be an aristrocrat to do this.  She also runs into Henry who doesn't recognize her.  Instead of the fawning that he is used to getting by the ladies at court what he gets from Danielle is something of a lecture.  He also has to chase her which is something new for him as well.  Danielle gives her mother's name, Nicole, as her own.  Then she leaves.Henry and Danielle run into each other a few more times.  During all of this Danielle befriends Leonardo Da Vinci, the artist in residence at the French court.  Leonardo has some inkling that Danielle is not what she pretends to be, but he says nothing.  Meanwhile Marguerite, the prettiest and most spoiled of Rodmilla's daughters, is relentlessly pursuing Henry.  Both she and Rodmilla are convinced that because Marguerite is so pretty that she will marry Henry and be the next queen of France.  Jacqueline is the only one in Rodmilla's family who is remotely kind to Danielle and that is probably because Rodmilla treats Jacqueline as she were the bad seed of the family because Jacqueline is a tad overweight and is not nearly as pretty as Marguerite.Danielle and Henry get to know one another.  He is entranced by her passion for life.  At one point Danielle even saves Henry's life.  Danielle discovers that while Henry may be an aristocrat he looks at being a prince as a burden.  He is also neither truly spoiled or arrogant.  Henry turns out to be rather kind and he rarely shows who he truly is to anyone.Once Rodmilla finds out that Henry likes Danielle she tries to sabotage the relationship.  Danielle starts to stand up to Rodmilla and Marguerite.  Jacqueline admires her for that and even cares for Danielle's wounds that Rodmilla gives her.

In fact, you will feel very much a part of this movie as it will embrace your heart and captivate your attention.As I watched this delicious fairy tale for the second time...this very evening, it occurred to me that my need to see the movie for the second time was so I could analyze the characters and find out why this story was quite so human yet so magical. Drew Barrymore (Cinderella) lent an almost ethereal quality to the movie. She floated on the screen like an angel, even before she gets her wings. She will steal your heart with her acting! She plays a country girl or a queen with equal ease. Only Drew could have played this part so well.I found many contrasts in this movie. The idea of a greedy selfish woman chasing a rich man versus a man seeking the companionship of an intelligent woman who has inner beauty is contrasted quite beautifully in Ever After. A score fit for royalty fills out the film, carrying the emotions from light and carefree to deep and thoughtful, and sometimes even pensive. In some scenes, you must observe the facial expressions to completely appreciate the humor. You will laugh so many times you will want to watch it again. You will also laugh again the second time you watch it and will even appreciate the humor more. I could list 20 favorite witty lines at least.Cinderella is Danielle. To Danielle's stepmother, she is mearly a pebble in her shoe. To the Prince of France (Dougray Scott) she is a mountain of strength that inspires him to pursue his own dreams and ""enlightens"" him. While Danielle is trapped in a social nightmare as a servant girl, she is happy. The prince who has everything, is still trying to find himself. When Prince Henry and Danielle meet, she throws apples at him, not realizing who he is. When Danielle helps to free a servant from being sold into slavery with money she received at the time the prince ""borrows"" one of their horses to escape from the palace....they again meet and he is intrigued by her knowledge of a book her father gave to her just before he died.Prince Henry is not satisfied with his station in life so he seeks out ways to encourage his own happiness. He is destined to become king, yet does not desire the responsibility. Danielle is seeking love and has lost both her parents and her stepmother (Anjelica Huston) has lost the ability to love and is the child of an obsessive compulsive mother. One key to her character is when Danielle's father dies and all the evil stepmother says is: ""You cannot leave me here."" She has a human side and we somehow feel we want to like her, yet her words at times are chilling!Her daughters are quite different. Jacqueline sees through their mothers fake attempts at deceiving their stepsister and Marguerite knows how to increase the intrigue, yet almost stalks the Prince to gain his attention. Danielle on the other hand casts an intoxicating spell on the Prince that he cannot resist.There is nothing feminist about this movie. Yes, Danielle does enjoy reading and when she is given the choice of any book on a bookshelf she says: ""I could no sooner choose a star in the heavens."" She wants to educate herself, yet she does not demand that she be equal to the Prince, but does demand a respect for human rights. So perhaps that is what some viewers are picking up on. She is sweet and feminine and gains her man's respect so he naturally seeks her out as his equal. It IS about love!Love gives you wings so you can fly to the place you want to be. It is a decision of the heart, which should be considered with the intellect as well. Yes, some things are meant to be. You must see this movie! It is one of the most beautiful romantic comedies I have ever seen....twice in one night! The exquisite costumes and scenery are only the backdrop for sheer magic.Directors should take note of Andy Tennant's directing and I hope they will realize that with almost 700 reviews, a movie with this spirit is what we viewers love! Humor, romance, adventure, passion...this has it all. Escape for a few hours into the magical world only Cinderella can show you. I will be watching this movie many, many times. It deals with deeper issues and shows how people fall in love, the realistic way with magical results.No pumpkin or singing required ;>. If you enjoy Fairy Tales, I also reviewed the ""Illustrated Book of Fairy Tales by Neil Philip. Nilesh Mistry has also illustrated the book to perfection. Cinderella is included in this world of tales. You might also enjoy ""The Illustrated Book of Myths."" Neil Philip has a Ph.D. in myth and folklore and has a great talent for giving insight into the cultural background of each story. Many stories have changed over time, yet they still hold true to the basic premise that evil is punished and good is rewarded. Fairy tales are filled with magic and wonder. They do in fact cast a spell on the reader.Secretly, I think adults enjoy these stories just as much as children do. I love the ""book"" aspect in this movie. It is just delicious! This is now my favorite Cinderella story.

Needless to say, she is not in my top-5 favorite actress list. However, my thoughts were changed forever when I was bored one day and rented the DVD. This movie is even better than the original fairy tale told to us as impressionable kids. First off, its good that they went and told it as ""the actual events"" and not the same Grimm brothers load of crap that just disappoints cause you later learn there is no fairy godmother out there or magic pumpkins. Drew Barrymore's Cinderella is anything but a ditzy blonde who sings with mice and having vapid dreams of wishes coming true. THIS Cinderella actually has a mind... and uses it, too, even in the face of the prince, whose renowned charm is replaced with a rebelliousness and refusal of running a country. THIS Cinderella is way better... I especially like the fact that the role wasn't given to some unrealistically drop-dead gorgeous gal as Hollywood likes to do. Barrymore is beautiful in her own way, but not so much that it blinds us from her very well-rounded personality. The whole cast does a good job, the quarrels between Danielle and Henry are irrestible, but Barrymore's acting comes out on top here. My only beef is perhaps the narrator, Danielle's aging great-great-granddaughter, her voice is just so grating and painful to endure.

When Danielle's father dies, the Baroness turns Danielle into a servant to wait on her and her spoiled daughters.Danielle accidently meets young Prince Henry (Dougray Scott) when the Prince pilfers a horse from their manor in order to escape his parents restrictions.  For her silence, he gives her coins, which she uses to pose as a courtier to buy back their old servant the Baroness sold to pay her taxes.She meets Prince Henry again, but this time posed as a Lady, and Henry finds himself enchanted not simply by her beauty but by her intelligence and spirit.  He becomes determined to know more about her, but first must find her for she keeps slipping away from him.  In the meantime, Marguerite has set her sights on the handsome prince, with the help of her mother and a michevious courtier.I won't give away any more of the movie, but absolutely must mention that there is a great deal of humor in this unique telling of the Cinderella story (take special note of the wedding chapel scene with the Spanish Princess).  The acting is supurb and the script very tight and well written, the costumes are stunning, the scenery is breathtaking, and the photography brilliant.Overall, this is a wonderful movie that softened even my cold, hard heart, allowing it to pump warm blood if only for the length of the movie.  This is a love story without sappiness, a handsome hero with faults of his own, and a beautiful heroine who knows how to save herself.

It took the classic story 'Cinderella,' and not only improved greatly on it, but left it within the boundaries of plausibility. The scenery is either gentle or spectacular at times, but always great! Barrymore is a well developed character. Her love for her father is made clear; she does her work as a servant with dignity; later she takes a dare to help a servant she cares about; when she falls in love, she dares to break a few rules; and she even falls into deep sorrow as well as deep rages at times. Most of the secondary characters are well handled. Henry is wonderful as a prince who develops humanly and morally. His parents are also handled well. They are disturbed by his growing desire for independence; they have clever one liners; ('I shall deny you the crown and live forever.'); they prove flexible as parents; they are given the pleasure of seeing parents stranger than they;  and they rise to prove heroes in the end! Leonardo Da Vinci is handled not only greatly, but humanly as well. In a work of fiction, it can be a charming bonus to throw in some characters who really did exist. Leonardo's character not only makes demands on our admiration, but he also reveals to us he is human. (A certain term used in a conversation with Prince Henry will tell us that!) The 'Cinderella' basis was heavily improved upon. One stepsister is bad, but the other is good. The good stepsister is memorable. She is very gentle; she shows herself to be virtuous; and she helps rise to give us a happy ending. My only complaint about this whole movie is that the wicked stepmother and stepsister are not as well handled as they could have been. They are quite repulsive throughout the movie. Also, there is nothing redeeming in them that allows us to see them as human. Charles Dickens was usually careful not to do this. He either put enough redeeming qualities in his villains so we could see them as human (Alfred Jingle, Fagin, Bradley Headstone), or he used so much energy in making them so wicked and evil, that they were more fascinating than repulsive (Daniel Quilp, John Chester, Uriah Heep).

(or godfather, I guess...)2) The heroine can actually hold her own against dangerous people and rescue the prince when he needs rescuing (in what is one of the movie's funniest moments).  Also, she's intelligent, and it shows.  She and the prince have real conversations about interesting topics (not like the empty chatter that's common in other romances).  And though the prince is quite an endearing guy, smart and sensitive (if not a little moody), it's the heroine who teaches him true strength of character.3) Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the wicked stepmother.

Danielle De Barbarac (Drew Barrymore) is our heroine. She is a child of eight years when her father tragically dies, leaving her with her stepmother the Baroness, (Anjelica Huston) and two stepsisters, Marguerite and Jacqueline. Danielle becomes a servant, although unlike in most of these tales, she has other servants to help her, and has a close bond with them. Danielle craves her stepmother's love, but is no lilly-hearted maiden. This gal is more like a rose. Soft and beautiful, but watch out boys, she knows how to use those thorns. After her father dies, it's ten years before a new man enters her life. The prince, of course.Another difference in the story is one of the stepsisters, Jacqueline. Instead of being part of the problem, she offers kindness and basic courtesy to Danielle, and although she's not in any real position to help her step-sister, you can tell it helps. It's a refreshing change, and one get's the feeling that they'll grow to be great friends.Long story short, in the midst of Danielle's daily life, she meets and falls in love with the prince, Henry, and he returns the sentiment, but one little hitch. He thinks she's a woman of nobility, and she falls further and further into the hole of deception as the relationship evolves.(Dougray Scott is our hero.) This lie later causes problems, and makes a temporary mess of everything.If you want to know more, see the movie. Everyone delievers a worthy performance but Drew Berrymore and Ms. Huston really knock it out of the ballpark. The Baroness is no one-domensial character. She's cruel occassionally, cold often, but there is one scene where Danielle is brushing her hair where you catch a glimpse of vulneribility from Danielle's stepmother, and how circumstances might have shaped her into what she has become. Danielle's character is just extradionary. She is fiery and passionate, but idealistic and kind at the same time. She's all you could ever want in a heroine. Also, she doesn't try to be the most beautiful woman. Her bratty stepsister is more physically beautiful, but is hallow inside, and it shows.As for the romance between Danielle and the prince, the chemisty wasn't the best in the world, but the actors do the best they can, and in the end, satisfy. The script is a little modern at times, but not enough to be actually annoying. There isn't enough to actually complain about, and I reccomend this for anybody. Guys might not be crazy about the story, but will probably be happy to gawk at Drew Berrymore, and might enjoy the swordfight.

The dialogue has enough grace to keep anglophiles glued, there's even a wanton skein of humour that makes it all more pleasant than your average garden-variety Cinderella narrative. The roundabout love story is beautifully developed, earning full marks for the screenplay. The visuals of nature, palaces, horse chases etc are stunning, and the costumes full-bodied and colorful. The background score, while not remarkable, makes for an excellent prop.That is in itself a creamy cake, but the film wouldn't be quite the dessert it is, had it not been for some icing in the form of delicious acting all round.I'm not a raving fan of Barrymore but her Danielle is thoroughly likable, sweet without being cloying, confident without being overly theatrical. Dougray Scott does his job as the Prince, but I could see why his character likes Danielle much more than she likes him.

She is a gutsy, tough, clever and intelligent character who is still a sensitive girl because of her experiences in life.Dougray Scott as the Prince performs his role of childish spoilt rich brat who grows in his love(for Danielle as well as in maturity) with aplomb.

It's one of the sweetest stories ever made, a great adaption of the Cinderella story.Danielle de Barbourac, after the death of her father, grows up as a servant girl under her stepmother and two stepsisters (one of which is not so bad). She is a girl with a strong will and a stronger throwing arm, as she flings apples at the runaway prince as he speeds away on her family's horse. He is thrown off the animal by her strikes...Danielle realizes its the prince, and so the story truly begins.Prince Henry dreads having an arranged marriage to the Princess of Spain and has ran away many times. He is in many respects, still a young boy. After this episode, the King informs him that he will have until the masked ball to choose his own wife, or else the arrangement with Spain holds.Henry sees Danielle again as she dresses up like a courtier to save one of the servants that her stepmother has sold into slavery. She looks familiar, but Henry can't recall. He is intrigued by this spitfire of a girl and Danielle leaves him with the name Countess Nicole de Lancre.The romance evolves through several forbidden &quot;dates&quot; with Leonardo da Vinci as the &quot;fairy godfather&quot;. Meanwhile, Baroness de Ghent (the stepmother) and Marguerite (evil stepsister) has had their eyes on the Prince ever since they received news that he will be able to choose his own bride.I will not ruin the climax of the movie as it is the best part of the film. But needless to say, they lived happily ever after. It's a wonderfully enchanting film and Drew Barrymore couldn't be more perfect for the role. This movie also has many great quotes full of wit, humor, and love. It will touch your heart and I couldn't recommend this film more. It's a must-see and a must-buy!The score by George Fenton is also powerful, touching, and magical. I recommend the soundtrack for all lovers of the movie as well as classical music.",5,10 stars!!,1068336000,"11 9, 2003",2003,1987,"['absolutely', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'have', 'honestly', 'watched', 'least', '10', 'times', 'one', 'sweetest', 'stories', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'adaption', 'Cinderella', 'story.Danielle', 'de', 'Barbourac', 'death', 'father', 'up', 'servant', 'girl', 'stepmother', 'two', 'stepsisters', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'girl', 'strong', 'will', 'stronger', 'throwing', 'arm', 'apples', 'runaway', 'prince', 'away', 'family', 'horse', 'thrown', 'off', 'animal', 'strikes', 'Danielle', 'prince', 'so', 'story', 'truly', 'begins.Prince', 'Henry', 'having', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Princess', 'Spain', 'ran', 'away', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'respects', 'still', 'young', 'boy', 'episode', 'King', 'will', 'have', 'masked', 'ball', 'choose', 'own', 'wife', 'else', 'arrangement', 'Spain', 'holds.Henry', 'sees', 'Danielle', 'again', 'up', 'courtier', 'save', 'one', 'servants', 'stepmother', 'sold', 'slavery', 'familiar', 'Henry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'intrigued', 'spitfire', 'girl', 'Danielle', 'name', 'Countess', 'Nicole', 'Lancre.The', 'romance', 'several', 'forbidden', 'quot', 'quot', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'quot', 'godfather', 'quot', 'Meanwhile', 'Baroness', 'de', 'Ghent', 'stepmother', 'Marguerite', 'evil', 'stepsister', 'had', 'eyes', 'Prince', 'ever', 'received', 'news', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'choose', 'own', 'bride.I', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'climax', 'movie', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'needless', 'say', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'wonderfully', 'enchanting', 'film', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'perfect', 'role', 'movie', 'also', 'many', 'great', 'quotes', 'full', 'wit', 'humor', 'love', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'could', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'more', 'must-see', 'must-buy', 'score', 'George', 'Fenton', 'also', 'powerful', 'touching', 'magical', 'recommend', 'soundtrack', 'lovers', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'classical', 'music']",N/A

If you are a sentimental sort, it is advisable to keep a few tissues handy.  That's what this is, a sentimental movie.  I am not a fan of the overly sentimental, mushy love story movies that are termed ""chick flicks"".  Yet this is one of my faviorite movies.Watching this movie is like falling in love, not so much with the handsome prince that courts Danielle, whom he does not know to be a commoner, or even with Danielle herself, though she is an admirable enough character, and in my opinion very well portrayed by Drew Barrymore.  No, what really got me about this movie was the way it combined the hard facts of reality with the romance of a fairy tale, and all in an age that is a step back from today.The movie makes a point of showing the soot on Danielle's hands from the hard labor she endures, the calusses left there.  She does not wake up in the morning and look pretty.  But when she means to, she can borrow her stepmother's clothes and look lovely.  I'm glad they did not cast some overly glamorous actress for this film.  Drew Barrymore is pretty, but not nearly as glamourous as the actress that plays Marguerite, Danielle's wicked stepsister.  Yet there are moments in the film when something truly seems to be shining out of Barrymore's eyes that makes her the most beautiful woman in the room.  In particular, the ball scene at the climax of the movie.There's the appearance of Leonardo Da Vinci, which, while i'm not sure is entirely historically correct, adds another dimension of magic to the film.  He is the man who walks on water and builds kites, and, when the time comes, he serves the wonderful role as fairy-godfather to Danielle.  'A bird may love a fish, but where would they live?', Danielle says to him of her love for Prince Henry.  'Well, I shall have to make you wings' he replies.  And he does.The movie is filled with articulae, well voiced lines like that, in front of settings that really bring you there, and beautiful music played with such perfect timing that, if you haven't already been, will sweep you away.",5,Just Breathe,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",2004,2152,"['watch', 'movie', 'take', 'deep', 'breath', 'prepare', 'be', 'pulled', 'poetry', 'are', 'sentimental', 'sort', 'advisable', 'keep', 'few', 'tissues', 'handy', 'what', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'mushy', 'love', 'story', 'movies', 'are', 'termed', 'chick', 'flicks', 'one', 'faviorite', 'movies.Watching', 'movie', 'falling', 'love', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'handsome', 'prince', 'Danielle', 'whom', 'not', 'know', 'be', 'commoner', 'even', 'Danielle', 'admirable', 'enough', 'character', 'opinion', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'No', 'what', 'really', 'got', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'combined', 'hard', 'facts', 'reality', 'romance', 'fairy', 'tale', 'age', 'step', 'back', 'today.The', 'movie', 'point', 'showing', 'soot', 'Danielle', 'hands', 'hard', 'labor', 'calusses', 'left', 'there', 'not', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'look', 'pretty', 'when', 'can', 'borrow', 'stepmother', 'clothes', 'look', 'lovely', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'cast', 'overly', 'glamorous', 'actress', 'film', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'pretty', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'glamourous', 'actress', 'Marguerite', 'Danielle', 'wicked', 'stepsister', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'something', 'truly', 'be', 'shining', 'Barrymore', 'eyes', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'room', 'particular', 'ball', 'scene', 'climax', 'movie.There', 'appearance', 'Leonardo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'entirely', 'historically', 'correct', 'dimension', 'magic', 'film', 'man', 'who', 'water', 'builds', 'kites', 'when', 'time', 'wonderful', 'role', 'fairy-godfather', 'Danielle', 'bird', 'may', 'love', 'fish', 'where', 'would', 'live', 'Danielle', 'love', 'Prince', 'Henry', ""'Well"", 'shall', 'have', 'make', 'wings', 'movie', 'filled', 'articulae', 'well', 'voiced', 'lines', 'front', 'settings', 'really', 'bring', 'there', 'beautiful', 'music', 'played', 'such', 'perfect', 'timing', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'will', 'sweep', 'away']",N/A

My mom and I were sitting watching one of her ladies' channels (Oxygen or CO2 or some such silliness), and I remarked how much the story was like Cinderella. (We had missed the beginning, when the narrator, a female descendant of Cinderella's, explained to the Brothers Grimm that this was the real story behind their fairy tale.) Well, it was delightful. It had humor, adventure, romance, villainy, gorgeous sets and costumes, a top-notch cast - pretty much everything. If it hadn't been for Shakespeare In Love and Saving Private Ryan dominating the Oscars in 1999, Ever After probably would have taken some of the statuettes for cinematography, art direction, sets and costumes.Nevertheless, it's two stars, Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston, did win awards for their acting (not at the Oscars, but at other award ceremonies), which were well deserved because both women are terrific. Ms. Barrymore is the perfect Cinderella (Disney's 1950 animated version notwithstanding), although in this tale she is known as Danielle. And Ms. Huston (The Royal Tenenbaums, Mists Of Avalon) is perfectly mean, in a delectable sort of way, as the step mother. As with the Brothers Grimm version, there is no fairy godmother in the story; but there is Leonardo da Vinci, who, in my opinion, serves a much better purpose: he provides magic without it being unbelievable, and it is Patrick Godfrey (The Count Of Monte Cristo) who does the honors. I mean, pumpkins turning into coaches and mice becoming footmen? What was Charles Perrault, the 18th Century inventor of those fantastic elements, thinking?!Prince Henry, who is smitten by and then pursues Cinderella, is played by newcomer Dougray Scott. (He later starred in Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde and The Ten Commandments.) Scott does an admirable job balancing swashbuckling tendencies with boredom. It is his boredom that Cinderella challenges. She can't believe how complacent he is, considering how much responsibility he will have as the future king of France; and he can't get over how passionate, committed and alive she is. Writers Susannah Grant, Andy Tennant and Rich Parks have done something at which most modern screenwriters fail miserably: they've given us a compelling story about characters that are full of wit and charm, whom we honestly care about, and whose fortunes are in the balance until the very end.Like most classic fairy tales, Cinderella contains a timeless lesson that we never tire of hearing: that virtue wins over circumstances. Even though Cinderella is persecuted by her step mother and one of her step sisters, she overcomes this through perseverance, her concern for other people and her love of life and living. I like this version of the tale far better than Perrault's, which uses magic to rescue Cinderella, and is therefore difficult to relate to real life; and that of the Brothers Grimm, which contains some very grim elements indeed (like the step sisters cutting off parts of their feet in order to fit them into the glass slipper, and birds pecking out their eyes), making it equally unbelievable.Cinderella has been made into countless stage and screen productions, including the 1957 Rogers and Hammerstein TV musical starring Julie Andrews; the 1965 TV musical starring Lesley Ann Warren; and Stephen Sondheim's 1987 stage musical, Into The Woods, starring Bernadette Peters (based on the Grimm version and encompassing other fairy tales as well) - not to mention all the operas and ballets. But this latest version is, in my opinion, one of the best.The director of Ever After, Andy Tennant, has done a remarkable job weaving all the fascinating elements of both story and production together. Even more remarkable is the fact that most of his work has been for television, and this does have a certain made-for-television feel to it. But not only is it far, far better than most made-for-television movies, it out-shines most theatrical films. As a comparison, I think most viewers will find it to be at least one star better than Princess Bride, a film that is similar only in its storybook nature. I actually found myself reminded of First Knight more than any other film; although, again, this one is far better. For a good story that will capture your imagination and heart, and which the whole family can enjoy, Ever After is a charmer.Waitsel Smith",5,A PERFECT TALE,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",2009,4458,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'one', 'ever', 'got', 'past', 'radar', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'discovered', 'was', 'quite', 'accident', 'mom', 'were', 'sitting', 'watching', 'one', 'ladies', 'channels', 'Oxygen', 'CO2', 'such', 'silliness', 'remarked', 'how', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'Cinderella', 'had', 'missed', 'beginning', 'when', 'narrator', 'female', 'descendant', 'Cinderella', 'explained', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'was', 'real', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Well', 'was', 'delightful', 'had', 'humor', 'adventure', 'romance', 'villainy', 'gorgeous', 'sets', 'costumes', 'top-notch', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Shakespeare', 'Love', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'dominating', 'Oscars', '1999', 'Ever', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'statuettes', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'costumes.Nevertheless', 'two', 'stars', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'did', 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'not', 'Oscars', 'other', 'award', 'ceremonies', 'were', 'well', 'deserved', 'women', 'are', 'terrific', 'Ms.', 'Barrymore', 'perfect', 'Cinderella', 'Disney', '1950', 'animated', 'version', 'notwithstanding', 'tale', 'known', 'Danielle', 'Ms.', 'Huston', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Mists', 'Avalon', 'perfectly', 'mean', 'delectable', 'sort', 'way', 'step', 'mother', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'version', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'story', 'Leonardo', 'da', 'Vinci', 'who', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', 'purpose', 'magic', 'being', 'unbelievable', 'Patrick', 'Godfrey', 'Count', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'who', 'honors', 'mean', 'turning', 'coaches', 'mice', 'becoming', 'footmen', 'What', 'was', 'Charles', 'Perrault', '18th', 'Century', 'inventor', 'fantastic', 'elements', 'thinking', 'Prince', 'Henry', 'who', 'smitten', 'then', 'pursues', 'Cinderella', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'later', 'starred', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'Scott', 'admirable', 'job', 'balancing', 'swashbuckling', 'tendencies', 'boredom', 'boredom', 'Cinderella', 'challenges', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'complacent', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'responsibility', 'will', 'have', 'future', 'king', 'France', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'passionate', 'committed', 'alive', 'Writers', 'Susannah', 'Grant', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'Rich', 'Parks', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'most', 'modern', 'screenwriters', 'fail', 'miserably', ""'ve"", 'given', 'compelling', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'full', 'wit', 'charm', 'whom', 'honestly', 'care', 'fortunes', 'are', 'balance', 'very', 'end.Like', 'most', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Cinderella', 'timeless', 'lesson', 'never', 'tire', 'hearing', 'virtue', 'over', 'circumstances', 'Even', 'Cinderella', 'persecuted', 'step', 'mother', 'one', 'step', 'sisters', 'perseverance', 'concern', 'other', 'people', 'love', 'life', 'living', 'version', 'tale', 'far', 'better', 'Perrault', 'magic', 'rescue', 'Cinderella', 'therefore', 'difficult', 'relate', 'real', 'life', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'very', 'grim', 'elements', 'indeed', 'step', 'sisters', 'cutting', 'off', 'parts', 'feet', 'order', 'fit', 'glass', 'slipper', 'birds', 'pecking', 'out', 'eyes', 'making', 'equally', 'unbelievable.Cinderella', 'been', 'made', 'countless', 'stage', 'screen', 'productions', 'including', '1957', 'Rogers', 'Hammerstein', 'TV', 'musical', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', '1965', 'TV', 'musical', 'starring', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', '1987', 'stage', 'musical', 'Into', 'Woods', 'starring', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'based', 'Grimm', 'version', 'encompassing', 'other', 'fairy', 'tales', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'mention', 'operas', 'ballets', 'latest', 'version', 'opinion', 'one', 'best.The', 'director', 'Ever', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'weaving', 'fascinating', 'elements', 'story', 'production', 'together', 'Even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'most', 'work', 'been', 'television', 'have', 'certain', 'made-for-television', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'made-for-television', 'movies', 'most', 'theatrical', 'films', 'comparison', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'least', 'one', 'star', 'better', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'film', 'similar', 'only', 'storybook', 'nature', 'actually', 'found', 'reminded', 'First', 'Knight', 'more', 'other', 'film', 'again', 'one', 'far', 'better', 'good', 'story', 'will', 'capture', 'imagination', 'heart', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Ever', 'charmer.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

Dozens of variations exist, but nearly all stay close to the basics: poor but hardworking girl, cruel step-family, and a magical boost into the prince's affections. This time, however, we skip the magic and see a lot of hard work on Cinderella's part, plus a little righteous collusion by the housekeepers still loyal to her and her late father. I like that - instead of magic, we see intelligence and determination; instead of a magical fairy godmother, we're treated to larcenous devotion by the staff that she has treated honorably. The conclusion means that much more when it comes from personal strength (and a strong throwing arm) rather than an effortless wave of a wand.Huston does her usual spectacular job as wicked stepmother, and Megan Dodds does beautifully as the stepsister you love to hate. Barrymore really makes this movie, though, with just the rightCharlie's Angeledge to the dutiful daughter. Not every movie can be one for the ages, though.

You never get hooked in with a plot, if you can even find out the plot.  The acting is done horriblly.  The directing is also  horrible.  There is nothing right with this movie except the fact that Drew  Barrymore is in it.  Even she's horrible in this movie.  Go see a good  movie with her in it like The Wedding Singer.  Skip this movie, but if you  must, rent it first.

This film portrayed Cinderella (Drew Barrymore) in such a way that you cannot help but fall in love with the story.You get to meet the prince, Cinderella's best friend, The &quot;Fairy Godmother&quot; (Leonardo DaVinci - which was charming beyond belief) and her step-sisters. They are all cast in quite a different light and it draws you right in.  The costuming and acting were quite superb.
