In all honestly, it took me a little while to get into this movie but by the end, I definitely had a lot of respect for it. Lovecraft is a tough one to adapt and this is a difficult story because it has no action and is very much driven by narrative. And that&#8217;s the beauty of this movie, it felt like a book. Outside of dialogue, the movie is narrated by the lead, giving it that first person feel. Now, this is a low budget movie and the acting is not very good, and with a narrative movie like this, it does really need to be. That said, it wasn&#8217;t that bad and didn&#8217;t kill it for me. The pace finds itself pretty quickly and becomes quite engaging, due in large part to the shroud of mystery placed around the renter. If you&#8217;ve read the story, you already know, but they still did a good job. The adaptation featured in the H.P. Lovecraft Collection released by Lurker Films does a better job but this one is still pretty comparable. Dark, dreary, slightly amateur, but satisfying overall.3.5/5",4,Cool Air,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,1139,"['man', 'room', 'curious', 'renter', 'house', 'who', 'keep', 'room', 'incredibly', 'cold', 'honestly', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'get', 'movie', 'end', 'definitely', 'had', 'lot', 'respect', 'Lovecraft', 'tough', 'one', 'adapt', 'difficult', 'story', 'action', 'very', 'much', 'driven', 'narrative', '8217', 's', 'beauty', 'movie', 'felt', 'book', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'narrated', 'lead', 'giving', 'first', 'person', 'feel', 'Now', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'acting', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'narrative', 'movie', 'really', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'wasn', '8217', 'bad', 'didn', '8217', 'kill', 'pace', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'quite', 'engaging', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'shroud', 'mystery', 'placed', 'renter', '8217', 'read', 'story', 'already', 'know', 'still', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'adaptation', 'featured', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Collection', 'released', 'Lurker', 'Films', 'better', 'job', 'one', 'still', 'pretty', 'comparable', 'Dark', 'dreary', 'slightly', 'amateur', 'satisfying', 'overall.3.5/5']",Cool Air

One tenant is a mysterious doctor who nobody ever sees but the main character can hear the sound of an air conditioner running full-blast inside the room.  Cool Air features virtually non-stop voice-over narration from the main character.  Besides the fact that the writing itself is generally pretty bad (it's not hard to see why this guy is a failed writer), the movie ends up feeling like a books on tape with accompanying visuals rather than a real movie--everything just feels too static and narration bound.  Cool Air is slow and deadly dull, with weak acting and much worse writing.  Director Albert Pyun, who is mainly known for action films like Cyborg and Nemesis has had an up and down career, but this one definitely won't be listed among his highlights.",1,Stay away,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",2013,857,"['failed', 'Hollywood', 'screen', 'writer', 'mansion', 'turned', 'boarding', 'house', 'hills', 'One', 'tenant', 'mysterious', 'doctor', 'who', 'nobody', 'ever', 'sees', 'main', 'character', 'can', 'hear', 'sound', 'air', 'conditioner', 'running', 'full-blast', 'room', 'Cool', 'Air', 'virtually', 'non-stop', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'main', 'character', 'fact', 'writing', 'generally', 'pretty', 'bad', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'guy', 'failed', 'writer', 'movie', 'up', 'feeling', 'books', 'tape', 'accompanying', 'visuals', 'rather', 'real', 'movie', 'everything', 'just', 'feels', 'too', 'static', 'narration', 'bound', 'Cool', 'Air', 'slow', 'deadly', 'dull', 'weak', 'acting', 'much', 'worse', 'writing', 'Director', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'who', 'mainly', 'known', 'action', 'films', 'Cyborg', 'Nemesis', 'had', 'up', 'down', 'career', 'one', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'listed', 'highlights']",Cool Air
1635346,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00BLF9FZO,Matthew Scott Baker,"[4, 5]","As I've mentioned numerous times in the past, I absolutely love Lovecraft's work.  The man was a genius far beyond his time.  But what you might not know is that I'm a big fan of director Albert Pyun's work as well.  I've liked his films since the 80s, and he just keeps getting better over the years.  So imagine my surprise when I discovered he had tackled one of Lovecraft's short stories!  I didn't realize he was the man behind this film until the credits started rolling.  But Pyun does Lovecraft great justice with this adaptation; it is a low-budget but well made feature that Lovecraft fans should enjoy.The story for this film may sound simple, and in reality, it is; but the complexities involved with the characters extend much deeper than the plot synopsis can relay.  As a result, this movie is actually more character-driven than anything, but that is certainly not a bad thing.  If anything, it helps add to the tension.H.P. LOVECRAFT'S COOL AIR is written very well, thanks to the fascinating pen of Cynthia Curnan.  The inner dialogue that we get to hear from the main character, Charlie Baxter, is insightful and somewhat prophetic.  It is this dialogue that helps to set the stage for what is to come, and it is also what helps us understand who Charlie really is.And speaking of the main character, Baxter is portrayed by one of my favorite (albeit obscure) actors, Morgan Weisser.  Weisser is probably best known for his stint on the short lived and untimely canceled TV show SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, but his scope of work varies and covers a broad range of genres.  Weisser is excellent in this role and I am glad to see him onscreen once again.My sole complaint about H.P. LOVECRAFT'S COOL AIR is that there minimal special effects, and those we get to see are not very well done.  They are CG effects, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but some of them are misplaced (for example, they are on an actor's face and when she moves, they don't).  This is a minor complaint, as I know the film had a small budget, but it is definitely noteworthy.Still, H.P. LOVECRAFT'S COOL AIR is a win for me and I recommend giving it a look.  Director Albert Pyun still entertains me on many levels, and I always look forward to seeing what he'll do next.  Give this film a chance, and I think you'll be pleased.  The DVD hits store shelves tomorrow.*I received an advance review copy of this film; I am in no way being compensated for my review.",4,A Solid Adaptation of an H.P.

1635347,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00BLF9FZO,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","The film is about 70 minutes long with an additional 7 minutes of end credits. It is based on an H.P. Lovecraft book which immediately put it on my must see list. I was very disappointed. The film starts out with a blurb about the Weret Hekau, a story which stays on the screen too long so as to add time to the production.The film opens, ends, and is filled with first person narration by Charles Baxter (Morgan Weisser) a wannabe screen writer with writer's block. He is renting a room in a secluded house which includes two other guests who live private lives, the most intriguing is Dr. Shockner (Crystal Laws Green) who lives in a cool room in the upstairs, even though basements are easier to keep cool.The narration was a boring monotone which caused me to nod off from time to time. Cynthia Curnan took an interesting book and shredded it. No horror or suspense. No intensity. The initial meeting of Baxter and Shockner was equally long and boring as we see a prolonged picture of his face while we hear their monotone voices. Jenny Dare Paulin provides the token eye candy as Estella, a slightly autistic woman.The low budget aspect didn't allow for much more than someone telling a story. This apparently is a 2006 film re-released.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1635348,A2EHSKFTQHJM0E,B00BLF9FZO,"The Music Man ""If I Cannot Fly, Let Me Sing""","[2, 3]","Having seen several extremely well-done independent film adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft's work over the last few years (seeThe Color Out Of Space,Call of Cthulhu, TheandWhisperer in Darkness, I had high hopes for this full-length feature of one of Lovecraft's best short stories, ""Cool Air"" - but almost from the first moments, I could tell that the creators of this film had no idea how to tell a properly-paced story, or much know much about the importance of location, casting, or creating suspense.  Although I imagine that it's possible to transport Lovecraft's early 20th Century pulp writings to a modern-day setting, putting the action in Malibu, California is a mistake - everything's too sunny and bright; Lovecraft's stories cry out for shadows and Noir-like settings.  The director's wife adapted the story, and she relies FAR too much on pre-title exposition and voice-overs (which is not helped by the droning, emotionless voice of lead actor Morgan Weisser, best known for his role on the short-livedSpace Above and Beyond - The Complete Series), but she also adds loopy, unlikable new characters, as if she were trying to marry Lovecraft with a storyline ripped from Twin Peaks.  The director, not knowing how to build suspense, instead relies almost entirely on ""gotcha"" moments and lame video effects (including repeated images of a goat).  A waste of time and energy by all involved.  Lovecraft purists would do far better to stick withThe H.P.
