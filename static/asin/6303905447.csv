Previous versions were cut-rate low budget affairs that were missing over half the film's running time and were often presented without any kind of musical accompaniment. European silent films in particular have suffered in the U.S. where, because of the limited appeal and general unavailability of the material, any version was better than no version. While this is true to a certain extent it is also true that a great deal of harm was done as it gave most people the wrong impression of many of these silent classics by making them appear crude and primitive. Over the last decade that misconception is being corrected as quality releases from companies like Kino International and Milestone Films help to rectify the situation. Movies like METROPOLIS and NOSFERATU, to cite two well known titles, can be seen more or less the way they were intended. Such is now the case with GOSTA BERLING which turns out to be a monumental epic on par with films like BIRTH OF A NATION and NAPOLEON.The storyline, as has been noted before, is like a Swedish version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Contrary to the way the film is advertised, it is not a vehicle for Greta Garbo. Her part is important and it got her noticed but she is only one of several characters who inhabit this large scale canvas. At 184 minutes GOSTA is very long and at times hard to follow because of the numerous storylines but if you stick with it you'll find yourself inevitably drawn in and the last third of the film is a powerful emotional ride that is almost impossible to turn away from. Bravos to the Swedish Film Institute for the restoration work which is truly remarkable and to Kino International for making this masterwork available the way it was meant to be seen.Special mention should be made of the outstanding new score by Matti Bye that accompanies the film. It enhances the various moods of the many characters and keeps you drawn to the story as it unfolds. Sweden was one of the major players during the silent era and GOSTA BERLING would mark the zenith of Swedish cinema for nearly 30 years as most of the talent involved with the film would migrate to Hollywood where superstardom awaited Garbo, several good parts awaited Lars Hanson, and the end of his career awaited director Mauritz Stiller who would die in 1928 after returning to Sweden. This is part of a three film tribute along with SIR ARNE'S TREASURE and the romantic comedy EROTIKON devoted to the great but forgotten Swedish director. It's a must have for any silent film aficionado or for anyone who loves an epic romance. Think of it as a silent film treatment of GONE WITH THE WIND or DOCTOR ZHIVAGO.",5,Sweden's Great Silent Epic As It Was Meant To Be Seen..,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2737,"['SAGA', 'OF', 'GOSTA', 'BERLING', 'been', 'available', 'VHS', 'many', 'years', 'never', 'Previous', 'versions', 'were', 'cut-rate', 'low', 'budget', 'affairs', 'were', 'missing', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'were', 'often', 'presented', 'kind', 'musical', 'accompaniment', 'European', 'silent', 'films', 'particular', 'have', 'suffered', 'U.S.', 'where', 'limited', 'appeal', 'general', 'unavailability', 'material', 'version', 'was', 'better', 'version', 'true', 'certain', 'extent', 'also', 'true', 'great', 'deal', 'harm', 'was', 'done', 'gave', 'most', 'people', 'wrong', 'impression', 'many', 'silent', 'classics', 'making', 'appear', 'crude', 'primitive', 'last', 'decade', 'misconception', 'being', 'corrected', 'quality', 'releases', 'companies', 'Kino', 'International', 'Milestone', 'Films', 'help', 'rectify', 'situation', 'Movies', 'METROPOLIS', 'NOSFERATU', 'cite', 'two', 'well', 'known', 'titles', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'less', 'way', 'were', 'intended', 'Such', 'now', 'case', 'GOSTA', 'BERLING', 'out', 'be', 'monumental', 'epic', 'par', 'films', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'NAPOLEON.The', 'storyline', 'been', 'noted', 'Swedish', 'version', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'Contrary', 'way', 'film', 'advertised', 'not', 'vehicle', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'part', 'important', 'got', 'noticed', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'characters', 'who', 'inhabit', 'large', 'scale', 'canvas', '184', 'minutes', 'GOSTA', 'very', 'long', 'times', 'hard', 'follow', 'numerous', 'storylines', 'stick', ""'ll"", 'find', 'inevitably', 'drawn', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'ride', 'almost', 'impossible', 'turn', 'away', 'Bravos', 'Swedish', 'Film', 'Institute', 'restoration', 'work', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Kino', 'International', 'making', 'masterwork', 'available', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen.Special', 'mention', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'outstanding', 'new', 'score', 'Matti', 'Bye', 'film', 'various', 'moods', 'many', 'characters', 'drawn', 'story', 'Sweden', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'players', 'silent', 'era', 'GOSTA', 'BERLING', 'would', 'mark', 'zenith', 'Swedish', 'cinema', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'most', 'talent', 'involved', 'film', 'would', 'migrate', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'superstardom', 'awaited', 'Garbo', 'several', 'good', 'parts', 'awaited', 'Lars', 'Hanson', 'end', 'career', 'awaited', 'director', 'Mauritz', 'Stiller', 'who', 'would', 'die', '1928', 'returning', 'Sweden', 'part', 'three', 'film', 'tribute', 'SIR', 'ARNE', 'TREASURE', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'EROTIKON', 'devoted', 'great', 'forgotten', 'Swedish', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'silent', 'film', 'aficionado', 'anyone', 'who', 'epic', 'romance', 'Think', 'silent', 'film', 'treatment', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'DOCTOR', 'ZHIVAGO']",N/A

387424,A15Z5ZUV6SYZTT,6303905447,Donald Roland,"[0, 0]","This film is well worth its reputation as a classic of silent Swedish cinema. It would be interesting to see the shortened versions, which usually run about 90 minutes, just to see if they are merely cut to maximize Garbo's screen time. Lars Hanson is more than convincing as the man whom no woman can resist, especially and rather fatally in the dress of a Spanish matador.  There are a few confusing moments in the plot for me regarding Garbo's character's origin, is she Italian or Swedish? What is the reason why the ultimately illegal wedding was in Italy if they are all really Swedish because the religious difference (Swedes Lutheran at this point, Italy Roman Catholic) makes it strange to me. Yet Garbo's character has a history with Hanson's (apparently he was her tutor), so I doubt that an Italian girl would be tutored by a defrocked Swedish Lutheran priest. That said, although we could live without a lot of the plot that goes on without Greta Garbo, she appears 35 minutes in for about 25 minutes then disappears until the last hour or so, that last hour however makes up for EVERYTHING!",5,"Greta Garbo and Lars Hanson, before John Gilbert",1392768000,"02 19, 2014",2014,1104,"['film', 'well', 'worth', 'reputation', 'classic', 'silent', 'Swedish', 'cinema', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'shortened', 'versions', 'usually', 'run', '90', 'minutes', 'just', 'see', 'are', 'merely', 'cut', 'maximize', 'Garbo', 'screen', 'time', 'Lars', 'Hanson', 'more', 'convincing', 'man', 'whom', 'woman', 'can', 'resist', 'especially', 'rather', 'fatally', 'dress', 'Spanish', 'matador', 'are', 'few', 'confusing', 'moments', 'plot', 'regarding', 'Garbo', 'character', 'origin', 'Italian', 'Swedish', 'What', 'reason', 'why', 'ultimately', 'illegal', 'wedding', 'was', 'Italy', 'are', 'really', 'Swedish', 'religious', 'difference', 'Swedes', 'Lutheran', 'point', 'Italy', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'strange', 'Garbo', 'character', 'history', 'Hanson', 'apparently', 'was', 'tutor', 'so', 'doubt', 'Italian', 'girl', 'would', 'be', 'tutored', 'defrocked', 'Swedish', 'Lutheran', 'priest', 'said', 'could', 'live', 'lot', 'plot', 'Greta', 'Garbo', '35', 'minutes', '25', 'minutes', 'then', 'last', 'hour', 'so', 'last', 'hour', 'however', 'up', 'EVERYTHING']",N/A
387425,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6303905447,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Based on an extremely popular novel by Selma Lagerlof, THE SAGA OF GOSTA BERLING was a high water mark of Swedish silent cinema, directed by Mauritz Stiller, starring Lars Hanson, and featuring a fairly new actress named Greta Garbo in a supporting role.  Released in 1924, it was a major cinema event, shown in two parts over two nights with a running time of about three hours.  In 1927, possibly in an effort to capitalize on Garbo's growing fame, the film was re-cut to about half its length; although the cuts were gradually restored, the cut version was the only version available to the home market until 2006, when the reliable KINO released the film in its original form.The story is convoluted.  Gosta Berling (Lars Hanson) begins a career as a preacher, but he soon collapses into drunkenness and is driven from his pulpit.  He is later hired by Martha Dohna (Ellen Hartman-Cederstr&ouml;m), the stepmother of heiress Ebba (Mona Martenson.)  Ebba cannot inherit the estate if she marries a commoner, and Martha hopes she will fall in love with Gosta and marry him, thereby making her own son Henrik (Torsten Hammaren) heir in Ebba's place.  The matter seems especially pressing to Martha because while in Italy Henrik has married a woman without a fortune: Elizabeth (Greta Garbo.)  It happens that Ebba does fall in love with Gosta; it also happens that Elizabeth previously knew Gosta and loves him as well.  When Gosta is exposed as a fallen preacher, Ebba withers and dies from the shock.  Elizabeth, although she still loves Gosta, is a faithful wife--until a strange turn of events set all the major characters on a collision course that will include smallpox, a great fire and a memorable escape from wolves by sled across the ice.  Ultimately, Gosta repents of his failures, and receives a grand award, while the less savory Dohna family is recognized as the worst white trash this side of Stockholm.It is said that when Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer saw the film he found it so powerful that he jumped at the chance to hire director Mauritz Stiller at a high salary; he also, somewhat grudingly, agreed to contract with Greta Garbo at a significantly smaller salary.  Ironically, Stiller was tempermentally unsuited to Hollywood and his career there was soon over; he quickly returned to Sweden, where he died a few years later.  Garbo, however, went on to become MGM's greatest star and would remain so through the 1920s and 1930s.Seen today, it is easy to see what impressed Mayer about the film.  THE SAGA OF GOSTA BERLING is quite unlike the glossy and often silly films made by Hollywood studios at the time, beautifully shot, perfectly played, and unexpectedly realistic in tone.  At the same time, it has not held up as well as you might think, for it seems excessively slow and perhaps half an hour too long.  The great attraction here is for Garbo fans, and indeed this is Garbo: she is still unpolished, but she is distinctly herself, from her facial expressions to her body language, and it is easy to see how ready she was to explode upon the international scene.  Recommended, but primarily for fans of silent cinema--and, of course, fans of Garbo.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,A Highwater Mark In Sweden's Silent Cinema,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,3209,"['Based', 'extremely', 'popular', 'novel', 'Selma', 'Lagerlof', 'THE', 'SAGA', 'OF', 'GOSTA', 'BERLING', 'was', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'Swedish', 'silent', 'cinema', 'directed', 'Mauritz', 'Stiller', 'starring', 'Lars', 'Hanson', 'featuring', 'fairly', 'new', 'actress', 'named', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'supporting', 'role', 'Released', '1924', 'was', 'major', 'cinema', 'event', 'shown', 'two', 'parts', 'two', 'nights', 'running', 'time', 'three', 'hours', '1927', 'possibly', 'effort', 'capitalize', 'Garbo', 'growing', 'fame', 'film', 'was', 're-cut', 'length', 'cuts', 'were', 'gradually', 'restored', 'cut', 'version', 'was', 'only', 'version', 'available', 'home', 'market', '2006', 'when', 'reliable', 'KINO', 'released', 'film', 'original', 'form.The', 'story', 'convoluted', 'Gosta', 'Berling', 'Lars', 'Hanson', 'career', 'preacher', 'soon', 'drunkenness', 'driven', 'pulpit', 'later', 'hired', 'Martha', 'Dohna', 'Ellen', 'Hartman-Cederstr', 'ouml', 'm', 'stepmother', 'heiress', 'Ebba', 'Mona', 'Martenson', 'Ebba', 'can', 'not', 'inherit', 'estate', 'commoner', 'Martha', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'Gosta', 'marry', 'thereby', 'making', 'own', 'son', 'Henrik', 'Torsten', 'Hammaren', 'heir', 'Ebba', 'place', 'matter', 'especially', 'pressing', 'Martha', 'Italy', 'Henrik', 'married', 'woman', 'fortune', 'Elizabeth', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Ebba', 'fall', 'love', 'Gosta', 'also', 'Elizabeth', 'previously', 'knew', 'Gosta', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'Gosta', 'exposed', 'fallen', 'preacher', 'Ebba', 'withers', 'dies', 'shock', 'Elizabeth', 'still', 'Gosta', 'faithful', 'wife', 'strange', 'turn', 'events', 'set', 'major', 'characters', 'collision', 'course', 'will', 'include', 'smallpox', 'great', 'fire', 'memorable', 'escape', 'wolves', 'sled', 'ice', 'Ultimately', 'Gosta', 'repents', 'failures', 'grand', 'award', 'less', 'savory', 'Dohna', 'family', 'recognized', 'worst', 'white', 'trash', 'side', 'Stockholm.It', 'said', 'when', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer', 'saw', 'film', 'found', 'so', 'powerful', 'jumped', 'chance', 'hire', 'director', 'Mauritz', 'Stiller', 'high', 'salary', 'also', 'somewhat', 'grudingly', 'agreed', 'contract', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'significantly', 'smaller', 'salary', 'Ironically', 'Stiller', 'was', 'tempermentally', 'unsuited', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'was', 'soon', 'quickly', 'returned', 'Sweden', 'where', 'died', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Garbo', 'however', 'went', 'become', 'MGM', 'greatest', 'star', 'would', 'remain', 'so', '1920s', '1930s.Seen', 'today', 'easy', 'see', 'what', 'impressed', 'Mayer', 'film', 'SAGA', 'OF', 'GOSTA', 'BERLING', 'quite', 'glossy', 'often', 'silly', 'films', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'studios', 'time', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'perfectly', 'played', 'unexpectedly', 'realistic', 'tone', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'held', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'might', 'think', 'excessively', 'slow', 'perhaps', 'hour', 'too', 'long', 'great', 'attraction', 'here', 'Garbo', 'fans', 'indeed', 'Garbo', 'still', 'unpolished', 'distinctly', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'ready', 'was', 'explode', 'international', 'scene', 'Recommended', 'primarily', 'fans', 'silent', 'cinema', 'course', 'fans', 'Garbo.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

True, when I discovered it was a silent film, I was disappointed, but I stuck with it and am very glad I did.I've never been a fan of old black and white, silent movies, even the highly acclaimed ones starring Charlie Chaplin.  They bore me to tears.  However, this one held my interest intently for three hours!  I intended to take a break after Part I and leave Part II for another sitting but I couldn't leave it alone.The acting style is exaggerated, as expected, especially on the part of Lars Hanson, as Berling.  But I soon got used to it, as well as the frequent written summaries of the action, which were well handled.  I was especially impressed by the very naturalistic acting of the players who carried on their actions and  conversations while we waited for the next text.And then there is Greta Garbo, in her first screen appearance!  Although she is not on screen for much of the time, when she is, you are mesmerized by her astounding beauty.  Whoa!Then there is the brilliant acting by a woman who is not named here, nor on the cover so I cannot credit her.  She plays Margaret the strong, beautiful, older woman who owns the manor house where Berling lands after his exile.  When she is on screen with Garbo, one looks at her, not Garbo, not for her beauty but for her magnificent presence.The cinematography is stunning, capturing the drama of winter in the north country.  People wear huge fur coats and ride in sleighs, which is quite enchanting.  There is a scene of Berling and Elisabeth (Garbo) in a sleigh racing across a frozen lake, chased by a pack of wolves, which is worth the price of the video!I am distressed by the poor reviews some folks have read here.  Some of them have reviewed another product which had no sound track.  This one has delightful music; it's unusual and I can't categorize it, but it fit the moods of the action very well.I hope that interested buyers/viewers take a serious look at this film, and ignore some of the more ignorant remarks.
