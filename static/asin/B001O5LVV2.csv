1222232,A11OTLEDSW8ZXD,B001O5LVV2,CGScammell,"[5, 5]","This documentary about a foiled attempt to steal Lincoln's body is a little-known blurp in our history.  The 1870s were a turbulent time in this country, as Reconstruction wrapped up yet hatred remained between North and South.Any fan of Lincoln would love this documentary because of the topic.  This documentary isn't so much about Lincoln's life retold yet again, but rather about his death and (afterlife) shown from a new perspective.  Who would think to imagine what it must have been like to transport his decaying body via railroad through the Midwest, as it slowly starts smelling the boxcar?  Or the process of embalming his body, a new science at the time?  This documentary is the last possible documentary one could have made without being redundant.I plopped this DVD in ""just to check it out"" and was glued to the screen from the start.  The graphics in this documentary, especially seeing Lincoln so life-like was like watching him get killed up-close all over again.  The assassination scene is quite gruesome as his body slumps to the lower left and toward Mary.  This is an eerie yet fascinating simulation of what Lincoln was like in his final days on earth, and the near absurd plot to steal his body.  I am still amazed anyone would think of robbing a grave for someone's bones.",5,Fascinating,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,1300,"['documentary', 'foiled', 'attempt', 'steal', 'Lincoln', 'body', 'little-known', 'blurp', 'history', '1870s', 'were', 'turbulent', 'time', 'country', 'Reconstruction', 'wrapped', 'up', 'yet', 'hatred', 'remained', 'North', 'South.Any', 'fan', 'Lincoln', 'would', 'love', 'documentary', 'topic', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'retold', 'yet', 'again', 'rather', 'death', 'afterlife', 'shown', 'new', 'perspective', 'Who', 'would', 'think', 'imagine', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'transport', 'decaying', 'body', 'railroad', 'Midwest', 'smelling', 'boxcar', 'process', 'embalming', 'body', 'new', 'science', 'time', 'documentary', 'last', 'possible', 'documentary', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'being', 'redundant.I', 'plopped', 'DVD', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'start', 'graphics', 'documentary', 'especially', 'seeing', 'Lincoln', 'life-like', 'was', 'watching', 'get', 'killed', 'up-close', 'over', 'again', 'assassination', 'scene', 'quite', 'gruesome', 'body', 'slumps', 'lower', 'left', 'Mary', 'eerie', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'simulation', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'final', 'days', 'earth', 'near', 'absurd', 'plot', 'steal', 'body', 'am', 'still', 'amazed', 'anyone', 'would', 'think', 'robbing', 'grave', 'someone', 'bones']",Stealing Lincoln's Body

As horrid as it was that President Lincoln was assassinated by a ruthless group who formed a conspiracy to get rid of the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State all in simultaneous assassinations. Their plan did not go exactly as expected. But even in their failure, they did kill Lincoln. Yet when the time to place Lincolm in a final resting place came, again ruthless and unlawful people sought to steal his body. Several times the body had to be moved to protect and provide some decorum of respect to this assassinated president. A very in depth look as the evil that can overtake some men's minds.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","STEALING LINCOLN'S BODY is a masterful documentary in a time when both topics and documentaries are swirling down the toilet.Here we are told the story of President Abraham Lincoln's corpse. Yes, there were scoundrels who tried to steal it for a ransom - a trick attempted with amazing regularity that was also tried on Charlie Chaplin, Elvis, etc.Although I find reenactment quite tiresome, this film does it with skill, balance and great effect. At certain moments I have the feeling I am with the creepy monsters who actually stole his body; when it was recovered, government agents hid it in some sort of weird basement-shed for security. For national security purposes, Lincoln stayed shoved in a hole for 70 years.The only other worthwhile video you can get at the moment is National Geographic'sLincoln: American Mastermind(see my review).

The narrative is richly detailed and informative and fascinating - there's so much, in fact, that the documentary couldn't encompass it all.Something not much remarked on by other reviewers here (at least that I could find) is how funny many parts of this documentary are. I think Lincoln himself would have laughed out loud at the humor.  The humor is aptly placed - it centers largely on the mind-bogglingly inept criminals at the heart of this story.  Example: one of the criminals specialized in counterfeiting...nickles?  Think Keystone Cops, and you'll have an idea.Of course, book and documentary alike are tender and touching when it comes to Lincoln and the people who loved him. The narrative is respectful of the history, and as noted by others here, the technology used to bring the story to life is interesting (but never overwhelms its purpose).This is one of our favorite documentaries on television, and every time it comes on, whatever the hour, we stop to watch it again...we're watching it right now, in fact, while I write this review.For anyone who thinks history is boring, this is the documentary that could change their mind.
