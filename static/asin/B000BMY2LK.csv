945142,A1IQVBGOYVEFBI,B000BMY2LK,Allan Brain,"[5, 7]","This is a wonderful movie, highly recommendableas one of those ""family"" films that peoplecomplain are no longer made,yet when they are, they don't seemto be too popular comparedto the inane (and decidedly not funny) comediesthat plague the market.It's set in Canada in the early'50s and the situation, with ayoung boy in Catholic school,having an earnest mentor and afascination with philosophy andtheology, is well developed, repletewith doubts and conflicts sharedby both. With all thepublicity about Catholic priestsand sex abuse, it's hard not tothink about that issue here,particularly with this film'srather explicit treatment ofadolescent sexuality.  I thinkthat's why the film got a PG-13rating--there is a scene wherethe kid clearly experiences sexualarousal while in a swimming pool.Yet even that scene is comicaland should not disturb any but themost puritanical and sexuallyrepressed.  I mean, if you thinkyour kid of 12 or thirteen doesnot know anything about masturbation,you should get some professional help.But with the PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned)rating, you'd think that there was some controversialfare here, and there's not.The film is about dedication, idealism,and faith.  It reminds me of""Billy Eliot"", another film that gota PG  rating that was unjustified,supposedly based on foul language,but probably based on its being""gay-friendly"" (Billy's boyhoodfriend is a cross-dresser, andBilly plants a kiss on him at onepoint; later on, the friendattends Billy's dance debutwith his boyfriend).There isn't anything like thatin this film, but its irreverenceand depiciton of teenagers' sexualityunfortunately has probably elminatedit from viewing by the same kids whoshould have seen ""Billy Elliot"".What a shame.So if the film makers had avoided thesubject of sexuality in this film--whichwould make no sense--maybe it would havebeen another ""family film"" that no onewanted to see.  After all, some of thebest, with no ""ssues"" like this, such as, for example,""Finding Neverland"", did not do that well.The young actor who plays Ralph Walkeris one of the best I have ever seen.The lyricism and imagery are moving throughout.So why not five stars?  This lonely,intellectually curious and sensitivc boyshould have been depicted as a classical music fan, particularly since the music in this filmis really lame.  He lives in his (dead)grandparents'house and it would make pefect sense if he werelistening to the music they loved, or ought to have loved.

In my head, I'm categorizing it together with other recent, low-budget, pleasant Canadian releases includingBollywood/Hollywood,Mambo Italiano,Touch of Pink, and the delightfully goofyFriends and Family.I felt like the film was undermined to a certain extent by Adam Butcher's lack of athleticism.  At one point we're supposed to believe that Campbell Scott is timing Butcher's Ralph at well under five minutes a mile.  And, indeed, I figured that part of the film would be the transformation of Butcher's ungainly, gawky stride into an elegant thing of beauty.  Never happened.  I never believed that fairly important part of the story for one second.  That's a 9+ minute a mile stride, even at its supposed apex.Still, the film has an inherent decency and sweetness that can't be denied.

945145,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000BMY2LK,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[9, 9]","SAINT RALPH is a pleasant surprise most watchers will find hidden away (or absent) at most video rental stores simply because it didn't get a lot of notice in the States. Filmed entirely in Canada by a Canadian crew and cast, this film will make it to the top of many favorites lists once viewers get a chance to see it.If you're a fan ofHoosiers,Rocky, or some other underdog story, you'll slowly fall for Saint Ralph in similar style.The story is that of a troubled 14-year-old at a parochial Catholic school in 1950s Ontario. Ralph Walker is his name (relative unknown Adam Butcher) and he's acting out at school. He smokes. He uses God's name in vain. He has ""impure thoughts."" And he has a mother who is very sick; a type of brain cancer is easily surmised. Ralph's father died in WWII and he now lives alone in a dilapidated home. Using school chum Chester (Michael Kanev) to help fake notes from Ralph's non-existent grandmother and grandfather, Ralph is able to fool the Catholic school's principal, Father Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pinsent,The Good Shepherd), into believing he resides with his aging grandparents.Ralph's mother Emma (Shauna MacDonald) eventually slips into a coma and Ralph is now truly alone in the world. Grasping at anything that is more anchored than himself, Ralph begins falling apart but holds himself together thanks to a kindly nurse at the hospital named Alice (Jennifer Tilly,Tideland) and a good-hearted priest named Father George Hibbert (Campbell Scott,Music and Lyrics). Father Hibbert one day initiates an interesting discussion in class about miracles and saints. How ordinary people of the past begat divine miracles. And when Ralph was at the hospital recently, Nurse Alice told him it would take a miracle for his mother to wake up from her coma. The idea to do something saintly so that his mother will awaken comes to him and he settles on winning the Boston Marathon. With the help of Father Hibbert's training, Nurse Alice's weight-lifting, and his classmates wavering support, Ralph eventually runs the Boston Marathon and ... we'll have to stop there.Uplifting isn't a word I would associate with myself, simply because I'm not a religious person. But one not need be to enjoy the messages entrenched in Saint Ralph. The uplifting music (Hallelujah), and the study of human endurance and friendship are a part of each of us regardless of our ""godly"" make-up. It is hope that'll keep viewers watching, not any sense of the miraculous, simply because many can't or won't believe in miracles (myself among them).It is also nice that the makers of this excellent movie didn't drop to the lowest religious denominator and thankfully made Ralph be a horribly flawed young man (including drinking, enjoying things that rub against his crotch, cursing, smoking, and nearly giving up on everything and everyone).The final sequence of scenes will remain with many as we watch Ralph return to school from Boston and meet up with many of his detractors and supporters. Yeah, it's uplifting but hallelujah! it's not corny.",4,Hallelujah!

But Little Ralph does just that in the new film ""Saint Ralph,"" and he embarks on a miraculous journey of sorts.Running as a metaphor for life's struggles has been done so many times it has become a cliche. From ""Forrest Gump"" to ""Without Limits,"" we've viewed protagonists racing from inner demons on the track of life more than we care to admit. Ralph's demons are death and loneliness, two favorite subjects in the cocoon of Catholic schools.Little Ralph - his competitors and classmates tower over him, so why not call him ""Little?"" - wishes to make his mark on life. More importantly, he's trying to survive in a world without parents as his father died in WW II and his mother is bedridden from a mysterious disease. Ralph (wonderfully played by newcomer Adam Butcher) seems to take it all in stride while battling raging hormones and intimidating priests at his Catholic school. When his mother falls into a coma, he learns it will take a miracle for her to awaken. Little Ralph decides to take matters into his own hands.Prompted by an off-hand comment about winning the Boston Marathon being akin to a miracle, Little Ralph decides one miracle will create another. If he wins the Boston Marathon, his mother should then awaken from her coma. So Ralph embarks on his personal quest, fueled by a dated library book detailing rigid workout regimes for young runners. Unbeknowst to Ralph, his cross country coach Father Hibbert (the underrated Campbell Scott, giving yet another fine performance) is a former Canadian marathon runner who gave up the sport for the cloth. Hibbert is touched by Ralph's efforts, and decides to help the boy with his unlikely journey.There is something almost mythical about the pursuit of a marathon - one of sport's greatest goals. The simple act of finishing a marathon requires great discipline. Perhaps ""Saint Ralph"" has bitten off more than it can chew by having a child attempt to win the most storied race in marathon lore. But the heart of the film pumps strong, and writer/director Michael McGowan is himself a Detroit marathon victor during the 1980s. As a viewer, we are asked to believe Little Ralph would have a chance in a race stocked full of vigorous athletes and adults. This is the beauty of ""Saint Ralph."" The kid is attempting a miracle. Should not the odds be so incredible as to be unbelievable?Many critics have sneered at ""Saint Ralph,"" though oddly, just as many have praised it. Little Ralph discovers similar sentiment in his own universe. When one attempts to pursue miracles, such dreams trouble cynical souls. I was captivated by his quest. The journey's the thing and, after all, must not Saints start with an impossible dream? Should we support such a perilous journey, or should young men and women be trained to accept normal paths so the plummeting fall of reality is less painful? ""Saint Ralph"" is asking a rather simple question, ""Are miracles possible in this day and age?""I think eventually we must accept our fate as the years pass by. The beauty of ""Saint Ralph"" is in its creation of a time of wonder for a youthful spirit. During childhood, miracles are obtainable. God appearing to Ralph in the form of Santa Claus may be eccentric, but it's valid. If we can believe in Santa Claus, then it's just as easy to believe in miracles. They are around the next bend of roads yet to be traveled. Miracles are within our grasp, as tangible as fresh fruit or a new bicycle. As adults, we lose sight of the wonder of it all.

Ralph makes a bargain with God to try and manufacture a miracle that will heal his ailing mother.  What follows is a mostly likeable but sometimes cringeworthy account of a complex coming of age.The main problem I had with the film comes from Adam Butcher's clunky acting in the lead role.  Though at times he rises to the emotive challenges at hand, more often his delivery has the kind of clunky, overeager ""Gee whiz, Mr. Wilson"" delivery that one would expect from Dennis the Menace in the American TV series.  Making up for this deficit are solid performances from Jennifer Tilly and the other teen actors and stellar, contrasting performances by Campbell Scott as Ralph's uplifting and inspiring trainer/teacher and Gordon Pinsent as the stern and doubting headmaster.Some beautiful (yet sometimes fleeting) shots of the Canadian countryside add to the overall appeal.  And ultimately, for all the unsubtle and clumsy heartstring-pulling this movie attempts, it's still very difficult not to get caught up in the final race, and the ending is deftly handled and quite well-done.

Saint Ralph wavers between the inspirational, the cute, and some serious coming of age issues; trying to do all three fails. Ralph Walker is a likeable trouble maker in the ninth grade at an oppressive Catholic boarding school. He cheats, lies, smokes, curses, underachieves, and enjoys his raging hormones. His father died in the war (the film is set in 1953), his mother lies deathly sick in a coma (although you would never know it because she looks quite beautiful), and if he is expelled from the school he is orphaned. He learns in his religion class that performing a miracle requires faith, prayer, and purity, and so he sets out to run the Boston Marathon in order to effect a miracle for his dying mother. Sub plots with a girl friend and a teacher-priest who just happens to have been a marathoner as a young man add little. I did not find Saint Ralph even remotely believable, nor did I appreciate that Catholicism was presented in the worst possible light. The headmaster is a cardboard character who, yes, is a sick tyrant. Ralph has several visitations from God who appears to him in the form of Santa Claus.

Rossi,"[3, 4]","A film such as Saint Ralph might cause people such as myself to renounce the idea of a movie based on faith and miracles simply because of my agnostic tendencies, but alas, I had recently been bowled over by a different subtly religious undertoned movie(small miracles) so I decided what the hey, I'll try Saint Ralph out as well.Saint Ralph is not subtle, it is boldly and directly faith based, and here again, I was enraptured by the movie. It wasn't the director's excellent timing, not the terrific writing or the way thet the characters all seemed to fit so perfectly in their roles. These and many other aspects make Saint Ralph one of the most well put together coming of age dramas I've seen in recent years. When all is said and done though, what made this film truly memorable was Adam Butcher. In Ralph he plays a kid who is least likely to leave purgatory due to sins piling up like a stack of encyclopedias perched perilously close to the edge of a volcano. Adam's portrayal of Ralph is very knowing. He understands the degree of his erroneous(in the eyes of the priests at his Catholic school) in-your-face sinning and the fact that he is about a half step away from being booted from the school by headmaster Fitzpatrick. He knows that his life is filled with so much strife in that he is fatherless and has a mom gravely ill in the hospital. He can decipher the difference between right and wrong, but he also knows he is 14 years old, and being young means a grey area known as inexperience. Adam Butcher's ability to handle and keep balanced such a complex role is what makes this at times funny yet all too serious movie a tremendous hit. In lesser hands, Ralph's character could have fallen flat and this movie would have been extremely one dimensional, as so many of these intended to be inspiring movies usually tend to be. Like Elijah Wood and Haley Joel Osment before him, Adam Butcher is a young actor with a special quality all his own that will hopefully continue to catapult his career along.

Much of this movie's humor is that of misunderstanding.  Ralph, a 9th grader, gets a lot wrong, perhaps since he 's lacking adult guidance, with his war hero father dead, his hospitalized Mom entering a coma, and he living alone at home though faking to the Headmaster that he's staying with grandparents.  Plus, he's got other, more typical, 14-year-old problems, such as being the object of ridicule by classmates and difficulty controlling his hormones.  After a little pool incident, the Headmaster attempts to resolve Ralph's hormonal ""energy surplus"" problem by sentencing him to the cross-country team.  After his coach says, ""let's go, 180 days left til the Boston Marathon,"" Ralph asks about running it, and the coach says he was kidding, that anyone from the team winning it would be ""a miracle to rival the loaves and fishes.""  Having taken literally a nurses statement that it'd take a miracle for his mom to recover, scrawny, smoker Ralph then sets out to win the Boston miracle, in defiance of opposition from the Headmaster.  Ralph gets misguided (and comedic) instruction from out-of-date books about how to train and from a fellow student (and aspiring nun/crush-interest) on the requirements for producing a miracle.Despite the Catholic setting, this is not a religious movie, and secularists could easily point out that Ralph's theology is all confused and the movie's about hard work and good intentions, while a believers might see it as picturing God's responsiveness to sincere, crying hearts, even if our theology's not all formulated rightly.  There are few movie's I'd recommend for almost everyone, but this is one of them.

945163,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BMY2LK,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","SAINT RALPH is a little jewel of a film.  Stories about kids who gain faith through acts of courage are usually tainted with saccharine scripts, but with the wise use of presenting a well-rounded, multidimensional character as the hero of this story, writer/director Michael McGowan succeeds in a touching tale that is so based on real beahvioral patterns of young teens that it becomes simply an inspiring and entertaining movie.Ralph (Adam Butcher) is 14, his father died a war hero, and his mother is hospitalized for a terminal illness.  Ralph is in Catholic School run by the stern disciplinarian Father Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pinsent) who, understanding that Ralph has a free spirit and a propensity for getting into trouble, spies on him. Ralph is repeatedly  'punished' for his transgressions, but when he inadvertently has a hilarious swimming pool/voyeuristic experience, he is threatened with expulsion unless he joins the school's Cross Country team run by the kindly Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott).Ralph's 'naughty nature' is balanced by his complete devotion to his hospitalized mother (Shauna MacDonald) whom he visits daily: she is all he has.  His mother's nurse (Jennifer Tilly) is compassionate and shares with Ralph that as his mother slips into coma that the only thing that will save her is a miracle.  Simultaneously Ralph's coach (Father Hibbert) jests that the only way any of the team would win the Boston Marathon would be a miracle.  The dots connect; Ralph trains, and through faith and commitment finds himself crossing the finish line of the Marathon!The manner in which McGowan ends the story is part of what makes this film unique.  Just as he allows Ralph to be a testy kid who continues to have hilarious episodes right up to the end of the story, he doesn't let the film end in bathos.  He makes every action and deed that occur in Ralph's journey combine to drive toward the final meaning.  So here is a gentle comedy with a heart, one that is touching while it is a little racy, full of faith while it tests rationality. The cast is superb and seem committed under McGowan's wise direction to find just the right level of realism, making us root strongly for a kid with impossible challenges. Recommended.

Another tale of an underdog attempting to work a miracle (although this time, it's a real miracle).This is the type of movie it's hard to criticize. If you objectively call out these feel good films, you either appear heartless or emotionless. But nothing gives me greater satisfaction than when a movie moves me, touches me, or otherwise engages me in strong feeling. I just want this feeling to be developed naturally through a great story or characters I come to value. What I usually get, however, is contrivance and/or emotional manipulation.""Saint Ralph"" is a pleasant movie, it's all perfectly fine. It's sweet and sentimental--heck, it's about a kid who wants to rouse his mother from a coma. So he thinks if he can perform a miracle, that will awaken her--he's been told that's what she needs. He starts running track at school and soon becomes convinced that his miracle could be winning the Boston Marathon. How's that for a leap of faith! And we're off with a plot so cute, so precious--who could deny it's appeal.Along the way he'll get help from a coach--a progressive priest who is wise where others are shallow. Played by Campbell Scott, it's a nice performance from a reliable actor. Of course, Ralph's determination will have a great affect on those who surround him. His belief and conviction will naturally strengthen everyone's faith. Maybe miracles really do happen!I'll leave the running of the race to your imagination.

945171,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BMY2LK,mirasreviews,"[44, 44]","""Saint Ralph"" is the second movie of 2005 to use religious faith, specifically Catholicism, to create drama and humor in stories about young people and their families. The first was the British film ""Millions"", about a boy who believes a sack of money that landed on his play house must have come from God. From Canada, we get ""Saint Ralph"", a good-natured dramedy with genuine emotions and an appealingly mischievous young  lead. I find it interesting that both of these films are able to take religious faith seriously, because their main characters do, without taking the doctrine, itself, very seriously. They seem to view religion as a matter-of-fact part of the human experience at the root of many meaningful experiences and a lot of comic absurdity as well. The results are charming, creative films that appeal to both religious and secular audiences.In 1953, Ralph Walker (Adam Butcher) is a 14-year-old Catholic school freshman always in trouble with the stern headmaster Father Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pinsent) for petty transgressions. Ralph's is full of life and optimistic, but his girl-chasing and mischief-making belie his troubles. His beloved mother, his only family, is gravely ill.  When she falls into a coma, Ralph despairs that he may lose her and end up in an orphanage. Conventional methods of waking her won't work. Ralph needs a miracle. When the coach of his school's cross-country team, Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott), mentions that any of his students winning the Boston Marathon would be ""a miracle to rival the loaves and fishes"", Ralph concludes that that's just the miracle his mother needs. If Ralph can win the Boston Marathon, his mother will recover, or so he believes. With the help of Father Hibbert, his mother's nurse Alice (Jennifer Tilly), and his would-be girlfriend Claire's (Tamara Hope) well-intentioned but screwy advice, Ralph sets out to be a marathoner.The most crucial thing writer/director Michael McGovern had to do was probably to choose the right actor to play Ralph. Adam Butcher is young and relatively inexperienced, but he has to carry this film. And he does. Ralph is wonderfully irreverent, idealistic, and touchingly loyal to his mother, and he's in nearly every scene. He's funny, dramatic, empathetic, and gives ""Saint Ralph"" a great deal of emotional authenticity, even though it is a somewhat fanciful story. Butcher is just terrific. I'm sure no small amount of credit is due Michael McGovern's direction. Campbell Scott, one of the greatest living character actors, takes a supporting role with limited dialogue that could easily be called a clich&eacute;, but he is able to give Father Hibbert  enough emotional weight to overcome that. ""Saint Ralph"" is low-key and doesn't' strive to be realistic, but it knows where the humor lies in everyday life and isn't afraid to take the view of a young man with some goofy ideas. It's really an enjoyable film.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features are one featurette and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Scenes of Saint Ralph"" (9 minutes) is primarily interviews with writer/director Michael McGovern, in which he talks about the ideas behind the film, and with the cast, who discuss their characters. Also includes brief interviews with the producers and some behind-the-scenes footage. In the audio commentary, Michael McGowan gives a scene-by-scene account of editing and narrative decisions, technical details, and a lot about filming.

945175,AZL8ZFJMYLSV3,B000BMY2LK,P. Walker,"[2, 3]","I once asked a young man (in his twenties) why, according to the Bible, it took God four days to create the earth and it's contents but took him only moments to create the entire, complete, whole, expansive universe. He just stared at me dumbfounded without answering. I suggested that it was ""guts"", that God had to take time to perfect guts or we could be crapping out of our ears. Evidently that satisfied the conundrum that I had presented him with, since he stated, ""You know, that's probably right."" Saint Ralph reminded me of this young man.The gullibility that religion produces is evident in this film, after all one must believe in something that cannot be seen, heard or felt, and must be accepted by blind faith without evidence. This is one of the reasons the religious are targeted by cons and scammers (i.e. Nigerian 419 email scams). It also reveals that although the Bible is a bestseller, it is one of the most unread and misunderstood books, mainly used as a talismanic object. This gullibility is also evident in the fact that some ""believers"" seem to think that this is a pro-religious film. Some reviewers state that it increased their faith!? I could understand that being the case with an image of Jesus on a grilled cheese sandwich, but this film, really? This fictitious film is a testament to the human spirit. Definitely not on the scale with the film ""Rocky"" but at least a nod in that general direction. God, in the film, could have easily been replaced by an angel, fairy or leprechaun.It would seem that the satirical elements throughout the film would cause most believers to shun it. The mocking of actual saints (i.e. Saint Christina the Astonishing - Patron Saint of Lunatics) and the images that Ralph projects of God being a Santa-like figure cheering him on from the sidelines, but of course, offering no effectual help. Ralph is just one of the billions of people on this planet who needs a miracle. What do you do when you need to get God's attention? What every religion requires of you...sacrifice. All you have to do is believe, have faith... oh, and be a martyr. In order to get his miracle, Ralph decides that God wants him to run in the Boston Marathon...and win.Ralph is forced to grow up in terrible circumstances, naively dealing with life that keeps him subjugated to his religion, hoping God will answer his prayers. After all, God, like Santa, rewards if you obey and are good. Not realizing that God is probably tired, after all, he had to rest after creating everything there is including two people. Now there are billions of people whining for help, which must be overwhelming. He therefore centers most of his attention on answering the prayers of the rich and corporate bigwigs since they seem to have an easier life. The film is heart-warming but also reveals the politics of religion, the hierarchical injustice that permeates religion, and the unmerciful attitude that keeps people in a box with no escape. Will God help poor Ralph? I'm sure as much as Santa brings toys to good girls and boys.",4,Run! Ralph!

945176,A2JYIDH7JIG48H,B000BMY2LK,"R. Christenson / Lunamation ""SpaceComics.com""","[5, 7]","Clearly the best movie out this month (I've seen most of them). The easiest way to tell you about it is to compare it to similar movies, and the first that came to mind were Lucas (Corey Haim) and Rudy (Sean Astin). What Saint Ralph shares in common with these films is the extreme athletic determination, against all odds, of a spirited boy from a pathetic background. And it's the best of it's kind since Rudy (1993), at least, and in my opinion since Lucas (1986).Ralph (Adam Butcher) is a naughty but naive 14-year-old boy, ready to take almost everything literally, now faced with the paradox of faith. His widowed mother is apparently dying in the hospital, and falls into a coma early in the story. A doctor says it will take a miracle to wake her.Ralph is an interesting character, his even blend of pure and impure motives providing both the humor that makes the film entertaining, and the realism that makes it believable particularly his self-abuse in every sense of the term, from the usual meaning to literally sanding his knees to pray in a pan of alcohol, the latter recommended by his girflriend, who aspires to be a nun.When his Catholic school's cross country coach says it would be a miracle if anyone on his team won the Boston Marathon, Ralph's literal mind seizes a fallacious opportunity. If he wins the Boston Marathon, it would be a miracle, and that's what his mother needs to survive. Most of the movie is about his training to run that race, both physical and spiritual, with the help of a priest (Campbell Scott), a nurse (Jennifer Tilly), and his girlfriend (Tamara Hope).The blend of comedy and pathos is effective, the film kept entertaining by the comedy in the foreground, while the fact that Ralph's mother is dying keeps us interested in the outcome and rooting for the boy. Even if you don't like running or sports in general, the life at stake, or at least the boy's faith at stake, makes this race important.There's a bit too much sexual comedy to let small children see, particularly humor about self-abuse, about as crude as a couple of the worst episodes of Roseanne. For instance, after Ralph's caught in a venal sin in the swimming pool, that involved spying on the girl's locker room, he tells his mother ""It was really an accident. The manufacture of the pool was faulty."" The incident becomes a running joke, demonstrating Ralph's character trait of not caring what other people think. He later says they didn't really need to drain the pool (I'm not going to explain that, but it was funny). But it's not as crude as other current comedies like The Wedding Crashers, Deuce Bigalow, 40-year-old Virgin and The Bad News Bears.I recommend Saint Ralph specifically to anyone who liked Lucas or Rudy, and generally to anyone old enough to take the humor maturely.",5,Athletic determination of a spirited youth against backdrop of pathos.,1124928000,"08 25, 2005",2005,2806,"['Clearly', 'best', 'movie', 'month', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'easiest', 'way', 'tell', 'compare', 'similar', 'movies', 'first', 'came', 'mind', 'were', 'Lucas', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'Rudy', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'What', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'shares', 'common', 'films', 'extreme', 'athletic', 'determination', 'odds', 'spirited', 'boy', 'pathetic', 'background', 'best', 'kind', 'Rudy', '1993', 'least', 'opinion', 'Lucas', '1986', '.Ralph', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'naughty', 'naive', '14-year-old', 'boy', 'ready', 'take', 'almost', 'everything', 'literally', 'now', 'faced', 'paradox', 'faith', 'widowed', 'mother', 'apparently', 'dying', 'hospital', 'coma', 'early', 'story', 'doctor', 'will', 'take', 'miracle', 'wake', 'her.Ralph', 'interesting', 'character', 'even', 'blend', 'pure', 'impure', 'motives', 'providing', 'humor', 'film', 'entertaining', 'realism', 'believable', 'particularly', 'self-abuse', 'sense', 'term', 'usual', 'meaning', 'literally', 'sanding', 'knees', 'pray', 'pan', 'alcohol', 'latter', 'recommended', 'girflriend', 'who', 'be', 'nun.When', 'Catholic', 'school', 'cross', 'country', 'coach', 'would', 'be', 'miracle', 'anyone', 'team', 'won', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'Ralph', 'literal', 'mind', 'fallacious', 'opportunity', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'would', 'be', 'miracle', 'what', 'mother', 'survive', 'Most', 'movie', 'training', 'run', 'race', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'help', 'priest', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'nurse', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'girlfriend', 'Tamara', 'Hope', '.The', 'blend', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'effective', 'film', 'kept', 'entertaining', 'comedy', 'foreground', 'fact', 'Ralph', 'mother', 'dying', 'keeps', 'interested', 'outcome', 'rooting', 'boy', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'running', 'sports', 'general', 'life', 'stake', 'least', 'boy', 'faith', 'stake', 'race', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'sexual', 'comedy', 'let', 'small', 'children', 'see', 'particularly', 'humor', 'self-abuse', 'about', 'as', 'crude', 'couple', 'worst', 'episodes', 'Roseanne', 'instance', 'Ralph', 'caught', 'venal', 'sin', 'swimming', 'pool', 'involved', 'spying', 'girl', 'locker', 'room', 'mother', 'was', 'really', 'accident', 'manufacture', 'pool', 'was', 'faulty', 'incident', 'running', 'joke', 'demonstrating', 'Ralph', 'character', 'trait', 'not', 'caring', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'think', 'later', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'drain', 'pool', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'explain', 'was', 'funny', 'not', 'as', 'crude', 'other', 'current', 'comedies', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', 'Deuce', 'Bigalow', '40-year-old', 'Virgin', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears.I', 'recommend', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'specifically', 'anyone', 'who', 'liked', 'Lucas', 'Rudy', 'generally', 'anyone', 'old', 'enough', 'take', 'humor', 'maturely']",N/A

945182,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000BMY2LK,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 3]","SAINT RALPH is a feel good film that you can't help but enjoy. It tells the story of fourteen year old Ralph Walker (Adam Butcher), a lovable kid who is trying to fend in the world on his own. His father died in World War II and his mother is suffering from a brain tumor. When she enters a coma, Ralph hopes for a miracle and believes his running and winning the Boston Marathon will be the miracle that will cure his mother. His plans run afoul of his school's headmaster Fr. Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pincent), who sees the young Ralph as some sort of deviant and only allows him to stay in the school because his father died a hero. Ralph does find an ally in his religion teacher, Fr. Hibbert (Campbell Scott), a former runner himself.The film has some great strengths. The story is engaging and Ralph is endearing. Jennifer Tilly plays a compassionate nurse named Alice who takes Ralph under her wing and helps him train for the race. The relationship between Fr. Hibbert and the young Ralph is believable but hardly predictable and each seems to help the other. The film has a 1950's feel to it and a sense of innocence is created throughout. The acting is very good, especially Adam Butcher as Ralph. The only drawback is the writer's insistence on falling back on old Catholic stereotyped humor about sins of the flesh. We've seen it before, a boy enters a confessional and confesses his sexual sins and instead of a priest it turns out that schoolmates are listening.

945183,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BMY2LK,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","In spite of the inclusion of two famous actors Campbell Scott and Jennifer Tilly, newcomer Adam Butcher playing the titular character Ralph, a brazen but charming 14-year-old boy in Catholic school, is the real power of `Saint Ralph.' The religious matter does not always go together well with more impressive theme -- the boy's own faith about doing miracle --  but Adam Butcher's winsome performance assisted by Scott's capable acting makes the film a winner in the end.Ralph Walker, son of the war hero who died during the WWII, decided to join in the prestigious Boston marathon in order to create a miracle because, he believes, miracle is the only way to wake up his hospitalized mother in coma again. Despite the strong opposition from the principle of the Catholic school. Ralph goes to Boston, after enlisting help from a younger priest (and former athlete) Father Hibbert (Scott). Jennifer Tilly also appears as Nurse Alice (most incredibly she teaches him bench-pressing), and Tamara Hope as Claire, Ralph's love interest, who gives a few advice on religion.As I said, the film's most charming part is the main character Ralph played by Adam Butcher, whose eyes remind me of those of Jason Biggs. And like the star of `Amreican Pie' series, he can make the character very likeable even though some episodes are awfully silly, as if quoted (or ripped-off, if you like) directly from the famous gag scene using a pie. Still, his credible acting gives surprising depth and energy to the character of Ralph, and so does Scott's beautifully underplayed performance as disillusioned priest.There are incredibly sentimentalized part in `Saint Ralph' that almost becomes mawkish. Several episodes should have been clearly deleted in the cutting room, such as the ones about a fire and Santa, and writer/director Michael McGowan goes too far in showing that the boy can really run, or `fly.'But for all these flaws and the stereotyped images of Catholic school, `Saint Ralph' is a winner thanks to its excellent actors and their good performances.",4,Miracle Runner: Inspirational Story with Good Acting from Butcher and Scott,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2049,"['spite', 'inclusion', 'two', 'famous', 'actors', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'newcomer', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'playing', 'titular', 'character', 'Ralph', 'brazen', 'charming', '14-year-old', 'boy', 'Catholic', 'school', 'real', 'power', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'religious', 'matter', 'not', 'always', 'go', 'together', 'well', 'more', 'impressive', 'theme', 'boy', 'own', 'faith', 'doing', 'miracle', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'winsome', 'performance', 'assisted', 'Scott', 'capable', 'acting', 'film', 'winner', 'end.Ralph', 'Walker', 'son', 'war', 'hero', 'who', 'died', 'WWII', 'decided', 'join', 'prestigious', 'Boston', 'marathon', 'order', 'create', 'miracle', 'miracle', 'only', 'way', 'wake', 'up', 'hospitalized', 'mother', 'coma', 'again', 'strong', 'opposition', 'principle', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Ralph', 'Boston', 'enlisting', 'help', 'younger', 'priest', 'former', 'athlete', 'Father', 'Hibbert', 'Scott', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'also', 'Nurse', 'Alice', 'most', 'incredibly', 'bench-pressing', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Claire', 'Ralph', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'few', 'advice', 'religion.As', 'said', 'film', 'most', 'charming', 'part', 'main', 'character', 'Ralph', 'played', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'eyes', 'remind', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'star', 'Amreican', 'Pie', 'series', 'can', 'make', 'character', 'very', 'likeable', 'even', 'episodes', 'are', 'awfully', 'silly', 'quoted', 'ripped-off', 'like', 'directly', 'famous', 'gag', 'scene', 'using', 'pie', 'Still', 'credible', 'acting', 'surprising', 'depth', 'energy', 'character', 'Ralph', 'so', 'Scott', 'beautifully', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'disillusioned', 'are', 'incredibly', 'sentimentalized', 'part', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'almost', 'mawkish', 'Several', 'episodes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'clearly', 'deleted', 'cutting', 'room', 'such', 'ones', 'fire', 'Santa', 'writer/director', 'Michael', 'McGowan', 'too', 'far', 'showing', 'boy', 'can', 'really', 'run', 'fly', 'flaws', 'stereotyped', 'images', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'winner', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'actors', 'good', 'performances']",N/A

Ralph Walker (Adam Butcher) is fourteen-years-old and in the ninth grade.  Ralph is an only child.  His father apparently died while serving in the military and his Mother is in the hospital dying slowly from an unknown illness.  Meanwhile, so that he can continue attending school uninterrupted, Ralph pretends to be living with his grandmother when in actuality he has been living by himself.  He forges notes and creates very detailed stories to support his claim.  All the while Ralph is going through puberty and is fighting hormonal urges and an increasing sexual desire.  But, Ralph isn't really a bad kid; he has a good heart and is doing what he can to not only survive but to live.Ralph is forced to join the high school cross-country team as punishment for smoking.  The priests at the school think it will do Ralph some good; it'll teach him discipline and get him to work off some of his excessive adolescent energy.  Ralph begins the sport with a positive attitude, but is so much smaller than his peers that at first he isn't very good.  But Ralph becomes good and soon comes to love the sport.  When his mother falls into a coma Ralph becomes convinced that the only way he can awaken her is to perform a miracle:  winning the Boston Marathon.  Under the tutelage of his coach, teacher, and former award-winning runner Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott), the encouragement of his mother's nurse Alice (Jennifer Tilly), and some help and advice from his hope-to-be girlfriend Claire (Tamara Hope), Ralph begins 180 days of training for the big race.  His perseverance pays off and though there are many obstacles, it looks becomes possible that little Ralph might be able to pull off a miracle through running.Adam Butcher is perfectly cast as Ralph Walker.  Campbell Scott offers a fine performance as Father Hibbert and the lovely Jennifer Tilly is always a joy to watch on screen.  Director Michael McGovern also wrote the screenplay for the film and he did a good job at both.  The movie revolves around faith and how people live and react to faith.  This is a fine line because many other filmmakers have tried to make movies about faith, but have failed tremendously.  McGovern really doesn't.  His story respects the life of faith, especially Catholicism, yet allows for some wonderment and bewilderment of the mysterious in the supernatural.  SAINT RALPH could have easily become a movie full of caricatures and false emotion, but instead it is an honest and slightly humorous film full of hope.SAINT RALPH has a lot of humor and though it isn't necessary realistic, it is authentic.  There are some hilarious moments in the film, but if not viewed with the right mindset these moments seem almost juvenile (and will get juvenile reactions from some).  However, viewed in the right context these moments are humorous and goofy, but not juvenile.  Not everyone will enjoy SAINT RALPH.  There are many who would probably find it boring and many others who would probably view it as being silly.  However, the movie does have a lot to offer and if one allows the film to set in, one can see it for the joyous film that it is.",4,"The Love of a Son, The Faith of a Child.",1161734400,"10 25, 2006",2006,3294,"['SAINT', 'RALPH', 'fictional', 'movie', 'Canadian', 'Catholic', 'teenager', 'who', 'addicted', 'running', 'dreams', 'running', '1954', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'Ralph', 'Walker', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'fourteen-years-old', 'ninth', 'grade', 'Ralph', 'only', 'child', 'father', 'apparently', 'died', 'serving', 'military', 'Mother', 'hospital', 'dying', 'slowly', 'unknown', 'illness', 'Meanwhile', 'can', 'continue', 'attending', 'school', 'uninterrupted', 'Ralph', 'be', 'living', 'grandmother', 'when', 'actuality', 'been', 'living', 'notes', 'very', 'detailed', 'stories', 'support', 'claim', 'while', 'Ralph', 'going', 'puberty', 'fighting', 'hormonal', 'urges', 'increasing', 'sexual', 'desire', 'Ralph', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'kid', 'good', 'heart', 'doing', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'survive', 'live.Ralph', 'forced', 'join', 'high', 'school', 'cross-country', 'team', 'punishment', 'smoking', 'priests', 'school', 'think', 'will', 'do', 'Ralph', 'good', ""'ll"", 'teach', 'discipline', 'get', 'work', 'off', 'excessive', 'adolescent', 'energy', 'Ralph', 'sport', 'positive', 'attitude', 'so', 'much', 'smaller', 'peers', 'first', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Ralph', 'becomes', 'good', 'soon', 'love', 'sport', 'When', 'mother', 'coma', 'Ralph', 'convinced', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'awaken', 'perform', 'miracle', 'winning', 'Boston', 'Marathon', 'tutelage', 'coach', 'teacher', 'former', 'award-winning', 'runner', 'Father', 'Hibbert', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'encouragement', 'mother', 'nurse', 'Alice', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'help', 'advice', 'hope-to-be', 'girlfriend', 'Claire', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Ralph', '180', 'days', 'training', 'big', 'race', 'perseverance', 'are', 'many', 'obstacles', 'possible', 'little', 'Ralph', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'miracle', 'running.Adam', 'Butcher', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Ralph', 'Walker', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'fine', 'performance', 'Father', 'Hibbert', 'lovely', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'screen', 'Director', 'Michael', 'McGovern', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'faith', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'react', 'faith', 'fine', 'line', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'tried', 'make', 'movies', 'faith', 'have', 'failed', 'tremendously', 'McGovern', 'really', ""n't"", 'story', 'life', 'faith', 'especially', 'Catholicism', 'yet', 'wonderment', 'bewilderment', 'mysterious', 'supernatural', 'SAINT', 'RALPH', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'movie', 'full', 'caricatures', 'false', 'emotion', 'instead', 'honest', 'slightly', 'humorous', 'film', 'full', 'hope.SAINT', 'RALPH', 'lot', 'humor', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'realistic', 'authentic', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'not', 'viewed', 'right', 'mindset', 'moments', 'seem', 'almost', 'juvenile', 'will', 'get', 'juvenile', 'reactions', 'However', 'viewed', 'right', 'context', 'moments', 'are', 'humorous', 'goofy', 'not', 'juvenile', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'SAINT', 'RALPH', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'boring', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'view', 'being', 'silly', 'However', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'offer', 'one', 'film', 'set', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'joyous', 'film']",N/A
945185,AGLL9FGGXRSH7,B000BMY2LK,"T. Williams ""world traveller""","[4, 5]","I will forgo a synopsis of ""Saint Ralph"" since there are plenty of other reviews that cover the plot. Allow me instead to consider its strengths.The pleasures of ""Saint Ralph"" may best be attributed to the ways in which it exceeds expectations. This humble little Canadian film with an ""I think I can attitude,"" is plotted much like an afterschool special for television. However, while its premise seems slightly familiar, ""Saint Ralph"" charms its audience much more than one might think it capable.The movie's major asset is its cast. Adam Butcher succeeds admirably in the pivotal role of Ralph Walker. Butcher is always believable, whether handling the sometimes ribald humor or frustrated mourning for a mother who is certainly not dead, but not quite alive either. He leads off a fine ensemble of young actors (including the well-cast Michael Kaney and the radiant Tamara Hope) who defy the cookie cutter mold of cutesy and/or smart-mouthed kids who turn up in standard Hollywood fare.The contributions made to this film by Campbell Scott and Gordon Pinsent are immeasurable. Scott is excellent as usual. No matter what his role, Scott always seems as though he is hiding a secret inner turmoil - and this plays well in his role of Father Hibbert whose faith has come unanchored. Pinsent, on the other hand, pulls off the greater magic trick. He fashions the stern headmaster Father Fitzpatrick into something of flesh and blood without ever resorting to caricature. You can't love his character, but you will never be able to hate him either. Kudos to Writer/Director Michael McGowan for not painting Fitzpatrick as either a curmudgeon or archetypal villain. Had this been a Disney movie we'd have seen Father Fitzpatrick fall into a bucket of slime/water/donkey poo just as Ralph crossed the marathon finish line.Jennifer Tilly plays Jennifer Tilly ... well, you know what I mean. She is always interesting to watch but I can never be sure why. She kind of has this whole ""Bettie Page in a starched white nurses uniform"" thing going on here that certainly works well.  Mention must be made of Paulette Sinclair as the school secretary, whom McGowan allowed to have a moment to make a sweet impression upon the audience.Although it sometimes seems aimed at those who've enjoyed/endured a parochial education, those of us who are decidedly NOT Catholic will still chuckle at the film's humor and ache with its pathos.For instance, I never had a crush on a girl who aspired to be a nun, but I could certainly identify with Ralph's tumultuously awkward mix of adolescent desire and reverence for the object of his affection. Tamara Hope, Richard Gere's daughter in ""Shall We Dance,"" is sweetly exquisite as the novice-wannabe. Filmed as though she were illumined with a beatific light, how could Ralph ever be sure whether he should kiss her or light a candle and take her on pilgrimage to Lourdes?This film does indeed discuss faith, but is not a pietistic celluloid catechism. It does, however, contain a remarkable and somewhat provocative line, which Campbell Scott delivers almost as a throwaway: ""As anarchists go, Nietzsche had nothing on Christ.""The story focuses on an adolescent boy, but this film cannot be pigeon-holed as a kid's movie. While not quite the same caliber as ""Stand By Me,"" ""Children of Heaven"" or ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" this movie does share the more mature sensibility and universal appeal that characterized those movies. While ""Saint Ralph"" would never be confused with a ""Porky's"" or ""American Pie,"" its references to Ralph's burgeoning sexual impulse would be my only reservation in recommending this as a film for the whole family.""Saint Ralph"" is an understated film that would never out dazzle a special effects blockbuster, but in it you will find characters that you will both recognize and cherish.",4,A Pleasant Surprise,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,3845,"['will', 'forgo', 'synopsis', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'reviews', 'cover', 'plot', 'Allow', 'instead', 'consider', 'strengths.The', 'pleasures', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'may', 'best', 'be', 'attributed', 'ways', 'expectations', 'humble', 'little', 'Canadian', 'film', 'think', 'can', 'attitude', 'plotted', 'much', 'afterschool', 'special', 'television', 'However', 'premise', 'slightly', 'familiar', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'audience', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'major', 'asset', 'cast', 'Adam', 'Butcher', 'admirably', 'pivotal', 'role', 'Ralph', 'Walker', 'Butcher', 'always', 'believable', 'handling', 'sometimes', 'ribald', 'humor', 'frustrated', 'mourning', 'mother', 'who', 'certainly', 'not', 'dead', 'not', 'quite', 'alive', 'either', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'young', 'actors', 'including', 'well-cast', 'Michael', 'Kaney', 'radiant', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'who', 'defy', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'mold', 'cutesy', 'smart-mouthed', 'kids', 'who', 'turn', 'up', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare.The', 'contributions', 'made', 'film', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'Gordon', 'Pinsent', 'are', 'immeasurable', 'Scott', 'excellent', 'usual', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'Scott', 'always', 'hiding', 'secret', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'well', 'role', 'Father', 'Hibbert', 'faith', 'come', 'unanchored', 'Pinsent', 'other', 'hand', 'greater', 'magic', 'trick', 'stern', 'headmaster', 'Father', 'Fitzpatrick', 'something', 'flesh', 'blood', 'ever', 'resorting', 'caricature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'character', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'hate', 'either', 'Kudos', 'Writer/Director', 'Michael', 'McGowan', 'not', 'painting', 'Fitzpatrick', 'curmudgeon', 'archetypal', 'villain', 'Had', 'been', 'Disney', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'seen', 'Father', 'Fitzpatrick', 'fall', 'bucket', 'slime/water/donkey', 'poo', 'just', 'Ralph', 'crossed', 'marathon', 'finish', 'line.Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'always', 'interesting', 'watch', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'why', 'kind', 'whole', 'Bettie', 'Page', 'starched', 'white', 'nurses', 'uniform', 'thing', 'going', 'here', 'certainly', 'well', 'Mention', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'Paulette', 'Sinclair', 'school', 'secretary', 'whom', 'McGowan', 'allowed', 'have', 'moment', 'make', 'sweet', 'impression', 'audience.Although', 'sometimes', 'aimed', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed/endured', 'parochial', 'education', 'who', 'are', 'decidedly', 'NOT', 'Catholic', 'will', 'still', 'chuckle', 'film', 'humor', 'ache', 'pathos.For', 'instance', 'never', 'had', 'crush', 'girl', 'who', 'aspired', 'be', 'nun', 'could', 'certainly', 'identify', 'Ralph', 'tumultuously', 'awkward', 'mix', 'adolescent', 'desire', 'reverence', 'object', 'affection', 'Tamara', 'Hope', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'daughter', 'Shall', 'Dance', 'sweetly', 'exquisite', 'novice-wannabe', 'Filmed', 'were', 'illumined', 'beatific', 'light', 'how', 'could', 'Ralph', 'ever', 'be', 'sure', 'should', 'kiss', 'light', 'candle', 'take', 'pilgrimage', 'Lourdes', 'film', 'indeed', 'discuss', 'faith', 'not', 'pietistic', 'celluloid', 'catechism', 'however', 'contain', 'remarkable', 'somewhat', 'provocative', 'line', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'almost', 'throwaway', 'anarchists', 'go', 'Nietzsche', 'had', 'nothing', 'Christ', 'story', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pigeon-holed', 'kid', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'caliber', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Children', 'Heaven', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'movie', 'share', 'more', 'mature', 'sensibility', 'universal', 'appeal', 'characterized', 'movies', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'confused', 'Porky', 'American', 'Pie', 'references', 'Ralph', 'burgeoning', 'sexual', 'impulse', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'reservation', 'recommending', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'Saint', 'Ralph', 'understated', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'out', 'dazzle', 'special', 'effects', 'blockbuster', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'will', 'both', 'recognize', 'cherish']",N/A
