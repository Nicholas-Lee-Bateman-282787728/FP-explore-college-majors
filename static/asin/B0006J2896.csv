I would definitely say you should buy the Disney Treasures Complte Goofy set since all of the shorts on this DVD are in the Treasures set.  You get EVERY Goofy short in that Treasures Set.  Trouble is it's out of print now and only available in the seconday market.  If you can get that at a resonable price then that is your best bet.This is a very good DVD however containing 9 Goofy shorts made in the 1940's and 1950's.  it includes several of Goofy's ""how to"" series where Goofy takes part in the demonstration and a narrrator does the voice over.  These include: How to Dance, How to Swim, how to Fish, and The Art of Skiing.  These are all quite funny.It's worth the $12 or so but any Goofy fan should try and find the Complete Goofy set if possible.",4,THESE ARE ALL ON THE COMPLETE GOOFY SET,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,776,"['Here', 'quandry', 'would', 'definitely', 'say', 'should', 'buy', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'Complte', 'Goofy', 'set', 'shorts', 'DVD', 'are', 'Treasures', 'set', 'get', 'EVERY', 'Goofy', 'short', 'Set', 'Trouble', 'print', 'now', 'only', 'available', 'seconday', 'market', 'can', 'get', 'resonable', 'price', 'then', 'best', 'bet.This', 'very', 'good', 'DVD', 'however', 'containing', '9', 'Goofy', 'shorts', 'made', '1940', '1950', 'several', 'Goofy', 'how', 'series', 'where', 'Goofy', 'part', 'demonstration', 'narrrator', 'voice', 'include', 'How', 'Dance', 'How', 'Swim', 'how', 'Fish', 'Art', 'Skiing', 'are', 'quite', 'funny.It', 'worth', '12', 'so', 'Goofy', 'fan', 'should', 'try', 'find', 'Complete', 'Goofy', 'set', 'possible']","Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 3 - Starring Goofy"
