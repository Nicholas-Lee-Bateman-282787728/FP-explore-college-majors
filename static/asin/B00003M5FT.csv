Kate (kari Wuhrer) hears her only real friend Sara (Farrah Forke) is getting married, since Kate is in love with Sara this is bad news. So Kate heads off to pay her a visit - complete with gun.  However being close to Sara only strenthens Kates fixation, so much so that Kate turns to flirtation, lying, even murder, in order to win Sara's love.

Once Kate has killed off her competition, and oozed her way into Sara's life, she seems to have Sara all to herself. Uh-oh! Sara has a new boyfriend!

This is a rather  cheesy production featuring two attractive actresses in an obvious attempt  at sexploitation for commercial gain.Kate (Kari Wuhrer) is obsessed with  Sara (Farrah Forke), her best friend from high school and college.  They  were going to open a business together in their hometown of New Orleans  until Sara went to California and met a guy.  So, Kate goes to visit her  plotting to break them up.  What follows is a twisted tale and lesbian  seduction, blackmail and murder, just to name a few of the evils Kate  employs to keep Sara close to her.The writing and direction by Eric  Delebarre in his first feature film was second rate.  The plot is thin and  contrived, stretching credulity repeatedly.  This has B movie stamped all  over it; poor sound and cinematography and a general low budget look.The  hook here was the lesbian seduction scene where Kate gets Sara stoned and  then ravishes her.  This was obviously a male fantasy lesbian scene, where  Sara is taken by a predator rather than having sex by mutual consent.  From  that standpoint, most male viewers will likely be disappointed since it  shows little more than kissing and groping with everything covered.The  acting was mediocre to poor.  Kari Wuhrer lacked subtlety and duplicity as  the antagonist.  Her body language and sarcastic delivery made her motives  so obvious that it was impossible to believe that the other characters  wouldn't have noticed sooner.  Farrah Forke was better than Wuhrer.  She  gave a very sincere presentation of her character, albeit overly nave.  Her unaffectedness and spontaneity made the romance scenes with her  boyfriend work well.  The rest of the acting was mundane.This film has  little to recommend it.  I rated it a 3/10.  The story was weak and the  filmmaking weaker.  For viewers looking for sexual stimulation, there are  plenty of superior alternatives",2,Cheesy sexploitation flick.,965088000,"08 1, 2000",2000,2023,"['so', 'often', 'like', 'rummage', 'minor', 'titles', 'see', 'can', 'find', 'sleeper', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'missed', 'mark', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'production', 'featuring', 'two', 'attractive', 'actresses', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'sexploitation', 'commercial', 'gain.Kate', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'obsessed', 'Sara', 'Farrah', 'Forke', 'best', 'friend', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'were', 'going', 'open', 'business', 'together', 'hometown', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Sara', 'went', 'California', 'met', 'guy', 'So', 'Kate', 'visit', 'plotting', 'break', 'up', 'What', 'twisted', 'tale', 'lesbian', 'seduction', 'blackmail', 'murder', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'evils', 'Kate', 'keep', 'Sara', 'close', 'her.The', 'writing', 'direction', 'Eric', 'Delebarre', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'was', 'second', 'rate', 'plot', 'thin', 'contrived', 'stretching', 'credulity', 'repeatedly', 'B', 'movie', 'stamped', 'poor', 'sound', 'cinematography', 'general', 'low', 'budget', 'look.The', 'hook', 'here', 'was', 'lesbian', 'seduction', 'scene', 'where', 'Kate', 'Sara', 'stoned', 'then', 'was', 'obviously', 'male', 'fantasy', 'lesbian', 'scene', 'where', 'Sara', 'taken', 'predator', 'rather', 'having', 'sex', 'mutual', 'consent', 'standpoint', 'most', 'male', 'viewers', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'little', 'more', 'kissing', 'groping', 'everything', 'covered.The', 'acting', 'was', 'mediocre', 'poor', 'Kari', 'Wuhrer', 'lacked', 'subtlety', 'duplicity', 'antagonist', 'body', 'language', 'sarcastic', 'delivery', 'made', 'motives', 'so', 'obvious', 'was', 'impossible', 'believe', 'other', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'noticed', 'sooner', 'Farrah', 'Forke', 'was', 'better', 'Wuhrer', 'gave', 'very', 'sincere', 'presentation', 'character', 'overly', 'nave', 'unaffectedness', 'spontaneity', 'made', 'romance', 'scenes', 'boyfriend', 'work', 'well', 'rest', 'acting', 'was', 'mundane.This', 'film', 'little', 'recommend', 'rated', '3/10', 'story', 'was', 'weak', 'filmmaking', 'weaker', 'viewers', 'looking', 'sexual', 'stimulation', 'are', 'plenty', 'superior', 'alternatives']",N/A

Two breast shots including one nibble and two soap bubble nipples thrown in probably to assure an R rating. Otherwise it is quit tame in sex, violence, language and drug use with drug use being the most frequent rating violation. And there is a lesbian sex scene in which I could not tell if the straps were up or if straps were down because they were both alternating between cuts but I wouldn't imagine the budget of this film included a script supervisor.Overall it looked pretty good with rich images, variation in scene lighting and attractive actors. Editing includes a couple scenes in which the dialog fades to black while the scene continues with background music. These are effective with your imagination filling in the dialog rather than sitting through the blah, blah, blah of the written dialog.So if you have an hour and a half with nothing else going on, don't mind a movie that does not challenge the mind or the eye and are mostly predictable than this one is probably worth a look, there are many, worse movies I've watched.",2,It filled a little time on a night when nothing else was going on,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1166,"['Interesting', 'not', 'unique', 'approach', 'obsession', 'film', 'Story', 'line', 'acting', 'weak', 'times', 'others', 'adequate', 'Two', 'breast', 'shots', 'including', 'one', 'nibble', 'two', 'soap', 'bubble', 'nipples', 'thrown', 'probably', 'assure', 'R', 'rating', 'Otherwise', 'quit', 'tame', 'sex', 'violence', 'language', 'drug', 'use', 'drug', 'use', 'being', 'most', 'frequent', 'rating', 'violation', 'lesbian', 'sex', 'scene', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'straps', 'were', 'up', 'straps', 'were', 'down', 'were', 'alternating', 'cuts', 'would', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'budget', 'film', 'included', 'script', 'supervisor.Overall', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'rich', 'images', 'variation', 'scene', 'lighting', 'attractive', 'actors', 'Editing', 'couple', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'black', 'scene', 'background', 'music', 'are', 'effective', 'imagination', 'filling', 'dialog', 'rather', 'sitting', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'written', 'dialog.So', 'have', 'hour', 'half', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'not', 'challenge', 'mind', 'eye', 'are', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'one', 'probably', 'worth', 'look', 'are', 'many', 'worse', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched']",N/A

Now that I've seen the movie, I'm more convinced than ever that I should be making these  movies instead of the jabones who are making them now. The plot was decent,  but it was erratic, and uneven. Too often I felt like the filmmaker strung  clips together. Once the movie got going, I sort of got into it. Kari  Wuhrer is as beautiful as she is convincing in the role of the psycho. When  the two did finally meet, it was too short, too R, and not steamy enough. I  mean, come on. You have two gorgeous actresses--let them act!  Overall, the  movie was a letdown.
