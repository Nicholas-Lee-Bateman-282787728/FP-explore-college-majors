1404486,A1FG0JLFW5GXV7,B004EQAVAU,"Dr. John L. Takeuchi Turner ""JLT""","[27, 31]","Afterlife is a study about the great question, ""What happens when we die?"" Answers to this question are examined in a study of the near-death experience (NDE) and the inescapable conclusion is reached, that there is no need to fear death: There is an afterlife. This is a profound statement and this documentary DVD presents evidence which director Paul Perry and researchers Raymond Moody and Jeffrey Long believe will support this conclusion.Beginning with Mr. Paul Perry's own NDE, ""Afterlife"" examines the phenomenon of near death experiences beginning with a sampling of the general public in a series of on-the-street interviews, that describe a wide range of beliefs, varying from heaven and hell, to beliefs of a nothingless-like void; like the switching off of a light and a stark emptiness and non-awareness that follows. This is, I believe, a good sample of US residents that show how very few of us have any proof to substantiate our beliefs and conclusions about the afterlife. Most of us have hunch or a feeling that we believe in, often coinciding with elements of the Christian faith.Noted experts in the field, Dr. Raymond Moody (author ofLife After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death, andGlimpses of Eternity (Mind Body Spirit)) and Dr. Jeffrey long (Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences), are interviewed, and their work is reviewed regarding NDE and the conclusions that they have reached, based upon hundreds of case reviews. Dr. Long, for example, believes that his ""Nine Lines of Evidence"" clearly demonstrate survival of consciousness beyond the death of the physical body. Dr. Moody concludes that in his experience, learning to love is the message conveyed.In this entertaining and informative DVD, six NDE cases are examined, and the experiencers are interviewed. Some of them describe the commonly talked about LIGHT at the end of the tunnel, a pure, beautiful, loving and healing light. All but one, felt a longing to stay in this light and did not want to return to their physical body.What does this video documentary teach us about dying? By means of those who have almost died, it can be concluded that:1.) There is no longer a fear of dying2.) A transformational process occurs following the NDE, in which the meaning of life is questioned.  Many go on to become of service to others.3.) Being out of the physical body, they perceive themselves as having a spiritual or light body.4.)  A sense of heightened awareness is present during the NDE.5.) A beautiful  loving light is encountered.6.) Reports of seeing deceased family members are common.7.) Encounters with a spiritual beings are often described.8.) The most important thing that we must do ,is to learn to love.Along with Dr. Long, Dr. Moody, the ""Father of near-death experiences,"" is prominently featured in this documentary. He first coined the term NDE in his 1976 book, Life After Life. His recent work involving Shared Death Experiences (nicely discussed in Glimpses of Eternity) describes the reports of bystanders who experience some of the key elements of the NDE that are happening to their departing loved one. This demonstrates that elements described in the NDE, are not simply hallucinations induced in a dying brain, but actual events during the death or near-death process. As a result of many years of research, he has come to realize that what we learn from NDE reports is that there is a power, and that power is LOVE. He believes when proof of life after death is revealed to humanity, it will lead to a wonderful expansion of our cognitive minds.What is the conclusion of Afterlife?There is no need to fear death. A world exists beyond this one, a dimension where we can continue our relationships with our departed loved ones and that perhaps at death, our life has just begun.I highly recommend this interesting DVD to all who ponder the question ""What happens when we die?""Dr. John L.

1404491,AOPQ0KA1B7BFD,B004EQAVAU,Ray Gray,"[36, 37]","I'm surprised it appears no NDE'ers have given their review of the video.  I'll do so.I had my NDE resulting from a 125mph crash on a motorcycle when I was in my mid-20s.  At the time I was an agnostic, though churched most Sundays until I left for university. My last thought before I crashed was ""this is it, you're dead.""  My first conscious thoughts, which felt more like truths, twelve hours later when I awoke in the hospital were ""I've been someplace else.  There is a God.  And I am alive for a purpose.""  Honestly, I didn't remember anything else at the time but I knew there had been more.  I succumbed once more in the hospital but all I remember from that circumstance were beings bathed in light who were helping me.  I have no problem chalking that up to shock, but who knows.  Eight weeks later, while very much alive and having a nose-to-nose verbal fight with a recovery counselor it was like someone shut off the lights and in a nanosecond every circumstance of my life that contributed to the motorcycle crash, from early childhood to the night of the crash, flashed before my eyes in perfect clarity as if I was reliving them again.  The lights came back on and I was speechless.  The argument ended instantly and the counselor looked at me and said ""what the (blank) just happened to you?""There is too much more to list how I explored my NDE experience for more than a decade afterward.  I feel like I have amnesia about the details of the NDE, but books and films that get it right leave me with overwhelming feelings of truth about what I have forgotten.  Like stated in the film, I have no fear of death and feel constantly connected to possibilities, for lack of a better word, that exist on the other side.The film has some technical issues, like I had no idea who the host was.  I had to pause the film when he showed his books to find the common name on each of them.  Yeah, and there was the misspelling.  Hey, maybe Freud spelled it wrong!As an NDE'er I often sobbed during the film while listening to the NDE'ers give their testimonials.  I can't explain it adequately, but there is an emptiness once you return of a completeness of Love, Knowledge, and Self that was overwhelmingly present on the other side.  The film touches on it but those without an NDE probably won't recognize it.  My wife, a non-NDE'er who endured my recovery and participated in my explorations, found the film educational, informative, but not necessary convincing or compelling.  Given the differences in her perspective and mine, including the differences in our reactions, I gave the film 4 stars because it could have been better.One word of advice, if you limit your expression of loving contribution in any way, or allow yourself to be limited by others in any form, you may not fulfill or reveal your true purpose.  That's been my constant challenge because I tend to acquiesce to authority, both real and imagined.  We all have a purpose but understanding it isn't an easy process.  Heck, 34 years later I'm still searching for mine but I've learned to enjoy the adventures along the way.",4,"Hmmm, not one review from an NDE'er, until now?",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,3104,"[""'m"", 'surprised', ""NDE'ers"", 'have', 'given', 'review', 'video', ""'ll"", 'do', 'so.I', 'had', 'NDE', 'resulting', '125mph', 'crash', 'motorcycle', 'when', 'was', 'mid-20s', 'time', 'was', 'agnostic', 'though', 'churched', 'most', 'Sundays', 'left', 'university', 'My', 'last', 'thought', 'crashed', 'was', ""'re"", 'dead', 'first', 'conscious', 'thoughts', 'felt', 'more', 'truths', 'twelve', 'hours', 'later', 'when', 'awoke', 'hospital', 'were', ""'ve"", 'been', 'someplace', 'else', 'God', 'am', 'alive', 'purpose', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'else', 'time', 'knew', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'succumbed', 'once', 'more', 'hospital', 'remember', 'circumstance', 'were', 'beings', 'bathed', 'light', 'who', 'were', 'helping', 'have', 'problem', 'chalking', 'up', 'shock', 'who', 'Eight', 'weeks', 'later', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'having', 'nose-to-nose', 'verbal', 'fight', 'recovery', 'counselor', 'was', 'someone', 'shut', 'off', 'lights', 'nanosecond', 'circumstance', 'life', 'contributed', 'motorcycle', 'crash', 'early', 'childhood', 'night', 'crash', 'flashed', 'eyes', 'perfect', 'clarity', 'was', 'reliving', 'again', 'lights', 'came', 'back', 'was', 'speechless', 'argument', 'ended', 'instantly', 'counselor', 'looked', 'said', 'what', 'blank', 'just', 'happened', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'list', 'how', 'explored', 'NDE', 'experience', 'more', 'decade', 'afterward', 'feel', 'have', 'amnesia', 'details', 'NDE', 'books', 'films', 'get', 'right', 'leave', 'overwhelming', 'feelings', 'truth', 'what', 'have', 'forgotten', 'stated', 'film', 'have', 'fear', 'death', 'feel', 'constantly', 'connected', 'possibilities', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'exist', 'other', 'side.The', 'film', 'technical', 'issues', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'host', 'was', 'had', 'pause', 'film', 'when', 'showed', 'books', 'find', 'common', 'name', 'Yeah', 'was', 'misspelling', 'Hey', 'maybe', 'Freud', 'spelled', 'wrong', ""NDE'er"", 'often', 'sobbed', 'film', 'listening', ""NDE'ers"", 'give', 'testimonials', 'ca', ""n't"", 'explain', 'adequately', 'emptiness', 'once', 'return', 'completeness', 'Love', 'Knowledge', 'Self', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'present', 'other', 'side', 'film', 'touches', 'NDE', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'My', 'wife', ""non-NDE'er"", 'who', 'endured', 'recovery', 'participated', 'explorations', 'found', 'film', 'educational', 'informative', 'not', 'necessary', 'convincing', 'compelling', 'Given', 'differences', 'perspective', 'mine', 'including', 'differences', 'reactions', 'gave', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better.One', 'word', 'advice', 'limit', 'expression', 'loving', 'contribution', 'way', 'allow', 'be', 'limited', 'others', 'form', 'may', 'not', 'fulfill', 'reveal', 'true', 'purpose', 'been', 'constant', 'challenge', 'tend', 'acquiesce', 'authority', 'real', 'imagined', 'have', 'purpose', 'understanding', ""n't"", 'easy', 'process', 'Heck', '34', 'years', 'later', ""'m"", 'still', 'searching', 'mine', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'enjoy', 'adventures', 'way']",N/A

However I have noticed that these authors mostly focus only on positive near-death experiences. Therefore I'm not surprised that Paul Perry has produced an almost completely positive documentary about life after life. The only time you will hear about hell is from people interviewed on the street. I've read books on hellish near-death experiences and I think Paul Perry should have included at least one interview with someone who didn't go to heaven. What you will learn from this documentary is that the purpose of life is to learn to love. Many people who have a near-death experience become more compassionate. The people interviewed all seemed to describe the same basic experience which was being out of their bodies as a soul and then moving towards a bright light that felt loving. A few people talk about a life review and some talk about meeting relatives or spiritual beings. Frankly while this only tells half the story it was still mesmerizing. I really enjoyed watching the interviews with Jeffery Long and Raymond Moody. If you have any interest in what happens after we die I think you will find this intriguing. But for more details you will have to read books on the subject. This is a good overview and has some interesting interviews.

1404493,A2SSKER1T8047B,B004EQAVAU,Riaan,"[2, 3]","If you're going to present a case for the hereafter it has to be much more compelling than ""Afterlife"", an unappealing and poorly constructed documentary.To begin with, Dr. Jeffrey Long, a so-called scientist/expert in the field of Near Death Experiences is asked to present what he considers proof for the hereafter. Dr. Long collects near death experiences from random visitors to his website and presents their stories as evidence of an afterlife. He doesn't view their medical records, nor does he consult with their doctors.Few scientists or medical professionals are consulted for this film. Where are the NDE heavyweights? Where is Dr. Bruce Greyson, Dr. Kenneth Ring, or Dr. Peter Fenwick? These are highly respected NDE researchers who have time and again silenced the skeptics with their articulate, logical and scientific arguments.Dr. Raymond Moody's presence lends the film some credibility. I enjoyed watching him. But I'm afraid there's little else in the form of substance here. You begin to feel that the producers of ""Beyond and Back"" could have done a better job with the material. That's an insult, by the way.The film focuses on a few people who have had near death experiences, but their cases are briefly dealt with, in the form of an overview, which is too concise to make you really connect with their stories and experiences. There's another thing - brevity. The film is much too short. If you wish to present a case for the afterlife, seventy minutes won't do.An irritating aspect of this film is the annoying messages which keep popping up on the screen. They are written bullet points which pops up on the screen while an interviewee speaks, reminding you what has just been said, in case you are brain dead.One truly feels that a professional filmmaker should have been involved here.
