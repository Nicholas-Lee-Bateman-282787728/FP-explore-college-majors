862734,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00067HP0U,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[40, 40]","I have the VHS version of this video, which was originally packaged under the name ""Body Reform:  Abdominals and Back."" This 44-minute, all-floor routine is a blend of Pilates, yoga, and traditional abs and back work. You'll find many classic Pilates moves such as the hundred and single leg circles, but many of the exercises are done with a twist--eg, modified corkscrew and modified teasers. Similarly, instructor Karen Voight incoporates movement into traditionally static yoga poses such as bridge and boat pose, and finally, she includes some traditional crunches and back work. The result is a smooth, flowing routine that will leave your entire body feeling thoroughly stretched and relaxed.Although this workout is somewhat similar to the abs portion of Karen's Streamline Fitness video, it is more relaxing and less intense. However, during the last 8 minutes of the tape, Karen offers suggestions on how to incorporate her resist-a-ring (or other Pilates/fitness circle) into the routine, which would definitely make it a more challenging workout. Karen is a great instructor who is warm and friendly while still providing excellent cuing and precise instructions on allignment. She works with an assistant, Sara, who displays more advanced versions of the exercises for those wanting a greater challenge. I use this workout regularly, and I highly recommend it to others of all fitness levels.",5,This workout leaves me feeling GREAT!,1097625600,"10 13, 2004",2004,1405,"['have', 'VHS', 'version', 'video', 'was', 'originally', 'packaged', 'name', 'Body', 'Reform', 'Abdominals', 'Back', '44-minute', 'all-floor', 'routine', 'blend', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'traditional', 'abs', 'back', 'work', ""'ll"", 'find', 'many', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'such', 'hundred', 'single', 'leg', 'circles', 'many', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', 'twist', 'eg', 'modified', 'corkscrew', 'modified', 'teasers', 'Similarly', 'instructor', 'Karen', 'Voight', 'movement', 'traditionally', 'static', 'yoga', 'poses', 'such', 'bridge', 'boat', 'pose', 'finally', 'traditional', 'crunches', 'back', 'work', 'result', 'smooth', 'flowing', 'routine', 'will', 'leave', 'entire', 'body', 'feeling', 'thoroughly', 'stretched', 'workout', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'abs', 'portion', 'Karen', 'Streamline', 'Fitness', 'video', 'more', 'relaxing', 'less', 'intense', 'However', 'last', '8', 'minutes', 'tape', 'Karen', 'suggestions', 'how', 'incorporate', 'resist-a-ring', 'other', 'Pilates/fitness', 'circle', 'routine', 'would', 'definitely', 'make', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'Karen', 'great', 'instructor', 'who', 'warm', 'friendly', 'still', 'providing', 'excellent', 'cuing', 'precise', 'instructions', 'allignment', 'assistant', 'Sara', 'who', 'more', 'advanced', 'versions', 'exercises', 'wanting', 'greater', 'challenge', 'use', 'workout', 'regularly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'others', 'fitness', 'levels']",N/A

The moves can be challenging and you may not pick it up first go.  You'll definately increase your range of flexibility and you'll strengthen your core muscles.  Karen is definately one of the best cuers and instructors out there.  She's great at letting you know what's up next and she has a soft spoken and friendly way of getting those instructions out.  You are working the abs and back at most/all of the time and before you know it, you're done.  She keeps you busy from start to end and you have fun while you're at it.Don't get frustrated if you don't get it first time around.

This morning I performed the full routine for the first time. It's a GREAT ab workout - all the pilates-inspired moves engage the core, and there are traditional crunches thrown in to ensure you feel it. The back section was similarly challenging and strengthening. However, the rest of me felt short-changed (no leg kicks, double leg stretches, plank etc). It's therefore faithful to its title, but on it's own, it's too easy -- I will be adding this on to the end of tougher workouts when I want to work my abs.",4,"Easy, even for a beginner",1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,631,"['am', '6', 'weeks', 'new', 'fitness', 'lifestyle', 'working', '5', 'time', 'more', 'week', 'still', 'consider', 'beginner', 'morning', 'performed', 'full', 'routine', 'first', 'time', 'GREAT', 'ab', 'pilates-inspired', 'moves', 'engage', 'core', 'are', 'traditional', 'crunches', 'thrown', 'ensure', 'feel', 'back', 'section', 'was', 'similarly', 'challenging', 'strengthening', 'However', 'rest', 'felt', 'short-changed', 'leg', 'double', 'leg', 'stretches', 'plank', 'etc', 'therefore', 'faithful', 'title', 'own', 'too', 'easy', 'will', 'be', 'adding', 'end', 'tougher', 'workouts', 'when', 'want', 'work', 'abs']",N/A
862738,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00067HP0U,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[8, 8]","Are you looking for a workout to strengthen the ""powerhouse"" area of your body? That area from which all movements should begin. Karen has designed this beautifully and as you zero in on your abdominals, you also focus on strengthening your back.This is a 50-minute ALL-floor workout. You alternate between abdominal sculpting and simple back-strengthening and stretching moves to create a more balance and stable center. Karen combines the teachings of Joseph Pilates, yoga, and ballet with her own body-sculpting techniques.""Imagine your body, no matter its shape, having the posture, lightness and elegance of a dancer."" ~Karen VoightThis will help you create a more stable center. You will find yourself sitting up taller and this particular video left me lying on the floor watching the second half because after you finish this workout, you know you have worked out.There is a small bonus section which shows how you can incorporate the Resist-a-Ring into your workout. I didn't find that part of the video that appealing as there was no music and you would have to remember how to do all the moves. It might be useful for those who are very experienced with the moves Karen has developed. I would have rather seen them incorporated into the video in a more organized fashion.For this workout you will only need a yoga mat and a towel. This helps to give you enough padding if you are working on a carpeted surface. Karen does sell a body reform mat if you are working out on a hard floor.If you love this workout, you will also enjoy Core Essentials and Total Body Training. They are all great fun and really motivate you with a great combination of creativity and enjoyable music.I feel completely relaxed after doing any of the Body Reform workouts. They have a wonderful balancing effect on my emotions and my mind seems to be free of distraction. As if the cares of the world just drift away with Karen's magical calming voice.You will just love some of these moves if you work on the computer all day. It is amazing how tight your shoulders and chest can become. This workout will open out your chest and stretch that tired back.Definitely Intermediate in some exercises, but mostly this is for anyone. There is one move, you might want to consider skipping. It is the one where you are raising your back off the floor and you then raise one leg up into the air. It is tricky, tricky. I would not recommend it for anyone who is not practicing yoga on a regular basis!This girl knows how to get you motivated. Just looking at her body makes me wish I had her motivation! She is just amazing. I can't wait for more Karen Videos. I want them ALL! And I am dying for her to make a really long and wonderfully relaxing stretch video. The one I have is good, but I would love to see her do a really creative outdoor video with tons of stretching. Something that would just help you drift away.If you enjoy this workout, look for The Method workouts. They havesimilar movements and are a bit more advanced and intense.~The Rebecca Review",5,Strengthen the Powerhouse,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,3042,"['Are', 'looking', 'workout', 'strengthen', 'powerhouse', 'area', 'body', 'area', 'movements', 'should', 'begin', 'Karen', 'designed', 'beautifully', 'zero', 'abdominals', 'also', 'focus', 'strengthening', 'back.This', '50-minute', 'ALL-floor', 'workout', 'alternate', 'abdominal', 'sculpting', 'simple', 'back-strengthening', 'stretching', 'moves', 'create', 'more', 'balance', 'stable', 'center', 'Karen', 'teachings', 'Joseph', 'Pilates', 'yoga', 'ballet', 'own', 'body-sculpting', 'techniques', 'Imagine', 'body', 'matter', 'shape', 'having', 'posture', 'lightness', 'elegance', 'dancer', 'VoightThis', 'will', 'help', 'create', 'more', 'stable', 'center', 'will', 'find', 'sitting', 'up', 'taller', 'particular', 'video', 'left', 'lying', 'floor', 'watching', 'second', 'half', 'finish', 'workout', 'know', 'have', 'worked', 'small', 'bonus', 'section', 'how', 'can', 'incorporate', 'Resist-a-Ring', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'part', 'video', 'appealing', 'was', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'remember', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'experienced', 'moves', 'Karen', 'developed', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'incorporated', 'video', 'more', 'organized', 'fashion.For', 'workout', 'will', 'only', 'need', 'yoga', 'mat', 'towel', 'give', 'enough', 'padding', 'are', 'working', 'carpeted', 'surface', 'Karen', 'sell', 'body', 'reform', 'mat', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'hard', 'floor.If', 'love', 'workout', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Core', 'Essentials', 'Total', 'Body', 'Training', 'are', 'great', 'fun', 'really', 'motivate', 'great', 'combination', 'creativity', 'enjoyable', 'music.I', 'feel', 'completely', 'relaxed', 'doing', 'Body', 'Reform', 'have', 'wonderful', 'balancing', 'effect', 'emotions', 'mind', 'be', 'free', 'distraction', 'cares', 'world', 'just', 'drift', 'away', 'Karen', 'magical', 'calming', 'voice.You', 'will', 'just', 'love', 'moves', 'work', 'computer', 'day', 'amazing', 'how', 'tight', 'shoulders', 'chest', 'can', 'become', 'workout', 'will', 'open', 'out', 'chest', 'stretch', 'tired', 'back.Definitely', 'Intermediate', 'exercises', 'mostly', 'anyone', 'one', 'move', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'skipping', 'one', 'where', 'are', 'raising', 'back', 'floor', 'then', 'raise', 'one', 'leg', 'up', 'air', 'tricky', 'tricky', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'regular', 'basis', 'girl', 'how', 'get', 'motivated', 'Just', 'looking', 'body', 'wish', 'had', 'motivation', 'just', 'amazing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more', 'Karen', 'Videos', 'want', 'am', 'dying', 'make', 'really', 'long', 'wonderfully', 'relaxing', 'stretch', 'video', 'one', 'have', 'good', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'do', 'really', 'creative', 'outdoor', 'video', 'tons', 'stretching', 'Something', 'would', 'just', 'help', 'drift', 'enjoy', 'workout', 'look', 'Method', 'workouts', 'havesimilar', 'movements', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'advanced', 'intense.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
