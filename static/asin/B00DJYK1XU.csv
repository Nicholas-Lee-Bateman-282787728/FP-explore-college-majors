You also get other great characters like Aunt Fran, Vint and Naomi.  Sometimes daughters Ellen and Eunice show up, just adding to the fun.  You can't go wrong with this set of shows, which are entertaining and always fun to watch, especially the show where Thelma gets hit in the head by a pot that she uses to make her famous gooseberry jam, leaving her with amnesia, and her daughters Eunice and Ellen plus daughter-in-law Naomi all have different stories explaining to Vint just how it happened.  I've been waiting a long time for this second set of &#34;Mama's Family&#34; shows and they were worth the wait.  My only complaints are Harvey Korman's little intro scenes at the beginning of each show, which are boring and not very funny, and the &#34;new house&#34; shown when the show comes on:  it sure isn't the nice, large house Thelma had the First Season.

They did a great job with the extras, such as the Harvey Korman original NBC intros as Allistar Quince, as well as the closing credits with the characters telling jokes.  However, that being said they fell short on a few episodes by editing them, specifically ""Gert Rides Again"" with Imogene Cocoa they completely cut out the song and dance routine Gert and Mama did to ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" and also in the Mama For Mayor episode they deleted Mama's song ""Harper Days are Here again"".  Very disappointing.  Anything with even a few lyrics to a song was edited out. I guess they didn't want to have to pay for the rights to the songs, but it is a shame to edit out the episodes when they are so well done.

Unfortunately, many fans (rightfully) cried foul when it was revealed that syndicated cuts of those shows were all we'd be getting. And so, without the complete episodes on-hand for release (rumour has it there were legal entanglement issues about ownership with the Joe Hamilton estate regarding those full-length episodes), the series was abandoned.SUMMER 2013: Star-Vista Entertainment (formerly Time-Life) has acquired all six seasons of MAMA on the heels of their successful CAROL BURNETT SHOW releases and have already been taking pre-orders for several months now for MAMA'S FAMILY: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION. Die-hard fans of this hilarious old-fashioned '80s comedy classic couldn't click that pre-order button fast enough--even with the extravagant $200 price tag. But for those on a budget, here it is, the fantastic sophomore season that originally aired on NBC during the 1983-84 TV season.Unlike the 2006 botched Season One release, this set will indeed include those amusing, pompous introductions by 'your host' Alistair Quince (Harvey Korman) which haven't been seen in 30 years since the show aired in prime time. It's a little thing but means so much to Classic TV fans like myself.Among the 22 episodes on this set are some of the series funniest, most memorable installments such as RASHOMAMA (the gooseberry jam episode), THE FLAMING FORTIES (Mama, Aunt Fran and Naomi lip-synch to the Andrews Sisters), MAMA BUYS A CAR, BLACK BELT MAMA and THE MAMA WHO CAME TO DINNER. Many belly laughs to be had in these shows and many others. The fabulous Carol Burnett and Betty White make their last regular appearances in this season (White appears in only one Season Three show before fully immersing herself in THE GOLDEN GIRLS) and that too makes it a must-have for Eunice and Ellen lovers.If you love this show, I'd recommend ordering the COMPLETE COLLECTION instead of this, but for those who want a less-expensive option or didn't really care for the Iola and Bubba characters (and how you could you NOT??) this is the set for you.As a Bonus Feature, you also get the 90-minute TV special EUNICE that ran on CBS in March of 1982 which grabbed such big ratings, it prompted the producers to throw this series together in the first place!FIVE STARS and one of the best seasons of MAMA'S FAMILY.",5,For Those Who Can't Afford The Complete Series,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,2479,"['taken', 'over', 'seven', 'years', 'FINALLY', 'fans', 'are', 'getting', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pining', '2006', 'when', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'released', 'first', '13-episode', 'season', 'MAMA', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'fans', 'rightfully', 'cried', 'foul', 'when', 'was', 'revealed', 'syndicated', 'cuts', 'shows', 'were', ""'d"", 'be', 'getting', 'so', 'complete', 'episodes', 'on-hand', 'release', 'rumour', 'were', 'legal', 'entanglement', 'issues', 'ownership', 'Joe', 'Hamilton', 'estate', 'regarding', 'full-length', 'episodes', 'series', 'was', 'abandoned.SUMMER', '2013', 'Star-Vista', 'Entertainment', 'formerly', 'Time-Life', 'acquired', 'six', 'seasons', 'MAMA', 'heels', 'successful', 'CAROL', 'BURNETT', 'SHOW', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'taking', 'pre-orders', 'several', 'months', 'now', 'MAMA', 'FAMILY', 'COMPLETE', 'COLLECTION', 'Die-hard', 'fans', 'hilarious', 'old-fashioned', ""'80s"", 'comedy', 'classic', 'could', ""n't"", 'click', 'pre-order', 'button', 'fast', 'enough', 'even', 'extravagant', '200', 'price', 'tag', 'budget', 'here', 'fantastic', 'sophomore', 'season', 'originally', 'aired', 'NBC', '1983-84', 'TV', '2006', 'botched', 'Season', 'One', 'release', 'set', 'will', 'indeed', 'include', 'amusing', 'pompous', 'introductions', ""'your"", 'host', 'Alistair', 'Quince', 'Harvey', 'Korman', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', '30', 'years', 'show', 'aired', 'prime', 'time', 'little', 'thing', 'so', 'much', 'Classic', 'TV', 'fans', 'myself.Among', '22', 'episodes', 'set', 'are', 'series', 'funniest', 'most', 'memorable', 'installments', 'such', 'RASHOMAMA', 'gooseberry', 'jam', 'episode', 'THE', 'FLAMING', 'FORTIES', 'Mama', 'Aunt', 'Fran', 'Naomi', 'lip-synch', 'Andrews', 'Sisters', 'MAMA', 'BUYS', 'A', 'CAR', 'BLACK', 'BELT', 'MAMA', 'THE', 'MAMA', 'WHO', 'CAME', 'TO', 'DINNER', 'Many', 'belly', 'be', 'had', 'shows', 'many', 'others', 'fabulous', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Betty', 'White', 'make', 'last', 'regular', 'appearances', 'season', 'White', 'only', 'one', 'Season', 'Three', 'show', 'fully', 'immersing', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'GIRLS', 'too', 'must-have', 'Eunice', 'Ellen', 'lovers.If', 'love', 'show', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'ordering', 'COMPLETE', 'COLLECTION', 'instead', 'who', 'want', 'less-expensive', 'option', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Iola', 'Bubba', 'characters', 'how', 'could', 'NOT', 'set', 'you.As', 'Bonus', 'Feature', 'also', 'get', '90-minute', 'TV', 'special', 'EUNICE', 'ran', 'CBS', 'March', '1982', 'grabbed', 'such', 'big', 'ratings', 'prompted', 'producers', 'throw', 'series', 'together', 'first', 'place', 'FIVE', 'STARS', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'MAMA', 'FAMILY']",Mama's Family: Season 2
1656955,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00DJYK1XU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 16]","Beginning in 1983, NBC brought the popular ""The Family"" sketches from The Carol Burnett Show to life with this raucous sitcom based on those unforgettable characters. In most cases, the sketch format never quite succeeds when extended beyond a few minutes (witness the slate of failed SNL movies), but there was something inherently relatable about the tacky and confrontational Harper clan that struck a chord with America. We could laugh at the over-the-top spectacle while still seeing the heart and truth underneath their wild shenanigans. The show lasted an impressive six seasons, and has lived on in perpetuity in syndication. Earlier efforts to bring Mama to the DVD market were met with enormous hostility by stalwart fans. The shows were in tatters thanks to the endless cycle of syndication which chopped both the witty introductions and major portions of the program from existence. Star Vista (in conjunction with Time Life) has sought to remedy this injustice with a recent Complete Series release reconfigured from the original Broadcast masters. And while the results may not be perfect (some musical numbers are still notably absent), this is probably as good as it's going to get. If you aren't able to pick up the financial burden of the Complete Series (current suggested price 199.95), Seasons One and Two have been dropped individually.The Season Two release has all twenty-two episodes spread over 4 discs with a couple of worthwhile Bonus Features:Bonus Content:1) Mama's Family Tree: The Roots Featurette: All About Mama and Fran2) TV Movie ""Eunice"" from 19823) Vicki Lawrence Interviews Mama, Carol Burnett, and Betty WhiteEpisode List:1) Flaming Forties2) The Return of Leonard Oates3) Country Club4) Naomi and The Stork5) Rashomama6) Obscene Call7) Ellen's Boyfriend8) Aunt Gert Rides Again9) Amateur Night10) The Mama Who Came To Dinner11) Mama Learns To Drive12) Black Belt Mama13) Mama Buys A Car14) Supermarket15) No Room At The Inn16) Mama For Mayor, Part One17) Mama For Mayor, Part Two18) Harper Versus Harper19) Mama's Birthday20) Mama Cries Uncle21) Ask Aunt Fran22) A Grave MistakeThe success of ""Mama's Family,"" and its enduring popularity, rests with a great cast (many held over from Carol Burnett days). This was, perhaps, the role that defined Vicki Lawrence's career and will forever be associated with her. As the stubborn matriarch Thelma Mae Crowley Harper, it's hard to imagine anyone else donning that awful wig, strand of pearls, and housecoat (and I find it hilarious that the show actually won a Costuming EMMY). Of course, the majority of early storylines had Thelma contending with Vint (Ken Berry) and his new bride (Dorothy Lyman). Lyman became a terrific foil for Lawrence, their antagonism could be legendary. But the show also benefited from an extended cast that featured Rue McClanahan (Fran), Imogene Coca (Gert), Carol Burnett (who made her last appearance as Eunice in Season Two), and Harvey Korman (who made his last appearance as Ed in Season One). As a side note, it's great to see Korman's spiffy introductions as Alistair Quint returned to the DVD!In the end, ""Mama's Family"" is a nostalgic treat for those who loved it the first time around. It's silly, loud, and extremely tacky but also surprisingly lovable. I'm not sure new viewers will embrace it quite as much as those with a personal connection, but the truth behind the family conflict still has resonance. As I mentioned, this may not be the perfect release but it's markedly better than prior DVD iterations.

1656972,A21EGMJ3E78LPV,B00DJYK1XU,"R. Pepper ""DaysFan79""","[13, 14]","Season 2 special features:-The original TV movie Eunice.-Featurette: Mama's Family Tree: The Roots (all about Mama and Fran)-Interviews: Vicki Lawrence interviews Mama; Vicki Lawrence and Carol Burnett; Bette White.Mama's Family is one of those shows that never gets stale. You can watch the episodes over and over and it always manages to entertain. It's a timeless show that has a cartoonish appeal by way of the costumes and production design. The characters are animated and at times exaggerated yet still grounded in truth and the dysfunction is there that people will relate to. Although Raytown is a fantasyland with names like, Ray Mart, McRay's, Ray Lanes, etc. it is reminiscent of middle America. Here we have a group of seasoned professionals, Vicki Lawrence, Betty White, Ken Berry, Dorothy Lyman, Rue McClanahan and Carol Burnett. All these people have a natural gift for comedy. You don't see much of that anymore. This show is just as funny as it was 30 years ago.Highlights from Season 2 of Mama's Family include Country Club where highfalutin Ellen (Betty White) has been nominated as Raytown's woman of the year. Little does she know that Vint (Ken Berry), Naomi (Dorothy Lyman) and Mama (Vicki Lawrence) will be crashing the grand event. Anyone who has ever had an embarrassing family member (or family) will appreciate this. Rashomama (Carol Burnett's last appearance) begins in the hospital after Mama has been hit in the head with a big cooking pot. Naomi, Ellen and Eunice (Carol Burnett) each tell their own version to Vint about what really happened so we have a series of hilarious and contradicting flashbacks. Ellen's Boyfriend features Betty White dating a much younger man much to Mama's dismay. The Mama Who Came to Dinner has Vint and Naomi throwing a party for their close friends but Mama ends up throwing her back out and being the center of entertainment.In Mama Learns to Drive, Mama wants a hat that is on sale at the department store but no one wants to take her to get it so she is forced to finally learn how to drive for herself. Supermarket lands Mama a job at the Food Circus working with Naomi which does not go over so well with the family. Mama crashes Vint and Naomi's anniversary honeymoon in No Room at the Inn and ends up spending the night with them. A broken vacuum cleaner and a burnt rug bring Mama and Naomi to court in Harper vs. Harper. Finally, in Mama's Birthday, we get to see Mama on her 30th birthday with a younger Ellen, Eunice and Vint. Tanya Fenmore as little Eunice definitely steals the show here.This show got better after Betty White and Rue McClanahan went on to do The Golden Girls and Beverly Archer was brought in as the prissy next door neighbor Iola and Allan Kayser as Eunice's delinquent son Bubba. Still, there are many episodes to savor in Season 2. Season 3-6 was when the show went into first run syndication where it remained number one the entire four years. The first two seasons were funny, but at times it became too serious and dramatic. After the show was revamped, it became more silly and lighthearted and was a ratings success.

The first season only lasted 13 episodes.It was the second season that displayed Mama's foray into politics as Mayor of Raytown in a two part episode. There were plenty of other memorable episodes in this season including the family on &#34;Family Feud&#34; with the late Richard Dawson. There was the dance at the school where Mama and Aunt Fran became the Andrews Sisters.Sure Mama's Family wasn't first rate in quality but it was sure memorable. This series showed that families aren't perfect nor will they ever be. The first two seasons were my favorite because they included Rue McClanahan, Betty White, Harvey Korman, and Carol Burnett.Ironically the series was canceled after this season. McClanahan and White would go on to do &#34;The Golden Girls&#34; and win Emmys for it.
