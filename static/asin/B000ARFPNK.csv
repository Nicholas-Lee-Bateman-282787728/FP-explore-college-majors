931855,A1FAV0XXATKSYN,B000ARFPNK,"Adrian Kain ""Brainwashed Sheep""","[4, 7]","I wasn't expecting much from the movie itself to tell the truth, but the two main characters (Papass and Tommy) are easily likable, as well as 'Lady', the woman locked in the House of D. The movie unfolds the story smoothly and with some funny moments, mixed up with drama and sad scenes throughout the main character's childhood. The performances are allright, especially those of Anton Yelchin (Tommy Harshaw), perfect for the role, and Erykah Badu (Lady Bernadette), who plays wonderfully a character who's limited to speak to Tommy from the window of a female cellblock. David Duchovny's is ok, considering he's a good actor, I know he could have done better if his own role had been larger: however, it didn't need to be so. Robin Williams plays a retarded janitor, and does a good job at it but it could have been a little better. Now, on to the weak, or weakest point of the movie: the end. I think the end was stretched like rubber, unnecessarily. I was expecting it to end at a certain point, leaving a little work for my own imagination, but instead they kept going and going, and making it worse every second, boring, corny, useless. It is in my opinion about the only weak point this movie had and it wasn't enough to destroy what was built throughout the story, I enjoyed it thoroughly despite the problem I pointed out before.",4,"Beautiful story, unfulfilling sensation",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,1340,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'tell', 'truth', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Papass', 'Tommy', 'are', 'easily', 'likable', 'as', 'well', ""'Lady"", 'woman', 'locked', 'House', 'D.', 'movie', 'story', 'smoothly', 'funny', 'moments', 'mixed', 'up', 'drama', 'sad', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'childhood', 'performances', 'are', 'allright', 'especially', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Tommy', 'Harshaw', 'perfect', 'role', 'Erykah', 'Badu', 'Lady', 'Bernadette', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'character', 'who', 'limited', 'speak', 'Tommy', 'window', 'female', 'cellblock', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'ok', 'considering', 'good', 'actor', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'own', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'larger', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'so', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'retarded', 'janitor', 'good', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'better', 'Now', 'weak', 'weakest', 'point', 'movie', 'end', 'think', 'end', 'was', 'stretched', 'rubber', 'unnecessarily', 'was', 'expecting', 'end', 'certain', 'point', 'leaving', 'little', 'work', 'own', 'imagination', 'instead', 'kept', 'going', 'going', 'making', 'worse', 'second', 'boring', 'corny', 'useless', 'opinion', 'only', 'weak', 'point', 'movie', 'had', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'destroy', 'what', 'was', 'built', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'problem', 'pointed', 'out']",N/A
931856,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B000ARFPNK,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","What a thoroughly charming movie this is! For one thing, there are no real villains, just people whose needs conflict. Well, OK, maybe Pappass's father is rather a nasty piece of work, but Pappass explains that when Tom goes back to visit as a grown-up and the elder Pappass is dead.Tom Warshaw (the adorable Anton Yelchin) turns 13 in 1973, amid a lot of emotional problems, mostly of others. Here he is, an attractive, smart, nice kid who just wants to get along, and everything seems to go against him. His dad died about a year ago, and his mom never got over it. He counts her sedative pills, sleeps under her bed so he can hear her breathe and know she's all right.He's attracted to a charming girl from the co-ed school (both Catholic schools; his is all boys), but messes up by saying something tacky about her that gets reported back to her and all her friends. The love story is sweet because both of the kids are sweet.His best friend is Pappass (Robin Williams), a retarded man who is the janitor at Tom's school and also has a part-time job with Tom delivering for a butcher shop. He and Pappass use one of those bikes with a box on the front, like often used for ice cream vendors, and clown around while they're working.They are collecting their tip money, kept in a metal cash box and buried near the House of D (Detention; women's jail), saving up for a bike. One of the prisoners, who has stashed a broken piece of mirror so she can see out the window, notices them burying the money, and strikes up a conversation. This is not so strange, since prisoners are in the habit of calling out the window to talk to people (usually their pimps) who come to the side of the building and stand under the windows. But Lady, the one with the mirror, is in solitary, and her window is so high up that she can only see out with a mirror. Tom talks to her, and asks her for advice about Melissa, and Lady gives him very sensible advice about what girls like.But when Tom dances with Melissa, Pappass gets mad (jealous, I suppose) and takes the money, and steals a bike. Pappass gets caught and gets fired from his job at the school. But Tom takes the blame, telling the priest who runs the school that he stole it, or rather that Pappass stole it for him. He gets expelled from school, losing his scholarship, and his mother panics.It's down hill from there, until finally Tom flees to Paris to start over. Fast forward 30 years, and he's an adult with a wife and a boy who's about to turn 13. He decides to tell them about his past. He goes back to New York, finds Lady, and then finds Pappass. Then he calls his wife and invites her to bring his son and come to New York to be with him. Pappass takes them to the garden where the House of D used to be. (In the real New York, this is indeed what happened to the building.)It's a very charming movie, and I was completely charmed.",5,Another Triumph for Robin Williams,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2886,"['What', 'thoroughly', 'charming', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'are', 'real', 'villains', 'just', 'people', 'needs', 'conflict', 'Well', 'OK', 'maybe', 'Pappass', 'father', 'rather', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'Pappass', 'when', 'Tom', 'back', 'visit', 'grown-up', 'elder', 'Pappass', 'dead.Tom', 'Warshaw', 'adorable', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', '13', '1973', 'lot', 'emotional', 'problems', 'mostly', 'others', 'Here', 'attractive', 'smart', 'nice', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'get', 'along', 'everything', 'go', 'dad', 'died', 'year', 'ago', 'mom', 'never', 'got', 'sedative', 'pills', 'sleeps', 'bed', 'can', 'hear', 'breathe', 'know', 'right.He', 'attracted', 'charming', 'girl', 'co-ed', 'school', 'Catholic', 'schools', 'boys', 'up', 'saying', 'something', 'tacky', 'reported', 'back', 'friends', 'love', 'story', 'sweet', 'kids', 'are', 'sweet.His', 'best', 'friend', 'Pappass', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'retarded', 'man', 'who', 'janitor', 'Tom', 'school', 'also', 'part-time', 'job', 'Tom', 'delivering', 'butcher', 'shop', 'Pappass', 'use', 'one', 'bikes', 'box', 'front', 'often', 'used', 'ice', 'cream', 'vendors', 'clown', 'around', ""'re"", 'working.They', 'are', 'collecting', 'tip', 'money', 'kept', 'metal', 'cash', 'box', 'buried', 'House', 'D', 'Detention', 'women', 'jail', 'saving', 'up', 'bike', 'One', 'prisoners', 'who', 'stashed', 'broken', 'piece', 'mirror', 'can', 'see', 'out', 'window', 'burying', 'money', 'up', 'conversation', 'not', 'so', 'strange', 'prisoners', 'are', 'habit', 'calling', 'out', 'window', 'talk', 'people', 'usually', 'pimps', 'who', 'come', 'side', 'building', 'stand', 'windows', 'Lady', 'one', 'mirror', 'solitary', 'window', 'so', 'high', 'up', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'out', 'mirror', 'Tom', 'talks', 'advice', 'Melissa', 'Lady', 'very', 'sensible', 'advice', 'what', 'girls', 'like.But', 'when', 'Tom', 'Melissa', 'Pappass', 'mad', 'jealous', 'suppose', 'money', 'bike', 'Pappass', 'caught', 'fired', 'job', 'school', 'Tom', 'blame', 'telling', 'priest', 'who', 'school', 'stole', 'rather', 'Pappass', 'stole', 'expelled', 'school', 'losing', 'scholarship', 'mother', 'panics.It', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'finally', 'Tom', 'flees', 'Paris', 'start', 'Fast', 'forward', '30', 'years', 'adult', 'wife', 'boy', 'who', 'turn', '13', 'tell', 'past', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'Lady', 'then', 'Pappass', 'Then', 'wife', 'bring', 'son', 'come', 'New', 'York', 'be', 'Pappass', 'garden', 'where', 'House', 'D', 'used', 'be', 'real', 'New', 'York', 'indeed', 'what', 'happened', 'building', 'very', 'charming', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'charmed']",N/A

931861,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B000ARFPNK,Daddy,"[0, 0]","I just recently watched this movie for the third time since its release years ago.  The story is basically the reminiscinces of a man's teenage life on his son's 13th birthday.  The man (David Duchovny) is an American living in Paris with his wife and son.  He reminisces about his life when he was 13 and living in Greenwich Village, New York.  The flashbacks begin with him as a child (played by Anton Yelchin) living with his widowed mother (Tea Leoni).  His mother is a somewhat depressed chain smoker.  His best friend is a middle-age mentally retarded man (Robin Williams).  The title ""House Of D"" refers to the House of Detention (a women's jailhouse in his neighborhood), where he befriends a female inmate (Erykah Badu) whom he can only talk to from an upper floor jail cell window... they cannot see each other.  His thirteenth year is a coming of age for him, as he puts it, ""breaking in"" to manhood.  There are many humorous moments, many intensely dramatic moments, and many heartwarming moments.  The story is wonderfully written and told (David Duchovny also wrote and directed the movie).  The characters are all real and affecting; Leoni is excellent as the mother, Yelchin is superb as the boy, Williams is masterful as his retarded friend (they use some type of oversized dentures to make his mouth oddly shaped... because his character was only able to get dentures that didn't fit), and Badu is very effective as the female inmate.  The music and songs used in soundtrack are all quite fitting and draw you into the period. Basically, this is a wonderful movie. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because while Duchovny wrote a marvelous script and did a superb job of directing, he's really not much of an actor.  Sorry, but he doesn't belong here... even though he wrote the part (just my opinion).  Aside from that, I laughed and cried throughout the film.

931863,A144BX2IT6AQAL,B000ARFPNK,Desdimona,"[4, 7]","Man this film has been panned left and right by film critics, and I find the reviews puzzling.  Why is this film so panned?  I mean the reviews are brutal.  Tons of movies come out that receive ok to stellar reviews, and taking the advice you get to the theater and realize you already saw the new movie six months ago with a different title, cast, and some minor variations.  One thing is for sure, House of D aint one of these films.  The film is a unique and distinct coming of age story, which might account for all the panning.In my opinion the film is good.  What makes it worth watching is that the characters have awful things in their lives, yet the film offers a hopeful spin on life that can actually happen.  Some films that deal with characters facing tough challenges have something extraordinary happen to them which helps them escape, but House doesn't.  The characters' escapes in House come slowly and not all of them do.  The central character Tom's escape comes with a lingering price that keeps him from living fully.  The hopefulness in House is the answer it offers as to how to be humanly and genuinely liberated.The one critique I have of the film is that Tom seems to move up the socio-economic ladder too easily if his past is to be believed.  But the deleted scenes fix this.  The deleted scene titled ""Meanwhile Back in Paris"" has the character understate his struggle in Paris, instead of making his success seem too easy.  This is definitely a film that if for whatever reason something in it rings true for you, you'll find it very good.

Anton Yelchin plays the 13-year old New Yorker very beautifully, a kid who has a stressed-out mom, who hangs out with Pappass (a semi-retarded janitor at his Catholic school) and who loves to crack naughty puns at his clueless French teacher.  There are actually two scenes that make fun of ""bonheur,"" both of which are much better than I was expecting.  Robin Williams plays Pappass well, and Erykah Badu is an excellent actor for the part of ""Lady,"" the inmate at the women's detention center the movie is named after.This is basically a story about a boy from a broken family who keeps running into tragedies and pitfalls, and they build to the point of personal breakdown (after his mom pops too many sedatives with tragic results).  It's amazing how we can hide our past, our sorrow, and our shortcomings in ourselves for so many years, only to reveal them in a sudden moment.  This is what happens to poor Tom, who finally spills the beans to his wife at the age of 43 after living in Paris for 30 years.  The end result is his sudden return to New York.

931867,A11CL7ZGHHN0ME,B000ARFPNK,"Film Fan ""Film Fan""","[4, 6]","I am an independent movie junkie, and have been fortunate enough to be able to attend film festivals in the past. However, I was unable to attend the Tribeca Film Festival for the past two years, but several friends of mine have attended. ""House of D"" was the one movie that my friends saw at Tribeca, and it had them all talking. There was no middle ground on this one -- either it was ""the greatest movie ever"", or ""a total waste of time and film."" (This division of opinion did fall into the ""fan of David Duchovny"" and ""not a fan of David Duchovny"" lines.) Their reactions alone was the main reason why I decided to see for myself why there was such a range in the critiques of this movie.I can say in all honesty that ""House of D"" certainly wasn't the worst movie that I have ever seen, and, frankly, considering all of the negative reviews it spawned during its release this spring, I was expecting to find it awful. I think it is a good first effort from Mr. Duchovny. I found Anton Yelchin charming, and his protrayal of Tommy very believeable. And I'm a huge fan of Erykah Badu, so I was thrilled to see her performance. As far as the other actors are concerned, I rate their performances as ""not great, but not terrible either."" There were parts of the movie that I laughed it, and other parts that moved me.But I can also say in all honesty that I don't believe ""House of D"" deserves all of the ""best movie ever"" reviews that have been popping up. There were several holes in the dialog that had me scratching my head in confusion. I understand that there are limitation when doing an independent movie, and that you can't always film all of the scenes you want to film, and you have to cater to the movie studios/backers/distributors, but considering there was a ""voice-over"" in the movie, why a few additional lines of dialog couldn't have been added to explain some of what I consider the obvious holes in the plot is a mystery. (An American kid living alone in Paris - how did he survive? I know he could speak French, but what about money? Where did he live? And how did he manage to get to Paris in the first place without a passport? And what about his mother's relatives who arrived to take Tommy in after his mother's overdose. Did they even attempt to find out what happened to Tommy? Or did they just say to themselves ""Golly, he was here, but now he's gone. Oh well, those things happen."" I know these questions can easily fall into the ""just take it on faith"" category, but I think they could have been solved, as I said, with some additional voice-over dialog.)I think this film falls into one of those ""you either love it or hate it"" categories. If you are a David Duchovny fan, I'm sure you are planning on watching this movie anyway, so you aren't bothering with any reviews. If you aren't a David Duchovny fan, you won't be wasting your time or money on this DVD. If you are like me (you know who David Duchovny is, but you can't quote bits of dialog from any X-Files episode), I would suggest that you at least give ""House of D"" a try.

931871,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000ARFPNK,Joseph Haschka,"[9, 20]","My impatience level with a film is linked to a Fidget Factor. By the end of the advance screening of HOUSE OF D, no position in my seat seemed comfortable.As the movie opens, the adult Tom Warshaw (David Duchovny), an American writer living in Paris, breaks a promise made to his 13-year old son, who lives with Dad's estranged wife Coralie (Magali Amadei), that the two go bike riding on the boy's birthday. The Missus is not pleased, and Tom explains that he was six hours late because he was born in the United States in New York City in Greenwich Village. Of course, this makes no sense. Tom's subsequent explanation is the extended flashback to his childhood in 1973, which comprises the major portion of the film's plot. Way back then, young Tommy (Anton Yelchin) lives with his emotionally manic, widowed mother (Tea Leoni), a chain smoking nurse who forces her son to eat Brussels sprouts for good health's sake. Tommy works part-time for a local butcher shop that delivers, a task done jointly with his best friend, the mentally retarded (uh, handicapped ... uh, challenged ... uh, whatever's currently PC) Pappass (Robin Williams), a forty-something man who's also the assistant janitor at Tommy's parochial college prep academy run by the benevolent and clueless Reverend Duncan (Frank Langella). Tommy has an awkward crush on a fellow student, rich girl Melissa (Zelda Williams). In the film's most unlikely scenes, Tommy gets Advice on Life and Love from ""Lady Bernadette"" (Erykah Badu), a Black hooker incarcerated in the local HOUSE OF D(etention). Bernadette's cell is on an upper story of the House. Tommy can only hear, but not see, his friend, who can only view Tommy's reflection in a piece of broken mirror she thrusts at arm's length out the window.The best performances are by Williams, who proves once again his masterful ability to improvise just about any role imaginable, and that of Leoni- always a Babe in my book, whose character's tragic end, combined with Bernadette's encouragement, catalyzes Tommy's ultimately life-altering decision.I wanted to like HOUSE OF D more than I eventually did by the time the credits rolled, though I admit to its occasional charm. I found young Tommy (and adult Tom, too) more annoying than engaging, particularly the manner by which the former funded his ""run"". I mean, how was that supposed to gain audience sympathy? And the boy's bizarre relationship with Lady Bernadette (and her pimp) was almost surreal in its unbelievability. Finally, I searched in vain for a lesson in this morality play, much less a link between the circumstances of Warshaw's birth and his being six hours late for a bike ride. Directed and written by David Duchovny, perhaps the storyline stems from events in his own life which he perceives as being more profound than he can ultimately convey to his audience.HOUSE OF D is small screen entertainment ideal for a Sunday night prime time slot.

931875,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ARFPNK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","I'm perplexed by what the intent behind ""House of D"" was and even more mystified by how warmly it has been embraced by most Amazon reviewers.  I'm guessing this was conceived as a feel good, coming of age story--but frankly, not a note of it rang true for me.  I had wished nothing but the best for David Duchovney's feature.  I have been impressed by the ""X-Files"" episodes he has written and/or directed and personally feel that he is super intelligent with a great wry humor.  Critically drubbed upon it's release, I was still intrigued to check out ""House of D.""The film strives to be quirky, I suppose.  The scenes set in a very idealized Greenwich Village circa 1973 have a few amusing moments, but they are so removed from reality--it's almost unbelievable that we're expected to take it seriously.  It's a lovely world where a 12 year old schoolboy and a 41 year old mentally challenged man pal around as best buddies.  I know it's meant to be whimsical when the man talks about his private areas (even around 12 year old girls), but it's a little creepy for my taste.  Let's just put it on record now, Robin Williams never needs a reason to overact---please, please, please don't let him do mentally challenged again.It's also a beautiful world where our young protagonist can befriend a wise and helpful lady convict in the local detention center.  She wants him to score her drugs, but instead a sweet bond is formed.  The scenes between the two of them are especially false as she is talking through a second story window and he is on the street with the nice pimps who don't bother him.  It's especially touching as he's yelling all of the private details of his life up at her in front of everyone--isn't it warm and wacky, he even tells her he has small testicles.The story takes a sudden dramatic turn, as our hero's mother OD's and is brain dead.  If you're thinking this might make for touching drama, don't worry.  We aren't emotionally invested in her character.  I felt bad for Tea Leoni, Duchovney's wife and a talented actress.  Here she has a thankless role popping pills, obsessing over brussel sprouts and smoking.  We never know her.  So our hero runs away to Paris alone.30 years later, he's grown up to be Duchovney, having successfully lived on the streets in his youth.  But even though he has a thirteen year old son of his own--he needs catharsis.  So back to New York, and cue heartwarming and thoughtful reunions with the convict and the mentally challenged best buddy.I'm am thrilled that the film touches an emotional chord with some.  But nothing worked in this for me.  It came across as so phony and trite.  If a movie can stir up genuine feelings in me than it's been successful at something--even if it isn't a great film.  But here the characters rang false, the situations rang false, the dialogue rang false--and I'm so sorry, but that's three strikes and my cold, cold heart remains untouched and slightly annoyed that a lot of talent was used to so little effect.",1,"Emotional Manipulation In The Guise Of Feel Good Cinema--""House of D"" Rings False",1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,3010,"[""'m"", 'perplexed', 'what', 'intent', 'House', 'D', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'mystified', 'how', 'warmly', 'been', 'embraced', 'most', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'conceived', 'feel', 'good', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'frankly', 'not', 'note', 'true', 'had', 'wished', 'nothing', 'best', 'David', 'Duchovney', 'feature', 'have', 'been', 'impressed', 'X-Files', 'written', 'and/or', 'directed', 'personally', 'feel', 'super', 'intelligent', 'great', 'wry', 'humor', 'Critically', 'drubbed', 'release', 'was', 'still', 'intrigued', 'check', 'out', 'House', 'D.', 'film', 'be', 'quirky', 'suppose', 'scenes', 'set', 'very', 'idealized', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'circa', '1973', 'have', 'few', 'amusing', 'moments', 'are', 'so', 'removed', 'reality', 'almost', 'unbelievable', ""'re"", 'expected', 'take', 'seriously', 'lovely', 'world', 'where', '12', 'year', 'old', 'schoolboy', '41', 'year', 'old', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'pal', 'around', 'best', 'buddies', 'know', 'meant', 'be', 'whimsical', 'when', 'man', 'private', 'areas', 'even', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'little', 'creepy', 'taste', 'Let', 'just', 'put', 'record', 'now', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'never', 'reason', 'overact', '-please', 'please', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'again.It', 'also', 'beautiful', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'protagonist', 'can', 'befriend', 'wise', 'helpful', 'lady', 'convict', 'local', 'detention', 'center', 'score', 'drugs', 'instead', 'sweet', 'bond', 'formed', 'scenes', 'two', 'are', 'especially', 'false', 'talking', 'second', 'story', 'window', 'street', 'nice', 'pimps', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'especially', 'touching', 'yelling', 'private', 'details', 'life', 'up', 'front', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'warm', 'wacky', 'even', 'small', 'testicles.The', 'story', 'sudden', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'hero', 'mother', 'OD', 'brain', 'dead', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'might', 'make', 'touching', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'are', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'invested', 'character', 'felt', 'bad', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Duchovney', 'wife', 'talented', 'actress', 'Here', 'thankless', 'role', 'popping', 'pills', 'obsessing', 'over', 'brussel', 'sprouts', 'smoking', 'never', 'know', 'So', 'hero', 'away', 'Paris', 'alone.30', 'years', 'later', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'Duchovney', 'having', 'successfully', 'lived', 'streets', 'youth', 'even', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'own', 'catharsis', 'So', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'cue', 'heartwarming', 'thoughtful', 'reunions', 'convict', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'best', 'buddy.I', ""'m"", 'am', 'thrilled', 'film', 'emotional', 'chord', 'nothing', 'worked', 'came', 'so', 'phony', 'trite', 'movie', 'can', 'stir', 'up', 'genuine', 'feelings', 'been', 'successful', 'something', 'even', ""n't"", 'great', 'film', 'here', 'characters', 'rang', 'false', 'situations', 'rang', 'false', 'dialogue', 'rang', 'false', ""'m"", 'so', 'sorry', 'three', 'strikes', 'cold', 'cold', 'heart', 'untouched', 'slightly', 'annoyed', 'lot', 'talent', 'was', 'used', 'so', 'little', 'effect']",N/A

I read Ebert's print review and was surprised to see that he hated it so much that he resorted to making up words to describe its awfulness.Seeing ""House of D"" now became a sort of morbid curiosity. How could something that looked promising be so bad? Despite the negative reviews by every critic that I tend to trust, I intended to make up my own mind. I wouldn't get the chance; ""House of D"" beat a hasty retreat from the one theatre that was showing it. Still I waited excitedly for the DVD. I really did want to root for the underdog of the year, besides I loved the genre and some of my favorite films of this type have met with critical indifference at best.""House of D"" did not reward my faith, and that is being polite. It is a profoundly stupid film from beginning to end, with astoundingly bad dialogue. My favorite line: ""I took a sedative and I want to go to beditive.""The film's harshest critics indulged in name-calling and harping on things that could easily have been overlooked had the film warranted our suspension of disbelief, but it does not. A few critics joked that Robin Williams playing a retarded man was not much of a stretch. I believe his performances was perfectly serviceable, besides the dubious honor of Williams' hammiest performance still belongs to ""Jack"" (let us never forget that that film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, or more to the point let us never let Coppola forget.) Instead of insulting Robin Williams (against whom Ebert has well-known bias) I prefer to focus on the script. In addition to lines such as the above, Williams and Yelchin's characters have the irritating habit of elongating the end of each other's names, ""Thomas"" and ""Pappas"" to form a vulgarity.The best part of the whole experience, something that almost made it all worth it was to watch Duchovny incessantly and shamelessly plug his un-produced scripts in the special features. If there's any justice in the world they will never see the light of day. The biggest disappointment is that there is something about Yelchin which suggests that he would be a great actor if given the right material.

931877,AZ78HT7H9DVJG,B000ARFPNK,LARRY,"[2, 4]","I got *House of D* thinking that I just might not like it.  However, I was actually surprised how much I loved it, along with a few tears.The movie is a flashback of Tom Warshaw (David Duchovny) , an American artist living in Paris.  As Tom's son is soon turning 13, Tom goes back to a time when he was nearing 13.Tommy takes care of his chain-smoking mother (Tea Leoni), who has a difficult time coping with the recent death of her husband.  Although she is suppose to console Tommy, it is Tommy who actually has to look after his mother.  Tommy also takes care or rather, defends his best friend.  His best friend is a 41-year-old slightly retarded janitor and deliveryman, Pappass (Robin Williams).  Meanwhile, Tommy is getting advice from female inmate, Lady (Erykah Badu) at the local women's house of detention about intimate issues (dancing, girls, etc.).  Tommy cannot see her except her hands.  They carry a conversation by shouting across as Lady is jailed on the second (or third?) floor.With the exception of his clingy mother and his father's death, life seems to be good for Tommy.  However, things take a turn for the worse when the mother overdoses on pills and becomes brain-dead and Pappass steals a bike.  Ultimately, Tommy blames Lady for everything.  Lady, realizing the severity of situations, riles him into further anger to make him run.  Although Tommy didn't see her point, Lady was actually setting him free...to be a man.The whole point was about a boy's journey/transition becoming a man.  Despite the death of Tommy's father, Tommy had it pretty good as a boy.  But, there came a point where Tommy had to lose a few things or rather, people before he could became a man.  He loses his mother as well as the girl he likes.  He loses trust of a ""friend"" whose advice he once sought.  The hardest of all, he deserts his best friend.  The irony here was that while Pappass was an older man, he would never actually be (or was) a man.  However, in this moment, Pappass realizes that Tommny needed to go and find himself and gives his blessing.Overall, *House of D* was a wonderful movie.

931878,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000ARFPNK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 10]","I was looking forward to seeing ""House of D,"" but all that ever came to the Zenith City was the poster for the movie (you would think that if a theater put up a poster for a movie that would be a reasonable assurance the theater would be showing the movie in the future, but you would be wrong).  David Duchovny wrote and directed a couple of interesting episodes of ""The X-Files"" (""The Unnatural"" in season six and ""Hollywood A.D."" for season seven), both of which evinced a wry tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, but for his first theatrical film Duchovny is certainly going for something more poetic in this coming of age film in which his wife plays his mother.  Just do not make the mistake of thinking ""House of D"" is an autobiographical effort or that this is just another coming of age film.Tom Warshaw (Duchovny) is an American in Paris, an artist who has been hiding out in France and has decided to tell his wife (Magali Amadei) and son (Harold Cartier) the dark secrets of his past life.  His son is turning 13 and that was the age when everything changed for young Tom (Anton Yelchin), who in 1973 was living in New York City with his mother, Katherine (T&eacute;a Leoni), who has not yet recovered from the death of her husband.  Tom is attending a parochial school on scholarship and has made friends with Pappass (Robin Williams), an assistant janitor who is what was called at that time retarded.  Even if he really has nothing to shave Tom is becoming a man, and between his mother, his friend, his teacher Reverend Duncan (Frank Langella), and the other boys at school there is nobody to turn to for advice until he ""meets"" Lady (Erykah Badu).Lady is an inmate in the Women's House of Detention (to wit, the ""House of D"") in New York City.  Tom cannot see her, but she can use a broken mirror to see him, and from within her prison walls she dolls out advice, all the while waiting for Tom to bring her a dime bag.  Such advice is necessary because all of the key relationships in Tom's life are about to reach a moment of crisis, setting off a chain reaction that will result in Tom fleeing to France as things go from bad to worse.  Tom has been trying to protect his mother from the depths of her depression, going so far as to sleep under her bed so that if she gets up in the middle of the night he will know and can stop her before she does anything to hurt herself.  Katharine is a woman on the edge, and given what he ends up doing it is not surprising that it is young Tom who ends up pushing her over the edge and beyond.Duchovny shows up with a goatee, but it is really what he is doing behind the camera instead of in front that matters this time around, although you will notice his writing much more than his directing.  There are moments in ""House of D"" where Duchovny is trying too hard, but he is clearly trying to do something beyond the ordinary and that becomes part of the equation in the end.  I thought the final shot of Tom under his mother's bed was powerful enough to say that Duchovny comes out ahead by the end of this 2004 film.  He is helped greatly by Yelchin's performance and the fact that this is more the story of young Tom than adult Tom, although I swear Yelchin looks more like Ewan McGregor's kid brother than a young David Duchovny.  Keep in mind that Duchovny did write the role of the mother for his wife but that she signed out for the gig, which would explain why she never has a really big scene, while Langella is giving only a couple of notes to play.  One of the mixed blessings of this film is that the cast is more impressive than the characters.In that regard having Robin Williams in the cast is a mixed bag.  Williams signed on first, so that meant his presence got the film made, which is important, but all too often we are reminded of other things he has done, which takes away from the character Williams is playing in this film.  Along with ""Robots"" that is two movies I have seen this month where I thought having Robin Williams along for the ride ultimately worked against the film..  Anyhow, the most effective relationship ends up being the one between Tom and the Lady he never gets to see when he is a teenager, which simply underscores the importance of the film's title.  ""House of D"" is not another coming of age film, because girls are the least of Tom's problems.  Few people are going to relate to the characters and situations in this film, but that will not stop most of them from enjoying the story Duchovny has attempted to craft.  At the very least he should be given a chance to see what he can do next.",4,David Duchovny writes and directs a theatrical film,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,4595,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'House', 'D', 'ever', 'came', 'Zenith', 'City', 'was', 'poster', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'theater', 'put', 'up', 'poster', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'reasonable', 'assurance', 'theater', 'would', 'be', 'showing', 'movie', 'future', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'wrote', 'directed', 'couple', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'X-Files', 'Unnatural', 'season', 'six', 'Hollywood', 'A.D.', 'season', 'seven', 'evinced', 'wry', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'sense', 'humor', 'first', 'theatrical', 'film', 'Duchovny', 'certainly', 'going', 'something', 'more', 'poetic', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'wife', 'mother', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'House', 'D', 'autobiographical', 'effort', 'just', 'coming', 'age', 'film.Tom', 'Warshaw', 'Duchovny', 'American', 'Paris', 'artist', 'who', 'been', 'hiding', 'out', 'France', 'decided', 'tell', 'wife', 'Magali', 'Amadei', 'son', 'Harold', 'Cartier', 'dark', 'secrets', 'past', 'life', 'son', 'turning', '13', 'was', 'age', 'when', 'everything', 'changed', 'young', 'Tom', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'who', '1973', 'was', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'mother', 'Katherine', 'T', 'eacute', 'Leoni', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'recovered', 'death', 'husband', 'Tom', 'attending', 'parochial', 'school', 'scholarship', 'made', 'friends', 'Pappass', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'assistant', 'janitor', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'called', 'time', 'retarded', 'Even', 'really', 'nothing', 'shave', 'Tom', 'becoming', 'man', 'mother', 'friend', 'teacher', 'Reverend', 'Duncan', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'other', 'boys', 'school', 'nobody', 'turn', 'advice', 'meets', 'Lady', 'Erykah', 'Badu', '.Lady', 'inmate', 'Women', 'House', 'Detention', 'wit', 'House', 'D', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Tom', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'can', 'use', 'broken', 'mirror', 'see', 'prison', 'out', 'advice', 'while', 'waiting', 'Tom', 'bring', 'dime', 'bag', 'Such', 'advice', 'necessary', 'key', 'relationships', 'Tom', 'life', 'are', 'reach', 'moment', 'crisis', 'setting', 'off', 'chain', 'reaction', 'will', 'result', 'Tom', 'fleeing', 'France', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Tom', 'been', 'trying', 'protect', 'mother', 'depths', 'depression', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'sleep', 'bed', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'will', 'know', 'can', 'stop', 'anything', 'hurt', 'Katharine', 'woman', 'edge', 'given', 'what', 'up', 'doing', 'not', 'surprising', 'young', 'Tom', 'who', 'up', 'pushing', 'edge', 'beyond.Duchovny', 'up', 'goatee', 'really', 'what', 'doing', 'camera', 'instead', 'front', 'time', 'around', 'will', 'notice', 'writing', 'much', 'more', 'directing', 'are', 'moments', 'House', 'D', 'where', 'Duchovny', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'clearly', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'ordinary', 'part', 'equation', 'end', 'thought', 'final', 'shot', 'Tom', 'mother', 'bed', 'was', 'powerful', 'enough', 'say', 'Duchovny', 'out', 'ahead', 'end', '2004', 'film', 'helped', 'greatly', 'Yelchin', 'performance', 'fact', 'more', 'story', 'young', 'Tom', 'adult', 'Tom', 'swear', 'Yelchin', 'more', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'kid', 'brother', 'young', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Keep', 'mind', 'Duchovny', 'did', 'write', 'role', 'mother', 'wife', 'signed', 'out', 'gig', 'would', 'explain', 'why', 'never', 'really', 'big', 'scene', 'Langella', 'giving', 'only', 'couple', 'notes', 'play', 'One', 'mixed', 'blessings', 'film', 'cast', 'more', 'impressive', 'characters.In', 'having', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'cast', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Williams', 'signed', 'first', 'so', 'meant', 'presence', 'got', 'film', 'made', 'important', 'too', 'often', 'are', 'reminded', 'other', 'things', 'done', 'away', 'character', 'Williams', 'playing', 'film', 'Robots', 'two', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'month', 'where', 'thought', 'having', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'ride', 'ultimately', 'worked', 'film..', 'Anyhow', 'most', 'effective', 'relationship', 'up', 'being', 'one', 'Tom', 'Lady', 'never', 'see', 'when', 'teenager', 'simply', 'importance', 'film', 'title', 'House', 'D', 'not', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'girls', 'are', 'least', 'Tom', 'problems', 'Few', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'relate', 'characters', 'situations', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'most', 'enjoying', 'story', 'Duchovny', 'attempted', 'craft', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'next']",N/A

T&eacute;a Leoni and Anton Yelchin gave great performances, but David Duchovny and Robin Williams were mediocre at best.  Not their shining moments in front of the camera.  Erykah Badu was great in her role of Lady.  I do admire Duchovny's vision behind the camera, though.  The film was a bit more art house than I care for, but it worked.  In an existential sort of way, the mechanics of the film were really secondary to the boy's story, which managed to be intense and not sentimental.  I can cite all the things about the film that weren't there, but because it still came together so well, clearly its strength lay on other levels.

931892,A1DQZBHEU98PBT,B000ARFPNK,Theresa W,"[20, 24]","The last few years I've been searching for good movies.  I rent quite often, go to the movies occasionally and I am usually disappointed.  I wasn't expecting too much with House of D, not having heard much about it prior to my renting it.  However, I was pleasantly surprised; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  So much so, I am considering buying it for my collection, a privilege.The story was written and directed by David Duchovny. It's about Tom, who is looking back at the life he had as a young boy growing up in New York City during the 1970's. His father is dead, his mother (Tea Leoni) is mixing pain medicine with alcohol and cigarettes and he is trying to deal with adolescence. His best friend is a 40 year old mentally retarded man named Pappas, played by Robin Williams. We watch as Tom struggles to make a move on the girl he has a crush on, manage his rocky home life with part time work and private school. He often gets his advice and guidance from teachers at school, his boss and from a lady he has strangely befriended that is in a detention home. His journey is filled with events take place that are beyond his control and will alter his life forever.What I look for in a movie: To wrap me up in the story, so that I forget all else going on (I don't want to be thinking about what I'm doing later, or looking at my clock the whole time).  To evoke emotion- laughter, tears, frustration etc.  To have a bit of a lesson.  To really enjoy the characters and story.  A few surprises, I don't like cookie-cutter movies.  A good conclusion that I feel is satisfying and wraps up the story.This movie did all of that for me.  House of D was written and directed, in my opinion, very well.  I found myself caught up in the movie only 5 minutes in.  I fell in love with the characters, who I felt were quite unique, even to the point of surprise at times with what they would do.  Naturally, this story did touch me; I laughed a few times and felt tears welling up several times.  The story itself is one someone can argue- ""what was the point?""  However, I have found there are rare movies, where maybe the point isn't clear, however, the story it tells is good anyway.  This is kind of a coming of age story mixed with a story of hard lessons life throws your way, put together with the story of an adult finally taking a look at his life and making some changes.  At the end of the movie, I enjoyed the journey and was happy with where it ended up.I think a lot of us have had our own hardships.  I'm sure most of us have struggled with finding our place in this world, our path in life.  That is what this movie is about.  It's about finding hope at the end of the day and having the courage to take the journey.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to give a unique movie a chance.

I am not entirely impressed by the quality of this film, especially the narration parts, but I am deeply touched by several big tear-jerking moments. As a music fan Erykah Badu, and loved her work in The Cider House Rules, I was very looking forward to seeing her improvement as an actress, and she totally moved me to tears in her big scene opposite David Duchovny. Other cast members including Duchovny's wife Tea Leoni and Robin Williams are also memorable and emotionally affecting in their roles. I was surprised that Duchovny had written not that much screentime for himself in this film. He appeared briefly in the beginning and about another 15 minutes in the end. Anton Yelchin who played the teenage version of Duchovny's character had a lot of scenes opposite Williams, Leoni, and Badu, and he did a good job at conveying all the complex emotions of his character. This is a very good story about dealing with past trauma, redemption, and reunion.The movie starts with Tom Warshaw(Duchovny), an American artist who had been living in Paris for thhirty years. He's married to a loving wife named Coralie(Magali Amadei) and has a teenaged son named Ordell(Harold Cartier). On his son's birthday, he shared with him and his wife the most unforgetable and painful experiences when he was twelve and still living in New York.Tommy(Anton Yelchin) lived with his depressed and controlling mother(Tea Leoni), and his father had died years ago. Tommy works parttime along with his best friend Pappass as delivery boys for the butcher shop. Pappass(Robin Williams) is a middle aged retarded man whose father is verbally abusive towards him. Tommy talks to a inmate from the sidewalk outside the House of Detention for women. Erykah Badu plays the inmate Lady/Bernadette who gives advice about love and life to the troubled and unhappy Tommy. Upon the suicide of his mother, Lady encouraged Tommy to run away and be a free man, and so at the age of thirteen, he gathered enough money and fled New York for a new life in Paris.Now that Tom is a family man of his own, it's time for him make a trip back to the home he had abandon when he was a kid. Can he come to terms with the painful past and will he be able to reconnect with Pappass, Lady, and all the places he used to know?Robin Williams had a relatively challenging role in this film, because his character had gone from retarded to mentally challenged, and he gets aged from 41 to 71.

How could a movie with Robin Williams and David Duchovny be bad? Well, we weren't let down.The House of D is a wonderful story of life, showing how despite the trials, the triumphs can be sweet. David Duchovny plays Tommy Warshaw, a boy who has lost his father to cancer and struggles to find his way into manhood as he approaches 13. Tommy flees to Paris, only to turn a complete circle and find his way back home.Anton Yelchin steals the show as the younger Tommy. Side by side, Anton and Robin Williams are brilliant. Their relationship is incredibly believable and touching. Other wonderful performances are put in by Erykah Badu as 'Lady' Bernadette Odelia Glasser, and Tea Leone as Katherine Warshaw.I can't recommend this movie enough. The House of D is a movie that will make you laugh and cry, and then warm your heart with a happy ending.
