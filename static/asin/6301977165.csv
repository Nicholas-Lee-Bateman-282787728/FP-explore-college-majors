286065,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301977165,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","This 1941 film is the Hollywood life of George Armstrong Custer - the cadet with the lowest marks and the highest demerits in the history of West Point. He only excelled in horsemanship and swordsmanship. It begins with his arrival as a cadet from Michigan; his hero was Murat. In need of officers, he is sent to Washington. He meets General Winfield Scott and is sent to the front. Custer helps to prevent a defeat at Gettysburg by repulsing Stuart's cavalry.Back in civilian life he is offered the chance to lend his name to a business: to sell stock on his reputation, and gain a government monopoly. Custer rejects this deal. His wife meets General Scott and asks that he be placed on the active list. He is, and assigned to the Dakotas. He finds Fort Abraham Lincoln in disarray: slackness, a lack of training, drinking, and selling guns to the Indians. He imposed order on the 7th Cavalry. But his hot temper drew him into a trap. One scene explains the writing of ""Garry Owen"" and its adaption by the 7th Cavalry.The film shows the Great Plains Indians defended their homeland against the invaders. Defeated, they promise to keep the peace treaty as long as their sacred Black Hills were not invaded. But greedy gold seekers came, and the war was renewed. The railroad company and their politicians wanted to bring in new settlers, and profit from this. You can read about this in the history books.General Custer was given orders to pursue the Indians and do as he thought best. His regiment proceeded up the Rosebud towards the Little Big Horn river. The film shows them chasing a small group that draws them into a trap - the oldest trick in the book! Into the valley of death rode the three hundred; someone had blundered. On the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence America learned of Custer's last stand. Custer found fame and glory from his defeat. Otherwise he would only be a name in the history books, like the other two Captains who were promoted to Brigadier Generals that same day in 1863, or the other officers who fought in the last Indian Wars.",4,History as Entertainment,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,2083,"['1941', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'life', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'cadet', 'lowest', 'marks', 'highest', 'demerits', 'history', 'West', 'Point', 'only', 'excelled', 'horsemanship', 'swordsmanship', 'arrival', 'cadet', 'Michigan', 'hero', 'was', 'Murat', 'need', 'officers', 'sent', 'Washington', 'General', 'Winfield', 'Scott', 'sent', 'front', 'Custer', 'prevent', 'defeat', 'Gettysburg', 'repulsing', 'Stuart', 'cavalry.Back', 'civilian', 'life', 'offered', 'chance', 'lend', 'name', 'business', 'sell', 'stock', 'reputation', 'gain', 'government', 'monopoly', 'Custer', 'deal', 'wife', 'General', 'Scott', 'be', 'placed', 'active', 'list', 'assigned', 'Dakotas', 'Fort', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'disarray', 'slackness', 'lack', 'training', 'drinking', 'selling', 'guns', 'Indians', 'imposed', 'order', '7th', 'Cavalry', 'hot', 'temper', 'drew', 'trap', 'One', 'scene', 'writing', 'Garry', 'Owen', 'adaption', '7th', 'Cavalry.The', 'film', 'Great', 'Plains', 'Indians', 'defended', 'homeland', 'invaders', 'Defeated', 'promise', 'keep', 'peace', 'treaty', 'as', 'long', 'sacred', 'Black', 'Hills', 'were', 'not', 'invaded', 'greedy', 'gold', 'seekers', 'came', 'war', 'was', 'renewed', 'railroad', 'company', 'politicians', 'wanted', 'bring', 'new', 'settlers', 'profit', 'can', 'read', 'history', 'books.General', 'Custer', 'was', 'given', 'orders', 'pursue', 'Indians', 'do', 'thought', 'best', 'regiment', 'proceeded', 'up', 'Rosebud', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'river', 'film', 'chasing', 'small', 'group', 'trap', 'oldest', 'trick', 'book', 'valley', 'death', 'rode', 'three', 'hundred', 'someone', 'had', 'blundered', '100th', 'anniversary', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'America', 'learned', 'Custer', 'last', 'stand', 'Custer', 'found', 'fame', 'glory', 'defeat', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'name', 'history', 'books', 'other', 'two', 'Captains', 'who', 'were', 'promoted', 'Brigadier', 'Generals', 'same', 'day', '1863', 'other', 'officers', 'who', 'fought', 'last', 'Indian', 'Wars']",N/A

He was one of the more briilliant commanders of horse to come out of the Civil War.  A master of the *flanking* attack. Who was pivotol in holding off the CSA's rear attack on the Union at Gettysburg.  Who was pivotal at Appomattox.While he certainly would not sacrifice himself and his troops, he did put his career on the line in Spring 1876 when he testified before Congress regarding the Indian Bureau's corruption.He did not ignore his Indian scouts' advice at Little Big Horn -- in fact, he took their advice, which was to attack the village NOW before it broke up and scattered.Custer was not ""arrogant"" -- he was supremely confident in himself and his troops.  Would you prefer to serve under a commander who thought otherwise?  He was Cavalry -- supreme confidence came with the territory.The most common terms I come across when contemporaries describe Custer, are ""Gentleman.""  And ""soft spoken.""  The only things he really bragged about were his hunting dogs and his own hunting prowess.Custer had a great sense of humor and was pretty good at deprecating himself.  Flynn manages to portray all of this. If Custer had never existed, he would have to have been invented for Flynn to portray in a movie.THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is a rip-snorting adventure, full of humor, pathos honor, and gallantry.

286071,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,6301977165,Brian J Hay,"[11, 12]","""They Died With Their Boots On"" was one of the first really big films that saw Errol Flynn cast without Michael Curtiz in the Director's chair. The result was pure (if somewhat propagandist to say nothing of racist) magic.Flynn always thought the idea of using him in westerns was ridiculous. On paper it probably was. He may have looked like the most dashing of cowboys but with his Australian accent he certainly didn't sound like one. It was never a problem though. Flynn had the ability to deliver any line easily and make it utterly convincing. That, coupled with his natural charisma made almost any hurdle insignificant. His performance as Custer, from the comic situations in the first half of the film to the darker moments later on is never less than brilliant. Of all the portrayals of Custer on film his may be one of the least accurate but it's the most believable. Only a great actor could manage that feat.Great films don't become what they are with just one great actor though. Olivia de Havilland (though she has a smaller part) matches him step for step. These two always worked well together but this pairing may be their best one. Her character is just as well developed as his. She is funny, thoughtful, assertive and supportive. Any scene she does without Flynn on the screen she steals. Together they're either hilarious or tender. There is never a moment where it seems the love they have for each other is anything but total. Their parting scene has to be one of the great ones in all of film. Arthur Kennedy is just as strong as Ned Sharp, the villain of the piece. Some of the scenes involving him and Flynn are very strong. The final interaction between them is chilling. Other great names from film (Sydney Greenstreet and Anthony Quinn to name two) are just as strong in their parts.Great films also require great direction. With Raoul Walsh in the Director's chair this one had it. This was the first film Flynn made with Walsh and (with the possible exception of ""Objective Burma"") it may be their best. Walsh knew how to get the best out of actors and he knew where the camera should be to make the most of dramatic moments. His other films include ""White Heat"", ""High Sierra"", ""The Naked and the Dead"", ""The Lawless Breed"", ""The Roaring Twenties"" and ""Gentleman Jim"" (another of Flynn's great films).The film isn't without problems. The nicest thing that can be said about its portrayal of people from any race other than white is that it's condescending (the worst is that it works to keep the racial hierarchy of the time intact). Hattie McDaniel (who was anything but a simpleton) plays the part of one. Anthony Quinn plays Crazy Horse as the atypical ""Hollywood Indian"" of the time. And things haven't improved much. The Hollywood community may have dropped those stereotypes but they keep coming up with new ones. Films like ""Marci X"" (for instance) prove that.Some good points are made though. The scene where the Cadets loyal to the Southern cause depart from West Point captures the pain of that split without sermonizing over it. That fact makes it all the more touching. The portrayal of how greedy individuals wilfully sacrifice other people to instigate wars that serve them is exceptional. Even though it's done from a point of view that's never better than patronizing the film makes it clear that the blame for all the major violations of treaties made between the white man and the Indians lay with the white man. It also makes it clear that these things were done in the service of commerce. The ""incidents"" depicted may not be accurate but the patterns they portray are. The idea of creating situations that get people to demand war is a method that's been used since the dawn of civilized society. This film gives a textbook lesson on how it's done.""They Died With Their Boots On"" isn't historically accurate (or even close). It's not intended to be either. It's entertainment that rises above its problems. It should be enjoyed as such.",4,"Enjoy it for What it Is, Not What it Isn't ...",1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,3990,"['Died', 'Their', 'Boots', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'really', 'big', 'films', 'saw', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'Director', 'chair', 'result', 'was', 'pure', 'somewhat', 'propagandist', 'say', 'nothing', 'racist', 'magic.Flynn', 'always', 'thought', 'idea', 'using', 'westerns', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'paper', 'probably', 'was', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'most', 'dashing', 'cowboys', 'Australian', 'accent', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'problem', 'Flynn', 'had', 'ability', 'deliver', 'line', 'easily', 'make', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'coupled', 'natural', 'charisma', 'made', 'almost', 'hurdle', 'insignificant', 'performance', 'Custer', 'comic', 'situations', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'darker', 'moments', 'later', 'never', 'less', 'brilliant', 'portrayals', 'Custer', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'least', 'accurate', 'most', 'believable', 'Only', 'great', 'actor', 'could', 'manage', 'feat.Great', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'what', 'are', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'actor', 'Olivia', 'Havilland', 'smaller', 'part', 'step', 'step', 'two', 'always', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'pairing', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'character', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'developed', 'funny', 'thoughtful', 'assertive', 'supportive', 'scene', 'Flynn', 'screen', 'Together', ""'re"", 'hilarious', 'tender', 'never', 'moment', 'where', 'love', 'have', 'other', 'anything', 'total', 'parting', 'scene', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'ones', 'film', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'Ned', 'Sharp', 'villain', 'piece', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Flynn', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'final', 'interaction', 'chilling', 'Other', 'great', 'names', 'film', 'Sydney', 'Greenstreet', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'name', 'two', 'are', 'just', 'strong', 'parts.Great', 'films', 'also', 'require', 'great', 'direction', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'Director', 'chair', 'one', 'had', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'Flynn', 'made', 'Walsh', 'possible', 'exception', 'Objective', 'Burma', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Walsh', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'best', 'actors', 'knew', 'where', 'camera', 'should', 'be', 'make', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'other', 'films', 'include', 'White', 'Heat', 'High', 'Sierra', 'Naked', 'Dead', 'Lawless', 'Breed', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'Gentleman', 'Jim', 'Flynn', 'great', 'films', '.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'problems', 'nicest', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'portrayal', 'people', 'race', 'other', 'white', 'condescending', 'worst', 'keep', 'racial', 'hierarchy', 'time', 'intact', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'who', 'was', 'anything', 'simpleton', 'part', 'one', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'Crazy', 'Horse', 'atypical', 'Hollywood', 'Indian', 'time', 'things', 'have', ""n't"", 'improved', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'community', 'may', 'have', 'dropped', 'stereotypes', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'new', 'ones', 'Films', 'Marci', 'X', 'instance', 'that.Some', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'made', 'scene', 'where', 'Cadets', 'Southern', 'cause', 'depart', 'West', 'Point', 'pain', 'split', 'sermonizing', 'fact', 'more', 'touching', 'portrayal', 'how', 'greedy', 'individuals', 'wilfully', 'sacrifice', 'other', 'people', 'instigate', 'wars', 'serve', 'exceptional', 'Even', 'done', 'point', 'view', 'never', 'better', 'patronizing', 'film', 'clear', 'blame', 'major', 'violations', 'treaties', 'made', 'white', 'man', 'Indians', 'lay', 'white', 'man', 'also', 'clear', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'service', 'commerce', 'incidents', 'depicted', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accurate', 'patterns', 'portray', 'are', 'idea', 'creating', 'situations', 'get', 'people', 'demand', 'war', 'method', 'been', 'used', 'dawn', 'civilized', 'society', 'film', 'textbook', 'lesson', 'how', 'done', 'Died', 'Their', 'Boots', ""n't"", 'historically', 'accurate', 'even', 'close', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'either', 'entertainment', 'problems', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'such']",N/A

For goodness sake, it's a film, a holywood film, with the aim to make money and amuse as best they can. You want history? Read a book, lazy bunch!Now starts the review: I was very disappointed with this Walsh film. To me Raoul Walsh is one of the greatest, undoubtedly among the top 10 . With a filmography almost as large as Ford's himself, and from as early a time too. Never had a chance to see this one, though, and always have been told it's a great classic. And here in Amazon you have so many good reviews... so I finally watched it. Hard as it is for me to say this, I have to say: it's no good. It smells too much of mothballs, it's phony, it's over-dramatic, it's pedantic. It's ridiculous. I tried, I tried to be understanding, patient, really, I tried.

They are both natives of the same town in Michigan with Custer living on the poor side of the tracks.The movie follows Custer through his rise through the ranks during the Civil War to his eventual appointment as leader of the ill fated 7th Cavalry.

The film starts off swimmingly enough charting George Armstrong Custer's days as an underachieving dandy at West Point to his rise to glory as he leads a series of successful campaigns in the Civil War.  When the film turns westward is when it starts getting interesting.  See, Custer it turns out, according to the filmmakers,was a champion of Indian rights and the scourge of the government and it's parasitic lobbyists.  Yessir, Custer was ahead of his time.  Not only was he embracing New Deal ideals but progressive 1960s politics as well.  Oh, well, the film is at least entertaining and I'm sure it gets the seal of approval from Custer's descendants.  It's not like that nasty depiction of him in ""Little Big Man"".  Errol Flynn is charismatic as Custer.

286081,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,6301977165,D. Blankenship,"[5, 6]","It is quite easy to completely write this film off unless it is watched with a certain mind-set.  The story, the tale of the rise and well known fall of Gen. George Armstrong Custer, is so historically inaccurate that in many ways it is completely offensive.  About the only aspect of the film is that the screen play does name the characters correctly; most of the time.  All else is complete fabrication.  Now that being said and acknowledged, when I watch this film I attempt to place myself in the position of being a small boy when this film was first made (which indeed I was) and attempt to see the film through that small child's eye in 1948.  Doing so gives the film the break it deserves. Doing this creates a very good movie!Errol Flynn does a wonderful job of playing Errol Flynn; action, devil may care attitude, troubled, egotistical, funny at times, flashy to the point of being overly flamboyant, brave and certainly foolhardy. Flynn through his portrayal of Custer does Flynn well.  This was probably one of Flynn's better pictures (certainly not as good as Robin Hood but that is okay), and was the last that he and Olivia de Havilland (one of my favorites of that era) play together.  Of the others in the cast, Sydney Greenstreet who plays Lt Gen. Winfield Scott delivers what is probably the most believable and historically accurate character in the film. The other stand out of course is Olivia de Havilland who, inadvertently it is true, portrays Custer's wife quite well, not for her strong stance at the end of the film upholding the rights of Native American, but rather for her bulldog determination to add to the Custer ledged as did the real Mrs. Custer.  Mrs. Custer was Gen. Custer's biggest fan in real life and this comes through in the part of the fictional Mrs. Custer of the film.The action sequences, i.e. the battles were quite well shot and of you completely ignore that most of the Civil War action scenes were shot in the western desert and not near Washington, they come out quite well.  Two non-action scenes stand out in my mind as I re-watched this film.  The first was Custer's emotional ""speech"" to the officers when he first arrived as commander of the 7th cavalry at Fort Lincoln.  He stresses the importance of the concept of ""The Regiment,"" as a motivational factor in any army, the demise and problem of which Col. David Hackworth so well discusses in his autobiography ""About Face.""  The second scene is the departing dialog between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland which is quite touching and quite emotional. It is one of those that will stick with you.For those interested in the technical aspects of films shot years ago, pay close attention to the camera angles and in particular the lighting in this film.  It is probably the best of the best up to this point.  New ground was broken here; something that is often overlooked I think.  This VHS tape is of good quality both visually and in sound.Try, as you watch this film, to view it though the mind of a kid in 1948 and try to imagine the story of Custer as Custer should have been, rather than what he was.  Attempt to change your attitude and view the pictures through the eyes of someone with limited historical information and a complete different outlook of what was right and what was wrong.  Accept this as an action picture and ignore this history...trust me, it is the only way to watch it and appreciate it.On the other hand, you can take this film and have quite a lot of fun with friend just pointing out and noting the areas of truth verses fiction, of which there are many even down to the uniforms, weapons and riding tack used in the film.  It can turn into a rather pleasing game on the order of trivial pursuit.I must and am obliged to give this one five stars because it is what it is, and dose what it is in grand style.

There is a poignant scene when the cadet gentlemen of The South decline to swear allegiance to the Union and are dismissed with honour (obviously to participate in the carnage to come). Custer goes on to portray exceptional courage (in leading the charges of the Michigan battalions - three times), on the strength of an accidental promotion. The down-side takes hold with the end of the war and his being removed from the `active list'. He is given a life-line when posted to the Dakotas to honour a treaty with Crazy Horse (played with quiet dignity by Anthony Quinn).

286095,AT04V4H3AO3T5,6301977165,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[6, 6]","For pure movie-going pleasure, there is nothing quite like an Errol Flynn picture, and THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is one of his best. With non-stop humor, high adventure, and romance, this film hits all the right chords to satisfy an escapist-minded audience. Though quite long at nearly two and a half hours, the film is not dull for a moment, and you will likely go away from it with an intense sense of satisfaction. The movie represents entertainment at its purest.THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is the story of George Armstrong Custer (Flynn), from his flamboyant, hilarious arrival at West Point Academy as a new cadet, through his famous last stand at the Little Big Horn. Filled as it is with humor, excitement, and pathos, don't look to this movie for historical accuracy, though many of the events depicted in the film did more or less occur. Custer is portrayed here as a colorful and insubordinate but brilliant cavalry officer who becomes a national hero at Gettysburg after defying orders during the Civil War. After the war, Custer takes a motley, drunken bunch of recruits in the Dakota Territories and molds them into the cavalry's finest fighting unit, while promising peace with Crazy Horse and the local Indian populations. Soon, however, political machinations, sordid business interests, and personal vendettas against Custer conspire to trigger the Black Hills Gold Rush which ultimately compels Custer's 7th Cavalry to undertake their suicide mission against the Sioux at Little Big Horn (in real history, it was Custer himself who triggered the gold rush and broke the Indian treaties).Olivia de Havilland puts in her obligatory performance as Flynn's love interest Elizabeth Bacon (this was her 8th and final movie with Flynn and the first without director Michael Curtiz) and she is especially appealing and beautiful in her part. Anthony Quinn, in one his early roles, plays the Sioux chief Crazy Horse who is first captured then placated and then unwillingly betrayed by Custer. Everyone's favorite movie ""fat man,"" Sydney Greenstreet plays Union general-in-chief Winfield Scott who is charmed by Custer and who then grants him his first command. Arthur Kennedy plays the malevolent Ned Sharp, the war profiteer, land speculator, and former classmate of Custer who orchestrates Custer's downfall with his cynical profit motives. Hattie McDaniel makes an appearance in her ""Mammy"" persona, as the matchmaking housemaid Callie who helps Custer in his attempts to court Elizabeth.THE DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is a fun movie and some of Errol Flynn's favorite attributes are on display as the affable, independent, irreverent hero. Though none of George Custer's more fatal blemishes are depicted here, one does not go to an Errol Flynn movie expecting to see a flawed hero. So indeed, he is portrayed as a champion of Native American territorial rights and a fierce enemy of political corruption who goes willingly to his grave in order to indict the debased system. Fine American action director Raoul Walsh (HIGH SIERRA, WHITE HEAT) provides us with thoroughly rousing action sequences and adventure that entertains from start to finish.Jeremy W.

After a period of forced retirement in the postwar years, Custer is put in charge of the 7th Cavalry in the Dakota Territory. Here he whips this ragtag group into spit-and-polish shape, and also does his best to extend a neighborly hand to the local Indian tribes. Custer even goes so far as to promise Chief Crazy Horse (Quinn) that the white man will never set foot in the sacred Black Hills. Alas, Custer is betrayed by greedy gold prospectors, whipped into a frenzy by scheming land speculator Ned Sharp. Forced by circumstances to do battle against Crazy Horse to prevent tribal retaliation, Custer and his command ride towards a rendezvous with destiny at the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876.Historical inaccuracies abound but it's a great story and well told!This film represented the final screen pairing of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, a fact that lends poignancy to their classic parting scene.

In the case of THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON, the producers totally abandoned any semblance of truth to present a vision of the life and death of General George Armstrong Custer that was then fully resonant with the burgeoning militarism of 1941 Hollywood.  I know that it is difficult for current moviegoers to possibly envision an artistic elite that supports and glorifies traditional American values, but back in pre-Pearl Harbor days, political correctness meant flag waving, not flag burning. What Hollywood wanted was a flashy dashing hero who could be both charming and heroic at the same time.  In Errol Flynn, America could see a distorted version of the egotistical and megalomaniacal glory hunter that Custer truly was, but Flynn's interpretation played down that part of him and emphasized an altruistic side that is so breathtaking in its centrality to Custer's film persona, that movie audiences could see in Flynn-Custer a hearkening back to the frontier hero that America was to need to buttress itself for the looming war.  Director Raoul Walsh essentially films a vastly entertaining war cartoon that allows Flynn to pair with Olivia DeHavilland to maintain a love interest that forms the background for the many action scenes. And what action scenes there are.  Flynn is seen attacking Confederate positions in cavalry charges with more than a little tongue in cheek. But in the second half, the mood and tempo change when Flynn takes his militancy out west to fight Indians.  The smiling Flynn of the Civil War becomes the serious Flynn of the Far West.  As Custer, Flynn is prepared to sacrifice his entire 7th Cavalry to save the greater body of troops of his commander, General Terry.  The climactic massacre at the Battle of the Little Big Horn shows a more megalomaniacal side to Custer than what Director Walsh probably intended.  In the hours preceeding the battle, Flynn's facial expression and voice well indicate a man who is stoically resigned to die merely for a higher cause.  When the film's villain, played by Arthur Kennedy, asks him why he is doing this, Custer replies: ""For glory or to hell. It depends on your perspective."" My perspective was that Custer chose both at the same time. It is this odd pairing of wildly divergent viewpoints that make this gross distortion of history an entertaining film--even if I had to wonder whether Custer cared a hoot about the 198 troopers under his command.",4,Ignore the Historical Flaws: Solid Drama,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,2626,"['When', 'filmmakers', 'decide', 'take', 'actual', 'events', 'place', 'screen', 'face', 'difficult', 'decision', 'what', 'extant', 'will', 'tinker', 'truth', 'score', 'dramatic', 'points', 'case', 'THEY', 'DIED', 'WITH', 'THEIR', 'BOOTS', 'ON', 'producers', 'totally', 'abandoned', 'semblance', 'truth', 'present', 'vision', 'life', 'death', 'General', 'George', 'Armstrong', 'Custer', 'was', 'then', 'fully', 'resonant', 'burgeoning', 'militarism', '1941', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'difficult', 'current', 'moviegoers', 'possibly', 'envision', 'artistic', 'elite', 'glorifies', 'traditional', 'American', 'values', 'back', 'pre-Pearl', 'Harbor', 'days', 'political', 'correctness', 'meant', 'flag', 'waving', 'not', 'flag', 'burning', 'What', 'Hollywood', 'wanted', 'was', 'flashy', 'dashing', 'hero', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'charming', 'heroic', 'same', 'time', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'America', 'could', 'see', 'distorted', 'version', 'egotistical', 'megalomaniacal', 'glory', 'hunter', 'Custer', 'truly', 'was', 'Flynn', 'interpretation', 'played', 'down', 'part', 'emphasized', 'altruistic', 'side', 'so', 'breathtaking', 'centrality', 'Custer', 'film', 'persona', 'movie', 'audiences', 'could', 'see', 'Flynn-Custer', 'hearkening', 'back', 'frontier', 'hero', 'America', 'was', 'need', 'buttress', 'looming', 'war', 'Director', 'Raoul', 'Walsh', 'essentially', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'war', 'cartoon', 'Flynn', 'pair', 'Olivia', 'DeHavilland', 'maintain', 'love', 'interest', 'background', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'what', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'Flynn', 'seen', 'attacking', 'Confederate', 'positions', 'cavalry', 'charges', 'more', 'little', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'second', 'half', 'mood', 'tempo', 'change', 'when', 'Flynn', 'militancy', 'out', 'west', 'fight', 'Indians', 'smiling', 'Flynn', 'Civil', 'War', 'serious', 'Flynn', 'Far', 'West', 'Custer', 'Flynn', 'prepared', 'sacrifice', 'entire', '7th', 'Cavalry', 'save', 'greater', 'body', 'troops', 'commander', 'General', 'Terry', 'climactic', 'massacre', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'more', 'megalomaniacal', 'side', 'Custer', 'what', 'Director', 'Walsh', 'probably', 'intended', 'hours', 'preceeding', 'battle', 'Flynn', 'facial', 'expression', 'voice', 'well', 'indicate', 'man', 'who', 'stoically', 'resigned', 'die', 'merely', 'higher', 'cause', 'When', 'film', 'villain', 'played', 'Arthur', 'Kennedy', 'why', 'doing', 'Custer', 'glory', 'hell', 'perspective', 'perspective', 'was', 'Custer', 'chose', 'same', 'time', 'odd', 'pairing', 'wildly', 'divergent', 'viewpoints', 'make', 'gross', 'distortion', 'history', 'entertaining', 'film', 'even', 'had', 'wonder', 'Custer', 'cared', 'hoot', '198', 'troopers', 'command']",N/A

It is the last movie that Flynn shares with Olivia de Havilland, and their chemistry shared over a long film marriage is touching and palpable.  Flynn's interpretation was to play Custer as a western version of his own hell-raising self, and he dominates each scene in which he appears.  He is alternately heroic, funny, sarcastic, haughty, and sacriligious.  His co-stars very capably allow Flynn to bounce off them.  Against Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), Flynn is solemn and candid.  Against General Winfield Scott (Sidney Greenstreet), he is properly subservient. Against his Indian hating subordinate officer played by Arthur Kennedy, he is full of righteous fury.  The climactic battle at the Little Big Horn is a paean to self-sacrifice and honor.  The film does not go wrong internally.  Its fault, if one can call it that, is that it bears no relation to historical truth.  Every major incident in the film from Custer's days in West Point, to his conduct under battle, to his relationship to his wife, and to his role in the annihilation of him and his troopers at the Little Big Horn are either grossly exaggerated or outrageous lies.  Especially disturbing is the movie's suggestion that Custer sacrificed the lives of the men under his command as a means of political expedience.  The literal truth was Custer and all his 7th Cavalry were slaughtered only because of his obstinancy in not believing the reports of his Indian guides.To pass judgment on TDWTBO is to walk a shaky line between lauding a shiny object without questioning too deeply about what makes that object shine.

We see the American Indian portrayed as a wronged people. &quot;..If I were Sioux I would fight.&quot;  We see true friendship, true bravery, true honor.  The only thing we don't see is a true story.It would take much too long to go through every rewrite history goes through in this picture, but who cares.  If you want history; buy Ken Burns THE CIVIL WAR.  This movie is fun.  Flynn idolized Custer is just as unhistorical as Richard Mulligan's brillant performance in LITTLE BIG MAN but no less brillant.The movie is properly compared to Kevin Costner in ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES and Michael Keaton in BATMAN in the following sense.

The ""Custer scholars"" belittle it because of historical inaccuracies while the ""politically correct"" denounce it as a lionization of Custer.  Folks should realize this is nothing more than an entertaining historical novel transferred to the silver screen.  Please keep in mind this was made in 1942 - during Hollywood's Golden Age and at the start of the U.S. entry into WWII.  Movie makers weren't interested in giving history lessons, but providing entertainment pure and simple.  They made movies as a form of escapism (remember the timeframe this was made) AND to get people into the theaters buying popcorn.  These ""novels"" also helped to define the best in heroes - whether these heroes were manufactured or not.  There is no other way to put it - approach this ""action-and-romance"" movie with the notion of being thoroughly entertained - and you will not be disappointed!  This movie is so good; I did not even knock off stars for the quality of the discs themselves.  I had to try 3 different merchants and return several DVDs before I had one that did not freeze or skip.  4 of the discs I exchanged all froze in the same places (scenes 23-25).

286125,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6301977165,Simon Davis,"[23, 23]","Mammoth is the only way to describe the Raoul Walsh directed tribute to Brig. General George Armstrong Custer, &quot;They Died With Their Boots On&quot;. As stated by previous reviewers much of the story as depicted in this film is fiction, but what a story!! It would have to be one of the most entertaining and thoughtfully put together epic productions of this time and th eattention to detail is evident in every frame of this film.Errol Flynn, at the peak of his career when this film went before the cameras in 1941 had the role of a life time in Custer and indeed he looks remarkably like the illustrations that survive of what Custer actually looked like. Not since the classic &quot;The Adventures Of Robin Hood&quot; had Flynn been handed such a diverse and challenging role as this and once again he proves what a fine actor he could be given proper material to work with. His development from the cocky and raw recruit at West Point through to his fateful encounters with Chief Crazy Horse leading up to the last tragic stand at Little Big Horn where he learns about humility and tolerance for others, provides him with a remarkable acting chore which he handles with aplomb. Despite the fictionised settings and situations you can believe that Flynn is Custer.  The film also marked the last time that Errol Flynn was teamed with Olivia de Havilland after a long series of memorable screen appearances together starting with the classic &quot;Captain Blood&quot; They have a magical screen chemistry together and both excell in their work in this film. Olivia de havilland had a unique acting style whereby she could play submissive types while always injecting them with a slic eof independant character that shone through on the screen. Her Elizabeth Bacon Custer wife of the famous general is such a character and it has over the decades become one of her most loved characterisations.&quot;They Died With Their Boots On&quot; delivers a battery of top flight supporting performances from its cast. First and foremost Anthony Quinn is excellent as the famous Chief Crazy Horse. His portrayal shows a multi faceted Indian character far from the nameless hostile Indians normally portayed in such epics set in the west. Charley Grapevine as the tobacco chewing best buddy of Custer who goes down with him in the last stand of Little Big Horn is also excellent in his comical handling of the many dangerous situations he finds himself in with Custer. Arthur Kennedy as fellow West Point graduate Edward Sharp, the villian of the story who is ultimately responsible for re-igniting war with the Indians also shines in his scenes as the constant opponent of Custer's plans. Sydney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott in a non traditional role of sorts for him also adds dramatic tension to the story during its civil war period and the alway superb Hattie McDaniel playing a variation on her Mammy character is reunited with Olivia de Havilland post &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; in the role of the match making Callie.&quot;Boots&quot; is ably directed by action man Raoul Walsh who obtained the assignment after Errol Flynn adamently refused to have Michael Curtiz assigne dto the production. He and Flynn, while producing great work on screen never got along and their clashes on numerous productions were legendary. Here Walsh is in familiar territory and he keeps the action moving at break neck pace throughout the films very long running time. Indeed despite its length I feel the film never lags at all and constantly injects new elements of interest to keep the attention fixed on what is happening. The film can be almost divided into two sections, that dealing with Custers early life and involvement in th ecivil war and secondly his married life and return to service with exploration of America's west taking place. The battle scenes of the film are some of the best put on film and during filming a number of extras and horses lost their lives so involved where some of the action shots being filmed. The last tragic stand at Little Big Horn is superb entertainment and guaranteed to move you greatly as Custer finds himself in an impossible situation. Prior to this battle in the last scene that Flynn shares with de havilland where he knows he will probably not return Flynn's acting reached new heights of maturity and conviction rarely seen in his work up until then.The production as a whole does not suffer at all from being filmed in black and white. Indeed the period flavour is beautifully captured here and Warner Bother's spent a fortune on getting every historical detail just right. It shows in the horsemanship displayed, in the costumes, period interiors and in the resemblance that most of the actors have for those characters that were not fictional.Errol Flynn did some fine action films in his peak period from 1937 through to the late 40's howver never has he been better than in &quot;They Died With Their Boots On&quot; I recommend this film to you not as an accurate historical lesson of an important period in America's history but as a fine action film filled with great dramatics, sterling performances and a good insight into life back in those earlier times when America was still a new country.

286126,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301977165,T O'Brien,"[6, 6]","They Died With Their Boots On is a very good semi-biography about George Armstrong Custer.  The movie follows him from his adventurous West Point days through his time in the Civil War and then as the leader of the heroic Seventh Cavalry.  At some points, the story slows down a bit, but it is still an entertaining film.  The action scenes are pretty good with the massacre at the Little Big Horn standing out as the best.  Many of the things portrayed in the movie may not be the most accurate, but this does not take away from the story which flows along pretty well.  However, the last 30 minutes do have a much darker tone as the Seventh Cavalry marches into glory.This movie chooses to portray George Armstrong Custer in the romantic light.  It does not portray him in a bad light at all.  His decision at the end to sacrifice himself and the regiment to prove a point to the greedy landowners is pretty ridiculous since in reality Custer wanted all the glory of defeating the whole Sioux nation.  Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland join together again and are perfect once again.  Flynn plays Custer perfectly with the right amount of arrogance with de Havilland great as his supportive wife, Libby.
