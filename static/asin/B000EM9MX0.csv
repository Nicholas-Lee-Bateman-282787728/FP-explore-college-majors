I'm shocked that more people don't know about it, and even more shocked that it never received a proper DVD release.  This movie is hilarious -- definitely a ""Spinal Tap"" for country music....but it's not a rip-off of Spinal Tap.  Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses.  I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution).  It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.  But it's so much better than that.  In Summary:  A great parody that I can watch again and again.",4,"If you don't know Dill, you don't know...Dill",1242777600,"05 20, 2009",2009,673,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'more', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'never', 'received', 'proper', 'DVD', 'release', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'definitely', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'country', 'music', 'not', 'rip-off', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Country', 'music', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'funny', 'cast', 'great', 'actors/actresses', 'hope', 'film', 'someday', 'light', 'day', 'i.e', 'major', 'distribution', 'was', 'originally', 'only', 'available', 'rental', 'purchase', 'VHS', 'Blockbuster', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Summary', 'great', 'parody', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Dill Scallion - Collector's Edition

I wore out 2 VHS tapes before they finally released the DVD.  And like other reviewers, I'm really surprised that it didn't earn a bigger release hullabaloo.  Particularly with the rise of 'claw-n-scratch-my-way-up-off-the-D-List' Ms. Kathy Griffin on board.  The Mockumentary genre has (at least in my opinion) grown up to be a bit too contrived and polished.  While still funny, it feels like everyone's figured out the recipe. Dill Scallion brings us back to all the deliciously awkward/painful stuff that made Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman so wonderful.  I'd love for it to get the attention it deserves, but I also like being the one to introduce Dill to unsuspecting friends. Yee-haw, loyal Scallionaires!",5,Am I selfish?
