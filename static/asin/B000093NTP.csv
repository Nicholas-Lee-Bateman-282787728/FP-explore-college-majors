751620,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000093NTP,Brian E. Erland,"[10, 10]","Released in '03, `The Last Cowboy' is a made-for-television movie that has all the ingredients we have come to expect from a film aired by Hallmark affiliates; rural setting, tight-knit community, broken parent/child relationship and the trials and tribulations of mending that brokenness and re-establishing the bonds of forgiveness and love.In `The Last Cowboy' the child now adult is played by Jennie Garth. That alone makes it worth the watch for me. Jennie, I mean Jacqueline Cooper returns to the family ranch to attend her Grandfather's funeral fully aware of the fact that her appearance will ellicit a confrontation with her estranged Father (Lance Henriksen) and force her to deal with their strained relationship that has only worsened during her years of absence. Jacqueline soon discovers that the ranch is in deep financial difficulties and the only way to save the family estate is for the two of them to put aside their familial difficulties and work together to find a solution to their mutual problem. Of course you already know how this one will end don't you?There are no surprises here but it's an enjoyable family film and Jennie Garth is lovely so give it a try.",3,"""Every Day Doing Something You Love"" ~ Repairing Fences & Relationships",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,1185,"['Released', ""'03"", 'Last', 'Cowboy', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'ingredients', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'film', 'aired', 'Hallmark', 'affiliates', 'rural', 'setting', 'tight-knit', 'community', 'broken', 'parent/child', 'relationship', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'mending', 'brokenness', 're-establishing', 'bonds', 'forgiveness', 'love.In', 'Last', 'Cowboy', 'child', 'now', 'played', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'alone', 'watch', 'Jennie', 'mean', 'Jacqueline', 'Cooper', 'family', 'ranch', 'attend', 'Grandfather', 'funeral', 'fully', 'aware', 'fact', 'appearance', 'will', 'ellicit', 'confrontation', 'estranged', 'Father', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'force', 'deal', 'strained', 'relationship', 'only', 'worsened', 'years', 'absence', 'Jacqueline', 'soon', 'ranch', 'deep', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'family', 'estate', 'two', 'put', 'aside', 'familial', 'difficulties', 'work', 'together', 'find', 'solution', 'mutual', 'problem', 'course', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'will', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'surprises', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'film', 'Jennie', 'Garth', 'lovely', 'so', 'give', 'try']",The Last Cowboy

751628,A84HFAB5HSZEO,B000093NTP,K. A. Connelly,"[0, 0]",This story has potential - and the scenery and the heroine were beautiful.  I'd say it was worth watching - even a second time.  I think it's also worth re-doing as a film . . .The only things I'd change are:> The man she falls in love with is too hard towards her.  He may miss his previous wife but there is no reason to be as unkind as he is throughout the movie.> His bringing the pony in at the end is a little lame.  Again - if he hadn't been such a jerk throughout the movie his offering at the end might have made more sense.> The actor is fine . . . . I just think his character could have been softened up a little bit.The gal that plays in this movie is so worth watching that she almost pulls this movie off in the end by herself.,3,"Good drama, scenery and heroine",1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,742,"['story', 'potential', 'scenery', 'heroine', 'were', 'beautiful', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'second', 'time', 'think', 'also', 'worth', 're-doing', 'film', 'only', 'things', ""'d"", 'change', 'are', 'man', 'love', 'too', 'hard', 'may', 'miss', 'previous', 'wife', 'reason', 'be', 'as', 'unkind', 'movie.', '>', 'bringing', 'pony', 'end', 'little', 'lame', 'Again', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'such', 'jerk', 'movie', 'offering', 'end', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense.', 'actor', 'fine', 'just', 'think', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'softened', 'up', 'little', 'bit.The', 'gal', 'movie', 'so', 'worth', 'watching', 'almost', 'movie', 'end', 'herself']",The Last Cowboy

And this one sure fits the bill.  This one was done rather well.  And I guess I'm always surprised at how much I'm liking Jennie Garth.  I never cared for her on her TV series, but I sure like how she does in movies.  Especially the sugar-sweet ones.  Like her a lot here.  I like her spunky cowgirl vibe, her spunky mother vibe and her spunky take-no-nonsense-from-her-father vibe that she uses in this movie.  Throw in some great horse shots, some hunky men and I'm done for.  Lance has gotten the gruff, grouchy man down pat, like in most of his later movies.  He does soften in the end, and isn't that what we all were waiting for?  Watching him become a grandfather is so touching.  You couldn't ask for better landscapes to be mesmerized by, either.
