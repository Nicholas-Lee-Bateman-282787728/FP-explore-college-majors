878126,A2X1OCV002VU1Q,B00078JZ74,Dsire,"[0, 0]","Ashutosh Gowariker has produced another masterpiece!  Swades is a story of Mohan Bargava (Shah Rukh Khan) a Project Manager working for NASA in Washington. Bargava feels guilt at neglecting Kavariamma, who he considers his second mother, and goes to India seeking her.  In the short time he is there, he sees the underlying problems of village life and is instrumental in implementing some changes.  With the help of two men from different castes, he brings the children of different castes together to attend school, and engage the villagers when providing electricity for the village.  Mohan Bargava is in the middle of a project at NASA.  Will he succeed in bringing Kavariamma with him to the US?  Will the girl he fell in love with return with him?  Will he be able to give up living what is considered a good life, having all the comforts one can possibly want through a high-paying job at NASA, and relocate to India where he can use his knowledge and skills to improve village life!  Will nostalgia for his native land prompt his decision?  The film denotes a certain freedom in living a simple life, and a definite satisfaction when giving of one's self!  Playing the role of Mohan Bargava, SRK portrays a range of emotions, expressions and mannerisms that are as natural and distinctive of him.  His ability to mimic the mannerisms of another is interestingly funny and comes through in the film...at least I thought so!  The movie is entertainingly heartwarming and soul-searching, with a desire to follow a calling, a chosen path!  Watch this blockbuster movie to see what life changing decisions will be made.  It's a film on humanitarian needs that I believe, calls to every educated person!  Although SRK is phenomenal in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" and amazing in ""Bhadshah"" I've watched this one the most!  After two attempts at purchasing the DVD, I am happy to have this bonus package!  It contains two disks.  Disk 1 is the feature film and disk 2 has special features such as the making of the film, actors' interviews and deleted scenes which, in my opinion, should have been included in the film and other minor parts deleted.  The film is long enough but it would have been worth it.  I am very pleased to have both disks!",5,Swades,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,2240,"['Ashutosh', 'Gowariker', 'produced', 'masterpiece', 'Swades', 'story', 'Mohan', 'Bargava', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'Project', 'Manager', 'working', 'NASA', 'Washington', 'Bargava', 'guilt', 'neglecting', 'Kavariamma', 'who', 'second', 'mother', 'India', 'seeking', 'short', 'time', 'there', 'underlying', 'problems', 'village', 'life', 'instrumental', 'implementing', 'changes', 'help', 'two', 'men', 'different', 'castes', 'children', 'different', 'castes', 'together', 'attend', 'school', 'engage', 'villagers', 'when', 'providing', 'electricity', 'village', 'Mohan', 'Bargava', 'middle', 'project', 'NASA', 'Will', 'succeed', 'bringing', 'Kavariamma', 'US', 'Will', 'girl', 'fell', 'love', 'return', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'give', 'up', 'living', 'what', 'considered', 'good', 'life', 'having', 'comforts', 'one', 'can', 'possibly', 'want', 'high-paying', 'job', 'NASA', 'relocate', 'India', 'where', 'can', 'use', 'knowledge', 'skills', 'improve', 'village', 'life', 'Will', 'native', 'land', 'prompt', 'decision', 'film', 'certain', 'freedom', 'living', 'simple', 'life', 'definite', 'satisfaction', 'when', 'giving', 'one', 'self', 'Playing', 'role', 'Mohan', 'Bargava', 'SRK', 'range', 'emotions', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'natural', 'distinctive', 'ability', 'mimic', 'mannerisms', 'interestingly', 'funny', 'through', 'film', 'least', 'thought', 'so', 'movie', 'entertainingly', 'heartwarming', 'soul-searching', 'desire', 'follow', 'calling', 'chosen', 'path', 'Watch', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'changing', 'decisions', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'humanitarian', 'needs', 'believe', 'educated', 'person', 'SRK', 'phenomenal', 'Rab', 'Ne', 'Bana', 'Di', 'Jodi', 'amazing', 'Bhadshah', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'most', 'two', 'attempts', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'bonus', 'package', 'two', 'disks', 'Disk', '1', 'feature', 'film', 'disk', '2', 'special', 'features', 'such', 'making', 'film', 'actors', 'interviews', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'film', 'other', 'minor', 'parts', 'deleted', 'film', 'long', 'enough', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'have', 'disks']",Swades

878129,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00078JZ74,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","Plot SPOILERS here and there...So, Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) is an NRI, a Non-Resident Indian. Mohan is busy living the American dream in Washington, D.C., residing in cushy digs and fostering a thriving career as a NASA engineer. And his request for U.S. citizenship has just been approved. Yet, something is missing in Mohan's very good life. On the latest anniversary of the death of his parents, he fondly recalls his nanny, who had raised him and is the last living tie to his parents. On a whim, Mohan goes on vacation to visit his beloved nanny in India. It's a decision that will change his life...SWADES is a good movie, a really good movie, and directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar, who made the awesome epic Lagaan - Once Upon a Time in India. And, like LAGAAN, SWADES is more than your standard Bollywood fluff. Both pictures have things to say about their native country, and both pictures say these things well. SWADES is not as dramatic or as excitingly paced as LAGAAN, and not as filled with cinematic thrills (SWADES, for one thing, doesn't have the sport of cricket to drive the plot). And yet, for all of its more than three hours of running time, SWADES does not ever stop being immensely watchable and moving.While LAGAAN hearkens back to a time in the past and recalls an event in which India's rustic natives were able to beat the English at their own game, SWADES tries for a more modern form of patriotism. Mohan Bhargava, as mentioned, is a non-resident Indian who returns to his roots, initially to spend time with his nanny. But the remote village in which he finds himself impacts him overwhelmingly, to the point where he begins to question his worldviews.Progress is slow in certain parts of India. For each metropolitan like New Delhi and Mumbai, there are hundreds of overlooked villages who barely have education and electricity. In tiny Charanpur, Mohan meets Geeta (Gayatri Joshi), a half-remembered childhood playmate and now a school teacher. Gita looks askance at Mohan's RV, with all its modern amenities. She's slow to thaw to Mohan, believing (accurately) that Mohan intends to steal away her nanny, who is like a second mother to her (yes, this nanny is the same one Mohan had come to visit). Geeta is beautiful and independent (""There's more to a woman than just wearing bangles."") and fights so hard to provide education for all the children of Charanpur. You see, old ways are so very hard to change. The prevalent thinking is that little girls do not need school. And segregation of castes is strictly enforced. So no mixing of kids in school. Geeta fights hard, but it's a futile thing. Education and electricity. The village of Charanpur does have electricity, but infrequently. These are only some of the things to which Mohan is exposed. But they set the ball rolling, as Mohan's eyes are gradually opened to the inequalities and abject poverty of his homeland.Two of the most wrenching (and memorable) moments in the film happen as Mohan travels many hours by train and boat to demand rent from a farmer. But, it turns out, this is a farmer so very ashamed of his inability to pay and so destitute he finds it a constant struggle to feed his starved family. Yet the farmer finds the wherewithal to share his meager food with Mohan. That heartbreaking scene is then followed by a stopover at a railway station, as Mohan sees a simple little boy desperately attempting to get the passengers to buy a glass of water for a coin. Dare ya. Dare ya not to feel something at these scenes.But there are joyous moments, as well. One such moment pops up early in the film, as Mohan, enroute to Charanpur in his rigged-out RV, picks up a shaggy-haired wild man, which is all a lead-in to the invigorating, toe-tapping road song ""Yun Hi Chala Chal"" (""Keep Wandering""). Then there's that one evening when, as a power failure cuts short a film screening taking place in the village square, Mohan gives a lesson about the stars to the village children.(Plot SPOILER really comin' up now, in this next paragraph.)Big things stem from little things. One of my favorite moments is Mohan, having finally fully committed to the betterment of Charanpur, using his engineering savvy and pulling the villagers together in a massive project to provide electricity...for one light bulb. These scenes play out so well that you can't help but be touched by the payoff, when the recipient of that sole lit bulb, in a dismal hut, brokenly caresses one word: ""Electricity.""Shahrukh Khan has made a lucrative film career out of histrionics. And it's a thumbs up to his talents that we realize he's overacting and yet are still vastly entertained by his movies. But SWADES finds a different Shahrukh, one who is more restrained and, therefore, even more effective. How is SWADES as watchable as LAGAAN? Simple. Shahrukh Khan. SWADES, being mostly an internal story and telling of one man's self-discovery, depends largely on Shahrukh's reactions, his ability to convey emotions, his underplaying. When Shahrukh stops messing around and actually acts for real, as he does here, he becomes even more magnetic on screen.Not that he's by himself in all this. The supporting cast is mostly excellent, and particularly Gayatri Joshi. SWADES marks her film debut, not that you could tell by it. A striking beauty, Gayatri's acting is nothing but self-assured and fiery. She and Shahrukh spark in their scenes together. Also memorable are the actors who play Mohan's nanny, the postmaster/wrestler (really great!), and the ambitious cook. However, the actors who play the NASA folks fare poorly (not counting Shahrukh, naturally).SWADES is, more than anything else, a heartfelt valentine to India. A valentine, and also a bit of a dis. Love of country is counterpointed by the lead character's assertions that changes do need to be effected in certain repressive aspects of Indian culture and tradition. As one character tells Mohan, so is SWADES telling its homeland: ""Go light your bulb.""This movie is over three hours long, and I enjoyed every minute.",5,"""Go on, O Traveller.

During his visit to her village, he is deeply affected by the social ills he sees there. This isn't the rosy picture of India found in most Bollywood films and it pointedly criticizes the oppressiveness of the caste system. Mohan comes to care about the villagers, finds ways to help them, and challenges them to help themselves. And he falls in love with his childhood friend, Gita (Gayatri Joshi), who runs the local school. The movie celebrates what's wonderful about Indian life without ignoring its flaws and likewise shows what's missing in America while championing its values of equality. The plodding pacing and the stiff interaction between Mohan and Gita mar this otherwise fine film.
