After two people that clearly dislike each other have been forced to work together, French Capt. Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) and U.S. Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) they decide the only thing the can do is get married. All this would be fine except for one thing. The U.S. government forms for bringing a spouse back to the U.S. assumes the spouse is female (hence bride.) After several attempts to correct this oversight it is apparent the there is only one way to get on board the ship. A horse is missing a tail and a lanky spouse is having problems with high heals.

Catherine wants to return to America, but Henri will only be permitted immediate entry to the states if he becomes a &quot;war bride&quot;. Then the fun starts!In this wonderful film which is based on a true story, and set in Germany just at the end of WWII, Cary Grant plays slightly cranky, but ever so charming French Army officer Henri Rochard. Ann Sheridan plays the American Army Lieutenant Catherine Gates who is sent on several assignments with him for the French Economic Mission.They have a seemingly hate/hate relationship (on a previous occasion she pushes him into a vat of blue dye - in fact some part of him is still blue, but we are not told which part!)In true screwball comedy fashion they set off on a motorbike on their mission and it is only after they end up in the middle of a haystack that they admit their true feelings.Having decided to get married, they discover that they are tied up in a whole roll of military red tape, and have to forego their wedding night to travel back to the States. BUT - the only way Henri can gain entry to the States is as a warbride - well, you can imagine the comic possibilities to be made out of that one!He is unable to get on the boat until he dresses up as a female American Army officer, complete with a very fetching bob made out of a horse's tail. He makes a horrible woman, but oh what a gorgeous man!I loved this film. It is a brilliant, sparkling comedy that leaves you with a big smile on your face for ages afterwards. The barbed banter between Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan is spot on. Some of my favourite scenes - Henri trapped in Catherine's bedroom and how awkward and uncomfortable he looks trying to sleep on the chair (he never seems to be able to get a decent bed for the night!), the scene where he is filling out the form which is patently designed for female warbrides - the question &quot;Any female trouble?&quot; is met with a terse &quot;Nothing but, sergeant&quot;!Oh, it was so good, I'm off to watch it all over again!",5,I Was a Male War Bride,1048464000,"03 24, 2003",2003,2119,"['Plot', 'Henri', 'French', 'captain', 'Catherine', 'assistant', 'American', 'WAC', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'married', 'Catherine', 'return', 'America', 'Henri', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'permitted', 'immediate', 'entry', 'states', 'quot', 'war', 'quot', 'Then', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'set', 'Germany', 'just', 'end', 'WWII', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'slightly', 'cranky', 'ever', 'so', 'charming', 'French', 'Army', 'officer', 'Henri', 'Rochard', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'American', 'Army', 'Lieutenant', 'Catherine', 'Gates', 'who', 'sent', 'several', 'assignments', 'French', 'Economic', 'Mission.They', 'have', 'seemingly', 'hate/hate', 'relationship', 'previous', 'occasion', 'vat', 'blue', 'dye', 'fact', 'part', 'still', 'blue', 'are', 'not', 'told', 'part', 'true', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'fashion', 'set', 'off', 'motorbike', 'mission', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'middle', 'haystack', 'admit', 'true', 'feelings.Having', 'decided', 'get', 'married', 'discover', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'whole', 'roll', 'military', 'red', 'tape', 'have', 'forego', 'wedding', 'night', 'travel', 'back', 'States', 'BUT', 'only', 'way', 'Henri', 'can', 'gain', 'entry', 'States', 'warbride', 'well', 'can', 'imagine', 'comic', 'possibilities', 'be', 'made', 'one', 'unable', 'get', 'boat', 'up', 'female', 'American', 'Army', 'officer', 'complete', 'very', 'fetching', 'bob', 'made', 'horse', 'tail', 'horrible', 'woman', 'what', 'gorgeous', 'man', 'loved', 'film', 'brilliant', 'sparkling', 'comedy', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'ages', 'afterwards', 'barbed', 'banter', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'spot', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'Henri', 'trapped', 'Catherine', 'bedroom', 'how', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'trying', 'sleep', 'chair', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'decent', 'bed', 'night', 'scene', 'where', 'filling', 'out', 'form', 'patently', 'designed', 'female', 'warbrides', 'question', 'quot', 'Any', 'female', 'trouble', 'quot', 'met', 'terse', 'quot', 'Nothing', 'sergeant', 'quot', 'Oh', 'was', 'so', 'good', ""'m"", 'watch', 'over', 'again']",I Was a Male War Bride VHS

Ann Sheridan is often underrated and certainly died too young. Together, they make a fairly predictable pair in a fairly predictable film.

Neither like each other then (of course) fall madly in love (in a hay stack, of all places). They get married, mix ups ensue, they have to get him legally in to America but all the rules are written for war Brides (not war Husbands). Cary Grant has to get aboard the departing ship to America but can only do it if he disguises himself as a war Bride. As handsome as he is, he does not make a good looking woman!

356325,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,6303102441,Einsatz,"[2, 10]","Although it's not initially obvious, there's a history between Cary Grant (as French officer Henri Rochard) and Ann Sheridan (as Lieutenant Catherine Gates), and it's all bad.  They've been on missions before and they've all ended poorly.  Frenchman Henri wants nothing to do with ""that American"" woman and the feeling is mutual.  So, to prove their dislike, they bicker, and snipe, and shout at one another, endlessly, viciously.  They carry this verbal abuse through most of the movie; it's clear they hate one another, they even say so.  Now here comes the confusing part, this movie is billed as a romantic comedy.  But.  I kept waiting for the romance and the humor to kick in, where was it?  Instead, this tedious couple keeps up a steady flow of putdowns as they try their level best to humiliate and one-up one another.  Before this story of disharmony creaked to an end (that I figured would result in the murder of one or the other), snap!  He takes a nap, wakes up, and calls her darling, and two seconds later, they want to get ""hitched, not itch.""  When did sarcasm and disrespect turn into foreplay?  It's been my experience that when people have that level of hatred for one another it's neither funny nor the sound basis of a good marriage.  Yet, they marry 3 times: in German, in French, and by the army.I was stunned when I learned this was based on Henri Rochard's biography, I Was An Alien Spouse Of Female Military Personnel Enroute To The United States Under Public Law 271 Of The Congress.  One has to assume then that this was a true story (except for being French, Henri Rochard was Belgian).  If true, I can't help but wonder how long that marriage lasted and was it perfectly harmonious from that point on?At any rate, I didn't/couldn't enjoy this movie because the level of anger was too off-putting to be considered funny.  I don't enjoy watching ill-treatment of anyone by anyone and certainly not for entertainment sake.  Unless this was a promotion for anger management or marriage counseling, I don't see what purpose it served.

356327,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303102441,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","This is based on a true story, believe it or not. In postwar Germany, French Army Captain Henri Rochard (Grant) and American WAC Lieutenant Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) fiercely don't get along, only they keep getting paired up on missions. Still, no one will be flabbergasted to learn that Henri and Catherine eventually fall in love and decide to marry. We get a hint of what Cary Grant is in for when the happy couple must undergo three marriage ceremonies, one dictated by German civic regs. Back in the day, in an era in which movies culminate in wedding vows, their getting married halfway thru the film was a fresh twist, even subversive.On her wedding night, when Catherine's new marching orders call for her to report back to American soil, is when the film really puts Grant thru his paces. Seeking a way to pass thru the U.S. border, Henri, a foreigner, finds a loophole in the shape of a Congressional Act called Public Law #271 which regulates the immigration of war brides. Of course, the closed-minded military assumption is that since Henri is the spouse of a U.S. Armed Forces officer, Henri by default must be a woman.1949's I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE isn't the best Cary Grant screwball comedy, but it does offer plenty of really funny moments and a pace that moves. Never mind that Grant doesn't even try to affect a French accent. Grant owns whatever film he's in, and it's no different here. This iconic guy was celebrated for his patented urbane demeanor and his knack for physical slapstick, for his classic good looks and his distinctive line delivery. But, to me, what made him so awesome were the sublime expressions that crawled across his face as he reacted to whatever zany stuff was going on around him. No one pulled off looking bemused like Cary Grant, at least not in such a way that you break out in hysterical giggles. Director Howard Hawks relished undercutting Grant's dignity, and with great comedic results - for further demonstration, I submit BRINGING UP BABY and HIS GIRL FRIDAY (but stay away from MONKEY BUSINESS). This time around Grant is subjected to ever-deeper humiliations thanks to the obtuseness of military bureaucracy. There's something quite funny about Grant spending much of the film filling out forms and looking really irritated doing it. You'd think that the sequence in which he disconsolately wanders from billet to billet in search of a bed to sleep in would be the lowest experience for our guy. But that's only until the war bride ship won't allow him on board, this then inspiring an off-screen quick change into drag. Oh, Farce, thou art the hair off a horse's bum.And the love interest? I'm not that familiar with Ann Sheridan, but she nicely fits the mold of the sassy, fast-talking Hawksian heroine. Sheridan matches Grant banter for banter, which is what counts most in a screwball romp. I thought she was great.This review's drinking game: take a shot each time Grant declares: ""I am an alien spouse of female military personnel en route to the United States under Public Law 271 of the Congress.""

Hawks made this wonderfully silly flick when such masters of comedic direction such as Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges and George Cukor were at their peak; the great Ernst Lubitsch had passed on just the year before.Yet, Hawks had a sense of comic timing that probably died with him as a trade secret: You don't even need to see the titles to a Howard Hawks picture -- his fingerprints are all over the pacing, the quick banter and the editing. Even in such diverse movies as ""The Big Sleep"" (film noir melodrama) and ""El Dorado (Western), Hawks always directed with the light touch: Never imposing, but always keenly felt. ""I Was a Male War Bride"" is no exception.The screen chemistry between Cary Grant as the French Army officer Henri Rochard and Ann Sheridan as American Lt. Catherine Gates is electric, even better than Grant and Hepburn in ""Bringing Up Baby.""The ridiculous plot was conjured by two of screwball comedy's great screenwriters, Hagar Wilde (""Bringing Up Baby,"" 1938) and Charles Lederer (""His Girl Friday,"" 1940), both of which were directed by Hawks. Still, this movie is so deftly made that audiences can't get enough of the attraction masquerading as repulsion sexual tension between the love-struck leads.This movie is also a real hoot for anyone who's ever served in the Army in Germany: It was shot on location, and watching Cary wade through the military acronyms and red-tape in triplicate rings true.If you want to forget your troubles for a couple hours and take a fun romp through postwar Europe, this is your ticket. Ann Sheridan is hot, and there's a cute scene where Cary massages her shapely gams for that nice gratuitous touch Hawks always gives. Sure, casting Cary Grant as a Frenchman is even more of a stretch than watching Chuck Heston play a Mexican in Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil,"" but so what!

He is assigned American officer Ann Sheridan as an assistant, a woman with whom he has had a previous relationship which appears to have ended badly. There are obvious sparks between them, and as they endure a series of misadventures (usually at the expense of Grant), they become close again, marry, and then face another series of misadventures as they try to find a way to get Grant back to the U.S. as a &quot;war bride&quot;.  Grant is in good comedic form here, although a little sour as the Frenchman who finds the road to romance filled with more than a few potholes.  Sheridan, sometimes wasted in her earlier roles at Warner Bros, is warm and engaging and has very good chemistry with Grant.  There are a number of good lines and fun situations for the twosome, and the sight of Grant in drag, with the worst wig imaginable, is well worth a good laugh.  But I did find the pacing of the movie to be off a bit, which surprised me given that the film was directed by the great Howard Hawks.

Capt. Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) is a French officer who is assigned to put a stop to a black market operation in occupied Germany with the help of Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan), an American WAC. While their initial meetings are hardly harmonious, in time Rochard and Gates find that opposites really do attract, and they fall in love.The two decide to get married, which seems simple enough, but the moment Gates receives orders to return to the United States and Rochard wants to join her, they soon discover just how complicated the U.S. Army can make things. While the Army has a strict protocol for dealing with ""war brides,"" there is no similar routine for men who marry female Army personnel, so in order to follow his new wife into the States, Rochard has to disguise himself as a WAC. From this moment on, nearly everything that happens to Rochard is an affront to his dignity and/or his patience, from his inability to share a bunk with his new bride to his discovery that Army regulations prevent him from driving a motorcycle (Gates has to take the handlebars, while her husband is forced to ride in a sidecar).Wonderful Direction, Wonderful Cast and Super Screenplay!The chemistry between Grant and Sheridan is priceless, one laugh after another.BIOS:1.

This movie is definitely in the comedy class and Grant does well enough but the movie suffers from two insurmountable shortcomings; a bad script and a bad straight man (in this case, in keeping with the role reversal theme, a straight woman).  A lot of people don't appreciate the value of a good straight man but most comics in a situational humor setting can't really succeed without one.  Ann Sheridan may be the B Movie answer to Rita Hayworth but she seems to have no sense of how to deliver her lines in ""I was a Male War Bride"".  What makes things worse is the punch lines and supposedly comical situations aren't much to begin with.  For example, the movie adds a few unneccesary moments to try and work in a version of the old Wet Paint gag.  It came across as a speed bump in an already slow-moving film.I will acknowledge that things pick up towards the end of the movie when we get a good set of sequences on military red tape and its' inability to deal with anything unexpected.  However, by the time that began to emerge, I was already wondering why this movie was taking so long to end.

There are some priceless lines throughout, like the Permission To Immigrate To The US form that Cary must sign, which asks hilariously inane questions like ""name your father's gender"".  The military is so shortsighted and inflexible, poor Cary ultimately has no choice if he wants to get into the US - he not only has to lie about his identity, but his gender as well.  I first saw this movie some twenty-plus years ago and was amazed at how ahead of its time it was in terms of being a `gender-bender' comedy.  I was also amazed that it had never been as popular as some of the other comedies of the period (the French caught on early, and they still embrace this film as one of Hawks' best).  It has gradually been discovered and embraced by newer audiences, and it's about time.  It's not as wild or raucous as say, ""Some Like it Hot"", but it covers as much distance.  And I don't care what anybody says, Cary does have sexy gams!

McAdams,"[0, 0]","It is hard to go wrong with Cary Grant movies, and when he is starring in a screwball comedy, well, then it is almost impossible.This movie is an early entry in the gender-bender genre of comedy. While it doesn't have much in the way of cross-dressing, a'laSome Like It Hot, it does have a very interesting take on the gender roles issue.See, Cary's character is a French national, and he ends up marrying a female United States soldier, and she wants to bring him back with her to the states. Enter the comedy. The United States military and government DO have rules and laws in place to provide for married spouses of overseas soldiers to sponsor their spouses back to the United States -- however, those rules and laws were written from the point of view of a MALE soldier marrying a FEMALE foreign national, and all of the language in the rules and laws is from that point of view, but the law itself is gender neutral.So, we get to watch Cary and his bride fight door to door, and clerk to clerk, trying to get him home with her via U.S. military resources.

356356,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6303102441,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","I was a Male War Bride(released Aug/49),starring Cary Grant and Ann Sheridan,is set against the back drop of a post war Europe,specifically Germany,when it was divided into zones and run by the allies.The starkness and devastation of the countryside and people is quite evident all through the picture.With this as a bleak backdrop,the comedy doesn't flow as naturally as it otherwise would have.But there is no denying Grants ability in the comedy department as Hawks gives him every opportunity to shine,whether he is fighting with his extremities laying on a chair or in a tub or dressing in drag.One particular gag that stands out is a page taken right out of the Laurel and Hardy play book.Instead of Oliver Hardy this time it is Grant.It is later in the day and they both are exhausted from a long ride and lost.There is a signpost but Grant cannot read it and Sheridan tells him to go over and look.He does but still cannot make it out.Sheridan says:""Well,climb up and see"".Grant does but still can't tell what it says as it is in German.Sheridan finally turns around and catches what it says and starts to snicker.Grant slips back down the signpost and realizes,because of the nice white streak down his front,it must have said wet paint.This gag was originally done on film in the 20s then reprised in the 40s by The Boys.Grant would many times slip into a Stan Laurel or Oliver Hardy-ish mode in his films,and I have often wondered whether Grant and the Boys ever met and talked,because there is a definite influence there.The plot involves Sheridan who is a lieutenant in the American WACS and Grant is,of all things,a Captain in the French army.If you can wrap your head around Grant,with his accent,being French,you know you will like the film.And in typical Grant style,he pulls it off,but for the life of me don't ask me how.It's a Grant ""thing"",I guess.The two characters have obviously worked together before and Grant is sent on a mission to a town in Germany.Who is ordered to accompany him but Sheridan.In fact Sheridan is Grant's driver,on a motorcycle yet;regulations you understand! Eventually,through alot of frustrations and faux pauxs,like that painted sign post,the two somehow fall in love and marry.But as things are atypical in this plot,Grant becomes a war bride to Sheridan,who is being sent home to the States for discharge.And of course the American chain of command just can't wrap their collective heads around Grant being,well,a guy.There are alot of trips and turns as a result,but in the end it is all good.Watch for ""Red"",a seaman aboard the ship,played by Ken Tobey.When Hawks went on to make his Sci-Fi classic in a few short years,The Thing from Another World,he remembered Tobey and put him in the lead.Extras include some special footage of Army personnel visiting the set during its making,with no sound and the trailer.The picture is clean and clear.All in all a good film.When the comedy comes it is good but it is off and on throughout,as the stark background of a war torn Germany really acts as a damper on things.But Sheridan and Grant are a good team on screen and they seemed to be having fun.3 1/2 -4 stars.",4,On again off again comedy by Hawks,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,3162,"['was', 'Male', 'War', 'Bride', 'released', 'Aug/49', 'starring', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'set', 'back', 'drop', 'post', 'war', 'Europe', 'specifically', 'Germany', 'when', 'was', 'divided', 'zones', 'run', 'allies.The', 'starkness', 'devastation', 'countryside', 'people', 'quite', 'evident', 'picture.With', 'bleak', 'backdrop', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'flow', 'as', 'naturally', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have.But', 'denying', 'Grants', 'ability', 'comedy', 'department', 'Hawks', 'opportunity', 'shine', 'fighting', 'extremities', 'laying', 'chair', 'tub', 'dressing', 'drag.One', 'particular', 'gag', 'out', 'page', 'taken', 'right', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'play', 'book.Instead', 'Oliver', 'Hardy', 'time', 'Grant.It', 'later', 'day', 'are', 'exhausted', 'long', 'ride', 'lost.There', 'signpost', 'Grant', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'Sheridan', 'go', 'look.He', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'out.Sheridan', 'Well', 'up', 'see', '.Grant', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'German.Sheridan', 'finally', 'around', 'what', 'snicker.Grant', 'slips', 'back', 'signpost', 'realizes', 'nice', 'white', 'streak', 'down', 'front', 'must', 'have', 'said', 'wet', 'paint.This', 'gag', 'was', 'originally', 'done', 'film', '20s', 'then', 'reprised', '40s', 'Boys.Grant', 'would', 'many', 'times', 'slip', 'Stan', 'Laurel', 'Oliver', 'Hardy-ish', 'mode', 'films', 'have', 'often', 'wondered', 'Grant', 'Boys', 'ever', 'met', 'talked', 'definite', 'influence', 'there.The', 'plot', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'lieutenant', 'American', 'WACS', 'Grant', 'things', 'Captain', 'French', 'army.If', 'can', 'wrap', 'head', 'Grant', 'accent', 'being', 'French', 'know', 'will', 'like', 'film.And', 'typical', 'Grant', 'style', 'off', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Grant', 'thing', 'guess.The', 'two', 'characters', 'have', 'obviously', 'worked', 'together', 'before', 'Grant', 'sent', 'mission', 'town', 'Germany.Who', 'ordered', 'accompany', 'Sheridan.In', 'fact', 'Sheridan', 'Grant', 'driver', 'motorcycle', 'yet', 'regulations', 'understand', 'Eventually', 'alot', 'frustrations', 'faux', 'pauxs', 'painted', 'sign', 'post', 'two', 'somehow', 'fall', 'love', 'marry.But', 'things', 'are', 'atypical', 'plot', 'Grant', 'war', 'bride', 'Sheridan', 'who', 'being', 'sent', 'home', 'States', 'discharge.And', 'course', 'American', 'chain', 'command', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wrap', 'collective', 'heads', 'Grant', 'being', 'well', 'guy.There', 'are', 'alot', 'trips', 'result', 'end', 'good.Watch', 'Red', 'seaman', 'ship', 'played', 'Ken', 'Tobey.When', 'Hawks', 'went', 'make', 'Sci-Fi', 'classic', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'Thing', 'World', 'remembered', 'Tobey', 'put', 'lead.Extras', 'include', 'special', 'footage', 'Army', 'personnel', 'visiting', 'set', 'making', 'sound', 'trailer.The', 'picture', 'clean', 'clear.All', 'good', 'film.When', 'comedy', 'good', 'off', 'stark', 'background', 'war', 'torn', 'Germany', 'really', 'damper', 'things.But', 'Sheridan', 'Grant', 'are', 'good', 'team', 'screen', 'seemed', 'be', 'having', 'fun.3', '1/2', '-4', 'stars']",I Was a Male War Bride VHS

356359,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6303102441,Simon Davis,"[9, 9]","For those that appreciate well written marital comedies a good old fashioned laugh feast is guaranteed in Howard Hawk's delightful farce set in post war Europe, ""I Was a Male War Bride"". The film's main claim to fame of course is the sight of Cary Grant attired in full female army uniform trying to make his way to America with his new wife, however it also has much else to offer in the determined battle of the sexes that goes on between the two antagonists Cary Grant and the always delightful Ann Sheridan. Grant was always superb when playing these types of disgruntled male lead roles where he often found himself being put through the emotional ringer by a woman who generally has the upper hand on him. In this funny story the woman in question played by Ann Sheridan enjoys a long standing love/hate relationship with his character that while filled with verbal insults and slights, hides underneath a real love just waiting to come to the surface. This film also very amusingly chronicles  the discomforts and frustration that went into a lot of wartime marriages where army red tape and procedures often seemed intent upon nothing else but hindering the course of true love. This story treats all of those frustrations in a light hearted and at times highly amusing manner which is sure to amuse and indeed surprise some die hard Cary Grant fans.Based upon a story by the real Henri Rochard, Cary Grant plays the french Officer who is part of the occuping forces in postwar Germany who are responsible for getting the country back to it's proper operation. He has a real love /hate working relationship with American WAC Lt. Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan in one of her best roles)who he has had a number of assignments with in the past. Catherine's breezy manner and her ability to always manage to get Henri's goat so to speak, in any dealings they have with each other guarantees that the two always have an explosive relationship with each. From their previous collaborations together Henri always finds himself coming out of these encounters the worst for wear as in the example of his recent brush with the wise cracking Lt. where his private parts took on a strange colour thanks to a vat of blue dye he was dumped into all in the name of duty! However on their latest mission in post war Germany where they are reluctantly teamed together to track down a black market ring Henri and Catherine find that their previous antagonism towards each other begins to turn into the not unexpected love that both have been denying for so long. The journey to where the assignment is involves them in a wacky cross country motorcycle ride that sees them almost go over a waterfall, almost get drowned in a sudden down pour and which has henri spending th enight locke din Catherine's hotel room when the door handle breaks off. Along the way of course the verbal insults continue in particular when Henri himself is mistaken for one of the black mailers and Catherine has to get him out of jail. matters are not help also when Henri's ego is further deflated when Catherine with use of an army contact is able to track down the gentlemen they were seeking with little effort. A collision with a haystack however is the catalyst that finally brings the pairs deep feelings for each other to the surface and in among the straw Henri proposes marriage.  However if the pair thought that their courtship was rocky they are not prepared for all the problems they have in their quest to get married. After having to go through three officical ceremonies to make their union legal they find that when Catherine is suddenly informed that her detachment is being sent home to the United states that there is no place for Henri as her ""husband"", on the army ship home. To achieve their desire to get to the United States they find it is necessary to have Henri classified as a ""war bride"", to ensure he is granted passage home. The final journey to the boat to sail to the US however id filled with frustrations for Henri as he is seperated from Catherine on their Wedding Night and goes through a succession of temporary accomodations that have not place for a ""Male War Bride"", which is the strange classification that he finds himself having to travel under. After a number of sleepless nights when they finally do get to the boat Catherine and Henri find the US Navy now barring their one chance to sail together as husband and wife because of Henri's confusing ""status"". It is only by Catherine's quick thinking in dressing the long sufering Henri up as a women and getting him aboard that way that the couple finally are able to set sail for America and actually spend the night and as it turns out the whole journey alone together in a small room where even the navy's red tape can't get at them.""I Was a Male War Bride"", is a delightful comedy outing that the viewer could almost see the likes of William Powell and Myrna Loy doing during th e1930's. Never for one moment does Cary Grant look convincing as a WAC but that is half the fun of the proceedings and he handles this part and all the crazy situations he is thrown into with relish. He and Ann Sheridan have a delightful chemistry on screen together and make a very believable and highly amusing bickering couple who just can't help but fall in love. Ann Sheridan once again here proves herself to be a most capable comedianne and I've always felt that her wartime nickname of the ""Omph Girl"", tended to sell her abilities in other areas far too short. One of the best running jokes throughout the whole film is the precarious situations that Cary Grant often finds himself having to try and sleep under and the films original title of ""You Can't Sleep Here!"", really sums up his frustrations. from a bath tub to a hard chair to a bunk in a mess hall, all manner of sleeping arrangements are waht he is reduced to taking with the reaccuring joke of what to do with his hands in these situations also raising many laughs. The pace at times changes from rapid fire verbal exchanges between the warring couple, typical of the directing style of the legendary Howard Hawks, to quite leisurely interludes through the proceedings which allow the characters to develop more fully. One of the great benefits of ""I Was a Male War Bride"", is the fact that it was filmed on location in Europe in late 1948 so that many scenes show war wreckage and burnt out buildings still in place which gives the story a very believable atmosphere and not the appearance of just another Hollywood Backlot adventure.In 1949 long before the era of such films as ""Some Like It Hot"", the sight of one of Hollywood's greatest romantic leading men dressed as a WAC was undoubtedly quite a startling thing. Cary Grant's stint in female attire is the visual image for which this film will always be remembered however it is an enjoyable farce all the way through with two shining performances, combined with rapid fire direction and great dialogue guarenteed to make you laugh. Spend some time soon with this wonderful comedy courtesy of Howard Hawks, it shows another image of Cary Grant perhaps not so well know to audiences and the lovely Ann Sheridan at her acting peak.

It's silly entertainment, not to be taken seriously. If you want to be entertained then get this movie for your collection. If you want something serious then get The Killing Fields. Fans of Cary Grant will not be disappointed.",4,I Wasn't a Male War Bride,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,576,"['fan', 'classics', 'one', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'married', 'admirer', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'movies', 'must', 'say', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'movies', 'today', 'give', 'perverted', 'slant', 'men', 'dressing', 'up', 'women', 'one', 'purely', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'what', 'quintessential', 'leading', 'man', 'acts', 'when', 'dressed', 'woman', 'silly', 'entertainment', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'then', 'get', 'movie', 'collection', 'want', 'something', 'serious', 'then', 'get', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'Fans', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",I Was a Male War Bride VHS

And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that ""mean streak"" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, ""Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..."" but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on.",1,"Promises much, delivers practically nothing",1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,1717,"['begin', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'EXCEPT', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'where', 'was', 'excellent', 'enjoy', 'much', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Eagle', 'Hawk', 'Fredric', 'March', 'was', 'tolerable', 'Philadelphia', 'Story', 'Talk', 'Town', 'A', 'friend', 'mine', 'loaned', 'DVD', 'just', 'bought', 'had', 'wanted', 'see', 'what', 'Cary', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'wanted', 'see', 'dress', 'start', 'movie', 'was', 'SLOW', 'BORING', 'jokes', 'were', 'so', 'lame', 'not', 'funny', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'films', 'where', 'man', 'woman', 'yell', 'other', 'dislike', 'other', 'then', 'point', 'realize', 'really', 'feel', 'other', 'Come', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'sort', 'romance', 'situation', 'felt', 'Cary', 'showed', 'mean', 'streak', 'can', 'show', 'films', 'romance', 'situation', 'story', 'rate', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'get', 'bored', 'right', 'beginning', 'sort', 'torture', 'waiting', 'finally', 'end', 'while', 'kept', 'saying', 'Let', 'move', 'along', 'let', 'end', 'thing', 'when', 'put', 'dress', 'dragged', 'out', 'boring', 'corny', 'jokes', 'part', 'wanted', 'see', 'Cary', 'dress', 'was', 'VERY', 'end', 'not', 'very', 'much', 'Overall', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'disappointment', 'letdown', 'only', 'consolation', 'was', 'saw', 'free', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'buy', 'rent', 'Still', 'wasted', 'good', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'profitable', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'would', 'even', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'washing', 'kitchen', 'full', 'dirty', 'dishes', 'more', 'watching', 'movie', 'sum', 'up', 'VERY', 'VERY', 'BORING', 'DUMB', 'movie', 'not', 'waste', 'time']",I Was a Male War Bride VHS

Priebe ""WFP""","[2, 3]","French officer Henri Rochard (Cary Grant) marries an American officer  Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) - he actually has to marry her three times -  only to find that he has nowhere to spend his wedding night. To make  matters worse, the only way he can travel with her to the US is as a war  bride. The movie alternates between the subplot of Grant trying to find a  place to sleep and trying to get on his wife's ship to the US as her Male  War Bride.The movie is not as funny as some of the other Grant films  (i.e. ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""Arsenic and Old Lace""), but that is  partially due to the fact that he makes such outstanding movies that just  Good appears inferior. Grant carries this film from beginning to end, but  it would have been better if he had more support. However, there is no  question that it is still worth watching. Plan to laugh out loud some and  smile a lot.The transfer to video is not as good as it could be. The  scenes appear faded and sometimes the words are indistinct.
