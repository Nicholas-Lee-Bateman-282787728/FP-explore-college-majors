The female in the crimestory seems finally to have come of age. Good acting by al the leads, especially  Kinski, Redgrave and Tilly and an original story premise more then make up  for some weak area's ( A series of rather unlikely coincidences making a  twist in the family relations possible, and a villain who switches a little  too easily from a halfwit-psycho to a charming young man and the other way  round.)

When I first saw it on tv 3 years ago, I thought that it was a really good movie-but then I only saw part 2 of the series and missed the first half. I bought this on dvd and thought I was lucky because it's very rare to be on a dvd, but when watching the movie you then realize it's just simply OKAY. First let me tell you. The version on the dvd is kind of different from the one that came on tv because they changed some of the scenes like when the mafia wives meet the villain, Luka, for time and when they were suppose to go to some casino place where the idiot killed this guy. All of that was on the tv and not the dvd, itself. What was corny was you get to the murder scene when Luka kills the Luciano men-that was really weak and stupid. He kills the children first and no one hears?!!!!!!!!!!!! Then he goes downstairs when they're having dinner then the next scene they are all just laying there on the floor?!!!!!!!!Why didn't anyone hear the gun shots?! What is likeable in the movie is the bonding and loyalty between the mob widows-now, that I really liked. (I must say that guy that played Luka, James Marsden, is one fine white dude! Very fine for a white guy-oh, my goodness! I don't like white guys cause those aren't my kind, but I just had to say how fine he is, though that's irrelevant.)
