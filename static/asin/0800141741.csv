165282,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,0800141741,,"[3, 3]","In the last year I have grown less and less fond of Tom Cruise and all the shinanigans sorrounding his (not-so) personal life. So as much as I try not to let my like or dislike for an actor influence my prejudice on a film, before watching this for the first time, I certainly had my doubts. However my somewhat low expectations of this movie, or rather Tom Cruise in this movie, were wiped away almost immediately. The wit, the humour, and the underlining core of this film are so universal and strong, and even I have to admit that I was blown away.Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a hot-shot employee for one of the biggest sports agencies in the world. But despite his professional success, emotionally he is an empty and confused man questioning his place and worth in ""a cynical world."" When he publicly expresses his war with life in a memo, he is rudely fired by the company. The difficult position he is left in leads Jerry to become an independant agent to his sole loyal client, footballer Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). His personal life blossoms as well, with the inclusion of Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), a single mother, who helps him overcome his intamacy issues and becomes his platform of inspiration.The film's screenplay is outstanding. Filled with bright, quirky lines, including the memorable ""show me the money,"" and ""you had me at hello."" A film is made or broken on the quality of the dialogue, and ""Jerry Maguire,"" is filled with a zest and passion that is not found in many films. The script carried out by the characters really draws you in and makes you laugh out loud at one time and makes feel like crying at another time.And ofcourse, a script can never work without the talent of the actors who bring it to life. As I mentioned earlier, I am certainly not Tom Cruise's biggest fan, but even I have to admit that he was perfect for this movie. Despite what you might think of him, he is a talented actor who carried the role of Jerry beautifully, and I DO believe he deserved his Oscar nomination. Renee Zellweger, a relative unknown at the time of this film's release, is charming as Dorothy. She's got a particular innocence and purity about her that was a great relief, seeing as the film is based around the idea that money is the only thing that brings happiness. And speaking of money, the performance given by Cuba Gooding Jr. as the ""show-me-the-money"" football player is simply flawless. He is absolutely HALARIOUS, and the secret ingredient that makes this film work so well. Every scene with him in it is so much fun to watch, and I am so glad he was awarded with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.""Jerry Maguire"" is ironic, in that is promotes the idea of ""love conquers all,"" with the backdrop of the multi-billion world of American football. It's a beautiful contrast, that at the end of the movie really accentuates that without love at the core of something, there is nothing. I really loved this film, and I came away feeling truly happy. It's a feel-good romantic comedy, with a hint of drama that's full of wit and charm. DON'T let your frazzled opinion of Tom Cruise deflect you from this film; ""Jerry Maguire,"" will strike a chord in every way.",5,An outstanding film with genuinity rarely found in films today.,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",2006,3187,"['last', 'year', 'have', 'grown', 'less', 'less', 'fond', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'shinanigans', 'sorrounding', 'not-so', 'personal', 'life', 'So', 'as', 'much', 'try', 'not', 'let', 'dislike', 'actor', 'influence', 'prejudice', 'film', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'certainly', 'had', 'doubts', 'However', 'somewhat', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'rather', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'were', 'wiped', 'away', 'almost', 'immediately', 'wit', 'humour', 'underlining', 'core', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'universal', 'strong', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'blown', 'away.Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Cruise', 'hot-shot', 'employee', 'one', 'biggest', 'sports', 'agencies', 'world', 'professional', 'success', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'confused', 'man', 'questioning', 'place', 'worth', 'cynical', 'world', 'When', 'publicly', 'war', 'life', 'memo', 'rudely', 'fired', 'company', 'difficult', 'position', 'left', 'leads', 'Jerry', 'become', 'independant', 'agent', 'sole', 'loyal', 'client', 'footballer', 'Rod', 'Tidwell', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'personal', 'life', 'blossoms', 'well', 'inclusion', 'Dorothy', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'overcome', 'intamacy', 'issues', 'platform', 'inspiration.The', 'film', 'screenplay', 'outstanding', 'Filled', 'bright', 'quirky', 'lines', 'including', 'memorable', 'show', 'money', 'had', 'hello', 'film', 'made', 'broken', 'quality', 'dialogue', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'filled', 'zest', 'passion', 'not', 'found', 'many', 'films', 'script', 'carried', 'out', 'characters', 'really', 'draws', 'loud', 'one', 'time', 'feel', 'crying', 'time.And', 'ofcourse', 'script', 'can', 'never', 'work', 'talent', 'actors', 'who', 'bring', 'life', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'am', 'certainly', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'biggest', 'fan', 'even', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'perfect', 'movie', 'what', 'might', 'think', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'carried', 'role', 'Jerry', 'beautifully', 'DO', 'believe', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'relative', 'unknown', 'time', 'film', 'release', 'charming', 'Dorothy', 'got', 'particular', 'innocence', 'purity', 'was', 'great', 'relief', 'seeing', 'film', 'based', 'idea', 'money', 'only', 'thing', 'happiness', 'speaking', 'money', 'performance', 'given', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'show-me-the-money', 'football', 'player', 'simply', 'flawless', 'absolutely', 'HALARIOUS', 'secret', 'ingredient', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'scene', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'awarded', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'ironic', 'idea', 'love', 'conquers', 'backdrop', 'multi-billion', 'world', 'American', 'football', 'beautiful', 'contrast', 'end', 'movie', 'really', 'love', 'core', 'something', 'nothing', 'really', 'loved', 'film', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'truly', 'happy', 'feel-good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'hint', 'drama', 'full', 'wit', 'charm', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'let', 'frazzled', 'opinion', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'deflect', 'film', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'will', 'strike', 'chord', 'way']",Jerry Maguire

Zellweger's funny and touching performance as lonely single mom, Dorothy is the main reason to watch this film, I remember watching her performance and thinking - she is going to be a huge star back in 1996, she is such a natural.

The movie takes a look to the world of the sports agents, a world where the money means everything.But ""Jerry Maguire"" wouldn't have been so appealing without good performances, and this movie has a solid cast. Of course Cruise plays the main character in the film, but Renee delivered a charming, lovable performance as Jerry's love interest. Her character, Dorothy, gives patient and strength to Jerry.Jonathan Lipnicki played the role of Ray Boyd (Dorothy's child), and he did a good job, usually child actors are annoying and bad actors, but Jonathan did a great job.

I wanted to be a sports agent at some point in my life and its still an option if I want to pursue it. I love sports and I love negations and it would be cool to be around the players. This movie did give you a wake up to what the world can really be like. If you are going to be a sports agent I am not saying you have to take what you get from this movie but it does give insight to how busy and stressful the life can be. Not only is it a fulltime job and lots of traveling you are always trying to please your client even if they won't listen to your point of view on how things should be run. This is also a classic love story and it kind of sweet the way it was put together. The mom in this movie is played by the same women who was the main character in Bridget Jones Diary. The kids name I can't recall but him and Jerry hit it off from the moment they meet and they have great chemistry in this movie. One thing I was also not expecting from this movie was for it to be two plus hours long. The story was very well done and while it did take time to develop it made sure to wrap everything up at the end of the movie. The movie has a good ending and it's a feel good story. Overall I am going to give this movie a 4.5/5 with a strong recommendation to check out. Tom Cruise does a great job in this movie and everyone should give it a try especially if you are trying to be a sports agent or are interested in the sports world.,5,Jerry Maguire gives you a real look into what being a sports agent can be very well done love story as well. 4.5/5 Stars.,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",2010,1530,"['taken', 'longest', 'time', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'wow', 'was', 'worth', 'wanted', 'be', 'sports', 'agent', 'point', 'life', 'still', 'option', 'want', 'pursue', 'love', 'sports', 'love', 'negations', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'be', 'players', 'movie', 'did', 'give', 'wake', 'up', 'what', 'world', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sports', 'agent', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'have', 'take', 'what', 'get', 'movie', 'give', 'insight', 'how', 'busy', 'stressful', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'Not', 'only', 'fulltime', 'job', 'lots', 'traveling', 'are', 'always', 'trying', 'please', 'client', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'listen', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'run', 'also', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'kind', 'sweet', 'way', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'mom', 'movie', 'played', 'same', 'women', 'who', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'kids', 'name', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Jerry', 'hit', 'off', 'moment', 'meet', 'have', 'great', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'expecting', 'movie', 'was', 'be', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'did', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'made', 'sure', 'wrap', 'everything', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'movie', 'good', 'ending', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'Overall', 'am', 'going', 'give', 'movie', '4.5/5', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'check', 'out', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'especially', 'are', 'trying', 'be', 'sports', 'agent', 'are', 'interested', 'sports', 'world']",Jerry Maguire

165288,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800141741,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","When I saw &#8216;Jerry Maguire&#8217; all those years ago, I really wasn&#8217;t expecting a whole lot.  It just didn&#8217;t seem like the type of movie that was going to resonate with me at all, and the backlash regarding its solitary Oscar win was already loud and clear.  I kind of thought I was going to hate this.  What I found though, was a delightfully fleshed out romantic comedy that kind of lived up to the initial hype and praise and made for a refreshing take on a genre that is so awfully oversaturated with clich&eacute;s.In &#8216;Jerry Maguire&#8217; we meet a morally conflicted sports agent who winds up fired and facing a new chapter in his life with a single mother secretary and a passionate football player his only supporters.  With his new moral outlook, Maguire sets off to do things on his own and finds out that things are far harder and more desperate and yet, in the end, much more rewarding when you know that what you are doing is the right thing.  This simple story is handled with such lightness and love by Cameron Crowe, who really made a name for himself with this film.  The entire cast is up to par here, with Cruise delivering his finest performance to date, and Zellweger bursting onto the scene with such promise.  But yes, it is Cuba Gooding Jr. who steals this movie.  For good or bad is up to you as the viewer.  While I don&#8217;t think he deserved that Oscar (especially in a field containing Edward Norton&#8217;s stunning performance and William H. Macy&#8217;s brilliance), but he was extremely entertaining here and really delivered a complete knockout of a comedic performance.  For what he was asked to do, he nailed it.This is just a great little movie that can be unfairly maligned these days.  It still lives up to the bar it set for itself and continues to be one of the best romantic dramedies out there.",5,A little heart goes a long way&#8230;,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",2014,1864,"['When', 'saw', '8216', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', '8217', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'wasn', '8217', 'expecting', 'whole', 'lot', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'seem', 'type', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'resonate', 'backlash', 'regarding', 'solitary', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'already', 'loud', 'clear', 'kind', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'delightfully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'kind', 'lived', 'up', 'initial', 'hype', 'praise', 'made', 'refreshing', 'take', 'genre', 'so', 'awfully', 'oversaturated', 'clich', 'eacute', '8216', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', '8217', 'meet', 'morally', 'conflicted', 'sports', 'agent', 'who', 'up', 'fired', 'facing', 'new', 'chapter', 'life', 'single', 'mother', 'secretary', 'passionate', 'football', 'player', 'only', 'supporters', 'new', 'moral', 'outlook', 'Maguire', 'do', 'things', 'own', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'far', 'harder', 'more', 'desperate', 'yet', 'end', 'much', 'more', 'rewarding', 'when', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'simple', 'story', 'handled', 'such', 'lightness', 'love', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'name', 'film', 'entire', 'cast', 'up', 'par', 'here', 'Cruise', 'delivering', 'finest', 'performance', 'date', 'Zellweger', 'bursting', 'scene', 'such', 'promise', 'yes', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'up', 'viewer', 'don', '8217', 'think', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'especially', 'field', 'containing', 'Edward', 'Norton', '8217', 'stunning', 'performance', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', '8217', 'brilliance', 'was', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'here', 'really', 'delivered', 'complete', 'knockout', 'comedic', 'performance', 'what', 'was', 'asked', 'do', 'nailed', 'it.This', 'just', 'great', 'little', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'days', 'still', 'up', 'bar', 'set', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'dramedies', 'there']",Jerry Maguire

This near-perfect blend of comedy and drama is enhanced by an extensive and varied music track, fine acting and unusual sports figure cameos.Here, super-agent Jerry is fired from the company he helped found for publishing a mission statement that stresses providing more personal attention to a smaller roster of star athletes. Dorothy Boyd is struck by the beauty of Jerry's message. She quits her accconting job at the same firm and together Jerry and she set out to conquer the sports agency world, starting with a single client, little-used wide receiver Rod Tidwell. The undersized Rod has a head almost too big for his helmet. He wants the Arizona Cardinals to pay him several million more than the team's owner thinks he's worth.Jerry likes the widowed Dorothy a great deal and he totally loves her precocious six-year-old son, Ray. When Dorothy plans a move to San Diego, the matrimony-phobic Jerry asks her to marry him. It soon becomes obvious that as a husband he's a great sports agent.

These are  the things that concern me every day.Tom Cruise was beautiful. He  showed perfect acting the whole time. It is perhaps, the finest work so far  in his career. You could see every flicker of doubt and insincerity cross  his face. I was laughing out loud, then crying and then so tightly happy  that I forgot to breath.

And let's not forget Dorothy's son Ray, what a little charmer.The basic story is a simple one and yet it is fresh all the same.  One of the slogans that the promoters used was, &quot;A legend that became  a man&quot;. For me, that is not a bad summary of the plot. Jerry is a  highly successful sports agent who has an attack of conscience which gets  him fired. He manages this rather early on in the film by writing a new  mission statement entitled, &quot;The things we think and do not say&quot;,  which harks back in time to simpler days where a man's word was his bond.  As one of his work mates says, &quot;I give him a week&quot;. Sure enough,  Jerry was doing a Lone Ranger in seven days. And as happens to so many of  us, this disaster turns out to be the best thing that could have happened  to him.In the hectic moments as he tries tries to keep all his  clients he is tied up by one rather loud and demanding footballer. In the  end it is this one man who fills Jerry's client roster. Not to be daunted,  Jerry strides out into the land of cubicles and coffee machines and firmly  asks who would like to join him in exile.Of course he is less  than overwhelmed by the response. Just as it looks like his only colleague  will be a gold fish, a young accounting clerk named Dorothy, who was  inspired by Jerry's mission statement, pipes up and falteringly joins the  crusade. Unfortunately she has a very young son named Ray and no other  means of support. This puts Jerry under a little more pressure than he  needed which is well illustrated when, before they even get out of the  building's elevator, Dorothy starts enquiring about her health plan.But in the end Jerry finds a strength he didn't know he had, an  empathy he has never needed before, an integrity that used to be a handicap  and finally he finds the love of his life. If you dream about finding any  of these things in your own life I suggest you could do a lot worse than  following Jerry's example.",5,One man's ethical rollercoaster,957657600,"05 7, 2000",2000,2727,"['film', 'spoke', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'was', 'almost', 'quot', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'quot', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'mind', 'Jerry', 'epiphany', 'start', 'story', 'struggle', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'seemed', 'be', 'drawn', 'experiences', 'are', 'things', 'concern', 'day.Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'beautiful', 'showed', 'perfect', 'acting', 'whole', 'time', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'work', 'so', 'far', 'career', 'could', 'see', 'flicker', 'doubt', 'insincerity', 'cross', 'face', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'then', 'crying', 'then', 'so', 'tightly', 'happy', 'forgot', 'breath', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'seemed', 'perfect', 'well', 'particularly', 'liked', 'doubting', 'divorced', 'totally', 'caring', 'sister', 'Laurel', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Dorothy', 'son', 'Ray', 'what', 'little', 'charmer.The', 'basic', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'yet', 'fresh', 'same', 'One', 'slogans', 'promoters', 'used', 'was', 'quot', 'A', 'legend', 'became', 'man', 'quot', 'not', 'bad', 'summary', 'plot', 'Jerry', 'highly', 'successful', 'sports', 'agent', 'who', 'attack', 'conscience', 'fired', 'rather', 'early', 'film', 'writing', 'new', 'mission', 'statement', 'entitled', 'quot', 'things', 'think', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'quot', 'back', 'time', 'simpler', 'days', 'where', 'man', 'word', 'was', 'bond', 'one', 'work', 'mates', 'quot', 'give', 'week', 'quot', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Jerry', 'was', 'doing', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'seven', 'days', 'happens', 'so', 'many', 'disaster', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'him.In', 'hectic', 'moments', 'tries', 'keep', 'clients', 'tied', 'up', 'one', 'rather', 'loud', 'demanding', 'footballer', 'end', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'Jerry', 'client', 'roster', 'Not', 'be', 'daunted', 'Jerry', 'out', 'land', 'cubicles', 'coffee', 'machines', 'firmly', 'asks', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'join', 'exile.Of', 'course', 'less', 'overwhelmed', 'response', 'Just', 'only', 'colleague', 'will', 'be', 'gold', 'fish', 'young', 'accounting', 'clerk', 'named', 'Dorothy', 'who', 'was', 'inspired', 'Jerry', 'mission', 'statement', 'up', 'falteringly', 'crusade', 'Unfortunately', 'very', 'young', 'son', 'named', 'Ray', 'other', 'means', 'support', 'Jerry', 'little', 'more', 'pressure', 'needed', 'well', 'illustrated', 'when', 'even', 'get', 'building', 'elevator', 'Dorothy', 'enquiring', 'health', 'plan.But', 'end', 'Jerry', 'strength', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'empathy', 'never', 'needed', 'before', 'integrity', 'used', 'be', 'handicap', 'finally', 'love', 'life', 'dream', 'finding', 'things', 'own', 'life', 'suggest', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'following', 'Jerry', 'example']",Jerry Maguire

She watches his bachelor party video.  She reads his memo/mission statement.  She inexplicably is on his same flight and able to listen to every word he says (completely unrealistic in my experience)  She loses her child.  He finds her child and tells her some random facts about her cubicle. (How romantic.) She walks out on her job for him.  He drunkenly gropes her and swears in front of her kid.  He rips her beautiful dress as an excuse to have sex with her.  She loves him.  He proposes.  Did I miss something?  What does she see in him?

Tom Cruise provides one of the best performances of his career, and Renee Zellweger became a household name after her supporting role as Dorothy Boyd. Overall, Jerry Maguire is a fun, romantic comedy about an idealistic career man who finds a way to live his life differently...Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent extraordinaire with one of the largest sports agent conglomerates in the world. But when one of his clients becomes injured, Jerry is forced to rethink the purpose of his career and his life. The result is a new and idealistic corporate mission statement flatly rejected by his colleagues. With the people around him unwilling to change, Jerry Maguire quits and strikes out on his own. He attempts to energize more people to follow him to the new company he's going to create, but only one employee bites - office secretary Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) who is secretly in love with Jerry. (This is a very humorous scene where Jerry Maguire goes off the deep end).When he quits, Jerry hopes to retain a number of his high profile clients, but they all bail on him - all except one, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). Tidwell is an egomaniacal, sub-par receiver in the final year of his current contract. Desperate, Maguire pleads over the phone with Tidwell, hoping the man with retain his services. This scene spawns the famous line ""Show me the money!"" which Tidwell forces Maguire to say over and over...As Maguire and Dorothy Boyd struggle to hold the new business together, their relationship grows into a romantic one, which in the end results in another famous line from the film. Will their relationship hold up under the pressures of the new enterprise? Will Tidwell's career pay off for his family and the new Jerry Maguire agency? It's a lot of fun finding out...One of the surprise films of 1996, Jerry Maguire is that rare film that appeals to both women for its romance, men for its sports themed plot, and the Academy Awards for its memorable performances and ingenious portrayal of strong interpersonal conflicts. A great number of mid-1990's sports figures make cameos throughout the film, lending credibility to the setting and believability to Tidwell's character. There's a reason this film won so many awards and raked in widespread critical acclaim. It simply appeals to large audience on many different levels. That's why Jerry Maguire is a definite must-see film.

Through it all Maguire quickly develops a great relationship with her little boy, one of the great child characters of all time. It takes time, but Maguire's only client becomes a star and Maguire finally learns to suppress his competitive drive in the sports business in order to become the kind of man that his wife wants and that will make him happy.I detested the scene where Maguire departs from the company so bad that it colored the rest of the movie for me.

Don't.Jerry Maguire begins where most movies end.  Often Hollywood shows our hero making his way through the world, compromising what his heart tells him to do for worldly success, until these two forces dramatically conflict and our hero says to himself &quot;Oh yeah, follow my heart&quot; and then lives happily ever after.  Jerry Maguire is &quot;Part 2&quot; for all these movies - it shows us just how difficult it actually is to follow our heart, especially in a world where no one else seems to.  The title character (played by Tom Cruise) is a highly successive sports agent - a field portrayed as more inhuman and slimy than selling cars or practicing law.  After Jerry announces his change of heart, his career slides slowly downward as his coworkers oust him, his clients desert him, and his fiancee leaves him.  Jerry is left with one fading, unpopular client, (Cuba Gooding Jr in an Oscar-winning, mesmerizing performance) and a rebound relationship his sole employee.  Jerry is fighting for his life.This aspect of the movie is intense and engrossing.  These characters are the most fleshed out I've ever seen, with excellent acting and outstanding dialog.  However, this film also contains a romantic &quot;sub&quot; plot, which is powerful but ultimately unforfilling, perhaps by choice.  Renee Zellweger plays Maguire's instant wife, and is SO supporting, SO charming, SO beautiful, that I wished for a stronger resolution to their relationship than the movie gave me.  As the plot brings the wonderful main theme to a powerful close, it also tries to also wrap up the romance in an equally intelligent way, and I think the actors and even the writer/director (Cameron Crowe) tripped themselves up ever so slightly.

However, just because you're the biggest at the time, does that mean you were the best or just simply the most visible? Compare ""Jerry Maguire"", Cameron Crowe's first huge film to make massive business after the so-so successes of ""Singles"" and ""Say Anything"", to ""Almost Famous"", long considered Crowe's best work yet barely got any box office attention. But here we have the one that put him on the map and while some parts don't fit well, the overall film is quite solid after all these years.Jerry Maguire is a sports agent that works behind the scenes that makes sure his clients get the best contracts in sports as well as top product endorsements. But over time, he realizes it's becoming more about the money and lying to clients and writes a ""mission statement"" which details his ideas to better the relationships between clients. While emotionally it makes sense, to everyone else it's absolutely ridiculous and he's promptly fired. But with help of Dorothy Boyd, a fellow co-worker moved by his writing and Rod Tidwell, a football player who believes he's not getting the life or respect he deserves, Jerry changes into what he wrote about but never acted on ever.One of the most successful films and certainly one of the most quotable, it's easy to see Jerry Maguire being a success. Equal parts drama with many comedic moments, actor and character showcases as well as stuff romantics will gush over, it does have everything (well, there's no action scene to speak of but that's nothing). But it's kind of unfair since many would find overrated and a bit overexposed thanks to several lines of dialogue, its box office success or the fact its a Tom Cruise movie. It's not really the most flawless film since for every scene that feels just right, there's other parts where it doesn't really drag so much as they're just ""there"".Acting-wise Tom Cruise has always been a curious case since not only his celebrity status but his press and behavior after awhile kind of overshadowed his acting talents. While I'll admit that some performances aren't the greatest, when he does shine he kind of pulls out the stops and Jerry's probably his most layered performance after Magnolia. We also have Renee Zellweger who's finally not annoying (Cold Mountain) or just used as a superstar than an actress (Bridget Jones). We get Cuba Gooding Jr. as the very loud and charismatic Tidwell and also roles by Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, and Jay Mohr.The director's cut of Almost Famous entitled ironically ""Untitled"" is probably the best thing Crowe has his name attached to. The second would naturally be Jerry Maguire and while people might've gotten a little sick of the film, if you revisit after not seeing it for awhile like I have, you find the perfect date movie, or even just a movie for yourself.",5,4.5; one of the biggest hits of the 90's,1207958400,"04 12, 2008",2008,3007,"['Apparently', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'album', 'film', 'take', 'world', 'storm', 'everyone', 'raving', 'talking', 'success', 'film', 'almost', 'bigger', 'film', 'However', 'just', ""'re"", 'biggest', 'time', 'mean', 'were', 'best', 'just', 'simply', 'most', 'visible', 'Compare', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'first', 'huge', 'film', 'make', 'massive', 'business', 'so-so', 'successes', 'Singles', 'Say', 'Anything', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'long', 'considered', 'Crowe', 'best', 'work', 'yet', 'barely', 'got', 'box', 'office', 'attention', 'here', 'have', 'one', 'put', 'map', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'overall', 'film', 'quite', 'solid', 'years.Jerry', 'Maguire', 'sports', 'agent', 'scenes', 'sure', 'clients', 'get', 'best', 'contracts', 'sports', 'as', 'well', 'top', 'product', 'endorsements', 'time', 'becoming', 'more', 'money', 'lying', 'clients', 'mission', 'statement', 'details', 'ideas', 'better', 'relationships', 'clients', 'emotionally', 'sense', 'everyone', 'else', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'promptly', 'fired', 'help', 'Dorothy', 'Boyd', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'moved', 'writing', 'Rod', 'Tidwell', 'football', 'player', 'who', 'not', 'getting', 'life', 'respect', 'Jerry', 'what', 'wrote', 'never', 'acted', 'ever.One', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'quotable', 'easy', 'see', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'being', 'success', 'Equal', 'parts', 'drama', 'many', 'comedic', 'moments', 'actor', 'character', 'showcases', 'as', 'well', 'stuff', 'romantics', 'will', 'gush', 'over', 'have', 'everything', 'well', 'action', 'scene', 'speak', 'nothing', 'kind', 'unfair', 'many', 'would', 'find', 'overrated', 'bit', 'overexposed', 'thanks', 'several', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'most', 'flawless', 'film', 'scene', 'just', 'right', 'other', 'parts', 'where', ""n't"", 'really', 'drag', 'so', 'much', ""'re"", 'just', 'there', '.Acting-wise', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'always', 'been', 'curious', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'celebrity', 'status', 'press', 'behavior', 'awhile', 'kind', 'overshadowed', 'acting', 'talents', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'performances', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'when', 'shine', 'kind', 'pulls', 'stops', 'Jerry', 'probably', 'most', 'layered', 'performance', 'Magnolia', 'also', 'have', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'finally', 'not', 'annoying', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'just', 'used', 'superstar', 'actress', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'get', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'very', 'loud', 'charismatic', 'Tidwell', 'also', 'roles', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Jay', 'Mohr.The', 'director', 'cut', 'Almost', 'Famous', 'entitled', 'ironically', 'Untitled', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'Crowe', 'name', 'attached', 'second', 'would', 'naturally', 'be', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'people', 'might', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'little', 'sick', 'film', 'revisit', 'not', 'seeing', 'have', 'find', 'perfect', 'date', 'movie', 'even', 'just', 'movie']",Jerry Maguire

This movie is more than a romantic comedy but really a movie about life and the importance we place on the small things that tend to take away from the MORE important things like love and loss.  Jerry Maguire follows the story of Jerry Maguire (Cruise), a sports agent, as a flight of conscience costs him his job, but gains him the respect of a fellow employee (Zellweger) who begins to fall madly in love with the man Jerry 'could' be.  The thing is that Jerry hasn't fully embraced the prospect of what he 'could' be quite yet and has actually begun to regret his conscience all together.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Rod, a football player, and Jerry's only loyal client, who wants Jerry to 'Show me the money'.

It probably has something to do with the fact that it's been hailed at the best romantic comedy of all time and simply can't stand up under the weight of it's own hype.  Tom Cruise stars as the title character, a ruthless sports agent who discompationate heart miraculously turns to gold after being critized by an ailing clients son.  It's a mid-life crisis of sorts but I can't help but think the first half of Jerry's life had to be more interesting than this.  He outs himself among his collegues and clients which leads to his firing and provides the films best moment as a perfectly cast Jay Mohr puts a new twist on the old 'we're letting you go' speech.  So Jerry heads out into the world with a staff of one and an equally unimpressive clients list.  Renee Zellweger plays Jerry's love interest and does well with the part but I can't help but be miffed at the notion that there's anything more between these two than a strong physical attraction.  Both are eqally charming and cute which works to their disadvantage here, as Cameron Crowe loses hold of the reighs and lets his movie slip into the relms of fluff.

165310,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0800141741,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[51, 55]","Well, I'm incredibly late to the Jerry Maguire party, but I'm glad I finally made it.  I thought this was just a comedy, but I should have known better because laughs alone usually don't generate the kind of success this movie enjoyed.  This is a wonderful, feel-good movie with a surprisingly effective emotional payoff.  Tom Cruise is great, Cuba Gooding, Jr., steals every scene he's in, and that Renee Zellweger is nothing short of perfect.  They even threw in a clip of McGarrett on Hawaii Five-O and sent me away with Bob Dylan singing over the credits - in my book, that's going above and beyond the call of duty.  And I never tire of seeing someone break away from the cynicism of big business and actually put some heart back into an increasingly heartless way of life.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is, of course, a bigshot sports agent who has it all - then loses it all.  For some inexplicable reason, he develops a conscience late one night, puts together this huge ""mission statement"" all about reducing the number of clients and giving those remaining the genuine personal touch, and sends it to everyone in the company.  With a schlep of a boss like Bob Sugar (the always annoying Jay Mohr), his days with the company are, not surprisingly, numbered.  He vows to start his own company, desperately trying to hold on to the clients he has been representing - but all he ends up taking with him are outrageous Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), an accountant who was truly inspired by what he had written.  It doesn't seem like much, but he really has all he will ever need - he just doesn't realize it until the end of the movie.Life on his own is quite a struggle, especially after he breaks up with his vicious fianc&eacute;e (Kelly Preston), and I know it must be truly demoralizing to be defeated time and time again by Jay Mohr.  Rod Tidwell, a great player who doesn't get the notice (or money) he thinks he deserves, stays loyal to him, though, for rather inexplicable reasons - even after Maguire fails to get him the kind of big money he is looking for in a new contract.  Dorothy also stays with him, and Maguire grows increasingly close to her and her little boy Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki).  There's love in the air, and Maguire's famous problem with emotional intimacy makes what should be the simplest thing in the world immensely complicated.  We see a lot of Maguire at his worst - double-crossed, drunk, beaten up, wallowing in self-pity.  He never gives up, though, and that's what's important.  I find it a little problematic that he did not apply the principles of his ""mission statement"" to the way he lived his life, but - in his defense - guys tend to be pretty dense about this kind of thing (and would that we all had a Dorothy to help us see the light).There's a wonderful cast on display here, with uncommonly meaningful secondary characters: there's little Ray, of course, but Dorothy's bitter yet loving sister Laurel (Bonnie Hunt) and Rod Tidwell's wife Marcee (Regina King) really do lay claim to a commanding presence in the story.  You can also make a little game of spotting all of the sports personalities that make cameos (usually silent ones, thankfully) in the film.This isn't a comedy; it's a serious story that just happens to feature a lot of laughs.  It's a commentary on the depersonalization of business, a complicated yet wonderfully sweet love story, and a movie with a surprisingly big heart.  And I love Renee Zellweger.

I love the fact that Tom Cruise fails to change overnight, that he is more complex than that.  And while I'm on the subject, I normally don't hand out a lot of praise to Tom Cruise, but this is another excellent performance of late.  Having just seen COLLATERAL, I am beginning to wonder why he has always been overlooked as nothing more than a heartthrob.  His performance in JERRY MAGUIRE is quite moving and he was perfectly cast.Ultimately, I like JERRY MAGUIRE because its main character stumbles throughout the entire course of the film.  Just when you think the sugar-coated lenses are about to come down on the film (and it happens a lot), Cameron Crowe throws a wrench in the gears and things come crashing back down around Cruise's character.  Like many of Crowe's films, it is a film that dabbles in several genres (romantic love-story, comedy, drama) and ends up something quite different, but altogether entertaining.

165312,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,0800141741,David Anderson,"[2, 4]","In 1996, ""Jerry McGuire"" proved itself as a breakthrough film for many of its cast and crew.  It earned many awards, including five Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor [Tom Cruise],...), winning two (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor [Cuba Gooding Jr.]).  Therefore, this film proved the true potential in several of its cast members, namely Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and producer, director, and writer Cameron Crowe (2000's ""Almost Famous"", 2005's ""Elizabethtown"").  Though some had previously stretched themselves as artists occassionally, this film earned them newfound respect like never before.""Jerry McGuire"" follows a greedy workaholic sports agent who suddenly loses his job.  This begins his path of soul searching, which teaches him many life lessons, namely his true love.  When Dorothy enters his life, he realized the true worth of money is much less than the finer things in life which are free.  Meanwhile, he begins his own agency.  Only few of his clients follow him.  All except one, Ray, maintain this relationship with Jerry.  This becomes closer than ever as Jerry struggles to help him find his place in football and later, of purpose.  These series of storylines create an eyeopening masterpiece that leads to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion.Cameron Crowe begins his series of masterpieces with this film.  He proves in this film that he is one of the finest filmmakers of today.  He takes a creative, unique story and adds great substance in its events.  These written words often find some humorous scenes that maintains its dramatic theme unbelievably.  This shows that films don't need a large budget to attract audiences or to be amazing.  As with his following films, he never rushes any of his projects.  He assures himself that they are full quality, and that every storyline fit one another.  In particular, ""Jerry McGuire"" adds some clever quotes that make this film for added viewing pleasure including ""you had me at hello"", ""you complete me"", ""did you know that a human head weighs eight pounds"", and the most prominent ""show me the money"".  This undistinguishable writing style proves that sometimes, the most unexpected becomes the highlight.This roller coaster film could not be as enjoyable if it wasn't for the brilliant performances, namely but not limiting Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr.  They give their characters the unforgettable presence that may be close to impossible to most other actors.  Cruise offers his signature acting style to new extremes to the main character Jerry McGuire.  Zellweger's more emotional performances gives greater strength to the film's dramatic and romantic value.  Gooding offers the more eccentric theme that often gives the famous film quotes new meaning.Such film quality proves that ""Jerry McGuire"" has and always will stand the test of time.  This will surely please a variety of audiences, the more dramatic and the more comedic.  It has proved its capabilities as a future film classic.",5,You Had Me At Hello,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,3059,"['1996', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'proved', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'many', 'cast', 'crew', 'earned', 'many', 'awards', 'including', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Actor', '[', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ']', 'winning', 'two', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '[', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', ']', 'Therefore', 'film', 'proved', 'true', 'potential', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'namely', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'producer', 'director', 'writer', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', '2000', 'Almost', 'Famous', '2005', 'Elizabethtown', 'had', 'previously', 'stretched', 'artists', 'occassionally', 'film', 'earned', 'newfound', 'respect', 'never', 'before', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'greedy', 'workaholic', 'sports', 'agent', 'who', 'suddenly', 'job', 'path', 'soul', 'searching', 'many', 'life', 'lessons', 'namely', 'true', 'love', 'When', 'Dorothy', 'enters', 'life', 'realized', 'true', 'worth', 'money', 'much', 'less', 'finer', 'things', 'life', 'are', 'free', 'Meanwhile', 'own', 'agency', 'Only', 'few', 'clients', 'follow', 'one', 'Ray', 'maintain', 'relationship', 'Jerry', 'closer', 'ever', 'Jerry', 'help', 'find', 'place', 'football', 'later', 'purpose', 'series', 'storylines', 'create', 'eyeopening', 'masterpiece', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'conclusion.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'series', 'masterpieces', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'finest', 'filmmakers', 'today', 'creative', 'unique', 'story', 'great', 'substance', 'events', 'written', 'words', 'often', 'find', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'theme', 'unbelievably', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'large', 'budget', 'attract', 'audiences', 'be', 'amazing', 'following', 'films', 'never', 'projects', 'are', 'full', 'quality', 'storyline', 'fit', 'one', 'particular', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'clever', 'make', 'film', 'added', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'including', 'had', 'hello', 'complete', 'did', 'know', 'human', 'head', 'weighs', 'eight', 'pounds', 'most', 'prominent', 'show', 'money', 'undistinguishable', 'writing', 'style', 'sometimes', 'most', 'unexpected', 'highlight.This', 'roller', 'coaster', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'was', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'performances', 'namely', 'not', 'limiting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'give', 'characters', 'unforgettable', 'presence', 'may', 'be', 'close', 'impossible', 'most', 'other', 'actors', 'Cruise', 'signature', 'acting', 'style', 'new', 'extremes', 'main', 'character', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'Zellweger', 'more', 'emotional', 'performances', 'greater', 'strength', 'film', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'value', 'Gooding', 'more', 'eccentric', 'theme', 'often', 'famous', 'film', 'new', 'meaning.Such', 'film', 'quality', 'Jerry', 'McGuire', 'always', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'will', 'surely', 'please', 'variety', 'audiences', 'more', 'dramatic', 'more', 'comedic', 'proved', 'capabilities', 'future', 'film', 'classic']",Jerry Maguire

I've seen this little gem upteen times, enjoyed it even more with each viewing, and scratch my itchy head in amazement that I have yet to review it.  Suffice it to say the review begins now. . .Let's bypass the plot and the Big Three (Renee, Tom, Cuba); for me this movie ultimately succeeds by the fantastic performances of several of its second tier players.  Jay Mohr is the guy you love to hate as Jerry's backstabbing former boss, Bob Sugar; Bonnie Hunt is the manhater with a heart of pure gold as Renee's sis Laurel.  But Regina King tops them all as Marcee, loving and devoted wife of unappreciated and underpaid Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell.  King is a vivacious, voluptuous goddess who absolutely steals every scene she's in, and while she steals it she exudes steamy sensuality.  Rod Tidwell is one lucky dude.So with the strength of its cast and its delightful plot, JERRY MAGUIRE has something for everyone.  The Tom and Renee romance pleases the chicks, while the guys get off on the sports drama.  Furthermore, sports enthusiasts will thoroughly enjoy all the cameos made by sports celebrities and broadcasters.  Bottom line:  If you haven't seen JERRY MAGUIRE, by all means see JERRY MAGUIRE.

Not very many modern comedy/drama/romances actually have one, but that is what this movie is all about: relationships. Although there are some cliched moments where it seems like the typical comedy/romance, the romance part actually explores issues about true love, intimacy, marriage, and commitment that most movies are afraid to, even though these are very timely issues. The questions of why we marry, why we are we afraid of commitment and intimacy, and what true love is are all explored by the film, as well as deeper questions about what is important in our lives, through the lives of Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his family, and various other characters throughout the film. In addition to the excellent script however, the acting is also great. Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger are all wonderful, and Bonnie Hunt shines as Laurel, Dorothy's protective older sister.

Much of the movie truly stretches the viewer's credulity; we are often left wondering, &quot;Is he serious?  Now WHY in the world would he/she do THAT?&quot;  In other words, the characters are not well-developed enough to make their actions and decisions readily believable.  These 2-dimensional cardboard characters also have an unfortunate habit of delivering painfully florid and verbose pseudo-philosophical mini-soliloquys out of nowhere.Cruise is not really as well-chosen for this character as he was in &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; either---here, he just tries WAY too hard, ridiculously overacting almost in every scene.  His permanent, bread-and-butter Alpha-Male swagger never leaves him, even when he's supposed to be at rock-bottom, like at a scene when he shows up at Zelleger's house drunk after losing both his job and his fiance in the same day.Then there is the romance between Cruise and Zelleger's characters, which is the main box-office draw of this film, and its most cringe-triggering device.  This part of the script, even more so than the rest of the film, must've been directly written by a bunch of focus groups...it includes just about every abominably cheesy, tear-jerking, schmaltzy cliche in the book.  Ruthlessly and shamelessly manipulative, it almost destroys the rest of the film, which is actually not so bad.The Designated Irresistible Kid who plays Zelleger's son IS truly adorable and would've put Maculay Culkin out of a work had he been born about a decade earlier.  Him, Zelleger and especially Cuba Gooding Jr. are the main saving graces of this decent but deeply compromised film.

Regardless of my reservations about Cruise, he is ideally cast in the title role, an egocentric and mega-successful sports agent, who gets to hang out with celebrity athletes within a lifestyle that seems to epitomize the Peter Pan syndrome. That is, until Jerry reaches an epiphany about the excesses of his business and after crafting a poorly received ""mission statement"", is given the boot. Followed only by the nave accountant Dorothy Boyd, he starts a new management company, and due to the machinations of a slimy fellow agent at his now-former company, Jerry is left with just one athlete to represent, the self-absorbed, second-tier football player Rod Tidwell.From this premise comes a lightweight though insightful character study of people who are not able to be themselves among others and cannot seem to find what they want without the help of someone else telling them what they want. It appears Jerry's initial epiphany is more hard-earned than he expected, and the movie spends most of its running time exploring how he comes to realize its meaning in his life. What is great about the movie is the incisive, thoughtful dialogue peppered with nineties catchphrases that seem to live on eternally...""Show me the money!""...""You had me at hello""...""I love the man he wants to be""...""Help me help you""...and one of the best compliments I've heard though odd coming out of Cruise's mouth: ""That's not a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie."" There is a human scale to all the dilemmas in the movie which I find enveloping in unexpected ways, and characters you think you will loathe (including Cruise's) surprise you. Everything revolves tightly around the small triumphs and failures, and within the intimacy defined by Crowe, the humor and pain of the characters' lives seems authentic and often funny. And the humor is constant and more of the relatable recognition variety than laugh-out-loud silliness.Of course, it helps to have a great cast, and the movie benefits from one beginning with what I still feel is Cruise's career-best performance. Not a hugely versatile actor though dedicated, he portrays a character that fits the odd contours of his movie personality...brash, ambitious, emotionally frustrated, frat-house mindset evolving toward begrudging maturity. Beating out the likes of Parker Posey and Mira Sorvino for the role of Dorothy, relative newcomer Ren&eacute;e Zellweger portrays this epiphany-seeking single mother with her unique sensibilities and squeaky-voiced defiance. They have a genuine chemistry that I hope they repeat sometime soon. Playing Tidwell looks to be Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s career high-water mark, as he has not done anything remotely as interesting since then. He is flashy, funny, even cockier than Maguire and a believably devoted husband and father. Regina King expertly plays his sassy, negotiation-driving wife Marcee. My favorite scenes may be between Dorothy and her sister Laurel, played in typically witty fashion by Bonnie Hunt. Even the requisite ""cute kid"", Jonathan Lipnicki, is funny without being overly precious. Truth be told, a couple of the ancillary characters don't work as well - Todd Luiso as Chad the Nanny, a slacker, and Kelly Preston as Jerry's high maintenance &uuml;ber-bitch fianc&eacute;e. But these are minor flaws. Everything gets wrapped up perfectly, as you would suspect, but the journey there is unpredictable and wonderfully poignant.

I watched it intently but never quite figured out what made it so bloody great. Yeah, it was good, the story was nice, and the performances were mint. However this movie was one of the sort that I just had to see twice to fully appreciate. And appreciate it I did. I suddenly saw how close to real life the characters' interactions were. I saw a beautiful relationship between single mother and little son, and indeed between single mother and her older and protective sister. I saw a shallow, hollow guy (Cruise) become a whole person (not without a lot of ups and downs and bumps in the road). I saw a lovely relationship between Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character and his wife. I saw greed at its worst and of course, in the happy ending, I saw personal connections and commitments overcome some of the effects of greed. Described this way, the film sounds almost too sappy, but it isn't. The story is quite subtle and very realistic. Tom Cruise turns in a splendid performance as the title character; Ren&eacute;e Zellweger was the perfect actress for the part of Dorothy Boyd because she is beautiful but not too beautiful and possesses a charming and unspoiled quality that was perfect for the character and for the tone of the picture.  Gooding, Jr. was excellent and his work in a supporting role was honored with an Academy Award.

Of the two, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.

First it gives a positive image of sports by showing how one man, one agent can be different from all others in this ""industry"", and that the main difference is to believe in what he is doing, to believe in what his heart is telling him, to work with his heart and to love the players, the athletes he is working for, he is working with. That emotional, personal and very close relationship is what everyone needs all the time to feel needed, supported. The film shows that this is also the winning method because athletes want that contact and they can recognize that human attitude and they will work for this warmth of the heart, from the heart and in the heart. And what's more this relationship will enable the athletes as well as the agents to face the difficulties life is made of and life brings up all the time. This will mean success to the athletes as athletes and success for both the agents and the athletes financially. What's more the film conveys another tremendously positive image because the agent is white and the athlete is black and their relationship is one of trust, total friendship and confidence, one of love nothing but love and care and that is the right model to send in the public: what is important is not the differences among people but the possibility to establish trusting and loving relationships beyond these differences and accepting them totally.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,The world is so pale without love,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,1660,"['not', 'masterpiece', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'meaning', 'may', 'contain', 'images', 'audience', 'First', 'positive', 'image', 'sports', 'showing', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'agent', 'can', 'be', 'different', 'others', 'industry', 'main', 'difference', 'believe', 'what', 'doing', 'believe', 'what', 'heart', 'telling', 'work', 'heart', 'love', 'players', 'athletes', 'working', 'working', 'emotional', 'personal', 'very', 'close', 'relationship', 'what', 'everyone', 'time', 'feel', 'needed', 'supported', 'film', 'also', 'winning', 'method', 'athletes', 'want', 'contact', 'can', 'recognize', 'human', 'attitude', 'will', 'work', 'warmth', 'heart', 'heart', 'heart', 'what', 'more', 'relationship', 'will', 'enable', 'athletes', 'as', 'well', 'agents', 'face', 'difficulties', 'life', 'made', 'life', 'up', 'time', 'will', 'mean', 'success', 'athletes', 'athletes', 'success', 'agents', 'athletes', 'financially', 'What', 'more', 'film', 'conveys', 'tremendously', 'positive', 'image', 'agent', 'white', 'athlete', 'black', 'relationship', 'one', 'trust', 'total', 'friendship', 'confidence', 'one', 'love', 'nothing', 'love', 'care', 'right', 'model', 'send', 'public', 'what', 'important', 'not', 'differences', 'people', 'possibility', 'establish', 'trusting', 'loving', 'relationships', 'differences', 'accepting', 'totally.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",Jerry Maguire

Jerry quickly blows off the kid by saying ""no one can stop your dad"" and gets back to talking on his cell-phone. The kid then, gives him the finger and walks off. This a life changing event for Jerry for he realizes he has turned into someone he no longer wants to be. He then writes ""The Things We Were Afraid To Say Aloud"" memo to his co-workers about how they should be representing there players. Jerry then gets sacked from his job and loses all of his players except the loyal Cuba Gooding Jr.- Rod Tillwell who stays with him through and through. Jerry then leaves his job with Renee Zwelleger a single-mom, who was inspired by Jerry's memo. They form there own branch of representation and secretly Renee gets attracted to Jerry especially since Jerry loves her son so much. Only problem Jerry can't commit despite the fact he married(just so he could be dad to her son). I won't give away the ending, but this is what a romantic comedy should be not over the top and funny.Finally a romantic comedy that really is a comedy-One of my favorite lines is ""After two bottles of wine and a bad pizza I suddely grew a conscience.""Or the hilliarous ""Show me the money!"" sceneOr Jerry's major blow-up as he leaves the office.

I think we're almost there. Although, ""Jerry Maguire"" references are not completely gone (the ""you had me at fresh dough"" parody, for example.) Here's to hoping that the ad is just a local thing but I'm not sure.I still can't hear the ""Secret Garden"" song without my skin crawling due to its astounding overplay in this movie's heyday.To make matters worse, this movie is absolutely unworthy of its place in pop culture. I remember how endearing Jonathan Lipnicki was in the 30-second previews, but watching him at feature-length is excruciating--like slicing yourself with a dull and rusty razorblade.I don't know how to feel about what the film's success did for its cast and crew. On the one hand, it did solidify Cameron Crowe's reputation and cleared the way for him to make ""Almost Famous."" On the other hand, it made Cuba Gooding Jr. a star, which was a crime against humanity. This role made and ruined his career at the same time. It is one of his most annoying performances, and that's saying something. Worse, because it was a hit it is what most of his subsequent performances were modeled after.""Jerry Maguire"" was definitely not worth the wait. Rent ""Almost Famous"" instead... By the way, it took every ounce of restraint I possess not to title this review ""show me the movie."" You're welcome. Besides, it would have been counter-productive. It wasn't a total loss; there were some laugh-outloud moments hence the second star. Still, my expectations were inflated, and that is not my fault.

Dare I say, I might even be persuaded to see a movie, just because it's him in the lead.Maybe it's his religious zeal? I don't know. You have most of Hollywood wanting to crucify Bush and Cheney, and you have a substantial portion of Hollywood telling us it is perfectly normal to have two men make love to eachother. Now put down your stones. Don't throw rocks at me. I'm not saying it's wrong. It's just that here's a guy who doesn't back away from his feelings off the stage, tells you how he feels about redemption and life ever after, and he's the guy we raise our eybrows at? Go figure.And the couch incident on Oprah. Hey. Wait a sec. That's the same couch that Jim Frey told us he had been addicted to hard drugs, spent months in prison with bad guys, was befriended by a mobster, and he cried, Oprah cried and we cried. Then he came back when he was caught lying, and said he was only kidding. And he cried, Oprah cried and we cried. Maybe it's the couch.The point is, Cruise is a good actor. He has an early history with Hollywood. Hmmmmm. Let's see. Who else. Well Harrison, little Bobby D, Harvey, Martin Scorsese, Meryl Streep. Sounds like pretty good company. And the early stuff wasn't that bad. Risky Biz and before that Taps.And come on. Don't tell me that Dustin Hoffman did a better job of acting then Cruise did in Rain Man. Cruise had it all over him. But Hoffman was the sentimental favorite. That's all. See the movie again and tell me I'm not right.So I think Jerry Maguire is laugh-your-behind-off funny. Zellweger is hilarious, trusting, compassionate, focused on what she wants, and Gooding is a thousand percent better than in other movies like Pearl Harbor. And Cruise does a better than commendable job representing all of us when we do the right thing and the guy upstairs doesn't give us immediate gratification and acknowledgement.Like I said.

Hopefully you saw this movie fore the first time before the Oscars they actually showed the ""you had me at hello"" scene from the film's climax.  Not since ""Chinatown"" did the Oscars ruin a film by screening a spoiler clip like this one (the one where Jack gets Faye to spill the beans about her ""daughter"").Jerry Maquire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who has a moral ephihany and ends up getting fired.  Down to one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an angry wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, Jerry also snared single-mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) with his vision.  Gooding got the Oscar but the performance of the film really belongs to Cruise.  Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's older and wiser sister is, as always, a joy, and it is her look at Jerry during his climatic speech that assures the audience his character has indeed earned redemption.  If you look at the body of work he has produced to date, then Cameron Crowe may already be the acknowledged master of the modern romantic drama.  So explain to me how ""Say Anything,"" with one of the great romantic shots of all time, is not on AFI's list?  See?  #100 and already I am complaining.Most romantic line(s): TIE (a) ""I love you.

Tom Cruise is lively as Sports Player Management Agent Jerry Maguire.It is the reassessment of his business philosophy that causes Maguire to put forward drastic changes to his client management services. At first this results in a business and personal collapse, yet it is the depth of the people who stick by him that help cultivate what he desired from the outset, which is to provide a more personal level of service to his clients. Maguire also discovers love that is lasting, and his initial setbacks make way for a better life for him.This movie presents warmth that is too often lost in a world driven by selfish profiteering mentalities, and the viewer is given tremendous hope by a narrative that is rich with inspiring determination and plenty of good humor.Nicholas R.W.

""Yip"" Harburg's lyrics to the classic, Depression-era song he co-wrote with Harold Arlen, ""Paper Moon,"" sum up Jerry Maguire, a movie about the redemptive power of love in a crooked world that is just for show.""Jerry Maguire"" (Tom Cruise) is a top agent for professional athletes, working for the world's biggest sports representation firm, a butt-kissing and back-stabbing world, where the word ""love"" gets tossed about as easily as cuss words. And yet, Jerry does have one endearing, enduring quality: Loyalty.Late one night, Jerry has an epiphany, or as he puts it, he doesn't know if it was a ""breakdown"" or a ""breakthrough."" He types an inspiring ""mission statement"" on how agents ought to do their jobs. The mission statement does not have the intended effect, but it does inspire at least one person. (I'm being purposely vague, to avoid spoiling the story.)""Dorothy Boyd"" (Renee Zellweger) is an accountant at the firm, who is inspired by Jerry's words. She falls in love with Jerry, but does Jerry love her? Oh, and did I mention, that Dorothy is a ""single mother""? Well, actually, she's a widow; calling her a ""single mother"" is one of the movie's intermittent pc tics. Dorothy's chubby, bright son, ""Ray"" (Jonathan Lipnicki), who appears to be about five years old, and has been starved for a man in his life, takes to Jerry immediately. The feeling is mutual.(The other pc aspects involve a woman beating the hell out of Jerry, one character referring to a deaf relative as ""hearing-impaired,"" and the conceit of having a black NFL player lecture his white agent on how to love a woman, and on how to respect a ""single mother,"" a conceit which will be particularly jarring to anyone at all familiar with professional sports. At least the movie does have a sense of humor about feminism, and even a little about race, as the black player has Maguire shouting, ""I love black people!"")""Rod Tidwell"" (Cuba Gooding), whom Jerry represents, is an under-sized NFL wide receiver with an over-sized chip on his shoulder. This character gave America the phrase, ""Show me the money!,"" which became ubiquitous for a few months.Most of this two-hour-and-eighteen-minute movie consists of tightly framed, intimate scenes with either Cruise and Gooding or Cruise and Zellweger. ""Intimate"" means that the actors must carry the scene; there is no distraction to diffuse the drama or cover for poor performers. And as good as the scenes are with Zelleweger and Cruise, the ones with Cruise and Gooding are even more intense.I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but I have to give the Devil his due. He richly deserved his Oscar nomination as Jerry.This was Renee Zellweger's breakthrough role, in which she displayed the winsome, spunky persona that has since become her calling card in movies such as Bridget Jones' Diary and Cold Mountain.After Cuba Gooding won the Academy Award for best supporting actor as Rod Tidwell, I recall sitting in a Union Square coffee shop in Manhattan, and telling someone that Gooding only got the Oscar because he was black. A big, beefy, middle-aged black man in the next booth heard me and sighed loudly, to express his anger. (No, I hadn't yet seen the movie, but the odds were very much in my favor.) Well, I was wrong. Gooding's role is much meatier than a typical supporting role - almost a lead - and he makes the most of it.But there are many other great players, too. And every role is exquisitely cast, particularly Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's caustic, feminist, older sister, ""Laurel,"" who hosts a support group of embittered, man-bashing, forty-something women, Regina King in the Alfre Woodard role as Tidwell's wife, ""Marcee,"" and Jay Mohr as Jerry's slimy protege, ""Bob Sugar."" Beau Bridges and Kelly Preston also shine in smaller roles.Jerry Maguire is not ""high concept."" There are no car crashes. There is lots of talk. Amazing talk. Director-screenwriter Cameron Crowe wrote one of the best original scripts of the past twenty years. He does here what he has developed a well-deserved reputation for: Showing the world behind the faade (see also Almost Famous) of an apparently glamorous but actually tawdry social milieu (ain't they all?). This movie is for grown-ups.But Crowe choreographs scenes so well, whether involving a mob of people or just two, that they don't come off as ""talky."" (Besides, unless one is an action junkie, the feeling of ""talkiness"" is often the result of a bad script.)And oh, the acting. The comparison that comes to mind, is Terms of Endearment, which was the quintessential domestic drama. When TOE came out in 1983, I recall a critic writing that it showcased the best acting you'd ever see in an American movie. That judgment was unfair to American movies; TOE showcases some of the best acting you'll ever see in a movie, period. As does Jerry Maguire. There is not a single clearly flubbed line or wasted scene in this entire movie.The best thing I can say about Jerry Maguire, is that I liked it a lot the first time I saw it, and I loved it, the second time around.The Critical Critic, February 26, 2004",5,Love and Loyalty,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,5293,"['love', 'honky-tonk', 'love', 'melody', 'penny', 'arcade', 'Barnum', 'Bailey',

This soon leads to him getting fired from his agency and he his down to one demanding football-playing client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a secretary Dorothy Boyd (Rene Zellweger) who takes the plunge and comes with him.Jerry Maguire is a great romantic comedy filled with warmth and humour and characters you really care about. Underappreciated at time of release this is actually one of the great film comedies of the 1990's.Jerry Maguire is perfectly cast. Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr are simply brilliant and their interplay provides the real highlights of the film - making the most of a brilliant script. The film lags a little bit in the second half and Cruise and Zellweger's romance is not entirely convincing but this is still great compared to most comedies these days.Sadly, the commentary included on the DVD with the director and his three leads is a waste of time. It is a self-indulgent, back-slapping session of the very worst kind with insights on the level of ""I loved that scene"", ""you were great in the scene"", ""awesome"", etc, etc. Very disapointing as I was interested in gaining some insights on the making of this great film. Hopefully in a few year's time Crowe will produce a proper commentary that befits the film.The DVD does include a pretend Reebok commercial that is worth seeing with Cuba, but otherwise you could save your money and just buy the one-disc edition.",4,One of the great film comedies of the 1990's,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,1520,"['Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'sports', 'agent', 'who', 'epiphany', 'one', 'day', 'having', 'less', 'clients', 'less', 'money', 'soon', 'getting', 'fired', 'agency', 'down', 'one', 'demanding', 'football-playing', 'client', 'Rod', 'Tidwell', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'secretary', 'Dorothy', 'Boyd', 'Rene', 'Zellweger', 'who', 'plunge', 'him.Jerry', 'Maguire', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'filled', 'warmth', 'humour', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'Underappreciated', 'time', 'release', 'actually', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'comedies', ""1990's.Jerry"", 'Maguire', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'interplay', 'real', 'highlights', 'film', 'making', 'most', 'brilliant', 'script', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'second', 'half', 'Cruise', 'Zellweger', 'romance', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'still', 'great', 'compared', 'most', 'comedies', 'days.Sadly', 'commentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'director', 'three', 'leads', 'waste', 'time', 'self-indulgent', 'back-slapping', 'session', 'very', 'worst', 'kind', 'insights', 'level', 'loved', 'scene', 'were', 'great', 'scene', 'awesome', 'etc', 'etc', 'Very', 'disapointing', 'was', 'interested', 'gaining', 'insights', 'making', 'great', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'few', 'year', 'time', 'Crowe', 'will', 'produce', 'proper', 'commentary', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'include', 'pretend', 'Reebok', 'commercial', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Cuba', 'otherwise', 'could', 'save', 'money', 'just', 'buy', 'one-disc', 'edition']",Jerry Maguire

The scene in Dorothy's kitchen before Jerry and she go out to dinner is a magnificent piece of acting. She doesn't say a word - her facial expressions say it all.

The film is a romantic comedy with the underpinning of how ethics and values are treated in today's society.  Tom Cruise stars as the title character who is a highly successful sports agent.  After a night of heavy drinking, he types up a mission statement that is a little too much for his firm.  He becomes a pariah in the company and eventually his one time protegee (Jay Mohr) tells him he's been fired.  Jerry loses all of his clients except one Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  Renee Zellewiger is a worker at Jerry's firm and she is the only one who takes up his offer to leave with him for the agency he's starting up.  She is in love with Jerry and will do anything for him.  Eventually they fall in love and Jerry makes a big score for Rod.  Mr. Cruise gain exudes all the boyish charm that has made him a superstar.  Ms. Zellewiger has wholesome, girl next door looks and is sweet in her role.  Mr. Gooding is a whirling dervish in his role.  He is a ball of energy and the scene where he gets Jerry to shout &quot;show me the money&quot; became a major catch-phrase and part of the lexicon.  Mr. Gooding won a well deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar and the film cemented Mr. Crowe as the best double threat (directing &amp; writing) in movies this side of Woody Allen.",5,Show Me The Movie,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,1409,"['1992', 'relatively', 'disappointing', 'Singles', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'back', 'strong', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'underpinning', 'how', 'ethics', 'values', 'are', 'treated', 'today', 'society', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'highly', 'successful', 'sports', 'agent', 'night', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'up', 'mission', 'statement', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'firm', 'pariah', 'company', 'eventually', 'one', 'time', 'protegee', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'been', 'fired', 'Jerry', 'clients', 'one', 'Arizona', 'Cardinals', 'wide', 'receiver', 'Rod', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Renee', 'Zellewiger', 'worker', 'Jerry', 'firm', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'up', 'offer', 'leave', 'agency', 'starting', 'up', 'love', 'Jerry', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'Eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Jerry', 'big', 'score', 'Rod', 'Mr.', 'Cruise', 'gain', 'boyish', 'charm', 'made', 'superstar', 'Ms.', 'Zellewiger', 'wholesome', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'looks', 'sweet', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Gooding', 'whirling', 'dervish', 'role', 'ball', 'energy', 'scene', 'where', 'Jerry', 'shout', 'quot', 'show', 'money', 'quot', 'became', 'major', 'catch-phrase', 'part', 'lexicon', 'Mr.', 'Gooding', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'film', 'cemented', 'Mr.', 'Crowe', 'best', 'double', 'threat', 'directing', 'amp', 'writing', 'movies', 'side', 'Woody', 'Allen']",Jerry Maguire

165381,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800141741,Reviewer,"[6, 7]","By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, ""Success"" can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50.  No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in ""Jerry Maguire,"" the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really?  Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding ""No.""  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a ""mission/morality statement,"" in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic.  It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big ""M"" his superiors are interested in turns out to be ""Money"" and not ""Morality,"" as in ""Money talks, Jerry walks.""  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the ""real"" Jerry Maguire.Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with ""Say Anything"" in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In ""Jerry Maguire"" he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he ""Show me the money!"" Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd.  She's such a ""giving"" actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",5,It's NOT About the Money!,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,5740,"['definition', 'depending', 'who', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Success', 'can',

He is so emotionally vulnerable as Jerry Maguire that everyone is completely relating to him.Everyone sort of has this idea of sending out a memo to your colleagues to indicate what an ideal work life should be, however, when the reality hits about the memo and the people at the office are thinking what has he been smoking, then Jerry realizes that he is losing it.  When he gets fired by one of his underlings played wonderfully by Jay Mohr, then you know that you are on a wonderful emotional roller coaster called life with Jerry.Cameron Crowe does a wonderful job of directing Cruise through the evolving process of his character.  Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King, Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston and Jonathan Lipnicki definitely make the movie even better as they guide Jerry through the difficult process of life.Zellweger is great when she packs up her stuff and decides to follow Jerry into the unknown.  Gooding Jr. is great when he tells Jerry that he is the ambassador of ""kwan"".  Lipnicki is adorable as Jerry's new close little friend as Zellweger's son.I could go on about how this movie is the evolving character of a man who has a problem with an intimate relationship, but with a little help from his friend(Gooding Jr.), he realizes that the best thing in life is a truly committed intimate relationship.  One of the better realizations about this movie.If you like Crowe, Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding Jr., then you will have a great time seeing Jerry Maguire.

I have seen most of Tom Cruise's films and it's not like he's awful in this film or anything it just doesn't live up to Rain Man or A Few Good Men Tom Cruise acts much better in those movies. The Surrounding Actors were even worse and just how many people were in this movie there were so many characters I could not even keep track with the movie. The Film started out o.k I was even laughing at the beginning but I noticed this movie had odd humor when the child at the beginning said something very unsettling to Jerry Maguire. This movie towards the middle turns into this torturing bore it has sort of a chick flick pasted on it in which I had no idea this was a chick flick. Also towards the end I was not impressed at all. Jerry Maguire as a movie has very little going for it a bunch of whining actors and a bunch of out of shape greedy sports agents and some football player named Cuba Gooding Jr who is annoying from the start.

He writes a mission statement for his company that gets him fired, and sends him on a long journey of self-realization.  Sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you even get what you deserve -  just not always WHEN you expect it.This is one of the best feel good films I have ever seen.  Cameron Crowe's recipe for the perfect romance include a knock out script, unbelievable chemistry in the cast, and just the right quantities of drama, humor, and social commentary to satisfy everybody.  If that doesn't get you to buy this, consider this - Jonathan Lipnicki - the cute kid in the Little Vampire and Stuart Little - is even younger and cuter and superbly directed.  Key to the plot, he and Tom Cruise put down some of the best moments in the film, possibly on celluloid anywhere.  Those magic moments are one of Crowe's specialties.  You know those intimate little moments that really aren't in the script - like the way Kate Hudson looks at Patrick Fugit after she's just gotten bad intel on her current fling...they capture really deep truths about the character and make you bond with the characters in the film, almost like they were real people you'd like to know.Then Cuba Gooding just steals the film in more than a couple places.  Extremely funny, but much more than a caricature.  Easy to understand why he got the Oscar for this one.Renee Zellweger makes you want to watch the movie over and over again.  She captures the essence of what it feels like to trust someone who is your inspiration, to be vulnerable, to be strong - but not to be pathetic for a moment.  Again - part acting and part writing and directing.  Crowe followed this movie up with the best American film in a generation - Almost Famous.  His movies have enough pop culture in them to be entertaining - almost like a good musical hook - but enough soul truth to keep you coming back for a visit when the newness wears off.  He is skilled beyond belief, but weaves his magic so well - you never give it a thought.My only criticism in the DVD package itself.  It is hard to navigate and lacks any meaningful special features.  However, I still gave it five stars because I know I'll watch this as many times as I have seen Star Wars and the Sound of Music.

Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[2, 3]","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that lifts the spirits, gives you a smile, and makes going to the movies a great experience all over again.Cameron Crowe, of ""Say Anything"" fame, succeeds in bringing to life an everyday man struggling with everyday problems of the everyday common man. This particular common man is a sports agent, a very successful and, of course, rich agent who has a stunningly attractive fiance, athletes who depend on him to make fortunes, and friends who admirably and openly tell him ""I love you, Jerry!"". Jerry Maguire is his name. And he is played brilliantly by the ever-so-loved Tom Cruise. Despite all the love around him, however, Jerry does one mistake. It comes in the form of a mission statement where he challenges the business and dares to open up and speak out. The friends at the firm give him an expiration date, ""about two weeks!"", and it's up to his one time protegee Jay Mohr to tell him that he's fired in one of the most classic moments in movie history, sitting in a restaurant surrounded by a crowd of people (the scene where Tom Cruise stares down at his glass of water after Mohr blurts out 'I'm here to let you go' is as real as reality goes). Jerry is left struggling and failing to keep his clients except for one, the obnoxious Football player Rod Tidwell (played even more brilliantly by Cuba Gooding Jnr) His fiance leaves him labeling him a 'loser' and he finds himself battling to survive with the loudmouthed client and a single mother secretary, who quits the firm for him, who is the only left admirer of his 'memo'!Crowe, who writes and directs this movie, takes care of the characters' progress throughout the entirety of the movie. Jerry and the secretary (played by the sweet Renee Zellweger) slowly and passionately start to fall in love, and the relationship between Jerry and her only son grows from a goofy friendship into a father-son type of relation. But best of all is Jerry's one on one dialogue with Rod. Jerry can't stand the fact that he's stuck with Rod but faces the fact that he's his only hope left, and Rod still believes in Jerry and more or less becomes his right shoulder and gains him confidence. Like any other everyday man, Jerry still has people around telling him how great he is, even though he thinks very lowly of himself. This is the same theme throughout most of Crowes' films, especially ""Say Anything"" where John Cusack's character finds confidence through Lili Taylor.The movie is funny. With serious drama flowing thoughout.

165395,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0800141741,S. Schell,"[1, 2]","Not only did Cameron Crowe invent nifty terminology for his feisty football star Rod Tidwell, he brought it to life by reaping its benefits for this exceptionally well-written and directed picture about a talent shark who reevaluates his success-driven life. He got the love, he got the respect as a filmmaker, he got the money - the whole package that is...the QUAN! And speaking of &quot;showing the money&quot;, his multifaceted cast of actors dished out priceless performances that would've shrank to an unrecognizable state if in the hands of anyone other than Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding and Mohr. This is a tour-de-force ensemble that fed off each other's energy, blending and clashing seamlessly.It all starts with Cruise's smug narration of the film as the planet Earth swirls into view and centers upon the life of our title character traversing from press conference to press conference in search of more valuable clients. His morals are drenched in his motivation for money and fame. He is newly engaged to self-absorbed go-getter Avery Bishop (bravura comeback by Kelly Preston) and is popular with his envious co-workers. All seems well until the umpteenth hospitalization of a hockey player and the ire of his son brings him to an enlightening standpoint: fewer clients, less money, more personal attention. This and many more pages of an early-morning essay progress into a mission statement titled &quot;The Things We Think But Do Not Say&quot;, copied, bound and distributed to each of SMI's employee mailboxes. His frank dissertation on the company's business ethics merits him a merciless layoff by fellow colleague Bob Sugar at a private luncheon before they even glance at their menus. From there it is a race against time to keep some of his more valuable clients as he moves on to an ad hoc launch of his own agency in the wide world of budding athleticism. This is a delightful and energizing part of the movie to watch with Crowe's ability to create the fury and desperation of the moment, flashing back and forth consistently between the ravenous parties as they dial number after number, swaying their unwary clientele to and fro out of sheer competitiveness.The race ends with Jerry on the losing side, his only dangling claim a raucous, argumentative linebacker named Rod Tidwell that coerces Maguire to beg for his small but vital revenue. With star athlete Frank Kushman (Jerry O'Connell playing the numbskull quarterback) and all the rest under Sugar's greedy thumb, Jerry leaves SMI with tail tucked between legs and one devout volunteer: a smitten single mom named Dorothy Boyd who becomes his lone and tenacious account and, in due time, his wistful lover.This film possesses so many enjoyable performances that I hardly know where to start, but I guess I'll begin with the most prominent. Tom Cruise dispenses an audacious and extraordinary show that won him a Best Actor nomination, flailing new-fangled comedic genius about during his character's numerous nervous breakdowns and displaying his usual magnetic appeal that has served him in past projects such as &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; (my personal favorite!).

He has an attractive fiancee, a friendly group of friends, and that first class plane ticket with the extra glass of orange juice.He also has a problem with emotional intimacy that all of his ex-girlfriends will attest to.  He and his fiancee have naked conversations and purport to share everything with the idea that knowing a person's life story forges a connection.  He is a sports agent because he cares about sports, yet he neglects the values that would make him respect and love his job because those values are not commonplace in that business.  This is Jerry's problem.  He is almost, but not quite, what he wants to be.An attack of conscience and a slice of bad pizza late at night have him writing down all of the things he has repressed, and jumping in.  Predictably, he loses everything, fiancee, friends, and job.  His shallow life is gone, and this has Jerry noticably whacked.  Tom Cruise does a great job of playing the i've-fallen-off-the-edge, passionate, hug-craving Jerry.The transformation from cold shallow sports agent to emotional, cracked, truly affectionate-to-the-point-of-sappiness, golly gee apple pie live with your heart and inspire people is quite believable, because one gets the sense that this is the person Jerry has had inside of himself all along, but somehow along the way it was twisted.""We live in a cynical, cynical world,"" says Jerry.  People always talk about the ""Show me the money,"" scene, but that quote is really the heart of the film.  Having the courage to care less about the money, to be yourself, to care about people, want quality over quantity in what you do, love and live well.  THAT is what Jerry Maguire is really about.  The sports agent thing is just a very appropriate plot.  And ironically, Rod, Jerry's one and only client, is shown the money when he does just that, and becomes a fan favorite in a moment of spontaneous joy.I reiterate - love and courage verses cynicism.

The argument often employed in reviews is that one is an idiot for either liking or disliking something. Skipping the greater debate about what this says about our country; let me focus on the movie.Cameron Crowe has made some very nice movies and he's made some lousy ones. This is one of the really good ones, if not his best (haven't seen We Bought a Zoo yet, though...). It is tender, funny, and insightful. Additionally, it has his trademark great soundtrack choices (right up there with Scorcese) to provide further emotional attachment. The scene with an exuberant Cruise driving in the car while trying to find a song to celebrate with is smart and genuine.I won't argue that this movie is cheesy romantic or that it's driven by the narrow acting dimensions of Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger - neither of whom I'm hugely enamored of. On the other hand however, the script is strong enough that even they can't ruin it and Regina King and Cuba Gooding, Jr. give career performances.Yet, what I like most about it is the wisdom Crowe dispenses about love (""shouldn't be that hard""), relationships (""why do you love me?"" or ""we could lose ten years being nice"") and devotion to the truly important things in life (""if this is empty (heart), this doesn't matter (head)"").

Jerry (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who suddenly has a realizaion: he's become another shark in a suit. He writes a mission statement (not a memo) on how to improve the business of being a sports agent: ""Fewer clients, less money."" This way they can give each athlete better personal attention. Seems simple enough (to me it makes perfect sense), but in this day of ME ME ME and MO' MONEY Jerry's humanitarian idea just doesn't fly, and he gets fired. He strikes out to form his own company, maintaining one client (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a funny, moving, charming performance) and one coworker (Rene Zellweger). The movie has several laugh-out-loud moments which draw you in to like the characters, then hits you with the drama. It's an effective one-two punch. Also charming is Rene's son, played by Jonathan Lipnicki. There are lots of movies that use cute kids to carry the movie; thankfully, this isn't one of them. Most notable here is Cruise, who has transformed from a pretty face box office smash guarantee into an actor of astonishing, moving depth. The scene at the end where he comes home to his wife has got to be one of the most touching and sweet in cinematic history. Some people may find it corny, but what can I say...those people aren't human beings. They are the same ones who rather watch movies like Collateral Damage or any other mindless action film with some testosterone-driven ""good guy"" blowing away countless ""bad guys.""

165403,A1IR1HS8EZN0Y0,0800141741,"Steven Travers ""AUTHOR""","[4, 5]","Jerry Maguire should have won the Best Film Academy Award for 1996. Rock?n?roller Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times At Ridgemont High for Rolling Stone, infuses Maguire with some terrific musical selections, including The Who?s raucous version of ""Magic Bus"" from the ""Live at Leeds"" album. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is over-the-top, although an Oscar performance I do not believe he delivers. That being said, the film breaks some major rules of the American screenwriting paradigm.First of all, Maguire's character arc is all in the beginning. Jerry (Tom Cruise, loosely playing superagent Leigh Steinberg) ""grows a conscience"" in the film's opening sequence, proposing that his company take on fewer clients. Most films are about the main character arriving at this kind of revelation over a two-hour period.The second fault that Jerry Maguire must overcome is the goal of its main characters, which is to make money. We are asked to feel sorry for Jerry because he is fired, but here is a guy who has made a ton of dough and possesses a law degree. His only client is Arizona Cardinals ""shrimp"" wide receiver Rod Strickland (Gooding). The leap of faith includes the audience?s requirement of empathizing with Strickland, who is on the cusp of stardom playing in a small media market, carries a big attitude, and bitches about money from beginning to end. He is offered a four-year, $1.7 million deal by the club, and acts as if it is chicken feed. This begs the questions: How much money would he earn if he was not a pro football player, why are the Cardinals responsible for his never having to work after retirement, and couldn't you make do with 1.7 mil? When Strickland leads the Cardinals into the Play-Offs with a big catch to beat Dallas, he is rewarded with a four-year, $11.7 million deal. Conversely, in today?s financial sports climate, that is not all that much.Another hurdle the film is forced to climb is the passive aspect of its star (Cruise) when the going gets tough. Strickland appears to be paralyzed after his spectacular touchdown grab, but Jerry is a helpless by-stander who can only serve platitudes in his cell phone conversation with Rod's bitchy wife, Marcy. The star is supposed to be the guy who does something to save the day.The real story of Jerry Maguire is the love interest, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) and her adorable son, Ray. She shows loyalty to Jerry, is rewarded with marriage to Tom Cruise, who finally does something when he decides, months after the ceremony, to fall in love with his wife.The scene-stealer in Maguire, aside from Ray, is Jay Mohr as Bob Sugar, Jerry's smarmy agent/protege/nemesis. This was the first time I ever saw Mohr and I felt stardom was his, but it never quite came to him. He reminds me of Dennis Leary. If Jay is in it, I'll watch it, but his movies are not blockbusters and his TV shows get canceled. Mohr is a comic genius who, when he guest-hosts the Jim Rome Show, is rail-splitting funny. He did a sequence on Rome as ""Slam Man"" where he was talking about ""if the Yankees play the Mets in the Series it's gonna be?"" and he started to riff off movie lines: ""Waddaya all know about death"" (Berenger in ""Platoon""), ""going up the river in Apocalypse Now?"" that was insane.Maguire hit home with me particularly because I was Jerry Maguire, absent the happy ending. I was once a sports agent with one client (a Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder), who in the end lost the client (and big commissions) as a result of my business partner's obfuscations. A few years ago the player was in the news for bygamy when he put a gun in the mouth of his second ""wife"" and told her ""I'll O.J. you."" None of this surprised me. When I ""handled"" this character, we had to fly his women from one National League city to another under the radar of his real wife. We provided him our calling card so his calls to his women were not traced to his room or cell phones. Pirate wives were getting suspicious, calling various National League hotels to get their husband's phone records for ""tax purposes."" The player thought we were golden for keeping his activities underground. All in all, I am not proud of my participation in these sordid activities, but this is what agents do. Pro sports is a morally grimy business.In my case, I did not get the girl or the coin, but I got the kwon. My failure as an agent led to the priceless realization that a writing career is what really makes me happy! Despite its flaws, Jerry Maguire is a highly entertaining, realistic story, and one of the top sports films ever made.STEVEN TRAVERS[...]STRAVERSCA@aol.com",5,"""YOU ARE...WILDLY CHARISMATIC!""",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,4602,"['Jerry', 'Maguire', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Best', 'Film', 'Academy', 'Award', '1996', 'Rock', 'n', 'roller', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'who', 'wrote', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'Maguire', 'terrific', 'musical', 'selections', 'including', 'Who', 's', 'raucous', 'version', 'Magic', 'Bus', 'Live', 'Leeds', 'album', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'over-the-top', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'major', 'rules', 'American', 'screenwriting', 'paradigm.First', 'Maguire', 'character', 'arc', 'beginning', 'Jerry', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'loosely', 'playing', 'superagent', 'Leigh', 'Steinberg', 'conscience', 'film', 'opening', 'sequence', 'proposing', 'company', 'take', 'fewer', 'clients', 'Most', 'films', 'are', 'main', 'character', 'arriving', 'kind', 'revelation', 'two-hour', 'period.The', 'second', 'fault', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'must', 'overcome', 'goal', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'money', 'are', 'asked', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Jerry', 'fired', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'ton', 'dough', 'law', 'degree', 'only', 'client', 'Arizona', 'Cardinals', 'shrimp', 'wide', 'receiver', 'Rod', 'Strickland', 'Gooding', 'leap', 'faith', 'audience', 's', 'requirement', 'empathizing', 'Strickland', 'who', 'cusp', 'stardom', 'playing', 'small', 'media', 'market', 'big', 'attitude', 'bitches', 'money', 'beginning', 'end', 'offered', 'four-year', '1.7', 'million', 'deal', 'club', 'chicken', 'feed', 'questions', 'How', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'earn', 'was', 'not', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'why', 'are', 'Cardinals', 'responsible', 'never', 'having', 'work', 'retirement', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'do', '1.7', 'mil', 'When', 'Strickland', 'Cardinals', 'Play-Offs', 'big', 'catch', 'beat', 'Dallas', 'rewarded', 'four-year', '11.7', 'million', 'deal', 'Conversely', 'today', 's', 'financial', 'sports', 'climate', 'not', 'much.Another', 'hurdle', 'film', 'forced', 'climb', 'passive', 'aspect', 'star', 'Cruise', 'when', 'going', 'tough', 'Strickland', 'be', 'paralyzed', 'spectacular', 'touchdown', 'grab', 'Jerry', 'helpless', 'by-stander', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'serve', 'platitudes', 'cell', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Rod', 'bitchy', 'wife', 'Marcy', 'star', 'supposed', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'something', 'save', 'day.The', 'real', 'story', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'love', 'interest', 'Dorothy', 'Boyd', 'Renee', 'Zellwegger', 'adorable', 'son', 'Ray', 'loyalty', 'Jerry', 'rewarded', 'marriage', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'who', 'finally', 'something', 'when', 'months', 'ceremony', 'fall', 'love', 'wife.The', 'scene-stealer', 'Maguire', 'aside', 'Ray', 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'Bob', 'Sugar', 'Jerry', 'smarmy', 'agent/protege/nemesis', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'Mohr', 'felt', 'stardom', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'came', 'Dennis', 'Leary', 'Jay', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'blockbusters', 'TV', 'shows', 'get', 'canceled', 'Mohr', 'comic', 'genius', 'who', 'when', 'Jim', 'Rome', 'Show', 'rail-splitting', 'funny', 'did', 'sequence', 'Rome', 'Slam', 'Man', 'where', 'was', 'talking', 'Yankees', 'play', 'Mets', 'Series', 'gon', 'be', 'started', 'riff', 'off', 'movie', 'lines', 'know', 'death', 'Berenger', 'Platoon', 'going', 'up', 'river', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'was', 'insane.Maguire', 'hit', 'home', 'particularly', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'absent', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'once', 'sports', 'agent', 'one', 'client', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirate', 'outfielder', 'who', 'end', 'lost', 'client', 'big', 'commissions', 'result', 'business', 'partner', 'obfuscations', 'few', 'years', 'player', 'was', 'news', 'bygamy', 'when', 'put', 'gun', 'mouth', 'second', 'wife', 'told', ""'ll"", 'O.J', 'None', 'surprised', 'When', 'handled', 'character', 'had', 'fly', 'women', 'one', 'National', 'League', 'city', 'radar', 'real', 'wife', 'provided', 'calling', 'card', 'calls', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'traced', 'room', 'cell', 'phones', 'Pirate', 'wives', 'were', 'getting', 'suspicious', 'calling', 'various', 'National', 'League', 'hotels', 'get', 'husband', 'phone', 'records', 'tax', 'purposes', 'player', 'thought', 'were', 'golden', 'keeping', 'activities', 'underground', 'am', 'not', 'proud', 'participation', 'sordid', 'activities', 'what', 'agents', 'do', 'Pro', 'sports', 'morally', 'grimy', 'business.In', 'case', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'girl', 'coin', 'got', 'kwon', 'failure', 'agent', 'led', 'priceless', 'realization', 'writing', 'career', 'what', 'really', 'happy', 'flaws', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'realistic', 'story', 'one', 'top', 'sports', 'films', 'ever', 'made.STEVEN', 'TRAVERS', '[', ']', 'STRAVERSCA', '@', 'aol.com']",Jerry Maguire

The film really deals with interpersonal relationships and is one of the most thought-provoking films Cruise has ever done.The performances are amazing. Tom received a Best Actor nomination for his role (the second in his career), Renne Zellweger gives a fine performance as the girl Maguire falls in love with, and Gooding is knock-out hilarious.

I love that even though Cruise is undoubtedly the star of the movie (the title of the movie?!?), the greatness of the film didn't depend on his star power. The movie got a great supporting cast from Renee Zellweger to Cuba Gooding Jr., the movie's got a great screenplay (""Show me the money!!!"" ""You complete me""... ""You had me at hello"") that is amusing and funny and perceptive and intelligent without being pushy. I love that the characters are eloquent but knows its boundaries and know that a simple glance or close up or smirk says it all. In short the screenplay knows when to talk and when to shut up!I also love the music used in the movie, I swear every time I hear ""Free Falling"" I can just picture Tom Cruise singing his lungs out or the Secret Garden by Springsteen, which is another song that I associate with the movie And of course there are the great performances by the entire cast. Cruise did a great job playing the character, it's fun seeing him play a loser for a change. This is one of his best performances. Renee Zellweger in her breakthrough role was radiant. Even though there's no doubt she's grown as an actress (from Chicago to Cold Mountain), I miss the understated, quiet effervescence and just vulnerability she showed in this movie (also in One True Thing). Cuba Gooding Jr the scene stealer himself, was just great. I especially like the scenes where he's making fun of Jerry. All of those things were used by Cameron Crowe to create this wonderful film.In the DVD, there's a great extra, a video commentary. It's the normal commentary that we know except that there's another screen where we can see the speakers (Cruise, Zellweger, Gooding, Crowe). There's a small box at the bottom of the screen where we see the movie the way they see them. That was just innovative and very fun to watch, I wonder why others don't adopt this kind of commentary.

Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  The name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading. So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns. And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  In the cold light of morning; however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' the equation equals `Money talks, Jerry walks.' But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own. He's up, he's positive, he has his statement and he doesn't have a clue what to do next. What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting and the world is about to meet the ""real"" Jerry Maguire.Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with ""Say Anything"" in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker. In ""Jerry Maguire"" he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience. Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations and it's these characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life. Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he ""Show me the money!"", Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters. Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a ""giving"" actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  ""Jerry Maguire"" is well beyond the normal sports drama, and in fact, the film has virtually nothing to do with sports.  Intertwining the themes of machoism, greed, and reputation, Crowe sends the audience on a journey that discusses integrity, love, and the ultimate enjoyment of life.  A touching, oftentimes hilarious, and supremely well-executed masterpiece of filmmaking.",5,Jerry Maguire  (1996),1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,4379,"['Director', 'Cameron', 'CroweCast', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'Jay', 'Mohr', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'Regina', 'King', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki.Running', 'Time', '139', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'sexuality.Director', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'ask', 'simple', 'question', 'life', 'money', 'fame', 'glory', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'high-powered', 'sports', 'agent', 'huge', 'agency', 'handling', 'portfolio', 'filled', 'high', 'profile', 'sports', 'figures', 'name', 'Jerry', 'game', 'money', 'big', 'bucks', 'limelight', 'end', 'down', 'mighty', 'big', 'bucks', 'firm', 'One', 'night', 'up', 'look', 'mirror', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'what', 'selfish', 'soulless', 'empty', 'life', 'leading', 'So', 'wake', 'epiphany', 'moment', 'down', 'keyboard', 'hammers', 'out', 'mission/morality', 'statement', 'entire', 'approach', 'career', 'including', 'reestablishing', 'parameters', 'setting', 'new', 'priorities', 'making', 'conscience', 'ethics', 'integrity', 'paramount', 'concerns', 'still', 'riding', 'high', 'nocturnal', 'enlightenment', 'office', 'copies', 'statement', 'mailboxes', 'everyone', 'boss', 'down', 'cold', 'light', 'morning', 'however', 'what', 'done', 'races', 'office', 'avert', 'disaster', 'room', 'hail', 'praise', 'appreciation', 'peers', 'boss', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'surprise', 'Jerry', 'then', 'when', 'big', 'M', 'superiors', 'are', 'interested', 'out', 'be', 'Money', 'not', 'Morality', 'equation', 'equals', 'Money', 'talks', 'Jerry', 'make', 'own', 'up', 'positive', 'statement', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'What', 'know', 'adventure', 'lifetime', 'awaiting', 'world', 'meet', 'real', 'Jerry', 'Maguire.Cameron', 'Crowe', 'made', 'debut', 'writer/director', 'Say', 'Anything', '1989', 'first', 'exhibited', 'keen', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'been', 'one', 'trademarks', 'success', 'filmmaker', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'again', 'acute', 'sense', 'knowing', 'what', 'people', 'tick', 'doubt', 'how', 'convey', 'audience', 'Crowe', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'presentation', 'original', 'imaginative', 'real', 'characters', 'involved', 'very', 'real', 'situations', 'characters', 'really', 'sell', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'cardboard', 'cut-outs', 'moreover', 'Cameron', 'how', 'get', 'best', 'actors', 'really', 'bring', 'life', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'Jerry', 'look', 'energy', 'talent', 'get', 'guy', 'skin', 'make', 'tick', 'successfully', 'channels', 'natural', 'exuberance', 'character', 'tempering', 'performance', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'really', 'work', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'performance', 'deserving', 'acclaim', 'received', 'Rod', 'Tidwell', 'pro', 'football', 'player/client', 'who', 'Jerry', 'Show', 'money', 'Gooding', 'equals', 'not', 'Cruise', 'level', 'enthusiasm', 'vibrant', 'rich', 'portrayal', 'Rod', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Cruise', 'Gooding', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'points', 'up', 'again', 'what', 'acute', 'sense', 'Cameron', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'work', 'bring', 'story', 'so', 'convincingly', 'screen.Not', 'be', 'outdone', 'co-stars', 'Renee', 'Zellweger', 'endearing', 'performance', 'vulnerable', 'steadfast', 'single', 'mom', 'Dorothy', 'Boyd', 'such', 'giving', 'actor', 'Dorothy', 'gentle', 'caring', 'manner', 'deepest', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'so', 'well', 'work', 'here', 'bit', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'Cruise', 'Gooding', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'overlooked', 'such', 'vital', 'presence', 'film', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'well', 'normal', 'sports', 'drama', 'fact', 'film', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'do', 'sports', 'Intertwining', 'themes', 'machoism', 'greed', 'reputation', 'Crowe', 'audience', 'journey', 'integrity', 'love', 'ultimate', 'enjoyment', 'life', 'touching', 'oftentimes', 'hilarious', 'supremely', 'well-executed', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking']",Jerry Maguire
