1430807,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B004WO9OUC,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 2]","Witchville is a direct to TV movie and for what it is and the budget they had to make this flick it is surprisingly good. Witchville is about Malachi, a roguish young prince who get called home as his father, the king, is on his deathbed. Malachi reluctantly go back to the kingdom where he now will be the new ruler, unfortunately the new king find the land to be barren and the people starving for apparently no good reason. Soon explanation comes in the form of a traveling mystic who claim King Malachi's land have been cursed by witches so the king, his friends and the mystic set out in search of The Red Queen, the powerful witch who are leading the magical assault on the lands, as only by killing her can Malachi's homeland be saved.Witchville is a typical swords and sorcery movie, the heroes go out on a quest to vanquish the supernatural evil, on the way they meet some new companions, have to find their way through dangerous situations, have some epic sword fights against evil creatures and...well I do not need to explain the genre for you. Witchville do not deviate much from this formula, however it do present a stereotypical story in a fun and entertaining way. The villains in this flick, the witches is done quite good, they are not just women with magical abilities but are made more into creatures, without losing their humanity completely and I found them quite interesting. The story of Witchville works, it is not groundbreaking but the twists and turns is well written and it leaves you with the feeling of having been told a good story. There is not that many movies in the swords and sorcery genre and this one is a pretty good one.I can not however say that I liked everything about Witchville, the characters are extremely one sided, you have a handsome rouge, the wise king, the stern warrior, the bumbling but knowledgeable magician, the beautiful daughter of the main villain who is torn between love and her evil ways and so on, the character concepts sounds like they are taken straight out of D&D;'s sample characters lists. The villains are no better and they generally suffer from the because I am evil syndrome to explain the motivations behind their actions. I am not saying that a movie have to have original characters which have nothing in common with any other movie character ever shown, but it would be nice if they where more than paper cut outs. I also think that the acting in Witchville is a little hit and miss, some of the actors do a great job, while others sound like they are reading from the script. Costumes in this movie is a joke, now I know the movie makes had little resources but seriously, if you do not have allot of money for costumes do not go for something very fancy. Everyone run around with armor with skulls and spikes everywhere, the problem is that those spikes wiggles as the actors walk showing quite clearly that they are definitely not made of metal. My biggest peeve with Witchville however is the lack of extras. The village outside of Malachi's castle have perhaps 20 inhabitants, we see a grand total of five soldiers through the entire movie and The Red Queen only have a handful of henchmen it seams. To me this was the biggest problem for suspense of disbelief, there where just not enough people in the scenes to give the impression that the character's world was real. I felt like I was watching a theater play and not a movie, and quite frankly even those usually have more extras than this movie have.All in all Witchville is a fun swords and sorcery flick, if you are a fan of the genre then I do not think you will be disappointed. Yes the movie have some big flaws and it is pretty generic, but the story is good and the villain concept is interesting. I had fun watching this movie and I will probably watch it again. I recommend this movie, if you can handle the flaws it have then it is a fun fantasy romp, also as fans of swords and fantasy I think it is important to support movies like this so better the chance that more such fantasy movies are made in the future.",3,A swords and sorcery movie that works.,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,4064,"['Witchville', 'direct', 'TV', 'movie', 'what', 'budget', 'had', 'make', 'flick', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Witchville', 'Malachi', 'roguish', 'young', 'prince', 'who', 'get', 'called', 'home', 'father', 'king', 'deathbed', 'Malachi', 'reluctantly', 'go', 'back', 'kingdom', 'where', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'ruler', 'unfortunately', 'new', 'king', 'find', 'land', 'be', 'barren', 'people', 'starving', 'apparently', 'good', 'reason', 'Soon', 'explanation', 'form', 'traveling', 'mystic', 'who', 'claim', 'King', 'Malachi', 'land', 'have', 'been', 'cursed', 'witches', 'so', 'king', 'friends', 'mystic', 'set', 'out', 'search', 'Red', 'Queen', 'powerful', 'witch', 'who', 'are', 'leading', 'magical', 'assault', 'lands', 'only', 'killing', 'can', 'Malachi', 'homeland', 'be', 'saved.Witchville', 'typical', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'movie', 'heroes', 'go', 'out', 'quest', 'vanquish', 'supernatural', 'evil', 'way', 'meet', 'new', 'companions', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'dangerous', 'situations', 'have', 'epic', 'sword', 'fights', 'evil', 'creatures', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'explain', 'genre', 'Witchville', 'do', 'not', 'deviate', 'much', 'formula', 'however', 'do', 'present', 'stereotypical', 'story', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'way', 'villains', 'flick', 'witches', 'done', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'magical', 'abilities', 'are', 'made', 'more', 'creatures', 'losing', 'humanity', 'completely', 'found', 'quite', 'interesting', 'story', 'Witchville', 'works', 'not', 'groundbreaking', 'twists', 'turns', 'well', 'written', 'feeling', 'having', 'been', 'told', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'genre', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'one.I', 'can', 'not', 'however', 'say', 'liked', 'everything', 'Witchville', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'one', 'sided', 'have', 'handsome', 'rouge', 'wise', 'king', 'stern', 'warrior', 'bumbling', 'knowledgeable', 'magician', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'main', 'villain', 'who', 'torn', 'love', 'evil', 'ways', 'so', 'character', 'sounds', 'are', 'taken', 'straight', 'D', 'D', 'sample', 'characters', 'lists', 'villains', 'are', 'better', 'generally', 'suffer', 'am', 'evil', 'syndrome', 'explain', 'motivations', 'actions', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'have', 'have', 'original', 'characters', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'other', 'movie', 'character', 'ever', 'shown', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'where', 'more', 'paper', 'cut', 'outs', 'also', 'think', 'acting', 'Witchville', 'little', 'hit', 'miss', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'others', 'sound', 'are', 'reading', 'script', 'Costumes', 'movie', 'joke', 'now', 'know', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'resources', 'seriously', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'allot', 'money', 'costumes', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'something', 'very', 'fancy', 'Everyone', 'run', 'armor', 'skulls', 'spikes', 'everywhere', 'problem', 'spikes', 'wiggles', 'actors', 'walk', 'showing', 'quite', 'clearly', 'are', 'definitely', 'not', 'made', 'metal', 'biggest', 'peeve', 'Witchville', 'however', 'lack', 'extras', 'village', 'Malachi', 'castle', 'have', 'perhaps', '20', 'inhabitants', 'see', 'grand', 'total', 'five', 'soldiers', 'entire', 'movie', 'Red', 'Queen', 'only', 'have', 'handful', 'henchmen', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'suspense', 'disbelief', 'where', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'people', 'scenes', 'give', 'impression', 'character', 'world', 'was', 'real', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'theater', 'play', 'not', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'even', 'usually', 'have', 'more', 'extras', 'movie', 'have.All', 'Witchville', 'fun', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'flick', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Yes', 'movie', 'have', 'big', 'flaws', 'pretty', 'generic', 'story', 'good', 'villain', 'concept', 'interesting', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'recommend', 'movie', 'can', 'handle', 'flaws', 'have', 'then', 'fun', 'fantasy', 'romp', 'also', 'fans', 'swords', 'fantasy', 'think', 'important', 'support', 'movies', 'so', 'better', 'chance', 'more', 'such', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'future']",Witchville

It promises schlocky plots, horrible acting, and slapdash production values that make movie snobs cry.And ""Witchville"" is.... not nearly as bad as most of SyFy's original movies. Most of this is due to the presence of the ever-awesome Luke Goss, whose mere presence elevates any movie he's in. It's a schlocky, cheesy sword-and-sorcery story that needed a bigger budget than it had, but it tries pretty hard with what it does have.After of years of exile, Malachai (Goss) and his buddy Jason (Ed Speleers) return to their  homeland after hearing that Malachai's royal dad has died. Unfortunately, the kingdom is being ravaged by a famine -- and according to a wandering witch-hunter named Kramer, the famine is due to witches. He also has a magic book about how to find and kill witches.So Malachai, Kramer, Jason and a small number of warriors set out to find the Red Queen (Sarah Douglas), who commands all the witches, as well as her daughter Jozefa. However, they haven't reckoned with the Red Queen's power and cunning, or the secret reason she wants to conquer Malachai's kingdom.""Witchville"" is pretty much your standard sword-and-sorcery schlock -- it has a lot of age-old cliches (oh look, the pretty young witch is being reformed by a hot shirtless guy), the costumes are Word of Warcraft castoffs, the fight scenes are painfully bad, and the budget was obviously tiny (Malachai's ""kingdom"" appears to be ONE VILLAGE).It's cheesy, but unlike most SyFy movies, it's not offensively stupid. And I have to admit, the people behind it did obviously try to make as good as a movie as possible. The plot is decent and moves at a steady pace, and the writers do pull a impressive switcheroo at the end that reverses a lot of the ideas we had about the characters.And then... there's Luke Goss. I would watch a laxative commercial if it starred Luke Goss. The man has incredible presence, charisma and deep talent, and he gives a depth to his standard character that a lesser actor couldn't. And yes, he appears sweaty, shirtless and tied up. Douglas similarly seems like a cardboard villain for the first four-fifths of the movie, but breaks out into a passionate, tragic turn near the end.The rest of the actors are a mixed bag. Most of them such as Xiaofei Zhou and Andrew Pleavin are so wooden you could hammer nails in them. Ed Speleers has gotten a lot better since his stint in ""Eragon,"" but his character is so annoying that you'll probably wish someone had set HIM on fire. As for Simon Thorp as the witch-hunter, he gives a solid if very underused performance.""Witchville"" is no ""Lord of the Rings,"" but it's also no ""Mega-Shark Vs. Giant Octopus"" -- it's brain candy with bad fight scenes and a great performance by Luke Goss. Expect high-fantasy cheez, and that is what you will get.",3,We found a witch!
