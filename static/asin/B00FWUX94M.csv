1673583,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00FWUX94M,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[3, 4]","This is a review of Whitechapel as, except for saying that Cornish sweets are usually good, I cannot add much about them!  Potential purchasers should note that these are Region 2 (European Format) DVDs and are not going to work for you unless you have a Region 2 or Region Free DVD player.If ever a successful TV programme had to keep reinventing itself it is Whitechapel as anyone who has seen the previous seasons will appreciate. To its credit, we are now on the fourth series and each has been fascinating as a study in the dark side of human behavior. The first two series were about Jack the Ripper and the Kray Twins respectively, which are the only two crimes which most would associate with the Whitechapel area of London. We then moved on to two part stories for the third series, based on historical crimes which would not be widely known, but nonetheless were true crimes, details of which could easily be googled.This series, however, again consists of 3 two part stories but these are based on rather gruesome crimes with medieval overtones of torture, rather than specific historical crimes, although Buchan usually manages to come up with some precedents. For example, the second tale which was probably the grisliest, involved a series of murders where the murderer specialized in flaying the faces from the bodies of his victims. This series is, on balance, probably a little more gruesome than what went before and there are definite supernatural overtones which were not present in previous series. It certainly retains the ability to shock and makes for dark but absorbing viewing.Rupert Penry-Jones and Philip Davis are convincing DI Chandler and DS Miles, although their relationship remains less than harmonious on occasion since they are often not on the same wavelength. However, in many ways they do complement each other. Chandler himself often appears on the edge and at times close to a breakdown. Edward Buchan, played by Steve Pemberton, is the expert in historical crimes who is usually able to come up with the historical parallels which help to solve the crimes.I imagine that Whitechapel is set to be with us for some while which is really good news. Dark it certainly is and probably not for the squeamish, but it all makes for great entertainment.",5,"Even Darker, Great Entertainment.

It is a superb movie, well done and well acted.  Colin Firth doesn't a fine job portraying a former British Army officerwho was tortured badly at the hands of the Japanese during WW II.  The haunting dreams tear him apart inside and he has escaped inside himself with his hobby of trains.  Not models, but all aspects and schedules of regular trains.  He is on one of these when he meets Nicole Kidman and falls in love.  They wed and it helps for awhile, but she sees the torture that goes through in his dreams and reaches out to his friend Stellan Skarsgard to find out what is happening to him.  She finds out about his war troubles and the terrible things that he refuses to talk about.  He keeps seeing the Japanese officer that he felt was responsible for his tortures.  His friend has located the man and she encourages him to finally confront the main.  This was based on a true story and a successful book.

1673585,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00FWUX94M,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""The Railway Man"" is the dramatization of the memoir of British Army Lieutenant Eric Lomax, captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore in 1942, forced to work on the Burma-Thailand ""death"" Railroad along with thousands of his fellow POWs, and made to endure privation and torture at the hands of his brutal Japanese captors.  Colin Firth stars as the elder Lomax, whom we meet in middle age, beginning a new marriage and still suffering from acute PTSD.  His wife (well-played by Nicole Kidman) is determined to end his suffering.  She worms the story of his wartime experiences out of Lomax's former commanding officer Findley, played in the present by Skellan Skarsgard and in the past by Sam Reid.  Lomax eventually undertakes a journey to Thailand to confront his past.  The lives of the older and younger Lomax are played out in parallel, in a story that is so emotion-charged as to be very tough to watch.The location shooting in the UK, especially Scotland, and in Thailand is extremely good, as is the recreation of the wartime death railway.  A superb performance by Jeremy Irvine as the heroic younger Lomax are matched by the nuanced acting of Hiroyuki Sanada and Tanro Ishida as the older and younger versions of the Japanese Kempetai officer who tortured Lomax.  The matchup of the music score and the story is so flawless as to make you forget it's presence.  The pacing of the storyline is excellent, as the scenes shift back and forth from Scotland to the Far East and from past to present.  The ending is something you have to see; highly recommended.",5,Living hell...,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,1575,"['Railway', 'Man', 'dramatization', 'memoir', 'British', 'Army', 'Lieutenant', 'Eric', 'Lomax', 'captured', 'Japanese', 'fall', 'Singapore', '1942', 'forced', 'work', 'Burma-Thailand', 'death', 'Railroad', 'thousands', 'fellow', 'POWs', 'made', 'endure', 'privation', 'torture', 'hands', 'brutal', 'Japanese', 'captors', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'elder', 'Lomax', 'whom', 'meet', 'middle', 'age', 'beginning', 'new', 'marriage', 'still', 'suffering', 'acute', 'PTSD', 'wife', 'well-played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'determined', 'end', 'suffering', 'story', 'wartime', 'Lomax', 'former', 'commanding', 'officer', 'Findley', 'played', 'present', 'Skellan', 'Skarsgard', 'past', 'Sam', 'Reid', 'Lomax', 'eventually', 'journey', 'Thailand', 'confront', 'past', 'lives', 'older', 'younger', 'Lomax', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'parallel', 'story', 'so', 'emotion-charged', 'be', 'very', 'tough', 'watch.The', 'location', 'shooting', 'UK', 'especially', 'Scotland', 'Thailand', 'extremely', 'good', 'recreation', 'wartime', 'death', 'railway', 'superb', 'performance', 'Jeremy', 'Irvine', 'heroic', 'younger', 'Lomax', 'are', 'matched', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'Hiroyuki', 'Sanada', 'Tanro', 'Ishida', 'older', 'younger', 'versions', 'Japanese', 'Kempetai', 'officer', 'who', 'tortured', 'Lomax', 'matchup', 'music', 'score', 'story', 'so', 'flawless', 'make', 'forget', 'presence', 'pacing', 'storyline', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'shift', 'back', 'forth', 'Scotland', 'Far', 'East', 'past', 'present', 'ending', 'something', 'have', 'see', 'highly', 'recommended']",The Railway Man [NON USA FORMATTED VERSION REGION 2 DVD]
1673586,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00FWUX94M,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 2]","If any show deserves credit for breaking free of its original formula and striving to remain fresh and innovative, it's ""Whitechapel"". It began asa three part mini-series, postulating what it would happen if the contemporary police force had to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper. Using modern methods and historical precedence, old veteran Ray Miles and inexperienced, overpromoted Joe Chandler put aside their differences in order to hunt a copy-cat killer through the streets of Whitechapel.Fast-forward to season four, and you'll find that the storylines, format and even the genre has shifted into something quite different. For the first two seasons ""Whitechapel"" was a fairly straightforward crime drama, whereas season three veered more into crime horror, with a range of macabre murders and the barest trace of unexplainable ghostly phenomena at work.With season four, we've fully entered the Gothic genre, with all the staple characteristics and themes you'd expect: unexplainable supernatural occurrences, loss of identity, the onset of paranoia, the questioning of what's real and what isn't, and a shift away from the usual police procedural to include an added emphasis on each individual in the team as they undergo their own personal hauntings.The characters are as strong as ever: by now Miles and Chandler have become a tight duo (the former is the only one who can help the latter with his crippling OCD tendencies)  and they're backed up by the over-enthusiastic historian Ed Buchan, who provides unpaid research out of self-importance and sheer love for the investigative process. There's also Kent, a young investigator who may or may not be in love with Chandler, the womanizing and irresponsible Mansell, who begins dating the hitherto unknown twin sister of Kent, and Megan Riley, the only woman on the team who is beginning to feel the strain of balancing work and home, as well as the men's unspoken assumption that she'll automatically be the one to comfort bereaved victims.There are three cases altogether, each one divided into two episodes. The first has the team discover a tramp who has died as a result of 16th century torture, the peine forte et dure (in which a person is pinned down and has heavy stones piled upon him). This is followed by the discovery of an elderly woman burnt at the stake in her back garden, and the team realize that someone is hunting and executing witches in Whitechapel.Written by actor Steve Pemberton (who plays Ed Buchan), the second case involves a grisy discovery of flayed skin in a museum, with a murderer who seems to take a certain interest in people who have eluded justice. Finally, the third case has the team in disarray as they uncover a disembodied corpse in the sewage tunnels. More are still to follow, with various organs removed, and it is Buchan who hesitantly suggests the possibility of cannibalism.But throughout all these episodes is a subtle thread that connects them all, one that takes season four into darker waters than anything we've previously seen. Early on, Chandler is approached by a rouge MI5 agent who insists that all the grisly crimes that take place in Whitechapel have been engineered by a ""provocateur"": a dark force that incites otherwise ordinary people to commit heinous acts against other men and women. Naturally Chandler dismisses this accusation, but the audience is privy to scenes of a recurring figure in the background of certain shots, a little old lady quietly watching and seemingly waiting as the team go about their business. She first appears at a book-signing for Buchan's new book, approaching each member of the team and engaging them in conversation that prys open their deepest fears.Like a spell has been placed upon them, all five members of the investigative team are beset by anxiety and paranoia, and it's only by pulling together and facing their fears that they have a chance to finally catch the perpetrators.Between this strain of the supernatural and the grisy nature of the cases, it can make for quite a harrowing viewing experience! Everything is designed to be as creepy and unsettling as possible, from the unexplained scar on an MI5 agent's neck, to the accurate predictions of a police psychic, to the growing sense of demonic powers at work throughout the station.Of course, some may not like this marked switch into the paranormal. If you were to watch this season immediately after the first, you'd find that it feels like a completely different show, and if there is one unnecessarily element, it's that this season really ramps up the grisliness. Whereas the first season was incredibly restrained in its depiction of death and murder, often implying rather than showing the results that serial killers left in their wake, season four has no qualms about giving the audience lengthy mortuary scenes, grisly slow-motion murder sequences, and plenty of slow-motion pans over blood and gore. Heck, even the bursting of a pus-filled blister is shot in extreme close-up. It gets a bit much sometimes and is certainly not for the squeamish.But I applaud the writers and producers for realizing that the show's initial premise (copy-cat killings) had a limited shelf-life and that they weren't afraid to take their storylines and characters into very different territory. Sadly, it would seem that this is to be the final season of ""Whitechapel"", with ITV declining to commission any further episodes.That it all ends on something of cliff-hanger may frustrate many, especially since the element of the paranormal (and more importantly, the team's *realization* of its existence) served to re-galvanise the show and promise a range of new supernaturally-themed cases for the future. Hopefully the Powers That Be will realize their mistake and at least give the writers a chance to wrap things up properly in one last mini-series. If it ends like this it'll be on a suitably eerie note, but there are still plenty of plot-threads left dangling, and the actors especially deserve some sense of closure on such compelling and likeable characters.Also keep in mind that this is a British show, so check the region of the DVDs before purchasing anything.",5,"""Someone's Hunting Witches in Whitechapel...""",1385510400,"11 27,

First I'll start with saying that this is a hard movie to watch. While it is a little slow moving in some spots it also has some pretty intense scenes of torture. Most of it happens off screen but there is enough shown to make you cringe. I was looking forward to seeing this because I have liked the movies like this in the past. Munich I think was the best &#34;revenge confrontation&#34; movie even though it technically wasn't about the war aspect. Debt was also very good but was a little slower and had more of a psychological aspect to it. This one continues the trend away from straight &#34;I'll kill you&#34; to let's talk first type. This movie is good and worth watching but it does drag in a few parts but the last half hour is great and is really the reason to watch. The entire time you hope Eric gets the revenge he wants but when the time comes you start to second guess what you want for him. The fact that this is a true story really makes this more powerful. Overall, a movie that is good and worth watching but be prepared to struggle for a little while, the last half hour is worth the wait though.
