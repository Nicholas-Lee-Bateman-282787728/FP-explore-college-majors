However most people have only a superficial awareness of her (Hollywood Madam, Charlie Sheen). This documentary updates us on what Heidi is doing today and offers a rare look into her private life akin to today's reality TV shows. Found her idea of starting a Stud Farm for female clients only to be an unusual idea (albeit the fact it hasn't been done before might be cautionary). It was interesting to see that she arose from a nice middle class home and had no particular traumatic events that drove her into her chosen profession (more a matter of chance).",4,Interesting Perspective on Human Nature,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,637,"['Heidi', 'Fleiss', 'household', 'name', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'early', '90', 'However', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'only', 'superficial', 'awareness', 'Hollywood', 'Madam', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'documentary', 'what', 'Heidi', 'doing', 'today', 'rare', 'look', 'private', 'life', 'akin', 'today', 'reality', 'TV', 'shows', 'idea', 'starting', 'Stud', 'Farm', 'female', 'clients', 'only', 'be', 'unusual', 'idea', 'fact', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'might', 'be', 'cautionary', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'arose', 'nice', 'middle', 'class', 'home', 'had', 'particular', 'traumatic', 'events', 'drove', 'chosen', 'profession', 'more', 'matter', 'chance']",Heidi Fleiss: The Would-Be Madam of Crystal

This documentary focues on the post-jail Heidi's attempt to open a legal Nevada brothel, called the ""Stud Farm"", which would provide male prostitutes for female customers.Prior to her becoming incarcerated, I saw Heidi appear on Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect"" and she seemed to be a reasonably intelligent and lucid woman. But the Heidi featured in this doc comes across as a drug addled lunatic. She admits to be addicted to crystal meth and seems to be suffering from some sort of mental illness, perhaps bi-polar.Meanwhile, local opposition and political regulations prevent her from opening up the ""Stud Farm"". But, by the end, I began to wonder if this was a serious business proposal on her part or just a desperate cry for public attention. The laughable product description says this is ""one woman's struggle to keep her dream alive"". But Heidi's ""dream"" is clearly just a delusion and she comes across as sad and pathetic rather than heroic. The doc might maintain some viewers's interest in the same way that people stop to watch a car wreck. But really there is not much worth seeing here.",2,A Portrait In Lunacy,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1241,"['Heidi', 'Fleiss', 'first', 'gained', 'fame', 'Hollywood', 'madam', 'stars', 'was', 'busted', 'tax', 'evasion', 'served', 'several', 'years', 'prison', 'documentary', 'focues', 'post-jail', 'Heidi', 'attempt', 'open', 'legal', 'Nevada', 'brothel', 'called', 'Stud', 'Farm', 'would', 'provide', 'male', 'prostitutes', 'female', 'customers.Prior', 'becoming', 'incarcerated', 'saw', 'Heidi', 'appear', 'Bill', 'Maher', 'Politically', 'Incorrect', 'seemed', 'be', 'reasonably', 'intelligent', 'lucid', 'woman', 'Heidi', 'featured', 'doc', 'across', 'drug', 'addled', 'lunatic', 'be', 'addicted', 'crystal', 'meth', 'be', 'suffering', 'sort', 'mental', 'illness', 'perhaps', 'bi-polar.Meanwhile', 'local', 'opposition', 'political', 'regulations', 'prevent', 'opening', 'up', 'Stud', 'Farm', 'end', 'began', 'wonder', 'was', 'serious', 'business', 'proposal', 'part', 'just', 'desperate', 'cry', 'public', 'attention', 'laughable', 'product', 'description', 'one', 'woman', 'struggle', 'keep', 'dream', 'alive', 'Heidi', 'dream', 'clearly', 'just', 'delusion', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'rather', 'heroic', 'doc', 'might', 'maintain', 'viewers', 'interest', 'same', 'way', 'people', 'stop', 'watch', 'car', 'wreck', 'really', 'not', 'much', 'seeing', 'here']",Heidi Fleiss: The Would-Be Madam of Crystal
