She was a wonderful young Iroquois/Mohawk woman who listened to the Blackrobes (the French missionary priests) and fell in love with Jesus and spent the rest of her life living out the Gospel. She had to escape from her environment to be able to live as her heart yearned, and she came to a community of Native Americans who had been baptized like her and had left their environments and lived in a place which is now part of New York. She is the first native American to be canonized.

It is really difficult to give it a rating..... the problem I have with this movie is the drum and music in the background is so loud I can't hear what anyone is saying!! Maybe I need a hearing aid but this was really terrible! From the little I was able to hear it sounded great.,3,What?,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",2013,414,"['really', 'have', 'special', 'devotion', 'St.Kateri', 'was', 'hoping', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'compliment', 'reading', 'have', 'done', 'really', 'difficult', 'give', 'rating', 'problem', 'have', 'movie', 'drum', 'music', 'background', 'so', 'loud', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'what', 'anyone', 'saying', 'Maybe', 'need', 'hearing', 'aid', 'was', 'really', 'terrible', 'little', 'was', 'able', 'hear', 'sounded', 'great']",In Her Footsteps:The Story of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha
