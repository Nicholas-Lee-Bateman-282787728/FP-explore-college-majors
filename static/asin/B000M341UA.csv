1043085,A2CL31ZUL0TQHP,B000M341UA,"Biff Fearless ""World Reknowned Adventurer""","[11, 12]","I picked this movie up because I love westerns. When the film started, I could tell I was in trouble as the production values seemed to be lacking and some wooden dialogue delivered during the stagecoach hold-up. Once I accepted the level of feature I was watching, I adjusted my expectations and tried to accept Hell to Pay for the low budget 60s or 70s TV western that it really is. There are some good action scenes in the film, and the old western town is authentic (there is a nice bonus feature on the DVD regarding the classic western back-lots). Lee Majors was billed as a co-star in Hell to Pay, but he really only makes a cameo. See it if you are a true oaterphile, but I can't recommend it to anyone else.",2,Hell to pay.... hard to watch,1181692800,"06 13, 2007",2007,716,"['picked', 'movie', 'up', 'love', 'westerns', 'When', 'film', 'started', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'trouble', 'production', 'values', 'seemed', 'be', 'lacking', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'delivered', 'stagecoach', 'hold-up', 'accepted', 'level', 'feature', 'was', 'watching', 'adjusted', 'expectations', 'tried', 'accept', 'Hell', 'Pay', 'low', 'budget', '60s', '70s', 'TV', 'western', 'really', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'old', 'western', 'town', 'authentic', 'nice', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'regarding', 'classic', 'western', 'back-lots', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'was', 'billed', 'co-star', 'Hell', 'Pay', 'really', 'only', 'cameo', 'See', 'are', 'true', 'oaterphile', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else']",Hell to Pay
