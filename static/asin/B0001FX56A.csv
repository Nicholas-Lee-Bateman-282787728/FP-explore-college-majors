Hill,"[0, 0]","This is really one of the cutest movies ever..with live birds of all kinds doing the most amazing things in a script that makes their ""bird town"" come alive.  Children will love it, and adults who have, or want, a pet bird will also enjoy it.The people who trained these birds should've gotten an academy award for sheer genius and patience.  There is absolutely nothing objectionable about any part of this film, every secondd is a pure gem of film making.  I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't too ""grown up"" to enjoy fantasy.",5,Too Cute to Believe Possible!!!,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,533,"['really', 'one', 'cutest', 'movies', 'ever..with', 'live', 'birds', 'kinds', 'doing', 'most', 'amazing', 'things', 'script', 'bird', 'town', 'come', 'alive', 'Children', 'will', 'love', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'want', 'pet', 'bird', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'it.The', 'people', 'who', 'trained', 'birds', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'academy', 'award', 'sheer', 'genius', 'patience', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'part', 'film', 'secondd', 'pure', 'gem', 'film', 'making', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'too', 'grown', 'up', 'enjoy', 'fantasy']",Bill and Coo
803957,A156UQ1EAYVG0T,B0001FX56A,Lady Bug,"[0, 0]",I first saw Bill & Coo several years late one night and taped it from TV many years ago. I came across the video when I was in the process of transfering my home videos to DVD. It wasn't in very good condition so I came online hoping it would be here on DVD. Though I couldn't find it on DVD I did find it on VHS and ordered it anyway.This is one classic hit that NEEDS to be restored if possible. You certainly don't see things like this today in the animated and computer generated videos. This is true talent and should be preserved as the award winner it is!The video may not be in A+ condition but it's still highly enjoyable for all.,5,"AN AMAZING FEAT OF TRAINING, A CLASSIC HIT",1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,639,"['first', 'saw', 'Bill', 'Coo', 'several', 'years', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'taped', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'video', 'when', 'was', 'process', 'transfering', 'home', 'videos', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'condition', 'came', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'here', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'DVD', 'did', 'find', 'VHS', 'ordered', 'one', 'classic', 'hit', 'be', 'restored', 'possible', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'things', 'today', 'animated', 'computer', 'generated', 'videos', 'true', 'talent', 'should', 'be', 'preserved', 'award', 'winner', 'video', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'A+', 'condition', 'still', 'highly', 'enjoyable']",Bill and Coo

I fell in love with it immediately!  In the late 1980s I purchased a VHS tape of the movie and had my hubby see it too.  At the time we had 2 parakeets and they watched it with great interest.  I just got the dvd a few days ago and watched it with great delight.  I'm an animal lover, especially birds, and it was refreshing to see something that did not smack of violence or crude language. I am purchasing another dvd for the granddaughter of a friend of mine.  I hope she loves it too!Although the quality of the movie was never really clear; Ken Murray used his own home movie camera; it still conveys a sweet innocence of a bygone era.",5,Bill and Coo,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",2012,738,"['still', 'love', 'movie', 'day', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'Bill', 'Coo', 'early', '1960s', 'TV', 'fell', 'love', 'immediately', 'late', '1980s', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'tape', 'movie', 'had', 'hubby', 'see', 'too', 'time', 'had', '2', 'parakeets', 'watched', 'great', 'interest', 'just', 'got', 'dvd', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'watched', 'great', 'delight', ""'m"", 'animal', 'lover', 'especially', 'birds', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'smack', 'violence', 'crude', 'language', 'am', 'purchasing', 'dvd', 'granddaughter', 'friend', 'mine', 'hope', 'too', 'quality', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'clear', 'Ken', 'Murray', 'used', 'own', 'home', 'movie', 'camera', 'still', 'sweet', 'innocence', 'bygone', 'era']",Bill and Coo

I missed the showing, so went to Amazon and picked it up.This film is completely eye-opening and completely charming. I know it's a kids movie but I think most grown-ups would enjoy seeing it, just because it must have taken the film-makers years to get the birds to perform as well as they do. (Of course, these birds may have been so well-trained that they did it all on the first take!)My only regret is that it appears that the VHS copies now in circulation were duplicated from an old old print. This print is by no means unwatchable, but gets very dark during the crucial fire-rescue scene.
