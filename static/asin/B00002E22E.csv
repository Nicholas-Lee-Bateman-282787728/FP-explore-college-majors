514278,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00002E22E,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","I state the obvious in my title for a reason; for it is films like this that open your eyes to a very ugly side of life and humanity and kind of make you cringe inside at the very thought of belonging to the same species as some of these people.  I know that that may sound harsh, but I dare you to watch this harrowing film and not find yourself thinking the same way.  I couldn't help but close my eyes in agony during sections of this film, my wife gasping as we took in everything that this poor family had to suffer and endure; to no fault of their own besides maybe a poor decision that should have never been held over their heads.`Evil Angels' (or `A Cry in the Dark' here in the states) tells the heartbreaking true story of the Chamberlain family who lost their young daughter while camping in the Australian outback.  In the middle of the night a dingo snuck into the tent in which their 10-week old daughter Azaria was sleeping and ran off with her.  A search was started yet her body was never found, and when the search was ended the witch-hunt began as the community and the media launched an all out attack on the family, especially the mother Lindy, trying to pin her down for the murder of her child.You think that the worst thing that can happen to a parent is to lose a child; but that pain seems minimal when you find yourself accused of taking their life.`Evil Angels' recounts the court proceedings that followed the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain as her family is tormented and persecuted and mercilessly attacked by everyone around them.  It is true that we live in a world where young children are killed and or abused daily, and many times by a parent, but we also live in a world where you are supposed to remain innocent until proven guilty, and no guilt was every proven against Lindy or Michael Chamberlain, which makes their treatment all the more devastating.Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are superb as the crushed souls known as Michael and Lindy Chamberlain.  They each dominate their characters, truly sinking into the thoughts and actions and wreckage that comes from this unforeseen situation.  Neill embodies Michael with such sympathy and pain; his eyes bleeding with this uncomfortable sadness that scratches at his heart.  As the court proceedings carry on and his relationship with Lindy becomes strained you can really see that he is trying to understand what is happening to him, but his mind can't grasp it; or maybe it doesn't want to.  Meryl Streep is a revelation as Lindy.  Lindy deals with her situation in stark contrast to her husband, forcing herself to find humor in her treatment to deaden the pain; but when she takes the stand and her countenance falls and she starts to crumble you begin to understand that she is not as cold as she appears.You realize just how badly she has been damaged by the actions of everyone around her.`Evil Angels' is a very hard film to stomach.  It reminds me much of `The Crucible' in that both films (true life accounts mind you) expose the cruelty and inhumane ways of humans in desperate situations.  Through both films I felt this heat within my veins that boiled into full-fledged anger and frustration in people.  Maybe it's because I am a parent, but even if I were not I still feel as if this film would have wounded me so-to-speak.  The script, actors, direction and mere tone of the film only help to elevate the inevitable devastation, to such a degree that the ending solace seems more token and less gratifying.This film is superb.",5,"Sadly, this is a true story...",1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,3534,"['state', 'obvious', 'title', 'reason', 'films', 'eyes', 'very', 'ugly', 'side', 'life', 'humanity', 'kind', 'make', 'cringe', 'inside', 'very', 'thought', 'belonging', 'same', 'species', 'people', 'know', 'may', 'sound', 'harsh', 'dare', 'watch', 'harrowing', 'film', 'not', 'find', 'thinking', 'same', 'way', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'close', 'eyes', 'agony', 'sections', 'film', 'wife', 'gasping', 'took', 'everything', 'poor', 'family', 'had', 'suffer', 'endure', 'fault', 'own', 'besides', 'maybe', 'poor', 'decision', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'held', 'over', 'heads.', 'Evil', 'Angels', 'Cry', 'Dark', 'here', 'states', 'heartbreaking', 'true', 'story', 'Chamberlain', 'family', 'who', 'lost', 'young', 'daughter', 'camping', 'Australian', 'outback', 'middle', 'night', 'dingo', 'snuck', 'tent', '10-week', 'old', 'daughter', 'Azaria', 'was', 'sleeping', 'ran', 'off', 'search', 'was', 'started', 'yet', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'when', 'search', 'was', 'ended', 'witch-hunt', 'began', 'community', 'media', 'launched', 'out', 'attack', 'family', 'especially', 'mother', 'Lindy', 'trying', 'pin', 'down', 'murder', 'child.You', 'think', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'parent', 'lose', 'child', 'pain', 'minimal', 'when', 'find', 'accused', 'taking', 'life.', 'Evil', 'Angels', 'recounts', 'court', 'followed', 'disappearance', 'Azaria', 'Chamberlain', 'family', 'tormented', 'persecuted', 'mercilessly', 'attacked', 'everyone', 'true', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'young', 'children', 'are', 'killed', 'abused', 'daily', 'many', 'times', 'parent', 'also', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'remain', 'innocent', 'proven', 'guilty', 'guilt', 'was', 'proven', 'Lindy', 'Michael', 'Chamberlain', 'treatment', 'more', 'devastating.Sam', 'Neill', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'are', 'superb', 'crushed', 'souls', 'known', 'Michael', 'Lindy', 'Chamberlain', 'dominate', 'characters', 'truly', 'sinking', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'wreckage', 'unforeseen', 'situation', 'Neill', 'Michael', 'such', 'sympathy', 'pain', 'eyes', 'bleeding', 'uncomfortable', 'sadness', 'heart', 'court', 'proceedings', 'carry', 'relationship', 'Lindy', 'becomes', 'strained', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'mind', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'want', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'revelation', 'Lindy', 'Lindy', 'deals', 'situation', 'stark', 'contrast', 'husband', 'forcing', 'find', 'humor', 'treatment', 'deaden', 'pain', 'when', 'stand', 'countenance', 'falls', 'crumble', 'begin', 'understand', 'not', 'as', 'cold', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'been', 'damaged', 'actions', 'everyone', 'her.', 'Evil', 'Angels', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'stomach', 'much', 'Crucible', 'films', 'true', 'life', 'accounts', 'expose', 'cruelty', 'inhumane', 'ways', 'humans', 'desperate', 'situations', 'films', 'felt', 'heat', 'veins', 'boiled', 'full-fledged', 'anger', 'frustration', 'people', 'Maybe', 'am', 'parent', 'even', 'were', 'not', 'still', 'feel', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'wounded', 'so-to-speak', 'script', 'actors', 'direction', 'mere', 'tone', 'film', 'only', 'help', 'elevate', 'inevitable', 'devastation', 'degree', 'ending', 'solace', 'more', 'token', 'less', 'gratifying.This', 'film', 'superb']",A Cry in the Dark

514286,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00002E22E,Darren,"[0, 0]","Forty years ago, Bob Dylan came up with a clever term for the stupid and venal Press we all must endure, comparing them to an &#34;idiot wind&#34;.  This movie dramatizes, mostly successfully, what happened when that idiot wind blew Down Under and how a continent became consumed with the Chamberlain case.For those who don't know, the Chamberlain case centered around the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain at the Ayers Rock campground in 1980.  What happened is that a dingo came into the Chamberlain's tent and took the baby out while the family was having dinner.  The result was that the bewildered and grieving parents, Michael and Lindy Chamberlain (Sam Neill and Meryl Streep), had to deal with not only the loss of their baby daughter but also with the interest of the police and the Press, and before they knew it, they were considered complicit in the baby's death by a ravening media and a consequently ill-informed Australian public.  &#34;A Cry in the Dark&#34; teaches us several things.  First thing: don't feed wild animals; they get rather cocky and familiar and lose their natural fear of us, and the results can become tragic.  Second thing: the Press are not your friend; you can't control the flow of information that they receive, you can't shape the narrative that they deliver, and their interests are not your interests -- in fact, their interests are almost always diametrically opposed to yours.  At one point, Streep tries to &#34;fix the problem&#34; by agreeing to a televised interview in which she hopes to clear up misconceptions about their story, but it only makes the Chamberlain's situation worse.  Of course, the &#34;problem&#34; had already been exacerbated by an interview she had previously consented to with the &#34;Womans Day&#34; magazine, in which the interviewer smoothly tells Streep, &#34;I'm a mother too&#34;.  Oh how smooth they are!  All of which brings up Second Thing, Sub-paragraph A: always, always, always let your lawyer handle the media.  Third Thing: keep your opinions to yourself; in fact, don't even BE yourself -- put on a performance for the court and the media.  The Chamberlains already had a strike against them just by belonging to a small Christian sect, the Seventh-Day Adventists (well, certainly small in Australia, it would appear).  I know nothing about these folks, but if this movie is any guide, they're fond of grand gestures like sudden bouts of public prayer and passing small coffins (!) through their congregations, asking folks to toss in their cigarette packs and pipes as a gesture of promising to quit smoking.  (You can imagine what the Press did with this item.)  They also don't drink -- not a welcome quirk in Australia, and further proof of weirdness, weirdness that might lead to ritual sacrifice of babies.  But more than all that, Streep discovers that her utter contempt for the police and the Press gets wholeheartedly reciprocated by those institutions, with the result that she ends up in the dock and, inconceivably, and despite the warnings of several judges (the only people who come out looking like reasonable human beings in this mess, by the way), convicted of murder.  The public looked at her &#34;cult&#34; religion, her sour face, her &#34;Beatles For Sale&#34;-era John Lennon haircut, and even her sexiness (DESPITE the haircut), put it all together and said: &#34;Guilty&#34;.  Of course, it was all overturned later, as baby Azaria's clothes were found near Ayers Rock some time later, and Lindy Chamberlain was freed.  In fact, there was even more forensic evidence released just a few months ago that scientifically proved Chamberlain's innocence.  Proud of yourselves, Australians?Director Fred Schepisi mostly makes all this work via the agency of terrific performances from Streep and Neill.  A couple of faults prevent this from being a great movie: Schepisi, I feel, takes the temperature of the &#34;man-on-the-street&#34; too many times.  In one scene, a pair of guys get in a fistfight over the Chamberlain coverage. (Really?)  I think all this can be assumed by the nature of the story without literal representation.  Also, I feel Schepisi wants to say something concrete about the agenda of what appear to be a stupid and vengeful Northern Territory constabulary, but he doesn't quite get there, leaving it implied.  This is a loss of nerve in what is otherwise a clarion call against injustice.4 out of 5 stars.  One last thing about Streep: I researched some contemporary reviews of her work here, and found them to be pretty positive, but that doesn't quite jibe with my memories after this was released.  There was a period in the Eighties, sometime after &#34;Out of Africa&#34;, when I think people wearied of Streep and her endlessly consecutive and remorseless brilliance.  People were tired of her pitch-perfect accents, her woman-against-the-world roles, her awards.  There was the sense that she needed to be knocked down a peg.  She was becoming, in fact, the Lindy Chamberlain of Major Hollywood Female Actors.  Quite wisely, she took it easy after this movie, finally appearing in comedies like &#34;Defending Your Life&#34; and &#34;Death Becomes Her&#34; in the early Nineties.  At some point, people forgave her for her genius, and she gradually became that Grand Lady at the Academy Awards whom young actresses, fractionally as talented, adoringly looked down at from the stage while receiving their Oscars, faux-crying and cooling their faces with their rapidly fanning fingers.  Cut to: Streep smiling serenely.  All of which only goes to show that the American public is just as fickle as the Australian public,",4,Idiot wind,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,5668,"['Forty', 'years', 'ago', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'came',

514287,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00002E22E,David Anderson,"[12, 14]","&quot;Cry In the Dark&quot; is based on a true story about a disappearing baby.  The mother maintains her claim that a dingo carried her baby daughter through the woods and killed her.  As the country listens, rumors circulate that she killed her baby.  The family either stays tighter knit or almost separates.  Much drama occurs during the turmoil of losing a family member and being called the antichrist.  Regardless of what's said in interviews, no one listens.Meryl Streep deserved her eighth Oscar nomination for Best Actress as the accused mother.  Streep gives much of her own nightmare thoughts into the screen.  Just her expressed emotions are enough to give the audience chills while causing them to almost cry.  Sam Neill gives the best performance of his career as the accusee's husband.  All 350 acting extras also give great performance.The writers greatly informed the audience of the real events.

But I appreciate that the director was trying to stay faithful to the original (true), story so this aspect as never bothered me (and I have viewed this film repeatedly over the years).If you have not seen A Cry in the Dark, you must -- for the stunning photography of Ayers Rock in Australia (an amazing natural landform), for the incredible acting by Meryl Streep and Sam Neill, and -- of course -- for the shocking reality of how their characters suffered for society's irrational prejudices, biases and misdeeds.  It is my opinion that the public at large did not want to believe wild dingoes posed the horrific danger to young children they clearly did, and so they turned a blind eye to the obvious facts about Azaria Chamberlain's demise.

However, the  film focuses attention on the power of the media and the harm of  &quot;speculation&quot;.

Ask most Americans what they think of those  two and many of them would agree with that opinion, and thus confirming K's  invaluable statement in the bubblegum film Men in Black, and I'm  paraphrasing here &quot;The individual is smart, but people as a whole are  dumb,stupid and hysterical.&quot; This film is about that hysteria, about  how the public can judge, try and convict complete strangers. Many reviews  of A CRY IN THE DARK call it an attack on the media, but that completely  misses the mark. As Jerry Lewis said in a recent interview &quot;If you're  looking for a heavy in the piece, then its the people who buy the magazines  and watch the shows&quot;. If you're one of those sad people who obsess on  freak show cases like the O.J. Simpson case or the Jon Benet Ramsey case,  then this film is an attack on you.Fred Schepisi's film derives its  power from its absolute realism. He does'nt attempt fancy camera-work but  instead focuses on the anguish and heartbreak brought on the accused  parents, played brilliantly by Sam Neill and Merl Streep. He opens the film  with a shot of the barren and oppressive Australian outback, immediately  thereafter he gives domestic scenes in the Chamberlain household. They are  a picturesque family with faces that beam of happiness and satisfaction as  they plan to take a trip to the outback, it is there that their youngest  daughter Ezaria is stolen and killed by an Australian wild dog named the  Dingo. All the initial public sympathy for the parents evaporates, and  vicious gossip spreads across the country. Since people usually assume the  worst of what they don't understand, they assume that the couple's church  the Seventh-Day Adventists requires ritual sacrifices, wild rumours ensue  as the one claiming the name Ezaria to mean &quot;sacrifice in the  wilderness&quot;. As Lindy's father quiet eloquently puts it &quot;The lies  go round the world while the truth is still putting its boots on.&quot;The most important piece of eveidence that convicted Lindy in the  public's mind was her unwillingness to act the role of what they precieved  to be a &quot;normal&quot; grieving mother. As played by Merly Streep in  arguably her best performance, she is a woman unwilling to censor herself,  to play the part. The couple's blind faith equips them to cope with the  tragedy to an extent no member of the public could ever comprehend. Sam  Neill as Michael is equally good in a more understated performance as a man  who has his faith severely tested.Fred Schepisi is one of the most  erratic directors in cinema. I haven't seen all his films, but THE CHANT OF  JIMMIE BLACKSMITH 1978 is one of the most brutal and powerful films I have  ever seen. How he can go from films like that one and A CRY IN THE DARK to  I.Q. and Fierce Creautres is beyond me. I suppose even the great ones run  out of steam sometime. However, his accomplishment here is undeniable, he  manages to do what Oliver Stone failed to do in his overwrought mess  Natural Born Killers, he shows how a judgemental fickle public can destroy  real lives.As effective as this film is, it isn't perfect. The visual  style enhances realism, therefore there is no poetry to the tragedy as  there was in Atom Egoyan masterful THE SWEET HEREAFTER. I recognise that  style wasn't what Schepisi was aiming for, but its lack makes re-watching  the film a second time a less enticing prospect. Still, I higly reccomend  that you see this film at least once, and next time you find yourself  debating the guilt or innocence of strangers, remember this film and take a  long hard look in the mirror.",4,Hysteria,958608000,"05 18, 2000",2000,3800,"['American', 'public', 'just', 'chosen', 'George', 'Bush', 'Al', 'Gore', 'finalists', '2000', 'Presidential', 'race', 'two', 'robotic', 'creatures', 'only', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'human', 'beings', 'Ask', 'most', 'Americans', 'what', 'think', 'two', 'many', 'would', 'agree', 'opinion', 'thus', 'confirming', 'K', 'invaluable', 'statement', 'bubblegum', 'film', 'Men', 'Black', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'here', 'quot', 'individual', 'smart', 'people', 'whole', 'are', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'hysterical.', 'quot', 'film', 'hysteria', 'how', 'public', 'can', 'judge', 'try', 'convict', 'complete', 'strangers', 'Many', 'reviews', 'A', 'CRY', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'call', 'attack', 'media', 'completely', 'mark', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'said', 'recent', 'interview', 'quot', ""'re"", 'looking', 'heavy', 'piece', 'then', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'magazines', 'watch', 'shows', 'quot', ""'re"", 'one', 'sad', 'people', 'who', 'obsess', 'freak', 'show', 'cases', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'case', 'Jon', 'Benet', 'Ramsey', 'case', 'then', 'film', 'attack', 'you.Fred', 'Schepisi', 'film', 'power', 'absolute', 'realism', ""does'nt"", 'attempt', 'fancy', 'camera-work', 'instead', 'focuses', 'anguish', 'heartbreak', 'brought', 'accused', 'parents', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Merl', 'Streep', 'film', 'shot', 'barren', 'oppressive', 'Australian', 'outback', 'immediately', 'thereafter', 'domestic', 'scenes', 'Chamberlain', 'household', 'are', 'picturesque', 'family', 'beam', 'happiness', 'satisfaction', 'plan', 'take', 'trip', 'outback', 'there', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Ezaria', 'stolen', 'killed', 'Australian', 'wild', 'dog', 'named', 'Dingo', 'initial', 'public', 'sympathy', 'parents', 'vicious', 'gossip', 'spreads', 'country', 'people', 'usually', 'assume', 'worst', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'assume', 'couple', 'church', 'Seventh-Day', 'Adventists', 'ritual', 'sacrifices', 'wild', 'rumours', 'ensue', 'one', 'claiming', 'name', 'Ezaria', 'mean', 'quot', 'sacrifice', 'wilderness', 'quot', 'Lindy', 'father', 'quiet', 'eloquently', 'quot', 'lies', 'go', 'world', 'truth', 'still', 'putting', 'boots', 'on.', 'quot', 'most', 'important', 'piece', 'eveidence', 'convicted', 'Lindy', 'public', 'mind', 'was', 'unwillingness', 'act', 'role', 'what', 'precieved', 'be', 'quot', 'normal', 'quot', 'grieving', 'mother', 'played', 'Merly', 'Streep', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'woman', 'unwilling', 'censor', 'play', 'part', 'couple', 'blind', 'faith', 'cope', 'tragedy', 'extent', 'member', 'public', 'could', 'ever', 'comprehend', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'Michael', 'equally', 'good', 'more', 'understated', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'faith', 'severely', 'tested.Fred', 'Schepisi', 'one', 'most', 'erratic', 'directors', 'cinema', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'films', 'THE', 'CHANT', 'OF', 'JIMMIE', 'BLACKSMITH', '1978', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'powerful', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'films', 'one', 'CRY', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'I.Q', 'Fierce', 'Creautres', 'suppose', 'even', 'great', 'ones', 'run', 'steam', 'sometime', 'However', 'accomplishment', 'here', 'undeniable', 'do', 'what', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'failed', 'do', 'overwrought', 'mess', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'how', 'judgemental', 'fickle', 'public', 'can', 'destroy', 'real', 'lives.As', 'effective', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'visual', 'style', 'enhances', 'realism', 'therefore', 'poetry', 'tragedy', 'was', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'masterful', 'THE', 'SWEET', 'HEREAFTER', 'recognise', 'style', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Schepisi', 'was', 'aiming', 'lack', 're-watching', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'less', 'enticing', 'prospect', 'Still', 'higly', 'reccomend', 'see', 'film', 'least', 'once', 'next', 'time', 'find', 'debating', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'strangers', 'remember', 'film', 'take', 'long', 'hard', 'look', 'mirror']",A Cry in the Dark

The story is incredible and if it had not actually happened, no one would believe it.  Meryl Streep is superb as the young wife of a Seventh Day Adventist minister in Australia, who, on a camping trip, sees a wild dingo carry off her baby.  As if that weren't enough, she is accused of killing the child.Steep plays the woman brilliantly.  At first she is the sweet and demure young minister's wife, full of love for her family.  As the horror of her predicament unfolds we see her change into a woman of steel.  Due to an excellent script and Streeps fine acting, the character is totally believable through all of the twists and turns of her fate.Sam Neill is her equal in this performance as the deeply religious man whose faith is questioned by the event.What is most shocking is the rabid attention the public paid to the case and their blood thirst for Lindy's head. Insult is piled on injury on this poor family, and it seems that much of the reason for it is the fact that they were members of the Seventh Day Adventist faith.It's a cautionary tale for everyone.

514306,A3LPQAPU2ILDD0,B00002E22E,R. McRae,"[5, 5]","Goes to show how far a little prejudice will go. After warnings that Dingos were becoming a dangerous problem at Ayer's Rock, baby Azaria's tragic death was bound to happen to someone's child sooner or later. Unfortunately, many didn't realize just how powerful an animal the Dingo is. Like many here in the U.S. don't realize the dangers of our even smaller Coyote. And unfortunately for the Chamberlain family, smaller minority churches like their membership in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, made them subjects of suspicion and rumors. Their marriage was eventually destroyed over this crisis.This film portrayed so well, how a little gossip and stereotyping can explode into hatred. Little known to most even today, is that there was a large cover-up from law enforcement, down to members of the local community, who were aware that a well known local Dingo was responsible for Azaria's death. Yet, many still refuse to accept Lindy Chamberlain's total innocence of her baby's death. The average viewer of this film would be totally sickened by the full revelation of this tragic event.Meryl Streep's performance, is possibly the best movie portrayal of someone not actually born a native to the country of her character's origin. Her Australian accent is delivered to perfection. Very much worthy of the 8th Academy Award nomination she received. A strong argument for religious tolerance, and keeping cool heads till all the facts are in. And a great edition to any DVD collection, though some strong language for what essentially is a faith-based film may discourage some from viewing.The film's now well known line, ""the Dingo took my baby"" would not have the least hint of humor if heard in its true context.
