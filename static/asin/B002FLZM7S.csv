The title is actually perfect:  Minor Details.  This is a very minor film with very loose story-telling, the difference between well told decent literature and something just so-so.  At every level, films can be told well, produced well and clean up well.  This extends a 42 minute Disney hour into well over an hour and I couldn't wait for it to be through.  It did not hold my interest, the characters were sleepy characterizations and the story was solved before it began.",2,Tweens Solve a Mystery,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,622,"['extremely', 'light', 'weight', 'tween', 'film', 'four', 'girls', 'gather', 'solve', 'mystery', 'sick', 'kids', 'appearing', 'randomly', 'private', 'school', 'campus', 'title', 'actually', 'perfect', 'Minor', 'Details', 'very', 'minor', 'film', 'very', 'loose', 'story-telling', 'difference', 'well', 'told', 'decent', 'literature', 'something', 'just', 'so-so', 'level', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'well', 'produced', 'well', 'clean', 'up', 'well', '42', 'minute', 'Disney', 'hour', 'well', 'hour', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'interest', 'characters', 'were', 'sleepy', 'characterizations', 'story', 'was', 'solved', 'began']",Minor Details
