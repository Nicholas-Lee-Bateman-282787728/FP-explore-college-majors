Yates,"[0, 0]","I thought it was ok as a true Anegl's fan, worth having to get a glimpse or in some cases a one sided view point of what was going on behind the scenes of the cult classic tv show.  I am glad to have it but have only watched it once so not sure if I would have had to have it in my collection or if I could have streamed it once to see it and be done.  Would say choose what you feel knowing it is a fluff piece with some information you may not have known.

895189,A1V5QPOQUPZ663,B0007Y8AYC,Eric Larsen,"[4, 6]","If you are a true fan of Charlies Angels, this one is worth the money spent. The Actresses that played the original trio were very convincing with Kate being the best portrayed by Lauren Stammie, Christina Chambers as Jacylin, who did her voice really well, but the one who played Farrah, Trica Heffer had the look of Farrah, but that was about it. On the other hand , the way the original scienes from the first season were so horribly inacurate, it was sick. I am referring to the reinactment of the shower sciene from Angels in Chains. It was so far off the orginal it was not even funny. Another thing, is the way the movie potrayed David Doyle, which would make the real mcoy turn over in his grave and flip the bird. It made him look like a total bufoon. Oh and they forgot to mention the Jacyln Smith clothing line as one of her sucesses at the end of the flim. Ok other than those little indiscretions, i thought the movie was worth the price paid , and tells the story failry well, and period perfect to say the least, all in the flair and lime green disco atomsphere of the seventies.",3,Charlies Angels on Tv,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",2005,1094,"['are', 'true', 'fan', 'Charlies', 'Angels', 'one', 'money', 'spent', 'Actresses', 'played', 'original', 'trio', 'were', 'very', 'convincing', 'Kate', 'being', 'best', 'portrayed', 'Lauren', 'Stammie', 'Christina', 'Chambers', 'Jacylin', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'really', 'well', 'one', 'who', 'played', 'Farrah', 'Trica', 'Heffer', 'had', 'look', 'Farrah', 'was', 'other', 'hand', 'way', 'original', 'scienes', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'so', 'horribly', 'inacurate', 'was', 'sick', 'am', 'referring', 'reinactment', 'shower', 'sciene', 'Angels', 'Chains', 'was', 'so', 'far', 'orginal', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'thing', 'way', 'movie', 'potrayed', 'David', 'Doyle', 'would', 'make', 'real', 'mcoy', 'turn', 'over', 'grave', 'flip', 'bird', 'made', 'look', 'total', 'bufoon', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'mention', 'Jacyln', 'Smith', 'clothing', 'line', 'one', 'sucesses', 'end', 'flim', 'other', 'little', 'indiscretions', 'i', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'paid', 'story', 'failry', 'well', 'period', 'perfect', 'say', 'least', 'flair', 'lime', 'green', 'disco', 'atomsphere', 'seventies']",Behind the Camera - Charlie's Angels

895192,A34XBZD7ZNZSI5,B0007Y8AYC,TBo,"[29, 32]",While the book this was based on (Charlie's Angels Casebook) had some great insight on one of my all time favorite shows - the movie version does little to shed any real light on the coming and going of the Angels.  The recreation of David Doyles Bosley is a travesty and a true disservice to his memory.  Kate Jackson (although the most convincing played by any of the actresses)is a beer bottle guzzling hard ass.  No wonder Kate posted on her own website asking people to NOT watch this film when it originally aired on television.  Farrah was so upset by the movie and all of the presumptions made of her life at the time that she refuses to even discuss the film.  While all of these behind the scenes films are geared toward the lowest common denominator - This one reaches to the very bottom of the trash heap to entertain(?),1,even if you are a die hard fan this is hard to watch,1113177600,"04 11, 2005",2005,832,"['book', 'was', 'based', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Casebook', 'had', 'great', 'insight', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'version', 'little', 'shed', 'real', 'light', 'coming', 'going', 'Angels', 'recreation', 'David', 'Doyles', 'Bosley', 'travesty', 'true', 'disservice', 'memory', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'most', 'convincing', 'played', 'actresses', 'beer', 'bottle', 'guzzling', 'hard', 'ass', 'wonder', 'Kate', 'posted', 'own', 'website', 'asking', 'people', 'NOT', 'watch', 'film', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'television', 'Farrah', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'movie', 'presumptions', 'made', 'life', 'time', 'even', 'discuss', 'film', 'scenes', 'films', 'are', 'geared', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'one', 'very', 'bottom', 'trash', 'heap', 'entertain']",Behind the Camera - Charlie's Angels
895193,A65XH6L5BUX0X,B0007Y8AYC,"TheClassicsNut65 ""morgan miller""","[0, 0]","Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels is similar to the docudramas done on Dynasty, Three's Company, and Mork & Mindy: people who look like the stars (sometimes they don't even look like them) of said shows play them (most of who cannot act).This documentary-drama, behind-the-scenes look at Charlie's Angels has it definite ups and downs. A pro of the film is that the casting of Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith are accurate and intact. However, there is no mentioning to the casting of David Doyle, John Forsythe (who voiced Charlie), or the man that co-starred in the initial pilot. The episodes they show the &#34;actresses&#34; filming are not in order.To start things off, let's discuss the actresses playing Kate, Farrah, and Jaclyn. Well, Lauren Stamile looks a tad like Kate and sounds a lot like her; Tricia Helfer as Farrah does not really look or sound like the real woman; and Christina Chambers as Jaclyn sound like the real one, but looks a lot older than Jaclyn Smith did at the time. The actor portraying David Doyle and Aaron Spelling do not look or sound like them. Disappointing. Very disappointing.I know some people have complained about the emphasis of Farrah Fawcett, her marriage to Lee Majors, and her exit from the show within the film. It's understandable that Farrah would be mentioned a lot; she was (and still is) the most-popular Angel and everyone who grew up watching the show remembered her leaving. What I don't like is that their is only a small reference and appearance of (an actress as) Cheryl Ladd towards the end of the film, and that fact that neither Shelley Hack nor Tanya Roberts or even mentioned. Yes, it's known Shelley and Tanya weren't popular, then or now, but they were part of Charlie's Angels. Deal with it. The film goes off telling you Jaclyn stayed for all five seasons, Kate left after season three, and Farrah came back for six guest spots later on.This film was, in my opinion, too short and miscalculated. This is more for entertainment, not accuracy or for the die-hard fans. The film is more campy than factual and it does not (repeat does not) capture the magic or phenomenon that was Charlie's Angels. In fact, it fails miserably. This film is not a total loss, though. Those who like campy reenactments might find it cute, but those of whom are killer fans of the classic series, probably won't. Buy it, if you want, and decide for yourself.",3,"It's good, but definitely not great.",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2447,"['Camera', 'Unauthorized', 'Story', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'similar', 'docudramas', 'done', 'Dynasty', 'Three', 'Company', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'stars', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'said', 'shows', 'play', 'most', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'act', '.This', 'documentary-drama', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'definite', 'ups', 'downs', 'pro', 'film', 'casting', 'Kate', 'Jackson', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'are', 'accurate', 'intact', 'However', 'mentioning', 'casting', 'David', 'Doyle', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'who', 'voiced', 'Charlie', 'man', 'co-starred', 'initial', 'pilot', 'episodes', 'show', '34', 'actresses', '34', 'filming', 'are', 'not', 'order.To', 'start', 'things', 'off', 'let', 'discuss', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Kate', 'Farrah', 'Jaclyn', 'Well', 'Lauren', 'Stamile', 'tad', 'Kate', 'lot', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'Farrah', 'not', 'really', 'look', 'sound', 'real', 'woman', 'Christina', 'Chambers', 'Jaclyn', 'sound', 'real', 'one', 'lot', 'older', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'did', 'time', 'actor', 'portraying', 'David', 'Doyle', 'Aaron', 'Spelling', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'sound', 'Disappointing', 'Very', 'disappointing.I', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'emphasis', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'marriage', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'exit', 'show', 'film', 'understandable', 'Farrah', 'would', 'be', 'mentioned', 'lot', 'was', 'still', 'most-popular', 'Angel', 'everyone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'remembered', 'leaving', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'only', 'small', 'reference', 'appearance', 'actress', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'end', 'film', 'fact', 'Shelley', 'Hack', 'Tanya', 'Roberts', 'even', 'mentioned', 'Yes', 'known', 'Shelley', 'Tanya', 'were', ""n't"", 'popular', 'then', 'now', 'were', 'part', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Deal', 'film', 'off', 'telling', 'Jaclyn', 'stayed', 'five', 'seasons', 'Kate', 'left', 'season', 'three', 'Farrah', 'came', 'back', 'six', 'guest', 'spots', 'later', 'on.This', 'film', 'was', 'opinion', 'too', 'short', 'miscalculated', 'more', 'entertainment', 'not', 'accuracy', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'film', 'more', 'campy', 'factual', 'not', 'repeat', 'not', 'capture', 'magic', 'phenomenon', 'was', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'fact', 'miserably', 'film', 'not', 'total', 'loss', 'though', 'who', 'like', 'campy', 'reenactments', 'might', 'find', 'cute', 'whom', 'are', 'killer', 'fans', 'classic', 'series', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'want', 'decide']",Behind the Camera - Charlie's Angels
