565633,A3A6Y7MOWO3U5W,B000053VAP,"A. Pearson ""West Coast Ranter""","[7, 10]","Ellen Degeneres has her comedic, ""rambling"" approach down to an art form. Well, maybe I am over-shooting a bit...not an art form like maybe what Michelangelo, Picasso, Monet, or Fabio would do. I guess some would consider her stand-up to be comparable to the beautifully crafted, timeless paintings we see in the Sistine Chapel, but most of those comparisons are brought about by vodka or sharp blows to the head, so we should just ignore those.But, it could be compared to the works of other well respected artists likie...Vanilla Ice or an origami person (would that be an origamist or maybe an origaminator? I have no idea). Professional orgigami, though...not that stupid stuff they teach kids in school to get them to be creative using little colored squares on paper. That's easy to do. Nobody would consider that to be ""real"" art.I shouldn't say it's stupid, kids do have to learn. Like my cousin's daughter, Kaitlin, who needs to learn to use the ""big people's"" potty instead of those diapers. She's just a lovely girl, but you'd think at 13, she'd have learned by now. I guess we should over-look it, though, considering the ""accident"". Some people say it was my fault, but that's just silly because I was acquitted at trial and my lawyer says I have nothing to worry about anymore. He said just to ignore the death threats and the crank calls.Anyway, Ellen has rambling down to an art and this DVD is some of the best material she's ever brought forth. I just love the way she has perfect timing and her comedy doesn't have to be all vulgar and controversial like a lot of comedians, or like what my brother tries to do when he gets drunk and wears that funny hat and goes to karaoke. It's always fun when he does that until they call the police, because it's not really a karaoke bar...it's Wal-Mart and they have told him over and over and over to stay away, but even with that restraining order, he just comes right back.Kind of reminds me of when we were kids and my dad would drive him far, far away and then leave him. Somehow he always found his way home. I have no idea how he untied himself or got out of that trunk, but he did it! My dad was such a kidder that way. He was always playing funny jokes on us, like that time he tried to get me to eat the ""funny candy"". Yeah, right, dad! Like I'm going to fall for that one. I knew right away it was a urinal cake because of the funny smell and the way it just magically appeared after he came out of the public bathroom at the mall.He did fool me with the fake Kool-Aid, though. It was anti-freeze, but I just guzzled it right down. Oh, don't worry, I was fine...and those doctors in ICU were the best! Besides, kids are resiliant...you'd be surprised how fast a 5-year-old can recover from something like that. Yeah, I miss my dad, God rest his soul. He's not dead, but my mom is always saying that if he ever comes back to her door step, she'll kill him, so there you go.What was I saying? Oh, right! Ellen. This is one of my favorite DVDs.

She's so cute, and says the most outrageous things the way a pretty teenager might. This was eleven years ago, long before I'd even heard her name, so it was a revelation to me to see her early work.This was filmed about three years after she came out, and she started the show by mentioning that she had gone back and forth trying to decide whether she would talk about it or not. She finally decided she would not: instead she would express what the last three years had been like in interpretive dance. It worked. It was not only brilliant, but got across the ups and downs quite effectively.Most of the show was not about being gay, but about the common things in everyday life that can get weird just because you look at them from a unique angle. Like running out of cheese, or watching ants in single file.The last riff is about going to God's house for fondue and chablis. But that's not actually the end of the DVD.

565636,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000053VAP,Gregor von Kallahann,"[8, 8]","One of the first times I ever saw Ellen DeGeneres on TV, she was doing a routine about how ridiculous it was that people write ""(over)"" at the bottom of the first page of a letter--as if otherwise, the dumbfounded reader would say, ""Isn't that the darndest thing? She got to the bottom of the page and just stopped...""  I've loved her take on the absurdity of everyday life ever since.This 2000 tape has moments like that--the shampoo bit is priceless.  But she was moving beyond the everyday and into the socio-political. That's only to be expected, I guess, after coming out on network TV a few years before--and creating a media firestorm. (I've never actually been sure how significant it was for most people on an individual level, but the media certainly made hay of it.)  Inevitably, her return to stand-up would have to address her sexuality and the (real or manufacturerd?) frenzy surrounding it.And address it she does. The blow-up doll and the harness bit was a stitch.  Of course, I had to ask myself what it said about ME that for a moment, I thought, ""But wait, wasn't that her mom in the audience?""  Well, hey, if mom's OK with it, I guess I am too.The only question I do have is one that I see at least one other reviewer posted and subsequently receive ""0 helpful votes"" for--but it still bears posing (though Goddess knows how many unhelpfuls it'll garner me), namely: is this something you want to rent (or, like me, maybe borrow from the libary)? or is it a virtual MUST for every collection.Well, the answer is simple enough.  If like me, you like Ellen a whole lot, but don't see yourself watching it on a near daily basis for the next six months, you may want to just rent or borrow it.

Even moreso is that she was kind enough to have it taped for mere fans who could not see such an event in the flesh.  DeGeneres' whirlwind tour reminded Americans that she is more than a typecast lesbian, but a comedienne.  What she made herself known for before any tags were attached. The title The Beginning reminds just that.  She is a comedienne before anything else.  Since I'm not a lesbian I can say I am a fan for Ellen's comedy &amp; mothing more.  Yet I appreciate the humour she injects into being gay - see her interpretative dance relaying her coming out.  Very original &amp; painfully true.  The audience laps up her incisive wit &amp; DeGeneres enjoys herself, although at times appears to feel quite awkward.  If you have not discovered the brilliance of Ellen DeGeneres beyond Ellen (the TV Show) or the media frenzy behind her coming out, this DVD is a worthy acquisition.  Makes for a great night in.

The evening was wonderful and funny and joyous and everything you'd expect from Ellen. There was also a slight sense that something was a little off. I wondered was it the cameras? The media scrutiny? Now, in hindsight, was it personal? Anyway, from the second I got to the theater, where I started an ovation for her mom, all the way to the question &amp; answer section at the end, the evening was magical. I watched the special on HBO, and somehow in the editing and selection, the concert lost a little of the magic. I understand when other reviews comment on her timing and such. But I truly think that fault lies with the director and the editor. Anyway, the recording is an excellent document, if not a perfect one.

565650,A1RRPBF14VTAUE,B000053VAP,Tucker,"[1, 6]","As a fan of Ellen DeGeneres, I had high hopes for her return to the stage in her first stand-up comedy routine after a lengthy absence. Unfortunately, this first outing is a big disappointment.I first became familiar with DeGeneres in her early days as a stand-up comic and was immediately charmed by her self-deprecating style and wry humor. She has a talent for zeroing in on and lambasting life's absurdities with caustic, irreverent humor. Her &quot;phone call to God&quot; routine is a classic gem. Alas, her time away from the microphone is woefully apparent in this 60 minute (give or take) routine which never really manages to rise above mildly amusing. Like her television series, this routine tries hard but falls far short of it's mark.Degeneres opens her show with an inane interpretive dance routine (in reference to her coming out) which, to put it bluntly, is just plain dumb. From there, she touches on topics such as directions on a shampoo bottle, naked people, health food stores, losing your inner child, fashion, random thoughts and meeting God. At times you can see small sparks of the old DeGeneres in these bits (such as when she questions why are there directions on a shampoo bottle or the couple critiquing their lovemaking technique) but unfortunately, they are few and far between. Her trademark ramblings (and a large part of what makes her so funny) here just seem like.........well, rambling. The material presented here just doesn't have the intelligence that I've seen in past routines. Hopefully, like a muscle that needs to be continually trained to stay strong, DeGeneres will continue to work on her material, strengthening, sharpening and honing it so that her next show will be worthy of her undeniable talent.The DVD itself is somewhat of a disappointment as well. It offers no extras aside from a biography on DeGeneres. No behind the scenes documentary or &quot;making of&quot; featurette. No voice over commentary.
