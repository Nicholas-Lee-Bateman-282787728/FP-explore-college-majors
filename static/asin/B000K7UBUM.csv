1031275,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000K7UBUM,C. O. DeRiemer,"[26, 27]","Not much escapes Father Brown, a quiet Catholic priest in Twenties England. He saves souls and he catches murderers. In the stories by G. K. Chesterton, Father Brown uses his theology and quite a bit of metaphysics to come to conclusions about behavior, crime and people; Chesterton uses the device of Father Brown to be the reason for these discussions as crime is being solved. It's not a bad formula and many people are passionate fans of the humble English priest.When Lew Grade decided to make a TV mystery series out of the stories he had only one actor in mind for Father Brown, and that was Kenneth More. More wasn't so sure. It took a deal of persuading before More agreed. The result was 13 episodes of about 50 minutes each broadcast in 1974. What we have is a series of mysteries that move a little to fast for their own good; a lot gets packed into those 50 minutes. While most of the mysteries are interesting, there are a few clunkers...mysteries where the plot is simply unlikely or where only Father Brown could have possibly determined the villain. For those who enjoy philosophical disquisition on the ways of men and women, there's some of that, too. One drawback to the series is that there is no continuity except Kenneth More. Our priest simply pops up wherever a crime is being committed. He has no parish and seems to have no superiors who keep tabs on him. There is Flambeau, a former thief and good friend, who shows up now and then, but who doesn't add much to the proceedings. Occasionally we'll encounter an actor we know and like, such as Graham Crowden, Mel Martin, Oliver Ford Davis and Ronald Pickup in Set 1. For the most part, the actors are competent and anonymous. All this may sound like faint praise, but, at least in my opinion, the Father Brown mysteries don't reach the same level of interest as any number of other British TV mystery series do. Still, the series has one great plus...and that is Kenneth More.More was 60 when he played Father Brown. He'd paid his dues in the Forties, had a career of great success in the Fifties and then in the Sixties had difficulty finding good roles. He bounced back briefly with his superb performance as Jolyon 'Jo' Forsythe in the Forsythe Saga (1967), but after that it was a series of star cameos and roles in not-so-good movies. Those qualities that made him such a vivid and charismatic actor -- energy, confidence, charm -- aren't a perfect fit for Father Brown. His skill as an actor, however, carries him through. We may not be watching Father Brown but Kenneth More as Father Brown, and that's not bad. Even though More tones it down, sometimes twinkles and gives a thoughtful and humble portrayal, I can't help but see every know and then a gleam of amusement in More's eyes.For those who like the Father Brown stories, you may enjoy these mysteries. For those who admire Kenneth More, and I'm one of them, they're a good deal of fun. The DVD transfers are variable. The shows were produced in 1974 and have sharp interiors and poor exteriors. For the exterior scenes the picture can be a bit faded and too soft. This is not a great enough flaw to keep anyone from purchasing the set. One assumes that the second set of six episodes will become available soon.Another take on the mystery-solving priest is provided by Alec Guinness in the 1954 movie, Father Brown (titled The Detective for the U.S. release). It's an amusing duel of wits and belief between Father Brown and that classy thief, Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, with Joan Greenwood in delectable support. The movie is not out on DVD, but the VHS tape may still be available.",4,Let's bless Father Brown for giving that excellent actor Kenneth More a fine role,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,3632,"['Not', 'much', 'escapes', 'Father', 'Brown', 'quiet', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Twenties', 'England', 'souls', 'murderers', 'stories', 'G.', 'K.', 'Chesterton', 'Father', 'Brown', 'theology', 'quite', 'bit', 'metaphysics', 'come', 'conclusions', 'behavior', 'crime', 'people', 'Chesterton', 'device', 'Father', 'Brown', 'be', 'reason', 'discussions', 'crime', 'being', 'solved', 'not', 'bad', 'formula', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'passionate', 'fans', 'humble', 'English', 'priest.When', 'Lew', 'Grade', 'decided', 'make', 'TV', 'mystery', 'series', 'stories', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'actor', 'mind', 'Father', 'Brown', 'was', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'More', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'sure', 'took', 'deal', 'persuading', 'More', 'agreed', 'result', 'was', '13', 'episodes', '50', 'minutes', 'broadcast', '1974', 'What', 'have', 'series', 'mysteries', 'move', 'little', 'fast', 'own', 'good', 'lot', 'packed', '50', 'minutes', 'most', 'mysteries', 'are', 'interesting', 'are', 'few', 'clunkers', 'mysteries', 'where', 'plot', 'simply', 'unlikely', 'where', 'only', 'Father', 'Brown', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'determined', 'villain', 'who', 'enjoy', 'philosophical', 'disquisition', 'ways', 'men', 'women', 'too', 'One', 'drawback', 'series', 'continuity', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'priest', 'simply', 'up', 'wherever', 'crime', 'being', 'committed', 'parish', 'have', 'superiors', 'who', 'keep', 'tabs', 'Flambeau', 'former', 'thief', 'good', 'friend', 'who', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'who', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'proceedings', 'Occasionally', ""'ll"", 'encounter', 'actor', 'know', 'such', 'Graham', 'Crowden', 'Mel', 'Martin', 'Oliver', 'Ford', 'Davis', 'Ronald', 'Pickup', 'Set', '1', 'most', 'part', 'actors', 'are', 'competent', 'anonymous', 'may', 'sound', 'faint', 'praise', 'least', 'opinion', 'Father', 'Brown', 'mysteries', 'do', ""n't"", 'reach', 'same', 'level', 'interest', 'number', 'other', 'British', 'TV', 'mystery', 'series', 'do', 'Still', 'series', 'one', 'great', 'Kenneth', 'More.More', 'was', '60', 'when', 'played', 'Father', 'Brown', ""'d"", 'paid', 'dues', 'Forties', 'had', 'career', 'great', 'success', 'Fifties', 'then', 'Sixties', 'had', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'good', 'roles', 'bounced', 'back', 'briefly', 'superb', 'performance', 'Jolyon', ""'Jo"", 'Forsythe', 'Forsythe', 'Saga', '1967', 'was', 'series', 'star', 'cameos', 'roles', 'not-so-good', 'movies', 'qualities', 'made', 'vivid', 'charismatic', 'actor', 'energy', 'confidence', 'charm', 'are', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fit', 'Father', 'Brown', 'skill', 'actor', 'however', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'Father', 'Brown', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'Father', 'Brown', 'not', 'bad', 'Even', 'More', 'tones', 'down', 'sometimes', 'twinkles', 'thoughtful', 'humble', 'portrayal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'know', 'then', 'gleam', 'amusement', 'More', 'eyes.For', 'who', 'like', 'Father', 'Brown', 'stories', 'may', 'enjoy', 'mysteries', 'who', 'admire', 'Kenneth', 'More', ""'m"", 'one', ""'re"", 'good', 'deal', 'fun', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'are', 'variable', 'shows', 'were', 'produced', '1974', 'have', 'sharp', 'interiors', 'poor', 'exteriors', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'picture', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'faded', 'too', 'soft', 'not', 'great', 'enough', 'flaw', 'keep', 'anyone', 'purchasing', 'set', 'One', 'second', 'set', 'six', 'episodes', 'will', 'become', 'available', 'soon.Another', 'take', 'mystery-solving', 'priest', 'provided', 'Alec', 'Guinness', '1954', 'movie', 'Father', 'Brown', 'titled', 'Detective', 'U.S.', 'release', 'amusing', 'duel', 'wits', 'belief', 'Father', 'Brown', 'classy', 'thief', 'Flambeau', 'played', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Joan', 'Greenwood', 'delectable', 'support', 'movie', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'tape', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'available']",Father Brown - Set 1

Certainly he doesn't seem like a master detective.But ""Father Brown - Set 1"" soon reminds us that appearances are deceptive, and not all wisdom and insight is of the Sherlock Holmes variety. The 1970s TV adaptation is rather slow-moving, but Kenneth More is brilliant as a kindly, eccentric detective who has an uncanny cleverness that nobody guesses.Father Brown (More) comes to a town ruled over by a despicable aristocrat who womanizes, bullies and abuses the locals... until he's found with his head smashed in by a tiny hammer. There are countless people who could easily have done it, but some of the clues simply don't add up -- and only Father Brown can discover the truth.Among his other cases: a wealthy man found stabbed to death, whose dog gives the only clue to his murderer's identity; an archaeologist is haunted by a madman and a curse. a sun-worshiping cult and a young woman's fall down an elevator shaft; a devoutly cheerful philanthropist falls headfirst from a window; a magistrate who struck a blow against Nazi Germany is found dead; and occult happenings in a remote country house draw Father Brown into a bizarre case.This TV show is based on G.K. Chesterton's short stories, and for the most part it's a pretty faithful adaptation -- each has a crime that is either too simple or baffling, with plenty of red herrings and motives. Not only does Father Brown solve the crime, but he also provides some spiritual or moral insights, without being preachy.The biggest problem with it is that every episode moves rather slowly, like a lot of older British mystery series. But the mysteries are rather clever in that they rely heavily on solutions that are much simpler than they appear, and are full of odd little clues that don't really seem like clues (such as bullets in the floor, or a half-written letter).Of course, any detective show is made or broken by the lead actor, and Kenneth More is absolutely perfect as Father Brown. He comes across as warm, forgiving, kindly, and a little scatterbrained, but he has a keen insight into human nature and good/evil. He also has a bit of wry humor (""That's the problem with being a priest -- people expect you to believe anything"").""Father Brown - Set 1"" is a solid collection of murder mysteries, which are slow-moving but full of human insight.

Sayers, author of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, was the second. As Dale Ahlquist points out in The Apostle of Common Sense, early authors of detective fiction had a problem. They couldn't out do Conan Doyle, then all the rage. Rather than take on Sherlock Holmes, Chesterton did something entirely different with Father Brown.He drew from his friend, Father John O'Connor, for certain particulars of Father Brown, but he got the idea overhearing an aside from two Oxford undergraduates saying what a shame it was for a man to throw himself away in the priesthood, avoiding, as he must be, the various shocks of the real world. Chesterton found amusing the idea that a priest who did almost nothing but hear grisly confessions should know nothing of the dark side of human nature. Therefore, Father Brown says things like this: ""You see it was I who killed all those people...I mean that I thought and thought about how a man might come to be like that until I realized that I really was like that in everything but actual final consent to the action.""Father Brown stories began appearing in The Saturday Evening Post in 1910, and found their way onto TV in the states when they aired on PBS' ""Mystery!"" in the mid- '70s. There is one sense in which these shows differ from the books, and that is that they lack the narrator. The surprise is how well they hold up without it, and in the British TV tradition of ""less is more"", evoke the sense of fog surrounding the various cases and which Kenneth More as the unassuming little priest progressively cuts through. These seven episodes from ATV released through Granada run about 365 minutes and include brief bios of Chesterton and the cast. ""I always like to try the local ale,"" says Father Brown. Quaffing that British beverage is a bit like meeting Father Brown, who begins as a stranger and ends as a friend.The seven episodes of Series One include:The Hammer of God, The Oracle of the Dog, The Curse of the Golden Cross, The Eye of Apollo, The Three Tools of Death, The Mirror of the Magistrate and The Dagger with Wings.",5,Local ale and a visiting priest,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,2151,"['G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'was', 'first', 'president', 'Detection', 'Club', 'Dorothy', 'L.', 'Sayers', 'author', 'Lord', 'Peter', 'Wimsey', 'mysteries', 'was', 'second', 'Dale', 'Ahlquist', 'points', 'out', 'Apostle', 'Common', 'Sense', 'early', 'authors', 'detective', 'fiction', 'had', 'problem', 'could', ""n't"", 'out', 'do', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'then', 'rage', 'Rather', 'take', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Chesterton', 'did', 'something', 'entirely', 'different', 'Father', 'Brown.He', 'drew', 'friend', 'Father', 'John', ""O'Connor"", 'certain', 'particulars', 'Father', 'Brown', 'got', 'idea', 'overhearing', 'aside', 'two', 'Oxford', 'saying', 'what', 'shame', 'was', 'man', 'throw', 'away', 'priesthood', 'avoiding', 'must', 'be', 'various', 'shocks', 'real', 'world', 'Chesterton', 'found', 'amusing', 'idea', 'priest', 'who', 'did', 'almost', 'nothing', 'hear', 'grisly', 'confessions', 'should', 'know', 'nothing', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'nature', 'Therefore', 'Father', 'Brown', 'things', 'see', 'was', 'who', 'killed', 'people', 'mean', 'thought', 'thought', 'how', 'man', 'might', 'come', 'be', 'realized', 'really', 'was', 'everything', 'actual', 'final', 'consent', 'action', 'Father', 'Brown', 'stories', 'began', 'appearing', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', '1910', 'found', 'way', 'TV', 'states', 'when', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Mystery', 'mid-', ""'70s"", 'one', 'sense', 'shows', 'differ', 'books', 'lack', 'narrator', 'surprise', 'how', 'well', 'hold', 'up', 'British', 'TV', 'tradition', 'less', 'more', 'evoke', 'sense', 'fog', 'surrounding', 'various', 'cases', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'unassuming', 'little', 'priest', 'progressively', 'seven', 'episodes', 'ATV', 'released', 'Granada', 'run', '365', 'minutes', 'include', 'brief', 'bios', 'Chesterton', 'cast', 'always', 'try', 'local', 'ale', 'Father', 'Brown', 'Quaffing', 'British', 'beverage', 'bit', 'meeting', 'Father', 'Brown', 'who', 'stranger', 'friend.The', 'seven', 'episodes', 'Series', 'One', 'include', 'Hammer', 'God', 'Oracle', 'Dog', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Cross', 'Eye', 'Apollo', 'Three', 'Tools', 'Death', 'Mirror', 'Magistrate', 'Dagger', 'Wings']",Father Brown - Set 1

Chesterton about an English priest with a talent for stumbling into mysteries.He wrote around 50 short stories about this priest who trusted more to his knowledge of human nature than &#8216;little grey cells&#8217; and could be best summed up by an exchange with one person who asked him &#8220;What could you know about human nature?&#8221; &#8220;Madame I spend my day listening to people confess some of the most terrible things imaginable&#8221;In this series done in the 1970&#8217;s we have the role played by Kenneth More, a wonderful actor usually playing the stolid English middle class he here was playing a somewhat mincing, dithering priest to very good effect and still somehow manages to come off as dreadfully confident, &#8220;Oh I don&#8217;t mind being around atheists, I don&#8217;t have to talk shop.&#8221;This has 7 adventures each based on a different story. The mysteries are good though there are times you need a little more time to work it out. You&#8217;ve got a thread to follow but they rush to the end. There is also a common thread to the solutions that once you realize it, they become very simple-no I&#8217;m not telling.The downside on this is the cinematography. Typical for the British productions of the period it is a horrible mix. Outdoors is done on film and indoors/studio shots are on video tape. Either works but the jumping back and forth is beyond distracting. The very first episode where the production company was feeling their way has Graham Crowden so over acting and the cinematography so distracting my wife and I almost threw the whole thing out but we persevered and enjoyed the rest of it.In the end if you are enraptured with the ideas of England in the 1920&#8217;s, of fine clothes, servants, dressing for dinner and drawing rooms and fine halls that happen to be littered with dead bodies, then this will be a lot of fun.",5,Mystery solving priest in 1920's england,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2061,"['popularity', 'Downton', 'Abbey', 'great', 'many', 'people', 'are', 're-exploring', 'other', 'British', 'works', 'set', '1920', '8217', 'One', 'coming', 'up', 'lot', 'are', 'Father', 'Brown', 'mysteries', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'English', 'priest', 'talent', 'stumbling', 'mysteries.He', 'wrote', '50', 'short', 'stories', 'priest', 'who', 'trusted', 'more', 'knowledge', 'human', 'nature', '8216', 'little', 'grey', 'cells', '8217', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'exchange', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'asked', '8220', 'What', 'could', 'know', 'human', 'nature', '8221', '8220', 'Madame', 'spend', 'day', 'listening', 'people', 'confess', 'most', 'terrible', 'things', 'imaginable', '8221', 'series', 'done', '1970', '8217', 's', 'have', 'role', 'played', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'usually', 'playing', 'stolid', 'English', 'middle', 'class', 'here', 'was', 'playing', 'somewhat', 'mincing', 'dithering', 'priest', 'very', 'good', 'effect', 'still', 'somehow', 'manages', 'come', 'off', 'dreadfully', 'confident', '8220', 'Oh', 'don', '8217', 'mind', 'being', 'atheists', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', 'talk', 'shop.', '8221', '7', 'adventures', 'based', 'different', 'story', 'mysteries', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'times', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'work', 'out', '8217', 've', 'got', 'thread', 'follow', 'rush', 'end', 'also', 'common', 'thread', 'solutions', 'once', 'realize', 'become', 'very', 'simple-no', '8217', 'not', 'telling.The', 'downside', 'cinematography', 'Typical', 'British', 'productions', 'period', 'horrible', 'mix', 'Outdoors', 'done', 'film', 'indoors/studio', 'shots', 'are', 'video', 'tape', 'jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'distracting', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'where', 'production', 'company', 'was', 'feeling', 'way', 'Graham', 'Crowden', 'so', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'so', 'distracting', 'wife', 'almost', 'threw', 'whole', 'thing', 'out', 'persevered', 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'it.In', 'end', 'are', 'enraptured', 'ideas', 'England', '1920', '8217', 'fine', 'clothes', 'servants', 'dressing', 'dinner', 'drawing', 'rooms', 'fine', 'halls', 'happen', 'be', 'littered', 'dead', 'bodies', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'lot', 'fun']",Father Brown - Set 1

Chesterton. His character proved to be as much a bastion of rationality and reason as was the author, and while this series was not the most intricately plotted of mysteries, they were clever and engaging nonetheless. Undoubtedly, this amateur detective is one of the most underrated in fiction, and I think most lovers of British mysteries should enjoy this. Especially for the lovely sets that so well portrayed British life during the time period (late 1920s), which were for me a large part of its appeal.Of course, a series revolving around a Catholic priest is bound to touch on religious issues, though while every episode did contain a message, I felt it was not so overdone save for in the first episode, which tended towards preachiness. Otherwise, the mysteries were satisfying, character driven - and unlike some other reviewers, I found that the acting was generally well done, especially in regards to Kenneth More as Father Brown. I cannot heap enough praise on him, or the way he conveys such a subtle wit and intelligence that lends tremendous credibility to the role, and made me a believer in the priest turned amateur sleuth.",4,Blessedly Good Mysteries,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1336,"['longest', 'time', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'series', 'simply', 'doubted', 'sleuthing', 'credibility', 'priest', 'anyone', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'be', 'G.K.', 'Chesterton', 'character', 'proved', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'bastion', 'rationality', 'reason', 'was', 'author', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'mysteries', 'were', 'clever', 'engaging', 'nonetheless', 'Undoubtedly', 'amateur', 'detective', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'fiction', 'think', 'most', 'lovers', 'British', 'mysteries', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Especially', 'lovely', 'sets', 'so', 'well', 'portrayed', 'British', 'life', 'time', 'period', 'late', '1920s', 'were', 'large', 'part', 'appeal.Of', 'course', 'series', 'revolving', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'bound', 'touch', 'religious', 'issues', 'episode', 'did', 'contain', 'message', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'overdone', 'save', 'first', 'episode', 'tended', 'towards', 'preachiness', 'Otherwise', 'mysteries', 'were', 'satisfying', 'character', 'driven', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'regards', 'Kenneth', 'More', 'Father', 'Brown', 'can', 'not', 'heap', 'enough', 'praise', 'way', 'conveys', 'subtle', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'tremendous', 'credibility', 'role', 'made', 'believer', 'priest', 'turned', 'amateur', 'sleuth']",Father Brown - Set 1

I don't imagine any DVD collection of any other TV show from that era is going to look much better, and some probably would look much worse.My main criticism of this collection is that a couple of the stories end rather abruptly ...to the point where you find yourself wondering, ""What happened?""  One in particular ends where you don't really know what is going to happen to the bad guy.But there are a couple of gems ...particularly the first one ""the Hammer of"" something.Bottom line: they aren't as good as the David Suchet Poirot's but they are worth watching.

Like many other Acorn Media DVD releases of old television shows, the packaging consists of a box with two DVD keep cases inside, with three or four hourlong episodes on each of the two discs. Having seen the BBC's slick new &#34;Father Brown&#34; series with Mark Williams on PBS, I'm surprised to admit that I much prefer this older series. Unlike the Williams version, these older episodes with Kenneth More stick closely to the original GK Chesterton short stories, and even the divergences from Chesterton's original novel are done more for the sake of visualization than for the sake of creative rewriting. Where the Mark Williams series uses Chesterton's stories more as a general framework for launching wholly original plots and dialogue, this show maintains the elegant wordplay and moral-deductive reasoning of Chesterton's original stories. Kenneth More plays Father Brown closer the style of Chesterton's eccentric priest-detective than Williams, who comes across in the new series as more of a generic amateur sleuth. With his absentminded asides and brilliant facial expressions, More nails the abstracted and seemingly meaningless flights of reasoning that often carry the titular priest to brilliant solutions of murder cases. Where the new &#34;Father Brown&#34; reduces characters and plot elements to the most generic possible interpretations, giving us lots of people rifling through desks, this older show takes greater care over the actual mysteries, focusing more on plot than on the slick editing and visuals of the Williams version. While this older program has a cheaper look than the new show, it is more intelligent and more faithful to the literary source material, and it offers a surprising number of distinguished British guest stars like Bernard Lee of James Bond fame. As Chesterton conceived it after meeting a real-life priest who knew more about practical matters than he did, Father Brown is an unassuming parish priest in 1920s Britain who grasps worldly matters better than he lets on and who invariably deduces the solutions of murder mysteries through his brilliant moral insights into the natures of different people. The central paradox of Father Brown, evident in More's subtle interpretation, is that his Catholicism makes him far less superstitious and far more level-headed than many people allegedly freed of religious superstitions. There's very little of this characterization in the bland Mark Williams show, but Kenneth More presents it in spades. In Williams, you rarely hear anything that sounds like Chesterton, but this older show preserves the original dialogue of the stories, and More really makes it sing.
