Tristan finally comes home in this season, so prepare yourself for more wild antics.  He's still flirting with every girl he meets, and spending every spare moment at ""The Drovers"", but we wouldn't have him any other way, right?  James and Helen's kids have grown considerably, as you might expect.

1074772,A3OGU0X4BV2ZM,B000Q7ZLUQ,j.,"[27, 27]","Season seven is a great completion to the series, bringing back Tristan in most of the episodes, and of course James and Siegfried lead the cast.  Lynda Bellingham continues the role of Helen, which is my least favorite actor on the show (I enjoyed the prior Helen - Drinkwater - much more).  Also some of the old characters are brought back, such as, Granville Bennett, Mr. Biggens, Mrs. Pumphrey and Hodgekin, etc.The story lines are reminiscent of the later book, with young Rosie wanting to be a Vet, James' bad purchase of netting, as well as, his attempt to build a small greenhouse.  Then of course that is topped off, with Helen's bad choice of a carpet from a door to door salesman.  Also, we have the young farmer with sensitive nostrils, wearing a red bandana to buy his fish and chips and gets arrested, with James bailing him out.  Then we have the famous Wolfie dog that chases off the two young thieves that rob several old age pensioners, as well as many other fine examples.There is the obvious repeat of some of the old story lines, but they are enjoyable - What is nice, is that the old incident is referenced and smoothly added to the episode.  The show does take some liberties and there are several incidents that are not true to the books, but the episodes are most enjoyable.Too bad there are only seven seasons....  Episode twelve provides a meaningful ending to the series, with our three main characters together, leaving the viewer, to find their next adventure.The 1990 Christmas special (Brotherly Love) is very good, but more like two additional episodes - There is not much related to a Christmas season.  One distracting point of the special is the music - When there is an ironic or funny incident, the music is like - Waa -Waa -Waa; which just does not seem to fit.  (There is a little bit of that music in a few episodes too).The 2003 cast reunion is enjoyable, but much of the interview material is known through past DVD commentaries, etc, and there is not much new information.  The attendees have aged well - Tristan (Peter Davison) is not in the reunion, due to other commitments.  The best part is the off set Vet who provided guidance to the cast through the years is interviewed as well.Overall, a definite purchase and is far better than the 4 - 6 series, and brings back the feel of the original seasons 1 - 3.Series 7(September-December 1990)1.

Tried very hard to watch just one episode a day but that did not last for long! The stories again are great but the best part of the whole show was that it was good entertainment value with none or very few swear words used and apart from the ""punch - up(?)"" between the 2 brothers in one of the later episodes there was very little violence too!
