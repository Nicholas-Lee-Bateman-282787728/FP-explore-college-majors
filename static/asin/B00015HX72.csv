793699,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00015HX72,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 5/11Rate: 35/11: There is nothing more fun than seeing Sean Penn to make a gigantic fool out of himself in a film, and I can just mock him for being one of the most overrated actors alive. He certainly looked like a huge idiot by his facial appearances alone. On the other hand, Robert DeNiro made a painful attempt at comedy by letting his faces to do the work for him like how Curly would do for his The Three Stooges skits. More often than not, he just looked incredibly stupid. To top the worst of acting is Demi Moore. What an awful actress she had been for years. She reached the zenith of corniness when she began to cry during that ridiculous speech given by Sean Penn after winning the lottery. Moreover, I was surprised that she didn't bother using American Sign Language with her deaf daughter character. So, I guess her nude breasts will more than make up for that deficiency. We're No Angels, or should we say...We're No Actors?, is a complete disaster of a film. Sure, once in a while, it's funny primarily because Robert DeNiro kept making a fool out of himself with these stupid faces, and I laughed out of pity. Obviously, intelligence is zero in We're No Actors. First of all, we don't know what crimes Ned and Jimmy committed prior to being incarnated. What if they were convicted murders? Or better yet, what if they were sadist homicidal rapists? Second of all, say...how about replace Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn with a couple of nobody actors? Would we be rooting for them as well? Obviously, no. Simply put, there was too much manipulation at play with the audience. Third of all, just because they might escape to Canada didn't exactly mean extradition becomes impossible. Fourth of all, 1930's wasn't really backwards of a time when it came to photography and newspapers. Surely, there must be newspapers being distributed around the town with clear pictures of the escaped convicts, and surely, the citizen of the town would be greatly alerted about the possibility of seeing them. Remember the scene where Bobby was ready to be electrocuted? To get away with suspension of disbelief, Neil Jordan let him have a gun after turning off the lights for a second or two. Yeah, that's a great piece of directing...not. Fifth of all, nobody from the penal institution was able to recognize Ned and Jimmy in a town? That's why the movie failed as a whole. All in all, skip We're No Actors because it is cut and dried dud.",2,Daniel Day-Lewis Can Do a Better Christy Brown Than Robert DeNiro.,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2448,"['Viewed', '5/11Rate', '35/11', 'nothing', 'more', 'fun', 'seeing', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'make', 'gigantic', 'fool', 'film', 'can', 'just', 'mock', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'overrated', 'actors', 'alive', 'certainly', 'looked', 'huge', 'idiot', 'facial', 'appearances', 'alone', 'other', 'hand', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'made', 'painful', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'letting', 'do', 'work', 'how', 'Curly', 'would', 'do', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'just', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'top', 'worst', 'acting', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'What', 'awful', 'actress', 'had', 'been', 'years', 'reached', 'zenith', 'corniness', 'when', 'began', 'cry', 'ridiculous', 'speech', 'given', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'winning', 'lottery', 'Moreover', 'was', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'using', 'American', 'Sign', 'Language', 'deaf', 'daughter', 'character', 'So', 'guess', 'nude', 'breasts', 'will', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'deficiency', ""'re"", 'Angels', 'should', 'say', ""'re"", 'Actors', 'complete', 'disaster', 'film', 'Sure', 'once', 'while', 'funny', 'primarily', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'kept', 'making', 'fool', 'stupid', 'laughed', 'pity', 'Obviously', 'intelligence', 'zero', ""'re"", 'Actors', 'First', 'all', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'crimes', 'Ned', 'Jimmy', 'committed', 'prior', 'being', 'incarnated', 'What', 'were', 'convicted', 'murders', 'better', 'yet', 'what', 'were', 'sadist', 'homicidal', 'rapists', 'Second', 'say', 'how', 'about', 'replace', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'couple', 'nobody', 'actors', 'Would', 'be', 'rooting', 'as', 'well', 'Obviously', 'Simply', 'put', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'manipulation', 'play', 'audience', 'Third', 'just', 'might', 'escape', 'Canada', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'mean', 'extradition', 'impossible', 'Fourth', '1930', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'backwards', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'photography', 'newspapers', 'Surely', 'must', 'be', 'newspapers', 'being', 'distributed', 'town', 'clear', 'pictures', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'surely', 'citizen', 'town', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'alerted', 'possibility', 'seeing', 'Remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Bobby', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'electrocuted', 'get', 'away', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'let', 'have', 'gun', 'turning', 'off', 'lights', 'second', 'two', 'Yeah', 'great', 'piece', 'directing', 'not', 'Fifth', 'nobody', 'penal', 'institution', 'was', 'able', 'recognize', 'Ned', 'Jimmy', 'town', 'why', 'movie', 'failed', 'whole', 'skip', ""'re"", 'Actors', 'cut', 'dried', 'dud']",N/A

793704,A2Z44AN3F2IN61,B00015HX72,D. K. Stokes,"[10, 10]","Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn are 1920s-era convicts who are dragged along when a vicious killer escapes the electric chair. They end up in a town near the Canadian border, and are mistaken for a pair of priests expected at the local monastery.So they masquerade as priests while looking for an opportunity to cross the border into Canada. An opportunity presents itself in the form of a procession/pilgrimage to the church's sister church across the border. Each priest participating has to bring along someone who needs help, so they decide on the deaf daughter of local laundress and prostitute, played by Demi Moore.This version (there's a 1955 version, but there's no similarity between the movies at all) is billed as a comedy, but it's much more a drama, or maybe an allegory, though I don't have the time or inclination to delve into what it's an allegory for. There are humorous moments, to be sure, but it's not a laugh-aloud comedy at all.It's about life-changing events, about miracles. We never do learn why DeNiro and Penn's characters were in prison to begin with, but we don't need to know. They begin as buddies, but the masquerade affects them in different ways. Penn's character thrives in the monastic life, despite, or maybe because of his ignorance. DeNiro and Moore's characters are world-weary and cynical, but they too are affected by the miraculous.The movie leaves it up to the viewers to decide if the miracles are divine or human, but there's just enough mystery to allow you to believe if you want to.We're No Angels leaves me with the same sort of feeling that Christmas movies like Miracle on 34th Street do--a kind of uplifted feeling, and a renewed faith in the human spirit.

793716,A2PDVQRK9PSIPJ,B00015HX72,Tamarleigh Lippegrenfell,"[0, 0]","I don't understand why this movie was named We're No Angels. I've seen the original Bogart film, and this film bears virtually no resemblance to it whatsoever. I could go through and break it down issue by issue, but the long and short of it is, the entire plot is completely different from start to finish. The characters are all entirely different, the story is entirely different, the setting is entirely different, the ending is entirely different. Literally the ONLY similarity between &#34;We're No Angels&#34; and this film is that both films have a theme of three escaped convicts pretending NOT to be escaped convicts. There isn't even consistency about whether they're pretending to be non-escaped convicts (as in the original) or pretending they're not convicts at all (as in this version).Imagine someone made a movie they called a remake of &#34;Casablanca&#34; and the &#34;remake&#34; had totally different characters and a different plot entirely, and the only similarity were that the protagonist owned a club in Casablanca. Wouldn't that be outrageously inappropriate? Well, that's what this movie did.Think about the movie &#34;12 Angry Men&#34;--both versions are the same movie; one is actually a REMAKE of the other one, updated but essentially the same movie. Another example is &#34;Footloose&#34;--the remake changed a few details (such as having Ren be from Boston instead of from Chicago) but was essentially the same movie, remade.THIS movie, on the other hand, is NOT A REMAKE OF ANYTHING. It is a totally new movie that is trying to capitalize on an old Bogart film by stealing the title and a couple of thematic elements and ignoring everything else.If THIS is a remake of &#34;We're No Angels&#34; then we may as well say &#34;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&#34; is a remake of &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34; since both films (SPOILER ALERT) involve best friends realizing they're in love with one another.This movie was not even very good, but the worst thing about it was that it tries to pretend it's a remake of an old Humphrey Bogart film. If you want to see a good remake of an old Bogart film, check out the Harrison Ford version of &#34;Sabrina&#34;--it's as good, in its own way, as the original (and it stays true to the original while updating it for a different era).",2,This is NOT a remake of We're No Angels.,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,2307,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'named', ""'re"", 'Angels', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'original', 'Bogart', 'film', 'film', 'virtually', 'resemblance', 'whatsoever', 'could', 'go', 'break', 'down', 'issue', 'issue', 'long', 'short', 'entire', 'plot', 'completely', 'different', 'start', 'finish', 'characters', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'story', 'entirely', 'different', 'setting', 'entirely', 'different', 'ending', 'entirely', 'different', 'Literally', 'ONLY', 'similarity', '34', ""'re"", 'Angels', '34', 'film', 'films', 'have', 'theme', 'three', 'escaped', 'convicts', 'pretending', 'NOT', 'be', 'escaped', 'convicts', ""n't"", 'even', 'consistency', ""'re"", 'pretending', 'be', 'non-escaped', 'convicts', 'original', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'not', 'convicts', 'version', '.Imagine', 'someone', 'made', 'movie', 'called', 'remake', '34', 'Casablanca', '34', '34', 'remake', '34', 'had', 'totally', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'plot', 'entirely', 'only', 'similarity', 'were', 'protagonist', 'owned', 'club', 'Casablanca', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'outrageously', 'inappropriate', 'Well', 'what', 'movie', 'did.Think', 'movie', '34', '12', 'Angry', 'Men', '34', 'versions', 'are', 'same', 'movie', 'one', 'actually', 'REMAKE', 'other', 'one', 'updated', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'example', '34', 'Footloose', '34', 'remake', 'changed', 'few', 'details', 'such', 'having', 'Ren', 'be', 'Boston', 'instead', 'Chicago', 'was', 'essentially', 'same', 'movie', 'remade.THIS', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'NOT', 'A', 'REMAKE', 'ANYTHING', 'totally', 'new', 'movie', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'old', 'Bogart', 'film', 'stealing', 'title', 'couple', 'thematic', 'elements', 'ignoring', 'everything', 'else.If', 'THIS', 'remake', '34', ""'re"", 'Angels', '34', 'then', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'say', '34', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Porno', '34', 'remake', '34', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', '34', 'films', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'involve', 'best', 'friends', 'realizing', ""'re"", 'love', 'one', 'another.This', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'very', 'good', 'worst', 'thing', 'was', 'pretend', 'remake', 'old', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'remake', 'old', 'Bogart', 'film', 'check', 'out', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'version', '34', 'Sabrina', '34', 'as', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'original', 'true', 'original', 'updating', 'different', 'era']",N/A
