My first version of this series was on VHS as I taped it from the television, so it is still worth it to that aspect. It is a smaller fit into your overall DVD collection as the box doesn't really take up that much room compared to the shows first time on DVD.For those that haven't seen any one part of the series yet, it can be confusing and a little frustrating as all the loose ends don't seem to be tied up. Much of it is up for interpretation and guessing.Overall a really excellent series though if you can put up with it. Many describe Shinji (THE MAIN CHARACTER) to be rather annoying, but I liked him along with most of the cast. The DUB version is just as good as the SUB in my opinion.

1102925,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000VLL0O8,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[6, 17]","This review refers to the sub version, for my dub review look at theNeon Genesis Evangelion - Perfect Collection.After seeing Eva for the first time about four months ago, I wrote a review and gave the series three stars, stating many reasons why it was and wasn't good (you can still read that review for the Perfect Collection). The review for the most part was quite neutral, but I received many comments asking me to give it another chance and watch in Japanese instead of in English. Eventually I caved, and now I'm glad I did. Although the series still suffers from some glaring flaws IMO, it is a whole lot better and easier watching it with the subtitles on than with the dubbing. The characters are presented much better and the acting is spot on. I didn't feel like strangling the main character every five seconds like I did with the dub and that in itself made the series better.---THE GOOD---The Characters in the sub are WAY better than their dub counterparts. In the dub I wanted to strangle the characters, or throw them off the cliff in annoyance and disdain. Shinji was just such a wimp I felt absolutely no sympathy for him and actually rooted on his demise (which never came). Misato was nothing but a slut, Auska a loud mouth brat, and Rei a pent up introvert.Although the characters in the sub are, on the surface, more or less the same, the way they are presented is completely different. Shinji, although still a cowardly weakling, take a dramatic change after the first volume and starts to open up to the people around him for the majority of the show. from volume 2 on to volume 6, his character is somewhat likable in the way that he starts competing with the others and relates to them as a normal human being would. In volume one, he's completely unlikable, and then slowly changes into someone who the viewer can have an easier time relating to.Rei is just the same in the dub and the sub alike. Her character is still a pent up introvert who refuses to open up. Really, she is one of the glaring flaws in this anime series. Her character never gets much attention at all, which is a shame because she could have been a very interesting character. She shows some signs of opening up in volume two, but after that all attempts at establishing her character are dropped. She exists in the background for the rest of the show, never doing or saying much of anything.At the same time, upon second viewing, the mech battles aren't nearly as bad as I remember them being. Although there is still a problem with repetition, the problem isn't as annoying as it was when I first saw it. There was considerably less yelling in the sub version which made the otherwise cheesy battles quite tense. In the dub, everything seemed centered on the angel battles, but in the sub version, the angels are more of a back-story, a side show to the characters story.Overall, almost nothing in the sub was quite as bad as it was in the dub version. The battles were better, the characters were better, and the overall mood of the series was better.---The Bad---At the same time, parts I remember as amazing were quite as good in the sub as they were in the dub. While watching the English version I remember volumes 6 and 7 being among the best episodes I've ever seen in anime, but when I watched them again, they didn't hold the same power they did when I first watched them. Auska's, Misato's, and Shinji's decent into depression all seemed to happen all at once. One episode everything's pretty much okay, the next everyone's thinking about suicide. I understand why everyone gets depressed, they all have their reasons and they are all understandable, but it didn't quite have the same power as it did in the dub. for other shows, likeNow and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), the drama was always better in Japanese, but here it seems that just for certain parts, the dub version holds more power.Also, the ending, although a little better the second time around, is still a piece of garbage that should never have aired on TV. It seems the creator of this show though we couldn't figure out why the characters were depressed by ourselves so he created episode 25 to spell it out in minute detail and cover every single little thought they had. Was this really necessary? I already know why they all hate themselves; episode 25 is just throwing every ounce of subtlety away and spelling everything out for us in a really long and boring way. the music doesn't help out any, driving the viewer more towards sleep than interest, and the animation is, for the most part, just some character sitting in a dark room while his/her younger self talks to them in a monotone voice.Episode 26 is a little better, but not by much. If you like hearing people talk to themselves, than maybe you'll like this, but otherwise this episode will have you falling asleep. The whole episode is just psycho babble, Shinji telling us (again) that he hates himself and everyone asking him why. At the very end we get a glimpse of an alternate world where the angels never showed up, and all the characters have very different personalities. This is near the end, and from that part up until the closing shot it's pretty decent. Overall, the ending is just too needlessly boring. its the kind of ""artistic"" ending that a college film student will make and his teacher will praise, but everyone else in the class will fall asleep while watching. it may be ""artsy"" but its boring and peointlesly complicated and doesn't finish the stoy in any way.Also I have to point out that the music for this series is for the most part pretty awful. Although the opening song is quite catchy the background music and closing theme do not in any way inhance teh feel of the show. Its the same song every time an angle shows up, the same song every time something sad happens, and that's about it. The ending song, as is normal in anime series, is less than noteworthy.If you are thinking about watching this series, please for the love of god, watch it in Japanese. Do not ever bother with the English version, it sucks.

I love this anime for its representation of oppression.In the series, Shinji, Rei and Asuka are fighting against the evil Angels in their Evangelion robots. However, the pilots get psychologically scarred when the robots get hurt. Unlike Gundam, these suits of armor cause nothing but pain. The adults force the children to fight these powerful beings. And the pilots of the Angels could even be just like them.The director of the series leaves many questions unanswered. However, there is one message that is clear. The apocalypse is coming for their hometown, New-Tokyo 3. The apocalypse is coming for the entire world in this series. In fact, the entire fate of the world rests in the hands of NERV, the corporation in charge of destroying angels. NERV is funded by SEALE. And the progression of NERV and SEALE's Instrumentality Project could put the entire world in jeopardy.It's not hard to see why Evangelion is one of the most revered series in Japan. This series exposes the problems of elitism in Japan that still need to be resolved, even to this day. Despite the scientific mumbo-jumbo and the abstract ending, this series is awesome, and is not to be taken lightly.(New in Perfect Collection)Perfect collection features all the special features that were excluded in the Platinum Complete collection.

1102927,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000VLL0O8,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[27, 36]","Gainax's staggeringly ambitious, 26-episode series NEON GENESIS EVANGELION is declared as one of the most compelling Anime productions of all time.  It also happens to be one of most controversial.  On one side of the coin are a bunch of loyal, unbending followers that idolize the show.  On the other are a group of naysayers who say otherwise.  As far as my views of EVANGELION are concerned, I fall somewhere in the middle.  In many ways, the show is indeed brilliant and thought provoking--something rarely seen in any animated production, American or Japanese.  At the same time, however, there are elements of EVANGELION that rub me the wrong way.The show, set in post-apocalyptic Tokyo-3, involves alien-like monsters known as ""Angels"" that continually threaten the metropolis. Only psychologically messed up teenagers -- who include introverted Shinji Ikari, enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and mean-spirited Asuka Langley Sohryu -- stand a chance against them. They do this by piloting their Evangelions -- giant, superpowerful, robot-like fighters.  In charge of the whole thing is Misato Katsuragi, a tough, no-nonsense woman who cares for the children while dealing with her own issues.  Also calling the shots is Shinji's cold, unsympathetic father, Gendo Ikari, who seems to have an agenda of his own, although we're not entirely clear about what it is.  And then there is the matter over whether the real threat in Tokyo-3 is in the presence of the Angels or an even more ominous organization, known as SEELE, which is occasionally seen as a group of tabloids with numbers.As mentioned, there are many aspects of EVANGELION that are good and bad.  The technical aspects of this show are impressive -- particularly the dramatic and emotionally charged battles between the EVAs and the grotesquely designed angels; a sense of mystery and intrigue exudes from its complex storyline.  As a matter of fact, the show is at its best when it focuses on the conflict between the Angels and the human race.  Furthermore, even though a majority of the characters are basically unlikable (save perhaps, for Misato), director Anno does dedicate some episodes delving into their tormented pasts.  This is often done in surreal, bizarre, ""dream"" like sequences involving kaleidoscopic imagery and inner thoughts.  Also interesting (and sometimes disorienting) is the use of classical music for several episodes toward the end, notably Handel's ""Messiah"" and Beethoven's ""Choral"" Symphony.It has been widely touted that the characters of EVANGELION are some of the most complex, socially washed out beings ever committed to Anime.  On one level, it provides for some intriguing interactions, from Shinji's estranged relationships with both his father and the bitchy Asuka to Misato's own fractured love affair with her off again on again beau, Kaji.  The character development becomes gradually less intriguing, however, as each episode exorcises the same angst-ridden issues over and over again, with little to no resolution.  In the surprisingly grim and violent latter half of the series, the characters all head into a downward spiral.  At the same time, EVANGELION starts to become less intriguing (if sometimes confusing) and turns messy, almost to the point of being totally incomprehensible.  Questions that viewers are likely to have about the plot are never answered, and some later episodes have scenes in which absolutely nothing happens that last too long.Another problem with EVANGELION is its ending or rather, lack thereof.  While Gainax's previous TV show, NADIA, took a wrong turn at the midpoint, it did get recover for its last episodes and delivered a strong, if too short conclusion.  Here, however, the story simply falls apart.  The final two episodes, which are very much played out like extensive therapy sessions, eschew both action and coherency in favor of deconstructing the protagonists' minds.  In doing so, it makes the mistake of underwhelming the audience.  There are some interesting artistic styles, like Shinji being drawn as a sketch in deep space, but even this potentially experimental approach is compromised by the lack of a structure for a compelling conclusion.In spite of its faults, NEON GENESIS EVANGELION is still worth watching for many reasons.  Its impressively directed action sequences, intriguing mysteries, and in-depth character studies have been seldom matched in others of its kind.ADV Films has released the series countless times on DVD--this is the Platinum version, which contains two director's cut versions of several episodes from the show as well as plentiful extras, which include commentaries from the English cast. The dub, provided by Industrial Smoke & Mirrors in the mid '90s, like the show, tends to receive polarized reaction. The dub follows the script fairly well, and the acting is mostly emotionally sound (if at times too melodramatic).  On the flipside, it is somewhat disappointing that the young protagonists don't sound like children--especially after ADV's dub for NADIA impressed me with their use of actual child actors.  Fortunately, the whole dub is carried by Alison Keith's terrific turn as Misato--she brings a lot of sassiness and instant likeability to the character.  Her performance *sells* the dub as a whole even when the script becomes confusing in places.NEON GENESIS EVANGELION will certainly not win over converts beyond a certain age -- its complicated and sometimes too angst-ridden plot is more likely to appeal to adolescents.  As an ambitious and daring exercise in bringing Anime to wider audiences, however, it's remarkable in how it achieved that goal.",4,Brilliant and impressive if sometimes too confusing landmark
