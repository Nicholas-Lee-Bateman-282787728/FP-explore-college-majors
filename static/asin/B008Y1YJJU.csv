No overt sex. No car chases or crashes. Stumps me....Or maybe it is because it is extremely well written, well acted and a great throw-back to the days when television really meant something.As already expressed by many here;  Great acting. Wonderful scripts. Wonderful guest stars. Great production values(remember, the Marine Corp helped and I'm sure it helped recruitment. Unfortunately, just 2 to 3 years before Viet Nam heated up!)And, best of all, one of my all-time favorite actors, Gary Lockwood gets some of his due. It is great to see him again in this 50 year old classic(I can't  believe it's been 50 years!!! I watched it as a teenager).Gary, if you ever read this, I'd just like to say that many, many of us remember you fondly for this series and continue to wish you all the best.

I'm not sure why this show didn't catch on. But it's clear from watching it that Roddenberry knows how to produce a TV series. I'm glad I bought it.

Or are you an avid &#34;Trekker&#34; who wonders what Gene Roddenberry was up to pre-Trek?  Look no further -- &#34;The Lieutenant&#34; is in! Starting with the first part of this sterling example of good, adult-level drama -- a sort of military man's viewpoint &#34;Army Wives&#34; type of show -- you will witness the day-at-the-office approach to soldiering in this wisely-done series, where the show's flawed protagonist, Marine 2nd Lt. William Tiberius Rice (that's right, Trekkers -- &#34;Tiberius&#34; -- played by Gary &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34; Lockwood) still gets his job to country, the flag, and Mom's proverbial apple pie done -- but often also receiving a lecture by his superiors, often in the form of Capt. Rambridge (Robert &#34;Man From UNCLE&#34; Vaughn.)

1578476,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B008Y1YJJU,Gary P. Cohen,"[16, 17]","The release of ""The Lieutenant"" on DVD, continues the welcome trend of the recent releases of several excellent series from the early 1960s that only lasted one season including ""The Gallant Men,"" ""87th. Precinct"" and ""Wide Country.""  ""The Lieutenant"" was aired Saturday nights at 7:30 on NBC from 1963-1964.  The series concerned a young Lieutenant in the peacetime Marine Corps (although it would not be peacetime much longer as the Viet Nam was was kicking into gear during this period.)  The war was touched on in occasional episodes although the majority of the series took place in Camp Pendleton.""The Lieutenant"" starred Gary Lockwood, just coming off co-starring in another excellent one-season series ""Follow the Sun"" and 2 films co-starring with Elvis (""Wild in the Country' and ""It Happened at the Worlds Fair.)  The series co-starred Robert Vaughn as Captain Raymond Rambridge, Lt. Rice's (Lockwood's) no-nonsense superior.  The series was created and produced by Gene Roddenberry, who after this created a little remembered sci. fi. series called ""Star Trek.""""The Lieutenant"" was an excellent series that, for whatever reason, was cancelled after 1 season. I've watched the first 2 episodes of season one and the picture quality seems excellent.  Like so many other series of that period, it featured great guest actors, many of whom made it big in the movies or later on TV.  After the series was cancelled, Roddenberry did the first ""Star Trek"" pilot which was not bought by NBC. (""Too Cerebral"" the NBC execs said.)  In 1965, he did the second Trek pilot (""Where No Man Has Gone Before"") which was picked up for the 1966 season by NBC.  Lockwood guest-starred as Gary Mitchell, a friend of Captain Kirks who becomes a super-genius after being zapped by some alien device.  He eventually becomes a menace to the Enterprise and Kirk must destroy him.  Lockwood became another part of sci. fi. history co-starring in Stanley Kubrick's legendary ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  The year right after ""The Lieutenant""s cancellation, Vaughn became Napoleon Solo, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" As a result of this I'm sure he wasn't too upset by ""The Lieutenant""s cancellation.In the last couple months ""The Lieutenant"" has joined two other old favorites, ""The Gallant Men"" and ""Harry O,"" with its dvd release.  I absolutely hope that this trend continues as there are many other series that I would like to see on dvd.

I suppose the Roddenberry pedigree may entice a lot of people, but this was a complete blind-buy for me. I've always liked Gary Lockwood's guest appearances on other shows so I decided to get this. What a terrific series!There's a nice balance between the Marine/civilian life so if the idea of a ""war"" show doesn't appeal to you, ""The Lieutenant"" is much more than that. It's like an early '60s anthology drama with a military motif. The guest-star roster is surreal. Where else can you see Mr. Roper (Norman Fell) and The Man--as in ""Chico and..."" (Jack Albertson) in the same episode? Lots of great, familiar character actors too. Gary Lockwood is beyond handsome here--the camera just loves him.

I really liked the series Combat that began its run in 1962 when I was eleven.  I recall how different The Lieutenant was from ""war"" movies and television shows that I'd watched before.  This series, from my twelve year old perspective, was serious and seemed real.  I liked Gary Lockwood very much.  I also liked Robert Vaughn as the company commander.  He was definitely in command, but also seemed truly concerned about his men.ABOUT THE PACKAGING AND DVDs:  The single-sided DVDs are well protected in the plastic case.  Don't look for any booklet or details on the individual episodes or any extras on the DVDs.  The menu is simple and straight forward, but effective.  It does not appear that the episodes were remastered, but the quality is still very good.  I'm watching it on a 40"" LED Samsung HD and the picture appears pretty sharp and clear.Since this is the first product I have owned on DVD-R media, I was concerned about how they would play.  So, this evening I placed each disc in my Sony Upscaling DVD Player (model DVP-NS710H/B) which I purchased new in 2010.  Each disc loaded.  I checked out the menus and scrolled through the options.  I played the beginning of two episodes on each disc.  They played fine.
