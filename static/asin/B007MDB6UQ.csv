Meanwhile, Dax tells Giancarlo that Asimov isn't working on his own and is reporting to someone.Ep8- Answers  Apr. 29, 2012Becca is in custody being questioned by Jamie Ortega but manages to escape when a secret door inexplicably opens to let her out. Unbeknown to her, a CIA agent is killed in the interrogation room after she leaves and the authorities believe Becca is responsible. There is a mole in the CIA however.

She is a beautiful, mild looking person, but when she goes into action, I was totally surprised by her. I don't think of her as an action hero, but she plays the part of the mother who will do anything for her child character, that it is totally believable.The writing is excellent as well. I'm looking forward to season two if Ashley Judd is still in it.I thought I saw online, that the second season was starring another woman in the lead role. I hope this is not the case. I haven't heard anything more on it so I wait with anticipation that she is still playing the main character.I was pleasently surprised by the son's character as well. He did a real great job playing the kidnapped kid in the first season.I was a litttle dissapointed in Keith Carradine's part. He wasn't believable in this. He comes from a long line of great acters, but he didn't do anything for me in this role.

1534532,A2CON4GD056OGB,B007MDB6UQ,Louisa the Lemming,"[1, 2]","First and only season of a cancelled TV series about a female super-spy!  I rented the DVD series from the library.  Ashley Judd plays Becca, a retired CIA agent, who has raised her son alone since her beloved husband and fellow super-spy (SEAN BEAN supposedly died in a bombing incident.  When her son is abducted from college, by villains unknown, Judd races off to Europe to rescue him.I'm always on the lookout for a good female-driven adventure series, and I LOVE Sean Bean.  But MISSING was a complete failure.First there is the heroine.  Becca has none of the charm, allure, or sophistication you expect of a grown-up female spy.  She does not employ disguises, acting, cleverness, linguistic skills, or multi-cultural savvy.  Instead, she races around Europe, dressed as a dumpy housewife, engaging in as many frenetic action and chase sequences as possible.  Clearly Judd worked hard learning how to fight, but she lacks the physical grace that is needed to make gratuitous action scenes endurable.  Also, pointless physical exertion for its own sake is not believable, and kills the suspense. It comes across as if she is trying to burn calories, rather than accomplish a life-or-death objective.The script leans heavily on the fact that Becca is a WOMAN and a MOTHER, and promotes sexist cliches relating to such. Self-control, cunning, and cool thinking are evidently considered unfeminine by this creative team, and thus play no part of Becca's character.  She has all the negative qualities associated with poorly written damsels or ""neurotic females"", and seems ruled by impulse and emotion.  She even violently attacks the hero at one point, as hysterical damsels often do.  That's okay for traditional damsels, as the guy can just manfully restrain them till their hysterics wear off.  It is not okay for Becca, as her hands are deadly weapons, and the guy trying to manfully restrain her could easily have been killed in the process.But morality and intelligence do not apply to a MOTHER trying to save her SON, or so Becca insists every time she does something evil or stupid.  In the most detestable part of the series, Becca tortures and dismembers a woman in order to get information.  Then she CRIES about it, to show how feminine she is, which has her two rival suitors falling all over themselves feeling sorry for her.  Earlier, Becca allowed a well-meaning friend to remain in deadly peril, rather than telling her to go home.  So she's capable of torture, but she's too ""nice"" to be firm with her friend, even to save that friend's life. Adding to the generally offensive sexism of this series, a teenage victim of the sex-trade is tossed in as a love interest for Becca's son.I probably only got through this series because of Sean Bean, but the script is so bad that I actually found his character less and less interesting the more I knew about him.",1,Missing a real heroine,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,2880,"['First', 'only', 'season', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'series', 'female', 'super-spy', 'rented', 'DVD', 'series', 'library', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Becca', 'retired', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'raised', 'son', 'alone', 'beloved', 'husband', 'fellow', 'super-spy', 'SEAN', 'BEAN', 'supposedly', 'died', 'bombing', 'incident', 'When', 'son', 'abducted', 'college', 'villains', 'unknown', 'Judd', 'Europe', 'rescue', 'him.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'lookout', 'good', 'female-driven', 'adventure', 'series', 'LOVE', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'MISSING', 'was', 'complete', 'failure.First', 'heroine', 'Becca', 'none', 'charm', 'allure', 'sophistication', 'expect', 'grown-up', 'female', 'spy', 'not', 'employ', 'disguises', 'acting', 'cleverness', 'linguistic', 'skills', 'multi-cultural', 'savvy', 'Instead', 'Europe', 'dressed', 'dumpy', 'housewife', 'engaging', 'as', 'many', 'frenetic', 'action', 'chase', 'sequences', 'possible', 'Clearly', 'Judd', 'worked', 'hard', 'learning', 'how', 'fight', 'physical', 'grace', 'needed', 'make', 'gratuitous', 'action', 'scenes', 'endurable', 'Also', 'pointless', 'physical', 'exertion', 'own', 'sake', 'not', 'believable', 'suspense', 'trying', 'burn', 'calories', 'rather', 'accomplish', 'life-or-death', 'objective.The', 'script', 'heavily', 'fact', 'Becca', 'WOMAN', 'MOTHER', 'promotes', 'sexist', 'cliches', 'relating', 'such', 'Self-control', 'cunning', 'cool', 'thinking', 'are', 'evidently', 'considered', 'unfeminine', 'creative', 'team', 'thus', 'play', 'part', 'Becca', 'character', 'negative', 'qualities', 'associated', 'poorly', 'written', 'damsels', 'neurotic', 'females', 'ruled', 'impulse', 'emotion', 'even', 'violently', 'hero', 'one', 'point', 'hysterical', 'damsels', 'often', 'do', 'okay', 'traditional', 'damsels', 'guy', 'can', 'just', 'manfully', 'restrain', 'till', 'hysterics', 'wear', 'off', 'not', 'okay', 'Becca', 'hands', 'are', 'deadly', 'weapons', 'guy', 'trying', 'manfully', 'restrain', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'process.But', 'morality', 'intelligence', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'MOTHER', 'trying', 'save', 'SON', 'so', 'Becca', 'insists', 'time', 'something', 'evil', 'stupid', 'most', 'detestable', 'part', 'series', 'Becca', 'tortures', 'dismembers', 'woman', 'order', 'get', 'information', 'Then', 'show', 'how', 'feminine', 'two', 'rival', 'suitors', 'falling', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'Earlier', 'Becca', 'allowed', 'well-meaning', 'friend', 'remain', 'deadly', 'peril', 'rather', 'telling', 'go', 'home', 'capable', 'torture', 'too', 'nice', 'be', 'firm', 'friend', 'even', 'save', 'friend', 'life', 'Adding', 'generally', 'offensive', 'sexism', 'series', 'teenage', 'victim', 'sex-trade', 'tossed', 'love', 'interest', 'Becca', 'son.I', 'probably', 'only', 'got', 'series', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'script', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'found', 'character', 'less', 'less', 'interesting', 'more', 'knew']",N/A
