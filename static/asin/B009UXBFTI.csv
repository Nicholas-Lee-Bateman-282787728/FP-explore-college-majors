Her other videos she gave much better instructions before doing each move and took a little more time demonstration them.  If you are looking for a quicker video though and the option of doing a cardio one day and toneing the next it's a nice option. Will enjoy doing this when I have limited time, but will be much easier once I've got down all the moves and go as fast as her.",4,Pretty Good,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,462,"['So', 'just', 'tried', 'video..It', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'other', 'videos', 'gave', 'much', 'better', 'instructions', 'doing', 'move', 'took', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'demonstration', 'are', 'looking', 'quicker', 'video', 'option', 'doing', 'cardio', 'one', 'day', 'toneing', 'next', 'nice', 'option', 'Will', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'when', 'have', 'limited', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'once', ""'ve"", 'got', 'moves', 'go', 'as', 'fast']",N/A

1602411,A1CCW4DLR2BPWA,B009UXBFTI,Happy Hiker,"[1, 1]","I bought this because Brooke is over 40, and what woman wouldn't want to look like her, including those under 40.  Do I think that if I do it every day that I will look like Brooke?  No.  However, if I do it every day, I will definitely be fitter and healthier and maybe even leaner and stronger.For those reviewers who are slamming this DVD, the technical adviser is Kendell Hogan, and he makes solid workouts.  He was on ExerciseTV and I think in some Crunch DVDs.  There are some new-to-me moves on this, which was a nice surprise.This DVD has two 30-minute workouts, one for cardio and one for strength that uses light weights.  Each workout is about 25 minutes plus a 5-minute stretch.Brooke's personality is pleasant and fun. From doing each workout once, I can't see anything that would grate on my nerves time after time.  Her instruction is good, but when she's demoing a move, I tend to move around a lot to stay active.The workouts are good.  I'd recommend this to beginners and people returning to exercise after being away for a while.  Intermediates looking for a light day DVD might like it, too.  One of the best things about it is the pace - it's slow enough that you don't get hurt, but you can modify your moves and go faster if you want.  For cardio, I prefer walking and running. However, Brooke's personality combined with some of the moves made this the first ever cardio DVD I've done that made me smile - it's actually fun!  As for the weights portion, she recommends light weights, but the two-pounders I used were far too light.  I'll try 3's and 5's in the future. (I go light the first time I try a new DVD.)  Both workouts use moves that are full-body workouts with lots of core work in the moves.  One woman shows modifications to make the moves easier.The set is nice - hardwood floors with floor to ceiling sheer white curtains that hide what looks to be an ocean, but I'm sure it's just a backdrop made to look like an ocean.  The lighting is bright and cheerful.  All in all, it's a pretty set that is one of the best &#34;living room&#34; type sets in a workout DVD.  The faux-brick gym or industrial-type setting get OLD fast.The music upbeat and nice.Overall, this a great workout DVD for those who want a short workout that's effective but not exhausting.  To me, it's a fun workout that's done in a feminine way, even though you're sweating (in the cardio part) and working your muscles (in the strength part).  Too many workout DVDs out there are either feminine and ineffective or effective but in your face drill sergeant.  I think Brooke has hit gold with this DVD, and I will definitely try her other DVDs.",4,Fun cardio and innovative moves,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",2014,2651,"['bought', 'Brooke', '40', 'what', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'including', '40', 'Do', 'think', 'do', 'day', 'will', 'look', 'Brooke', 'No', 'However', 'do', 'day', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'fitter', 'healthier', 'maybe', 'even', 'leaner', 'stronger.For', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'slamming', 'DVD', 'technical', 'adviser', 'Kendell', 'Hogan', 'solid', 'workouts', 'was', 'ExerciseTV', 'think', 'Crunch', 'DVDs', 'are', 'new-to-me', 'moves', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise.This', 'DVD', 'two', '30-minute', 'workouts', 'one', 'cardio', 'one', 'strength', 'light', 'weights', 'workout', '25', 'minutes', '5-minute', 'stretch.Brooke', 'personality', 'pleasant', 'fun', 'doing', 'workout', 'once', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'would', 'grate', 'nerves', 'time', 'time', 'instruction', 'good', 'when', 'demoing', 'move', 'tend', 'move', 'lot', 'stay', 'active.The', 'workouts', 'are', 'good', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'beginners', 'people', 'returning', 'exercise', 'being', 'away', 'while', 'looking', 'light', 'day', 'DVD', 'might', 'like', 'too', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'pace', 'slow', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'can', 'modify', 'moves', 'go', 'faster', 'want', 'cardio', 'prefer', 'walking', 'running', 'However', 'Brooke', 'personality', 'combined', 'moves', 'made', 'first', 'ever', 'cardio', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'done', 'made', 'smile', 'actually', 'fun', 'weights', 'portion', 'light', 'weights', 'two-pounders', 'used', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'light', ""'ll"", 'try', '3', '5', 'future', 'go', 'light', 'first', 'time', 'try', 'new', 'DVD', 'workouts', 'use', 'moves', 'are', 'full-body', 'workouts', 'lots', 'core', 'work', 'moves', 'One', 'woman', 'modifications', 'make', 'moves', 'easier.The', 'set', 'nice', 'hardwood', 'floors', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'sheer', 'white', 'curtains', 'hide', 'what', 'be', 'ocean', ""'m"", 'sure', 'just', 'backdrop', 'made', 'look', 'ocean', 'lighting', 'bright', 'cheerful', 'pretty', 'set', 'one', 'best', '34', 'living', 'room', '34', 'type', 'sets', 'workout', 'DVD', 'faux-brick', 'gym', 'industrial-type', 'setting', 'get', 'OLD', 'fast.The', 'music', 'upbeat', 'nice.Overall', 'great', 'workout', 'DVD', 'who', 'want', 'short', 'workout', 'effective', 'not', 'exhausting', 'fun', 'done', 'feminine', 'way', 'even', ""'re"", 'sweating', 'cardio', 'part', 'working', 'muscles', 'strength', 'part', 'Too', 'many', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'out', 'are', 'feminine', 'ineffective', 'effective', 'face', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'think', 'Brooke', 'hit', 'gold', 'DVD', 'will', 'definitely', 'try', 'other', 'DVDs']",N/A
1602412,A2TSHT8NOB3JME,B009UXBFTI,Heather M.,"[1, 1]",This was the first DVD that I ever bought featuring Brooke. It was really good. I don't know why some people are saying it is more of a beginner workout. The moves are not complicated and she shows them to your first by demo. When she says it is burning it actually was when I was doing it. I would not say this is for someone advanced. I would say this is more of an intermediate workout. Since the second workout is focused on toning you don't sweat as much but you still like you got a good workout. You might want to do a cardio segment before doing the second workout.,5,30 Day Slim Down,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",2013,573,"['was', 'first', 'DVD', 'ever', 'bought', 'featuring', 'Brooke', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'more', 'beginner', 'workout', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'first', 'demo', 'When', 'burning', 'actually', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'doing', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'someone', 'advanced', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'intermediate', 'workout', 'second', 'workout', 'focused', 'toning', 'do', ""n't"", 'sweat', 'as', 'much', 'still', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'might', 'want', 'do', 'cardio', 'segment', 'doing', 'second', 'workout']",N/A

I know that once I losen up a little, and do it a couple times, I will master it, so i'm still giving it 5 stars.
