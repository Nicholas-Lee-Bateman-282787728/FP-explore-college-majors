1435034,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B004ZZDYDG,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[10, 11]","""Building Your AR-15 From Scratch"" is a well produced and informative instructional video on building an AR-15. We have built eight AR lower assemblies and bought fully assembled uppers to complete the builds but wanted to move to being able to build a complete rifle.This video does provide all of the required information to fully build a rifle using parts kits and there are a lot of good tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes. I particularly like the active camera work that captures the detail of the finer build steps.We also use this book,The AR-15 Complete Assembly Guide (AR-15 Guide Vol 2), which makes a good companion to this video.Highly Recommended!CFH",5,Really Very Good - Highly Recommended,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,678,"['Building', 'AR-15', 'Scratch', 'well', 'produced', 'informative', 'instructional', 'video', 'building', 'AR-15', 'have', 'built', 'eight', 'AR', 'lower', 'assemblies', 'bought', 'fully', 'assembled', 'uppers', 'complete', 'builds', 'wanted', 'move', 'being', 'able', 'build', 'complete', 'rifle.This', 'video', 'provide', 'required', 'information', 'fully', 'build', 'rifle', 'using', 'parts', 'kits', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'tips', 'tricks', 'help', 'avoid', 'common', 'mistakes', 'particularly', 'active', 'camera', 'work', 'detail', 'finer', 'build', 'steps.We', 'also', 'use', 'book', 'AR-15', 'Complete', 'Assembly', 'Guide', 'AR-15', 'Guide', 'Vol', '2', 'good', 'companion', 'video.Highly', 'Recommended', 'CFH']",Building Your AR-15 From Scratch

It's a bargain for the price, because it might just save you time, money, and frustration. If you have a familiarity with tools or have gunsmithing experience, fine and dandy, build it yourself. But if this is something you've never done before, get help. It is very easy to screw this up, as the video makes clear, especially in the early stages when it is easy to damage the lower, sometimes beyond repair.The video also shows that to do it right, you should invest in a number of speciality tools. The cost of these tools (punches, wrenches, receiver block, etc.) mounts up pretty quickly. If you live in the New York Tri-State area, you can spend roughly the same amount of money at Gun for Hire in Woodland Park, NJ, and they will work with you one-on-one to design, order parts, and guide you through the build, using all the right tools.",4,Great Step-by-Step Guide,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,917,"['Anyone', 'considering', 'building', 'should', 'watch', 'video', 'first', 'bargain', 'price', 'might', 'just', 'save', 'time', 'money', 'frustration', 'have', 'familiarity', 'tools', 'have', 'gunsmithing', 'experience', 'fine', 'dandy', 'build', 'something', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'before', 'get', 'help', 'very', 'easy', 'screw', 'up', 'video', 'clear', 'especially', 'early', 'stages', 'when', 'easy', 'damage', 'lower', 'sometimes', 'repair.The', 'video', 'also', 'do', 'right', 'should', 'invest', 'number', 'speciality', 'tools', 'cost', 'tools', 'punches', 'wrenches', 'receiver', 'block', 'etc', 'up', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Tri-State', 'area', 'can', 'spend', 'roughly', 'same', 'amount', 'money', 'Gun', 'Hire', 'Woodland', 'Park', 'NJ', 'will', 'work', 'one-on-one', 'design', 'order', 'parts', 'guide', 'build', 'using', 'right', 'tools']",Building Your AR-15 From Scratch
