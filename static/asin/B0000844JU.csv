733497,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B0000844JU,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","This set features the final episodes of the surprisingly good Mega Man cartoon series. While the first set was very good, here it all begins to fall apart.We continue following the blue bomber as he fights for peace against the maniacal Doctor Wily and his robot cohorts - cohorts invented by Doctor Light, Mega Man's ""father"". The first few episodes, where Bomb Man finally becomes part of the ensemble, are pretty good, especially the battleship episode. Once again, Roll is a joy to watch, not at all a damsel in distress but a headstrong female character that has a hand in saving the day. Guts Man is still a riot as the brawn of the evil and completely barking Doctor Wily. Rush is still an asset and a thorn in Mega Man's side, the adorable sidekick though he is. Mega Man still has that rather stereotyped superhero personality.Unfortunately, after a couple of episodes, something goes wrong. The first sign is a strange story about werewolf robots or something like that. Slowly and steadily, each episode becomes technically worse. The animation becomes incredibly stale, most unlike the production values up until this point. The episode premises become even worse. The show tries to tie in the Mega Man X storyline, with disastrous results (something involving time travel). Don't even get me started about the lion men episode... seriously, what was up with that?Overall, the first set is a far worthier purchase, possessing nearly all the meat of the series. However, there are some nice episodes on this set as well. It's worth the purchase for those. Just be prepared to get a whole lot of mess with them.",2,"The First Episodes are Alright - Then, Hoo Boy...",1287360000,"10 18, 2010",2010,1621,"['set', 'final', 'episodes', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Mega', 'Man', 'cartoon', 'series', 'first', 'set', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'fall', 'apart.We', 'continue', 'following', 'blue', 'bomber', 'peace', 'maniacal', 'Doctor', 'Wily', 'robot', 'cohorts', 'invented', 'Doctor', 'Light', 'Mega', 'Man', 'father', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'where', 'Bomb', 'Man', 'finally', 'part', 'ensemble', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'battleship', 'episode', 'Once', 'again', 'Roll', 'joy', 'watch', 'not', 'damsel', 'distress', 'headstrong', 'female', 'character', 'hand', 'saving', 'day', 'Guts', 'Man', 'still', 'riot', 'brawn', 'evil', 'completely', 'barking', 'Doctor', 'Wily', 'Rush', 'still', 'asset', 'thorn', 'Mega', 'Man', 'side', 'adorable', 'sidekick', 'Mega', 'Man', 'still', 'rather', 'stereotyped', 'superhero', 'personality.Unfortunately', 'couple', 'episodes', 'something', 'wrong', 'first', 'sign', 'strange', 'story', 'werewolf', 'robots', 'something', 'Slowly', 'steadily', 'episode', 'technically', 'worse', 'animation', 'incredibly', 'stale', 'most', 'production', 'up', 'point', 'episode', 'become', 'even', 'worse', 'show', 'tie', 'Mega', 'Man', 'X', 'storyline', 'disastrous', 'results', 'something', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'lion', 'men', 'episode', 'seriously', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'Overall', 'first', 'set', 'far', 'worthier', 'purchase', 'possessing', 'nearly', 'meat', 'series', 'However', 'are', 'nice', 'episodes', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'purchase', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'mess']",N/A

I think the show had some good points, the only reason why I bought these DVDs in the first place. The voice acting and animation are of decent quality. Too bad the storyline is rather weak in some episodes and terrible in others. I watch the bad episodes for laughs. I've seen some decent episodes considering the many flaws this series has.

733503,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B0000844JU,"Vicente Drago ""Shaun O'Donnell""","[6, 6]","This dvd is the final half to the megaman series which once again boasts incredible action with catchy music and comedy.  This continues the tale of Dr. Wily attempts to conquer the earth using his evil robots.  However each and everytime he is thwarted by Megaman.I already talked about the series in the first dvd release so now I am going to tell you about the one stand out episode which in my opinion is the best of the series.The episode is called Mega X and what it's about is that Wily is attempting to steal this new energy source to power up his super cannon.  After a failed attempt two reploids from the future arrive to steal some for their master Sigma.  When Megaman attempts to stop the two he is easily defeated.  Then through a rip in space and Time comes Megaman X who drives them away.  Eventually the two Megaman's team up to stop Wily and the reploids.What made this episode so great was that it not only was a crossover with the other megaman series but also hinted at the possability of a spinoff for Megaman X.  Sadly that never happened (the X story is generally a lot darker, more grown up than Megaman) but still this is a great episode.Overall a great buy short of any special features.  Still recommended though.",4,the final half of a great series,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",2004,1242,"['dvd', 'final', 'half', 'megaman', 'series', 'once', 'again', 'incredible', 'action', 'catchy', 'music', 'comedy', 'tale', 'Dr.', 'Wily', 'conquer', 'earth', 'using', 'evil', 'robots', 'However', 'everytime', 'thwarted', 'Megaman.I', 'already', 'talked', 'series', 'first', 'dvd', 'release', 'so', 'now', 'am', 'going', 'tell', 'one', 'stand', 'episode', 'opinion', 'best', 'series.The', 'episode', 'called', 'Mega', 'X', 'what', 'about', 'Wily', 'attempting', 'steal', 'new', 'energy', 'source', 'power', 'up', 'super', 'cannon', 'failed', 'attempt', 'two', 'reploids', 'future', 'arrive', 'steal', 'master', 'Sigma', 'When', 'Megaman', 'stop', 'two', 'easily', 'defeated', 'Then', 'rip', 'space', 'Time', 'Megaman', 'X', 'who', 'away', 'Eventually', 'two', 'Megaman', 'team', 'up', 'stop', 'Wily', 'reploids.What', 'made', 'episode', 'so', 'great', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'crossover', 'other', 'megaman', 'series', 'also', 'hinted', 'possability', 'spinoff', 'Megaman', 'X', 'Sadly', 'never', 'happened', 'X', 'story', 'generally', 'lot', 'darker', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'Megaman', 'still', 'great', 'episode.Overall', 'great', 'buy', 'short', 'special', 'features', 'Still', 'recommended']",N/A
