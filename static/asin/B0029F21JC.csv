1256824,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0029F21JC,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[7, 12]","For a taste of the Cold War at its height (and near its conclusion), Firefox is a great blast from the past.  They tried hard in the film to highlight all sorts of elements of the Soviet apparatus, including dissident scientists, Jews who were downtrodden and oppressed by the system, bureaucrats mindlessly following orders, the vastness of the country, and the intransigence of the pre-Gorbachev leadership.  The Soviet leader portrayed here is a kind of Breshnev-meets-Andropov figure, who is hoping for a technological leap above the Western powers.  This film also taps into the then-prevalent Western fears that the Soviets would make some kind of technological breakthrough that would tip the balance of power inexorably in their favour; of course, time would reveal that they were much more worried about our technological and economic advances with which they could never really compete.  But that's too complex for a film like this, which is already a spy-thriller, chase, and military adventure film rolled into one.  It succeeds for the most part on these levels - Clint Eastwood plays the still-having-flashbacks pilot drafted into the mission of stealing the new MIG-31, a plane so technologically advanced it can operate on mental commands, but limited enough that it would only recognise them in Russian (Eastwood played a pilot fluent in Russian).In a somewhat strange role, Nigel Hawthorne (one of my all-time favourite actors) played the key Russian scientist, reluctantly but effectively developing the technology, but just as effectively determined to help it be stolen.  Many of the other actors are British, including those playing Russians and those playing Americans.  All are reasonably effective, though there are few stellar performances here.The special effects are very good - John Dykstra of Star Wars fame produced many of the elements in this.  Scenes of flying in the cockpit and the dogfights between the planes are very effective; they were more dramatic, in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.In all, this is an interesting film, a bit overlooked now because time has moved on past the subject matter.  It is one of the earlier films produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who has gone on to much bigger and grander projects, but one can see his touch here.For the second film in this package, one also gets a later Cold War scenario, this time in the tropics rather than the frozen Siberian arctic.  Eastwood plays a tough-as-nails, no nonsense Gunny who has to whip a sadsack platoon of misfits into fighting Marines.  Good thing he's a Medal of Honor winner, something that irks his desk-bound, procurement specialist commander to no end.  There are lots of stereotypes here - no complete Gomer Pyles, but several close seconds.  Of course, the administrator/commander is against everything the Gunny wants to do, but the wiser general in the end saves the day for Gunny, as he and his platoon save the day for students trapped on the Caribbean island as Cubans try to take over.  And the film ends with a rousing parade, unlike the return from Vietnam.On the whole, two good killing-time films; far from great fare, but entertaining, especially for those who like a military theme (friends of mine in the USMC particularly like to sit and pick out the technical problems with Heartbreak Ridge!).",4,"Cold War, times two...",1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3390,"['taste', 'Cold', 'War', 'height', 'conclusion', 'Firefox', 'great', 'blast', 'past', 'tried', 'hard', 'film', 'highlight', 'sorts', 'elements', 'Soviet', 'apparatus', 'including', 'dissident', 'scientists', 'Jews', 'who', 'were', 'downtrodden', 'oppressed', 'system', 'mindlessly', 'following', 'orders', 'vastness', 'country', 'intransigence', 'pre-Gorbachev', 'leadership', 'Soviet', 'leader', 'portrayed', 'here', 'kind', 'Breshnev-meets-Andropov', 'figure', 'who', 'hoping', 'technological', 'leap', 'Western', 'powers', 'film', 'also', 'then-prevalent', 'Western', 'fears', 'Soviets', 'would', 'make', 'kind', 'technological', 'breakthrough', 'would', 'tip', 'balance', 'power', 'inexorably', 'favour', 'course', 'time', 'would', 'reveal', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'worried', 'technological', 'economic', 'advances', 'could', 'never', 'really', 'compete', 'too', 'complex', 'film', 'already', 'spy-thriller', 'chase', 'military', 'adventure', 'film', 'rolled', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'levels', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'still-having-flashbacks', 'pilot', 'drafted', 'mission', 'stealing', 'new', 'MIG-31', 'plane', 'so', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'can', 'operate', 'mental', 'commands', 'limited', 'enough', 'would', 'only', 'recognise', 'Russian', 'Eastwood', 'played', 'pilot', 'fluent', 'Russian', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'role', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'one', 'all-time', 'favourite', 'actors', 'played', 'key', 'Russian', 'scientist', 'reluctantly', 'effectively', 'developing', 'technology', 'just', 'effectively', 'determined', 'help', 'be', 'stolen', 'Many', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'British', 'including', 'playing', 'Russians', 'playing', 'Americans', 'are', 'reasonably', 'effective', 'are', 'few', 'stellar', 'performances', 'here.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'John', 'Dykstra', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fame', 'produced', 'many', 'elements', 'Scenes', 'flying', 'cockpit', 'dogfights', 'planes', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'were', 'more', 'dramatic', 'honesty', 'Top', 'Gun', 'came', 'along', 'remain', 'rather', 'good', 'even', 'comparison.In', 'interesting', 'film', 'bit', 'overlooked', 'now', 'time', 'moved', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'earlier', 'films', 'produced', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'gone', 'much', 'bigger', 'grander', 'projects', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'touch', 'here.For', 'second', 'film', 'package', 'one', 'also', 'later', 'Cold', 'War', 'scenario', 'time', 'tropics', 'rather', 'frozen', 'Siberian', 'arctic', 'Eastwood', 'tough-as-nails', 'nonsense', 'Gunny', 'who', 'whip', 'sadsack', 'platoon', 'misfits', 'fighting', 'Marines', 'Good', 'thing', 'Medal', 'Honor', 'winner', 'something', 'desk-bound', 'procurement', 'specialist', 'commander', 'end', 'are', 'lots', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'complete', 'Gomer', 'Pyles', 'several', 'close', 'seconds', 'course', 'administrator/commander', 'everything', 'Gunny', 'do', 'wiser', 'general', 'end', 'day', 'Gunny', 'platoon', 'save', 'day', 'students', 'trapped', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'Cubans', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'film', 'rousing', 'parade', 'return', 'Vietnam.On', 'whole', 'two', 'good', 'killing-time', 'films', 'far', 'great', 'fare', 'entertaining', 'especially', 'who', 'like', 'military', 'theme', 'friends', 'mine', 'USMC', 'particularly', 'sit', 'pick', 'out', 'technical', 'problems', 'Heartbreak', 'Ridge']",Two-Movie Collection: Firefox / Heartbreak Ridge

There are some very cool moments in this film although I could have done without the flash backs.Heartbreak Ridge is a campy Full Metal Jacket that doesn't even deserve that comparison.

I have read both the Firefox books and I am only sorry that they did not make the second book onto a movie.  It completes getting the Firefox back home and is more exciting than the first book.  Let's just say the dogfight at the end of the first movie wounded the Firefox and as it flies away there is a vapor trail behind it.  It can't make it back home.  Nuff said, get the book it is great.Heartbreak Ridge is another good one for Eastwood.  The old Marine, set in his way, getting it done and staying alive.
