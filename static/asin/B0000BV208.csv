770806,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0000BV208,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","This movie has a typical premise for a Christmas romance. A widow who lives on a farm is struggling to pay off her late husband's debt. Through a series of mishaps, mostly dealing with weather, the bank manager who has gone to deliver foreclosure papers ends up stuck at her house on Christmas eve. The rest of the movie becomes a typical fish-out-of-water romance in which the guy ends up seeing the woman's predicament as well as falling in love with her. The ending is fairly predictable. Unfortunately, most of the scenes in the movie are extremely drab and depressing. While this helps play up the poverty aspect, it doesn't leave much charm to add to the Christmas spirit. It makes the whole move feel depressing and without much hope. Also, while the characters seem fairly likable, they don't end up having much chemistry. This is one of those movies where you end up wondering how the two actually fell in love. This is somewhat of an old TV movie, so you can forgive some of the mediocre production quality, but all in all, it's not a very uplifting or happy movie, in spite of the intended happy message. There are plenty of other nice B movies out there that are about Christmas romances. Unless you are a fan of Olivia Newton John, it's probably best to take a pass on this one.",3,Near Miss,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1291,"['movie', 'typical', 'premise', 'Christmas', 'romance', 'widow', 'who', 'farm', 'struggling', 'pay', 'off', 'late', 'husband', 'debt', 'series', 'mishaps', 'mostly', 'dealing', 'weather', 'bank', 'manager', 'who', 'gone', 'deliver', 'foreclosure', 'papers', 'up', 'stuck', 'house', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'rest', 'movie', 'typical', 'fish-out-of-water', 'romance', 'guy', 'up', 'seeing', 'woman', 'predicament', 'as', 'well', 'falling', 'love', 'ending', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'extremely', 'drab', 'depressing', 'play', 'up', 'poverty', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'leave', 'much', 'charm', 'add', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'whole', 'move', 'feel', 'depressing', 'much', 'hope', 'Also', 'characters', 'seem', 'fairly', 'likable', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'having', 'much', 'chemistry', 'one', 'movies', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'how', 'two', 'actually', 'fell', 'love', 'somewhat', 'old', 'TV', 'movie', 'can', 'forgive', 'mediocre', 'production', 'quality', 'not', 'very', 'uplifting', 'happy', 'movie', 'spite', 'intended', 'happy', 'message', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'nice', 'B', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'are', 'Christmas', 'romances', 'are', 'fan', 'Olivia', 'Newton', 'John', 'probably', 'best', 'take', 'pass', 'one']",N/A

I have a long-beloved collection of classics.  I watch, and add to my collection, every year--and I keep the movies that are worth watching each season.  I couldn't even bear to watch A Christmas Romance for more than 20 minutes!  Tin-soldier-y music played every moment the characters weren't dialoguing (and it was really ANNOYING music).  The acting felt forced and contrived.  In addition, the movie was oddly introduced by a collage of blurry snapshots (pics taken from the movie reel)--and then it started abruptly as soon as the snapshots were done (although, the movie, itself, was not blurry). Don't waste your money.  Much better fare is available to choose from--even among the made-for-television movies.  Silent Night (based on a true story) with Linda Hamilton is just plain extraordinary!  A Christmas Carol with Patrick Stewart is a joy to watch--and my favorite version of a Christmas Carol.  A Season for Miracles is my (and my daughters) favorite Christmas movie (and well worth the money).  A Song for the Season is REALLY well-acted, and the story, well-done.  Even lighter movies like Angel in the Family, The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, and The Christmas Card are worth watching over and over--and investments I happily held onto.
