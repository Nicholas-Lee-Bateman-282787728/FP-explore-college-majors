Hilary is such a mouse, so co-dependent that she can refuse star sister Jackie nothing, including her own husband.  Jackie as played by the brilliant  Emily Watson is all frustration, anger, and nervous energy.  She is  wonderful to watch in all of her character progressions, even though she  makes Jackie as a character quite unlikeable.

465347,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305447233,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I love a good biopic, truly adore them.  Every once in a while a biopic comes along so outstanding in its power and presence and emotional connection that my love for the every popular genre is reconfirmed to the enth degree.  `Hilary & Jackie' is that type of movie, a film that swells with the grace and glory of love and passion as well as the moving aspects of pain and misery.  I will admit to having not known a whole lot of the du Pre sisters before watching this beautiful film, but my adoration of everything Emily Watson caused me to seek it out and watch it.  Not only is Watson stellar (and so deserving of that Oscar nomination) but the entire film is handled with such delicacy and devotion that one can't help but become swept away as it progresses towards its devastating, yet affirming, end.`Hilary & Jackie' tells the story of Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, two talented young sisters growing up in a home that makes music the focal part of their existence.  We are given an overview of the young lives of both Hilary and Jackie, Hilary the eldest and at the moment more talented of the sisters.  Hilary is a flautist who has won award upon award, and her young sister Jackie just wants to be included with her sister at all times, so she practices her cello and perfects her craft to where soon she is rising above her sister in talent and in recognition.  The film then shifts gears to their later life when Hilary has practically given up on her music to start a family with her fianc&eacute; Kiffer and Jackie is now world renowned and unhappily settled into a life of fame.The film is split in sections and tells the same portion of the girls lives through the eyes of each, giving Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths equal time to astound the audience.  Watson undoubtedly has the showier role.  Jackie is repressed by her talent, struggling every day to find herself in her music.  She loves to play, needs to play, but the pressure to perform eats away at her to the point where she begins to resent it in a way.  As the film progresses and her health starts to evaporate her performance becomes even more pivotal to the success of the film, and she delivers masterfully.  This is nothing against Griffiths though, who devours her characters restrained passion, a passion that has been suppressed by the talent of her younger sister.  You can read in her eyes the resentment for her lot in life, yet her undying love for her sister overpowers any and all other emotions in her life.  She is committed to her sister, even if it means sacrificing her own happiness.While Watson and Griffiths are without doubt the biggest selling points of the film, they are accompanied by a slew of phenomenal supporting performances.  Charles Dance and Celia Imrie are amazing as Hilary and Jackie's parents, and David Morrissey is fantastic as Kiffer, Hilary's husband.Some have attacked this film for being untrue and or `stretching' facts, but my question to them is `what biopic doesn't do that?'  In all honesty in order to make most non-fiction engrossing to the general public Hollywood has to add layers of fiction in order to embellish truths.  Fact remains that simple sequences of silence cannot capture exactly what is going on in someone's head (sure, an actor can emote a feeling with their facial features but one cannot emote a specific thought) and so to complain that the film shows Jackie abuse her cello and yet she (according to you) never did is kind of petty when her resentment of her fame alone would have moved her to wish harm done to the very thing that is causing her grief, her cello.  She may have never actually placed it out in the cold, but director's decision to include that scene was an attempt to further impress upon the audience Jackie's mental condition at the time.  It may not be true, but does it really need to be.As far as the supposed `hokiness' of the opening (and closing) beach sequence I have only this to say; ""you missed the point.""  As one reviewer mentioned, the film hints towards a slight psychic connection between the girls (as is common among twins and has been known to express itself in `close' siblings) and this little detail adds a layer to the genius surrounding these two talents.  I think that the opening and closing sequences add closure to the film and actually brought a tear to my eye.In my opinion the few areas of inaccuracy within the film (granted I have not read the book and am basically going off of what some reviewers have mentioned as falsities within the film) shouldn't deter anyone from embracing the movie for what it is.  It tells the tragic tale of the du Pre sisters (I think we can all agree it was tragic in a touching sort of way) and I think that in the end it paints a beautiful picture of unrivaled love between siblings that endured to the end despite any persons faults.",5,"A very touching and moving film about passion, devotion and above all else; love...",1218067200,"08 7, 2008",2008,4875,"['love', 'good', 'biopic', 'truly', 'once', 'while', 'biopic', 'along', 'so', 'outstanding', 'power', 'presence', 'emotional', 'connection', 'love', 'popular', 'genre', 'reconfirmed', 'enth', 'degree', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'type', 'movie', 'film', 'grace', 'glory', 'love', 'passion', 'as', 'well', 'moving', 'aspects', 'pain', 'misery', 'will', 'admit', 'having', 'not', 'known', 'whole', 'lot', 'du', 'Pre', 'sisters', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'film', 'adoration', 'everything', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'caused', 'seek', 'out', 'watch', 'Not', 'only', 'Watson', 'stellar', 'so', 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'entire', 'film', 'handled', 'such', 'delicacy', 'devotion', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'become', 'swept', 'away', 'devastating', 'yet', 'affirming', 'end.', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'story', 'Hilary', 'Jacqueline', 'du', 'Pre', 'two', 'talented', 'young', 'sisters', 'growing', 'up', 'home', 'music', 'focal', 'part', 'existence', 'are', 'given', 'overview', 'young', 'lives', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'Hilary', 'eldest', 'moment', 'more', 'talented', 'sisters', 'Hilary', 'flautist', 'who', 'won', 'award', 'award', 'young', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'just', 'be', 'included', 'sister', 'times', 'practices', 'cello', 'craft', 'where', 'soon', 'rising', 'sister', 'talent', 'recognition', 'film', 'then', 'gears', 'later', 'life', 'when', 'Hilary', 'practically', 'given', 'up', 'music', 'start', 'family', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Kiffer', 'Jackie', 'now', 'world', 'renowned', 'unhappily', 'settled', 'life', 'fame.The', 'film', 'split', 'sections', 'same', 'portion', 'girls', 'eyes', 'giving', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'equal', 'time', 'astound', 'audience', 'Watson', 'undoubtedly', 'showier', 'role', 'Jackie', 'repressed', 'talent', 'struggling', 'day', 'find', 'music', 'play', 'needs', 'play', 'pressure', 'perform', 'eats', 'away', 'point', 'where', 'resent', 'way', 'film', 'progresses', 'health', 'evaporate', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'pivotal', 'success', 'film', 'masterfully', 'nothing', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'characters', 'restrained', 'passion', 'passion', 'been', 'suppressed', 'talent', 'younger', 'sister', 'can', 'read', 'eyes', 'resentment', 'lot', 'life', 'yet', 'undying', 'love', 'sister', 'overpowers', 'other', 'emotions', 'life', 'committed', 'sister', 'even', 'sacrificing', 'own', 'happiness.While', 'Watson', 'Griffiths', 'are', 'doubt', 'biggest', 'selling', 'points', 'film', 'are', 'accompanied', 'slew', 'phenomenal', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Celia', 'Imrie', 'are', 'amazing', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'parents', 'David', 'Morrissey', 'fantastic', 'Kiffer', 'Hilary', 'husband.Some', 'have', 'attacked', 'film', 'being', 'untrue', 'stretching', 'facts', 'question', 'what', 'biopic', ""n't"", 'do', 'honesty', 'order', 'make', 'most', 'non-fiction', 'engrossing', 'general', 'public', 'Hollywood', 'add', 'layers', 'fiction', 'order', 'embellish', 'truths', 'Fact', 'simple', 'sequences', 'silence', 'can', 'not', 'capture', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'someone', 'head', 'sure', 'actor', 'can', 'emote', 'feeling', 'facial', 'features', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'emote', 'specific', 'thought', 'so', 'complain', 'film', 'Jackie', 'cello', 'yet', 'according', 'never', 'did', 'kind', 'petty', 'when', 'resentment', 'fame', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'moved', 'wish', 'harm', 'done', 'very', 'thing', 'causing', 'grief', 'cello', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'actually', 'placed', 'out', 'cold', 'director', 'decision', 'include', 'scene', 'was', 'attempt', 'further', 'impress', 'audience', 'Jackie', 'mental', 'condition', 'time', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'really', 'need', 'be.As', 'far', 'supposed', 'hokiness', 'opening', 'closing', 'beach', 'sequence', 'have', 'only', 'say', 'missed', 'point', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'film', 'hints', 'slight', 'psychic', 'connection', 'girls', 'common', 'twins', 'been', 'known', 'express', 'close', 'siblings', 'little', 'detail', 'layer', 'genius', 'surrounding', 'two', 'talents', 'think', 'opening', 'closing', 'sequences', 'add', 'closure', 'film', 'actually', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye.In', 'opinion', 'few', 'areas', 'inaccuracy', 'film', 'granted', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'basically', 'going', 'what', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'falsities', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'deter', 'anyone', 'embracing', 'movie', 'what', 'tragic', 'tale', 'du', 'Pre', 'sisters', 'think', 'can', 'agree', 'was', 'tragic', 'touching', 'sort', 'way', 'think', 'end', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'unrivaled', 'love', 'siblings', 'endured', 'end', 'persons', 'faults']",Hilary & Jackie

465349,A358XP3X4U0X45,6305447233,bookloversfriend,"[45, 51]","I am amazed when I read people condemning various things based on this movie.  Some condemn Hilary.  Some (like the Amazon reviewer) condemn the book itself--obviously without having first taken the trouble to read the book.  Some condemn what went on sexually.To set the record straight (from the book and from another biography of Jackie):The book does not ""dish dirt"" on Jackie.  Quite the contrary.There is not the slightest hint that the grown-up Hilary was jealous of Jackie (though she was briefly as a child).  Both she and Jackie saw the many disadvantages of Jackie's fame.  Hilary expresses relief that it is not her life.  Jackie expresses envy of Hilary's happy life.  She hated being pushed into concert tours by her ambitious husband, Barenboim.  She often simply rebelled and left.Hilary did not ""give permission"" for her husband to sleep with Jackie.  Jackie was terribly upset and ran away across the fields.  She asked Kiffer to have sex with her and he did because she thought it would help her.  Kiffer told Hilary about it as soon as they returned.  (What is covered up by the clumsy, ""arty"" anti-chronological approach of this movie is that Jackie had ALREADY noticed that her hands were sometimes numb!  Imagine the effect that must have had on a cellist!)The nonsense in the movie about Jackie losing her mind is garbage made up by the screenwriter.  AT NO TIME did Jackie think that she was crazy.  The idiot psychoanalyst that Hilary and Kiffer finally referred her to when they saw that the sex wasn't really helping Jackie thought that Jackie's numbness was hysterical (all in her mind).  Jackie NEVER believed that.  And no one in real life thought that she had any other psychopathological symptoms.The bits about Jackie's abusing her cello are also garbage made up by the screenwriter.  She loved her Strad.  She never left it out in the cold.  She was a vigorous performer and the Strad sometimes collapsed under her playing and had to go to the shop, but that was not deliberate abuse.The insults in the movie--viz. Jackie telling Hilary that she was not special--are also totally made up by the screenwriter.The drum incident at the BBC.  Jackie was not allowed to play a real instrument because the BBC had a minimum age requirement for performers and Jackie was too young.  Jackie was never jealous of Hilary's playing.  Jackie practiced because she loved to play.The portrayal of the flute teacher at the Royal Academy of Music was accurate.  Moreover, Hilary's daughter Claire took up the cello, won the Suggia Prize at 11, the same age as Jackie, and went to the R. A. M.  After one year, she quit the cello and never played again!  I hope somebody in England is looking into the Royal Academy of Music and their ability to drive away talented musicians.Well, enough.  Read the book if you want to know what happened.  Don't condemn Hilary or condemn Jackie because of what is in this movie.  Condemn the movie.  They had the facts.  Why did they make these deliberate distortions?I've also read that Barenboim condemned this film as untrue.  Well he might, considering what the movie reveals about him.  But wait!  Read the other biography, the one commissioned by Barenboim himself, and the facts get even worse: Before Barenboim accepted the conductorship of the Orchestre de Paris and moved to Paris (leaving Jackie to cope with her illness as best she could), he had been offered the London Symphony Orchestra and turned it down!  His leaving was therefore not a job necessity (as the movie implies)!  And both biographies agree with the film in revealing that Barenboim did shack up with another woman in Paris and proceed to have two kids (while Jackie struggled on alone in London with her crippling illness).Yes, buy the recordings!  Yes, buy the two documentary films and see the real Jackie.  Emily Watson gave a good performance, she was just not right for the part.  She does not have the face, the strength of character, the commanding presence that the real Jackie had.And if you haven't seen this movie, see it.  Just take it with a grain--with a couple of spoonfuls--of salt.Footnote: the ""widescreen"" is achieved by blocking out the top and bottom of the scene.  It is no wider than the standard.

""Daniel""","[2, 6]","Second movie of British director Anand Tucker, HILARY &amp; JACKIE is an absolutely must see for those of you (I hope there's at least one survivor !) who appreciate the filmed biographies genre. HILARY &amp; JACKIE's  screenplay has been inspired by the book A GENIUS IN THE FAMILY, written by  Hilary and Piers du Pr&eacute;, respectively sister and brother of the famous  cellist Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; who died a few years ago at the age of 42.One  follows the common beginnings, the separation from her family, the musical  triumphs of Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;, her marriage with the great pianist Daniel  Barenboim, her battle with the terrible illness she has suffered from and,  finally, her last days in complete loneliness. But that's of public  notoriety and is only the spinal column of a movie that plunges in the  intimate feelings of the two sisters.Beautiful, gifted and young,  Jacqueline du Pr&eacute; had everything to be happy but, if you take her sister's  opinion for granted, she was not. She had given her body and her soul to  the cello that was her companion through her life. Under the camera of  Anand Tucker, this cello will become a subtle metaphor of the torments of  the artist. The numerous scenes involving a Jackie unable to communicate  (foreign languages, inaccurate phone numbers, illness) leave also a bitter  taste in our mouth ; the music has eaten alive this genius.And last but  not least, you will find in HILARY &amp; JACKIE a first class  cinematography one wouldn't have expected to find in such a movie. Director  Anand Tucker has without doubt the future for him.

And I found that many  things are missing from the original movie. Especially the part when the  two sisters were young. For example, I remember the Jackie's screaming when  she found the Cello in the morning on her 5th birthday. Where are all those  things gone ? Very disappointing video production.

""Hilary and Jackie"" is an exceptionally well done character study of two real life sisters.  Jackie (Emily Watson) is a world-class cellist and Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) lives a normal middle class life.  The story is rich in character development depicting the sisters starting from their childhood when both were musical prodigies.  Now that they are adults, they envy each other's life.  The story follows Jackie's career and explores the sisters' relationship, including the deep resentment and enduring love they have for one another.  Director Anand Tucker does a wonderful job of presenting the story.  He induces great feeling from each scene and lays the raw emotions on the screen without embellishment whether pure or turbulent.Emily Watson was superb in the lead role.  Her's was an extremely complex character and her command of the range of emotions Jackie required was phenomenal.  Lovers of classical music will appreciate the rich soundtrack and Watson's realistic cello renditions.  Watson was nominated for best actress by the Academy in 1999 for this performance and I felt she was most deserving of the prize that ultimately went to Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Shakespeare in Love"".  Paltrow's performance was clever and charming, but had nowhere near the power Watson delivered in this film.  Emily is such a talented actress, however, that I have little doubt eventually there will be some other envelope with her name inside.Rachel Griffiths also gave a career performance as Hilary and she was nominated for best supporting actress, an award I felt she won hands down.  Griffiths' tortured performance was gut wrenching and inspired.  She played Hilary with deep sensitivity and handled her emotional conflicts brilliantly.  The Academy's choice of Judy Dench was again perplexing as the Shakespeare juggernaut rolled on.For those viewers who appreciate a powerful and disturbing drama, great acting, complex characters, terrific classical music and extraordinary character development, this film is a must.

465357,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6305447233,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 8]","While I often post reviews of films I've only seen once, I sometimes wonder how wise that really is.  When I saw this film on the big screen several years ago, I rather disliked it.  It didn't ring true for me overall (not that I can pretend to KNOW the actual story as some of the film's critics claimed at the time--but then again, at least, I didn't mistakenly think it was about the historic meeting of two former First Ladies).  But it does seem wise to be little skeptical about bio-pics, however, and this one just did not get off to a good start with me.  In fact, I'm surprised that none of the other reviews I've read of HILARY AND JACKIE seemed to have much quarrel with the opening sequence of the two protagonists as children frolicking on the beach.  When they see a strange woman staring at the ocean, the younger, seemingly more impulsive blonde child breaks away from her sister and approaches the ""stranger.""""Ohmigawd,"" I said to my wife, ""I can't believe this.  She's meeting up  with her adult self.""  Now, in all fairness, that's not revealed with 100% clarity until the very end of the movie (give the filmmakers credit for that much subtlety at least), but what else could it be?  And how much hokier could it be?  Young Jackie does tell her sister what ""the stranger"" told her.  Namely, that it would be ""all right.""  How TWILIGHT ZONE can you get?  And how much more manipulative?But the movie got enough good press and additional acclaim over the years, that I decided that I would watch it again and see if I couldn't get over this particular hurdle.  Given that I knew it was coming, I found--perhaps not too surprisingly--that I could.  And watching it at home, on a smaller screen, I found some of the other cinematic cliches that I felt bogged the movie down the first time out were also forgivable.  Overall, in fact, it held together pretty well.Interesting in a way, that I found I liked it better on the small screen, since some of the films harshest critics seem to have found it too much like an ""illness of the week"" TV movie.  I actually don't object to that kind of TV film myself and find that they often give actors a chance to shine.  Television is, in many ways, a more intimate medium than the cinema (I forget which one McLuhan said was the ""cooler"" medium, but is seems self-evident that the small screen typically makes for a more intimate experience than we typically get in a movie house.Thus the smaller scaled HILARY AND JACKIE did work for me.  The story that had somehow seemed cliched (even if based on a true story) when I first saw it during its first run, seemed relatively direct and honest when I saw it again in my living room.  And I cannot say for certain now why I initially thought Emily Watson's performance was too mannered.  On second viewing, she seemed fine.  Jackie apparently adopted certain affectations of her own (such as strange accents), which gave Watson the challenge of portraying her character's artifice in an authentic way.  For the most part, she pulls it off rather well.The RASHOMON quality the picture exhibited in its different (symphonic-like) segments also lends the picture a certain richness.  The truth of anyone's real life story is hard to know, of course.  Few viewers expect the absolute truth from a film biography, of course.  But on a deeper level, the film challenges the memories and the individual perspectives of nearly all its characters.  Who really said what?  And just what was actually said?  If the two protagonists' take on the ""truth"" is dubious, I guess it goes without saying that the filmmakers' take is open to question too.And that's what makes Hilary and Jackie's respective segments work as well as they do.  What appear to be  totally selfish acts on Jackie's part (e.g. mailing her washing home while on a whirlwind tour) turns out to have a different significance when portrayed from her point of view (namely that it's a way of reaching out to her family and recapturing a sense of ""what home smells like"").  Of course, enclosing a card or a letter would have helped.By establishing that much ambiguity, director Anand Morgan and screenwriter Frank Cottrall Boyce successfully move their film beyond ""the artist as outsider"" cliches that, on first viewing, may seem to threaten it.  They are, in a sense, fortunate to have source material that apparently grants them that ambiguity (Hilary and brother Piers' book).  Was Jackie's outrageous behavior due to suppressed rage at her family and the world?  Was it just artistic temperament run amok? Or was a good part of it, her incipient illness.  Even viewers like me, who knew only the barest outlines of DuPre's life and career, had to wonder just what drove Jackie to such extreme behavior as demanding to sleep with her sister's husband.  How much was sheer self-indulgence, how much was a self-conscious acting out of the ""difficult artist"" role, and how much was a kind of genuine madness. Finally, how much of it WAS her illness?  Rhetorical questions all.  Viewer's of the film can never know.  People in Jacqueline DuPre's actual life can probably only make their best guesses too.Which brings us back to the childhood sequences that, as it turns out, frame the movie.  A review I read of Hilary and Piers DuPre's book indicated that Jackie did indeed have an eery childhood premonition of the illness that would cripple her in her adult life.  Apparently, she once told her sister, ""Don't tell Mum, but when I grow up I won't be able to walk or move.""  Why this spooky presentiment, which seems pretty dramatic to me, was discarded in favor of the trumped up ""mystery lady on the beach"" scene is beyond me.  Handled right, a brief scene of Jackie as a child making that stunning prediction would likely have been downright bonechilling.The two ""Jackies"" on the beach was less than that.",3,The Presence of

From the very beginning of the film there is a looming foreboding and an uncomfortable uneasiness that follows through every frame in this account of the lives of sisters Hilary and Jackie Du Pre. Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson are each disturbingly terrific and I am always amazed at the incredible performances.No small wonder that each actress has gone on to such acclaim in their respective careers.It is essential to remember that this screenplay is adapted from Hilary and Piers Du Pre's account A GENIUS IN THE FAMILY.The book as well as the film is extremely intimate and disturbing at best. What is positively fascinating is how this film 's narrative runs. The story commences with a portrait of the two sisters and their childhood as musical prodigies together. Then the film diverges in their teen years and tells the remaining story and timeline through each of the sisters' perspectives with gut wrenching honesty that balances each girl. Though I was well acquainted with the music of Cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and her husband pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim as a conservatory student in the 1970's, it is not really essential to know anything about music or these people to be totally immersed in a truly good story that is informative and very revealing about the mechanics of genius, motivation and family.If you offended by the exposing of warts and ""speaking ill of the dead"" perhaps HILARY AND JACKIE will not be for you. If you are willing to accept that this account of the lives of the Du Pre sisters COULD be true, then by all means come with an open mind and be blown away by what you see!

What I'd like to add is that the book on which it is based, written by Hilary du Pre, despite the attacks it received from the British press, is a much more evenhanded account of the two sisters' complex relationship than the melodramatic events portrayed in the film, many of which appear to have been invented from whole cloth (though not the central, titillating assertion that Hilary and Jackie shared more than most sisters).In addition, Daniel Barenboim, pianist, conductor and du Pre's real-life husband, refused to cooperate with the making of this film in any way, including giving licensing permission to use du Pre's actual recordings. Thus, with one exception, the cello playing in the film (very competent, to be sure) is by a totally different artist. This, together with Emily Watson's notably unskillful pantomiming of du Pre playing the cello, seems to sum up the falseness behind the concept and execution of this entire project.

It trashed one of the longest term endearing stars of that industry, cellist Jacqueline DuPre, and presented her now famous husband, conductor Daniel Barenboim, as something of a milquetoast character befuddled by Jackie's bitchy ways, paranoia and disease.It included scenes with portrayals of other real life musicians including Pinchas Zukerman, who made legendary recordings with the pair.What most people in the industry most hated (aside from the wayward portrayal of the hero) was the way Emily Watson acted out the final days of DuPre, whose career ended prematurely as a a result of multiple sclerosis, which led to her death at an early age. ""Hasn't she already suffered enough?"" asked a critical review of the film in American Record Guide.Still today DuPre is revered in England, her homeland, for her musical artistry. Her recordings maintain the stamp of a genius who died young. She is ranked up there with other young geniuses that died young like Ferenc Friscay and William Kapell.She is so popular in England that her famous recording of Edward Elgar's Victorian-era cello concerto was ranked the second greatest recording of the 20th century in the 2000 reader poll by Gramophone magazine, a beacon of classical music on both sides of the Atlantic.So the people of classical music, who perhaps cling to their memories of living legends more closely than patrons of any art form, could not reconcile the idea that this artist was such a bitch, twit and bad wife. Surely she must have been a porcelain angel!No way, according to this biopic. Right from a young age she was competitive with her older, then more talented sister. She fought for more love from her parents and demanded the attention of everyone that would watch. She turned into an erratic adult whose artistry was unquestioned but whose personal affectations alienated many. Or so says the biopic, anyway.THe scenes of her death are painful and probably too real for most people to handle. It was difficult for me to sit through those scenes first time I saw this movie. It is a reality flick of a life come undone by a disease no one can tackle in graphic portrayals.I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a compelling drama about real life people.

465364,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6305447233,Lawyeraau,"[17, 26]","This is an outstanding film with bravura performances by all the actors and actresses who grace it. Emily Watson is dazzling as world renowned cellist, Jacqueline Du Pre, and Rachel Griffiths gives a heartwarming portrayal of Hilary, the more grounded Du Pre sister. British director Anand Tucker does a masterful job of capturing and exploring the often complex and symbiotic relationship between these two sisters, one of whom reaches heights in the music world of which most may only dream.Most of the film is bifurcated in that it is told from the perspective of each of the sisters, with the same scenarios being viewed through the eyes of one sister at any given time. The film opens with a scene of the young sisters playing on the beach, with an enigmatic adult figure on the shore whom the younger of the sisters, Jackie, approaches. They speak, but what transpires between the young Jackie and this solitary figure is only made manifest at the conclusion of the film.The viewer is then thrust into the Du Pre household, where it is clear that their lives revolve around music, with Jackie playing the cello and Hilary the flute. A pivotal moment in the film occurs when Hilary is invited to participate in a televised children's concert, and Jackie is not. Jackie is told by their mother that if she wishes to get such an invitation that she must play better.This is an edict that Jackie takes to heart and adopts with abandon, becoming relentless in her devotion to the cello, until it is she, and not Hilary, who becomes the one in demand and the one to whom slavish attention is given. This is a portent of things to come. Therein lies the seed for the subtle rivalry that is to last their entire lives, though they remain as close as two sisters can be. Jackie goes on to become one of the world's most renowned cellists.That Hilary sublimates herself to her sister is obvious, even when ballroom dancing together, as it is Jackie who leads Hilary. This was to remain the pattern for most of their respective lives. While the shy and seemingly insecure Hilary eventually marries a man who makes her feel special and important, it is Jackie who continues to dazzle, even in the marriage arena, marrying a world class pianist with whom she makes beautiful music, until she is struck by a fatal illness.As Jackie's world spirals out of control, Hilary is leading the placid life of a country squiress, having children and playing at local concerts, happily married to a man who is clearly devoted to her. Jackie intrudes on their idyllic life, and in her frenetic fashion turns their world upside down during a visit sans her husband, when she obviously horns in on Hilary's husband. What happens next is sure to shock even the most jaded of viewers.As Jackie grows more successful in the music world, her personal life spirals out of control. Her passion for the cello is often countermanded by the pains she takes to try to divest herself of the demanding instrument that seemingly controls her life, as her passion and musical genius begin to consume her to the exclusion of all else. Her tortured soul is finally set free, when she succumbs to her fatal illness, a lonely and tragic figure at the end, mourned most of all by Hilary.This is a movie that music lovers and anyone who loves a beautifully directed and well-acted film will appreciate and enjoy.",5,AS CLOSE AS TWO SISTERS CAN BE...,1041638400,"01 4, 2003",2003,3371,"['outstanding', 'film', 'bravura', 'performances', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'grace', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'dazzling', 'world', 'renowned', 'cellist', 'Jacqueline', 'Du', 'Pre', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'heartwarming', 'portrayal', 'Hilary', 'more', 'grounded', 'Du', 'Pre', 'sister', 'British', 'director', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'masterful', 'job', 'capturing', 'exploring', 'often', 'complex', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'two', 'sisters', 'one', 'whom', 'reaches', 'heights', 'music', 'world', 'most', 'may', 'only', 'dream.Most', 'film', 'bifurcated', 'told', 'perspective', 'sisters', 'same', 'scenarios', 'being', 'viewed', 'eyes', 'one', 'sister', 'given', 'time', 'film', 'scene', 'young', 'sisters', 'playing', 'beach', 'enigmatic', 'adult', 'figure', 'shore', 'whom', 'younger', 'sisters', 'Jackie', 'approaches', 'speak', 'what', 'young', 'Jackie', 'solitary', 'figure', 'only', 'made', 'manifest', 'conclusion', 'film.The', 'viewer', 'then', 'thrust', 'Du', 'Pre', 'household', 'where', 'clear', 'lives', 'revolve', 'music', 'Jackie', 'playing', 'cello', 'Hilary', 'flute', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Hilary', 'invited', 'participate', 'televised', 'children', 'concert', 'Jackie', 'not', 'Jackie', 'told', 'mother', 'get', 'such', 'invitation', 'must', 'play', 'better.This', 'edict', 'Jackie', 'heart', 'adopts', 'abandon', 'becoming', 'relentless', 'devotion', 'cello', 'not', 'Hilary', 'who', 'one', 'demand', 'one', 'whom', 'slavish', 'attention', 'given', 'portent', 'things', 'come', 'Therein', 'seed', 'subtle', 'rivalry', 'last', 'entire', 'lives', 'remain', 'as', 'close', 'two', 'sisters', 'can', 'be', 'Jackie', 'become', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'renowned', 'cellists.That', 'Hilary', 'sister', 'obvious', 'even', 'when', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'together', 'Jackie', 'who', 'Hilary', 'was', 'remain', 'pattern', 'most', 'respective', 'lives', 'shy', 'seemingly', 'insecure', 'Hilary', 'eventually', 'man', 'who', 'feel', 'special', 'important', 'Jackie', 'who', 'dazzle', 'even', 'marriage', 'arena', 'marrying', 'world', 'class', 'pianist', 'whom', 'beautiful', 'music', 'struck', 'fatal', 'illness.As', 'Jackie', 'world', 'control', 'Hilary', 'leading', 'placid', 'life', 'country', 'squiress', 'having', 'children', 'playing', 'local', 'concerts', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'devoted', 'Jackie', 'intrudes', 'idyllic', 'life', 'frenetic', 'fashion', 'world', 'down', 'visit', 'husband', 'when', 'obviously', 'Hilary', 'husband', 'What', 'next', 'sure', 'shock', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'viewers.As', 'Jackie', 'more', 'successful', 'music', 'world', 'personal', 'life', 'spirals', 'control', 'passion', 'cello', 'often', 'countermanded', 'pains', 'try', 'divest', 'herself', 'demanding', 'instrument', 'seemingly', 'life', 'passion', 'musical', 'genius', 'begin', 'consume', 'exclusion', 'else', 'tortured', 'soul', 'finally', 'set', 'free', 'when', 'succumbs', 'fatal', 'illness', 'lonely', 'tragic', 'figure', 'end', 'mourned', 'most', 'Hilary.This', 'movie', 'music', 'lovers', 'anyone', 'who', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'well-acted', 'film', 'will', 'appreciate', 'enjoy']",Hilary & Jackie

Jackie became world renowned for her cello playing but was deeply troubled and worn out by the constant touring.  Hilary, who was trained to play the flute, married early and lived an idyllic life with her husband and children.  The bond between the sisters was great, so deep in fact, that an emotionally disturbed Jackie even went so far as to ask her sister an unusual favor.  Based on a memoir by Hillary Du Pre and her brother Piers, the screenplay was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, who managed to bring out both the deep love as well as sibling rivalry between the sisters. David Morrissey and James Frain play their two husbands. Both do fine jobs in their supporting roles.There are three sections to the film, which starts off during the sisters' childhood.  Later, after Jackie becomes successful, we see the story from Hilary's point of view.  Then, the same incidents are shown from Jackie's viewpoint.  From these unique perspectives, our understanding is deepened as the tale grows darker and more complex..  Of course there are also the concert performances, which music lovers will no doubt enjoy, but the music never gets in the way of the haunting story or the wonderful characterizations by the cast.

The possibilities are limitless and the audience favours a bit of an inside peek at the lives of the rich and famous. This is the case with Hilary And Jackie, a film based on the lives of Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, and the basis of the book, A Genius In The Family by Hilary and her brother, Piers.We are taken on a roller coaster ride of grand proportions as the du Pre parents, Derek (Charles Dance) and Iris (Celia Imrie) watch their two daughters, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie (Emily Watson), attempt to span the Mt. Everest of the classical world with their music. All starts out well enough, with Hilary, a flautist, taking centre stage and Jackie taking a back-seat until receiving that extra push from her mother, who was also a classically trained pianist, to excel. And excel she does. The two young girls who portray the du Pre sisters as children, Auriol Evans (Jackie) and Keely Flanders (Hilary) are exquisite in their innocence and understanding needed to comprehend the complexities required to master both the sense of competition and the sisterly understanding that permeated their relationship throughout their lives. We see the emotions of both spiraling in opposite directions as Hilary is pushed into submission and Jackie flaunts superiority on her cello. Hilary is forced on almost a daily basis to hear from one and all, ""and how is your wonderful sister, Jackie?"" as she goes deeper and deeper into the background, almost fading into the wall, as her musical star burns and fades all too quickly. She will never be good enough to compete.Jackie is portrayed as forceful, a tornado, wholly spoiled and used to getting her own way, even to the point of wanting her sister's husband, Kiffer (David Morrissey), and getting him. Jackie, never one to be bested by others, attempts to play the game of one upsmanship with her sister and eventually marries the Argentine piano prodigy, Daniel Barenboim (James Frain). But, as is wont to happen throughout Jackie's life, nothing is ever good enough to remain for long, as she is firmly the architect of her own choosing. The supreme irony occurs when she is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 28, seeing her career ebb and flow until she is a shaking skeleton of her former self, as she descends into final illness and imminent death at 42.The actresses portraying Hilary and Jackie, Rachel Griffiths and Emily Watson, do superb jobs in recreating two very interesting enigmas and the world they inhabited. Much was made when A Genius In The Family was published, for it took the goddess on the pedestal, Jackie, and shook the very foundations with its portrayal of her as vain, self absorbed, unkind and a sexual predator towards her sister's husband. Those in England were shocked that Hilary would have shared such personal memories for all the world to read, and she caught a great deal of flack because of it. I feel that this has nothing to do with the music that Jackie made, and while it may put her in less of a favourable light than we would like on a personal level, it does nothing to negate the genius that she was to become and who holds a firm grasp even to this day, almost 16 years after her death. There are those in the music world who refuse to play her most famous cello rendition, Elgar's Cello Concerto, in tribute to her accomplishment. Hilary has presented Jackie with all her credits and flaws in striking fashion. What is history or biography unless we are presented with a complete and absolute portrait? A shallow representation not worthy of mention.Rachel Griffiths is the more interesting of the two actresses, for her performances is multilayered, presenting stratas of the plain Jane who becomes the doormat that her sister walks over in her pursuit of greatness. Watching Griffiths facial expression change from warm to cold as she is asked by Jackie to share her husband with her, is worth the price of admission, and that small action presents her as an actress completely in possession of her craft. She's that rare animal that performs with controlled and yet unsubjected abandon and it is a delight to be on the receiving end.Emily Watson's Jackie is both engaging and obnoxious, rather bleeding over the top in her representation. Jacqueline du Pre was not as difficult in real life, although at times she was and could be a force to be reckoned with. She owned a sense of humour, was not as gifted or musically knowledgeable outside of her collected realm of works and could throw poison barbs out with the best of them. Watson seems to go for the worst and nothing of Jackie's generosity is to be seen in the course of this film.Arnand Tucker, the director, has fashioned a first time effort with smartness and finesse, and has used a Rashomon technique to project this layered tale from the perspective of both sisters. Hilary's version being presented first and Jackie's, imperialistic and heartbreaking, the second. Similar situations as seen through different eyes. He has used a genuine facet of believability with the opening of the movie, as we see the two sisters as children on a beach, before the glory days. They see a mysterious woman on the same beach, who tells Jackie that everything will be all right. This same woman is seen at the end of the film in the same setting, and it is the adult Jackie, who has come through heaven and hell. A very interesting concept by Tucker, whose previous work has been for the BBC.The music by Barrington Pheloung is quite mood enhancing, and is interspersed with selections by Bach, Elgar, Boccherini, Hayden and Schumann. The cello, in original parts of the soundtrack, is played by Caroline Dale, with Hilary du Pre being quoted as saying that Ms. Dale, 'achieved an extraordinary amount of 'cello acting' in catching the spirit and sound of Jackie. She has hit the nail squarely on the head.If there is to be a major complaint about this film, it lies with the representation of Jackie's life during the last 14 years of it, after her diagnosis. Time is compressed into a matter of what seems to be mere minutes, with no thought being given to the life she led in reality as a teacher for other students and the causes she embraced. One is led to believe that except for the visits of friends and her husband, Barenboim, from Paris on weekends, that she practically led a housebound and almost solo existence. Nothing could be farther from the truth.Hilary And Jackie is a film that entreats us to enter into a world that perhaps a good many of us have envied to some degree, but would be loathe and hard pressed to withstand without the endurance of a long distance runner and the wisdom of Solomon keeping pace. Human frailties and emotions are put on the table and we are dealt a hand that wrenches our souls with what might and could have been.",4,"Practice, Practice, Practice",1092441600,"08 14,

465370,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305447233,Matthew Horner,"[5, 10]","When Hilary and Jackie opened, it caused a bit of controversy. Most movies about real life people usually do, unless everyone who knew then is dead. Some rather famous people said the story was not that accurate. I am not knowledgeable enough about the De Pres sisters to know the truth. I only know that what was written was turned into a fine movie.Hilary and Jacqueline De Pres were too English sisters who were extraordinarily close when they were young. As adults, their lives took very different paths, which is what gives the movie much of its drama and pathos. Raised in a musical household, both showed great promise as children. Hilary learned to play the flute, while Jackie decided on an unlikely instrument, the cello. Both won numerous awards. As often happens, when they matured, only Jackie proved to have that true spark of genius it takes to become a world-class musician. After Jackie began to tour Europe, Hilary, not unhappily, opted for life in the country with her husband, who also loved music.The film cleverly covers some key events by showing us both sisters' points of view. To Jackie, Hilary has used her gift to become selfish and distant. The love still exists, but barriers get built. What Jackie cannot see is that Hilary sees herself as enslaved to the cello. Anyone who has ever been obsessed with something can relate to this. In her hotel room, Jackie can get no rest useless she puts her cherished instrument in another room. One time she puts it on a balcony in the snow. Another time she leaves it in a taxi. Even with these efforts, it often plays a big role in her nightmares. The isolation Jackie feels on the road causes her to have times when she feels no one loves her. Ultimately, I think she believes that the cello, which she tried so hard to master in order to please her family, ends up causing her to be in some way cast off from her loved ones.Hilary is jealous of Jackie's talent and fame, while Jackie is envious of her sister's normal, loving life. This is a fairly common theme in sibling rivalries, but it is especially painful when the bond between the sisters is so strong.Jackie does marry the famous concert pianist Daniel Barenboim, but her insecurities get the best of her. In one pivotal scene in a European hotel suite, she asks Daniel if he would still love her if she lost her talent. He does not know how to respond, and she disappears. She runs to Hilary. Soon she asks for a very unusual favor, which I will not reveal here.Much of the music in the movie are from works that made Hilary famous, and it is quite effective. As Hilary, Emily Watson was nominated for an Oscar. It is a stunning performance, one of the best of the decade. The entire cast is nearly perfect. Again, I am in awe of English actors as a whole. They don't often get to do it for the money, you know.The ending is intense. It will remain with the viewer for some time. Hilary and Jackie is a must see for those believe that movies can occasionaly be an art form.",5,Not everyone's (British) cup of tea,1016755200,"03 22, 2002",2002,3006,"['When', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'opened', 'caused', 'bit', 'controversy', 'Most', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'usually', 'do', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'then', 'dead', 'rather', 'famous', 'people', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'accurate', 'am', 'not', 'knowledgeable', 'enough', 'De', 'Pres', 'sisters', 'know', 'truth', 'only', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'turned', 'fine', 'movie.Hilary', 'Jacqueline', 'De', 'Pres', 'were', 'too', 'English', 'sisters', 'who', 'were', 'extraordinarily', 'close', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'adults', 'lives', 'took', 'very', 'different', 'paths', 'movie', 'much', 'drama', 'pathos', 'Raised', 'musical', 'household', 'showed', 'great', 'promise', 'children', 'Hilary', 'learned', 'play', 'flute', 'Jackie', 'decided', 'unlikely', 'instrument', 'cello', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', 'often', 'when', 'matured', 'only', 'Jackie', 'proved', 'have', 'true', 'spark', 'genius', 'become', 'world-class', 'musician', 'Jackie', 'began', 'tour', 'Europe', 'Hilary', 'not', 'unhappily', 'opted', 'life', 'country', 'husband', 'who', 'also', 'loved', 'music.The', 'film', 'cleverly', 'key', 'events', 'showing', 'sisters', 'points', 'view', 'Jackie', 'Hilary', 'used', 'gift', 'become', 'selfish', 'distant', 'love', 'still', 'barriers', 'get', 'built', 'What', 'Jackie', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Hilary', 'enslaved', 'cello', 'Anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'obsessed', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'hotel', 'room', 'Jackie', 'can', 'get', 'rest', 'useless', 'cherished', 'instrument', 'room', 'One', 'time', 'balcony', 'snow', 'time', 'taxi', 'Even', 'efforts', 'often', 'big', 'role', 'nightmares', 'isolation', 'Jackie', 'feels', 'road', 'have', 'times', 'when', 'one', 'Ultimately', 'think', 'cello', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'master', 'order', 'please', 'family', 'up', 'causing', 'be', 'way', 'cast', 'loved', 'ones.Hilary', 'jealous', 'Jackie', 'talent', 'fame', 'Jackie', 'envious', 'sister', 'normal', 'loving', 'life', 'fairly', 'common', 'theme', 'sibling', 'rivalries', 'especially', 'painful', 'when', 'bond', 'sisters', 'so', 'strong.Jackie', 'marry', 'famous', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'insecurities', 'get', 'best', 'one', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'European', 'hotel', 'suite', 'Daniel', 'would', 'still', 'love', 'lost', 'talent', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'respond', 'Hilary', 'Soon', 'very', 'unusual', 'favor', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'here.Much', 'music', 'movie', 'are', 'works', 'made', 'Hilary', 'famous', 'quite', 'effective', 'Hilary', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'stunning', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'decade', 'entire', 'cast', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Again', 'am', 'awe', 'English', 'actors', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'do', 'money', 'know.The', 'ending', 'intense', 'will', 'remain', 'viewer', 'time', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'must', 'see', 'believe', 'movies', 'can', 'occasionaly', 'be', 'art', 'form']",Hilary & Jackie

From an early age both were rising musical stars, Hilary on the flute and Jackie on the cello.  But Jackie's flamboyant playing style brought her attention and then fame.  While Hilary has her style eradicated and settles for an ordinary life.The film is broken into four sections.  The first part is the girl's childhood together.  It takes the girls from prodigies to Jackie's first success.  One night Jackie is playing at a wedding for an Italian princess with Hilary looking on and the next morning she is swept away for a concert tour, leaving her sister alone in a foreign country with no explanation of what happened to her sister.The second part is Hilary's life apart from her sister.  Hilary has her musical life sucked from her by the musical establishment.  But one thing she does find is love and she settles for a country life with her husband raising their two daughters.  During this part of the film we see some bizarre behavior from Jackie with no explanation behind what is happening.The third part is Jackie's life apart from her sister.  Jackie really never wanted the fame that was thrust upon her.  Jackie is isolated from everyone she cares about and most of the time cannot communicate with the people around her.  Even to find out how to wash her clothes.  But she does find her true love and they become the super couple of classical music.  But things are amiss with her health.The last part is Jackie's fight with MS.  In the 1950's they really did not know much about the disease and how to treat it.  Jackie was under the impression with time and exercise that she would overcome her disease.  What she finds out is that not only does the disease get worse but society isolates her because of it.  Just as the two sisters reconcile, Jackie dies.This film is brilliant on many levels but it is the performance by Emily Watson and Rachael Griffiths that give the film its depth.DVD EXTRAS: Nine minute featurette with cast and creative team",5,Two Great Performance in one Great Film,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2024,"['Hilary', 'Jackie', 'story', 'DuPre', 'sisters', 'early', 'age', 'were', 'rising', 'musical', 'stars', 'Hilary', 'flute', 'Jackie', 'cello', 'Jackie', 'flamboyant', 'playing', 'style', 'brought', 'attention', 'then', 'fame', 'Hilary', 'style', 'eradicated', 'settles', 'ordinary', 'life.The', 'film', 'broken', 'four', 'sections', 'first', 'part', 'girl', 'childhood', 'together', 'girls', 'prodigies', 'Jackie', 'first', 'success', 'One', 'night', 'Jackie', 'playing', 'wedding', 'Italian', 'princess', 'Hilary', 'looking', 'next', 'morning', 'swept', 'away', 'concert', 'tour', 'leaving', 'sister', 'alone', 'foreign', 'country', 'explanation', 'what', 'happened', 'sister.The', 'second', 'part', 'Hilary', 'life', 'apart', 'sister', 'Hilary', 'musical', 'life', 'sucked', 'musical', 'establishment', 'one', 'thing', 'find', 'love', 'country', 'life', 'husband', 'raising', 'two', 'daughters', 'part', 'film', 'see', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'Jackie', 'explanation', 'what', 'happening.The', 'third', 'part', 'Jackie', 'life', 'apart', 'sister', 'Jackie', 'really', 'never', 'wanted', 'fame', 'was', 'thrust', 'Jackie', 'isolated', 'everyone', 'about', 'most', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'communicate', 'people', 'Even', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'wash', 'clothes', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'become', 'super', 'couple', 'classical', 'music', 'things', 'are', 'amiss', 'health.The', 'last', 'part', 'Jackie', 'fight', 'MS', '1950', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'much', 'disease', 'how', 'treat', 'Jackie', 'was', 'impression', 'time', 'exercise', 'would', 'overcome', 'disease', 'What', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'disease', 'get', 'worse', 'society', 'Just', 'two', 'sisters', 'reconcile', 'Jackie', 'dies.This', 'film', 'brilliant', 'many', 'levels', 'performance', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Rachael', 'Griffiths', 'give', 'film', 'depth.DVD', 'EXTRAS', 'Nine', 'minute', 'featurette', 'cast', 'creative', 'team']",Hilary & Jackie
465372,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6305447233,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 5]","This totally absorbing movie concerning the life of famous cellist Jacqueline duPr&eacute; and those around her is based on the book written after her death by her siblings.  It charts her life right from her very first performance to her untimely death, beginning with her childhood and then moving through to her adult years where Jackie (Watson) and close sister Hilary (Griffiths) head off their separate ways.  The movie manages to sidestep Hollywood drama by giving an unbiased view of the troubled lives of the two sisters.  For instance, one particularly affecting act by Jackie is backtracked so the audience gets to see what led her to it.A great deal of its mesmerising quality comes from its two stars.  Watson acts her socks off as the world-famous cellist and wisely chooses not to go for the audience's sympathy once her downfall begins.  Griffiths is an utter revelation, in a role completely different to that which she played in `Muriel's Wedding'.  She is understated and manages to create a character full with emotional vulnerability but also brimming with fantastic strength.  To add to this, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong.The cello performances are never less than astounding and really bring to the limelight just how talented Jacqueline duPr&eacute; was.  However, it is its depiction of two sisters side-by-side is beautiful and its message that fame isn't everything is subtly stated.  The contrasts between the two women, ironically both searching for the same thing yet finding it in different places, are beautifully done.  The same can be said for the film's question of whether life is about settling for the best alternative or whether that elusive dream should always be chased.  Without doubt this is not only one of the best British movies in years but also something that redeems the true-life drama.",5,"Absorbing, compelling, brilliant",1013472000,"02 12, 2002",2002,1850,"['totally', 'absorbing', 'movie', 'concerning', 'life', 'famous', 'cellist', 'Jacqueline', 'duPr', 'eacute', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'death', 'siblings', 'life', 'right', 'very', 'first', 'performance', 'untimely', 'death', 'beginning', 'childhood', 'then', 'moving', 'adult', 'years', 'where', 'Jackie', 'Watson', 'close', 'sister', 'Hilary', 'Griffiths', 'head', 'off', 'separate', 'ways', 'movie', 'sidestep', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'giving', 'unbiased', 'view', 'troubled', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'instance', 'one', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'act', 'Jackie', 'backtracked', 'audience', 'see', 'what', 'led', 'it.A', 'great', 'deal', 'mesmerising', 'quality', 'two', 'stars', 'Watson', 'socks', 'off', 'world-famous', 'cellist', 'wisely', 'not', 'go', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'once', 'downfall', 'Griffiths', 'utter', 'revelation', 'role', 'completely', 'different', 'played', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'understated', 'create', 'character', 'full', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'also', 'brimming', 'fantastic', 'strength', 'add', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong.The', 'cello', 'performances', 'are', 'never', 'less', 'astounding', 'really', 'bring', 'limelight', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'Jacqueline', 'duPr', 'eacute', 'was', 'However', 'depiction', 'two', 'sisters', 'side-by-side', 'beautiful', 'message', 'fame', ""n't"", 'everything', 'subtly', 'stated', 'contrasts', 'two', 'women', 'ironically', 'searching', 'same', 'thing', 'yet', 'finding', 'different', 'places', 'are', 'beautifully', 'done', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'question', 'life', 'settling', 'best', 'alternative', 'elusive', 'dream', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'chased', 'doubt', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'movies', 'years', 'also', 'something', 'true-life', 'drama']",Hilary & Jackie

The bond between them was brilliantly portrayed by Emily and Rachel and they should both have won Oscars.I did not know very much  about Jaqueline's real life prior to this movie so I cannot comment on any  factual discrepancies. All I can say is that the movie moved me and the  story told is easily as tragic as that in Shine. The pressure put upon  young musicians who show extraordinary talents is well displayed, and the  scenes where Jackie is playing away from home to huge audiences but has  no-one to support her, tear at the heartstrings almost as much as the  brilliant Cello playing.I would recommend this movie to all musicians or  anyone who loves music. It demonstrates that the truly great musicians do  not just appear, they give their whole lives over to the art",5,beautiful and evocative,959644800,"05 30, 2000",2000,870,"['outstanding', 'portrayal', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'share', 'love', 'music', 'other', 'bond', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Emily', 'Rachel', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscars.I', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'very', 'much', 'Jaqueline', 'real', 'life', 'prior', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'factual', 'discrepancies', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'moved', 'story', 'told', 'easily', 'as', 'tragic', 'Shine', 'pressure', 'put', 'young', 'musicians', 'who', 'show', 'extraordinary', 'talents', 'well', 'displayed', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jackie', 'playing', 'away', 'home', 'huge', 'audiences', 'no-one', 'support', 'tear', 'heartstrings', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'brilliant', 'Cello', 'playing.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'musicians', 'anyone', 'who', 'music', 'truly', 'great', 'musicians', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'appear', 'give', 'whole', 'lives', 'art']",Hilary & Jackie

465376,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6305447233,S. Schell,"[2, 5]","Ah, the beauty of sibling rivalry. From the fragile years of childhood to the tumultuous twenties and the shaky bridge of middle-age, this is an epic  of two women on the verge of being legendary. This movie depicts the  unrelenting and sometimes vulgar competition to be more or less complicated  than the other, to be more talented, more beautiful and more successful,  lasting a lifetime and beyond. It examines the twisted devotion between  real-life sisters Hilary and Jacqueline du Pre, rivaling musicians and  completely diverse women in their motivation to find happiness in their  molded lives.From the beginning, their mother hands Hilary a flute and  Jackie a cello, and together they relentlessly play note after note,  concerto after concerto, even original music that their mother composes.  She immerses them in amateur talent competitions, Hilary displaying an  acute aptitude for the flute and Jackie looking on in deep-rooted envy, her  cumbersome instrument weighing heavy in her hands. When Hilary wins her  woodwind division, Jackie begins her mission for excellence, rehearsing  pieces in her head and even on her arm. Her unearthly skill becomes  apparent and, in time, she outshines Hilary and leaves her sister trailing  in her brilliant afterglow.As the story commences, the first half of the  film becomes Hilary's side of the story, her point of view to the events  that transpire. Hilary's aspiration for music wanes as she reaches  adulthood, her capabilities as a musician put under a microscope by a  callous and unyielding instructor. She forgets her objective for excellence  when she meets Kiffer, a young and ambitious conductor who is scouting  specifically for her talent to put in a showcase concert. She is enamored  by his quirky sense of humor and romantic sentimentality and agrees to  marry him when he proposes. Not long after the joyous news spreads,  Jacqueline arrives home after an extensive philharmonic tour to discover  that her sister has stumbled upon a happiness that she relentlessly  searches for and in due time envies. From this first half of the film,  Jacqueline is made out to be a self-indulgent and incorrigible brat, an  emotional vampire and a manic-depressive. When the second half begins and  the film does a reversal of roles, we begin to see why Jacqueline is such  an extreme character and why she is somewhat volatile and self-destructive.The performances from Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths as the indelible  duo are a spring rain versus an annihilative hurricane. Jacqueline is  undoubtedly the whirlwind of despair as the tortured talent, the golden  child of impeccable and preternatural endowment depicted in Hilary's  autobiographical account &quot;A Genius In The Family&quot;. Anand Tucker  has justifiably extolled Jackie with all the colorful reenactments he  choreographs of some of her most memorable performances in concert halls  around the world. Emily Watson emulates the wily and seductive  characteristics of du Pre's exhibitions with the greatest of ease. She sits  resolutely in her concert chair, her brow furrowed in unbearable ecstasy as  her ochroid tresses whip wildly about her, her spindly arms and wiry  fingers moving masterfully upon the delicate strings of her lavish and  superbly crafted instrument. She is a radiant spectacle to behold in her  vibrant ballgowns and long, lustrous locks, cradling her cello as if it  were a red-hot lover or violently slicing her bow across it in an unbridled  rage.Rachel Griffiths rounds out the dramatics as the solid and  self-reliant Hilary, an astute and rational woman. She favors the simple  life, choosing domesticity over the eccentric and frenzied lifestyle that  her sister leads. She is Jackie's voice of reason, her soothing sedative  when Jackie's stress levels begin to overflow. She embraces her without  question, as anyone would with family, but is a bit gullible, being taken  advantage of and grudgingly accepting of her sister's penchant for  dramatics. When Kipper begins to consistently object, she is forced to be  candid with Jackie and in the end sends her away.This is an excellent  movie as far as direction and cinematography, but one will be slightly  skeptical about the real-life relationship between the du Pres, especially  pertaining to what Hilary allows Jackie to have at a certain point in the  film. This is obviously for dramatic purposes but still makes an  interesting story more intriguing by far. If you want more insight, read  Hilary's book. Either way, you'll become absorbed by the fascinating life  of a bewitching and remarkably gifted woman.",4,"Sister, Sister",967248000,"08 26, 2000",2000,4635,"['Ah', 'beauty', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'fragile', 'years', 'childhood', 'tumultuous', 'twenties', 'shaky', 'bridge', 'middle-age', 'epic', 'two', 'women', 'verge', 'being', 'legendary', 'movie', 'unrelenting', 'sometimes', 'vulgar', 'competition', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'complicated', 'other', 'be', 'more', 'talented', 'more', 'beautiful', 'more', 'successful', 'lasting', 'lifetime', 'twisted', 'devotion', 'real-life', 'sisters', 'Hilary', 'Jacqueline', 'du', 'Pre', 'rivaling', 'musicians', 'completely', 'diverse', 'women', 'motivation', 'find', 'happiness', 'molded', 'beginning', 'mother', 'Hilary', 'flute', 'Jackie', 'cello', 'together', 'relentlessly', 'play', 'note', 'note', 'concerto', 'concerto', 'even', 'original', 'music', 'mother', 'composes', 'amateur', 'talent', 'competitions', 'Hilary', 'displaying', 'acute', 'aptitude', 'flute', 'Jackie', 'looking', 'deep-rooted', 'envy', 'cumbersome', 'instrument', 'weighing', 'heavy', 'hands', 'When', 'Hilary', 'wins', 'woodwind', 'division', 'Jackie', 'mission', 'excellence', 'rehearsing', 'pieces', 'head', 'even', 'arm', 'unearthly', 'skill', 'apparent', 'time', 'Hilary', 'sister', 'trailing', 'brilliant', 'story', 'commences', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Hilary', 'side', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'events', 'transpire', 'Hilary', 'aspiration', 'music', 'wanes', 'adulthood', 'capabilities', 'musician', 'put', 'microscope', 'callous', 'unyielding', 'instructor', 'objective', 'excellence', 'when', 'Kiffer', 'young', 'ambitious', 'conductor', 'who', 'scouting', 'specifically', 'talent', 'put', 'showcase', 'concert', 'enamored', 'quirky', 'sense', 'humor', 'romantic', 'sentimentality', 'marry', 'when', 'Not', 'long', 'joyous', 'news', 'spreads', 'Jacqueline', 'home', 'extensive', 'philharmonic', 'tour', 'discover', 'sister', 'stumbled', 'happiness', 'relentlessly', 'due', 'time', 'envies', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Jacqueline', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'self-indulgent', 'incorrigible', 'brat', 'emotional', 'vampire', 'manic-depressive', 'When', 'second', 'half', 'begins', 'film', 'reversal', 'roles', 'begin', 'see', 'why', 'Jacqueline', 'such', 'extreme', 'character', 'why', 'somewhat', 'volatile', 'self-destructive.The', 'performances', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'indelible', 'duo', 'are', 'spring', 'rain', 'annihilative', 'hurricane', 'Jacqueline', 'undoubtedly', 'whirlwind', 'despair', 'tortured', 'talent', 'golden', 'child', 'impeccable', 'preternatural', 'endowment', 'depicted', 'Hilary', 'autobiographical', 'account', 'quot', 'Genius', 'Family', 'quot', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'justifiably', 'extolled', 'Jackie', 'colorful', 'reenactments', 'choreographs', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'concert', 'halls', 'world', 'Emily', 'Watson', 'wily', 'seductive', 'characteristics', 'du', 'Pre', 'exhibitions', 'greatest', 'ease', 'resolutely', 'concert', 'chair', 'brow', 'furrowed', 'unbearable', 'ecstasy', 'ochroid', 'tresses', 'whip', 'wildly', 'spindly', 'arms', 'wiry', 'fingers', 'moving', 'masterfully', 'delicate', 'strings', 'lavish', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'instrument', 'radiant', 'spectacle', 'behold', 'vibrant', 'ballgowns', 'long', 'lustrous', 'locks', 'cradling', 'cello', 'were', 'red-hot', 'lover', 'violently', 'slicing', 'bow', 'unbridled', 'rage.Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'out', 'dramatics', 'solid', 'self-reliant', 'Hilary', 'astute', 'rational', 'woman', 'simple', 'life', 'choosing', 'domesticity', 'eccentric', 'frenzied', 'lifestyle', 'sister', 'leads', 'Jackie', 'voice', 'reason', 'soothing', 'sedative', 'when', 'Jackie', 'stress', 'levels', 'begin', 'overflow', 'question', 'anyone', 'would', 'family', 'bit', 'gullible', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'grudgingly', 'accepting', 'sister', 'penchant', 'dramatics', 'When', 'Kipper', 'consistently', 'object', 'forced', 'be', 'candid', 'Jackie', 'end', 'away.This', 'excellent', 'movie', 'as', 'far', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'slightly', 'skeptical', 'real-life', 'relationship', 'du', 'Pres', 'especially', 'pertaining', 'what', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'have', 'certain', 'point', 'film', 'obviously', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'still', 'interesting', 'story', 'more', 'intriguing', 'far', 'want', 'more', 'insight', 'read', 'Hilary', 'book', 'way', ""'ll"", 'become', 'absorbed', 'fascinating', 'life', 'bewitching', 'remarkably', 'gifted', 'woman']",Hilary & Jackie

I didn't read the book (I hardly ever do).Emily Watson turned in another devastating performance, the first being her role in Breaking the Waves.  Both are also similar in the fact that they're both almost unbearable to watch at certain points.  In this one, that point was the point where Jackie, suffering from MS, is shaking--flailing--wildly and can't stop.  It's just so upsetting.  But we're compensated for this scene because soon after we're shown one where Jackie's sister, Hilary, is holding her in her arms and manages to get her to stop shaking, all while recalling their happier childhood.  It's truly HEARTBREAKING.  Then, of course, in the next scene ... okay, I won't spoil anything.  ;)Emily Watson, it seems, gets to have a LOT of sex in her movies.  And, in fact, she just LOOKS like somebody that would do just that.  Basically, Hilary takes pity on her sister and shares her husband.  Shocking?
