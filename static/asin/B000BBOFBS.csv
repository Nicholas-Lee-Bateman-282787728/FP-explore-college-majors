This killer is a wolf at heart and in one part changes from wolf to man, it looks pretty cool but is it real or in his mind ?The settings, sets and actors are all top notch so this makes for a well made movie that is not the normal Hollywood slasher type werewolf film.I like this film and if not for a few slow parts think it is well worth a look.

939595,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B000BBOFBS,Carl Manes,"[2, 2]","Like many other features distributed under Brian Yuzna's Filmax production company, WEREWOLF HUNTER offers a surprisingly clean visual style, unique plot, and above average acting that far exceeds its direct-to-DVD release. The story is based on the historical account of a murderer that had killed over fifteen people throughout rural Spain, claiming that he was possessed by Satan and transformed in to a wolf at the time of the murders after finally being apprehended by the authorities. What is most interesting about this atypical werewolf film outside of the historical aspect is that Romasanta completely reverts back in to a wolf in the traditional sense (as opposed to the modern wolf-man). This allows for an impressive reverse-transformation sequence where the wolf sheds its skin and retakes the form of a man. Paco Plaza retains an air of ambiguity throughout the entire film, never letting on as to whether or not Julian Sand's tragic character is actually becoming a wolf, or whether his recollection of the events are trapped in fantasy and psychosis. With few exceptions, this small film provides strong performances and high production values. It may have been better sold in America under its original title ROMASANTA minus the garish cover art that sells it as just another throwaway video title.

939598,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BBOFBS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Werewolf Hunter: Legend of Romasanta (aka Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt or The Werewolf Manhunt) isn't your typical werewolf movie, as it focuses more on the man inside the wolf than the wolf inside the man.  It also, almost by necessity, leaves open the question of whether or not the subject is indeed a werewolf.  That's because the story is built upon the real-life story of Europe's first serial killer, traveling salesman Manuel Blanco Romasanta, the ""Werewolf of Allariz"" who confessed to killing thirteen people and using their body fat to make soap.  Strangely enough, his confession that he suffered from the curse of lycanthropy helped him avoid execution and may well have resulted in a regal pardon had he not died soon after his conviction.  Werewolf Hunter weaves a tapestry of fact and imagination, blurring the edges between the two, introducing a romantic angle to the story while also putting forth a purely fictional ending.  I don't think it truly succeeds in its exploration of the mind and soul of this mass murderer, however; instead, it only muddies the waters of truth and speculation.It's certainly a beautiful film, set against the Gothic backdrop of mid-19th century Gallicia, and it features strong performances by Julian Sands as Romasanta and Elsa Pataky as Barbara, the young woman he grows to love.  Many of the locals of Allariz have gone missing in recent weeks, and the bodies so far recovered are rather baffling, for alongside the terrible gashes seemingly caused by a wolf are disturbing signs that a human removed most of the body fat for his own reasons.  After her sister and niece are killed in horrible fashion, young Barbara develops a relationship with Manuel, a well-known traveling salesman who seems to offer her security and love.  Manuel has a dark secret, though, which Barbara soon discovers.  As soon as she learns that her lover is responsible for the deaths of her family, her affection turns to rage as she helps authorities track down and capture this hateful man.  I thought Elsa Pataky was excellent in her role, but the romantic spin introduced into this story just didn't ring true to me, especially as Manuel's emotional U-turn seemed to come out of thin air.If you're looking for one of those famous transformation scenes, you'll need to look elsewhere.  The only such change in this film is a mud-covered one which may or may not have even happened, given the perspective of its presentation.  You also won't see any first-hand kills; while there are a few good shots of gnawed human limbs, the vast majority of the blood and violence is implied.  There is one case of male nudity that really should have come with some kind of warning, but that's it in terms of bare flesh.  The film is officially unrated, but I believe there's a decent chance it might have received a PG-13 rather than an R rating from the MPAA.In the end, we still haven't learned very much about Manuel and his motivations.  We see the changes in his demeanor and hear the regrets he utters in the end, but it's impossible to determine which of his two natures is the true one.  I guess that's really the point of the entire movie, to a large degree, but I would have liked to see this storyline wound a little bit tighter.  I don't particularly like the ""Legend of Romasanta"" subtitle, either, as this film differs far too much from historical fact to deserve such a description.  All in all, though, Werewolf Hunter is a darned good film that really stands apart from other entries in the werewolf genre.",4,Europe's first serial killer -- a look at the man inside the wolf,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,3543,"['Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'Legend', 'Romasanta', 'aka', 'Romasanta', 'Werewolf', 'Hunt', 'Werewolf', 'Manhunt', ""n't"", 'typical', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'more', 'man', 'wolf', 'wolf', 'man', 'also', 'almost', 'necessity', 'open', 'question', 'not', 'subject', 'indeed', 'werewolf', 'story', 'built', 'real-life', 'story', 'Europe', 'first', 'serial', 'killer', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'Manuel', 'Blanco', 'Romasanta', 'Werewolf', 'Allariz', 'who', 'confessed', 'killing', 'thirteen', 'people', 'using', 'body', 'make', 'soap', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'confession', 'suffered', 'curse', 'lycanthropy', 'helped', 'avoid', 'execution', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'resulted', 'regal', 'pardon', 'had', 'not', 'died', 'soon', 'conviction', 'Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'tapestry', 'fact', 'imagination', 'blurring', 'edges', 'two', 'introducing', 'romantic', 'angle', 'story', 'also', 'putting', 'forth', 'purely', 'fictional', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'truly', 'exploration', 'mind', 'soul', 'mass', 'murderer', 'however', 'instead', 'only', 'waters', 'truth', 'speculation.It', 'certainly', 'beautiful', 'film', 'set', 'Gothic', 'backdrop', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'Gallicia', 'strong', 'performances', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Romasanta', 'Elsa', 'Pataky', 'Barbara', 'young', 'woman', 'love', 'Many', 'locals', 'Allariz', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'recent', 'weeks', 'bodies', 'so', 'far', 'recovered', 'are', 'rather', 'baffling', 'terrible', 'gashes', 'seemingly', 'caused', 'wolf', 'are', 'disturbing', 'signs', 'human', 'removed', 'most', 'body', 'fat', 'own', 'reasons', 'sister', 'niece', 'are', 'killed', 'horrible', 'fashion', 'young', 'Barbara', 'relationship', 'Manuel', 'well-known', 'traveling', 'salesman', 'who', 'offer', 'security', 'love', 'Manuel', 'dark', 'secret', 'Barbara', 'soon', 'discovers', 'As', 'soon', 'lover', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'family', 'affection', 'rage', 'authorities', 'track', 'down', 'capture', 'hateful', 'man', 'thought', 'Elsa', 'Pataky', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'romantic', 'spin', 'introduced', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'especially', 'Manuel', 'emotional', 'U-turn', 'seemed', 'come', 'thin', 'air.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'one', 'famous', 'transformation', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'only', 'such', 'change', 'film', 'mud-covered', 'one', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'happened', 'given', 'perspective', 'presentation', 'also', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'first-hand', 'kills', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'shots', 'gnawed', 'human', 'limbs', 'vast', 'majority', 'blood', 'violence', 'implied', 'one', 'case', 'male', 'nudity', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'kind', 'warning', 'terms', 'bare', 'flesh', 'film', 'officially', 'unrated', 'believe', 'decent', 'chance', 'might', 'have', 'received', 'PG-13', 'rather', 'R', 'rating', 'MPAA.In', 'end', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'very', 'much', 'Manuel', 'motivations', 'see', 'changes', 'demeanor', 'hear', 'regrets', 'end', 'impossible', 'determine', 'two', 'natures', 'true', 'one', 'guess', 'really', 'point', 'entire', 'movie', 'large', 'degree', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'storyline', 'wound', 'little', 'bit', 'tighter', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'Legend', 'Romasanta', 'subtitle', 'either', 'film', 'differs', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'historical', 'fact', 'deserve', 'description', 'Werewolf', 'Hunter', 'darned', 'good', 'film', 'really', 'apart', 'other', 'entries', 'werewolf', 'genre']",Werewolf Hunter - Legend of Romasanta
939599,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B000BBOFBS,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[1, 2]","Having literally just finished watching WEREWOLF HUNTER, the unfortunately titled latest offering from co-producer Brian Yuzna, I want to review this film before my initial impressions have faded or morphed into something else as they are prone to doing.Set in Spain in the mid-19th century this is by no means a conventional werewolf movie. Rather it is the story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta who was supposedly the first documented serial killer, and definitely the only known serial killer to use lycanthropy as his defense when captured and brought to trial. Its a strange film that tries all at once to be a crime thriller, a horror movie, and a bizarre love story, with the result being that it is none of the above. Whether or not the film's claims that its story was based on actual events is a discussion best left for another day. Its depiction of a renowned scientist suggesting that the killer they are looking for may be killing due to his ""genetic"" make up may also be questionable. (Pretty advanced thinking to apply to human beings considering that Mendel was still tinkering around with his peas about that time.) And the love story? Well...Those who go into this film looking for a good-time slash and gnash fest are going to be sorely disappointed. For much of the film's running time we are never certain that there IS or isn't a ""werewolf"" in the traditional sense involved. Are we dealing with the man who becomes a beast in the literal sense or in the simply in the figurative? Special effects fans will be annoyed because there is only one ""transition"" scene and that one is done in reverse--showing the wolf changing into a man rather than giving us what we are accustomed to seeing in films such as this. But as I said this film is far from typical. From the misleading title, to that picture on the cover which is nowhere to be found in the movie, WEREWOLF HUNTER is another in a series of recent films that have been misrepresented to their detriment.This is a slightly flawed film structurally with the lack of continuity resulting in minor confusion, yet by and large it is a well mounted, handsome production that boasts some wonderful scenery and the kind of authenticity and atmosphere that only a European film can deliver. Some may quibble over casting Julian Sands as the lead. While I would never classify myself as a fan of his work, I did enjoy him in a sappy, romantic vampire flick called TALE OF A VAMPIRE and I don't believe that he did any irreparable harm to this film. The rest of the cast preformed admirably with special mention going to the female lead Elsa Pataky and to David Sharian who played Antonio, Romasanta's unwilling assistant. Those who are looking for moody, werewolf/serial killer gothic romance with several nasty severed body parts along the way should seek this movie out.",3,Who's Afraid of The Big Bad Werewolf?,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,2836,"['Having', 'literally', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', 'unfortunately', 'titled', 'latest', 'offering', 'co-producer', 'Brian', 'Yuzna', 'want', 'review', 'film', 'initial', 'impressions', 'have', 'faded', 'morphed', 'something', 'else', 'are', 'prone', 'doing.Set', 'Spain', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'conventional', 'werewolf', 'movie', 'story', 'Manuel', 'Blanco', 'Romasanta', 'who', 'was', 'supposedly', 'first', 'documented', 'serial', 'killer', 'definitely', 'only', 'known', 'serial', 'killer', 'use', 'lycanthropy', 'defense', 'when', 'captured', 'brought', 'trial', 'strange', 'film', 'once', 'be', 'crime', 'thriller', 'horror', 'movie', 'bizarre', 'love', 'story', 'result', 'being', 'none', 'above', 'not', 'film', 'claims', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'discussion', 'best', 'left', 'day', 'depiction', 'renowned', 'scientist', 'suggesting', 'killer', 'are', 'looking', 'may', 'be', 'killing', 'due', 'genetic', 'make', 'up', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'questionable', 'Pretty', 'advanced', 'thinking', 'apply', 'human', 'beings', 'considering', 'Mendel', 'was', 'still', 'tinkering', 'peas', 'time', 'love', 'story', 'Well', 'who', 'go', 'film', 'looking', 'good-time', 'slash', 'gnash', 'fest', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'much', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'are', 'never', 'certain', 'IS', ""n't"", 'werewolf', 'traditional', 'sense', 'involved', 'Are', 'dealing', 'man', 'who', 'beast', 'literal', 'sense', 'simply', 'figurative', 'Special', 'effects', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'annoyed', 'only', 'one', 'transition', 'scene', 'one', 'done', 'reverse', 'showing', 'wolf', 'changing', 'man', 'rather', 'giving', 'what', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'films', 'such', 'said', 'film', 'far', 'typical', 'misleading', 'title', 'picture', 'cover', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'WEREWOLF', 'HUNTER', 'series', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'misrepresented', 'detriment.This', 'slightly', 'flawed', 'film', 'structurally', 'lack', 'continuity', 'resulting', 'minor', 'confusion', 'yet', 'large', 'well', 'mounted', 'handsome', 'production', 'wonderful', 'scenery', 'kind', 'authenticity', 'atmosphere', 'only', 'European', 'film', 'can', 'deliver', 'may', 'quibble', 'over', 'casting', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'lead', 'would', 'never', 'classify', 'fan', 'work', 'did', 'enjoy', 'sappy', 'romantic', 'vampire', 'flick', 'called', 'TALE', 'A', 'VAMPIRE', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', 'irreparable', 'harm', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'preformed', 'admirably', 'special', 'mention', 'going', 'female', 'lead', 'Elsa', 'Pataky', 'David', 'Sharian', 'who', 'played', 'Antonio', 'Romasanta', 'unwilling', 'assistant', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'moody', 'werewolf/serial', 'killer', 'gothic', 'romance', 'several', 'nasty', 'severed', 'body', 'parts', 'way', 'should', 'seek', 'movie', 'out']",Werewolf Hunter - Legend of Romasanta

The message behind this movie is a mad man who killed women in a way that only an animal could have done it. It's not about a guy in a dog suit, this was deep.The main reason why I saw this movie was that I fricken love werewolf movies, nothing creeps me out that a hairy beast, and that I loveded the Warlock movies with Julian Sands, and guess what; he plays the perfect bad guy AGAIN in this very movie!Sands plays Manuel Romasanta, a charming and flirtatious man who seduces women only to leave a trail of corpses and scared animals who run away from him. He meets his own girm fate then one of his victims realises he did soemthing tho her sisters that cannot be forgiven , after she falls in love with him she starts a merciless hunt after him.I really liked the movie, the woods, eerie darkness and violent scenes made this more of a serious movie. Usually werevolf movies are gory eye candy, that really dont need any plot, this was not the case.THere is a bit of nudity, I was suprised to see so much naked flesh running around, but it was not over the top and it blended with the raw organic feeling of 1800s without looking cheap.

To be fair, the way it's marketed sets you up for something totally different, a nice B-movie gore fest with scary monsters. But the most frightening thing about this movie is that it's a true account of the first documented serial killer. So the film really should have been under a different genre. It attempts (sucessfully) to portray a cold blooded killer who just happens to be a romantic at heart. You are thrust into his world of insanity and contradictions. At times he's gentle and sympathetic, and the next moment he's thrusting straws into bird's eyes. Julian Sands plays this part perfectly. At first sympathetic, and finally sadisitic, he reveals the killer over time, never quite letting on when he's going to snap. The director cuts back and forth between objective reality, and the fantastic delusions of the serial killer. Historically the film is set at a time in Europe when reason and science were struggling to replace folk lore and superstition. The director plays off that tension by leading us down the werewolf path with a truly repulsive physical transformation. But the credit for the most hideous transformation goes to Sands. Be warned. This movie does contain graphic images of violence against children. I could not believe one reviewer got all hacked off about the cruelty against animals, and overlooked violence against kids??? I'm a seasoned horror movie viewer and could barely watch some of the scenes.... However, this film is worth viewing. I'd put it in the same class as ""CLose Your Eyes"".
