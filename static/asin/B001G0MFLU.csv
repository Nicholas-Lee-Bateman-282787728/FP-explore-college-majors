No matter how ""weird"" or ""supernatural"" an episode gets, it still somehow seems almost realistic. This season DEFINITELY shows that with all of the drama that happens with Jim. Some people say that this choice was unneeded and it made the show worse. I disagree with those people because it showed how functionable and lovable Jim and Melinda's marriage is. On TV nowadays, it's all about sex and divorce. This show instead shows the happiness and hopefully true side of marriage. The episodes in this season are much darker and more intense, in my opinion. I look at the first season now and I'm like...wow...that seems so juvenile compared to where they are at now. It's amazing how much this show has progressed and matured. The first season was amazing when I watched it and I thought it was intense then, but each season gets better and better, unlike other shows. Buy this season now!! Fifth season has just started so you should watch that too!!! This show is amazing and you will love it.
