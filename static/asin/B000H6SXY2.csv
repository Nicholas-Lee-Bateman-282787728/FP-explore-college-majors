I think it's a good educational movie on pirates and the actors did a good job at bringing the characters to life.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves pirates as much as I do.",3,Love it!,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,338,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'History', 'channel', 'was', 'looking', 'everywhere', 'everywhere', 'looked', 'lot', 'found', 'good', 'deal', 'here', 'think', 'good', 'educational', 'movie', 'pirates', 'actors', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'pirates', 'as', 'much', 'do']",True Caribbean Pirates
1010714,A382AH0YTZJHQ5,B000H6SXY2,"Der Hammer des Kuchens ""I guess so""","[8, 10]",If you want to watch an enjoyable documentary about true pirates in the Caribbean during the 17th century then look no further. You don't learn about all the famous pirates or everything that the pirates are about because there just isn't enough time but you do learn a lot. I learned some new things about pirates and about some famous ones too. The re enactments are presented in a more stylized movie form rather than the usual chessy low budget ones that a lot of documentarys have.So if want to learn more about pirates from a documentary that isn't too boring then this is the one for you.,5,read my review or walk the plank,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,595,"['want', 'watch', 'enjoyable', 'documentary', 'true', 'pirates', 'Caribbean', '17th', 'century', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'famous', 'pirates', 'everything', 'pirates', 'are', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'do', 'learn', 'lot', 'learned', 'new', 'things', 'pirates', 'famous', 'ones', 'too', 're', 'enactments', 'are', 'presented', 'more', 'stylized', 'movie', 'form', 'rather', 'usual', 'chessy', 'low', 'budget', 'ones', 'lot', 'documentarys', 'have.So', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'pirates', 'documentary', ""n't"", 'too', 'boring', 'then', 'one']",True Caribbean Pirates

1010716,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B000H6SXY2,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[2, 2]","There is lots more pirate and seafaring action than lecture in this excellent documentary from The History Channel called ""TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES.""  Yes, the deadly pirates were for real, not Disney and Hollywood fiction.  Much of what other fictional stories are made from is the realities shown in this DVD of treasure seeking, cut-throat sailors, afraid of no one, and brutal savage fighters.  This documentary uses dramatization, as good as many Caribbean Pirates contemporary films, to document the activity, the leading pirates (including women), and the locations where piracy flourished.You would have to be a pirate expert to watch this DVD and not gain new information about the life on the seas during the decades when piracy was at its peak.  Some scenes may cause you to flinch, you may turn away, some you will be exhilarated at the action coverage, which makes it feel much like a news story rather than a documentary of centuries earlier.  Hanging, pillaging, beheading, torture, and other dastardly and debauchery deeds of the pirates are shown, so it's perhaps not for the squeamish, or the younger children.Pirates like Morgan, Ann Bonny, Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Mary Read, and Black Bart are among the individuals who had turned their life to a pirate's criminal style, some quite successfully while other died violently.  If you like pirate stories, and pirate film in the theater, then you will enjoy this TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES DVD that was considered for an Outstanding Nonfiction Special Emmy.Buy this one fast, while it is yet available.  Place it on the shelf beside your ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" set.  This DVD is entertaining and educational, and realistic, not the glamorized Hollywood version.",5,EDUCATIONAL--HISTORICAL--PLUS DRAMATIC PORTRAYALS MAKE THIS A FEATURE-LIKE DOCUMENTARY,1254960000,"10 8, 2009",2009,1727,"['lots', 'more', 'pirate', 'seafaring', 'action', 'lecture', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'History', 'Channel', 'called', 'TRUE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'PIRATES', 'Yes', 'deadly', 'pirates', 'were', 'real', 'not', 'Disney', 'Hollywood', 'fiction', 'Much', 'what', 'other', 'fictional', 'stories', 'are', 'made', 'realities', 'shown', 'DVD', 'treasure', 'seeking', 'cut-throat', 'sailors', 'afraid', 'one', 'brutal', 'savage', 'fighters', 'documentary', 'dramatization', 'as', 'good', 'many', 'Caribbean', 'Pirates', 'contemporary', 'films', 'document', 'activity', 'leading', 'pirates', 'including', 'women', 'locations', 'where', 'piracy', 'flourished.You', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'pirate', 'expert', 'watch', 'DVD', 'not', 'gain', 'new', 'information', 'life', 'seas', 'decades', 'when', 'piracy', 'was', 'peak', 'scenes', 'may', 'cause', 'flinch', 'may', 'turn', 'away', 'will', 'be', 'exhilarated', 'action', 'coverage', 'feel', 'much', 'news', 'story', 'rather', 'documentary', 'centuries', 'earlier', 'Hanging', 'pillaging', 'beheading', 'torture', 'other', 'dastardly', 'debauchery', 'deeds', 'pirates', 'are', 'shown', 'perhaps', 'not', 'squeamish', 'younger', 'children.Pirates', 'Morgan', 'Ann', 'Bonny', 'Calico', 'Jack', 'Blackbeard', 'Mary', 'Read', 'Black', 'Bart', 'are', 'individuals', 'who', 'had', 'turned', 'life', 'pirate', 'criminal', 'style', 'quite', 'successfully', 'other', 'died', 'violently', 'like', 'pirate', 'stories', 'pirate', 'film', 'theater', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'TRUE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'PIRATES', 'DVD', 'was', 'considered', 'Outstanding', 'Nonfiction', 'Special', 'Emmy.Buy', 'one', 'fast', 'yet', 'available', 'Place', 'shelf', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'set', 'DVD', 'entertaining', 'educational', 'realistic', 'not', 'glamorized', 'Hollywood', 'version']",True Caribbean Pirates

It it a little gruesome at times.(mostly just the discriptions of gruesome things the pirates did to torture people)  So it may be too much for younger kids.It also would have been nice had they included some other pirates, like those of the Barbary coast and maybe some Asian one's as well.  It definitely could have covered more ground. Perhaps they will make a second edition to it some day.
