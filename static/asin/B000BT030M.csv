948961,A25MLH76YYX61R,B000BT030M,"Jeffrey W. Nicholas ""Romatic In Utah""","[4, 4]","I rated this 5-Stars on the issue the film was intended to depict, however I don't think it went far enough.  The ""whatever"" is was that was ""getting closer"" and causing the visions experienced by and tormenting the prosecuting lawyer was never identified--and these took a large part of this all too short film. Then, the relationship of the prosecuting lawyer to her obviously mentally disturbed and largely unresponsive mother--who in the film was also experiencing horrific visions--could have been resolved in a way that would have further covered the subject of partial birth abortion, but this was apparently not the director's purpose. We're given the detailed gross aspects of the procedure which I found disgusting (the director's goal?) and at the very close of the film, another vision(?) assaults the daughter when her mother is called to the stand as a witness for the defense and after that's over, the daughter walks off hand in hand with the senior principal of her firm and the film fades to black. The film--for me--was too disjointed, and leaves too much up in the air with no meaningful resolution for the characters portrayed or the issue it documents. I feel that the subject of partial birth abortion deserves better treatment than this film provided.",5,Distant thunder with no healing rain.,1184112000,"07 11, 2007",2007,1275,"['rated', '5-Stars', 'issue', 'film', 'was', 'intended', 'depict', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'went', 'far', 'enough', 'whatever', 'was', 'was', 'getting', 'closer', 'causing', 'visions', 'experienced', 'tormenting', 'prosecuting', 'lawyer', 'was', 'never', 'identified', 'took', 'large', 'part', 'too', 'short', 'film', 'Then', 'relationship', 'prosecuting', 'lawyer', 'obviously', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'largely', 'unresponsive', 'mother', 'who', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'experiencing', 'horrific', 'visions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'further', 'covered', 'subject', 'partial', 'birth', 'abortion', 'was', 'apparently', 'not', 'director', 'purpose', ""'re"", 'given', 'detailed', 'gross', 'aspects', 'procedure', 'found', 'disgusting', 'director', 'goal', 'very', 'close', 'film', 'vision', 'daughter', 'when', 'mother', 'called', 'stand', 'witness', 'defense', 'over', 'daughter', 'walks', 'off', 'hand', 'hand', 'senior', 'principal', 'firm', 'film', 'black', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'disjointed', 'too', 'much', 'air', 'meaningful', 'resolution', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'issue', 'documents', 'feel', 'subject', 'partial', 'birth', 'abortion', 'better', 'treatment', 'film', 'provided']",A Distant Thunder

In a mere 35 minutes it cuts through the political rhetoric, shows you what the Planned Parenthood crowd keeps so secret, and goes to the heart of the matter - morality in our country, our courts, and in our own lives.Jonathan Flora (writer, director, and cameo performer) and wife, Deborah Flora (Ann Brown), two of the finest Chriatians I have ever met, bypassed the leftist Hollywood establishment to produce this film on their own. Not only does this speak for their courage, but it gives reason for hope that once again we can become a nation that respects not just the lives of some, but of all.You will love the surprise ending!",5,A Must See - And Believe !,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,708,"['one', 'most', 'moving', 'frightening', 'films', 'may', 'ever', 'see', 'mere', '35', 'minutes', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'what', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'crowd', 'keeps', 'so', 'secret', 'heart', 'matter', 'morality', 'country', 'courts', 'own', 'lives.Jonathan', 'Flora', 'writer', 'director', 'cameo', 'performer', 'wife', 'Deborah', 'Flora', 'Ann', 'Brown', 'two', 'finest', 'Chriatians', 'have', 'ever', 'met', 'bypassed', 'leftist', 'Hollywood', 'establishment', 'produce', 'film', 'own', 'Not', 'only', 'speak', 'courage', 'reason', 'hope', 'once', 'again', 'can', 'become', 'nation', 'not', 'just', 'lives', 'all.You', 'will', 'love', 'surprise', 'ending']",A Distant Thunder

948964,AEYEAH3C78BBZ,B000BT030M,Tim Challies,"[2, 2]","Partial birth abortion, also known by the nicer-sounding ""Dilation and Extraction"" is one of the most disgusting, nauseating so-called medical procedures in the world. While it may sound innocuous, the details of the procedure are enough to turn the stomach. It is the closest thing to legalized murder I could imagine. A Distant Thunder, a half-hour long supernatural thriller, is an attempt to draw attention to this procedure, which is generating increasing controversy as more states and nations consider legalizing it.The short but intense movie goes something like this: ""Struggling to keep her fragile sanity from unraveling, Prosecutor Ann Brown is offered a murder case that will challenge everything she believes is true. Uncertain at first whether to accept the assignment, a harrowing encounter with Defense Attorney Tom Condan convinces her to meet the challenge. The deeper she investigates, reality and tormenting delusions collide as she encounters an evil force as unnerving as it is foreboding. Terrifying secrets are exposed, and you'll discover the shocking twist which reveals the chilling and unforeseeable truth.""Overall, the presentation is quite good. The acting is sound and the story moves along well (though I had guessed the shocking twist before it was revealed--something, as my wife can attest, that is rare for me!). The supernatural elements, along with a shower scene (where no nudity is seen due to strategic camera work) render this a movie that requires parental guidance. The DVD includes an edited version which, though I did not view it, presumably removes these scenes. It extras also include a conversation with the filmmakers, commentary with several of the cast members, commentary with the writer/director, and a trailer.This DVD is a clever and possibly-impactful way of introducing the brutal injustice of partial birth abortion to people who may not care to read about it or who may never otherwise be presented with the facts.",4,A Clever Production,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1976,"['Partial', 'birth', 'abortion', 'also', 'known', 'nicer-sounding', 'Dilation', 'Extraction', 'one', 'most', 'disgusting', 'nauseating', 'so-called', 'medical', 'procedures', 'world', 'may', 'sound', 'innocuous', 'details', 'procedure', 'are', 'enough', 'turn', 'stomach', 'closest', 'thing', 'legalized', 'murder', 'could', 'imagine', 'Distant', 'Thunder', 'half-hour', 'long', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'attempt', 'draw', 'attention', 'procedure', 'generating', 'increasing', 'controversy', 'more', 'states', 'nations', 'consider', 'legalizing', 'it.The', 'short', 'intense', 'movie', 'something', 'Struggling', 'keep', 'fragile', 'sanity', 'unraveling', 'Prosecutor', 'Ann', 'Brown', 'offered', 'murder', 'case', 'will', 'challenge', 'everything', 'true', 'Uncertain', 'first', 'accept', 'assignment', 'harrowing', 'encounter', 'Defense', 'Attorney', 'Tom', 'Condan', 'meet', 'challenge', 'deeper', 'reality', 'tormenting', 'delusions', 'collide', 'evil', 'force', 'as', 'unnerving', 'foreboding', 'Terrifying', 'secrets', 'are', 'exposed', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'shocking', 'twist', 'chilling', 'unforeseeable', 'truth', 'Overall', 'presentation', 'quite', 'good', 'acting', 'sound', 'story', 'moves', 'along', 'well', 'had', 'guessed', 'shocking', 'twist', 'was', 'revealed', 'something', 'wife', 'can', 'attest', 'rare', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'shower', 'scene', 'where', 'nudity', 'seen', 'due', 'strategic', 'camera', 'work', 'render', 'movie', 'parental', 'guidance', 'DVD', 'edited', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'view', 'presumably', 'scenes', 'also', 'include', 'conversation', 'filmmakers', 'commentary', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'trailer.This', 'DVD', 'clever', 'possibly-impactful', 'way', 'introducing', 'brutal', 'injustice', 'partial', 'birth', 'abortion', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'care', 'read', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'otherwise', 'be', 'presented', 'facts']",A Distant Thunder
