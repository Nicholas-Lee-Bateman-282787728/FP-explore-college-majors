1262637,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B002CJI4WS,FYI,"[12, 12]","John Thaw is in rare form as Detective Inspector Morse in these three mysteries, Kevin Whately is superb as Sergeant Lewis. Morse supposedly consumes too much ale, but consumption levels looks respectable to me, though Morse's beer better not be cloudy, or Lewis will hear about it. I like my ales rich and cloudy, but prefer DVDs to have clarity, be prepared for a low-quality picture (resolution improves in later sets). These collections improve the further you advance, by Set Nine, the stories are better. Once you're done with this series, continue to follow Lewis in the excellentMasterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis, where he is paired with Laurence Fox as the wryly deadpan, intellectual Sergeant Hathaway.Deceived by Flight: The English sport of cricket meets murder, and Lewis proves his adroitness in both these fields of endeavor, while murder and drugs create a toxic mix. I still don't understand Morse's deplorable taste in women, yet fine palate with ale. Odd.The Secret of 5B: Morse is about to embark on a romance with pathologist Dr. Grayling Russell, but as usual, things go amiss, with the advent of a roving playboy-architect's murder. We again hear the refrain from Morse that ""beer is food."" The scene with Morse coping with a redheaded professional seductress proffering drinks and conversation is one of the best portions of a convoluted plot.The Infernal Serpent: Unsavory secrets abound in an academic family's closet, including accusations of child abuse. The fine Cheryl Campbell plays a character who wants the truth to come out. As well, environmental debate takes a dark turn. This is nasty stuff with an overly dramatic plot, but the cast gives credibilty to the horrors depicted.",4,Mystery Cupboard,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,1724,"['John', 'Thaw', 'rare', 'form', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'three', 'mysteries', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'superb', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'Morse', 'supposedly', 'too', 'much', 'ale', 'consumption', 'levels', 'respectable', 'Morse', 'beer', 'better', 'not', 'be', 'cloudy', 'Lewis', 'will', 'hear', 'ales', 'rich', 'cloudy', 'prefer', 'DVDs', 'have', 'clarity', 'be', 'prepared', 'low-quality', 'picture', 'resolution', 'later', 'sets', 'collections', 'improve', 'further', 'advance', 'Set', 'Nine', 'stories', 'are', 'better', ""'re"", 'done', 'series', 'continue', 'follow', 'Lewis', 'excellentMasterpiece', 'Mystery', 'Complete', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'where', 'paired', 'Laurence', 'Fox', 'wryly', 'deadpan', 'intellectual', 'Sergeant', 'Hathaway.Deceived', 'Flight', 'English', 'sport', 'cricket', 'meets', 'murder', 'Lewis', 'adroitness', 'fields', 'endeavor', 'murder', 'drugs', 'create', 'toxic', 'mix', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Morse', 'deplorable', 'taste', 'women', 'yet', 'fine', 'palate', 'ale', 'Odd.The', 'Secret', '5B', 'Morse', 'embark', 'romance', 'pathologist', 'Dr.', 'Grayling', 'Russell', 'usual', 'things', 'go', 'amiss', 'advent', 'roving', 'playboy-architect', 'murder', 'again', 'hear', 'refrain', 'Morse', 'beer', 'food', 'scene', 'Morse', 'coping', 'redheaded', 'professional', 'seductress', 'proffering', 'drinks', 'conversation', 'one', 'best', 'portions', 'convoluted', 'plot.The', 'Infernal', 'Serpent', 'Unsavory', 'secrets', 'abound', 'academic', 'family', 'closet', 'including', 'accusations', 'child', 'abuse', 'fine', 'Cheryl', 'Campbell', 'character', 'who', 'truth', 'come', 'out', 'As', 'well', 'environmental', 'debate', 'dark', 'turn', 'nasty', 'stuff', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'cast', 'credibilty', 'horrors', 'depicted']",Inspector Morse Set Four: The Infernal Serpent
1262638,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B002CJI4WS,Happy Reader,"[5, 5]","This is Set Four of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.Set Four has 3 episodes. The first two were the last two episodes in the original British Series 3, aired in January 1989. (In England, they call them ""series"", not ""seasons"".) The final episode on this set was the 1st in the British Series 4, airing January 1990.Episodes:Deceived by FlightThe Secret of Bay 5BThe Infernal SerpentDECEIVED BY FLIGHT:Anthony Donn checks into his old rooms at college. He's there for a cricket match with his old coach's current amateur team, The Clarets. Morse knew the two of them, too, but that was 20 years ago, and he can't figure out why Donn is getting in touch with him now. Donn tells him a Zen Buddhist story, that seems apropos of nothing. And though he seems to have something on his mind, Morse can't convince him to speak it.While Morse was busy with another case in the morning, Donn calls him and leaves this message: ""Tell him I've remembered what I wanted to say"". That afternoon Donn turns up dead, an apparent suicide. Morse is haunted by the fact that he missed that call. And he also can't figure out why Donn would have electrocuted himself, when he had a loaded pistol in his luggage.Morse and Lewis talk to Roland Marshall, the coach, confined to a wheelchair but feisty as ever. In what I think is an un-Morse-like plan, and with the coach's connivance, Lewis takes Donn's place on the cricket team for the match. Morse has a reason: ""I'm a pedestrian sort of copper. I say to myself, a man comes to Oxford to play cricket with old friends, and gets murdered. And then I remember reading some statistic or other about how most murders were committed by someone the victim knows, and I put these things together and come up with eleven suspects.""""Ten"", the coach corrects. No, Morse assures him, I'm including you.It turns out there was a reason behind the Buddhist story, wouldn't you know it.Trivia: This episode was written by Anthony Minghella based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he is walking behind Lewis and Roland in the college.THE SECRET OF BAY 5B:Morse is all dressed up, attending a Policeman's Ball type occasion. The next dance is Ladies' Choice, and the lovely Dr. Russell, looking very unpathologist-y in her pink and black ballgown, asks Morse for the dance. He complies, but in spite of her prompting, even flirting, he can't bring himself to compliment her. Then Lewis arrives with news of a body; Morse is saved by the bell.The body is in a carpark, the dead man sitting in the driver's seat, shot through the closed window. Morse is puzzled by a minor point, ""Why would the killer take the keys, and leave the car?""That's not the only puzzling thing in this convoluted story. And it's not the only body to turn up, either.Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's cameo is where he's in the health club bar, while Morse and Lewis are interviewing a woman. Undoubtedly the only time Morse set foot in a health club! I find Morse's reluctance with Russell touching. Here's a man who keeps falling in like with women who don't want him, and he is simply uncomfortable with the overtures of his lovely colleague. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary, John Thaw says, ""You know, he's just a loser all around in the love stakes. I think women [viewers] have a soft spot for somebody who messes up time after time!""THE INFERNAL SERPENT:A young man is forced into a car. He's protesting he won't do ""it"", but it doesn't look like he has any choice. Later, it's raining hard as people leave a Beaufort College debate late at night. One of them, Dr. Julian Dear, is attacked. His colleague, Headmaster Matthew Copley-Barnes, shows up just in time to see the the apparent assailant's face, we know it's the young man forced into the car. Dr. Dear dies, making it murder, and Morse and Lewis are stumped.The next day, celebrated journalist Sylvia Maxton arrives at the Headmaster's house. After her father died, when just a girl, she moved in with Blanche and Matthew Copley-Barnes. But something is wrong with this homecoming. She hasn't been in contact for a long 17 years. Imogen, daughter of Matthew and Blanche, can barely stand to look at her. The air crackles with pent animosity - but why?It's an umbrella and a photograph that help solve the mysteries.Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is where he is in the chapel during the funeral. The episode title is from ""Paradise Lost"" by John Milton.",5,"Not the very best of Inspector Morse, which makes it merely Excellent!",1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,4843,"['Set', 'Four', 'eleven',

1262644,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B002CJI4WS,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I came to the Inspector Morse series by way of Inspector Lewis, and discovered that Kevin Whately (who is amazing as DI Lewis) also used to play DS Lewis in Inspector Morse. He is one of my favorite actors, and of course, John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.Set Four contains three episodes:Deceived by FlightDeceived by Flight is not one of Morse's best episodes, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The Clarets XI old boys' cricket team gather in Oxford for the annual cricket match, but the murder of one of the team members throws everything into disarray. Enter Inspector Morse (John Thaw) who knowing his DS, Lewis (Kevin Whately) is quite a cricket player himself, puts Lewis to work, going undercover as the newest member of the team!This interesting turn makes this story quite refreshing, and though I'm not a cricket fan, I could not help but smile as I watched Lewis have fun, for once showing off his skills, and relishing every moment in the spotlight!The Secret of Bay 5BThe Secret of Bay 5B contains an interesting plot involving the murder of an architect who also happens to be quite a lothario. As Morse and Lewis dig deeper, they discover that the architect's liaisons might yield clues to his killer's identity. This episode is also fun in that we see some erm, interesting developments between Morse and the attractive pathologist, Dr. Grayling Russell (who is obviously too young for Morse, but what the heck).Infernal SerpentIn Infernal Serpent, Morse (John Thaw) finds himself dealing with corruption of all forms in high places. Both Morse and Lewis (Kevin Whately) are warned off the case when their investigations ruffle the feathers of some high-ranking people. Luckily, both Morse and Lewis are not averse to carrying on their investigations on the sly, and the deeper they dig, the more disturbing the details that emerge.The supporting roles are credibly cast here - there's the Oxford master and his wife, a seemingly benign couple with some dark secrets; their daughter who seems emotionally fragile; the young family friend who comes over for a visit but seems to harbor an agenda of her own; and, a young child whose innocence is forever lost. This is another winner in the Morse series. It is slow-going at times, but Morse and Lewis' investigative methods are always meticulous and though the outcome is not quite what either would have expected, let's just say justice is served in the end.",5,Inspector Morse is a riveting investigative drama,1350864000,"10 22, 2012",2012,2821,"['came', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'series', 'way', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'discovered', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'who', 'amazing', 'DI', 'Lewis', 'also', 'used', 'play', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'course', 'John', 'Thaw', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'investigative', 'dramas', 'Thaw', 'Morse', 'compelling', 'watch', 'listening', 'operatic', 'music', 'quality', 'pint', 'ale', 'easily', 'smitten', 'pretty', 'face', 'intelligence', 'meticulous', 'astute', 'deductive', 'reasoning', 'Morse', 'consummate', 'detective', 'most', 'Morse', 'episodes', 'are', 'superior', 'quality', 'terms', 'writing', 'acting.Set', 'Four', 'contains', 'three', 'episodes', 'Deceived', 'FlightDeceived', 'Flight', 'not', 'one', 'Morse', 'best', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'nevertheless', 'Clarets', 'XI', 'old', 'boys', 'cricket', 'team', 'gather', 'Oxford', 'annual', 'cricket', 'match', 'murder', 'one', 'team', 'members', 'everything', 'disarray', 'Enter', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'who', 'knowing', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'quite', 'cricket', 'player', 'Lewis', 'work', 'going', 'undercover', 'newest', 'member', 'team', 'interesting', 'turn', 'story', 'quite', 'refreshing', ""'m"", 'not', 'cricket', 'fan', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'smile', 'watched', 'Lewis', 'have', 'fun', 'once', 'showing', 'off', 'skills', 'relishing', 'moment', 'spotlight', 'Secret', 'Bay', '5BThe', 'Secret', 'Bay', '5B', 'interesting', 'plot', 'involving', 'murder', 'architect', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'quite', 'lothario', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'dig', 'deeper', 'discover', 'architect', 'liaisons', 'might', 'yield', 'clues', 'killer', 'identity', 'episode', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'erm', 'interesting', 'developments', 'Morse', 'attractive', 'pathologist', 'Dr.', 'Grayling', 'Russell', 'who', 'obviously', 'too', 'young', 'Morse', 'what', 'heck', '.Infernal', 'SerpentIn', 'Infernal', 'Serpent', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'dealing', 'corruption', 'forms', 'high', 'places', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'are', 'warned', 'case', 'when', 'investigations', 'ruffle', 'feathers', 'high-ranking', 'people', 'Luckily', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'are', 'not', 'averse', 'carrying', 'investigations', 'sly', 'deeper', 'dig', 'more', 'disturbing', 'details', 'emerge.The', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'credibly', 'cast', 'here', 'Oxford', 'master', 'wife', 'seemingly', 'benign', 'couple', 'dark', 'secrets', 'daughter', 'who', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'young', 'family', 'friend', 'who', 'over', 'visit', 'harbor', 'agenda', 'own', 'young', 'child', 'innocence', 'forever', 'lost', 'winner', 'Morse', 'series', 'slow-going', 'times', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'investigative', 'methods', 'are', 'always', 'meticulous', 'outcome', 'not', 'quite', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'justice', 'served', 'end']",Inspector Morse Set Four: The Infernal Serpent
