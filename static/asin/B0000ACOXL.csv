762205,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B0000ACOXL,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[5, 6]","""Traitor"" tries to plow through the viewers' assumed ignorance or lack of understanding when it comes to Islamic terrorists and suggest a more nuanced explanations of motives beyond the simplistic ""they want to kill us all"" or ""unless we don't fight them there will have to fight them here"" or ""they are going to follow us home and do unspeakable things to our defenseless families"". Clearly, we have a much better understanding of terrorists movements such as the nationalist IRA or the various past and present Marxist or Maoist Red Army Brigades than we do of today's super-radical and super-desperate Islamic suiciders. It's difficult to 'get' what motivates young men and women, often well educated and sometimes coming from affluent families to blow themselves up for the dubious (at least to us) reward of taking 'some of us' with them in the process and the few no longer front page newspaper headlines and Tweets. What makes ""Traitor"" troubling is not its largely successful attempt to show us that there's a lot more than the promise of 72 virgins in Heaven that recruits 'suiciders' but its inability to go beyond hinting at what that might be - to borrow a famous line from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'... Anyone? Anyone? The possible explanations provided by dedicated terrorist Omar - who attended finishing school in Switzerland - that tend to come down to 'they killed many of us so we should kill many of them' may be part of the motive, especially when a family member was tortured or imprisoned or lost but individual revenge can't account for a movement and a cause.With the understanding that ""Traitor"" is maybe a baby step forward toward an open discussion of what makes 'them' hate 'us' so much and how can 'we' justify us voluntarily surrender so quickly our personal and civil liberties when facing a relatively small threat and in exchange for some largely illusory 'security', it is a tense, generally well acted movie. It's not clear what made Samir, a native of Sudan, join the US Army Special Forces - we see his father dying inside an exploding car but from that to an elite US Army career and then deep cover agent - before or maybe after having fought side by side with the Afghan freedom fighters (now known to us as terrorists) against Russian invaders? Omar, Samir's Islamic Brotherhood terrorist best friend meets him in a Yemeni prison and it's not clear how he ended up there either after completing finishing school in Switzerland. We do hear from Omar that he resents 'the West' for killing and humiliating his brothers and sisters but... from Switzerland to Yemen? Yemen is one of the least likely place to find Westerner targets. The US government agents, especially the FBI, get a more realistic treatment - arrogant, brutal, unable and unwilling to comprehend or adjust to an unfamiliar reality, all too willing to forget about the niceties of actually following our laws when the opportunity to brutalize a US citizen abroad presents itself, sloganeering when there's a need to defend or explain less then honorable activities.As far as the plot goes, it's the expected spy thriller action movie. People are not always who they say they are, there's a lot of deception, a reasonable body count and, in the end, even though 'our side' seems to get the better of it, poor Samir is left trying to figure out for himself if whatever he did was right or even necessary while under intense bombardment from slogans and clich&eacute;s thrown at him by Special Agent Roy Clayton.""Traitor"" is not easy to watch. Even hinting at what might be ""the other side's"" views and motivations tends to make us uncomfortable and, while not really coming close to touching the root causes and motivations for today's Islamic terrorism, it comes close enough to make watching difficult. Sadly, because it only hints at possible causes and motives without fully exposing them, most viewers discussions about what they just watched aren't likely to deviate from the standard, often repeated, short, simplistic, depressing sound bites fed to us by big and loud talking heads that our valuable mass media likes to squeeze between male enhancer pills and diet plan or abs commercials.Since I watched ""Traitor"" on a Blu-ray disc, it's probably worth noting that there's little in the image where the Blu would offer a significant advantage over a DVD. The dark subject is appropriately painted on the screen with dark shades of brown, gray and yellow and the viewer attention is likely to focus more on the plot and characters interactions than on the largely non-existent vistas. The same can be said about sound - Dolby TrueHD - it's adequate but this story does not call for tremendous surround sound performances. Explosions, even when they happen, are integrated into the context of the story. The Blu-ray package comes with a second digital copy disk which is quite appropriate because watching the movie on a computer screen should be as good an experience as watching it on a home theater.I hesitate to recommend ""Traitor"" as an outright purchase even though the current Blu low price (8.99) should make it tempting. I did buy my copy and I am probably going to keep it. However, if in doubt, you're probably better off renting it and HD vs. DVD resolution won't make a big difference.",3,"Good effort, not quite 'brilliant'",1265846400,"02 11,

Much harder to see coming is the film's denouement, but that's only because of its extreme silliness.Cheadle is a decent enough actor, brave in going after the movies that has a pretty depressing message, but his range is limited and he never seems comfortable enough when he's serious giving off a flat affect that reduces his aura. Pearce is the most interesting as a decent ""religious"" FBI agent who acts as counterpart to Cheadle's ""religious"" double agent.Unfortunately the pacing was too slow for my taste. The were going for a realistic feel so I understand it was more of a character / social commentary film as opposed to a Rambo type feel where the good guy goes in guns blazing ready to take out every terrorist with a bow and arrow and a .50 calabur machine gun.While I have tried to get past the negative aspects of the film, it becomes quite apparent that the film just isn't anything special.

This is an entertaining cat and mouse bad guy / good guy? on the run from the government, hiding a bigger more sinister plot type yarn - it's of a  similar style to movies like Fugitive, and the more recent Body of Lies, but goes it's own (muddled at times) direction and is originally dramatic. All that said it tries to cover every angle of post 9/11 Terrorism fears and misinterpretations, and ends up a bit of a mess in places.

There are fanatical Islamics and Terrorists and also thinking Muslims.

762215,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0000ACOXL,Brian E. Erland,"[11, 13]","The tagline for the '08 film `Traitor' is ""The truth is complicated"". After viewing the movie I can only compliment the filmmakers for picking such a wise and appropriate phrase to encapsulate what unfolds before its audience. The occidental mind has yet to come to grips with an Islamic mindset that encourages its most fanatical followers to strap explosives to their bodies and detonate themselves in crowded buildings, transportation centers or any high traffic venue that will best unsettle the security of its adversaries. It is ""terrorism as theatre"" and all the world is its stage.In `Traitor' Don Cheadle delivers a marvelous performance as Samir a Islamic, Sudanese born American immigrant who after spending years in U.S. military intelligence apparently has a change of conscience and joins an extreme terrorist organization after being recruited by Jihadist and future best friend Omar (Said Taghmaoui). Said is also magnificent, the on-going conversations between Omar and Samir discussing the Jihadist mindset and mission and how they compare with past and present acts of aggression by America are searing, thought-provoking and nuanced. For me they make this movie worth the time and effort. That's not to say that there isn't anything else worthwhile in this film, but it is there relationship and intellectual debate that raises the film to a higher level.As for the rest of the film, well this isn't one of your typical fast paced action films. The storyline unfolds rather slowly, too slowly at times. But it does build momentum about halfway through will firmly hold your interest to the end. `Traitor' offers the viewer great performances, intellectual stimulation and political relevance. There is in my opinion two flaws that keep the film from receiving a -5 Star- rating. The `Big Moment' at the end is rather unrealistic for reasons I can't discuss without spoiling the surprise and secondly, the ultimate decision made by Samir was a little too black and white for a storyline focused on exploring the gray areas of faith, conscience and choosing sides.Footnote: Guy Pearce also delivers a stellar performance as the FBI agent pursuing Samir.",4,"""What Language Do You Dream In?"" ~ Faith, Sacrifice And The Greater Jihadi",1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,2171,"['tagline', ""'08"", 'film', 'Traitor', 'truth', 'complicated', 'viewing', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'compliment', 'filmmakers', 'picking', 'wise', 'appropriate', 'phrase', 'encapsulate', 'what', 'audience', 'occidental', 'mind', 'yet', 'come', 'grips', 'Islamic', 'mindset', 'most', 'fanatical', 'followers', 'strap', 'explosives', 'bodies', 'detonate', 'crowded', 'buildings', 'transportation', 'centers', 'high', 'traffic', 'venue', 'will', 'best', 'unsettle', 'security', 'adversaries', 'terrorism', 'theatre', 'world', 'stage.In', 'Traitor', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Samir', 'Islamic', 'Sudanese', 'born', 'American', 'immigrant', 'who', 'spending', 'years', 'U.S.', 'military', 'intelligence', 'apparently', 'change', 'conscience', 'extreme', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'being', 'recruited', 'Jihadist', 'future', 'best', 'friend', 'Omar', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'Said', 'also', 'magnificent', 'on-going', 'conversations', 'Omar', 'Samir', 'discussing', 'Jihadist', 'mindset', 'mission', 'how', 'compare', 'past', 'present', 'acts', 'aggression', 'America', 'are', 'searing', 'thought-provoking', 'nuanced', 'make', 'movie', 'time', 'effort', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'anything', 'else', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'there', 'relationship', 'intellectual', 'debate', 'film', 'higher', 'level.As', 'rest', 'film', 'well', ""n't"", 'one', 'typical', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'films', 'storyline', 'rather', 'slowly', 'too', 'slowly', 'times', 'build', 'momentum', 'halfway', 'will', 'firmly', 'hold', 'interest', 'end', 'Traitor', 'viewer', 'great', 'performances', 'intellectual', 'stimulation', 'political', 'relevance', 'opinion', 'two', 'flaws', 'keep', 'film', 'receiving', '-5', 'Star-', 'rating', 'Big', 'Moment', 'end', 'rather', 'unrealistic', 'reasons', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'spoiling', 'surprise', 'secondly', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'made', 'Samir', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'black', 'white', 'storyline', 'focused', 'exploring', 'gray', 'areas', 'faith', 'conscience', 'choosing', 'sides.Footnote', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'also', 'stellar', 'performance', 'FBI', 'agent', 'pursuing', 'Samir']",Traitor

762219,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0000ACOXL,C. B Collins Jr.,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed the film, Traitor, as a suspenseful drama written around a serious and challenging topic. The film is held together by a great performance by Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, a Sudanese born Islamic American citizen. Guy Pierce gives a great performance as an FBI agent on the trail of Horn. The film also uses the story of Samir Horn as a character study of a complex individual. The FBI agent played by Guy Pierce serves as a proxy for the viewer for as Pierce fits the pieces of the puzzle together, so also does the viewer. Pierce is the proxy for the viewer unraveling the actions, loyalties, and deeper motivations of a complex man who may or may not be suffering from conflicting values and cultural systems.Much of the action revolves around the cat and mouse dynamics of terrorism and counter-terrorism. However, it is the character study that balances the action that makes this film get 4 stars. The film presents us with the ambiguity as to whether Samir is a rogue secret agent who has become a terrorist or whether Samir is a double agent who is out on a thin limb as he infiltrates an organization of terrorists with little if any back-up. Thus the concept of 'traitor' is part of the dynamics for we are not certain as to whether he is a traitor to the US or whether he is a traitor to Islam. The resolution of the conflict could be viewed as contrived Hollywood wrap-up, but give the film a break for even though it tries to explore complex issues working inside the mind of a complex mind, the film must also deliver entertainment with no strings left hanging.

762220,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0000ACOXL,Chris Pandolfi,"[32, 37]","The movie is called ""Traitor,"" and the implication is that the main character, played by Don Cheadle, has betrayed his own country. But it's nowhere near that simple. Some think he's a traitor to the United States while others think he's a traitor to Islam. He may be a traitor to his own beliefs, his loyalties divided between his Muslim faith and his American upbringing. By the end of the film, no one is any closer to understanding what he believes, himself least of all. He's a double agent frequently confronted by conflicting ideologies, and it's slowly but surely tearing him apart. One way this movie succeeds is that we're able to feel for this character no matter what side he's on; we can sense the anguish he feels, the torment of being a misfit in every culture he immerses himself in. We see in his face the unease and guilt he's forced to live with everyday.Cheadle plays Samir Horn, who was born in Sudan but raised in the United States. Thirty years ago, his father was killed in a terrorist attack, although it's unclear which side was responsible; it may have been an anti-Muslim faction, but it may also have been devout Muslims who opposed his beliefs. Whatever the case, Horn is now a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant for the United States Army, someone trained to infiltrate terrorist organizations and gather information. It seems his loyalties have shifted; while in Yemen, he's caught selling detonators to a group of jihadists, and after a brief shootout, everyone is arrested. In prison, he befriends Omar (Sad Taghmaoui), who is apparently in league with people on the outside, people willing to risk incarceration or death to free their brother Muslims. A frenetic jailbreak ensues. Not long after, Horn becomes entangled in a terrorist conspiracy, one that would result in several major attacks on American soil.Two FBI agents have been assigned to locate and arrest Horn. One is Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce), who, interestingly enough, once considered World Religions as a college major. He claims to take his own Christian faith seriously, but unlike Horn with the Koran, we never see him reading from the Bible or quoting any of its passages. We're never told what Max Archer (Neal McDonough) believes, although it's obvious that, as far as his job is concerned, he's all about getting results as quickly as possible; in an early scene, he gets impatient with Horn and subsequently punches him in the stomach. Clayton is much more calm and collected, and he understands that you get information from a suspect by pushing his buttons, not by letting him push yours. Indeed, Horn is a tough nut to crack, probably because he knows how to keep secrets from both sides.To describe the plot any further would not only give too much away, it would also require a lot of explaining, more so than anyone would be willing to read. As Horn says, ""The truth is complicated."" It would be more accurate to say that the truth is elusive, simply because I'm not convinced he knows what the truth is. He probably no longer knows which side represents good and which side represents evil. His beliefs are divided between what he reads in the Koran and what he sees going on; one passage states that killing one man is like killing all mankind, yet he's surrounded by Islamic extremists who commit murder to get their point across. He's serious about his faith, but it's clear he doesn't always understand it. He certainly doesn't understand how certain ideas can be misconstrued out of all reason, such as Takfiri, or blending in. A Pakistani terrorist named Fareed (Aly Khan) baffles Horn by saying that jihadists living in America drink alcohol and eat pork in order to blend in. Both acts go against Islamic beliefs.Horn would probably argue that murder, no matter how justified, also goes against Islamic beliefs (I would make the same argument, although I'm well aware that many people would not). If there were no jihadists, if terrorism were to be eradicated entirely, Horn would not need to be a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant. He would not have to infiltrate enemy hideouts and pretend to be on their side. Only then would his mind be at ease; he could worship in peace without having to worry about suspicious activity in American and Muslim communities. Is it unreasonable to suggest that the vast majority of Muslims long for the same peace of mind? I don't think so. Neither is the idea that there's a gigantic difference between jihad terrorists and those of Islamic faith.That may ultimately be the point ""Traitor"" is trying to make, although it's difficult to tell with a story actively trying to be ambiguous. Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff and producer/co-story creator Steve Martin (yes, that Steve Martin) have crafted a political drama that forces the audience to think really hard, more about the main character's beliefs than about the actual plot. Themes of not belonging and divided loyalties are certainly not new, but that doesn't mean they're no longer used effectively; ""Traitor"" succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is Don Cheadle's believable performance. He above all else is what gets the story off the ground, allowing it to be much more than a run-of-the-mill thriller. He adds genuine emotional touches in the subtlest of ways, from precise eye movements to random breathing patterns. Essentially, he makes it real, especially since he never reveals which side his character feels most connected with.",4,Where Do His Loyalties Lie?,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,5461,"['movie',

In 1978 his father, a devout Muslim, was blown up in a car-bomb attack. Shortly thereafter Samir moves to the USA and is raised by his American mother. He then goes for a career in the Army and then... well, then he apparently falls in with some unsavory characters.The movie chronicles his time working undercover with a terrorist group. Well, possibly undercover. Jeff Daniels plays his controller and makes several comments that might lead one to wonder what Daniels' character's real agenda is.In the film we see the inner-workings of a terrorist cell. We watch as they stage actions in Spain and France and gear up for action here in the USA, coming to the country by way of Canada and Mexico. If nothing else this serves well to highlight the international nature of the problem.Samir is showing as being very much a man in conflict. Clearly he abhors terrorism and loves Islam. He's asked to do things by his controller that he believes are evil, but he's also asked by the terrorists to do things that are even more evil, bringing to mind the question, ""How much evil is allowed do be done in the name of good?""The performances all around are excellent.

He is arrested in Yeman as a terrorist, but subsequently breaks out of jail with several other terrorists bent on wreaking havoc against the United States.The most interesting part of the plot, however, is that Cheadle's character Horn, isn't a true terrorist. He's been planted there as an off the books operative of a U.S. government agency. Only one person knows of his whereabouts. Horn struggles with conducting terrorist operations which cause death and destruction even as he is helping the government.Unfortunately, half of this plot is not fulfilled. The plot line of his involvement with the U.S. government is cut off halfway through the movie for no apparent reason. The entire story is simply left to die and never addressed or explained again. The result is a run of the mill movie that leaves the viewer wondering what caused the director to end the most interesting element of the plot. At the end of the movie I simply couldn't believe it was over. There was so much more that could have been done with this movie.The only plus of this movie I can recommend is Cheadle's acting.

What was the director really trying to say? The message passed me by. Was this an inside view of terroism? A double agent? A man reacting to the horrible death of his father and a revenge movie? I just can't find the key, nothing I come up with makes sense, or fits all the pieces together.This film had a ton of 24 feel to it. Don Cheadle is not Keifer Sutherland, but I had the same kind of feeling from this film as I do watching 24. The production values were very similar. Traitor and 24 have similar editing, and definately the same kind of camera work. This is not bad, just a feeling.Don Cheadle is outstanding in this role. He is a truly amazing actor, with a huge range of skill.The film opens in 1970 something where young Samir, (Don Cheadle) witnesses his father blown up in a car bomb. The film them cuts forward to present day and we follow Samir all over the world joining a terrorist group making bombs. The film uses the poor titling technique to tell the viewer where they are in the world. We are always shown some kind of stock view of the city and then cut to a Hollywood set that should look like that country. It's a poor technique that grows old as the film moves forward.The story is exciting. The chase scenes, gamesmanship back and forth, and the double cross that is double crossed is all intriguing. The central question, who is Samir really aligned with, for which country is he a traitor? When the resolution actually happens, it was no surprise and was somewhat anti-climatic.The problem with this film was more about, so what? I cared about Samir, would he make it through here, would he escape prison, would he be killed there, would the bomb accidently blow up, etc. But why was this film made? What did we really learn from this?Rated PG-13, there is a lot of violence. Not much strong language. There is no nudity in this almost 2 hour film.This isn't a bad film. It isn't great.

762228,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B0000ACOXL,Danny G.,"[0, 1]","- Were my exact words to myself after seeing the surprise ending to Traitor! - I usually avoid Americans-as-victims type movies like the plague! But Traitor is not your typical terrorist/war porn movie. While there's some violence it is never gratuitous, gruesome or exploitative. What you are going to see is an intelligent story, granted it's a fantasy, but it makes many important points.First, and foremost, Islam does not condone the the killing of innocent civilians anymore than Christianity does. And we are reminded, by example, that the Klu Klux Klan perverted Christianity by striking fear in the hearts of thousands of people by burning crosses on their property, and by committing other very serious acts of violence against innocent civilians in the name of God and country!Another message we hear clearly is that killing innocent civilians is never justified, and the ends don't justify the means! Since this film review has a world audience, I would like to point out that the United States government has not learned this lesson either! The American fire bombing of Tokyo, Japan and Dresden, Germany during World War 2 are war crimes, plain and simple! The horrendous treatment of Native Americans during the 16th - 19th centuries are war crimes. The deliberate and/or reckless dropping of napalm on civilians during the Vietnam War is a war crime, too.The United States support of oppressive dictators, monarchs, and other assorted thugs is also criminal! But two wrongs don't make a right. And one not need become a thug, killer or terrorist to thwart thugs, killers or terrorists!One of the biggest problems facing the world today is a lack of education concerning what governments around the world do in their citizen's name. We all like to focus on the other country/person as the bad guy, while never owing up to our own government's sins. It so incredibly easy to point the finger!If all the crimes that the American government committed in its 232 year history were listed back-to-back, it would be a mile long. But the same could be said about many other governments around the world. So it begs the question - when will we (the Human Race) ever learn? Innocent civilians are the vast majority of the world's population. Don't we have any say in this? In my humble opinion, if you really want long-lasting change shove a mirror in your opponent's face, instead of of some weapon!

762229,A14PS3LPIO7UF8,B0000ACOXL,"Dawoud Kringle ""Renegade Sufi""","[4, 5]","Don Cheatle has always chosen interesting roles that hold great potential for social and human commentary. This is certainly no exception. His performance here was magnificent.Being an American born convert to Islam, I am familiar with the conflicting feelings a Muslim has to face. ironically, the answers are simple. But implementing them in our daily life is never simple. ""Traitor"" shows this perfectly.Cheatle's character illustrates this perfectly. From his childhood, he was exposed to political violence. Yet at heart, all he was interested in was living as a pious Muslim. Which brings us to the crux of the matter; politics. When a social structure arises that is based on ANY ideology, inevitably, a point will come when those in leadership positions will have to chose between adhering to their ideological principles at the expense of their political power, or ""adjusting"" their principles for the sake of political and / or economic expediency. All too often, human beings make a very poor choice in this. The whole of human history will provide an excellent model to study this phenomenon.So, getting back to the movie, we are left with a great many open questions, or so it would seem. Was Cheatle's character the traitor, or did he truly adhere to the principles of Islam and chose the lesser of many evils? How does one explain Fareed, who drank alcohol and ate pork with the justification that he was simply blending in: something easily avoidable (which I can personally attest to)? Did the terrorist organization that Horn worked for betray Islam by turning their religion into a political agenda, and adapt methods that have no justification in Islamic spirituality? Did FBI Agent Clayton betray (or casually abandon) his family's Christian principles - and was Horn's devout Islamic beliefs responsible for exposing him to what he'd lost, or walked away from?There are no easy answers to this, either in art or in real life. We make choices every moment and must live with the results and consequences of these choices. Samir Horn was an object lesson in this.Finally, I want to say that I see in this movie not a single shred of anti-Islamic or anti-American rhetoric. People who accuse ""Traitor"" of either of these  are missing the point. There is no political agenda here; only a human agenda; the agenda of coming to terms with what's within one's heart.",5,Quite moving,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,2381,"['Don', 'Cheatle', 'always', 'chosen', 'interesting', 'roles', 'hold', 'great', 'potential', 'social', 'human', 'commentary', 'certainly', 'exception', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'magnificent.Being', 'American', 'born', 'convert', 'Islam', 'am', 'familiar', 'conflicting', 'Muslim', 'face', 'ironically', 'answers', 'are', 'simple', 'implementing', 'daily', 'life', 'never', 'simple', 'Traitor', 'perfectly.Cheatle', 'character', 'perfectly', 'childhood', 'was', 'exposed', 'political', 'violence', 'heart', 'was', 'interested', 'was', 'living', 'pious', 'Muslim', 'Which', 'crux', 'matter', 'politics', 'When', 'social', 'structure', 'arises', 'based', 'ANY', 'ideology', 'inevitably', 'point', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'leadership', 'positions', 'will', 'have', 'chose', 'adhering', 'ideological', 'principles', 'expense', 'political', 'power', 'adjusting', 'principles', 'sake', 'political', '/', 'economic', 'expediency', 'too', 'often', 'human', 'beings', 'make', 'very', 'poor', 'choice', 'whole', 'human', 'history', 'will', 'provide', 'excellent', 'model', 'study', 'phenomenon.So', 'getting', 'back', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'great', 'many', 'open', 'questions', 'would', 'seem', 'Was', 'Cheatle', 'character', 'traitor', 'did', 'truly', 'adhere', 'principles', 'Islam', 'chose', 'lesser', 'many', 'evils', 'How', 'one', 'explain', 'Fareed', 'who', 'drank', 'alcohol', 'ate', 'pork', 'justification', 'was', 'simply', 'blending', 'something', 'easily', 'avoidable', 'can', 'personally', 'attest', 'Did', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Horn', 'worked', 'betray', 'Islam', 'turning', 'religion', 'political', 'agenda', 'adapt', 'methods', 'have', 'justification', 'Islamic', 'spirituality', 'Did', 'FBI', 'Agent', 'Clayton', 'betray', 'casually', 'abandon', 'family', 'Christian', 'principles', 'was', 'Horn', 'devout', 'Islamic', 'beliefs', 'responsible', 'exposing', 'what', ""'d"", 'lost', 'walked', 'away', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', 'either', 'art', 'real', 'life', 'make', 'choices', 'moment', 'must', 'live', 'results', 'consequences', 'choices', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'was', 'object', 'lesson', 'this.Finally', 'want', 'say', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'single', 'shred', 'anti-Islamic', 'anti-American', 'rhetoric', 'People', 'who', 'accuse', 'Traitor', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'political', 'agenda', 'here', 'only', 'human', 'agenda', 'agenda', 'coming', 'terms', 'what', 'one', 'heart']",Traitor

Cheadle's Samir Horn, a conflicted man born in Sudan but now an American, manages to quietly charm and thus challenge preconceived notions of what it means to be a Muslim, what it means to be a terrorist, what it means to care so deeply about an issue that you are willing to risk everything, and what it means to assume you know what lies underneath.  That Cheadle can convey all this in an otherwise impassive expression is impressive.The film opens first with Samir as a boy witnessing his father's death in a car bomb, and then with him as an adult in the midst of a secret arms deal in Yemen interrupted by a surprise police raid.  When Samir earns the respect of fellow Muslim convicts, the film starts down the labyrinth of terrorist cells, motives, and subterfuge, followed step by step by two eager FBI agents (Guy Pearce, memorable as Agent Clayton, and Neal McDonough).When the film started, I was worried that it would play into all the stereotypes that put Muslims into a neat box labeled ""terrorists,"" but Samir's girlfriend, whom he leaves behind, is an intelligent professional outraged  that the man she loves has dirtied the name of their faith.  And even some of the terrorists have doubts about what they are doing.  The behavior of the Americans isn't always ethical, either.  At the core of the movie, however, are two men, Samir and Clayton, who believe deeply in the line between right and wrong and who rely on their separate faiths.  Cheadle is more memorable inHotel Rwanda, and Pearce more memorable (ha!) inMemento, but both do admirable jobs in this film.Seasoned film goers will see the major twist long before it is revealed, but fortunately other, smaller surprises keep the plot interesting.

So it's an appropriate time for a movie like ""Traitor,"" a brilliantly acted and morally murky tale that was written (weirdly enough) by Steve Martin, but which is also held back by its twisty narrative and a narrative that sounds better in theory than in practice.Sudanese Samir Horn (Cheadle) was born in Sudan, but after his father was killed in a terrorist attack he was brought to the United States and eventually became a part of the army -- a specialist who infiltrates terrorist organizations. But it seems his loyalties are no longer to the US army -- he's become entangled in a group of terrorists and imprisoned in Yemen. And, of course, his special skills and knowledge come in quite handy when it comes to terrorist plots.But something is not quite right in this equation. A pair of FBI agents, Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), are sent after Samir.... but soon discover that his loyalties are not so easily identified. Just who is he a traitor to? At the same time, a plot is being put into effect that would kill countless people on Thanksgiving Day, and Samir seems to be involved...""Traitor"" is pretty clearly a movie meant to make you very, very uncomfortable, especially since it does some heavy delving into Muslim beliefs, divisions of loyalty, and the corruptions of text and belief that drive fanatical extremists to kill others. It gets too slanted at times -- the Muslim agent is portrayed as far more devout in his faith than the Christian one -- but it's a powerful piece of work, and a sympathetic look at the people torn between their personal beliefs and outside forces.Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff handles this in a more intelligent manner than your average action thriller, allowing the plot to seep and unfold gradually, and throwing new kinks into the storyline along the way. The violence is genuinely harrowing, and the script is pretty solid. The problem is that the complexity itself turns into confusing knots, and the ending falls rather flat compared to the tense, sleek movie that precedes it. I was left thinking, ""... that's it? That's what happens?""Cheadle is, quite simply, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors -- and he gives a quietly compelling, intensely powerful performance as Samir, able to convey all the division and confusion that his character feels. Pearce is a good if slightly less nuanced counterpart, far more conventional in his thoughts and approaches, but who learns a certain appreciation for Cheadle's character and the knowledge that the truth is not simple or straightforward. Assuming you can find ""the truth"" at all, rather than someone's personal approach.""Traitor"" leaves you feeling confused but exhilarated, and tackles the near-impossible questions of modern Islam and some of its fanatical followers.

Nowadays he's expanding his horizons, going into more dramatic territory, but I'd never pen him to write a story about terrorism and double-agents. Unfortunately, when Neal McDonough appears within the first five minutes of the film, I could tell this was going to be less than fun/good/watchable.Neal is awful as always, Don is understated, but good, Jeff is in the film for all of two minutes, and Guy Pierce (not Ritchie), actually gives the best performance of the film, which isn't saying much. However, it might not be the fault of these actors, but instead their terrible characters. The movie gives no reason to like 99% of the characters, and when stuff happens to them, you're more like, 'Oh well, when is this going to be over?'But mainly, the main problem this movie suffers from is lack of a cohesive point. Is it entertaining? Not unless you find a fictional view into the life of terrorism entertaining. Does it make you think? What's there to think about? If it's about conflicts between Islam, the merits of terrorism and stuff like that, then I frankly don't give a crap. Is it a political movie? It certainly has enough politics to turn anybody off, and a general sense of uneasiness not seen outside most horror films. And it certainly isn't a thriller, so what is it? A Jason Bourne knockoff? Hardly. While Don Cheadle's character is touted as being this great soldier, only one brief instance of this is shown. The rest of the time he gets the crap kicked out of him. I care about the character even less, as he can't even fight.It would have been much more watchable if it had better direction and editing. First off, the first thirty minutes of the film has Don Cheadle undercover in a Yemen prison full of terrorists. Complete bore, and useless. Easily could have been cut to 5-10 minutes. Hour's gone by, nothing of real note has happened. Easily could be 20-30 minutes at this point. The point is, this movie should have been no more than an hour and a half. Then there's the direction, which is expected considering the only major credit the guy had before this was writing the global warming disastor movie, ""The Day After Tommarow,"" which spell trouble right there. For example, there's an important scene on a bus, which done properly, would have been a great ironic moment, somewhat changing my negative opinion of the movie. As is, the scene is a confusing mess where you can't tell what the heck is going on.In summation, it's a thriller that doesn't thrill, a drama that isn't that dramatic, and a movie that wants you to think, but isn't worth thinking about. What movie these positive reviewers were watching, I don't know, but this movie suffers from bad direction and lack of a basic point. However, even with multiple trips to the editing room, and better direction, it's still a 3.5 effort at best with its drab subject matter. This movie was a traitor of my time.

Another Muslims = terrorists movie?  If Hollywood wants to produce such movies, then why not have a ""good"" movie about brave Afghan fighters (who are Muslim) going after the Taliban?  If you want to throw-in some U.S. Special Forces, then be my guest. ;-)  If this movie had been about one or two rogue Muslims, and the rest of the Muslim world (along with the Americans) fight against them. . .then again, perhaps I would feel differently. .  .. but certainly this movie does not do anything to improve American ideas about Muslims, and I expect it does just the opposite, feeds the hatred.  FYI, I'm not a Muslim, but I think it's unfair to characterize / judge or stereotype a certain group of people as has been done to Muslims, especially since 9/11.From beginning to end, Don Cheadle comes across as being VERY uncomfortable.

The movie experience, overall, is fast, slick, precisely edited (almost reminiscent of the Bourne syndicate!), and a complex enough plot to make it believable.This is perhaps a first of its kind movie that tries to portray terrorists' point of view, not trying to justify anything for any side, but at least explaining a little of their thinking. The questions raised by this movie are, IMO, brave and original. Consider this... ""The Americans were pirates and terrorists for the Britishers at one time. Look at where they are now""; or ... ""If a man hasn't found anything worth dying for, his life is not worth living.""Though the name is a bit too much of a give-away, it doesn't take away the interest from the story. I must warn here - overall the plot seems almost see-through for anyone paying enough attention towards the beginning, but there's more (complexities) where this came from... keep watching!The conviction, at least as shown by Chaedle's character Samir, is convincing, and his confusion upon being caught in the cross-fire is also excellent.  I just wish the same could be said of the other actors in the movie. In their attempt to appear with deadpan expressions, they come across as rather lame, but Chaedle saves the day.Overall a good movie, and very well made. 4 / 5.",4,"Excellent piece of filmwork, introspective and dark...",1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,1450,"['Don', 'Chaedle', 'done', 'excellent', 'work', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Reign', 'Over', 'Me', 'one', 'right', 'there', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'performance', 'concerned', 'movie', 'experience', 'overall', 'fast', 'slick', 'precisely', 'edited', 'almost', 'reminiscent', 'Bourne', 'syndicate', 'complex', 'enough', 'plot', 'make', 'perhaps', 'first', 'kind', 'movie', 'portray', 'terrorists', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'trying', 'justify', 'anything', 'side', 'least', 'explaining', 'little', 'thinking', 'questions', 'raised', 'movie', 'are', 'IMO', 'brave', 'original', 'Consider', 'Americans', 'were', 'pirates', 'terrorists', 'Britishers', 'one', 'time', 'Look', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'man', ""n't"", 'found', 'anything', 'worth', 'dying', 'life', 'not', 'worth', 'living', 'name', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'give-away', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'interest', 'story', 'must', 'warn', 'here', 'overall', 'plot', 'almost', 'see-through', 'anyone', 'paying', 'enough', 'attention', 'beginning', 'more', 'complexities', 'where', 'came', 'keep', 'watching', 'conviction', 'least', 'shown', 'Chaedle', 'character', 'Samir', 'convincing', 'confusion', 'being', 'caught', 'cross-fire', 'also', 'excellent', 'just', 'wish', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'actors', 'movie', 'attempt', 'appear', 'deadpan', 'expressions', 'come', 'rather', 'lame', 'Chaedle', 'day.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', '4', '/', '5']",Traitor
762244,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0000ACOXL,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","If you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor, then peep this movie and let the lightbulb turn on. Cheadle is amazing in TRAITOR. It's a credit to his ability to keep things internal yet unveil just enough of what's going on inside that not only are you uncertain as to his character's true allegiance, but you grow to care and you cross your fingers hoping that he's on the right side.What sort of person might you become had you, as a child, witnessed a loved one become a casualty of terrorism? The answer to this is what haunts this film, and is what truly drives the storyline. Young Samir Horn (Cheadle), having seen his father killed in a car bomb explosion, grows up to be an operative in the U.S. Army's Special Forces. But, years later, an FBI-affiliated raid in Yemen catches him selling semtex to a terrorist cell, and Samir ends up in a Yemeni prison. He eventually breaks out, thanks to a befriended jihad leader. His new friend gives Samir a choice: Samir can now go his own way or he can become part of the cause. Samir goes for the latter.Someone once told Samir: ""It's clear to me that you're not a fanatic. An opportunist, perhaps, but not a fanatic."" Early on I couldn't help wondering: Is Samir merely a mercenary arms dealer? Or is he himself a terrorist? Or something else?Back in Washington, the FBI Special Task Force sniffs out an alarming international conspiracy, connecting it to bombings which took place in Rome, Berlin and Amsterdam. And Samir's name surfaces. Special Agent Clayton (Pearce) is tasked with getting at the truth. And because this film is an intelligent, circuitous thriller, that truth is a hard-gotten thing. As he probes and prods and encounters traces of Samir around the globe, even amidst further bombings, Clayton unearths just enough contradictory facts to make him question Samir's role in these acts.I was surprised at how easily I was drawn into this movie. TRAITOR is dark and provocative cinema, and even though it boasts other fine actors, whether the film works or not hinges on Don Cheadle. Thankfully, plonk this guy down in any character-driven story and he'll shine. TRAITOR trades on politics and dirty espionage, and uses Samir Horn as a prism thru which it explores moral complexities and the underpinnings of faith and religion and what constitutes a good man. How far do you go to do the right thing? Is the big picture worth an innocent life or two? Cheadle kept me in the dark as to which side he's on, until the film decided it was time to show me. Yet the film makes it clear that Samir Horn is a devout Muslim (although, to segue a bit, when Agent Clayton describes Samir as a devout Muslim, Samir's mother corrects him: ""He's a Muslim. I don't believe there is a sliding scale."" This is one more religious contention brought up here). Even as Samir gets sucked in deeper and deeper into the world of terrorism, there's no questioning that Samir feels true remorse over the killings he's caused. The question is, is that regret enough to dissuade him? Again, which side is he on?Samir's friendship with a terrorist makes things murkier. Said Taghmaoui, who plays Omar, is very good, certainly good enough that I couldn't help but like the guy. It helps, I guess, that Omar, even though steadfast to his cause, is nuanced enough and conflicted enough that smidgens of humanity leak out.The bonus features on this single disc: an audio commentary by Don Cheadle and Writer/Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff; two featurettes - ""Action!"" (4:39 minutes, concerning the film's action set pieces) & ""International Espionage"" (5:11 minutes, concerning the film's international on-site locations); and the movie trailer.TRAITOR doesn't come with wall-to-wall action; the explosions and tussles and gun fights are spread throughout the film and done to serve the story, instead of as mere eye candy stuff. Samir Horn comes off as more realistic, in the sense that he may have been Special Forces but that doesn't mean he can go up against sheer numbers and win out. On a one-on-one, though, he can hold his own. And, we find out, he can't dodge bullets.I like that there's no easy way out here. As the film goes on, options narrow to inevitable, gut-wrenching decisions; the light at the tunnel's end grows dimmer. A man of true faith is caught in the crosshairs and forced to commit heinous acts, and then has to face up to what he's done. Don Cheadle completely embodies his character, and makes you feel Samir's soul-wrecking torment and revulsion. And, by this point, if you haven't yet caught on that Don Cheadle is a fantastic actor...",5,"Don Cheadle owns this movie!

762248,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B0000ACOXL,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 1]","Indeed, as the tagline for ""Traitor"" states, the truth is complicated.  As the film progresses, it becomes ever more complicated.  Soon Samir Horn, the traitor, is unable to tell anyone the truth about who he really is.  He is trapped in many prisons, both physical and spiritual, and is being pulled in many directions.I am reviewing the Anchor Bay release of ""Traitor.""  Normally, I don't watch the DVD's special features; however, ""Traitor"" was so intriguing that I couldn't resist.  The commentary provided by director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (screenwriter of ""The Day After Tomorrow"") and lead actor Don Cheadle (who portrayed Samir Horn) was outstanding.  During many commentaries, the actors and production crew reminisce about past events that have nothing to do with the film.  Not so with ""Traitor.""  I soon learned that the Yemen scenes were filmed in beautiful Morocco.  Nachmanoff foolhardily didn't get a permit to film in London's subways.  Cheadle was clipped by a car while being filmed crossing a street.  Many of the Moroccan extras used in the prison scenes couldn't speak English but were fine actors in their own right.  Several Muslim actors gave advice on Muslim customs and beliefs that were incorporated into the film.  Nachmanoff's younger brother, a lawyer, gave him legal jargon for the film.  I also learned that Cheadle and Guy Pearce are very athletic and did a lot of their own stunts.  Most importantly, Nachmanoff stated how he wanted to focus on the journey that Samir Horn undertakes rather than the ultimate act of terrorism at the film's finale.  Don Cheadle so aptly describes his character as being "". . . Caught between a rock and a hard place.""The commentary was also educational.  I learned that Nachmanoff distinguished certain scenes from others by using the bleached bypass process which gives a scene a lighter, bleached-out look.  (Personally, I didn't care for this effect.)  Some buildings were extended by using CGI.  Cranes were used to create unusual overhead camera angles.In order to give ""Traitor"" an international flavor, the film was shot in Morocco, London, Toronto, Marseilles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.  The viewer will appreciate and learn more about these locales, especially those in Morocco, if they watch the DVD`s special feature:  ""International Espionage:  An In-Depth Look at Traitor's Exotic Locations.""  (Morocco is gorgeous; I'd love to go there on vacation.)  It was interesting to learn that few sets were built.  Most scenes were filmed by small crews on location.The viewer will see Cheadle train for the prison fight scenes in ""Action!  The Stunts and Special Effects of Traitor.""  This short feature was exceptionally fun to watch.  We learn that Cheadle has a background in fighting.  We witness cars and buildings explode.  We also learn how the stunt is performed when a young terrorist is thrown off a bridge and onto the train tracks below.Overall, the features for the Anchor Bay release of ""Traitor"" are excellent.  My only complaints was that there isn't a special feature that provides the deleted scenes.  Cheadle and Nachmanoff spoke about them, making me wish I could view them.  Also, the print for the names of locations was very small.  I had to scoot closer to the television to see them.  Same with the subtitles for those speaking in Arabic.  You had to look hard and pay close attention because they were small and were soon gone.  Also, Anchor Bay's release didn't have a reproduction of the movie poster like so many others have had.  However, I am thankful that there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired, like myself, and the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Inside the DVD jewel case, there are two $3 coupons that can be used towards the purchases of ""Righteous Kill"" and ""Surfer, Dude.""  (I have scanned and posted the DVD jacket, the coupons, and the disc.)  Also, the trailers included on the disc are for the following features:  ""Righteous Kill"" (looks like an excellent police saga starring Al Pacino and Robert Deniro), ""The Visitor"" (great drama, which I have already reviewed), ""Henry Poole is Here"" (looks bizarre but warmhearted), and ""Sleepwalking"" (another sweet drama I'd like to see.)As far as the film itself, I have not seen a more emotionally charged story dealing with terrorism since ""The Siege.""  Everyone gave excellent performances, especially Don Cheadle who deserves an Oscar.  His facial expressions were incredible.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, Samir Horn.  He is torn between his loyalty towards Islam and loyalty towards his country.  Most everyone thinks he's a traitor, including himself.  He begins to think that he has betrayed Islam for the innocent lives that have been lost.  To make matters worse, he virtually has no one to turn to but Allah.  Horn's mom, however, seems to have faith that he is still a good man.Anchor Bay`s release of ""Traitor"" is highly recommended viewing for those who enjoy political espionage thrillers.  You will be on the edge of your seat for the last fifteen minutes, as I was.  My heart was pounding in my chest.  The ending was a shocker.Wa alaikum assalam.",5,"Believed To Be A Traitor, Samir Horn Is Caught Between A Rock And A Hard Place (Great Film and Great Release From Anchor Bay)",1230595200,"12 30,

Cheadle plays a Sudanese born US Army vet trained in explosives who is seemingly working with Islamic terrorists... though who he is actually working with is not as it seems - even to himself.  There's a message in this film that the ends don't justify the means, and the characters are led to question whether it's right or just to kill for a cause just because you believe you are the good guys. Cheadle does an excellent job playing this troubled character, while Guy Pearce is the FBI agent who is pursuing him.  One interesting thing depicted in the film is how intelligence operations are complex and that terror groups are often being steered by government agents/informants, who in some cases lead what can be considered false flag terror - and the public reports about the events are based on disinfo created by government intelligence operatives.  This film encourages us to look deeper at what's going on and question anyone who believes they are killing or sacrificing lives for a god-sanctioned agenda.  The only weakness I found in the film was that there are a few loose ends in the film that don't get explained... but that's like real life where we can't find out everything.",4,Excellent Suspense Drama With A Message...,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1371,"['film', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'world', 'espionage', 'so-called', 'war', 'terror', 'view', 'advertised', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'truth', 'complicated', 'Cheadle', 'Sudanese', 'born', 'US', 'Army', 'vet', 'trained', 'explosives', 'who', 'seemingly', 'working', 'Islamic', 'terrorists', 'who', 'actually', 'working', 'not', 'even', 'message', 'film', 'ends', 'do', ""n't"", 'justify', 'means', 'characters', 'are', 'led', 'question', 'right', 'just', 'kill', 'cause', 'just', 'believe', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'Cheadle', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'troubled', 'character', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'pursuing', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'depicted', 'film', 'how', 'intelligence', 'operations', 'are', 'complex', 'terror', 'groups', 'are', 'often', 'being', 'steered', 'government', 'agents/informants', 'who', 'cases', 'lead', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'false', 'flag', 'terror', 'public', 'reports', 'events', 'are', 'based', 'disinfo', 'created', 'government', 'intelligence', 'operatives', 'film', 'look', 'deeper', 'what', 'going', 'question', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'killing', 'sacrificing', 'lives', 'god-sanctioned', 'agenda', 'only', 'weakness', 'found', 'film', 'was', 'are', 'few', 'loose', 'ends', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'explained', 'real', 'life', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'everything']",Traitor

I think perhaps the modern terrorist theme is just not good entertainment for me; like so many people who aren't interested in movies about the war in Iraq. It's too real.  And Islam always ends up looking bad (regardless of what side Cheadle is actually on).Cheadle's character is devout Muslin - and that is the only thing that is certain about him.  What his true intentions are, he may know but not even understand.  I think maybe the film tried too hard  (as evidenced by some reviewers saying it's difficult to explain the plot). In an effort to keep the audience guessing which side he is on, there is a lot of back and forth.  He's helping the terrorists (but isn't that how you gain their trust?); he's refusing to come clean with the FBI (isn't that just to maintain his cover?).  Every action could potentially be explained either way.  While this kept the suspense high, it also made the film slow if not a little boring.  Do I really care anymore?Overall, this is worth watching at least once.  Cheadle is a great actor and he carries this movie as well as he can with a somber/depressing topic.  This movie requires a viewer to pay close attention.

Don Cheadle's performance is simply outstanding and he does a fantastic job of crafting a character that you can both empathize and sympathize during the film. Guy Pearce gave a sub-par performance in my opinion because I just didn't care about any words that came out of his mouth in this movie ... which isn't normal for this actor.If any actor really surprised me in this movie it was Jeff Daniels. I actually thought Daniels did a fantastic job and I found myself paying more attention to the movie when his character was on screen. I say this ""surprised me"" because I am not a fan of Jeff Daniels in serious roles. I have a hard time seeing Daniels in serious movies after his role in Dumb & Dumber but he actually did a phenomenal job in this film.After the movie was over I kept asking myself why this wasn't a bigger hit at the box office. The only reason I can come up with is that this movie suffers from ""bad timing."" This movie is all about international conspiracies, crooked governments, and the protagonist can be considered a ""terrorist."" After 8 years of the Bush administration this fictional movie probably reminds audiences too much of reality.

762257,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B0000ACOXL,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[7, 10]","Throughout both 2007 and 2008, moviegoers saw what seemed like an endless string of movies focusing on or around the ongoing War on Terror. For a majority of these films, which ranged from character dramas (""Stop-Loss"" or ""Grace is Gone""), political thrillers (""Lions for Lambs"" or ""Rendition""), to just good ol' fashioned action films (""The Kingdom""), the response from audiences was far from welcoming. Most of these titles, along with a few others I didn't mention, suffered through a rather brief stint at the box office and didn't enjoy much more success on DVD. To me the lacking success for these films would seem to be enough to get the studios' attention, and make them aware that audiences just don't want to go to the movies to watch something that involves a topic that can be seen daily on any news channel known to man.Regardless of all of this, the political thriller ""Traitor"" starring Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce was released to theaters this summer. If memory serves me, this is merely the latest film released in the War on Terror genre; I'm calling it a genre due to the surprisingly large number of movies based on the subject that has been released thus far. I personally question the reasoning behind even releasing this movie in the first place, especially in light of all the losses the studios have accrued over the previous films; but I guess the various studio executives share a sort of ""It only takes one to make a difference"" mentality. So, does ""Traitor"" have what it takes to win over audiences even with the touchy subject matter or does it fall prey to the same general lack of interest that has befallen the rest of the genre?After a series of terrorist attacks in various locations around the Middle East and Europe, along with a prison break in Yemen, the U.S. government is desperately seeking answers as to who is responsible, especially in light of a new threat targeting the country's heartland. Assisting in the investigation is FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) who finds himself with a rather short list of suspects, and one man on his list is raising his suspicions more than the others. The person of interest is a former U.S. Special Operations officer named Samir Horn (Don Cheadle), who appears to have become involved with the very group that may be responsible for the attacks. However, appearances may be deceiving as the further agent Clayton digs, the more evidence he discovers to suggest that perhaps the truth is much more complicated than it initially appeared to be.What are the key components that are vital to a movie for it to be considered a thriller? Is it a great story, terrific actors and actresses, a hefty dose of the unexpected, or a general sense of uncertainty that will cause the audience to be on the edge of their seats at all times? The answer is that it's not just one of these items, it is all of them. Each of these components are key to creating a top-notch thriller that will keep audiences entertained and enthralled from start to finish, and possibly creating repeat business if all goes well for the film.In the case of ""Traitor"" many of those items were present, but not all of them. For the ones that made it into the film, there didn't appear to be any emphasis on consistently maintaining the quality of these components throughout the duration. What I mean by that statement is when there were genuinely thrilling sequences or moments of the unexpected, they would either end in a way that made them feel unoriginal or be followed shortly thereafter by something so obviously tired and clich&eacute; that you would have to be a fool not to notice. Basically just when the movie seems to be heading in the right direction it falls apart prematurely.The story for this film is intriguing, and the fact that we are delivered a viewpoint from both sides, lends the film some credit for trying to flesh out the how's and why's of the ongoing war. However, writer/director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (writer of ""The Day After Tomorrow""), fails to create a completely engaging film due to falling prey to numerous movie pitfalls; such as, an overuse of character stereotypes for both the terrorists and the government agents, predictability within the story, and essentially becoming too trite and generic in the end. Perhaps if the screenplay had been more polished and willing to go even deeper into the more unexplored areas of the war, which it drifted in and out of throughout the film's duration, and not been so overbearing with its various messages it was trying to get across; then perhaps the final product would have been better received, at least by this viewer.Even if the movie's storyline did run into its fair share of problems, one aspect of the film that cannot be slighted is the generally high-caliber cast, led by the talented Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda""). Cheadle gives a terrific performance as Samir, a man who has sacrificed so much in this war, to the point that he wonders if it will ever be enough; especially in light of the regret he feels over some of the decisions he's had to make along the way. In the role of the closest person Samir has to a friend, and one of the terrorist group's masterminds, is actor Said Taghmaoui (""Vantage Point""). Said brings a fresh, new approach to the terrorist type of role, not allowing him to be portrayed in a hackneyed, cookie cutter cut-out sort of way that I had expected. At times he almost gives his character a sense of morality (twisted as it may be), while providing some form of reasoning and motives for why he is willing to do and plan the horrendous acts his group will commit.As far as the quality of the characters goes, the two listed above is where the truly developed characters meet their end, and the stereotypical ones begin. Leading the way are actors Guy Pearce (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") and Neal McDonough (""Walking Tall""), who are both very talented actors in their own right, yet find themselves misused in this film. The two actors portray your typical, garden variety FBI duo; one of the agents is a level-headed, eternal optimist (Pearce) who believes in a suspect until he or she is proven guilty, and the other is a hot-headed pessimist (McDonough) who would rather lock a suspect up and throw away the key than actually get to any answers. Alongside them is Jeff Daniels (""Gettysburg"") as your typical government handler who knows much more about what is occurring than he is letting on, and for the sake of his mission and secrecy (and the storyline), he keeps the facts from everyone.Lastly, the various actors portraying the many members of the terrorist group were given the least to do in the entire storyline. Aside from Said's character, the other terrorists were nothing more than a bunch of nameless, evil men with no rhyme or reason to their apparent madness, who want nothing more than wanton violence and destruction to engulf the ""evil"" United States and its allies. Please, spare me the same old semantics I've seen and heard so many times before, it's beginning to grow tiresome. It's a shame that more wasn't done to capitalize on the talent at this film's disposal. At least, the entire cast did the best they could with the material they were given, so even at its most predictable and unoriginal moments, the film remains better than average.While ""Traitor"" did manage to keep me moderately interested from start to finish, albeit to varying degrees of interest; the movie's various pratfalls causes the film to devolve into being just another generic political thriller with high aspirations, yet poor execution.""Traitor"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",3,An Average Thriller With Tons of Wasted Potential...,1230336000,"12 27,

762258,A2X7NBUETXC19E,B0000ACOXL,Justin G.,"[0, 1]","Part spy thriller and part serious look at the roots of terrorism, Traitor is a compelling, if flawed movie. It's a complex tale starring Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) as Samir Horn, a former US Special Forces operative turned (maybe) jihadi. Guy Pearce (LA Confidential) plays the FBI agent trying to track down Horn and head off a major terrorist attack planned by the group Horn is now a part of. It's a fairly typical, post-9/11, post-Bourne Identity, globetrotting spy movie with all of the plot twists, double agents, and suspense you'd expect from the genre. It's also a bit heavy-handed in terms of political correctness, going out of the way to remind us that despite the actions of nearly every single Muslim character in the film, real Muslims are not terrorists, etc.Don Cheadle, one of the most underrated leading men in Hollywood, gives another first rate performance as Traitor's troubled protagonist. It's a credit to his acting skills that he makes even a terrorist (or is he?) arouse a degree of sympathy. He seems genuinely guilt-ridden, frustrated, and in over his head. My only complaint is that he seems too American at times, as if the hustling thief from Out of Sight is just under the surface. Pearce, who gave such a memorable performance in LA Confidential, is less impressive, which is due either to the lousy script he was given or the lousy Southern accent he affected for the role.Despite Cheadle's performance, Traitor never quite makes the jump from ""rent it"" status to truly memorable movie. Compared to the Bourne movies - an unavoidable comparison - Traitor falls well short of the mark. I appreciate what they were trying to do, but the movie was either too slow or way too fast, and even the ending, which seemed extremely clever at first, is pretty absurd once you have time to really think about it. Traitor is a solid C+ movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours, but doesn't have much to offer beyond that.",3,"Entertaining, but too flawed to really be effective",1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1955,"['Part', 'thriller', 'part', 'serious', 'look', 'roots', 'terrorism', 'Traitor', 'compelling', 'flawed', 'movie', 'complex', 'tale', 'starring', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'former', 'US', 'Special', 'Forces', 'operative', 'turned', 'maybe', 'jihadi', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'FBI', 'agent', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Horn', 'head', 'off', 'major', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'planned', 'group', 'Horn', 'now', 'part', 'fairly', 'typical', 'post-9/11', 'post-Bourne', 'Identity', 'globetrotting', 'spy', 'movie', 'plot', 'twists', 'double', 'agents', 'suspense', ""'d"", 'expect', 'genre', 'also', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'terms', 'political', 'correctness', 'going', 'way', 'remind', 'actions', 'nearly', 'single', 'Muslim', 'character', 'film', 'real', 'Muslims', 'are', 'not', 'terrorists', 'etc.Don', 'Cheadle', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'leading', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'rate', 'performance', 'Traitor', 'troubled', 'protagonist', 'credit', 'acting', 'skills', 'even', 'terrorist', 'degree', 'sympathy', 'genuinely', 'guilt-ridden', 'frustrated', 'head', 'only', 'complaint', 'too', 'American', 'times', 'hustling', 'thief', 'Out', 'Sight', 'just', 'surface', 'Pearce', 'who', 'gave', 'memorable', 'performance', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'less', 'impressive', 'due', 'either', 'lousy', 'script', 'was', 'given', 'lousy', 'Southern', 'accent', 'affected', 'role.Despite', 'Cheadle', 'performance', 'Traitor', 'never', 'quite', 'jump', 'rent', 'status', 'truly', 'memorable', 'movie', 'Compared', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'unavoidable', 'comparison', 'Traitor', 'well', 'short', 'mark', 'appreciate', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'movie', 'was', 'either', 'too', 'slow', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'even', 'ending', 'seemed', 'extremely', 'clever', 'first', 'pretty', 'absurd', 'once', 'have', 'time', 'really', 'think', 'Traitor', 'solid', 'C+', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'couple', 'hours', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'offer']",Traitor

When are people going to get past this whole ""black bar"" issue?  Growing up as a fan of widescreen was not easy for me.  Having to deal with VHS, for many years I couldn't watch movies any other way except for the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen), when some of my favorite films were filmed in 2.35:1 (cinemascope).  Then DVD came along, as well as some informative sites, and widescreen was finally getting some much needed attention.  Now we live in the year 2008 (soon to be 2009).  People are educated.  We know the difference between full screen and widescreen.  Widescreen TV's are almost common now.This whole ""black bars"" complaint nonsense should be behind us.  Yet it's not.  Here I sit with a new movie, ""Traitor,"" staring Don Cheadle, and the movie starts with the dreaded words I hoped to never read again: This film has been modified from it's original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen.  When the title starts it's in it's 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but once the titles are over and the movie starts it switches to 1.78:1, the size of a widescreen LCD/plasma.  I couldn't believe.  We're finally at the point where most studios are refusing to released cropped and modified DVD transfers, and here we have a movie that's been released on DVD in a cropped only version?  Not only that, it's cropped for widescreen TV's, an audience who likely knows what the black bars are for.This is offensive on so many levels I can't tell you.  I have no idea if the BluRay edition has this problem, but if it does, then buyers should return it and demand a refund.  Altering the image, even when it's altered 25% as opposed to 40%, is not allowed under any circumstances.Opps, it appears I forgot to review the movie.Well, the movie stars Don Cheadle as an FBI agent who's accused of being a traitor to the United States.  And the movie...well, the movie pretty much goes on from there.  Depending how early you figure out the secret will determine how much enjoyment you get out of the film.  I found it pretty predictable myself, but your millage may vary.  Sadly, even if this was Oscar worthy material I couldn't recommend this DVD with it's cropped image.  I suggest you stay away and let studios know that we, as true movie fans, will not accept cropped transfers, widescreen or not.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 2]","Don Cheadle stars as former U.S. Special Ops Officer Samir Horn and Guy Pearce plays the FBI agent hot on his trail in ""Traitor.""  The film opens with Horn as a child in Sudan learning his Muslim faith from his father.  Then we see Horn witness his father's death via a car bomb.Hurtle forward into modern times and we find Samir trying to cut a deal with Muslim terrorists.  He is captured in a raid in Yemen and soon finds himself offered assistance by the FBI in return for crucial information on terrorist cells all over the world.  When he refuses to help, he is left to rot in a Yemeni prison where he forms a close bond with a fellow Muslim named Omar (Said Taghmaoui).The pair, along with a number of Omar's cohorts, escape the prison and meet up with the Islamic Brotherhood.  From there, the film goes across the globe, allowing the viewer to witness a number of terrorists acts that are headed up by Samir's knowledge of weapons and of the Qu'ran.Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clayton (Pearce) and his team are trying to find out who is pulling off all of the terrorists bombings.  Soon enough Clayton pegs Samir as a prime suspect and the chase is one.The viewer is forced to question the motives of Samir from the very beginning.  Is he truly a terrorist?  Perhaps he is just a loyal fanatical Muslim who believes that glory awaits those who strike down the infidel?  Maybe he's doing this all to bring down the real bad guys?  You'll have to watch the film to find out, since saying too much more will spoil the film.Cheadle does an excellent job as the mysterious Samir Horn.  Guy Pearce is wonderful as the minister's son-turned-lawman, Clayton.  Said Taghmaoui is brilliant as the highly intelligent and near-fanatical Muslim believer, Omar.  The supporting cast, which features Jeff Daniels, the always reliable and completely underrated Neal McDonough, Alyy Khan, Archie Panjabi and Hassam Ghancy, give solid performances as well.What I personally found enjoyable about this film is that Islam is dicussed by fanatics, loyalists and outsiders who both fear and respect the faith.  Samir's interactions with Omar and Clayton on Islam are brilliant, and show the viewer that there's a whole lot more to Islam than blowing up the infidel and declaring Jihad on everyone.While the film does run a bit slow at times it is, overall, a tight suspense drama with just enough action to keep it interesting.  It is an intelligent film and I highly recommend it to people interested in the subjects of espionage, terrorism and religion.

But one thing that they showed us are facets of terrorism that we could interpret as explaining things that actually exist in reality-- and consistent with what we expect. Among them:1. While terrorism is a heavily Arab dominated enterprise, trouble spots could come from any type of people. The people that were recruited into sleeper cells were not Arabs.2. The movie beautifully illustrated the REASONING that many of the terrorists used. These people blend in with the mainstream population very convincingly.3. There was attention to detail in presenting the plots to the viewer.On the bad side:1. It would not have taken much more effort for the director to give us a bit more detail about the non-Arabs that were recruited as sleeper agents. What other type of motives might people who go into sleeper cells have?2. The amount of fortuitous events that would have been necessary for Cheadle's character to become positioned in the terror cell in the way that he was stretched the limits of imagination.3. It is hard to believe that any Muslim would go against other Muslims *just* because they disagreed about whether killing infidels was a betrayal of Islam.

Belle ""lizzabelle, English major nerd""","[0, 1]","This is one of those movies you really have to pay attention to or you'll miss something, like Deja Vu with Denzel Washington. Don Cheadle plays a Sudanese man who is a devout Muslim with Special Forces army training who appears to be helping terrorist groups with ""random"" bombings in the name of Allah, a bit like September 11. Guy Pearce plays the FBI agent also versed in the Koran and Arab studies looking to find and put a stop to the bombings and the terrorists behind them, including Cheadle. It's difficult to summarize the plot without spoiling it but that is the jist of what happens without ruining the movie.The acting in the film is excellent. Cheadle gives his usual phenomenal performance and his grasp of the language (what dialect I am not sure) seems to be well rehearsed, as if he has been speaking it his entire life. Pearce, who I have seen only once before in The Count of Monte Cristo, also does a great job as a stoic and confident FBI agent. The box says Jeff Daniels is in the movie also, but his role, while important, is quite small.

762272,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B0000ACOXL,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Traitor"" is a cleverly named 2008 film about a US effort to track and bring down an Islamic terror cell before they can execute their mission. I thought the simplicity of the title has great depth and says alot about the dynamics of battling terrorism and the murky world of intelligence that is now the new front line, as alliegances are never totally clear in this game of cat and mouse. Even though the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan still carry some of the standards of conventional war, the real enemy who began the conflict has a global reach with soldiers whose camoflauge is an understanding of Western culture and shadowy financial networks which fund their operations.This movie was filmed in 2007 when the conflict against terrorism reached its zenith, with the troop surge in Iraq and the subsequent dropoff in US casualty statistics in the Sunni Triangle as the newly formed Iraqi Army began to take over combat operations.  Many US soldiers originally stationed in Iraq were transferred to Afghanistan, signalling the transitional period in the war itself.This movie (along with Ridley Scott's ""Body of Lies"") were made to portray the on-the-ground intelligence struggle that was enabled by the conventional Coalition Force, as the US agents in both films center their investigations on ficticious and secretive  terror cell leaders that based their operations in the Middle East, but had been successful in conducting attacks in Europe, much like the Madrid train bombing in 2004 and London in 2005. The operation in ""Traitor"" is geared to capturing ""Nathir"", a Bin Laden type mastermind/finacier who always seems to be watching his men, but remains a ghostly figure.This movie is an excellent portrayal of both sides and the fast paced battle of wits that sends operatives racing around the globe in the attempt to make their move first. Don Cheadle is amazing as Samir Horn, an ex Us Army Special forces operative who was embedded in with the Mujahadeen on the Pakistani/Afghan border during the Soviet war in the 1980's, a period that saw the CIA support many Jihadists it would later seek to destroy, among them Osama Bin Laden. Horn, being a Sudanese/American (whose father was a influential cleric in the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1970's), is a conflicted character in the classic sense of the word, as the viewer is never quite sure which side has his real loyalty, hence the genuis of the title. In the dirty world of double agents, even the hardest of men can have a crisis of conscience. This proves to be a major theme, as Horn finds himself in a Yemeni prison after an weapons deal gone wrong, and creates a basis of trust with Omar (Said Tagmahoui), the operational leader of Nathir's cell. The onscreen chemistry between Cheadle and Taghmaoui is powerful, as both actors give great preformances which expose the subject of fraternity that exists in even the worst of terrorist groups, who despite their demonization, show a strong belief in religion and camraderie. Taghmaoui is well known for his role in the 1999 film ""Three Kings"" about the first Iraq War. He really puts a human face on a terrorist, one who eventually develops doubts as to the ""sacred"" nature of his work.Other standout preformances are from Jeff Daniels, an intelligence contractor whose scruples are constantly in question, and Guy Pearce and Neal MacDonough, the FBI partners who are on Horn's trail, yet clearly don't have the full picture on his operation. The barrier between interagency jurisdictions is a strong statement about national security and the fight against American enemies, as it seems that the sharing of information is not always practicalbe (the films gives examples of how ""breaches"" can occur). This was an action packed and contemporary film, that provided an entertaining story line while adhering to alot of current realities. The 2010 documentary ""American Jihadist"" came to mind after I watched ""Traitor"", as the the subject of the doc is Clevin Holt (aka Isa Abdullah Ali), a former American soldier who converted to Islam and travelled the world fighting ""jihad"" in the 1970's,80's and 90's. Horn is definatley in this kind of mold. He is a devout Muslim soldier, yet one who is very westernized, hence the major conflict in the film.",4,War on Terror spy thriller,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,4266,"['Traitor', 'cleverly', 'named', '2008', 'film', 'US', 'effort', 'track', 'bring', 'down', 'Islamic', 'terror', 'cell', 'can', 'execute', 'mission', 'thought', 'simplicity', 'title', 'great', 'depth', 'alot', 'dynamics', 'battling', 'terrorism', 'murky', 'world', 'intelligence', 'now', 'new', 'front', 'line', 'alliegances', 'are', 'never', 'totally', 'clear', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Even', 'wars', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'still', 'carry', 'standards', 'conventional', 'war', 'real', 'enemy', 'who', 'began', 'conflict', 'global', 'reach', 'soldiers', 'camoflauge', 'understanding', 'Western', 'culture', 'shadowy', 'financial', 'networks', 'fund', 'operations.This', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '2007', 'when', 'conflict', 'terrorism', 'reached', 'zenith', 'troop', 'surge', 'Iraq', 'subsequent', 'dropoff', 'US', 'casualty', 'statistics', 'Sunni', 'Triangle', 'newly', 'formed', 'Iraqi', 'Army', 'began', 'take', 'over', 'combat', 'operations', 'Many', 'US', 'soldiers', 'originally', 'stationed', 'Iraq', 'were', 'transferred', 'Afghanistan', 'signalling', 'transitional', 'period', 'war', 'itself.This', 'movie', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Body', 'Lies', 'were', 'made', 'portray', 'on-the-ground', 'intelligence', 'struggle', 'was', 'enabled', 'conventional', 'Coalition', 'Force', 'US', 'agents', 'films', 'center', 'investigations', 'ficticious', 'secretive', 'terror', 'cell', 'leaders', 'based', 'operations', 'Middle', 'East', 'had', 'been', 'successful', 'conducting', 'attacks', 'Europe', 'much', 'Madrid', 'train', 'bombing', '2004', 'London', '2005', 'operation', 'Traitor', 'geared', 'capturing', 'Nathir', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'type', 'mastermind/finacier', 'who', 'always', 'be', 'watching', 'men', 'ghostly', 'figure.This', 'movie', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'sides', 'fast', 'paced', 'battle', 'wits', 'racing', 'globe', 'attempt', 'make', 'move', 'first', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'amazing', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'ex', 'Us', 'Army', 'Special', 'forces', 'operative', 'who', 'was', 'embedded', 'Mujahadeen', 'Pakistani/Afghan', 'border', 'Soviet', 'war', '1980', 'period', 'saw', 'CIA', 'support', 'many', 'Jihadists', 'would', 'later', 'seek', 'destroy', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'Horn', 'being', 'Sudanese/American', 'father', 'was', 'influential', 'cleric', 'Muslim', 'Brotherhood', '1970', 'conflicted', 'character', 'classic', 'sense', 'word', 'viewer', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'side', 'real', 'loyalty', 'hence', 'genuis', 'title', 'dirty', 'world', 'double', 'agents', 'even', 'hardest', 'men', 'can', 'have', 'crisis', 'conscience', 'be', 'major', 'theme', 'Horn', 'Yemeni', 'prison', 'weapons', 'deal', 'gone', 'wrong', 'basis', 'trust', 'Omar', 'Said', 'Tagmahoui', 'operational', 'leader', 'Nathir', 'cell', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'Cheadle', 'Taghmaoui', 'powerful', 'actors', 'give', 'great', 'preformances', 'expose', 'subject', 'fraternity', 'even', 'worst', 'terrorist', 'groups', 'who', 'demonization', 'show', 'strong', 'belief', 'religion', 'camraderie', 'Taghmaoui', 'well', 'known', 'role', '1999', 'film', 'Three', 'Kings', 'first', 'Iraq', 'War', 'really', 'human', 'face', 'terrorist', 'one', 'who', 'eventually', 'doubts', 'sacred', 'nature', 'work.Other', 'standout', 'preformances', 'are', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'intelligence', 'contractor', 'scruples', 'are', 'constantly', 'question', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Neal', 'MacDonough', 'FBI', 'partners', 'who', 'are', 'Horn', 'trail', 'yet', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'picture', 'operation', 'barrier', 'interagency', 'jurisdictions', 'strong', 'statement', 'national', 'security', 'fight', 'American', 'enemies', 'sharing', 'information', 'not', 'always', 'practicalbe', 'films', 'examples', 'how', 'breaches', 'can', 'occur', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'contemporary', 'film', 'provided', 'entertaining', 'story', 'line', 'adhering', 'alot', 'current', 'realities', '2010', 'documentary', 'American', 'Jihadist', 'came', 'mind', 'watched', 'Traitor', 'subject', 'doc', 'Clevin', 'Holt', 'aka', 'Isa', 'Abdullah', 'Ali', 'former', 'American', 'soldier', 'who', 'converted', 'Islam', 'travelled', 'world', 'fighting', 'jihad', ""1970's,80"", '90', 'Horn', 'definatley', 'kind', 'mold', 'devout', 'Muslim', 'soldier', 'yet', 'one', 'who', 'very', 'westernized', 'hence', 'major', 'conflict', 'film']",Traitor

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 5]","Jeffrey Nachmanoff's ""Traitor"" is a tense, well-paced thriller that keeps us on the edge of our seat, at the same time aiming for our most visceral and human emotions.  It challenges us to consider the border between political and religious extremism and sincere, deeply held patriotism and faith.  I was a little surprised that Kennedy Center Honoree Steve Martin, better known for Wild and Crazy comedy, wrote the story Nachmanoff adapted into a taut screenplay.Don Cheadle should receive an Oscar nomination in the lead role of Samir Horn.  Samir is not a one-dimensional character and Cheadle embodies him with a focused yet larger than life performance.In the opening scene we see a young Samir in Sudan, in a room praying with his devout Muslim father.  Then something happens that we have no trouble understanding colors Samirs thoughts and beliefs and motivations for the rest of his life.We see Samir in modern times dealing sophisticated explosives to an Islamic terrorist group in Yemen.  Government agents burst in on the deal, taking Samir and the terrorists into custody.  It is implied in Yemen this involves frequent beatings and long imprisonment.We are introduced to a pair of FBI agents.  Max, the hot-headed one is played by Neal McDonough.  The thoughtful one, Roy Clayton, is played by Guy Pearce, who grew up in Australia but once again immerses himself in the role of an American so well I had no difficulty believing Roy is the son of a Southern Baptist Minister. (I'm the son of a Roy and a Southern Baptist myself.)  Roy is the second most important character in the film.  He became interested in Arabic culture in college, and now works for the FBI combating terrorism.  Astute and perceptive, he understands that Samir has a sincere muslim belief and is not simply interested in blowing up all things not muslim.We find later that Samir is deeper still.  Jeff Daniels plays Carter, a U.S. Intelligence officer, the only person alive who knows that Samir is a double agent sent to infiltrate a secret Islamic terrorist organization.Much of the suspense in the film is generated because Carter (and by extension the audience) doesn't know if Samir has ""gone to the other side"".Said Taghmaoui plays Omar, a member of the secret terrorist group who brings Samir into the fold, and in another fine wrinkle of the textured screenplay, we get to see many shades of gray even among the terrorists.The film asks difficult questions and does not imply that there are easy - or any - answers.  If you have the most sincere patriotism or faith, how many innocent people can you kill in the name of your country or faith?  Fanatics may answer ""however many it takes"", but Samir and Roy both have doubts, and you believe that their personal faith informs their decisions.This is a thoughtful thriller and if you're interested in such things - you should see it.

762275,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0000ACOXL,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","It seems as though many people in the US have forgotten what happened on September 11th. Sure, the date remains fixed in our memories, but as the days progress beyond that point, we drift further and further away from the fact that an attack was launched on American soil that left 3000 dead. We feel complacent that another attack will never happen. It is such an attack that lies at the center of TRAITOR.The film begins with a slow buildup that delivers a final punch worthy of great thrillers. The action is used sparsely but the story is more full than most films of this sort. And the acting of Don Cheadle shows just how good he truly is.Cheadle stars as Samir Horn, born in the Sudan but now a US citizen. Having served in Afghanistan during the first initiative there, he made the decision to stay and to look deeper into the religion of his youth. This led to his becoming and explosives expert as well as an arms dealer.Involved in a major deal, he is captured along with the group's ringleader, Omar (Said Taghmaoui). During their confinement to the typical movie style Middle Eastern prison, Omar begins to see that Samir is not your typical mercenary. Samir believes in the Koran and its teaching as witnessed in his defense of a poor prisoner by the jail yard bully.The two become close and when the time comes for Omar to escape, he takes Samir along with him. Using his knowledge, expertise and ability to get the explosives needed for a major project they have planned, Samir becomes part of the group.Running concurrently with this story is that of FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Straight laced all the way, Clayton has been trying to stop terrorists abroad when his path crosses that of Samir. That ended when Samir went to prison. It begins anew after an explosion in Spain where Samir was sighted.The film deals with the life of a terrorist as he plots out the next major attack. It also runs into the spy thriller mode when it shows that this group has infiltrated the US with spy cells just waiting for the command to do damage.A major twist in the story presents itself late into the film that turns the whole story around. If you paid attention while watching the preview for the film you guessed it already. *SPOILER*  It turns out that Samir is actually working for the US government in the form of official Jeff Daniels, the only person to know this fact.The twists add to the story as Samir is conflicted in what to do. He lives to serve God and country and yet feels that to serving his country he has abandoned God. Driven to desperate acts to protect us from the terrorists, Samir does things against the teachings of God. Keep in mind we're not talking Christian/Judeo God, we're talking God from the Koran.And that's what makes this film good on another level. It looks at the beliefs of the Koran and how the terrorists use that belief to foment the youths that they gather to die. At the same time, the sentiments of the Koran for peace are discussed.The main plan that the terrorists have concocted is one that could happen. It involves numerous explosions all over the country at once. And the chances of Samir to stop it grow slimmer with each moment as he attempts to cover both ends of the spectrum on this plot.Cheadle is fantastic, showing the acting skills needed to make this believable and not just making Samir another James Bond suave, sophisticate attempting to blend in. No, in Cheadle's performance we see a man conflicted who believes strongly in his religion but who knows that evil is not defeated easily.Guy Pearce does his usual stand up job as the more by the book agent trying to protect his country at all costs. The rest of the casts do a great job as well with Neal McDonough as Pearce's more violent prone partner and Alyy Kahn as the nefarious leader of the terrorists group.Thrillers today seem more intent on gadgets and tricks than on the gut level approach to real problems in today's world.

762289,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B0000ACOXL,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","I really wanted to love this film, and it started out strong.  The cinematography is both gritty and gorgeous and true to the story: to begin with the sunlight is overpowering, the brights that flow through windows or doorways or from the sky are washed out, and the shadows and subtle variations of dark are clear and nuanced; towards the end the sun was less apparent, it always seemed overcast.  This reflects the moral ambiguities that increasingly enter into the characters' visions: that overwhelm the clarity of faith, or of rightness and justice.  The camera movements are both precise and volatile, conveying a sense of the urgency and uncertainty of the situations depicted.  One could learn a lot from paying attention just to the visuals of this film.  I noticed, in particular, that Don Cheadle was always lit in a way to highlight the range of tonalities in his face while allowing him to stand out against a relatively dark background - there is a big difference between the techniques of lighting for pale and dark skin and cinematographer J. Michael Muro deserves a lot of credit throughout for his exceptional work on this film.  (He was also DP forCrashandThe Last Mimzy,FlickaandRush Hour 3-- especially for the last three films I think that the cinematography was easily the best thing about them.)  The acting (especially that of Don Cheadle as Samir) and the settings were also quite strong.When it comes to story, things are a bit less subtle.  I think of fiction film as involving four major components: (1) the cinematography (the filming); (2) the ""mise-en-scene"" (the filmed: including set, actors, props, etc.); (3) the story; (4) the theme.  In the best films, all of these components are in the service of the story -- if the cinematography calls too much attention to itself, or if an actor's presence overwhelms the film, it doesn't quite work.  Likewise, and I think this is the case with Traitor, a film can fail because the story is in the service of the theme.  In the best films, the theme emerges along with the story, but it doesn't feel like the story is simply designed to convey a message: the story has a life of its own and because it feels true and alive it also allows us as viewers to see something about life and this insight is the theme.Unfortunately, in this film, it feels as if the filmmakers designed the plot and the characters precisely in order to convey a message.  Even more troubling is the fact that they appear to have unwittingly introduced a deeper and more problematic message by employing stereotypes that would give a shorthand way of conveying the primary message.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't entertain and doesn't enlighten -- it does --  but I think the message could be more profound if they had been more focused on telling a story than on conveying a specific message.Roughly, the explicit message of the film is that the war on terrorism is complicated, that Islam is complicated.  While there are some who, in the name of Islam, would like to wage a violent war on Western democracy and the American style of capitalism that accompanies it, there are others who, in the name of the same faith, reject that violence and see Jihad as implying an internal struggle.  Don Cheadle's character Samir is designed precisely to illustrate this tension: he is willing to accept violence as a means to fight against the usurpation of Islam by militant extremists, because he is ultimately a man of peace who aims to overcome his own anger.  Although this character seems contrived by the writers precisely to illustrate something, Don Cheadle breathes life into him and he does appear to be real.  What makes the message heavy handed is the way that characters are constantly stating to each other the allegedly profound insights we are supposed to be gleaning from the plot: Neal McDonough and Guy Pearce play FBI agents who express, respectively, the stereotypically patriotic American point of view and a more nuanced point of view that gradually comes to respect Samir for his faith (conveyed in a very heavy-handed way during an extremely improbable  encounter between the agent and Samir in the final scene of the film).But what undermines even this apparently nuanced message about Islam (that faith is not the enemy, and that Islam has within itself the resources to combat its more extreme interpretations) is the implicit message conveyed within the story.  It turns out that, according to the story, the real terrorists, the guys who run things and call the shots, are really just opportunistic hypocrites.  The leaders of the terrorist cell that is at the heart of this story have lots of money, enjoy wine and women and cigars and nice cars.

His role as Paul Rusesabagina inHotel Rwandais breathtakingly good. So despite mixed reviews, I knew I'd be watching TRAITOR. I'm very glad I did.The War on Terror, the Iraqi occupation, and America's role in foreign affairs has been a popular topic in film of late. While most of these films were of poor quality (not the material just the films), and few had commercial success, these movies have intrigued me to no end. Weather the examination of extremism inA Mighty Heartor the guns&grit; of a film likeJarhead, I find these movies captivating for the simple reason that much of what takes place in them is as hard to quantify as the real events on which they are based. Aside from those on the the extremes of both political parties who see only in black or white, the majority of what has happened post 9-11 falls into a variety of shades of gray. Traitor is no exception.Formulaic at its core (how far will the protagonist push to achieve the 'greater good,' combined with an over taught story with loose ends galore) the film does ask valuable questions, usually through the experience of the protagonist Samir Horn, a former operative, now major suspect in a terrorism case. Cheadle gives Samir a depth and resonance of character that a lesser actor would turn into a mere stereotype. Cheadle proves once again that good acting can elevate marginal material.The questions surrounding Samir are counterbalanced by Guy Pearce's character Roy Clayton, a by-the-book FBI agent with seemingly no imagination who is responsible for tracking down Horn. The more Pearce searches, the more information and leads he discovers, the more Horn appears guilty. Of course things are never that simple, and its here where Pearce is strangely unable to anticipate other outcomes than Horn's ultimate guilt.About the lengths that an individual may go to provide 'security' for his country, it is only Cheadle's nuanced portrayal of the enigmatic Horn that makes this movie more than a popcorn spectacle. In his adept hands, it becomes a character study posing as a spy thriller, and a movie well worth watching. 3.5/5 stars.",3,Don Cheadle elevates an otherwise average movie,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,2192,"['Don', 'Cheadle', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'Paul', 'Rusesabagina', 'inHotel', 'Rwandais', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'knew', ""'d"", 'be', 'watching', 'TRAITOR', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did.The', 'War', 'Terror', 'Iraqi', 'occupation', 'America', 'role', 'foreign', 'affairs', 'been', 'popular', 'topic', 'film', 'late', 'most', 'films', 'were', 'poor', 'quality', 'not', 'material', 'just', 'films', 'few', 'had', 'commercial', 'success', 'movies', 'have', 'intrigued', 'end', 'examination', 'extremism', 'inA', 'Mighty', 'Heartor', 'guns', 'grit', 'film', 'likeJarhead', 'find', 'movies', 'captivating', 'simple', 'reason', 'much', 'what', 'place', 'as', 'hard', 'quantify', 'real', 'events', 'are', 'based', 'Aside', 'extremes', 'political', 'parties', 'who', 'see', 'only', 'black', 'white', 'majority', 'what', 'happened', 'post', '9-11', 'falls', 'variety', 'shades', 'gray', 'Traitor', 'exception.Formulaic', 'core', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'protagonist', 'push', 'achieve', ""'greater"", 'good', 'combined', 'taught', 'story', 'loose', 'ends', 'galore', 'film', 'ask', 'valuable', 'questions', 'usually', 'experience', 'protagonist', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'former', 'operative', 'now', 'major', 'suspect', 'terrorism', 'case', 'Cheadle', 'Samir', 'depth', 'resonance', 'character', 'lesser', 'actor', 'would', 'turn', 'mere', 'stereotype', 'Cheadle', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'acting', 'can', 'elevate', 'marginal', 'material.The', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'Samir', 'are', 'counterbalanced', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'character', 'Roy', 'Clayton', 'by-the-book', 'FBI', 'agent', 'seemingly', 'imagination', 'who', 'responsible', 'tracking', 'down', 'Horn', 'more', 'Pearce', 'searches', 'more', 'information', 'more', 'Horn', 'guilty', 'course', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'simple', 'here', 'where', 'Pearce', 'strangely', 'unable', 'anticipate', 'other', 'outcomes', 'Horn', 'ultimate', 'guilt.About', 'lengths', 'individual', 'may', 'go', 'provide', ""'security"", 'country', 'only', 'Cheadle', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'enigmatic', 'Horn', 'movie', 'more', 'popcorn', 'spectacle', 'adept', 'hands', 'character', 'study', 'posing', 'spy', 'thriller', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', '3.5/5', 'stars']",Traitor

I would probably ultimately rate this movie 4+1/2 stars, since there was, for me, a sense of having seen vaguely similar movies before. Don Cheadle does a great job acting, having to hold his cards tight as to which side he is on, the FBI or the terrorist group. (It seemed weird at the beginning that the FBI, not the CIA, raid the terrorist group in a Middle Eastern country, but I guess since the plot ends with an attempt in the US to blow up buses, the writers needed to rationalize the FBI's involvement at the outset. I'm also not any expert on how or whether the FBI operates around the world.) The best part of the movie for me was the notion that a person of God (in this case, Islam) would follow principles of his religion that are in alignment with the knowledge of his heart, requiring contemplation of ways to minimize damage to humans, while standing up against oppression, and (hopefully) enlightening the FBI agent at the end.",5,A Well-Done Movie That Gets You Thinking Afterwards,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,1028,"['Spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'summary', 'assume', 'other', 'raters', 'have', 'done', 'would', 'probably', 'ultimately', 'rate', 'movie', '4+1/2', 'stars', 'was', 'sense', 'having', 'seen', 'vaguely', 'similar', 'movies', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'great', 'job', 'acting', 'having', 'hold', 'cards', 'tight', 'side', 'FBI', 'terrorist', 'group', 'seemed', 'weird', 'beginning', 'FBI', 'not', 'CIA', 'raid', 'terrorist', 'group', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'guess', 'plot', 'attempt', 'US', 'blow', 'up', 'buses', 'writers', 'needed', 'rationalize', 'FBI', 'involvement', 'outset', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'expert', 'how', 'FBI', 'world', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'notion', 'person', 'God', 'case', 'Islam', 'would', 'follow', 'principles', 'religion', 'are', 'alignment', 'knowledge', 'heart', 'requiring', 'contemplation', 'ways', 'minimize', 'damage', 'humans', 'standing', 'up', 'oppression', 'hopefully', 'enlightening', 'FBI', 'agent', 'end']",Traitor

762303,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000ACOXL,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 8]","**1/2""Traitor"" promises to be one of the first mainstream American movies to actually get into the mind of an Islamic terrorist, but about halfway through, it loses the courage of its convictions and opts for Hollywood artificiality instead.Don Cheadle plays Samir Horn, a devout Muslim who supplies terrorist organizations with the materials they need to carry out suicide bombings.  Guy Pearce is Roy Clayton, the FBI agent who is hot on Samir's trail through most of the movie.Although this is fairly engaging as international cat-and-mouse chase stories go (the movie takes us from Yeman to Paris to London to Toronto to Chicago and a number of places in between), a crucial plot twist in the middle (I won't reveal what it is) seriously undercuts the aura of credibility the movie has managed to establish up to that point.  The script is further compromised by a series of increasingly improbable plot points that eventually take the movie out of the realm of reality and deposit it right into the heart of movie-land fantasy, with the climax ranking as one of the most purely preposterous and almost laughable resolutions we`ve come across in quite some time (could this be the influence of Steve Martin, who, along with writer/director Jeffrey Nachmanoff, came up with the idea for the story?).Cheadle and Pearce are both stolid and effective in their roles, while Said Taghmaoui acquits himself well as Samir's suicide bomber friend.  The movie works hard at being fair to both sides of the conflict; thus, we're constantly being reminded that there are many more good Muslims in this world than there are bad ones, just as there are more good Christians than bad Christians and good Americans than bad Americans.  And the movie does try to explore some of the mental and moral anguish taking place deep in Samir's tortured soul.  But that midpoint compromise keeps ""Traitor"" from becoming anything more than just another Hollywood take on one of the more serious issues of our time.",2,a movie with potential that ultimately loses its nerve,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,1992,"['**1/2', 'Traitor', 'promises', 'be', 'one', 'first', 'mainstream', 'American', 'movies', 'actually', 'get', 'mind', 'Islamic', 'terrorist', 'halfway', 'courage', 'convictions', 'opts', 'Hollywood', 'artificiality', 'instead.Don', 'Cheadle', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'devout', 'Muslim', 'who', 'terrorist', 'organizations', 'materials', 'need', 'carry', 'out', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Roy', 'Clayton', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'hot', 'Samir', 'trail', 'most', 'movie.Although', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'international', 'cat-and-mouse', 'chase', 'stories', 'go', 'movie', 'Yeman', 'Paris', 'London', 'Toronto', 'Chicago', 'number', 'places', 'crucial', 'plot', 'twist', 'middle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'seriously', 'aura', 'credibility', 'movie', 'managed', 'establish', 'up', 'point', 'script', 'further', 'compromised', 'series', 'increasingly', 'improbable', 'plot', 'points', 'eventually', 'take', 'movie', 'realm', 'reality', 'deposit', 'right', 'heart', 'movie-land', 'fantasy', 'climax', 'ranking', 'one', 'most', 'purely', 'preposterous', 'almost', 'laughable', 'resolutions', 've', 'come', 'quite', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'influence', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'who', 'writer/director', 'Jeffrey', 'Nachmanoff', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'story', '.Cheadle', 'Pearce', 'are', 'stolid', 'effective', 'roles', 'Said', 'Taghmaoui', 'well', 'Samir', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'friend', 'movie', 'hard', 'being', 'fair', 'sides', 'conflict', 'thus', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'being', 'reminded', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'good', 'Muslims', 'world', 'are', 'bad', 'ones', 'just', 'are', 'more', 'good', 'Christians', 'bad', 'Christians', 'good', 'Americans', 'bad', 'Americans', 'movie', 'try', 'explore', 'mental', 'moral', 'anguish', 'taking', 'place', 'deep', 'Samir', 'tortured', 'soul', 'midpoint', 'compromise', 'Traitor', 'becoming', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'one', 'more', 'serious', 'issues', 'time']",Traitor

The screen play is good although it has some logical holes which would probably keep it from academy nomination.  The casting is superb with the only major name being Jeff Daniels who in reality has only a cameo role.  The plot revolves around a deep cover agent who is in reality a devout Muslim but who struggles to maintain his perspective as he burrows deeper into the world of terrorism.  The movie makes a strong effort to portray Muslims as complicated people with some being good and others not so good.  Midway through the movie the mother of Samir (Don Cheadle) says in response to the question regarding how devout Samir is ""You are either a muslim or you are not"".  This is a telling point because anyone who has actually read the Koran knows that it is filled with hate and exhortations to kill infidels.  This point is really not made very clear but you do see how the Koran is used to manipulate the young and impressionable and how westerners are viewed as ""Crusaders"".  These are very real and telling points but ones that were not explored.  Overall the movie demonstrates how some Muslims who are seeking power use the Koran and the deeply religious (as played by Sad Taghmaoui)Muslims to further their own ends.  In effect the movie shows the typical terrorist as being manipulated by these power seekers who really are apostate. This is shown as they are shaved, drink alcohol, eat pork, live the high life while justifying their lack of observance as ""fitting in"".  But this is really just the framework of the movie and while well done, ultimately the movie raises some very significant moral questions regarding the price to be paid for righteousness.  How many innocent people can be sacrificed in the name of good before it is too many?  What about the moral and psychological impact on the participants?  The movie is very clear on who are the good guys and who are the bad guys and you are left with insight into how the slaughter is justified but insight without judgement and the audience is left to make that decision.This is really an excellent movie, with a superb cast, good screen play, and no car chases (remarkable) no nudity, no real profanity, and even the violence is minimal and fits the circumstance.  The good guys are clearly good but flawed and the bad guys are clearly bad but not without humanity.

It is easy to assume that with that name in big bold lettering above a picture of Don Cheadle (Traffic) that he would be playing a traitor.  Yet for the first third of the two hour film it is ambiguous who the title refers to and you just wait for Cheadle to show his hand even though early in the film he is imprisoned for terrorist act.His arrest raises the eyebrow of the FBI, Guy Pierce (Memento) in particular.  Playing the bad cop to Pierce's good is Neil McDonough who is always a solid go to humongous tool even if he is on the right side of the law in this movie, but he does get the best lines.  Also entangled in the storyline, and the keeper of who is the traitor, is Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber).There is a big plot twist in the second third of the movie, but it has been done numerous times before so it shouldn't be that shocking as once the scene begins, it isn't hard to see what's coming.  But Cheadle pulls another twist later that more than makes up for it.  With that said, and the spoilerish title aside, Traitor is a solid film that you can tell was well research and as you can tell by the cast, it is well acted with all the actors bringing their A-game.

762315,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0000ACOXL,Stephanie De Pue,"[6, 11]","""Traitor,"" is a crime/drama/thriller starring the talented, Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle, in the title role as ""the traitor,"" former United States Special Operations Officer Samir Horn, of Chicago.  The production moves around a lot, to Washington D.C., Chicago, of course, France, but most of the action is concentrated in the Middle East.The picture is based on a story by comic actor Steve Martin; the script was written by, and directed by, Jeffrey Nachmanoff.  I don't think I can be accused of giving the plot away if I say it concerns the undercover doings of Cheadle's character, Horn.  Guy Pearce plays Roy Clayton, and Jeff Daniels, Carter, intelligence figures with whom Horn apparently interacts.  Cheadle does strong work, and seems to be particularly good at suffering in silence.But, you know,Spy Who Came in from the Cold - Criterion Collection, an epochal film  based upon British spymaster John LeCarre's novel of the same name, starring the great Welsh actor Richard Burton as cold war spy Alec Leamas, and directed by Martin Ritt, came out in 1965.  LeCarre, had, of course, actually been a British spy, in the field, and was familiar with the secrets and craft of the trade. The film, as the novel upon which it was based, explained all about how Leamas had to go to jail in order to go back into the active spy business undercover.  Now we have ""Traitor.""  Steve Martin knows no equal as a comic actor, but I doubt he knows much first-hand about the spy business.  I know nothing whatever about Nachmanoff, but somehow I doubt he is grounded in the spy business. And sorry folks, but ""Traitor"" plays like a blurred 15th generation copy of ""The Spy."" Is it too much to ask that, somewhere in the making of a spy picture, there should be someone who actually knows something about the subject matter?",2,A Strong Performance by Cheadle Doesn't Save It,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",2008,1819,"['Traitor', 'crime/drama/thriller', 'starring', 'talented', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'title', 'role', 'traitor', 'former', 'United', 'States', 'Special', 'Operations', 'Officer', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'Chicago', 'production', 'around', 'lot', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Chicago', 'course', 'France', 'most', 'action', 'concentrated', 'Middle', 'East.The', 'picture', 'based', 'story', 'comic', 'actor', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'script', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Jeffrey', 'Nachmanoff', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'accused', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'say', 'undercover', 'doings', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'Horn', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Roy', 'Clayton', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Carter', 'intelligence', 'figures', 'whom', 'Horn', 'apparently', 'Cheadle', 'strong', 'work', 'be', 'particularly', 'good', 'suffering', 'silence.But', 'know', 'Spy', 'Who', 'Came', 'Cold', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'epochal', 'film', 'based', 'British', 'spymaster', 'John', 'LeCarre', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'starring', 'great', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'cold', 'war', 'spy', 'Alec', 'Leamas', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'came', 'out', '1965', 'LeCarre', 'had', 'course', 'actually', 'been', 'British', 'spy', 'field', 'was', 'familiar', 'secrets', 'craft', 'trade', 'film', 'novel', 'was', 'based', 'explained', 'how', 'Leamas', 'had', 'go', 'jail', 'order', 'go', 'back', 'active', 'spy', 'business', 'undercover', 'Now', 'have', 'Traitor', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'equal', 'comic', 'actor', 'doubt', 'much', 'first-hand', 'spy', 'business', 'know', 'nothing', 'Nachmanoff', 'somehow', 'doubt', 'grounded', 'spy', 'business', 'sorry', 'folks', 'Traitor', 'blurred', '15th', 'generation', 'copy', 'Spy', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'somewhere', 'making', 'spy', 'picture', 'should', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'something', 'subject', 'matter']",Traitor

It was hard enough separating the standard DVD reviews from the Blu Rays and the summary type reviews from the reviews that focused on the actual quality of the disc but here goes.I only focus my reviews on the quality of the transfer to Blu ray.  Enough summaries and opinions about the movie have already been supplied elsewhere.VIDEO.... While I do not have the standard definition DVD to compare it to, this Blu Ray is of pretty decent quality.  There were no problems with the disc and no artifacting or aliasing to be found anywhere.  Color grading did vary and, as is typical with scenes supposedly shot in the Middle East, the color grading is extremely warm and golden in appearance.  I have been throughout Egypt and, trust me, there is real color there. It is not all golden toned resulting from the blazing sun.  All other scenes were, for the most part, somewhat desaturated and grayed.  Colors were true in terms of skin tones and clothing but a little bleach bypass done in post production is prominent, tho not disturbing in any way.  Contrast was good and details in shadowy areas were also easily noted.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the mid 20's.  All in all, a good transfer of the video to Blu Ray.AUDIO...The audio is a lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 and for those who might not know, a lossless audio is always less compressed than a lossy audio and thus dialogue, soundtrack and foley fx are far more transparent in a home theater system.  All audio levels were nicely set and did not fight each other so there was no need to play roller coaster with my remote's  volume control.  I was surprised that there was more use of the rear channels than I expected and some great panning from the rear towards the front surrounds.  As is the case for most films, if not all, the center channel carries the biggest burden.  The LFE channel is used strongly from time to time, usually for explosions but it also comes in, along with the rears for ambient sounds.  The audio clearly surpassed my expectations for this film.Extras....No deleted scenes but there is the typical commentary which I haven't listened to, as well as a making of doc and stunt featurette.  A Trailer is also included.All in all, glad I picked it up on a lark but don't  expect to rewatch it a whole bunch of times.  If you did like this film, than the upgrade to Blu Ray will provide rewards for both the video resolution as well as audio clarity.All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.  If so, check out my reviews of other films.Thanks for reading.",4,Traitor on Blu Ray,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,2920,"['certainly', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'find', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'quality', 'blu', 'one', 'sentence', 'streaming', 'download', 'reviews', 'included', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'separating', 'standard', 'DVD', 'reviews', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'summary', 'type', 'reviews', 'reviews', 'focused', 'actual', 'quality', 'disc', 'here', 'only', 'focus', 'reviews', 'quality', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'ray', 'Enough', 'summaries', 'opinions', 'movie', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'supplied', 'elsewhere.VIDEO', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVD', 'compare', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'pretty', 'decent', 'quality', 'were', 'problems', 'disc', 'artifacting', 'aliasing', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'Color', 'grading', 'did', 'vary', 'typical', 'scenes', 'supposedly', 'shot', 'Middle', 'East', 'color', 'grading', 'extremely', 'warm', 'golden', 'appearance', 'have', 'been', 'Egypt', 'trust', 'real', 'color', 'there', 'not', 'golden', 'toned', 'resulting', 'blazing', 'sun', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'most', 'part', 'somewhat', 'desaturated', 'grayed', 'Colors', 'were', 'true', 'terms', 'skin', 'tones', 'clothing', 'little', 'bleach', 'bypass', 'done', 'post', 'production', 'prominent', 'tho', 'not', 'disturbing', 'way', 'Contrast', 'was', 'good', 'details', 'shadowy', 'areas', 'were', 'also', 'easily', 'noted', 'Mbps', 'rate', 'appeared', 'average', 'mid', '20', 'good', 'transfer', 'video', 'Blu', 'Ray.AUDIO', 'audio', 'lossless', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', '5.1', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'lossless', 'audio', 'always', 'less', 'compressed', 'lossy', 'audio', 'thus', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'foley', 'fx', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'transparent', 'home', 'theater', 'system', 'audio', 'levels', 'were', 'nicely', 'set', 'did', 'not', 'fight', 'other', 'so', 'was', 'need', 'play', 'roller', 'coaster', 'remote', 'volume', 'control', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'more', 'use', 'rear', 'channels', 'expected', 'great', 'panning', 'rear', 'front', 'case', 'most', 'films', 'not', 'center', 'channel', 'biggest', 'burden', 'LFE', 'channel', 'used', 'strongly', 'time', 'time', 'usually', 'explosions', 'also', 'rears', 'ambient', 'sounds', 'audio', 'clearly', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'film.Extras', '.No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'typical', 'commentary', 'have', ""n't"", 'listened', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'doc', 'stunt', 'featurette', 'Trailer', 'also', 'included.All', 'glad', 'picked', 'up', 'lark', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'rewatch', 'whole', 'bunch', 'times', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'upgrade', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'will', 'provide', 'rewards', 'video', 'resolution', 'as', 'well', 'audio', 'clarity.All', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'transfers', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'video', 'audio', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'type', 'review', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'reviews', 'other', 'films.Thanks', 'reading']",Traitor

There are a multitude of night shots and action scenes in dark places, with a spattering of desert, city and urban sequences. I watched this on several LCD and plasma displays and the film easily shows the shortcomings of the displays that are less than a 120 refresh rate.In watching the 2 short docus accompanying the BD (which are the same as the DVD features) there are different styles of cameras used which shows through on some of the night shots; Some grain and artifact appear infrequently but it does not detract in any significant way. The sound and music are mixed adequately to test the high ranges and mids. But for a BD presentation, it cannot compete with 5 star BDs, especially with the special features being overlooked almost entirely. There is some nice locale footage in the 2nd docu, but both total less than 10 minutes.This is one of those titles that stands alone on the film content/production.

762318,A359IT81FBX64Y,B0000ACOXL,Steven Mason,"[0, 0]","This is a typical American action flick in the sense that it features a really smart and tough hero character, in this case Don Cheadle, who is able to outsmart and outfight just about anybody, good guys and bad guys alike. Maybe one reason this film didn't do so well at the box office is because it doesn't have quite as much action as most action movies, for which I give it credit. Also unlike most action movies it doesn't have any super evil villains. There are terrorists, of course, but you see them as people and not just as cardboard bad guys. Then again, a movie portraying Muslims only as evil terrorists and Americans only as good guys would stir things up, wouldn't it?At the end of the movie there is some preachiness about Muslims being used, misguided, and misled, and there is no serious effort to explore the roots of terrorism. One could just as well examine the motivations of homegrown terrorists like Timothy McVeigh. The end of the movie also sets up the obvious sequel, but perhaps there will be no sequel after all.Even with its redeeming qualities, Traitor suffers the same flaw as other action films: implausibility. But that doesn't bother fans of action films. The only reason it bothers me is because I'm not a fan of action films.

Script by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and that wild and crazy guy Steve Martin.Starring Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce and Jeff Daniels.Shamir Horn is a Muslim FBI undercover agent who has gone deep to infiltrate a Islamic Terrorist group. He is so deep that only one agent in the Bureau is aware of his existence and he is hunted as a terrorist by another. To continue his subterfuge, Horn perpetrates a bombing with the aid of the US govt and facilitates the terrorist group's efforts to pull off a massive attack in the mainland United States.Will Horn be discovered by his fellow Muslims or captured by the FBI before he can stop the attack??Or at least the above is what the filmmakers want you to think the film is about. In actuality, this rather tired and de riquer terrorist retread of DONNIE BRASCO is an excuse..a trojan horse to lure the viewer in thinking he/she is going to see a movie about the War on Terror but really so he/she can be subjected to quite literally.......as in one can practically hear the pencil checking the boxes on the list.........every single liberal/CAIR propaganda point about said conflict. Ergo lies and nonsense. Everything from how Muslims are really all warm and cuddly to how the terrorists are incapable of mounting any effective assault on the US.......unless the US actually helps them first. The terrorist group is, of course, a fictional one allowing the film to portray these terrorists as being the type who feel REALLY bad ala PARADISE NOW blowing up innocent people and hate themselves in the morning but what can you do? The United States is really a racist Empire who like to drop bombs on brown people and the Terrorists are just like the Founding Fathers during the American Revolution. The FBI is shown being especially helpless is fighting the terrorists and it is something only another Muslim can do so we should just give up the fight and let the Barbarians clean their own house. They have done so well thus far after all. We are given, at least, two supposed quotes from the Koran about how Muslims should not kill anyone which not only do I---who suffered through the damn thing..have no recollection of reading---but seem to be at odds with the multiple admonitions in the Koran about how you must kill the Infidels and Jews. All the Muslims in the film are shown being oh so respectful of women.........especially the terrorists. The terrorists are falsely compared to the Ku Klux Klan---which is falsely called a Christian terrorist group. And so on and so on. The only thing the film misses is the Bush is Hitler trope. Perhaps in the extended version??What the film never touches upon even obiguely is just why is the US is at War with these Muslim terrorists and their state sponsors and why do these barbarians keep going around killing people? There is no mention of Wahabism. No mention of the rampant anti-semitism. There is no mention of the world wide caliphate or Sharia law. There is nothing at all.A film concerning this subject would artistically, aesthetically, morally be obligated to address this matter to explain WHY WE FIGHT but again and again this is simply something that Hollywood is either unable or, more likely, unwilling to deal with.Meanwhile the killing goes on.Traitor indeed.As such, this is not a film about the terrorist enemy but about the Liberal desire to return to the Clinton era policy of ignoring them and maybe they will go away. Muslims are our friends. The terrorists are vaguely heroic and we need to understand why they hate us. Give peace a chance.The film is a fraud and a fake.......much to its detriment. No liberal would be caught dead seeing a movie about Islamic terrorists no matter how sympathetic and justified since that would acknowledge they actually exist and, in any case, they can probably recite the film's PARTY LINE by heart. No normal person would see it once it got out what the film is up to.

762326,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B0000ACOXL,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 1]","""Traitor"" was a movie I missed at the theaters. It seemed to fly in and out pretty quickly, even with its superb cast and the first to really make use of Don Cheadle as a serious box-office lead after his extraordinary performance inHotel Rwanda. ""Traitor's"" box-office was insignificant, petering out at 23 million. (In contrast, as I write this, ""Marley and Me"" took in 24 million on its third weekend of general release.)Yet the film is a solid modern thriller, in the same vein asSpy Who Came in from the Cold. Both Cheadle and Guy Pearce give great performances, with Jeff Daniels offering a solid support role. The shoot takes place on three continents, there's great cinematography and an international cast of supporting actors. The general plot is that Samhir (Cheadle) is an ex-US Army explosives expert and Muslim that is selling bombs and his bomb-making skills to an Al-Qaeda like terrorist organization, with Pearce trying to track him. The terrorists want Cheadle to help them mastermind a multi-level attack on US soil. How far will the plot advance?One of the things I enjoyed about ""Traitor"" was that it avoided many of the typical spy-flick cliches. There were so many easy tricks that could have played out in ""Traitor"" that didn't (Samhir never drops his Muslim faith, for example), that many of the plot turns took me by surprise. There are no McGuyver style contrivances, no ""24"" gungho patriotism idiocy to manipulate you. The terrorists are played as average folks, which is what real-life often becomes; the banality of evil.Yet the good guys still win, the bad guys get their comeuppance and the world is safe for another day. Be that as it may (and I did find the final climax a bit dodgy), the 'hero' exits the film still wrapped in a cloud of doubts. Maybe that was part of what killed ""Traitor"" at the cash registers. A Muslim hero who builds bombs that kill and yet could protect the nation? Tough nut to swallow. No car chases, lots of explosions. The chase scenes aren't people leaping from building to building. Lots of computer work and tracking. In other words, probably what real anti-terrorist workers are doing...with a better than average fictional movie payoff. To that end, ""Traitor"" is a thriller that will leave you more thoughtful than adrenalised, and that's my kind of movie.",4,A Complex and smart modern thriller,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,2323,"['Traitor', 'was', 'movie', 'missed', 'theaters', 'seemed', 'fly', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'even', 'superb', 'cast', 'first', 'really', 'make', 'use', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'serious', 'box-office', 'lead', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'inHotel', 'Rwanda', 'Traitor', 'box-office', 'was', 'insignificant', 'petering', 'out', '23', 'million', 'contrast', 'write', 'Marley', 'Me', 'took', '24', 'million', 'third', 'weekend', 'general', 'release', 'film', 'solid', 'modern', 'thriller', 'same', 'vein', 'asSpy', 'Who', 'Came', 'Cold', 'Cheadle', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'give', 'great', 'performances', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'offering', 'solid', 'support', 'role', 'shoot', 'place', 'three', 'continents', 'great', 'cinematography', 'international', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'general', 'plot', 'Samhir', 'Cheadle', 'ex-US', 'Army', 'expert', 'Muslim', 'selling', 'bombs', 'bomb-making', 'skills', 'Al-Qaeda', 'terrorist', 'organization', 'Pearce', 'trying', 'track', 'terrorists', 'want', 'Cheadle', 'help', 'mastermind', 'multi-level', 'attack', 'US', 'soil', 'How', 'far', 'will', 'plot', 'advance', 'One', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'Traitor', 'was', 'avoided', 'many', 'typical', 'spy-flick', 'cliches', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'easy', 'tricks', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'Traitor', 'did', ""n't"", 'Samhir', 'never', 'Muslim', 'faith', 'example', 'many', 'plot', 'took', 'surprise', 'are', 'McGuyver', 'style', 'contrivances', '24', 'gungho', 'patriotism', 'idiocy', 'manipulate', 'terrorists', 'are', 'played', 'average', 'folks', 'what', 'real-life', 'often', 'banality', 'good', 'guys', 'still', 'win', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'world', 'safe', 'day', 'Be', 'may', 'did', 'find', 'final', 'climax', 'bit', 'dodgy', ""'hero"", 'film', 'still', 'wrapped', 'cloud', 'doubts', 'Maybe', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'killed', 'Traitor', 'cash', 'registers', 'Muslim', 'hero', 'who', 'bombs', 'kill', 'yet', 'could', 'protect', 'nation', 'Tough', 'nut', 'swallow', 'car', 'chases', 'lots', 'explosions', 'chase', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'people', 'leaping', 'building', 'building', 'Lots', 'computer', 'work', 'tracking', 'other', 'words', 'probably', 'what', 'real', 'anti-terrorist', 'workers', 'are', 'doing', 'better', 'average', 'fictional', 'movie', 'payoff', 'end', 'Traitor', 'thriller', 'will', 'leave', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'adrenalised', 'kind', 'movie']",Traitor

Just kidding about True Lies and Gene Simmons. One wonders when rich freelance bad guys who want to rob Fort Knox will get their due.The main problem with this movie is that you're supposed to believe that Don Cheadle is a rogue agent turned terrorist instead of a double agent that's infiltrating the terrorist organization. That bit of fluff doesn't hold up for a second (even if the entire marketing campaign wasn't set to SPOILER ALERT) and Cheadle is doing his blandly virtuous role throughout. I miss the Cheadle that played Mouse inDevil in a Blue Dress. Without much tension on the Cheadle side, Guy Pearce has to do the heavy lifting but he's saddled with a Southern accent that goes between genuine and grating as all hell and a back story about being a Preacher's Son who studied Arabic in college.And every 5 minutes someone stops to say that Islam is peaceful. Really. Whether you got Cheadle preaching at his terrorist friends or Guy Pearce talking about the problems with profiling Arabs, there's the speechifying. Good intentions make for deadly dull viewing and this is a movie brimming with good intentions.

People just didn't want to watch movies about Iraq, Afghanistan, terrorism, rendition, torture - any of it.  Some of those movies were actually pretty good, some were acceptable/OK, and some were just bad movies.  ""Traitor"" is in the middle.  Not a great flick, but definitely worth at least a rental.The director had to thread the eye of the needle with a story like this.  How to depict Muslims and Arabs in all their humanity, from good to bad?  This was a tight rope act and it appears, at least to this reviewer, that the director succeeded even if the final product wasn't a stupendous movie.  It shows that some people are bad and some are good and they exist on all sides.Don Cheadle does a superb job as the guy torn apart in the middle, the witness to atrocities and hypocritical extreme ideology on both sides.  There is tension throughout the film as viewers have to guess which way he's going to ultimately go and if the side he decides to join will accept him or kill him.Still, the film falls flat in part to its lack of budget.  The final explosion is perhaps the biggest example.  Not that big explosions make a great movie!  Far from it.  It's just that the specifics of the story indicated that this explosion would consist of multiple sources (possible spoiler - I'm trying to be vague) and the one they show is just too tiny for that.  That kind of approach is seen in much smaller touches throughout the film. You can tell that they've passed off certain streets as foreign locales when it was probably just Vancouver, Canada.  That a big chunk of the film ends up in Nova Scotia (about as non-descript as you can get) says something.Still, it's worth a rental and could possibly lead to some interesting conversations afterwards.

Roy is a tough, straight-shooting FBI agent hunting down the culprits involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Europe.Samir and Roy had once met in Yemen. When arrested, a devout Muslim Samir is offered a deal from Roy, but he refuses. Later Samir escapes from a Yemeni Prison with another inmate Omar (Sad Taghmaoui). By the end of the 114 minute film, Roy and his no-nonsense partner Max (Neal McDonough) will know what Samir is heading for.""Traitor"" keeps the viewer guessing right up to a certain moment, when the fifth major character steps in. From then on, things start to look a bit familiar, if not predictable, and its resolution is too unbelievable. Some may be reminded of ""Body of Lies,"" released only two months after ""Traitor."" Like Ridley Scott thriller ""Traitor"" describes high-tech aspects of modern-day warfare, explores inner conflict of characters, and wraps up the complex storyline with a too-neat conclusion. ""Traitor"" is an effective thriller, but a second viewing will make you notice some major plot holes in it.",3,(3.5 STARS) Political Thriller That Keeps You on the Edge ...

762334,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0000ACOXL,Turfseer,"[5, 8]","**This review contains spoilers**Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) is an African-American Muslim who was born in Sudan and witnessed the death of his father in a car bombing when he was nine. He's raised by his mother in Chicago and spends some time in the Army in Special Ops. Eventually he sees action in both Afghanistan (with the Mujahideen) and fellow Muslims in Bosnia. Samir shows up in Yemen posing as an arms dealer and trying to infiltrate a terrorist network for a rogue CIA operative. Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance, Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI.After Samir and Omar escape from the prison aided by terrorist sympathizers, they escape to France where Omar introduces Samir to Fareed Mansour, Omar's boss in the terrorist network. Fareed is no Mohammed Atta (fanatic ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists) but rather an urbane yuppie-type who thinks nothing of drinking alcohol in front of Omar and Samir (supposed devout Muslims). Fareed justifies drinking of alcohol (a sin in the Muslim religion) by stating that it's necessary to blend in to achieve victory as the ends always justify the means. Somehow Aly Khan, an actor of Indian Muslim ancestry, seemed more like a stock Hollywood villain than a representation of an actual terrorist.Even less convincing is Samir's ideological disagreement with Fareed while they're having dinner at an outdoor caf&eacute;. Samir makes it quite clear that he feels that Fareed has misinterpreted the Koran to justify violence. It's obvious that the film's screenwriters are trying to make the point that Samir represents the MAJORITY of Muslims--that is, they are peaceful people who reject the methods of terrorists. Nonetheless, would Samir have risked blowing his cover by getting into an argument with the very man who he must prove his allegiance to? Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets by--but the screenwriters cannot help but continually remind us (in the character of Samir) that the majority of Muslims reject violence (whether you agree or not with that idea, it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to 'soften the blow' or 'balance things out' since the films' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists!).Samir is depicted as a man who totally abhors the killing of innocents. However (and here is the big problem with the movie), he is willing to hook up with a lone rogue CIA operative (an intelligence contractor as he is referred to in the movie), a person who he knows virtually nothing about, and plants a bomb in the US consulate in Nice at the behest of this shadowy figure, which accidentally kills eight innocent people. It just seems that there are too many action-thrillers today that trot out the tired storyline of inter-agency government squabbling, especially between the FBI and the CIA.How does this CIA guy pull off the bombing of the US consulate in France no less? To my recollection, most US embassies and consulates are pretty well-guarded. And why Samir would even take a chance in conducting an operation such as this when he knows that something could go wrong is beyond me.While the rogue CIA operative must end up getting bumped off precisely because he is amoral and unprincipled, the FBI fares better here. The two agents, Clayton and Archer, are your typical good cop-bad cop characters. Archer is the bad cop and punches Samir a few times in an early interrogation scene in Yemen. But Clayton (Guy Pearce) is the 'sensitive' good cop--he majored in Arabic studies as an undergraduate and ends up receiving important information from Samir via email at a critical point in the film's story.I'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it off--and this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorism--he manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time. Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present (Note that the main boss, Nathir, again is no scary Mohammed Atta-type--but rather an ordinary businessman).Traitor does a disservice in the fight against international terrorism. It makes it look all too easy with the good guys easily outwitting the bad guys. But in reality, terrorists such as the 9/11 conspirators were no pushovers; to remind everybody: they beat us--we didn't beat them! Some say that Cheadle's performance here was excellent. I would have to disagree. He comes off as too middle-class, too intellectual to be a former Special Ops guy who is able infiltrate a gang of terrorists. All the preaching throughout the movie reminds me more of a college professor trying to convince a bunch of undergraduates that his cause is just.In the end, 'Traitor' tries hard to be as politically correct as possible, arguing that the war against terror is not antithetical to the teachings of the Muslim religion. But it makes its argument in such a heavy-handed and obvious manner that the film becomes overly didactic. Coupled with a wholly implausible plot, 'Traitor' fails to convince us that we're watching a story that mirrors something that could have come close to happening in reality.",2,War on terror made

762336,A3G7BEJJCPD6DS,B0000ACOXL,VeraP,"[1, 1]","Premise: Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Neal McDonough (did not catch the character's name) are FBI agents who are investigating several suicide bombings around the world. Their main suspect, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle)- an American citizen, seems to be clearly connected to the extremist group claiming responsibility for the bombings. As Samir masterfully evades the agents, Clayton comes to realize that everything is not as it seems and evidence is not as clear-cut as he first believed it to be. (I don't think I can say much more without giving away the whole movie)My main gripe with the 'Traitor' was the muddled beginning, - it was not very clear what was going on, who was doing what. Once I got past the first 10-15 minutes (and they dragged on), I found the movie to be quite interesting. Suicide bombings and extremist Islamic groups have become popular topics in recent years, but 'Traitor' does a great job at delving further into the operations of a terrorist group, and the thought process of a suicide bomber. I am not an expert and cannot judge the accuracy of the movie, but I feel that the 'Traitor' gave be a better understanding of how such groups may work. Furthermore, I think the director and writer of 'Traitor' took the dangerous step of creating characters who are terrorists, but whom many people will sympathize with. Normally, terrorists are bad guys with no ifs and buts about it; in 'Traitor', some terrorists are deeply religious individuals whose faith is used against them.I found 'Traitor' to be a very enjoyable and insightful movie, but I agree with other reviews in that the PG-13 rating is not appropriate.",4,"Solid Thriller, Confusing at Times",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,1643,"['Premise', 'Roy', 'Clayton', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'character', 'name', 'are', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'are', 'investigating', 'several', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'world', 'main', 'suspect', 'Samir', 'Horn', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'American', 'citizen', 'be', 'clearly', 'connected', 'extremist', 'group', 'claiming', 'responsibility', 'bombings', 'Samir', 'masterfully', 'agents', 'Clayton', 'realize', 'everything', 'not', 'evidence', 'not', 'as', 'clear-cut', 'first', 'believed', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'whole', 'movie', 'main', 'gripe', ""'Traitor"", 'was', 'muddled', 'beginning', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'who', 'was', 'doing', 'what', 'Once', 'got', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'dragged', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Suicide', 'bombings', 'extremist', 'Islamic', 'groups', 'have', 'become', 'popular', 'topics', 'recent', 'years', ""'Traitor"", 'great', 'job', 'delving', 'further', 'operations', 'terrorist', 'group', 'thought', 'process', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'accuracy', 'movie', 'feel', ""'Traitor"", 'gave', 'be', 'better', 'understanding', 'how', 'such', 'groups', 'may', 'work', 'Furthermore', 'think', 'director', 'writer', ""'Traitor"", 'took', 'dangerous', 'step', 'creating', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'terrorists', 'whom', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'sympathize', 'Normally', 'terrorists', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'ifs', 'buts', ""'Traitor"", 'terrorists', 'are', 'deeply', 'religious', 'individuals', 'faith', 'used', 'them.I', 'found', ""'Traitor"", 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'insightful', 'movie', 'agree', 'other', 'reviews', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'not', 'appropriate']",Traitor

762338,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0000ACOXL,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 6]","There have been quite a good number of espionage thrillers and undercover police films. ""TRAITOR"" is equal parts detective story and equal parts terrorist thriller. The direction and screenplay by Jeffrey Nachmanoff is taut, gripping and well blends together elements from the Hong Kong hit ""Infernal Affairs"", the ""24"" TV series and the Bourne franchise, but it is also filed with social and theological undertones and messages.After an arms deal in Yemen had gone awry, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda) is arrested and imprisoned with the same men that he has been accused of sabotaging the deal, by contacting the authorities. Samir is under fire from both sides, as the F.B.I. is putting pressure on him to reveal his contacts. When Omar (Said Taghmaoui) orchestrates a jailbreak, has little choice but to join the terrorist leader in his quest to wreak havoc in the United States. But who is Samir really working for?The big draw of ""Traitor"" is its foreshadowing of Samir's intentions and motivations. The dialogue is kept at a pace to reveal only the minor details as the screenplay goes along, it makes the viewer work to figure out what Samir is really all about, and the script efficiently plays its cards right. Director Nachmanoff deals with certain factors to keep the tense atmosphere, and slowly leaks out more and more information about Samir's beliefs and character It was quite clever to show both the F.B.I. and the terrorist group going through his background. Samir is an ex- U.S. soldier and a very devout Muslim and much of the film focuses on him. There are some integral plot points as Agent Clayton and Agent Archer (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough respectively) to illustrate some of Samir's political beliefs and the intricate ""motivational"" speeches as Omar recruits new ""martyrs"" to their cause. There are also some disagreements between Fahid and Samir that give the audience some idea as to how different followers of Islam interpret the Qur'an. All these doses of dialogue are integral to the script as it manages to keep the viewer interested and intrigued.The film also has a lot of emotion and the building tension almost never stops. It is the manner of which the film builds suspense through dialogue and significant scenes that helps the film's pacing and story telling. I liked the fact that there doesn't seem to be any political motives in the film although it does promote some parallels and contradictions in government practices to the terrorist organization. Political ideas and theological teachings are shown being misinterpreted to further extremist goals. But Nachmanoff instead focuses on the evils that men do, that all men's deeds will have to answerable to God. I suppose this is a subtle way to say that extremists are using theological beliefs to intentionally misdirect or ""brainwash"" their followers. The film isn't very ""family-friendly"" and definitely not for mainstream audiences with its dark tones of government, radicalism and Islam.Now, the film's biggest credit would have to be Don Cheadle's terrific performance. Samir is a man of Allah and Cheadle bears his soul in his portrayal. Samir is also a skilled soldier, arsonist, bomber but above all, he is a man of God. Cheadle fills his character with an unorthodox sort of appeal, which makes his character all the more compelling and interesting. Guy Pearce (Memento) also does a good supporting performance as Agent Roy Clayton, in a way, he is a man of God but from a different belief--a son of a Baptist preacher. It was quite smart to have such a character dissect another's action. The film has a good pace and the cat and mouse game between Samir and Clayton make for very good entertainment.The film does pay off in the end but I am sure there will be some viewers who may say that the film doesn't offer anything original and I do partly agree. However, the film proved very interesting to me and this time around, the ""journey"" itself is rewarding. The film's great cinematography (by J. Michael Muro) is full of tense atmosphere that accentuates its mood. Those who are looking for an action-packed film may be a little disappointed as this one doesn't rely heavily on explosions and action scenes; rather it depends on its screenplay to slowly unravel to its revelatory final act. The film does rely on the frightening idea of another terrorist attack on American soil that may turn off some viewers.However, the film is highly-engrossing, a great film with a sensitive subject matter but doesn't dwell on political preaching but instead tries to go into the mindset of a man while using espionage-thriller elements. It is a nicely-shot, tense thriller with some food for thought and the strong performance of Don Cheadle just seals the deal .Recommended! [4- Stars]Video/audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen that diverts from its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35. But it is a nice transfer, natural colors and the overall transfer appears pretty nifty. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is clear and powerful, but sadly there is no DTS track on the Dvd.Bonus Features: Commentary by the director and Cheadle and a 10 minute behind the scenes look.
