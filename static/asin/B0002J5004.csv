And like all movies that fit into this class, director has put an extra effort to make the judgment (in real case) look like as if it is truth.Shouldn't we say 'Based on true trial case' rather than 'Based on true story' because nobody knows the truth except Ellaina and Doctor Stillman themselves. Judgment of court is based on facts and everybody who has seen a real-life trial knows how lawyers and liars bend them easily.Ellain(Jenna Elfman) is a successful medical writer who is obsessed with a neurosurgeon Dr Stillman. Although this is exposed very slowly till the end. Ellain is shown to be schizophrenic just because it aids true trial case outcome. Movie could have been excellent, if facts from both sides were given similar treatment by director and he had left decision in hands of viewers.One of the dialogues in the movie(may not be accurate) but it is one of my favorite: Dr Stillman: ""You are amazing."" Ellaina: ""I like it when you say that word. Say it again."" All I'll say about the ending is the jury did the right thing.

Yes, there is a surprise twist at the end but the rest of the movie simply dragged on far too long. None of the actors were compelling enough to make this seem like more than a he said/she said tale. Sure, there were some sexy scenes but I didn't find the chemistry between Ellena Roberts (played by Jenna Elfman) and David Stillman (Sam Roberts) to be authentic. I did find the surprise twist at the end to be a nice touch but otherwise this isn't really worth the time. I find plenty of Lifetime Original Movies to be very well done. Unfortunately, this wasn't one of them.The basic plot? A doctor finds himself the subject of obsession (or is he?) by Ellena. After that, the movie disintegrates into the he said/she said viewpoints noted above as well as the build-up to the courtroom scenes. I found myself getting impatient with the seemingly clueless Elenna and eager for the movie to end.

837016,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B0002J5004,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","FATAL ATTRACTION meets A BEAUTIFUL MIND in this fact-based Lifetime original thriller. Jenna Elfman (Dharma and Greg) plays sexually confident medical writer Ellena Roberts.Shortly after we meet her, she is arrested. While in jail, she meets with sympathetic defense attorney Sara Miller (Kate Burton) and recounts her side of the story. It seems she had a relationship with married surgeon David Stillman (Sam Robards), but he broke it off.She didn't want things to end and continued to write, to call, etc. She didn't make any threats, but nor would she give it a rest, so he called the cops. The case goes to court and David claims he knew Ellena professionally, but that they never had a relationship. By the end, we have a pretty good idea as to what really happened. That's because one person is sane--and therefore credible--while the other is not.In a Chicago jail cell, clever and charming Ellena Roberts recounts for attorney Sara Miller the details of a one-night stand that led to a heated love affair with prominent surgeon David Stillman. David's version of the facts differs entirely and he insists that he never slept with Ellena. Sure that the doctor is the one who's lying, Sara is preparing to defend her client in court when some disturbing facts emerge.",4,Dangerous Love,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",2014,1274,"['FATAL', 'ATTRACTION', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'MIND', 'fact-based', 'Lifetime', 'original', 'thriller', 'Jenna', 'Elfman', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'sexually', 'confident', 'medical', 'writer', 'Ellena', 'Roberts.Shortly', 'meet', 'arrested', 'jail', 'sympathetic', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Sara', 'Miller', 'Kate', 'Burton', 'side', 'story', 'had', 'relationship', 'married', 'surgeon', 'David', 'Stillman', 'Sam', 'Robards', 'broke', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'things', 'end', 'continued', 'write', 'call', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'threats', 'would', 'give', 'rest', 'called', 'cops', 'case', 'court', 'David', 'knew', 'Ellena', 'professionally', 'never', 'had', 'relationship', 'end', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'one', 'person', 'sane', 'therefore', 'credible', 'other', 'Chicago', 'jail', 'cell', 'clever', 'charming', 'Ellena', 'Roberts', 'recounts', 'attorney', 'Sara', 'Miller', 'details', 'one-night', 'stand', 'led', 'heated', 'love', 'affair', 'prominent', 'surgeon', 'David', 'Stillman', 'David', 'version', 'facts', 'differs', 'entirely', 'never', 'slept', 'Ellena', 'Sure', 'doctor', 'one', 'who', 'lying', 'Sara', 'preparing', 'defend', 'client', 'court', 'when', 'disturbing', 'facts', 'emerge']",N/A
