Those guys couldn't be more secure in their relationship and it shows exceptionally well.  Eric is absolutely adorable in this as well, and there were some moments I actually teared-up.

I distinctly remember watching these episodes on ABC&#8217;s TGIF Friday night lineup. Season four veered into far more serious issues then the three previous years like abuse, death, cults, and searching for one&#8217;s identity and place in the world. What made Boy Meets World unique among similar shows of the time was that these explorations were not just contained to the teenaged members of the cast. One could watch this show with the entire family, which is something that can&#8217;t be said much anymore.The one downside of these later DVD sets is that there are no extras or special features. Would&#8217;ve definitely loved to have had some episode commentaries on these later years. But after the hideously long delay we had on seasons four-seven, we should just count ourselves thankful that Lionsgate took a leap and understood that there was a market for this show. For so many people, watching Boy Meets World brings back amazing childhood memories.

Thanks so much Lions Gate for buying the rights! (Now just be sure to please finish releasing seasons 5-7!)This set won't have any special features but it will have all twenty two episodes of this fan loved season that originally aired 1996-97. Season four is one of the best seasons of the show with many classic episodes, maybe all classic episodes in fact, though I've marked my personal favorites with a *.You Can Go Home Again- Cory and Eric make the last stop on their summer long road trip but Eric isn't ready to head home. Alan wins an award but is still unhappy at his grocery store job.*Hair Today, Goon Tomorrow- Topanga cuts her hair to prove looks don't matter. Horrified by what she's done she goes to a salon and her new good looks soon turn her into a different person and make Cory more self concious.I Aint Gonna Spray Lettuce No More- Alan quits his grocer job without telling Amy causing her to make a huge family decision without telling him. Shawn teaches Cory how to be poor.Fishing For Virna- Shawn's mother is back in town affecting Shawn and Chet.

Cory's attempts at helping Topanga babysit find them arguing about future parenting techniques.Janitor Dad- Shawn wishes his Dad would get a real job but feels humiliated when his Dad takes a job as the school janitor. Alan and Eric look for help at the wilderness store and wind up hiring attractive Lonnie, a girl from the mountains.Singled Out- Eric goes on MTV's dating show Singled Out posing as a college student. Cory worries about getting his tonsils out and urban legends he's heard about hospitals.*Dangerous Secret- Cory gets the wrong idea when he learns Shawn had a girl spend the night. It causes him to question the slow pace of his relationship with Topanga but then finds he and Shawn dealing with more serious issues.*Sixteen Candles and 400-lb. Men- Cory agrees to help Frankie win the love of his father, but when plans conflict with Topanga's sweet sixteen party, Cory must be in two places at once.Turkey Day- Shawn and Cory plan the first ever Hunter-Matthews Thanksgiving celebration, but class differences make the families uncomfortable.*An Affair to Forget- Shawn's ex-girlfriend wants to give things another shot, but there's one condition: Shawn can't see Cory anymore. Meanwhile, Eric writes a one-man play about his life. (Hilarious)*Easy Street- Shawn and Cory get jobs at Christmas. When they learn the men they work for might be questionable Cory quits but Shawn might get sucked further in. Meanwhile Eric and a girl, Lonnie, get caught in a snowstorm.B&B;'s Bn'B- Eric meets up with Mr. Feeny out of town and they discuss friendships and relationships.

It's up to Mr. Feeny to remind them of the importance of educational value.Security Guy- Alan fires Eric who then gets a job as a security guy. Feeny tries to convince Eric to retake the SAT's, meanwhile Cory and Topanga try to convince Shawn to take Feeny's SAT prep course.Cult Fiction- Feeling an emptiness Shawn joins a cult, but when Mr. Turner winds up in an accident Shawn realizes its real relationships and people who love him that matter the most.*Learning to Fly- Eric visits a party school in his last attempts to avoid the possibility of failing at a proper college. Meanwhile when Topanga backs out the trip Cory has to deal with the advances of college girl Mary Beth.A great season, these episodes have what I feel is the perfect mix of heart and real issues combined with the fun and sometimes whacky elements that became a tad too prevelant in later seasons. Still this whole series is worth owning on DVD and while I wish they'd keep releasing these in the Beuna Vista style boxes with special features I'll take the episodes anyway I can get them after Beuna Vista abandoned us, the same way they abandoned me with Gargoyles halfway through that series. This 3-disc snapcase set will have matching artwork to the previous releases and lets just hope we get seasons 5-7 soon.5 stars for this set, based on episode content and the fact that fans can finally own these episodes on proper DVD at long last, it's been a loooong wait.Thanks,",5,"Five Stars For The Fourth Season, On DVD At Looong Last!",1286323200,"10 6, 2010",2010,5536,"['long',

945930,A21SVQPB3BMIZO,B000BNX4Y0,Shadow Walker,"[1, 1]","...I feel like I have to give this DVD set five stars because it's awesome that we got a fourth season on DVD at all. I'm bummed at the lack of cast commentaries in particular, but beggars can't be choosers. If you are a diehard fan of Boy Meets World, like me, then regardless of the lack of bonuses, this DVD set is a must-have.The fourth season isn't one of my favorites. I feel like this, along with season 3, was right when BMW was starting to go through some growing pains. A lot of the episodes seemed random and disconnected from the rest of the series. Still, even though season 4 as a whole was one of my least favorites, it still contained some of my favorite moments and episodes of the series:* An Affair to Forget: Shawn gets back together with his ex-girlfriend, but there's a snag in the plan when she refuses to let Shawn and Cory spend any time together. This ep was one of my favorites because it confirmed what we all knew - Shawn and Cory have more chemistry with each other than any other couple on the show! (Sorry, Topanga.) LOL. The hoyay/subtext in this episode was completely over-the-top in the best way possible.* Shallow Boy: Eric goes out with a musician (Corinna) who seems nice enough at first, but whose incessant cheeriness eventually starts to grate on his nerves. Finally, he breaks things off, and when he does, he sees a whole new (scarier) side of Corinna... Loved this one because Corinna was such a great character. And the way Eric reacts to her is gold: ""Now, I don't know how to say this, so I'm going to choose my words very carefully...I think you're a psycho. I want to get as far away from you as I possibly can.""* Hair Today, Goon Tomorrow: This episode is awesome just because it introduced us to the following-""When a crime breaks out,All the cute girls shout""Get the good-looking guy""!When there's a crime out there,He's gonna comb his hair,'Cuz he's the good-looking guy!Book 'em, good-looking!""'Nuff said.There are other great moments throughout this season, but those were my favorites.If you like the show, then you will like these DVDs.

945931,A2I0AQQ18EG6HA,B000BNX4Y0,"Somoskin ""Nick""","[2, 4]","Boy Meets World was the best rated show on ABC's TGIF lineups, beating out Family Matters, Step by Step, and other TGIF Shows. I watch it now on ABC FAmily, even though I can't now because of school and it's new timeslot at 2 and 2:30. But that is what the DVD's are for. The set will contain all 22 episodes from season 4, including the 2 part episode ""The Long Walk to Pittsburg"" The set will include all unedited, original network viewings of each episode, which is probably why these releases are a bit more expensive than some others.I just hope we will get a lot of Bonus features, including Commentary and possible things we haven't seen on the Boy Meets World sets (suchh as bloopers). WE just better not get another stupid Boy Meets World quiz like we did with season 3 box set. That's also probably why Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, and other stores aren't carying the first second, and third seasons anymore. Let's make a huge come back with season 4.Season 4 was definitely one of my favorte seasons, especially the episode (I think it might be the season finale) where they are on that quiz show. I thought it was very funny, along with ""Hair Today, Goon tomorrow"" another good episode. I will definitely buy this set just like I did the other seasons.

This season has a good balance of comedy and drama. This is an Eric-centric season, which is great since he's my favorite character on the show.I'll definitely get the rest of the seasons on DVD.
