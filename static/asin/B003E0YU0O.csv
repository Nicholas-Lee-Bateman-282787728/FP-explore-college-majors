A janitor at a high school, he hides a secret and because of that he has not visited the town that he grew up in for many years. A former flame ( Elizabeth Shue)pleads with him to come back home to spend time with her as she is terminally ill. As he returns, he is immediately sucked in to a web of deception involving shady characters, murder and suspicion.I thought this movie was just alright and has adequate suspense and intrigue to keep things interesting. Each character was shady and this angle made the movie interesting. In many ways it reminded me of a short story or a play adapted for the big screen. Thomas Haden Church as the clueless character was great and the rest of the characters provided him support. While this may not be the best of suspenseful movies, it was still watchable and the final frame offered closure.

What sets this film apart from other low-budget projects is that it features a great cast of veteran actors.The movie starts off as a thriller with a slow fuse, with the film evolving into a black comedy in the final half hour.  While Don Mckay isn't as well-written or interesting as a Coen Brothers film, it scores points for throwing the audience curveballs.  I thought the story was obvious and predictable, until the conclusion approached.  There's simply no way that you can predict how the story will unfold or conclude.The best part of Don Mckay is the cast.  Elisabeth Shue is gorgeous as Sonny, Don Mckay's old girlfriend who conveniently wears seductive sleepwear for most of the movie (I'm not complaining).  Keith David (the Imam in Pitch Black) gives a nice performance as Mckay's buddy Otis Kent, though he unfortunately doesn't get much screen time.  The movie is also rounded out with performances by veteran actors Pruitt Taylor Vince, M. Emmet Walsh, and James Rebhorn.  The standout performance in the movie is by Melissa Leo (Frozen River), who is spectacular as Marie, Sonny's caregiver.  I was a bit disappointed by Thomas Haden Church's performance in the lead role.  It may have been intentional for Mckay to be a shell of a man, but Church has the same expression on his face for almost the entire movie.  Also, the cinematography by first-time director Jake Goldberger is decent, and I enjoyed the film score by Steven Bramson.While Don Mckay is basically a straight-to-video movie, it's much better than your typical Redbox rental.  It won't have you on the edge of your seat the whole time, but it still offers a great cast and an unpredictable ending.",4,Black Comedy Thriller with a Slow Fuse,1271289600,"04 15, 2010",2010,1798,"['Don', 'Mckay', 'indie', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'seven', 'theaters', 'nationwide', 'actually', 'good', 'watch', 'DVD', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'other', 'low-budget', 'projects', 'great', 'cast', 'veteran', 'actors.The', 'movie', 'off', 'thriller', 'slow', 'fuse', 'film', 'evolving', 'black', 'comedy', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'Don', 'Mckay', ""n't"", 'well-written', 'interesting', 'Coen', 'Brothers', 'film', 'points', 'throwing', 'audience', 'curveballs', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'conclusion', 'approached', 'simply', 'way', 'can', 'predict', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'unfold', 'conclude.The', 'best', 'part', 'Don', 'Mckay', 'cast', 'Elisabeth', 'Shue', 'gorgeous', 'Sonny', 'Don', 'Mckay', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'conveniently', 'seductive', 'sleepwear', 'most', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'Keith', 'David', 'Imam', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'nice', 'performance', 'Mckay', 'buddy', 'Otis', 'Kent', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'also', 'rounded', 'out', 'performances', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Pruitt', 'Taylor', 'Vince', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'standout', 'performance', 'movie', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'Frozen', 'River', 'who', 'spectacular', 'Marie', 'Sonny', 'caregiver', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Thomas', 'Haden', 'Church', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intentional', 'Mckay', 'be', 'shell', 'man', 'Church', 'same', 'expression', 'face', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'Also', 'cinematography', 'first-time', 'director', 'Jake', 'Goldberger', 'decent', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'score', 'Steven', 'Bramson.While', 'Don', 'Mckay', 'basically', 'straight-to-video', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'Redbox', 'rental', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'whole', 'time', 'still', 'great', 'cast', 'unpredictable', 'ending']",N/A
1337595,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B003E0YU0O,Eric Sanberg,"[5, 5]","This is pretty much an oddball film but it's played too straight to pull off the oddballishness. Others have recounted the story so I won't bother. It IS a noir genre piece with a real cock-eyed approach. The first two acts are something you'd expect from David Lynch but they don't have Lynch's sense of quirkiness so you might find yourself scratching your head trying to figure out what the director was going for.This is Thomas Hayden Church's production so he must have seen something here. The question is what. He must have also seen something in the McKay character but that seems elusive as well. He wears a particular expression on his face throughout nearly the entire movie but I can't quite pin it. Is he dumb? Is he dumbfounded? Is he in a constant state of amazement? Whatever, it wears thin rather quickly. The plot does keep you on your toes and I really wanted to find out what the entire thing was about, and in that sense it was quite satisfying. In the third act they drop the weirdness and the film takes a sudden turn for the straight. All the cards are on the table and the plot knots get, well.....unknotted.The acting is decent. Elizabeth Shue isn't at her best but, as I'd pay to watch eat cornflakes, it didn't slow my enjoyment. The production values were good enough to get the point across. The one thing that really threw me were the songs. They seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening and did absolutely nothing to enhance or underscore what was happening on the screen.This isn't a bad movie by any means and I didn't find myself looking at my watch.
