This was a wonderful series until they decided to blow it up and take a completely different tack than the one that originally attracted people to it. i.e., the story of a young English priest in a small Irish village. And until the last episode of this series, they did a great job telling that story.  The characters were well-defined and well acted and the humor and quirkiness definitively Irish, but the center of the whole thing was the English--accent on English-- priest and when he disappeared, as far as I was concerned, the whole series collapsed, particularly in light of the way in which the two central characters were dispatched. If Kirwan and Tomkinson wanted to leave, surely the writers could have come up with a better, less abrupt and disappointing way to allow them to do it.

866144,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006FO5MI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 11]","Unfortunately the special feature on ""Ballykissangel: Complete Series One"" gave away from happened at the end of Series Three, so I have the (dis)advantage of watching these episodes knowing what the payoff was going to be.  That made me acutely aware of how things were being set up, although what I really noticed was how much these Series Three episodes avoided dealing with what was coming.  Unfortunately, in doing so the series got it away from what made it so charming, having ""outsider"" Father Peter Clifford deal with the quaint problems of the locals.  Granted, this allow some of the other characters to emerge more fully, especially Soibhan and Padraig, but Series Three turning out to be such a transitional set of episodes must have surprised fans of the show.Episode 14, ""As Happy as a Turkey on Boxing Day"" (Written by Barry Devlin, First aired December 21, 1997), offers complications at Christmas time.  Peter has a roommate in Timmy, who is not only Father Mac's nephew but about to be ordained, while Bryan is desperate to avoid Ambrose's mother.  Meanwhile, Padraig's son, Kevin, falls down a mineshaft and no one knows it.Episode 15, ""When a Child is Born"" (Written by Devlin, First aired March 1, 1998) Niamh is close to giving birth to her baby and the visit from Imelda, Ambrose's mother, is not helping.  Meanwhile, Kathleen discovers a statue in the church has started to sweat and the faithful flock to BallyK to see the miracle, much to the annoyance of Peter.Episode 16, ""Changing Time!"" (Written by Rio Fanning, First aired March 8, 1998), has the locals protesting Brian wanting to bulldoze a local beauty spot.  But when Peter and Assumpta are left alone at the protest site one night their conversation leads each to a big decision.Episode 17, ""Stardust in Your Eyes"" (Written by Fanning, First aired March 15, 1998), finds Brian gambling everything on getting a group of Koreans to invest in his project.Episode 18, ""The Fortune in Men's Eyes"" (Written by Fanning, First aired March 22, 1998), has a desperate Brian being nice to Imelda when he learns she may have the money he needs to save himself.  But his problems force Brian to lay off Liam and Donal and while Peter in on retreat, Father Mac decides to prove that he does not need a curate at BallyK.Episode 19, ""I Know When I'm Not Wanted"" (Written by Niall Leonard, First aired March 29, 1998), starts with Peter coming back to BallyK to discover that his home has been rented out because of Brian's bankruptcy.  It seems the town is upside down and to top it off Assumpta shows up back at the pub married to Leo McGarvey, while a challenge with a rival pub in Cildargan serves as a distraction.Episode 20, ""Personal Call"" (Written by Felicity Hayes McCoy, First aired April 5, 1998), finds Assumpta and Leo are not getting along, so she starts a woman's group, which does wonders for Niamh but rubs Kathleen the wrong way.  Meanwhile, when Peter butts head with Father Mac, the older priest has a heart attack.Episode 21, ""Lost Sheep"" (Written by Robert Jones, First aired April 12, 1998), is about a young woman who comes to BallyK to find out about her family.  Padraig thinks he may be the girl's father, but it turns out that somebody else in town has that honor.  Meanwhile, Assumpta's marriage comes to a head and Soibhan gets some surprising news.Episode 22, ""The Waiting Game"" (Written by Ted Gannon, First aired April 19, 1998), has BallyK catching lotto fever when it is announced that a winning ticket worth 6 million was bought in Kathleen's shop.  Who has won the money?  Father Mac's superiors certainly want him to find out.  Meanwhile, Ambrose is working undercover in Cildargan and the baby develops a new taste in music.Episode 23, ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" (Written by Tim Loane, First aired April 26, 1998) focuses on Brian's new business, which has businessmen coming to Camp Quigley to play paint ball.  The locals are fed up and ready to fight back.Episode 24, ""The Reckoning"" (Written by Kieran Prendiville, First aired May 3, 1998), comes when Peter returns to BallyK after the death of his mother and confesses his feelings to Assumpta.  Unfortunately, Ambrose has arrested all of the regulars at Fitzgerald's for drinking after hours.  Peter makes his decision and then has to live with the consequences.Episode 25, ""Amongst Friends"" (Written by Prediville, First aired May 10, 1998), finds Peter deciding about his future in BallyK.  Meanwhile, not only Leo but also a reporter have shown up in town wanting to know about the relationship between Assumpta and the curate.The last two episodes stand out from the rest.  If ""Ballykissangel"" was a situation comedy geared down to an hour-long format, then these last two episodes are more like a dramedy.  Certainly things get decidedly more serious.  Unfortunately, while the producers were smart enough not to have the show's theme music play over the end credits of ""The Reckoning,"" they still allowed it to play over the opening credits of the next episode.  To say what happens is shocking would be an obvious understatement, but it is hard not to be affected by the joke Peter tells about the young polar bear.  There was definitely chemistry between Peter and Assumpta, but it is hard not to notice this is a BBC series set in Ireland and conclude that an Anglican audience would read it much differently than a Roman Catholic one.",4,Father Peter comes to the end of his days in Ballykissangel,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",2005,5406,"['Unfortunately', 'special', 'feature', 'Ballykissangel', 'Complete', 'Series',

Apparently the two lead actors playing Assumpta and Father Peter wanted to leave, and so they were written out in a real traumatic series of events. Niamh takes over the pub after Brian buys it, and a new young priest is assigned. What's the big deal? The series is still great; in fact, in my opinion, it's even better, as opposed to when it was focused on the relationship between the sultry but skittish proprietor of Fitzgerald's pub and the conflicted priest. I couldn't ever quite buy the whole premise of Father Peter's strong attraction to Assumpta. Why her? Yes, she was hot and all that, but she was adamant in her rejection of the totality of Christianity and God. I'm no expert, but I am a Catholic, and I know a few ex-priests. I don't know any of them who gave up the priesthood for an atheist or agnostic. Quite the contrary, they seem to have taken up with women of strong faith.Regardless, without Assumpta and Peter to obsess about, there is adequate time to delve into stories about the many other wonderful and interesting characters in the series: Padraig, Brendan, Eamon, Liam, Donal, Siobhan, Brian, Niamh, Ambrose, Kathleen. And of course, compelling new characters enter, most notably Sean Dillon and daughter Emma.The greatness of the series is due to the intimacy and beauty of the surroundings, the depth of the characters, the fascinating language and the full gamut of human emotions, all of which are presented so artfully in each and every episode.

When the series started being released on DVD, I picked up my copies and watched the first two seasons for the first time and became a fan.  I recently picked up the third season and was a little disappointed.  Overall the episodes were great.  However, I felt that Stephen Tompkinson's character, Father Peter Clifford, went from being very likeable to somewhat painful to watch.  His feelings for Dervla Kirwan's character, Assumpta Fitzgerald, reasonably explains some of this change.  However, I wonder if he was just getting tired of the series.  In the end, both Dervla and himself wanted to leave the series after Season 3 and this resulted in a very abrupt ending.  I believe that adding one or two episodes may have eased the transition to Season 4 and would have produced a more satisfying ending.  However, the ending was quite thought provoking which cannot be said of many series.  If you are a fan of the series, you will not want to miss this collection of episodes on DVD.  If you know nothing about the series, start with Season 1 and work your way through.  I think you will get hooked as I was.  On a technical note, I was disappointed in the lack of extras other than a cast bio.

866173,ARKM6W78EYDR1,B0006FO5MI,"Roland R. Lafrance Sr. ""docresq2""","[1, 1]","They should have ended the show as abruptly as they a life, and a relationship in the next to last show of series three.  I've watched all the shows of all the series, and for me, it ends when Peter (Father Peter Clifford) tells Asumpta that he loves her, and her comment about removing his collar before saying that. Until that moment, this show was five stars!  I refuse to watch the rest of that show. I've seen enough of death & suffering. I am a disabled firefighter-medic and nurse, disabled due to a fire injury. I was brought up in the Catholic church, was an altar boy and considered the priesthood, until I realized how much I liked girls, and left the church many years ago, and what Peter started feeling, with lots of help from Father Mac, is what I felt. Why couldn't they have allowed Asumpta & Peter to go off the show, happy, and together?? I thoroughly enjoyed the first three series. The characters were complicated, and fun. The enjoyment left with Asumpta's death and Peter's leaving, after throwing his Roman collar in the river. Besides Niamh and Ambrose (another destroyed relationship later on), the only other interesting character is Orla, sister of the next priest to come to Ballyk. I enjoyed watching the relationship between Asumpta & Peter grow from mistrust and prejudice on the side of Asumpta, to their hardly unknown growing feelings for each other as the show, and the first three series built up to that final act. Despite my name, I'm told I have Irish in me, and one movie, &#34;THE QUIET MAN&#34;, and two acts, &#34;CELTIC WOMAN&#34; & &#34;BALLYKISSANGEL&#34; have piqued my interest in Ireland, at least the first three series of Ballyk. I'll only watch the rest of them, as my wife hasn't yet seen them all, as I have, and I would rather not. These first three series are as entertaining as they can be, and I have a few favorite episodes.  &#34;WHEN A CHILD IS BORN&#34; is one of them, as Peter starts to question what he does. All of the series seem to want to paint a certain picture of the &#34;church&#34;, which isn't a good picture, always, especially with Father Mac and his ways of bias and lack of what I would call true Christian virtue. Peter & Asumpta were the main characters, but other characters shine through, but it is the loss of Peter & Asumpta that brings this show to an abrupt and sad halt, and  it never picks up again. The show also paints a certain picture of the Irish, and the priests, who never seem to let the opportunity to have a drink go by, or the dirty dealings of Quigley and Dooley to be so up front.But, this show really brings out some serious social issues in an honest way, such as young girls abandoning babies on the priest's doorstep, domestic violence, among others. This show is important, and great for bringing these issues out in the manner they did. But later, a woman, Niamh, tells Father Peter, the first time she ever spoke to him, (Series 1, first show), that she doesn't believe in divorce, changes her outlook in a later series. Another tragedy is portrayed. This world is full enough of tragedies, that what was a decent show doesn't have to resort to &#34;soap opera&#34; thinking. Thank you for the first three seasons, at least until it came to an abrupt and painful end, in &#34;THE RECKONING&#34;, the last part of which I'll never watch again, when Father Peter is basically forced to give Last Rites to the woman he loves, and whom he knows didn't want them. The rest of the series are hardly worth watching. Sad, but true.",5,"Great show, for the first three series!",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,3533,"['should', 'have', 'ended', 'show', 'as', 'abruptly', 'life', 'relationship', 'next', 'last', 'show', 'series', 'three', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'shows', 'series', 'when', 'Peter', 'Father', 'Peter', 'Clifford', 'comment', 'removing', 'collar', 'saying', 'moment', 'show', 'was', 'five', 'stars', 'refuse', 'watch', 'rest', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'death', 'suffering', 'am', 'disabled', 'firefighter-medic', 'nurse', 'disabled', 'due', 'fire', 'injury', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'Catholic', 'church', 'was', 'altar', 'boy', 'considered', 'priesthood', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'girls', 'left', 'church', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'Peter', 'started', 'feeling', 'lots', 'help', 'Father', 'Mac', 'what', 'felt', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'allowed', 'Asumpta', 'Peter', 'go', 'off', 'show', 'happy', 'together', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'characters', 'were', 'complicated', 'fun', 'enjoyment', 'left', 'Asumpta', 'death', 'Peter', 'leaving', 'throwing', 'Roman', 'collar', 'river', 'Niamh', 'Ambrose', 'destroyed', 'relationship', 'later', 'only', 'other', 'interesting', 'character', 'Orla', 'sister', 'next', 'priest', 'come', 'Ballyk', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'relationship', 'Asumpta', 'Peter', 'grow', 'mistrust', 'prejudice', 'side', 'Asumpta', 'hardly', 'unknown', 'growing', 'feelings', 'other', 'show', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'built', 'final', 'act', 'name', ""'m"", 'told', 'have', 'Irish', 'one', 'movie', '34', 'THE', 'QUIET', 'MAN', '34', 'two', 'acts', '34', 'CELTIC', 'WOMAN', '34', '34', 'BALLYKISSANGEL', '34', 'have', 'piqued', 'interest', 'Ireland', 'least', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'Ballyk', ""'ll"", 'only', 'watch', 'rest', 'wife', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'all', 'have', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'first', 'three', 'series', 'are', 'as', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'few', 'favorite', 'episodes', '34', 'WHEN', 'CHILD', 'IS', 'BORN', '34', 'one', 'Peter', 'question', 'what', 'series', 'seem', 'want', 'paint', 'certain', 'picture', '34', 'church', '34', ""n't"", 'good', 'picture', 'always', 'especially', 'Father', 'Mac', 'ways', 'bias', 'lack', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'true', 'Christian', 'virtue', 'Peter', 'Asumpta', 'were', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'shine', 'loss', 'Peter', 'Asumpta', 'show', 'abrupt', 'sad', 'halt', 'never', 'up', 'again', 'show', 'also', 'certain', 'picture', 'Irish', 'priests', 'who', 'never', 'seem', 'let', 'opportunity', 'have', 'drink', 'go', 'dirty', 'dealings', 'Quigley', 'Dooley', 'be', 'so', 'up', 'front.But', 'show', 'really', 'out', 'serious', 'social', 'issues', 'honest', 'way', 'such', 'young', 'girls', 'abandoning', 'babies', 'priest', 'doorstep', 'domestic', 'violence', 'others', 'show', 'important', 'great', 'bringing', 'issues', 'out', 'manner', 'did', 'later', 'woman', 'Niamh', 'Father', 'Peter', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'spoke', 'Series', '1', 'first', 'show', ""n't"", 'believe', 'divorce', 'outlook', 'later', 'series', 'tragedy', 'portrayed', 'world', 'full', 'enough', 'tragedies', 'what', 'was', 'decent', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'resort', '34', 'soap', 'opera', '34', 'thinking', 'Thank', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'least', 'came', 'abrupt', 'painful', 'end', '34', 'THE', 'RECKONING', '34', 'last', 'part', ""'ll"", 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'when', 'Father', 'Peter', 'basically', 'forced', 'give', 'Last', 'Rites', 'woman', 'whom', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'rest', 'series', 'are', 'hardly', 'worth', 'watching', 'Sad', 'true']",N/A
