Fueled by Steve Buscemi's seething performance as uber-antihero Nucky Thompson, the series is probably the most consistently high-quality show on cable TV, circa 2013. The level of writing, acting and production matches the taut, flawless, compelling drama of ""Deadwood,"" and ""The Wire"" -- exhalted company where the show's producers never hit lulls and refuse to coast or pad things out. The program is always compelling, the writing is concise and well-structured, and everything you see on screen looks great. The only weak spot comes with the over-the-top portrayal of Bobby Cannavale's gangster character, ""Gyp"" Rosetti, but even with the oooh-he's-into-kinky-sex tedium, Rosetti is a truly terrifying, menacing antagonist, and Cannavale puts in one of his best career performances with this meaty role.

1598730,ARHEOXJRZX6NI,B009LDD54K,"Donald E. Zlotnik ""Novelist""","[3, 25]","Some series lose their way; the 3rd season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE has successfully done that. The HBO series has some powerful names involved; Whalberg, VanPatten and Scorsese, but their names only lent money to the production and not quality. The props, costumes and filming are superb but the storyline is a disaster. You can almost tell where one of the producers said, ""We need to add some black actors"" and a scene using the contracted black actors is added. Characters from prior seasons appear out of nowhere and disappear as suddenly. If you haven't seen the first two seasons (even with the added 14 minute intro)you have no idea who they are and their place in the production. The part of the season that I found so absolutely insulting was the generous use of perverted sex scenes that were nothing more than the writers either living out their sexual fantasies or ""sharing"" with us their actual sexual practices. The scene where a small boy is exposed to adults engaged in sexual intercourse was absolutely unnecessary and added NOTHING to the storyline, which as I said, is wanting, fragmented and loses even the most dedicated fan. Hollywood writers assume viewers are ignorant and cannot see the obvious politically correct slants to their characters. All the blacks are ""righteous"" and ""justified"" in their anger at being held down by the whites--that highly exaggerated line has become very old.  The personal relationships are mostly based on adultery, betrayal and manipulation; we aren't even given a few decent love stories or decent human characters. The Hollywood writers contempt for Christianity is slipped (snuck) in with smug hidden little innuendos like the iron salesman who was a devoted Christian turning into a nut case.The storyline started out in season 1 with bootlegging, political corruption, gangsters etc.--and ended up with nothing more than gross perversions and absolutely no ""heroes"" (the good kind) for the viewer to identify with--sad at best.Great costumes--great props; horrible storyline.

With each episode I find myself more riveted by bootleg, political boss &#34;Nucky&#34; Thompson, et al. Thompson is superbly played by Steve Buscemi).Season three of Boardwalk Empire opens on the last day of 1922.  &#34;Nucky&#34; throws an extraordinarily party to welcome in 1923. His shindig is a huge success. The guests are delighted with the Egyptian theme and expensive gifts. Singer, performer, comedian, dancer, actor and songwriter, Eddie Cantor, (portrayed by Stephen DeRosa), brings Billie Kent, (Meg Steedle), with him to provide musical entertainment. Ms. Kent is a recurring character in the third season of Boardwalk Empire. She is a young Broadway actress, a bit of a floozy - and &#34;Nucky's&#34; new mistress. Newly empowered, and enriched, the undisputed king of the Atlantic City rackets can certainly afford the expense of such lavishness. Why a mistress when he has the always stunning, intelligent Margaret, (Kelly Macdonald), as a wife? His relationship with Margaret is very tense especially after she signs his highway jackpot over to the church. Anyway, back to the party... as always, the costumes are stunning, and the music is fun. The acting, direction, writing is all top notch, and the plot is the best so far.Nucky has cut a lucrative distribution deal with New York gambler Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg). Unfortunately he has a new competitor. Giuseppe Colombano Rosetti, nicknamed &#34;Gyp&#34;, is a main character and the primary antagonist in this third season. Gyp is a violent and unpredictable Sicilian gangster, sensitive to slights...no matter how slight...no matter if the &#34;slight&#34; is all in his psychotic head. And when &#34;Gyp&#34; blows his top, someone usually dies, quite violently. Just before midnight Nucky assembles his bootlegging contacts in the kitchen. He tells them that because of the attention on the Harding administration he is going to be supplying Arnold Rothstein exclusively. Rosetti is outraged and storms out, after going berserk and delivering a tirade of abuse on Nucky and his associates.Former FBI agent Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon), has fled to Chicago after committing murder He has a new job as a door-to-door salesman However, fate has other plans for him. J. Edgar Hoover would be apocalyptic at Van Alden's behavior. How did he ever pass screening??? This guy is a real psycho also...but I guess one would have to be to think and do what these characters do.I miss Jimmy Darmody, (Michael Pitt), but my favorite character is war maimed, sharpshooter, Richard Harrow, (Jack Huston). He is back with a greater role to play. Richard is Jim Darmody's old war buddy and became his driver after the war. I imagine, given his shooting skills, he also guarded Darmody' back. After Darmody's unfortunate and untimely demise Richard continues to raise Jimmy's orphaned son, Tommy Darmody, as though he were his own child.With the exception of Darmody, all the regulars return and continue with their adventures, or misadventures. Nucky's brother Elias &#34;Eli&#34; Thompson, (Shea Whigham); a young Al Capone, (Stephen Graham ); Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano, (Vincent Piazza); Albert &#34;Chalky White, (Michael Kenneth Williams); Edward &#34;Eddie&#34; Kessler, (Anthony Laciura); Commodore Louis Kaestner, (Dabney Coleman); Owen Sleater, (Charlie Cox); Johnny Torrio, (Greg Antonacci); etc.Frequently the female characters appear to be stronger, smarter/craftier and more subtle in the ways of manipulation than their male counterparts. They don't use guns...they use their minds. All are back this season: Margaret Thompson, (Kelly Macdonald), formerly Schroeder, n&eacute;e Rohan, was a young Irish widow, a mother of two, and now &#34;Nucky's wife; Gillian Darmody, (Gretchen Mol), is Jimmy's mother, an old friend of Nucky's and the beautiful &#34;Madam&#34; of a classy house of ill repute; Gillian is  very saavy about power and can play the &#34;power game&#34; with the &#34;big boys;&#34; Angela Darmody, (Aleksa Palladino), is Jimmy's wife and the mother of his young son.A major part of the series includes the story of a twenties gang called &#34;The Combined&#34; or &#34;Big Seven Group.&#34; &#34;Boardwalk&#34; incorporates these historical figures in Season Three. The biggies on the east coast are part of it and it is multicultural, as crime is. Seven different gangs: Sicilian, Italian, Jewish, and Irish come together to bring people booze during Prohibition. They also bring a little bit of smack or &#34;something in the sack.&#34; This group is the precursor to the National Crime Syndicate of the 1930s. The Big Seven includes Charles &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano's, (Vincent Piazza), and Meyer Lansky&#8217;s, (Anatol Yusef), operations as well as Enoch &#34;Nucky&#34; Johnson and Abner &#34;Longy&#34; Zwillman&#8217;s outfits from New Jersey, Moe Dalitz's from Cleveland, Waxey Gordon's Harry &#34;Nig&#34; Rosen's of Philadelphia, Danny Walsh is the representative for Providence, Rhode Island. Johnny Torrio, (Greg Antonacci) is a kind of consigliere. A very young Al Capone, (Stephen Graham), is too busy dealing with the North Side Gang. However, Capone does attend the Atlantic City Conference of 1929. And Giuseppe Masseria, ( Anthony Quinn ), is best known as &#34;Joe the Boss.&#34; He is also known as &#34;the man who can dodge bullets&#34; because he survives a multi-gun execution attempt on Bowery.I highly recommend this gripping series, especially as it is now available on DVD. You can watch the entire series in a few sittings.JANA",5,Best Season Yet!!,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,5676,"['am', 'assuming', 'readers', 'review', 'are', 'familiar', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"",

1598754,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B009LDD54K,Kellyannl,"[104, 110]","This season of Boardwalk - in which Jimmy's warning comes back to haunt him - recounts a very bad year for Nucky while also developing the organized crime mythology of the time.After Margaret's stunt at the end of Season 2, the Thompson's marriage goes on the rocks, with both eventually guilty of extramarital affairs, Nucky indulging first and most blatantly and Margaret's situation undoubtedly complicated by her daughter's polio diagnosis adding another hurdle to her easily leaving Nucky.  That is soon the least of Nucky's problems, however, with deranged Gyp Rosetti - played with scenery chewing relish by Bobby Cannavale - making a play for AC and sending Nucky into a battle for not only his power, but his life.The series begins the process of developing historical figures like Meyer Lansky, Al Capone (Stephen Graham in a performance that has some fans making noises about wanting him to headline a series about Capone's Eliot Ness years after Boardwalk is over) and Charles Luciano (not so lucky yet) into the legendary figures that many people have at least a passing knowledge of.  It also does equally well with it's fictional characters, notably Michael Kenneth Williams' winning Chalky White and Gretchen Mol's increasingly disturbing Gillian Darmody.  Van Alden takes a bit of a backburner, but finds himself in the most deliciously ironic situation of the entire cast when he is around.  The heart of the series, however, is undoubtedly Jack Huston's magnificent Richard Harrow, who's the closest thing the story has to a hero in a world where everyone's morally ambiguous.  Mourning the loss of his dear friends the Darmodys, Richard couldn't care two cents for the gangland wars going down, but is rather focused on saving his friends' son, Tommy, from the influence of his psycho Grandma.  With the purest motive of any character in the story, it's Richard who we're rooting for all the way.  It says something about the twisted world of Boardwalk that the thing we most desperately want to see this season is a sniper getting custody of a little boy from his last remaining blood relative.We also get a look at social issues such as the treatment of minorities as seen through the glass ceiling Chalky faces, what life was like for women before legal birth control (let alone abortions), and even - in some surprisingly heartbreaking scenes involving Capone and his little boy - the lack of resources for parents of special needs children.  The 20's might look fun on paper, but they probably still weren't a great time to live in for alot of people.Finally, of course, there's Nucky himself, who this season finds himself at his most brutal but also doing some real self-assesment when he sees who stands by him at his lowest ebb.Those who have been following Boardwalk Empire will find no reason to stop now.",4,Turf Wars,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,2836,"['season', 'Boardwalk', 'Jimmy', 'warning', 'back', 'haunt', 'very', 'bad', 'year', 'Nucky', 'also', 'developing', 'organized', 'crime', 'mythology', 'time.After', 'Margaret', 'stunt', 'end', 'Season', '2', 'Thompson', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'eventually', 'guilty', 'extramarital', 'affairs', 'Nucky', 'indulging', 'first', 'most', 'blatantly', 'Margaret', 'situation', 'undoubtedly', 'complicated', 'daughter', 'polio', 'diagnosis', 'adding', 'hurdle', 'easily', 'leaving', 'Nucky', 'soon', 'least', 'Nucky', 'problems', 'however', 'deranged', 'Gyp', 'Rosetti', 'played', 'scenery', 'chewing', 'relish', 'Bobby', 'Cannavale', 'making', 'play', 'AC', 'sending', 'Nucky', 'battle', 'not', 'only', 'power', 'life.The', 'series', 'process', 'developing', 'historical', 'figures', 'Meyer', 'Lansky', 'Al', 'Capone', 'Stephen', 'Graham', 'performance', 'fans', 'making', 'noises', 'wanting', 'headline', 'series', 'Capone', 'Eliot', 'Ness', 'years', 'Boardwalk', 'Charles', 'Luciano', 'not', 'so', 'lucky', 'yet', 'legendary', 'figures', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'least', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'also', 'equally', 'well', 'fictional', 'characters', 'notably', 'Michael', 'Kenneth', 'Williams', 'winning', 'Chalky', 'White', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'Gillian', 'Darmody', 'Van', 'Alden', 'bit', 'backburner', 'most', 'deliciously', 'ironic', 'situation', 'entire', 'cast', 'when', 'around', 'heart', 'series', 'however', 'undoubtedly', 'Jack', 'Huston', 'magnificent', 'Richard', 'Harrow', 'who', 'closest', 'thing', 'story', 'hero', 'world', 'where', 'everyone', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'Mourning', 'loss', 'dear', 'Darmodys', 'Richard', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'two', 'cents', 'gangland', 'going', 'down', 'rather', 'focused', 'saving', 'friends', 'son', 'Tommy', 'influence', 'psycho', 'Grandma', 'purest', 'motive', 'character', 'story', 'Richard', 'who', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'way', 'something', 'twisted', 'world', 'Boardwalk', 'thing', 'most', 'desperately', 'want', 'see', 'season', 'sniper', 'getting', 'custody', 'little', 'boy', 'last', 'remaining', 'blood', 'relative.We', 'also', 'get', 'look', 'social', 'issues', 'such', 'treatment', 'minorities', 'seen', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'Chalky', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'women', 'legal', 'birth', 'control', 'let', 'alone', 'abortions', 'even', 'surprisingly', 'heartbreaking', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Capone', 'little', 'boy', 'lack', 'resources', 'parents', 'special', 'needs', 'children', '20', 'might', 'look', 'fun', 'paper', 'probably', 'still', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'time', 'live', 'alot', 'people.Finally', 'course', 'Nucky', 'who', 'season', 'most', 'brutal', 'also', 'doing', 'real', 'self-assesment', 'when', 'who', 'lowest', 'ebb.Those', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'will', 'find', 'reason', 'stop', 'now']",Boardwalk Empire: Season 3

1598759,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B009LDD54K,Little Roy Blue,"[16, 45]","Season three of ""Boardwalk Empire"" boasts a fantastic cast and gorgeous production values. Unfortunately, the major storyline is a predictable tale of turf war between two gangsters - the sort of plot we've all seen 1,000 times before. So, in my (admittedly dissenting) opinion, the prodigious talent of the actors and designers is wasted on scripts that seem sophisticated on the surface, but are actually just lurid and unoriginal.Perhaps the biggest waste of talent is the casting of Steve Buscemi as the chief gangster, Nucky Thompson - a thoroughly boring character whose defining trait is being really impatient with his subordinates (one wonders why anyone remains loyal to him!) Now, I really love Buscemi in movies like Fargo and Ghost World, where he gives wonderfully strange and funny performances. But why should I want to see him cast as a standard ""heavy"" in this series? He simply doesn't work in this context.On a positive note, several of the other characters are far more interesting than Nucky. I particularly like Jack Huston as Richard Harrow, a sympathetically portrayed veteran, and Michael Shannon as George Mueller, who in this season works a demeaning job as an electric iron salesman. The sequences featuring these characters tend to have a lot more humor, heart and interest than the clich&eacute;d gangster material.But alas, for every good character in the show, there is a corresponding boring one. For example, I have little love for Gretchen Mol's bizarre madam character, who spends the entire season complaining that she doesn't have enough upkeep money for her brothel. Another weak point is Nucky's wife, played by Kelly Macdonald, who features in a storyline about starting a women's health clinic that shows promise but goes absolutely nowhere. The main villain of the season, meanwhile, is very entertaining but not terribly convincing; how would such a clearly unhinged guy ever rise to a position of real power in the underworld?The quality of the show see-saws tremendously depending on which of these characters is heavily featured in an episode. But, viewing it as a whole, I found this season to be rather weak. Too many of the episodes are talky and dull, and when the ""action"" arrives, it usually takes the form of some tacky sex scene or predictable explosion of violence. In the end, the show feels more like a bad pulp novel than a truly intelligent drama. Frankly, I'd rather watch The Godfather instead...or The Sopranos, or Fargo, or maybe an old James Cagney movie. This show doesn't really bring anything new to the gangster genre.",2,A mediocre season for an over-hyped show,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,2588,"['Season', 'three', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'gorgeous', 'production', 'values', 'Unfortunately', 'major', 'storyline', 'predictable', 'tale', 'turf', 'war', 'two', 'gangsters', 'sort', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'seen', '1,000', 'times', 'before', 'So', 'admittedly', 'dissenting', 'opinion', 'prodigious', 'talent', 'actors', 'designers', 'wasted', 'scripts', 'seem', 'sophisticated', 'surface', 'are', 'actually', 'just', 'lurid', 'biggest', 'waste', 'talent', 'casting', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'chief', 'gangster', 'Nucky', 'Thompson', 'thoroughly', 'boring', 'character', 'defining', 'trait', 'being', 'really', 'impatient', 'subordinates', 'one', 'why', 'anyone', 'loyal', 'Now', 'really', 'love', 'Buscemi', 'movies', 'Fargo', 'Ghost', 'World', 'where', 'wonderfully', 'strange', 'funny', 'performances', 'why', 'should', 'want', 'see', 'cast', 'standard', 'heavy', 'series', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'context.On', 'positive', 'note', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'Nucky', 'particularly', 'Jack', 'Huston', 'Richard', 'Harrow', 'sympathetically', 'portrayed', 'veteran', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'George', 'Mueller', 'who', 'season', 'demeaning', 'job', 'electric', 'iron', 'salesman', 'sequences', 'featuring', 'characters', 'tend', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'humor', 'heart', 'interest', 'clich', 'eacute', 'gangster', 'material.But', 'alas', 'good', 'character', 'show', 'corresponding', 'boring', 'one', 'example', 'have', 'little', 'love', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'bizarre', 'madam', 'character', 'who', 'entire', 'season', 'complaining', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'upkeep', 'money', 'brothel', 'weak', 'point', 'Nucky', 'wife', 'played', 'Kelly', 'Macdonald', 'who', 'storyline', 'starting', 'women', 'health', 'clinic', 'promise', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'main', 'villain', 'season', 'meanwhile', 'very', 'entertaining', 'not', 'terribly', 'convincing', 'how', 'would', 'such', 'clearly', 'unhinged', 'guy', 'ever', 'rise', 'position', 'real', 'power', 'underworld', 'quality', 'show', 'see-saws', 'tremendously', 'depending', 'characters', 'heavily', 'featured', 'episode', 'viewing', 'whole', 'found', 'season', 'be', 'rather', 'weak', 'Too', 'many', 'episodes', 'are', 'talky', 'dull', 'when', 'action', 'arrives', 'usually', 'form', 'tacky', 'sex', 'scene', 'predictable', 'explosion', 'violence', 'end', 'show', 'more', 'bad', 'pulp', 'novel', 'truly', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'Frankly', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Godfather', 'instead', 'Sopranos', 'Fargo', 'maybe', 'old', 'James', 'Cagney', 'movie', 'show', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'new', 'gangster', 'genre']",Boardwalk Empire: Season 3

1598761,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B009LDD54K,maskirovka,"[20, 31]","I decided to adapt the tag line for this season of Boardwalk Empire as the title of my review because I felt it was so appropriate for what was right and wrong with season 3 of Boardwalk Empire.  The show is at its best (and it is a riveting best) when it focuses on what the show is supposed to be about...gangsters and corrupt politicians jockeying for power, money, turf, and prestige in Prohibition-era America.  The show falters --significantly-- when it tries to be other things, namely...&lt;spoilers>An exploration about how hard it was to get proper prenatal care for women in that era.  I know that the struggle to get proper education about birth control and how to manage a pregnancy may have been happening in the Prohibition era, and I salute the women and men who led the fight to get that education out there.  But it TOTALLY did not belong as a significant story in Boardwalk Empire.  I found myself fast-forwarding my Tivo whenever Margaret's character was visiting the hospital or giving classes.  It was totally disconnected from what the other characters were all doing in the series.I'm actually starting to dislike Margaret's character overall and I found myself sort of wishing Nucky had killed her or discarded her when he found out she had been playing around with Owen Sleater.  I liked her fine in season one and some in season 2.  But she's getting a bit tiresome with her holier than thou attitude.  Besides, did the character seriously think she was going to be trading up by going with Sleater?  The man was a former terrorist, a gangster, and someone capable of strangling someone with piano wire.  Oh, and while he was canoodling with Margaret, he was also bedding one of the Thompson household maids ... which is something Margaret knew about.  Given that the show made a point of emphasizing how ""shrewd"" and self-taught she was, she comes across as a bit of an idiot.I hope in season 4, Margaret either reconciles with Nucky and comes back to him and perhaps even becomes an active participant (consigliere of sorts) or the character gets written out...one way or another.There are some other flaws with season 3 besides the ""Margaret Problem.""  I liked the actor who played Gyp Rosetti and I thought he was a pretty good villain. But they overplayed his uncontrollable violence.  I find it hard to believe a criminal who had so little control over his impulses to violence would rise very high as a gangster.  I could see him as a hitman or enforcer, but never as a boss.I also have to gig Boardwalk Empire for leaving a couple of things rather unexplained (at least at the close of season 3):1.  Nelson Van Alden's character and his ""nanny"" somehow seems to have gotten an upgrade where suddenly she's his wife.  It would have been nice if there had been a bit of back story to that.  I actually rather like the character of the wife, and I hope we see more of VanAlden as well as the Dion O'Bannion character who might become his boss.2.  Another thing that I would have liked explained was why Capone came riding to the rescue of Nucky Thompson (which was done in a fantastic way).  Eli supposedly made a ""deal"" with Capone to do this, but couldn't they have given a line of dialogue explaining why Capone would have come all the way from Chicago to do this?Now as for the good parts:1.  I thought they did a good job tying Chalky White's character and criminal operation into the main story arcs.2.  Arnold Rothstein and Masseria both come across serious potential opponents/sparring partners/partners for Nucky Thompson.  I hope we see more of Masseria next season in particular.3.  The last three episodes were great when the series pretty much focused on the power struggle between Nucky and Rosetti.4.  Gillian Darmody's character continues to develop as an unbelievably twisted and evil but also pathetic character.  I was truly taken by surprise by the ultimate fate of the young man who had a passing resemblance to her murdered son she had taken as a lover.5.  I thought the rehabilitation of Eli Thompson as a major partner of Nucky was done well and was believable.  And the episode that focused mostly on the home life of the principal characters had some good scenes with Nucky and his brother.It'll be interesting to see what season 4 brings us.  I really hope the Margaret character is either brought more into the storyline (like Chalky) or she's gone ... one way or another.  We'll see.  I just hope they keep the story focused on what's made Boardwalk Empire so compelling these past three years...murder, corruption, bootlegging, etc and not soap opera elements and women's health issues.",4,"""You can't be a half a series about Prohibition-era gangsters.""",1355011200,"12 9, 2012",2012,4648,"['decided', 'adapt', 'tag', 'line', 'season', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'title',
