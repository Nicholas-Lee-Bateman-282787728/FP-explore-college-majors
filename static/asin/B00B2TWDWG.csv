The reason for my 3-star rating is the distracting scenery in the background. The corner of the pool where they are working out has trees in the background. When they move around in front of the trees it really makes a person dizzy. At first I thought it was just me, but I've loaned this DVD to 2 different friends & they both said the same thing.  Great workout, just wish she would have been set-up in front of a more solid, less distracting background.",3,Good workout but distracting scenery,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",2013,546,"['really', 'good', 'workout', 'shorter', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'reason', '3-star', 'rating', 'distracting', 'scenery', 'background', 'corner', 'pool', 'where', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'trees', 'background', 'When', 'move', 'around', 'front', 'trees', 'really', 'person', 'dizzy', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'just', ""'ve"", 'loaned', 'DVD', '2', 'different', 'friends', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Great', 'workout', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'set-up', 'front', 'more', 'solid', 'less', 'distracting', 'background']",Total Body Balance DVD
1621356,AVI7WGFMF7GAJ,B00B2TWDWG,"JessicaT ""Did you say: &#34;cake?&#34;""","[3, 3]","Just received my first Jessica Smith DVD yesterday & worked out with it today.DVD consists of four workouts approximately 20 minutes in length = Cardio Flow, Sole Sculpt, Core Stretch and Cardio Dance Sculpt. I managed all but Core Stretch today.When reviewing the DVD yesterday, the workouts looked easy but boy did they work up a sweat. I thought the indoor setting for Cardio Dance Sculpt would annoy me when working out what with the light coming through the window behind Jessica being very bright at times. But I really did not notice it while I was working out today. I was too busy concentrating on the moves, and being a non dancer, I was busy thinking: I'll bet I look like the Tin Man while doing these dance moves because I sure feel like him! :-\Jessica has a lovely, gentle & encouraging personality. She's AMAZING at cuing her next move - Jessica and her workouts on this DVD remind me of Ellen Barret but on x2 fast forward! Still very easy to follow thanks to her AMAZING cuing. Did I mention she's amazing at cuing? hahahaha - I just really appreciate that after working out with instructors who expect you to be psychic about their next move - so frustrating! No frustration here. And no strained neck from turning it to see what she's doing next. She even tells us a few times not to look at her because we know the move and she'll let us know when it's time to change. Such consideration and care for her viewer.  Really really glad I bought the DVD even though it's pricier than what I would normally pay for workout DVDs on Amazon - but hey - still cheaper than regular live classes of any sort and if I love a DVD the regular use will make it worth it.This DVD and all of EB's are really about honouring the body. Not killing yourself to get fit/toned. Not sure what Jessica's other DVDs would be like though.Five stars for the DVD and A+++ for the instructor - Thank you Jessica Smith!!",5,Jessica Smith is A+++ instructor,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,1911,"['Just', 'received', 'first', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'worked', 'out', 'consists', 'four', 'workouts', 'approximately', '20', 'minutes', 'length', '=', 'Cardio', 'Flow', 'Sole', 'Sculpt', 'Core', 'Stretch', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Sculpt', 'managed', 'Core', 'Stretch', 'today.When', 'reviewing', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'workouts', 'looked', 'easy', 'did', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'thought', 'indoor', 'setting', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Sculpt', 'would', 'annoy', 'when', 'working', 'out', 'what', 'light', 'coming', 'window', 'Jessica', 'being', 'very', 'bright', 'times', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'notice', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'today', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'concentrating', 'moves', 'being', 'non', 'dancer', 'was', 'busy', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'look', 'Tin', 'Man', 'doing', 'dance', 'moves', 'sure', 'feel', '-\\Jessica', 'lovely', 'gentle', 'encouraging', 'personality', 'AMAZING', 'cuing', 'next', 'move', 'Jessica', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'remind', 'Ellen', 'Barret', 'x2', 'fast', 'forward', 'Still', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'thanks', 'AMAZING', 'cuing', 'Did', 'mention', 'amazing', 'cuing', 'hahahaha', 'just', 'really', 'appreciate', 'working', 'out', 'instructors', 'who', 'expect', 'be', 'psychic', 'next', 'move', 'so', 'frustrating', 'frustration', 'here', 'strained', 'neck', 'turning', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'next', 'even', 'few', 'times', 'not', 'look', 'know', 'move', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'when', 'time', 'change', 'Such', 'consideration', 'care', 'viewer', 'Really', 'really', 'bought', 'DVD', 'even', 'pricier', 'what', 'would', 'normally', 'pay', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', 'hey', 'still', 'cheaper', 'regular', 'live', 'classes', 'sort', 'love', 'DVD', 'regular', 'use', 'will', 'make', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'EB', 'are', 'really', 'honouring', 'body', 'Not', 'killing', 'get', 'fit/toned', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'Jessica', 'other', 'DVDs', 'would', 'be', 'though.Five', 'stars', 'DVD', 'A+++', 'instructor', 'Thank', 'Jessica', 'Smith']",Total Body Balance DVD
1621357,A1EYVZ0P09BVEU,B00B2TWDWG,Katharine A. Draper,"[4, 4]","I've been doing Jessica Smith's YouTube videos and jessicasmithtv.com's challenges for about five months now and decided it was time to try a DVD (this and 10 Pounds Down Better Body Blast).  I was not disappointed!  While some of her online videos were much more difficult I thought this DVD was a solid series of workouts that weren't hard on the joints but still made me sweat.  With four separate 20 minute segments it makes it easy to mix and match depending on what type of exercise you're looking for.Cardio Flow: I was surprised that this had me sweating as much as it did because it was very low impact and done with minimal space and movements that weren't difficult (she does offer options to make things tougher).  I enjoyed it because I'm not a fan of HIIT or anything that incorporates jumping, jogging, etc.  It may not be as intense but it still got the heart pumping!Sole Sculpt: I did this with 5 pound weights and thought it was effective but not too challenging (we'll if I feel the same tomorrow morning!).  She targets most areas but I wish there had been more work done on the biceps; most seemed to focus on the back muscles and triceps.  If you're looking for more of a dumbbell workout she has a lot on her website to choose from.  However, on days where you just don't have the energy this is a good option.Core stretch:  I really enjoyed this segment as it was both relaxing and I did feel it in my core.  I've always liked standing or yoga inspired abdominal routines and while this didn't include standing there were many unique moves.  Looks easier than it actually was as I had a modify a few to get through them!Cardio dance sculpt:  This one was really good for the legs as it was very ballet inspired.  Once again low impact but I found myself sweating despite that.  The arms didn't get quite as good of a workout but I am used to using weights.The main draw of the DVD is Jessica.  She is absolute delight, unlike drill sergeant instructors (Jillian Michaels, I'm talking to you).  She's sweet and encouraging, doesn't annoy you with mindless chit chat and is feeling the burn along with you.  The music fit perfectly for each routine and the scenery was lovely but not distracting.  While not as difficult as Better Body Blast, which has more intense cardio bursts, this DVD did what it should: got the blood pumping, was easy on the joints and gave me a well rounded workout.  I did all the routines in one shot but depending on your mood or level of soreness you can just do or two one if you're short on time.  Highly recommend and am looking forward to Jessica's two new DVDs that will be released soon!",5,Well rounded low impact program that still makes you sweat!,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,2645,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'YouTube', 'videos', 'jessicasmithtv.com', 'challenges', 'about', 'five', 'months', 'now', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'try', 'DVD', '10', 'Pounds', 'Down', 'Better', 'Body', 'Blast', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'online', 'videos', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'solid', 'series', 'workouts', 'were', ""n't"", 'hard', 'joints', 'still', 'made', 'sweat', 'four', 'separate', '20', 'minute', 'segments', 'easy', 'mix', 'match', 'depending', 'what', 'type', 'exercise', ""'re"", 'looking', 'for.Cardio', 'Flow', 'was', 'surprised', 'had', 'sweating', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'done', 'minimal', 'space', 'movements', 'were', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'offer', 'options', 'make', 'things', 'tougher', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'HIIT', 'anything', 'jumping', 'jogging', 'etc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'intense', 'still', 'got', 'heart', 'pumping', 'Sole', 'Sculpt', 'did', '5', 'pound', 'weights', 'thought', 'was', 'effective', 'not', 'too', 'challenging', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same', 'tomorrow', 'morning', 'most', 'areas', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'work', 'done', 'biceps', 'most', 'seemed', 'focus', 'back', 'muscles', 'triceps', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'dumbbell', 'lot', 'website', 'choose', 'However', 'days', 'where', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'good', 'option.Core', 'stretch', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'segment', 'was', 'relaxing', 'did', 'feel', 'core', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'standing', 'yoga', 'inspired', 'abdominal', 'routines', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'standing', 'were', 'many', 'unique', 'moves', 'easier', 'actually', 'was', 'had', 'modify', 'few', 'get', 'Cardio', 'dance', 'sculpt', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'legs', 'was', 'very', 'ballet', 'inspired', 'Once', 'again', 'low', 'impact', 'found', 'sweating', 'arms', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'workout', 'am', 'used', 'using', 'weights.The', 'main', 'draw', 'DVD', 'Jessica', 'absolute', 'delight', 'drill', 'sergeant', 'instructors', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', ""'m"", 'talking', 'sweet', 'encouraging', ""n't"", 'annoy', 'mindless', 'chit', 'chat', 'feeling', 'burn', 'music', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'routine', 'scenery', 'was', 'lovely', 'not', 'distracting', 'not', 'as', 'difficult', 'Better', 'Body', 'Blast', 'more', 'intense', 'cardio', 'bursts', 'DVD', 'did', 'what', 'should', 'got', 'blood', 'pumping', 'was', 'easy', 'joints', 'gave', 'well', 'rounded', 'workout', 'did', 'routines', 'one', 'shot', 'depending', 'mood', 'level', 'soreness', 'can', 'just', 'do', 'two', 'one', ""'re"", 'short', 'time', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Jessica', 'two', 'new', 'DVDs', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'soon']",Total Body Balance DVD

I felt good when I was done. That said, her new Walking DVD, Walking for Weight Loss was my favorite. I wanted a low impact (bad knees) that would get my heart rate up. Her second segment the power walk, was terrific. I was a little disappointed after that DVD, that this cardio was less intense. Also the heavy emphasis on squats I had to modify a lot. If you have no issues with your knees, squatting is a great exercise, but I can't do it as often as she suggested. I can jog a little, walk, etc. but it was a little to top heavy in that area for me.If you want an overall exercise DVD that incorporates a little of everything, that you can break up into 20 minutes segments, this is great.
