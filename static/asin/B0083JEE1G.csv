The acting, lines and production are poorly executed. In the scene where the posse ride near an extended tree branch, you can tell this scene is looped and reused at least three times. Michael Biehn looks old and useless as a cowboy here and not the flashy gunfighter we saw in Tombstone (1997). He looks more like he had a few weeks of partying with Macauley Culkin. If you look closely, you can also see a telephone pole here and there. The film waste no time in portraying the cowboys as vile and ignorant men or the Indians as lame and mythological. Too much poetic nonsense attempting to make the Indians as all powerful spiritual beings. If these Indians were so spiritual and grounded in their beliefs, how does this journey lead them right into a burial ground after a night of chanting, dancing and smudging themselves silly? Makes no sense to me how the Indian (Spears) goes along for the ride, yet tries to warn them of going into the burial grounds, but he goes with them anyway into the forbidden grounds. The party says it would take another day and a half to go around the burial grounds, but how big could it have been to take a shorter route? Also, native actor Spears gets shot in the back, wanders off to cry and speak Lakota to the sun in some of the worst acting I've seen in a while, gets visited by his brother and then goes back to save Biehn and manages to do some killing. The worst part about Spears role is his wearing a childs size, tanktop bone breastplate. That thing is so small and goofy looking on him, did he think it was cool looking or something? Biehn's character is so lame, he gets punked out in one scene; the cowboy Cobb seems to be a double for Tombstones' Doc Holiday complete with hat and blazing pistol and in the end, the narrator states he is the last of his tribe. How original and boring is it that the trip was not about finding missing persons as it was to recover some ""yellow rock""? This was a sad and weak western.

So seeing Michael Biehn in the lead role, I was tempted to watch Yellow Rock, a tale of a tracker being asked by a group of men to help them through Indian (Blackpaw) territory to find some relatives who have gone missing... of course, all is not as it seems to be. Alas, despite some apparently deliberate box-ticking when it came to plot points and features, this effort doesn't so much belie it's low budget as do everything possible to point it out.  The photography is ok.. but there is little of interest being photographed, with `been there, seen that' locations, with nary a panoramic shot in sight.  The story is hackneyed and the screenplay requires the actors to deliver some pretty awful lines.  Maybe that's why no-one's heart seems to be in it.  It ticks boxes in terms of its sympathy for the Indians and their culture, elements of style and wardrobe very obviously borrowed from other greater Westerns, themes of greed and loyalty.. and yet it draws the line from one to the other in such a contrived way you are left constantly reminded of the fact it is a movie.  Instead of thinking `what will happen next - who will survive', you're thinking `why did the screenwriter think that was a believable line - I wonder where they hid the smoke machines in that scene..'.  The scenes themselves don't always tie together, with some odd jarring editing making you wonder if the original idea has been meddled with post filming.It's a shame, I love a good Western, and have a soft spot for Biehn as an actor..I wanted to like this.  However, it's just sloppily made, a tired effort that wheezes its way to a perfunctory climax that wasn't worth the effort.",2,Wheezy Western limps to the finishing post,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,1807,"['Westerns', 'have', 'had', 'satisfying', 'Renaissance', 'last', 'decade', 'two', 'making', 'more', 'open', 'minded', 'lower', 'budgeted', 'end', 'market', 'So', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'lead', 'role', 'was', 'tempted', 'watch', 'Yellow', 'Rock', 'tale', 'tracker', 'being', 'asked', 'group', 'men', 'help', 'Indian', 'Blackpaw', 'territory', 'find', 'relatives', 'who', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'course', 'not', 'be', 'Alas', 'apparently', 'deliberate', 'box-ticking', 'when', 'came', 'plot', 'points', 'features', 'effort', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'low', 'budget', 'do', 'everything', 'possible', 'point', 'out', 'photography', 'ok..', 'little', 'interest', 'being', 'photographed', 'been', 'there', 'seen', 'locations', 'panoramic', 'shot', 'sight', 'story', 'hackneyed', 'screenplay', 'actors', 'deliver', 'pretty', 'awful', 'lines', 'Maybe', 'why', 'no-one', 'heart', 'be', 'boxes', 'terms', 'sympathy', 'Indians', 'culture', 'elements', 'style', 'wardrobe', 'very', 'obviously', 'borrowed', 'other', 'greater', 'Westerns', 'themes', 'greed', 'loyalty..', 'yet', 'line', 'one', 'other', 'such', 'contrived', 'way', 'are', 'left', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'fact', 'movie', 'Instead', 'thinking', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'who', 'will', 'survive', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'why', 'did', 'screenwriter', 'think', 'was', 'believable', 'line', 'wonder', 'where', 'hid', 'smoke', 'machines', 'scene..', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'tie', 'together', 'odd', 'jarring', 'editing', 'making', 'wonder', 'original', 'idea', 'been', 'meddled', 'post', 'filming.It', 'shame', 'love', 'good', 'Western', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Biehn', 'actor..I', 'wanted', 'like', 'However', 'just', 'sloppily', 'made', 'tired', 'effort', 'way', 'perfunctory', 'climax', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'effort']",N/A

It is a fairly entertaining and well acted movie. I know it has some critical reviews and while some of this is deserved, I think some has been placed on the acting when it is really a fault of the directing in many places.The basic story is pretty common in western movies.  Five men including the leader Max Dietrich (James Russo), ride into the town of Yellow Rock in search of Dietrich's lost brother and his son.  They need the help of a local to guide them thru hostile territory belonging to the Black Paw indian tribe.  They enlist Tom Hanner (Biehn) and, at Tanner's insistance, Dr. Sarah Taylor (Andriel) who is friendly with the Black Paw.After receiving permission to search from the black Paw elders the initial five blatantly disregard a sacred burial ground releasing the curse of the yellow rock.  Of course things are not as they seem in the beginning and the ulterior motives are soon discovered.  As I said the acting was good, not great, but good.  the directing seemed to demand a little too much strong silent ""type"" from Michael Biehn, because he is a better actor than his offering here, not that it is bad, because it's not, it just wasn't stellar like you'd expect.  James Russo made an exceptionally good bad-guy, as always.  I thought another couple of standouts were Clay Wilcox as the clutzy killer with almost a conscience, and Christopher Backus as Cobb.  His character almost seemed to be a play on Michael Biehn's Johnny Ringo from Tombstone.  Anyway, I liked the character and the movie for that matter.  Lenore Andriel did a fine job in her role, though I did think the writing and directing surrounding her character was a little weak and that she was capable of more, as was the case with Michael Biehn's part.All told it is a very watchable western, not in the league with Tombstone, Wyatt Earp, 3:10 to Yuma, etc. but good.

There is something to be said about going into a movie blindly, so just know if you enjoy traditional Westerns, you should enjoy this one.Michael Biehn and James Russo know how to handle themselves in a Western. Michael has Tombstone on his resume, which gives him some credibility right away. He was also in the unfortunately short lived series The Magnificent Seven, which was excellent. James Russo also has more than a few Westerns to his credit, including the terrific Open Range. So, you're getting two top notch guys in Yellow Rock, which should tell you it's not the standard direct-to-DVD Western you may be fearing. This is an independent movie, and it is written/produced/directed by some newcomers. However, they did an excellent job and I hope they give us some more great Westerns in the future.The story takes place mostly in the high country, away from town, so this isn't a ""saloon brawl, town shoot-out"" kind of movie.

1545228,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B0083JEE1G,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","This Is one of those films that falls into the `must try harder' category. It is about a group of men who ride into a small, nowheresville town wanting to meet Tom Hanner, played by Michael Biehn (`Terminator', `Aliens' and more recently `The Divide'). He is an old tracker but has turned to the bottle after the premature death of his young son. They are led by Max Dietrich (James Russo `Django Unchained' and `Public Enemies'). He says his closest two relatives have gone missing whilst hunting at some place in the mountains. Problem is it is in Black Paw territory and these are ferocious Native Americans who everyone cacks their pants at the moment they see them.But Tom is the sort of man that can negotiate safe passage, so after an exchange of coin off they go. Things don't go down hill straight away but the budget limitations become very obvious when we get to the Black Paw camp there are about seven teepees and some kids playing with sticks. We also have a white doctor who lives in a nice log cabin and treats the tribe, she too gets involved with the search and they all head off for high jinx and adventure. The actual warriors don't make it to double figures either but on reflection I would make a tactical retreat if they came after me.So where does it go wrong? Well lovers of 1950's clich&eacute; schlock will say nowhere as some of the dialogue almost makes your eyes water. Some continuity and plot holes which is not an imprisonment infraction but a bit annoying and some of the acting is truly yawn inducing, but the wolves are all good. Also the editor must have phoned in his services as some of the decisions are questionable, with some scenes ending so abruptly I thought the DVD had skipped. The plot itself was also a bit of a stretch and I did say `what were they thinking?' at one point involving a burial ground.I love westerns and I love the recent resurgence but we have all seen a bad effort and so there was no need to make a new one of that ilk. It is a passable watch though and by far from being as bad as some reviews I have read (IMDB there is a 1 star review out of ten) but this is really just OK and my rating is generous, I was going for a two but I am sure there is an audience for this, so if in doubt go down the rental route.",3,Plot Holes A Plenty In the Old West,1362960000,"03 11, 2013",2013,2279,"['one', 'films', 'must', 'try', 'harder', 'category', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'ride', 'small', 'nowheresville', 'town', 'wanting', 'meet', 'Tom', 'Hanner', 'played', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'Terminator', 'Aliens', 'more', 'recently', 'Divide', 'old', 'tracker', 'turned', 'bottle', 'premature', 'death', 'young', 'son', 'are', 'led', 'Max', 'Dietrich', 'James', 'Russo', 'Django', 'Unchained', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'closest', 'two', 'relatives', 'have', 'gone', 'missing', 'whilst', 'hunting', 'place', 'mountains', 'Problem', 'Black', 'Paw', 'territory', 'are', 'ferocious', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'everyone', 'pants', 'moment', 'see', 'them.But', 'Tom', 'sort', 'man', 'can', 'negotiate', 'safe', 'passage', 'so', 'exchange', 'coin', 'go', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'straight', 'away', 'budget', 'become', 'very', 'obvious', 'when', 'get', 'Black', 'Paw', 'camp', 'are', 'seven', 'teepees', 'kids', 'playing', 'sticks', 'also', 'have', 'white', 'doctor', 'who', 'nice', 'log', 'cabin', 'tribe', 'too', 'involved', 'search', 'head', 'high', 'jinx', 'adventure', 'actual', 'warriors', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'double', 'figures', 'reflection', 'would', 'make', 'tactical', 'retreat', 'came', 'me.So', 'where', 'go', 'wrong', 'Well', 'lovers', '1950', 'clich', 'eacute', 'schlock', 'will', 'say', 'nowhere', 'dialogue', 'almost', 'eyes', 'water', 'continuity', 'plot', 'holes', 'not', 'imprisonment', 'infraction', 'bit', 'annoying', 'acting', 'truly', 'yawn', 'inducing', 'wolves', 'are', 'good', 'Also', 'editor', 'must', 'have', 'phoned', 'services', 'decisions', 'are', 'questionable', 'scenes', 'ending', 'so', 'abruptly', 'thought', 'DVD', 'had', 'skipped', 'plot', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'stretch', 'did', 'say', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'one', 'point', 'involving', 'burial', 'ground.I', 'love', 'westerns', 'love', 'recent', 'resurgence', 'have', 'seen', 'bad', 'effort', 'so', 'was', 'need', 'make', 'new', 'one', 'ilk', 'passable', 'watch', 'far', 'being', 'as', 'bad', 'reviews', 'have', 'read', 'IMDB', '1', 'star', 'review', 'ten', 'really', 'just', 'OK', 'rating', 'generous', 'was', 'going', 'two', 'am', 'sure', 'audience', 'so', 'doubt', 'go', 'down', 'rental', 'route']",N/A

When Max Dietrich's (Russo) brother and son go missing he sets out to find them. When he gets to the town of Yellow Rock he hires Tom Hanner (Biehn) to guide him to where his brother is. After meeting up with a doctor and getting permission from the tribe's elders they set out on the path to find them. Against the wishes of the indian guide with them they pass through a sacred burial ground. I'll save you the ""western genre is dead"" speech, but again this is another movie that isn't terrible but is a B-movie at best. The idea is neat and the cast actually has people that I've heard of but like most westerns lately this one is very slow moving and not really worth watching more then once. Little by little it seems like western movies are starting to get better, but at this pace it will have a full revival in the year 2067. Overall, not as bad as most of the new westerns that have been made and worth watching, but don't expect amazing. I give it a B-.",3,Better then most of the recent westerns but still a slow moving B-movie. Worth watching but not more then once.
