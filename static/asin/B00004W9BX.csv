I'm sorry, but to me, she is nothing but a canary...and not a very good one either. If you think sutherland is magnificent and can think of nothing better, boy, are you missing out on the beauty and splendor of opera. Once upon a time there were &quot;singing-actresses&quot; - sopranos who knew opera was more than just a pretty voice - Callas was one of them. Compared to Callas' dramaticism and incredible ability to convey every heart-felt emotion, Sutherland sounds like someone reading off a grocery list. Ask yourself this - is opera ONLY about hitting the high notes? Take my advice, listen to callas, and you'll never be the same again.",1,Just a pretty voice like a million others....,1034208000,"10 10, 2002",2002,749,"['Sutherland', 'was', 'time', 'very', 'famous', 'soprano', 'arguably', 'still', 'just', 'boggles', 'mind', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'nothing', 'canary', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'either', 'think', 'sutherland', 'magnificent', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'better', 'boy', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'beauty', 'splendor', 'opera', 'Once', 'time', 'were', 'quot', 'singing-actresses', 'quot', 'sopranos', 'who', 'knew', 'opera', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'voice', 'Callas', 'was', 'one', 'Compared', 'Callas', 'dramaticism', 'incredible', 'ability', 'convey', 'heart-felt', 'emotion', 'Sutherland', 'someone', 'reading', 'off', 'grocery', 'list', 'Ask', 'opera', 'ONLY', 'hitting', 'high', 'notes', 'Take', 'advice', 'listen', 'callas', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again']",N/A

Sutherland is disappointing, and she acts in a pretentious manner.  Alfredo Kraus is altogether pathetic - one can only respect him for his prior accomplishments, but why did he have to sing here?  Perhaps this is another example of what Met is serious about - big names like these make good cash flow, but these stars' days are long gone.  Met would be so much better off if they had selected younger singers who can truly sing and give the opera some degree of credibility - looking at middle aged people singing parts of teenagers or very young adults, like Lucia and Edgar, is distracting.  And for vocal pleasure, just compare this with Callas and Di Stefano recording of the same opera and the truth would emerge.  Unfortunately, this is indeed the only available DVD of this great opera and it does not give it justice at all.  Overall, the singing is mediocre at best and the acting is pitiful.  After all, bel canot may not be about acting, but the bottomline - superb singing - should be present and it wasn't.  Richard Bonynge conducting is also dull.  I could not find this production exciting at all.  For those who have never listened to Lucia, it's probably OK.  Give it a try for 26 bucks - you would have paid a fortune to attend this performance, so buying this DVD is probably not a bad deal.",2,Typical Met production,1019347200,"04 21, 2002",2002,1413,"['whole', 'production', 'so', 'typical', 'Met', 'big', 'names', 'long', 'lost', 'voice', 'made', 'famous', 'Sutherland', 'disappointing', 'pretentious', 'manner', 'Alfredo', 'Kraus', 'altogether', 'pathetic', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'respect', 'prior', 'accomplishments', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'sing', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'example', 'what', 'Met', 'serious', 'big', 'names', 'make', 'good', 'cash', 'flow', 'stars', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'Met', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'had', 'selected', 'younger', 'singers', 'who', 'can', 'truly', 'sing', 'give', 'opera', 'degree', 'credibility', 'looking', 'middle', 'aged', 'people', 'singing', 'parts', 'teenagers', 'very', 'young', 'adults', 'Lucia', 'Edgar', 'distracting', 'vocal', 'pleasure', 'just', 'compare', 'Callas', 'Di', 'Stefano', 'recording', 'same', 'opera', 'truth', 'would', 'emerge', 'Unfortunately', 'indeed', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'great', 'opera', 'not', 'give', 'justice', 'Overall', 'singing', 'mediocre', 'best', 'acting', 'pitiful', 'canot', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'acting', 'bottomline', 'superb', 'singing', 'should', 'be', 'present', 'was', ""n't"", 'Richard', 'Bonynge', 'conducting', 'also', 'dull', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'production', 'exciting', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'listened', 'Lucia', 'probably', 'OK.', 'Give', 'try', '26', 'bucks', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'fortune', 'attend', 'performance', 'so', 'buying', 'DVD', 'probably', 'not', 'bad', 'deal']",N/A

Many of these reviews commented critically on technical aspects of Ms Sutherland's performance.  I do not sing, I do not read music, but I watch many operas on DVD and attend live performances.  My major criteria is whether or not the total performance (staging, costumes, singing, etc) is emotionally and dramatically satisfying.  With this criteria I rate this DVD very highly (my wife does also; she was in tears at the end).  The DVD quality is excellent, particularly considering that it was recorded in 1982.  On a 53 inch high definition screen using a good quality upscaling DVD player, I found the images to be sharp, no pixelation, minimal to no ghosting, and great color even in the dimly lit scenes.  On rare occasion there was a bit of focus transition during zoom ins, but the out of focus period was very brief and barely noticable.  The sound was clean with reasonable fidelity.  The sound stage was minimal with most of the sound seeming to come from the center of the image.  The staging was very traditional (which for me is good).  The video director was not afraid to allow a scene to play out.  He did not do lots of quick cuts.  His reaction shots were well chosen.  A great evening at the opera.",5,Great performance,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,1316,"['find', 'impressive', 'Opera', 'DVD', '46', 'reviews', 'many', 'have', 'none', 'only', 'one', 'Many', 'reviews', 'commented', 'critically', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Ms', 'Sutherland', 'performance', 'do', 'not', 'sing', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'music', 'watch', 'many', 'operas', 'DVD', 'attend', 'live', 'performances', 'major', 'criteria', 'not', 'total', 'performance', 'staging', 'costumes', 'singing', 'etc', 'emotionally', 'dramatically', 'satisfying', 'criteria', 'rate', 'DVD', 'very', 'highly', 'wife', 'also', 'was', 'tears', 'end', 'DVD', 'quality', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'considering', 'was', 'recorded', '1982', '53', 'inch', 'high', 'definition', 'screen', 'using', 'good', 'quality', 'upscaling', 'DVD', 'player', 'found', 'images', 'be', 'sharp', 'pixelation', 'minimal', 'ghosting', 'great', 'color', 'even', 'dimly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'rare', 'occasion', 'was', 'bit', 'focus', 'transition', 'zoom', 'ins', 'out', 'focus', 'period', 'was', 'very', 'brief', 'barely', 'noticable', 'sound', 'was', 'clean', 'reasonable', 'fidelity', 'sound', 'stage', 'was', 'minimal', 'most', 'sound', 'seeming', 'come', 'center', 'image', 'staging', 'was', 'very', 'traditional', 'good', 'video', 'director', 'was', 'not', 'afraid', 'allow', 'scene', 'play', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'lots', 'quick', 'cuts', 'reaction', 'shots', 'were', 'well', 'chosen', 'great', 'evening', 'opera']",N/A

Pablo Elvira I'm afraid was very underappreciated  and this is lamentable.

Does the person who wrote this notice that he's negating the &quot;fact&quot; he's trying to prove? The Sutherland-Lucia is magnificent. (The one from 1971) But, and I work in the business, it's not the bestselling Lucia of all ages, I dare say it's far too expensive. The cheaper early Lucia with Sutherland and Cioni outsells the later performance without any problem.

Often, she sounds dramatically uninvolved and, as my friend remarks, always sounds like she was about to sneeze.Ok, enough of that.  She is awesome here. Yes, she may not be able to measure up to her recordings of the work, but she has found a new sense of drama, a fire within the music.  I much prefer Sills in this role, who really tore up the stage (or microphone, on her cd).  However, Sutherland does have quite a presence and I am utterly astonished when I hear her pluck an effortless high D at the end of the sextet.  Oh my god!  What I would give to have a high note like that AT ANY AGE!!!!!!!Here she is in her mid to late fifties doing these things.She's quite good, as is Plishka and Elvira.  I've never been a huge fan of Alfredo Kraus but, with microphone distancing, he doesn't bother me nearly as much as in his studio recordings.  Overall, I think it's a wonderful time at the opera.

Gleeson Sr.,"[145, 147]","In the mid 1960s, when The Met still made road tours, a friend and I stood to hear a young Joan Sutherland sing Lucia, so it was with high hopes that this DVD went into the player. In 1982, at the height of her talent, Dame Joan did not disappoint. Teamed with a cast that includued the sumptuous voice of Pablo Elvira as Enrico, and the elegant, poised tenor of the late Alfredo Krause as Edgardo, this Lucia overwhelms the viewer, both visually and acoustically. The conductor is Dame Joan's husband and coach, Richard Bonynge, arguably the finest conductor of bel canto opera. But the performance all comes down to Sutherland, and, for those who were not fortunate to have heard her before her retirement, this disc is overwhelming evidence of why she was referred to as ""La Stupenda""! Vocally spectacular, with a range, fluidity and temperment that makes this as close to a perfect performance as one is likely to see, Dame Joan literally brings the house down at the end of the ""mad scene"". Pioneer, once more, has demonstrated how well opera and DVD technology work together. Don't miss this disc!!ADENDUM (MARCH 2013): Back when I wrote this review, the DVD manufacturer was Pioneer. Since then DGG has reissued the performance, remastering it to add surround sound. I replaced my Pioneer disc with the DGG version and can report that the remastering is a substantial sonic improvement.

The music's good too.  It's too good.  It reminds me of Rigoletto (these are in fact my 2 favorite operas, Tosca used to be a third but I've begun to find too many empty places in it, too many periods of musical blank).  Like Lucia, every tune in Rigoletto is a winner, and the opera follows it's own evolution to its, well, as in Lucia, I'm tempted to say natural or logical conclusion.  I love both operas.  But this one.  Sutherland was wonderful.  Her singing was stunning.  Everyone was marvelous, but she was ""la stupenda,"" and she certainly earned her sobriquet in this performance.  She was so involved in the drama and the music of the mad scene that she was singing that she had difficulty coming out of it during her curtain call afterward.  In fact, it wasn't until the end of the endless ovation that she was able to come to herself and smile.  I love her.  Note:  how do the members of the chorus and singers of minor roles feel sharing the stage with greatness such as this, a greatness that they themselves will never achieve.  It's sad.  Surely they're jealous and unhappy.  Oh well.  This was a wonderful production of a wonderful opera.

554451,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004W9BX,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[82, 85]","First off, in a more perfect world we would a performance of Joan Sutherland in &quot;Luica di Lammermoor&quot; that was recorded closer to the legendary debut she made at the old Metropolitan Opera in 1961 than this November 13, 1982 performance at new Met and the 1986 version recorded at Sydney.  But unless they put out the 1977 televised performance of &quot;Lucia&quot; these are our two choices and no one is going to claim that Sutherland's voice is as good as it was a decade earlier.  But that is hardly the point.  This performance was Sutherland's first at the Met in four years and was clearly as much a celebration of the most memorable opera performance of the last half-century as anything else.  This was an audience that came fully intending to give the diva ovation after ovation, especially at the end of the famous &quot;Mad Scene,&quot; where they try to coax the soprano back up on her feet after her character has flung herself to the floor in despair.The assumption is that this production of the 301st Metropolitan Opera performance of Gaetano Donizetti's &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (Libretto by Salvatore Cammarano, based on Sir Walter Scott's novel, &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;) is something you come upon by choice.  It is not intended as an introduction to opera in general or this pivotal piece in the bel canto repertoire in particular.  The performance is subtitled in English and while there is not an enclosed Libretto there is an introduction written by Wil Crutchfield.  The story is simple and straightforward: Lucia (Sutherland) loves Edgardo (tenor Alfredo Kraus), but her brother Enrico (baritone Pablo Elvira) forces her to wed Arturo (tenor Jeffrey Stamm) to save the family fortune.  Edgardo denounces Lucia for her betrayal and on the wedding night she goes insane and kills her husband.  First Lucia and then Edgardo sing a couple of arias and drop dead.  In short, a perfect opera.From a vocal standpoint this earlier performance is the better of the two available for viewing, but clearly the Australian production is more of a love fest for Dame Joan, performing in her native land Down Under.  Ultimately, the ovations might provide more chills than the singing, but I think it is impossible not to listen to and watch this performance without thinking what it must have been like when &quot;the Voice of the Century&quot; was in her prime.  You feel rather sorry for the other principle singers because as long as Sutherland is on stage singing  that is the only thing to which you pay attention.

On our arrival back home, in the ususual English rain storm, we found this DVD waiting for us on the dining room table.  We decided to phone out for a pizza and crash out to watch this Met relay; an opera that I have to confess that we have always been very fond.Funnily enough, whilst in France we had been listening to the 1976 Chicago relay (available on a Bella Voce CD) - with Pavarotti:  in my view amongst the best Lucia's available.  So it made an interesting comparison to watch Sutherland in this 1982 relay.I am confused as to why people expected Dame Joan to be in the same wonderful voice as she was 10 to 15 years before.  What I think is amazing is that she can still sing with such flexibility and magnetism.  I thoroughly enjoyed her interpretation, even though her voice has undoubtedly lost some of it's flexibility.  The mad scene is just stupendous and I am just sorry that this version has never been available to buy in England.  Thank goodness the Met has put it out on DVD so that the British Isles can enjoy it too.Pablo Elvira is excellent as Enrico as is Paul Plishka as Raimondo.  The sextet deserves every second of the tremendous ovation it receives from the audience - luck things, I would have given my back teeth to have been there.Oh dear, I am sure I shouldn't speak ill of the dead - but my wife always describes the late Alfredo Krauss as having dead fish eyes which seem to lack emotion.  I have to say that I agree - I know I will be up setting his millions of fans aound the globe, but he doesn't move me at all.  He sings well, he acts well - but for me he doesn't have that final oomph or charisma to lift him into the great singers category.  Sorry.  What a shame the Met didn't have Pavarotti or Carreras to sing Edgardo.However, this is an excellent production - which would have sounded less pedestrian with James Levine in charge of the excellent Met orchestra. Bonynge just leaves it a touch slack - my problem always with his conducting. But it is a good document to show why the world went wild for Dame Joan back in those early days at Covent Garden.It is worth getting, even though Dame Joan has to work harder to achieve the same vocal results of her past.  We found it a very enjoyable evening, worth coming home from holiday for - and of course school tomorrow!!",4,Well worth watching.,972777600,"10 29, 2000",2000,2386,"['have', 'just', 'returned', 'home', 'week', 'Burgundy', 'family', 'arrival', 'back', 'home', 'ususual', 'English', 'rain', 'storm', 'found', 'DVD', 'waiting', 'dining', 'room', 'table', 'decided', 'phone', 'out', 'pizza', 'crash', 'watch', 'Met', 'relay', 'opera', 'have', 'confess', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'fond.Funnily', 'enough', 'whilst', 'France', 'had', 'been', 'listening', '1976', 'Chicago', 'relay', 'available', 'Bella', 'Voce', 'CD', 'Pavarotti', 'view', 'best', 'Lucia', 'available', 'made', 'interesting', 'comparison', 'watch', 'Sutherland', '1982', 'relay.I', 'am', 'confused', 'why', 'people', 'expected', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'be', 'same', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'was', '10', '15', 'years', 'before', 'What', 'think', 'amazing', 'can', 'still', 'sing', 'such', 'flexibility', 'magnetism', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'interpretation', 'even', 'voice', 'undoubtedly', 'lost', 'flexibility', 'mad', 'scene', 'just', 'stupendous', 'am', 'just', 'sorry', 'version', 'never', 'been', 'available', 'buy', 'England', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'Met', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'British', 'Isles', 'can', 'enjoy', 'too.Pablo', 'Elvira', 'excellent', 'as', 'Enrico', 'Paul', 'Plishka', 'Raimondo', 'sextet', 'second', 'tremendous', 'ovation', 'audience', 'luck', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'back', 'teeth', 'have', 'been', 'there.Oh', 'dear', 'am', 'sure', 'should', ""n't"", 'speak', 'ill', 'dead', 'wife', 'always', 'late', 'Alfredo', 'Krauss', 'having', 'dead', 'fish', 'eyes', 'seem', 'lack', 'emotion', 'have', 'say', 'agree', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'setting', 'millions', 'fans', 'globe', ""n't"", 'move', 'well', 'well', ""n't"", 'have', 'final', 'oomph', 'charisma', 'lift', 'great', 'singers', 'category', 'Sorry', 'What', 'shame', 'Met', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Pavarotti', 'Carreras', 'sing', 'Edgardo.However', 'excellent', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'sounded', 'less', 'pedestrian', 'James', 'Levine', 'charge', 'excellent', 'Met', 'orchestra', 'Bonynge', 'just', 'touch', 'slack', 'problem', 'always', 'conducting', 'good', 'document', 'show', 'why', 'world', 'went', 'wild', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'back', 'early', 'days', 'Covent', 'Garden.It', 'worth', 'getting', 'even', 'Dame', 'Joan', 'work', 'harder', 'achieve', 'same', 'vocal', 'results', 'past', 'found', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'coming', 'home', 'holiday', 'course', 'school', 'tomorrow']",N/A

It's just too bad there isn't a video documentation from her prime.The production is typical Met musty routine, with no real attempt to bring any drama at all to the performance.Bonynge leads the performance in a very careful way to help Dame Joan avoid as many vocal risks as possible.Yes, the ageless Kraus sings Edgardo and he does it well.

Nemeth,"[58, 59]","We should be thankful that the Met finally got around to preserving the greatest Lucia of our time, even if she was in the autumn of her career.  Sutherland is faulty here only by comparison with the purity and ease of her more youthful voice, available in memory to operagoers of the 60's and 70's and to owners of recordings.  One commentator in these pages wonders why the Sutherland voice is not of its earlier peerless quality after 1977. Surely, anyone who knows operatic voices is aware that the usual prime for such singers in ages 35 to 50. Sutherland's performance here, at age 56, is still amazing.  This Lucia is memorable for the diva's remarkable, indeed extraordinary elasticity and power even though she has past her prime.
