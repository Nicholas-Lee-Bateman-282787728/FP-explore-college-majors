1551809,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B008FIPPIG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","As this latest episode in the age-old battle between strippers and werewolves plays out, I think we all know who the good guys are.  Things have been quiet since the explosion of the Silvadollaz strip club back in 1984, but that all changes when one dumb brute goes all hairy during a private dance with ""Justice"" (Adele Silva) inside Vixen's.  One silver fountain pen to the eye later, a werewolf lies dead and Vixen's owner Jeanette knows that her girls and her club are in danger.  There's not a lot of good you can say about werewolves, but you can't say they aren't loyal to their pack.  Once they find out how their mate died, it's on.When these strippers signed on to dance, they knew they would have to deal with some potentially dangerous - even hairy - guys, but I'm pretty sure that werewolves were not mentioned anywhere in their contracts.  Never underestimate a stripper, though - especially Justice, as she's even able to turn a complicating and potentially disastrous complication to the girls' own advantage.  There are a few subplots that make this movie a little more interesting (strippers are people, too, you know) and there's a fair share of comedy sprinkled throughout, but in the end it's exactly what the title says - Strippers vs. Werewolves.Here's a list of things to be aware of before watching this film.  Robert Englund basically has a cameo scene and that's it; there's not much in the way of actual stripping; and the special effects (especially the werewolf makeup) aren't going to win any awards.  There's some blood and gore, but this isn't really a horror film.  It's pure camp, and you probably already know whether you're the type of person who would enjoy it.

Yes, as a matter of fact, I am kind of crazy--- crazy in love! For reals, folks. This is no laughing matter. Actually, that's not true because there's quite a bit of elicited laughter when you watch a bunch of scantily clad pole dancers blow away a pack of hairy man-beasts. But in all seriousness, this movie was one of those special rarities that caught me by surprise with how legitimately entertaining it was. Remember that time I rated a book on the awesomely bad scale? Yeah, Strippers vs Werewolves is kinda like that. It's one of those rare gems that's so terrible; it becomes, in fact, awesome. Look, don't try to fight it. It's science, people.Let me just preface the rest of this review by noting that over Thanksgiving, I was super ill. Thusly, I spent the bulk of my holiday bed-ridden and in a Nyquil/Benadryl induced haze, instantly rendering Neflix my new BFF. And being in such a drugged stupor, things like Strippers vs Werewolves starts to sound like a really good idea. And much to my Kleenex-loving delight, it was! Just know that going in, it's better to eliminate any expectations and take the movie at face value because, c'mon, the plot revolves around strippers and werewolves. Hey! They're English strippers! Naturally they're a step above their American counterparts because anyone with an English accent is, by default, classier. Anyway, the plot is as the title describes--strippers versus werewolves. More specifically, a stripper accidentally murders a werewolf so his pack decides to deliver swift justice upon them all. Only they didn't gamble on the fact that one of the stripper's boyfriends is a Van Helsing of sorts and he equips our busty ladies with some serious firepower to fight back. And you better believe they fight back in the most epic and half-naked of ways.It quickly becomes clear that director, Jonathan Glendening, knew exactly what he was doing. This movie is purposefully over-the-top, ridiculous and yet still frequently funny. The cheese factor is high but that's what endears it to my heart even more. I especially appreciated the references to the 80's classic, The Monster Squad, which was very unexpected. And for those of you with a keen eye, you'll notice an homage to other cult horror movies in there as well, which is totally cool. But, by far, the best thing about it was the cameos. I am a HUGE movie freak so when I see appearances by Robert Englund (aka Freddy Kreuger), Alan Ford (Snatch) and Lysette Anthony (Dracula: Dead and Loving It), I get really excited. Like, irrationally so. And while some may fault Glendening for his choice of old school make-up effects, this is where I give him applause. Traditional monster make-up is a dying art, one that I can still appreciate more than the overly-used, cartoonish CGI we usually see in B-list horror. Of course, the movie isn't without fault either. I think Glendening was trying too hard at times for that `artsy' sort of feeling with all the jump cuts and slow-motion, but it is what it is. Overall, it surprisingly hit the mark and exceeded my low-brow expectations. And when you're sick, you can't ask for much more than that!Food for Thought: Strippers vs Werewolves is definitely not going to win the Oscar, like ever, but it certainly maintains merit in terms of entertainment value. A comedy masked as horror, it's somewhat crass, campy and a bit fun! This movie is a crowd pleaser for those of you who can get down with movies that don't take themselves too seriously. If anything, it's fun to watch for the cameos, alone. FYI: being completely doped up on Nyquil doesn't hurt either!Rating: 3.5 Stars",3,"So Bad, It's Awesome!",1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,3718,"['Okay', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Strippers', 'Werewolves', 'Really', 'must', 'be', 'crazy', 'Yes', 'matter', 'fact', 'am', 'kind', 'crazy', 'crazy', 'love', 'reals', 'folks', 'laughing', 'matter', 'Actually', 'not', 'true', 'quite', 'bit', 'elicited', 'laughter', 'when', 'watch', 'bunch', 'scantily', 'clad', 'pole', 'dancers', 'blow', 'away', 'pack', 'hairy', 'man-beasts', 'seriousness', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'special', 'rarities', 'caught', 'surprise', 'how', 'legitimately', 'entertaining', 'was', 'Remember', 'time', 'rated', 'book', 'awesomely', 'bad', 'scale', 'Yeah', 'Strippers', 'vs', 'Werewolves', 'kinda', 'one', 'rare', 'so', 'terrible', 'fact', 'awesome', 'Look', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'fight', 'science', 'people.Let', 'just', 'preface', 'rest', 'review', 'noting', 'Thanksgiving', 'was', 'super', 'ill.', 'Thusly', 'spent', 'bulk', 'holiday', 'bed-ridden', 'Nyquil/Benadryl', 'induced', 'haze', 'instantly', 'rendering', 'Neflix', 'new', 'BFF', 'being', 'drugged', 'stupor', 'things', 'Strippers', 'vs', 'starts', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'idea', 'much', 'Kleenex-loving', 'delight', 'was', 'Just', 'know', 'going', 'better', 'eliminate', 'expectations', 'take', 'movie', 'face', 'value', ""c'mon"", 'plot', 'strippers', 'werewolves', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'English', 'strippers', 'Naturally', ""'re"", 'step', 'American', 'counterparts', 'anyone', 'English', 'accent', 'default', 'classier', 'Anyway', 'plot', 'title', 'strippers', 'versus', 'werewolves', 'More', 'specifically', 'stripper', 'accidentally', 'werewolf', 'pack', 'deliver', 'swift', 'justice', 'Only', 'did', ""n't"", 'gamble', 'fact', 'one', 'stripper', 'boyfriends', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'sorts', 'busty', 'ladies', 'serious', 'firepower', 'fight', 'back', 'better', 'believe', 'fight', 'back', 'most', 'epic', 'half-naked', 'ways.It', 'quickly', 'clear', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Glendening', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'movie', 'purposefully', 'over-the-top', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'still', 'frequently', 'funny', 'cheese', 'factor', 'high', 'what', 'heart', 'even', 'more', 'especially', 'appreciated', 'references', '80', 'classic', 'Monster', 'Squad', 'was', 'very', 'unexpected', 'keen', 'eye', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'homage', 'other', 'cult', 'horror', 'movies', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'totally', 'cool', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'was', 'cameos', 'am', 'HUGE', 'movie', 'freak', 'when', 'see', 'appearances', 'Robert', 'Englund', 'aka', 'Freddy', 'Kreuger', 'Alan', 'Ford', 'Snatch', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'Dracula', 'Dead', 'Loving', 'get', 'really', 'excited', 'irrationally', 'so', 'may', 'fault', 'Glendening', 'choice', 'old', 'school', 'make-up', 'effects', 'where', 'give', 'applause', 'Traditional', 'monster', 'make-up', 'dying', 'art', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'more', 'overly-used', 'cartoonish', 'CGI', 'usually', 'see', 'B-list', 'horror', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fault', 'think', 'Glendening', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'times', 'artsy', 'sort', 'feeling', 'jump', 'cuts', 'slow-motion', 'what', 'Overall', 'surprisingly', 'hit', 'mark', 'exceeded', 'low-brow', 'expectations', 'when', ""'re"", 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'more', 'Food', 'Thought', 'Strippers', 'vs', 'Werewolves', 'definitely', 'not', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'ever', 'certainly', 'merit', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'value', 'comedy', 'masked', 'horror', 'somewhat', 'crass', 'campy', 'bit', 'fun', 'movie', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'who', 'can', 'get', 'down', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'anything', 'fun', 'watch', 'cameos', 'alone', 'FYI', 'being', 'completely', 'doped', 'up', 'Nyquil', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'Rating', '3.5', 'Stars']",N/A
