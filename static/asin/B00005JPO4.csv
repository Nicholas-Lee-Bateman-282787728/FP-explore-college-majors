Wonderfully cast (16-year-old Emma Roberts is perfect in the lead), filled with the humor and mystery that have made Mildred Wirt Benson's books popular for four generations, the film updates Drew without sacrificing the elements that make her special.Accompanying her father (Tate Donovan...remember when HE was a teen star?) on an assignment in California, Nancy tackles the mystery behind the long disappearance and subsequent suicide of a movie queen (the ever-radiant Laura Elena Harring), while trying to adjust to the 21st century high school lifestyle (shades of ""The Brady Bunch""!). She quickly finds herself a target of some very unpleasant thugs, the bane of a grumpy caretaker (Marshall Bell), and the potential savior of the actress' previously unknown daughter (the wonderful Rachael Leigh Cook). Along with her longtime beau, Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot), she is joined in her investigation by chubby dynamo, Corky (Josh Flitter)...can even the most dastardly villain stand a chance against our spunky heroine?With wonderful support by Barry Bostwick, as a millionaire with his own agenda, the legendary Pat Carroll as a busybody Realtor, and Daniella Monet and Kelly Vitz as her high school 'competition' (and watch for a funny cameo by a certain actor named Bruce, as well!), the film never loses a sense of fun, and is perfect family entertainment.I sincerely hope there will be a sequel!",5,Delightful 'Spin' on Classic Heroine...,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1476,"['Andrew', 'Fleming', '2007', 'update', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'worth', 'cheering', 'Wonderfully', 'cast', '16-year-old', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'perfect', 'lead', 'filled', 'humor', 'mystery', 'have', 'made', 'Mildred', 'Wirt', 'Benson', 'books', 'popular', 'four', 'generations', 'film', 'Drew', 'sacrificing', 'elements', 'make', 'special.Accompanying', 'father', 'Tate', 'Donovan', 'remember', 'when', 'HE', 'was', 'teen', 'star', 'assignment', 'California', 'Nancy', 'mystery', 'long', 'disappearance', 'subsequent', 'suicide', 'movie', 'queen', 'ever-radiant', 'Laura', 'Elena', 'Harring', 'trying', 'adjust', '21st', 'century', 'high', 'school', 'lifestyle', 'shades', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'quickly', 'target', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'thugs', 'bane', 'grumpy', 'caretaker', 'Marshall', 'Bell', 'potential', 'savior', 'actress', 'previously', 'unknown', 'daughter', 'wonderful', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'longtime', 'beau', 'Ned', 'Nickerson', 'Max', 'Thieriot', 'joined', 'investigation', 'chubby', 'dynamo', 'Corky', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'can', 'even', 'most', 'dastardly', 'villain', 'stand', 'chance', 'spunky', 'heroine', 'wonderful', 'support', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'millionaire', 'own', 'agenda', 'legendary', 'Pat', 'Carroll', 'busybody', 'Realtor', 'Daniella', 'Monet', 'Kelly', 'Vitz', 'high', 'school', ""'competition"", 'watch', 'funny', 'cameo', 'certain', 'actor', 'named', 'Bruce', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'never', 'sense', 'fun', 'perfect', 'family', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'sequel']",N/A

Perhaps fans of the other movie or series may be use to that, but this was our first foray into videos for Nancy. Although we have read the books of course, this was our first look in this media. The cast did a good job, and the production values were top rate. Decent story, directing, music, and sets make it well worth seeing. At the very least I recommend this as a rental for families which may well end it purchasing it. I think young ladies will get the most from it, but this should be decent entertainment for all.The story starts with Nancy solving a series of burglaries and getting the heroes thanks from the whole town. Including a prayer from them as her father and her head to California for her dads new job. Nancy promises her dad no more sleuthing but the bug is too strong and she soon relinquishes to investingating the movie stars home they are living in now. Almost forty years earlier a film star supposedly committed suicide, but Nancy isn't so sure it was suicide. She finds out that circumstances were suspicious and she was pregnant and gave her child up for adoption. Nancy enlists some local help after a uphill battle with two fashion conscious snobbish girls and a overly enamoured twelve year old boy.

654847,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPO4,Chris Pandolfi,"[12, 31]","I needed a shot of insulin after watching ""Nancy Drew."" This movie is sickeningly sweet, from the characters to the themes to the completely contrived plot. Maybe I feel this way because I'm at a disadvantage; I've haven't read any of Carolyn Keene's original ""Nancy Drew"" books, so I have no way of knowing if this film adaptation is faithful. I can only judge it on its own terms, and I must say, it's a pretty bad film. I didn't believe the characters, the dialogue, or the mystery. I believed in the title character least of all, with her unwavering resolve, her unnaturally friendly personality, and her uncanny ability to solve dangerous mysteries with ease. Yes, I get that this is supposed to appeal to younger audiences, and yes, I get that some suspension of disbelief is required. But when a piece of cake succeeds as a bribe for medical records, I'm afraid you've lost me.Such is the reality of teenage sleuth Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts), who would rapidly exhaust every item in an etiquette book. The film opens with her catching two criminals robbing a church (one of which, incidentally, is played by Chris Kattan); after she's discovered, she gives one of them a lemon bar, displays her organized sleuthing kit, and suggests that they receive behavioral therapy. She does all this while maintaining a prim and proper attitude, always sitting up straight, always keeping a smile on her face. What part of this sounds plausible? The fact that Nancy lives in a small town shouldn't matter; I should think such areas would have smaller police forces, meaning that crimes would be especially dangerous. Nonetheless, Nancy cracks the case yet again, much to the praise of the townsfolk and the chagrin of her father, Carson (Tate Donovan).For financial reasons, the Drews must leave their all-American town and live in Los Angeles for a few months. They move into a surprisingly affordable mansion personally chosen by Nancy; it's old and creaky, the former home of an old-time Hollywood starlet. Once there, Carson forces Nancy to swear off sleuthing because he feels it's dangerous, and naturally, Nancy promises to be good. Of course, she neglects to tell him the real reason she picked that particular house: the movie star that lived there died under mysterious circumstances, and there seems to be unfinished business with the creepy groundskeeper, Leshing (Marshall Bell). As Nancy and her father settle in, she does her detective work behind his back. Considering the lengths she went to and the methods she used, I really don't understand how such a thing would be possible; at one point, clues lead her to a spa located miles away from Los Angeles. We don't know who drove her there (she does have her own car, but at this point, it's still back in her home town). We don't know how long it took her to get there. We don't know how long she stayed. The casualness of this scene was incredibly sloppy.Eventually, she meets a young woman named Jane Brighton (Rachael Leigh Cook), who may or may not be the long lost daughter of the Hollywood starlet. She also meets a lawyer (Barry Bostwick) who's currently in business talks with her father. Meeting them both proves to be dangerous on Nancy's part; she begins receiving death threats over the phone, and an SUV attempts to run her over. Yet she still pursues this case with flawless precision, as if to say that an attempt on her life is an everyday occurrence. Why the filmmakers chose to go that route, I have no idea. It isn't exactly light subject matter. But the film itself is incredibly light and airy. Could no come to a decision as to what direction the story should go in?Balancing out the mystery is Nancy's social life, or lack thereof. Her arrival in Los Angeles is a major culture shock--Nancy is portrayed as a wholesome girl of unrealistically high standards and out-of-date fashion; the teenagers of Los Angeles are portrayed as over-pampered snobs that wear designer clothes and constantly talk on cell phones. Everyone in this film was an overdone caricature, completely shallow and lacking any complexity. Two teenage girls (Daniella Monet and Kelly Vitz) become Nancy's biggest problem, and they need no further explanation. One of the girls has a twelve-year-old brother named Corky (Josh Flitter) who, for laughably dumb reasons, is already in high school. He and Nancy form a bizarre friendship: she appreciates his company; he thinks that they're boyfriend and girlfriend. His obnoxious behavior is most prominent when Nancy's true crush pays her a visit--a clingy, neurotic young man named Ned (Max Thieriot).Neither storyline knows how to properly develop the characters. All the attention seemed to go towards crafting the dead actress mystery, which, I have to admit, is somewhat engaging. The problem is that it isn't engaging enough; many details are overshadowed by personality quirks, not the least of which belong to perfect Little Miss Nancy Drew. This character is relentlessly cloying, and after about ten minutes of watching her, I had more than enough. I was tired of the perkiness. I was tired of the pluck. I was tired of the organization. ""Nancy Drew"" is a film that can only amount to empty calories, which--as we all know--should be taken in sparingly. The only audience this movie could possibly appeal to is kids, and even then, I can't imagine who would actually enjoy it. It has nothing that boys and girls can relate to. This can only mean one thing: the filmmakers didn't have a clue.",2,Without a Clue,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,5502,"['needed', 'shot', 'insulin', 'watching', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'movie',

That's why I gave this one a 5-star rating.  It was fun to see a haunted house and the variety of locations used.  A lot of adventure and ingenuity with Nancy.

The movie is faithful to her character. Nancy is a precocious, mature young teenager with an aptitude for cracking complex cases. The storyline follows a similar pattern to the books: Nancy gets engrossed in a mysterious case, she makes progress, people threaten her, she gets in trouble, etc.In this particular movie, Nancy and her dad are on business in Los Angeles. They are staying at the former mansion of the late actress Dehlia Draycott, who died under notably mysterious circumstances. Nancy is fascinated by the case and works to resolve it, getting herself and her friends in hot water in the process.If you've never read a Nancy Drew novel, then watching this movie will remind you of a Murder She Wrote episode geared toward the kids. That's what this movie is in essence (except of course that Nancy is not a writer per se).The film makers choose to portray Nancy as a girl who likes old fashioned clothes and old fashioned ways, yet she is also contemporary (she owns an ipod and has an Apple notebook).Some of her peers chide her for being out of touch with the times (think Brady Bunch Movie), but Nancy is secure with herself.I took some kids from church to the movie today, and they all enjoyed it.

Garner,"[0, 0]","Many people seem to blindly follow the lead of the critics, and to disregard any performance or interpretation that lends itself to being bigger than life. For whatever reason, the ability to portray characters who are average-or considerably less than average-is perceived as demonstrative of greater talent than the qualities you need to play a great leader, or superhero, or some idealized figure. This is the only reason I can imagine why Emma Roberts was not more heavily, and universally, lauded for her work in this movie.If she had played a pregnant high school girl, or a shoplifter, she would have received greater recognition.But there's something about the portrayal of an iconic figure, like Nancy Drew, that does not seem to merit the same attention or respect from the critics or writers.And this is patently absurd.Lots of actresses can seem authentic as trivial, or tacky, or downright trashy. But how many can bear the load that Roberts carried in this film? To portray a teenaged girl who is serious and cerebral........but still pleasant and engaging? But even THAT is more complex than it sounds, because simply being 'pleasant and engaging' is not enough. She needs to be pleasant.........but it is always 'old school', so to speak. No matter how nice she may be, there is always an element of formality, of restraint.Or, as the guy in the movie points out, 'breeding.'Something you either have or you do not.Look at the way she interacts with the other characters. For example, when she speaks with the young unwed mother, she is friendly, and goes far out of her way to help her. But as they chat in the girl's apartment, it is almost as if an invisible wall exists between them. Nancy is nice to her..........but they clearly have nothing in common, and you get the feeling from their first meeting that, once the case is solved, this will signal the end of their interaction on any close level.The same thing holds for the way she treats her little butterball friend from school. From her arrival, he was nice to her(for the most part) and she cannot help but respond with loyalty. However, she does not manipulate him the way that some attractive girls might. She does not lead him on, or act in a way he could misinterpret. Always, there is this formality, this ladylike quality, that sets her apart from typical contemporary female characters.On top of all this, Nancy Drew is depicted as being this pillar of individuality. From my observations, this is not a typical quality that you'd expect to find in any teenaged girl(or boy, for that matter). How often such people actually occur in the real world, I wouldn't hazard a guess, although I've known enough of them to know they DO exist, in one form or another.But to make that seem authentic...........To be capable of capturing the elements of which Nancy is comprised-the charm, the warmth, the antiquated sense of personal style-and to be capable of making those qualities felt, even in a sea of kids who look and behave differently........To have such a rock-solid, absolute confidence in herself.........and yet still never fall into being overly arrogant or abrasive.The fact that Roberts could make this combination seem so authentic was, for me, the strongest aspect of her performance.Roberts is possessed of an ethereal quality. Her demeanor is warm, and reassuring........and yet somewhat distant and untouchable, as well. You get the feeling that she'll do what she thinks is right. But you also get the feeling that she won't really lose any sleep over it if you don't like her. This is the combination you pretty much have to have to display any integrity at all.Nancy does what she does because of who SHE is. Not because of how she expects to be perceived by those around her. This is the very personification of strength.Emma Roberts carries this film. The pop culture landscape is littered with actresses in her age group, and it is hard for one to really stand out. But she truly made this role her own. I hope that she reprises it someday. She took an iconic character,offered that character a suitably epic interpretation, but all the while placing her own indelible stamp upon the role.

654857,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPO4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","Man, I am just wondering how many Man points I lose by admitting that I actually used to read Nancy Drew and Trixie Belden mysteries when I was a kid, these being an offshoot of reading pretty much all the Hardy Boys and the Three Investigators books. But a bit of back history: Nancy Drew's been around for over 75 years, having debuted way back in 1930 in THE SECRET OF THE OLD CLOCK by ""Carolyn Keene"" (actually a pseudonym for a gang of writers). This isn't the first time that Nancy's been on the big screen. The late '30s had actress Bonita Granville starring in four Nancy Drew flicks. Then, of course, in the late '70s, Pamela Sue Martin played her on television, and it sort of blew my mind when her Nancy Drew got to hung out with the Hardy Boys (The Hardy Boys Nancy Drew Mysteries: Season Two). I think there was another film a few years ago, as well as a very short lived TV series in the '90s (Nancy Drew (1995) - The Complete First Season (Boxset)), but I haven't seen either of those.Okay, about this movie: Nancy Drew isn't like most girls. She lives in the tiny, squeaky-clean Midwestern town of River Heights, where it seems like the 1950s have hung around. Nancy's inquisitive nature has made her into the town sleuth and she's surprisingly well regarded by the River Heights authorities, whose thunder she habitually steals. But her world is upended when she and her lawyer dad relocate temporarily to Los Angeles. Nancy happens to be clever, super polite, uber-organized, and she sports retro sensibilities (""I like old-fashioned things,"" she declares). It's only naturally that she has a hard time fitting in the big metropolis and into her new school in L.A.After her last escapade, Nancy's concerned dad had wrung a promise from her to stop sleuthing. But, c'mon, now. Charged with picking out their place of residence in L.A., is it really a surprise that Nancy sets her eyes on a mansion oozing with mystery? Things start out simply enough as Nancy explores the past (and shocking demise) of the mansion's former inhabitant, a once famous film actress. But if you know your Nancy Drew, then you figure it's only a matter of time before she gets deep into doodoo. Nancy Drew plus skullduggery plus attempts on our heroine's life? That's just par for the course, brother.The mystery's okay (revolving around a long missing will), but, for me, the fun stuff crops up whenever we see Nancy's prim & proper, small town sensibilities juxtaposed against L.A.'s big heap of attitude, hipness, and blas&eacute;. An example: In the course of her investigations, Nancy ends up on a movie set where, because of her wardrobe, she gets mistaken for an extra in a '50s film (which, by the way, is when we see Bruce Willis's cameo as himself). Then there's what happens when her ""friends"" take her to a high-fashioned clothing store for a makeover...I dig that Nancy's well-mannered and so unflappable, even when the kids at her new school prank her or when she discovers that the big time L.A. cops, unlike the local constabulary back home, aren't about to be at her beck and call (she reports to LAPD that her moccasin slippers were stolen and gets laughed at for her trouble). But I also dig that Emma Roberts is a good enough actress that you sense her character's vulnerability. This film relocates Nancy Drew to today's contemporary climate, which means that the cool L.A. kids get to scope out Nancy in her retro clothes and penny loafers. They note her over-achieving ways and her fastidiousness. And they consign her to freak status. Initially, only an annoying chubby 12-year-old kid would hang out with her. Of course Nancy wins the kids over, but it helps that her cute hometown non-boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, stops by for a visit and, also, that she's handy with the tracheotomy.Much like Amy Adams inEnchanted (Widescreen Edition), Emma Roberts makes the film work by playing it straight, without a trace of irony or a wink at the audience. And, so, I bought into her admittedly eccentric character. I think it's a tricky role to pull off, because, for one thing, Nancy Drew doesn't have much of a sense of humor, so she can't endear herself by cracking jokes. Also she does have a bit of that junior Martha Stewart vibe going, which could've turned off some folks. Instead, she becomes endearing by virtue of her falling into fish-out-of-water predicaments, by her pluck and resourcefulness and kindness, and by the fact that the charming Emma Roberts invests her role with warmth and sincerity. Also, her Nash Rambler convertible is awfully keen.So is this the same Nancy Drew I grew up reading about? No, not really.

There is nothing right with this movie.  Nancy Drew was a tenacious, persistent minded amateur sleuth who was an innocent.  In this film she's a Hollywood type ditz who doesn't seem as innocent as she is bratty and spoiled more pushy than persistent.  The screenplay does injustice to anything in the books, and certainly fails to compete with any of its forerunners. Compared to Emma Roberts portrayal of Nancy, Pamela Sue Martin is a three time Academy Award winner and she was just passing in the role. The only Mystery in this motion picture is why it was put on film in the first place.  It shouldn't be put on tape and would surely be a waste of a perfectly good blank DVD.I also bought a copy of the Bonita Granville series of Nancy Drew movies.  What a difference.  Good, if not great, acting.  Well written scripts;  Bonita Granville portrayed Nancy perfectly.  Please don't tell me that the image of Nancy had to be updated for today's viewers.  It wasn't necessary for Tom Sawyer, Moby Dick, Mary Poppins, or Sherlock Holmes.  Nancy Drew was a girl of her times from a small town of those times.  Make a new movie in color and Cinemascope if you will, but keep the characters in the 1930's, 40's, or even the 50's.  The small towns of those years are gone and so is the innocence of those children (thanks to mass media.)If the character must be updated, do it with thought. Drop the innocent and introduce the stupid (comedy/parody), the educated(outsmarting the pros), the wily (out foxing dad), or the older Nancy Drew (the drama). Just don't try to redo the original girl in today's sophisticated, savvy society, that rocket won't fly.  Save this DVD for the dimwits who wouldn't know a good movie if they were in it.

Nancy as seen here prefers to dress like a young girl from the 1940's and 50's (""I like old-fashioned things"") and has the polite manners of that era, too, which will likely make older viewers sigh with nostalgia.With her retro ways and her sometimes over-the-top crimefighting skills (Nancy actually carries a grappling hook to descend from roofs), initially one wonders if we should be laughing at Nancy along with her teen peers.  But, no, like those other characters, we soon fall into the ""we should respect others even if they're a little different"" vibe that the movie enthusiastically gives off before too long.Once we're used to her eccentricities, Nancy comes off as a charming, likable character, and one we care about as she takes on a somewhat dangerous mystery.  Things never get too scary, though.  In fact, the operative adjective to describe the movie is ""nice"".  It's a cute, fun, nice little movie that will show you a pleasant time for an hour and thirty-five minutes.  Whether one should point out that ""Nancy Drew"" might have done better at the box office if it had slightly bigger ambitions than simply being ""nice"" (and thus maybe generated a sequel) is another question, of course.The standard DVD of ""Nancy Drew"" looks and sounds great, and there are a variety of mostly kid-oriented special features to round out the proceedings.",3,"Good for kids and pre-teens, painless for adults",1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,1606,"['conceit', '2007', 'update/reboot', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'franchise', 'decades', 'included', 'books', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'probably', 'other', 'offerings', ""'m"", 'unaware', 'everything', 'Nancy', 'world', 'been', 'updated', 'Nancy', 'Nancy', 'seen', 'here', 'prefers', 'dress', 'young', 'girl', '1940', '50', 'like', 'old-fashioned', 'things', 'polite', 'manners', 'era', 'too', 'will', 'likely', 'make', 'older', 'viewers', 'sigh', 'nostalgia.With', 'retro', 'ways', 'sometimes', 'over-the-top', 'crimefighting', 'skills', 'Nancy', 'actually', 'grappling', 'hook', 'descend', 'roofs', 'initially', 'one', 'wonders', 'should', 'be', 'laughing', 'Nancy', 'teen', 'peers', 'other', 'characters', 'soon', 'fall', 'should', 'respect', 'others', 'even', ""'re"", 'little', 'different', 'vibe', 'movie', 'enthusiastically', 'off', 'too', 'long.Once', ""'re"", 'used', 'eccentricities', 'Nancy', 'off', 'charming', 'likable', 'character', 'one', 'care', 'somewhat', 'dangerous', 'mystery', 'Things', 'never', 'get', 'too', 'scary', 'though', 'fact', 'operative', 'adjective', 'describe', 'movie', 'nice', 'cute', 'fun', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', 'will', 'show', 'pleasant', 'time', 'hour', 'thirty-five', 'minutes', 'one', 'should', 'point', 'out', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'slightly', 'bigger', 'ambitions', 'simply', 'being', 'nice', 'thus', 'maybe', 'generated', 'sequel', 'question', 'course.The', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'great', 'are', 'variety', 'mostly', 'kid-oriented', 'special', 'features', 'round', 'out', 'proceedings']",N/A

Thus tested by the oddballs of the Golden State, much like the original Nancy was forced to deal with California crime in THE MYSTERY OF THE FIRE DRAGON, she returns home to Hannah Gruen's good home cooking and to her chums Bess Marvin and George Fayne.  However, viewers with long memories will glow with delight when they watch the saga of the murdered movie star, Delia Draycott, a thinly disguised version of Laura Elena Harring's turn as ""Rita"" in the David Lynch movie.  Director Andrew Fleming spared no expense in his homage to Lynch, even going so far as to hire the lovely Rita herself.  The plot such as it is, rebounds with Lynchian mirrorings and twinships (former starlet Rachael Leigh Cook appears as a girl who may or may not share DNA with the long-gone Rita, who appears only in flashbacks), while Nancy Drew tries desperately to keep Cook's daughter from being deported by the state.It's never easy for a love-addicted genre star to find happiness with the right man on Mulholland Dr.  Delia Draycott made one wrong turning too many, and Andrew Fleming digs out all the right notes of compassion under the tinsel.",5,Tribute to David Lynch,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,1786,"['NANCY', 'DREW', 'perfect', 'film', 'kids', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'too', 'especially', 'who', 'rate', 'David', 'Lynch', 'MULHOLLAND', 'DRIVE', 'highly', 'want', 'see', 'remade', 'different', 'angle.On', 'surface', 'story', 'one', 'fish', 'water', 'scenarios', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'plucked', 'pleasant', 'tiny', 'River', 'Heights', 'enrolled', 'ritzy', 'snobby', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'school', 'ways', 'make', 'freak.With', 'help', 'heartthrob', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'home', 'Ned', 'Nickerson', 'Nancy', 'social', 'world', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'criminal', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'solving', 'crime', 'happened', 'right', 'rented', 'mansion', 'Carson', 'Drew', 'renting', 'Thus', 'tested', 'oddballs', 'Golden', 'State', 'much', 'original', 'Nancy', 'was', 'forced', 'deal', 'California', 'crime', 'MYSTERY', 'THE', 'FIRE', 'DRAGON', 'home', 'Hannah', 'Gruen', 'good', 'home', 'cooking', 'chums', 'Bess', 'Marvin', 'George', 'Fayne', 'However', 'viewers', 'long', 'memories', 'will', 'glow', 'delight', 'when', 'watch', 'saga', 'murdered', 'movie', 'star', 'Delia', 'Draycott', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'version', 'Laura', 'Elena', 'Harring', 'turn', 'Rita', 'David', 'Lynch', 'movie', 'Director', 'Andrew', 'Fleming', 'spared', 'expense', 'homage', 'Lynch', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'hire', 'lovely', 'Rita', 'plot', 'such', 'Lynchian', 'mirrorings', 'twinships', 'former', 'starlet', 'Rachael', 'Leigh', 'Cook', 'girl', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'share', 'long-gone', 'Rita', 'who', 'only', 'flashbacks', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'desperately', 'keep', 'Cook', 'daughter', 'being', 'deported', 'state.It', 'never', 'easy', 'love-addicted', 'genre', 'star', 'find', 'happiness', 'right', 'man', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'Delia', 'Draycott', 'made', 'one', 'wrong', 'turning', 'too', 'many', 'Andrew', 'Fleming', 'out', 'right', 'notes', 'compassion', 'tinsel']",N/A

And, thanks to her detective kit, she's ready for anything.Her dad, lawyer Carson (Tate Donovan), has a temporary assignment in Los Angeles, and the teenager gets to go along.  In fact, Carson let her pick out the house they are renting.  Naturally, Nancy picked one with a mystery.  Seems 25 years ago, actress Dehlia Draycott disappeared for five months.  Then, just a few days after she came back, she was found dead in her pool.  Her murder was never solved.Unfortunately, just before the trip, Carson makes Nancy promise to stop sleuthing.  And Nancy really does try to live up to her word.  But when she begins stumbling on clues to what happened in the past, she just can't stop thinking about them.  Where will the trail lead?  Will Nancy solve the old crime?  Or will she keep her word to her father and work toward becoming a normal teen?Warning:  The following paragraph was written by an obsessive book person.  Let's start by getting some stuff of my chest.  Why were Bess and George reduced to cameos?  They are an important part of the books.  The fact that Nancy's housekeeper Hannah only had a cameo didn't bother me too much since she often got little more then that in the books.  At least Ned (Max Thieriot) got a bit more of a role, showing up on Los Angeles for a while.  And, I did enjoy seeing Nancy's car (a roadster).  I just wish they had included those other characters more.Okay, now we can review this movie as it is.And it's a surprisingly decent movie.  The mystery is well done with plenty of clues being dropped along the way.  I figured a couple things out before Nancy, but only a few minutes before.  The plot and danger was perfectly in keeping with the things Nancy faced in the books, so fans of the series will know what to expect.The movie did provide plenty of laughs along with the danger.  Nancy views the world differently then everyone else, and many of the laughs are at this culture clash.  In fact, my only real complaint is the uneven tone they use with Nancy.  Most of the time, the movie sets her up as someone to look up to.  Occasionally, her character is the butt of the joke, however.  That unevenness was weird for me.  Granted, her character is ripe for parodying; I just wish the movie could have decided whether it was going to mock or praise her.There's also a plot point that bothers me.  Just how long were Nancy and Carson in Los Angeles?  It seemed like only three weeks or so, yet Nancy was enrolled in school.  It seemed like more trouble then it was worth.  But that's a minor pointNot surprisingly, this movie aims at pre-teen girls, the usual reader of the books.  With a bit of light romance with Ned (they're just friends at the beginning) and some fun with fashion, I think they will love it.Yes, I have some quibbles, but the movie is basically good.

When I got a little bit older, you were allowed to take out 12 books at a time. Which was just heaven for me! And yes, I used to take out 12 books at a time, and return them on time, if not before time. They were normally Babysitters Club, Sweet Valley High and occasionally Nancy Drew books. But my library never had that many Nancy Drew books, and if they did have them, it was only a couple and then the books that also featured the Hardy Boys.When I found out there was a movie version of Nancy Drew coming out, I was apprehensive. From my memories of Nancy Drew, I didn't think there could be such a film. It just didn't work in my head.And upon viewing? It was nonsense. Yes, they got the look of Nancy Drew practically spot on, but there was something magical missing. The supporting cast, with the exception of Tate Donovan, were average. The actor who played Ned, was too much of a pretty boy, and the comedy came from the actor who played Corky.With films like High School Musical and Hannah Montana TV shows out there, Nancy Drew simply doesn't cut it. To be memorable, to make money, or to entice the kids away from HSM. It's pretty boring in fact. I know, I'm not the target audience, therefore, I should not be watching this, but I was intrigued by the idea.There's a pointless cameo from Bruce Willis (uncredited) and Adam Goldberg, which has nothing really to do with the rest of the movie.Maybe because I'm not (or wasn't) an avid reader of the books, I don't enjoy this movie as much as I should. Or maybe it's because movies like HSM and Bratz stick in my mind. Or maybe if I was 15 years younger, I would have enjoyed it better. (Does that make me sound old?) I wouldn't recommend Nancy Drew, only to readers of the books, young or old. Now where's the rest of my Sweet Valley High TV shows?",2,Guess what?

654876,A1U360OMVQRPUB,B00005JPO4,Mel Odom,"[10, 11]","Nancy Drew is one of those iconic heroes kids who read tend to grow up with.  I know I shared several of her adventures (read on the sly because I'm a guy) when I was younger.  I read the Hardy Boys out in the public eye, along with the adventures of Tom Swift, Jr., Ken Holt, and Rick Brant.But Nancy's adventures were always somehow more mysterious and more fun.  They concentrated on the twists and the turns of the mystery, and the secrets of the suspects that Nancy had to ferret out.  Although created by the Edward Stratemeyer Syndicate (as were the Hardy Boys, the Rover Boys, Tom Swift, Sr. and Jr., and the Dana Girls), most of Nancy's adventures were penned by Mildred Wirt Benson.  Benson wrote some of the best Nancy Drew mysteries ever printed (23 of the first 25).The first books came out in 1930, and movies swiftly followed due to public familiarity and interest in seeing the character on the big screen.  Four Nancy Drew movies appeared in the late 1930s.  In the 1970s, a television series starring Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew came out.  THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES became a hit and ran from 1977 to 1979.  Television tried Nancy Drew as a series again in 1995, and a made-for-tv movie with Nancy in college came out in 2002.Nancy Drew remains a solid sales force in video games.  Based on her book adventures, the video games offer players a chance to point and click clues to solve mysteries.  So far, 19 video games have come out from Her Interactive Inc.  A new game was also made for the Nintendo DS game system.Making a new movie about Nancy Drew seems almost a no-brainer.  Warner Bros., the original studio that made Nancy Drew movies, returned to bring the new movie to life.Directed by Andrew Fleming, the film is a delight for family night.  Instead of having Nancy in her element in her hometown, she's thrown into wild and wooly Los Angeles where she's a fish out of water.  She keeps a lot of the old-fashioned sense and sensibility from the original series, which makes her seem like a goof in modern times, and I have to admit that I wasn't entirely won over by the treatment.  In fact, if it hadn't been for the sheer likeability of young Emma Roberts (father Eric Roberts and aunt Julia), I wouldn't have bought into the representation of Nancy.What I ultimately ended up doing is filing away my preconceived imaginings of Nancy Drew and embracing this version.  I no longer thought of her as the Nancy Drew I grew up with, but more like a granddaughter of the original series heroine who hasn't quite come into her own yet.The Nancy Drew in this film isn't quite finished, but I loved the pluck and drive of Miss Roberts's presentation and thought she was fabulous.There's actually a lot going on in the film.  I think that too much of it actually extends beyond the scope of the mystery and that made the personal plots as well as the crime solving fall apart at times.  We see that Nancy is an overachiever and that she doesn't fit in with the L. A. girls, but that subplot kind of staggers along till it solves itself (with the arrival of Ned Nickerson - Max Thieriot).  Likewise, the mystery gets torn up by Nancy's efforts to be ""normal"" and make her dad happy.I would have preferred the movie focus on the mystery and the subplots to have branched out of that.  Still, there were comedic moments provided by those subplots that were enjoyable and made the film move quickly.Since Nancy got to pick the house that she and her father live at while in L. A., she chose one with a mystery.  A Hollywood actress went missing for five months and was later, after her return, found dead in her pool while at her party.  The murder was never solved, and that draws Nancy's sleuth senses into overdrive.I liked the mysterious clues, the secret passageways, and the riddles and clues that eventually lead Nancy to the solution of the murder.  The film contains enough narrow escapes, chases, and threatening phone calls to keep every young detective (and mystery-loving parents) interested.Josh Flitter plays Corky, a pre-adolescent would-be rapper Lothario that absolutely steals the show at times.  He was one of the primary ingredients that kept reminding me this was not the Nancy Drew I grew up with, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud at his antics.  His sense of timing and delivery is awesome, and I've just found out he's going to be in the starring role of ACE VENTURA, JR.Bruce Willis has an uncredited cameo in the film that's funny to watch.  But, again, it's one of those things that really detracts from the overall mystery.  Nancy's adventures in the novels, especially the early ones, focused tightly on the pursuit of the solution.My ten year old had seen Nancy Drew books in the school library, but we haven't read any of them yet.  The movie hooked him and he sat with his mom and me to watch the whole film.  He had a blast, so I can recommend this film to parents with kids wholeheartedly because he can be a tough audience.I had a great time with NANCY DREW, and I think Emma Roberts will win over readers familiar with the teen detective in spite of the differences and escalated humor, and make new fans of kids that haven't ever seen Nancy in action before.The special features on the disc are skinny, but worth watching.

Most of the time this is a bad thing but on occasion it is a good thing; typically thanks to some little detail of the production that creates an unexpected synergy between the other elements. For example, in ""The Clique"" (2008), an especially good costume designer decorates each scene with a creativity that transforms a teen movie into a visual homage of its source novel series.This same accidental homage to its literary source series occurs in ""Nancy Drew"" (2007); in this case because Emma Roberts (as the title character) unexpectedly transcends the intended parody; effortlessly selling the heroine she is playing. The film's original intention was to work on two levels; to give its middle school target audience an entertaining mystery film while subtly poking fun at its wrapped too tight traditional heroine. Much like ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" (1995) there would be some viewers who got it on this second level.But Roberts throws a monkey wrench into the works with a Winona Ryder type straight performance which adds a third dimension to the production. Even those laughing the loudest at the parody elements (which are not as extreme as those in ""The Brady Bunch Movie"") will find it hard to not identify with her character.Roberts' Nancy is the real thing. This is not Bonita Granville's ""Nancy"" who owed more to the heroines of 1930's screwball comedies than to her literary counterpart. Which is not to disparage those four very entertaining films, but to simply note that readers finally get to watch the heroine that they know; even if it is in a more contemporary environment.Then again, what do I know?

Many girls in our schools today are forced to be loud, raunchy, dress older than their age, and act like one of the boys.

Nancy's world is rapt with fascination for the hunt, reflection upon complex clues, and determination to catch the bad guy(s), all while trying to make that world a better place.  In the end, Nancy solves the murder, makes new friends all around, and shows how persistence and positive attitude always accomplishes good.This is a fun safe flick!  There is no foul language, no nudity, and no provocative innuendo.  The teenage romance (between Nancy and boyfriend Ned) is innocent sporting only a brief kiss during the final scene.  (Kudos to Bruce Willis for a cameo in this wholesome film.)This screenplay depicts an interesting mystery that an innovative teenager with imagination and courage solves.

With her father in town on a long-term business trip, Nancy decides to apply her skills to the fabled case of a Hollywood star who committed suicide shortly after returning from a mysterious, months-long disappearance.  With her youthful energy, encyclopedic (not wiki-pedic) memory, and a crime-fighting kit that includes grappling hooks, a tin of coffeecake that never empties, and some Apple electronics, Nancy is poised to solve a case that eluded a generations worth of entertainment journalists (and presumably some genuine detectives who could have really solved the mystery).This was a decent movie, not a great one.  Maybe it's the start of a franchise and just wanted to find its way and test its star before they sprang for decent writers and a script to match.  The mystery is thin and packs all the enigma you'd get from an episode of Scooby-Doo, with convenient clues that discover themselves.  The real mystery is Nancy herself, whose superhuman adult sense of neatness and attention to detail that makes her a natural target for the other girls her age.  The story never decently integrates the mystery with the running ""Little Nancy in big-bad LA"" nor gives its young characters anything better than awkward dialog obviously written by adults.  Still Emma Roberts packs enough youthful verve to keep the story going while laying enough ground for the inevitable sequel.",3,Emma Roberts saves this decent family flick that may lead to a better sequel.,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,1489,"['Nancy', 'Drew', 'pint-sized', 'teenage', 'crime', 'buster', 'decides', 'bring', 'taste', 'cracking', 'crime', 'LA', 'father', 'town', 'long-term', 'business', 'trip', 'Nancy', 'apply', 'skills', 'fabled', 'case', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'shortly', 'returning', 'mysterious', 'months-long', 'disappearance', 'youthful', 'energy', 'encyclopedic', 'not', 'wiki-pedic', 'memory', 'crime-fighting', 'kit', 'grappling', 'hooks', 'tin', 'coffeecake', 'never', 'Apple', 'electronics', 'Nancy', 'poised', 'solve', 'case', 'eluded', 'generations', 'entertainment', 'journalists', 'presumably', 'genuine', 'detectives', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'solved', 'mystery', '.This', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'Maybe', 'start', 'franchise', 'just', 'wanted', 'find', 'way', 'test', 'star', 'sprang', 'decent', 'writers', 'script', 'match', 'mystery', 'thin', 'enigma', ""'d"", 'get', 'episode', 'Scooby-Doo', 'convenient', 'clues', 'discover', 'real', 'mystery', 'Nancy', 'superhuman', 'adult', 'sense', 'neatness', 'attention', 'detail', 'natural', 'target', 'other', 'girls', 'age', 'story', 'never', 'decently', 'mystery', 'running', 'Little', 'Nancy', 'big-bad', 'LA', 'young', 'characters', 'anything', 'better', 'awkward', 'obviously', 'written', 'adults', 'Still', 'Emma', 'Roberts', 'enough', 'youthful', 'verve', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'laying', 'enough', 'ground', 'inevitable', 'sequel']",N/A

However,this is true of many other recent films that I watched and enjoyed like X-Men, 300, Batman, Superman, and even ""The Rise of the Silver Surfer"", but Nancy Drew didn't make the grade as far as I am concerned.  It might appeal to the 8 to 10 year old crowd but I doubt it.  In an obvious effort to keep the budget to a minimum the film is set -- where else -- Los Angeles.  Instead of keeping Nancy in her proper time frame (1930 to 1950)the producers elected to drop her into a modern LA thereby saving more money.  The result instead of being campy-funny came across as campy-snide, because the screen writer and director clearly shared the common view in LA that anyone not living there or on the East Coast is dumb, backward, unsophisticated, definitely unhip, and thus an object of fun and derision. So both Ned and Nancy are portrayed as dorks who are totally unhip and objects of ridicule. In order to add interest the screen play introduces an unlikely and even dorkier side-kick ""Corky"" whose only purpose seemed to be to add humor, but not much of that.  Corky did give Max Theriot (Ned) the opportunity to deliver the best line of the movie when he referred to him as ""porky"".  In fact, this film would have been greatly improved with less Corky and more Ned.  Theriot actually provided the best acting job in the movie as he displays his 17 year old jealousy with body language and expression -- very well done.  The screen play introduced the two high style Valley Girls who added little beyond highlighting how unhip Nancy is.  Of course there was the obligatory car chase and crash, which characterizes modern cinema, but a car chase at osted speed limits.  This was a missed opportunity for some fun between Ned and Nancy and the screen writer squandered this opportunity as did the director.The Nancy Drew character was true to her roots but by stinting on the budget she became a figure of ridicule and even more unrealistic than the original.  This could have been a cute movie but instead it turned out to be slow, snide, and rather dull -- too adult for young kids but too immature for most adults.I gave it three stars because Nancy and Ned did a good job with weak material.
