1660685,A365JD8TP0V7IK,B00DRDRB86,Aprily,"[1, 5]","What makes this movie really WEIRD is that everything about it screams pg13 made for tv  movie, but they have random things thrown in like breasts, sexy girl putting on her stockings, and the main girl trying to show the guy an adult magazine and then talking about the girl she is looking at. Those scenes don't fit into the rest of the movie. It's so weird. I'm fine with nudity or any of those other things, but I just feel awkward seeing it in this movie because it's such a safe pg13 movie other than those parts. I don't understand why those things are in this movie. It just makes it bad. Other than those things the movie is decent to watch. Nothing amazing, but not terrible. Though I do have to admit I didn't watch it until the end. I did get a bit hungry and went to make lunch while it played so I'm not sure how it ended.",2,NUDITY!,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,835,"['What', 'movie', 'really', 'WEIRD', 'everything', 'pg13', 'made', 'tv', 'movie', 'have', 'random', 'things', 'thrown', 'like', 'breasts', 'sexy', 'girl', 'putting', 'stockings', 'main', 'girl', 'trying', 'show', 'guy', 'adult', 'magazine', 'then', 'talking', 'girl', 'looking', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'rest', 'movie', 'so', 'weird', ""'m"", 'fine', 'nudity', 'other', 'things', 'just', 'feel', 'awkward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'such', 'safe', 'pg13', 'movie', 'other', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'movie', 'just', 'bad', 'Other', 'things', 'movie', 'decent', 'watch', 'Nothing', 'amazing', 'not', 'terrible', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'end', 'did', 'get', 'bit', 'hungry', 'went', 'make', 'lunch', 'played', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'ended']",Treasure Guards

I went to click past and ended up accidentally buying it instead. I kept and watched it because it did have a couple of sure things going for it in my book: archeology and Raoul Bova. It turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining movie!It may not be art for the ages, but it has action, adventure, intrigue, romance and a few laughs.  The cast is excellent and they all do a good job, making the story a bit better than perhaps the script deserves.This may not have the budget and cast of a summer blockbuster, but for those who like the genre it's a good find.

Def a good movie, and if you can handle ONLY ONE scene with a woman's breasts in the very beginning, then this movie fully deserved it's PG-13 rating.

While on a dig archaeologist Victoria Carter discovers an ancient parchment that tells the location of the lost Seal Of Solomon with God gave to King Solomon. When word of this gets out more then just Victoria begin to search for it. The search becomes a battle between good and evil. I am a huge fan of movies like this. Indiana Jones, National Treasure and the Da Vinci Code movies are so much fun to watch over and over so I was looking forward to this. The beginning started off OK and made me interested. The longer the movie went on though it started to drag and lose me a little, the end was OK but really this wasn't as exciting and interesting as I was hoping for. I would compare this movie more to the Libraian series then the other big budget ones like this, but seeing as they are both TV movies you can't fault it for that. Overall, an OK movie on it's own as long as you don't compare it to the big budget ones. I give it a C+.",3,A treasure hunting movie that was OK but not as much fun to watch as the National Treasure series. Not bad for TV.

1660693,ADWSD45P3NZGU,B00DRDRB86,WakkyWabbit,"[1, 1]","Treasure Guards is an adventure movie. Similar to Allan Quartermain or The Librarian.A Vatican Treasure Guard, and his sidekick brother, team up with a female archaeologist to find the lost Seal of Solomon, his ring and a big stash of diamonds. They jet all over the world, hunting down clues and artifacts, deciphering codes and dealing with bad guys.Although not a super big budget movie, it certainly not a low budget B movie. The characters are likable, it's somewhat fast paced and the storyline flows well. The actors do a fine job.Family friendly: For the most part. In the beginning, there is a brief shower scene that shows breasts and another scene with a man in just his underwear. Other than that, you are pretty safe. A few people get killed, but violence is not major.I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. I had never heard of the movie nor the actors but I took a chance and I never once considered ending it early. In fact I may watch it again.
