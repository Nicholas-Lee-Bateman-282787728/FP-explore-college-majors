The season ends with many questions as the show was not renewed but I found the show very enjoyable and really wanted to know what was coming next for most of the characters.  Well written and directed I think Luck will be kind of a &#34;Cult Classic&#34; as far as this new television renaissance that has recently taken place is concerned.  I am sure it will vanish from the public eye for a while but I do believe that time will be kind to this unique show.  Not for everyone and the show moves at its own pace but if you are okay with that, the buildup and being a fly on the wall in this world is a fun ride.",5,I really liked this show,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,727,"['really', 'liked', 'show', 'Took', 'time', 'developed', 'characters', 'then', 'often', 'turned', 'characters', 'around', 'season', 'many', 'questions', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'renewed', 'found', 'show', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'really', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'next', 'most', 'characters', 'Well', 'written', 'directed', 'think', 'Luck', 'will', 'be', 'kind', '34', 'Cult', 'Classic', '34', 'as', 'far', 'new', 'television', 'renaissance', 'recently', 'taken', 'place', 'concerned', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'vanish', 'public', 'eye', 'while', 'do', 'believe', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'kind', 'unique', 'show', 'Not', 'everyone', 'show', 'own', 'pace', 'are', 'okay', 'buildup', 'being', 'fly', 'wall', 'world', 'fun', 'ride']",N/A

I unfortunately never gained insight into Dustin Hoffman's character.  After the first bad injury to a  horse, I had to turn the sound off during the race scenes due to anxiety that something else bad was going to happen to another horse.  But as the show went on, I like the show better.  I already knew there was only one season due to the number of injuries to the horses.  But I was almost addicted to it by the time it was over and wanted to know what happened to the trainer and the vet, what was really going on with the cartel and were those guys in the motel ever going to move on in life.

1576579,A29PRUAD8RK2WX,B008V90TZI,Buffalohump,"[4, 7]","I was tremendously excited by the prospect of this show, like many others I am sure. I won't go through all the details of who was behind the production, as it is comprehensively covered in other reviews here. Suffice to say it was a tragedy that this show was cancelled as it had great potential to run and run (excuse the pun) and of course there was a tremendous amount of talent on tap, with some of the most capable character actors working today and a fantastic script all lined up. Not to mention absolutely beautiful horses. It held huge promise... so we are greatly diminished by its cancellation, no two ways about it.My main issue with it is that, despite the abundant wealth of talent on display, much of it was in vain as so many of the characters were barely understandable. It seemed the creators had some perverse need to shove as many incomprehensible accents as possible into one show. I am talking mainly about Escalante here, an otherwise great character but who in hell could understand what he was saying? Then we had the Irish jockey, another incredibly difficult accent to follow. Added to this we had Nick Nolte growling and muttering into his beard... and Richard Kind stuttering and stammering (a beautifully nuanced performance from him nevertheless, truly award-worthy).All great 'method' stuff but do these people ever consider the audience when they write these characters? Bear in mind the script wasn't exactly straightforward but featured highly complex sentences, and loaded with many cryptic references and nods to insider racetrack and betting jargon. Fascinating stuff indeed but totally wasted unless you have clear diction to deliver your beautiful words to the ears of the audience. Please heed us, oh creative gods from on high! All the method acting in the world is to no avail if people simply... cannot... understand... what... you... are... saying!

1576585,AYNAA33DXK6L8,B008V90TZI,Jonathan Kissel,"[9, 12]","David Milch is a great American artist. His previous work on Deadwood is an integral piece of the Golden Age of Television, in which we are currently living. No other TV writer can conjure the sense of community that Milch is able to evoke. The unforgettable scenes, the unique dialogue, and the complete, knowable characters are what made Deadwood great, and those ingredients have all been transplanted from a Black Hills frontier town to a California horseracing track. Having spent much of his life around the racetrack, Luck is the series Milch was born to create, and these 9 episodes are a must-own for any viewer who wants to see TV at its finest.The story of Luck focuses on the Santa Anita racetrack and its inhabitants, from the high-rollers to the denizens. While a knowledge of horse racing certainly helps, it is not essential, as a close-watching of the show reveals all the necessary information. In the first of three parallel storylines, Ace Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) has just finished a 3-year jail sentence and is putting together a plan for revenge against the associates that set him up. With a rigged jackpot payed out to his loyal driver Gus (Dennis Farina), Ace is able to be the silent owner of the promising racehorse, Pint of Plain. Meanwhile, a foursome of degenerate gamblers, led by handicappers Marcus (Kevin Dunn) and Jerry (Jason Gedrick) put together a bet that could change their lives, and grizzled trainer Walter (Nick Nolte) begins to make waves with his untested new horse, Getting Up Mornin. These various threads are knitted together throughout the season, and the world of the track gets progressively larger, growing to include trainers, jockeys, agents, and veterinarians, all individually flawed and recognizable human beings.What distinguishes Luck from Milch's work in Deadwood is the direction of the series. Milch teamed up with director Michael Mann to create the show, and while Milch's stamp is unmissable in the writing, Mann makes an equally indelible impact on the look of the show. Nowhere is this more evident than in the racing sequences. They are shot like no other horse racing scenes I've ever seen. The close-up work, the musical choices, and the organized chaos of these powerful animals combine to make each race throughout the series feel unique and important. Additionally, a perfectly placed race-gone-wrong in the pilot gives each subsequent race magnified stakes.Besides its top-notch technical and creative aspects, Luck resonates most strongly as an argument for human connection. It's there when rookie and veteran jockeys commisserate with each other after a tragedy, or in the simple, ritualistic act of feeding carrots to a horse. It's especially there in a transcendent scene in the fourth episode that is truly the most beautiful scene I've ever witnessed on a TV show. Milch's deeply felt sense of friendship and community is so real and palpable that the viewer cannot help but be moved by it. The series is certainly no bed of roses, but the victories, no matter how small, joyfully propel the characters into their uncertain futures, futures the viewer longs to be a part of.Sadly, Luck was canceled after its first season due to three seperate horse deaths during production. Where previously, I would have been angry to have lost the stellar efforts of Milch, Mann, and the excellent cast just because of a few horses, the experience of watching Luck has changed my outlook. The horses are shot so powerfully, and the characters lives are improved so dramatically by them, that I could only think of their deaths as tragedies that weren't worth it. No feeling person could watch Getting Up Mornin storming down the track and not realize his beauty and moral worth. I believe that HBO and Milch and Mann did everything they could to minimize horse deaths, as their obvious love for the animals is all over the screen, but it was not enough, and their work could not continue.Luck is a valuable contribution to the Golden Age of Television. It is a world-altering look into horse racing whose production proved to be unsustainable, but still must be seen by the discerning TV fan. I anxiously await whatever Milch does next, as he continues to blow me away with the work he does for HBO.",5,"The culmination of an artist's life, cut short.",1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,4270,"['David', 'Milch', 'great', 'American', 'artist', 'previous', 'work', 'Deadwood', 'integral', 'piece', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Television', 'are', 'currently', 'living', 'other', 'TV', 'writer', 'can', 'conjure', 'sense', 'community', 'Milch', 'able', 'evoke', 'unforgettable', 'scenes', 'unique', 'dialogue', 'complete', 'knowable', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'Deadwood', 'great', 'ingredients', 'have', 'been', 'transplanted', 'Black', 'Hills', 'town', 'California', 'horseracing', 'track', 'Having', 'spent', 'much', 'life', 'racetrack', 'Luck', 'series', 'Milch', 'was', 'born', 'create', '9', 'episodes', 'are', 'must-own', 'viewer', 'who', 'see', 'TV', 'finest.The', 'story', 'Luck', 'Santa', 'Anita', 'racetrack', 'inhabitants', 'high-rollers', 'denizens', 'knowledge', 'horse', 'racing', 'certainly', 'not', 'essential', 'close-watching', 'show', 'necessary', 'information', 'first', 'three', 'parallel', 'storylines', 'Ace', 'Bernstein', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'just', 'finished', '3-year', 'jail', 'sentence', 'putting', 'together', 'plan', 'revenge', 'associates', 'set', 'up', 'rigged', 'jackpot', 'payed', 'out', 'loyal', 'driver', 'Gus', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Ace', 'able', 'be', 'silent', 'owner', 'promising', 'racehorse', 'Pint', 'Plain', 'Meanwhile', 'foursome', 'degenerate', 'gamblers', 'led', 'handicappers', 'Marcus', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Jerry', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'put', 'together', 'bet', 'could', 'change', 'lives', 'grizzled', 'trainer', 'Walter', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'make', 'waves', 'untested', 'new', 'horse', 'Getting', 'Up', 'Mornin', 'various', 'threads', 'are', 'knitted', 'together', 'season', 'world', 'track', 'progressively', 'larger', 'growing', 'include', 'trainers', 'jockeys', 'agents', 'veterinarians', 'individually', 'flawed', 'recognizable', 'human', 'distinguishes', 'Luck', 'Milch', 'work', 'Deadwood', 'direction', 'series', 'Milch', 'teamed', 'up', 'director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'create', 'show', 'Milch', 'stamp', 'unmissable', 'writing', 'Mann', 'equally', 'indelible', 'impact', 'look', 'show', 'more', 'evident', 'racing', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot', 'other', 'horse', 'racing', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'close-up', 'work', 'musical', 'choices', 'organized', 'chaos', 'powerful', 'animals', 'combine', 'make', 'race', 'series', 'feel', 'unique', 'important', 'Additionally', 'perfectly', 'placed', 'race-gone-wrong', 'pilot', 'subsequent', 'race', 'magnified', 'top-notch', 'technical', 'creative', 'aspects', 'Luck', 'most', 'strongly', 'argument', 'human', 'connection', 'there', 'when', 'rookie', 'veteran', 'jockeys', 'commisserate', 'other', 'tragedy', 'simple', 'ritualistic', 'act', 'feeding', 'carrots', 'horse', 'especially', 'there', 'transcendent', 'scene', 'fourth', 'episode', 'truly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'TV', 'show', 'Milch', 'deeply', 'felt', 'sense', 'friendship', 'community', 'so', 'real', 'palpable', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'moved', 'series', 'certainly', 'bed', 'roses', 'victories', 'matter', 'how', 'small', 'joyfully', 'propel', 'characters', 'uncertain', 'futures', 'futures', 'viewer', 'longs', 'be', 'part', 'of.Sadly', 'Luck', 'was', 'canceled', 'first', 'season', 'due', 'three', 'seperate', 'horse', 'deaths', 'production', 'Where', 'previously', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'angry', 'have', 'lost', 'stellar', 'efforts', 'Milch', 'Mann', 'excellent', 'cast', 'just', 'few', 'horses', 'experience', 'watching', 'Luck', 'changed', 'outlook', 'horses', 'are', 'shot', 'so', 'powerfully', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'improved', 'so', 'dramatically', 'could', 'only', 'think', 'deaths', 'tragedies', 'were', ""n't"", 'worth', 'No', 'feeling', 'person', 'could', 'watch', 'Getting', 'Up', 'Mornin', 'storming', 'down', 'track', 'not', 'realize', 'beauty', 'moral', 'worth', 'believe', 'HBO', 'Milch', 'Mann', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'minimize', 'horse', 'deaths', 'obvious', 'love', 'animals', 'screen', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'work', 'could', 'not', 'continue.Luck', 'valuable', 'contribution', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Television', 'world-altering', 'look', 'horse', 'racing', 'production', 'proved', 'be', 'unsustainable', 'still', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'discerning', 'TV', 'fan', 'anxiously', 'await', 'Milch', 'next', 'blow', 'away', 'work', 'HBO']",N/A
1576586,A35I428M5WAT5Q,B008V90TZI,"Joseph Kohout Jr. ""The Art of War""","[14, 19]","NO SPOILERS:To start, the show was in fact cancelled after a 3rd horse died during production.  It was not a ratings issue, as in fact, the show was initially renewed for a 2nd season.Great cast, interesting subject matter (at least to me) and ""pulp fiction"" like intersecting storylines.  So why did I see this as a *3 with a *1 bump for subject matter?  My reference to a popular ""Pink"" song aside, the main professional critique of Luck is that it was often opaque.  To validate that I knew the definition of opaque, I looked it up.  A sense of being ambiguous or vague.  While the definition may fit, my personal take is that everyone seems to come off as so cool and edgy with sketchy dialogue and slow plot build ups where reading between the proverbial lines was encouraged.  The Ace character (Hoffman) and his frequent interaction with Gus (Farina) were the most frequent offenders.Of the intersecting storylines, my favorite and most relatable was the group of ""railbirds"" (habitual gamblers and hangers-on at the track): Marcus (Kevin Dunn), Lonnie (Ian Hart), Renzo (Ritchie Coster) and Jerry (Jason Gedrick).  They all lived in side by side in a motel near the track.  In particular, I liked Jason Gedrick, as Jerry.  An astute handicapper whose talent did not unfortunately transcend to the poker tables.  I have memories of leaving a track and looking under the car seats for change to pay a turnpike toll and in sub freezing temperatures at the conclusion of an evening harness card after midnight in January, having to light my program on fire because the locks on my car were frozen!  Needless to say, this storyline resonated with me.Despite the premature cancellation and lack of resolution, the subject matter and performances make Luck a worthwhile watch.",4,"Tries a little too hard to be ""too school for cool!""",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,1777,"['SPOILERS', 'start', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'cancelled', '3rd', 'horse', 'died', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'ratings', 'issue', 'fact', 'show', 'was', 'initially', 'renewed', '2nd', 'season.Great', 'cast', 'interesting', 'subject', 'matter', 'least', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'intersecting', 'storylines', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'see', '*3', '*1', 'bump', 'subject', 'matter', 'reference', 'popular', 'Pink', 'song', 'aside', 'main', 'professional', 'critique', 'Luck', 'was', 'often', 'opaque', 'validate', 'knew', 'definition', 'opaque', 'looked', 'up', 'sense', 'being', 'ambiguous', 'vague', 'definition', 'may', 'fit', 'personal', 'take', 'everyone', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'cool', 'edgy', 'sketchy', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'plot', 'build', 'ups', 'where', 'reading', 'proverbial', 'lines', 'was', 'encouraged', 'Ace', 'character', 'Hoffman', 'frequent', 'interaction', 'Gus', 'Farina', 'were', 'most', 'frequent', 'intersecting', 'storylines', 'favorite', 'most', 'relatable', 'was', 'group', 'railbirds', 'habitual', 'gamblers', 'hangers-on', 'track', 'Marcus', 'Kevin', 'Dunn', 'Lonnie', 'Ian', 'Hart', 'Renzo', 'Ritchie', 'Coster', 'Jerry', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'lived', 'side', 'side', 'motel', 'track', 'particular', 'liked', 'Jason', 'Gedrick', 'Jerry', 'astute', 'handicapper', 'talent', 'did', 'not', 'unfortunately', 'transcend', 'poker', 'have', 'memories', 'leaving', 'track', 'looking', 'car', 'seats', 'change', 'pay', 'turnpike', 'toll', 'sub', 'freezing', 'temperatures', 'conclusion', 'evening', 'harness', 'card', 'midnight', 'January', 'having', 'light', 'program', 'fire', 'locks', 'car', 'were', 'frozen', 'Needless', 'say', 'storyline', 'resonated', 'premature', 'cancellation', 'lack', 'resolution', 'subject', 'matter', 'performances', 'make', 'Luck', 'worthwhile', 'watch']",N/A
1576587,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008V90TZI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 25]","HBO's prestige piece ""Luck"" was easily one of the year's most anticipated dramas.  Its creator David Milch had been responsible for some groundbreaking shows including ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Deadwood.""  Film legend Michael Mann (director of Heat among many other great pictures) was also a driving force behind the scenes.  And with Dustin Hoffman (not to mention Nick Nolte) stepping into television to take a leading role, expectations were through the roof with this pedigree of talent.  The real life story of ""Luck,"" however, made more of a noise than the actual program.  Though the show opened to generally favorable, but cautious, press--the viewership numbers didn't exactly ignite a ratings maelstrom.  Juggling dozens of peripheral characters, ""Luck"" was best appreciated by an adult audience with patience and fortitude.  Its methodical pacing was a challenge to some and as various plot threads wound around each other, the early episodes seemed to lack a dramatic imperative.  HBO backed Milch and Hoffman with an immediate second season approval, however, and yet this sophomore season was scrapped even as its filming was underway.  The show suffered real life tragedy when horses (three in total) were injured and had to be put down during production.  Responding to outside pressures about safety, HBO pulled the plug to an estimated cost of $35 million.It's a shame that things came to a conclusion the way they did, the show was really kicking into high gear by the end of these nine episodes (presented here in 4 disc Blu-ray or DVD sets).  As ""Luck"" begins, Hoffman as Chester ""Ace"" Bernstein is being released from prison.  The generally underrated Dennis Farina plays his right hand man, and the two have concocted a scheme where Farina would buy a prize winning horse as a front for his boss.  This leads our pair to the stables where we meet a plethora of supporting players.  There is a quartet of lovable losers led by inveterate gambler Jason Gedrick, a driven trainer with questionable tactics (John Ortiz) with his lady love and vet (Jill Hennessey), a grizzled owner (Nick Nolte), several jockeys, a comical agent (Richard Kind), and any number of other personalities.  It truly is a lot to juggle and not everyone is as developed to the degree necessary to maintain equal interest in the sideline plots.  Some of the disparate threads overlap, some intersect, and some seem to exist in a completely separate world.  While I was genuinely amused by Kind as well as our band of four low level gamblers (Gedrick, Kevin Dunn, Ian Hart, Ritchie Coster), I was less impressed by other stories (Hennessey picking up a stray kid rather randomly).Hoffman, of course, was a major selling point for me and he is refreshingly understated here.  His machinations aren't always entirely clear, but when he goes to war with a rival (the great Michael Gambon)--the show reaches new heights of intrigue.  But for me, it is Farina that steals every scene he's in.  Later episodes have him get a little more physical, and it's impressive to see the aging tough guy unleash.  While Nolte is good, he doesn't have much to do.  And Joan Allen appears in a rather underwritten role as well.  ""Luck"" has ambition to spare, that's for sure, it just never quite fulfilled the enormous potential it promised.  I loved the chaotic ambience of the race track, but the actual story lines sometimes seemed spread very thinly.  Still, it's an easy recommendation for the proper audience.  If you can get through the initial set-up (with a character scorecard perhaps), the program gets increasingly rewarding.  I would definitely have tuned in for Season Two, but it's not to be.

1576590,A27MCNZZI03RII,B008V90TZI,Philip S,"[2, 3]","Luck was really beginning to grow on me. I enjoyed every episode of the first season but as it neared its midpoint the season started to go from really good to great. Unfortunately, it was also around this time that HBO broke the news: Luck would never see a second season. So, watching the last few episodes became a bittersweet ordeal, I wanted to know how things would end but in the back of my mind I knew I'd never see another live episode again. I had invested a lot in the show and it deserved better, but apparently not enough viewers felt the same way.Before you begin watching Luck, or consider purchasing it on blu-ray, you should know what to expect simply by looking at the talent behind the cameras; namely Michael Mann and David Milch. Each has their own style (Mann's is gritty, stylistic filmmaking and Milch's is complex, winding narrative structure) and both are present here in all their glory. If you don't like either of the aforementioned then you most likely will not enjoy Luck. Each episode has its owntouch of Mann and Milch, whether it's the perfectly cool music that accompanies a white-knuckle horse race or a delightfully complex conversation between gangsters and horse trainers. There is great attention to detail in this show and it's everywhere you look; it's evident in the way main characters speak, using all kinds of gambling and horse terminologies that are probably unfamiliar to most (which no doubt caused some viewers to lose interest). However, in my opinion these realistic touches gave the show an authentic feel that so few programs have. It really was unlike any other show and that alone warrants a viewing. Luck's authenticity will be greatly missed.The ensemble cast was great as well, and while the big names like Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte steal a lot of the focus, the best work comes from actors like Dennis Farina and John Ortiz. The work from these two, as well as the myriad of other supporting stars, is really great. They really inhabit the grimy world Mann and Milch created for them and it's a shame we won't get to watch them live in it a little longer.The video and audio aspects of the blu-ray are very well done, almost perfect, and they best all aspects of HBO's HD broadcast significantly. I love the 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The picture is sharp and crisp and the warm color tones feel spot on. The sound is equally great and every bit of dialogue is easily audible (which is absolutely necessary for any of Milch's work). There is no doubt, the blu-ray format is the best way to experience all that Luck has to offer. The extras definitely left me wanting; I desperately wanted to see the first few episodes of Luck's second season that had been shot prior to the show's cancellation (I never really expected them but I hoped). But, it was not meant to be. Instead,we are treated to a few HD documentaries, which are definitely informative and better than nothing. At this point, Luck fans have to take anything we can get!In summation, Luck is a fantastic show, albeit one without a proper ending. In what is most likely HBO's first and final treatment of the show, the studio has faithfully presented Luck on blu-ray.

1576591,A2G6W7HPS2E9P1,B008V90TZI,"Richard H. Burk ""Old Confederate""","[7, 8]","LUCK was a really great HBO show headed up and produced by Dustin Hoffman, with Dustin heading up a stellar cast including Dennis Farina.  Although the cover proclaims this as the complete first season, it is in fact the complete series, because the series was cut short due to the tragic loss of 3 Horses during the filming of the 1st season.  The animal rights folks went after HBO with a vengence, forcing them to shut down further production of the series,(something that to my knowledge has never happened to HBO before). There was nothing wrong with the story line and had the problem with horses not occured, they were well on their way to a 2nd season and possibly beyond that. Needless to say, although this is only one season, it is well worth buying and owning. Although it did not go beyond that, the way they ended the first season gives you at least a little closer and I think HBO owes that to Dustin Hoffman who went out of his way to make sure it closed out as best he could. ALso take note that there may be a couple of episodes included that might not have ever been shown on HBO, I only mention this as a rumor, as I heard that this may be the case. Since I don't own the finish product yet. This is a Pre-order item on Amazon and is said to be released on 27 November of this year, and yes I did pre-order it, and I watched every episode that HBO showed.

All of the character actors (including Dustin Hoffman, who has now gracefully graduated into that illustrious category) are magnificently and individually etched in well-worn varieties of stone. They all sound and look completely different even though they all seem ready to enter a federal prison or at least to check in with their parole officer. These actors are truly fascinating to observe. And you'd probably bet your last paycheck on any horse any one of them said would win. Each seems to have been born to play the role of a rail bird. The series is brilliantly cast.Horse racing has never been filmed this intimately and convincingly, or (because of the magic-hour lighting) as thrillingly.
