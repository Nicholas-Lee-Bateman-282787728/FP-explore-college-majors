I watched all sorts of military movies, from funny, to serious, to ridiculous.  I was surprised to find that the basic training scenes in this film are very realistic (to extents).  I was shocked to see cattle cars, gig lines, ""drop the pin, throw the grenade"", and the way Pauly Shore says ""Drill Sergeant"" is perfect.  It is lacking in a few areas.  First of all, flirting with a drill sergeant is the absolute last thing you would ever do.  In the real Army, Pauly Shore would have probably been chaptered out of the Army for such fraternization.The rest of this movie is just silly.  The broad variety of characters keeps the movie interesting, but unfortunately, the plot thins out in the middle and I found myself wishing it would get to the point.  There are some funny one liners in the film, such as, ""Son, I'm your First Sergeant"".  ""I'm sorry, but I've already had a few.""It's worth the time to watch it, especially if you've gone through basic training in the past 12 years.

I think a lot of people who read this will ask me why or something but half of them are probably closet fans. Plus I am sure most would admit to liking at least one of his movies. These are those types of guilty pleasures for people but I have to say I enjoy them. Now this is not my favorite of his films but I do like it and the characters in it.The story follows two friends that are your everyday slackers looking for an easy payday. They here how easy the reserves are and go ahead and sign up. It becomes a little harder then they thought but they make a few new friends in basic training. They all sign up for the water detail since they think it is the easiest there is. Little did they know it would be the first to be called to duty. Once in the desert they deal with their situation day by day being picked on by the veterans and higher ranking officers. That is until they get lost in the desert after an attack on their convoy. Now they are lost with little water and the enemy lurking some where in the hot sun.This is not the greatest movie ever made or even the greatest comedy ever but it is fun. Pauly Shore's brand of humor and style is not for every body but for those who like it this is one of his better films. Also Andy Dick was a great choice here for his buddy and sidekick. These two together make a great on screen team and next to Shore Dick is not his usual crazy self like in other films. Also the great David Alan Grier shines as usual here and was a wonderful addition to the cast. Then of course the female of the group [every good group has to have one] Lori Petty rounds out the click very nicely.This is a funny movie although not a laugh out loud constantly flick but it is funny. The group here and the people they cast make for a charismatic cast. In the Pauly Shore flicks this may be my third favorite or something like that.

744668,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00008L3W3,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 4]","This film is typical of the Pauly Shore screwup comedy, but is definitely better than Bio-Dome. Pauly is the definite star of the film with the much less talented Andy Dick playing the sidekick. They join the Army reserve because it's easy money and they choose water purification as their army specialty as that is the least likely in their pea-sized brains to see combat (I bet you can't guess where this is going.)Before long they are on a mission to Chad and off to war. Now let's ponder this for a moment...this is a Pauly Shore slapstick comedy about making potable water in Chad. As improbable as that sounds for a movie project, that's the bottom line, and before it's over Pauly becomes a war hero and gets the pretty girl with the crew cut.While most of the movie was pretty lowbrow, there were a couple of things I really liked. My favorite character was Fred Ostroff, played by David Alan Grier, who is a paranoid dental student, and who has the consistently best lines (like the ""emotional enema"" line from which I took the title of my review) and humorous vignettes, most of which feature dental flossing technique demonstrations.Far and away, though, my favorite bit in the movie is an ultra-obscure reference the writers slipped in to a very bad movie from 1980, ""The Pumaman."" Pauly Shore apes the brutish Vadinho when he seductively says to a starlet ""I couldn't have done it without the inspirational guidance of my brother the Pumaman."" This line won't make sense if you haven't seen ""The Pumaman,"" but for those that have it is pure gold.The movie is silly and will please fans of Shore and the brain-dead-stoner comedy genre.
