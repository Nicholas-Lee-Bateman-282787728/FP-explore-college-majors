I know for my kids it is hard to explain that different words can mean the same thing and then explain how other words mean the complete opposite!  This is a great DVD because it goes over words over and over so kids are constantly hearing them and picking them up.  I honestly put this on the other day while we played in the toy room and even though my kids weren't watching this, they were hearing the words and looking over.  My 18 month old loves this DVD the most probably because of the fun and adorable animation!  It is a great DVD for any preschooler (or younger) and even my kindergartner wanted to watch it again!  The words are easy enough for kids but they are beneficial for kids to learn.I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",5,Adorable and Educational,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,835,"['Explaining', 'kids', 'similar', 'words', 'opposites', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'know', 'kids', 'hard', 'explain', 'different', 'words', 'can', 'mean', 'same', 'thing', 'then', 'explain', 'how', 'other', 'words', 'mean', 'complete', 'opposite', 'great', 'DVD', 'words', 'so', 'kids', 'are', 'constantly', 'hearing', 'picking', 'honestly', 'put', 'other', 'day', 'played', 'toy', 'room', 'even', 'kids', 'were', ""n't"", 'watching', 'were', 'hearing', 'words', 'looking', '18', 'month', 'old', 'DVD', 'most', 'probably', 'fun', 'adorable', 'animation', 'great', 'DVD', 'preschooler', 'younger', 'even', 'kindergartner', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'words', 'are', 'easy', 'enough', 'kids', 'are', 'beneficial', 'kids', 'learn.I', 'was', 'sent', 'DVD', 'review', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",Leapfrog: The Magnificent Museum Of Opposite Words

I hope they release a CD of the scout songs, but at least they have a sing along feature on the DVD so we can skip to the songs if we want to. If you have the other scout movies (""Phonics Farm"" and ""Numberland"") this will be a great addition to the collection. If you have never seen scout my son and I highly recommend it!

Unlike most titles in the Leap Frog franchise (including ""Adventures in Shapeville Park"", another recent release), ""The Magnificent Museum of Opposite Words"" is confusing, forgettable and...oh yeah, not very educational.The opposites on display in the museum aren't very intuitive and will most likely go right over the heads of the target audience.  The story feels rushed, and it really feels like many elements were an afterthought to the flimsy ""lesson"" provided here.  I'll admit, though, that the characters are cute and certain portions of this program might hold your child's attention.  Also, the songs themselves are kind of catchy, but that's hardly high praise when this title already has so many strikes against it.Overall, I definitely wouldn't recommend this to any parents or kids, whether they're fans of Leap Frog or not.  Start with one of the other releases first.On a related note, I've written a more in-depth review over at DVDtalk.com which you can find at that site (can't post a direct link, unfortunately).",2,Confusing and not very educational,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1133,"[""'m"", 'shocked', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'exist', 'DVD', 'hey', 'actually', 'watched', 'most', 'titles', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'franchise', 'including', 'Adventures', 'Shapeville', 'Park', 'recent', 'release', 'Magnificent', 'Museum', 'Opposite', 'Words', 'confusing', 'forgettable', 'yeah', 'not', 'very', 'educational.The', 'opposites', 'display', 'museum', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'intuitive', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'right', 'heads', 'target', 'audience', 'story', 'feels', 'rushed', 'really', 'many', 'elements', 'were', 'afterthought', 'flimsy', 'lesson', 'provided', 'here', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'though', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'certain', 'portions', 'program', 'might', 'hold', 'child', 'attention', 'Also', 'songs', 'are', 'kind', 'catchy', 'hardly', 'high', 'praise', 'when', 'title', 'already', 'so', 'many', 'strikes', 'it.Overall', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'parents', 'kids', ""'re"", 'fans', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'not', 'Start', 'one', 'other', 'releases', 'first.On', 'related', 'note', ""'ve"", 'written', 'more', 'in-depth', 'review', 'DVDtalk.com', 'can', 'find', 'site', 'ca', ""n't"", 'post', 'direct', 'link', 'unfortunately']",Leapfrog: The Magnificent Museum Of Opposite Words
