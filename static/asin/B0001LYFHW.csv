810149,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0001LYFHW,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","The Alamo was originally an adobe mission compound on the outskirts of San Antonio. The film starts at the end of the battle. News of its fall reaches the Texans. Then the story begins one year earlier. Sam Houston wants to go to Texas. David Crockett, former Congressman, is a legend in his own time. [The show ""Lion of the West"" is a pun on Crockett's story-telling.] The Texicans (like other Mexican states) oppose the military rule of Santa Anna (who worked for the big bankers and landowners). There are personality conflicts between the Texians, and the conflicting policies for the defense of the state. [You need to know the history to understand some of the scenes.] The Alamo is the sole defense against the Mexican Army. Santa Anna made a winter march for a surprise attack. Captured rebels (or freedom fighters) are executed by Santa Anna.The militia vote for their leader. Travis commands the regulars, Bowie the volunteers. There were no sentinels watching for the expected return of Santa Anna's forces, which greatly outnumbered the Texians. The defenders prepare for the worst. The Mexican artillery fires at night to deprive the defenders of sleep. Colonel Travis bravely recycles a cannon ball. Sam Houston wants a unified command. Houston doesn't have enough soldiers to relieve the siege of the Alamo. Santa Anna allows some to leave the Alamo. There is a red sky at evening. Some write letters to home. Santa Anna will take no prisoners.Santa Anna ordered a simultaneous attack on all sides to overwhelm the defenders with numerically superior forces. [The Texans had better quality gunpowder.] After a while the battle is over. David Crockett resists to the bitter end. The Texians retreat east. Santa Anna splits his forces to pursue the refugees. General Houston knows the Mexican forces will become weaker, and the opportunity to attack will come. The battle of San Jacinto was over in 18 minutes. Santa Anna signed a treaty recognizing the independence of the Republic of Texas. Nine years later Texas became the 28th state. The war with Mexico followed and led to the expansion of America.This film was said to be more historically correct than John Wayne's 1960 film, but it is less dramatic. This version correctly ends with the victory at San Jacinto, but skips over the massacre at Goliad. As entertainment, the 1960 film is better. You should read a book to best understand any historical film. Neither film did well at the box office, few historical dramas do well. Its difficult to pack weeks of history into a few hours without skimming over facts. This film shows the character of Santa Anna better than the 1960 film.",5,The Legend Retold,1222732800,"09 30, 2008",2008,2655,"['Alamo', 'was', 'originally', 'adobe', 'mission', 'compound', 'outskirts', 'San', 'Antonio', 'film', 'end', 'battle', 'News', 'fall', 'Texans', 'Then', 'story', 'one', 'year', 'earlier', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'go', 'Texas', 'David', 'Crockett', 'former', 'Congressman', 'legend', 'own', 'time', '[', 'show', 'Lion', 'West', 'pun', 'Crockett', 'story-telling', ']', 'Texicans', 'other', 'Mexican', 'states', 'oppose', 'military', 'rule', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'who', 'worked', 'big', 'bankers', 'landowners', 'are', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'Texians', 'conflicting', 'policies', 'defense', 'state', '[', 'need', 'know', 'history', 'understand', 'scenes', ']', 'Alamo', 'sole', 'defense', 'Mexican', 'Army', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'made', 'winter', 'march', 'surprise', 'attack', 'Captured', 'rebels', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'are', 'executed', 'Santa', 'Anna.The', 'militia', 'vote', 'leader', 'Travis', 'regulars', 'Bowie', 'volunteers', 'were', 'sentinels', 'watching', 'expected', 'return', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'forces', 'greatly', 'outnumbered', 'Texians', 'defenders', 'prepare', 'worst', 'Mexican', 'artillery', 'fires', 'night', 'deprive', 'defenders', 'sleep', 'Colonel', 'Travis', 'bravely', 'cannon', 'ball', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'unified', 'command', 'Houston', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'soldiers', 'relieve', 'siege', 'Alamo', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'leave', 'Alamo', 'red', 'sky', 'evening', 'write', 'letters', 'home', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'will', 'take', 'prisoners.Santa', 'Anna', 'ordered', 'simultaneous', 'attack', 'sides', 'overwhelm', 'defenders', 'numerically', 'superior', 'forces', '[', 'Texans', 'had', 'better', 'quality', 'gunpowder', ']', 'battle', 'David', 'Crockett', 'bitter', 'end', 'Texians', 'retreat', 'east', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'forces', 'pursue', 'refugees', 'General', 'Houston', 'Mexican', 'forces', 'will', 'become', 'weaker', 'opportunity', 'attack', 'will', 'come', 'battle', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'was', '18', 'minutes', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'signed', 'treaty', 'recognizing', 'independence', 'Republic', 'Texas', 'Nine', 'years', 'later', 'Texas', 'became', '28th', 'state', 'war', 'Mexico', 'followed', 'led', 'expansion', 'America.This', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'more', 'historically', 'correct', 'John', 'Wayne', '1960', 'film', 'less', 'dramatic', 'version', 'correctly', 'victory', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'massacre', 'Goliad', 'entertainment', '1960', 'film', 'better', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'best', 'understand', 'historical', 'film', 'film', 'did', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'few', 'historical', 'dramas', 'do', 'well', 'difficult', 'pack', 'weeks', 'history', 'few', 'hours', 'skimming', 'over', 'facts', 'film', 'character', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'better', '1960', 'film']",N/A
810150,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0001LYFHW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[8, 34]","So, I really didn't like this film at all.  I know that seems like there is nothing that I like lately, but for some very strange reason the quality of pictures seem to be diminishing rapidly.  As I attempt to watch as much as I can from the video store wall, I cannot help but discover the poor nature of nearly everything Hollywood is releasing.  The Alamo is no different.  Here we have a group of men lost in a production befuddled film that would rather have the perfect ""visionary"" shot instead of actually telling a decent story.  Creativity and originality seem to play second fiddle (pun is intended) to safe moments where our director could easily say ""historically correct"" instead of showing us any ounce of the truth.  There had to be some darkness in that bottomless pit known as the Alamo, yet Hancock didn't seem to focus on that at all.  I cannot help but wonder what type of film this would have been for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe to complete.  Literally, this film felt like a second-hand thrift store.  ""B"" actors filling in for table scraped parts that Crowe and Howard didn't want.  Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, and Billy Bob just didn't seem to fit the mold that I was hoping to see.  They did not accurately portray the ""Wild West"" as I was hoping to see.  Instead, I felt I was watching this glorified account of death done by pretty actors that would give the ladies a reason to go to the theater.Perhaps I am a bit to bitter about this film.  I know that I should only dwell on the positive, but as each film progresses with poor results, it is hard to even see the positive.  In fact, after the several films I have just watched I am nearly to the point of saying that Hollywood has gone completely to the dark side.  I understand that his was a historical picture, but does that mean that creativity and originality are thrown out the window and into oncoming traffic?  I would hope not, but apparently Hancock had other thoughts.  From watching the special features of this film in which Hancock talks about the production of this film, he focuses so less on the actors performances and more on the actual set that you can only calculate why there was less attention to the actors and more on the scenery with the final product.  As I watched the glorious overhead shots, the wondrous cannonball pan-through, and several other fantastical war scenes, I couldn't help but think to myself on how this should have been a story about people, not places.  I do not think that Hancock accomplished this, or ... really from the looks of it ... tried.With a central focus on the scenery and less on the acting, this creates a level of acceptable mediocrity with our actors.  Honestly, there wasn't one that stood out in the crowd as a ""riveting"" performance.  Each did their parts, brought some historical honesty to their lines, but overall it was Billy Bob being Billy Bob playing Davie Crockett and Jason Patric being Jason Patric playing Jim Bowie.  I don't know if this makes sense or not, but I could not see these actors in their corresponding roles.  I half-expected Dennis Quaid to come out of the forest at the end, ripping his shirt off, and pulling a Last of the Mohicans right there in front of God and his country ... but he did not.  In fact, he really didn't do anything except utter fragmented sentences from his dialogue that created this smart aura around him, when actually it was nothing more than Dennis Quaid being Dennis Quaid playing Mr. Houston.  It was, to use a favorite word of mind, pathetic.  I couldn't get the actors out of my mind.  I couldn't see them in their respective roles, and this hurt the film.  Directors have to realize that big names do not equal big film.  Smaller, independent names could have carried this film on their shoulders better than these veterans did.  Again, I cannot ponder enough about what the dynamics of this film would have been like if Randy Quaid were to jump aboard.  Has the two brothers done anything together?  I think The Alamo would have been a grand beginning.Overall, this feature did not impress me.  I know it bombed horribly at the box office, and now I can see why.  There was nothing of value throughout the entire picture.  From the uninsightful acting, the glamorized vision of war, and even the complete lack of structure (needing to focus more on man instead of nature), The Alamo proved that big budget can ruin a good history lesson.  Sadly, I am not sure what could have saved this picture outside of a complete gutting.  Have you ever walked into a room in which the walls were so moldy that you knew that you were going to have to rip them down to build a solid frame?  Well, that was the feeling behind The Alamo.  The walls to this picture were moldy and completely unstable leading to a flimsy frame.  If only more time would have been spent working on the important elements instead of the ""Hollywood"" moments, this may have done a bit better.  Until that time arrives, I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially those with any sort of passion for our nation's history.  I do believe it would cause mass professor spitting and a rebirth of the duel.Grade: * out of *****",1,I humble myself before God and there the list ends.,1114560000,"04 27, 2005",2005,5212,"['So',

810152,A2SHF3F8N7HGS3,B0001LYFHW,"Allen Eaton ""aleaton3""","[0, 0]","When Oliver Stone's PLATOON was released in 1986, it was both hailed and reviled.  It depended upon the viewer's point of view.  Many Vietman veterans cheered, grateful that the real story of their experiences had been depected with accuracy.  Many other vets complained that ""their"" story had been left out, that their point of view wasn't represented.  Unless you made a movie that would run for many days, you could not include everone's point of view.  This was the work of a single filmmaker;storyteller.  It was Stone's point of view.  It was one single movie.I rented the DVD of THE ALAMO last night.  I had not seen it in the theatres (I am legally blind and don't go out to theatres).  I did not know what to expect.  I just put in the DVD and pressed play.What I got was much better than I had been led to expect from the variety of reviews.  I was particularily interested in the way Col. Travis was played, having only the Laurence Harvey version from John Wayne's epic as a guide.  Here, I saw a young man who wanted to engage in one kind of war (a cavalry war) and instead finding himself locked into a hopeless defense of a basically indefensivable fortress.  How he accepted that responsibility was the key to his character.  The screenplay developed this character carefully and skillfully.I was also happy to see that his personal side (a man who abandoned his wife and children) was also shown.  It showed a much more human side, not just to Travis, but to the two other principals:  Bowie and Crockett.I am somewhat bewildered at the amount of controvery a single film can generate.  It is as if one side says that if you don't like this movie, you are unpatriotic.  This IS history to many, and they will not have it maligned.  Others seem intent on debunking this so-called ""myth-making"" by calling the movie idiotic and childish.I enjoyed the film.  While I might debate the issue of the final battle (and this debate has become someing of a ""cottage"" industry among many), and whether or not the Mexican army could practically sneek up to the very walls without being detected, my only regret is that there ware so many subtitles, especially in crucial scenes where we are given insights into the motives of Santa Ana and his officers.  Also, a little prologue giving a more indepth explaination of the reasons for the revolt of the Texans against the Mexican Republic would have been helpful.  I had to go to the internet afterwards and do a little research to fully understand all the reasons, on both sides.  The movie should have done a little more of that for me.Anyway, it's a good movie but it is also just one movie.  It is the view point of only one particular movie maker.

I saw the John Wayne film when it was released (many years ago - I was only 7!) and loved it but was very upset that Davey Crockett, who was a hero of mine, had died. I knew nothing of The Alamo and it's history and was shocked by the ending. Since then I've always had a fascination with everything-Alamo. I was excited about the new film and thought it excellent, very well filmed and acted and just a fantastic movie.My only challenge is the way the Crockett character was written. I thought Billy Bob Thornton stole the show, was brilliant as Crockett and the violin scene and his death scene are exceptional pieces of film that stay with you a long time. No, my point is that where I agree and liked the way his character was portrayed (multi-dimensional, flawed, down to earth) I disagree with how he seemed, at all times, to want to dispel his legend and make out that he really wasn't how most people thought of him. Well, he WAS like that when younger. He ended up at The Alamo by chance not realising the seriousness of it all but to try and tell an audience that he wasn't who he was is misleading and irresponsible. Well, that's my only negative point but this in no way interfered with my enjoyment.I loved the film and recommend it 100%.",5,Well worth seeing & buying!

THE ALAMO comes as close as any historical epic that I have ever seen.The key aspects of the events leading up to the thirteen-day siege, the battle itself, the Battle of San Jacinto and the biographical sketches of the key historical figures are all there.  No melodrama.  No needless exaggeration.  No unnecessary romance.The movie handles some difficult historical questions as well.  What actually happened to David Crockett?  How was he ultimately killed?  Historians have argued about it for nearly two-hundred years.  For me, the movie handled the question perfectly.While Dennis Quaid is a great Sam Houston and Jason Patric shines as the legendary James Bowie, Billy Bob Thornton is masterful as the larger-than-life David Crockett.  His personality, his accent, his ready smile and his overall presence are nothing short of outstanding.THE ALAMO is a splendid movie with a voice all its own, taking nothing away from previous classics like the original starring John Wayne.

Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna seizes power and declares himself dictator for life, many Texians, as they call themselves, want to break away to form their own republic. Santa Anna leads a large force into Texas to put down the rebellion, and he heads for Bexar d&eacute; San Antonio, where he knows the rebels have a large cache of weapons and cannons.The hard-drinking Gen. Sam Houston, appointed head of the Texian militia, sends Lt. Col William Travis and a group of volunteers to retrieve the cannons or, if necessary, defend the town. Assorted hangers-on accompany Travis, including the legendary Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. (Famous for his knife-fighting abilities, Bowie's ""knife"" can more properly be called a small sword.)Travis is a bit of a martinet, and the volunteers would rather answer to one of their own, Jim Bowie. When the time comes, however, Travis steps up, takes command and rallies the men. Crockett wryly feels himself a victim of his own legend and is compelled to live out what everyone expects of him. (That legend leads to some comical moments when a group of Mexicans refuses to attack for fear of Crockett, who supposedly can kill mountain lions with his bare hands and leap across the Mississippi River.)Thus the stage is set for the famous showdown at the redoubt called the Alamo. The 190 or so defenders refuse to surrender and hold off the Mexican forces for 13 days. Calls for reinforcements bring only a handful of men. Santa Anna, an arrogant, strutting peacock, is determined to wipe them off the earth to set an example to other rebels. After great bloodshed, he succeeds on March 6, 1836. But in short order he falls victim to his own conceit at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Texians, under the canny leadership of Houston, ""remember the Alamo"" and defeat the Mexican army.

After having read both the novel, which was apparently based on the original screenplay (before all the severe editing) and the making of the film book, which also contains the finished screenplay, I was both shocked and disappointed at just how severely the film was edited before release. Being an American living in England, I have talked to several people who are totally unfamiliar with The Alamo and it's history. My wife, who is British, is one of those people. She went to see the film with me and I had to explain early on in the film just what was happening and why. The filmmakers seemed to assume that anyone who saw the film would be well familiar with the story. They really needed to explain a little more at the start of the film. Yet, despite all of these shortcomings, the central story remains strong, backed up by the sterling and Oscar-worthy performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett and by some spectacular and harrowingly realistic battle scenes. The photography and the music are also first-rate. Patrick Wilson was also excellent as Travis, despite some bad reviews of his performance. Jason Patric had a thankless role as the mostly bed-ridden Bowie. Although Bowie is portrayed as a drunk, he was also supposed to have consumption (tuberculosis). Like Doc Holliday, perhaps he drank mainly to help cope with the ravages of the illness? I look forward to the DVD release and seeing the deleted scenes and hopefully, one day, the DVD release of the definitive Director's Cut. In the meantime, I can highly recommend the film just as it is. Having now received my copy of the DVD, I am somewhat disappointed by the deleted scenes.

Most everyone is familiar with the story of the Alamo, and this movie remains pretty close to accurate in its plot and storyline.What stands out most in this movie is the performance by Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett- the Tennessee congressman and explorer/frontiersman who went to the Alamo to help safeguard it against attack. Thornton is completely believable in the role, and his occasional humor provides the only funny moments in this dramatic picture.I liked Emilio Echevarria in the role as Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. His characterization really exemplified the traits that this military leader was known for: arrogance, pompousness, brutality, and miscalculation. I'm not so sure about Dennis Quaid, however, in the role as Sam Houston. Quaid seemed much too serious and his Houston character was void of much personality. The same could be said of the other actors in the film.Some parts of this movie move a little too slowly, but I still enjoyed this movie. If nothing else, I recommend watching it just to see Billy Bob Thornton's role as Davy Crockett.

810162,A15OZEIN9FM28O,B0001LYFHW,"Capt. Lou Costello ""Capt. Lou""","[13, 15]","After reading many of the other reviews I think a bit of background is in order. Mexico achieved its independence from Spain and set up a Republic and elected its first President. This man served out his term and then Antonio de Lopez Santa Ana was elected President. He then threw out the constitition and the elected government and declared himself absolute ruler of Mexico.A policy of encouraging immigration was established by Spain and continued by the new nation of Mexico. If a settler would convert to Catholicism they would be granted Mexican citizenship and be allowed to own land and start businesses. In this way Mexico hoped to attract entrepreneurs, business people, and money to the Provinces. James Bowie, for example, was a Mexican citizen when he died at the Alamo.By throwing out the constitution and siezing power Santa Ana provoked widespread opposition to his rule. The defenders of the Alamo wanted to restore the constitutional government of 1824. That is why the flag that flew over the Alamo was a Mexican flag with the date 1824 emblazoned on it.The movie production was troubled from the start with Ron Howard turning over the directors chair to John Lee Hancock who wrote the script. A magnificent set was built for this movie that exactly replicated the Alamo and San Antonio De Bexar. John Wayne did the same thing for his version of the Alamo and built his set in Brackettville, Texas. This the town where I am from and as a young man I was able to watch the construction of this set and the work on the film, a great experience for me at that time. The location people from the new movie visited the Wayne set and studied it for possible use but eventally rejected it as they felt that they surrounding terrain was not enough like San Antonio so they built their new set outside of Austin. They may have come to regret this as bad weather, torrential rain, and even snow plagued the production and caused significant delay.The movie was beautifully photographed and more than 100 hours of film was shot. This large amount of film contributed to delays in the editing process.I think that the cast was quite good and that the work by Patrick Wilson and Billy Bob Thornton was outstanding. The actor who played Santa Ana, Emilio Echevarra, was positively brilliant and he should have had an Oscar for best supporting actor.The costuming was excellent but the battle scenes could have been a bit better.Many of the men who died in the Alamo were in fact locals who had families and businesses in the area. One fact overlooked in the movie was that the settlers already had their hands full with marauding Indians and bandits and it was a hard decision for these people to leave their homes to defend the Alamo. Most of these were Anglos who were Mexican citizens. The 33 men who rode in from Gonzales all left behind families and most knew that they would not return.Originally the Alamo was garrisoned by Mexican Army troops who were driven out by the locals. When they returned to Mexico proper Santa Ana was so enraged that he marched immediately upon the Alamo, losing many of his soldiers in the forced winter march. This was accurately portrayed in the movie. The Texans were taken by surprise when the Mexican Army showed up in the early spring before defensive preparations were complete. The actor that played Col. Neale, the Alamo commander before Travis, commented ""........as you can see it was not designed with miltary intentions in mind.""One scene that really sticks out is when Crockett, sitting with other defenders around an evening campfire, describes his Indian fighting days and tells the story of the potatoes that he ate that were soaked in grease from burned human beings (the Indians).Another good scene is when Crockett mounts the wall and plays fiddle along with the Mexican Army Band as they play the Death Song, ""Deguello.""The movie carries through to the Battle of San Jacinto where Santa Ana is defeated and forced to cede Texas.Between the 200 or so defenders at the Alamo and the 400 prisoners shot down like dogs at Goliad a lot of Texan lives were lost, especially considering the relatively small population. There was much grief and sorrow after it was all over.A must have for those interested in Alamo lore.All in all this was a very good film that could have been a great film.

original""Godfather""film)is,overall,more entertaining than this revisionist twaddle..Hey!If you want""realism""(or political correctness)GO READ A BOOK !If you want history rather than entertainment,there's A&E;,the History Channel and PBS...If you want a good story,robust performances,good music and award nominated film-making see the John Wyane version...What is essentially wrong with this version is EVERYTHING...First of all it is revisionist political correctness taken to absurd lengths..Davey Crockett,played by Billy Bob Thornton(the only real reason to see this picture)is less than heroic but is portrayed instead as an opportunist ex-politician who has come to Texas thinking that the fighting is already over,and that he,as an ex-tennessee senator,might be able to renew his career in the new Texas republic..He is surprised that the fighting ISN'T over,and just the least bit annoyed that now he is in a position where his heroic manufactured image is in direct conflict with his real,opportunistic self..Jim Bowie is portrayed as a bigot,and Bill Travis is even more of an opportunist than ole Davey,and an adulterer to boot..Sam Houston ,likewise is not shown to be much more than an alcoholic who happens to be given command of an army that does nothing to help the defenders of the Alamo...Claiming to give equal time to the other side in this conflict,the producers of this mess portray Santa Anna as a brutal tyrant,much like he has been portrayed in every previous""Alamo""film(indeed,the very BEST portrayal of the mexican general was by Raoul Julia in""13 DAYS TO GLORY"",a made for teevee film,which was very well done,given the obvious budget restrictions..Julia's Santa Anna,while still a tyrant,was shown to be a much more complex individual than as portrayed in this film)...Sure,the saga of the alamo,as history,is not written in strictly hero and villian terms,but the mission of our entertainment industry has been TO ENTERTAIN..teaching a strictly accurate rendering of any historical tale is not the same as providing entertainment,or,for that matter,providing charecters one can either root for or against..This film wants to have it both ways...It wants to come across as a ""great""american epic while at the same time attempting to straddle the fence of political correctness..Crockett,while certainly not the unabashed patriot of the John Wyane classic was also not the almost craven coward that one mexican after-battle account has him being...indeed,save for this one Mexican account,all other surviving firsthand accounts(most notably that of Mrs Dickinson)say that,like most of the other defenders,he fell in battle..This film ,determined to be in conflict with the facts,chose the account written by a mexican army officer(and which was as much a propaganda effort as any subsequent gringo account)to portray a crockett who surrendered and was executed by the victorious mexicans...The final battle was,admittedly,fought just before dawn,but in terms of the cinema,such an epic scene filmed in near-total darkness(as it has been here)JUST DOES NOT WORK...a bunch of silhouetted figures running about,who are from time to time illuminated by weak light is not my idea of an exciting climax..add to this the god-awful dirge-like flapdoodle music,provided by Carter Burwell,and what you have is one really BAD scene,which is ironic,inasmuchas in every otheralamo film this last battle was the visual highlight...The filmakers here extend thier storyline beyond the fall of the alamo(and the death of ALL of the main gringo players)and show us the Sam Houston victory over Santa Anna..But Randy Quaid's Houston is a marginal part of the movie,the battle scene is one-sided in the extreme,and the film ends,abruptly,with the defeat of the mexican army..Nothing heroic here either,with all of the mexicans appearing as cowards,and most of the americans looking like blood-thirsty louts...This film is not entertainment..John Wyane's film is,even if it isn't historically accurate(and even if some of the dialouge is stilted)..What we have,instead,is revisionism that neither entertains nor informs..",2,"Can there be any worse""Alamo""film than  this one?",1164153600,"11 22, 2006",2006,4287,"['doubt', 'Even', 'Last', 'Command', '1950s', 'effort', 'Republic', 'pictures', 'starring',

810168,A3DTUMLBZCG47D,B0001LYFHW,Connor J. Hamilton,"[4, 5]","The story of the Alamo is a powerful one. Few have not heard of this little Spanish mission in Texas and the brave men who defended it. We remember the great Davy Crockett, the famous pioneer who sold his life in the defense of the place, and Jim Bowie, the infamous knife-fighter, who fought alongside him. These renowned names have turned the Alamo into one of the many early American legends in fewer than 200 years.So it doesn't seem very surprising that a modern movie should be made of the event. The question one must inevitably ask is: Is it good?It tries to be.Starring Billy-Bob Thornton as the legendary Davy Crockett, the Alamo begins with the outcome we already know--the victorious but somewhat somber Mexican army is picking through the remains of the mission. After a few scenes of the resulting consternation and sorrow that results from the news, the movie shifts back a year, tracing the lives of the four main heroes at the Alamo prior to the battle in a few somewhat bewildering sequences in which it is difficult to tell exactly who everyone is or what is going on.So then, by the time the Mexicans start marching for the Alamo and you have unravelled everything, you settle back and wait for a good movie.The resultant film is a disjointed mix-and-match game, pulling pieces off of previous epic films like the Patriot, the Last Samurai, Zulu, and so on, stringing them together, and then leaving them there without making them cohesive.Look at it this way: it had many elements of a good film that went deeper than just the combat and looked at the heroes themselves, at the minds of the commanders and the value of human life--but it failed to bring all these elements to a head. We have Davy Crockett discussing the difficulty of being the expected hero before a crowd of admirers while old Davy from Tennesee doesn't feel up to it. This would be a nice place to set up a subplot of Crockett and Bowie conflicted between their legends and themselves. But nothing comes of this. We have that single conversation, and that's it.There were other good points; don't get me wrong. Crockett's last words were well-done. But this was, like the rest, a little tidbit or glimpse of an epic which never formed itself into a gripping whole.The final battle between General Sam Houston and the army of Santa Ana was one of the better parts of the film, although it still failed to salvage it.But all in all, this movie is somewhat like a 2-hour trailer of itself. We have a little tidbit of this here, a little of that there, and it never materializes into what you expect. It could have been good. The acting was not stellar or worthy of an Oscar nomination, but the actors played who they were supposed to and the four main characters in particular performed solidly.The screenplay was adequate, and the directing was O.K., although the battle scenes were cut off a little short. (Don't get me wrong here, I don't want extended, R-rated battle scenes filled with gore and blood. But this movie is about a battle, everyone was expecting a battle, and I think one can be used in the proper way-to make a movie dramatic, moving, and suspensful. Probably it could even have been cut off where it was in a way that worked, but the way the director did it seemed to hack them off a little abruptly.) The special effects, what there were of them, were not very impressive either, but as this movie did not hang on its special effects-which is actually a good thing-that does not really mar the overall film.For a movie that gave its best shot at the mark of epic greatness and found it had just fired a load of buckshot, of which only a few pieces hit the bulls-eye, The Alamo gets a 3 out of 5.",3,"The cry was to ""Remember the Alamo.""

Although the decision to conclude his presence onscreen in a scenario more in keeping with the controversial and possibly fraudulent De la Pe&ntilde;a Diary raised a few eyebrows, it was also the most dramatic possible exit for the film's most famous individual.The battle at the Alamo remains to this day such a passionately debated and celebrated topic that any film version is almost guaranteed to leave some segment of the population completely unsatisfied, and there were inevitably voices loudly raised when this movie was released three years ago. But as is so often the case with controversy, I found that those yelling the loudest were those who hadn't actually bothered to see the film they were denouncing. I recall how in 2004 I went online and urged a group of Texans to support this movie, and got an back an earful of negativity and (mostly misspelled) criticisms (with poor grammar) of the audacity of anyone except Texans themselves (and particularly the ""liberal"" Disney Corporation) to make a motion picture about the Alamo. Unlike all the rest of the history in the world, Texas history, they in effect claimed, belonged to them and them alone and was for them and them alone to interpret---even if their knowledge of the battle was in more than a few cases shown to be questionable.Sadly that sort of mindset goes a long way toward explaining why a fine film like The Alamo flopped and why since then so few historical epics have been made. Why should a studio spend time and money on a project doomed to be lambasted when for a smaller investment it can create a silly star-filled story that will be more profitable?As for me, I say for anyone who loves history, this is a good movie to see.",4,The Best Film Version Of These Events That's Been Done,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,2307,"['underappreciated', 'film', 'was', 'hurt', 'more', 'attempts', 'please', 'sides', 'was', 'failings', 'authenticity', 'Compared', 'past', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'story', '2004', 'Alamo', 'not', 'only', 'most', 'realistic', 'historically', 'accurate', 'depiction', '1836', 'battle', 'also', 'be', 'most', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'great', 'attention', 'paid', 'minor', 'details', 'clothing', 'housing', 'speech', 'patterns', 'weaponry', 'actual', 'battle', 'itself.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'mythbusting', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Crockett', 'not', 'Davy', 'show', 'here', 'was', 'unjustly', 'overlooked', 'Oscar', 'time', 'decision', 'conclude', 'presence', 'onscreen', 'scenario', 'more', 'keeping', 'controversial', 'possibly', 'fraudulent', 'De', 'la', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Diary', 'raised', 'few', 'eyebrows', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'dramatic', 'possible', 'exit', 'film', 'most', 'famous', 'individual.The', 'battle', 'Alamo', 'day', 'passionately', 'debated', 'celebrated', 'topic', 'film', 'version', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'leave', 'segment', 'population', 'completely', 'unsatisfied', 'were', 'inevitably', 'voices', 'loudly', 'raised', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'often', 'case', 'controversy', 'found', 'yelling', 'loudest', 'were', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'actually', 'bothered', 'see', 'film', 'were', 'denouncing', 'recall', 'how', '2004', 'went', 'online', 'urged', 'group', 'Texans', 'support', 'movie', 'got', 'back', 'earful', 'negativity', 'mostly', 'misspelled', 'criticisms', 'poor', 'grammar', 'audacity', 'anyone', 'Texans', 'particularly', 'liberal', 'Disney', 'Corporation', 'make', 'motion', 'picture', 'Alamo', 'rest', 'history', 'world', 'Texas', 'history', 'effect', 'claimed', 'belonged', 'alone', 'was', 'alone', 'interpret', '-even', 'knowledge', 'battle', 'was', 'more', 'few', 'cases', 'shown', 'be', 'questionable.Sadly', 'sort', 'mindset', 'long', 'way', 'explaining', 'why', 'fine', 'film', 'Alamo', 'flopped', 'why', 'then', 'few', 'historical', 'epics', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Why', 'should', 'studio', 'spend', 'time', 'money', 'project', 'doomed', 'be', 'lambasted', 'when', 'smaller', 'investment', 'can', 'create', 'silly', 'star-filled', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'profitable', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'history', 'good', 'movie', 'see']",N/A

Baer,"[5, 6]","The actual events that led to the siege of the Alamo and the establishment of the short-lived country called Texas lie shrouded in the fog of contested legends. Like the Middle East today, two peoples necessarily tell the story of the same land in far different ways. It is often said by Texans today that Mexico is achieving through immigration and fecundity what Santa Ana could not.Under such circumstances, there is room for a dramatic retelling of one side's story. THE ALAMO does that, and superbly. Jettisoning the attempt to see events from the Mexican point of view - it would have made for more textured history but a failed film - this movie simply tells the story of a heroic stand that many of its heros must have known was doomed from the start.In the end, Mexican General Santa Ana's Napoleonic ambitions die in an eighteen-minute battle at a place of Sam Houston's choosing.I work with leaders. Successful leaders usually have far more opportunity to draw on patience and fortitude than heroism. Yet in the heroism of this film *and* in Houston's patience, there are many lessons.David (or was he Davey?) Crockett wearing his legend lightly. Houston refusing to be drawn in to battle when blood and anger were running hot. A  young Lieutenant Coronel being told that 'sometimes it's just the *way* you say things' and discovering that stooping to burn his own hands on a hot cannon ball that someone else could have carried provided the elevation that had eluded him by command.These are the film's enduring lessons. They can be told even when the history is sketchy, because somewhere, right now, some human being whose knees are shaking is becoming a hero in just this way.A brilliant film, well shot, cunningly told, sincerely acted.

I liked the fact that they made a good faith effort to accurately depict the seige and battle, without fear or favor.The only real inaccuracy I noted was that Emilio Echeverria was too old to play Santa Anna, who, if I recall correctly, was only about 42 when the battle took place.  (After being captured at San Jacinto and held for several years, Santa Anna returned to Mexico and had a long political career, including becoming president again.)I loved the way Billy Bob Thornton played Davy Crockett as someone trying to live up to his own out-sized legend, but not always enjoying it.  I also liked the attention paid to Sam Houston and the depiction of the brief but decisive battle of San Jacinto.

Actually, it is quite difficult to make Bunker Hill, Concord and the Shot Heard Round the Wall, Grant's great march to outflank Vicksburg, and, of course, almost anything done by George Washington, most likely the single man most critical to the existence of the Nation, seem real. This is because the function of a Nation's Founding Myth requires that it not be reducible to its actual human substance, to the foibles, weakness and errors even the greatest share with the rest of us. The Alamo is a much better picture than I thought it could be, having been made recently.While each sub-group of the society has its OUTSIZED myths regarding friends and enemies among the Notables, still there is a stronger element of cynicism than has been so general in the past (or, at least, many commentators tell us that is the case).At any rate, the admixture of seeming reality and ""creative story telling"" is pretty good in this film. We do get real-seeming people, and, unlikely heroics, mixed in. At any rate, I did enjoy the film, did not feel it was overblown or half-baked. While dramatically the last sequence was a psychological necessity (a way of saying, a box office necessity) still it was not in the least objectionable). I knew the name of only one of the actors (Quaid) but all of those bearing historic names, him included, did about as well as could be done.

I cannot attest to the historical accuracy, but the film works beautifully as a meditation on the themes of heroism, love, death, and the cruelty of war.  If the film has a weakness, it is the failure to explain more precisely the events that led to this seminal battle, but this did not substantially diminish my enjoyment.  What the film so beautifully accomplishes is putting a human face on the participants to the conflict: their motivations, weaknesses, fears, and ultimately their devastating heroism.  With the exception of Santa Anna himself, even the ""enemy"" troops are portrayed sympathetically as victims of forces beyond their control: there is a haunting scene where Santa Anna's band is playing and the Crockett character accompanies them on his fiddle (as part of a uniformly lovely soundtrack), during which I was irrationally tempted to hope that everyone would recognize their common humanity and come to their senses.  But of course, like the countless other slaughters that have occurred throughout human history, this one proceeds inexorably to its grim conclusion.  At a time when the overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens remain safely distanced from the violence in Iraq, this film is a poignant reminder that each life is precious and that the horrors of war should never be underestimated.",5,Very Moving,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,1478,"['woman', 'who', 'not', 'inherently', 'attracted', 'films', 'war', 'rented', 'mostly', 'benefit', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'stunned', 'how', 'deeply', 'moved', 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'beautifully', 'meditation', 'themes', 'heroism', 'love', 'death', 'cruelty', 'war', 'film', 'weakness', 'failure', 'explain', 'more', 'precisely', 'events', 'led', 'seminal', 'battle', 'did', 'not', 'substantially', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'beautifully', 'accomplishes', 'putting', 'human', 'face', 'participants', 'conflict', 'motivations', 'weaknesses', 'fears', 'ultimately', 'devastating', 'heroism', 'exception', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'even', 'enemy', 'troops', 'are', 'portrayed', 'sympathetically', 'victims', 'forces', 'control', 'haunting', 'scene', 'where', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'band', 'playing', 'Crockett', 'character', 'fiddle', 'part', 'uniformly', 'lovely', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'irrationally', 'tempted', 'hope', 'everyone', 'would', 'recognize', 'common', 'humanity', 'come', 'senses', 'course', 'countless', 'other', 'slaughters', 'have', 'occurred', 'human', 'history', 'one', 'inexorably', 'grim', 'conclusion', 'time', 'when', 'overwhelming', 'majority', 'U.S.', 'citizens', 'remain', 'safely', 'distanced', 'violence', 'Iraq', 'film', 'poignant', 'reminder', 'life', 'precious', 'horrors', 'war', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'underestimated']",N/A
810185,A1S31XLRRB11US,B0001LYFHW,F. Adcock,"[6, 6]","This new version of the often told story certainly holds up well as far as historic accuracy, though it is by no means perfect in this regard.  The look of the movie is impressive, owing in large part to the fine art direction and Dean Semler's excellent photography.  If the acting had been better, and the film had had fewer ""dead"" spots (such as moments of conversation that really don't progress the story), I might have been kinder with my rating.  The one bright spot is the performance of Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, far more human, yet intelligent, than often portrayed in other films.  The low spot is the acting of Patrick Wilson as William Barret Travis, a portrayal that should make viewers wonder how he could have ever been given a command.John Lee Hancock's direction is more than adequate, but I will go to my grave wondering what a Ron Howard directed movie would have looked like had Disney given him the ""R"" rated okay.  My guess is that Howard would have done a superb job keeping the attention of the audience, as his other films have proven so well.In comparison to the John Wayne epic from 1960, the new film falls short in terms of outright entertainment, while the acting in the Wayne movie is certainly no better.  But, at least, Wayne knew how to make a thirteen day siege seem exciting.  Where the battle, as depicted in the new film, shows scared men doing the best they can to stay alive, the 1960 Wayne film shows a more heroic stand, men selling their lives dearly.  The viewer will have to decide which version is the more ""entertaining"".Having given a ""thumbs up"" to the art direction and cinematography in the new film, the 1960 movie also sported great work behind the camera, most notably William H. Clothier at the camera, perhaps an unsung hero in the film world.  Alfred Ybarra's art direction was masterful, presenting a set that brings to mind just how isolated the men in the Alamo really were.One thing Ybarra did that haunts me to this day: the image of the Alamo church (known to fans as ""The Waynamo"").  Where production designer Michael Corenblith decided to move the church forward in the 2004 version (putting it in line with the rest of the fort on the east side), Ybarra left the church in its rightful place, back and seamingly away from the rest of the mission, with low walls on either side of it.  This created a powerful silhouette against the brilliant Texas sky.  Cameraman Clothier knew that the church was one of the most famous icons in America, and made sure it loomed in the background in as many shots as possible.  To me, and others, this image of the burned out church WAS the Alamo, an unconscious reminder of the sacrfice good men on both sides made for their beliefs.",4,"A Tale of Two ""Alamo's""",1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,2747,"['new', 'version', 'often', 'told', 'story', 'certainly', 'up', 'well', 'as', 'far', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'means', 'perfect', 'regard', 'look', 'movie', 'impressive', 'owing', 'large', 'part', 'fine', 'art', 'direction', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'excellent', 'photography', 'acting', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'had', 'fewer', 'dead', 'spots', 'such', 'moments', 'conversation', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'progress', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'kinder', 'rating', 'one', 'bright', 'spot', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'David', 'Crockett', 'far', 'more', 'human', 'yet', 'intelligent', 'often', 'portrayed', 'other', 'films', 'low', 'spot', 'acting', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'William', 'Barret', 'Travis', 'portrayal', 'should', 'make', 'viewers', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'given', 'command.John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'direction', 'more', 'adequate', 'will', 'go', 'grave', 'wondering', 'what', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'directed', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'had', 'Disney', 'given', 'R', 'rated', 'okay', 'guess', 'Howard', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'keeping', 'attention', 'audience', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'proven', 'so', 'well.In', 'comparison', 'John', 'Wayne', 'epic', '1960', 'new', 'film', 'short', 'terms', 'outright', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'certainly', 'no', 'better', 'least', 'Wayne', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'thirteen', 'day', 'siege', 'seem', 'exciting', 'Where', 'battle', 'depicted', 'new', 'film', 'scared', 'men', 'doing', 'best', 'can', 'stay', 'alive', '1960', 'Wayne', 'film', 'more', 'heroic', 'stand', 'men', 'selling', 'lives', 'dearly', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'version', 'more', 'entertaining', '.Having', 'given', 'thumbs', 'up', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'new', 'film', '1960', 'movie', 'also', 'sported', 'great', 'work', 'camera', 'most', 'notably', 'William', 'H.', 'Clothier', 'camera', 'perhaps', 'unsung', 'hero', 'film', 'world', 'Alfred', 'Ybarra', 'art', 'direction', 'was', 'masterful', 'presenting', 'set', 'mind', 'just', 'how', 'isolated', 'men', 'Alamo', 'really', 'were.One', 'thing', 'Ybarra', 'did', 'haunts', 'day', 'image', 'Alamo', 'church', 'known', 'fans', 'Waynamo', 'Where', 'production', 'designer', 'Michael', 'Corenblith', 'decided', 'move', 'church', 'forward', '2004', 'version', 'putting', 'line', 'rest', 'fort', 'east', 'side', 'Ybarra', 'left', 'church', 'rightful', 'place', 'back', 'seamingly', 'away', 'rest', 'mission', 'low', 'walls', 'side', 'created', 'powerful', 'silhouette', 'brilliant', 'Texas', 'sky', 'Cameraman', 'Clothier', 'knew', 'church', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'icons', 'America', 'made', 'sure', 'loomed', 'background', 'as', 'many', 'shots', 'possible', 'others', 'image', 'burned', 'out', 'church', 'Alamo', 'unconscious', 'reminder', 'sacrfice', 'good', 'men', 'sides', 'made', 'beliefs']",N/A

The film does tend to drag at a few points, but it eventually picks up steam again. What really carries this movie is the wonderful acting of Billy Bob Thorton as the American hero Davey Crockett. Thorton brings a human side to Davey, and shows that the real Crockett isn't as super-human as his legend believes and because of that legend, Davey has to try to live up to it but ultimately can't.The film does a good job of showing the bravery of the men at the Alamo. At times you are actually cheering the people on, but those who know the story of the Alamo know how it's going to end before the film even begins. Dennis Quaid is also really good in the film as well. It brings out a little of that patriotic spirit while watching the movie and I think that's what the film makers are going for.

They fought against Mexico's Ruler & Dictator, General Santa Anna and his vast army of about 4,000 men. The defenders of the Alamo lived 13 days of ""glory"", before they finally fell to Santa Anna's vast army. These 13 days bought time for General Sam Houston to put together an army of volunteers, so the defenders of the Alamo did not die in vain. This movie stars Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, and Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. It's another fantastic movie about the battle of the Alamo, and how Davy Crockett was defiant to the very end. In this movie, he was the lone wounded survivor, and he offered Santa Anna a chance to surrender to General Sam Houston, but Santa Anna laughed and killed him. Then Santa Anna and his vast army went on, to take on General Sam Houston and his army of voluteers.

It was good to see that the follow up after the fall of The Alamo was included in this film, which gave the sacrifice of the defenders an actual visual presentation in a well-staged battle.  The prolific Carter Burwell once again composed a befitting score. This time his score for THE ALAMO is rich and full of emotion and melancholy. Burwell seeks out the motivations and dissolutions of the principal defenders as their inevitable doom becomes apparent. This is Carter Burwell's best score to date and ranks up there next to his score for PSYCHO III.

Had all of those gossipy rumors not surfaced, perhaps the public might have been able to view this solid American history re-enactment for what it is - a well written, character driven, well acted blockbuster grand movie.  Yes, it is lengthy, but the length itself helps communicate the intensity and inevitable failure of the 13-day battle for the Alamo in 1836.  Disparate characters are drawn together from various regions of the young United States for personal reasons, most of those reasons initially were in response to frontierism and greed, but gradually mutated into camaraderie and pride for country. The siege of the Alamo by the Mexican forces led by General Santa Anna (well portrayed by Emilio Echevarria) defeats and slaughters the likes of mythic heroes Davy Crockett (another fine performance imbued with subtlety by Billy Bob Thornton), Jim Bowie (Jason Patrick) and LtCol William Travis (a fine role for the increasingly interesting Patrick Wilson - 'Angels in America').  Within the walls of the Alamo we learn each character's private and public history, a technique in writing that makes the well-known defeat of this small band of clever men even more sad.  Once the Alamo is taken, General Santa Anna decides to fragment his large army in order to attack the remaining general Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), but Houston's lessons of Napoleon and Wellington were well learned and the final battle of the movie is ingenious. And Mexico ceded Texas to the US.

810194,APASOUCF2UD42,B0001LYFHW,Greg Curtis,"[7, 19]","Another retelling of one of America's most dramatic battles, The Alamo depicts the futile 13-day standoff in 1836 between a brave group of ""Texians"" and their Mexican adversaries at a small Spanish church in San Antonio.Despite the odds against them, the Americans are willing to sacrifice their lives for land they have chosen to call home. Patrick Wilson stars as the impetuous Lieutenant-Colonel William Travis, who struggles for the respect of his volunteers. But, like the character he portrays, the unpolished Wilson is overshadowed by Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie. Thornton's performance as the compassionate and multi-talented ""King of the Wild Frontier"" is expressive, while the infrequently seen Patric is intense as the typhoid-suffering famous knife-fighter -- both are humble, knowing they are not the legends they have been made out to be.Together, these three men must stand up for their ideals against ruthless General Santa Anna (Emilio Echevarria), who views them as ""pirates"". Determined to preserve the integrity of the Mexican territory, he is confident in the strength of his massive army -- though seemingly all pomp and circumstance, they are a formidable force.Yet, director (and co-writer) John Lee Hancock is unable to bring much fervour to the story; perhaps he was preoccupied with his upcoming rehash of King Arthur. The battle scenes, though interesting, do not make up for the bland screenplay, which frequently stalls to explore the life stories of the three principals...the banal dialogue is as dry as the dusty compound where the action takes place.Like Pearl Harbor, an unnecessary postscript is tacked on to protect American pride, but this merely lessens the impact of the tragedy. Here we see General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) leading the retaliatory battle and cry for Texas independence. As usual, the likeable but unaccomplished Quaid acts rather than lives his character -- he is as lifeless as the corpses surrounding the funereal fortress.This version of The Alamo is not the epic it pretends to be. While the images of slaughter may unite some Americans against the terrorism that has affected their country, this film is only mildly inspiring. Unlike the actual event, it will not go down in history.

810195,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B0001LYFHW,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[3, 4]","Hollywood in the information age has made great strives towards historical accuracy, and Mark Johnson (Prod.) and John Lee Hancock's (Dir.) ""The Alamo"" is no exception. In fact, if this film were a book, it could easily be argued that the production assumes a considerable amount of prior knowledge on its audience. For those who have familiarized themselves with William C. Davis' _Three Roads to the Alamo_ (1998); the forensic revision _Alamo Traces_ (2003) by Thomas Ricks Lindley; or Stephen L. Hardin's _Texian Iliad_ (1994), this film will delight, as well as, tantalize. Hancock and company have not only turned in a graduate level production on a topic so shrouded in myth, but also cranked out a darn fine movie. Hancock, a native Texan, claimed he was just trying to get the story right. Historians have faced that same challenge since the 1920s, when the first serious scholarship regarding the Alamo began to appear. Eight decades, and mountains of literature later, (not to mention monumental changes in the way history is produced and consumed) we are still not completely sure how events unfolded during those thirteen fateful days leading up too March 6, 1836. The film centers on this epic's four most colorful characters: David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), James Bowie (Jason Patric), William B. Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid). Their lives prior to the Alamo produce the most glaring gaps in the film: Crockett's inner turmoil to live up too his superstar status; Bowie's haunting memories of his dead wife; a bittersweet divorce for Travis; and Houston's bout with depression and alcoholism only scratch the surface of these complex men. The shadier sides of their characters are only briefly hinted at in a line or two. The view from the other side of the hill is admirably done, especially the performance of Emilio Echevarria as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Many of the lesser known figures abound in the film, and many common myths are squelched as well. Unlike the TV movie ""The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory"" (1987), the most famous female survivor, Susanna Dickinson's voice is muted. This adheres to the criticism historians have levelled at her supposed eye witness accounts of the battle. The Tejano experience is subdued; for them, this was a true brother-against-brother civil war. Travis draws no line in the sand, and the liberty taken concerning Crockett's death is Hancock's most daring historical gamble. The film contains many poignant scenes. Billy Bob Thornton delivers a stellar performance as Crockett, and Wilson is most impressive as Travis. Patric and Quaid's performance, however, could not measure up to the complex figures they portrayed. The fifty-one acre set, accurately recreated down to minute detail, brilliant cinematography, wardrobe, and realistic battle scenes, propel this film to the top of the list of Alamo filmography. The DVD's behind-the-scenes extras and deleted scenes amplify those qualities. For the uninitiated, the historical gaps may dull the excitement. Yet, for the arm-chair historian, the temptation to fill them will be both rewarding and enjoyable.",4,Hollywood Enters Grad-school!,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,3146,"['Hollywood', 'information', 'age', 'made', 'great', 'strives', 'towards', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Mark', 'Johnson', 'Prod', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Dir', 'Alamo', 'exception', 'fact', 'film', 'were', 'book', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'argued', 'production', 'considerable', 'amount', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'who', 'have', 'familiarized', 'William', 'C.', 'Davis', '_Three', 'Roads', 'Alamo_', '1998', 'forensic', 'revision', '_Alamo', 'Traces_', '2003', 'Thomas', 'Ricks', 'Lindley', 'Stephen', 'L.', 'Hardin', '_Texian', 'Iliad_', '1994', 'film', 'will', 'delight', 'as', 'well', 'tantalize', 'Hancock', 'company', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'turned', 'graduate', 'level', 'production', 'topic', 'so', 'shrouded', 'myth', 'also', 'cranked', 'out', 'darn', 'fine', 'movie', 'Hancock', 'native', 'Texan', 'claimed', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'story', 'right', 'Historians', 'have', 'faced', 'same', 'challenge', '1920s', 'when', 'first', 'serious', 'scholarship', 'regarding', 'Alamo', 'began', 'appear', 'Eight', 'decades', 'mountains', 'literature', 'later', 'not', 'mention', 'monumental', 'changes', 'way', 'history', 'produced', 'consumed', 'are', 'still', 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'how', 'events', 'unfolded', 'thirteen', 'fateful', 'days', 'leading', 'up', 'too', 'March', '6', '1836', 'film', 'centers', 'epic', 'four', 'most', 'colorful', 'characters', 'David', 'Crockett', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'James', 'Bowie', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'William', 'B.', 'Travis', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'lives', 'prior', 'Alamo', 'produce', 'most', 'glaring', 'gaps', 'film', 'Crockett', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'live', 'up', 'too', 'superstar', 'status', 'Bowie', 'haunting', 'memories', 'dead', 'wife', 'bittersweet', 'divorce', 'Travis', 'Houston', 'bout', 'depression', 'alcoholism', 'only', 'scratch', 'surface', 'complex', 'men', 'shadier', 'sides', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'briefly', 'hinted', 'line', 'two', 'view', 'other', 'side', 'hill', 'admirably', 'done', 'especially', 'performance', 'Emilio', 'Echevarria', 'Antonio', 'Lopez', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'Many', 'lesser', 'known', 'figures', 'abound', 'film', 'many', 'common', 'myths', 'are', 'squelched', 'well', 'TV', 'movie', 'Alamo', '13', 'Days', 'Glory', '1987', 'most', 'famous', 'female', 'survivor', 'Susanna', 'Dickinson', 'voice', 'muted', 'criticism', 'historians', 'have', 'levelled', 'supposed', 'eye', 'witness', 'accounts', 'battle', 'Tejano', 'experience', 'subdued', 'was', 'true', 'brother-against-brother', 'civil', 'war', 'Travis', 'line', 'sand', 'liberty', 'taken', 'concerning', 'Crockett', 'death', 'Hancock', 'most', 'daring', 'historical', 'gamble', 'film', 'many', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Crockett', 'Wilson', 'most', 'impressive', 'Travis', 'Patric', 'Quaid', 'performance', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'complex', 'figures', 'portrayed', 'fifty-one', 'acre', 'set', 'accurately', 'recreated', 'down', 'minute', 'detail', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'wardrobe', 'realistic', 'battle', 'scenes', 'propel', 'film', 'top', 'list', 'Alamo', 'filmography', 'DVD', 'behind-the-scenes', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'amplify', 'qualities', 'uninitiated', 'historical', 'gaps', 'may', 'dull', 'excitement', 'arm-chair', 'historian', 'temptation', 'fill', 'will', 'be', 'rewarding', 'enjoyable']",N/A

First of all, it is NOT a REMAKE of the John Wayne version (Now fondly referred to as the WAYNEAMO).  Even though the title is the same, it is in reference to the Shrine of Texasand the events that took place there, not a previous film.  This movie stands on its own merit.  Saying the Alamo is a remake of the Wayne version, is like saying that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a remake of ""The Longest Day"" or ""D-Day, the 6th of June.""  Another reviewer was trying to figure out Santa Anna's age.  He was 42 to be exact.  While this movie was as Hollywoodian as any true story, it is probably closer to the truth than any other Alamo movie (and Wayne's was not the only one).  Kudos to those who recognize the character flaws of the real ""Three"" as portrayed in the film, and not the happy-go-lucky or flamboyant attitudes as portrayed in the Wayneamo.  This movie is certainly historically accurate in that sense.  The weather conditions were accurate, and the time of the morning the battle began was accurate.  With this movie you got a sort of feel as to what took place.  But the big question still is:  Did Crockett die fighting or did he surrender and was executed.  Look at the movie again.  Hancock settled this by having Crockett die ""Twice.""  Once, when he and three others were in the Alamo chapel at the end of the battle, and they rushed head-long into a swarm of Mexican soldiers.  While you did not actually see Crockett ""die"" in that scene, the message was quite clear.  Then there is the Screamer scene.  Crockett was a frontiersman and a statesman.  But he was human.  And I believe this movie portrayed him as he really was.  So it would not surpirse me if the real DAVID CROCKETT demanded the surrender of the Mexican army, knowing full well he was going to be executed (and by the way, did anyone actually see him die in that scene!  Just a swarm of Mexican soldados swarming over him with their bayonets after Santa Anna ordered his execution).

Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[4, 7]","Just 15 years removed from a hard-fought struggle for its independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico found itself unable to bridge the cultural gap with the aggressive Texas settlers looking for their own country. After establishing a provincial government, the Texans appointed Sam Houston commander of their army in early 1836.Thus began a back and forth grudge-match for control of San Antonio, the heart of Texas, punctuated by a massacre at a tiny, unfinished missionary known as The Alamo. A band of no more than 200 Texan settlers held off a siege of some 4,000 Mexicans, who were commanded by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.Under the direction of Cols. William Travis and James Bowie, as well as the legendary frontiersman and Congressman Davy Crockett, the men held their post for almost two weeks awaiting reinforcements from Gen. Houston.Assistance never arrived. Finally, on the evening of March 6, 1836, the Texans relinquished The Alamo to the Mexican troops in a bloody onslaught. Not a single Texan life was salvaged, with many corpses mutilated and beheaded at Gen. Santa Anna's request.When reinforcements did arrive at The Alamo a grisly sight lay ahead. All that remained of their comrades was a towering heap of smoldering flesh. However, six months later, exclaiming the mantra, ""Remember The Alamo"" through clenched teeth, Texans would get their revenge at San Jacinto. In a matter of 18 minutes, though outnumbered three to one, Gen. Houston conquered the Mexican forces and captured Gen. Santa Anna, sparing his life in exchange for Texas' independence.This is a story some of us have come to know quite well. Being a San Antonian by birthright, this tale has an unshakable foundation in my upbringing.This brings me to the multi-million-dollar remake of John Wayne's Western classic, ""The Alamo,"" a first-rate period piece starring Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett, Dennis Quaid as Houston and Jason Patric as Bowie.Surprisingly, for a picture that was so breast-fed by a major studio, ""The Alamo"" rubbed off as very non-Hollywood. The raw intensity, the breathtaking shots of the Texas landscape and, most importantly, the seemingly unrehearsed virtuosity of the cast make this film an immediate sibling to such notable Texas-rooted cinema as ""Giant"" and ""Hud.""Thornton captures Crockett in such a fetching style that viewers can't help but bow their heads and take a knee in mourning his valiant death. Patric is rough-and-tumble as the disturbed Bowie, twirling his oversized knife like a baton whenever slightly threatened. As for Quaid as Gen.

It is especially important that they gave a good account of the events leading up to the actual battle, which only lasted a half-hour and was more of a massacre anyway.  If you just want the battle, isn't there a John Wayne version?Insofar as I have learned, it is quite accurate historically.  They point out that the men at the Alamo came to be settlers, not to fight a war, and Jim Bowie even married into a prominent local family.  The film also shows the contribution of the Tejanos (those of Mexican descent living in Texas) to the independence movement, which was significant even before the American settlers arrived.  But I think you have to be a native Texan to get worked up about how Davy Crockett was killed; myth is a big deal there.  And I have a minor quibble.

I finally got the DVD this Christmas, and re-watched it. I found that I loved it more than I had remembered!This is an excellent production. It makes any and all other movies about the subject laughable peices of Hollywood mythology. THIS film is more historically accurate than any of its predecessors.Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Sam Houston is satisfactory, Jason Patric's Jim Bowie is excellent, and Patrick Wilson's portrayal of the young William Travis is outstanding. But my favorite of the film, by far, is Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Davie Crockett. Thornton gives a very HUMAN face to the legendary American folk hero. ""If it were just me, David, here all by himself? I might scale these walls and take my chances. But, that Davie Crockett fellow.... everyone's watching HIM"". Greatest line in the movie.As for the movie itself, it runs over 2 hours, but you don't detect it. Its pace is perfect, and there are no dragging spots. The action picks up immediately and never ceases. The movie does an excellent job of building-up to the final showdown at the mission. The final assault on the Alamo is absolutely incredible. First-rate cinematography through and through. Again, the most accurate depiction of the battle I have ever seen. Shot at the proper time of day (dark pre-dawn, and not mid-day!). The battle is over relatively quickly, as was the case. There may have been SOME exagerration with regards to the Mexican army's casualties. I'm not 100% sure.There has always been a mystery surrounding the death of Davie Crockett. Did he die defending the Alamo? Was he captured? Did he beg for his life? All we have are the accounts of the Mexican witnesses to the battle, and some of those may be tainted. I believe the makers of this film got at least the part about his being captured right. Who can really say how things went after that?The film ends with Sam Houston's masterful luring of Santa Ana into a ""Mexican Waterloo"" at San Jacinto.... and the complete rout of the Mexican army there, to the chorus of ""Remember The Alamo"". A defining moment in America's history.This film did not do well at the box office. But that was no surprise. It was the kind of ""niche"" film that couldn't really expect to pull in big numbers.

810205,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,B0001LYFHW,"Jeremy Ulrey ""Bangyrmfhead""","[9, 11]","Of the many praising this movie, one constant in their reviews seems to be a defense of the historical accuracy over previous cinematic adaptations.  Allow me to submit up front to the merits of the film's accuracy, while at the same time dispute it's overall merits.  ""The Alamo"", despite it's good intentions, falls into the trap of putting all it's energy into the historical accuracy at the expense of all else, including engaging storytelling.  Naturally, 90% of historical epics coming out of Hollywood take significant liberties with the facts, but it seems it's this severe dichotomy which misleads filmmakers like John Lee Hancock into believing they can get by on just the facts.The acting (with the exception perhaps of Dennis Quaid) had been almost universally praised, and there really isn't anything to complain about in that department, but neither does the austere, virtually blow-by-blow script allow any of the participants to really run away with their parts.  There is also a certain staginess to the scenes which wasn't present in the John Wayne version, despite the fact that both had to deal with taking place almost entirely behind the walls of an ad hoc fortress.  Again, it feels like in placing so much emphasis on accuracy, there isn't any room left over for dynamic storytelling.  After a time, the almost complete lack of overt emotion becomes almost disturbing;  Texans have always been known for their fiery stubbornness, but little is shown of the fire beneath the characters of the Alamo defendants, even during the speech where Travis attempts to persuade the Texans to stay.  There is also little dynamism in the relationship between Travis and Bowie, the latter of whom brought his own quite capable men and refused to serve under Travis, only acquiescing when he became too ill to command even his own troops.Overall, the characters in this film go through the motions as if every step has been pre-ordained and they are merely carrying out their destiny;  in other words, it's more like we're watching actors re-enact the battle for the Alamo rather than watching the historical battle itself.  Those who would point out that we are in fact watching actors re-enact the battle miss the whole point of what movies are supposed to be about.The sole exception to the extreme subtlety in characterizations is Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston.  Quaid's part was allegedly cut significantly in the editing room, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was his blusterry overacting that led to this decision.  Though Houston was a known alcoholic, he was also a smart, tactical mind who was capable of keeping his cool under the most hostile of counsel, yet Quaid plays him as a near-madman always on the edge of a convulsive emotional fit.  His performance here has about as much subtlety as the one in ""Enemy Mine"" 20 years ago, which is to say: not much.  Dennis Quaid has always fared best in the kind of roles that Kevin Costner has popularized, those being simple, salt-of-the-earth type men who are forced to confront important yet black-and-white decisions.  None of this describes the character of Sam Houston, which is likely why Quaid has a hard time wrapping his chops around the role.In closing, I'd like to mention an old acquaintance of mine, who would always read books - mostly fiction - and then watch the movie adaptations with a fine tooth comb.  He seemed more interested in picking out details that the film had either gotten wrong or just omitted than he did in judging the movie of a piece in and of itself.  I mention this friend because this is the type of person most likely to enjoy the Alamo - the detailists, rather than those who are primarily concerned with the big picture.",3,Troubled production succumbs to it's own divisiveness,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,3734,"['many', 'praising', 'movie', 'one', 'constant', 'reviews', 'be', 'defense', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'previous', 'cinematic', 'adaptations', 'Allow', 'submit', 'up', 'front', 'merits', 'film', 'accuracy', 'same', 'time', 'dispute', 'overall', 'merits', 'Alamo', 'good', 'intentions', 'trap', 'putting', 'energy', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'expense', 'else', 'including', 'engaging', 'storytelling', 'Naturally', '90', '%', 'historical', 'epics', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'significant', 'liberties', 'facts', 'severe', 'dichotomy', 'filmmakers', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'believing', 'can', 'get', 'just', 'facts.The', 'acting', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'had', 'been', 'almost', 'universally', 'praised', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'complain', 'department', 'neither', 'austere', 'virtually', 'blow-by-blow', 'script', 'participants', 'really', 'run', 'away', 'parts', 'also', 'certain', 'staginess', 'scenes', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'fact', 'had', 'deal', 'taking', 'place', 'almost', 'entirely', 'walls', 'ad', 'hoc', 'fortress', 'Again', 'placing', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'accuracy', ""n't"", 'room', 'left', 'over', 'dynamic', 'storytelling', 'time', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'overt', 'emotion', 'almost', 'disturbing', 'Texans', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'fiery', 'stubbornness', 'little', 'shown', 'fire', 'characters', 'Alamo', 'defendants', 'even', 'speech', 'where', 'Travis', 'persuade', 'Texans', 'stay', 'also', 'little', 'dynamism', 'relationship', 'Travis', 'Bowie', 'latter', 'whom', 'brought', 'own', 'quite', 'capable', 'men', 'refused', 'serve', 'Travis', 'only', 'acquiescing', 'when', 'became', 'too', 'ill', 'command', 'even', 'own', 'troops.Overall', 'characters', 'film', 'go', 'motions', 'step', 'been', 'pre-ordained', 'are', 'merely', 'carrying', 'out', 'destiny', 'other', 'words', 'more', ""'re"", 'watching', 'actors', 're-enact', 'battle', 'Alamo', 'rather', 'watching', 'historical', 'battle', 'who', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'are', 'fact', 'watching', 'actors', 're-enact', 'battle', 'miss', 'whole', 'point', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'about.The', 'sole', 'exception', 'extreme', 'subtlety', 'characterizations', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'Quaid', 'part', 'was', 'allegedly', 'cut', 'significantly', 'editing', 'room', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'was', 'blusterry', 'overacting', 'led', 'decision', 'Houston', 'was', 'known', 'alcoholic', 'was', 'also', 'smart', 'tactical', 'mind', 'who', 'was', 'capable', 'keeping', 'cool', 'most', 'hostile', 'counsel', 'yet', 'Quaid', 'near-madman', 'always', 'edge', 'convulsive', 'emotional', 'fit', 'performance', 'here', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'subtlety', 'one', 'Enemy', 'Mine', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'say', 'not', 'much', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'always', 'fared', 'best', 'kind', 'roles', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'popularized', 'being', 'simple', 'salt-of-the-earth', 'type', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'important', 'yet', 'black-and-white', 'decisions', 'None', 'character', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'likely', 'why', 'Quaid', 'hard', 'time', 'wrapping', 'chops', 'role.In', 'closing', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'who', 'would', 'always', 'read', 'books', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'adaptations', 'fine', 'tooth', 'comb', 'seemed', 'more', 'interested', 'picking', 'out', 'details', 'film', 'had', 'gotten', 'wrong', 'just', 'omitted', 'did', 'judging', 'movie', 'piece', 'mention', 'friend', 'type', 'person', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'Alamo', 'detailists', 'rather', 'who', 'are', 'primarily', 'concerned', 'big', 'picture']",N/A

810209,A3TIM4HEBLH0NP,B0001LYFHW,"John A. Aragon ""The Rock""","[51, 56]","For serious students of history of the Alamo, director John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" can't be beat. Every phase of the battle (a night battle which lasted about 90 minutes) is accurately depicted. The movie shows how outlying sentries, sleep deprived after days of shelling, were bayoneted during the initial charge, how the Mexican battalions first scaled the north wall where Travis was killed, shot between the eyes, how defenders retreated into buildings lining the walls where terrible close-quarters fighting took place, and how the last defenders, including David Crockett, retreated into the chapel at the end.The film presents the view that some defenders, including Crockett, were captured and executed shortly after the battle. This controversial scenario is taken from the diary of a Mexican officer, Enrique De La Pena.I would have preferred that there be more middle and far distance scenes for those of us who love the history and are interested in military tactics. But director Hancock chose mostly close-ups of the action. This, I presume, was an artistic choice to maximize dramatic effect and my wishes to the contrary are but minor quibbles. (Boy, would I love to see the outtakes!) All in all, the film is a great achievement, the best Alamo film ever made.The politics which led to the war are skillfully presented. The script courageously includes the fact that the Mexican people were betrayed by the Anglos to whom they had given lands in return for oaths of allegiance. Another uncomfortable truth portrayed here is that the Texian rebels fought, against Mexico, for their freedom to continue the institution of slavery.The courage of both the Mexicans and the Gringos is shown. We see the Mexican army marching through the snow in the terrible winter of  February, 1836, with rags tied around their feet to redeem the honor of Mexico. This is no John Wayne; ""There was 10 of us and a million Mexicans"" Alamo.But what makes any war story great is the human portrayal. This is not lacking here. The writing is delicious. On arriving in San Antonio, Crockett makes one of his famous ""Prettiest wife, ugliest dog, meaner than a snapping turtle..."" speeches. A listener says; ""Gosh, Davey, now that yer here, Santy Anny won't dare attack!"" Crockett replies with a sick grin: ""I understood the fightin' was over. Ain't it?"" Crockett had come, hopeing to become the first President of the Republic of Texas.The counter-intuitive choice of Billy Bob Thorton to play David Crockett was brilliant. Thorton captures Crockett's humility and compassion for the common man (Crockett opposed Jackson's removal of Native Americans from the east, realizing that these people were more like the people Crockett knew than the politicians who wanted their lands). Thorton shows us how Davey really must have felt. And Thorton manages to even look like the few extant drawings and paintings we have of Crockett. This is good acting because Crockett was alot better looking than Billy Bob!Jason Patric smoulders and exudes danger as Bowie and Patrick Wilson's youthfulness truly illucidates Travis' courage. Emilio Echevarria's Santa Anna is at once sympathetic in his ideals and detestible in his arrogance and cynicisim. He says: ""What are the lives of soldiers but the lives of so many chickens?"" Santa Anna ignored the tenants of  Napolianic theory of warfare which held that artillery should  breach a fortified position before infantry advance. Santa Anna ordered his men to attack the fort with ladders and ""Sappers"" carrying axes to dismantle fortifications. The Mexican soldiers did their duty.The Alamo is America's Thermopylae. The story must be told again and again. No matter if the heroes' flaws are exposed. They are greater in the imperfections of their humanity.

Disney has made a nobel effort to get it right! They re-created San Antonio accurately in time with 1836.I enjoyed the film, but I must admit constantly comparing it to the 1960 version. The films have their own agendas. Wayne's film was very patriotic and heroic as compared to the Disney's darker and more stark version.I was very impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Crockett. His performance seemed more authentic than the Duke. My favorite scene was Crockett playing his fiddle in defiance to Santa Anna's army band. Billy Bob's Crockett was in self-conflict trying to live up to his super-human legend. John Wayne's Crockett was comfortable with his legend status.I felt the battle scenes leading to the fall of the Alamo seemed to be short as compared to John Wayne's version. The 1960 film exploited the overwhelming odds against the defenders with tension building up day by day. Disney's film just showed them suddenly being attacked during nightfall without any cinematic build up.Of course, the big difference was John Wayne's heroic death scene compared to Billy Bob's Crockett being captured and executed!Overall, I thought ""The Alamo"" was a very good film even with it's flaws.",4,Billy Bob was outstanding!,1097107200,"10 7, 2004",2004,1315,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'John', 'Wayne', '1960', 'version', 'Alamo', 'even', 'was', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'Disney', 'made', 'nobel', 'effort', 'get', 'right', 're-created', 'San', 'Antonio', 'accurately', 'time', '1836.I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'must', 'admit', 'constantly', 'comparing', '1960', 'version', 'films', 'have', 'own', 'agendas', 'Wayne', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'patriotic', 'heroic', 'as', 'compared', 'Disney', 'darker', 'more', 'stark', 'version.I', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'portrayal', 'David', 'Crockett', 'performance', 'seemed', 'more', 'authentic', 'Duke', 'favorite', 'scene', 'was', 'Crockett', 'playing', 'fiddle', 'defiance', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'army', 'band', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Crockett', 'was', 'self-conflict', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'super-human', 'legend', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Crockett', 'was', 'comfortable', 'legend', 'status.I', 'felt', 'battle', 'leading', 'fall', 'Alamo', 'seemed', 'be', 'short', 'compared', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', '1960', 'film', 'exploited', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'defenders', 'tension', 'building', 'up', 'day', 'day', 'Disney', 'film', 'just', 'showed', 'suddenly', 'being', 'attacked', 'cinematic', 'build', 'up.Of', 'course', 'big', 'difference', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'heroic', 'death', 'scene', 'compared', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Crockett', 'being', 'captured', 'executed', 'Overall', 'thought', 'Alamo', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'flaws']",N/A

The ones in this DVD has some added historical information that may clarify in places the events leading up to and surrounding the Alamo battle and beyond.  Always lacking though is a real clarity, because in reality there are many things that we will never really know, how many Texians fought in the Alamo, how many died on both sides, and of course, what were people really doing and saying during the siege.In all, this is a great rendition and appealing one regarding the story of Texan independence, how it was not all glory and rather confusing at times for all concerned.  The movie attempts for us to get very personal with the lead players in the tragedy.  We get a view into the lives of Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and Colonel William Travis with a little less than the old western style glorification giving us a deeper human look to our heroes.  There are interesting snippets where those of Mexican descent fighting with the Texians are wondering about their allies.We get a view in this film too from the perspective of Santa Ana and his leadership as they prepare to do battle at San Antonio de Behar and await the relief column from Sam Houston that never comes.  Santa Ana seems a bit tame for a dictator, but he still blusters and his staff though loyal to him attempt to convince him to be civil in the face of a bitter struggle.Calling the defenders of the Alamo ""Pirates"" they will be all killed, no mercy given to any.  That is really one of the sadder stories of the fight for Texan independence.  Even Fannin, who was at Goliad, lost most of his 300 plus men to execution who surrendered after the fall of the Alamo. They were slaughtered.  But, the US, as usual, forgets Goliad, which according to history was also part of the call that included Remember the Alamo.We get some interesting snippets of Billy Bob Thornton who does an amazing job with Crockett, you really like this guy.  He is really a positive and respectful person, juxtaposed to Bowie and Travis who are more fixated on themselves.  Yet, they are thrown in together for the fight of their lives which we know is a fight to the death.Yes, the movie is slow in places, so is a seige, at least one would imagine so.  The film has a grittiness to it as the forts occupiers sit and await their destiny.  One scene with Crockett sitting with his men manning the south barricade looks like a civil war photograph, givings us a sense of reality.The battle scene is moving, up to and including the death of Crockett.  Look for the extras which discuss his death from a historical persepective.  The movie takes us to the battle of San Jacinto which is the culmination of the battle for Texas.  There are a few tidbits that are given as usual about the lives of those involved.

810220,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B0001LYFHW,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[3, 4]","I live in a city in which many of the downtown streets are named after Alamo heroes: Travis, Crockett, Milam, and Texas, our main street. Note: just as in history, Houston was not there or here. I digress only to say I grew up with names of Alamo heroes  frequently spoken, like mantras to remember long-ago heroes.My sister and I visited the Alamo just a year ago and stood in many of the spots where blood was spilled and legends made. So it was only natural that I watch this movie when it recently played on a movie channel. John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" is not John Wayne's version. The older version was made during the years following World War II, when inspiring myth-making was in full ascent.This recent version is much grittier and more likely, although several reviewers gorgeously described the film as also modern myth making. I think, though, that Crockett's last filmic words were actually spoken, as I remember hearing them before, probably by one of the Alamo specialists at the time of our tour. ""Here's your last chance to surrender. Turn in your arms and I promise no harm will come to you"" are words out of Crockett's mouth to the huge crowd of surrounding Mexican soldiers. Note: Crockett was bound and on his knees. Another reviewer attributed Crockett's words to the journal of one of the Mexican leaders, with the knowledge that leaders keep these records of their (hopefully) heroic and historic deeds.Billie Bob Thornton, of all actors, plays Crockett and does so with low- and high-keyed perfection. In fact, the most memorable scene of the film occurs during the evening when the Mexican band would play its prelude to cannon firing. Crockett takes his fiddle on the upper level of the fort in full view of the Mexican soldiers and, during their playing of the battle prelude, plays his own haunting melody, creating a Texian version of meaning (the movie uses ""Texian"" rather than Texan). It's a moment to savor.Other notable actors include Patrick Wilson (a long-time favorite of mine after seeing him in ""Phantom of the Opera""). Travis seeks to be elected leader of the Alamo fighters, but meets opposition from some of his own men. He is notorious because he abandoned his wife and children, for visiting prostitutes, and gambling. Toward the end, when a dying Bowie (played carefully by Jason Patric), asks Travis for a dying drink, Travis responds--with tongue in cheek: ""I visit prostitutes, gamble, abandon children, but I draw the line at alcohol.""(As an historical side note: There is a museum/gift shop located next door to the Alamo. On display are several versions of Jim Bowie's designs for the Bowie knife. And let me tell you--that design is incredibly horrific!!!)The film itself is simply awesome, the story vividly retold on cellluloid for posterity. I plan to purchase the film, this version, for my own record of one of America's most important battles.

810222,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B0001LYFHW,Kenji Fujishima,"[4, 5]","Seeing that John Lee Hancock's THE ALAMO was released just before the summer of 2004---too far off for this movie to be seriously considered for any of the major movie awards---I usually wouldn't have made it a priority to see it. Still, as a staff member for the Daily Targum---the newspaper of Rutgers University---I was assigned the task of writing up a review for this movie. The advance buzz on this movie was not promising: it was originally supposed to be released at around Christmastime last year, but was pushed back for further recutting. That, and an apparently troubled production history, spelled out a possible disaster of a movie. As it turns out, THE ALAMO is hardly a disaster. It might not be a first-rate historical drama, but it has some elements to it that makes it special.My biggest reservation about THE ALAMO is that much of it seems rather stodgy, more like a history lesson than a real flesh-and-blood movie, with historical figures and incidents that are depicted onscreen but never really dramatized in a way that draws us into this historical period and the sticky situation these poor Texians find themselves in, having to defend their state all by themselves, without anything resembling reinforcements. THE ALAMO often seems workmanlike rather than truly inspired---a respectable movie but not always a genuinely compelling one.And yet, there is at least one thing in this movie that I think make it worth seeing at least once. Three words: Billy Bob Thornton. His portrayal of Davy Crockett is the standout performance of the film, one with the kind of sympathy and imagination that is somewhat missing from some of the other performances. This Crockett is one that struggles to maintain his legendary status, rather than one that revels in it, and Thornton brings out the man's underlying humanity in a way that lights up the screen whenever he's around. And, as the title of my review suggests, there is one scene involving Crockett that is I think is worth waiting for. It comes about 2/3s of the way through (I recall): it is dusk, there is a lull in the action, and Crockett, hearing a Mexican band performing on the other side, decides to take out his fiddle and play along. Okay, it doesn't sound like anything special, the way I describe it...but once you see it, you won't forget it. In its own way, that one poignant scene makes as powerful a statement against war as, say, all of APOCALYPSE NOW or PLATOON or other classic anti-war statements. For that one brief moment at the Alamo, differences are placed aside and the enemies simply revel in the power of music. Perhaps they are also reflecting on what Roger Ebert, in his review of the movie, describes as ""the innocence they have lost.""While THE ALAMO is undoubtedly well-made, with some striking cinematography by Dean Semler and some well-filmed battle scenes, the drama remains somewhat earthbound through a good deal of its 137 minutes. It is only whenever Billy Bob Thornton appears on the screen, and during that one magical scene, that THE ALAMO rises to greater heights---and I think those moments are enough to recommend the movie.",4,One magical scene worth waiting for in this ALAMO,1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,3141,"['Seeing', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'was', 'released', 'just', 'summer', '2004', '-too', 'far', 'off', 'movie', 'be', 'seriously', 'considered', 'major', 'movie', 'awards', '-I', 'usually', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'priority', 'see', 'Still', 'staff', 'member', 'Daily', 'Targum', '-the', 'newspaper', 'Rutgers', 'University', '-I', 'was', 'assigned', 'task', 'writing', 'up', 'review', 'movie', 'advance', 'buzz', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'promising', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'released', 'Christmastime', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'pushed', 'back', 'further', 'recutting', 'apparently', 'troubled', 'production', 'history', 'spelled', 'out', 'possible', 'disaster', 'movie', 'out', 'ALAMO', 'hardly', 'disaster', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'first-rate', 'historical', 'drama', 'elements', 'special.My', 'biggest', 'reservation', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'much', 'rather', 'stodgy', 'more', 'history', 'lesson', 'real', 'flesh-and-blood', 'movie', 'historical', 'figures', 'incidents', 'are', 'depicted', 'onscreen', 'never', 'really', 'dramatized', 'way', 'historical', 'period', 'sticky', 'situation', 'poor', 'Texians', 'find', 'having', 'defend', 'state', 'anything', 'resembling', 'reinforcements', 'ALAMO', 'often', 'rather', 'truly', 'inspired', '-a', 'respectable', 'movie', 'not', 'always', 'genuinely', 'compelling', 'one.And', 'yet', 'least', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'think', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'Three', 'words', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'portrayal', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'standout', 'performance', 'film', 'one', 'kind', 'sympathy', 'imagination', 'somewhat', 'missing', 'other', 'performances', 'Crockett', 'one', 'maintain', 'legendary', 'status', 'rather', 'one', 'Thornton', 'out', 'man', 'underlying', 'humanity', 'way', 'up', 'screen', 'whenever', 'around', 'title', 'review', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'Crockett', 'think', 'worth', 'waiting', '2/3s', 'way', 'recall', 'dusk', 'lull', 'action', 'Crockett', 'hearing', 'Mexican', 'band', 'performing', 'other', 'side', 'take', 'out', 'fiddle', 'play', 'along', 'Okay', ""n't"", 'sound', 'anything', 'special', 'way', 'describe', 'once', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forget', 'own', 'way', 'one', 'poignant', 'scene', 'as', 'powerful', 'statement', 'war', 'say', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'PLATOON', 'other', 'classic', 'anti-war', 'statements', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'Alamo', 'differences', 'are', 'placed', 'aside', 'enemies', 'simply', 'revel', 'power', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'also', 'reflecting', 'what', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'movie', 'innocence', 'have', 'lost', 'ALAMO', 'undoubtedly', 'well-made', 'striking', 'cinematography', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'well-filmed', 'battle', 'scenes', 'drama', 'somewhat', 'earthbound', 'good', 'deal', '137', 'minutes', 'only', 'whenever', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'screen', 'one', 'magical', 'scene', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'greater', 'heights', '-and', 'think', 'moments', 'are', 'enough', 'recommend', 'movie']",N/A

I'm not biased mind you I grew up in the North and moved the South when I was a teen. This film delievers epic battle scenes, a good dialouge, and great performances. Orignally renting this I thought it would be boring to watch given the fact you know the outcome of the battle- the Alamo falls killing all the men inside but- to my surprise it was very interesting.The Alamo shows heroics from ordinary men. Although showcasing some performances from extraordinary men including Davey Crockett who fell at the Alamo. Delievering such patriotic and strirring lines as ""Victory or death"" and ""Remember the Alamo!"" which became the battle cry after the masacree. The movie shows off the actions of the Alamo before, after, and during the fight. I understood a new sense of hopelessness as I looked over the Alamo wall to see that huge Mexican army suddenly you could tell their is NO escape. Also, hopeless as Sam Houston makes the decision not to send more troops to the men inside ""I'm not willing to sacrifice Texas"" despite people in the background saying ""it's the right thing to do.""Billy Bob Thorton gives the performance of his career as David Crockett who has more than a lot to live up to when it comes to celebrity. My favorite part of the movie is when Davey got caputered by the Mexicans at the Alamo- Santa Ana asking Crockett to beg for his life instead Crockett says ""You let me go, I'll talk to Mr. Sam Houston and make sure your fellers don't die... I'll do my best I'm not making any promises seeing how you've made things awfully frosty."" Patrick Wilson also does a good job as the newbie colonel perhaps, since it was his big acting debut he could relate a lot. Dennis Quaid does a good job as the revenge seeking Sam Houston and made us Texans proud.All in all this is one of those movies you will not be able to forget!

Whether it's Custer or the Alamo, we tend to know what happened, but why and how and what the participants thought at the time often is shrouded in mystery. Maybe it's better that way.What is impressive about the Alamo as an historical occurence is that like so many other tragedies it is this force that coelesces men and women to rally around the flag. Whether it's Custer or a High School fooball game, we rally around wrongs with righteous indignation. And often as Americans, with harsh consequences. So ""Remember the Alamo"" really is the clarion call that makes a state, creates a new nation and has men and women of differing visions put aside those views and join together.Billy Bob Thornton is great as the bemused Davy Crockett. Jason Patric also as Jim Bowie, riddled with drink and illness. The final scene of Colonel Bowie, barely conscious, facing off the aggresors from a bed from which he can't arise, was particularly well done. It was a great deal like the Richard Widmark portrayal, 40 years earlier.The subtlety with which we come to realize that these men and women weren't necessarily the ones you want to bring home to mother, was also well done. I sensed as in most great conflicts, they found themselves in a place not of their choosing, kind of frustrated by that, kind of resentful of that, but willing to make the best of it. If you recall that extraordinary expression on the face of another great, Steve McQueen in ""The Sand Pebbles,"" it was like that. 'I guess the time has come and I wish I could tell you how I got here.'Good job by all. Quaid's role as Houston is not up to par for him. But that may have been all he had to work with.

I actually slept through a lot of it and felt I didn't miss anything when I woke up.Basically, I never cared one whit as to whether the troops would survive, especially since the film opened with all of them dead and then did a flashback on how that happened. At no time did I have any empathy with them or their cause.  And the Mexican troops, who were depicted as the bad guys were equally silly.I'm sure there were a few factual details embedded somewhere in the story.  But the only thing I understood was that a lot of people died needlessly for a hopeless cause.  It's an old story that has been repeated over and over and still makes no sense.The best thing about the film was the cinematography.

I disagree with most of the critics on this point, most of whom panned the film (except for Roger Ebert, who said that critics disliked the film simply because it was good). The movie does more than simply tell the tale of the Alamo itself; it fits the incident into the larger picture of Texas history, and it does so without being long-winded. As with any good movie, the strength is in the characters. This is seen primarily in Billy Bob Thornton's Davy Crockett, who carries the weight of playing a living legend well, accompanied by all the difficulties that status can bring to a man. The battle itself seemed rather short, but Hancock succeeds in doing the one difficult thing about shooting a battle scene: communicating clearly what is happening in the chaos. Hancock also manages to avoid the sentimentality that often accompanies a story where men resign themselves to die, and doesn't fall into the trap of painting them with a twentieth century brush.

The Alamo isn't Hollywood. It is a sincere effort to do the historical homework and translate the real story to screen. It worked. I only wish that it had been appreciated enough to be a success at the box office. Hopefully as a DVD it will justify its existence and gain a ""cult"" following. The people involved in the film certainly deserve at least that much.Some intriguing details about this movie: there was evidently an effort made to select actors who resembled the historical people that they play (although Santa Ana is too old, a quibble); it was discovered that some of them are the actual descendants of those characters. There are no fictional roles, though a few are composites. The uniforms and all the details are spot-on, even down to showing zapadoris (Mexican sappers whose task was to demolish the walls of forts with their heavy axes): somebody was obviously a huge fan of the period and the story, to go to such lengths for visual authenticity.I thought that Billy Bob Thornton stole the show.

With those larger than life characters, larger than life battles and larger than life stories. But I am afraid this film is not a larger than life film. Apart from the historical accuracy, which I think is quite fine, (considering that there is only one point of view), this film is terribly boring. And not because there were not happening things all the time, but because it seems that the stories told have not been put together.We have the story of the Americans in El Alamo, the story of the Mexicans and the story of Sam Houston. But never, not for  a minute those stories seem to be part of a bigger one. It seems like they were doing three films and simply put together the parts.About the cast I think that Billy Bob Thorton is the only one who can be considering as acting in the film. His David Crockett is rather nice although it seems quite difficult to see him as a great hero, but at least is the only one who shows certain human aspects. But that only is not enough to make a good film. Dennis Quaid as Houston only appears, really, after the fall of El Alamo, right before the battle of San Jacinto, but that is not enough to make me believe that Houston was such a great leader.The characters played by Jason Patric and Patrick Wilson are completely forgetable. I do not know if they were really like that, but if they were , well, that siege for thirteen days was a joke.I was really disappointed by this film, because it had not spirit and not passion. And considering that Texans has this particular battle into their personal mythology I am afraid they must be quite disappointed too. This film has told me nothing about Texas, Mexico or the lives of people who lived there. Nothing about the changes in the frontier between Mexico and the United States, what other people in the USA thought about that  adventure  in Texas.

But after reading the W. Lord book, and actually visiting the Alamo, it ties the story of events up perfectly.

Travis walk across the plaza. I could feel the adrenaline and the terror of the Texans as they defended the Alamo's walls.  Just knowing that this happened makes you appreciate the history a little bit more.Billy Bob Thornton gave the best, and most outstanding performance as Crockett.  Some have questioned the ""authenticness"" of his violin duet with the Mexican army band, but in reality he did play the violin, and was noted by survivor, Mrs. Dickinson, to have played it several times during low moments of the 13 day seige.  What a lower moment than during the playing of ""Deguello"", knowing that another bombardment of the fort is minutes away. I can see Crockett playing his violin during this time.

I guess it stems from when I was a boy and actually visited the Alamo.Over the years I watched the John Wayne version, that was released in 1960. Although very entertaining, I found his accout to be pure Hollywood. More entertainment than fact. I also found the Disney version of this film to be fun but again not historically correct.We will probably never know if Travis drew the line in dirt with his sword or not.This new version of the Alamo attempts to show Santa Ana and the defenders of the Alamo  as they really were.Its shows how Crockett was in many ways trapped by his legand. The movie even goes so far as to speculate he might have tried to escape if he could have. It also makes you think he would have wanted to fight out in the open instead of being pinned down in a broken down mission.Its shows how barbaric Santa Ana really was and how he executed prisoners under a white flag of truce. When prisoners were killed they were bayonetted and then shot to make sure they were dead.The movie does not begin at the Alamo nor does it stop after the battle. It attempts to not only show the defenders of the Alamo, but it also shows what is happening with Sam Houston in his effort to defeat Santa Ana and claim Texas.There is always the controversy over how Crockett was killed and I Guess there always will be. Whether executed or not his legand remains in my mind. Captain Dickinson's wife as she was leaving the Alamo claims he was lying dead near the short fence that he and his Tennesseians were ordered to defend.

810243,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001LYFHW,mirasreviews,"[7, 10]","""The Alamo"" is an excellent example of what Hollywood does best. It tells personal stories against a sweeping historical background. The film recreates the legendary 13-day siege of the Alamo, when, in the winter of 1836, a group of about 180 federalist army and militiamen tried to defend the fort at San Antonio, Texas against the advancing Mexican Army under the command of General Santa Anna. They were impossibly outnumbered, as they waited for reinforcements that never came. But the volatile mix of Army, Texas militia, and Tejano militia fighters were all committed, for various reasons of their own, to securing independence for Texas, which was then part of Mexico. ""As the Alamo goes, so goes Texas,"" they believed. Ironically, their defeat facilitated Texan independence.The story of ""The Alamo"" lends itself perfectly to epic filmmaking. A more interesting and notable collection of characters could not be imagined. Nor could a more complex, pivotal, and stressful scenario. The film integrates character studies of the three most talked about and influential men at The Alamo into the story of Texas' most infamous battle. Commanding the regular army at the fort was Lt. Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), a very image-conscious man in his twenties. Having already been a newspaperman, a lawyer, abandoned one family, and gambled his way into debt, he now sought greatness in a military career. He thought he'd never see action at The Alamo. Commanding the militiamen was the legendary Col. James Bowie (Jason Patric), consumptive land-swindler, slave-trader, knife-fighter extraordinaire -hence the ""bowie knife"". He was a living epitome of frontier legend. Ambition brought another legend, David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), to the Alamo. Known far and wide for his great feats of outdoormanship and fresh from two terms representing Tennessee in Congress, he joined the Texan militia for land and political opportunity. Most of the film is spent on the 13-day siege, but unlike most Alamo films, this one doesn't end there. We follow the movements of another military legend, General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), whose strategy eventually defeated General Santa Anna. Alcoholic and a touch imbalanced, Houston adds to the cast of fascinating, colorful characters that populated the Texas frontier. These 4 men have very little in common on the face of it. But they were all very ambitious and extremely mindful of self-promotion. It's no wonder their personalities are larger than life, as their legends were even in their own time.Director John Lee Hancock has gone to extraordinary lengths to make this film historically accurate. There are inevitable changes in chronology and extra scenes necessary to demonstrate some point. But apart from some details that were consciously changed, ""The Alamo"" is remarkably and admirably accurate. Both American and Mexican records were relied upon to get things right, and historians of every ilk were consulted. Since there are records of who was present at the siege of the Alamo, each extra took on a specific identity. The most memorable performance of the film is Billy Bob Thornton's, but that is probably because he plays the most interesting character. The cast is universally superb. Of course, the siege of the Alamo has always been a hotly debated topic. I've never understood what there is to debate. Like the United States' founders a generation before them, the men who fought for Texan independence did so for both personal gain and ideological advancement. Mexico had every right to defend its territory, although not to abolish Texas' constitution. Mexico lost. But the conflict's final battles are a fascinating part of US history. ""The Alamo"" is epic filmmaking at its finest: Well-written, brilliantly portrayed characters against a backdrop of historically important, meticulously recreated events. It's great entertainment, and it's informative.The DVD: I have to mention the audio commentary first, because it's superb. Military historian Alan Hughes and Texas historian Stephen Hardin, both of whom advised on the film, do the commentary. They discuss historical accuracy, including the occasions on which the film departs from reality and why. And they provide a great deal of context and detail in addition to what we saw in the movie. It's worth sitting through the film twice to hear it. Other bonus features include 3 featurettes and 5 deleted scenes with commentary by director John Lee Hancock. ""Return of the Legend: The Making of the Alamo"" (18 minutes) provides a nice overview of how and why  ""The Alamo"" was made the way it was, including interviews with John Lee Hancock, principle actors, various historical consultants, costume designer Daniel Orlandi, and the SpyderCam operators, among others. It includes an interesting look at ""The Alamo""s 51-acre set, the largest ever constructed in North America. ""Deep in the Heart of Texas"" interviews the considerable number of cast and principle crew who are from Texas, including the film's director and its many extras/re-enactors. ""Walking in the Footsteps of Heroes"" profiles the 4 legendary men depicted in the film: William Travis, James Bowie, David Crockett, and General Sam Houston.

This movie is wonderfully entertaining - the producers could never, ever have produced an accurate version of the alluring Alamo saga because there isn't one. Often said to be the most controversial event in American history. The Pina accounts, long thought to be forgeries have recently pretty much been shown as such - other than that NO ONE knows what really happened at the end, the only living witnesses (primarily Susanna Dickinson) were hidden away (obviously) as the battle got going. It lasted about 30 to 90 minutes and no one was left alive to tell the tale. On the other side were primarily poor, Mexican soldiers who, in a society that was very segmented, would have been considered out of their station to give an account, so none did. Some Mexican officers did, but the Alamo was not (then) considered significant and so they said very little. Accounts from much later, like Pina, are forgeries, the only account from him we know to be real reveals he knew very little of those 90 minutes also - no one really did. Napoleon wrote (paraphrase) that a soldier sees not the battle but just what is in front of him at the moment - as a combat veteran, how true! So, a quick frantic 90 minutes of slaughter on both sides and it was done. Discussions about the Alamo will go on for ever no doubt. The movie makers were... making a movie - and a great watch it is. To show Travis as a man in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not really wanting to be there - and Bowie as a land grabbing, grubby little angry drunk - and Houston as the drunken buffoon he actually was (members of the Texas council wrote of their frustration that Houston would not leave the grog-shops to go to Alamo - he had no real reason he just didn't take the Alamo situation seriously) although it was said he was amiable - David Crockett was flawed but is the closest of all to our perception of him. This would have been accurate, but would it have been watchable? - I doubt it. A depressing tale that would overshadow the bravery. No, this was amazingly done, put together in the best way the producers could. Alamo fanatics can never, and will never be satisfied and all await the day when we discover an authentic manuscript that answers all the questions (good luck with that). Great movie, don't pay heed to Alamo historians, they shred everything 'Alamo' given the mass of unknowns it contains. Also like to mention I loved Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Col. David Crockett - moving and refreshing. Watch this, it's deeply moving. Hang the minor accuracy issues - every man there was a brave hero (even debauch old Sam came out of the grog-shops eventually) - we don't have the detail of it all, but we no doubt have the feel and emotion!",5,Amazing Movie - Don't Understand the Critics...,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2776,"['said', 'rarely', 'understand', 'critics', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'producers', 'could', 'never', 'ever', 'have', 'produced', 'accurate', 'version', 'alluring', 'Alamo', 'saga', ""n't"", 'one', 'Often', 'said', 'be', 'most', 'controversial', 'event', 'American', 'history', 'Pina', 'accounts', 'long', 'thought', 'be', 'forgeries', 'have', 'recently', 'pretty', 'much', 'been', 'shown', 'such', 'other', 'NO', 'ONE', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'end', 'only', 'living', 'witnesses', 'primarily', 'Susanna', 'Dickinson', 'were', 'hidden', 'away', 'obviously', 'battle', 'got', 'going', 'lasted', 'about', '30', '90', 'minutes', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'alive', 'tell', 'tale', 'other', 'side', 'were', 'primarily', 'poor', 'Mexican', 'soldiers', 'who', 'society', 'was', 'very', 'segmented', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'station', 'give', 'account', 'none', 'did', 'Mexican', 'officers', 'did', 'Alamo', 'was', 'not', 'then', 'considered', 'significant', 'so', 'said', 'very', 'little', 'Accounts', 'much', 'later', 'Pina', 'are', 'forgeries', 'only', 'account', 'know', 'be', 'real', 'reveals', 'knew', 'very', 'little', '90', 'minutes', 'also', 'one', 'really', 'did', 'Napoleon', 'wrote', 'paraphrase', 'soldier', 'not', 'battle', 'just', 'what', 'front', 'moment', 'combat', 'veteran', 'how', 'true', 'So', 'quick', 'frantic', '90', 'minutes', 'slaughter', 'sides', 'was', 'done', 'Discussions', 'Alamo', 'will', 'go', 'ever', 'doubt', 'movie', 'makers', 'were', 'making', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'show', 'Travis', 'man', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'wanting', 'be', 'there', 'Bowie', 'land', 'grabbing', 'grubby', 'little', 'angry', 'drunk', 'Houston', 'drunken', 'buffoon', 'actually', 'was', 'members', 'Texas', 'council', 'wrote', 'frustration', 'Houston', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'grog-shops', 'go', 'Alamo', 'had', 'real', 'reason', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'Alamo', 'situation', 'seriously', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'amiable', 'David', 'Crockett', 'was', 'flawed', 'closest', 'perception', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'accurate', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'watchable', 'doubt', 'depressing', 'tale', 'would', 'overshadow', 'bravery', 'No', 'was', 'amazingly', 'done', 'put', 'together', 'best', 'way', 'producers', 'could', 'Alamo', 'fanatics', 'can', 'never', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied', 'await', 'day', 'when', 'discover', 'authentic', 'manuscript', 'questions', 'good', 'luck', 'Great', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'heed', 'Alamo', 'historians', 'shred', 'everything', ""'Alamo"", 'given', 'mass', 'unknowns', 'Also', 'mention', 'loved', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'portrayal', 'Col.', 'David', 'Crockett', 'moving', 'refreshing', 'Watch', 'deeply', 'moving', 'Hang', 'minor', 'accuracy', 'issues', 'man', 'was', 'brave', 'hero', 'even', 'debauch', 'old', 'Sam', 'came', 'grog-shops', 'eventually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'detail', 'doubt', 'have', 'feel', 'emotion']",N/A

After seeing it on DVD, I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen, because it would have been a waste of a lot more money and I would have fallen asleep.  At least I was at home when I fell asleep through the middle section of this film.I don't fault the actors for this film.  This is the kind of film that looked like a lot more fun for the actors playing in it than for the viewers who have to watch it.  I don't know much about the Alamo history, but I am a fan of historical films and always want more of them made.  The reason is because I think they do a great service in helping us imagine what it was like back during that time period.  This film gets a lot of those details right and the actors do a great job in their roles.  However, the film has too many long stretches where nothing is happening.  Bits of conversations here and there, we get glimpses into the lives of Sam Houston, David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and Colonel Santa Anna of the Mexican Army (who fancies himself the Napoleon of the West).  The film moves along at a snail's pace and wasn't interesting until the last half hour or so when the big battle takes place, followed by another cool battle scene.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to save this film.  I'm not sure what needed to be done to fix this film, but obviously, it didn't do well at the box office for a reason that most people wouldn't have the patience to sit through a slow motion movie like this one.  I was hoping for a much more exciting movie, and this is from a guy who was hesitant to see ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" because he expected that film to be boring but was pleasantly surprised by.

Rios,"[6, 8]","i've been an Alamo fan all my life, so i was stoked to hear a new alamo movie was being brought to the big screen.first time i saw it, i have to admit i had mixed feelings. on a 10 point scale, i gave it about a 7.5, but after seeing it a second and even a third, i give it a 10 and two very enthusiastic thumbs up.this is the first alamo movie to actually portray the big three in a more true to life fashision. for once, Travis, Crockett, and Bowie seemed more life like and more humane and you got the sense that these were real people living in extraordinary times.Billy Bob Thorton should get every award possible for his portrayal as Davy Crockett. He seems caught in the middle between living up to his name and just being himself and for once, he seems human. you finally get the sense that Crockett came to Texas more for political reasons than to fight in the Alamo. and not that it diminishes his legend one bit, but it puts everything into perspective.Travis can't seem to step out of the shadow of Jim Bowie and Bowie is haunted over the loss of his house and his wife. I thought Hancock did a good job of also showing the cruelty and yet the sense of humanity on the Mexican side at the same time never losing track of the real story, the fight between two sides who fought for what they truly believed in.there are also some real moving parts in the film which include the Travis speech to the men in the Alamo, Crockett's last stand and his execution, but the movie moment for me is the Harmony scene with Crockett playing the fiddle to the Deguello.it's a real tear jerker scene.only major problem i had with the movie was the whole San Jacinto episode. the movie at that part felt like Pearl Harbor, when a whole other hour and new battle was added to the movie.i think for the most part the whole San Jacinto part could have been left out. like somebody once said, once the monster dies, the movie is over.overall, i gave The Alamo a 10. it's a GREAT movie and has some real touching, moving, tear jerker scenes. the characters portrayed are about as true to life as you can get, and watching Billy Bob in the bucksin uniform and the hat really opened your eyes.i can promise to you that for a moment, i saw the real Davy Crockett on the big screen.",5,better every time,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,2268,"['i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Alamo', 'fan', 'life', 'i', 'was', 'stoked', 'hear', 'new', 'alamo', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'brought', 'big', 'screen.first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'i', 'have', 'admit', 'i', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', '10', 'point', 'scale', 'i', 'gave', '7.5', 'seeing', 'second', 'even', 'third', 'i', 'give', '10', 'two', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'thumbs', 'up.this', 'first', 'alamo', 'movie', 'actually', 'portray', 'big', 'three', 'more', 'true', 'life', 'fashision', 'once', 'Travis', 'Crockett', 'Bowie', 'seemed', 'more', 'life', 'more', 'humane', 'got', 'sense', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'living', 'extraordinary', 'times.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'should', 'get', 'award', 'possible', 'portrayal', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'caught', 'middle', 'living', 'up', 'name', 'just', 'being', 'once', 'human', 'finally', 'get', 'sense', 'Crockett', 'came', 'Texas', 'more', 'political', 'reasons', 'fight', 'Alamo', 'not', 'legend', 'one', 'bit', 'everything', 'perspective.Travis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'step', 'out', 'shadow', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'Bowie', 'haunted', 'loss', 'house', 'wife', 'thought', 'Hancock', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'showing', 'cruelty', 'yet', 'sense', 'humanity', 'Mexican', 'side', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'losing', 'track', 'real', 'story', 'fight', 'two', 'sides', 'who', 'fought', 'what', 'truly', 'believed', 'are', 'also', 'real', 'moving', 'parts', 'film', 'include', 'Travis', 'speech', 'men', 'Alamo', 'Crockett', 'last', 'stand', 'execution', 'movie', 'moment', 'Harmony', 'scene', 'Crockett', 'playing', 'fiddle', 'Deguello.it', 'real', 'tear', 'jerker', 'scene.only', 'major', 'problem', 'i', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'whole', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'episode', 'movie', 'part', 'felt', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'when', 'whole', 'other', 'hour', 'new', 'battle', 'was', 'added', 'movie.i', 'think', 'most', 'part', 'whole', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'somebody', 'once', 'said', 'once', 'monster', 'movie', 'over.overall', 'i', 'gave', 'Alamo', '10.', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'real', 'touching', 'moving', 'tear', 'jerker', 'scenes', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'are', 'true', 'life', 'can', 'get', 'watching', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'bucksin', 'uniform', 'hat', 'really', 'opened', 'eyes.i', 'can', 'promise', 'moment', 'i', 'saw', 'real', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'big', 'screen']",N/A

Davis ""Bob""","[7, 9]","Watching Fess Parker in the 1950s play Davy Crocket in the Disney series made John Wayne less than believable in his 1960 ""The Alamo"" movie. Yes, I am that old, but still open minded. The 1960s was the era of the historical epic film typified by ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" and eventually producing the period's classic, ""Doctor Zhivago."" Like ""Braveheart,"" big budget productions mixed a minute amount of real history with valiant action and portrayed larger-than-life characters using larger-than-life actors such as John Wayne, Omar Sharif, and Charlton Heston.Davy Crocket was a mythical hero that could only be played by a mythical actor like John Wayne. Fess Parker and John Wayne's characters died in swashbuckling fashion fitting of a legend. Texans like their state and their demigods in mammoth proportions. The Alamo of Fess Parker and John Wayne fits this demand perfectly.Enter onto the historical/movie stage recently discovered manuscripts that portray a radically different end to Davy Crocket and his compatriots. Believe this to be an actual Mexican officer's first-hand account or not, this manuscript contends that Crocket was captured alive then executed. The new film's Santa Anna is not bogged down (as portrayed in the 1960s version) by trying to subdue The Alamo, before moving on the rest of Texas. Instead, the crafty Mexican dictator/generalissimo's intention is to trap the Texicans in the Alamo and then draw Sam Houston and his small army into a destine-to-fail battle on Santa Anna's terms. Houston does not fall for the pending ambush and knowingly sacrifices the Alamo's garrison in order to save the fledgling Texas army. Hence, he saves Texas from becoming a province of Mexico. For the first time on film the battle of San Jacinto becomes the finale of the Alamo story rather than Davy Crocket swinging his musket. While heroic in the face of certain annihilation, the Alamo was not the genesis of an independent Texas--San Jacinto was.Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Davy Crocket as a man trying to live up to his own legend is the best that has been done on any sized screen. Although weakly acted, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, and William Travis are all shown as men trying to escape their pasts and remolding themselves in a new land. If you want to see an action-packed yee-haw Alamo get the John Wayne version. If you want a deeper probe into the people who fought the battle (both Texican and Mexican) get the latest edition.",3,Myth Busters,1103328000,"12 18, 2004",2004,2462,"['Watching', 'Fess', 'Parker', '1950s', 'play', 'Davy', 'Crocket', 'Disney', 'series', 'made', 'John', 'Wayne', 'less', 'believable', '1960', 'Alamo', 'movie', 'Yes', 'am', 'old', 'still', 'open', 'minded', '1960s', 'was', 'era', 'historical', 'epic', 'film', 'typified', 'Spartacus', 'Ben-Hur', 'eventually', 'producing', 'period', 'classic', 'Doctor', 'Zhivago', 'Braveheart', 'big', 'budget', 'productions', 'mixed', 'minute', 'amount', 'real', 'history', 'valiant', 'action', 'portrayed', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'using', 'larger-than-life', 'actors', 'such', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Charlton', 'Heston.Davy', 'Crocket', 'was', 'mythical', 'hero', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'played', 'mythical', 'actor', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'John', 'Wayne', 'characters', 'died', 'swashbuckling', 'fashion', 'fitting', 'legend', 'Texans', 'state', 'demigods', 'proportions', 'Alamo', 'Fess', 'Parker', 'John', 'Wayne', 'demand', 'perfectly.Enter', 'historical/movie', 'stage', 'recently', 'discovered', 'manuscripts', 'portray', 'radically', 'different', 'end', 'Davy', 'Crocket', 'compatriots', 'Believe', 'be', 'actual', 'Mexican', 'officer', 'first-hand', 'account', 'not', 'manuscript', 'Crocket', 'was', 'captured', 'alive', 'then', 'executed', 'new', 'film', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'not', 'bogged', 'down', 'portrayed', '1960s', 'version', 'trying', 'subdue', 'Alamo', 'moving', 'rest', 'Texas', 'Instead', 'crafty', 'Mexican', 'dictator/generalissimo', 'intention', 'trap', 'Texicans', 'Alamo', 'then', 'draw', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'small', 'army', 'destine-to-fail', 'battle', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'terms', 'Houston', 'not', 'fall', 'pending', 'ambush', 'knowingly', 'Alamo', 'garrison', 'order', 'save', 'fledgling', 'Texas', 'army', 'Hence', 'Texas', 'becoming', 'province', 'Mexico', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'battle', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'finale', 'Alamo', 'story', 'rather', 'Davy', 'Crocket', 'swinging', 'musket', 'heroic', 'face', 'certain', 'annihilation', 'Alamo', 'was', 'not', 'genesis', 'independent', 'Texas', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'was.Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'portrayal', 'Davy', 'Crocket', 'man', 'trying', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'legend', 'best', 'been', 'done', 'sized', 'screen', 'weakly', 'acted', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'William', 'Travis', 'are', 'shown', 'men', 'trying', 'escape', 'pasts', 'remolding', 'new', 'land', 'want', 'see', 'action-packed', 'yee-haw', 'Alamo', 'get', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'want', 'deeper', 'probe', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'battle', 'Texican', 'Mexican', 'get', 'latest', 'edition']",N/A

Also I think the actors that played Bowie, Travis, Houston, and Crockett in this one did such a magnificent job. I can't believe the reviews did not reveal how powerful the film truly is. Also, it was wonderful to see the great battle of San Jacinto in this one.My only complaint is the politically correct and pretentious way the slaves of Bowie & Travis are shown.

The details are so miniscule that only one who has an intense understanding of the Alamo and all of the events surrounding it would know the difference. I've taken 7th grade Texas history, I'm no idiot, and I thought this movie was perfectly decent historically. Some things had to be altered minorly for cinematic purposes, which shouldn't be critiqued with extensive scrutiny. Everything about this movie is nothing short of spectacular.The acting- Amazing. Billy Bob Thornton was BORN to play David Crockett, and portrays it amazingly. I don't know why he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award, he did a marvelous job. Jason Patric, as Jim Bowie, also did a great job at portraying a mysterious enigma of history, which Jim Bowie without a doubt was. I was quite impressed by his performance. Patrick Wilson gives the second best performance in this movie, playing the fancy, dignified, yet courageous William Travis. Patrick Wilson isn't terribly famous, but he did amazing at this part. Some of the other, smaller roles had great actors too, like Jordi Molla playing Juan Seguin. The biggest letdown in this movie was Dennis Quaid. He was a TERRIBLE Sam Houston, absolutely abominable. He is generally a good actor, but he just...well, he just tried to hard in this movie. The gruff voice, the wanna-be intellectual statements, the fake fancy hairdo...none of it was good. I don't know why he was casted in this role. Other than him, the acting is exceptional.The scenery is stellar as well. Everything is amazing, I just felt the need to elaborate on the acting the most.Though most reviews proclaim this movie to be inaccurate and slow (though at times it is a bit slow), I still believe this movie to be the best interpretation of the incident at the Alamo yet, and probably ever.

810267,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001LYFHW,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 15]","**1/2In the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the area now known as the state of Texas was the scene of a massive tug-of-war between the Mexicans, who claimed ownership of the land, and the Americans who were determined to gain independence for the territory so that it could one day be subsumed into the new, ever expanding nation to the north.  The 1836 siege of the Alamo played a crucial role in determining the outcome of that struggle.  For it was here that a group of 187 Texans chose to make their stand against over 3,000 Mexican troops led by the famed Santa Anna - and lost their lives in the process.  This turned out to be a short-lived, pyrrhic victory for the Mexicans, however, for the totality and brutality of the slaughter so outraged the Texans that the phrase ""Remember the Alamo!"" quickly became the official rallying cry for Texas independence, which was won soon after.""The Alamo""'s all-star cast includes Patrick Wilson as William Travis, the Lieutenant Colonel who led the American forces; Jason Patric as James Bowie, the consumptive knife-fighter and leader of the Texas militia; Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crocket, the legendary Indian-fighter-turned-United-States-senator; and Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, who chose to sit out the siege but who managed to extract swift and total revenge against Santa Anna and the Mexican army a very short time later.The film is most effective when it deals with the history surrounding the event, even though a number of historians have raised serious objections as to the veracity of much of what is shown on screen.  Still, when virtually every single person is dead at the end of a battle, it is a little difficult to come up with the primary source, eyewitness testimony one would need to compile a reliable historical account of the incident.  Speculation is obviously going to play a very large part in any dramatic recreation of the event, so I think the moviemakers can be given some slack in this area.  However, it is as dramas that such movies are judged, and here ""The Alamo"" doesn't score nearly so well.  Admirably, it has attempted to see its larger-than-life characters in relatively life-sized terms, but in its attempt at humanizing the participants, it often winds up sentimentalizing them instead.  Crockett, in particular, falls victim to this problem.  So obsessed is he with playing down the near-mythological, iconic status his previous exploits have garnered for him, that he becomes little more than a simpering revisionist bore in the process.""The Alamo"" also suffers from a malady common to films based on well known historical events: that of knowing the end of the story going into the movie.  It leads to an even more serious problem here than it did in, say, ""Titanic,"" because, at least in that film, even though we knew beforehand that the ship was going to sink, at least we didn't know exactly which characters were going to go to their watery graves with her.  In the case of ""The Alamo,"" all we can do is wait for the final battle to commence and watch as each of the characters suffers a common fate.Because the majority of the film's 137-minute running time is taken up with the 13-day-long siege and standoff, the pacing often leans towards the desultory and the languid.  Most of the time is spent with the characters sitting around and waiting for help to arrive, not exactly a scenario designed to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement for the viewer.  Most of the acting is wooden and stiff, although Thornton brings a few nice touches to his portrayal of Crockett, even if his golly-gee-aren't-I-just-like-everyone-else boyishness begins to wear a mite thin after awhile.  There's also an undercurrent of xenophobia running through the film in its one-sided portrayal of the opposing forces.  Santa Anna, in particular, is reduced to the level of a stock villain, stopping just short of twirling his (admittedly nonexistent) moustache at moments of extreme dastardliness.  Needless to say, there's been very little attempt to humanize him.The actual climactic assault on the Alamo has been impressively mounted, although we are strangely unmoved by all the deaths we see happening before us.  Interestingly, it is only in a different scene - the one in which Houston's army chases some fleeing Mexican soldiers into a river, brutally and senselessly slaughtering them in the process - that the filmmakers capture the ugliness and madness of war.  More scenes like that might have made ""The Alamo"" less of a total rout for the audience than the Alamo was for those involved in the real thing.",2,"Forget ""The Alamo""",1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,4614,"['**1/2In', 'early', 'part', 'Nineteenth', 'Century', 'area', 'now', 'known', 'state', 'Texas', 'was', 'scene', 'massive', 'tug-of-war', 'Mexicans', 'who', 'claimed', 'ownership', 'land', 'Americans', 'who', 'were', 'determined', 'gain', 'independence', 'territory', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'subsumed', 'new', 'ever', 'expanding', 'nation', 'north', '1836', 'siege', 'Alamo', 'played', 'crucial', 'role', 'determining', 'outcome', 'struggle', 'was', 'here', 'group', '187', 'Texans', 'chose', 'make', 'stand', '3,000', 'Mexican', 'troops', 'led', 'famed', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'lost', 'lives', 'process', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'short-lived', 'pyrrhic', 'victory', 'Mexicans', 'however', 'totality', 'brutality', 'slaughter', 'so', 'outraged', 'Texans', 'phrase', 'Remember', 'Alamo', 'quickly', 'became', 'official', 'rallying', 'cry', 'Texas', 'independence', 'was', 'won', 'soon', 'Alamo', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'William', 'Travis', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'who', 'led', 'American', 'forces', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'James', 'Bowie', 'consumptive', 'knife-fighter', 'leader', 'Texas', 'militia', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Davey', 'Crocket', 'legendary', 'Indian-fighter-turned-United-States-senator', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'General', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'who', 'chose', 'sit', 'out', 'siege', 'who', 'managed', 'extract', 'swift', 'total', 'revenge', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'Mexican', 'army', 'very', 'short', 'time', 'later.The', 'film', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'history', 'surrounding', 'event', 'even', 'number', 'historians', 'have', 'raised', 'serious', 'objections', 'veracity', 'much', 'what', 'shown', 'screen', 'Still', 'when', 'virtually', 'single', 'person', 'dead', 'end', 'battle', 'little', 'difficult', 'come', 'up', 'primary', 'source', 'eyewitness', 'testimony', 'one', 'would', 'need', 'compile', 'reliable', 'historical', 'account', 'incident', 'Speculation', 'obviously', 'going', 'play', 'very', 'large', 'part', 'dramatic', 'recreation', 'event', 'think', 'moviemakers', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'slack', 'area', 'However', 'dramas', 'such', 'movies', 'are', 'judged', 'here', 'Alamo', ""n't"", 'score', 'nearly', 'so', 'well', 'Admirably', 'attempted', 'see', 'larger-than-life', 'characters', 'relatively', 'life-sized', 'terms', 'attempt', 'humanizing', 'participants', 'often', 'up', 'sentimentalizing', 'instead', 'Crockett', 'particular', 'victim', 'problem', 'So', 'obsessed', 'playing', 'down', 'near-mythological', 'iconic', 'status', 'previous', 'exploits', 'have', 'garnered', 'little', 'more', 'simpering', 'revisionist', 'bore', 'process', 'Alamo', 'also', 'malady', 'common', 'films', 'based', 'well', 'known', 'historical', 'events', 'knowing', 'end', 'story', 'going', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'problem', 'here', 'did', 'say', 'Titanic', 'least', 'film', 'even', 'knew', 'beforehand', 'ship', 'was', 'going', 'sink', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'watery', 'graves', 'case', 'Alamo', 'can', 'do', 'wait', 'final', 'battle', 'commence', 'watch', 'characters', 'common', 'fate.Because', 'majority', 'film', '137-minute', 'running', 'time', 'taken', 'up', '13-day-long', 'siege', 'standoff', 'pacing', 'often', 'towards', 'desultory', 'languid', 'Most', 'time', 'spent', 'characters', 'sitting', 'around', 'waiting', 'help', 'arrive', 'not', 'exactly', 'scenario', 'designed', 'provide', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'excitement', 'viewer', 'Most', 'acting', 'wooden', 'stiff', 'Thornton', 'few', 'nice', 'touches', 'portrayal', 'Crockett', 'even', ""golly-gee-aren't-I-just-like-everyone-else"", 'boyishness', 'wear', 'mite', 'thin', 'awhile', 'also', 'undercurrent', 'xenophobia', 'running', 'film', 'one-sided', 'portrayal', 'opposing', 'forces', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'particular', 'reduced', 'level', 'stock', 'villain', 'stopping', 'just', 'short', 'twirling', 'admittedly', 'nonexistent', 'moustache', 'moments', 'extreme', 'dastardliness', 'Needless', 'say', 'been', 'very', 'little', 'attempt', 'humanize', 'him.The', 'actual', 'climactic', 'assault', 'Alamo', 'been', 'impressively', 'mounted', 'are', 'strangely', 'unmoved', 'deaths', 'see', 'happening', 'Interestingly', 'only', 'different', 'scene', 'one', 'Houston', 'army', 'fleeing', 'Mexican', 'soldiers', 'river', 'brutally', 'senselessly', 'slaughtering', 'process', 'filmmakers', 'capture', 'ugliness', 'madness', 'war', 'More', 'scenes', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'Alamo', 'less', 'total', 'rout', 'audience', 'Alamo', 'was', 'involved', 'real', 'thing']",N/A
810268,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,B0001LYFHW,"Ron Braithwaite ""Hummingbird God""","[2, 2]","Nobody knows exactly what happened within the walls of Alamo during the siege.  Yes, we do have Travis' and a few other letters sent to Houston or others.  We also have the records of various couriers sent by Travis.  We have the testimony of Travis' slave, Joe, who seems to have sought safety immediately on the death of Travis.  We also have testimony--multiple, constnatly varying testimonies, really--of Susannah Dickenson, one of the women who survived the final assault.  The problem is that Dickenson's account--probably heavily influenced by different reporters--varied wildly over the years.  Of course, the women and small children survived the battle but few were in a position to view the final moments of battle.A major source of information is Mexican which is simultaneously part of the problem.  Col. Enrique de la Pena--an officer who not only despised Santa Ana but was encarcerated by the Generalissimo and eventually died in prison--reported that some Texans were taken prisoner and executed by sword-wielding Mexican soldatos at Santa Ana's commend.  The problem is that de la Pena described one prisoner who could have conceivably been Davy Crockett.  The Colonel described a tall frontiersman of regal bearing wearing [I think] a cap made of animal fur.  He died like a man, according to de la Pena.The problem is neither de la Pena nor any other Mexican knew anything about Davy Crockett at the time.  They certainly didn't realize that they had an ex-Congressman--a man of legendary exploits--bottled up in the fort.  Assuming that de la Pena was an accurate observer the 'tall frontiersman' could have described a number of men in the Alamo.  It might have even described Davy Crockett, although Crockett wasn't particularly tall.  This is the version the writers and directors of this of 'The Alamo' chose to follow and they might be right.  We'll never know because all the defenders at Alamo were killed and the dead tell no tales.I commend this movie because, although it is slow at the beginning, the writers, directors and producers seemed to make an honest effort to build and retell the tale as accurately--or almost as accurately--as possible.  Some Texas nationalists have tremendous problems with any kind of depiction of Texian P.O.W.s after the battle, especially if one of them was Davy Crockett.  I don't.  Virtually any man in Alamo--with the possible exception of William Barret Travis--would have surrendered at point of a bayonet IF given the opportunity to do so.  Most didn't have such an opportunity.  Many died on the spot.  Others, wounded or perhaps attempting to surrender, would have been slain by vengeful Mexican troops FOLLOWING SANTA ANA'S ORDERS of 'deguello'--no quarter.  If any Texans were actually taken prisoner it would have been strictly against Santa Ana's explicit orders.  Whether or not a Texan lived or died was primarily a function of the instincts of a particular Mexican fighter.As much as we might like to think so, 200 or so Texian troops weren't suicide troops, which is exactly what makes their story all the more remarkable and compelling.  The real moment of truth came NOT when Mexican troops were scaling the walls but, days earlier, when almost all Texians and Tejanos decided to stay despite the fact that such a decision was LIKELY to result in the death of every one of them.  These men weren't land-bound Kamikazes bound for Shintoist Heaven.  If anything this particular group of men was composed of even sterner stuff.By the way, one of these days somebody will make a film about the battle and aftermath of the Battle of Coleto outside of Goliad.  In terms of ginning up Texian hatred prior to, during and after the Battle at San Jacinto, Goliad was more significant than Alamo.  In San Antonio/Allamo two hundred men--knowing exactly what fate was in store for them--thumbed their nose at Santa Ana and died to the man.  At Goliad/Coleto--under the incompetent leadership of Fannin--400 Texas troops were ordered to surrender to Urrea, a Santa Ana cavalry general.  Urrea offered these men decent terms of surrender but Santa Ana--learning about it later--disavowed the terms and ordered all 400 murdered in cold blood.  This was a war crime of the first magnitude and, all by itself, warranted Santa Ana's execution.  As Houston said, however, ""I WANT TEXAS"", and Santa Ana, that third-rate general and first-class coward, signed away his country to save his own worthless hide.",5,Remember Goliad!,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,4470,"['Nobody', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'walls', 'Alamo', 'siege', 'Yes', 'do', 'have', 'Travis', 'few', 'other', 'letters', 'sent', 'Houston', 'others', 'also', 'have', 'records', 'various', 'couriers', 'sent', 'Travis', 'have', 'testimony', 'Travis', 'slave', 'Joe', 'who', 'have', 'sought', 'safety', 'immediately', 'death', 'Travis', 'also', 'have', 'testimony', 'multiple', 'constnatly', 'varying', 'testimonies', 'really', 'Susannah', 'Dickenson', 'one', 'women', 'who', 'survived', 'final', 'assault', 'problem', 'Dickenson', 'account', 'probably', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'different', 'reporters', 'varied', 'wildly', 'years', 'course', 'women', 'small', 'children', 'survived', 'battle', 'few', 'were', 'position', 'view', 'final', 'moments', 'battle.A', 'major', 'source', 'information', 'Mexican', 'simultaneously', 'part', 'problem', 'Col.', 'Enrique', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'officer', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'despised', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'was', 'encarcerated', 'Generalissimo', 'eventually', 'died', 'prison', 'reported', 'Texans', 'were', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'executed', 'sword-wielding', 'Mexican', 'soldatos', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'commend', 'problem', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'described', 'one', 'prisoner', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'conceivably', 'been', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Colonel', 'described', 'tall', 'frontiersman', 'regal', 'bearing', 'wearing', '[', 'think', 'cap', 'made', 'animal', 'fur', 'died', 'man', 'according', 'de', 'la', 'Pena.The', 'problem', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'other', 'Mexican', 'knew', 'anything', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'time', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'ex-Congressman', 'man', 'legendary', 'exploits', 'bottled', 'up', 'fort', 'Assuming', 'de', 'la', 'Pena', 'was', 'accurate', 'observer', ""'tall"", 'frontiersman', 'could', 'have', 'described', 'number', 'men', 'Alamo', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'described', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Crockett', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'tall', 'version', 'writers', 'directors', ""'The"", 'Alamo', 'chose', 'follow', 'might', 'be', 'right', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'defenders', 'Alamo', 'were', 'killed', 'dead', 'tell', 'tales.I', 'commend', 'movie', 'slow', 'beginning', 'writers', 'directors', 'producers', 'seemed', 'make', 'honest', 'effort', 'build', 'retell', 'tale', 'accurately', 'almost', 'accurately', 'possible', 'Texas', 'nationalists', 'have', 'tremendous', 'problems', 'kind', 'depiction', 'Texian', 'P.O.W.s', 'battle', 'especially', 'one', 'was', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'do', ""n't"", 'Virtually', 'man', 'Alamo', 'possible', 'exception', 'William', 'Barret', 'Travis', 'would', 'have', 'surrendered', 'point', 'bayonet', 'IF', 'given', 'opportunity', 'do', 'so', 'Most', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'such', 'opportunity', 'Many', 'died', 'spot', 'Others', 'wounded', 'perhaps', 'attempting', 'surrender', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slain', 'vengeful', 'Mexican', 'troops', 'FOLLOWING', 'SANTA', 'ANA', 'ORDERS', ""'deguello"", 'quarter', 'Texans', 'were', 'actually', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'strictly', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'explicit', 'orders', 'Whether', 'not', 'Texan', 'lived', 'died', 'was', 'primarily', 'function', 'instincts', 'particular', 'Mexican', 'fighter.As', 'much', 'might', 'like', 'think', 'so', '200', 'so', 'Texian', 'troops', 'were', ""n't"", 'suicide', 'troops', 'exactly', 'what', 'story', 'more', 'remarkable', 'compelling', 'real', 'moment', 'truth', 'came', 'NOT', 'when', 'Mexican', 'troops', 'were', 'scaling', 'walls', 'days', 'earlier', 'when', 'almost', 'Texians', 'Tejanos', 'decided', 'stay', 'fact', 'decision', 'was', 'LIKELY', 'result', 'death', 'one', 'men', 'were', ""n't"", 'land-bound', 'Kamikazes', 'bound', 'Shintoist', 'Heaven', 'anything', 'particular', 'group', 'men', 'was', 'composed', 'even', 'sterner', 'stuff.By', 'way', 'one', 'days', 'somebody', 'will', 'make', 'film', 'battle', 'aftermath', 'Battle', 'Coleto', 'Goliad', 'terms', 'ginning', 'up', 'Texian', 'hatred', 'prior', 'Battle', 'San', 'Jacinto', 'Goliad', 'was', 'more', 'significant', 'Alamo', 'San', 'Antonio/Allamo', 'two', 'hundred', 'men', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', 'fate', 'was', 'store', 'thumbed', 'nose', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'died', 'man', 'Goliad/Coleto', 'incompetent', 'leadership', 'Fannin', '400', 'Texas', 'troops', 'were', 'ordered', 'surrender', 'Urrea', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'cavalry', 'general', 'Urrea', 'offered', 'men', 'decent', 'terms', 'surrender', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'learning', 'later', 'disavowed', 'terms', 'ordered', '400', 'murdered', 'cold', 'blood', 'was', 'war', 'crime', 'first', 'magnitude', 'warranted', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'execution', 'Houston', 'said', 'however', 'WANT', 'TEXAS', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'third-rate', 'general', 'first-class', 'coward', 'signed', 'away', 'country', 'save', 'own', 'worthless', 'hide']",N/A

The character development of the mains was just enough as we found out a little about the personal lives of each (Travis, Bowie, Houston and Crockett) and each of these people were represented well by the actors that portrayed them.  We also get a look into the character of Santa Anna and his quest to be the Napoleon of the West. The battle scenes were extremely well done, and I feel this was a much more historically accurate telling of this battle for Texas freedom.

""The Alamo"" is a great film with great battle scenes and fine performances. While Billy Bob Thornton (as David Crockett), Jason Patric (as Jim Bowie), and Patrick Wilson (as William Travis) give exceptional performances, the highlight of the film in terms of acting is Dennis Quaid's exceptional portrayal of Sam Houston, the man who led Texas to victory at the battle of San Jacinto less than two months after the fall of the Alamo. The battle scenes, especially the pre-dawn attack on the Alamo and the battle of San Jacinto, are done with historical accuracy and epic sweep, putting you in the middle of these great conflicts. The DVD has some fantastic extras including historical commentary.

810277,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B0001LYFHW,The Mysterious Traveler,"[7, 14]","THE ALAMO(2004) Directed and written(in part) by John Lee Hancock.Starring Dennis Quaid(as Sam Houston), Jason Patric(as Jim Bowie), Patrick Wilson(as William Travis) and Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett.Though called The Alamo, the film is actually about the entire Texas War for Independence from the Declaration in the Texas Congress house straight through to the Battle of San Jacinto and Santa Annas signing away Mexican sovereignty over Texas with the Siege of the Alamo occupying the central position within the story. As such, the film is a condensing of MAN OF CONQUEST, the 1960 film THE ALAMO and a short Texas film called INDEPENDENCE.First the bad. Because it IS such condensing of so much material, the film feels a bit rushed and shallow. There are so many characters and so much going on that the film can never quite manage to make it a cohesive organic whole. Except for the above leads, no one else with exceptions to be discussed several paragraphs down ever quite become fully delineated. The Texas Congress scenes are cursory and do not succeed in conveying the desired information or establishing the proper historical figures. The film fails utterly to delineate, with exceptions, the defenders at the Alamo beside Travis, Bowie and Crockett so that when the battle comes and people start falling, the viewer does not feel a sense of tragedy but rather a sense of who was that again? The film would have done well to have a written scroll explaining the basic situation go straight to the Alamo, fully develop those characters and then end the film at the Eve of San Jacinto with Houston raising his sword and crying Remember the Alamo with a scroll explaining the outcome of the battle.Second. The score does not come ANYWHERE near that of the John Wayne film and is uninspirational and forgettable. Hancock does not do a completely successful job of establishing the geography of the battle so that when it begins, this viewer was never quite sure just where we were at any given moment. Generally one thought that Jim Bowie was mishandled both in the script and by Patric. Much of his dialogue made no sense and Patric is frequently unintelligible. Bowie comes across as a cranky jerk.Third. As with all things modern with film, it is hurt unnecessarily by Political Correctness and the Secret Liberal Censorship Codes. Besides Bowie, the film spends an inordinate amount of time attempting to deflate and cut down to size the great heroes being portrayed on the screen. Every character is a mess of some sort carrying around some modern style emotional problems that would require therapy. It never occurs to the film that these are great men doing great deeds but is rather more concerned with making them less threatening to a town and culture that could never conceive of fighting for freedom and democracy against oppression and wickedness, could never conceive of patriotism and self sacrifice and could never actually conceive of fighting period and find those who do highly threatening to their highly inflated self esteems. So these heroes must be brought down to their very low level and be made non-threatening.The film, in any case, makes a hash of explaining just what the Texans in general and the defenders of the Alamo are fighting for. If one did not know something coming into the film, one probably would have no idea after the film had ended. Travis is given a speech on the eve of the final assault that SHOULD explain what is at stake but instead gets all gummy and new age about fighting for your dreams. On the other hand, the film goes into great deal giving voice to the opposition stating several times that the Texans are pirates attempting to steal Mexican land and, in one case, accuse them of wanting to take over the world.Which brings us to.....Of the other defenders of the Alamo, the only two characters who are given any life of their own are the two Black slaves so we can hear about the stinking white man but since they play practically no part in the battle end up sucking dramatic screen time from the brave men around them who are putting their lives on the line. The film spends a great deal of time with the Mexicans on both sides especially in the Mexican army so that, in the end, the viewer is more familiar with far more members of the opposition that with the Texans who should be the heroes of the film. This also allows for some of the usual Liberal American hating propaganda to slip in and , as these things will always be, in such a manner as to make scenes and characters incomprehensible. There is one goofy scene where we are seeing Santa Anna(a rapist and mass murderer) going on about how his own soldiers are as disposable as chickens and then in the next line spouting Reconquista propaganda about how he is fighting to preserve Mexico for the grandchildren and great grandchildren from the evil Americans. This coming from the rapist mass murderer who considers Mexican lives as disposable as chickens. Then there is a simply ludicrous scene where one of the hispanic defenders of the Alamo says that while Santa Anna wants only to conquer Texas, the Texans want to conquer the whole world. Which is A) False and B) Stupid since the question immediately arises that if the Texans are such a global threat then just WHAT is this Hispanic doing fighting in their side??I know why all of the above rubbish is there.YOU know why the above rubbish is there.But it should NOT be there!Should it?On the plus side, the film looks reasonably well and succeeds on its big scenes. While never as moving as it should be, it is still affecting on a more restrained level. While the film neglects the glory of the struggle, the story has a power all its own that overcomes such omissions. The costumes are solid. One was not aware that the Alamo was a night battle. One thought that Quaid as Houston was very good as was the unknown to this viewer Wilson as Travis. One was particularly surprised to see Travis portrayed so favorably. He is usually characterized as a stiff martinet but here is played as a competent professional soldier. And as been observed by other, Thornton, as David Crockett, gives an Oscar worthy performance. While very different from earlier portrayals and one suspects foreign to history, Thornton plays Crockett with a sad bravery that one found very engaging. However the film makes the mistake of prolonging Thornton's death. It should have ended with the quick cut of Crockett swinging his musket as the Mexicans charge with their bayonets. The extra scene serves no real purpose except to eat up time and negate the power of the previous scene.Still over all, while not as good as the earlier mentioned efforts, this is a solid noble historical film that has little to be truly ashamed of and certainly worth ones time.",2,It is all Bush's fault!!!!,1336435200,"05 8, 2012",2012,6830,"['ALAMO', '2004', 'Directed', 'written', 'part',

810278,A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,B0001LYFHW,Theo Logos,"[81, 92]","If you want history, read some books. Let's get that out of the way first. There are many fine histories written on the battle of the Alamo, and disputing ideas about what exactly happened there. It is likely that, like Custer's Last Stand, the exact story of what went down at the Alamo will still be disputed by historians long after we all are dead.This movie is about mythology, not history. While the battle of the Alamo was a historical event, it long ago entered into the realm of American Myth. It is our Iliad. If we cannot win, this is how we want to die - not shirking our duty, but finding something heroic inside ourselves to rise to the occasion. That was portrayed well in this film. The principle players, Bowie, Crockett, and Travis, are not born heroes here. Instead, they are strong men with flaws and quirks of character like all the rest of us. When they are confronted by crisis, we see them rise beyond their flaws, their doubts, even their fears, and in their last moments truly become the heroes of the legend. This was captured powerfully in this film.An early scene shows Sam Houston speaking to Davy Crockett about Texas at a ball in Washington, near the end of Crockett's term in congress. Seeing the two together, an observer whispers to another man that either of those two might once have had a chance to be president, but no more. It is a nicely done scene accomplishing several things at once. First it allows us to see the two as men who had risen to a certain level of success and power, with some reason to expect more to come. It then shows us that before the fighting in Texas, both were men whose star was in decline, and who may have faded out of history had they not cast their lot with the Texicans. Finally, it establishes from the beginning that Davy Crockett was more than a coonskin hat-wearing cliche hero, and prepares us to see him played as a fully dimensional character. This is just one example out of many of how efficient and well made this movie is.The whole cast did a great job with their roles, but I thought that Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett delivered a particularly outstanding performance; one of the best of his career.  The role gave him many opportunities to shine, and he rose to the occasion. Chills ran down my spine when his Crockett stood like a chuckling Prometheus to answer the murderous music of the Deguello with his defiant fiddle. And in his death scene, he created a powerful alternative take on how a hero can die. Though it is one of the most controversial scenes of the film, I believe any man could be proud if they were able to meet death with such courage and defiant humor.The film has some flaws - much was edited out, and it leaves the story and character of Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston feeling choppy and incomplete. But taken as a whole, this is a powerful new take on a great American legend, not replacing, but adding to what went before. It has many layers and much nuance, and is a film which bears seeing more than once to take everything in. While not perfect, I can't give four and a half stars, so I give it five.Theo Logos",5,America's Iliad - re-imagined,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,3121,"['want', 'history', 'read', 'books', 'Let', 'get', 'way', 'first', 'are', 'many', 'fine', 'histories', 'written', 'battle', 'Alamo', 'disputing', 'ideas', 'what', 'exactly', 'happened', 'there', 'likely', 'Custer', 'Last', 'Stand', 'exact', 'story', 'what', 'went', 'down', 'Alamo', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'disputed', 'historians', 'long', 'are', 'dead.This', 'movie', 'mythology', 'not', 'history', 'battle', 'Alamo', 'was', 'historical', 'event', 'long', 'ago', 'entered', 'realm', 'American', 'Myth', 'Iliad', 'can', 'not', 'win', 'how', 'want', 'die', 'not', 'shirking', 'duty', 'finding', 'something', 'heroic', 'inside', 'rise', 'occasion', 'was', 'portrayed', 'well', 'film', 'principle', 'players', 'Bowie', 'Crockett', 'Travis', 'are', 'not', 'born', 'heroes', 'here', 'Instead', 'are', 'strong', 'men', 'flaws', 'quirks', 'character', 'rest', 'When', 'are', 'confronted', 'crisis', 'see', 'rise', 'flaws', 'doubts', 'even', 'fears', 'last', 'moments', 'truly', 'become', 'heroes', 'legend', 'was', 'captured', 'powerfully', 'film.An', 'early', 'scene', 'shows', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'speaking', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Texas', 'ball', 'Washington', 'end', 'Crockett', 'term', 'congress', 'Seeing', 'two', 'together', 'observer', 'whispers', 'man', 'two', 'might', 'once', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'be', 'president', 'more', 'nicely', 'done', 'scene', 'accomplishing', 'several', 'things', 'once', 'First', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'risen', 'certain', 'level', 'success', 'power', 'reason', 'expect', 'more', 'come', 'then', 'fighting', 'Texas', 'were', 'men', 'star', 'was', 'decline', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'faded', 'history', 'had', 'not', 'cast', 'lot', 'Texicans', 'Finally', 'beginning', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'was', 'more', 'coonskin', 'hat-wearing', 'cliche', 'hero', 'see', 'played', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'character', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'many', 'how', 'efficient', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'is.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'thought', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Crockett', 'delivered', 'particularly', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'role', 'gave', 'many', 'opportunities', 'shine', 'rose', 'occasion', 'Chills', 'ran', 'down', 'spine', 'when', 'Crockett', 'stood', 'chuckling', 'Prometheus', 'answer', 'murderous', 'music', 'Deguello', 'defiant', 'fiddle', 'death', 'scene', 'created', 'powerful', 'alternative', 'take', 'how', 'hero', 'can', 'die', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'scenes', 'film', 'believe', 'man', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'were', 'able', 'meet', 'death', 'such', 'courage', 'defiant', 'humor.The', 'film', 'flaws', 'much', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'story', 'character', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Sam', 'Houston', 'feeling', 'choppy', 'incomplete', 'taken', 'whole', 'powerful', 'new', 'take', 'great', 'American', 'legend', 'not', 'replacing', 'adding', 'what', 'went', 'many', 'layers', 'much', 'nuance', 'film', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'take', 'everything', 'not', 'perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'give', 'Logos']",N/A
810279,A2M597GCCE1N2S,B0001LYFHW,"the one and only ""david""","[3, 4]","The Alamo is a brilliant account of the 180 men that stood up against an army of thousands of soldiers who were trained to fight in brutal conditions while they themselves are mostly militia men with shotguns.Led by Col. William Travis [played by Patrick Wilson] they hold themselves up inside a church/mission that wasn't even built for warfare. Several of the buildings have been transformed into barracks and an infirmary. Most of the walls are crumbling and several of the buildings dont even have roofs on top.Nevertheless the men decide to stay and guard it as the Mexican army starts marching toward the town near the mission without the men's knowing. James Bowie [played by Jason Patric], famous for being a knife fighter and weilding a huge blade for a knife, wants to be in charge seeing how he doesn't like Travis.However his illness prevents him from really fighting anymore, he was shot and stabbed multiple times in his life, and soon is confined to his bed for the last half of the movie.Travis has problems of his own, and one of them includes getting the respect of his men. One scene does the impossible as a cannonball lands in the middle of the courtyard. No one goes near it, for fear of it exploding, but Travis gets up, cuts the fuse cord off the cannonball, and tells his men to fire it back at the enemy.His little act starts to give his men something to believe in and soon also even gets Bowie's respect for him as a leader, something that Travis really needed in order for him to keep his little militia together.Meanwhile the Mexican Army, led by their General Santa Anna, are shown by the Director's best at not being evil. It is mostly Santa Anna that is telling his soldiers to kill innocent people, not the soldiers themselves. Some of the Mexican soldiers are even little kids, who are way too young to go fight in battles and possibly be killed before they are even young adults.Even one of Santa Anna's own officers starts to think differently about Santa Anna. Especially after a little speech by the head General, in which he said that he was the one governing the rules and that he needed blood for victory.He said this after telling his men to lead their soldiers in an attack, rather than waiting for several cannons that were arriving only hours after the morning sun.But besides the acting one scene stole the show, as the Mexican army always used their band to sing a song that in English translated to ""Slit Throat."" This was right before they usually bombed the mission at night to keep the texans inside awake all night.But one night David Crockett [played by Billy Bob Thorton] decided to lighten the depressing tune of the song by climbing up a tower and playing his violin along with the music. And for one night, both sides decided just to listen to the music with its new sense of style and kept a short truce that night.This is a great movie with lots of drama and action scenes in it. The acting is one of the best I've seen, especially by Thorton, whos movies I dont really watch. Both sides are equally protrayed by the right actors and actresses for that matter as well. Plus several little storylines entwined here and there keeps this movie as exciting an moving as it started out.",4,A moving epic with great actors all throughout....,1104710400,"01 3, 2005",2005,3241,"['Alamo', 'brilliant', 'account', '180', 'men', 'stood', 'up', 'army', 'thousands', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'trained', 'fight', 'brutal', 'conditions', 'are', 'mostly', 'militia', 'men', 'shotguns.Led', 'Col.', 'William', 'Travis', '[', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', ']', 'hold', 'up', 'church/mission', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'built', 'warfare', 'Several', 'buildings', 'have', 'been', 'transformed', 'barracks', 'infirmary', 'Most', 'walls', 'are', 'crumbling', 'several', 'buildings', 'dont', 'even', 'have', 'roofs', 'top.Nevertheless', 'men', 'decide', 'stay', 'guard', 'Mexican', 'army', 'marching', 'town', 'mission', 'men', 'knowing', 'James', 'Bowie', '[', 'played', 'Jason', 'Patric', ']', 'famous', 'being', 'knife', 'fighter', 'weilding', 'huge', 'blade', 'knife', 'be', 'charge', 'seeing', 'how', ""n't"", 'like', 'Travis.However', 'illness', 'prevents', 'really', 'fighting', 'anymore', 'was', 'shot', 'stabbed', 'multiple', 'times', 'life', 'soon', 'confined', 'bed', 'last', 'half', 'movie.Travis', 'problems', 'own', 'one', 'getting', 'respect', 'men', 'One', 'scene', 'impossible', 'cannonball', 'middle', 'courtyard', 'one', 'fear', 'exploding', 'Travis', 'up', 'fuse', 'cord', 'cannonball', 'men', 'fire', 'back', 'enemy.His', 'little', 'act', 'give', 'men', 'something', 'believe', 'soon', 'also', 'even', 'Bowie', 'respect', 'leader', 'something', 'Travis', 'really', 'needed', 'order', 'keep', 'little', 'militia', 'Mexican', 'Army', 'led', 'General', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'are', 'shown', 'Director', 'best', 'not', 'being', 'evil', 'mostly', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'telling', 'soldiers', 'kill', 'innocent', 'people', 'not', 'soldiers', 'Mexican', 'soldiers', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'go', 'fight', 'battles', 'possibly', 'be', 'killed', 'are', 'even', 'young', 'adults.Even', 'one', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'own', 'officers', 'starts', 'think', 'differently', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'Especially', 'little', 'speech', 'head', 'General', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'governing', 'rules', 'needed', 'blood', 'victory.He', 'said', 'telling', 'men', 'lead', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'rather', 'waiting', 'several', 'cannons', 'were', 'arriving', 'only', 'hours', 'morning', 'sun.But', 'acting', 'one', 'scene', 'stole', 'show', 'Mexican', 'army', 'always', 'used', 'band', 'sing', 'song', 'English', 'translated', 'Slit', 'Throat', 'was', 'right', 'usually', 'bombed', 'mission', 'night', 'keep', 'texans', 'awake', 'night.But', 'one', 'night', 'David', 'Crockett', '[', 'played', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', ']', 'decided', 'lighten', 'depressing', 'tune', 'song', 'climbing', 'up', 'tower', 'playing', 'violin', 'music', 'one', 'night', 'sides', 'decided', 'just', 'listen', 'music', 'new', 'sense', 'style', 'kept', 'short', 'truce', 'night.This', 'great', 'movie', 'lots', 'drama', 'action', 'scenes', 'acting', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'especially', 'Thorton', 'whos', 'movies', 'dont', 'really', 'watch', 'sides', 'are', 'equally', 'protrayed', 'right', 'actors', 'actresses', 'matter', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'little', 'storylines', 'entwined', 'here', 'there', 'movie', 'exciting', 'moving', 'started', 'out']",N/A

If you're an Alamo fan, I recommend getting this 3-pack rather than just buying the three DVD's separately.  The Alamo Documentary discusses everything from the Alamo's history to its pop culture significance to the Alamo in the movies over the years.  There are countless interviews with Alamo historians and buffs which make it all very interesting.  &quot;Martyrs of The Alamo&quot; is D.W. Griffith's take on the birth of Texas.  If you can get past the completely racist depictions of Mexicans, this is an entertaining movie with surprisingly good battle scenes for 1915.  In Martyrs, the Texas War of Independence is started because a Mexican officer flirts with Susannah Dickinson.  &quot;Heroes of the Alamo&quot; is a B-western that tells the courageous story of the Alamo defenders from the Dickinson's perspective.  Alamo fans will love seeing these early depictions of the Alamo while also learning some new facts about the myths involved with the famous mission in San Antonio.The 3-pack DVD offers a ton of worthwhile extras that are not available anywhere else.  The Alamo documentary DVD includes an hour long documentary, a trailer from John Wayne's The Alamo, Remember The Alamo(an educational film made from a cut down Heroes of the Alamo) and a brief interview with Alamo buff Joe Musso.  The Martyrs of the Alamo DVD includes D.W. Griffith's movie, &quot;The Alamo, Shrine of Texas Liberty(a very low budget movie made at Mission San Jose in San Antonio), and a five-minute cartoon.  The Heroes of the Alamo DVD includes the movie, and the remaining footage from Davy Crockett At The Fall of The Alamo, a silent film starring Cullen Landis.

810282,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0001LYFHW,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","2004's The Alamo is one of the most undeserved flops of recent years (and possibly inflation-adjusted as big a disaster as Heaven's Gate). Bad timing may account or some of it, as America's image went from besieged victims to bloody aggressors (certainly it was barely even released outside the US), but the film's sombre, mournful tone is probably more to blame - beginning with the dead bodies of the defeated defenders, there's a sadness and inevitability to the film that's the complete antithesis of the feelgood destruction-and-revenge of Pearl Harbor. Even Carter Burwell's haunting low-key score is more a lament than the broad action scoring you might expect. The script is well crafted, the characterisation surprisingly strong and the comparative absence of cgi pays dividends with a level of verisimilitude that's been lacking from most recent epics.It also benefits from an extraordinary performance from Billy Bob Thornton as Davey (""He prefers David"") Crockett, a crowd-pleaser faced with having to live up to his own legend, and blessed with the film's best dialogue and it's best scene as he silences the Mexican guns with his fiddle. Thornton owns the film in a way I haven't seen from any actor for a long, long time. He's definitely the heart and soul of the movie.Thankfully, it's not quite a one-man show. Patrick Wilson does surprisingly well as Travis, Jason Patric's tediously one-note surliness is for once put to effective use as Bowie and the supporting cast is filled with great faces, all caught wonderfully by Dean Semler's superb cinematography. Only Dennis Quaid fares less well as Houston, failing to make much of his admittedly limited opportunities.True it falters somewhat after the fall of the Alamo, but it's still an impressive, intelligent and sometimes quietly moving epic that didn't deserve its fate at the box-office.",5,An elegant and elegiac epic,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,1862,"['2004', 'Alamo', 'one', 'most', 'undeserved', 'flops', 'recent', 'years', 'possibly', 'inflation-adjusted', 'big', 'disaster', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'Bad', 'timing', 'may', 'account', 'America', 'image', 'went', 'besieged', 'victims', 'bloody', 'aggressors', 'certainly', 'was', 'barely', 'even', 'released', 'US', 'film', 'sombre', 'mournful', 'tone', 'probably', 'more', 'blame', 'beginning', 'dead', 'bodies', 'defeated', 'defenders', 'sadness', 'inevitability', 'film', 'complete', 'antithesis', 'feelgood', 'destruction-and-revenge', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Even', 'Carter', 'Burwell', 'haunting', 'low-key', 'score', 'more', 'lament', 'broad', 'action', 'scoring', 'might', 'expect', 'script', 'well', 'crafted', 'characterisation', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'comparative', 'absence', 'cgi', 'pays', 'dividends', 'level', 'verisimilitude', 'been', 'lacking', 'most', 'recent', 'epics.It', 'also', 'benefits', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Davey', 'David', 'Crockett', 'crowd-pleaser', 'faced', 'having', 'live', 'up', 'own', 'legend', 'blessed', 'film', 'best', 'dialogue', 'best', 'scene', 'Mexican', 'guns', 'fiddle', 'Thornton', 'film', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actor', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'definitely', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie.Thankfully', 'not', 'quite', 'one-man', 'show', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Travis', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'tediously', 'one-note', 'surliness', 'once', 'put', 'effective', 'use', 'Bowie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filled', 'great', 'caught', 'wonderfully', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Only', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'less', 'well', 'Houston', 'failing', 'make', 'much', 'admittedly', 'limited', 'somewhat', 'fall', 'Alamo', 'still', 'impressive', 'intelligent', 'sometimes', 'quietly', 'moving', 'epic', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'fate', 'box-office']",N/A
810283,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001LYFHW,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","You may know that the new 'Alamo' film, directed by John Lee Hancock ('The Rookie') has met a commercial failure on US boxoffice chart.  But I think more stress should be given to 'commercial' rather than 'failure' because this 'Alamo' is not a total failure as the poor response of the audience implies.  It is good, though flawed.Actually, the acting is not only good, it's great.  You know the story of the Alamo, so I skip the story.  Billy Bob Thornton plays David Crocket, the legendary figure in the US history.  Sam Huston is played by Dennis Quiad, Jim Bowie by Jason Patrick while William Travis is portrayed by newcomer Patrick Wilson.  Each one of them gives memorable portraits of the characters you think you know.The strength of the film is this -- characters.  They are no longer larger-than-life pictures you should look up to; they are more flawed, more delicate, and more human.  On that score. Hancock's 'Alamo' is called a great success.  The famous episode of drawing a line with a sabre on the ground is not included.  Instead, David Crocket (who is not only good at shooting a rifle, but at playing the violin) does not die in the same way John Wayne did.  You like it or not, those attitudes represent the new film's intention.But there are weak points, and they clearly show.  Though the 137-minute film is comparatively short (I mean, compared with John Wayne's 3 hour epic), it feels still too long.  the film attempts to be 'mutli-layered,' or, to present the events from many ethnic viewpoints, but this, I believe, is a very misguided idea.  It not only involves the Mexican's views, but the Afro-Americans'.  That's honorable, but only shakes and confuses the film's viewpoint which should remain firm.  For, in the end, you're not sure what the film really wants to say.The photography of Dean Semler ('Dances with the Wolves') is Oscar-worthy, and the production designs of the fort and the fierce battle scenes are in themselves the state-of-the-art assets.  But the film is so unsure of its purpose to be made -- regarding this point, John Wayne's gung-ho 1960 'Alamo' was so sure of it --  and we audience sense that.  Perhaps, some materials cannot be touched in the new millenium, and 'The Alamo' might be telling us that fact.",3,"Good Photography, Great Characters with a Blurred Viewpoint",1097366400,"10 10, 2004",2004,2266,"['may', 'know', 'new', ""'Alamo"", 'film', 'directed', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'Rookie', 'met', 'commercial', 'failure', 'US', 'boxoffice', 'chart', 'think', 'more', 'stress', 'should', 'be', 'given', ""'commercial"", 'rather', ""'failure"", ""'Alamo"", 'not', 'total', 'failure', 'poor', 'response', 'audience', 'implies', 'good', 'flawed.Actually', 'acting', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'great', 'know', 'story', 'Alamo', 'skip', 'story', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'David', 'Crocket', 'legendary', 'figure', 'US', 'history', 'Sam', 'Huston', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quiad', 'Jim', 'Bowie', 'Jason', 'Patrick', 'William', 'Travis', 'portrayed', 'newcomer', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'one', 'memorable', 'portraits', 'characters', 'think', 'know.The', 'strength', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'longer', 'larger-than-life', 'pictures', 'should', 'look', 'up', 'are', 'more', 'flawed', 'more', 'delicate', 'more', 'human', 'score', 'Hancock', ""'Alamo"", 'called', 'great', 'success', 'famous', 'episode', 'drawing', 'line', 'sabre', 'ground', 'not', 'included', 'Instead', 'David', 'Crocket', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'shooting', 'rifle', 'playing', 'violin', 'not', 'die', 'same', 'way', 'John', 'Wayne', 'did', 'not', 'attitudes', 'represent', 'new', 'film', 'intention.But', 'are', 'weak', 'points', 'clearly', 'show', '137-minute', 'film', 'comparatively', 'short', 'mean', 'compared', 'John', 'Wayne', '3', 'hour', 'epic', 'still', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'attempts', 'be', ""'mutli-layered"", 'present', 'events', 'many', 'ethnic', 'viewpoints', 'believe', 'very', 'misguided', 'idea', 'not', 'only', 'Mexican', 'views', 'Afro-Americans', 'honorable', 'only', 'shakes', 'film', 'viewpoint', 'should', 'remain', 'firm', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'say.The', 'photography', 'Dean', 'Semler', ""'Dances"", 'Wolves', 'Oscar-worthy', 'production', 'designs', 'fort', 'fierce', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'state-of-the-art', 'assets', 'film', 'so', 'unsure', 'purpose', 'be', 'made', 'regarding', 'point', 'John', 'Wayne', 'gung-ho', '1960', 'was', 'so', 'sure', 'audience', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'materials', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'touched', 'new', 'millenium', 'Alamo', 'might', 'be', 'telling', 'fact']",N/A

The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to do too much in a short amount of time. What ends up happening is that instead of getting the overarching story of the Alamo and what it was about, one ends up with a hodge-podge of a movie tied around one place and one person, Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton). Make no mistake, though THE ALAMO includes a cast of Dennis Quaid, Jason Patric, and Patrick Wilson, it's Billy Bob Thornton who is the star of this movie. His portrayal of Crockett is a different take than is usually seen, but is perhaps the most realistic portrayal of Crockett seen on film; he injects a bit of humanity back into the legend that so many of us have come to know. Crockett really is the only completely developed character in the film, but there are scenes where some of the other main characters (Bowie, Travis, Juan Seguin) are fleshed out a little. It makes me think that the director, John Lee Hancock, had originally spent more time developing those characters, but because of the tight-schedule and the postponed release date when the film was first seen in theaters, he was not able to develop them as much as he wanted.The movie gives a decent background about the events surrounding the Alamo and why the battle came to be. There's also some fairly interesting conversations that take place among the various characters. These things are not necessarily bad things, but in a movie that's centered around the most legendary battle in Texas history, they don't fit well and slow the film down.Overall, I enjoyed THE ALAMO. I like the John Wayne version better, but there were things in this version that really made me think about the story in a new and different light. Especially of interest is the death of Crockett which presents an interesting idea. As far as I know, there are conflicting claims about how Crockett died and the version presented in this movie is one that is perfectly plausible and fits in quite well with how Crockett is portrayed throughout the rest of the movie. Whatever you think about Crockett's death, the movie is worth watching for Thornton's performance alone and for some of the minor historical details that have been kept in tact (such as clothing, musical composition, etc.).",3,"Here He Comes To Save the Day, Billy Bob Is On His Way",1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,2370,"['ALAMO', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'realm', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'movie', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'What', 'up', 'happening', 'instead', 'getting', 'overarching', 'story', 'Alamo', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'one', 'up', 'hodge-podge', 'movie', 'tied', 'one', 'place', 'one', 'person', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Make', 'mistake', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'cast', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'who', 'star', 'movie', 'portrayal', 'Crockett', 'different', 'take', 'usually', 'seen', 'perhaps', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Crockett', 'seen', 'film', 'bit', 'humanity', 'back', 'legend', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'Crockett', 'really', 'only', 'completely', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'Bowie', 'Travis', 'Juan', 'Seguin', 'are', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'think', 'director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'had', 'originally', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'tight-schedule', 'postponed', 'release', 'date', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'seen', 'theaters', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'develop', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'decent', 'background', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Alamo', 'why', 'battle', 'came', 'be', 'also', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'conversations', 'take', 'place', 'various', 'characters', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'things', 'movie', 'centered', 'most', 'legendary', 'battle', 'Texas', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'well', 'slow', 'film', 'down.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'ALAMO', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'better', 'were', 'things', 'version', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'story', 'new', 'different', 'light', 'Especially', 'interest', 'death', 'Crockett', 'interesting', 'idea', 'As', 'far', 'know', 'are', 'conflicting', 'claims', 'how', 'Crockett', 'died', 'version', 'presented', 'movie', 'one', 'perfectly', 'plausible', 'fits', 'quite', 'well', 'how', 'Crockett', 'portrayed', 'rest', 'movie', 'think', 'Crockett', 'death', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'Thornton', 'performance', 'alone', 'minor', 'historical', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'tact', 'such', 'clothing', 'musical', 'composition', 'etc']",N/A
810285,A16GAIJJE39T1S,B0001LYFHW,Ulfilas,"[1, 1]","This somewhat ironic take on the events surrounding The Battle of the Alamo is much to my liking, as is Billy Bob's Thornton's whimsical depiction of Davy Crockett (exhibiting a persona somewhat akin to that of 1930's cowboy philosopher Will Rogers).  As distinct from his portrayal by Fess Parker in the mid 1950's or that of John Wayne in the 1960 Alamo movie, Thornton plays the famous frontiersman in a way more in accord with the jocular tone that is associated with what is known of his personality and amusing quips.  Other reviewers have remarked on Crockett's parodying fiddle accompaniment of the Mexican army's grim bugle call ""Degueollo"" (cut-throat), signalling the intent to give the defenders of the Alamo no quarter--that is, to take no prisoners!This ironic tone is very much in keeping with actual historical events, as the defense of the Alamo, in military terms, was Quixotic at best rather than worthy of its characterization as ""The Thermopylae of the West"" in Texas hagiography.

Jason Patrick was also very good as Jim Bowie.

810287,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B0001LYFHW,V. Berk,"[6, 6]","4.5/5 StarsIn the last decade I don't think any film has been as overlooked or as underrated as 2004's The Alamo.  People have just been unnatural cruel to this film in ways I don't feel are warranted.  A $90-$95 million production budget, and between $40-60 million in advertising The Alamo made a gross of roughly $25 million in its theatrical run- the second biggest flop of all time.  The fact of the matter was that not many people were going to go out of their way to see a costume drama based on an event that only directly effects the history of a single state in the United States...But as a native Texan I can't help but be impressed by this film's attention to detail.  This isn't Hollywood's Alamo.  This is History's The Alamo.If you're born and raised in Texas few things are more important to our heritage than the siege of this Spanish-mission-turned-fort.  Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, James Bowie, William Travis, and Juan Seguin are shown as heroes to Texan children from a young age.  The Alamo and the defeat of Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto are the events that live in the hearts of every native Texan.  In our native state Texans are surrounded by the monuments, and in 7th grade we have a full year history course dedicated solely to the founding of Texas.  Before we were the 28th state Texas was the Republic of Texas and our state proudly teaches its children this fact.  Texans have a great amount of pride for their heritage.  This 2004 movie recreates history as accurately as possible.  Most of the actors are Texans, the director and producer are Texas- even the extras for the Alamo defenders, Republic of Texas army, and Mexican army are all natives to Texas.  By this the film possesses an enormous heart for it is clear that all those involved wanted to get history right.By getting history right The Alamo also sacrifices its chance of being a success for anyone who doesn't hold a passion for the events.The film gives just over an hour of exposition setting up the political climate of the events leading up to the battle.  This is dry at times and really I can understand why folks who could careless about the history would doze off during this portion of the film.  But once the siege begins I feel the film does a fine job at creating compelling action while doing their best at keeping it historically accurate.  Some things take suspension of disbelief (Crockett snipes off Santa Anna's epaulette) but the siege's attention to historical accuracy is outstanding.  It really captures the peril and claustrophobia that must have been felt by the defenders.  When Santa Anna's forces charge the Texan stronghold in the dead of night the entire situation dissolves into chaos.  Some have criticized the night siege (As opposed to previous film adaptations that changed the final siege to day) because of the lack of visibility.  I think it works perfectly because it thrusts the viewer straight into the confusion that no doubt occurred once the Alamo's walls were breached.The acting in The Alamo is a mixed bag and if anything is the only thing that keeps it from reaching true greatness.  All the principal actors have their key moments, but some get one good scene and that's it.Dennis Quaid, a native of Houston, Texas tries his best to make Houston a noble figure, but often comes across as being overly gruff in his portrayal.  He gets the warrior and general but doesn't capture enough of the gentlemen in his portrayal.  Jason Patric makes a fine James Bowie, and Patrick Wilson does an okay portrayal of William Travis, but when it comes time for Travis' ""line in the sand"" speech Wilson does a superb job that makes up for what is mostly a forgettable performance. Emilio Echevarria is villainous as he is despicable as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, capturing the image of a pompous dictator who believes he's on par with Napoleon Bonaparte, but he never takes the performance to campy levels.  He is perfectly believable as a man who simply is a sadistic creep.The stand-out performance of the film has to be Billy Bob Thornton as a humanized portrayal of David ""Davy"" Crockett.  Perhaps the best moment in the entire film is when, on the final night Crockett lifts his violin and plays a companion to the Mexican army's ""Deg&uuml;ello"" (slit-throat).  Thornton (who even learned to play the violin for the role) is a sophisticated Crockett, neither the folk legend, nor the heroic crusader (John Wayne).  Thornton's Crockett is a frontiersman turned gentleman and diplomat, but this in no way takes away from his heroism.  Crockett's valor and sacrifice resonates even deeper with a viewer when he can be related to.The Alamo has its flaws, but I believe that history buffs and Texans wishing to see the events adapted accurately will enjoy this film a great deal.  If anything the film should be seen for Billy Bob Thornton giving one of the best performances of his career.",5,Maybe its just a Texan thing,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,4930,"['4.5/5', 'StarsIn',

810288,APKYXHI9GA1UR,B0001LYFHW,"Viento Weathers ""Viento""","[0, 2]","I am a history major so I enjoyed The Alamo. However, it does get rather tedious. I've watched it at least three times since its release in 2004 and two of those times, I had to stop it in the middle and sleep for the night, then watch the end later. That may just be me, because I sometimes have insomnia and when I get tired, it's best for me to give in and rest, so I'm not sure if it means anything about the movie or if it was just coincidence in the times when I picked to watch it.Patrick Wilson as William Barret Travis played a very likeable character for someone who really had done pretty despicable things in his past. The movie reminds us that people often went west to start a new life and were sometimes running from and trying to escape their past. I do not know much about Travis as a historical figure, but after watching the movie, would like to do some research to learn more. Patrick Wilson made Travis seem rather wimpy but shows how Travis grew into his own as the events unfold.Billy Bob Thornton does an incredible job as Davy Crockett.  I learned a lot about Crockett from the movie. Thornton gives a human element to the legend making Crockett more than just the hero in a bunch of tall tales.My favorite was Jason Patric as James Bowie who is famous for his knife now popularly known as a Bowie knife. Now that's a knife! I like Jason Patric anyway, not just because he is damn good looking, but also because he is a damn good actor.  I read that he drank shots of Tabasco Sauce to make his performance at the end of The Alamo seem more believable. Now, that is  dedication to the craft! It definitely worked. He was my favorite character in the movie, not just because I have a crush on him.I liked the portrayal of the woman who tended to Bowie (the sister of Maria Ursula de Veramendi, Bowie's deceased wife) although I could not find her name in the credits. Ursula Veramendi is played by Safia Gray. You could see that the sister took care of Bowie because she was in love with him, not just because they were family.  Emilio Echevarria also did a good job making Santa Anna look like a real prick.Dennis Quaid is mediocre as Sam Houston. For such a great figure in history, you would think they could have found someone better for the role. He does a good job at the end when explaining reasons for not attacking sooner, but I felt he lacked something in the beginning of the movie. Then again, I'm not a big Dennis Quaid fan, so I may not be the best judge.I had forgotten that the Alamo was not just a fort, but was established as one of the famous missions of San Antonio--what survives today is the church. I also liked the use of the tree that one can still see if one tours the Alamo. I wondered about the set and how they filmed the movie.

That is $20 and two and a half hours I will never get back!",1,"Didn't anyone ever say, ""Hey, this screenplay sucks!""",1096934400,"10 5, 2004",2004,858,"['What', 'awful', 'depiction', 'such', 'historical', 'event.Sure', 'history', 'told', 'movie', 'more', 'acurate', 'John', 'Wayne', 'classic', 'BUT', 'important', 'was', 'absolutely', 'soul', 'feeling', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'thrown', 'up', 'movie', 'screen', 'very', 'little', 'backstory', 'are', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'developed.The', 'screenplay', 'jumps', 'middle', 'movie', 'are', 'begging', 'Mexican', 'soldiers', 'beat', 'living', 'hell', 'Texans', ""'M"", 'TEXAN', 'actual', 'seige', 'took', 'less', 'time', 'movie', 'prayed', 'be', 'casting', 'was', 'also', 'horrible', 'acting', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'actors', 'own', 'respective', 'previous', 'works', 'What', 'shame', 'involved.All', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'was', '0', 'return', 'investment', '20', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back']",N/A
810292,A14QS0VEMJTCI3,B0001LYFHW,W. Wood,"[2, 3]","One of the first movies I remember going to see as a child was John Wayne's Alamo at the Drive-in. Since then, whenever I think of the Alamo I think of John Wayne and Richard Widmark. And the music.  Dmitri Tiomkin's score has to rank as one of the best. Though for one reason or another John Wayne's film was deprived of the recognition many believe it deserves, the film has earned a rightful place as a classic. How the Alamo SHOULD have happened. I suppose every film about the Alamo since then must be prepared to stand the comparison with John Wayne's film.Therefore, one has to admire the courage of the people involved in the making of this version of those thirteen history changing days. I remember the controversy surrounding the film as it was being made and when it was released. As a history teacher I am keenly aware of the assault on the ""sacred"" story by a combination of modern scholarship, revisionist historians, and (shudder) the demon of political correctness. What kind of hack-job was Hollywood and Disney about to release on us now?So it was with some relief I left the movie theater after seeing the film. Disney had done a pretty fair job of telling the story of the Alamo, showing respect to all sides (sorry if the folks in Mexico City were disappointed) without pandering to any; respecting the heroism of the defenders of the Alamo; and showing respect to modern scholarship without diminishing the legend.Yet, I still found myself disappointed with this movie. I kept wishing it would have been longer (though length doesn't necessarily improve a bad film - just watch the TV miniseries ""Thirteen Days of Glory"" though Raul Julia's Santa Ana is a work of genius).  I've read where the film was cut back from the original three hours to little over two. I can't help but wish they'd kept the other hour for character development, maybe then I would feel more empathy when the Alamo's defenders fall. I can't help but go back to John Wayne's version which appears to meander through some two and a half hours getting to the climactic scene- but at the end, you can't help but feel sadness- as if you've lost friends. Maybe its the music as Susannah Dickenson is escorted out of the mission, I don't know, but whatever it is, it's missing from this film in spite of excellent performances by all players and a sincere effort on the part of all involved to tell the story as a tribute to those fallen (see the special features on the DVD).I think Billy Bob Thornton has nailed David Crockett (just as Julia nailed Santa Ana in a previous version); Emilio Echevarria playing Santa Ana does a great job of capturing one of history's most itriguing enigmas, the final battle scene is great, but something is missing; more time on the characters, more time on the story itself, maybe a different score. Maybe all of those things.  What you get, though, is a really good movie and telling of the story - but not a great one.I find myself thinking as I show it to my high school history class that I wish they'd release the longer version on DVD. Maybe a director's cut?",4,What might have been...,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,3092,"['One', 'first', 'movies', 'remember', 'going', 'see', 'child', 'was', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Alamo', 'Drive-in', 'then', 'whenever', 'think', 'Alamo', 'think', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'music', 'Dmitri', 'Tiomkin', 'score', 'rank', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'reason', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'was', 'deprived', 'recognition', 'many', 'believe', 'film', 'earned', 'rightful', 'place', 'classic', 'How', 'Alamo', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'happened', 'suppose', 'film', 'Alamo', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'prepared', 'stand', 'comparison', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film.Therefore', 'one', 'admire', 'courage', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'version', 'thirteen', 'history', 'changing', 'days', 'remember', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'history', 'teacher', 'am', 'keenly', 'aware', 'assault', 'sacred', 'story', 'combination', 'modern', 'scholarship', 'revisionist', 'historians', 'shudder', 'demon', 'political', 'correctness', 'What', 'kind', 'hack-job', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'Disney', 'release', 'now', 'was', 'relief', 'left', 'movie', 'theater', 'seeing', 'film', 'Disney', 'had', 'done', 'pretty', 'fair', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'Alamo', 'showing', 'respect', 'sides', 'sorry', 'folks', 'Mexico', 'City', 'were', 'disappointed', 'pandering', 'respecting', 'heroism', 'defenders', 'Alamo', 'showing', 'respect', 'modern', 'scholarship', 'diminishing', 'legend.Yet', 'still', 'found', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'kept', 'wishing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'length', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'improve', 'bad', 'film', 'just', 'watch', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Thirteen', 'Days', 'Glory', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'work', 'genius', ""'ve"", 'read', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'back', 'original', 'three', 'hours', 'little', 'over', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wish', ""'d"", 'kept', 'other', 'hour', 'character', 'development', 'maybe', 'then', 'would', 'feel', 'more', 'empathy', 'when', 'Alamo', 'defenders', 'fall', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'go', 'back', 'John', 'Wayne', 'version', 'meander', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'getting', 'climactic', 'scene-', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sadness-', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'music', 'Susannah', 'Dickenson', 'escorted', 'mission', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'missing', 'film', 'spite', 'excellent', 'performances', 'players', 'sincere', 'effort', 'part', 'involved', 'tell', 'story', 'tribute', 'fallen', 'see', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'think', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'nailed', 'David', 'Crockett', 'just', 'Julia', 'nailed', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'previous', 'version', 'Emilio', 'Echevarria', 'playing', 'Santa', 'Ana', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'one', 'history', 'most', 'itriguing', 'enigmas', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'great', 'something', 'missing', 'more', 'time', 'characters', 'more', 'time', 'story', 'maybe', 'different', 'score', 'Maybe', 'things', 'What', 'get', 'though', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'telling', 'story', 'not', 'great', 'one.I', 'find', 'thinking', 'show', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'class', 'wish', ""'d"", 'release', 'longer', 'version', 'DVD', 'Maybe', 'director', 'cut']",N/A
