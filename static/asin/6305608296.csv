Treat ""DrMajorBob""","[2, 2]","I don't ask for much in a vampire movie --- vampires who aren't messy eaters, some kind of romantic connection between sex and vampirism (it's central to the myth, really), and characters that make some kind of sense.  On most counts, &quot;Embrace the Darkness&quot; succeeds.  Admittedly, it is more about T&amp;A than vampirism, but it succeeds in that genre too.  As for the babes ... to each his own, but to my way of thinking, two or three of the most beautiful women ON THE PLANET are in this movie.",4,"Above average vampire-flick, FAR above average babes.",1001203200,"09 23, 2001",2001,506,"['do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'vampire', 'movie', 'vampires', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'messy', 'eaters', 'kind', 'romantic', 'connection', 'sex', 'vampirism', 'central', 'myth', 'really', 'characters', 'make', 'kind', 'sense', 'most', 'counts', 'quot', 'Embrace', 'Darkness', 'quot', 'Admittedly', 'more', 'T', 'amp', 'vampirism', 'genre', 'too', 'babes', 'own', 'way', 'thinking', 'two', 'three', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'PLANET', 'are', 'movie']",Embrace the Darkness
470618,A2ZKEBPCKEHDGL,6305608296,C McGhee,"[0, 0]",First this movie is not about vampires that are erotic. See Hammer Horror for that. What this DVD is about is sexpires that unfortunately have to suck blood once in a while. If it wasn't for the blood thing they are saddled with they would just screw like hyper-sexual humans.Embrace the Darkness they call it? In the title seen the guy seemed to find the darkness in the vaginal area. At the blood bank that guy also seemed to find the darkness in the vaginal area. In fact everyone in this show whether alone or together finds the darkness in the crotch. I thought why not put a little night light in there with the wiring in the basement? Surely everyone could then see the light quicker than they were seeing the dark.Really though to sell this as a vampire movie is a bit of a stretch. When they want to screw more than all the world this then is a porn movie & goodness its only soft porn at that. That makes it neither good porn nor a good vampire film. Queen of the Damned makes this look like the weak effort it is. Queen of the Damned didn't even get finished as the star of that died. Too bad it didn't happen here. Remember that both movies have the vampire missing mortality & vampires involved with sex themes. It's just that Queen's works. This one doesn't. Don't forget Blade & its sexual themes.Strangely enough I'm not gonna say this could not have been marketed as a unusual film but it needs a different Title & a different marketing gimmick. Most of the vampire market isn't gonna be impressed by this lame kitten licking milk vampire clan that thinks go for the gnads not go for the throat. This is soft porn & must be aggressively marketed to that crowd. I believe they would have obtained more sales as a result. I'm no prude. I own Caligula & the hardcore version of Alice in Wonderland. I got sick of the reluctant vampire early on & the show went down (pun intended) from there. I could of easily rated this movie one star but the girls are pretty & have erectile tissue in their nipples so we'll raise them (they do have two?) to a two. If you like soft porn this will do you well. If you like tension & evil avoid at all costs.2 disappointed points ur-ahh Stars!,2,Where is the Darkness?,1266364800,"02 17, 2010",2010,2191,"['First', 'movie', 'not', 'vampires', 'are', 'erotic', 'See', 'Hammer', 'Horror', 'What', 'DVD', 'about', 'sexpires', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'suck', 'blood', 'once', 'while', 'was', ""n't"", 'blood', 'thing', 'are', 'saddled', 'would', 'just', 'screw', 'hyper-sexual', 'humans.Embrace', 'Darkness', 'call', 'title', 'seen', 'guy', 'seemed', 'find', 'darkness', 'vaginal', 'area', 'blood', 'bank', 'guy', 'also', 'seemed', 'find', 'darkness', 'vaginal', 'area', 'fact', 'everyone', 'show', 'alone', 'together', 'darkness', 'crotch', 'thought', 'why', 'not', 'put', 'little', 'night', 'light', 'wiring', 'basement', 'Surely', 'everyone', 'could', 'then', 'see', 'light', 'quicker', 'were', 'seeing', 'dark.Really', 'sell', 'vampire', 'movie', 'bit', 'stretch', 'When', 'want', 'screw', 'more', 'world', 'then', 'porn', 'movie', 'goodness', 'only', 'soft', 'porn', 'neither', 'good', 'porn', 'good', 'vampire', 'film', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'look', 'weak', 'effort', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'finished', 'star', 'died', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'Remember', 'movies', 'have', 'vampire', 'missing', 'mortality', 'vampires', 'involved', 'sex', 'themes', 'just', 'Queen', 'works', 'one', ""n't"", 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Blade', 'sexual', 'themes.Strangely', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'say', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'unusual', 'film', 'different', 'Title', 'different', 'marketing', 'gimmick', 'Most', 'vampire', 'market', ""n't"", 'gon', 'be', 'impressed', 'lame', 'licking', 'milk', 'vampire', 'clan', 'go', 'gnads', 'not', 'go', 'throat', 'soft', 'porn', 'must', 'be', 'aggressively', 'marketed', 'crowd', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'obtained', 'more', 'sales', 'result', ""'m"", 'prude', 'own', 'Caligula', 'hardcore', 'version', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'got', 'sick', 'reluctant', 'vampire', 'early', 'show', 'went', 'down', 'pun', 'intended', 'there', 'could', 'easily', 'rated', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'girls', 'are', 'pretty', 'have', 'erectile', 'tissue', 'nipples', ""'ll"", 'raise', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'two', 'like', 'soft', 'porn', 'will', 'do', 'well', 'like', 'tension', 'evil', 'avoid', 'costs.2', 'disappointed', 'points', 'ur-ahh', 'Stars']",Embrace the Darkness

470620,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,6305608296,Joshua Koppel,"[4, 6]","Sex and death are two powerful forces and erotic horror loves to mix the two.  This movie is no exception.Here we have two vampires.  One is male, calm and careful.  The other is female, wild and dangerous.  They have just moved to LA.  Their personality types clash as she wants only blood from fresh victims (usually those she has had sex with) while he is content with bagged blood from the local blood bank.Enter a pretty performance artist next door and her reporter ex-boyfriend and you get a fairly typical vampire story where obsession leads to death.The vampires themselves are a little different.  They can teleport, open doors without touching them and make their clothes jump onto their bodies.There are lots of sex scenes in this film and plenty of nudity.  Plenty of sex with the vampires and mortals (although most of them are drained in more than one way afterward).This is an o-kay film with both halves working well.  The acting is pretty good and the cast is attractive.  The DVD has absolutely no special features but at least has tracks.
