999153,A1P27BGF8NAI29,B000G6BM0U,Alice in Wonderland,"[0, 1]","Peter Bowles is one of the great old warhorses of British stage and television acting. He has appeared in numerous roles over the years, and one of the greatest was his role as Major Yeates, the bumbling but well-meaning British Resident Magistrate in turn of the 20th century Ireland. And opposite the solid and well-played Yeates is Bryan Murray in the role of Florence McCarthy Knox, an impudent and troublesome leprechaun of a man who is used to getting what he wants. Together with a whole host of other characters, they lead a trouble-filled and yet entirely hilarious life on the Emerald Isle.This is a very funny television show, filled with lots of good humor and drama - excellently produced and acted.

The hero of the story is a minor British official, a man thoroughly decent and likable, though a bit bumbling at times.  In episode after episode, we see him tricked and humiliated by the Irish people he tries to serve.  If that sounds appealing, well, join in the fun and buy this series.  I found it minimally amusing and continuously irritating.  (The Irish scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous, and the actors are competent.)  The Irish people should rise up and complain.  But perhaps they're all too drunk and nasty.",3,Irish anti-defamation league,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,665,"['enjoy', 'common', 'British', 'stereotype', 'Irish', 'devious', 'drunken', 'superstitious', 'thieving', 'liars', 'then', 'show', 'hero', 'story', 'minor', 'British', 'official', 'man', 'thoroughly', 'decent', 'likable', 'bit', 'bumbling', 'times', 'episode', 'episode', 'see', 'tricked', 'humiliated', 'Irish', 'people', 'serve', 'appealing', 'well', 'join', 'fun', 'buy', 'series', 'found', 'minimally', 'amusing', 'continuously', 'irritating', 'Irish', 'scenery', 'other', 'hand', 'gorgeous', 'actors', 'are', 'competent', 'Irish', 'people', 'should', 'rise', 'up', 'complain', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'too', 'drunk', 'nasty']",The Irish R.M. - Complete Series

999156,AVVEJC75BWYD1,B000G6BM0U,Piping Davey,"[2, 3]","I saw this series some years back on PBS ""Masterpiece Theatre"".  It is completely and utterly delightful.  The English, Irish, Scots (so many of the people of the British Aisles - Welsh, too, I am sure) have such a wonderful gift of turning a quaint and colorful phrase.  There is a scene somewhere in the series along a country roadside where a lower-class Irish bloke is attempting to be familiar in a loud and somewhat grating manner with a high-class Irish lady riding in her carriage.  The lady responds to the low-class fellow in an inimitable manner that only a Brit could do.  She said something to the effect that ""Just because you and I are both Irish doesn't mean we're old friends"".  I Loved it.And so will you.",5,So Utterly Delightful.......,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,723,"['saw', 'series', 'years', 'back', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'completely', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'English', 'Irish', 'Scots', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'British', 'Aisles', 'Welsh', 'too', 'am', 'sure', 'have', 'wonderful', 'gift', 'turning', 'quaint', 'colorful', 'phrase', 'scene', 'somewhere', 'series', 'country', 'roadside', 'where', 'lower-class', 'Irish', 'bloke', 'attempting', 'be', 'familiar', 'loud', 'somewhat', 'grating', 'manner', 'high-class', 'Irish', 'lady', 'riding', 'carriage', 'lady', 'low-class', 'fellow', 'inimitable', 'manner', 'only', 'Brit', 'could', 'do', 'said', 'something', 'effect', 'Just', 'are', 'Irish', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'old', 'friends', 'Loved', 'it.And', 'so', 'will']",The Irish R.M. - Complete Series
999157,A2329GPAT2XIIZ,B000G6BM0U,Ultimate Reviewer,"[0, 1]","'The Irish RM' catches the unique charm of the Irish - the loveable rogues and rascals, the scheming and the religious superstition all serve to make a wonderful backdrop for a charming, little series. A resident magistrate from England provides the contrast, and serves as comment, as he tries to come to make sense of the new environment in which he finds himself. While it is set at the turn of the century, I imagine that charm is timeless. The characters work beautifully together, and that with clever scripting make for a very pleasing show, and bit of escapism. So why four stars and not five? Series Three, that's why! One of the reasons why the first two series worked so well was due to the relationship between Sinclair and Phillipa, the major's touchstone. But when she disappeared from the show in the third series, and replaced with another female character (or two) it left the show lacking. The attempts at creating minor love interests, or the hint of them, don't ring true due to the bond that came through so clearly between the major and his wife. A good show that lived on a series past its sell by date, but it is classic British TV and well worth adding to your library. Best episode in my opinion is Series Two, 'A Royal Command'; low point - the silly row in the last episode.",4,Good Comedy That Knew When To Throw In The Towel,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,1302,"['Irish', 'RM', 'catches', 'unique', 'charm', 'Irish', 'loveable', 'rogues', 'rascals', 'scheming', 'religious', 'superstition', 'serve', 'make', 'wonderful', 'backdrop', 'charming', 'little', 'series', 'resident', 'magistrate', 'England', 'contrast', 'comment', 'come', 'make', 'sense', 'new', 'environment', 'set', 'turn', 'century', 'imagine', 'charm', 'timeless', 'characters', 'work', 'beautifully', 'together', 'clever', 'scripting', 'make', 'very', 'pleasing', 'show', 'bit', 'escapism', 'So', 'why', 'four', 'stars', 'not', 'five', 'Series', 'Three', 'why', 'One', 'reasons', 'why', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'due', 'relationship', 'Sinclair', 'Phillipa', 'major', 'touchstone', 'when', 'disappeared', 'show', 'third', 'series', 'replaced', 'female', 'character', 'two', 'left', 'show', 'lacking', 'attempts', 'creating', 'minor', 'love', 'interests', 'hint', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'due', 'bond', 'came', 'so', 'clearly', 'major', 'wife', 'good', 'show', 'lived', 'series', 'sell', 'date', 'classic', 'British', 'TV', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'library', 'Best', 'episode', 'opinion', 'Series', 'Two', 'A', 'Royal', 'Command', 'low', 'point', 'silly', 'row', 'last', 'episode']",The Irish R.M. - Complete Series
