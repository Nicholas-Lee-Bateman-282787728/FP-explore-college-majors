I enjoyed the racial and cultural diversity in the cast and the reactions of the characters was so realistic because of the script and superb acting. It started out slow but really started to heat up once you realize what is going on.  I personally did not feel like the last. scene fit but the rest of the movie was so interesting I skipped back a few times.  I rented on Amazon Prime.,5,Surprisingly Entertaining Movie!,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,477,"['completely', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'said', 'movie', 'realistic', 'entertaining', 'enjoyed', 'racial', 'cultural', 'diversity', 'cast', 'reactions', 'characters', 'was', 'so', 'realistic', 'script', 'superb', 'acting', 'started', 'out', 'slow', 'really', 'started', 'heat', 'up', 'once', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'last', 'scene', 'fit', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'skipped', 'back', 'few', 'times', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'Prime']",N/A

1605611,AYWDYNQRLHV3Q,B00A47BU26,J. Carroll,"[0, 0]","Good movie about a woman scorned...or 7 women scorned after a ball player blindsides(dismisses without notice) his current girlfriend for a younger, prettier, naive newcomer. I won't give away spoilers but the story unfolds as the scorned ex, her cousin and some other willing participants decide to break up these bromancing ballers pack and expose them for the dirty dogs they are! Good movie, suprisingly good cast, and even though you may feel you've seen similar films/shows regarding this topic before (hence The Game, Basketball wives,ect.) There's a few unexpected twists that keeps the storyline interesting from start to finish and all of the cast really pulled their weight. I really enjoyed seeing Adrienne Bailon and Denyce Lawton do their thing after seeing them both on their reality shows. The only thing I would like to see different is the ending, it was good but it kind of leaves you to guess what happens with the rest of the cast. It's like they ran out of film and decided where they stopped was good enough, an extra 30 minutes to conclude everyone's life post the blowout would have been nice but hopefully this means there will be a sequel and if so hopefully it's with all the same cast members. I feel like this could produce maybe 2 or 3 more sequels or maybe even a cable network series.",4,Hope there's a sequel!,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1317,"['Good', 'movie', 'woman', 'scorned', '7', 'women', 'scorned', 'ball', 'player', 'blindsides', 'dismisses', 'notice', 'current', 'girlfriend', 'younger', 'prettier', 'naive', 'newcomer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'story', 'scorned', 'ex', 'cousin', 'other', 'willing', 'participants', 'decide', 'break', 'up', 'bromancing', 'ballers', 'pack', 'expose', 'dirty', 'dogs', 'are', 'Good', 'movie', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'cast', 'even', 'may', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'similar', 'films/shows', 'regarding', 'topic', 'hence', 'Game', 'Basketball', 'ect', 'few', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'storyline', 'interesting', 'start', 'finish', 'cast', 'really', 'pulled', 'weight', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Adrienne', 'Bailon', 'Denyce', 'Lawton', 'do', 'thing', 'seeing', 'reality', 'shows', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'different', 'ending', 'was', 'good', 'kind', 'leaves', 'guess', 'what', 'rest', 'cast', 'ran', 'film', 'decided', 'where', 'stopped', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'extra', '30', 'minutes', 'conclude', 'everyone', 'life', 'post', 'blowout', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'so', 'hopefully', 'same', 'cast', 'members', 'feel', 'could', 'produce', 'maybe', '2', '3', 'more', 'sequels', 'maybe', 'even', 'cable', 'network', 'series']",N/A
