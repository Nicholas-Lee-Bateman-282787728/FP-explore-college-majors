396700,A34PAZQ73SL163,6304028512,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[5, 6]","This is an infinitely watchable, very well done documentary about the mystery that was Vichy France. It's a perfect companion to Ophul's The Sorrow and the Pity. There really is not a central narrative here as they let the films speak for themselves. They really do tell one just about everything they need to know about the weird mix of fascism and bureaucracy that was Vichy. Occasionally, the director provides a little voiceover clarification but basically the propagandistic era reveals itself to viewers slowly. Overall, there is some absolutely outstanding stuff here and it is valuable primary source material. I just read a biography of Petain but I have to say I never realized how depressed and despondent his speeches were from that the era. It is funny to see what sort of thing passed for political inspiration back in those days because Petain basically spent most of his time putting down his fellow citizens in these clips.",5,Collaboration Ground Zero.,1185321600,"07 25, 2007",2007,940,"['infinitely', 'watchable', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'mystery', 'was', 'Vichy', 'France', 'perfect', 'companion', 'Ophul', 'Sorrow', 'Pity', 'really', 'not', 'central', 'narrative', 'here', 'let', 'films', 'speak', 'really', 'do', 'tell', 'one', 'just', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'weird', 'mix', 'fascism', 'bureaucracy', 'was', 'Vichy', 'Occasionally', 'director', 'little', 'voiceover', 'clarification', 'basically', 'propagandistic', 'era', 'reveals', 'viewers', 'slowly', 'Overall', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'stuff', 'here', 'valuable', 'primary', 'source', 'material', 'just', 'read', 'biography', 'Petain', 'have', 'say', 'never', 'realized', 'how', 'depressed', 'despondent', 'speeches', 'were', 'era', 'funny', 'see', 'what', 'sort', 'thing', 'passed', 'political', 'inspiration', 'back', 'days', 'because', 'Petain', 'basically', 'spent', 'most', 'time', 'putting', 'down', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'clips']",The Eye of Vichy VHS

Adams ""History buff""","[19, 38]","Admittedly this film is propaganda produced during an occupation by fascist Germany, but it is very educational in explaining why more Americans were probably killed by the French during WWII than were saved by them. But this film shows us what the Vichy government was producing in the way of propaganda, not what the Germans made them do.  Including the Northern Africa campaign of serious battles where Allied forces were attacked by French military loyal to Petain's Vichy government, as well as the millions of Frenchmen who assisted the Nazi war machine in their munitions factories, there is no question that the French were more the enemy of the Allies than they would ever be willing to admit today. For anyone who thinks that French diplomatic treachery is a new phenomenon in the war against Islamofascism, they should see this film. No wonder Chabrol was widely condemned in France for shining the light on this ugly chapter in French history. It is something any nation should be ashamed of. But unfortunately they have learned nothing from their ignominy as well documented by their own propagandists.  Hollywood did a great job of fooling the world into thinking that the ""Free French"" were in the majority fighting German occupation, but in fact the vast majority supported Petain and his fellow collaborators until the tide was turning in favor of the Allies. But what's new? If you are interested in this subject Robert Paxton's book ""Vichy France"" is even more of an eye opener.",5,A nation without shame,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,1497,"['Admittedly', 'film', 'propaganda', 'produced', 'occupation', 'fascist', 'Germany', 'very', 'educational', 'explaining', 'why', 'more', 'Americans', 'were', 'probably', 'killed', 'French', 'WWII', 'were', 'saved', 'film', 'what', 'Vichy', 'government', 'was', 'producing', 'way', 'propaganda', 'not', 'what', 'Germans', 'made', 'do', 'Including', 'Northern', 'Africa', 'campaign', 'serious', 'battles', 'where', 'Allied', 'forces', 'were', 'attacked', 'French', 'military', 'loyal', 'Petain', 'Vichy', 'government', 'as', 'well', 'millions', 'Frenchmen', 'who', 'assisted', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'munitions', 'factories', 'question', 'French', 'were', 'more', 'enemy', 'Allies', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'willing', 'admit', 'today', 'anyone', 'who', 'French', 'diplomatic', 'treachery', 'new', 'phenomenon', 'war', 'Islamofascism', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'wonder', 'Chabrol', 'was', 'widely', 'condemned', 'France', 'shining', 'light', 'ugly', 'chapter', 'French', 'history', 'something', 'nation', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'learned', 'nothing', 'ignominy', 'well', 'documented', 'own', 'propagandists', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'fooling', 'world', 'thinking', 'Free', 'French', 'were', 'majority', 'fighting', 'German', 'occupation', 'fact', 'vast', 'majority', 'supported', 'Petain', 'fellow', 'collaborators', 'tide', 'was', 'turning', 'favor', 'Allies', 'what', 'new', 'are', 'interested', 'subject', 'Robert', 'Paxton', 'book', 'Vichy', 'France', 'even', 'more', 'eye', 'opener']",The Eye of Vichy VHS

396705,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,6304028512,Utah Blaine,"[7, 7]","This film is a collection of short clips (taken from newsreels, propaganda films, and mainstream movies) made by/for/about the Vichy government from 1940 until the liberation of Paris in 1944.  This is a modern (1993) attempt to paint a picture of the Vichy government that they may have painted of themselves.  I found this to be a fascinating window into how the Vichy government viewed themselves.  The style of the film is, in many ways, similar to `Triumph of the Will'.  There are fiery speechs about duty, honor, hard work, basic/traditional values, sacrifice, etc.  There is clearly some effort to create a personality cult around Petain as well.  An effort was apparently made to place Petain above petty political machinations of individual parties (i.e. he was above partisan politics and only represents France's interests).  Complex issues of the day are framed very simply, with an `us-versus-them' dogma.  Many of the clips are blatant racist, anti-Semitic propaganda (i.e. during discussion of the `Jewish Question' there is video of rats coming out of a sewer).  There is also a great emphasis on the energy of the youth, how they will be the saviors of the future.  One thing I found particularly interesting about this film was the repeated line of argument taken by Petain and the other Vichy functionnaires that France will suffer less pain by siding with Germany than against, so France should work with them.  Finally, I found it interesting how, as the war progressed, the justifications of the Vichy regime to support Germany became progressively more ridiculous.The place in history for the Vichy regime is still a hotly disputed subject several generations after the war.  This film certainly does not explore many of the moral ambiguities of the Vichy era, it paints the Vichyites simply as Nazis.  I give it four stars simply because it is a propaganda film and there is only so much to be learned from this type of film.  I am not an expert on the Vichy era, but this film left me with more questions than answers (perhaps this was the point of the film?).  The film itself is fast paced and the various clips are seamless woven together.  There is some English commentary, but most of the discussion is French with English subtitles.  Overall, a good inside into Vichy France and highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII or French History in general.  Finally, if you are looking for a good (French) film that actually explores some of the complexities of the occupation check out the film `Uranus'.",4,Vichy France - Nationalist Socialist wanna be,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2538,"['film', 'collection', 'short', 'clips', 'taken', 'newsreels', 'propaganda', 'films', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'made', 'Vichy', 'government', '1940', 'liberation', 'Paris', '1944', 'modern', '1993', 'attempt', 'paint', 'picture', 'Vichy', 'government', 'may', 'have', 'painted', 'found', 'be', 'fascinating', 'window', 'how', 'Vichy', 'government', 'viewed', 'style', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'similar', 'Triumph', 'Will', 'are', 'fiery', 'speechs', 'duty', 'honor', 'hard', 'work', 'basic/traditional', 'values', 'sacrifice', 'etc', 'clearly', 'effort', 'create', 'personality', 'cult', 'around', 'Petain', 'as', 'well', 'effort', 'was', 'apparently', 'made', 'place', 'Petain', 'petty', 'political', 'machinations', 'individual', 'parties', 'i.e', 'was', 'partisan', 'politics', 'only', 'France', 'interests', 'Complex', 'issues', 'day', 'are', 'framed', 'very', 'simply', 'us-versus-them', 'dogma', 'Many', 'clips', 'are', 'blatant', 'racist', 'anti-Semitic', 'propaganda', 'i.e', 'discussion', 'Jewish', 'Question', 'video', 'rats', 'coming', 'sewer', 'also', 'great', 'emphasis', 'energy', 'youth', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'saviors', 'future', 'One', 'thing', 'found', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'repeated', 'line', 'argument', 'taken', 'Petain', 'other', 'Vichy', 'functionnaires', 'France', 'will', 'suffer', 'less', 'pain', 'siding', 'Germany', 'France', 'should', 'work', 'Finally', 'found', 'interesting', 'how', 'war', 'progressed', 'justifications', 'Vichy', 'regime', 'support', 'Germany', 'became', 'progressively', 'more', 'ridiculous.The', 'place', 'history', 'Vichy', 'regime', 'still', 'hotly', 'disputed', 'subject', 'several', 'generations', 'war', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'explore', 'many', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'Vichy', 'era', 'Vichyites', 'simply', 'Nazis', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'simply', 'propaganda', 'film', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'learned', 'type', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'expert', 'Vichy', 'era', 'film', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'perhaps', 'was', 'point', 'film', 'film', 'fast', 'paced', 'various', 'clips', 'are', 'seamless', 'together', 'English', 'commentary', 'most', 'discussion', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Overall', 'good', 'inside', 'Vichy', 'France', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'WWII', 'French', 'History', 'general', 'Finally', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'French', 'film', 'actually', 'complexities', 'occupation', 'check', 'film', 'Uranus']",The Eye of Vichy VHS
