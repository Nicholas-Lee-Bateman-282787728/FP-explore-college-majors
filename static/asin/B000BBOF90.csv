939554,AJQBQV9IIB2OL,B000BBOF90,"C. Wallis Davenport ""joyous2""","[5, 6]","Picked this DVD box set a few months back for my 6 year old daughter for Xmas.  I had always loved Kimba as a child, and was Sure my little girl would, too.  I was right.  Although, there are few reminders of Kimba nowadays (except for Disney's The Lion King rip-off), the stories and Japanese anime last the test of time.Kimba combined both high-spirited adventures, charming stories, and a touch of sadness (in some of the stories).  Episodes often deal with problems larger than a child could really grasp, but not in a heavy-handed manner.  There are some sad story lines, like the first, when Kimba is orphaned, but the sadness is tempered with Kimba learning to be aGreat Leader as his father, Caesar, was.",5,"Kimba, the White Lion, is the One!",1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,712,"['Picked', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'few', 'months', 'back', '6', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Xmas', 'had', 'always', 'loved', 'Kimba', 'child', 'was', 'Sure', 'little', 'girl', 'would', 'too', 'was', 'right', 'are', 'few', 'reminders', 'Kimba', 'nowadays', 'Disney', 'Lion', 'King', 'rip-off', 'stories', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'last', 'test', 'time.Kimba', 'combined', 'high-spirited', 'adventures', 'charming', 'stories', 'touch', 'sadness', 'stories', 'Episodes', 'often', 'problems', 'larger', 'child', 'could', 'really', 'grasp', 'not', 'heavy-handed', 'manner', 'are', 'sad', 'story', 'lines', 'first', 'when', 'Kimba', 'orphaned', 'sadness', 'tempered', 'Kimba', 'learning', 'be', 'aGreat', 'Leader', 'father', 'Caesar', 'was']",Kimba The White Lion - Boxed Set
939555,A3B4ONQ8K44XAT,B000BBOF90,F. Brass,"[2, 2]","This is the box set to get.  All the shows, including the pilot, which launched the show, in a gorgeous box set, with a small footprint, achieved by putting two discs in each super slim dvd box, and cramming five shows into each dvd.My only criticism, and many may not notice, is that the dark black areas look dark grey to me on my Pioneer plasma.  To compensate, I simply turn down the brightness, until those areas turn true black and voila, you can remaster it to match current TV technology.The sound is well balanced, the images clear, aside from a few artifacts, here and there, easily masked by turning down sharpness on your TV.  There's even a bonus DVD featuring interviews with the creator of Kimba and shots of the drawing boards, etc., a must for true anime or Kimba fans.For those unfamiliar with Kimba, this is the original Simba story that we all know as the Lion King.  In this version, his father's fate is not at the hands of an evil uncle, but I will leave it to you to discover the rest, as the story is inspired by, but not a complete copy of this one.As you watch the first episode, and then the rest, you discover and so will your kids, a remarkable show that features great music, great animation (for its time) and multiple layers of meaning.  Each story teaches a lesson, but over all the morality and intelligence behind them all shines through.  Violence should only be used as a last resort, team work wins the day, protect those that are weak from bullies, forgive, be strong, those that we lose are always with us in spirit, size is unimportant, fight for what is right, and courage in the face of fear is the mark of a true hero.  All these universal lessons and more are adeptly taught in the context of all animal kingdom led by one of the cutest white lions you'll ever meet.Enjoy.",5,"Love this as kid, now my kids get to love it, too.",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",2009,1818,"['box', 'set', 'get', 'shows', 'including', 'pilot', 'launched', 'show', 'gorgeous', 'box', 'set', 'small', 'footprint', 'achieved', 'putting', 'two', 'discs', 'super', 'slim', 'dvd', 'box', 'cramming', 'five', 'shows', 'dvd.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'many', 'may', 'not', 'notice', 'dark', 'black', 'areas', 'look', 'dark', 'grey', 'Pioneer', 'plasma', 'compensate', 'simply', 'turn', 'down', 'brightness', 'areas', 'turn', 'true', 'black', 'voila', 'can', 'remaster', 'match', 'current', 'TV', 'technology.The', 'sound', 'well', 'balanced', 'images', 'clear', 'aside', 'few', 'artifacts', 'here', 'there', 'easily', 'masked', 'turning', 'down', 'sharpness', 'TV', 'even', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'creator', 'Kimba', 'shots', 'drawing', 'boards', 'etc.', 'must', 'true', 'anime', 'Kimba', 'fans.For', 'unfamiliar', 'Kimba', 'original', 'Simba', 'story', 'know', 'Lion', 'King', 'version', 'father', 'fate', 'not', 'hands', 'evil', 'uncle', 'will', 'leave', 'discover', 'rest', 'story', 'inspired', 'not', 'complete', 'copy', 'one.As', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'then', 'rest', 'discover', 'so', 'will', 'kids', 'remarkable', 'show', 'great', 'music', 'great', 'animation', 'time', 'multiple', 'layers', 'meaning', 'story', 'lesson', 'morality', 'intelligence', 'shines', 'Violence', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'last', 'resort', 'team', 'work', 'day', 'protect', 'are', 'weak', 'bullies', 'forgive', 'be', 'strong', 'lose', 'are', 'always', 'spirit', 'size', 'unimportant', 'fight', 'what', 'right', 'courage', 'face', 'fear', 'mark', 'true', 'hero', 'universal', 'lessons', 'more', 'are', 'adeptly', 'taught', 'context', 'animal', 'kingdom', 'led', 'one', 'cutest', 'white', 'lions', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'meet.Enjoy']",Kimba The White Lion - Boxed Set

939559,A2MY9VXHZYAHUZ,B000BBOF90,"Kimba W. Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[58, 62]","Kimba The White Lion is one of the greatest animated series of all time. It has been (and is) shown all over the world and is still popular today, 40 years after it was first made. It is accessible to the youngest children, and its themes of love for all life and the need for understanding between humanity and the animal kingdom keep it alive in adults' hearts.Kimba is publicized as the first color anime. You might then think that it is primitive, but the use of color in the show was truly joyous, and the quality of animation is fully the equal of any TV anime today--often superior. The rich, expressive full-orchestral score by Isao Tomita (played by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra) is a major asset, too.For the American dubbed version, experienced radio actors were employed to give voices to the characters. (Billie Lou Watt, the voice of Kimba, had an impressive list of credits reaching up to the recent Courage The Cowardly Dog.) Their superb skill and talent make me wonder what happened to the art of dubbing since then.Kimba the White Lion is a brilliant, fun, and thoughtful show. Everyone to whom I've shown this show, loves it.The shows on this DVD set are the original, 1966 version with Billie Lou Watt as Kimba. I have seen test pressings of these DVDs, and they present Kimba looking better than ever before. You can safely trash any and all Kimba DVDs you might have bought before.

939561,ALEEUYVH3Q5SE,B000BBOF90,Sandor Swartz,"[12, 83]","I am absolutely stunned at the one-sidedness of the reviews here. As of my writing this, all 5 stars except for one 4. Perhaps you fell in love with it as children and further romanticize the memory of it because you haven't seen it since then. Such may be deserved for some things, but least of all this. It's as if you've all been brainwashed. Now it deserves a LITTLE credit considering it came from the era of the 1960s and maybe all the stuff about equality of the animals may have been an allegory for the civil rights movement, but it went beyond absurd. It is more absurd than the most tongue-in-cheek satire the South Park guys have ever been capable of creating, and it doesn't even do it deliberately.First of all, let me get this straight. His father, Caesar, the white lion king, believed so strongly that all animals should be free and live happily that he took livestock from farms. Oh no, he didn't eat them. He FREED them. Yes, you heard me. Awww, doesn't that just warm the cockles of your heart? The image of a LION freeing domesticated livestock so that they can prance around in the jungle, or the Okavango or wherever in Africa it was supposed to be? (they wouldn't survive a week, by the way) It makes me wonder. Just WHAT did he EAT? What exactly did the just and mighty Caesar live off of? Love? It may be possible for their bodies to tolerate soy protein or something - though it has never been done in captivity, and I don't think he had crops growing, but otherwise an adult lion needs to eat 5 or 10 pounds of meat a day on average or he'll wither away and DIE! And there is nothing bad about it. They don't eat meat out of maliciousness or evil, they eat it because they need it. There is no equality of the animals, and it is a lousy allegory to racial issues among humans. That's the mistake Hitler made in his Mein Kampf, equating interracial relations to interspecies relations.Then there's the part where Kimba's teaching the other animals to talk. Now this part was worthy of George Orwell, though again, not deliberately! What with their goal to talk like a human, to WALK like a human. I couldn't help thinking 'four legs baaaaaaaaaaad, two legs gooooooodddddd!'. If Kimba learned to talk that's one thing, that's all fine and dandy. Ok, one lion that has learned to talk. Good for him. Nice for him to know that if he ever needs to he could put on a suit and a tie and maybe make it in the human world, make millions selling his biography maybe. But what came next was just... really, really annoying.And then Kimba is just so tirelessly moralistic it's disgusting. Fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, he repeats. Yeah, animals in the jungle should never HURT each other! That would be WRONG! Those bad old villainous hyenas, 'bullying' that poor deer. They should just go and eat some soybeans or something. Get some fast food. And be nice to each other. Yeah! Oh, and don't worry about where that meat the guy hands you actually came from, but object to the practices that procure it just the same (we actually see Kimba get fed meat by the first 'good' guy in episode 2).Kimba first escaped the boat in episode 1 with the help of the rats who were being oppressed by those 'awful' cats, who were also given cliche sinister attributes. All they were missing were top-hats and handlebar mustaches. Maybe a damsel, a bunch of rope, and a train. It reminded me of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. And then why exactly is it he jumps into the ocean again? Because it's SAFER than being on the boat which is headed for a storm? Yes, kids, remember now! If you're on large ocean-liner and a storm is approaching, you should definitely jump overboard because it is much safer without a boat in the middle of the ocean in a storm than with one, because it just might sink! I think it would be far healthier to imitate Beavis and Butthead, don't you?Of course, in Kimba's deals with humans, I've noticed that all the 'bad' ones are ugly while the 'good' ones are rather dashing. So trite. But of course it doesn't end there. The first bad one isn't just a poacher or something, he's a freaking A-bomb dealer! I mean, come ON! And then the first 'good' one (back to episode 2), who can talk to Kimba (this is before Kimba learns to 'speak' - of course they talk all the time and all non-human species can communicate amongst each other with COMPLETE ease - and we hear English - or Japanese if it was AVAILABLE as an audio track - but like in Garfield we're just supposed to imagine that's what the animal's saying in some sort of animal language that all animals but humans understand) because he's just so close to animals or something, and they escape together and journey across - what was that, the Sahara desert? He has a beautiful death leaving Kimba with the lesson that not all humans are 'bad'. Well, I've got news for you little leo. The good humans' garbage smells just as bad, and their cars' exhaust does too! The 'few bad ones' aren't the human threat you have to worry about. They don't have a monopoly on making your ecosystem vanish. I don't want to wipe out nature, nor am I using traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. body parts from endangered species) but I sit here writing this in my air-conditioned room on a planet with twice as many humans as it had when I was born and still more born-again believers in the manifest destiny thinking it's god's will to have large families, and you can't tell me that we won't wipe 'em out no matter how well-meaning some of us may wish to be.Well, that's enough. In conclusion, I'd have to say, something earns camp status if it's bad enough. But this is just so bad, so NAIVE, I feel it loses it again. It's like Star Trek to the 10th power with its endless shallow morals! And it REALLY deserves an opinion to offset the crazy string of 5-star reviews by its patron brainwashees. I wish I wasn't suckered into trying this sucker out by its unanimous praise. Hopefully I can save a few other saps from the same with this warning. I started watching it thinking Disney was the shameless bad guy for not giving credit where credit was due, but you know what, I think I get them now: referring to this as an influence would be something to be embarrassed about!",1,So bad it doesn't even have camp value,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,6262,"['am', 'absolutely', 'stunned', 'one-sidedness', 'reviews', 'here', 'writing', '5',
