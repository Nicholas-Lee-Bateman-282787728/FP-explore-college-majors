Murdered by a trio of women who were fed up with his male chauvinistic ways.  Too bad for Heaven, too good for Hell he is sent back due to how he treated women, but, the devil (Bruce Payne) thinks it unfair and turns him into a her!  Coupled with the aid of the woman (Jobeth Williams) who murdered him and his best buddy (Jimmy Smits) this Man in a woman's body has to find one woman who likes him.  Barkin really succeeded at playing the role.  LOTS of noted people in it.

Pontacolone ""Nurse/Scholar/Scienti...","[0, 0]","Long before the flurry of slapstick, role-switching movies; daughter-mother, father-son, &#34;Switch&#34; paved the way with a serious look at changes and consequences.  A misogynist womanizing man dies (no spoilers), returns to life as a woman, and has to deal not only with a completely new role for &#34;her&#34;self, but must deal with the disaster (s)He left behind prior to his demise.  Ellen Barkin is perfect in her portrayal of a man in a new skin, and though her performance alone is worth the price of the movie, the story is well done and makes this movie an underrated diamond in a coal bin.
