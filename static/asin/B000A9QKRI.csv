924355,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000A9QKRI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[2, 2]","Hands down I am so impressed with this program.  I hate to come right out and begin by giving praise to a particular series without a proper introduction, but with Arrested Development the excitement just bubbles over the top.  To begin, the first season was above the word phenomenal.  There was something unique, original, and compellingly humorous about the cast, the concept, and every small detail surrounding the show.  Now, with the second season behind me, there is nothing more to say than simply, ""Bravo"".  With any second season you have your worries, will the studio give more money ... will those characters we love return again ... or will the humor falter for a more visually stimulating program?  As any repeat viewer sits down for the second season, these compelling thoughts will race through your mind, but I am here to assure you, Arrested Development, remains (even today - well after it has been released from FOX) the best situational comedy this decade.  I would even have the gumption to say that it rivals that of Seinfeld with its bold, dark humor and strangely compelling cast.  The envelope was pushed hard with the second season, and I must admit that I am excited to go back and revisit it anytime.  Sure, I know what will happen in each episode and the eventual outcome of our cast, but their emotion, their realism, their (dare to be repetitive) comic timing was AMAZING.  Every single aspect of this program, from first season to this season was nothing short of perfection.  I have never seen a program work this well on so many different levels.This review will sound a bit like my original review for the first season, but it is only because I cannot stop myself from praising the little feet this show walked on.  As always, it was dropped well before its time, but thankfully we had the opportunity to see developing characters like Tobias and Lindsay work together their marriage, Gob work through his ""unsealed"" marriage, Michael try to continue to save the company and his family, and Buster deal with going into Army and his loss of powerful appendage.  These few key phrases only begin to scratch the surface of this show, surprisingly the producers went deeper and created a larger Arrested Development universe that did not fail or rock the foundation of that model home.  Gob's marriage situation was hysterical because it actually dealt with his real-life wife Amy Poehler, while Buster kept me in stitches trying to overcome his obsessive mother.  At first I was hesitant with Michael's relationship with Julia-Louis Dryfuss, but by the end, it worked for me.  She was a perfect counterpart to the lifestyle that Michael boasts.  Tobias' use of language in this series demonstrated the sheer brilliance of this show, and everyone else just fell into place.  Kinda like kissing cousins ... right?  I know I am failing miserably at really gauging the power of this show, but one could talk for hours about the genuine crispness of this program and again, never quite scratch the surface.  All one needs to know when reading this review is that this is what perfection feels like.  This is what happens when you combine clich&eacute; characters, in over-the-top situations, with a strong cast, and phenomenal writing.  For those of us watching this on FOX, we knew we were witnessing a cult classic in the making.Overall, I cannot speak more highly of this show.  I give this series out to friends and family as random gifts, I speak about this show anywhere I go (even if the conversation isn't headed in that direction), and I would happily sign my name on any sheet asking for a revival.  FOX, again, dropped the ball on what could have been a hysterical series that lasted for a very long time.  Could another station pick this up, sure, it would continue to bring in ratings and reach even more fans.  I could wake up in the morning listening to Gob's magic (or is it illusion?) music as he continues to inspire me to work harder every day (it actually more enjoyable to do things without getting punched in the gut).  I would love to walk next to Tobias every day with his eagerness to please his family and wife, while enjoying daily breakfast made by Mrs. Featherbottom.  I would be friends with George Michael, listening to his stories about Maeby and his girlfriend ... what is her name ... strange ... I can't seem to remember and I have seen this series four times?  Odd.  I would love to live in the Bluth condo, hang out with Buster's brother Anyan, and question the relationship between Buster and Uncle Oscar.  There were just so many memorable moments in this series that I could go on like this forever.  There are lines that I still quote from this series around friends and myself whenever I need a laugh.  I was continually impressed with the pop culture references (who didn't like the Peanuts, head down with piano music, moments) as well as current events.  George Sr's Iraq connection ...I cannot, and now will not, speak any further of this show on this review.  I believe you know my stance on this program and that no matter what anyone would say I will stand by it.  It is the BEST (next to Firefly) that I have ever seen on television and will continue to curse those on FOX who dropped it.  I will suggest to everyone reading this to go and buy this IMMEDIATELY because no matter the price, you will enjoy every last drop of it.  Go now friends, you have Arrested Development or Girls with Low Self-Esteem to watch. (either one will be worth a great laugh!)Grade: ********** out of *****",5,"Oh Tobias, you old blowhard!",1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,5564,"['down', 'am', 'so', 'impressed', 'program', 'hate',

The Bluth family, which is the subject of this series, is at the same time the funniest and most dysfunctional family ever grace the airwaves. The show lampoons a lot of different things, the humor is sometimes silly and broad, other times so intelligent you almost miss it (and that's sometimes the funniest of all)Although you could start anywhere in the series, I would urge you to start with  Season 1, Episode 1, and work your way through.  My daughter and I started with Episode 1 at the start of her summer break (she's in college).  We watch it sporadically,, as we're both pretty busy. But, when we do sit down to watch it, we watch about 3 episodes at a time...and that seems about right.  I can only take so much funny at a time!  Sadly, we're already 1/2 way through the 3rd season...which will be all we can watch, unless we spring for a subscription to a competing service that sponsored a 4th &#34;revival&#34; season just recently.

924362,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000A9QKRI,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[23, 26]","In the second season of the critically acclaimed Arrested Development, the show continues to display the clever wit, stellar acting, and overall insanity that won multiple Emmys, including the award for Outstanding Comedy Series, in the first season. The show is set in Orange County, California, and follows the exploits of the Bluth family. While they were once one of the richest families in the country, they lost nearly everything when George Bluth, Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) was arrested for white collar crime. However, at the end of last year, it was revealed that he had also committed ""light treason"" by building houses in Iraq for Saddam Hussein. George's son Michael (Jason Bateman), who is basically the only sane member of the Bluth family, was forced to take over, while the rest of his clueless family continued buying, mooching, and acting as if nothing had happened.The year starts off as Michael and his son George Michael (Michael Cera) are driving to Arizona in order to once and for all escape the greed and corruption of their family life. However, Michael soon learns that, since his father had escaped after faking a heart attack, he is next in line to be prosecuted. His family posts bail, so while Michael is allowed to go to work, live at home, and for the most part live his life, he is banned from leaving the state, forcing him to once again help out his family. With Michael under investigation, his older brother GOB (Will Arnett), short for George Oscar Bluth, Jr., becomes the new president of the Bluth corporation, while Michael secretly pulls the strings. This of course leads to many catastrophes due to GOB's greed, arrogance, and overall incompetance (remember, GOB is one of the world's worst magicians, yet he believes himself to be the next Copperfield).Meanwhile at home, Michael's mother Lucille (Jessica Walter) restarts an old affair with George's twin brother Oscar Bluth (also played by Tambor), and she sends poor Annyong (Justin Lee), her adopted Korean son, away to the Milford Boarding School. Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) decide to try an open marriage in an attempt to save their marriage. At the same time, Tobias decides to try out for the Blue Man Group (the stage show, not the depression focus group). And Maeby (Alia Shawkat) becomes jealous that George Michael is spending most of his time with his new (and very religious) girlfriend, Ann Veal (now played by Mae Whitman). Lucille is confronted by a Michael Moore lookalike, she enlists Buster (Tony Hale) in the army, unaware that there is a war going on in the Middle East.  Finally, Ron Howard is absolutely brilliant as the show's narrator. He often fills us in on references made by the family members, and he even picks on a few characters.Early on, George, Sr. returns home, and spends most of the season hiding out in the attic of the model home, with Michael as his confidante. He observes many of the going-ons around the house, many of which go way beyond bizarre. The stories this year involve Buster going AWOL from the army in order to play the crane game at a small carnival, GOB playing AGAINST the Bluth company in a corporate softball game against a rival developping company, Ann getting left in Mexico by Michael, and a dishonest campaign to try to get George Michael elected to Student Body President.The single-episode stories are all hilarious (I can't think of a single bad episode), but it's the multi-episode story arcs that make me laugh the hardest. Buster's army training is hilarious to watch, seeing as how he is a mama's boy who is prone to panic attacks, and it gets even better when he tries to put his training to use. GOB's puppet Franklin is utilized incredibly well, especially when he tries to make a CD of his act called ""Franklin Comes Alive"". When Maeby conned her way into an executive position at a movie studio, the results were all hilarious, and Michael's undying dislike of Ann, as well as his inability to remember her name or what she looks like were great. Unlike most comedy shows, Arrested Development is fairly serialized, and it foreshadows many of its plots and jokes (pay extra attention when, in an early episode, Buster says, ""I never thought that I'd miss a hand so much,"" when he refers to an old hand-shaped chair).The season is consistently funny; I can't remember a single dull episode. In fact, the quality of the jokes increase as the season goes on, leading to the season finale, which actually had me falling out of my seat, because I was laughing so hard. Make no mistake, the early episodes are great and will make you laugh out loud (the second one features what I believe to be the greatest game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in history), but as the story develops, and there are more and more things to reference and build upon, things just explode at the end.While the main cast are all hilarious and extremely talented, the weekly guest stars should not be overlooked. The family attorney, Barry Zuckercorn (Henry Winkler), returns and is more incompetant than ever. George, Sr's old secretary Kitty Sanchez (Judy Greer) makes a welcome return and is involved in a few very unexpected plot twists. Also, a few other great side characters return from Season 1, including Liza Minelli as Lucille 2 and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the dishonest attorney Maggie Lizer. But this year, we are introduced to a bunch of new and very hilarious characters. Gene Parmesan (Martin Mull) is a private investigator who is terrible with disguises, but he is always able to fool Lucille. Tony Wonder (Ben Stiller) plays one of GOB's rival magicians, while Stiller's wife Christine Taylor plays Sally Sitwell, one of Michael's old flames. We are also treated to Zach Braff, Alan Tudyk, Iona Skye, Dave Attel, Tom Jane, and Martin Short.Sadly for the show, the ratings are not very high. Despite a rabid fanbase and nearly unaminous critical acclaim, Arrested Development is struggling (the fact that it is extremely self-referential may be a factor, and I advise everyone to see Season 1 before this, or at least a quarter of the jokes will go over your head). In fact, there are only 18 episodes this year because the network wasn't sure if it was worth keeping this show on. However, even in the face of adversity, the show was still able to joke about its predicament. At one point, Michael is shocked to learn that a customer had reduced his order from 22 to 18 houses, and in real life, FOX cut the episode order from 22 to 18. Also, a popular website was plauged by Family Guy pop-up ads (another reason the show was cut short was to get Family Guy and American Dad on quicker). Also, the show gets in a great jab at its more popular competitor Desperate Housewives.I guess the one gripe that I have with this set is the fact that the episodes are in broadcast order as opposed to production order.  Seeing as how the show is very serialized for a comedy, episode order matters more than it would on a show like The Simpsons.  The good thing is that only one episode was aired out of order, and that is The Sword of Destiny.  It is supposed to be the second to last episode (right before Righteous Brothers), but instead, it comes a few episodes early.  While continuity isn't messed up too terribly, there are a few things that someone wouldn't understand if they didn't know about the order problem.  For example, something that happens at the very end of SoD (in the ""On the Next Arrested Development"" segment) isn't ""fixed"" until Righteous Brothers, which makes sense since RB should have been the next episode (hint: look for the band-aids on GOB's fingers).  But, if that is the worst problem, then things aren't so bad.Fortunately, the FOX executives are smart enough to realize that this is an amazing show that will win them plenty of awards, and they decided to give it a third season even though its numbers continued to be poor throughout two seasons (the fact that Arrested Development won USA Today's Save Our Show poll and came in second in the E! poll probably helped a lot).This is a collection that no Arrested Development fan should be without. And if you're not a fan, definitely start watching. No other show on television is this funny, clever, or just plain fun.

924367,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000A9QKRI,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.I can't blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.As it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do.Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I'm bored just thinking about it.  We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television.  That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it.  Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about.",5,arrested development is back for more,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,2499,"['One', 'thing', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'forgot', 'mention', 'previous', 'review', 'how', 'humor', 'up', 'nicely', 'years', 'What', 'found', 'funny', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'show', 'JUST', 'consistently', 'funny', 'now', 'fact', 'now', 'understand', 'style', 'humor', 'better', 'think', 'show', 'even', 'funnier', 'now.Fox', 'had', 'something', 'good', 'cooking', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'whenever', 'show', ""n't"", 'get', 'ratings', 'network', 'network', 'will', 'move', 'show', 'night', 'timeslot', 'hope', 'achieving', 'better', 'ratings', 'VERY', 'rarely', 'sadly', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'example', 'this.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Fox', 'pulling', 'plug', 'tried', 'hardest', 'promote', 'show', 'remember', 'Sunday', 'nights', 'watching', 'Simpsons', 'commercials', 'people', 'Fox', 'REALLY', 'wanted', 'viewers', 'tune', 'writers', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'proud', 'Fox', 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'keep', 'air', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'still', 'believe', 'more', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'pay', 'attention', 'characters', 'show', 'made', 'solid', 'effort', 'get', 'involved', 'twisted', 'storylines', 'instead', 'assuming', 'show', 'should', 'be', 'regular', 'laugh', 'track', 'comedy', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'would', 'be', 'today.As', '53', 'episodes', 'are', 'have', 'great', 'show', 'Honestly', 'not', 'enough', 'will', 'have', 'do.Do', 'really', 'NEED', 'anymore', 'laugh', 'track', 'comedies', 'Are', ""n't"", 'there', 'more', 'enough', 'air', 'now', 'Most', 'shows', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'when', 'hear', 'name', 'so', 'many', 'Most', 'comedies', 'feature', 'laughing', 'audience', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'blend', 'together', 'One', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'joke', ""'m"", 'bored', 'just', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'reached', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'changed', 'sorts', 'reality', 'shows', 'whatnot', 'changing', 'format', 'comedy', 'genre', 'direction', 'similar', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'right', 'move', 'opinion', 'times', 'need', 'change.People', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'really', 'NOTHING', 'else', 'television', 'why', 'show', '5-star', 'ratings', 'received', 'here', 'amazon', 'People', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'praising', 'show', 'so', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'reason', 'Trust', 'reason', 'positive', 'reviews', 'Buy', 'one', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'pop', 'bag', 'popcorn', 'microwave', 'watch', 'show', '*carefully*', 'experience', 'joy', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'raving']",Arrested Development: Season 2

I do not know if it is your lack of desire, or a fundamental inability to promote worthwhile television, but your decision to cancel Arrested Development is thoughtless, ignorant, and downright irresponsible.It is extremely shortsighted for you to blame the show itself for its failure - everyone I know who can find the show on your constantly in-flux schedule watches it religiously. It is your job to inform the audience of show, let alone promote it properly, and give it a permanent time-slot so that it is accessible.Arrested Development was my last bastion of thoughtful, intelligent, and clever programming on network television - if you cancel it, I am done with Fox, as with the rest of the networks. Further, I will boycott your sponsors just on principal. I will take my viewership and consumer spending to Amazon.com to purchase the television shows you cancel, and the Comedy Channel and premium cable and their sponsors, who give their audience credit for being able to digest more than just reality TV garbage, recycled sitcom insult-a-thons, and videos of when things attack.I hope you take this letter into account when making future programming decisions",5,Dear Fox:,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1412,"['First', 'Futurama', 'then', 'Family', 'Guy', 'now', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'begin', 'express', 'extreme', 'disappointment', 'thoughtless', 'programming', 'decisions.Arrested', 'Development', 'far', 'funniest', 'smartest', 'show', 'television', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'lack', 'desire', 'fundamental', 'inability', 'promote', 'worthwhile', 'television', 'decision', 'cancel', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'thoughtless', 'ignorant', 'downright', 'irresponsible.It', 'extremely', 'shortsighted', 'blame', 'show', 'failure', 'everyone', 'know', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'show', 'constantly', 'in-flux', 'schedule', 'watches', 'religiously', 'job', 'inform', 'audience', 'show', 'let', 'alone', 'promote', 'properly', 'give', 'permanent', 'time-slot', 'accessible.Arrested', 'Development', 'was', 'last', 'bastion', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'clever', 'programming', 'network', 'television', 'cancel', 'am', 'done', 'Fox', 'rest', 'networks', 'Further', 'will', 'boycott', 'sponsors', 'just', 'principal', 'will', 'take', 'viewership', 'consumer', 'spending', 'Amazon.com', 'purchase', 'television', 'cancel', 'Comedy', 'Channel', 'premium', 'cable', 'sponsors', 'who', 'give', 'audience', 'credit', 'being', 'able', 'digest', 'more', 'just', 'reality', 'TV', 'garbage', 'recycled', 'sitcom', 'insult-a-thons', 'videos', 'when', 'things', 'attack.I', 'hope', 'take', 'letter', 'account', 'when', 'making', 'future', 'programming', 'decisions']",Arrested Development: Season 2

It appeared out of the fog of failed and dying sitcoms and lasted a full and funny 22 episodes. At the end of that season many fans and critics assumed that the low rated show was doomed to fade back into the mist, but a second and eventually third season would be had.The following two seasons however would be reduced to 18 and 11 episodes respectively. The second season specifically is a little weaker and uneven. The comedy also tends to be broader, and sillier. Despite this, the show still shines as the best comedy on television.In season two the Bluth family is recovering from the lost of their father, George Bluth Senior. A lost that took Bluth all the way to Mexico as he fled from federal custody for a number of white collar crimes he was accused of in the first season. Michael Bluth, the middle son, tries desperately to keep his father's company afloat despite the petty selfish medalling from the rest of his family.While George Sr. is on the run, brother in law Tobias Funke becomes obsessed with The Blue Man Group, 16 year old Maybe Funke cons her way into a job at a Hollywood production company, George Micheal (Michael Bluth's son) falls hard for fundamentalist Christian, and Buster Bluth, the youngest and most sheltered of George Sr.'s sons joins the Army. The whole show plays out like a twisted comedic version of Dynasty.We are also introduced to,  Girls with Low Self Esteem producer  Phillip Lit (played by Zach Braff)... funny, rich but not related by blood Uncle Jack (played by Martin Short)...not that funny, and Stan Sitwell (played be Ed Begley Jr.) a competitor of the Bluth company..weird but really funny. Plus many recurring characters from the first season are back to confront and confound the Bluth's.Currently the show looks like it will now fall back into the fog. The latest word from FOX is that ""Arrested Development""  will be canceled.

924379,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000A9QKRI,Clare Quilty,"[4, 4]","I was listening to a radio interview with the creator of this brilliant, critically-praised, ratings-challenged show, and the subject of his Emmy acceptance speech came up.  When ""Arrested Development"" won, he said something like, ""The Academy says it's great, so why isn't anybody watching it?""  During the interview, he also mentioned that while the ratings are poor, the DVDs sell well.I was thinking, ""Here's another great show, like 'freaks & geeks,' that's just going to go down the tubes.""  But then it occurred to me, *I* don't watch the show.  At least not when it's broadcast.  Between time-slot shifts and baseball delays, I'm not even sure I know what night it comes on anymore.  During the first two seasons, I kept missing it until finally I just wound up catching them all when they hit disk.That got me thinking that ""Arrested Development"" really benefits from the DVD format.  Stripped of commercials, each episode is really just under 20 minutes.  And with such detail-heavy, in-joke-oriented plots and characters, this is a show that improves when you can sit down and watch three episodes in an hour, rather than watch it week-by-week, shot through with ads and Fox pop-up promotions.Given the popularity of TiVo and DVR's, and the continued endurance of VHS (as I can't afford most modern technology, I actually don't watch any shows as they're broadcast, but tape them and watch them afterward, so I can pause, skip commercials and rewind stuff I might watch to scrutinize), we may one day see the advent of shows that are produced to go straight to DVD, if they can figure out how to siphon profits from sources other than advertisements (though considering the staggering profits made from, say, ""Chapelle Show Season 2"" dvd's, they may not need other sources).If we do see such programming, I hope it's as smart and funny as ""Arrested Development"" which, in its second season, has only grown more complex and brilliant.",5,"""AD"" on DVD -- One more sign of a new stage in the evolution of television and its audience (pretentious title I know, but true)",1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,1944,"['was', 'listening', 'radio', 'interview', 'creator', 'brilliant', 'critically-praised', 'ratings-challenged', 'show', 'subject', 'Emmy', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'came', 'up', 'When', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'won', 'said', 'something', 'Academy', 'great', 'so', 'why', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'watching', 'interview', 'also', 'mentioned', 'ratings', 'are', 'poor', 'DVDs', 'sell', 'well.I', 'was', 'thinking', 'Here', 'great', 'show', ""'freaks"", 'geeks', 'just', 'going', 'go', 'down', 'tubes', 'then', 'occurred', '*I*', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'least', 'not', 'when', 'broadcast', 'Between', 'time-slot', 'shifts', 'baseball', 'delays', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'night', 'anymore', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'kept', 'missing', 'finally', 'just', 'wound', 'up', 'catching', 'when', 'hit', 'disk.That', 'got', 'thinking', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'really', 'benefits', 'DVD', 'format', 'Stripped', 'commercials', 'episode', 'really', 'just', '20', 'minutes', 'such', 'detail-heavy', 'in-joke-oriented', 'plots', 'characters', 'show', 'when', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'three', 'episodes', 'hour', 'rather', 'watch', 'week-by-week', 'shot', 'ads', 'Fox', 'pop-up', 'promotions.Given', 'popularity', 'TiVo', 'DVR', 'continued', 'endurance', 'VHS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'most', 'modern', 'technology', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'shows', ""'re"", 'broadcast', 'tape', 'watch', 'afterward', 'can', 'pause', 'skip', 'commercials', 'rewind', 'stuff', 'might', 'watch', 'scrutinize', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'see', 'advent', 'shows', 'are', 'produced', 'go', 'straight', 'DVD', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'siphon', 'profits', 'sources', 'other', 'advertisements', 'considering', 'staggering', 'profits', 'made', 'say', 'Chapelle', 'Show', 'Season', '2', 'dvd', 'may', 'not', 'need', 'other', 'sources', '.If', 'do', 'see', 'such', 'programming', 'hope', 'smart', 'funny', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'second', 'season', 'only', 'grown', 'more', 'complex', 'brilliant']",Arrested Development: Season 2

Mutillation allusions continue throughout the show as its own completeness is jeopardized by FOX, George Michael ends up kissing his maybe cousin Maebe, Tobias continues to blue himself as he juggles joining The Blue Man Group with saving his marriage, we get two more chicken impersonations from Lucille and Lindsay as well as a generous helping of Hollywood stars (the best of which is Ben Stiller's turn as a magician yang to GOB's ying) and a fantastic double performance by Jeffrey Tambor as George Bluth and his hippie brother (and presumably Buster's real dad).The show often pokes fun at itself, the Fox network and it's own cancellation (at one point Michael complains about a housing development being cut down from 22 units to 18) and continues to employ a frenzied editing technique that has no parallel on network TV (I can't remember if I've ever seen a half hour show using so many different scenes in such a short amount of time). Pop references abound, nowhere as often as the ""Good Grief"" episode that features tons of Charlie Brown references, and symbolic meaning is employed liberally.Sadly, the combination of symbolism, off kilter humor and innovative story telling means the show is not easy on its viewers.  To get the full effect you actually have to pay attention and watch it repeatedly.

I highly recommend watching season 1 before this, as many of the jokes carry over to this season (one of the many reasons I love this show).As I said you should watch season 1 before this, so I'm not gonna go into explanation about the shows storyline, instead outline some of the incredibly funny moments. There was an awful lot to choose from, but the funniest for me was Buster using Gob's puppet exclaiming to his mother ""I don't want to go to no country club you freak BITCH!"", or Maebe's job and catchphrase ""Marry me"" and then switching it up in a priceless moment ""BABYSIT ME!"". The season long gag of nobody remembering Ann, George Michaels girlfriend, was great as well.The cast is wonderful. Each character has so much depth its amazing. The show as a whole is near perfect because of everyone. I think if one was missing the show would lose impact because all the jokes bounce off of each character. I found myself loving Maebe's storyline, as well as her as an actor. Incredibly funny along with George Michael. Buster is my favorite though. He plays a potentially annoying character very well and hilariously.I cant give this as high a rating as season 1, because I felt that was better, but this one is no disappointment. The only critique I have is some storylines seemed to not wrap up. That may be due to the season being cut down a few episodes.

The character is Buster (Tony Hale), who gets out of going in the Army because of the seal attack. Oh yeah, and the addition of a hook and the catchphrase 'I'M A MONSTER!' make it work even more.So why isn't anyone watching the show? (If you're a loyal fan and reading this, skip this paragraph) Why is Stacked getting more viewers, and the O.C.? And Desperate Housewives, people? Maybe these shows (except Stacked) are a guilty pleasure, but they're not in any way, shape, or form as original and funny as Arrested Development. Where are the O.C.'s Emmys? Who got the writing awards for comedy? Who has an executive producer and narrator named Ron Howard, who's made Oscar-winning movies? DAMN YOU!Okay, that's done, now the good part. The second season somehow tops the first, with plotlines like a 90-year-old family friend, paralyzed from the waist down, visiting the Bluths with his manservant Dragon, a slightly deaf & mute muscle man. Oh, did I mention Martin Short plays him? Oh, and cameos by Ben Stiller as a magician named Tony Wonder, who appears suddenly at the mention of wonder; Christine Taylor as a woman Michael (Jason Bateman) has liked since childhood but loses because her father, a hairless man named Stan Sitwell (Ed Begley Jr.) APPROVES of them dating; Martin Mull as a private detective named Gene Parmesan, hired to track George Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) in Mexico; Julia Louis-Dreyfus (also in the 1st season) as the pretending-to-be-blind lawyer Maggie Lizer (as in 'lies her ass off'), who appears with a child that might be Michael's, but it can't be as simple as that in this show, and it sure aint; and Charlize Theron as a British knockout with more than a few secrets? (Okay, Charlize Theron's 3rd season, but that got your attention, huh?)

924413,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,B000A9QKRI,kaduzy,"[4, 17]","I thought Season 1 of this show was the most hilarious thing I'd ever seen on TV.  Never had I sat on my couch and actually laughed out loud at a TV show.  Unfortunately, Season 2 is not QUITE that funny.  The jokes seem a little more crude and something just falls short.  It's still a lot funnier than a lot of what I've seen on TV and several cuts (or seal-bites perhaps) above other shows but it simply doesn't live up to the first season, which is one of the reasons I have to regretfully remove one star.Another reason is because not all of the promised extras are actually included.  The packaging promises ""Campaign videos from the 'Immaculate Election' episode"" but after looking in the Special Features section of all three discs, I didn't find them.  Maybe they're an easter egg?  I was extremely disappointed by not finding them, because I think that's one of the funniest episodes in the season and would have liked to see those videos.  (A third reason, albeit a minor one, is the packaging itself -- having to remove the entire boxed set from a slipcover before getting to the individual discs is pretty annoying.)And my final reason is that a lot of things are dropped with no explanation or warning.  What ever happened to Anyung?  He just disappeared and none of the characters ever mention him anymore.  What the heck is THAT about?  It's even more baffling than when they abruptly replaced Marta last season with another (far less attractive) actress.  Things like that happen a few times (I don't want to give too much away but you'll see if you watch.) and they also introduce major things with no real explanation.  Gob is Steve Holt's father???  Hello, when are we going to hear more about THAT?In spite of the problems, several episodes stand out and still made me laugh out loud, including ""Immaculate Election"", ""Good Grief"", ""Sword of Destiny"" and ""Meet the Veals"".  There's a lot to love about this season -- Tobias' stint in the Blue Man Group (and the streaks he leaves around the model home for episodes afterward), all the clues leading up to Buster's accident, Ben Stiller's cameo appearance as Tony Wonder, Franklin the puppet and all the Liza Minelli scenes, just to name a few.  Zach Braff and Christine Taylor also make appearances, and Carl Weathers pops up as well.

But I'm so excited for the 2nd season of Arrested Development to come out on DVD that I'm going to write one anyway! (Don't worry, I'll come back and update the review once I actually get the DVD.)This is, in my opinion, the funniest show on television. My favorite thing about this show is how it is a ""comedy for smart people."" If you like dumb and ""easy"" humor, then there is probably still some stuff in here that you'll enjoy... BUT if you like clever/witty humor, you'll LOVE this show. The more you watch it, the more jokes you'll understand and the more funny the jokes will be. There are even jokes foreshadowing other jokes several episodes down the road (e.g. Buster's ""I never thought I'd miss a hand so much"" when looking at his old hand chair in ""Amigos""). There's no way you could ever catch everything on your first viewing, and that's why the DVDs are so great.While the 1st season is incredible, I'd have to say that the 2nd season might be even better. The jokes just keep building (so it's even funnier if you've seen the 1st season). The running storyline of Tobias as an ""on call"" understudy of the blue man group is great... even at the end of the season (well after that story has ended) you can still see blue smudges on everything in the house. The whole thing about Buster losing his hand is hilarious and contributes greatly to my favorite episode of the season, ""Motherboy XXX"" (which has one of the funniest endings I've ever seen). I could go on and on: the Veals, Gene Parmesan, Mrs. Featherbottom, GOB's wife, Maeby's job, ""Scandalmakers""... it just never stops!FOX cut back this season's original order of 22 episodes to only 18 (allegedly so they could introduce ""American Dad""...  but there are even jokes about the cut, like when the Bluth Company's order for homes is cut from 22 to 18). While it's disappointing to think we could have had four more episodes, I'm more than willing to trade those four episodes for a whole 3rd season.

As the second season of the critically acclaimed but low rated show picks up, Michael (Jason Bateman) learns his father George (Jeffrey Tambor) has broken out of prison, and is soon forced to rejoin his dysfunctional family.  After that, there's loads of insane and hilarious moments peppered throughout this season, as Gob (Will Arnett) tries to get his magic show off the ground again, by any means necessary, and learns he has a long lost son, Buster (Tony Hale), in an act of defiance towards his mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), joins the army and eventually gets his hand bitten off by a seal (yes, you read that right), Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) and Tobias (David Cross) get seperated as Tobias auditions for the Blue Man Group, Lucille gets involved with George's twin brother Oscar (Tambor), George Michael (Michael Cera) tries to move on from his crush on his cousin Maeby (Alia Shawkat) by getting a pious girlfriend, which leads to even more hilarity (gee, imagine that).  There's a horde of guest stars this season too, including Julia Louis-Dreyfuss returning as a fakely blind lawyer who Michael had a one night stand with, that leads to something more unexpected, Henry Winkler as the family's dirty lawyer, Zach Braff, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, Alan Tudyk, and must see performances from Martin Short as an aging fitness guru, and the return of Liza Minelli as Lucille 2.

However, Season 2 of Arrested Development (A.D.) may be consistently better comedy than any one season on those other shows.  Every episode presents solidly strong comedic writing, acting, and production.  So, join the cult and buy Season 2 of A.D.  You won't be disappointed.I can understand to an extent why A.D. struggles on TV.  The jokes in the episodes assume that you watched previous episodes.  One has to understand the traits of each character.  The plots build on each other.  So, that's why A.D. works so well as a DVD.  A.D. is a show where the episodes flow well together, and with the DVD one can follow the Bluth family adventures one at a time, or watch  numerous episodes together.The extras on the DVD are limited and not impressive.  The commentaries are uninteresting (too many cast members with nothing special to say) and the other extras do not add much to the DVD.  However, the episodes are so strong that the DVD is simply a must-get.

And if those preparing to mourn the genre consider Friends or its ilk to be the standard-bearer, than perhaps they are right.But maybe, just maybe, with Arrested Development we are seeing the future of the situation comedy... and if that's the case, things are looking up!Arrested Development isn't your standard ""set up a punch line, deliver punch-line, listen to the studio audience roar"" show. In fact, rarely is there a set up or punchline, but rather keenly written and expertly delivered dialogue. And rather than the standard ""Joey and Phoebe get stuck in an elevator while Rachel and Monica plan Thanksgiving dinner"" storylines, Arrested lets each episode unfold in an intricate and intriguing manner with humor that ranges from subtle to sublime.The basic premise? We're spending time with the Bluth family, who, to borrow a phrase, put the ""fun"" in dysfunctional. The characters range from maniacal (especially the Emmy-worthy turn by Jessica Walter as matriarch Lucille Bluth) to misguided (perhaps best exemplified by Will Arnett's desperate-for-attention-at-any-cost Gob). These aren't cookie-cutter cardboard characters as you'll find on other comedies. Each is a fascinating character study, with flaws and faults and quirks unlike those seen in other television households.Best of all - and perhaps the main reason to purchase the DVD - the show is (gasp) laugh-out-loud funny and will be whether this is the first or one-hundred-and-first time you view the episodes.Comedy, dead?

924441,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000A9QKRI,RMurray847,"[10, 10]","When this show first aired a couple of years ago, I enjoyed it more than any new TV show in YEARS.  I would say there was a good, solid laugh every 30 seconds or so.  When Season Two started (and thank good ness it did...I'm amazed Fox actually keeps renewing this low-rated masterpiece), I hoped it would live up to same standards.  I was concerned that the creators may have poured all their best ideas into the first frantic year.Well, my fears were quickly set-aside.  I would say that now the laughs come every 20 seconds.  And again, the availability of this show on DVD is almost essential for the fan of AD.  You can finally get every joke.  So often, the best lines are practically mumbled by the actors...they seem to be toss-offs, but in fact they are rich in comedic meaning.One great thing about the show is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favorite character.  For awhile, I thought it might be Tobias Funke, because the stuff when he tries to join Blue Man Group is priceless.  Some of the jokes around this subplot will stick with me for life.  But then we get to see Buster joining the army and all the ridiculous shenanigans involved with that.  Then there's George Michael (can I just say that the young man who plays this nervous teen is absolutely brilliant...he has found the comedic and emotional heart of his character with the lazar beam perfection of a seasoned pro), who's clueless relationship with his new girlfriend Anne is absolutely hysterical.  And we can always rely on Gob to mess up anything he touches.  I just can't decide who makes me laugh the most...which is great...there's never a moment when you say to yourself, ""oh, this guy, well hopefully this scene will be done soon so we can move on with the laughs.""  It's all good.There are many terrific guest appearances, including Martin Mull as a private detective, Henry Winkler as the family attorney, a hysterical Ed Begley Jr. as a business rival (and an alopecia sufferer...no hair anywhere on his body!), Christine Taylor as a love interest for Michael, and of course, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as a blind (!?!), pregnant (?!!!?!!) attorney.  Also, Martin Short turns up for one episode playing what some call the funniest and others the creepiest character of the season.  They're both right...it's an amazingly zany performance.And the anchor holding it all together is Jason Bateman, who has the part of ""straight-man,"" yet has the best comedic timing and some of the funniest lines in the cast.The show is simply a brilliant achievement in TV comedy, and the DVD is a must-own...believe me, these shows hold up to repeated viewings.  I still laugh out loud the third time through! (The moment when a banana-suit clad Gob is lifted in the air by a crane operated by Buster never ceases to amaze!)The DVD set is attractive.  The extras are relatively few (some deleted scenes and bloopers...nothing unforgettable or indispensable).  I haven't listened to the commentaries yet, so can't really offer an opinion there.  I was sorry to discover that season 1 had 22 episodes and season 2 only 18.  I hope the current Season 3 doesn't drop to 14 or something!!  BUY THESE DVDs!!!!  TELL A FRIEND!!

924443,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000A9QKRI,Robert I. Hedges,"[0, 0]","""Arrested Development"" is one of the funniest and most inventive shows in history. While I adore everything about season one, season two had a couple of flat moments among the genius. I was particularly amused with the concept of Tobias joining Blue Man Group, and found the reappearance of George Senior and Kitty, and the appearance of Oscar (George Senior's brain-fried hippie brother) likewise hilarious. I also thought the treason angle with Saddam Hussein was cleverly handled, but I found the characterization of Christianity to be unnecessary and inaccurate, even for a satire. Likewise, I found the characterization of the military to be less than comedic gold, although I do think the undercurrent of wealthy American's sense of entitlement and condescension to the military to be generally accurate.The acting is, once again, brilliant, and the scripts consistently deliver unpredictable and hilarious plot twists. I was extremely amused by the interactions of Gob (Will Arnett); and Buster (Tony Hale) which led to Buster's hand being bitten off by a seal, and the interactions between Lucille and Lucille Two to be wonderful. The presence of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Maggie was also a strong point, as was the cameo by Dick Van Patten. By far the best of the guest appearances was by Ed Begley, Jr., who, thanks to alopecia gets to wear a hilarious assortment of wigs and fake eyebrows which detach at the most unseemly of times.The DVD set has a variety of extras including deleted scenes, a blooper reel and several commentaries, which are, in some places, overtly hostile and condescending to conservatives (the ""Red State"" discussion is particularly revealing of the views of some of the cast members, notably David Cross.) The blooper reel is definitely rated R for language and is far coarser than the intelligence of the show would have you otherwise believe.Overall I think ""Arrested Development"" is great, and should still be on the air. While this is not my favorite season, I still recommend this DVD set with the caveats that it is somewhat cruder and more politically inflammatory than the peerless first season.",4,A Good Season From The Best Cast On Television,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,2136,"['Arrested', 'Development', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'inventive', 'shows', 'history', 'adore', 'everything', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'had', 'couple', 'flat', 'moments', 'genius', 'was', 'particularly', 'amused', 'concept', 'Tobias', 'joining', 'Blue', 'Man', 'Group', 'found', 'reappearance', 'George', 'Senior', 'Kitty', 'appearance', 'Oscar', 'George', 'Senior', 'brain-fried', 'hippie', 'brother', 'likewise', 'hilarious', 'also', 'thought', 'treason', 'angle', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'was', 'cleverly', 'handled', 'found', 'characterization', 'Christianity', 'be', 'unnecessary', 'inaccurate', 'even', 'satire', 'Likewise', 'found', 'characterization', 'military', 'be', 'less', 'comedic', 'gold', 'do', 'think', 'undercurrent', 'wealthy', 'American', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'condescension', 'military', 'be', 'generally', 'accurate.The', 'acting', 'once', 'again', 'brilliant', 'scripts', 'consistently', 'deliver', 'unpredictable', 'hilarious', 'plot', 'twists', 'was', 'extremely', 'amused', 'interactions', 'Gob', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Buster', 'Tony', 'Hale', 'led', 'Buster', 'hand', 'being', 'bitten', 'off', 'seal', 'interactions', 'Lucille', 'Lucille', 'Two', 'be', 'wonderful', 'presence', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Maggie', 'was', 'also', 'strong', 'point', 'was', 'cameo', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Patten', 'far', 'best', 'guest', 'appearances', 'was', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Jr.', 'who', 'thanks', 'alopecia', 'wear', 'hilarious', 'assortment', 'wigs', 'fake', 'eyebrows', 'detach', 'most', 'unseemly', 'times.The', 'DVD', 'set', 'variety', 'extras', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'blooper', 'reel', 'several', 'commentaries', 'are', 'places', 'overtly', 'hostile', 'condescending', 'conservatives', 'Red', 'State', 'discussion', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'views', 'cast', 'members', 'notably', 'David', 'Cross', 'blooper', 'reel', 'definitely', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'far', 'coarser', 'intelligence', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'believe.Overall', 'think', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'great', 'should', 'still', 'be', 'air', 'not', 'favorite', 'season', 'still', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'caveats', 'somewhat', 'cruder', 'more', 'politically', 'inflammatory', 'peerless', 'first', 'season']",Arrested Development: Season 2
924444,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000A9QKRI,Robert Moore,"[19, 20]","Warning:  Some spoilers belowAfter a debut season that saw ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT win the Emmy for Best Comedy and just generally demonstrate that it was the most original new American comedy series in years, the show continued with a brilliant second season, more awards and critical acclaim, but still astonishingly few viewers.  Fans of the show wonder why everyone isn't watching it.  It has one of the most brilliant ensemble casts in memory, vastly higher production values of virtually all other American comedies (most are filmed before live audiences and minimal sets, which means few camera set ups, relatively inexpensive sets, and all around lowered costs), and brilliant writing that is genuinely funny.  I don't ever remember laughing at an episode of FRIENDS or EVERYBODY LOVE RAYMOND or countless other American sit coms that elicit smiles at most.  ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is one of the few truly funny shows American TV has produced.  Typically, as I write this review the show has had only 13 episodes ordered for the 2005-2006 season and although it has not been officially cancelled, no one imagines that it will be back on FOX for the 2006-2007 season.  The hopes of fans of the show have been bolstered of late, however, by the fact that both ABC and Showtime are interested in picking up the show.  While there is ""many a slip between the cup and the lip,"" this interest in a rational world seems not merely good news but inevitable.  What network wouldn't want to pick up the best comedy on TV?  On various boards fans are already lusting at a scenario whereby ABC pick up LOST and puts it on immediately before LOST, thereby creating the finest hour and a half of television of the week.If the show is not back next year, at least we have these brilliant DVDs.  I never fail to be astonished at both the marvelous creativity of the show's writers and the wonderful executive by the production team.  Just consider one thing:  most comedies are shot on stage and feature two or three cameras situated to capture the performances.  The notion of montage is irrelevant for such shows.  But ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT can feature a three-minute segment with a montage of 7 or 8 completely different set ups.  The time spent on producing a single episode must be extraordinary compared to a show like FRIENDS, where virtually all of the cost of the show is expended on salary, as opposed to ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, where the production costs are as large as the time expended making it.  If the show does go away after the painfully truncated Season Three, these DVDs will still be there to remind us of what a high quality production that we lost.And the cast!  I've played a game with my friends who are fans of the show.  I've asked them both to name their favorite cast member and the one they think was most expendable.  In each cast they found the first task difficult and the second impossible.  A couple said they perhaps liked Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth the most, but not especially more than the others.  But no one is dispensable.  Take away any cast member and the show would be diminished thereby.One thing I especially like about the show is the way that it continues a trend in television, a trend that a large number of the best shows on TV hold in common.  More and more shows are engaging in longer and longer story arcs, so that now the stories can extend over several seasons.  In this case, George Bluth, the head of the Bluth clan, has been imprisoned for financial wrongdoing at the Bluth Construction Company.  To make matter worse, it appears that he may have committed treason by building inside Iraq during the embargo.  At the end of Season One George escaped from jail and in Season Two he is ensconced in the attic of the model home many of the family members live in.  This overarching narrative holds the show as a whole together.  Along the way we get a host of ongoing jokes, such as Gob's (pronounced like Job, as in the Book of Job in the OT) countless pathetic magic tricks, the icky relationship between Lucille and her son Buster, and George's secretary Kitty flashing her artificially enhanced chest (so that she can appear on the video series ""Girls With Low Self-Esteem"") with the warning, ""This is the last time you'll see these.""  George-Michael has transferred his romantic intentions away from his cousin Maeby (who despite being 15 and in high school has somehow managed to become a Hollywood movie producer) to a Christian fundamentalist named Ann (whose minister father was played by the versatile Alan Tudyk, who in one calendar year played the robot in I, ROBOT, a pirate imitator in DODGEBALL, and a space ship pilot in SERENITY).  Tobias, meanwhile, striving to become an actor, has aspirations of joining the Blue Man Group (throughout the season, one sees random smudges of blue on the walls of the model home), while his wife Lindsay and he have agreed to have an open marriage, though neither manages to have a successful encounter with anyone else.  And poor Buster has his hand bitten off by a seal in the ocean, a seal that was accustomed to the taste of mammal flesh by none other than Gob.  The great string of guest appearances continued through out the season, with Season One performers such as Henry Winkler, Liza Minnelli, Carl Weathers, Judy Greer, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus joined by actors like Ben Stiller, Ed Begley Jr., Christine Taylor, Martin Short, Ione Skye, Dick Van Patten, and Zach Braff.  All this nuttiness has created what is for me the lone ""must see"" comedy show of the past ten years or so.  I just hope that after this year it hasn't become ""can't see"" TV.",5,A second incredible season for the best comedy on TV this century,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,5653,"['Warning', 'spoilers',

Tobias continues to pursue acting this season, and continues to be one of the best characters in the show.  Between the blue man group, ""scandel makers"", and Mrs. Featherbottom, the writers always give him something entertaining to do.  This is the season where Maybe begins her double life as a movie producer which makes her character that much more interesting, while George Michael struggle between his feelings for his cousin and his religious girlfriend Bland...

924458,AKIV6FWJPWZ0Y,B000A9QKRI,"Tara Plumeri ""Snow Bunny""","[5, 6]","How can FOX cancel this show ??  UGGHHH!!!!!!It looks as if Arrested Development's development has finally been arrested after two and a half years. Despite multiple Emmy nominations and wins, rapturous reviews from critics and fans, and a change of airdate, audiences continued to stay away. The network seemed to blame the producers for making the series too smart, while the producers implied that it was our fault the show was failing. I'll throw the blame directly at Fox. In Fall 2004, the company released the show's first season on DVD in an attempt to drum up interest in season two. I immediately became hooked, watched the set practically in one sitting, and vowed to watch season two when it was broadcast on Fox. This became easier said than done. Because of the vagaries of Sunday afternoon football schedules, Arrested Development never ran at its regularly scheduled time. It was impossible to even tape the show. I gave up, deciding to again wait for a DVD release. Now I've finished watching the brilliant Arrested Development: Season Two just in time for the series' cancellation.For those of you unfamiliar with the series - Arrested Development focuses on the Bluths, a family of California eccentrics (to put it kindly) who have amassed a fortune in frozen bananas and real estate development. In season one, family patriarch George Sr. (The Larry Sanders Show's Jeffrey Tambor) was thrown in prison for using the businesses' funds as his own personal bank till. His wife, Lucille (Jessica Walter), doesn't much care, as long as her line of credit at the liquor store is still good. Eldest son George ""Gob"" Bluth Jr. (Will Arnett) is a failed Segway-riding magician who more often kills his animal assistants than makes them disappear. College educated Michael (Little House on the Prairie's Jason Bateman) is seemingly the most normal of the Bluths, but the fact that he wants to run the family company throws his sanity into question. Michael's twin sister Lindsay (Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi), is a self-styled social activist whose latest cause is having an open marriage. Youngest son Buster (Tony Hale) is so emotionally and mentally stunted that he brings new meaning to the phrase ""mama's boy.""At the end of season one, Michael became fed up with his ungrateful family. It didn't help that his father escaped from jail, adding to his headaches. Michael decides to gather up George-Michael and head out of town, but is horrified to learn that his father signed a deal to build a subdivision in Iraq for Saddam Hussein. The scandal would, of course, ruin the family. And as president of the company, Michael would be held responsible. Will he stick around and help his family out of its latest mess?Arrested Development does not have the look or feel of a traditional sitcom. Its rhythms are closer to those of animated shows like The Simpsons and ""mockumentaries"" like The Office. The actors and writers can take the wildest material imaginable and make it seem perfectly reasonable. Tobias sees an audition flyer for Blue Man Group and attends, thinking it's a support group for depressed men. He gets hired to become an understudy - or at least he thinks he does since no one involved in the troupe actually gives him the job. He walks around for the rest of the season covered in blue body paint, leaving blue blotches on every surface he comes near. (As he tells Michael, ""I blue myself!"")And that's not even the weirdest stuff that goes on. Lucille enlists Buster in the Army after being confronted by filmmaker Michael Moore. Buster swims in the ocean for the first time, is attacked by a bowtie-wearing seal, and loses his hand in the process. He spends the rest of the season alternating between menacing his family with a hook and a wax hand. In true Arrested Development fashion, Gob was actually responsible for dumping the carnivorous seal in the ocean. One of his tricks went bad, a feral cat jumped into the seal's trunk, and now the creature has a taste for blood for animals larger than fish. Buster runs into his ex-girlfriend, Lucille 2 (Liza Minnelli) at a drag club called The Queen Mary. Lucille fires her maid and ""hires"" a Roomba to take her place.Season two is also fixated on Peanuts. In ""Good Grief,"" a depressed George-Michael shuffles down the street to the tune of ""Christmas Time Is Near,"" walking past a giant red doghouse with a beagle sleeping atop it. And Buster, for some unknowable reason, refers to his genitalia as his Linus and Charlie Browns. An odd tribute, perhaps, but funny nevertheless.The season isn't quite perfect. Sometimes it tries too hard. Martin Short's appearance as Uncle Jack in ""Ready, Aim, Marry Me!"" reeks of unfunny desperation. Ben Stiller as a pretentious magician in ""The Sword of Destiny"" is also a bit tiresome. These appearances detract from the show and its regular characters. Admittedly, the producers obviously did this to help goose ratings. It didn't work, though, so hopefully it isn't employed too often in their abbreviated season three.Other guests in the second season include Henry Winkler (Happy Days), Thomas Jane, Martin Mull, Malik Yoba, Ed Begley Jr. (St.. Elsewhere), Andy Richter, Jeff Garlin (Curb Your Enthusiasm), J.K. Simmons (Oz), Christine Taylor, Julia-Louis Dreyfus (Seinfeld), Amy Poehler (SNL), Carl Weathers, Dave Attell (Insomniac), Dan Castellanta (The Simpsons), Ione Skye, Alan Tudyk, Mario Joyner, Dick Van Patten, Zach Braff (Scrubs), and producer Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives).Be sure to watch the ""Next time..."" bits at the end of each episode. They have nothing whatsoever to do with the episode that follows. Instead, they feature funny gags that continue that episode's storylines.The eighteen episodes that make up season two are divided onto three discs. The discs are housed in slim, clear keepcases. The front covers are predominantly prison jumpsuit orange. The back covers feature episode titles, airdates, writing and directing credits, and brief synopses. Also included are a few stills from the series and a listing of the extras found on the discs. The interiors are simply white. The three keepcases slide into a cardboard sleeve, each side decorated with group photos of the cast. The cardboard case cleverly slides into a plastic outer sleeve. As with the first season, the overall design is simple and appealing.The DVD menus are also chic and stylish, mimicking the series' opening credits. Clips from the series play in windows on the main menu. From this menu, viewers can choose to play all episodes, access the extras and languages menus, or access the episode selection menu. The episodes are divided into chapters, but there are no scene selection menus.By TV DVDREVIEW",5,~*~* 6 Star Comedy Show ~*~*,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,6734,"['How', 'can', 'FOX', 'cancel',

While I appreciate that Fox kept the show on as long as it did, it's clear that there was a marginal promotional effort to make this critically acclaimed show a success (in fact a columnist from the S.F. Chronicle confirmed as much when he spoke to unnamed sources at Fox). That's too bad because the funniest show on TV has now been cancelled due to the dysfunctional family at Fox who are almost as bad but not as entertaining as the Bluth family.During the second season Michael(the droll and funny Jason Bateman) resigned as president of Bluth Homes not because he didn't feel he could pull the company together (which his family constantly sabotaged)but because his father broke out of jail and disappeared. When evidence comes up that his father George (the very funny Jeffrey Tambor)signed a contract to build homes with Saddam in Iraq, Michael could be put in jail because he was head of the company and there's no proof he didn't sign the documents. Meanwhile Gob (Will Arnett) continues to use magic to mystify and destroy his own life. When George is pronounced dead, Gob is determined to be buried in his place and ""rise from the grave"" to acclaim so he can make the cover of Poof magazine (the magazine for magicians). Meanwhile Lucille family matriarch (Jessica Walter) finds herself rekindling an affair with George's twin brother (also Jeffrey Tambor).  Buster (Tony Hale) is enlisted in the army at the after Michael Moore confronts Lucille about her patriotism and supposed involvement with iilegal stuff in Iraq. Sounds as convoulted as a soap opera doesn't it? That's what makes the show so darn funny. ""Arrested Development"" is the ""Soap"" and ""Seinfeld"" of its day redefining without the respect and audience it deserves.At least Fox Home Video has done right by the show. Nicely packaged in a see through sleeve with the discs housed individually within slimline cases, the packaging is only the tip of the iceberg for how this terrific show is presented. The extras include commentary tracks by cast and writers/directors, deleted scenes and a blooper reel, the first seaon in three minutes, ""The Immaculation Election"" campagin videos. Oh, and all 18 season two uncut episodes.""Arrested Development"" is a great package at a gret price. Like ""Seinfeld"" it's one of those comedy shows that you'll never grow tired of. The image quality is excellent with rich colors and hardly any issues with compression artifacts. The soundtrack is crystal clear throughout this season set.My wife had pity on me and gave me an early Xmas gift and let me relive the second season just as the third (and final) season is winding down.

I'm crazy about 30 Rock, Seinfeld, the Sarah Silverman Show, and Malcolm in the Middle. But I get the impression that A) folks who think David Cross is the alpha and omega of comedy are the majority of fans of AD (I have no regard for Mr. Cross, sorry) and B)the critics who graced this show with their praise were somehow, somewise sucking up to Ron Howard.Howard makes some great American films. This show just isn't the funniest thing he's been involved in.Maybe it's just me - but if it isn't, then this show is an over-hyped bore. Meanwhile, my $10 copy of AD season 2 will remain viewed once until my next yardsale.Ho Hum.  - J",2,Ho Hum...,1212278400,"06 1, 2008",2008,1439,"['Having', 'missed', 'shows', 'initial', 'telecast', 'being', 'exposed', 'only', 'recent', 'online', 'accolades', 'thought', 'was', 'fortunate', 'catch', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'sale', '10.00', 'thank', 'God', 'only', '10.00', '.There', 'much', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'ironic', 'commentary', 'Howard.But', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny.It', 'not', 'just', ""n't"", 'single', 'likeable', 'character', 'mean', 'likeable', 'even', 'way', 'say', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'likeable', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', '-It', 'not', 'just', 'ironic', 'commentary', 'shoots', 'action', 'still', 'taking', 'place', 'leaving', 'time', 'absorb', 'what', 'so', 'ironic', 'often', 'hackneyed', 'cliche', ""'d"", '-It', 'not', 'just', 'pacing', 'was', 'putting', 'sleep', 'speed', 'Howards', 'quips', '-To', 'be', 'fair', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'what', 'problem', ""'m"", 'crazy', '30', 'Rock', 'Seinfeld', 'Sarah', 'Silverman', 'Show', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'get', 'impression', 'A', 'folks', 'who', 'think', 'David', 'Cross', 'alpha', 'omega', 'comedy', 'are', 'majority', 'fans', 'AD', 'have', 'regard', 'Mr.', 'Cross', 'sorry', 'B', 'critics', 'who', 'graced', 'show', 'praise', 'were', 'somehow', 'somewise', 'sucking', 'up', 'Ron', 'Howard.Howard', 'great', 'American', 'films', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'funniest', 'thing', 'been', 'involved', 'just', ""n't"", 'then', 'show', 'over-hyped', 'bore', 'Meanwhile', '10', 'copy', 'AD', 'season', '2', 'will', 'remain', 'viewed', 'once', 'next', 'yardsale.Ho', 'Hum', 'J']",Arrested Development: Season 2
924466,A1MDJN25C9AUFF,B000A9QKRI,"Zach ""Zach""","[3, 4]","There's one way to watch season 2 of ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT-in two 9-episode marathons. I'd say all at once, but, by no fault of the show's, most people (including myself) just get antsy sitting in the same spot for so long. So why watch it all at once? Because that's the only way to appreciate everything that this show has to offer. In order to appreciate each episode, every other episode must be fresh in your head. Every joke, every offhand comment, everything. In fact, you should make a point of watching season 1 before season 2 arrives in the mail (or before you go out and buy it), especially if you haven't already watched each season 1 episode over 5 times (chances are, if you're buying this DVD you're already a fan and you already own season 1, so you should have...if you haven't, then I should tell, what they say that each time you watch it you find something new...is right. At least until around the fourth time, and then you occasionally find something new, but it's still worth watching anyway).Season 2 has tons of classics ...G.O.B. and Franklin, Buster's loose-seal ""accident"" (another reason why you should always go back and watch past episodes), Mae Whitman as the notoriously dull Egg, or, um...Anne-hog...er...um...Anne (whose school picture says underneath it ""NOT PICTURED""), Tobias and Lindsay's open-marriage, Buster's trip to Mexico, Martin Short as Uncle Jack, the return of Carl Weathers, G.O.B.'s constantly expanding  array of expensive suits, Tobias' return to being a never-nude, George Sr.'s tea parties and other attic expeditions, Gene Parmesan (AAAAAHH!!!!) and his many costumes, ICE, the bounty hunter/caterer, Buster's many dramatic realizations that he is in fact a monster, Motherboy XXX, the return of Liza Minnelli as Lucille 2 (I mean, Lucille Austero), Oscar's hints that he is really Buster's father, Barry Zuckerkorn (Henry Winkler) jumping the...I mean...A shark, the return of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Maggie Lizer (as in Maggie ""lies her"" ass off), who comes back packing a whole new set of lies for she and Michael to rekindle their built-on-lies relationship with, Stan Sitwell, Sally Sitwell, Tobias signing a release for the family to be featured on a show called ""Scandal Makers,"" which leads to Tobias getting panned by critics for his portrayal of George Sr., Dave Attell getting praised for his daring, cut-off-wearing performance as Tobias, and ARRESTED's narrator pointing out how sad that show's narrator is compared to his own gloriousness, the literal doctor (we lost him, looks dead, all-right), ""Meat the Veals"" (my personal favorite episode of the series), Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder, ""Good Grief,"" the episode that leaves everyone depressed, Maeby's new job, the return of Kitty, Buster's brief affair with Lupe, his mother's housekeeper, which leads Lucille to fire her, Lucille's new maid, Robot, whom Buster also sleeps with (""What did you expect mother? I'm half-machine!""), and of course, Tobias' British nanny alter-ego...Mrs. Featherbottom!!!!The extras on this set are sparse, which is somewhat of a letdown compared to the first season's set. My favorite extra from last season was all of the original songs by David Shwartz, and I'm pretty sure the music that plays whenever Oscar hints that he is Buster's father is new. The deleted scenes are nice, overall, the blooper real is better than most show's, and the ""Season 1 in 3 Minutes"" feature is nice, albeit running past 3 minutes (it has a 3.12 minute running time). The box layout is...well, it comes with a plastic case around it, and I hate those because they're not sturdy...in fact, I have a small collection of plastic cases that couldn't fit back around the DVDs. Underneath the plastic case however, is a cardboard case that's pretty much designed like the last DVD set but the back cover is just another picture, and the logo on the front is all orange, versus ARRESTED in orange and DEVELOPMENT in black. I like consistency, so I'm slightly peeved by the outside case, but hey, there have been many worse scenarios (my largest sum of rage is directed towards the difference between the PENN & TELLER: BULLSH*T season 1 and 2 sets).Overall, aside from two, that's it, TWO not-as-good-as-the-others-but-still-brilliant episodes, this is one terrific, excellent, spectacular, hilarious, witty, sly, and down-right great collection. In fact, this, in my opinion, is the single greatest season of any TV show ever. ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT is my favorite show, and I hope it remains as good as it was in the first two seasons throughout the remainder of the show (and assuming its ratings stay the same, that might not be too hard to accomplish). So far season 3 has been great, though...",5,The Best Purchase You'll Ever Make,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,4726,"['one', 'way', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT-in', 'two', '9-episode', 'marathons', ""'d"", 'say', 'once', 'fault', 'show', 'most', 'people', 'including', 'just', 'get', 'antsy', 'sitting', 'same', 'spot', 'so', 'long', 'So', 'why', 'watch', 'once', 'only', 'way', 'appreciate', 'everything', 'show', 'offer', 'order', 'appreciate', 'episode', 'other', 'episode', 'must', 'be', 'fresh', 'head', 'joke', 'offhand', 'comment', 'everything', 'fact', 'should', 'make', 'point', 'watching', 'season', '1', 'season', '2', 'arrives', 'mail', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'especially', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'watched', 'season', '1', 'episode', '5', 'times', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'buying', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'already', 'own', 'season', '1', 'should', 'have', 'have', ""n't"", 'then', 'should', 'tell', 'what', 'say', 'time', 'watch', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'right', 'least', 'fourth', 'time', 'then', 'occasionally', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyway', '.Season', '2', 'tons', 'classics', 'G.O.B', 'Franklin', 'Buster', 'loose-seal', 'accident', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'always', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'past', 'episodes', 'Mae', 'Whitman', 'notoriously', 'dull', 'Egg', 'um', 'Anne-hog', 'er', 'um', 'Anne', 'school', 'picture', 'NOT', 'PICTURED', 'Tobias', 'Lindsay', 'open-marriage', 'Buster', 'trip', 'Mexico', 'Martin', 'Short', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'return', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'G.O.B', 'constantly', 'expanding', 'array', 'expensive', 'suits', 'Tobias', 'return', 'being', 'never-nude', 'George', 'Sr.', 'tea', 'parties', 'other', 'attic', 'expeditions', 'Gene', 'Parmesan', 'AAAAAHH', 'many', 'costumes', 'ICE', 'bounty', 'hunter/caterer', 'Buster', 'many', 'dramatic', 'realizations', 'fact', 'monster', 'Motherboy', 'XXX', 'return', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'Lucille', '2', 'mean', 'Lucille', 'Austero', 'Oscar', 'hints', 'really', 'Buster', 'father', 'Barry', 'Zuckerkorn', 'Henry', 'Winkler', 'jumping', 'mean', 'A', 'shark', 'return', 'Julia', 'Louis-Dreyfus', 'Maggie', 'Lizer', 'Maggie', 'ass', 'who', 'back', 'packing', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'lies', 'Michael', 'rekindle', 'built-on-lies', 'relationship', 'Stan', 'Sitwell', 'Sally', 'Sitwell', 'Tobias', 'signing', 'release', 'family', 'be', 'featured', 'show', 'called', 'Scandal', 'Makers', 'Tobias', 'getting', 'panned', 'critics', 'portrayal', 'George', 'Sr.', 'Dave', 'Attell', 'getting', 'praised', 'daring', 'cut-off-wearing', 'performance', 'Tobias', 'ARRESTED', 'narrator', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'sad', 'show', 'narrator', 'compared', 'own', 'gloriousness', 'literal', 'doctor', 'lost', 'dead', 'all-right', 'Meat', 'Veals', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episode', 'series', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Tony', 'Wonder', 'Good', 'Grief', 'episode', 'everyone', 'depressed', 'Maeby', 'new', 'job', 'return', 'Kitty', 'Buster', 'brief', 'affair', 'Lupe', 'mother', 'housekeeper', 'Lucille', 'fire', 'Lucille', 'new', 'maid', 'Robot', 'whom', 'Buster', 'also', 'What', 'did', 'expect', ""'m"", 'half-machine', 'course', 'Tobias', 'British', 'nanny', 'alter-ego', 'Mrs', 'Featherbottom', 'extras', 'set', 'are', 'sparse', 'somewhat', 'letdown', 'compared', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'favorite', 'extra', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'original', 'songs', 'David', 'Shwartz', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'music', 'whenever', 'Oscar', 'Buster', 'father', 'new', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'nice', 'overall', 'blooper', 'real', 'better', 'most', 'show', 'Season', '1', '3', 'Minutes', 'feature', 'nice', 'running', 'past', '3', 'minutes', '3.12', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'box', 'layout', 'well', 'plastic', 'case', 'hate', ""'re"", 'not', 'sturdy', 'fact', 'have', 'small', 'collection', 'plastic', 'cases', 'could', ""n't"", 'fit', 'back', 'DVDs', 'plastic', 'case', 'however', 'cardboard', 'case', 'pretty', 'much', 'designed', 'last', 'DVD', 'set', 'back', 'cover', 'just', 'picture', 'logo', 'front', 'orange', 'versus', 'ARRESTED', 'orange', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'black', 'like', 'consistency', ""'m"", 'slightly', 'peeved', 'outside', 'case', 'hey', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'worse', 'scenarios', 'largest', 'sum', 'rage', 'directed', 'difference', 'PENN', 'TELLER', 'BULLSH*T', 'season', '1', '2', 'sets', '.Overall', 'aside', 'two', 'TWO', 'not-as-good-as-the-others-but-still-brilliant', 'episodes', 'one', 'terrific', 'excellent', 'spectacular', 'hilarious', 'witty', 'sly', 'down-right', 'great', 'collection', 'fact', 'opinion', 'single', 'greatest', 'season', 'TV', 'show', 'ever', 'ARRESTED', 'DEVELOPMENT', 'favorite', 'show', 'hope', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'remainder', 'show', 'assuming', 'ratings', 'stay', 'same', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'So', 'far', 'season', '3', 'been', 'great']",Arrested Development: Season 2
