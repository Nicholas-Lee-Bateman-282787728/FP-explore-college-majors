579953,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B00005B1ZR,Midwest Book Review,"[7, 7]","MPI Home Video breaks new and welcome ground with the launching of a series of classic television programs in a DVD format for the home entertainment market. The Rifleman was one of the most popular of the westerns that dominated a early decade of American television and starred Chuck Connors as Lucas McCain and Johnny Crawford as his son, Mark McCain. Volume 1 (07886-0314-0, [amt.], 140 minutes) of the Rifleman series begins the debut episode ""Sharpshooter"" which introduced the principle characters as Lucas and Mark arrive in the North Folk area to buy their own ranch. In ""Home Ranch"" the McCains find themselves targeted for expulsion by a highhanded trail boss and his crew. ""End Of A Young Gun"" has Lucas compelled to give refuge to a young bank robber whose leg had been injured while saving Mark from falling off a cliff -- the enforced stay with the McCain family has unexpected consequences! ""The Marshal"" introduced a series regular as Lucas gives work to a drunk who was once a famous lawman -- and helps Micah Torrance regain his sobriety and a place as the Marshall of North Fork. ""Duel Of Honor"" features an Italian Count provoked to a gun challenge by rowdy cowhands.",5,One of the most popular westerns,997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,1188,"['MPI', 'Home', 'Video', 'new', 'welcome', 'ground', 'launching', 'series', 'classic', 'television', 'programs', 'DVD', 'format', 'home', 'entertainment', 'market', 'Rifleman', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'westerns', 'dominated', 'early', 'decade', 'American', 'television', 'starred', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'son', 'Mark', 'McCain', 'Volume', '1', '07886-0314-0', '[', 'amt', ']', '140', 'minutes', 'Rifleman', 'series', 'debut', 'Sharpshooter', 'introduced', 'principle', 'characters', 'Lucas', 'Mark', 'arrive', 'North', 'Folk', 'area', 'buy', 'own', 'ranch', 'Home', 'Ranch', 'McCains', 'find', 'targeted', 'expulsion', 'highhanded', 'trail', 'boss', 'crew', 'End', 'A', 'Young', 'Gun', 'Lucas', 'compelled', 'give', 'refuge', 'young', 'bank', 'robber', 'leg', 'had', 'been', 'injured', 'saving', 'Mark', 'falling', 'off', 'cliff', 'enforced', 'stay', 'McCain', 'family', 'unexpected', 'consequences', 'Marshal', 'introduced', 'series', 'regular', 'Lucas', 'work', 'drunk', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'famous', 'lawman', 'Micah', 'Torrance', 'regain', 'sobriety', 'place', 'Marshall', 'North', 'Fork', 'Duel', 'Honor', 'Italian', 'Count', 'provoked', 'gun', 'challenge', 'rowdy', 'cowhands']",N/A
579954,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00005B1ZR,trebe,"[26, 27]","&quot;The Rifleman&quot; was on TV before I was born, and though I dimly remembered the show growing up, I really became acquainted with the program when it was carried for a time on the Family Channel a few years ago.  I enjoyed the program immensely, attracted by the relationship between Lucas McCain and his son Mark.  Wonderful acting by the tough as nails Chuck Connors, and the adorable Johnny Crawford.  Time really flies watching this program, it seems that it has only just begun, and then suddenly it's over.  The same can be said of this DVD, as the episodes seem to quickly slip by one after another.McCain is a single father, trying to find a new life with his son in North Fork.  His goal is to teach his son what he needs to know to survive in the old wild West.  McCain's methods are basic &quot;tough love&quot;, and may seem harsh by today's standards.  But underneath the gruff exterior, is the true warm love of a father for his son.  A similar treatment is applied to others undergoing life crisis, like the alcoholic Micah Torrance, and Michael Landon's outlaw character, as well as many others in future episodes in order to help them see the error of their ways.Issues of morality are typically presented as black and white, compromise is usually out of the question.  Justice is often administered by McCain's tricked out Winchester lever-action rifle.  Some episodes (particularly Peckinpah's), not necessarily in this collection, are particularly violent.  The violence is treated as necessary, but the dead are not dwelt upon, and therefore the effect is softened, and passes as we fade to the commercial break.  McCain kills only when forced to, and as a last resort.Others may not agree, but &quot;The Rifleman&quot; is a show about men, primarily for men.  Sure, it will find an audience with some women, but this show definitely has a masculine view of the world.  In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks, there may more of an audience for a program where moral issues are clear, and justice is swift.My only complaint is that there is not enough material included.  Five episodes is good, but six, seven, or eight would have been better.  Sorry, but I'm greedy, and don't want to buy an excessive number of DVD's to complete a series (like Star Trek or Twilight Zone).  Volumes 3 and 4 already scheduled for release, so we can look forward to more Rifleman DVD's.  Picture quality is excellent, and Elmer Bernstein's moving music comes in at all the right moments.Whether you are not familiar with this series or not, this is definitely the place to begin.  And thanks to MPI Home Video, there will be many more adventures on DVD to look forward to.  This collection is highly recommended, and the best is yet to come.",4,The Rifeman...The story begins.,1008201600,"12 13, 2001",2001,2756,"['quot', 'Rifleman', 'quot', 'was', 'TV', 'was', 'born', 'dimly', 'remembered', 'show', 'growing', 'up', 'really', 'became', 'acquainted', 'program', 'when', 'was', 'carried', 'time', 'Family', 'Channel', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'enjoyed', 'program', 'immensely', 'attracted', 'relationship', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'son', 'Mark', 'Wonderful', 'acting', 'tough', 'nails', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'adorable', 'Johnny', 'Crawford', 'Time', 'really', 'watching', 'program', 'only', 'just', 'begun', 'then', 'suddenly', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'seem', 'quickly', 'slip', 'one', 'another.McCain', 'single', 'father', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'son', 'North', 'Fork', 'goal', 'teach', 'son', 'what', 'know', 'survive', 'old', 'wild', 'West', 'McCain', 'methods', 'are', 'basic', 'quot', 'tough', 'love', 'quot', 'may', 'seem', 'harsh', 'today', 'standards', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'true', 'warm', 'love', 'father', 'son', 'similar', 'treatment', 'applied', 'others', 'undergoing', 'life', 'crisis', 'alcoholic', 'Micah', 'Torrance', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'outlaw', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'future', 'episodes', 'order', 'help', 'see', 'error', 'ways.Issues', 'morality', 'are', 'typically', 'presented', 'black', 'white', 'compromise', 'usually', 'question', 'Justice', 'often', 'administered', 'McCain', 'tricked', 'out', 'Winchester', 'lever-action', 'rifle', 'episodes', 'particularly', 'Peckinpah', 'not', 'necessarily', 'collection', 'are', 'particularly', 'violent', 'violence', 'treated', 'necessary', 'dead', 'are', 'not', 'dwelt', 'therefore', 'effect', 'softened', 'passes', 'fade', 'commercial', 'break', 'McCain', 'only', 'when', 'forced', 'last', 'resort.Others', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'quot', 'Rifleman', 'quot', 'show', 'men', 'primarily', 'men', 'Sure', 'will', 'find', 'audience', 'women', 'show', 'definitely', 'masculine', 'view', 'world', 'wake', 'recent', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'may', 'more', 'audience', 'program', 'where', 'moral', 'issues', 'are', 'clear', 'justice', 'swift.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'enough', 'material', 'included', 'Five', 'episodes', 'good', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Sorry', ""'m"", 'greedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'excessive', 'number', 'DVD', 'complete', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Twilight', 'Zone', '3', '4', 'already', 'scheduled', 'release', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'Rifleman', 'DVD', 'Picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'Elmer', 'Bernstein', 'moving', 'music', 'right', 'moments.Whether', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'not', 'definitely', 'place', 'begin', 'thanks', 'MPI', 'Home', 'Video', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'adventures', 'DVD', 'look', 'forward', 'collection', 'highly', 'recommended', 'best', 'yet', 'come']",N/A
