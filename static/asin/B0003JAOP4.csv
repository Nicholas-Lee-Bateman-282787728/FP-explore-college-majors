I will not go into any details so as not to try and promote my own theological positions.  The film is a bit &#34;rough&#34; on the edges, mainly for the cause of being authentic to &#34;real life,&#34; but I can overlook this because the questions that the film raises are so applicable to any discussion of God.  There are not a lot of films like this; I also thought the humor was well done.",5,Let's talk about God.,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,503,"['great', 'story', 'raising', 'many', 'issues', 'how', 'understand', 'God', 'how', 'lives', 'intersect', 'God', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'details', 'so', 'not', 'try', 'promote', 'own', 'theological', 'positions', 'film', 'bit', '34', 'rough', '34', 'edges', 'mainly', 'cause', 'being', 'authentic', '34', 'real', 'life', '34', 'can', 'overlook', 'questions', 'film', 'raises', 'are', 'so', 'applicable', 'discussion', 'God', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'films', 'also', 'thought', 'humor', 'was', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Since prayer doesn't help him--on the contrary--Seth decides to break every one of the Ten Commandments. That puts him on a strange path, where he reencounters his sister-in-law, who's stuck in a miserable marriage; and literally faces death.
