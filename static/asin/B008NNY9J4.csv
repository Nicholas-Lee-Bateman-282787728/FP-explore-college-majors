1571949,AIS3Q7ISV0WGQ,B008NNY9J4,Angel,"[6, 19]","Deadman Wonderl seemed like it had an interesting story. A boy's whole classroom is massacred, he is framed for it, and consequently put on death's row.I felt it could have in fact had something going for it. The general idea of the show revolving around the demented amusement park prison was disturbingly interesting. After I found out about the Deadmen and their powers, I thought, ""Hey, this could go somewhere. Maybe the main character will overcome great challenges and earn his freedom since he was innocent to begin with."" Sadly, I was naive and mistaken. The plot revolves around Ganta, who is a real pussy, and he has to win fights against other deadmen in order to survive. An interesting concept, except for the fact that well, Ganta is a wimp. I don't really even understand how he beats veteran deadmen and other strong opponents. It really doesn't make much sense. Anyway, the plot only gets worse and worse as the show progresses.blood and violence, which was probably the only good thing going for the show. However, I would probably much rather watch Hellsing over this.the characters are awful to me, main character. Little to no character development with other annoying characters as well. I think the only thing done right was the creepy ass Promoter being such a sadistic bastard. The other mention would probably be for Crow. He was a pretty cool character, it's too bad there wasn't much of a role for him in the later episodes.I felt this was actually fairly bad. I'm surprised I actually finished the whole thing, but I hate doing things halfway. In any case, I wouldn't recommend Deadman Wonderland unless there were nothing else really to watch.",2,Ehhh...,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,1674,"['Deadman', 'Wonderl', 'seemed', 'had', 'interesting', 'story', 'boy', 'whole', 'classroom', 'massacred', 'framed', 'consequently', 'put', 'death', 'row.I', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'fact', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'general', 'idea', 'show', 'revolving', 'demented', 'amusement', 'park', 'prison', 'was', 'disturbingly', 'interesting', 'found', 'out', 'Deadmen', 'powers', 'thought', 'Hey', 'could', 'go', 'somewhere', 'Maybe', 'main', 'character', 'will', 'overcome', 'great', 'challenges', 'earn', 'freedom', 'was', 'innocent', 'begin', 'Sadly', 'was', 'naive', 'mistaken', 'plot', 'Ganta', 'who', 'real', 'pussy', 'win', 'fights', 'other', 'deadmen', 'order', 'survive', 'interesting', 'concept', 'fact', 'well', 'Ganta', 'wimp', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'understand', 'how', 'veteran', 'deadmen', 'other', 'strong', 'opponents', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'Anyway', 'plot', 'only', 'worse', 'worse', 'show', 'progresses.blood', 'violence', 'was', 'probably', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'show', 'However', 'would', 'probably', 'much', 'rather', 'watch', 'Hellsing', 'this.the', 'characters', 'are', 'awful', 'main', 'character', 'Little', 'character', 'development', 'other', 'annoying', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'only', 'thing', 'done', 'right', 'was', 'creepy', 'ass', 'Promoter', 'being', 'such', 'sadistic', 'bastard', 'other', 'mention', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'Crow', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'character', 'too', 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'role', 'later', 'episodes.I', 'felt', 'was', 'actually', 'fairly', 'bad', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'actually', 'finished', 'whole', 'thing', 'hate', 'doing', 'things', 'halfway', 'case', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Deadman', 'Wonderland', 'were', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'watch']",N/A
1571950,A33QCIIA7W3ECA,B008NNY9J4,Archer Lamb,"[14, 17]","I'd give the anime thus far a 5/5. The only reason I chose 4 stars was the excessive price. $50 is a bit much--despite it being a ""special edition""--considering this is only the first season of the anime. I would recommend this anime to anyone, but for those who have yet to watch I would say wait for a price drop or another edition in the $30 range. If you have seen it and it has become one of your favorite animes, then by all means buy this version. I have pre-ordered this version because I do find it to be an amazing anime. It is still a work in progress and there are currently 51 chapters in the manga, 21 of which where used in creating these episodes. The author is currently on hiatus due to a pregnancy so it may be awhile before a 2nd season is created but I'd give it a year at most. I thought the dubbing was done very well and the story was well made. Some people complain about the character flaws but that is what makes them realistic and more gritty. If you have the money I do highly recommend but if not, just wait till the holiday season when there will surely be some sort of price drop or a more affordable edition released. If you decide not to buy, I still recommend you find somewhere to watch this anime whether you are a anime fan or not.

1571952,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B008NNY9J4,Coulter Rail,"[0, 0]","I'll skip the preamble and just roll into pros and cons.***PROS***CHARACTER DESIGN was great. I've seen a bad-ass with an eye patch one too many times, but this still worked. Right when I think I'd seen each one of these characters a thousand times before, they give me just enough of a variation to convince me that they were original. On seeing the characters alone, I was intrigued. As for their depth, it's good enough for the story and you'll be able to pick favorites.ANIMATION/ACTION was solid and fluid. There are enough great motions, fluid animation, and unique death scenes to satisfy. As they move into the middle of the series, HERE COME THE FREEZE-FRAMES and lazy directing tricks to skip actual animation (yet not enough to really piss me off).STORY. Who cares. The promise of story is in the premise that has been laid out. It's a prison where inmates duel to the death and eat (candy) to keep their collars from poisoning them. This is set up to be fan service and kick-ass encounters. If you're going into this attempting to elevate your thoughts (Evangelion), or be emotionally wracked through a gut-wrenching test of character evolution (Berserk/Elfen Lied), then you haven't done your pre-buying homework. This one works very well in terms of pacing and keeping the viewer interested in where it's going (at first . . . please read on).***CONS***DECAPITATION SYNDROME is the label I give to shows that lose their concept, stray from the premise and, in an effort to push mediocre to epic, chop their heads off and run around like a chicken, kicking the entire structure of their show until it falls apart. Deadman Wonderland suffers from this. Hark! Beware the coming of the guitar villain. There are so many interesting and superbly designed characters in this show, and then they vanish. The tough bitch G-cup warden seems content being completely removed from the storyline. The ""Man in Red"" master boss evaporates into a memory. He's replaced by a butt-rocker monk with jaded haikus, beads that nullify the heroes' powers, and a bazooka guitar. Despite the wonderful character art thus far, this guy looks like he's been scooped up from a Bleach waste basket.  He then takes center stage across from the pacifist leader (who was also forced on us) and they make it about them. It's not awful, but VERY DISAPPOINTING.And that's about it. This has some really enjoyable moments. If you're not thrown off by lost potential, then this show might hit the spot. It's better than most, worth a watch (first half), and packed with some respectable fan service.I really love anime when it works. I'm an animator and writer myself, so I'm also pouring through the stacks looking for gems. I'll be doing a lot more reviews. If you find that these are helpful or our tastes align, follow along.  I'll try not to steer you into s***.",3,"Great Concept, Admirable Fan Service, Shameful Follow-Through",1378598400,"09 8, 2013",2013,2845,"[""'ll"", 'skip', 'preamble', 'just', 'roll', 'pros', 'cons', '***PROS***CHARACTER', 'DESIGN', 'was', 'great', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'bad-ass', 'eye', 'patch', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'worked', 'Right', 'when', 'think', ""'d"", 'seen', 'one', 'characters', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'give', 'just', 'enough', 'variation', 'convince', 'were', 'original', 'seeing', 'characters', 'alone', 'was', 'intrigued', 'depth', 'good', 'enough', 'story', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'favorites.ANIMATION/ACTION', 'was', 'solid', 'fluid', 'are', 'enough', 'great', 'motions', 'fluid', 'animation', 'unique', 'death', 'scenes', 'satisfy', 'move', 'middle', 'series', 'HERE', 'COME', 'THE', 'FREEZE-FRAMES', 'lazy', 'directing', 'tricks', 'skip', 'actual', 'animation', 'yet', 'not', 'enough', 'really', 'piss', 'off', '.STORY', 'Who', 'promise', 'story', 'premise', 'been', 'laid', 'out', 'prison', 'where', 'duel', 'death', 'eat', 'candy', 'keep', 'collars', 'poisoning', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'fan', 'service', 'kick-ass', 'encounters', ""'re"", 'going', 'attempting', 'elevate', 'thoughts', 'Evangelion', 'be', 'emotionally', 'wracked', 'gut-wrenching', 'test', 'character', 'evolution', 'Berserk/Elfen', 'Lied', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'pre-buying', 'homework', 'one', 'very', 'well', 'terms', 'pacing', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'interested', 'where', 'going', 'first', 'please', 'read', '***CONS***DECAPITATION', 'SYNDROME', 'label', 'give', 'shows', 'lose', 'concept', 'stray', 'premise', 'effort', 'push', 'mediocre', 'epic', 'chop', 'heads', 'run', 'around', 'chicken', 'kicking', 'entire', 'structure', 'show', 'apart', 'Deadman', 'Wonderland', 'suffers', 'Hark', 'Beware', 'coming', 'guitar', 'villain', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'superbly', 'designed', 'characters', 'show', 'then', 'vanish', 'tough', 'bitch', 'G-cup', 'warden', 'content', 'being', 'completely', 'removed', 'storyline', 'Man', 'Red', 'master', 'boss', 'memory', 'replaced', 'butt-rocker', 'monk', 'jaded', 'haikus', 'nullify', 'heroes', 'powers', 'bazooka', 'guitar', 'wonderful', 'character', 'art', 'thus', 'far', 'guy', 'been', 'scooped', 'up', 'Bleach', 'waste', 'basket', 'then', 'center', 'stage', 'pacifist', 'leader', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'forced', 'make', 'not', 'awful', 'VERY', 'DISAPPOINTING.And', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'moments', ""'re"", 'not', 'thrown', 'off', 'lost', 'potential', 'then', 'show', 'might', 'hit', 'spot', 'better', 'most', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'packed', 'respectable', 'fan', 'service.I', 'really', 'love', 'anime', 'when', ""'m"", 'animator', 'writer', ""'m"", 'also', 'pouring', 'stacks', 'looking', 'gems', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'lot', 'more', 'reviews', 'find', 'are', 'helpful', 'tastes', 'align', 'follow', 'along', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'steer', 's***']",N/A
1571953,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008NNY9J4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 3]","From the creators of ""Eureka Seven"" comes a violent sci-fi prison anime series known as ""Deadman Wonderland"".  Created by Jinsei Kataoka and illustrated by Kazuma Kondou, ""Deadman Wonderland"" was a manga series published in Shonen Ace back in 2007.An anime adaptation based on the first 21 chapters was created and released on Japanese television from April through July 2011 and aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block.The anime production is by manglobe and is directed by Koichi Hatsumi (Aishiteruze Baby"", ""Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor"", ""Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit""), series composition by Yasuyuki Muto (""Basilisk"", ""Afro Samurai"", ""Sengoku Basara - Samurai Kings""), character designs by Masaki Yamada (""Appleseed"", ""Bubblegum Crisis: Tokyo 2040&#8243;, ""Great Dangaioh""), art direction by Michie Watanabe (""Eureka Seven"", ""Haibane Renmei"", ""Wolf's Rain"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam Seed"") and music by NARASAKI (""Penguin Drum"", ""Dragon Crisis!"", ""Aquarian Age the Movie"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""Deadman Wonderland"" is presented in 16:9 widescreen with audio presented in Japanese and English 2.0.  The character designs and animation are very cool and chaotic at times!  As one should expect from a violent anime series, there is a lot of blood featured in ""Deadman Wonderland"".  Not because many people are killed, but also because the Deadmen's ""Branch of Sin"" powers is about utilizing one's blood to create weapons.  So, a character like Senji can create a large sword using his blood.  Or Minatsuki who uses her hair to turn into blades and impale enemies or grab hold of them.But when it comes to animation, Manglobe did a wonderful job balancing out animation with CG.  I am a bit surprised that this series was not anime series released on Blu-ray, since it was released on Blu-ray and DVD in  Japan.As for audio, audio for the series is primarily Japanese and English 2.0 stereo.  But as the Japanese soundtrack is well-done especially during the more emotional scenes, the English dub actually makes things much more intriguing because as one would expect in a prison, these people talk with a lot of profanity.  In fact, this is probably the most profane when it comes to dialogue that you will hear on a FUNimation animated series, also with the audio commentary as the English dub voice talent go crazy with the F-bombs and C-word.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Deadman Wonderland"" comes with the following special features:Episode 6 Audio Commentary - Featuring Audio commentary with Leah Clark and Aaron Dismuke.  (Note: Because this anime series is rated mature, the audio commentary features profanity)Episode 12 Audio Commentary - Featuring Audio commentary with Monica Rial and Greg Ayres. (Note: Because this anime series is rated mature, the audio commentary features profanity)U.S. Video Commentary - (24:27)  A wonderful video commentary with ADR Director Joel McDonald and voice talent Greg Ayres, Monica Rial and Leah Clark.Promo Videos - (6:57) Japanese promotional videos for ""Deadman Wonderland"".Original Commercials - (1:25) Japanese commercials for the Blu-ray and DVD releaseTextless Opening Song ""One Reason""Textless Opening Song ""One Reason"" (Director's Version)Textless Closing Song ""Shiny Shiny""U.S. TrailerJUDGMENT CALL:From the creators of ""Eureka Seven"" comes a new, violent and bloody anime series titled ""Deadman Wonderland""!But while the anime series may prove to be too violent for some viewers, the concept is quite interesting.  Because Japan is in dire need to rebuild after a devastating earthquake, one of the popular areas of entertainment is the ""Deadman Wonderland"" theme park facility.While the place attracts many people and makes quite a bit of money, not many people realize that inside the theme park is where gladiator battles between Deadmen take place.  And of course, the scientists of the facility are experimenting on the prisoners for the sake of monetary and political gain (of course, in the effort to help rebuild Japan).What is interesting about the series is that the prison is home to vicious criminals, but somehow, Ganta Igarashi, a middle school student is targeted and framed for murdering his classmates and then being injected with the Deadman power, which is utilizing one's blood to become a weapon of destruction.And so, this meek boy must be put in a prison full of dangerous criminals.  Ganta is your banal weak character who gets stronger as he learns to become brave and wants to protect the people that he cares about.Then you have Shiro, a mysterious albino girl who loves being around Ganta.  We know that she is gifted with amazing power but at the same time, she is naive and is always cheerful, wanting to play or eat pudding.But the series features really interesting characters.  Some who are jerks and badasses, and some who are are just really wicked looking.  And for the most part, by the second half of season one, these characters start to become an integral part of this series.The 12-episode TV series plays out like a prison-escape film, but each time Ganta encounters people who also want to escape from prison, there is always an antagonist who are Deadmen with amazing power and happen to be quite sadistic.  Also, included is an OVA, but instead of featuring Ganta and Shiro, it focuses on Deadman Senji, who becomes a police officer two years after the Red Hole incident.While the series is violent and bloody, the English dub takes the series dialogue and enhances it was mature language, to make it more raw and real and what you would expect from a major prison holding the worst criminals.The dialogue that you hear, coming out of the mouths of the characters is really surprising because it's really profane.  Shocking even the voice talent who were beaming about playing these roles, because they had the opportunity to really say some crazy, dirty and profane dialogue.The only caveat with the series is that it ends in hopes that a second season would perhaps continue the storyline and end it with a similar ending to the manga series.  There are a lot of questions that were not answered in the first season and unfortunately, the second audio commentary does spoil things by providing the answer of who exactly was responsible for murdering all the students and Ganta being framed for it.  So, if you don't want to know, it's best not to listen to the second audio commentary.As for the animation, expected to see a lot of red blood splashing everywhere.  Not because of people getting murdered or maimed, but it's because the Deadman's power is the ability to use their blood to form weapons.  It's not that scary, there are people getting slaughtered but it's not too gory.  But the animation from Manglobe was wonderful and it's a shame that the series was not released on Blu-ray, as it was released on BD and DVD in Japan.As for special features, there are two naughty audio commentaries and as a FUNimation first, a video commentary which I hope becomes common in all upcoming Blu-ray and DVD releases from FUNimation!  But you also get promo videos, commercials and textless opening and closing songs.While ""Deadman Wonderland"" has similarities to films such as ""Battle Royale"" and maybe even a little ""Hunger Games"" mixed in with anime series such as ""Guyver"", the violence is not too bad and the story is actually quite fascinating and action-packed.  Also, I have to give FUNimation a thumbs up.  Although I'm not too big on profane anime series, the dialogue for ""Deadman Wonderland"" fit.  It's a prison setting filled with vicious criminals, so why not make the dialogue fit the setting.  And the writers at FUNimation did just that!For anime fans wanting a more mature and violent, bloody anime series, you'll definitely want to give ""Deadman Wonderland"" a chance!",4,"For those who enjoy more mature, violent and bloody anime series will surely enjoy this chaotic, action-packed series",1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,7809,"['creators', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'violent', 'sci-fi',

1571955,A1MGSCEL1VVM5F,B008NNY9J4,Jayson Klein,"[1, 1]","Others have summed up the premise and some spoilers (I intend to do the same, since it's vital to those who have NEVER HEARD OF DWL), so I figure I'll lay some things out, from seeing this series, beginning to end, in one sitting.I DO love this series, and if I had the power, I'd find a way to fund a second season (if the reason WAS ONLY poor ratings in Japan, and not the more vital addition of one of the creators being on maternity leave... which I am ok with). But since I can't and the latter reason is a acceptable reason to be on hiatus, I can only HOPE that US ratings will help this become a reality, much like how we got a 2nd Season of Big O (poor ratings in Japan, GREAT ratings in the US).But now to the meat: This series takes you on so many twists and turns (positive and negative, for the characters, anyways), all being a bloodsport (Deadman Wonderland) wrapped in a bright colorful bow (the fact that the actual place is a carnival-themed entertainment for the masses... while the prisoners.... well... suffer), that you can't help BUT keep watching. Our 14-year-old protagonist (Ganta) is wrongfully accused of a mass-murder in his own school, as being the sole survivor of said mass-murder by a man covered in red... clothing, if you will (more like restraints). The boy is then imprisoned in Deadman Wonderland, where you not only have to compete in twisted games and sports to survive, but also to earn ""candy"", since the collar around his neck and all the prisoners' necks pump poison if they don't get their fix within 3 days.At first, it would seem almost a modern-ish Now and Then, Here and There (which I hated), IF it wasn't for the fact that some of these prisoners (in a separate block from the other scum) are contaminated with a strange virus that allows them to use their blood like weapons, protagonist included (but he realizes this a few episodes in, not off of the bat), all while meeting a same-aged strange albino girl that acts more like a young child (named Shiro); and meeting with and dealing with a rich cast of characters and supporting characters, from a ballsy and hot female prison guard (Makina) who lets her sword do the talking as she strongly enforces order in this madhouse, to a spiky-haired badass (Senji, aka ""Crow"") who can create blades out of his own blood, who earns Ganta's respect after the poor boy beats him... all at the expense of losing an eye after he loses, to a deceivingly-sweet girl (Minatsuki, aka ""Hummingbird"") with a thing for flowers who eventually shows she's actually anything BUT sweet (in more ways than one, and that's stating it LIGHTLY), to the man-childish ""warden""/""lawyer"" (Tamaki) who got Ganta stuck in DWL in the first place, to a band of rebels who simply wish to escape, divulge Deadman Wonderland's hideous darkside, and to try and live normal lives again. And that's only about two-thirds if not slightly less of the main cast I mentioned here.How will our poor victim of a crooked judicial system get out, let alone survive a twisted carney-themed jail?  Will this twisted societal experiment called Deadman Wonderland be seen for the snuff-show it truly is. And who is this albino girl who says she knows Ganta, while he has no memory of her at all?This DVD series is rated TV MA, and is Uncut. Yes, it has a lot of violence (normal and fantasy), blood (normal, and used as weapons), language (a fair amount of it, but Minatsuki's the WORST), semi-partial nudity (bout.... maybe 5 times in the entire show, give or take?) and a good deal of adult situations (some funny, most NOT!)... but despite the mature rating, you may surprisingly get into this anime more easily than you think (if you have a strong enough stomach; this is NOT an anime for softees or the easily-offended).Ok, now onto the other stuff... I was somewhat disappointed at the commentary, since it seemed the cast was MORE than happy to talk more about other things than the show (C'mon Funimation, be professional: I wanna hear cast's thoughts on the show and their takes on it, than about their ""personal"" lives). I felt the use of dark made it difficult to make out in some scenes what was going on; I'm not sure if that was intentional, or if the video didn't show up well when it was put on the DVD (that's not Funimation's fault... if it was the former).I like this series, but I feel like I don't want to shell out money for books, especially, if a 2nd season DOES get done (one can hope, considering this economy, and how interested the original company who made this anime is interested if demand here isn't high enough), how much or how little it'll deviate from the books (I mean, look at the first incarnation of the Fullmetal Alchemist anime. How much THAT deviated from the books).Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 (but I'm giving it a 5 since the show has gotten me THAT fascinated)",5,Welcome...

1571956,A2YX7Z7VEC7J31,B008NNY9J4,Johnnie Lewis,"[0, 2]","The anime: Deadman Wonderland is a temporary cure for violence only because its short. This twisted nightmare of an anime is not only at some times hard to watch but it also doesn't let thinly veiled love story/friendship plots hamper or stop the violence. The main character: Ganta Igarashi was a regular kid until he was set up for a surprise mass murder that he didn't commit but was made the fall guy of anyway! As Ganta is put on Death Row by the courts he's sent to an amusement park/prison to serve his time. As the story progresses the storyline itself will produce more questions such as ""How does a person forget about growing up during the planning stages of a prison?"" or ""How do you get super powers from an earthquake?"" The cruel, unusual, and often silly ways the characters are reintroduced back into reality from those fleeting dreams of happiness and freedom in their former lives is heartbreaking. You'll start to feel the same way the characters are feeling as they're begging for the nightmare to be over! Again the anime itself is short and notoriously incomplete! Even the OVA doesn't finish tying everything up! Spoiler Alert: Its just another back story! Rent this first before buying it! Oh and keep in mind as you learn about everybody's former life before entering prison one thing stayed constant. Just after everybody realized they had strange powers they all developed a thirst for killing and were sent to a place that mainly profited off that very need to kill!

1571958,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008NNY9J4,J. Richardson,"[1, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Note 2: Score reflects the anime and the packaging together.Oh boy. What can I say about Deadman Wonderland? Well, to start, this show is not for children. Not only is there violence throughout this 12 episode season, but the swearing is constant and some images may be frighting to some children. I figured I'd break this down into two parts: the anime and the packaging. Normally I wouldn't do that, but I have mixed feelings towards what you actually get in this box set.Anime:If you still don't know the basic premise of Deadman Wonderland I'll give you a brief rundown of what's going on. The story starts with middle school student Ganta Igarashi in his classroom waiting for class to start. Then, out of nowhere, a mysterious man in a red cape comes and slaughters everyone in the class except for Ganta. Since he was the only survivor, he is seen as the only possible suspect and is sentenced to capital punishment in Deadman Wonderland. To the general public Deadman Wonderland is just an amusement park, but it's also the home to a very dark prison.Ganta's mission is to find out what's going on and who the ""Red Man"" is. Along the way you meet fellow inmates Yo Takami, Kiyomasa Senji (aka Crow), Minatsu Takami (aka Hummingbird), as well as others including the mysterious Shiro. Overall I loved the story. I tried to keep the more detailed stuff out, but from start to finish Deadman Wonderland is a joy to watch. Not only does the action keep you on the edge of your seat, but there's enough little plot twists thrown in there to keep the story interesting. As if it wasn't interesting enough with the basic premise of the show.The animation was done beautifully, but there were some parts (mostly in the very first scene) where things got extremely dark and I had to strain my eyes to make out what was going on. Each character has their own distinct look and personality and I found myself falling in love with all of them, even the extremely weird Tsunenaga Tamaki, who is the guy running this messed up prison. Along with the animation you had an amazing cast of voice actors who did a fantastic job at bringing these characters to life. Overall a great series and I can't say I have any huge gripes regarding it. 10/10Packaging:The Deadman Wonderland box set spans three separate discs. The box itself is gorgeous. I loved the whole carnival theme on the front and I liked the fact that the box was made out of a thick cardboard. It's something different from your usual anime box set. However I didn't like the artwork on the back of the box. It made Ganta look like he was a lesbian chick who was in love with Shiro. It just looks weird.On disc one you have episodes 1-7 along with a commentary on episode 6. On disc two you have the remaining episodes 8-12 along with a commentary on episode twelve, an OVA titled ""The Red Knife Wielder"", and some trailers. Then the third, and final, disc contains one more commentary on episode seven along with text-less versions of the intro and outro and the original Japanese promo videos, commercials, and previews that were made for the show.To be quite honest I think they could have made everything fit on two discs. Not only would it have cut down production cost, but in a world where everyone is ""thinking green"" this is the furthest thing from environmental friendly. They could've technically knocked out one of the DVD cases which would have eliminated the need for a box. What I would have done is put the three commentaries, the OVA, and all the other extra stuff on one disc and had all the episodes on another. Because if you look on the back of the discs you can see all the unused space.Honestly the bonus material on here is pretty lackluster. I watched two of the three commentaries and they didn't really do anything for me. And while I loved that the OVA gave us an insight into Senji's past I was a little let down by it. It just didn't have that same flare that the main episodes had. Then the commercials and stuff are pretty useless and I pretty much forgot about them after I watched them. 6/10Overall Score: 8/10 - As you can see the anime itself is amazing and I loved every minute of it, but the extra's were weak and the packaging wasn't very practical. Was it worth the original price tag of $50? Not really. Do I regret making the purchase? Definitely not. I love this series and I'm glad I was able to snag a copy before they went out of stock.

1571959,AMYSV3PZLNDCS,B008NNY9J4,Just some old guy.,"[0, 0]","This was a pretty good show in my eyes. I caught this on Crunchyroll via Roku. It was subtitled only,none the less it kept my attention for all 12 episodes.Slight Spoiler.....just the first couple episodes/premises.A normal school kid vegitating as he looks out the window. Suddenly he notices someone or something hovering outside the school window. Then the windows explode, he is thrown and when he looks around all of his classmates have been brutally murdered. Then the murderer comes towards him and implants a mysterious red crystal like object in his chest....lights out. He awakes to find himself handcuffed to a gurney..he is accused of killing all his classmates and sent to ""Deadmans Wonderland"" a privately owned prison where things are not what they seemed. He finds out that the crystal in his chest has infected him and given him the power to control his blood...and use it as a weapon.Nobody believes that he is innocent and he must prove it on his own. In prison he learns of others like him and that the mysterious killer (aka The Red Man) is also there. Yet before he can confront this other killer he is thrown into a ring and forced to fight others like him.There is a lot more to the series than just what little I have told you but you get the idea. There are numerous characters you meet along the way and it really never gets boring. There is blood and language however there was no nudity in the version I saw...they drop the f-bomb several times and many other words. At the time I wrote this I had not seen the English dub...well I have seen the English dub and the language is just as brutal if not more than the Japanese dialogue.This is a straight forward show and does not have comedy or any fan service which keeps with the prison setting.I would rate this 4 and half stars. Some of the other things I like are Black Blood Brothers..Elfen Lied..Jui oh Sei. If you like any of those then you should like this.

1571964,A278YDAPY4OWFP,B008NNY9J4,"OKAMI ""LANDA""","[3, 21]","First of all this review is not for the fans, with that aside I'm not sure what everyone here is talking about. We probably didn't watch the same series because anyone who made it to the ending realized that this show had so much going on that failed in its conclusion.You know that feeling you get when there's suppose to be another 10-12 episodes but they ran out of money and decided to use it for a teaser to the manga (Claymore anime)?  Deadman Wonderland is one of the most bizarre, odd and weakest anime adaptations ever made for TV, from the beginning to its punishing ending this thing barely makes any sense, and is very sad because its premise was promising and intriguing.Ganta is the main character of the show, a boy who suffers a paranormal event involving the death of his friends and classmates, all killed by a strange man covered in blood with a crimson armor, but instead of killing Ganta, he embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta's chest.  After the massacre Ganta is declared the sole suspect and following a quick trial, is sentenced to life imprisonment in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.My first of many complains in this story is the setting, which it's in a not too distant future and in a not believable one.  PLEASE I kindly ask if you are going to make a story, a TV series, anime, movie or write a book, please-PLEASE DON'T give it a date, it's the problem I have with so many movies from the 80's always waiting for THE YEAR 2000, yeah I'm talking about Escape from New York, 1997 my ass, with that aside, I'm going point out obvious2nd. It seems the future in this thing there won't be human rights activists to put a stop to the cruelty of those brutal games in prison, also courts will have enough power to give an underage suspect the death penalty, oh yes, just a SUSPECT without any physical evidence for killing all those students in that classroom!3rd. It is established early in the show that in order to survive they must win the ""games"", in that way they will acquire credit points and the precious medicine called ""Candy"" which will give 24 hours more to live, otherwise they will die of poisoning, yeah sounds original, the problem with this logic is that the ""Candy"" was never mention again only up until the last episode.4th. the prison was built with the appearance of an amusement park (there is your title) and just like in every other prison of the future, is filled with guards, army squadrons, an uncorrupted high technology security system and security director who looks like a muscle man with boobs or like a huge lesbian, I would have believe more in this character if instead of using an ugly woman would have been a huge man, also if the producer was trying to built a weird fan base that are into manly looking women out of this character then I wish him good luck with that fetish.5th. The first and sadly the only good game is a death race where all the participants must survive the deadly obstacles in order to get the goal, think of it as NINJA WARRIOR only with death and punishment involved.  The other and last game was ""The Birdcage"" which is a caged match, the only difference is that if you lose the prison will take a limb or an organ from the loser, and we had two matches, and that's it for the games.6th. The highly dangerous prisoners have their personal bar, where all of them can gather, play pool, have some drinks, and make conspiracies against the prison, WTF?! I wonder what ever happened to all those guards and high-tech security system.  BTW those dangerous prisoners are actually very friendly, WTF?!7th. The Lolita with the huge sword, WHY?!!!, how come a little girl is in prison? Other than just to have fan service for the audience, It is beyond any possible logic to explain, and the reasons of why she is in prison are very weak, I'm sure that in the future there won't be reformatories for children like her, but the fact that she is one the main antagonist of the show makes this anime a huge waste of time.8th. The connection between Ganta and his loyal friend Shiro was never explained, the only thing I learned was that she was part of an experiment and that's it no reason why she had white hair or wearing that suit or those gloves, why she was walking up and down in that prison, why she was able to turn into that monster and there's no reason why YOU should care because the ending is just punishing leaving the viewers with more questions than answers, but it was coming because the manga is not even over in Japan.This is not Escape from Alcatraz hell it is not even Jail Breakers (I love that movie), overall Deadman Wonderland is not terrible but it's definitely not good, but all those problems in the show makes this anime a total waste of time, I just hate the fans that apparently show their support for trash like this, anyone remembers the good days in anime like Read or Die, Paranoia Agent, Hellsing or Elfen Lied?  Yeah those were good days.AND seriously read the manga which is way better. 1 out of 5.",1,A Real Review,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,5037,"['First', 'review', 'not', 'fans', 'aside', ""'m"", 'not',

1571966,A94NOJCJCI6PB,B008NNY9J4,Sean,"[0, 1]","When I was recommended Deadman Wonderland I was told it was the next best thing to watching Elfen Lied and had a pretty nifty plot and some cool ideas. What I wasn't told was that I would be subjected to another unlikeable protagonist and all the cool ideas seem to get thrown out the window halfway through this twelve episode romp and are replaced by a fairly uninventive, though still entertaining second act.The reviews for this show are fairly mixed, and I can see where you can love it or you can hate it. First of all let's look at the story. Ganta Igarashi is in middle school, has a bunch of friends, and is the only survivor when his whole classroom in brutally murdered by a person simply known as the Red Man. Ganta is framed for the murders and sent off to a prison called Deadman Wonderland, a privately owned facility that doubles as a kind of amusement park where the prisoners perform for the civilians. This idea is fairly cool and it gets even cooler when we learn that the prisoners also participate in death games such as obstacle courses full of guillotines, electrified water and snipers. There are also fights called the Carnival of Corpses that are one on one battles between the prisoners. This was awesome. Another plus were the Branches of Sin, something never explained in the anime where a prisoners blood can be used as a weapon. Ganta for instance can shoot blood bullets and Senji Kiyomasa can turn his blood into arm blades. The biggest part of the plot was some of the prisoner's ability to manipulate their blood and I found it to be pretty cool.With that said, yes, this is a bloody and gory anime, though I can't say it's that bad. Elfen Lied is a lot worse in the gore department, though there are some cringe-worthy scenes scattered throughout Deadman Wonderland, especially at the beginning and toward the end. Personally, there was only one moment where I was kind of yucked out, and this involved an eye being ripped out of a head, but otherwise it seemed fairly tame, at least for something that touts itself as bloody and gory.The series starts off strong and the story is really cool and the use of this carnival as a device for killing prisoners is both smart and entertaining, but after a second Carnival of Corpses fight, the series seems to taper off and it never uses the setting for anything exciting. The second half of the series never includes a portion such as a game or a Carnival of Corpses, it's just this resistance attempting to escape. In a longer series, this may not have bothered me if the next story arc pertained to another obstacle game or something of the like, but in a twelve episode series, it is disappointing. And to add to that disappointment is the fact that the series does not have a conclusion. It ends one story arc, starts up another, but leaves it hanging. While I understand that twelve episode seasons are the norm for anime, I just wish that decent series would wrap up at least a little more soundly, or even forgo following the source material and try for something different. Elfen Lied strayed from the source material and it worked. I think it could have worked here too.So the plot starts amazing, and flatlines toward the end with the same generic action and boring scenery I can get out of a long running Shonen title.The animation is good, not great. The middle school kids looked weird. I mean, Ganta isn't that great looking either, but I couldn't get over how freaking scary Mimi looked. Backgrounds are...blah. The scenery during the first act and the games and fights is pretty cool, but the end of the series follows the characters through dull gray areas and bright white areas and boring brown areas. It's all very unappealing.The sound is pretty good. I really, really liked the opening. Not only was it a bad*** opening that really got you pumped for the anime (and fit the first act's adrenaline pumping action much better than the second act's dullness), the song was done by Japanese band Fade in English and it makes sense! For those who may not know, Japanese songs tend to intermix some English in the lyrics and it typically makes no sense whatsoever with lines like ""Oh my God is Jesus Christ!"" being sung. This song is perfect English and is also pretty catchy. I sat through the opening every episode because of it and the cool sequence. The ending is meh and doesn't seem to fit the grittiness of the show that much. It's like an upbeat pop song or something. Music during the show is fitting.In the character department we have some flaws. As stated, Ganta Igarashi is not a fun character to watch. At first I liked him and felt sympathetic toward the fact that he was framed for a crime he didn't commit. But later on you grow to just get sick of his constant crying and wimpyiness. Even the other characters get sick of his being a total loser. He constantly screws up and is constantly talking about saving the bad guys and helping them escape and protecting his friends. He's the classic teenage wuss found in anime such as Guilty Crown, and most notably, Neon Genesis Evangelion. How a kid who whines and cries as much as he does survives a prison as hardcore as Deadman Wonderland is a mystery. I guess it's something about friendship. But I don't care because I didn't watch this to learn life lessons. I watched this to see murder.Shiro is cool. And not because she's almost naked. She's cool because I know nothing about her, the series doesn't explain much about her and who or what she is, and she seems to be pretty smart because she calls Ganta a wuss. She's kind of silly, kind of sweet, but also the only character who seems to have any sort of depth. Now, I could be wrong, but I felt like if the anime did continue she would be the character with the most depth.Other notables are Minatsuki Takami, a teenage girl who acts all cute and adorable and turns out to be a crazy-freaking killer. I knew she wasn't all flowers and smiles, but holy cow did I not see how totally insane she would turn out to be. I loved her.Nagi Kengamine is another pretty decent character. He has a bit of backstory and seems real calm under pressure. He was enjoyable to watch and I wish there were more scenes with him. Senji Kiyomasa is another cool character with very little backstory, but he's a total bad***.Toto Sakagami shows up about two thirds of the way through Deadman, but he never gets much screen time and the time he does get makes me want to see more of him. Who is he, what is he? These things are never explained and apparently left to a second season.And that's where I shall start my conclusion: There will be no second season. Sales of the DVD and Blu-Ray were horrible in Japan, meaning this is another anime that just leaves off and is going to be the target of terrible fan fictions for years to come in an attempt to conclude it. Actually, the manga does continue the story and I believe I'll be heading over there to see if it's worth my time.Otherwise, Deadman Wonderland is probably a 9 for the first act. But the second act is a 6. Which really sucks because I wanted to love this anime and be a raging fanboy about it, but I can't because of it's many shortcomings. The plot, Ganta, some of the side characters being dull, the animation being dull and lifeless toward the end: they all detract from the experience.Enjoyable, though flawed, Deadman Wonderland is a 7/10.",4,"An Awesome First Act, A Boring Second",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,7411,"['When', 'was', 'recommended', 'Deadman', 'Wonderland', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'watching',

Now moving on to the English Dub itself I found it to be a rather average dub that never really reached the level of quality that I was hoping to see. Funimation for some reason or another decided to fill the dub with some of the most absurd profanity that I've ever seen in an English Dub granted some of it at first can be amusing but it overstays its welcome very quickly. The English dialogue can range from being somewhat intelligent to trying way to hard to sound hip and modern constantly using internet lingo like ""noob"" or ""uber""(those words are far to moronic). Patrick Seitz's Crow was excellent easily the best character in the show and the most impressive vocal performance from the English Dub. Eric Vale's Tsunenaga Tamaki was fairly solid & Colleen Clinkenbeard's Makina was solid as well. Greg Ayres and Monica Rial were pretty average in there roles but gave respectable performances. I liked Ryan Reynolds II as the Mockingbird and new comer Lee Murphy was very memorable in episode two as Kouzuji.Aaron Dismuke,Leah Clark, Dave Trosko ,R Bruce Elliott and others were pretty solid.A majority of the characters in the cast are underdeveloped making it rather difficult to care what ultimately happens to them and the villains of the series The Undertakers were paper thin and weren't to interesting your typical one dimensional type of villain. I found the ending to be quite lackluster it would of most likely been vastly better if it had another dozen episodes to build its characters and world more but at the moment the chances of a second season aren't on the horizon.
