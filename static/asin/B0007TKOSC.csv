890630,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0007TKOSC,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 4]","In a lifetime of leftist political work I have run into precious few professors or other intellectual workers who have been committed to a long term radical perspective on American society, much less a call for radical change. The subject of this documentary, Boston University's Professor Emeritus Howard Zinn,  is an exception. Although there has been for a long time a vast political gulf between the good professor and this reviewer in terms of how we see the organization of political change occurring we both share fundamentally the same radical critique of American imperialism.This short documentary flushes out Professor Zinn's early New York City working class upbringing, his military service as a pilot in World War II and his later reflections on his part in that experience that began to lead him to a more radical perspective. The film also details his political perspectives over a lifetime of activism beginning with the early civil rights movement down in the South, where he taught at historically black Spelman College, in the 1950's and early 1960's, centrally around the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, which he wrote an important and informative book about). Much time is spent on Zinn's very visible role as an active oppositional voice in the central experience of my generation, Vietnam. Then, fast forward, onto the struggles in Central America in the 1980's in defense of the Sandinistas and others and then to the most recent fight against the war in Iraq started by President Bush and his coterie in 2003 and that continues to this day.Just listing the fights Zinn has participated in tells something about our society as well as about the tenacity of the professor. Additionally, Zinn's highly literate historical works are considered here, especially the very useful People's History of The United States (which deserves a separate review of its own that I will do in the future in this space) that is a bible of sorts for identifying a progressive alternative interpretation of the development of American capitalist society and is something of his crowning glory.Howard Zinn is clearly the star of this documentary, as he should be (with cameos by wife and companion Roz, and other academic leftists such a as Francis Fox Piven and Staughton Lynd). However, I got the distinct feeling while viewing this film that he was presented as something of an old radical gadfly spurring everyone on to ""keep up the good fight"". And that is fine, as we certainly need those radical academic voices to spur on the youth. I also note that Zinn's influence seems to be far greater on my generation than on latter ones. That is hardly his fault. Each generation needs to come to a progressive social perspective in its own way. As a son of the very poorest layer of the working class from the generation after his I could relate to his upbringing but that compelling life story, as the current usage goes, might not be so to the Obama generation.What is brother Zinn's ""fault"" is, however, except for that very strong sense of personal witness on his part against the injustices of the world is that he has no idea about how one would effectively organize the resistance to the American state. That in the final analysis was the weakness of one of his heroines, the fiery anarchist Emma Goldman, and it is his as well. One hardly needs to be a Leninist, although that might help, to know that moral suasion is not enough to go up against the monsters that run this society. And win.We can fight that question out at another time. But here let me go back to that first sentence of the last paragraph about the strong sense of social justice and the need to bare the inequities of this society. For that, Professor Zinn, all honor to you.",4,An Elder Radical Statesman,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,3774,"['lifetime', 'leftist', 'political', 'work', 'have', 'run', 'precious', 'few', 'professors', 'other', 'intellectual', 'workers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'committed', 'long', 'term', 'radical', 'perspective', 'American', 'society', 'much', 'less', 'call', 'radical', 'change', 'subject', 'documentary', 'Boston', 'University', 'Professor', 'Emeritus', 'Howard', 'Zinn', 'exception', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'vast', 'political', 'gulf', 'good', 'professor', 'reviewer', 'terms', 'how', 'see', 'organization', 'political', 'change', 'occurring', 'share', 'fundamentally', 'same', 'radical', 'critique', 'American', 'imperialism.This', 'short', 'documentary', 'flushes', 'out', 'Professor', 'Zinn', 'early', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'working', 'class', 'upbringing', 'military', 'service', 'pilot', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'later', 'reflections', 'part', 'experience', 'began', 'lead', 'more', 'radical', 'perspective', 'film', 'also', 'details', 'political', 'perspectives', 'lifetime', 'activism', 'beginning', 'early', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'down', 'South', 'where', 'taught', 'historically', 'black', 'Spelman', 'College', '1950', 'early', '1960', 'centrally', 'Student', 'Non-Violent', 'Coordinating', 'Committee', 'SNCC', 'wrote', 'important', 'informative', 'book', 'Much', 'time', 'spent', 'Zinn', 'very', 'visible', 'role', 'active', 'oppositional', 'voice', 'central', 'experience', 'generation', 'Vietnam', 'Then', 'fast', 'forward', 'struggles', 'Central', 'America', '1980', 'defense', 'Sandinistas', 'others', 'then', 'most', 'recent', 'fight', 'war', 'Iraq', 'started', 'President', 'Bush', 'coterie', '2003', 'day.Just', 'listing', 'fights', 'Zinn', 'participated', 'tells', 'something', 'society', 'as', 'well', 'tenacity', 'professor', 'Additionally', 'Zinn', 'highly', 'literate', 'historical', 'works', 'are', 'considered', 'here', 'especially', 'very', 'useful', 'People', 'History', 'United', 'States', 'separate', 'review', 'own', 'will', 'do', 'future', 'space', 'bible', 'sorts', 'identifying', 'progressive', 'alternative', 'interpretation', 'development', 'American', 'capitalist', 'society', 'something', 'crowning', 'glory.Howard', 'Zinn', 'clearly', 'star', 'documentary', 'should', 'be', 'cameos', 'wife', 'companion', 'Roz', 'other', 'academic', 'leftists', 'such', 'Francis', 'Fox', 'Piven', 'Staughton', 'Lynd', 'However', 'got', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'presented', 'something', 'old', 'radical', 'gadfly', 'spurring', 'everyone', 'keep', 'good', 'fight', 'fine', 'certainly', 'need', 'radical', 'academic', 'voices', 'spur', 'youth', 'also', 'note', 'Zinn', 'influence', 'be', 'far', 'greater', 'generation', 'latter', 'ones', 'hardly', 'fault', 'generation', 'come', 'progressive', 'social', 'perspective', 'own', 'way', 'son', 'very', 'poorest', 'layer', 'working', 'class', 'generation', 'could', 'relate', 'upbringing', 'compelling', 'life', 'story', 'current', 'usage', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'Obama', 'generation.What', 'Zinn', 'fault', 'however', 'very', 'strong', 'sense', 'personal', 'witness', 'part', 'injustices', 'world', 'idea', 'how', 'one', 'would', 'effectively', 'organize', 'resistance', 'American', 'state', 'final', 'analysis', 'was', 'weakness', 'one', 'heroines', 'fiery', 'anarchist', 'Emma', 'Goldman', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'hardly', 'be', 'Leninist', 'might', 'help', 'know', 'moral', 'suasion', 'not', 'enough', 'go', 'up', 'monsters', 'run', 'society', 'win.We', 'can', 'fight', 'question', 'out', 'time', 'here', 'let', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'sentence', 'last', 'paragraph', 'strong', 'sense', 'social', 'justice', 'need', 'bare', 'inequities', 'society', 'Professor', 'Zinn', 'honor']",N/A
890631,A34PAZQ73SL163,B0007TKOSC,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[5, 31]","Few leftist icons are looked upon more favorably than professor and activist Howard Zinn. Like many radical ideologues, he is the darling of students, the professorate, and the glitterati. Indeed, Hollywood star Matt Damon provided the narration for a hagiographic documentary about his life entitled, Howard Zinn -You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train.""You can't be neutral"" is a reference to Zinn's belief that all history is skewed by the mind that conveys it, and that the best historians must be ""engaged"" in political and societal matters. Therefore, it is non-remarkable when their discussion of events always manages to be harmonious with their worldview. Such a post-modernist outlook is quite popular today, but prevalence is not always an indication of value. Zinn informs viewers that no work is ever completely objective, which then allows him (and other activists) to avoid using research and citations which do not substantiate their pre-determined suppositions.That no historical account is ever 100 percent objective cannot be doubted, but an automaton's level of clinical impartiality is neither possible nor expected. One commits a black-or-white fallacy by pretending that it is as nothing can ever be 100 percent objective or subjective. Good history doggedly attempts to be unbiased. When it abandons its detachment, any amount of distortion becomes acceptable; history gets alchemized into propaganda. Zinn minimizes his own lack of scholarship in The Peoples' History of the United States by claiming that it was not written with an academic audience in mind.As a man, Zinn appears to be more celebrity than egghead. He isn't one to quibble over the nature of secondary or primary source materials, he'd rather illustrate his points by quoting lyrics from a Woody Guthrie song. No doubt that the directors of this film ascribe to their subject's view of fairness as not one of the individuals interviewed uttered a single negative syllable about Zinn. Uniformly leftist luminaries like Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Marian Wright Edelman, Daniel Ellsberg, and Tom Hayden spent their segments exalting the importance of his impact upon society.Their depiction of Zinn's personality was most revealing and in keeping with the tendencies of leftists in general. According to his friends and associates, he possesses a ""steely anger,"" and ""an endless capacity for moral outrage"" which is representative of the whole. Dr. John Ray's key psychological components of the leftist are discernible in Zinn as his need for fame, praise, power, and attention are quite pronounced.At one point, Zinn's perceptions appear utterly astonishing. As a Jew in the Air Force who was sent to fight the Nazis during World War II, he found himself in a position of, what should have been, absolute moral clarity. If ever a person was placed into a position where war was morally just, this was it. However, his reminiscences are confined to indignation over his unit's bombing an enclave of German soldiers. He lamented the action as the men in the French village, ""weren't doing anything to anybody""--except defending the boundaries of a genocide state.Perhaps the best way to sum up Howard Zinn is through words he applied to Uncle Sam: ""limited, opinionated and with special interests.""",1,Fabricating History,1149033600,"05 31, 2006",2006,3289,"['Few', 'leftist', 'icons', 'are', 'looked', 'more', 'favorably', 'professor', 'activist', 'Howard', 'Zinn', 'many', 'radical', 'ideologues', 'darling', 'students', 'professorate', 'glitterati', 'Indeed', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'provided', 'narration', 'hagiographic', 'documentary', 'life', 'entitled', 'Howard', 'Zinn', '-You', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Neutral', 'Moving', 'Train', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'neutral', 'reference', 'Zinn', 'belief', 'history', 'skewed', 'mind', 'best', 'historians', 'must', 'be', 'engaged', 'political', 'societal', 'matters', 'Therefore', 'non-remarkable', 'when', 'discussion', 'events', 'always', 'be', 'harmonious', 'worldview', 'post-modernist', 'outlook', 'quite', 'popular', 'today', 'prevalence', 'not', 'always', 'indication', 'value', 'Zinn', 'viewers', 'work', 'ever', 'completely', 'objective', 'then', 'other', 'activists', 'avoid', 'using', 'research', 'citations', 'do', 'not', 'substantiate', 'pre-determined', 'historical', 'account', 'ever', '100', 'percent', 'objective', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'doubted', 'automaton', 'level', 'clinical', 'impartiality', 'possible', 'expected', 'One', 'black-or-white', 'fallacy', 'pretending', 'nothing', 'can', 'ever', 'be', '100', 'percent', 'objective', 'subjective', 'Good', 'history', 'doggedly', 'be', 'unbiased', 'When', 'detachment', 'amount', 'distortion', 'becomes', 'acceptable', 'history', 'alchemized', 'propaganda', 'Zinn', 'own', 'lack', 'scholarship', 'Peoples', 'History', 'United', 'States', 'claiming', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'academic', 'audience', 'mind.As', 'man', 'Zinn', 'be', 'more', 'celebrity', 'egghead', ""n't"", 'one', 'quibble', 'nature', 'secondary', 'primary', 'source', 'materials', ""'d"", 'rather', 'illustrate', 'points', 'quoting', 'lyrics', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'song', 'No', 'doubt', 'directors', 'film', 'ascribe', 'subject', 'view', 'fairness', 'not', 'one', 'individuals', 'interviewed', 'uttered', 'single', 'negative', 'syllable', 'Zinn', 'Uniformly', 'leftist', 'luminaries', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'Alice', 'Walker', 'Marian', 'Wright', 'Edelman', 'Daniel', 'Ellsberg', 'Tom', 'Hayden', 'spent', 'segments', 'exalting', 'importance', 'impact', 'society.Their', 'depiction', 'Zinn', 'personality', 'was', 'most', 'revealing', 'keeping', 'tendencies', 'leftists', 'general', 'According', 'friends', 'associates', 'steely', 'anger', 'endless', 'capacity', 'moral', 'outrage', 'representative', 'whole', 'Dr.', 'John', 'Ray', 'key', 'psychological', 'components', 'leftist', 'are', 'discernible', 'Zinn', 'need', 'fame', 'praise', 'power', 'attention', 'are', 'quite', 'pronounced.At', 'one', 'point', 'Zinn', 'perceptions', 'appear', 'utterly', 'astonishing', 'Jew', 'Air', 'Force', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'fight', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'found', 'position', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'absolute', 'moral', 'clarity', 'ever', 'person', 'was', 'placed', 'position', 'where', 'war', 'was', 'morally', 'just', 'was', 'However', 'reminiscences', 'are', 'confined', 'indignation', 'unit', 'bombing', 'enclave', 'German', 'soldiers', 'lamented', 'action', 'men', 'French', 'village', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'anything', 'anybody', 'defending', 'boundaries', 'genocide', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'Howard', 'Zinn', 'words', 'applied', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'limited', 'opinionated', 'special', 'interests']",N/A

I started reading it, and I didn't want to put it down.  The only reason I did was because I had to plug in my device.  That book is a page turner.  Had history been presented this way when I took it, I wonder if I would have fallen in love with the discipline a long time ago.  The history classes that I took was so dry and we had to memorize dates.  Where's the joy in that?Besides loving Zinn's take on history that Columbus partook in genocide (which gets brushed aside in favor for his adventurous spirit to the New World, which wasn't new at all) I love that Zinn presents history like a research paper.  He includes other authors' books and insights.A few days ago I ordered a ton of books and media from my local library to write a research paper on Iraq, and this DVD was in my find when I picked my booty up today.  I wanted to take a break from reading, so I popped this in.  He was a very dynamic man.  I was sad to see he died in 2010 (on Wikipedia).  I love that he taught at Spelman.  That seems so just, and yet oxymoronic at the same time.One of my favorite vignettes is the recounting of when he's in court where the people desegregated themselves.  He sat on the &#34;black side&#34;.  The judge ordered them to segregate themselves and no one moved.  The bailiff was looking at Zinn and was most likely going to strike him, but Zinn asks to speak and the judge grants him his wish.  Zinn basically says, &#34;'the Supreme Court deemed it illegal to segregate in a court in the US, would you mind following the law of the Supreme Court?&#34;  You have to love someone with that much cojones (or more appropriately chutzpah since he was Jewish).I would have loved to have taken one of his classes, it's so sad that he's gone, but I'm glad he left a legacy of books behind.

890634,A2Y8NGYAE9RHQ5,B0007TKOSC,Joseph P. Weber,"[63, 72]","As an undergraduate at Boston University in the 1980's I had the advantage to take two of Dr. Howard Zinn's courses.  Unfortunately, as a somewhat naive student from a conservative midwestern upbringing I did not take full advantage or fully appreciate the opportunity of studying under Dr. Zinn.  Today, I was quite pleased to see a documentary about this amazing, yet contravesial man.Whether or not you agree with Dr. Zinn's politics, it cannot be denied (especially after watching this documentary) that his motives are genuine.  Dr. Zinn is really fighting for a better and truer form of what he defines as justice.  It may be easy to disagree with him (I certainly do not agree with all his ideas or actions), this documentary makes it impossible to disagree that he is a man who really cares about what he is fighting for.The documentary begins with his meager upbringing and discusses that although as a shipbuilder he could have received a deferment from fighting in World War II, he enlisted believing that fighting facism in Europe was the right thing to do.  However, some of the things he was called upon to do as a pilot forced him to ponder on what means can and should be used to achieve a just end.  The documentary then depicts the start of his activism as a white teacher in a black college in Atlanta during the early days of the racial movement in the South.  The documentary covers his life from those early days throughout his career.Although the documentary is not what you could call balanced in that none of Dr. Zinn's opponents are interviewed, I do not find that as a fault.  I do not think the purpose of this  documentary was to be a completely balanced protrayal leaving it up to the viewer to make his or her own decision about Dr. Zinn; but instead the documentary is meant to be a heartfelt synopsis of a fascinating man.From a filmaker's point of view, the documentary ceratainly works as well.  It is well edited with loads of great old footage intertwined with the interviews.  All-in-all, this is a documentary that works.

890635,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B0007TKOSC,Kerry Walters,"[2, 4]","Patriotism, it seems to me, isn't a my-country-right-or-wrong sort of attitude.  Instead, patriotism is a yearning for one's nation to live up to ideals of liberty, equality, and justice.  This means that a patriot will both work hard to make sure that the ideals become reality and have the courage to speak truth to power when the ideals get sidetracked.By this definition, Howard Zinn is one of this country's foremost patriots, and ""You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train,"" part biography and part commentary, gives a good idea why.  Growing up in a blue collar family, serving in World War II (where, he later discovered, he dropped some of the first napalm ever used in war), converted to pacifism by his war experiences, teaching at Spielman College, active in the civil rights movement (and fired from Spelman for his efforts), moving to Boston University, getting involved in the anti-war movement, writing his classic A People's History of the United States, and continuing today, in his mid-80s, to lecture and write and teach:  these are some of the moments in his life covered in the film.One of the more interesting themes throughout the film--one captured by the title--is Zinn's contention that historians are never neutral, despite their occasional claims of scholarly objectivity.  One of the tasks of an historian is to help contemporaries see and learn from the dark spots of history--the often neglected resistance of ""ordinary"" people to the world's movers and shakers.  In recording and passing on the underbelly of history, as it were, the historian can inspire as well as educate.What comes through clearly is that Zinn is not only a remarkably smart and dedicated man.  He's also a man of humor, compassion, and humility, as one suspects anyone who has achieved what he has must be.The film is a loose adaptation of Zinn's autobiography of the same title.

Those reviews provide an excellent overview of the film and of Zinn's life.I rented this DVD because Zinn died this week and though I'd heard of him, I had never read any of his books.  If you have read much history you've likely heard the statement that it is written by the victors.  Zinn wanted to present to Americans (via teaching college history and his book ""A People's History of the United States"") another view, one without the jingoism so prevalent in the books about history he himself had studied as a graduate student.Zinn also felt morally compelled to support (via attendance, organizing, and speaking at) demonstrations for civil rights for African Americans and against the Vietnam war.  Having been a bombardier in WWII and having travelled to Vietnam to assist in the release of several prisoners of war, he was well qualified to talk about war.This movie presents some of the critical American historical events of the 20th Century through Zinn's eyes, which is the best way to chronicle his life.In this film there is video of a speech Zinn gave in which he said the following, and I backed up the DVD to be sure that I typed it correctly:  ""People who seem to have no power, once they organize and protest and create national movements have a power that no government can repress.""",5,A Historican With a Different Perspective,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1378,"['FIRST', 'please', 'read', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Robin', 'Wolfson', 'Joseph', 'Weber', 'reviews', 'provide', 'excellent', 'overview', 'film', 'Zinn', 'life.I', 'rented', 'DVD', 'Zinn', 'died', 'week', ""'d"", 'heard', 'had', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'read', 'much', 'history', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'heard', 'statement', 'written', 'victors', 'Zinn', 'wanted', 'present', 'Americans', 'teaching', 'college', 'history', 'book', 'A', 'People', 'History', 'United', 'States', 'view', 'one', 'jingoism', 'so', 'prevalent', 'books', 'history', 'had', 'studied', 'graduate', 'student.Zinn', 'also', 'felt', 'morally', 'compelled', 'support', 'attendance', 'organizing', 'speaking', 'demonstrations', 'civil', 'rights', 'African', 'Americans', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'Having', 'been', 'bombardier', 'WWII', 'having', 'travelled', 'Vietnam', 'assist', 'release', 'several', 'prisoners', 'war', 'was', 'well', 'qualified', 'talk', 'war.This', 'movie', 'critical', 'American', 'historical', 'events', '20th', 'Century', 'Zinn', 'eyes', 'best', 'way', 'chronicle', 'life.In', 'film', 'video', 'speech', 'Zinn', 'gave', 'said', 'following', 'backed', 'up', 'DVD', 'be', 'sure', 'typed', 'correctly', 'People', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'power', 'once', 'organize', 'protest', 'create', 'national', 'movements', 'have', 'power', 'government', 'can', 'repress']",N/A

Bernard Chapin's negative review was no exception.  Chapin holds a world view that our militarists are constantly pushing in an attempt to rationalize their aggression; that is, ""foul acts like murder, slavery, and wanton destruction are ubiquitous to humanity, and were committed by people all over the world since the beginning of time"" (to quote Chapin's review of Pat Buchanan's ""State of Emergency"").  There is usually an element of truth to effective propaganda and, no doubt, the Nazis, Genghis Khan, Stalin, child abusers, rapists and others have resorted to similar rationalizations for their own ""foul acts.""  Zinn, on the other hand,resists the perception management efforts that make war easy.  Instead, he's been a tireless advocate for the causes of peace and justice.  He's been at the war protests, stood in the picket lines, lectured/written tirelessly, and he's supported groups like ""Emergency"" that sends doctors into war zones to try to stitch together the bodies torn apart by the ""wanton destruction"" of Western so-called Civilization.Zinn himself has directly participated in that destruction.  As a World War II bombadeer, he was part of a raid that pioneered the use of napalm.  It was an act for which many would have sought some psychologically comforting justification.  Zinn instead chose to be honest about the inexcusable barbarity of burning civilians alive, and dedicated himself to resisting the efforts of our warlords.  One of his many insights that undercut the narratives of our military establishment is this bit of good news that appears towards the end of the film, Zinn is quoted as saying, ""To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic.  It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness . . . And if we do act, in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand utopian future.  The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.""It's this reminder, that wanton kindness is just as much a part of our nature as anything else, that is the most subversive message of Zinn's work.  It also is the teaching of the Dalai Lama, our mothers, and other people very much worth listening to.",5,A revolution in kindness.,1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,2463,"['Sometimes', 'find', 'thoughts', 'Zinn', 'detractors', 'be', 'least', 'as', 'interesting', 'admirers', 'Bernard', 'Chapin', 'negative', 'review', 'was', 'exception', 'Chapin', 'world', 'view', 'militarists', 'are', 'constantly', 'pushing', 'attempt', 'rationalize', 'aggression', 'foul', 'acts', 'murder', 'slavery', 'wanton', 'destruction', 'are', 'ubiquitous', 'humanity', 'were', 'committed', 'people', 'world', 'beginning', 'time', 'quote', 'Chapin', 'review', 'Pat', 'Buchanan', 'State', 'Emergency', 'usually', 'element', 'truth', 'effective', 'propaganda', 'doubt', 'Nazis', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'Stalin', 'child', 'abusers', 'rapists', 'others', 'have', 'resorted', 'similar', 'rationalizations', 'own', 'foul', 'acts', 'Zinn', 'other', 'hand', 'perception', 'management', 'efforts', 'make', 'war', 'easy', 'Instead', 'been', 'tireless', 'advocate', 'causes', 'peace', 'justice', 'been', 'war', 'protests', 'stood', 'picket', 'lines', 'lectured/written', 'tirelessly', 'supported', 'groups', 'Emergency', 'doctors', 'war', 'zones', 'try', 'stitch', 'together', 'bodies', 'torn', 'apart', 'wanton', 'destruction', 'Western', 'so-called', 'Civilization.Zinn', 'directly', 'participated', 'destruction', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'bombadeer', 'was', 'part', 'raid', 'pioneered', 'use', 'napalm', 'was', 'act', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'sought', 'psychologically', 'comforting', 'justification', 'Zinn', 'instead', 'chose', 'be', 'honest', 'inexcusable', 'barbarity', 'burning', 'civilians', 'alive', 'dedicated', 'resisting', 'efforts', 'warlords', 'One', 'many', 'insights', 'undercut', 'narratives', 'military', 'establishment', 'bit', 'good', 'news', 'end', 'film', 'Zinn', 'quoted', 'saying', 'be', 'hopeful', 'bad', 'times', 'not', 'just', 'foolishly', 'romantic', 'based', 'fact', 'human', 'history', 'history', 'not', 'only', 'cruelty', 'also', 'compassion', 'sacrifice', 'courage', 'kindness', 'do', 'act', 'however', 'small', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', 'grand', 'utopian', 'future', 'future', 'infinite', 'succession', 'presents', 'live', 'now', 'think', 'human', 'beings', 'should', 'live', 'defiance', 'bad', 'marvelous', 'victory', 'reminder', 'wanton', 'kindness', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'nature', 'anything', 'else', 'most', 'subversive', 'message', 'Zinn', 'work', 'also', 'teaching', 'Dalai', 'Lama', 'mothers', 'other', 'people', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'listening']",N/A

890641,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0007TKOSC,William Hare,"[10, 13]","Howard Zinn was the ideal candidate to write ""A People's History of the United States"".  A brilliant but plainspoken populist, Zinn came from working class roots and has been the same kind of populist intellectual as the late Nobel Prize author John Steinbeck.In the fascinating documentary ""Howard Zinn:  You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train"" narrated by Matt Damon, the eastern populist's life is chronicled with the focus on his efforts to achieve peace.  He was part of a journey to North Vietnam during the peak of fighting and returned with important information that could have aided the peace effort to end the Vietnam War.  Zinn and his colleagues sought a meeting with President Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House.  Had his effort not been spurned the opportunity would have been present to explore a peace settlement and save many lives to be lost in future skirmishes.An important distinction can be drawn between Zinn and his current critics who proposed waging war in Iraq.  Whereas Zinn's critics consist of individuals who successfully used influence to avoid military duty in Vietnam, Zinn fought with distinction in World War Two as a fighter pilot.  One of the most heart-wrenching segments of this documentary arises when he speaks with sadness about having lost one of his best friends during that conflict.The most important quote arising from a documentary filled with such gems arises when Zinn confronts the subject of war.  He states, ""If going to war is so popular then why is it that it's necessary to have a draft?""Another important battle in which Zinn fought tenaciously was the civil rights movement.  Refusing to back down he was dismissed from one university when he continued to support sit in demonstrations.  When the cause is worth fighting for Zinn is there in spite of the consequences.  His students rallied to his defense when the strident John Silber became president of Boston University and sought to have the popular instructor removed because of his populist and anti-war views.  Once again Zinn never backed down and retained his position.Zinn has currently joined the battle pertaining to outsourcing.  He speaks out articulately, making a case for the American worker in the face of continuing efforts on the part of major corporations seeking to enhance their profit margins by relocating to Third World countries.Some sit on the sidelines and advocate war.
