Travis,"[15, 16]","I must say, for all the complaining I have read about this set lacking in features and satisfaction, I must disagree- I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As a true fan of the series since it debuted in 1998, I have waited long and high for a DVD package that would be worth the price, and this one fits the bill. I'll go over in bullet points just why you'll love it as much as I do:PACKAGINGIn a lavish and lush layout, the creators really took the time to make this box set a true centerpiece for any coffee table. Like the 2006 pink set, the 2010 version is pure white, with a montage of New York City that, if looked at more precisely, is a trickle of memorable quotes from the show. Open it up, and you're treated to a chapter like book that encases each season in DVDs and gorgeous photos of the four women. There has been some grumbling about the difficulty of removing the DVDs from their slips because of the hard cardboard, but with a sturdy tug I got mine out with no problem at all- and it's nice they are inserted like this, because it keeps them snuggly in place. Each page in the Disc booklet is carefully crafted and beautiful to look at.You get all 94 episodes from the series plus the two feature films. The added inclusion of the movies is a nice touch, even if you hated them (like I did the second).FEATURESI also read someone's review whining that there were no commentaries for Season 4- this person must have eye problems, because the commentaries are clearly on there. Season 3, 4, 5 & 6 all come with commentaries. If you bought the DVDs individually before, they are the same ones from Michael Patrick King- but it's nice to have them here none the less. Of all the commentaries King carefully implements and reflects about, it's funny that he failed to give one for ""The Real Me"", the season 4 classic that involves Carrie falling in a fashion show, and that earned King an Emmy for Outstanding Directing at the 2002 Emmy Awards.There are also Deleted Scenes (though only a few) from all six seasons, that are all on the final disc for Season 6, part II. As well as documentaries, Round Table Discussions from the writers (new for the 2010 version), and Alternate Endings for the series finale.PICTURE & AUDIO QUALITYOf all the things the producers could have done, boosting the quality for the DVDs would have been a nice touch. They're watchable, no doubt, but especially if you watch them on higher end screens- you will notice the slight graininess from the earlier seasons and sometimes it is like watching old VHS tapes. Especially for a newer Deluxe Edition, this couldn't have been that difficult to do.The audio was just fine- the music and voice-overs balanced perfectly.For anyone who is a true fan of the series, this is the one to get. And all the DVDs worked fine- no glitches or skips. A true joy to own.",5,An EXCELLENT Edition for the Fans!,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,2851,"['must', 'say', 'complaining', 'have', 'read', 'set', 'lacking', 'features', 'satisfaction', 'must', 'disagree-', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier', 'purchase', 'true', 'fan', 'series', 'debuted', '1998', 'have', 'waited', 'long', 'high', 'DVD', 'package', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'one', 'bill', ""'ll"", 'go', 'over', 'bullet', 'points', 'just', 'why', ""'ll"", 'love', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'PACKAGINGIn', 'lavish', 'lush', 'layout', 'creators', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'make', 'box', 'set', 'true', 'centerpiece', 'coffee', 'table', '2006', 'pink', 'set', '2010', 'version', 'pure', 'white', 'montage', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'looked', 'more', 'precisely', 'trickle', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'show', 'Open', 'up', ""'re"", 'treated', 'chapter', 'book', 'season', 'DVDs', 'gorgeous', 'photos', 'four', 'women', 'been', 'grumbling', 'difficulty', 'removing', 'DVDs', 'slips', 'hard', 'cardboard', 'sturdy', 'tug', 'got', 'out', 'problem', 'all-', 'nice', 'are', 'inserted', 'snuggly', 'place', 'page', 'Disc', 'booklet', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'beautiful', 'look', 'at.You', 'get', '94', 'episodes', 'series', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'added', 'inclusion', 'movies', 'nice', 'touch', 'even', 'hated', 'did', 'second', '.FEATURESI', 'also', 'read', 'someone', 'review', 'whining', 'were', 'commentaries', 'Season', '4-', 'person', 'must', 'have', 'eye', 'problems', 'commentaries', 'are', 'clearly', 'there', 'Season', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'come', 'commentaries', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'individually', 'before', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'Michael', 'Patrick', 'King-', 'nice', 'have', 'here', 'none', 'less', 'commentaries', 'King', 'carefully', 'implements', 'about', 'funny', 'failed', 'give', 'one', 'Real', 'Me', 'season', '4', 'classic', 'Carrie', 'falling', 'fashion', 'show', 'earned', 'King', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Directing', '2002', 'Emmy', 'Awards.There', 'are', 'also', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'only', 'few', 'six', 'seasons', 'are', 'final', 'disc', 'Season', '6', 'part', 'II', 'As', 'well', 'documentaries', 'Round', 'Table', 'Discussions', 'writers', 'new', '2010', 'version', 'Alternate', 'Endings', 'series', 'finale.PICTURE', 'AUDIO', 'QUALITYOf', 'things', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'boosting', 'quality', 'DVDs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'touch', ""'re"", 'watchable', 'doubt', 'especially', 'watch', 'higher', 'end', 'screens-', 'will', 'notice', 'slight', 'graininess', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'sometimes', 'watching', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Especially', 'newer', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'do.The', 'audio', 'was', 'just', 'fine-', 'music', 'voice-overs', 'balanced', 'anyone', 'who', 'true', 'fan', 'series', 'one', 'get', 'DVDs', 'worked', 'fine-', 'glitches', 'skips', 'true', 'joy', 'own']",N/A

Here you get the entire series in its entirety, everything from the series' episodes (all 94 shows) to the two feature-length films, plus a great bonus DVD that contain an array of extras that you will enjoy over and over.Very few cable shows have ever experienced the kind of success that ""Sex and the City"" had. Viewers were entranced every week as Carrie and her three best friends, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda, led very busy lives in New York City. All four ladies had great jobs and active sex lives, something the women were not ashamed of. These characters epitomized what life was like for single women in America in the late '90's and early 2000's, and what made the show so appealing was the fact that these women loved each other and were always there for one another. Their family was a ""family of choice"" and no one could break that bond.In 2008 ""Sex and the City"" hit the big screen for the first time in ""Sex and the City-The Movie"" where it became an instant boxoffice smash. It was no surprise that there was an immediate sequel called ""Sex and the City 2"", but unfortunately due to a mediocre script and the girls not being situated in New York, the film was a commercial flop. Still, it's nice to see both films offered in this new box-set that collector's will enjoy for posterity.The bonuses that accompany this set includes interviews with the cast, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, ""next-episode"" previews, and more. The subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish and the episodes are presented in the original full-screen format, the way they were orignally broadcast.",5,"""An Amazing Box-Set!""",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1678,"['fan', 'Sex', 'City', 'ultimate', 'collector', 'item', 'Here', 'get', 'entire', 'series', 'entirety', 'everything', 'series', 'episodes', '94', 'shows', 'two', 'feature-length', 'films', 'great', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'contain', 'array', 'extras', 'will', 'enjoy', 'over.Very', 'few', 'cable', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'experienced', 'kind', 'success', 'Sex', 'City', 'had', 'Viewers', 'were', 'entranced', 'week', 'Carrie', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'Samantha', 'Charlotte', 'Miranda', 'led', 'very', 'busy', 'lives', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'four', 'ladies', 'had', 'great', 'jobs', 'active', 'sex', 'lives', 'something', 'women', 'were', 'not', 'ashamed', 'characters', 'epitomized', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'single', 'women', 'America', 'late', ""'90"", 'early', '2000', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'appealing', 'was', 'fact', 'women', 'loved', 'other', 'were', 'always', 'there', 'one', 'family', 'was', 'family', 'choice', 'one', 'could', 'break', 'bond.In', '2008', 'Sex', 'City', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'time', 'Sex', 'City-The', 'Movie', 'where', 'became', 'instant', 'boxoffice', 'smash', 'was', 'surprise', 'was', 'immediate', 'sequel', 'called', 'Sex', 'City', '2', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'mediocre', 'script', 'girls', 'not', 'being', 'situated', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'was', 'commercial', 'flop', 'Still', 'nice', 'see', 'films', 'offered', 'new', 'box-set', 'collector', 'will', 'enjoy', 'posterity.The', 'bonuses', 'accompany', 'set', 'interviews', 'cast', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'next-episode', 'previews', 'more', 'subtitles', 'are', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full-screen', 'format', 'way', 'were', 'orignally', 'broadcast']",N/A
