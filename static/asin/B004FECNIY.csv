Also, this is not your usual legal drama where the legal issues are either about corporate or individual crime.More of the legal situations are about legal-aid, family issues. I personally believe there was a lot of realism in these situations rather than corporate or individual crime.However, a huge part of the drama is about inner character issues with the characters. I believe that the issues are presented very realistically when there are personal or ethical questions that arise. But the issues are always an integral part of interesting plot developments.Some dramas like to laugh issues off or start focusing too much on a particular romance. I have nothing against romance in dramas with many facets, and this series has been able to balance elements of plot.",5,"Character, plot, and issue driven.

1404871,A2W4ND2PUGULK2,B004FECNIY,Helen Kelley,"[7, 7]","I just discovered this gem on Netflix, and over a long week-end watched all 3 series.  I was so compelled by the intensity of this series that I ordered the complete set for future viewing.  There was such extraordinary character development--I almost felt the emotional pains that each experienced dealing with their individual life issues.  The stories regarding child advocacy were also realistic--at times very difficult to watch, for they brought back memories from my own past.  As I watched the character of James Mooney (Charles Malik Whitfield) morph into a person with a deep raging desire for revenge, it arrested my attention; for throughout the series he brought about a grittiness to his concern for the disadvantaged.  After brutally beating the person he thought was responsible for the death of his nephew he returned to work the next day as if nothing had happened revealing a dark side to his personality (the side hidden from those that he worked with daily).Simon Baker & Dabney Coleman (Burton & Nick Fallin) was a study in acute family dysfunction.  The legal stories were realistic, showing the aggressive & devious approach that can be taken in corporate law.  I enjoyed the epiphany moment when Nicolas (a psychologically complex person) realized the scandalous attitude of a coal mine owner in Pennsylvania--trying to coverup that his company was culpable for the serious health concerns in a small community.  Kathleen Chalfant did an outstanding job playing the character of Laurie Solt--tough, caring, dedicated and extremely concerned about the welfare of children.  I also enjoyed watching Rosenberg's character as Masterson. He was intense till the end--often struggling to keep his emotions in check.  Dysfunctional families; the inability to communicate effectively; emotional walls to hide deep seated pain; the inability to maintain healthy relationships; a 16 yr affair ultimately leading to divorce & a suicide attempt are a psychologist's dream.The Guardian showed that life is often messy.  The acting throughout the series was excellent.  Story lines very credible. Several notable guest stars were seen throughout the series:  Farrah Fawcett, Gina Torres (married to Laurence Fishburne), Lolita Davidovich, Chris Pine,Corey Feldman, Joseph Campanella & Bethany Joy Galeotti. It was a shame that this series did not last longer.  It is not often that we are shown programming of this quality.  I guess the TV industry would rather feed us reality shows and 'vanity fair.'",5,A Hidden Treasure!!!,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,2513,"['just', 'discovered', 'gem', 'Netflix', 'long', 'week-end', 'watched', '3', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'compelled', 'intensity', 'series', 'ordered', 'complete', 'set', 'future', 'viewing', 'was', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'character', 'development', 'almost', 'felt', 'emotional', 'pains', 'experienced', 'dealing', 'individual', 'life', 'issues', 'stories', 'regarding', 'child', 'advocacy', 'were', 'also', 'realistic', 'times', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'own', 'past', 'watched', 'character', 'James', 'Mooney', 'Charles', 'Malik', 'Whitfield', 'morph', 'person', 'deep', 'raging', 'desire', 'revenge', 'arrested', 'attention', 'series', 'brought', 'about', 'grittiness', 'concern', 'disadvantaged', 'brutally', 'beating', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'responsible', 'death', 'nephew', 'returned', 'work', 'next', 'day', 'nothing', 'had', 'happened', 'revealing', 'dark', 'side', 'personality', 'side', 'hidden', 'worked', 'daily', '.Simon', 'Baker', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Burton', 'Nick', 'Fallin', 'was', 'study', 'acute', 'family', 'dysfunction', 'legal', 'stories', 'were', 'realistic', 'showing', 'aggressive', 'devious', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'corporate', 'law', 'enjoyed', 'epiphany', 'moment', 'when', 'Nicolas', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'person', 'realized', 'scandalous', 'attitude', 'coal', 'mine', 'owner', 'Pennsylvania', 'trying', 'coverup', 'company', 'was', 'culpable', 'serious', 'health', 'concerns', 'small', 'community', 'Kathleen', 'Chalfant', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'Laurie', 'Solt', 'tough', 'caring', 'dedicated', 'extremely', 'concerned', 'welfare', 'children', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Rosenberg', 'character', 'Masterson', 'was', 'intense', 'end', 'often', 'struggling', 'keep', 'emotions', 'check', 'Dysfunctional', 'families', 'inability', 'communicate', 'effectively', 'emotional', 'walls', 'hide', 'deep', 'seated', 'pain', 'inability', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'relationships', '16', 'yr', 'affair', 'ultimately', 'leading', 'divorce', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'are', 'psychologist', 'dream.The', 'Guardian', 'showed', 'life', 'often', 'messy', 'acting', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'Story', 'lines', 'very', 'credible', 'Several', 'notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'were', 'seen', 'series', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'married', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Lolita', 'Davidovich', 'Chris', 'Pine', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'Joseph', 'Campanella', 'Bethany', 'Joy', 'Galeotti', 'was', 'shame', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'last', 'longer', 'not', 'often', 'are', 'shown', 'programming', 'quality', 'guess', 'TV', 'industry', 'would', 'rather', 'feed', 'reality', 'shows', ""'vanity"", 'fair']",N/A

It's about Nick Fallin (Simon Baker) an arrogant corporate lawyer who has to serve a 1500 hour community service sentence for drug possession.  What makes this series so special is that the stories are realistic covering dark issues such as child abuse, incest, etc..  The casting is excellent.  It took me about 3 weeks to watch 67 episodes from 3 seasons.  I can't remember the last time I saw such a realistic show with such realistic characters and excellent character development.

A very intriguing DRAMA that explores the progression of a smart young corporate lawyer, Nick (Simon Baker), from heartless, cold corporate lawyer to that of a caring human being with a conscience.  Nick loves money and replaces his emotional void with drugs until he is caught and sentenced to community service whose clientele are children.  Excellent acting by the entire cast; the child actors are amazing.  This series is not a feel good drama - the story lines are very realistic and common sense is second fiddle to the savagery of current laws.  All of the characters are flawed and one watches how each struggles to live within their skins; some flounder - some rise to the top.  What is right versus what is legal is explored throughout the series.  I bring these DVDs to evening ""dinner and a movie"" gatherings of friends; I usually end up leaving them as friends want to watch more of this excellent series.

1404876,A2N4AG4AK6HYEV,B004FECNIY,Peggy Daniels,"[0, 0]","&#34;The Guardian&#34; ran from 2001-2004. It is about a young high power attorney, Nick Fallin, (Simon Baker) who gets busted for drug possession and is sentenced to 3 years probation,1.500 hours of community service and is fined $10,000. He works in his father's Burton Fallin's (Dabney Coleman) law firm Fallin and Associates. He and his father are the only people in the firm who know about his conviction and there is a lot of pressure on Nick to keep up with the demands of the firm and his duties as a child advocate. As a result of this, he is often mistaken by his fellow employees as belonging to the firm only because he is Burton's son. His character is, at first, quite jaded and he has a very strained relationship with his father. He is made a partner in the firm which further displeases the other lawyers who don't understand why he is missing board meetings and meetings with clients without repercussions. The character development is well done as you watch Nick trying to come to terms with his double life and how to communicate with his father. Nick is not at all like the character (Patrick Jane) Simon Baker plays in &#34;The Mentalist.&#34; &#34;The Guardian&#34; is a testimony to how versatile Simon Baker is as an actor and how compelling his character's always are.
