Shiva Rea gives plenty of options to allow you to work to your own level and yet the challenges are still there for you to aim for.On the dvd is also technical instructionals, on the Bandhas and allignment, which are helpful and informative.There is also plenty on meditation and pranyama.Shiva Rea's freeform yoga demonstration is a delight to see.There are interviews with renowned yogis  -  p.s.

Someone who has just had a basic introduction to yoga could stick with the basic flow routine.

Also, you wil not get the the full benefit of the poses if you do not really know how to do this.  Please respect your body!That being said, Shiva has provided a beautiful dvd with quite an extensive routine.  She uses a lot of the different types of yoga such as Iyengar and Kundalini as influences to her practice of yoga but generally I think she is more in the vinyasa,Astanga style.  There are a lot of sun salutation variations and use of the chataranga, up dog, down dog sequence as a flow between poses.

Technically, all a beginner needs to do is slow things down and bit ~ do what you can do, and you'll improve over time ~ but it's in most people's nature to try and ""keep up.""  This leads to irritation and perhaps even injury.Keep this in mind if you're new to Yoga.  If the practice is moving too fast, hang in Downdog or restore in Child's Pose (that's what we do in class) until you're ready to start again.  Or leave out the extra vinyasas.

Instead, it is a DVD that allows your practice to grow and evolve, and could easily be the only yoga DVD you own.  It offers several options for each part of a practice session, so you can modify your session to your level, time constraints, and interest.  The ""Yoga Matrix"" is not a gimic, but a terrific tool that makes this DVD much more valuable than most.I also find the tone of this DVD to be perfect, striking a balance between the extremely spiritual and the strictly athletic.  Poses are presented with their sanskrit names, and there is a sense that yoga is more than a physical workout.  On the other hand, the spiritual side won't overwhelm or intimidate.  It offers a gentle suggestion that there might be more to yoga than excellent abs, without feeling pushy or ""out there"".Shiva Rea is someone who taught and wrote on yoga long before it became fashionable.  She is one of the big names in yoga without having that Yoga Star air that I've found annoying on some other DVDs.  She knows her stuff, presents it gently and accurately, and seems to have made it a priority to create a DVD useful to people who want to develop a strong yoga practice.Truly, if you buy one DVD, this is the one.  It will keep you busy and interested for months.An addendum, after several more uses:  Every time I use this DVD, I want to add a couple stars to my review.  I even want to buy it again because it's so good, at the same time that I resent the other yoga DVDs I bought in my last binge, because this is the only one I'll need for some time.  I tried the longer, harder sessions, and found the whole session was a bit beyond my abilities (now).  So I program my workout to include one or two element from the harder sessions, so I can work my way up.

I had not progressed far enough along in my abilities to get what she was doing.  I couldn't believe how great of a yoga series this was once I had matured far enough along in my yoga practice to appreciate it.  This is not Ashtanga, it is Iyengar based Vinyasa flow yoga.  Believe me though, if your abilities are anywhere between intermediate-beginner to intermediate this dvd will greatly enhance your yogic ability and appreciation for Shiva's practitioning of yoga.  When I mentioned before that I didn't like the break between sections because I felt it took away from the flow, well, I take that back as well.  I used the small breaks between sections to catch my breath.  I have only done the basic sun salutation and solar flow 1.  I have to say they are both wonderful and exhausting.  I did the solar flow 1 two days in a row and my legs felt like wet noodles afterward, but in a good way, as if they had been stretched and worked but not like in a weight lifting type of wet noodle.  There are still two other pre recorded (solar flow 2 and lunar flow) that I have yet to get to but are looking forward to trying out.  The primary reason I am staying with the solar flow 1 is because of the wonderful shoulder opener sequence she has put into that routine.  Then there is the ""yoga matrix"" which makes the possibilities almost endless.Not to end on a bad not, but if you do not have time to do a practice past 45 minutes, then don't get this dvd.  If, however, you can make the time to do an almost ninety minute practice, then buy this dvd.  If you are just starting out with yoga, go ahead and buy it and save it for a later day, because you will eventually (if you practice steadily) be able to do this video.Another good thing that she does is to show the poses in various stages from ""beginner"" (a little harder actually) to the more advanced, or the complete pose (I usually found myself doing stage one of a pose where she usually has three stages with one being the easiest and three or four being the most difficult).Remember, don't get frustrated and don't overextend yourself by trying to keep up with Ms. Rea.

193168,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,1591791847,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[49, 51]","Yoga Shakti is a beautifully filmed, extremely well put-together yoga DVD with virtually unlimited options. As she did with her yoga CD, Yoga Sanctuary, instructor Shiva Rea has broken down the practice into a series of segments of varying lengths. These segments form the ""Yoga Matrix,"" a mix-and-match option which allows you to complete customize your yoga practice. But that's not all: if you prefer a pre-designed practice, Shiva has done that for you as well, offering four unique practices to choose from.Here is a summary of the selections available: 4 opening meditations (these generally combine breathing with flowing, almost dance-y movements); 5 sun/moon salutation series (although once of these, Rhythmic Vinyasa 2, is only available via the pre-programmed practices and is not on the matrix); 4 dancing warrior series (3 to 6 minutes in length); 2 transitional series (breathing and core work); 3 standing pose flows (moving from basic to much more challenging postures such as arm balances); 3 backbend prep series; 1 handstand and 3 backbend flow series; 2 counter pose sequences; 3 closing series (including 1 on inversions); and finally, shavasana or final relaxation. If you add that all up, you will see that you have a choice of THIRTY different segments to choose from, which allows you to customize both the posture focus and the length of your practice (the segments vary anywhere from about 2.5 minutes to almost 25 minutes for the longest standing series). In the very helpful booklet that accompanies the DVD set, Shiva talks in detail about how to use the Yoga Matrix to best suit your needs.As I mentioned above, Shiva has also included four complete practices pre-designed from the matrix offerings. The first is a 36 minute ""Basic Flow"" which leads you through simple sun salutations, basic standing poses, and easy backbends/counterposes. There are also two ""Solar Flow"" practices, each over an hour in length (86 minutes and 92 minutes). Both include the more challenging standing and backbend sequences, with the shorter adding core/handstand and the longer adding inversions. The final pre-programmed sequence is a 1-hour ""Lunar Flow,"" a gentle, flowing practice which could also be considered a more basic or beginning level.I would not recommend this DVD for those completely new to yoga; although Shiva is an excellent instructor, she seems to assume some prior familiarly with yoga, as she does not always go into detail about form. Furthermore, she often moves quickly, especially in the standing flow sequences, and it can be difficult to see the television as you are trying to follow along, especially if you are inexperienced. In fact, I consider myself to be at about an intermediate level, and I found that Shiva sometimes moved too fast for my liking. I much preferred her more gentle flows; some of my favorite segments of the DVD were the Prana yoga (one of the opening meditations), the first two backbend flows, the counter poses, and the inversions. I also enjoyed the final pranayama (breathing) and meditation, both of which I found very relaxing.In addition to all of the above, there is a second DVD in this set which contains interviews with various yogis and similar footage, certainly a worthwhile bonus. And it must be said that the scenery in this DVD is absolutely gorgeous: most of the segments are filmed on beautiful beaches in the Maldives, sometimes in daytime, sometimes at dusk. I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD set to anyone who is at least at the experienced beginner level, who enjoys fast-paced, flowing vinyasa sequences, and who thrives on variety in their yoga practice.",5,Possibly the most versatile yoga DVD ever made,1141171200,"03 1, 2006",2006,3658,"['Yoga', 'Shakti', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'extremely', 'well', 'put-together', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'virtually', 'unlimited', 'options', 'did', 'yoga', 'CD', 'Yoga', 'Sanctuary', 'instructor', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'broken', 'down', 'practice', 'series', 'segments', 'varying', 'lengths', 'segments', 'form', 'Yoga', 'Matrix', 'mix-and-match', 'option', 'complete', 'customize', 'yoga', 'practice', 'not', 'prefer', 'pre-designed', 'practice', 'Shiva', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'offering', 'four', 'unique', 'practices', 'choose', 'summary', 'selections', 'available', '4', 'opening', 'meditations', 'generally', 'combine', 'breathing', 'flowing', 'almost', 'dance-y', 'movements', '5', 'sun/moon', 'salutation', 'series', 'once', 'Rhythmic', 'Vinyasa', '2', 'only', 'available', 'pre-programmed', 'practices', 'not', 'matrix', '4', 'dancing', 'warrior', 'series', '3', '6', 'minutes', 'length', '2', 'transitional', 'series', 'breathing', 'core', 'work', '3', 'standing', 'pose', 'flows', 'moving', 'basic', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'postures', 'such', 'arm', 'balances', '3', 'backbend', 'prep', 'series', '1', 'handstand', '3', 'backbend', 'flow', 'series', '2', 'counter', 'pose', 'sequences', '3', 'closing', 'series', 'including', '1', 'inversions', 'finally', 'shavasana', 'final', 'relaxation', 'add', 'up', 'will', 'see', 'have', 'choice', 'THIRTY', 'different', 'segments', 'choose', 'customize', 'posture', 'focus', 'length', 'practice', 'segments', 'vary', 'anywhere', '2.5', 'minutes', 'almost', '25', 'minutes', 'longest', 'standing', 'series', 'very', 'helpful', 'booklet', 'DVD', 'set', 'Shiva', 'talks', 'detail', 'how', 'use', 'Yoga', 'Matrix', 'best', 'suit', 'needs.As', 'mentioned', 'Shiva', 'also', 'included', 'four', 'complete', 'practices', 'pre-designed', 'matrix', 'offerings', 'first', '36', 'minute', 'Basic', 'Flow', 'simple', 'sun', 'salutations', 'basic', 'standing', 'poses', 'easy', 'backbends/counterposes', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'Solar', 'Flow', 'practices', 'hour', 'length', '86', 'minutes', '92', 'minutes', 'include', 'more', 'challenging', 'standing', 'backbend', 'sequences', 'shorter', 'adding', 'core/handstand', 'longer', 'adding', 'inversions', 'final', 'pre-programmed', 'sequence', '1-hour', 'Lunar', 'Flow', 'gentle', 'flowing', 'practice', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'considered', 'more', 'basic', 'beginning', 'level.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'completely', 'new', 'yoga', 'Shiva', 'excellent', 'instructor', 'assume', 'prior', 'familiarly', 'yoga', 'not', 'always', 'go', 'detail', 'form', 'Furthermore', 'often', 'quickly', 'especially', 'standing', 'flow', 'sequences', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'see', 'television', 'are', 'trying', 'follow', 'along', 'especially', 'are', 'inexperienced', 'fact', 'consider', 'be', 'intermediate', 'level', 'found', 'Shiva', 'sometimes', 'moved', 'too', 'fast', 'liking', 'much', 'preferred', 'more', 'gentle', 'flows', 'favorite', 'segments', 'DVD', 'were', 'Prana', 'yoga', 'one', 'opening', 'meditations', 'first', 'two', 'backbend', 'flows', 'counter', 'poses', 'inversions', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'pranayama', 'breathing', 'meditation', 'found', 'very', 'relaxing.In', 'addition', 'above', 'second', 'DVD', 'set', 'interviews', 'various', 'yogis', 'similar', 'footage', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'bonus', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'scenery', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'most', 'segments', 'are', 'filmed', 'beautiful', 'beaches', 'Maldives', 'sometimes', 'daytime', 'sometimes', 'dusk', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'anyone', 'who', 'least', 'experienced', 'beginner', 'level', 'who', 'fast-paced', 'flowing', 'vinyasa', 'sequences', 'who', 'variety', 'yoga', 'practice']",N/A

Shiva Rea does a wonderful job of instructing. It's amazing that it was filmed in such a short period of time. The scenery is beautiful, the music is lovely and includes ocean sounds that make this practice very soothing. But it is not for beginners. It is quite challenging and I would rate it intermediate. I've been looking for intermediate practices on DVD, but they usually end up being Westernized Power Yoga. This is very traditional yoga with lots of postures you won't see on other DVDs. I think Shiva Rea's intent was to help those of us at home that have been doing yoga for a while, but looking to learn more. She definitely fills this need. I love this DVD!!!You can choose the predefined practices or make your own with the menu interface. Wow, this is great! I've tried other DVD's that piece together segments, but this one is unique. The segments flow together very well and there's not abrupt stopping and starting between the segments. You bring up the matrix and choose the segments you want.This is a two-DVD set. The first DVD is the yoga practice. The second is filled with detailed instructions on the poses and all sorts of other footage.

I have a number of yoga DVDs to guide my practice at home, and I find myself going back to this DVD (as well as EVa Barash's Living Room Yoga) more often than others.The practice DVD has 4 basic practices, but it also has a matrix that allows you to mix various segments to make your own practice sequence.  It is difficult to get tired of the DVD because of this feature.Whether you follow the set sequences in the DVD or make your own, your practice will be quiet, meditative, soothing, relaxing.  This is primarily due to Shiva Rea's approach, soothing voice and choice of location, background music and asanas/poses. I love the meditation and the shavana (resting pose) segments.  There is no rushing into anything.  That said, the practices will make you work out a sweat!The set also includes a ""bonus"" DVD containing an interview with Shiva Rea as well as other practitioners, additional (very useful and insightful) instructions and clips from India.If you are a beginner, I will not recommend this until you have been practicing regularly for months.

I used to swim a mile per day until my work prevented me from doing so hence I switched to yoga.  Some reviews said it is not for beginners - not necessarily.  There are 4 sequences, & you can use the matrix to create your own.  I watched the entire thing & was amazed at Shiva's advanced techniques.  I'll definitely not reach that level for a long long time, if ever.  But I started off doing the basic sequence with no problem.  I do yoga twice a week at my gym with an instructor, which helped me get acquainted with all the pose names.  The other 5 days of the week I do yoga with Shiva's DVD.  If you are true beginner, get the ""Yoga Journal's Beginner Guide"" DVD first to get familiarized with the poses before doing this one.  I've researched many other DVDs before I settled on this one & I have to say Shiva is hands down, the BEST!  Her soothing voice & graceful demeanor & the beautiful backdrop & her cute outfit - I could never get tired of watching her, this is EXACTLY what yoga is to me.  I've watched other yoga DVDs where the instructors with high pitched voice kinda barking like an aerobic instructor - that's not what I envisioned yoga.

I was looking for more of a physical challenge and at the end of the workout I don't believe I had broken a sweat or had a sip of my water. Great, graceful flow from one pose to the next, however, I did not feel that the poses were long enough to feel a good burn. I enjoy yoga for both its physical aspect and its spiritual aspect but if I had to choose, I would rather a tough, sculpting workout over a good meditation.Also, I felt that there were an awful lot of handstands and backbends, where I would rather have had more lunges and balance poses. In addition, there were quite a few ""contortionist"" poses centering around improving flexibility wheras I would rather have had more holds in a deep squat or something. However, the awesome matrix to program my own workout can give me the option to make the session more intense. (I should also probably mention that I am a life-long ballet dancer so I am already pretty toned and flexible, so what is easy to me may be more difficult for others).All that aside, she has a very soothing voice, she is incredibly graceful to watch and the video has BEAUTIFUL scenery.

This DVD is incredible, a breath of fresh air!I have had Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Sanctuary"" CD for several years so I was already familiar with her beautiful style of teaching.One of the things I love about Shiva's approach here is her use of dynamic movement which means that she flows gently into and out of the asana before holding them statically. This is not only great for warming you into the more static postures but it requires coordination and a real breath awareness which enhances the overall body-mind connection.I would agree that this is not a beginners DVD, one would be best off starting with something like Yoga Zone's ""Introduction To Yoga"" or Yoga Zone ""Basics"" to familiarize themselves with the basic poses. But one doesn't have to be very advanced to do this either. There are certainly very advanced variations of the poses, but she always starts from a simple expression of each pose, and then gives you the option to go to a more complex variation of it if you are able.It's always important to remember that in Yoga, how ""far"" you go into a pose is less important than the ""awareness"" with which you practice. If one is practicing the most advanced variation but is thinking about other things then it ceases to be Yoga, whereas if they are doing the most basic version of the pose but practice it with awareness, then it you are doing Yoga  (this is a paraphrase of something that master teacher David Swenson said in the introduction to his Ashtanga Yoga ""The Practice"" Primary Series program).""Yoga Shakti"" has four pre-programmed routines which in and of themselves are worth the price of the DVD. In addition, there is a programmable  Matrix which is an incredible feature (and very easy to use). It truly gives you infinite flexibility to build your practice. I think a good way to work with the matrix's endless possibilities is to make a chart of all the various sequences (as laid out in the matrix), photocopy it and then  highlight or circle different sequence combinations to keep track of those that you like.This DVD is gorgeously filmed in India, the music is incredible, and  Shiva gives inspiring instruction and demonstrates the poses to perfection! There is a second DVD in the set which has a lot of extras, raw footage from India of festivities and other interesting things.This is not a ""workout"" style DVD but a Yoga DVD that makes no apologies for embracing the more spiritual side of the practice, so there is a lot of poetic and spiritual language. This is very fitting for the type of teacher Shiva Rea is. She  is obviously very deeply connected to the depths of Yoga beyond just the physical practice of Yoga. That being said, this DVD is also without a doubt, one of the best asana programs I've seen!Highly recommended!Namaste",5,Yoga Shakti : Yoga Bliss and a Breath of Fresh Air,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,2919,"['9', 'years', 'daily', 'yoga', 'practice', '90', 'Yoga', 'programs', 'library', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'what', 'out', 'there', 'marketplace', 'DVD', 'incredible', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'have', 'had', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Yoga', 'Sanctuary', 'CD', 'several', 'years', 'so', 'was', 'already', 'familiar', 'beautiful', 'style', 'teaching.One', 'things', 'love', 'Shiva', 'approach', 'here', 'use', 'dynamic', 'movement', 'gently', 'asana', 'holding', 'statically', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'warming', 'more', 'static', 'postures', 'coordination', 'real', 'breath', 'awareness', 'overall', 'body-mind', 'connection.I', 'would', 'agree', 'not', 'beginners', 'DVD', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'starting', 'something', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Introduction', 'Yoga', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'Basics', 'familiarize', 'basic', 'poses', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'very', 'advanced', 'do', 'either', 'are', 'certainly', 'very', 'advanced', 'variations', 'poses', 'always', 'simple', 'expression', 'pose', 'then', 'option', 'go', 'more', 'complex', 'variation', 'are', 'able.It', 'always', 'important', 'remember', 'Yoga', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'pose', 'less', 'important', 'awareness', 'practice', 'one', 'practicing', 'most', 'advanced', 'variation', 'thinking', 'other', 'things', 'then', 'be', 'Yoga', 'whereas', 'are', 'doing', 'most', 'basic', 'version', 'pose', 'practice', 'awareness', 'then', 'are', 'doing', 'Yoga', 'paraphrase', 'something', 'master', 'teacher', 'David', 'Swenson', 'said', 'introduction', 'Ashtanga', 'Yoga', 'Practice', 'Primary', 'Series', 'program', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'four', 'pre-programmed', 'routines', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'DVD', 'addition', 'programmable', 'Matrix', 'incredible', 'feature', 'very', 'easy', 'use', 'truly', 'infinite', 'flexibility', 'build', 'practice', 'think', 'good', 'way', 'work', 'matrix', 'endless', 'possibilities', 'make', 'chart', 'various', 'sequences', 'laid', 'out', 'matrix', 'photocopy', 'then', 'highlight', 'circle', 'different', 'sequence', 'combinations', 'keep', 'track', 'like.This', 'DVD', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'India', 'music', 'incredible', 'Shiva', 'inspiring', 'instruction', 'poses', 'perfection', 'second', 'DVD', 'set', 'lot', 'extras', 'raw', 'footage', 'India', 'festivities', 'other', 'interesting', 'things.This', 'not', 'workout', 'style', 'DVD', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'apologies', 'embracing', 'more', 'spiritual', 'side', 'practice', 'lot', 'poetic', 'spiritual', 'language', 'very', 'fitting', 'type', 'teacher', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'obviously', 'very', 'deeply', 'connected', 'depths', 'Yoga', 'just', 'physical', 'practice', 'Yoga', 'being', 'said', 'DVD', 'also', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'asana', 'programs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Namaste']",N/A

In response to another reviewer, I am Over 40 and have practiced yoga for 7 years, but I can do all these sequences and I am not any kind of athlete, just an ordinary person.  And just so everyone knows, Shiva Rea is over 30 and Ana Forrest is over 45, yet look at some of the things she can do!  This is another beautiful example of how yoga keeps the body young far into what our youth-obsessed society would call ""Middle Age"".Now, I would agree wholeheartedly that this is not a practice for beginners, in fact, the Solar Flow 2 would probably be very discouraging to a beginner but as Shiva says on the back of the cover album;  ""honor where you are"" and more forward from there. Even the Lunar Flow practice has a couple of poses that would be very difficult for a beginner but Shiva does offer modifications. This is a more fast-paced, Astanga/Vinyasa style yoga, So if you are used to Iyengar, be ready for a change up.  There are really alot of dance aspects in it too, undoubtedly brought in from Shiva's background in dance at UCLA.I love the multi-cultural music soundtrack also.

I would recommend this DVD to beginners / intermediates who have either attended yoga classes previously or have a good instructional yoga video like Yoga For Dummies.The video is stunning - natural locations with brilliant colors. Shiva's voice is very calming and provides proper cueing. The DVD matrix option provides customizable workouts, providing the best use of DVD technology for Yoga workouts.

The value of the package is exceptional - over two and half hours of total yoga instruction.  With the customizable feature that provides variety and different lengths of workouts, you may not need to buy any additional Yoga DVDs.  The music track is the best I have heard, it is a Indian - electronic ambient dub.  The artists are given credit in the DVD and printed material.

Shiva's midriff top is distracting because she has a little too much of a belly showing.  Given her high level of fitness, I almost wonder if she may be pregnant.

I'm glad I ignored that and purchased it anyway.  This is a great DVD!  It's a bit different than the yoga I'm used to, but I'd say it's classic yoga stuff with a little bit of a twist.  Not too out there that someone who is traditional in their yoga practice won't like it, but not your average yoga practice either.  She basically just adds a little more fluidity to everything, but it's not to the extent that you feel like you are flailing around strangely or doing trance dance.My favorite segments on this DVD are the dancing warrior segments.  They are very challenging, fun, and get your heart going.  I like the way she keeps almost constant movement.  This makes it a good workout and something to really work towards.The reason I highly recommend this DVD to everyonne is because of the yoga matrix.  I do not like all of the segments in this DVD, but I like some of them.  The matrix lets me bypass the segments I don't like and only do the ones that I enjoy.  It also lets me create my own practice based on what I feel like doing that day or how much time I have.The setting is also beautiful.  This DVD is highly conducive to relaxation and meditation, if that is your thing.  I was unsure of her voice at first, but I have grown to really like it.  It is soothing and she gives very good instruction.I probably will make this a regular in my collection.  I still have some other favorites that I prefer, but this one is a great addition.

193183,A15TIAG5RDIGGY,1591791847,Elizabeth M,"[700, 706]","This is a lovely yoga video in so many ways. I, like most reviewers, cannot rave enough about the ""yoga matrix"", the feature of this DVD that allows you to choose which poses you want to do. Wonderful, wonderful feature. I went through each of the four pre-set workouts first though to get familiar with the poses, and that was an interesting experience because the two ""solar flows"" contain much harder poses than the other two.There really is great variety in the level of difficulty on this tape- some of the poses I just couldn't do, and some I had to do at the first level. That was a bit humbling (and reminded me that working with where you are is important in yoga!) It's nice now that I've moved on to using the custom practice feature that I can add in a new difficult one each time to work on.I recommend having 1-2 blocks and a strap handy before getting started with this DVD. Some of the poses use them regardless of your skill level. A blanket to roll up is also a good friend on occasion.The music and the scenery were lovely, but here are my (relatively minor) gripes:1. Sometimes Shiva moves too quickly and it's hard to follow her when learning the poses. Some of these poses were new to me and I was lost trying to follow the instructions. This DVD seems to assume familiarity with all poses in advance- in fact there are some it advises against doing unless you've learned them with an instructor. I admit to cheating on that front.2. The poses are almost always called by their Sanskrit name. This is fairly useful and educational, except for the fact that when doing a home routine it's easier to not have to look at the TV in the middle of a pose, and some users may not be able to consistently match names with poses. Just a head's up if you're in that camp!3. The poses are not organized in the booklet in the same order that they are in the matrix, so if you need to look one up it can be confusing.3a. Also, it''d be nice when adding segments to your custom routine if the DVD would tell you how long each of the segments is instead of just the name. Sometimes I only have an hour for yoga and want to make sure I haven't just chosen a sequence that will take ninety minutes.4. Sometimes the camera doesn't pan quickly enough to the part of the body you need to see in order to assume a pose. As a result, I think a beginner would need to be careful about what poses s/he attempted, and to read the book carefully or stick to the first basic workout or the lunar flow for a while.I'd say to get the most out of this a practitioner probably would want to be advanced beginner/intermediate level at a minimum, and able to keep some perspective on not being able to manage all of the intense bends Shiva does. This is a DVD that will grow with you as you progress in your yoga practice.p.s I was so glad to find that this contained different breathing exercises as well as a wonderful, calming forward bend sequence.

The flow is fast, but not as fast as ashtanga, but there are pauses between workout segments (may help you catch your breath/regain your composure).  This DVD is broken down into four workouts.  The first is the basic workout last for about 45 minutes, it is good for an experienced beginner (1+ year of experience), the second and third are closer to 90 minutes each and have alot of intermediate to advanced arm balances in them (e.g. crow pose, forearm balance, handstands, arm pressure pose, and many others).  The first 90 minute series is geared towards hip and should opening, while second is geared towards back bending.  Both are very challenging, but Shiva does a nice job of demonstrating modifications/stages for difficult poses.  There is also a lunar flow which has more restorative poses (about 75 minutes long) and is great when you don't feel up to either of the 90 minute flows, but want something more challenging than the basic flow.  You also can create your own workout.  The DVD includes 30 different vinyasa flow workouts and you can arrange into your own workout to last from 15 minutes to 2.5 hours.This DVD compares well in terms of level of difficulty and amount of sweat as it relates to ashtanga.  Shiva Rea has an ashtanga background and it shows, when she performs jump throughs and jump backs (for you ashtanga folks out there, her jumps are very floaty), as well as her ability to perform a lot of the poses I've seen in the various ashtanga series.  Almost anyone (barring with either more than 5 years of experience or a flat out contortionist) would find doing either of the 90 minute segments with the full versions of advanced poses difficult.  Before practicing with this DVD, please watch it first.  You need to be able to anticipate a little bit what comes next, because some of the poses are advanced, and you don't want to miss the modification or break the flow.  With that said, this is an excellent DVD.  A person could use this DVD for a long while by rotating these workouts to work on different things on different days, and that's before you start creating your own workouts.  If you are looking to go to take your yoga practice to the intermediate or advanced level, then this is the DVD to buy.

193195,A1ZMPQFEK37SL,1591791847,Just-Jennie,"[9, 10]","Let me start off by saying I am a TOTAL NEWBIE to yoga. I originally bought Kathy Smith - New Yoga Basics to start off because I am a beginner and to tell the truth, I absolutely HATED this video! This video alone would have made me stop doing yoga! It was slow, she talked too much and I thought it was very BORING.  But I did not give up!  I also took a beginners class and thought ""Hey, I could get into this, but I am so unflexible, I don't know what I'm doing and I totally look like an eejit!"" So I decided to by Yoga Zone - flexibility and Tone (Beginners) which I like very much. This whetted my taste for Yoga to say the least!Since I am a workout DVD junkie and I am getting into Yoga, I was on Amazon searching and I saw Shiva Rea's Yoga Shakti.  Everyone gave it such high reviews and I thought ""Why the heck not?"" SO I bought it.  I have used it 3 times so far and I love it! I did the first series (which I think was the basic flows). Then I watched the second series (Sun salutations I believe) which was pretty long. After I watched that portion I decided I would enter the Matrix. That is an unbelievable concept! I was able to choose the exercises that I wanted to do, in the order that I wanted to do them.  I do not see how anyone could get bored with this DVD. There are just so many varieties that you could do depending upon your mood and how long you want to do your yoga for.I do not believe that this video is not geared towards beginners. As I said, I've really only done yoga half a dozen times -- once in a class environment, the rest on my own.  However if you ARE new to yoga I do suggest watching the portion you want to do once. She does each pose quite a few times so you can watch each pose twice to get the jist, then fast forward to the next one.  This makes it easier when you decide to embark on your journey as you won't have to really turn your head to watch what she is doing.  Her instruction is very good, her voice is very soothing and relaxing and you really get into the flow. A previous reviewer complained about the fact that the matrix doesn't ""flow"" as well as doing the different portions does, but so far I haven't had a problem with it.  As with the regular portions of the video, there is a pause between ""routines"" where it shows the name of the next series of ""poses"" and in my opinion this gives you a chance to reconnect and center yourself for the next portion.Although I have just purchased another Yoga Zone beginner DVD, I am extremely happy that I bought Yoga Shakti and I know I will use it more often than not!",5,"Love the ""Matrix""!",1121644800,"07 18, 2005",2005,2576,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'TOTAL', 'NEWBIE', 'yoga', 'originally', 'bought', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'New', 'Yoga', 'Basics', 'start', 'off', 'am', 'beginner', 'tell', 'truth', 'absolutely', 'HATED', 'video', 'video', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'stop', 'doing', 'was', 'slow', 'talked', 'too', 'much', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'BORING', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'also', 'took', 'beginners', 'class', 'thought', 'Hey', 'could', 'get', 'am', 'so', 'unflexible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'doing', 'totally', 'look', 'eejit', 'decided', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'flexibility', 'Tone', 'Beginners', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'whetted', 'taste', 'Yoga', 'say', 'least', 'am', 'workout', 'DVD', 'junkie', 'am', 'getting', 'Yoga', 'was', 'Amazon', 'searching', 'saw', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'Everyone', 'gave', 'such', 'high', 'reviews', 'thought', 'Why', 'heck', 'not', 'bought', 'have', 'used', '3', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'love', 'did', 'first', 'series', 'think', 'was', 'basic', 'flows', 'Then', 'watched', 'second', 'series', 'Sun', 'salutations', 'believe', 'was', 'pretty', 'long', 'watched', 'portion', 'decided', 'would', 'enter', 'Matrix', 'unbelievable', 'concept', 'was', 'able', 'choose', 'exercises', 'wanted', 'do', 'order', 'wanted', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'get', 'bored', 'DVD', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'varieties', 'could', 'do', 'depending', 'mood', 'how', 'long', 'want', 'do', 'yoga', 'for.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'video', 'not', 'geared', 'towards', 'beginners', 'said', ""'ve"", 'really', 'only', 'done', 'yoga', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'once', 'class', 'environment', 'rest', 'own', 'However', 'ARE', 'new', 'yoga', 'do', 'suggest', 'watching', 'portion', 'want', 'do', 'once', 'pose', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'pose', 'twice', 'get', 'jist', 'then', 'fast', 'forward', 'next', 'one', 'easier', 'when', 'decide', 'embark', 'journey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'really', 'turn', 'head', 'watch', 'what', 'doing', 'instruction', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'very', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'really', 'get', 'flow', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'complained', 'fact', 'matrix', ""n't"", 'flow', 'as', 'well', 'doing', 'different', 'portions', 'so', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problem', 'regular', 'portions', 'video', 'pause', 'routines', 'where', 'name', 'next', 'series', 'poses', 'opinion', 'chance', 'reconnect', 'center', 'next', 'portion.Although', 'have', 'just', 'purchased', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'beginner', 'DVD', 'am', 'extremely', 'happy', 'bought', 'Yoga', 'Shakti', 'know', 'will', 'use', 'more', 'often', 'not']",N/A

I practice Yoga every day and teach Power yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Club. I personally prefer physically demanding Yoga routines following the Ashtanga tradition. Beeing german my english spelling is pretty bad, sorry for that.About the DVD: This is the most complete Yoga DVD I have seen to date. Shiva Reas mastery in Yoga is impressive. I also believe the DVD is for everybody from Beginner (meaning you already took some Yoga lessons and know the Basic Poses) to advances Practicioners. There're so many different routines on the DVD that everybody will find some place to start. The best thing is the unique Yoga Matrix allowing you to create your own Yoga routinge choosing from many different shorter sequences. There're some not so fast modified Sun Salutations on the DVD, some pretty fast an fluid modified Sunsalutations, as well as advanced Routines including Armbalances like Galvasana. As I said before, there should be something for every Yogi. Shivas style of teaching is professionel and gentil. She gives a lot of important information in a calm soothing manner.Please note that her shorter DVD's on Lunar Flow, Solar Flow and Sunsalutations are taken mainly from Yoga Shakti, so I recommend buying the Yoga Shakti DVD and owning the whole programm.I highly recommend this DVD!

I have David Swenson's superb DVD for the First Series (of Ashtanga) and Richard Freeman's excellent DVD.  Shiva Rea's is my third, and I bought it on the strength of the reviews here.  It's more than worth the money.Rea's teaching is grounded in Ashtanga/vinyasa style yoga, which means the poses are linked, for the most part, by a series of repeated connecting movements derived from the sun salutation.  Rea offers variations on the sun salutation, and provides four complete practice sessions.  As other reviewers have noted, the DVD's really brilliant feature is the Yoga Matrix, which lets you build your own practice session.  You click on the different poses or sequences one-by-one to create your own session, and you can change it every time.Watching Rea do the poses is inspiring.  She moves with enormous clarity and vitality.  To paraphrase Yogi Berra, you can learn a lot by watching.  She is fairly sparse with verbal instructions about each pose, probably because she feels that the details are best learned from one-on-one instruction.  Still, if you have no prior knowledge of hatha, it would likely be hard to learn it solely from this DVD, which seems to be aimed at people with knowledge of the fundamental poses and sun salutation.The DVD improved my practice.  Watching a true master is helping me refine things, and watching the DVD makes me want to get on the mat.  It's also valuable to see how many ways there are to sequence your practice and make it your own.And Shiva Rea is absolutely beautiful, which is not at all necessary but certainly doesn't hurt.I think you'll find this DVD a wonderful tool.",5,Inspiring and instructive,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1667,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'have', 'David', 'Swenson', 'superb', 'DVD', 'First', 'Series', 'Ashtanga', 'Richard', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'third', 'bought', 'strength', 'reviews', 'here', 'more', 'money.Rea', 'teaching', 'grounded', 'Ashtanga/vinyasa', 'style', 'yoga', 'poses', 'are', 'linked', 'most', 'part', 'series', 'repeated', 'connecting', 'movements', 'derived', 'sun', 'salutation', 'Rea', 'variations', 'sun', 'salutation', 'four', 'complete', 'practice', 'sessions', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'DVD', 'really', 'brilliant', 'feature', 'Yoga', 'Matrix', 'build', 'own', 'practice', 'session', 'click', 'different', 'poses', 'sequences', 'one-by-one', 'create', 'own', 'session', 'can', 'change', 'time.Watching', 'Rea', 'do', 'poses', 'inspiring', 'enormous', 'clarity', 'vitality', 'paraphrase', 'Yogi', 'Berra', 'can', 'learn', 'lot', 'watching', 'fairly', 'sparse', 'verbal', 'instructions', 'pose', 'probably', 'details', 'are', 'best', 'learned', 'one-on-one', 'instruction', 'Still', 'have', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'hatha', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'hard', 'learn', 'solely', 'DVD', 'be', 'aimed', 'people', 'knowledge', 'fundamental', 'poses', 'sun', 'salutation.The', 'DVD', 'improved', 'practice', 'Watching', 'true', 'master', 'helping', 'refine', 'things', 'watching', 'DVD', 'want', 'get', 'mat', 'also', 'valuable', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'sequence', 'practice', 'make', 'own.And', 'Shiva', 'Rea', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'not', 'necessary', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'hurt.I', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'tool']",N/A

I too am new to yoga, and became addicted after two classes at my health club.  I would make this recommendation to all beginners: take some ""real-time"" classes at your local fitness center in addition to purchasing this and other yoga DVDs.  Those will be extremely challenging, and will quickly get you up-to-speed for anything this DVD sends your way.  THEN: to practice at home, purchase this DVD, and also some by Yoga Zone DVD, Rodney Yee, or Yoga Journal for a good mix of vinyasas and teaching styles.  Yoga Zone and Yoga Journal DVDs are great for detailed instructions and background information on the various poses, and some of the routines are shorter when time is limited.  Save this DVD for when you have a nice amount of time, and are mentally up to a more challenging, independent work out.  There is nothing here that you CAN'T do!  Eventually, you may even find that you prefer Shiva Rea's less ""cluttered""  approach, as she really emphasizes the breathing and meditation aspects of yoga, and less talking and instruction helps create the space necessary for that.I agree: the matrix that allows you to cuztomize your practice is an excellent feature.  I also agree that Shiva Rea assumes you have a fair amount of yoga knowledge, but if you've done the Inversions section in Lunar Flow, she gives instructions for beginners who want to modify the poses -- and there are other places on the DVD where she helps you modify the poses.  In the DVD notes she also explains that she has purposely excluded inversions that she feels really require the presence of an instructor to be done safely and correctly.  Over all, this is an extremely thorough DVD, one I find myself returning to again and again.

Now, it's one of my favorites.  I do a lot of intense cardio and heavy weight training, so adding Vinyasa yoga to my program has really increased my flexibility and lowered my stress levels.Vinyasa yoga is defined as flow yoga and focuses on breathing and movement.  It is suitable for all levels.What I loved about this DVD:**the breathtaking scenery of the Maldive Islands and Southern India. The gentle sounds of the waves are especially relaxing.**the sitar music gives the DVD a true yoga feel.  The indoor scenes look like they were filmed in some sort of Indian temple. For me, this is very appealing and part of the whole yoga experience.  This may be too much for some folks, who prefer their yoga to be more of a stretch routine.**Shiva's voice is very calming.  I feel relaxed just listening to her.**the preset practices give you good variety.  I love doing the beginner flow when I'm tired and want to do a little something.  Both Solar Flows are about 90 minutes long, so I save these for when I have lots of time.  The Lunar Flow is perfect for an end of day workout.**the matrix option allows you to build your own workouts.  Since I don't do this DVD very often, I can't remember the details of each section, so I find it hard to build a workout. I tend to use the preset routines. Some of the section times are not accurate, so it's hard to judge how long your workout will be.Some things to be mindful of on this DVD:**there are some advanced poses, like handstands and bakasana(advanced crow), which should not be attempted unless you are very strong and have done yoga for a while. Shiva does emphasize you should do what feels right for your body, but sometimes it's hard not to want to mimic her exactly.**sometimes Shiva does mirror cuing and sometimes she doesn't and this can be a bit confusing.  It used to bother me at first, but now I focus on the movements and don't worry whether I'm on the correct side.  I just make sure I do both sides.I highly recommend this DVD for anyone wanting a comprehensive Vinyasa yoga practice.

Shiva Rea follows a 'vinyasa yoga' style emphasizing the conscious mixing of paced breathing with movement through the asanas. It is a step up in speed from many of the AM/ PM, Yoga Zone, Gaiam style DVDs, but not quite as speedy as the Power Yoga ones. What sets this DVD apart is: (1) Shiva's instruction - the asana flows are smooth and she does the moves properly without talking - a voice over recording guides you precisely through the flows reminding you exactly when to breathe (2) There are many levels and choices - The DVD comes with 4 set 'classes' - a beginner's, an intermediate, intermediate/ advanced, and a night time class but the best is the ""matrix"" option where you can mix and match all the flows and meditations from all the classes and create your own workout (3) High production value - the asanas are always shot in the center of the screen, you can always see exactly how the asanas should be performed, there is only Shiva doing the flows - not a whole class of people which can be distracting, the DVD doesn't look as though it was shot with a video camera, and it was shot on location at the beach in India not a studio. (4) You can grow and develop with this one DVD - Since you have 4 classes and the 'matrix' you have a huge amount of options, the vinyasas go from basic to very advanced (with quite a few headstands and sick backbends - if you want to add them to your routine) - this is a set you can keep for a while and use and not toss out when you out grow it.

Wonderful unobtrusive backing music that greatly enhances the practices. Shiva covers all of the aspects I have needed to know, but had not found on her other DVDs, rather like a final puzzle piece that finally enabled me to see the full picture of Vinyasa yoga, and really experience the joy of such from this deeper knowing and understanding. Shiva also discusses about postures that lead up to the next pose and so forth, and the importance of the preparation in this manner.The first DVD of the Vinyasa Flow Practices two DVD set is divided up as follows: -Basic FlowSolar Flow 1Solar Flow 2Lunar FlowBASIC FLOWSurya Meditation. A movement meditation, combining mantras with meditative yogic movement. Filmed on a beach, offering a tranquil feeling to quieten the self, and backed by beautiful Indian music.Classic Sun Salutation. Shiva offers some alternative postures for beginners, during the classical sun salutation sequence. Shiva's tuition is, as always, spiritual and physical in synchronized flow for mind body integration within and without: - inner and outer.Standing Flow - basic flow. Wonderful ranges of postures are included in this section, allowing great strengthening stretches to work the entire body. Shiva shares the purpose of each posture and explains how to position yourself into each posture. Encouragement is offered continuously to keep you focused at all times, and additionally reminders to align your breath-work in time with each posture sequence.Back bend - flow basic. Great postures for lengthening the spine.Supine pose. Commences with some gentle twists. I absolutely love the side twists and the invigorating effect they have on my spinal column. Shiva's deep alignment to the heart of yoga creates the space for you to gently commence embodying this space in your own yoga practice. Reclining pigeon is next...another stimulating pose to move into deep levels of profoundly affecting your physicality. Shiva's teaching includes every aspect of what needs paying attention to during each pose, so you do not have to worry if you are practicing correctly.Shavasana. A time for deep relaxation. The sounds of the ocean waves coupled with Shiva Rea's relaxing guidance will likely surely allow you to feel the deep relaxation as I did. This is my favourite Shavasana out of the many Shiva Rea has recorded across many DVDs. I was relaxed in such a short time, and so, so deeply. Duration 42 minutes.Solar Flow 1: - includesSolar Meditation & Pranayama, surya namaskar a & b, dancing warrior 1 & 4, ha kriya, core abs, standing pose flow 1, shoulder openers, handstand, backbend flow 1 & 3, supine poses and shavasana. Duration 1 hour 23 minutes.Solar Flow 2: - includesSolar Meditation, rhythmic vinyasa 1 & 2, dancing warrior 2 & 3, standing backbend prep, standing pose flow 2, lunge preparation, backbend flow 2 & 3, supine poses, inversions, and shavasana. Duration 1 hour 25 minutesLunar Flow: - includesLunar meditation, prana yoga, moon salutations, forward bends & twists, inversions, pranayama, meditation, shavasana. Duration 1 hour 13 minutes.The second DVD of Special Features, and is divided up as follows: -The Creators - includes written content and music samples.Extra Shakti & Pranams - video and written content.Interview with Shiva - Shiva discusses the organic cycles of life and how this applies to your yogic practice. I found the advice on starting with a lunar practice if you need centering before commencing your practice. She discusses about the flow from expansive movements to contractive movements. Shiva explains all about counter poses, which I had heard mentioned so many times in her other DVDs, but was not sure if I had understood this fully, and so receiving this confirmation has led to increased confidence in my yogic practice. She talks about how the poses flow with purpose and also what occurs within each movement e.g. the opening up during a back bend. Shiva talks about drawing upon the receptive quality that allows us to feel the forces of gravity, and the power of our breath to sustain us. Also about feeling harmony wherever you are within your yoga practice, even if it is very strong, or completely relaxed and tranquil, that it has its own harmony and perfection with who you are.Techniques of Vinyasa Flow Yoga - includes video content: -Introduction to ujayi breathing - a short but helpful explanation.Bandhas within Vinyasa - The Bandhas are very important in yoga practice, so it is very useful to gain as much understanding of such as possible. This is the first time I have seen such explained slowly enough to practice with perfection.Underlying foot patterns - very useful for grounding each of the poses, and well worth studying!Four movements of Lunge - learn the correct posture alignment for the lunge.Alignment of the pelvis with gravityAll content within the above sections is explained very clearly and precisely, which has allowed far greater understanding of Yoga than before.Yoga Shakti music and artists - written & music contentYogadventures - written and photographic contentLocations - written and photographic

It's filmed on a beach in Bali, sunsets and ocean waves are part of the experience -- very soothing and inspiring, especially in the winter. To me, it's been a nice mental getaway, since I've been stuck in the cold grey weather.Shiva Rea is a wonderful teacher. She takes her time explaining each move, if you have the instructional soundtrack on. Later, as you progress, you can turn it off for a more meditative practice. She has a second DVD that contains more detailed instructions on common moves and transitions. She helps you refine your movements to get the most out of them, it's like having a personal instructor on hand -- very helpful!The DVD is divided into 4 different full routines, including a beginner routine and a menu to select  segments from each. I take full advantage of this a la carte menu and found it's the perfect way to get all of the stretching I need each time. It allows me to vary my routine and focus on different aspects of my practice.This is the first of DVD's from Shiva Rea that I've tried. I was pleasantly surprised by her style, professionalism, soothing voice and the high quality of the film work.

After over 4 years of using yoga dvds, I thikn I am an advanced beginner, can do some bound & revolved poses w/ease, but none fast w/control & I still had trouble keeping up with her pace & have given up, though do hope to one day be able to do it.

The Yoga Matrix, consisting of the 30 individual components that make up the larger programs, allows you to create your own sequences.  Thus, you can emphasize backbends, focus on standing poses, or just do forward bends if that is your preference.  That is the beauty of this dvd--the variety of practice it offers.  The range includes opening meditations, sun and moon salutations, dancing warrior variations, standing pose options, backbends, ha kriya, core work, supine poses, forward bends, shoulder openers, lunges, meditation, inversions, and handstands.  You will find energizing sequences and relaxing ones, challenging asanas, and options for working up to them.  Times for each component are listed in the accompanying booklet.  There is something for everyone in this dvd.Shiva Rea leads you through the practice on a sandy strip by the ocean, with the waves and sky behind her.  Her flexibility allows her to demonstrate the full expression and beauty of each pose.  Her narration is soothing and well-timed, while the music choices fit the mood of each sequence.

She must have studied a lifetime to accomplish such a great and rewarding yoga practice for herself. However...for me...this was not a great tool for learning or doing the poses with her. I prefer the yoga zone workout with Alan Finger. The programable feature of Shiva's dvd took over an hour to program because you have to watch each sequence to see what it is ...figure out the time it takes for each sequence then put it all together. That basically puts you into tommorrow for your workout. Even the easy stuff was advanced and I can't see a beginner buying this and trying it without getting frustrated. I do not care for the programable dvd's. There were positive things about the workout. I liked seeing things that you don't usually see on other dvd's. This is for a REALLY advanced student that has studied with an instructor. I didn't feel like I could just pop this in and start moving. The preprogramed sequences were full of downward facing dog and sun salutations (which I dislike). I have never been able to take that back leg up between my hands at the speed of light and it is awkward for me to do. A few of those are ok, but when a workout relies on this as the main posture it looses me right there. I rate this a 3 because I was expecting so much more.

The Basic Flow and Lunar Flow are for people with less experience (or less flexibility, stamina, or strength), and the other two programs include things like arm balances and inversions that most beginners won't be able to do for a long, long time.  That said, I've had this dvd for maybe a year or so, and the two simpler sequences have kept me happily occupied ever since.Even if you can't follow the advanced poses, this DVD is worth buying just so you can watch the beautiful scenery.Soon I'm going to buy Paul Grilley's Yin Yoga DVD, which is a DVD of poses held for much longer lengths of time.

This DVD is almost perfect.  There is a yoga matrix where you can pick segments that you want to do.  I especially love the Prana Yoga segment which is almost like a ""yoga dance"" class.  The rhythmic vinyasas are great also!  I did however notice that there is a problem on the matrix in accessing rhythmic vinyasa 2.  The matrix does not list them separtely (1 & 2) and when you select the vinyasa, you only get rhythmic vinyasa 1.  To get to ""2"" you need to go to Lunar Flow 2 and 'next' thru the segments to get to it.  I am not sure whether I just happened to get a faulty DVD or if this is a flaw of the early release DVD's which will be fixed in later issues. Anyway, it's not a real biggy.  The DVD also has some great arm balances that you never see on yoga video tapes.  The great thing is that she does them in stages so that  you can work up to it.  The abs section is great and you can see that she was influenced by Ana Forrest. There are also breathing (alternate nostril, kabalabati and ha kriya)and meditation sections.  Shiva did a great job at giving the home practitioner a complete menu of yoga appetizers to choose from.
