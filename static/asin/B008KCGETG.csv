1569046,A1W78K4E5A8PDS,B008KCGETG,DigitalPaperCut,"[0, 0]","This story of wants vs needs moves quick and is spellbinding like none I remember in a very long while.  Dialogue is lean with nary a wasted word.  Not one second wasted on vanity or pretentious posing here.  Entirely and quietly shot in a simple diner, the story, actors and tension fill the screen to bursting.  Xander Berkeley leads this film and I simply cannot look away when he's full-frame and working that cool, understated magic of his.  Is he evil or is he good in The Booth?  Is he god, the devil or merely mortal?  The man is a delicious mystery.I had no idea this was a Hulu series project until another reviewer mentioned it.  With this kind of exceptional storytelling, I truly thought The Booth at the End was a feature film.  To see husband and wife team Xander Berkley and Sarah Clarke (widely known as deadly Nina in 24) working together was an extra special treat.Hulu makes me ad-sad to the point of being worse than network television, but I've already signed up to grab every episode of The Booth at the End on Amazon.",5,WOW.,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",2014,1041,"['story', 'vs', 'needs', 'moves', 'quick', 'spellbinding', 'none', 'remember', 'very', 'long', 'Dialogue', 'lean', 'nary', 'wasted', 'word', 'Not', 'one', 'second', 'wasted', 'vanity', 'pretentious', 'posing', 'here', 'Entirely', 'quietly', 'shot', 'simple', 'diner', 'story', 'actors', 'tension', 'fill', 'screen', 'bursting', 'Xander', 'Berkeley', 'film', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'when', 'full-frame', 'working', 'cool', 'understated', 'magic', 'evil', 'good', 'Booth', 'god', 'devil', 'merely', 'mortal', 'man', 'delicious', 'mystery.I', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'Hulu', 'series', 'project', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'kind', 'exceptional', 'storytelling', 'truly', 'thought', 'Booth', 'End', 'was', 'feature', 'film', 'see', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Xander', 'Berkley', 'Sarah', 'Clarke', 'widely', 'known', 'deadly', 'Nina', '24', 'working', 'together', 'was', 'extra', 'special', 'treat.Hulu', 'ad-sad', 'point', 'being', 'worse', 'network', 'television', ""'ve"", 'already', 'signed', 'up', 'grab', 'episode', 'Booth', 'End', 'Amazon']",N/A
1569047,A1QTCOP4K6MQUI,B008KCGETG,L. Collins,"[3, 3]","When this first came out and was just an online web-series I was intrigued, but for one reason or another I never got around to watching it. So, when I ran across it just a few days ago I eagerly rented it and I have to say it didn't disappoint. &#34;The Booth at the End&#34; is a quiet, introspective and eerily compelling story of humanity's failings, the need for things that we can't have and the price we pay for having those &#34;wishes&#34; fulfilled.What I liked about this was it completely set in a small little diner booth, there are no electrifying action scenes or over-the-top CGI... instead the story revolves around a creepy man in the booth at the end who will fulfill your wish for a price... you've just got to be willing to pay for it. The story is engaging, evocative, quiet like a dull roar but filled with telling silences, features a main character that just begs you to delve deeper into his story and a cast of supporting characters that really provide an authentic and relatable story for the viewer.When I finished this it left me eager for more and made me annoyed that I had waited so long to watch it.

1569050,A2ON7U9BIRLQWD,B008KCGETG,"M. Ennis ""yaicha""","[10, 10]","The Booth at the End is a made-for-Hulu series about a mysterious gentleman with a mysterious book. The book allows  him to tell you what actions you must do to achieve a desired result. The entire series takes place in the booth at the end of a diner. It is all just dialogue between the people who come seeking something and the man who tells them what they must do to get what they want. It is an honest look at what it means to desire, to love, to hate, and what it is to be human. Brilliantly done. No car chases, no explosions, just the question- ""is this what you really want, what you really need, and how far are you willing to go to get it?"" I wish this was on a DVD that would play in the US. It can been seen on Hulu. And it's well worth the price of subscribing to Hulu ($8/month) to watch it. If anyone ever comes across a US formatted DVD, please let me know.
