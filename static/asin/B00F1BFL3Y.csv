Many historical pictures of the interior and spectacular exterior were included and details of the buildings design were revealed. A step back in time to when the idea of shopping for 'pleasure' and the ability to 'browse' merchandise before purchase were developed by Harry Selfridge. Some photos of the real Harry Selfridge were included and his personal life was touched on but  this production barely mentioned his wife and family and personal details of their lives as well. It was mainly a look at the past and present store and how shopping has been changed by Harry Selfridge's innovative ideas. If you want more biographical information about the man and his family you will have to read the book, I guess!",4,Interesting History of Selfridges Department Store,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,813,"['enjoyed', 'version', 'famous', 'Selfridges', 'watching', 'seasons', ""'Mr"", 'Selfridge', 'Many', 'historical', 'pictures', 'interior', 'spectacular', 'exterior', 'were', 'included', 'details', 'buildings', 'design', 'were', 'revealed', 'step', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'idea', 'shopping', ""'pleasure"", 'ability', ""'browse"", 'merchandise', 'purchase', 'were', 'developed', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'photos', 'real', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'were', 'included', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'touched', 'production', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'wife', 'family', 'personal', 'details', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'mainly', 'look', 'past', 'present', 'store', 'how', 'shopping', 'been', 'changed', 'Harry', 'Selfridge', 'innovative', 'ideas', 'want', 'more', 'biographical', 'information', 'man', 'family', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'guess']",Secrets of Selfridges

The imagery is spectacular, showing scenes of early and current Selfridges. Good mix of expert interviews, but not so much that they dominate this documentary. It really is like an insider&#8217;s behind the scenes tour.

1669983,A30DHPWGVRCELQ,B00F1BFL3Y,Girl Friday Reader,"[19, 19]","As a fan of the period drama, Mr. Selfridge, I was excited to see PBS schedule a documentary about the real-life London department store and the real story of Harry Gordon Selfridge. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Selfridge and his eponymous store proved to be even more larger than life and more lavish--and more scandalous--than Piven and his fellow cast members. Though Selfridge brought American-style salesmanship to England, there still existed that touch of Englishness that set the store apart from its American counterparts. I now wish some American production company would do a documentary on the history of Macy's, Wanamaker's, or Marshall Fields--or maybe Selfridge's rival, Woolworth's!",4,Fun and informative!,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,710,"['fan', 'period', 'drama', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'PBS', 'schedule', 'documentary', 'real-life', 'London', 'department', 'store', 'real', 'story', 'Harry', 'Gordon', 'Selfridge', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Selfridge', 'eponymous', 'store', 'proved', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'larger', 'life', 'more', 'lavish', 'more', 'scandalous', 'Piven', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'Selfridge', 'brought', 'American-style', 'salesmanship', 'England', 'still', 'existed', 'touch', 'Englishness', 'set', 'store', 'apart', 'American', 'counterparts', 'now', 'wish', 'American', 'production', 'company', 'would', 'do', 'documentary', 'history', 'Macy', 'Wanamaker', 'Marshall', 'Fields', 'maybe', 'Selfridge', 'rival', 'Woolworth']",Secrets of Selfridges

This is excellent background on the genesis of it.  The founder is a larger than life character.  For as astute as he was about business, it's amazing he wasn't more sensible about his private life.  His gambling and excessive lifestyle doesn't quite fit with his business savvy.  Enjoyed the footage from the time period in which Selfridge lived and how the shop looked then.  One of the more striking facts about Selfridges is that women weren't allowed out unescorted until Selfridges came along as it gave them a place to go which was safe with women's bathrooms.  There weren't public bathrooms in England for women until this store opened. Thoroughly enjoyed the history behind the man and his store.  4.5 stars",5,Informative & Fascinating,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,825,"['Enjoyed', 'watching', 'history', 'Selfridges', 'am', 'fan', 'PBS', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Selfridge', 'store', 'excellent', 'background', 'genesis', 'founder', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'as', 'astute', 'was', 'about', 'business', 'amazing', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'sensible', 'private', 'life', 'gambling', 'excessive', 'lifestyle', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'business', 'savvy', 'Enjoyed', 'footage', 'time', 'period', 'Selfridge', 'lived', 'how', 'shop', 'looked', 'then', 'One', 'more', 'striking', 'facts', 'Selfridges', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'out', 'unescorted', 'Selfridges', 'came', 'along', 'gave', 'place', 'go', 'was', 'safe', 'women', 'bathrooms', 'were', ""n't"", 'public', 'bathrooms', 'England', 'women', 'store', 'opened', 'Thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'history', 'man', 'store', '4.5', 'stars']",Secrets of Selfridges
