But the animation has one thing that most cartoons today lack.  that being true artwork.  The show is done in beautiful watercolors that make the show worth watching.  Similar to journey to the center of the Eart or Fantastic Voyage (CMDF) the animation is wholesome and smooth.The plot developes with each episode.  Unlike cartoons of the eighties, which were single episodes that did not build on each other, this show does.  It is similar to B-5 in the way each episode builds and influences each other.The writting is not dumbed down and all in all this is a good show fit for both adults and kids.

The way the apes referred to the people as humanoids instead of humans like in the movies was one.  The only other complaint is that the animation was a little slow.  However, the art, especially the backgrounds, were fantastic.  The stories were very good as well.  I think that the music was underrated as well.  It was very effective in establishing an eerie mood to the show.  I wish that this show would have at least made it to a second season.  I would have liked to see where the writers were going.

970855,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B000E991A2,Dave Cordes,"[71, 73]","The short-lived 13 episode animated Saturday morning cartoon revisited the Planet of the Apes but was a departure from the primitive landscape of the successful film franchise and live-action television series.  Without the constraints of expensive live-action production, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which animated the classic Pink Panther cartoons, had the freedom to illustrate the lavish technologically advanced simian world as conceptualized by Pierre Boulle in his original novel La Plan&egrave;te des Singes.  On this planet, Ape City has all of the modern luxuries and conveniences of 20th century human civilization as astronauts Jeff Allen, Bill Hudson and Judy Franklin discover when they travel to the year 3979 and encounter an upside-down world ruled by a sophisticated society of talking apes and humans have lost the power of speech and live in exile in caverns.  They meet familiar characters Nova, Cornelius, Zira, Doctor Zaius and General Urko (provided by the recognizeable cartoon voice of Fred Flintstone) and references are made to astronauts Taylor and Brent from the films. Beyond the boundaries of Ape City exists the hostile desert no-man's (or ape's) land of the Forbidden Zone and a monastic order of telepathic humans known as the Underdwellers led by Kraydor who live beneath the surface.  Judy is taken captive by the Underdwellers after falling through a fissure from an earthquake where she is venerated as USA (pronounced Oosa) implying her metaphorical resemblance to Lady Liberty and the prophecy that she will help them restore the green planet that has been taken over by the militant apes.Originally included as part of the expensive Ultimate Planet of the Apes collector's Ape Head set, Return to the Planet of the Apes is finally being released separately.  The transfers on those DVDs from their original 16mm film prints were very dirty with excessive gate weave throughout and with mono 2.0 sound but they have now been remastered and restored exclusively for their individual DVD release.Here is the breakdown of all 13 24-minute episodes on 2 discs:""Flames of Doom"" - Jeff, Bill and Judy travel through space and time and arrive on a strange planet that appears to be ruled by humans. As Bill is captured for study and Judy falls into a crack in the ground opened during an earthquake, Jeff is left alone to search for help but finds that the humans he meets are no more than primitive cavemen.""Escape from Ape City"" - With Bill under study in Ape City, Jeff takes refuge with Nova and the other humans in the desert caves but are forced to leave when General Urko launches an attack against them. With the help of Cornelius and Zira, Bill escapes and goes in search of Jeff.""The Unearthly Prophecy"" - With Urko advancing into the desert in search of them, Jeff and Bill are forced underground looking for help from the Underdwellers, a race of telepathic humans, but find a surprise waiting for them - Judy is alive!""Tunnel of Fear"" - Bill and Jeff sneak back into Ape City under cover of darkness to ask Cornelius and Zira for help. Avoiding Urko's troops and a giant mutant spider, they listen as Cornelius tells them about New Valley, a place where they'll be safe from Urko. But can they get the humans there in time?""Lagoon of Peril"" - To prove the existence of the talking humans, Urko demands that Zaius accompany him out to where Bill and Jeff's spaceship landed. With Cornelius warning them of this, Bill, Jeff and Nova set out to destroy their craft but something awaits them in the waters of the lagoon!""Terror on Ice Mountain"" - Within an ancient ruin, Cornelius finds an ancient book, A Day At The Zoo but he realises that such subversive literature could prove dangerous. So he and Bill set off for the mountains where a holy sect is rumoured to live, who could protect the book until the time is right to announce its discovery.""River of Flames"" - Kraydor and Judy contact Bill and Jeff asking for their help. The volcano over which the Underdwellers live is threatening to erupt and the lava is almost upon their reactor. Should the reactor fail, the entire planet is doomed. Bill and Jeff must reroute the lava before it is too late!""Screaming Wings"" - Bill, Jeff and Judy are on their way to the human settlements when they see human shapes in the desert! Are there really humans there or are they targets for Urko's new weapon - a WWII fighter plane?""Trail to the Unknown"" - With rafts to help move the humans on once more, this time to a lush green valley where they'll be left alone, Bill, Jeff and Judy find not only a wrecked spaceship but also its pilot, Ron Brent!""Attack from the Clouds"" - One night in Ape City, there's panic as a giant flying lizard attacks. Believing that the humans are behind this, Urko and his troops set off to capture both the lizard and those responsible for it. But Jeff, Judy and Bill have no knowledge of this creature until, that is, it attacks them!""Mission of Mercy"" - When Nova falls ill, Bill, Jeff and Judy realise that her only hope is that they contact Cornelius for a serum that will cure her. But with little aviation fuel left for the plane they stole from Urko, Bill and Jeff set out by road. Will they get the serum in time?""Invasion of the Underdwellers"" - Burglars are striking all over Ape City and there's a panic when reports come of it being the fault of the human Underdwellers. Judy contacts Kraydor, who denies responsibility, so she, Jeff and Bill set out to prove that the burglars are really Urko's troops, looking for support in one last great strike against the humans.""Battle of the Titans"" - After his framing of the Underdwellers, Urko has been relieved of duty and opinion in the Simian Council is swinging back towards the scientists. Cornelius believes that it is now time to present A Day At The Zoo and sets out with Bill to retrieve it. But the giant flying lizard is not finished with them yet!",4,Animated Apes is a return to Boulle's Planet,1155254400,"08 11, 2006",2006,5936,"['short-lived', '13', 'episode', 'animated', 'Saturday',

970864,A4GB8I8ACS4PM,B000E991A2,"Kevin Pepper ""JedeyeNite""","[2, 2]","Being an Ape fan from my childhood, I purchased the ultimate collection when it first came out.  I was pleased to go back and watch all the films, the TV series and the animated series.  The audio/video quality of the animated series in the Ultimate Collection was really lacking.  There was hardly any color palette, other than oranges and browns, and it was botched by tons of dust, scratches, and artifacts.  The sound was muddled mono track with pops and hisses.  After years of holding out, I finally broke down and took a chance on double dipping on the remastered animated series.  I popped in the original from the Ultimate Collection, just so I could have a fresh image by which to compare and contrast.  The newer release loads with the same menu design, so no real differences yet.  Once I pushed play on episode one, IMMEDIATELY, my mouth fell open as the differences were glaring right before me.  Colors and details that were not visible in the Ultimate Collection were now presented to my wondering eyes.  I couldn't believe how crisp and clear the images were.  I popped in the old one again just to see it, and was dumbfounded at the stark differences between the two version.  You can now see every brush stroke and pencil line in the animated cells,  Contrast that with the original where everything was blurry and there seemed as if someone had overlaid the whole image with a dark filter.  The audio is still mono, but it too has been cleaned up.  There are still a few examples of some specks here and there, but this is the absolute best I've ever seen this.  Another annoying aspect of the original release was that the whole screen seemed unstable, as it would wiggle and shake.  This is especially noticeable in the opening titles.  That has been corrected, and now you have a stable image without the annoying jiggling.  Fox is truly to be commended for doing such a great job at cleaning up this series that is a fond memory from my childhood.  Of course, since we only had a black and white TV at the time, it is truly a treat to see this series in all its colorful glory.  If you have the Ultimate Collection, you owe it to yourself to spend a little money and get this newly remastered edition.

I loved all the films, minus the second which was just decent and my least favorite. The TV series was excellent but lacked any resolve in the end for the viewers, and the remake was OK but could have been much darker and better than the Marky Mark stuff that was put out lol. This cartoon reminded me most of the television show, where the team has to accomplish a new mission each episode and jump a hurdle so to speak. I see the issues of the animation being kind of weird or sloppy or re-used. However what do you expect from a 35 year old cartoon series? I will however say that the way the camera moves to show dramatic effect on the cartoons is pretty cool and I have never seen a cartoon filmed in that manner before. It brings a dramatic feel and has some techniques used that they normally do only during live action films, so I enjoyed that. The characters were good and interesting yet lacked certain emotion when they spoke on occasion. The time line also doesn't add up to the other films/show but I try not to nit pick things too badly when we are talking about time warping and apes ruling the world =)If you love classic cartoons or the apes movies this will be up your alley. If you like anime or fast action then I would most likely tell you not to buy this. On a side note there really isn't an ending, just like the TV series. The last episode doesn't tie up what happens to the team and any of the characters. I enjoyed it being a fan of the movies and such, and would recommend it for the person who wants all the apes DVDs, or just likes old school stuff.",4,Good old cartoons,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",2010,1719,"['was', ""n't"", 'alive', 'Planet', 'apes', 'boom', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'universe', 'father', 'showed', 'kid', 'loved', 'films', 'second', 'was', 'just', 'decent', 'least', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'excellent', 'lacked', 'resolve', 'end', 'viewers', 'remake', 'was', 'OK', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'darker', 'better', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'stuff', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'lol', 'cartoon', 'reminded', 'most', 'television', 'show', 'where', 'team', 'accomplish', 'new', 'mission', 'episode', 'jump', 'hurdle', 'so', 'speak', 'see', 'issues', 'animation', 'being', 'kind', 'weird', 'sloppy', 're-used', 'However', 'what', 'do', 'expect', '35', 'year', 'old', 'cartoon', 'series', 'will', 'however', 'say', 'way', 'camera', 'show', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'cartoons', 'pretty', 'cool', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'cartoon', 'filmed', 'manner', 'dramatic', 'feel', 'techniques', 'used', 'normally', 'do', 'only', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'interesting', 'yet', 'lacked', 'certain', 'emotion', 'when', 'spoke', 'occasion', 'time', 'line', 'also', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'other', 'films/show', 'try', 'not', 'nit', 'pick', 'things', 'too', 'badly', 'when', 'are', 'talking', 'time', 'warping', 'apes', 'ruling', 'world', '=', 'love', 'classic', 'cartoons', 'apes', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'alley', 'like', 'anime', 'fast', 'action', 'then', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'tell', 'not', 'buy', 'side', 'note', 'really', ""n't"", 'ending', 'just', 'TV', 'series', 'last', 'episode', ""n't"", 'tie', 'up', 'what', 'team', 'characters', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'fan', 'movies', 'such', 'would', 'recommend', 'person', 'who', 'apes', 'DVDs', 'just', 'likes', 'old', 'school', 'stuff']",Return to the Planet of the Apes - The Complete Animated Series

The TV series was gold, the original movie was a masterpiece but I already owned those and didn't want to chance this short lived series at such a huge cost. Thankfully my waiting (for once) paid off! Though I am only 2 episodes into this I just had to give my 2 bits.+ The use of color and shading I can already see is a 5/5. The look and feel of the show practically has a feature presentation quality to it. Light and shadow are almost as fun to watch in this series as the stories! At first I was a bit unsure of the Apes having newer technology, but for the most part it works. Another area that is GOLD is the sound. I think I would buy this soundtrack seperately it is THAT GOOD!! The sound totally molds the aura of the visual artistic vision and makes it whole, major props given here. The 2 episodes I have seen are quite vivid and the transfers are excellent.- I took off a star mainly because the dialogue is a bit too stilted. I realize this is from '75 but even still the speech patterns seem to be caught in a slow motion where every word is annuciated almost painfully. The voice for Urko doesn't really fit the character, it sounds more like Fred Flinstone from the Fruity Pebble commercials. I  suppose the only other drawback is the lack of any sort of ""extras"". No history of the show, no nothing!In closing; just looking at the wonderful box art, disc art, and price tag is practically reason enough to own this, let alone the artistic value I feel this brought to the franchise, sadly, like the live action TV show it ended far too soon.
