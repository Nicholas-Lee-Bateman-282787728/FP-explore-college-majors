But instead shifts wildly into different directions; black ghetto melodrama, Vietnam experiences and heist flick, in  that order. The characters are also one-dimensional and unlikable. Main  faults are jarring shifts in tone and severe miscasting in vital roles,  primarily the 'Vietnam cast' and Chris Tucker is wrong for the role, he  can't play serious and his comic touch sometimes lowers the dramatic  impact.

180643,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,1558908390,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","The Hughes Brothers' Dead Presidents provides an interesting take on the American experience following the Vietnam war. While many directors have worked with this time period(Hal Ashby, Oliver Stone) this is the first film that deals with the issue from the standpoint of the returning black veteran.Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate)tries to be a good citizen. He graduates from a Bronx high school and feeling that he is not ready for collge joins the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam where he is a member of a special Recon platoon. After serving his counrty he returns to his old neighborhood to find everything that he believed in has changed. Struggling to get by he plans with some friends an armored car robbery.The film is one of the most powerful that I have seen dealing with the return of veterans in a long time. What we get is a universal story not just a black one and the Hughes Brothers are to be commended for this. The film is a period piece and evokes the time in question quite well. If there is a flaw with this film it is that the ending seems a little contrived. The robbery did not have to happen to make this film enjoyable. It was put on simply so that the film could be labeled as an action film. Action sells better than dramas about characters obviously.The disc I viewed was a rather bare bones affair. This is a film that should be rereleased in a better edition on the order of the Hughes Brothers From Hell release.

With a richer, more insightful script, this could have been a canonical story - an African-American equivalent of Chinua Achebe's novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;.

But by failing to smoothly integrate them into the narrative, they become mere set-pieces - like big dance numbers in a musical. The most telling example of this comes when one person pops up and begins blazing away with an automatic pistol in each hand. Sure, it's a nice visual kick but it instantly makes the character into a cartoon. (As any firearms expert will tell you, *no one* can accurately fire two guns at once.)

It sorta got billed as a high-action robbery film and, in fact, there was a high-action robbery within it. However, the film was much, much more. I'd say it was a very good period piece covering the Viet Nam decade. It involved a group of young Bronx people who were caught up in getting drafted and sent off to a war they knew little about and cared even less about. Anthony Curtis assumed the lead position. Brace yourself for the war scenes! They're grim, graphic and gruesome. Very well done, but hard to watch.After the war, Curtis returned to the Bronx to find the neighborhood and political scene greatly changed and the only job he could get was as an apprentice butcher to support his wife and new daughter. Then the shop closed down, through no fault of his, and he drifted into crime, including the robbery of an armored truck that turned into an all-out disaster.It's an excellent movie. I enjoyed it very much. However, it seemed like something that was somehow just patched together and it didn't fit particularly well. The robbery was well done and could have been made into a movie in itself. The Viet Nam fighting was well done. The musical score was well done. However the whole thing just didn't fit together very well. The acting was quite good. The filming was quite good.

180664,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,1558908390,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 7]","The Hughes brothers certainly had the right idea in mind making this a cool heist, and I give them credit for trying, but they bite off more than they can chew. Dead Presidents is a really good film. Most people think this movie is all about robbing a bank but it really isn't even though it comes at the end.The most obvious problem is the film tries to be too many things at once. It starts as a ghetto drama-then it's a war movie-then it ends as a crime thriller! (More than a bit reminiscent of Kubrick's ""The Killing."") This could have worked with the proper care, but DP suffers from trying to cram too much story in just under two hours. An extra twenty minutes would properly flesh out the plot. The film opens in the late sixties as we meet Anthony (Larenz Tate), Anthony's girl Juanita (Rose Jackson), his friend Skip (Chris Tucker-as bug-eyed as ever) and boss Kirby (Keith David). We follow Anthony through his first experiences with sex, violence, and family resistance. Anthony wants to join the Marines and through a rather clever edit, we are plunged into the Vietnam War head first. The Hughes Bros. handle this material well, although it gets a bit busy with all the Vietnam-isms: drug use, severed heads, mercy killings, Agent Orange, air strikes, etc. The audience discovers that before the war Anthony got Juanita pregnant, and that he has a baby girl ""back in the world."" It is a lot of material to cover in the brief period of time, and we only get a brief glimpse of what is was like to be a black soldier in country.We jump back to the ""world"", where we witness the domestic turmoil the war has brought upon Anthony and Juanita. Another pitfall is the Juanita character, who is so abrasive that we feel no sympathy towards her. The scene where Anthony assaults her is problematic; I mean what did she expect waging the verbal attack that she does on an alcoholic Vietnam Vet? The confrontation with Cutty (Clifton Powell), Juantia's sugar daddy, is contrived and goes on far too long. Broke and alone, Anthony, in his moral confusion, turns to the film's equivalent of the Black Panther Party for support...This is where `Dead Presidents' abandons the drama for the above mentioned heist aspects. Ignoring the pragmatic problems with the robbery (i.e. face paint instead of masks), it is a rather poor way to resolve a film where so much time has been expended creating complex characters. One does not get the sense that Anthony is desperate enough to do something that goes so much against his character. The other members of the heist have not been properly set up to take part in it either. It seems tacked on, almost an afterthought to the plot proper. Anyway the heist does not go as planned; everything leading to the final shot of `Dead Presidents' seems anticlimactic, leaving many questions unanswered.One of the major flaws of the film is the lead performance by Larenz Tate; he is a good actor, but does not seem dynamic enough to bring Anthony through a narrative arc that gets lost in the clouds. The editing leaves scenes unfinished and cold. The story: If the Hughes Bros. had focused on one or two aspects of the plot, we would have been presented with a more thoughtful and detailed story. I'll give them credit for being ambitious though, but experienced film makers also know what to cut from a film when everything seems like a good idea. But that is a skill that comes with time.",4,"3.5--""People out of work everywhere and the government just be throwing money away!""...",1157587200,"09 7, 2006",2006,3426,"['Hughes', 'brothers', 'certainly', 'had', 'right', 'idea', 'mind', 'making', 'cool', 'heist', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'bite', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'Most', 'people', 'think', 'movie', 'robbing', 'bank', 'really', ""n't"", 'even', 'end.The', 'most', 'obvious', 'problem', 'film', 'tries', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'once', 'ghetto', 'drama-then', 'war', 'movie-then', 'crime', 'thriller', 'More', 'bit', 'reminiscent', 'Kubrick', 'Killing', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'proper', 'care', 'DP', 'suffers', 'trying', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'extra', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'would', 'properly', 'flesh', 'out', 'plot', 'film', 'late', 'sixties', 'meet', 'Anthony', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Anthony', 'girl', 'Juanita', 'Rose', 'Jackson', 'friend', 'Skip', 'Chris', 'Tucker-as', 'bug-eyed', 'ever', 'Kirby', 'Keith', 'David', 'follow', 'Anthony', 'first', 'experiences', 'sex', 'violence', 'family', 'resistance', 'Anthony', 'join', 'Marines', 'rather', 'clever', 'edit', 'are', 'plunged', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'head', 'first', 'Hughes', 'Bros.', 'handle', 'material', 'well', 'bit', 'busy', 'Vietnam-isms', 'drug', 'use', 'severed', 'heads', 'mercy', 'killings', 'Agent', 'Orange', 'air', 'strikes', 'etc', 'audience', 'discovers', 'war', 'Anthony', 'got', 'Juanita', 'pregnant', 'baby', 'girl', 'back', 'world', 'lot', 'material', 'cover', 'brief', 'period', 'time', 'only', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'black', 'soldier', 'country.We', 'jump', 'back', 'world', 'where', 'witness', 'domestic', 'turmoil', 'war', 'brought', 'Anthony', 'Juanita', 'pitfall', 'Juanita', 'character', 'who', 'so', 'abrasive', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'scene', 'where', 'Anthony', 'problematic', 'mean', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'waging', 'verbal', 'attack', 'alcoholic', 'Vietnam', 'Vet', 'confrontation', 'Cutty', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Juantia', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'contrived', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'Broke', 'alone', 'Anthony', 'moral', 'confusion', 'film', 'equivalent', 'Black', 'Panther', 'Party', 'support', 'where', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'abandons', 'drama', 'above', 'mentioned', 'heist', 'aspects', 'Ignoring', 'pragmatic', 'problems', 'robbery', 'i.e', 'face', 'paint', 'instead', 'masks', 'rather', 'poor', 'way', 'resolve', 'film', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'been', 'expended', 'creating', 'complex', 'characters', 'One', 'not', 'get', 'sense', 'Anthony', 'desperate', 'enough', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'other', 'members', 'heist', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'properly', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'part', 'tacked', 'almost', 'afterthought', 'plot', 'proper', 'Anyway', 'heist', 'not', 'go', 'planned', 'everything', 'leading', 'final', 'shot', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'anticlimactic', 'leaving', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered.One', 'major', 'flaws', 'film', 'lead', 'performance', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'seem', 'dynamic', 'enough', 'bring', 'Anthony', 'narrative', 'arc', 'lost', 'clouds', 'editing', 'leaves', 'scenes', 'unfinished', 'cold', 'story', 'Hughes', 'Bros.', 'had', 'focused', 'one', 'two', 'aspects', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'more', 'thoughtful', 'detailed', 'story', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'being', 'ambitious', 'experienced', 'film', 'makers', 'also', 'know', 'what', 'cut', 'film', 'when', 'everything', 'good', 'idea', 'skill', 'time']",N/A

I saw it in October of 2001, and I wanted to see a little action that might takemy mind off the news lately (boy, did I get a wrong number there) and be at least mildly entertained.SPOILERS AHEAD, WARNING!Yeah, they definitely mis-marketed this-- it is not a 'heist' movie, or a simple 'action' movie. There is a heist, but only the last half hour of the film (and it's a 2 hour film) is spent on it. It starts out in the late 60's-- I was thinking please God, let this not just be a short prologue and have the whole movie take place in the 60's and 70's, and I got my wish. Tate's character hangs out with his friends, wants to have fun and get laid, and go to Vietnam and 'make a difference' since a local poolhall owner and his father are both vets, he looks up to them. The first 1/3 or so takes place in 1969, shows what a dangerous but fun lifestyle (not to mention, great music and great wardrobe) Tate's character is living it up with his friends (including Chris Tucker, who has more depth than I thought; too bad he's now typecast as the Streetwise Guy who fast-talks his way out of trouble). By the first 15 minutes, I was glad the movie was mis-marketed, because I was enjoying the kind of coming-of-age story and characters. The next 45 minutes or so--there's a great transition talked about in the other reviews, switching from Tate's character (sorry, blanked on the name!) sprinting over fences and backyards after he almost gets caught with his pants down, to him literally dodging bullets in Nam-- are spent showing his tour of duty in Vietnam.Things get ugly there, I mean really gory and disturbing- BIG switch in tone. I feel like all the most gruesome, disturbing moments and scenes from hours of Nam movies were all crammed together, and the 45 minutes or so in this movie still tops them. Do NOT eat while watching this.Just skip the whole segment if you are easily disturbed. All the violence and nightmarish scenes are not just for the sake of being violent, they are essential to the plot, and I'm not complaining (though something tells me I'm in for some really bad dreams tonight) but I was totally unprepared. I'm surprised Fangoria didn't do a story about all the splatter effects. There's twice as much gore as all 3 'Scream' movies put together. We're talking heads chopped off with machetes, said heads carried around by insane soldier as a 'souvenier' (As he was shoving the head into his pack with difficulty, I was thinking that if he was going to start taking souveniers, he should pick a much smaller body part if he wants to get a collection of souveniers going) keeping it around until said head is rotting with maggots, people being blown into smithereens, body parts all over the place, characters with their guts strewn everywhere but still alive, people's genitals chopped off and shoved in their mouths, and this is all **on-camera** and in daylight-- really, really graphic. Tate manages to get through this without developing a serious drug habit or going insane (not an easy task). He comes home after a 4 year tour of duty, so the last third takes place in 1973. He goes back to the old neightborhood to find some unpleasant surprises-- not the least of which is money problems, so that's when he and his surviving buddies- who are not in the greatest mental or financial shape themselves-- start to work out the heist.The movie got the message through without hitting me over the head-- black men fighting a white man's war, coming home and finding things much worse, little respect. The character understandably ends up joining a revoluntionary group. I guess I was dissapointed when he decided his only option was to pull a very ill-advised heist (hmmmm, at least one of the guys in on it hasa serious drug habit, a few of them don't get along, another has totally lost it and just wants to blow up things and people just for the hell of it, could this possibly have a happy ending?) but considering all the atrocious, hideous experiences in Nam (he has very graphic and disturbing nightmares and flashbacks) then coming back to all the depressing [stuff] that he does, I guess I don't blame him for having bad judgement or doing something desperate.Not a cheerful movie. But grim as it was, I was very impressed, especially considering how young the directors were-- they pay homage to other directors but don't rip them off. It is too bad the studios didn't market it to be more of the themes of war, struggle, and survival the movie really focuses on. I'm pretty sure that the Hughs wanted to market it that way, but the racist studio heads took it out of their hands and figured that all audiences expected to see a black cast doing was shooting and robbing people, so they geared it towards that. Too bad, the movie deserves a better campaign and a wider audience.(A note on the DVD-not much in the way of extras:no commentary, deleted scenes, production notes. I think there might have been a trailer, but that was about it. But if you're looking for this DVD to be packed with specal features, you won't find them here.)",4,Got a little more than I bargained for here...,1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,5168,"['rented',

180680,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,1558908390,Mr. Cairene,"[2, 4]","Dead Presidents is a bizzare amalgamation of three different movies. One part Goodfellas when you consider Anthony(Larenze Tate) as the young blood joining the local boss Kirby's racket, running numbers for him and gaining  his respect. Another part The Deer Hunter, where young friends go to war  and comeback with emtional and physical scars. In the last half hour the  movie resembles Micheal Mann's Heat with an exciting no hold barred bloody  heist. Unfortunatly it is never as good as any of these three (all Five  star stuff) but it does have an in your face violent intensity that its  impossible to not get caught up in it.  The first and last quarters of  this film work best. As the film starts Anthony a wide eyed young man is  running numbers for the local gang man Kirby. He refuses to go to college  like his brother and considers joining the marines, he falls in love with a  girl called Wanita, and hangs around with his friends. One of them is Chris  Tucker whose only ambition in life is to become a pimp. At this juncture  the film is a slice of life New York tale and it works wonderfully. Once  they get to Vietnam the film unneccesarily turns into a gorefest and  wallows in stylish excces. Back home things get ugly as Anthony now poor,  has to fight off a local hood interested in Wanita. The film throws around  all sorts of ideas, the veteran ignored by his country, the rise of  socialism in America, drug addiction, alcoholism and we're not caught up in  any of it because its all an excuse to set up stylish scenes that are  burrowed from other movies. The entire mid-section of the film is a  complete fake, with non of the realism that populate Spike Lee's or Martin  Scorceses's films. Towards the end however the excitement of the hiest  pulls us back into the movie with sheer adrenaline. Our attraction to the  heist represents the appeal of this film which is the action, violence,  style(the gangs painted faces look great) and a flood of half baked  political commentary.",3,Gangster/War/Hiest Film with the volume turned up to Eleven,954979200,"04 6, 2000",2000,2010,"['Dead', 'Presidents', 'bizzare', 'amalgamation', 'three', 'different', 'movies', 'One', 'part', 'Goodfellas', 'when', 'consider', 'Anthony', 'Larenze', 'Tate', 'young', 'blood', 'joining', 'local', 'boss', 'Kirby', 'racket', 'running', 'numbers', 'gaining', 'respect', 'part', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'where', 'young', 'friends', 'go', 'war', 'comeback', 'emtional', 'physical', 'scars', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'Micheal', 'Mann', 'Heat', 'exciting', 'hold', 'barred', 'bloody', 'heist', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'three', 'Five', 'star', 'stuff', 'have', 'face', 'violent', 'intensity', 'impossible', 'not', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'first', 'last', 'quarters', 'film', 'work', 'best', 'film', 'Anthony', 'wide', 'eyed', 'young', 'man', 'running', 'numbers', 'local', 'gang', 'man', 'Kirby', 'go', 'college', 'brother', 'considers', 'joining', 'marines', 'love', 'girl', 'called', 'Wanita', 'hangs', 'friends', 'One', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'only', 'ambition', 'life', 'become', 'pimp', 'juncture', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'tale', 'wonderfully', 'get', 'Vietnam', 'film', 'unneccesarily', 'gorefest', 'wallows', 'stylish', 'excces', 'Back', 'home', 'things', 'get', 'ugly', 'Anthony', 'now', 'poor', 'fight', 'off', 'local', 'hood', 'interested', 'Wanita', 'film', 'sorts', 'ideas', 'veteran', 'ignored', 'country', 'rise', 'socialism', 'America', 'drug', 'addiction', 'alcoholism', ""'re"", 'not', 'caught', 'up', 'excuse', 'set', 'up', 'stylish', 'scenes', 'are', 'burrowed', 'other', 'movies', 'entire', 'mid-section', 'film', 'complete', 'fake', 'non', 'realism', 'populate', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'Martin', 'Scorceses', 'films', 'end', 'however', 'excitement', 'hiest', 'pulls', 'back', 'movie', 'sheer', 'adrenaline', 'attraction', 'heist', 'appeal', 'film', 'action', 'violence', 'style', 'gangs', 'painted', 'look', 'great', 'flood', 'half', 'baked', 'political', 'commentary']",N/A

This was the predicament the Hughes brothers faced after releasing 1993's stunning _Menace II Society_. My guess is they wanted to get away  from what they were doing while still preserving the Highes style that made  _Menace_ such a fantastic film, so they decided to do a flick about Black  Americans' involvement in Vietnam, and its fallout. (Does anyone remember  if this was based on a true story? I seem to recall hearing that...)More than anything, Dead Presidents suffered from awful marketing.  Everyone flocked to the film expecting the whole thing to be about a bank  heist, and instead they were treated to the story of Anthony Curtis (Larenz  Tate, the actor who made O-Dog so memorable in _Menace_) and two of his  high school friends in the late sixties. Fully three-quarters of this movie  is setup, if you go in thinking it's about the bank heist, and I can see  why a lot of people ended up panning this. However, if you realize it's a  story about one person growing up, coming of age in the middle of the  jungle, and his attempted reintegration into society, it suddenly gets a  whole lot better. Add an ensemble cast worthy of many praises (including a  young, hip, and very funny Chris Tucker as Curtis' best friend, N'Bushe  Wright as his sister-in-law, and the brilliant Keith David as Kirby, the  guy who originally gets Curtis involved in crime while still in high  school), and it becomes an absorbing, painful meditation on life during  wartime.There are still some bad things about Dead Presidents, the  main one being that the Hughes Brothers didn't go anywhere near far enough  away from Menace to make this into a film with its own separate identity;  in some cases, they might have been using the same sets, the same props,  and the same dialogue. If you've never seen Menace, it probably comes off  just as fresh and original as it did there, but those who compare the two  (and saw them in order of release) will probably end up finding Menace the  better film. One also wonders if the Hughes brothers didn't use the Vietnam  footage as an excuse for some extra gratuitous violence; the more Vietnam  war films we get, the more brutal the footage becomes.

180684,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,1558908390,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 2]","Larenz Tate plays Anthony Curtis.  In the 1960's, he ships off to Vietnam full of idealism, only to return to ""The World"" as a bleery eyed and completely discouraged vet.  He's seen man's-inhumanity et al., and now finds himself jobless and surrounded by need.  He's not really looking for a piece of the supposed American dream, as much as he is looking for some food for the hungry mouths of his family.  Hooking up with a group that includes some friends, some more ambitious types, and some white-boy revolutionaries who know a thing or two about explosives, Curtis is embroiled in a hijacking of an armored car loaded with ""Dead Presidents"" - the Presidents being Jackson and Grant, with a few Franklins tossed on top.  It's no surprise that nothing goes right (why change Curtis's luck when his bad fortunes are more entertaining?)  The Hughes Brothers sketch their elaborate explosions to the tune of late 60's funk but are never ruled by the sound - it's uplifting but never forgetful of their inevitable doom.  (If the Hughes' ""Menace II Society"" was an answer to ""Boys in the Hood"", then ""Dead"" is like a ""Soul Train"" come-back to the 1950's gospel of Spike Lee's movies.)  Like a slow-motion car-wreck, you know what's coming but can't tear yourself away.  I love the cinematography of bleak, post-Vietnam NY, where it's always winter, and cops in their 1970's uniforms and six-guns blaze away like each one think's he's the last man standing.  Tate's character is maybe the only hole in this movie - he goes from being wide-eyed to dead-eyed, but never seems to connect with the violence that brings him down.  Instead, the flick relies on Kieth David (Platoon) as Kirby, and Chris Tucker (that's right, Chris Tucker) as a junkie on his way out - a role that seems more poignant now.",4,Dark AND Funky,1039132800,"12 6, 2002",2002,1795,"['Larenz', 'Tate', 'Anthony', 'Curtis', '1960', 'Vietnam', 'full', 'idealism', 'only', 'return', 'World', 'bleery', 'eyed', 'completely', 'discouraged', 'vet', 'seen', ""man's-inhumanity"", 'et', 'al.', 'now', 'jobless', 'surrounded', 'need', 'not', 'really', 'looking', 'piece', 'supposed', 'American', 'dream', 'as', 'much', 'looking', 'food', 'hungry', 'mouths', 'family', 'Hooking', 'up', 'group', 'friends', 'more', 'ambitious', 'types', 'white-boy', 'revolutionaries', 'who', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'explosives', 'Curtis', 'embroiled', 'hijacking', 'armored', 'car', 'loaded', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'Presidents', 'being', 'Jackson', 'Grant', 'few', 'Franklins', 'tossed', 'top', 'surprise', 'nothing', 'right', 'why', 'change', 'Curtis', 'luck', 'when', 'bad', 'fortunes', 'are', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'sketch', 'elaborate', 'explosions', 'tune', 'late', '60', 'funk', 'are', 'never', 'ruled', 'sound', 'uplifting', 'never', 'forgetful', 'inevitable', 'doom', 'Hughes', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'was', 'answer', 'Boys', 'Hood', 'then', 'Dead', 'Soul', 'Train', 'come-back', '1950', 'gospel', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'movies', 'slow-motion', 'car-wreck', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tear', 'away', 'love', 'cinematography', 'bleak', 'post-Vietnam', 'NY', 'where', 'always', 'winter', 'cops', '1970', 'uniforms', 'six-guns', 'blaze', 'away', 'one', 'think', 'last', 'man', 'standing', 'Tate', 'character', 'maybe', 'only', 'hole', 'movie', 'being', 'wide-eyed', 'dead-eyed', 'never', 'connect', 'violence', 'down', 'Instead', 'flick', 'relies', 'Kieth', 'David', 'Platoon', 'Kirby', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'right', 'Chris', 'Tucker', 'junkie', 'way', 'role', 'more', 'poignant', 'now']",N/A

I've bought ""bare bone"" DVDs before, so I'm not saying don't buy this DVD because there aren't extras on it. For me, it's just that having a video tape of the movie with at least the video on it, then buying a DVD (in essence, an upgrade) without the video or any other extras is crazy.The Hughes Brothers' Dead Presidents was one of the cooler films from 1995. After the success of their debut movie Menace II Society from 1993, I remember wondering (with anticipation) how the Hughes would follow-up with their next film. Then the trailers starting running, showing the cast and choice scenes with the menacing makeup, backed by a soundtrack featuring a collection of soul classics. Incidently, the Dead Presidents soundtrack took on a life of its own as well, proving so successful a second volume was released. The movie itself is just too cool for words. The Brothers have a style unto themselves, though they admit to prominent influences as inspiration. You have to give it up to their choice cast as well - Larenz Tate (Menace II Society) , Chris Tucker (Friday), Freddy Rodriguez (Six Feet Under), N'Bushe Wright (Blade), Keith David (The Thing), Bokeem Woodbine (Caught Up), Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez (187), and several other familiars.Most people will credit Chris Tucker more because he provides the ""in your face"" funny-funny, but Larenz Tate owns this film. Tate, who I equate with other great actor Don Cheadle, turns out another great performance with the greatest of ease and likeability. Even when he pistol-whips a bank guard, Tate makes you feel for his character even if you don't exactly agree with his choices and actions because you know what motivated the action. The best thing about a Hughes Brothers movie is there is never a boring moment. The plot, direction and performances will hold your attention while the music, set design, threads, and conscienceness will have you waxing nostalgia...or bombarding your parents with a curious interest depending on where you're at in age.

Anthony then plans a doomed heist with his former war buddies including the heroin addicted Skip, played by the electrifying and hilarious Tucker, pool hall owner and big time hustler named Kirby, played by David, and priest, played by Woodbine.What makes Presidents an extraordinary film is its depiction of black life before, during, and after the Vietnam war, and how they (the black veterans) got it worse than their peers, and a remarkable screenplay.

He brings a deep intensity to just about any role he plays. ""Dead Presidents"" is just more proof of that and this film probably shows the best performance of Tate's career.In this film, he's Anthony, an idealistic young high school graduate from the Bronx who enlists in the Marine Corps in the late 1960s and is shipped off to serve in Vietnam. Along with a couple of his high school buddies, he witnesses horrific violence and death there like he's never seen, comes back home after his tour of duty ends and finds it hard to adjust to civilian life. He finds that after serving his country, his country has very little to offer him in return. This was a dilemma faced by many young men coming home from Vietnam, and one that was even harder on black men like Anthony. He has no job, no money, and begins looking for other ways to support himself. Eventually he finds a job, but it is barely enough to pay the bills. He also has to deal with jealous guys from the neighborhood who envy him for various reasons.Having a young daughter to support and a shady pregnant girlfriend who was his high school sweetheart (Rose Jackson Moye), the financial pressures begin to mount in Anthony's life. As things begin to crumble around him, he then begins to have thoughts of resorting to breaking the law in order to try set things right in his life, and hatches a plan to pull off this high-stakes heist. He enlists his willing friends, who are also looking to get rich quick, in his plot. However, the reprecussions of this plot are deadly.The Hughes Brothers (""Menace II Society"", ""From Hell"") have done a knockout job with this well-written, well-directed film with the Vietnam War as a backdrop and how it affected young black men in its aftermath. But I feel the main point of it was that even the most positive, upstanding and law-abiding person can resort to doing something unthinkable if they are desperate and they are pushed far enough. In that aspect, anyone can relate to this film. Along with Larenz's performance, Keith David, Chris Tucker (who shows he has REAL acting chops in this film - his performance is unforgettable), Bokeem Woodbine and Freddy Rodriquez as Anthony's buddies pull out all the stops to create nothing short of a realistic and dramatic experience for the viewer.

From reading the plot and the movie review quotes on the DVD, I assume this was some action-packed film, in the vein of something like Heat. According to the DVD, ""The Film Never Slows"", and its ""Explosively exciting"", and it's ""Wild Action!"". Not only that, the plot talks about a daring heist done by a Vietnam vet and his friends. Sounds interesting enough, right? Well not only is this daring heist not even mentioned until the last half of the film, it doesn't take place until the last 20 minutes or so. Its only a small portion of what the film is about. Simply put, this film is a drama, not an action film and not a heist movie. It follows the story of one central character, and events that eventually lead up to him putting together a heist. In no way, is the heist the main plot point of the film. And apart from a few war scenes and the heist itself, there's not a lot of action. I'm not saying its a boring movie or that it isn't good.

180697,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,1558908390,Tristan,"[2, 4]","Dead Presidents details the traumatic life of a young New York Vietnam war veteran. Anthony(Larenz Tate) is a high school student in the 60s with a girlfriend, Juanita(Rose Jackson) and a decent job at the billiard hall. In 1971, he and his friends Skip(Chris Tucker) and Jose(Freddy Rodriguez) decide to join the army and go fight in the Vietnam war. They all end up completely traumatized by their horrific experiences. When Anthony returns in 1973, his girlfriend has had his child. He finds tremendous difficulty adjusting to life after his time in combat. His home situation is damaged beyond repair. His nightmares keep him from sleeping. He is unable to afford to live and his girlfriend resorts to sleeping around in order to pay the bills and pay for food. Eventually, Anthony finds that his friends are not shaping up well either. Skip has become a heroin junkie from taking drugs in the war. Jose is a crippled pyromaniac. He also crosses paths with Juanita's sister Delilah who has had a crush on Anthony since high school. Anthony, Delilah, Skip, Jose, and a couple other people he befriended during the war eventually devise an elaborate plan to rob an armored car filled with money designated to go to the Federal Reserve Bank. Their lives get more horrific.Dead Presidents is my favorite film by the Hughes Brothers and one of my favorite films of the 90s. It is a brutally realistic, moving, ambitious, and absorbing piece about war psychosis, desperation, and coming-of-age. This film doesn't create a world so much as it completely represents life and the feelings of growing up in a world where you know so many people. Dead Presidents is a film that does too many things right. The film is only two hours, and yet it has enough plot and character development to fill a novel. It will feel much longer than two hours, but that's not a bad thing. It only feels that way because it manages to touch on a lot of different things. The early scenes in the film take place when the character is in high school, and those scenes have so much honesty and life to them that it's incredible. Characters pass by the main character and he only vaguely knows them, but he knows them. Anthony has sex with his girlfriend Juanita in one scene, and the sex scene is handled with incredible realism. The Hughes brothers capture the awkward and nervous feelings and situations of sex without coming off uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable for the characters, no question, but not so much for the audience. The film shows the horrendous situations of war. Characters go completely insane and we witness the entire process. We see the young soldiers grow obsessed with death. These are scary people, but their insanity makes sense. We see characters get shot, blown up, and have their bones broken. All have extremely gory results with torrents of blood spray, and yet it never once seems cartoonish or comic, and instead it's very shocking.When Anthony returns from war, the horror we felt during the war scenes never goes away. The environment and the people around him feel explosive and unpredictable. Juanita is just as scary as the soldiers faces during the combat scenes. The nightmares that Anthony has are just about the most horrible nightmares anyone could ever have. We see severed heads, arms, legs, guts, bowels, broken bones, and geysers of blood shoot all over the face of Anthony. It's like Jacob's Ladder all over again. I get chills just thinking about those scenes. Then we see characters show up that appeared earlier in the film suddenly show up again after disappearing from the middle portion of the film. It is so true-to-life. The aspects of the thought of seeing people and then never seeing them and then seeing them years later is pitch-perfect here. The film manages to move so well with these details by having each scene that follows the next be so directly crucial to the entire film that we as the audience are really able to get into Anthony's world. The final act of the film, I will not reveal. I will only say that it is beautifully ironic and surprising in the direction it goes in. Don't expect the film to play fair.The film has a couple minor problems. The problems I have mostly have to do with the war scenes. The scenes work due to the actors and the characters they portray. The characters create the environment. The actual atmosphere of the scene is not conveyed at all through the surroundings of the characters, however, and the scenes set in the Vietnamese towns and woods are the weakest parts of the film because they feel far too contained. It felt overly claustrophobic to the point where it drew a little more attention to itself then it needed to. The surrounding environment came off lowly. My second minor gripe with the film has to do with the lack of character development for Juanita's sister Delilah. She's the only character that doesn't get enough screen time, and I found her character's actions to come off a bit excessive and a little too surprising in it's sudden leap of logic that it bugged me. Most people, when they watch the film, likely won't notice, but for me I'm anal about things like that. These two issues aside, however, the film does far too many things right to let these things bring it down.Still, the film is tremendous. Dead Presidents has some terrific performances. I despise the acting of Chris Tucker, but here he does a perfect job and manages to do a lot with the character. I actually could understand his emotional gut reaction to the war. He conveys a lot in those scenes through his character and I was very impressed. Larenz Tate, Keith David, Bokeem Woodbine, and Freddy Rodriguez all do equally impressive jobs. The one performance I was the most blown away by, however, was Clifton Powell. He only has a handful of scenes in the film, but his short amount screen time is absolutely incredible. His character gets just the right amount development, and Powell manages to convey so much in brief, subtle, and short emotions. It's an incredible performance of a nasty character that I couldn't help but appreciate all too much. The soundtrack featuring music by Marvin Gaye and Danny Elfman is outstanding and easily ranks among one of the best soundtracks to a war film I've seen. The look of the film is dark, gritty, and alive. The film is full of so much life and so much realism and so much darkness, and I highly recommend Dead Presidents to anyone and everyone, whether they are a fan of Urban Drama, War films, Period Pieces, or if they just want to see a good story told. This is a great film, and the Hughes Brothers have crafted their masterpiece. Dead Presidents aims for the gut, and that's more than I can say for most war films.",4,It hits you like a sledgehammer to the jaw.,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,6740,"['Dead', 'Presidents',

ANd its best actor Larenz Tate comes back to star in the Hughes' second film ""Dead Presidents"". In ""Menace"" Tate was spectacular as the 16 year-old trigger-happy killer O-Dog. In ""Presidents"" he portrays Anthony a plain young black kid who decides to go to Vietnam to become a man. THis film is basically the Hughes' interpretation of the black experience in and after Vietnam. We watch Anthony go to war and become a disciplined and efficient soldier who keeps his mind far away from home just to stay alive. When he comes back to the Bronx he finds that society has moved on without him. His girlfriend has had their daughter and Anthony finds her living in a roach-infested apartment and being supported by a pimp. Anthony is forced to take a low-paying job as a buthcer since he can't find anything else. But Anthony is frustrated by his lack of opportunities. Then some of his war buddies get together and cook up a scheme to rob a bank. The heist is a bloody encounter that leaves two of Anthony's friends dead. And when Anthony tries to escape with the money he is captured and put away...""Dead Presidents"" is a well-executed movie, well directed and beautifully acted. Tate in my opinion should be a HUGE star by now. He has incredible charisma and he just makes you care about any character that he portrays. Also, Chris Tucker and Bookeem Woodbine(as two of Anthony's Vietnam buddies) add some solid support to the cast.

Broughton, JR","[2, 2]","After reading some of the reviews for this film, I must say that some people seem to be a little too technical - sometimes over-looking the fact that it's a movie (and a good one, mind you).  Some films may not get every technical aspect right, but, who cares as long as you're into the story.  DEAD PRESIDENTS is an overall good movie.  This is a film where you'll really see the acting talent of Chris Tucker (who's usually in a birage of comedy films).  Larenz Tate, as always, is great.  Bokeem Woodbine is also excellent, although, I barely recognized him with the receding hairline and glasses.  N'bushe Wright as the revolutionary is also great as well as great-looking (if you know what I mean).  I can understand why they would rob an armored vehicle to get some easy cash.  I don't agree with it, but, I understand.  That, to me, is one of the points this film is trying to make and it, as far as I'm concerned, delivers.  These characters are going through financial troubles.  Some have responsibilities to take care of while others may have certain addictions that they feel they must ""fix"".  I don't agree with it, but, I understand.  The Hughes brothers do an excellent job with the plot, scripting, and direction.

Thank goodness I own ""Dead Prez"" and after all these years it still stands the test of time.  The thing that makes this film good is the story and the 5* acting.  Every actor in this film is in my oppinion, brilliant.  The guy from ""Hustle and Flow"" has a small part in this, I knew he was good from the get, it's nice to see him getting bigger roles.  This and ""Set It Off"" have got to be the best homie movies out there right now, in my oppinion.  Dead Prez gives bank robbery a heart if that makes any sense.  This is not a mindless action flick.  It's  intellectual, political, and deep.  And it's all set to a killer soundtrack.",5,Get Rich or Die tryin'............,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,738,"['rented', '4', 'Brothers', 'did', 'NOT', 'ENJOY', 'so', 'fiasco', 'wanted', 'see', 'REAL', 'homie', 'movie', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'own', 'Dead', 'Prez', 'years', 'still', 'test', 'time', 'thing', 'film', 'good', 'story', '5*', 'acting', 'actor', 'film', 'oppinion', 'brilliant', 'guy', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'small', 'part', 'knew', 'was', 'good', 'get', 'nice', 'see', 'getting', 'bigger', 'roles', 'Set', 'Off', 'have', 'got', 'be', 'best', 'homie', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'oppinion', 'Dead', 'Prez', 'bank', 'robbery', 'heart', 'sense', 'not', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'intellectual', 'political', 'deep', 'set', 'killer', 'soundtrack']",N/A
