350082,ANTQ2TREXI7HO,6303000827,"Derohn Thomas ""Rohnny V""","[0, 0]","I took a chance on buying this movie despite the bad grade on IMDb. Horror movies in general are a gamble, their either a waste or great. Demon Wind is a true gem in my eyes because it's everything I love. It's about a man trying to find out about how his grandparents died so he goes to revisit their house, his friends come along as well. When one wants to leave, a strange force brings them back to the house, it's the force of the DEMON WIND pushing them back. The only way they can escape is buy killing the source but it's not what they expect.My favorite part of the movie is when the karate dude was showcasing his amazing abilities, by kicking a can in the air then into his other friends face. I though that was extremely random. Also when demons pop up everywhere and two dudes go all guns a blaze on them. The movie has terrible acting though it makes up for it with it's interesting premise. I wish they made a sequel or remake of this, it's the bomb.",5,Demon Wind..it'll blow you away,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,964,"['took', 'chance', 'buying', 'movie', 'bad', 'grade', 'IMDb', 'Horror', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'gamble', 'waste', 'great', 'Demon', 'Wind', 'true', 'gem', 'eyes', 'everything', 'love', 'man', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'grandparents', 'died', 'so', 'revisit', 'house', 'friends', 'come', 'along', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'one', 'leave', 'strange', 'force', 'back', 'house', 'force', 'DEMON', 'WIND', 'pushing', 'back', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'escape', 'buy', 'killing', 'source', 'not', 'what', 'expect.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'karate', 'dude', 'was', 'showcasing', 'amazing', 'abilities', 'kicking', 'can', 'air', 'then', 'other', 'friends', 'face', 'was', 'extremely', 'random', 'Also', 'when', 'demons', 'pop', 'up', 'everywhere', 'two', 'dudes', 'go', 'guns', 'blaze', 'movie', 'terrible', 'acting', 'up', 'interesting', 'premise', 'wish', 'made', 'sequel', 'remake', 'bomb']",Demon Wind VHS
350083,A3MYQT1X9QWDEU,6303000827,Francis DeMarco,"[3, 5]","This film to me was one of those ""Almost"" films. Almost, but no cigar. Not much thought in the storyline, and the acting was somewhat weak. To myself, it was like an Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and a touch of Friday the 13th, ripoff. Friday the 13th, meaning at the begining of this film, with the old man, Harcourt, telling them not to go there, to stay away if they know what's good for them, etc. But then again, there are quite a few movies that do that.  The movie starts with this couple in a farmhouse in the year 1931. She's praying and whatnot, while candles burn in the house, as well as in the center of a pentagram, while demons are screaming,""you can't keep us out"". It seems that this farmhouse is some gateway to hell, and grandma has some spell that keeps them at bay. Until this night. They seemed to have possessed her husband, and all hell breaks loose. Then we skip to present day.So, here we have a young man, his girlfriend, and a couple of car-loads of their friends, in the middle of nowhere, in search of a rural farmhouse, where the lead man, Cory's grandparents had suffered a horrible fate, almost 60 yrs. ago.It seems Cory is determined to find out what or whom killed them.(pretty stupid reason wanting to find out after all these years, but hey, it's a movie) When they find the farmhouse, a couple of the girls, mainly Molly, feels some bad vibes there.Cory, determined to find out what happened to the grandparents, does not really care about the bad vibes, and decides to investigate inside the house.There, what was left of it, is everything in place the same night his grandparents were murdered. (even the beautifully cooked turkey, that still looks like it just came out of the oven, I'd like to know where you can buy a turkey like that, that stays that good sitting around for 60 yrs.) Practically all the stuff in there looked brand new. It must have been some great weather conditions to keep all that stuff looking like that. Could'nt the makers of this movie at least thrown some dirt on stuff to look like it's been sitting around for years? Anyway, strange things start happening. These 3 little girl ghosts, demons, or whatever they are, appear and takes one of the girls.So, they deceide it's time to leave, but the cars will not start. They decide to walk, but then a mysterious fog keeps coming while they are walking, and takes them right back to the farmhouse.Seems there is no escape, and they systematically start getting bumped off. After being killed, they come back as ""DEMONS"", and go after the living that remain, at the farmhouse. (Kind of sounds like Evil Dead to me). This movie, I think, could have been alot better, if there was more gore, and made a little more sense.The acting was typical b-rated I guess. About as corny as you're gonna get. There's some decent one-liners, some slimy, gorey effects, but just not enough. The make-up was pretty impressive though. That I did like.All in all though, the movie was not that great. Nothing new presented here. Like I said earlier, you can definetly see that they relied heavily on copying Evil Dead. Personally, I would skip this one, and go buy Evil Dead if you haven't seen it yet.The only reason I gave this 3 stars was for the great make-up, and special effects. Otherwise, i can't say I enjoyed it. I bought it after reading the reviews on here about it.It sounded pretty good, but I was pretty dissatisfied overall.",3,Could Have Been Better,1042416000,"01 13, 2003",2003,3444,"['film', 'was', 'one', 'Almost', 'films', 'Almost', 'cigar', 'Not', 'much', 'thought', 'storyline', 'acting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'was', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'touch', 'Friday', '13th', 'ripoff', 'Friday', '13th', 'meaning', 'begining', 'film', 'old', 'man', 'Harcourt', 'telling', 'not', 'go', 'there', 'stay', 'away', 'know', 'what', 'good', 'etc', 'then', 'again', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'do', 'movie', 'couple', 'farmhouse', 'year', '1931', 'praying', 'whatnot', 'candles', 'burn', 'house', 'as', 'well', 'center', 'pentagram', 'demons', 'are', 'screaming', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'out', 'farmhouse', 'gateway', 'hell', 'grandma', 'spell', 'bay', 'night', 'seemed', 'have', 'possessed', 'husband', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Then', 'skip', 'present', 'day.So', 'here', 'have', 'young', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'couple', 'car-loads', 'friends', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'search', 'rural', 'farmhouse', 'where', 'lead', 'man', 'Cory', 'grandparents', 'had', 'suffered', 'horrible', 'fate', 'almost', '60', 'yrs', 'ago.It', 'Cory', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'whom', 'killed', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'reason', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'years', 'hey', 'movie', 'When', 'find', 'farmhouse', 'couple', 'girls', 'mainly', 'Molly', 'bad', 'vibes', 'there.Cory', 'determined', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'grandparents', 'not', 'really', 'care', 'bad', 'vibes', 'decides', 'investigate', 'house.There', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'everything', 'place', 'same', 'night', 'grandparents', 'were', 'murdered', 'even', 'beautifully', 'cooked', 'turkey', 'still', 'just', 'came', 'oven', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'where', 'can', 'buy', 'turkey', 'good', 'sitting', '60', 'yrs', 'Practically', 'stuff', 'looked', 'brand', 'new', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'weather', 'conditions', 'keep', 'stuff', 'looking', ""Could'nt"", 'makers', 'movie', 'least', 'thrown', 'dirt', 'stuff', 'look', 'been', 'sitting', 'years', 'Anyway', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', '3', 'little', 'girl', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'are', 'appear', 'one', 'girls.So', 'deceide', 'time', 'leave', 'cars', 'will', 'not', 'start', 'decide', 'walk', 'then', 'mysterious', 'fog', 'keeps', 'coming', 'are', 'walking', 'right', 'back', 'farmhouse.Seems', 'escape', 'systematically', 'start', 'getting', 'bumped', 'off', 'being', 'killed', 'come', 'back', 'DEMONS', 'go', 'living', 'remain', 'farmhouse', 'Kind', 'sounds', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'movie', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'better', 'was', 'more', 'gore', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'sense.The', 'acting', 'was', 'typical', 'b-rated', 'guess', 'as', 'corny', ""'re"", 'gon', 'get', 'decent', 'one-liners', 'slimy', 'gorey', 'effects', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'make-up', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'did', 'like.All', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'Nothing', 'new', 'presented', 'here', 'said', 'earlier', 'can', 'definetly', 'see', 'relied', 'heavily', 'copying', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'Personally', 'would', 'skip', 'one', 'go', 'buy', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'great', 'make-up', 'special', 'effects', 'Otherwise', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'bought', 'reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'it.It', 'sounded', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'pretty', 'dissatisfied', 'overall']",Demon Wind VHS

My issues with it are, it is an Evil Dead rip off, which was very common around this time.  I actually saw this movie originally when it first came out and remembered liking it enough to order the DVD.  After viewing it again (mind you I was in my 20's when I first saw it, I'm 44 now) it seemed kind of stupid in parts.  Could have done without the martial art magicians.  All that said, I would recommend it to fans of the horror genre.  Especially some of the younger generation of horror fans who have probably seen the Evil Dead and Demons movies, but may not have heard of this one due to it's obscurity.  Also, be aware that all of the DVD copies that I could find require a DVD player that is PAL compatible (able to play foreign DVD's).  I tried it on both of my DVD players and neither worked.

350087,A1DU7DPSJTZHJ6,6303000827,"Zaren Jaede ""Cat""","[5, 5]","Warning: Region 2 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.  Luckily I have that, since there are more than a few rare films that are still only available in the Region 2 format.The story is simple: A young man revisits his family estate where years ago a horror was unleashed by ancestors that delved into the dark arts.  Now that horror is unleashed upon him, his girlfriend, and his iconic friends.  Their attempts to escape are thwarted by dead engines, a mysterious fog that transports them back to the main haunting grounds, and hordes of zombie-demons on the prowl.  They are forced to make a last stand in the ruins of the house that was the source of the evil.  Who do you think will survive?  You get two guesses.Just as in Evil Dead, no one simply dies, everyone comes back in some demonic form.  There are some interesting effects.  My favorite involved some simple camera tricks where the old house can be seen whole and complete through the extant mantle of the doorway instead of in its current state of ruin.  Unlike most of the films in the horror genre from that decade, this one is more hopeful.  There are also powers of good that can be called upon to fight the powers of darkness.I have long been a fan of this film.  The movie certainly plays to a variety of horror tropes, but manages to pull it off.  The special effects are cheesy, pretty standard to the quality of movies from that era in which it was made.  The acting is typical of this genre.  If you liked Evil Dead you will enjoy this movie, and this one has a far more satisfying ending.",4,When Will They Release A Region 1 Version?,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1701,"['Warning', 'Region', '2', 'encoding', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'most', 'DVD', 'players', 'sold', 'US', 'Canada', '[', 'Region', '1', ']', 'item', 'region', 'specific', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player', 'compatible', 'TV', 'Luckily', 'have', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'rare', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'only', 'available', 'Region', '2', 'format.The', 'story', 'simple', 'young', 'man', 'family', 'estate', 'where', 'years', 'horror', 'was', 'unleashed', 'ancestors', 'delved', 'dark', 'arts', 'Now', 'horror', 'unleashed', 'girlfriend', 'iconic', 'friends', 'attempts', 'escape', 'are', 'thwarted', 'dead', 'engines', 'mysterious', 'fog', 'back', 'main', 'haunting', 'grounds', 'hordes', 'zombie-demons', 'prowl', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'last', 'stand', 'ruins', 'house', 'was', 'source', 'evil', 'Who', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'survive', 'get', 'two', 'guesses.Just', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'one', 'simply', 'everyone', 'back', 'demonic', 'form', 'are', 'interesting', 'effects', 'favorite', 'involved', 'simple', 'camera', 'tricks', 'where', 'old', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'whole', 'complete', 'extant', 'mantle', 'doorway', 'instead', 'current', 'state', 'ruin', 'most', 'films', 'horror', 'genre', 'decade', 'one', 'more', 'hopeful', 'are', 'also', 'powers', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'fight', 'powers', 'darkness.I', 'have', 'long', 'been', 'fan', 'film', 'movie', 'certainly', 'variety', 'horror', 'tropes', 'pull', 'off', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'cheesy', 'pretty', 'standard', 'quality', 'movies', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'acting', 'typical', 'genre', 'liked', 'Evil', 'Dead', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'one', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'ending']",Demon Wind VHS
