370129,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6303344224,Austin Somlo,"[1, 2]","Viewed: 4/13Rate: 24/13: I've had it with The Karate Kid series, and the whole series sucks. The Next Karate Kid is truly the worst. If you told me after I saw the film that Hilary Swank would later win two Oscars, I would laugh at your face, and that's what I found out after I saw Boys Don't Cry. In fact, I didn't realize that it was the same person from The Next Karate Kid. Anyway, back to the film being reviewed, there are so many contradictions about it that I feel peeved to have seen the entire debacle. Miyagi says that he doesn't believe in war, fighting, and whatever. Yet he fought in World War II? In the end, he repeats the same sentiment. And yet he still fought in the battle with the stupid drill instructor? What I saw with him beating up his students for practice so he can show off his skills is enough for dismissal from a public high school and a police investigation for assault and battery charges. No principal of any high school would have stood for it. It is illegal, blatant, stupid, and pointless. Remember the moment during the prom where several ""boys"" bungee jumped from the ceiling? Uh...explain the idiocy of the whole scene to me, will you? Oh yeah, I like the part where Eric's nice Oldsmobile gets firebombed. That's really enough for the police to get involved in because that is so senseless. Is it me or do the ""boys"" with black shirts resemble a gang of HJ's? During the hideout with the monks, Miyagi proceeds to teach Julie karate as the whole thing looks like she is preparing for war. Is that so contradictory based on what the monks stood for and believed in? While we are at it, notice the monks are eating plants. Correct me if I am wrong...since they don't believe in killing all living things, is a plant a living thing too? All of a sudden, the grandmother just leaves the house to Miyagi and is never seen again. Why? Notice Julie keeps breaking into school during nights so she can tend to her hawk. Uhh...why not bring the hawk home and provide it shelter and food? Would that be so painfully simple? Eric claims to be a security guard, but he walks atop of the train. What for, Eric? Back to the end, Julie says that she needs to fight to have an ounce of self-respect, but is not fighting enough to garner self-respect? And after fighting, did she prove anything? No. All in all, whoever came up with a load of nonsense for The Next Karate Kid is a certified idiot.",1,Dumb and Dumber.,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,2423,"['Viewed', '4/13Rate', '24/13', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'series', 'whole', 'series', 'sucks', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'truly', 'worst', 'told', 'saw', 'film', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'would', 'later', 'win', 'two', 'Oscars', 'would', 'laugh', 'face', 'what', 'found', 'out', 'saw', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'same', 'person', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Anyway', 'back', 'film', 'being', 'reviewed', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'contradictions', 'feel', 'peeved', 'have', 'seen', 'entire', 'debacle', 'Miyagi', ""n't"", 'believe', 'war', 'fighting', 'fought', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'end', 'same', 'sentiment', 'yet', 'still', 'fought', 'battle', 'stupid', 'drill', 'instructor', 'What', 'saw', 'beating', 'up', 'students', 'practice', 'so', 'can', 'show', 'off', 'skills', 'enough', 'dismissal', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'police', 'investigation', 'assault', 'battery', 'charges', 'principal', 'high', 'school', 'would', 'have', 'stood', 'illegal', 'blatant', 'stupid', 'pointless', 'Remember', 'moment', 'prom', 'where', 'several', 'boys', 'bungee', 'jumped', 'ceiling', 'Uh', 'explain', 'idiocy', 'whole', 'scene', 'will', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'like', 'part', 'where', 'Eric', 'nice', 'Oldsmobile', 'firebombed', 'really', 'enough', 'police', 'get', 'involved', 'so', 'senseless', 'do', 'boys', 'black', 'shirts', 'resemble', 'gang', 'HJ', 'hideout', 'monks', 'Miyagi', 'teach', 'Julie', 'karate', 'whole', 'thing', 'looks', 'preparing', 'war', 'so', 'contradictory', 'based', 'what', 'monks', 'stood', 'believed', 'are', 'monks', 'are', 'eating', 'plants', 'Correct', 'am', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'killing', 'living', 'things', 'plant', 'living', 'thing', 'too', 'sudden', 'grandmother', 'just', 'house', 'Miyagi', 'never', 'seen', 'again', 'Why', 'Notice', 'Julie', 'breaking', 'school', 'nights', 'can', 'tend', 'hawk', 'Uhh', 'why', 'not', 'bring', 'hawk', 'home', 'provide', 'shelter', 'food', 'Would', 'be', 'so', 'painfully', 'simple', 'Eric', 'claims', 'be', 'security', 'guard', 'atop', 'train', 'What', 'Eric', 'Back', 'end', 'Julie', 'fight', 'have', 'ounce', 'self-respect', 'not', 'fighting', 'enough', 'garner', 'self-respect', 'fighting', 'did', 'prove', 'anything', 'No', 'came', 'up', 'load', 'nonsense', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'certified', 'idiot']",The Next Karate Kid VHS

370131,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6303344224,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 7]","Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought Part 1 was excellent. I thought Part 2 was even better. I didn't like Part 3 as much, but it did have an interesting theme as well as some great moments. This 4th chapter was really a sad end to this great series. Mr. Myagi is still in great form, but there are not many other good things I can say about this 4th chapter. In Daniel's absence, Myagi trains Julie Pierce (Hilary Swank). Julie is a really nasty girl, and even though she has some redeeming points, she fails to endear herself to us the way Daniel did depsite his faults. Moving on, Julie finds herself getting into trouble at her school which is controlled by bullies. The ringleader Colonel Dugan (Ironside) is too put it mildly, a major jerk who carries no charm. In Part 1, Kreese carried a charm despite his psychosis. In 2, Sato was frightening, but we never really forgot that he had some redeeming points. We can also speculate that Kreese or Sato would have destroyed Dugan with one hand tied behind their back, without even breaking a sweat. Most of the fight scenes in this movie are forced and unconvincing. (Especially the fight at the service station.) Moving on, Julie in a sympathetic moment gets suspended from school. Mr. Myagi takes her to a monastery. There, Julie cause some havoc by trying to kill a cockroach. In the high point of this movie, Myagi has to explain to Julie that ALL life is sacred to the monks. (A deep profound moment in this weak movie. This is the one gem in this 4th chapter. ) Moving on, Julie goes back to school. In an absurd scene at the dance, Julie's friend Erick gets into a fight with Dugan's bootlicker Ned. This leads to a totally preposterous street confrontation. While the street fight in ""Rocky V"" was actually quite plausible, the street fight in this weak KK 4 was a sad way to end this series. On the + side, there was some satisfaction in seeing Myagi easily trash Dugan. In one saving moment, Myagi gives Julie a proverb: ""Fighting not good. But if must fight, win."" Compare Julie's comment: ""Mr. Myagi, we kicked butt,"" to Daniel's beautiful comment: ""Mr. Myagi, we did it!"" Being totally honest, Mr. Myagi did the best he could in this poor movie, and there was the profound scene in the monastery. But try comparing this 4th chapter to Part 1, 2, or even 3. See if 4 is ANYWHERE near as good as one of the other 3. While Director John Avildsen faithfully stayed at the Directing Helm from parts 1 to 3, he was smart to not have anything to do with this miserable 4th one. With all respect to Director John Avildsen, even his great directing could not have saved this doomed 4th chapter.",2,A Sad End To a Great Series,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,2670,"['Giving', 'brief', 'rundown', 'where', 'stand', 'thought', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'excellent', 'thought', 'Part', '2', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Part', '3', 'much', 'did', 'have', 'interesting', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'moments', '4th', 'chapter', 'was', 'really', 'sad', 'end', 'great', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Myagi', 'still', 'great', 'form', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'good', 'things', 'can', 'say', '4th', 'chapter', 'Daniel', 'absence', 'Myagi', 'Julie', 'Pierce', 'Hilary', 'Swank', 'Julie', 'really', 'nasty', 'girl', 'even', 'redeeming', 'points', 'endear', 'way', 'Daniel', 'did', 'depsite', 'faults', 'Moving', 'Julie', 'getting', 'trouble', 'school', 'controlled', 'bullies', 'ringleader', 'Colonel', 'Dugan', 'Ironside', 'too', 'put', 'mildly', 'major', 'jerk', 'who', 'charm', 'Part', '1', 'Kreese', 'carried', 'charm', 'psychosis', '2', 'Sato', 'was', 'frightening', 'never', 'really', 'forgot', 'had', 'redeeming', 'points', 'can', 'also', 'speculate', 'Kreese', 'Sato', 'would', 'have', 'destroyed', 'Dugan', 'one', 'hand', 'tied', 'back', 'even', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'Most', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'Especially', 'fight', 'service', 'station', 'Moving', 'Julie', 'sympathetic', 'moment', 'suspended', 'school', 'Mr.', 'Myagi', 'monastery', 'Julie', 'cause', 'havoc', 'trying', 'kill', 'cockroach', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'Myagi', 'explain', 'Julie', 'ALL', 'life', 'sacred', 'monks', 'deep', 'profound', 'moment', 'weak', 'movie', 'one', 'gem', '4th', 'chapter', 'Moving', 'Julie', 'back', 'school', 'absurd', 'scene', 'dance', 'Julie', 'friend', 'Erick', 'fight', 'Dugan', 'bootlicker', 'Ned', 'totally', 'preposterous', 'street', 'confrontation', 'street', 'fight', 'Rocky', 'V', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'plausible', 'street', 'fight', 'weak', 'KK', '4', 'was', 'sad', 'way', 'end', 'series', '+', 'side', 'was', 'satisfaction', 'seeing', 'Myagi', 'easily', 'Dugan', 'one', 'saving', 'moment', 'Myagi', 'Julie', 'proverb', 'Fighting', 'not', 'good', 'must', 'fight', 'win', 'Compare', 'Julie', 'comment', 'Mr.', 'Myagi', 'kicked', 'butt', 'Daniel', 'beautiful', 'comment', 'Mr.', 'Myagi', 'did', 'Being', 'totally', 'honest', 'Mr.', 'Myagi', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'poor', 'movie', 'was', 'profound', 'scene', 'monastery', 'try', 'comparing', '4th', 'chapter', 'Part', '1', '2', 'even', '3', 'See', '4', 'ANYWHERE', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'other', '3', 'Director', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'faithfully', 'stayed', 'Directing', 'Helm', 'parts', '1', '3', 'was', 'smart', 'not', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'miserable', '4th', 'one', 'respect', 'Director', 'John', 'Avildsen', 'even', 'great', 'directing', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'saved', 'doomed', '4th', 'chapter']",The Next Karate Kid VHS
370132,A3TF8ZZ0S5UWTL,6303344224,Der Duke,"[5, 8]","Can anyone who has seen The Next Karate Kid please explain to me the nature of the film's villains? The look like a professional security force, they act like a WWF tag-team, they tromp around school like they've got full diplomatic immunity...they even have a drill sergeant. In high school. I just don't get it.Anyway, these guys don't like young Julie Pierce, so they terrorize her repeatedly - and they even come dangerously close to what we, nowadays, would call ""rape."" All Julie wants is to be left alone with her beloved crippled hawk (Kes?), godammit! Julie's well-intentioned grandmother is at the end of her granny-rope, so she enlists the aid of old family friend Mr. Miyagi. Given that this is now the fourth time we've met Mr. Miyagi, and we've never once seen him interact with a teenage girl, the viewer is left to wonder if this arrangement is such a grand idea. But wouldn't you know it? The brusque and bouncy Julie slowly warms up to the adorable Mr. Miyagi, and yadda yadda, etc.To quote one of the wise sages who comment at the IMDb, The Next Karate Kid is ""the pits."" Hilary Swank must cringe whenever she sees the flick pop up on cable; indeed, she's the one thing that makes The Next Karate Kid worth seeing. Not because she gives a particularly excellent performance (although she's better than the material deserves), but because this is such a GOOFY movie. For no good reason the flick takes a 20-minute detour into a freakin' monastery, for cryin' out loud! Plus this is a film in which Mr. Miyagi goes shopping for a PROM DRESS! Gee, anyone think we're just blatantly pandering to the ""other"" demographic at this point? Then just wait till the Hi - larious scene in which Mr. Miyagi walks in on Julie while she's changing...and he almost sees her boobies! Never thought I'd say it but...where's Daniel-san these days? Surely he could still be in need of some wise advice.Anyway, Julie gets a date, grows some confidence, and kicks the ass of head bully #1. Also there's Michael Ironside as an evil high school sergeant who is apparently invisible to cops.

The story is forced, the characters are ridiculously over the top, and any scene with the monks is just bad.  It's almost painful to watch this movie.  Some of the lines are laughable.  When Julie (Swank) challenges the bully to fight, she says, ""If I'm ever going to respect myself, I need to do this.""  Um, okey dokey.  There are several lines which are just as bad.  The villain characters are laughably unbelievable, especially Col. Dugan.  Why would any school have a team of bullies like the Alpha Elite?  Nothing makes sense in this movie.

What do all these movies have in common with The Next Karate Kid?  They're all sequels that should have never been made.  The first indication that this movie was a bad idea is that Macchio passed on it.Hilary Swank plays Julie-san, a girl bullied in her high school.  She's got anger issues, family issues, and the team of tough-guy jocks called the Alpha Elite does not help the situation at all.  Despite the unlikely scenario of a high school boy's club that practices martial arts and enforces discipline/rules throughout the school, the odds of them picking on a single girl are even more unlikely.  The odds of a girl beating up the leader of that group gets into the preposterous territory.Aside from those obvious flaws, this movie is simply not that good.  Nobody really wants to see Karate Kid I all over again with Hillary Swank playing the part of Ralph Macchio.  Nothing against Swank, but she was simply an actress learning her way at this point, and this ridiculous, recycled role did nothing to help her out.  And the addition of monks who bowl with their eyes closed surely didn't help.It's a wretched sequel.  Pat Morita and Hillary Swank may be good actors, but the idea to make this movie is as bad as playing with fireworks in an arid forest.",1,Squish just like grape,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,1392,"['Teen', 'Wolf', 'II', 'Revenge', 'Nerds', 'II', 'Speed', 'II', 'Dumb', 'Dumberer', 'Friday', '13th', 'VIII', 'Jason', 'Takes', 'Manhattan', 'Rocky', 'V.', 'What', 'do', 'movies', 'have', 'common', 'Next', 'Karate', 'Kid', ""'re"", 'sequels', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'first', 'indication', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'Macchio', 'passed', 'it.Hilary', 'Swank', 'Julie-san', 'girl', 'bullied', 'high', 'school', 'got', 'anger', 'issues', 'family', 'issues', 'team', 'tough-guy', 'jocks', 'called', 'Alpha', 'Elite', 'not', 'help', 'situation', 'unlikely', 'scenario', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'club', 'practices', 'martial', 'arts', 'enforces', 'discipline/rules', 'school', 'odds', 'picking', 'single', 'girl', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'unlikely', 'odds', 'girl', 'beating', 'up', 'leader', 'group', 'preposterous', 'territory.Aside', 'obvious', 'flaws', 'movie', 'simply', 'not', 'good', 'Nobody', 'really', 'see', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'over', 'again', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'playing', 'part', 'Ralph', 'Macchio', 'Nothing', 'Swank', 'was', 'simply', 'actress', 'learning', 'way', 'point', 'ridiculous', 'recycled', 'role', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'out', 'addition', 'monks', 'who', 'bowl', 'eyes', 'closed', 'surely', 'did', ""n't"", 'help.It', 'wretched', 'sequel', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Hillary', 'Swank', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'actors', 'idea', 'make', 'movie', 'as', 'bad', 'playing', 'fireworks', 'arid', 'forest']",The Next Karate Kid VHS

370143,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6303344224,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 1]","Now I am going to review The Next Karate Kid released in 1994. I know a lot of people feel it's this is worse than part III some love part III. KKIII is to me the worst sequel ever. Directed by Christopher Cain he directed Young Guns, Pure Country & recently the sequel & Gone Fishing. Stars Pat Morita for the last time in a Karate Kid movie. I think this was the 1st role of Hillary Swank who plays Julie Pierce. Also stars Michael Ironside as Colonel Dugan, Chris Conrad as Eric, Michael Caveieri as Ned. Story is you have this 17 yr old girl named Julie Pierce who lives with her grandmother cause her parents died in a car wreck. Miyagi came to Boston where he was attending a WW II cermony. Julie takes care of this hawk on the roofof the school. Miyagi has Julie's Grandmother go to his house in California so he can help Julie. At school there's this guy named Ned who makes advances towards Julie he plants a pack of cigarettes on her Colonel Dugan makes it where The principle will have her expelled if she gets in trouble. Colonel Dugan is a leader of a group ofN  a  z  i  Hall M Monitors  The Alpha  Elite. Julie becomes friends with 1 of The Alpha Elite Eric cause Colonel Dugan will give him an Air Force recommendation. You have funny scene whit Miyagi & Dugan. Julie leaves the house & is almost ran over by a car she jumps using the tiger position. When she is taking care of the hawk again those mean hall monitors & Ned still wants Julie she sets off a fire alarm the cops show up & Colonel Dugan is a cop I guess Julie is suspended for 2 weeks. Miyagi takes Julie to a Monistery to train her which are funny scenes & Pat Morita is in the role unlike KKIII. You have a scene where she almost kills a roach a Monk stops her & I know The NC made fun of this but I get it. BTW NC review is hilarious. When they come back to Boston her hawk is able to fly & the prom is coming up so Miyagi buys her a dress. Eric left The Alpha Elite & Dugan wants Ned to beat his a  s  s. Julie & Eric go to The Prom while Miyagi takes The Monks Bowling  a hilarious scene. The bungee jumping scene is dumb. Eric takes Julie home Ned breaks the windows on his car. Eric goes to the docks to fight Ned but all his Alpha Elite buddies are there he gets owned. They blow his car up which is over thre top. Dugan tells his boys to finish it. Julie & Miyagi show up & the fight is better than any of KKIII's fights. Miyagi has a fight with Dugan & he owns him You feel better at the end than KKIII. Christopher Cain isn't the best director but he did alright. Pat Morita was definitely in the character this time. Michael Ironside was ok & not as over the top as Kove, Griffith in part III. Hillary Swank was well swank. Chris Conrad was alright. Michael Cavieri was there but he wasn't terrible like Sean Kanan. So Next Karate Kid is a fun sequel I'll admit.

The plot is interesting, Mr. Miyagi is acting like himself again, and Hillary Swank is a great actress. The very beginning was a little shaky, but after that the movie became very good.This movie has the idea of the first one somewhat, but featuring a quick-tempered girl, Julie. Mr. Miyagi is staying at her house while her grandmother goes to his house for some peace and quiet. Miyagi first has to earn Julie's respect during his stay. While he is there, he teaches her Kata for self-defense against a guy she hates, as well as how to dance for the upcoming prom. It may sound clich&eacute;, but when you see it you will like it.Mr. Miyagi also takes Julie to a Buddhist monastery, with monks who turn out to be quite humorous. The best part is when they visit Julie's house and go &quot;Zen bowling&quot; on her prom night.Overall, this was a great comeback from the horrible KK3. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is nothing can truly match up to the original Karate Kid. My advice? Buy the DVD of this one and the original, skip KK2 and KK3.

370145,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,6303344224,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[0, 0]","MILD SPOILERSHilary Swank gives us an intense, goodhearted early performance as Julie, ""THE NEXT KARATE KID"" in THE KARATE KID series of films. Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita reprises Mr. Miyagi, the wise elder who teaches ""Julie-san"" karate, both as a way of bolstering the orphaned teenager's self-esteem and as a way of defending herself against a bunch of punks under the sway of their obnoxious coach, played by Michael Ironside.The violence in THE NEXT KARATE KID is very toned down and a lot less plausible than in the original film. Even the most abusive man on earth would hardly take it upon himself to teach a gang of boys to target one specific girl, and if he did, he'd end up under arrest in a prison psych ward, especially if he was a High School Coach. As a result, Ironside and his minions are barely believable. The climactic battle between Julie and the punks had me smiling, as these implacable terrorizers had their collective @$$es kicked by a chick in what ended up being a two minute fight sequence.However, THE NEXT KARATE KID has some wonderful and not-to-be-missed scenes inside a Zen Buddhist monastery, where Miyagi teaches Julie the art of Empty Hand Combat even while imbuing her with the spiritual fibre she will need in order not to fight.The monks are wise and good natured, even when Julie kills a cockroach:Miyagi (sternly): Monks no kill cockroach, have have respect for all life.Julie:  It's a roach. It's gross. And hey, I've seen you kill bugs.Miyagi: Miyagi not monk in monastery. But still have respect for all life!Later . . .Miyagi: Monks have surprise for you!Julie (panicking):  Okay, I admit I killed a spider in my room! But it was an accident, and I buried it, and I even said a little prayer over the grave!Monks:  Happy Birthday To You...Happy Birthday To You...Happy Birthday dear Julie-san...Happy Birthday to you!There is a humorous sequence inside a bowling alley, where the inexperienced but perfectly centered monks play perfect game after perfect game against a bowling league. It's all very memorable and the seemingly magical ability of the monks to turn gutter balls into strikes will have you laughing out loud. True Zen practice, however, has no magical side effects.Miyagi is referred to as ""Sensei"" (""Teacher"") by the monks, a term of ultimate respect in the Zen community. The film never addresses whether Miyagi was ever a Zen monk, but it's possible. He is wise and kindly (and showing his age); his gentleness with Julie creates the same filial dynamic which Miyagi and Daniel shared in the original.This is THE NEXT KARATE KID, and nowhere as good as the first, but it certainly has a quality all its own.",4,Miyagi Sensei ( * * * 1/2 ),1288915200,"11 5, 2010",2010,2666,"['MILD', 'SPOILERSHilary', 'Swank', 'intense', 'goodhearted', 'early', 'performance', 'Julie', 'NEXT', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'THE', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'series', 'films', 'Noriyuki', 'Pat', 'Morita', 'Mr.', 'Miyagi', 'wise', 'elder', 'who', 'Julie-san', 'karate', 'way', 'bolstering', 'orphaned', 'teenager', 'self-esteem', 'way', 'defending', 'bunch', 'punks', 'sway', 'obnoxious', 'coach', 'played', 'Michael', 'Ironside.The', 'violence', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'very', 'toned', 'down', 'lot', 'less', 'plausible', 'original', 'film', 'Even', 'most', 'abusive', 'man', 'earth', 'would', 'hardly', 'take', 'teach', 'gang', 'boys', 'target', 'one', 'specific', 'girl', 'did', ""'d"", 'end', 'up', 'arrest', 'prison', 'psych', 'ward', 'especially', 'was', 'High', 'School', 'Coach', 'result', 'Ironside', 'minions', 'are', 'barely', 'believable', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Julie', 'punks', 'had', 'smiling', 'implacable', 'terrorizers', 'had', 'collective', '@', 'es', 'kicked', 'chick', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'two', 'minute', 'fight', 'sequence.However', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'wonderful', 'not-to-be-missed', 'scenes', 'Zen', 'Buddhist', 'monastery', 'where', 'Miyagi', 'Julie', 'art', 'Empty', 'Hand', 'Combat', 'even', 'imbuing', 'spiritual', 'fibre', 'will', 'need', 'order', 'not', 'fight.The', 'monks', 'are', 'wise', 'good', 'natured', 'even', 'when', 'Julie', 'cockroach', 'Miyagi', 'sternly', 'kill', 'cockroach', 'have', 'have', 'respect', 'life.Julie', 'roach', 'gross', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kill', 'bugs.Miyagi', 'Miyagi', 'not', 'monk', 'monastery', 'still', 'have', 'respect', 'life', 'Later', '.Miyagi', 'Monks', 'have', 'surprise', 'Julie', 'panicking', 'Okay', 'admit', 'killed', 'spider', 'room', 'was', 'accident', 'buried', 'even', 'said', 'little', 'prayer', 'grave', 'Monks', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Julie-san', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'humorous', 'sequence', 'bowling', 'alley', 'where', 'inexperienced', 'perfectly', 'centered', 'monks', 'play', 'perfect', 'game', 'perfect', 'game', 'bowling', 'league', 'very', 'memorable', 'seemingly', 'magical', 'ability', 'monks', 'turn', 'gutter', 'balls', 'strikes', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'True', 'Zen', 'practice', 'however', 'magical', 'side', 'effects.Miyagi', 'referred', 'Sensei', 'Teacher', 'monks', 'term', 'ultimate', 'respect', 'Zen', 'community', 'film', 'never', 'Miyagi', 'was', 'ever', 'Zen', 'monk', 'possible', 'wise', 'kindly', 'showing', 'age', 'gentleness', 'Julie', 'same', 'filial', 'dynamic', 'Miyagi', 'Daniel', 'shared', 'original.This', 'THE', 'NEXT', 'KARATE', 'KID', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'certainly', 'quality', 'own']",The Next Karate Kid VHS

370147,A19RAJY6R7USN0,6303344224,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[24, 29]","&quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; is the fourth and as it stands final Karate Kid movie. Released in 1994, a few years after &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;, this movie no longer focuses on the Karate Kid Daniel and his relationship with his Karate teacher Mr Miyagi. It is unexplained but suffice it to say the original karate kid has grown up. In &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; we follow Mr Miyagi's relationship with a teenage girl named Julie and watch as she becomes the next karate kid.Julie (played by Hilary Swank who went on to win an Oscar for &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;) is being bullied by boys at school who are following the violent teachings of their coach. Mr Miyagi (played by Pat Morita from the original Karate Kid movies) comes into her life and helps Julie learn courage and self respect through the use of karate and belief in oneself.In comparison to the other three Karate Kid movies, &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; is a lot less violent. The Karate Kid has been increasing the violence with each movie, but has gone the other way with this one, and is all the better for it. There is a lot less of the karate and a lot more of the kid! No longer does the karate kid become about the next fight scene or the major karate move taught by Mr Miyagi. In &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; Danny learnt the crane, in &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; Danny learnt the driver punch and in &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; Danny learnt the Miyagi family kata. These special moves were used at the end of each movie. In contrast, with &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; Mr Miyagi teaches Julie the tiger kick, but she doesn't need to use it in the final fight. In fact in this movie Mr Miyagi has the final fight. No longer is fighting the driving force of the movie, and I'm sure that's something Mr Miyagi would agree with since he hates fighting anyway.Here in &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; we are able to focus on the characters. And from that we can really feel for them when the fight scene does come. So if you are looking for a real karate action movie I suggest another movie. The fight choreography itself is sometimes a little poor, but it is all done by the same choreographer as the original Karate Kid movies so maybe he was just having a bad day. Mr Miyagi also appears to be having a bad day, because although he wins his fights fairly easily, he does look very old when fighting. I'm sure he used to kick higher and not lose his balance in the previous movies.Hilary Swank is truly fantastic as Julie. Hilary Swank makes you believe in Julie and her actions are perfectly credible through Hilary Swank's performance. Mr Miyagi is almost as much Mr Miyagi as he always was. I say this because some of what Mr Miyagi says is questionable. He says lines like &quot;If must fight, win!&quot; Not entirely sure Mr Miyagi would say that.

For others, it's worse than you imagined.WAX ON (the ""half full"" review):1). Hillary Swank is attractive and engaging as Julie, the tomboy with anger management issues.2). Pat Morita. I'm sure he knew this was less than a 5 star flick when he signed up for it, but he deserved one final Miyagi-sized payday. No harm, no foul on his part.3). I gave this one 5 stars for having the courage to break from the formula.WAX OFF (the ""half empty"" review):1). The ice melts a little too quickly on Hillary Swank's character for it to b believable, especially in the romance department.2). Michael Ironside. Neil Young made the one-note solo entertaining in ""Cinnamon Girl."" Ironside is basically playing the same role here as the one he played in ""Total Recall"" and probably every other movie he's been in.

Hilary Swank is  very good as the &quot;Next Karate Kid,&quot; an angry orphaned teenager  who Mr. Miyagi takes under his wing. She is a convincing actress, and  conveyed her emotions pretty well. The movie is worth watching for her  alone.  Unfortunately, most of the other acting falls on its face.The  first half of the film plays off very well against the first karate kid,  and it doesn't bore us with same old, same old in terms of karate  instruction (most of the time).

It's not so much that he would have been a great father to a daughter, but he does live a life as that to respect all living things and to respect all God's creatures, including yourself.This is one of Hilary Swank's first films and she rules the screen immediately and commands presence throughout the film.  She's one of those actresses that I don't look at her for her beauty, but I respect her commanding aura of a prominent actress.

It's more of the same bullying that has become a Karate Kid staple. This movie isn't bad; in fact, Hilary Swank is interesting in her role, and keeps the viewer's interest, but not before we're treated to a barrage of nonsense behavior by some high school bullies and their coach who rattles off one stupid line after another.

In this film, Mr. Miyagi takes a trip out East to receive a special commendation from the President for his unit's extraordinay achievements during WWII. He stays over at the home of the widow of his former best friend. The woman is having a difficult time raising her granddaughter, Julie, who was orphaned after her parents were killed in a car accident. Mr. Miyagi suggests she take a trip to California and stay at his place on a vacation while he stays and takes care of her home and her granddaughter. Other than being fiercely angry at life, Julie is also having problems at school and is being harassed by the school's administratively supported bullies, the Alph Elite. Through the tutoring of Mr. Miyagi, Julie is able to control her anger and find focus in her life.Hillary Swank pulls off a believable and emotionally-deep performance as Julie Pierce. The role needn't required so much depth, but her character reminds one of the girl next door.However, as good as Swank is, the real reason to see this film is Pat Morita. It's great to see Mr. Miyagi again. His character reminds me of a real life Yoda. As long as the story is decent, one can't get enough of a great character like him.

With ""The Next Karate Kid"", the well ran dry.For a basic plot summary, the film sees Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) mentoring a troubled teen (Hilary Swank) who's parents have passed away.  A mash-up of Karate Kid I, II, and III then occurs, with themes from each film present but briefly touched upon.Though I could go on and on about why this film is poor, here is the primary reason: the high expectations.  The original ""Karate"" trilogy is so incredible, that anything less from the established characters is going to be a letdown.  Thus, the whole movie I kept waiting for great things to happen, but they never did.  I can't think of one single scene from this film that tops any scene from the first three.The only thing that elevates ""Next"" above a one star is the performance by Morita as Miyagi.  As in KK III, he steals the show with his comedy and words of wisdom.I think that the fourth Karate Kid film can be summed up thusly: Had the original trilogy never been made, this film may be looked at as decent.
