794788,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00018D3LE,Alex Udvary,"[0, 0]","A man enters a hotel room and finds a flood in the bathroom. As he tries to see what's clogging the toliet he finds a heart inside. This is the beginning of Stephen Frears' ""Dirty Pretty Things"". It kind of reminds me of David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" where a man finds an ear in an open field.The man is Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) he is an illegal immigrant from Nigerian who works in a big London hotel. Now naturally the main thing Okwe wants answered is where did this heart come from? And he soon learns that in the hotel business it's best to keep to himself and not really concern himself with what's going on in the rooms. This comes from his boss Juan (Sergi Lopez).Now there is also another story going on here also dealing with Okwe. He is living with Senay (Audrey Tautou). Both are having problems with the law. It seems someone has find out that Senay has a job at the same hotel Okwe is working. Normally this wouldn't matter but she is not yet offically a U.S. citizen. And is not allowed to work.The movie is directed by Stephen Frears and is written by Steve Knight. Because Frears directed it I thought it was going to be thriller. Something in the vain of ""The Grifters"", a movie I like very much. But, no. ""Dirty Pretty Things"" is not written like your conventional thriller. It plays off more like a character study of the Okwe character. So there is a certain excitment missing from the movie. But it means to do that. Because the movie is more interested in it's characters and not a formula story-line. I must admit I would of appreciated if it had hints of a more routine thriller. The movie still would of worked.If there is one fault with the movie it has to do with the acting. Audrey Tautou probably best known to audiences through the French film ""Amelie"". Her character doesn't seem clearly defined. We get an idea of what type of person she is, but the movie only seems to hint things. Also Sergi Lopez from ""An Affair of Love"" has a few scenes in the beginning and it looks as if his character will not amount too much. This causes a problem because he is barely used. And his best moments come near the end of the film. And finally Chiwetel Ejiofor just for some reason doesn't seem like ""leading man"" material to me. I'm not saying there is something wrong with his perfomance. But he doesn't seem like the kind of actor who really commands an audience's attention.Now I don't want to make it seem like ""Dirty Pretty Things"" is a bad movie. It has it's moments. Escpecially near the end. And some supporting characters are fun to watch like Juliette (Sohie Okonedo) who is the hotel hooker.If this movie is playing near you it wouldn't hurt to go see it. Most audiences will enjoy the film. It has a slow pace and gives the Okwe character some depth providing us with some murky info on his past. I should also mention that the movie was nominated for the ""Golden Lion"" award at the Venice Film Festival.  *** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Enjoyable character study that uses a thriller as it's background. Has nice moments and a fair amount of the acting is enjoyable.

794789,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00018D3LE,Andy Orrock,"[7, 7]","I saw ""Dirty, Pretty Things"" here in the Dallas area on opening weekend, drawn by thought ""hey, I'll see anything with Audrey Tautou.""  The US marketers of this British film know that the Tautou connection is what will entice moviegoers to check it out.  So, they've put together this marketing campaign based around this alluring, bare-backed photo of a seductive Tautou peering over her shoulder.Too bad that has nothing at all to do with the film, in which Ms. Tautou plays a English-speaking Turkish immigrant with a hard life that she wears on her face throughout the movie.  No scene in the film comes close to what is depicted in the advertising campaign.  This is typical of US marketers.  These are the same masterminds who wanted to rename ""Bend It Like Beckham"" to ""Move It Like Mia"" for that smash hit's US release because obviously the audience here would ignore a movie centered around a name 'nobody' knows.  These folks obviously need to get out more often.For all the talk and marketing juice centered on Tautou, she plays third-string here once the movie kicks off.  The heart of everything that happens revolves around Chiwetel Ejiofor's 'Okwe' character.  He's wonderful here.But the film is absolutely stolen by Sergi Lopez, known in the film behind-his-back as 'Sneaky' and to his face as 'Senor Juan.'  He plays a reprehensible, larger-than-life character running a complex and brazen black market operation from his desk deep in the bowels of the hotel that employs all the protagonists.Lopez is known to most audiences for his star turn in 2000's ""An Affair Love,"" a.k.a., ""A Pornographic Affair.""  He's so shockingly different here in 'Things' that you don't put 2 & 2 together until the closing credits (or perhaps not even until you come home and look him up on IMDB.com).  Anyway, this is a Spanish actor best know here for his French roles standing out from his peers with a strong performance in English.  Obviously, a talented guy.

With strong performances by Audrey Tatou and Chiwetel Ejiofor, and supporting characters who carry their roles well, an important message about immigration is delivered.Stuck in London, we watch the sordid compromises made by different immigrants who want to keep their status hidden. Each manipulates the other, from whores to organ harvesters.Okwe works in a hotel which seems to be a center of the trouble. Illegal immigrants are abound, and making choices needed to survive. Okwe, formerly a physician, is asked to get involved in organ harvesting. He won't, but when faced with watching the life of Senay (Audrey Tatou) crumble, he must decide. To operate, he'll get passports and other papers for both of them.The storyline is relatively simple, but the challenges are not. Who, when and why people make the decisions they do is at the heart of the movie's interest.It is apolitical, and deals with the problems in London, not the USA, and so escapes the current milieu the White House is working through. What's true? I don't know, but the tale's told well.Instead, it is about people. There's little here to feel good about, but we are left with a glimmer of hope.

But you may well quickly doff your Tautou infatuation once the movie gets in gear.

It is a stark reminder of the decisions we make and the ramifications that propogate from those decisions.At its base level, the movie is about the unrequited love of a man and a woman...sort of.  It is not, as popularly expressed, a murder mystery.

In fact, even if one thinks that immigration laws should be enforced, the film can still be appreciated. This is because it shows the realities of the immigrant life. But Frears never moralizes or lectures or tries to hit the viewer over the head with his views.""Dirty Pretty Things"" takes place in a London that we do not usually see, but could have been in any big city in the world. Immigrants, especially illegal ones, are drawn to places like this so they can try to be anonymous and get easy employment. They live lives of degradation which they accept matter of factly and grow accustomed to being constantly watched by the authorities......knowing that if they make one mistake, they will be forced to leave.The moral dilemma faced by one of the main characters is an interesting one and gives the story an unexpected twist at the end.Okwe, as played by Chiwetel Ejofor, is exceptional. Audrey Tautou is her usual charismatic self playing Senay, who is desperate and weary, seeming to accept her fate yet showing sparks of rebellion.The movie follows what these characters do to make a living and survive while hoping, not very optimistically, for better lives, and living in constant fear of the immigration authorities.

794795,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00018D3LE,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","`Dirty Pretty Things', directed by Stephen Frears, is a classic thriller of `little people' living just over the edge of legality and just on the edge of poverty. So many movies that deal with this situation can so easily end in tragedy. I hope I don't spoil it for anyone by saying that this story has a happy ending, although it does keep you on pins and needles as it unravels its dirty little secrets and imperils the principle cast members.Audrey Tautou gets top billing on the cover of the DVD in the role of the young Turkish girl, Senay, illegally employed as a mail at The Baltic Hotel in London, although her billing is based more on the major impression she made with her role in `Amelie' rather than her relative importance in this film. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays a Nigerian, Okwe plays the real lead, trained as a doctor in Lagos, but working as both a minicab driver and hotel night clerk in the same Baltic Hotel.These two principal characters meet as a result of their `timesharing' an apartment. Their involvement with one another deepens as Okwe discovers some illicit sale and harvesting of organs from immigrants being done at the hotel, primarily by the Spanish manager who enlists the `donors' and arranges the deliveries and payoffs. The Turk, Senay, is in England on a very limited visa which does not permit her to work, so she is driven into a desperate situation by her being investigated by immigration agents who track her to `The Baltic Hotel', suspecting she is employed there.This DVD has my very favorite special feature, a voice-over commentary by the director, Frears. One thing this commentary revealed is the great regard directors have for the work and comments on film by the great Alfred Hitchcock. This is the director's commentary in a row where I have heard the director cite one or more of Hitchcock's techniques or doctrines about directing.The comments about when and where various scenes were filmed is interesting, but probably less interesting to the average viewer than to a professional filmmaker. What is more interesting is Frear's comments on missed opportunities where he could have made more of a scene. The thing which most stands out in this commentary was how great a pleasure it was for Frears to work with this cast and the great respect he had for Tautou as an actress.The fact that this does have a happy ending makes it much more rewatchable, as does the good director's commentary. So many of these gritty slice of life movies end on such a depressing note that unless you happen to have good friends who like that sort of thing, you rarely find an opportunity to watch the movie a second time.That should not be the case with this film.",4,Engaging 'slice of life on the edge' with happy ending,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2704,"['Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'classic', 'thriller', 'little', 'people', 'living', 'just', 'edge', 'legality', 'just', 'edge', 'poverty', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'deal', 'situation', 'can', 'so', 'easily', 'end', 'tragedy', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'saying', 'story', 'happy', 'ending', 'keep', 'pins', 'needles', 'dirty', 'little', 'secrets', 'principle', 'cast', 'members.Audrey', 'Tautou', 'top', 'billing', 'cover', 'DVD', 'role', 'young', 'Turkish', 'girl', 'Senay', 'illegally', 'employed', 'mail', 'Baltic', 'Hotel', 'London', 'billing', 'based', 'more', 'major', 'impression', 'made', 'role', 'Amelie', 'rather', 'relative', 'importance', 'film', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'who', 'Nigerian', 'Okwe', 'real', 'lead', 'trained', 'doctor', 'Lagos', 'working', 'minicab', 'driver', 'hotel', 'night', 'clerk', 'same', 'Baltic', 'Hotel.These', 'two', 'principal', 'characters', 'meet', 'result', 'timesharing', 'apartment', 'involvement', 'one', 'Okwe', 'illicit', 'sale', 'harvesting', 'organs', 'immigrants', 'being', 'done', 'hotel', 'primarily', 'Spanish', 'manager', 'who', 'donors', 'deliveries', 'payoffs', 'Turk', 'Senay', 'England', 'very', 'limited', 'visa', 'not', 'permit', 'work', 'driven', 'desperate', 'situation', 'being', 'investigated', 'immigration', 'agents', 'who', 'track', 'Baltic', 'Hotel', 'suspecting', 'employed', 'there.This', 'DVD', 'very', 'favorite', 'special', 'feature', 'voice-over', 'commentary', 'director', 'Frears', 'One', 'thing', 'commentary', 'revealed', 'great', 'regard', 'directors', 'have', 'work', 'comments', 'film', 'great', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'director', 'commentary', 'row', 'where', 'have', 'heard', 'director', 'cite', 'one', 'more', 'Hitchcock', 'techniques', 'doctrines', 'directing.The', 'comments', 'when', 'where', 'various', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'interesting', 'probably', 'less', 'interesting', 'average', 'viewer', 'professional', 'filmmaker', 'What', 'more', 'interesting', 'Frear', 'comments', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'scene', 'thing', 'most', 'stands', 'out', 'commentary', 'was', 'how', 'great', 'pleasure', 'was', 'Frears', 'work', 'cast', 'great', 'respect', 'had', 'Tautou', 'actress.The', 'fact', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'much', 'more', 'rewatchable', 'good', 'director', 'commentary', 'So', 'many', 'gritty', 'slice', 'life', 'movies', 'end', 'depressing', 'note', 'happen', 'have', 'good', 'friends', 'who', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'rarely', 'find', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'film']",Dirty Pretty Things

In ""Dirty Pretty Things"" the viewer is taken beneath the usual staid and proper face of the city to its dirty tenements and nasty underworld.  And we're not invited into a lower-class colorful Cockney world.Instead, we are shown into a world teeming with immigrants, legal and illegal, from all over the world, trying to survive in a brutal world without mercy for the defenseless. It is a world filled with sweatshops you would expect to see in a third world country, prostitutes, and predators of every stripe.The legal immigrant is Senay, a Turkish Muslim played by the lovely Audrey Tautou.  She displays the wide range of her acting talent in a role quite different fron the whimsical pixie she portayed in ""Amelie"".  She is a housekeeper in the aptly named Baltic Hotel.Her counterpart is Okwe, an illegal immigrant from Nigeria, a former doctor who is now a taxi driver and night desk clerk at the same hotel where Senay works and is allowed to sleep on her couch when she is not there. I don't know where they found Chitwetel Ejiofor,  but he has star potential. He actually steals this movie in my opinion, even with an outstanding performance by Tautou.The two of them are thrown together by happenstance. Each is preyed upon by the type of vultures that haunt a large city's underbelly.  Senay is sexually exploited by a sweatshop owner. Okwe is exploited by Sneaky Juan the kind of underworld denizen always working an angle at some vulnerable immigrant's expense.  He co-opts Okwe into using his medical skill for an outrageously immoral scheme in exchange for fake passports for Okwe and Senay. After their experience in the London underworld these two immigrants want to emigrate.The satisfying irony of how Okwe obtains the passports from Sneaky Juan, and then turns the tables on him, is worth the price of admission itself. It involves a very clever plot twist. The movie has a bittersweet ending but that is hardly a negative for this gem. Very nicely done and well worth seeing.

The movie centers around a hotel where Okwe (Chitwetel Ejiofer) is a Nigerian immigrant working in a glittery, yet seedy hotel. Senay (Audrey Tatou) is his roommate and also has a job cleaning the hotel after the prostitutes fleece the coins from their clients. Okwe's boss, Juan (Sergi Lopez) plays the villian in this movie and has some dirty, shady dealings going on in the hotel that has become lucatative at the expense of illegal immigrants (don't want to spoil the movie for you). The characters are all drawn closer into conflict by wants and needs and thus the conflict occurs between Okwe, Sergi and Senay.Frears shows the audience a small (really small) glimspe of the difficult and improvish life immigrants have. This movie is helped immeasurably by the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofer, who steals the movie away from Audrey Tatou. Tatou's character wasn't developed as in depth as ejiofer or Lopez, thus she can across as staged and wooden, but Tatou does radiate a beauty that is striking. Sohie Okonedo plays a wise cracking hooker that lends a quirkiness to the film, and has a beauty that rivals Tatou. Lopez plays an excellent villian, his script is nicely constructed thus his twisted deals really have you hating this guy toward the end of the film. However, their were some faults in the movie: the heart in the toliet makes no sense, a heart is worth more than a kidney; and why would Lopez be so careless about the operation or about trusting Okwe (especially giving him the passport and money, when he knows he loves Senay).

The hero and other characters in the film go about their business of attempting to improve their lives in an environment of exploitive bosses, overbearing police, and other immigrants who make very different choices than the first inclinations of the primary subjects.At its heart, DPT is asking the question: how does one behave morally in an immoral world? How does one better one's life without harming others? And how is it that people who appear to be immoral can often claim to be helping others while they help themselves? What is right and wrong?The choices the hero makes are not easy ones. He's a moral man (one character calls him an angel), yet he's knowingly breaking the law (although the law isn't always right), and even he engages in petty deceptions before being presented with much more weighty decisions to be made.There are enough challenging moral choices in this film to spawn hours of debate among ethicists. Even the average moviegoer will be forced to ponder `what would I do in this situation'? One can also extrapolate the lessons of the movie (especially the ending) to much broader subjects. Is it right to engage in a war in which soldiers and civilians are killed, in order to remove a despotic dictator - or is there another, better, more moral path?

Okwe is also engaged in getting money on the side in collusion with the Russian doorman Ivan, where they sell food to hotel customers when the kitchens are closed.  It's a tough life indeed, as Okwe chews on some leaves that takes away his necessity to sleep.One evening, Okwe finds a human heart lodged in the toilet of one of the rooms.  What happened in that room?  He is dissuaded from investigating by the oily Juan, the manager, who tells him that calling the police will require him to identify himself, which would lead to his being discovered as an illegal.  Even Ivan tells him not to concern himself with who comes and who goes.  However, he discovers that some immigrants are so desperate, they will resort to doing something very hazardous to get a visa or passport, and it's this that puts a little wasp in Okwe's head.  It's a wasp that stings him into the reason why he left his country, and which ultimately transforms him from a survivor to a human being.Senay, though, gets a job at a sweatshop following a close encounter with immigration, but that falls through when she is forced to do sexual favours for the sweatshop boss.  She dreams of going to New York where her cousin lives and needs to work in order to get the money.  Her desperate act of trying to fulfill that dream is what ultimately stirs Okwe into action, where he must call on all sorts of favours.As the desperate, hard-working, and ultimately conscientious Okwe, Chiwetel Ejiofor is definitely a strong presence in this film.  And this has to be Audrey Tautou's toughest role ever.  Senay is a far cry from Amelie or Venus Beauty Institute's Maria, going through hardships that ordinary non-immigrants would never go through, and she proves she's more than just the romantic idealist Amelie or the mentally disturbed Angelique in A La Folie...Pas Du Tout.  She does well speaking English with a non-French accent.  Yes, this film proves Tautou is a real actress, something I already knew with Amelie.In one of his earlier films, My Beautiful Launderette, Stephen Frears explored a different side of immigrants, race relations between the affluent Pakistanis and the poor unskilled whites.  Here, he outlines a more sordid situation for those who leave their homeland in search of better opportunities and freedom, only to find that they are trapped in a neverending cycle of fear and poverty.  As Okwe tells Senay, who dreams of going to New York City to be with her cousin, there are no dreams:  ""for you and me, there's only survival.""",4,A dark world of no dreams...only survival,1089417600,"07 10, 2004",2004,3507,"[""'re"", 'people', 'never', 'see', 'drive', 'cars', 'clean', 'rooms', 'Okwe', 'Nigerian', 'immigrant', 'London', 'here', 'illegally', 'struggling', 'survive', 'barely', 'day', 'cab', 'night', 'front', 'desk', 'clerk', 'Baltic', 'Hotel', 'Surviving', 'means', 'making', 'connections', 'others', 'talents', 'skills', 'Okwe', 'doctor', 'boss', 'who', 'clap', 'getting', 'medicine', 'Chinese', 'named', 'Guo', 'Yi', 'exchange', 'boss', 'first', 'dibs', 'South', 'London', 'portrait', 'immigrant', 'experience', 'contemporary', 'London', 'stage', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things.Okwe', 'also', 'sharing', 'apartment', 'young', 'Turkish', 'woman', 'named', 'Senay', 'pron', 'Shinai', 'However', 'Senay', 'immigration', 'status', 'pending', 'time', 'not', 'allowed', 'employment-presumably', 'kind', 'assistance', 'Okwe', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'Baltic', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'immigration', 'officials', 'Okwe', 'also', 'engaged', 'getting', 'money', 'side', 'collusion', 'Russian', 'doorman', 'Ivan', 'where', 'sell', 'food', 'hotel', 'customers', 'when', 'kitchens', 'are', 'closed', 'tough', 'life', 'indeed', 'Okwe', 'chews', 'leaves', 'away', 'necessity', 'sleep.One', 'evening', 'Okwe', 'human', 'heart', 'lodged', 'toilet', 'one', 'rooms', 'What', 'happened', 'room', 'dissuaded', 'investigating', 'oily', 'Juan', 'manager', 'who', 'calling', 'police', 'will', 'require', 'identify', 'would', 'lead', 'being', 'discovered', 'illegal', 'Even', 'Ivan', 'not', 'concern', 'who', 'who', 'However', 'immigrants', 'are', 'so', 'desperate', 'will', 'resort', 'doing', 'something', 'very', 'hazardous', 'get', 'visa', 'passport', 'little', 'wasp', 'Okwe', 'head', 'wasp', 'reason', 'why', 'left', 'country', 'ultimately', 'survivor', 'human', 'being.Senay', 'though', 'job', 'sweatshop', 'following', 'close', 'encounter', 'immigration', 'when', 'forced', 'do', 'sexual', 'favours', 'sweatshop', 'boss', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'cousin', 'lives', 'needs', 'work', 'order', 'get', 'money', 'desperate', 'act', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'what', 'ultimately', 'stirs', 'Okwe', 'action', 'where', 'must', 'call', 'sorts', 'favours.As', 'desperate', 'hard-working', 'ultimately', 'conscientious', 'Okwe', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'definitely', 'strong', 'presence', 'film', 'be', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'toughest', 'role', 'ever', 'Senay', 'far', 'cry', 'Amelie', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute', 'Maria', 'going', 'hardships', 'ordinary', 'non-immigrants', 'would', 'never', 'go', 'more', 'just', 'romantic', 'idealist', 'Amelie', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'Angelique', 'A', 'La', 'Folie', 'Pas', 'Du', 'Tout', 'well', 'speaking', 'English', 'non-French', 'accent', 'Yes', 'film', 'Tautou', 'real', 'actress', 'something', 'already', 'knew', 'Amelie.In', 'one', 'earlier', 'films', 'My', 'Beautiful', 'Launderette', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'explored', 'different', 'side', 'immigrants', 'race', 'relations', 'affluent', 'Pakistanis', 'poor', 'unskilled', 'whites', 'Here', 'more', 'sordid', 'situation', 'who', 'leave', 'homeland', 'search', 'better', 'opportunities', 'freedom', 'only', 'find', 'are', 'trapped', 'neverending', 'cycle', 'fear', 'poverty', 'Okwe', 'Senay', 'who', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'be', 'cousin', 'are', 'dreams', 'only', 'survival']",Dirty Pretty Things

Director Stephen Frears leads the cast and crew to completing this unique film.  The plot brilliantly combines drama and mystery while exploring the dark side of the characters' lives.  The interesting chain of events keep audiences' eyes wide open through every scene.  The moment a hotel clerk discovers a human heart in a toilet at his work, the theme's darkness becomes more intense and expresses more of the characters' lives at the moment.  However, it's not what many may think.  There's no serial killer on the loose, there's no demonic possessions.  However, there is blackmail.  The truths behind the human heart leads a friend and him to reveal secrets for the first time and to face their painful pasts.  Their struggles to stay in England become harder as they face the threat of deportation and prison time.  The emotional aspect of it is intensely heartfelt through the words, the environmental surroundings, and the performances.  Though all the performances are great, Audrey Tautou (&quot;Amelie&quot;) and Chiwetel Ejiofor's are the most unforgettable.  Through every struggle, they express their character's pain beautifully.

Both actors convey the desperate optimism immigrants hang on to despite frequent setbacks. What is most interesting about this story (and I'm sure Frears will take some flak for this from some P.C. quarters) is that, with the exception of a corrupt civil servant here and there, most of the ""bad guys"" who exploit the immigrants are-- (ready for this?) fellow immigrants! I have to mention the performance by Sergi Lopez, who specializes in creepy yet charismatic characters (see my review of ""With A Friend Like Harry"").

Senay, played by Audrey Tautou of 'Amelie' fame, is one of these immigrants, a Moslem girl from Turkey who desires nothing but to live in New York.

Helping her is Nigerian exile, Okwe, a doctor in his own country, now working as a cab driver and a desk clerk at a hotel.

(Sergi Lopez of 'A Friend Like Harry') Okwe's own moral base is tested to the limit as he realizes that Senay has come to rely on him for much more than just her sanity.Bottom Line:  'Dirty Pretty Things' engages the audience from start to finish; those expecting Tautou to have the lead role, don't be surprised when Chiwetel Ejiofor steals the show with his liquid chocolate eyes that reverberate with nuanced emotions.

Okwe works by his own strong morals, hampered by a dark secret. But one day Okwe makes a grisly discovery in the hotel where he works -- a clog in a toilet that turns out to be a human heart.His boss Juan (Sergi Lopez) tells him to not say anything. Does Okwe obey him? Of course not. He digs deeper, and soon uncovers a sinister web that hits close to the heart: Desperate immigrants sell their organs in exchange for forged papers and passports. As the immigration officials start to close in on Okwe and Senay, they must figure out what to do about the organ smuggling ring.A lot of movie moralizing is contrived and poorly-scripted. But Stephen Frears manages to stick the moral dilemmas in the faces of the viewers and make them stick. Okwe's conflicted feelings when he discovers the organ trafficking are wonderful, especially as he himself is a doctor who could help people, but working for an evil man. Similarly we see Senay, a religious girl, in a slow, inexorable downward slide.We see many immigrants, all with different dreams, goals, and pasts. And Frears makes them all come alive. He shows London as a city with a dark underbelly, with plenty of sinister big buildings where immigrant workers struggle to remain anonymous. Most sinister of all: That people will sell their organs or their bodies in order to find a better life.Audrey Tatou shatters the public perception of her in &quot;Dirty Pretty Things,&quot; shifting into the role of a trodden-on Turkish maid. She's absolutely masterful, fragile and sad. Chiwetel Ejiofor brings wonderful expressiveness and dignity to his role, but doesn't have quite the dimension of Lopez or Tatou. Sergi Lopez is one of the best screen villains in quite some time, absolutely making the screen sparkle. But you'll hate his guts.

He works constantly--hotel at night, and taxi-driving in the day. He uncovers the black market scheme one night at the hotel, aftering finding a human heart in a hotel lavatory.

At the same time, she is being hounded by two immigration officials, ready to deport her for working as an illegal alien.  She is nearly starving, and is forced to work in a sweat shop when she has to flee the hotel. Both Okwe and Shanai are tempted by the black market trade: giving up a kidney will get you a passport.  With a passport they would not have to run from the officials anymore, and could live peacefully.The acting was superb, I truly believed in the characters, and their plight.  Chiwetel Ejiofor has a subtle, yet commanding presence on screen, and his strength played well with Tatou's demure and naive character. _Dirty Pretty Things_ is Tatou's English language debut, and she did a remarkable job.

Although she shared the story of Dirty Pretty Things equally with the character played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, she did an excellent job of playing a Muslim immigrant living in England.It's sad to say that although the West symbolizes a better life for people from other countries, it is not always easy to be an immigrant, much less for illegals.  In this movie, Audrey plays Senay, a Turkish immigrant who for reasons I didn't quite get was not allowed to work.  When I was a legal resident alien of the USA decades ago, I wasn't allowed to work either so it may be the same thing.  Anyway, Okwe, played by Chiwetel, is a Nigerian doctor who fled his country because he was accused of killing his wife.  He works as a taxi driver by day and hotel clerk at night.  He and Senay work in the same hotel and Senay sub-lets her apartment to him.They are constantly harassed by authorities and what made matters worse is Okwe's discovery of a black market operation dealing with body organs taken mostly from illegal aliens, happening right there in the hotel.

I felt confident that Sergi Lopez's performance would match his previous and equally bizarre/unusual performances in other films. Here, Lopez is sleazy and the worst kind of criminal, using vulnerabilities against those who essentially have no other alternative but to cooperate with him. Lopez has such an expressive face that manages to convey so much without actually conveying anything. You can't read him, and this gives all his characters a sort of impenetrable, mysterious quality.In the film, a Nigerian illegal worker in London works three jobs and reveals very little about himself to those around him. It is not entirely clear early on from what he is trying to escape. He just works constantly, never sleeps and rents a couch from a Turkish immigrant (played by Audrey Tautou). Tautou's character is extremely cautious in case she is caught illegally working or accepting rent from the Nigerian.The film chronicles the growing friendship between the two (Okwe and Senay) while a sordid mystery unfolds surrounding shady dealings in the hotel where both of them are employed. Several events occur to cause problems both for Okwe and Senay, but in the end the film resolves the issues at hand and loose ends are tied.The `underworld' of illegal immigrants can be a gritty world, basically full of regular people who just want to make a better life for themselves but are forced into uncertain and unsavory circumstances because of their status in society.

Exploited by their employers, chased by immigration officers, these are people who are constantly on the edge of losing everything.

Simply stated, the story is an inside view of how a group of immigrants (mostly illegal) in London survive, having escaped their home country for promise of a better life and yet not really finding it in the threat of living sub rosa in the underbelly of London.  Okwe (Chiwetel Eijiofor in an amazingly sensitive portrayal) has immigrated from Nigeria where he was a physician mistakenly accused of killing his wife but now works as a taxi driver and a hotel clerk just to survive. He ends up rooming with a hotel maid Senay (the always impressive Audrey Tautou as a Turkish immigrant) and with her assistance discovers a black market operation where human organs are obtained from desperate immigrants and sold to 'respectable' physicians for transplants.  In their attempt to avoid being deported by the police, Okwe and Senay join with hooker Juliette (Sophie Okonedo), morgue tender Guo Yi (Benedict Wong) and the all important doorman to the hotel, Ivan (Zlatki Busic) to trick the hotel manager Sneaky/Juan (Sergi Lopez), who masterminds the organ harvesting, into inadvertently aiding their escape to other countries to resolve their lives.  Though the story alone is rich in character detail and interest, it is the underplayed vulnerability of the wonderful immigrants that  captures our hearts and makes us examine the plight of this unappreciated 'underclass' of people who live on hope.

Intriguing beginning propels the relevant, and both tragic and comedic story forword with layers of dynamic social commentary concerning the plight of unfortunate lives in underground London.

It tells the story of Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a Nigerian living in London illegally. He works two jobs: one as a taxi driver and the other inside a second-rate hotel. This doesn't give him much time to do anything, but work. When it is time to rest, he has an unusual living arrangement with Senay (Audrey Tautou), a Turkish immigrant that also works at the hotel. They share the same flat, but never occupy it at the same time.One night, while Okwe is working at the hotel, he is asked to check on a room and discovers a human heart. When he tells his boss Sneaky Juan (Sergi L&oacute;pez), he's told to keep quiet or he'll risk deportation. This causes Okwe to have a moral dilemma, which drives this fascinating story of the underside of London live.Without revealing too much of the plot, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" keeps raising the stakes and makes you really care about the plight of the main characters.Fans of the international hit ""Am&eacute;lie,"" might be a bit surprised by Ms. Tautou's performance as Senay. Some might find her work shocking, but it clearly indicates that Tautou is an actor unafraid of taking risks. She and Mr. Ejiofor are a pleasure to watch on screen together.Okwe is reminiscent of some of Sidney Poitier's early films. He's sensitive, noble and has strong moral convictions. That's something you don't see much in film today. Ejiofor's performance is all the more remarkable given the world in which his character lives in. Okwe is surrounded by morally bankrupt people that will do anything to become British citizens. He stands tall in the face of many temptations.While a fascinating and provocative film, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" may not be for everybody. However, if you're looking for an intelligent story with complex characters and don't mind venturing into a seedy world, this film is for you.",5,Tightly Structured Thriller With Something To Say,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,1960,"[""n't"", 'often', 'see', 'well-crafted', 'thriller', 'something', 'mind', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'one', 'films', 'story', 'Okwe', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Nigerian', 'living', 'London', 'illegally', 'two', 'jobs', 'one', 'taxi', 'driver', 'other', 'second-rate', 'hotel', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'time', 'do', 'anything', 'work', 'When', 'time', 'rest', 'unusual', 'living', 'arrangement', 'Senay', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Turkish', 'immigrant', 'also', 'hotel', 'share', 'same', 'flat', 'never', 'occupy', 'same', 'time.One', 'night', 'Okwe', 'working', 'hotel', 'asked', 'check', 'room', 'human', 'heart', 'When', 'boss', 'Sneaky', 'Juan', 'Sergi', 'L', 'oacute', 'pez', 'told', 'keep', 'quiet', ""'ll"", 'risk', 'deportation', 'Okwe', 'have', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'fascinating', 'story', 'underside', 'London', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'raising', 'stakes', 'really', 'care', 'plight', 'main', 'characters.Fans', 'international', 'hit', 'Am', 'eacute', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'surprised', 'Ms.', 'Tautou', 'performance', 'Senay', 'might', 'find', 'work', 'shocking', 'clearly', 'Tautou', 'actor', 'unafraid', 'taking', 'risks', 'Mr.', 'Ejiofor', 'are', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'screen', 'together.Okwe', 'reminiscent', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'early', 'films', 'sensitive', 'noble', 'strong', 'moral', 'convictions', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'film', 'today', 'Ejiofor', 'performance', 'more', 'remarkable', 'given', 'world', 'character', 'Okwe', 'surrounded', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'people', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'become', 'British', 'citizens', 'tall', 'face', 'many', 'fascinating', 'provocative', 'film', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everybody', 'However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'intelligent', 'story', 'complex', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'venturing', 'seedy', 'world', 'film']",Dirty Pretty Things

What is a kidney if you die afterwards? You won't need it any more.That's where the film is light since they do not check blood groups and other little details like that important for grafting, but we can suspend our scientific and medical disbelief for just one hour and a half.A Nigerian man lives in clandestine nothingness because of his situation in his own country. He is a doctor and he finally accepts to operate on the Turkish woman for a passport too and some money. The film becomes tricky then. The Turkish woman will keep her kidney and her new passport. The Nigerian doctor will operate and deliver a kidney on ice and you will have to find out on what market he found that kidney by watching the film.All that is perfectly immoral even if the twist in the fabric makes it ethically acceptable, yet it is deeply inhumane and inhuman and barbaric and unacceptable.

Therefore, going into the theatre, I half expected a thriller and/or horror genre film.  While it is certainly atypical of what most viewers would define as horror, Dead Pretty Things is both gripping and sublime in its unsettling exploration into the lives of the underclass, or perhaps more apt named, the ignored class.  The film centers around the exploits of a group Londoners who just happen to be illegal aliens fighting to survive and make a place for themselves in the ""civilized"" world.  They are for the most part a loyal bunch of compatriots who struggle to make an honest living, to realize their dreams, and to do all of it whilst avoiding both immigration police and unscrupulous individuals out to exploit their desperation.  In the film, we observe their failures and successes, and we empathize with their tough choices.  This is a human film about real horror - those things that would force a person to sell his/her body and dreams just to survive, and the toll it takes on the human heart.  But these are not perpetual victims.  The film offers a glimmer of hope for those brave enough to seize the day and remain true to their ideals, an in this way it is an empowering vision for the viewer.  The fact that the heroes of this film are the people who do the ""dirty work"" in modern society (the maids, the janitors, etc...) allows for a a refreshing look at the modern ""class"" distinctions in a way not too different from Robert Altman's Gosford Park.  This offering from Dangerous Liasons and High Fidelity director Stephen Frears is perhaps his most humane work yet, and it's worthy of a nod by the Academy.  The climax is a tad predictable and the denouement practically unsatisfying, but strong performances by Amelie's Audrey Tautou, and Amistad's Chiwetal Ejiofor propel this film through the back alleys and underbelly of urban life without the cliche angst typical of many Martin Scorsese films (and those who are influenced or try to duplicate his work).  While it certainly does not play out like a David Lynch film, there is a Blue Velvet sense to this film that pushes it over the edge into the quirky dark humor in the midst of troubling character study.

This young star does drama with the best. And either way, her enormous brown eyes would melt linoleum.Tatou plays Senay, an undocumented Turkish immigrant toiling in London's underground labor pool as a maid at the Hotel Baltic in an unprepossessing part of the city. The night shift desk clerk, Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor), also undocumented, is a Nigerian on the run from government persecution back home. In the old country, Okwe was a licensed physician. In London, besides his hotel gig, Okwe drives a cab using borrowed credentials. Senay surreptitiously allows Okwe, who hasn't a permanent residence, the use of her flat's couch to sleep on while she works the day shift.One morning, Okwe pulls a fresh human heart out of a plugged toilet in one of the hotel's rooms. Wishing to make it a police matter, Okwe brings the body part to the attention of the Baltic's day manager, Sneaky (Sergi Lopez), who persuades the former to let the matter rest by playing on his fear of discovery by Immigration. Besides, Sneaky advises, the job of a hotel is to PRETTY up the DIRTY THINGS that happen during the wee hours.If you're hoping to catch a glimpse of touristy London, forget it. I've been there more times than I can remember, and didn't spot anything I recognized - not even the Thames. This is London's gritty underbelly, the home of undocumented immigrants so desperate to reach someplace better that they risk death selling their body parts on the transplantable organs black market in exchange for passports and airline tickets. For instance, Senay longs for New York City, a place (she thinks) of lights in the trees and policeman on white horses, where she has a cousin.Tatou appears on American ads for DIRTY PRETTY THINGS perhaps because she's the only one of the actors potentially recognizable to U.S. audiences. However, Ejiofor is the film's lead, and his low key, excellent performance argues for more widespread exposure. Lopez's Sneaky is the sort of oily, disgusting villain that one loves to hate. Particularly endearing in a secondary role is Sophie Okonedo as Juliette, the effervescent hooker who uses the Baltic for her nightly trysts.DIRTY PRETTY THINGS is an unusual love story, a tale of righteous retribution, and an indictment of sordid conditions just around the corner and out of sight of the chirpy tour guide and her charges on their way to Buckingham Palace to have a chinwag with the Queen.

The complexity of Okwe's situation makes it impossible for him to go to the police, but his conscious tells him to be honorable.  However, Okwe has more problems with the immigration police and his past as he attempts to balance the issues at hand, which brings him more trouble.  Dirty Little Things is a good story that balances societal issues with a ghastly crime in an environment where laws cannot be applied.

And this British film explores the complex and very difficult life of those who live their lives in this shadow world.  To say that they are exploited is to phrase their dilemma too lightly.  Their lives are horrible and they are often forced into making choices that no human being should have to make.Chiwetel Ejiofor, an Afro-British actor shines in the role of Okwe, an Nigerian immigrant living in London.  He's been trained as a doctor and once practiced his trade in Laos.  But, as we learn during the course of the film, a tragedy caused him to leave that country and run for his life.  And so, now, by day he drives a cab and by night he works as a hotel porter.  In order to stay awake he chews the African drug that looks like grass.  And when he needs to sleep, a chambermaid, Senay, played by Audrey Tautou, an illegal immigrant from Turkey, lets him sleep in her apartment.One night, while trying to fix an overflowing commode, he discovers a body part in the toilet.  This leads him on a search to find out what is going on.  His discovery is chilling and it drives the plot as Senay is exploited by the owner of a clothing factory and makes a difficult decision in order to get a passport and flee to America.  Sergi Lopez plays the bad guy who runs an illegal business that preys on the desperation of the illegals.  However, the twists and turns of the plot lets justice prevail in the end.At first I found it difficult to understand the British accents, but eventually I was able to relax and get into the story.  As each detail emerged I developed a sense of empathy for the plight of these immigrants which deepened as the horror of their situtation became clear.  All the acting was authentic and excellent, especially by the bad guy.  And the London setting could have been any city in the world.This is a very modern story.  It's not pretty.  And rather dirty.

I walked away impressed by the edgy, quirky portrayal of harsh life in a large, cosmopolitan city (it was London, but it could have been anywhere in the world).I'm a bit stuck on Director Stephen Frears, and think his ""Dangerous Liasions"" to be perhaps one of the best character studies and most disturbing period pieces ever filmed.  I believe this was Audrey Tautou's (Senay) first film in English, and she did an admirable job as the vulnerable Turkish immigrant, whose fear of being discovered and imprisoned or deported grows.  Applause for both Tautou and Frears, and one of my favorite character actors, Sergi Lopez, who plays Juan, the repugnant night manager of the hotel.I came away, however, most admiring the film's central focus, the performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, (a virtual unknown, unless you struggled to get through ""Amistad"") as Okwe.  Okwe is a Nigerian immigrant with a secret past that he refuses to share.  His quiet persistence, and reluctance to get caught up in the gritty life of crime that Juan offers, are presented in a believable way.  You will agonize with him over the choices he must make to insure his and Senay's safety, all of which go against the grain of a ""man of character"".  He eventually solves the mystery of the hotel, but along the way we are treated to a masterful portrayal of his his attraction and protectiveness of Senay. In this capacity, Ejiofor is an awkward, tender man who finally realizes he is in love.There are moments of quiet horror at the degradation illegals must face to keep their status hidden.  The plot does twist in the final scenes, but the way in which it ends is unworthy of the drama that has unfolded through most of the film.  It is for this reason that I give it 4 stars.""Dirty, Pretty Things"" will hold no attraction for those seeking a thriller or a mystery.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[7, 7]","I have read many reviews appropriately commenting on the wonderful performance of Audrey Tautou as Turkish Immigrant Senay in Stephen Frears' ""Dirty Pretty Things"", but I haven't seen a comparable amount of words praising the tight, believable script and the wonderfully noble performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Okwe, a Doctor from Lagos on the run from authorities for reasons that are not revealed until well into the final act.  My favorite movies ares ones with strong leading characters who act with heroic nobleness.  I get an absolute thrill watching Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, or Humphrey Bogard as Rick Blaine, forcing Ilsa to get on that plane out of Casablanca because he loves her and knows there will be hell to pay to take any other course.  I love it when Indiana Jones is secretly watching the child slaves in ""Temple of Doom"" and he is just so outraged that without thinking he plunks a guard with a rock.Okwe is such a character.  He is a man of principles, working shoulder to shoulder with desperate people in a world without principles.  His status as an illegal alien makes it impossible for him to even think about working as a Doctor.  So to make ends meet he works two menial jobs. He drives a cab for a company with other drivers who routinely stop him in the back room to get treatment for their gonorrhea.  At his other job he works as night porter at the kind of hotel that has an hourly rate to accommodate the prostitutes who bring their work to these rooms.Okwe is the kind of man who plays chess and engages in deep, meaningful conversations for fun.  His friend Guo Yi works at the hospital morgue, loses to Okwe in chess, and procures antibiotics for all the cases of the drip back at the cab company.This movie also has several characters who see nothing wrong with exploiting the perpetually scared immigrants.  Two different characters force desperate young women into having sex rather than being reported to Immigration, and in this movie these coerced rapes are just tips of the seedy iceburg underbelly.The way the movie progresses was uplifting to me, though, although it would be too much of a spoiler to say why.  By the end I felt that the noble characters had escaped with their self-respect intact, and the two scumbags had received comeuppances of a painful sort.The cinematography was reminiscent of Tautou's other famous film, Amelie.

794855,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00018D3LE,Matthew Horner,"[1, 3]","""Dirty Pretty Things"" is part mystery, part thriller and part off-beat love story. It is also a brilliant portrait of the plight of illegal immigrants. Somewhat overlooked, this movie is one of 2003's best. It is a prime example of the axiom that `it's not what you say but how you say it'. Under Stephen Frears' assured direction, what could have been a mere soap opera becomes an insightful look at people in the crossroads of life.Okwe [Fjiofor] is a Nigerian working two jobs in London. He drives a taxi by day and works at the front desk of a hotel at night. He is an illegal immigrant, as are many of the people we meet, including Senay [Audrey Tautou], A Turkish woman who works as a maid at the hotel. Okwe sleeps on Senay's couch. Their relationship is chaste, mainly because of Senay's strict Muslim upbringing. That they are in love is apparent, but here we have a classic example of culture clash. Meanwhile, at the hotel, Sneaky [Lopez] rules the nefarious underworld that goes on underneath the hotel's proper exterior. Sneaky is the one that can get you a false passport for price. Or even a fresh kidney. Okwe and Senay detest Sneaky, but he is the one who can get them the things that they need.""Dirty Pretty Things"" is a first class adult movie.

He rents a couch, on which he catches an  occasional few minutes of sleep, in the apartment of Senay (Audrey Tautou), a young Turkish woman who works as a maid at the hotel. When tending to a backed up toilette at the hotel one night, Okwe  makes a bizarre discovery: Clogging the commode is a healthy human heart, obviously adrift from its owner. And so Okwe begins to unravel the hidden activities behind the respectable facade of the Baltic Hotel.&quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; is a hybrid atmospheric thriller and gritty drama, written by Steven Knight and directed by the brilliant Stephen Frears. The story takes place exclusively among normally &quot;invisible&quot; service workers: taxi drivers, maids, porters, and prostitutes. Telling a tale of people who go largely unnoticed, even as they perform tasks that make the city tick, gives the film a covert atmosphere that supports the seedy and suspenseful  narrative. The film's performances are outstanding. Chjwetel Ejiofor commands attention and inspires empathy as Okwe, an ethical man seemingly living in an unethical and intractable world. Audrey Tautou is sympathetic as Senay, who tries to preserve something of her culture's values while living in London's underbelly and dreaming of someplace better. Benedict Wong gives an interesting turn as a resident physician at a local hospital and friend of Okwe's. The most impressive performance may come from Sergi Lopez, a Spanish actor who does not speak English, but turns in a powerhouse performance as Juan, the hotel's manager, in English, nevertheless. I have to attribute the decision to hire two actors who didn't at the time speak English -Tautou and Lopez- to play key English-speaking roles to Stephen Frears' eccentricity. But it works remarkably well.&quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; is billed as a thriller, and although the film is a drama about disillusionment more than anything else, it plays by the rules of a thriller. It stretches credibility. I wouldn't have trouble believing what goes on in that hotel if it were in a third world country,but I don't buy it in London. It's not realistic. &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; gets away with this because it is so emotionally authentic. It's very effective as a character drama, and typically fantastic as a thriller. Writer Stephen Knight has imbued the film with enough comedy that the drama doesn't become oppressive, and it's a great credit to him that he was able to make us laugh, given the film's subject matter. This great script has a distinct subversive feel, and the film is filled with great character actors.  &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot; is an odd, atmospheric, but enjoyable hybrid mystery, with the kind of character writing that big budget thrillers can only dream of.The DVD: The extras aren't thrilling. Bonus features include a &quot;making of&quot; documentary entitled &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; and an audio commentary by director Stephen Frears. &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; is short and says very little.

All the major cities of Europe are where the refugees of the Africa and third world European and Asian third world countries head towards.  Like in America, they drift towards the jobs that no one else wants.Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) drives cabs during the days and is the night clerk for a tourist hotel at night.  Okwe is a doctor from Lagos.  He is a political fugitive and was framed for the murder of his wife.  He is sharing a flat with one of the maids, Senay (Audrey Tautou).  She is a refugee from Turkey.  Her hope is to eventually immigrate to New York City.One night the hotel hooker, Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) reports to Okwe an overflowing toilet in the room that she just used.  Okwe goes to the room and dislodges a human heart from the toilet.  He report it to the hotel manager Senior Juan (Sergi Lopez).  But he is not too concerned over it.Complications begin to occur.  First immigration goes to Senay's apartment and finds evidence that she might be working.  That night they go to the hotel but Okwe is able to warn her.  Now she must find another job.  When Okwe goes to pick up her final pay from the hotel, he runs into a Somolian man and his son in the manager's office.  The son has an infected wound from a kidney removal.  Okwe puts it all together that the manager is in the black market organ business.With immigration after her, Senay cannot get a job and agrees to sell her kidney for a passport.  Okwe agrees to perform the operation for a passport for himself.  But he has something more in mind.This is a film of unusual insight and passion.  This is a great film that shows what immigrants must do to have a better life.  What it really shows is that the people who prey on the immigrants are their own.Both Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou give compelling performances and director Stephen Frears gives up one of his truly personal films that demands to be seen.DVD EXTRA: 6 minute making of featurette.",5,The Underside of Immigrant Life,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,2028,"['Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'world', 'refugees', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'London', 'major', 'cities', 'Europe', 'are', 'where', 'refugees', 'Africa', 'third', 'world', 'European', 'Asian', 'third', 'world', 'countries', 'head', 'towards', 'America', 'drift', 'jobs', 'one', 'else', 'wants.Okwe', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'cabs', 'days', 'night', 'clerk', 'tourist', 'hotel', 'night', 'Okwe', 'doctor', 'Lagos', 'political', 'fugitive', 'was', 'framed', 'murder', 'wife', 'sharing', 'flat', 'one', 'maids', 'Senay', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'refugee', 'Turkey', 'hope', 'eventually', 'immigrate', 'New', 'York', 'City.One', 'night', 'hotel', 'hooker', 'Juliette', 'Sophie', 'Okonedo', 'reports', 'Okwe', 'overflowing', 'toilet', 'room', 'just', 'used', 'Okwe', 'room', 'human', 'heart', 'toilet', 'report', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Senior', 'Juan', 'Sergi', 'Lopez', 'not', 'too', 'concerned', 'it.Complications', 'begin', 'occur', 'First', 'immigration', 'Senay', 'apartment', 'evidence', 'might', 'be', 'working', 'night', 'go', 'hotel', 'Okwe', 'able', 'warn', 'Now', 'must', 'find', 'job', 'When', 'Okwe', 'pick', 'up', 'final', 'pay', 'hotel', 'Somolian', 'man', 'son', 'manager', 'office', 'son', 'infected', 'wound', 'kidney', 'removal', 'Okwe', 'together', 'manager', 'black', 'market', 'organ', 'immigration', 'Senay', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'sell', 'kidney', 'passport', 'perform', 'operation', 'passport', 'something', 'more', 'mind.This', 'film', 'unusual', 'insight', 'passion', 'great', 'film', 'what', 'immigrants', 'must', 'do', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'What', 'really', 'people', 'who', 'prey', 'immigrants', 'are', 'own.Both', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'give', 'compelling', 'performances', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'up', 'one', 'truly', 'personal', 'films', 'be', 'seen.DVD', 'EXTRA', '6', 'minute', 'making', 'featurette']",Dirty Pretty Things

It's the story of immigrants and how people take advantage of them.  Audrey Tautou and Chiwetel Ejiofor play the main characters, doing whatever they have to to get by.  In their world you have to sell some of your own soul to exist.  The hotel where both of them have jobs (one of several) there is an illegal human organ trade going on.  Human trafficking in several forms goes on and you wonder what you would do if you were in those same circumstances.  The main male character, who is so upstanding, yet even he succumbs at times in order to survive, doing things like borrowing customers shoes at the hotel, etc.  Other immigrants sell their organs to obtain money and a new passport and new identity.  Everything is for sale.  But it also shows a tight community where the immigrants look out for each other while they hope for something more. The main male character played by Chiwetel Ejiofor is a man of honor, constantly torn between what he must do to survive.  But in his little illegal world people know they can count of him as he is a doctor from Nigeria, and works hard and grapples with his scruples.In the midst of all of it is a sweet love story.

But his forte is a movie with a good premise, good atmosphere, good characters, and nothing happens. Examples include the Irish Catholic comedy, ""The Snapper,"" which has all the right elements, but not much happens and there are really no laughs. ""Liam"" is also a great setup, but nothing happens. Even his highly regarded ""Dangerous Liasons"" was a yawner. Now BBC Movies funds Frears to do it again. We have great London locations, good actors playing interesting characters (especially our protagonist, an educated Nigerian immigrant working odd jobs), and a setup spoiled in the other reviews, namely that a nefarious activity is taking place in the hotel in which he works. But once we are introduced to the characters and the nefarious activity in the first 20 minutes, every single scene is a repetition, either of our protagonist telling his Turkish immigrant roommate/love interest to stay away from him so that her immigration status isn't put in jeapardy, or our protagonist trying to decide whether to inform on the hotel manager but be deported in the process, or just keep clammed up. My girlfriend and I kept laughing that every single scene was a repetition of one of these two templates, until a predictable ending. One frustrating thing is that both my girlfriend and I kept yelling at the screen: ""Have you ever heard of an anonymous tip to the police?""

A mystery, a romance, horror, social commentary...? I think I'd call it a thriller with a heart and soul, and it all begins with a hotel clerk finding a human heart stuck in an overflowing toilet.The setting is London, the characters are primarily illegal immigrants trying to stay one step ahead of deportation. Some of them are so desperate to get legal that they're willing to trade their body parts for a passport. Okwe, the hotel clerk, was a doctor in Nigeria before some secret that's not revealed till the end of the film forced him to flee. Shenay, Audrey Tatou (she of Amelie fame), is a Turkish maid at the hotel and Okwe's friend. There's a rogue of a doorman who is an opportunist with a good heart; there's a hooker with an even better heart; and there's without a doubt the best villain ever created, Juan, the manager of the hotel. He doesn't have a moustache, but he's so slick and smarmy and smiling that you can just see him in a top hat, twirling his moustache and plotting the maiden's downfall in return for her virtue.Ordered by Juan to ignore the disembodied heart, Okwe does the opposite: he digs into the soft and smelly underbelly of blackmarket body organ trafficking. And when desperate Shenay appears to be headed down that road, things get really, really, really interesting, complete with quirky, brilliant denouement.You'll love it.",5,What a terrific cross-genre film,1083110400,"04 28, 2004",2004,1444,"['What', 'film', 'so', 'difficult', 'stick', 'label', 'thriller', 'mystery', 'romance', 'horror', 'social', 'commentary', 'think', ""'d"", 'call', 'thriller', 'heart', 'soul', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'finding', 'human', 'heart', 'stuck', 'overflowing', 'toilet.The', 'setting', 'London', 'characters', 'are', 'primarily', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'trying', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'deportation', 'are', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'legal', ""'re"", 'willing', 'trade', 'body', 'parts', 'passport', 'Okwe', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'was', 'doctor', 'Nigeria', 'secret', 'not', 'revealed', 'end', 'film', 'forced', 'flee', 'Shenay', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'Amelie', 'fame', 'Turkish', 'maid', 'hotel', 'Okwe', 'friend', 'rogue', 'doorman', 'who', 'opportunist', 'good', 'heart', 'hooker', 'even', 'better', 'heart', 'doubt', 'best', 'villain', 'ever', 'created', 'Juan', 'manager', 'hotel', ""n't"", 'have', 'moustache', 'so', 'slick', 'smarmy', 'smiling', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'top', 'hat', 'twirling', 'moustache', 'plotting', 'maiden', 'downfall', 'return', 'virtue.Ordered', 'Juan', 'ignore', 'disembodied', 'heart', 'Okwe', 'opposite', 'soft', 'smelly', 'underbelly', 'blackmarket', 'body', 'organ', 'trafficking', 'when', 'desperate', 'Shenay', 'be', 'headed', 'down', 'road', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'interesting', 'complete', 'quirky', 'brilliant', 'denouement.You', ""'ll"", 'love']",Dirty Pretty Things

Not so with this one you do have a mystery to figure out. (do yourself a favor don't read all of the reviews because some of them have spoilers) There are 2 mysteries the main one is where did the heart come from/who the heart belongs to and what is up with Okwe's past? I went not knowing what to expect and I enjoyed the unexpected :) I agree with what everyone else has written, the actors in this movie did a most impressive job Okwe's character was Credible, Sanay (Tautou)was believable, Juliette (the hooker) was likable and even the friend of Okwe that worked in the Morgue was essential to the plot. Fine performances by all.Having worked in hotels for most of my life I found this movie disturbing and a very dark look at the Graveyard shift LOL I definately felt the plight of all the illegal immigrants in London, someone else mentioned that they did not like that, that is ALL the director showed... well my feeling is that this movie is about just that or just them and exsposing the desperate lengths these human beings are willing to go through for a better life.

Maids, janitors, late-night hotel clerks, taxi drivers, and the like.  These are the people the film chooses to focus on, to give us some insight, and maybe to make us notice those we normally would not.Okwe is the central character of the film.  Early on, we find out he once was a doctor in another country, but now he's living in London and working as both a cab driver by day and a hotel clerk by night.  He lacks a place to live of his own, so he's sharing an apartment with a maid at the same hotel, a young Turkish girl named Senay.  He has many other friends throughout the city, all expatriates of one kind or another, now living in London and most of them doing odd jobs.  Through the story of the film we come to know each of these people, the ones who normally slip under our radar.The characters are well-drawn,  but not at the sacrifice of the story.  It grabs you right away, as Okwe is investigating a room just vacated in the hotel and discovers a heart stuck in the pipes of the toilet.  A human heart.  Okwe's dark discovery in the hotel room leads to him uncovering further depredations, all of them pointing to the things that happen underneath the surface of ""civilized"" society.  These are the things that the title speaks of, the dirty things that we try to dress up and make pretty, but for those who actually experience them, they are still disgusting and unwanted.As Okwe learns more about what is going on, we learn more about why he is in London, and why he is not a practicing physician...and just who he really is.  We find that he's doing what he's doing and he is where is he is because he wants to stay under the radar, because he doesn't want to be noticed.  The reasons for this will doubtless surprise you.  When Okwe says, late in the film, ""We are the people you do not see,"" we understand that this is how he prefers it. He's an intelligent, caring man...and he avoids notice as much as possible.Senay, played by Audrey Tautou, is the other main character in the movie.  If you're expecting Tautou to reprise her sprightly performance from ""Amelie,"" think again -- Senay could not be less like Amelie.  Senay is nervous, a little cold, and very serious.  Tautou turns in a fine performance here, and she certainly adds extra dimension to the film.  It is through Senay that we finally get the full picture of Okwe and his motivations, and it is also through her that another face is put on the faceless ones, the ones we do not see.""Dirty Pretty Things"" is not a happy movie. It's not a movie you see to feel good.

The film is part horror story as a hotel clerk from Nigeria discovers that the hotel is being used for an illegal human organ scheme. Chiwetel Ehiiofor is very strong in the lead role and Audrey Tautou does well as a Turkish immigrant who is struggling to survive and escape London for New York. Where the movie bogged down a bit for me is in some of the moralizing dialogue gets to be a bit too contrived and not true to character.

The paragraph long description in the newspaper sounded like something akin to a mystery / slasher flick.  Leaving the movie, TOTALLY THRILLED I had come, I'm still at a loss as to how to describe it.It IS a mystery.  But it's also a romance.  And a socio-political commentary.  And a rich character drama.  And even a sly comedy from time to time.It deals with the ""sub-culture"" of illegal workers in England, living under the radar and all working in a posh but seedy hotel in London.  They come from all over the world, and live in great poverty, afraid of making too many waves.  We are introduced to a desk clerk from Africa, a man who fled his country for a ""crime he didn't commit"" and now is just getting by.  When called to a hotel room about some faulty plumbing, he discovers a human heart clogging the toilet!  Sounds like a slasher flick, right?  Not hardly.  This is only the jumping off point for a movie that is so tender in its characterizations that I have rarely rooted more avidly for its principals.This is a movie for adults, of course, and also for adults who don't mind a movie that has a lot of plot threads on its mind.

794876,A379FTDQT1NKSN,B00018D3LE,Robert Pratte,"[5, 6]","My wife and I have been Audrey Tautou fans ever since we saw Amelie.  We loved the cute, outside-the-box type that she played in that film.  We likewise loved her similar character in her earlier film, Happenstance.  While her (minor) character in The Spanish Apartment was different from these other characters, her outside-the-box personality was apparent enough to think that she must be typecast for this role.  However, we were in for a bit of a shock with Dirty Pretty Things.  Whereas the above films demonstrate the positive aspects of humanity, here was our heroine embroiled in a story that showed humanity in pain and at its worst.  Yet, she is still quirky and still an outsider - but everyone in Dirty Pretty Things is too.This film gives us a world of contraries. Tautou (Senay) is surrounded by these oppositions, living as a Turkish immigrant struggling to pay bills with a VISA that doesn't permit her to work.  Moreover, she holds traditional values, but is forced to share her apartment with a man in order to make ends meet.  Thus, she avoids the reality of her situation, side-stepping the immigration officials as well as the guy she is sharing a living space with.Her roommate, Okwe, is likewise surrounded by contraries; a former doctor working as a hotel clerk, he was forced to leave his own country and is something of a wanted man.  Further, he is a quiet man who, while at work, discovers a sinister secret - a human heart was flushed down a hotel toilet.While both Senay and Okwe are people who would seem to have a tenuous hold on security, and thus very much to lose, as this thriller moves forward it seems instead that they have absolutely nothing to lose.  The conditions of immigrants among the underclass are horrible, and the film brings these details into stark view.  Where the discovery of the heart is shocking, the trials of our pair of roommates, and those around them, is even more deeply disturbing.The real triumph of this film, however, is how it brings the unseemly side of life forward.  Just under the facade of the hotel lies something ugly, and we, as viewers, begin to question how much ugliness lies underneath the facades we see every day.The downside to this film, however, is its predictability as a thriller.  While nothing is held back (in terms of human suffering), the actions of those involved seem to toe the line.  Perhaps this is just another aspect of the unsettling realism - that given a certain set of circumstances, our actions would be predicable.  On the other hand, it seems that the thriller aspects of this film take a back seat (and I'd venture to say intentionally so) to the dramatic.",4,"Disturbing, doesn't hold back, but somehow predictable",1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,2663,"['wife', 'have', 'been', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'fans', 'ever', 'saw', 'Amelie', 'loved', 'cute', 'outside-the-box', 'type', 'played', 'film', 'likewise', 'loved', 'similar', 'character', 'earlier', 'film', 'Happenstance', 'minor', 'character', 'Spanish', 'Apartment', 'was', 'different', 'other', 'characters', 'outside-the-box', 'personality', 'was', 'apparent', 'enough', 'think', 'must', 'be', 'typecast', 'role', 'However', 'were', 'bit', 'shock', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'above', 'films', 'demonstrate', 'positive', 'aspects', 'humanity', 'here', 'was', 'heroine', 'embroiled', 'story', 'showed', 'humanity', 'pain', 'worst', 'still', 'quirky', 'still', 'outsider', 'everyone', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'too.This', 'film', 'world', 'contraries', 'Tautou', 'Senay', 'surrounded', 'oppositions', 'living', 'Turkish', 'immigrant', 'struggling', 'pay', 'bills', 'VISA', ""n't"", 'permit', 'work', 'Moreover', 'traditional', 'values', 'forced', 'share', 'apartment', 'man', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Thus', 'reality', 'situation', 'side-stepping', 'immigration', 'officials', 'as', 'well', 'guy', 'sharing', 'living', 'space', 'with.Her', 'roommate', 'Okwe', 'likewise', 'surrounded', 'contraries', 'former', 'doctor', 'working', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'own', 'country', 'something', 'wanted', 'man', 'Further', 'quiet', 'man', 'who', 'work', 'sinister', 'secret', 'human', 'heart', 'was', 'flushed', 'down', 'hotel', 'Senay', 'Okwe', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'tenuous', 'hold', 'security', 'thus', 'very', 'much', 'lose', 'thriller', 'forward', 'instead', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'lose', 'conditions', 'immigrants', 'underclass', 'are', 'horrible', 'film', 'details', 'stark', 'view', 'Where', 'discovery', 'heart', 'shocking', 'trials', 'pair', 'roommates', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'disturbing.The', 'real', 'triumph', 'film', 'however', 'how', 'unseemly', 'side', 'life', 'forward', 'Just', 'facade', 'hotel', 'something', 'ugly', 'viewers', 'begin', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'ugliness', 'facades', 'see', 'day.The', 'downside', 'film', 'however', 'predictability', 'thriller', 'nothing', 'held', 'back', 'terms', 'human', 'suffering', 'actions', 'involved', 'seem', 'toe', 'line', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'aspect', 'unsettling', 'realism', 'given', 'certain', 'set', 'circumstances', 'actions', 'would', 'be', 'predicable', 'other', 'hand', 'thriller', 'aspects', 'film', 'take', 'back', 'seat', ""'d"", 'venture', 'say', 'intentionally', 'so', 'dramatic']",Dirty Pretty Things

Ejiofor is Okwe, a Nigerian doctor who has illegally imigrated and must work two jobs--as a cab driver and a hotel clerk--to make ends meet.  Tatou is Senay, a young Turkish woman, who is still working on the equivalent of a ""green card"" and does not yet have citizen status.  Senay works at the same hotel as Okwe and lets him rent space in her apartment.  Both are tightly wound and neither are entirely comfortable with the others' presence.When Okwe finds a heart in one of the hotel's toilets during his shift, he is shocked and upset.  He tells the hotel manager what he has found, only to be told that he should ignore it.  Inevitably Okwe finds himself in the middle of a sordid business and blackmail, with Senay caught up as well.I hate to be vague about the plot, but I don't want to spoil it either.  There are, however, a few loose ends, which ended up bothering me long after I was done watching the movie.  The acting makes up for it and Ejiofor's acting alone deserves five stars.  His eyes are so communicative and you can really feel the weight of his sense of duty and his powerlessness as an illegal alien.  I appreciated the way the movie makes you think about people in menial jobs--doesn't do to underestimate the people around you--though I think the message was a little heavy handed right at the end.  Tatou is also very good and the character of Senay is very, very different from that of Amelie.

Well, I bought my friend dinner afterwards as thanks, it was so good!I love all kinds of movies, but after a summer of blockbusters with little or no characterization or originality I was ready for an intelligent film. The timing of this film - the end of summer - couldn't have been better and I hope it gets the audience it deserves.First of all, although critics describe this as a thriller, that term really does this film a disservice. There aren't any of the typical thriller genre cliches such as the evil serial killer, girl with a fatal crush, intense soundtrack, etc. What this movie does is thoroughly and with artistic simplicity portray the plight of people seeking political asylum, a new life, in London, and trying to survive without citizenship status. They take the jobs no one else wants, network for health care from doctors outside the system and cadge temporary places to live out of empty offices.The actors are all supurb. Audrey Tautou is unrecognizable as the prankster from ""Amelie"" and Chiwetel Ejiofor exudes integrity combined with puppy-dog eyes.Also very fun are their friends, a hooker and a mortician with great senses of humor. (""Did you know she's in love with you? I've only known her for 10 minutes and even I know it. But then you know what they say - good at chess, bad at life. I stink at chess."")This is a subculture that is rarely portrayed, and never so honestly, nakedly. The title suits because the story flips from the pragmatic baring of flesh to check for syphilis; the beautiful Tautou forced to submit to her boss; to a human heart clogging a toilet. But you can't look away.Stephen Frears is a refreshing director who proves you don't need acrobatic cameras and MTV editing to tell a great, engrossing story. He states things without overstating or understating.If you're not into think pieces you probably won't enjoy this film. It can probably be enjoyed just as well on a small screen if you wish to wait for video.

Chjwetel Ejiofor is the main character, Okwe, who has a good heart (no pun intended), but is by no means a sappy boyscout-type.

In one of the opening scenes of the movie, Okwe finds a human (apparently) heart clogging up one of the guest rooms' toilet.  While this is a fascinating and chilling way to introduce us to the web of misdeeds that goes on in this hotel, it is a bit far-fetched.  Even given what we find out later (which I will not reveal), it seems a bit of a stretch to think that the ""bad guys"" would (a) remove the victim's heart in the first place, and (b) be so careless as to flush it down the toilet.Overall, however, this is a fantastic film, in which both the thriller and dramatic elements work perfectly.

Stephen Frears, an renowned director with some missteps, is on sure footing here. He maintains the tension of the characters' circumstances whlie trusting the leading actor to be the moral center of the film. Chiwetel Ejiodor is absolutey brilliant in his role of Okwe, an exiled Nigerian doctor, who stumbles upon a organ-selling scheme. Mr. Ejiodor imbues the charcter with a sense of non-judgemental righteousness that is just remarkable. Audrey Tautou is terrific as Senay, a young Turkish woman trying to get to New York.

It stands head and shoulders above the wreckage of most recent Britflicks, but it still never quite reaches the heights. Part of the problem is that the background is the story, leaving us with an at times slight narrative and a very predictable final twist that seems very much like one of Roald Dahl's Tales of the Very Much as We Expected (the moment Chiwetel Ejiofor stops Sergi Lopez's hands from shaking you know exactly what's coming).That said, it's still a worthwhile trip. Unlike most British films, and London ones in particular, it actually uses the city as a character - in this case the hidden city. We see virtually no ordinary British citizens. Instead the film is inhabited by the illegal immigrants who do the dirty jobs that no-one else wants, the lead character a Nigerian doctor who works double-shifts as taxi driver and hotel porter and rents a couch in Turkish maid Audrey Tatou's couch on a timeshare basis. This milieu is superbly captured, and you get a sense of a world not so much hidden as ignored. Frears direction too is back to the power and drive of his early work after his recent flabby American entries, although he still can't resist caricaturing the Immigration officials - rather than the bored, disinterested and impersonal reality he's opted for cheap comic book villains that diminishes every scene they appear in. Similarly, he doesn't always keep a tight enough rein on some of the supporting performances, Sophie Okenedo in particular: she can be a much better actress, but here she's allowed to veer too much to stereotype and has a couple of awkward moments. Lopez too falls back on some of his overfamiliar mannerisms, although Ejiofor is quite superb in the lead, and his easygoing scenes with Benedict Wong's mortuary waste disposal technician are minor highlights.Nonetheless, with most British cinema so awful these days, this is definitely worth catching: a very good film even if it could have been even better.The DVD transfer is fine but the extras are negligible - a brief featurette and a commentary with lots of dead air from Stephen Frears.",3,Slightly disappointing but still impressive,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",2004,2182,"['Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'was', 'once', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'head', 'shoulders', 'wreckage', 'most', 'recent', 'Britflicks', 'still', 'never', 'quite', 'heights', 'Part', 'problem', 'background', 'story', 'leaving', 'times', 'slight', 'narrative', 'very', 'predictable', 'final', 'twist', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'Tales', 'Very', 'Much', 'Expected', 'moment', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Sergi', 'Lopez', 'hands', 'shaking', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'coming', 'said', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'trip', 'most', 'British', 'films', 'London', 'ones', 'particular', 'actually', 'city', 'character', 'case', 'hidden', 'city', 'see', 'virtually', 'ordinary', 'British', 'citizens', 'Instead', 'film', 'inhabited', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'who', 'do', 'dirty', 'jobs', 'no-one', 'else', 'lead', 'character', 'Nigerian', 'doctor', 'who', 'double-shifts', 'taxi', 'driver', 'hotel', 'porter', 'couch', 'Turkish', 'maid', 'Audrey', 'Tatou', 'couch', 'timeshare', 'basis', 'milieu', 'superbly', 'captured', 'get', 'sense', 'world', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'hidden', 'ignored', 'Frears', 'direction', 'too', 'back', 'power', 'drive', 'early', 'work', 'recent', 'flabby', 'American', 'entries', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'caricaturing', 'Immigration', 'officials', 'rather', 'bored', 'disinterested', 'impersonal', 'reality', 'opted', 'cheap', 'comic', 'book', 'villains', 'scene', 'appear', 'Similarly', ""n't"", 'always', 'keep', 'tight', 'enough', 'rein', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Sophie', 'Okenedo', 'particular', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'actress', 'here', 'allowed', 'veer', 'too', 'much', 'stereotype', 'couple', 'awkward', 'moments', 'Lopez', 'too', 'back', 'overfamiliar', 'mannerisms', 'Ejiofor', 'quite', 'superb', 'lead', 'easygoing', 'scenes', 'Benedict', 'Wong', 'mortuary', 'waste', 'disposal', 'technician', 'are', 'minor', 'highlights.Nonetheless', 'most', 'British', 'cinema', 'so', 'awful', 'days', 'definitely', 'worth', 'catching', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'even', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'fine', 'extras', 'are', 'negligible', 'brief', 'featurette', 'commentary', 'lots', 'dead', 'air', 'Stephen', 'Frears']",Dirty Pretty Things

And the real star of the film is not her; it's Chiwetel Ejiofor as an illegal immigrant in London working at a hotel.Still want to see it?  You should, for the film's story is very sordid, the film itself is not depressing, keeping a thriller at its core.  Okwe (Ejiofor) is doing two jobs; one, as a taxi driver, and the other as a hotel clerk.  He shares a room (or a couch) with a girl Senay (Tautou), a Turkish exile who works at the same hotel.  But in London, she is not allowed to let him in the room, let alone to work, and she hides the facts from the authority.One night, however, their small precarious world starts to change, when Okwe finds something very nasty in the toilet of the hotel room.  He senses that the place is not what it seems; the hotel manager (perfect Sergi Lopez) knows more than a usual hotel manager should know, perhaps about the underground world of London.  The police, however, is not their option, as you can easily imagine.  What should they do?  Or can do?Besides the thriller story, you see the relations between Senay and Okwe develop into friendship, or perhaps something more.  With Stephen Frears as director, the film, while dealing wit the exploited people in the big city, never gets morbid or preachy.  (If morbid, that's because of the subject matter, not his direction.)I still suspect that Audrey Tautou's casting is not the best choice, for no matter what you try, her image as Amelie is too strong to be wiped out easily.  Still, her acting is good (though her accents are, I am afraid, hard to hear), and she shows that she is not just another starlet, who splashes her name on the front page, then is gone forever.The real star is Ejiofor, whose understated performace as the idealistic hero often looks too high-minded.  Wait, then, and you see he has his own reason to be so.  And also amazing is Sergi Lopez, best known for the role as the friendriest psycho in 'With a Freind Like Harry...'  He gives a convincing figure of a villain again.The best thing about the film is, probably, that while it gives two good stories, it does not preach to us, nor patronize the immigrants in London.  To call it entertainment might invite criticism, but it is a good one for sure, and that's not a bad thing at all.

He lives on the brink of an illegal world running from immigration authorities. This character is played nicely by Chiwetal Ejiofor.

Obviously, third-world immigration is a hot-button issue in many Western countries right now, with lots of inane sloganeering and generalization on both sides, and any movie dealing with the subject is going to find itself treading dangerous ground, but Dirty Pretty Things wisely works in its social points through its characters and story rather than starting with a social point and creating a bunch of implausible characters and contrived events to drive it home.  Its sympathetic view of London's immigrant population could easily get Dirty Pretty Things accused of being a politically correct pro-immigration film, but it's really more concerned with telling a personal, ground-level story of the sort of exploitation and hardship immigrants deal with than with advocating any particular agenda (though strangely, it seems to somewhat soft-pedal these difficulties, as the lives of the protagonists don't seem all that bad in light of the incredibly hard work and poverty immigrants often face).  Its principal characters are largely forgotten or ignored and living in the sort of morally vacuous urban underbelly that even a city's residents don't really see (or want to, for that matter), and the movie's harrowing, occasionally graphic examination of the a major city's underground economy is served well by Stephen Frears's gritty, almost documentary-style direction and the low-key dialogue of the script.In the main role, Chiwetel Ejiofor brings the appropriate level of depth and gravity to Okwe, a Nigerian-born doctor who came to England fleeing persecution and now finds himself pulling double duty as a taxi driver and hotel concierge in order to scratch out a modest living.  When he finds a human heart stuck in a toilet in one of his hotel's rooms, it ends up dragging him unwillingly into a black-market organ-selling ring that has immigrants trading kidneys for passports, where his skills could obviously come in pretty handy.  Eventually the intrigues Okwe discovers end up ensnaring Senay (Audrey Tautou), a Turkish Muslim girl secretly letting Okwe share her apartment and working as a maid at his hotel in order to skirt immigration rules.  Senay initally appears somewhat stereotypical in that she came to London seeking an easier life and dreams of someday going to New York without much in the way of a real reason, but she still turns out to be an interesting character as we see her struggle to reconcile the demands of her religion with the harsh realities of modern Western life.  Plus, her scenes with Okwe provide pretty much the only tender moments in a largely bleak and unforgiving film, not to mention the fact that she's pretty hot.Still, Ejiofor is both the dramatic and moral center of the film, and Ejiofor doesn't disappoint.  Anyone who remembers him as the creepily believable villain from last year's Serenity (a great movie, by the way) should be impressed but not surprised by his performance here, as his dignified and mostly understated portrayal conveys all the internal conflicts of a guy who faces some tough decisions and knows he frequently has to suppress his emotions in order to do the right thing.  Good as Ejiofor is, Sergi Lopez is probably even better as his smirking, smarmy boss Senor Juan (aka Sneaky), a foreigner himself who's not above exploiting his fellow immigrants in order to make a few extra bucks.  He provides Okwe with his entre into the illegal-organ trade, and while he's almost cartoonishly evil at times, he's generally personable and and rational enough for me to almost see where he's coming from, like him or not.Not everything in this movie works, as it can get a bit slow and dreary at times, and the climactic operation scene just before the end somewhat betrays the realism that characterizes most of what preceded it, but I'd be lying if I were to say I wasn't involved througout its running time (plus, the movie is barely 90 minutes long, so there isn't enough time for it to ever get truly tedious).  Overall, Dirty Pretty Things tells an interesting story while casting some light on a side of life that most of us rarely encounter, which gives this movie more to recommend it than most of what I've seen lately.  For those tired of Hollywood's endless succession of sequels, remakes, and TV adaptations, you could do a lot worse.",4,Not bad at all,1165104000,"12 3, 2006",2006,4626,"['Issue-oriented', 'movies', 'are', 'generally', 'risky', 'proposition', 'can', 'easily', 'give', 'excessive', 'manipulation', 'singlemindedness', 'American', 'History', 'X', 'mind', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Crash', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'offender', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'nice', 'counterexample', 'such', 'film', 'done', 'correctly', 'Obviously', 'third-world', 'immigration', 'hot-button', 'issue', 'many', 'Western', 'countries', 'right', 'now', 'lots', 'inane', 'sloganeering', 'generalization', 'sides', 'movie', 'dealing', 'subject', 'going', 'find', 'treading', 'dangerous', 'ground', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'wisely', 'social', 'points', 'characters', 'story', 'rather', 'starting', 'social', 'point', 'creating', 'bunch', 'implausible', 'characters', 'contrived', 'events', 'drive', 'home', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'London', 'immigrant', 'population', 'could', 'easily', 'get', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'accused', 'being', 'politically', 'correct', 'pro-immigration', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'concerned', 'telling', 'personal', 'ground-level', 'story', 'sort', 'exploitation', 'hardship', 'immigrants', 'deal', 'advocating', 'particular', 'agenda', 'strangely', 'somewhat', 'soft-pedal', 'difficulties', 'lives', 'protagonists', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'light', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'work', 'poverty', 'immigrants', 'often', 'face', 'principal', 'characters', 'are', 'largely', 'forgotten', 'ignored', 'living', 'sort', 'morally', 'vacuous', 'urban', 'underbelly', 'even', 'city', 'residents', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'want', 'matter', 'movie', 'harrowing', 'occasionally', 'graphic', 'examination', 'major', 'city', 'underground', 'economy', 'served', 'well', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'gritty', 'almost', 'documentary-style', 'direction', 'low-key', 'dialogue', 'script.In', 'main', 'role', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'appropriate', 'level', 'depth', 'gravity', 'Okwe', 'Nigerian-born', 'doctor', 'who', 'came', 'England', 'fleeing', 'persecution', 'now', 'pulling', 'double', 'duty', 'taxi', 'driver', 'hotel', 'concierge', 'order', 'scratch', 'out', 'modest', 'living', 'When', 'human', 'heart', 'stuck', 'toilet', 'one', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'up', 'dragging', 'unwillingly', 'black-market', 'organ-selling', 'ring', 'immigrants', 'trading', 'kidneys', 'passports', 'where', 'skills', 'could', 'obviously', 'come', 'pretty', 'handy', 'Eventually', 'intrigues', 'Okwe', 'discovers', 'end', 'up', 'ensnaring', 'Senay', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Turkish', 'Muslim', 'girl', 'secretly', 'letting', 'Okwe', 'share', 'apartment', 'working', 'maid', 'hotel', 'order', 'skirt', 'immigration', 'rules', 'Senay', 'initally', 'somewhat', 'stereotypical', 'came', 'London', 'seeking', 'easier', 'life', 'dreams', 'someday', 'going', 'New', 'York', 'much', 'way', 'real', 'reason', 'still', 'out', 'be', 'interesting', 'character', 'see', 'struggle', 'reconcile', 'demands', 'religion', 'harsh', 'realities', 'modern', 'Western', 'life', 'scenes', 'Okwe', 'provide', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'tender', 'moments', 'largely', 'bleak', 'unforgiving', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'pretty', 'hot.Still', 'Ejiofor', 'dramatic', 'moral', 'center', 'film', 'Ejiofor', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Anyone', 'who', 'creepily', 'believable', 'villain', 'last', 'year', 'Serenity', 'great', 'movie', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'impressed', 'not', 'surprised', 'performance', 'here', 'dignified', 'mostly', 'understated', 'portrayal', 'conveys', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'guy', 'who', 'tough', 'decisions', 'frequently', 'suppress', 'emotions', 'order', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'Good', 'Ejiofor', 'Sergi', 'Lopez', 'probably', 'even', 'better', 'smirking', 'smarmy', 'boss', 'Senor', 'Juan', 'Sneaky', 'foreigner', 'who', 'not', 'exploiting', 'fellow', 'immigrants', 'order', 'make', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'entre', 'illegal-organ', 'trade', 'almost', 'cartoonishly', 'evil', 'times', 'generally', 'personable', 'rational', 'enough', 'almost', 'see', 'where', 'coming', 'not.Not', 'everything', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'slow', 'dreary', 'times', 'climactic', 'operation', 'scene', 'just', 'end', 'somewhat', 'realism', 'most', 'what', 'preceded', ""'d"", 'be', 'lying', 'were', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'througout', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'barely', '90', 'minutes', 'long', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'ever', 'get', 'truly', 'tedious', 'Overall', 'Dirty', 'Pretty', 'Things', 'interesting', 'story', 'casting', 'light', 'side', 'life', 'most', 'rarely', 'encounter', 'movie', 'more', 'recommend', 'most', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'tired', 'Hollywood', 'endless', 'succession', 'sequels', 'remakes', 'TV', 'adaptations', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse']",Dirty Pretty Things
