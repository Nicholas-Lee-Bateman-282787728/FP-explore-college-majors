1646720,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00CERJIVY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","It's not surprising that the contemplative ""Errors of the Human Body"" has received a decidedly mixed reaction. I suspect it might be a film whose fervent supporters will proclaim it an instant masterpiece. Conversely, though, detractors might be willing to dismiss it entirely. A quintessential art house mood piece, Eron Sheean's medical puzzler will no doubt suffer from its own advertising and marketing. If you're expecting a ""tense medical thriller"" as the description promises, you might be a little perplexed. This is not an action based project, but one steeped in melancholy and regret. It creates and sustains an atmosphere that becomes increasingly unsettling. And for me, it worked. At about 3 1/2 stars, I'm going to round up to acknowledge the ambition behind the ideas presented. I've seen a number of these enigmatic and challenging movies recently from ""Upstream Color"" to ""Antiviral,"" but I connected more fully with this one. It's not lighthearted, to be sure, but I liked the movie's quietness and descent into despair.Michael Eklund plays a Canadian geneticist who has come to Germany to conduct experimental (and possibly ground-breaking) research. Reeling from a tragic illness that claimed his son's life, his work has been dedicated to the boy's memory. Reuniting with a former assistant (Karoline Herfurth), employed by a single-minded new boss (Rik Miyall), and meeting a creepy new scientific rival (Tomas Lemarquis), this institute poses a whole new set of challenges. In essence, they have used his grief for their own scientific gain. But that is just the beginning of the moral and ethical conundrums that face those who would ""play God."" Not to reveal too much, let's just say that a regenerative breakthrough is in the offing and it means something different to all the principle characters. But at what cost? As Eklund becomes a part of the experiment, is it something that he can survive?Again, though, ""Errors of the Human Body"" is not so much about plot. In an exploration of genetic abnormalities, the corruption of the body, and the possibility of defying conventional biology, Sheean has proposed something that feels different and even a little scary. Eklund may not be the most expressive actor in the film's set-up, but that makes the transformation and volatility more impactful when it arrives. I ended up really liking him in this performance and Lemarquis was a fascinating contradiction to his initial repression. If you want a date night movie, this isn't it. If you want a pulse pounding thriller, this isn't it. While I don't think that ""Errors of the Human Body"" is wholly effective, I think it marks the introduction of a thoughtful filmmaker who actually has ideas. Sheean wrote the polarizing Apocalypse drama ""The Divide"" which also starred Eklund. Where that movie was over-the-top, this one is surprisingly restrained. In both cases, though, I appreciate someone who is actually trying to say something as opposed to cranking out another mindless formula flick.

Eklund the professor/researcher and father of the stricken newborn has an affair with one of his star students (Herfurth) who later requests him to help her in Germany on her research a few years after the affair. His failed marriage, death of their son and his failing research are the setup for this storyHer research is on extremity/organ/tissue regeneration and ? Eklund finds out that his star student isn't the only one working on her research. Eklund has concerns about the research by his former student (Herfurth) and a recent flame/colleague of hers and investigates. This is one of the major flaws in the story because we aren't given any hints as to why he is so suspicious about their research.The obvious choice of having the story play out in Germany and the odd character traits that are displayed by the former lover/colleague of his former student/lover help to add to the possibility of something more sinister may be at hand with the research.This is an overview on the story without giving to much away and omitting certain key elements for the same reason. The story is moody with dark undertones and is deliberately slow paced (some will not like the pacing). The twist at the end helps, but is not enough to raise the story above its shortcomingsFor me the delivery of the story is just off and really hurts this otherwise good movie a lot. The telling of this story is much like the deceiving box cover art that turns people away from watching this movie. The acting is very good and convincing from the key characters as is the direction with the exception of fusing this story into a smooth flowing and coherent (you get it, but the missteps hurt the flow and pacing) storyline. Between the directors missteps and the writing this movie looses some of its appeal. 2.7 starsRating 0 to 5 starsStory = 3 The story suffers from lack of flow and cohesiveness.Direction = 3 The director does a good job at getting good performances, but can't bring this story together effectively.Acting = 4 The cast do a great job telling this moody story.Mood = 4+ This movie oozes moodiness.Gore = 4  There is disturbing scenes with the deformed newborn that may be hard to watch.

Briggs,"[0, 1]","&#34;Haunted by a personal loss, a brilliant geneticist working on a top-secret project unwittingly unleashes a virus in this sci-fi thriller&#34; says the tag line.It seems from that sentence several reviewers were expecting a zombie movie, some were expecting a medical thriller others, well who knows.  But nothing in the tag line suggests zombie movie or medical thriller.  Some complained they didn't see an unleashed virus creating a global plague.  That's not what this film is about.  It's a pensive, moody, well acted, well written journey into regret.  And yes, if you paid attention you'd realize the virus was unleashed.  The fact that you don't see the outcome, in society as a whole, of that unleashing doesn't mean the infected mouse who scurries away is not the vector.  It is established earlier in the film that they are creating a virus that is blood born and carried by mosquitos, ticks and fleas.  Thus the mouse would infect the fleas that would obviously soon find him and they would in turn infect the human population.  The Easter gene, probably called that because of resurrection being associated with Easter, does not ultimately kill as our protagonist becomes painfully aware.  If you aren't paying attention the nuance of the film may escape you but for those who did pay attention that extra dimension is found there in the tears coming down Rebecca's face when she asks our protagonist, now a patient at the same research institute, why his son didn't recover.  The only answer can be, and one that informs the internal angst of regrets from the first scenes on is that our protagonist must have put his own child out of its suffering.  This film deserves 4 stars for not relying on clich&eacute;s, tricks and deus ex machina to tell the story.  It is nice and tightly written unlike other sci fi films by better known film makers.If you need clich&eacute;'s, tricks and special effects to enjoy a film, this isn't for you.  This actually engages several brain cells at the same time and makes them sit up and take notice.

If they deliver what they promise, fair enough. But when they fail to capture the product, whether intentionally or through ineptitude, there's bound to be disappointment. In the world of Amazon movie reviews, such bait tactics can be deadly. However, I will rise above what I believe happened here, because the movie does have merit.There is no virus released upon humanity. This film is neither a zombie event, nor does it depict a pandemic scenario. Does it have Sci-fi aspects? Okay, I'll give them that one, but only by the barest margin. Rather, the movie is more of a mediocre ""thriller"" mixed with the drama of human loss, wrapped around the dark side of genetic research. The cinematography and acting are decent. Michael Eklund aptly portrays a ""lost"" soul after suffering the death of his child (rare disease)and quid pro quo disintegration of his marriage. The first half paces nicely, with intrigue, character development, a taste of reawakened romance and plot thickening... in fact, I really enjoyed the nefarious lab researcher played by Tomas Lemarquis. His motives and take on corporate research/politics felt real without being over the top.After an hour-plus into the production, things begin to drag. But not awfully... they just didn't transport the viewer to the next level. It's as if the writers were torn on which direction to proceed. Even to the last fifteen minutes of the movie, they still could have gone full throttle zombie, or horror-fest epidemic, or octopus-like corporate corruption culture - but alas, none of the above. Instead, the film focuses upon Eklund's internal struggle/remorse and finishes abruptly with a wake-up scene that leaves the viewer asking ""what next?""
