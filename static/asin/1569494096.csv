So my mom checked out this video from the library, and that changed immediately. I could rattle off my multiplication tables as fast as everybody else after watching this only a few times. Amazing! That same year I got put in advanced math. Coincidence? I think not! All the songs were just so catchy. I loved it when I saw the NIKE commercial playing &quot;Three is the Magic Number&quot;, that's one of my favorites. Anyways, parents, this is a great buy for your kids and I doubt that you'll get tired of the tunes.",5,A Schoolhouse Rock Testimonial,1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,637,"['When', 'was', 'third', 'grade', 'never', 'could', 'get', 'times', 'tables', 'pat-', 'sevens', 'twelves', 'proved', 'especially', 'tricky', 'mom', 'checked', 'out', 'video', 'library', 'changed', 'immediately', 'could', 'rattle', 'off', 'multiplication', 'tables', 'as', 'fast', 'everybody', 'else', 'watching', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'Amazing', 'same', 'year', 'got', 'put', 'advanced', 'math', 'Coincidence', 'think', 'not', 'songs', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'catchy', 'loved', 'when', 'saw', 'NIKE', 'commercial', 'playing', 'quot', 'Three', 'Magic', 'Number', 'quot', 'one', 'favorites', 'Anyways', 'parents', 'great', 'buy', 'kids', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'get', 'tired', 'tunes']",N/A

It first came on in 1973 when I was in second grade-perfect timing! Fortunately, it wears well. My neices also learned multiplication and some American history from ths series, so like Sesame Street, it'll live on.

This is the best school movie I ever enjoyed incl. the soundtrack. I was 5 or 6 when I grew up w/ this and I liked it a lot. I mean a WHOLE lot.It teaches you the basic on how you can multiply, add, subtract or divide whenever you feel like counting or you can get in your head. Sometimes it easily to try w/o giving up. My mom and dad teach me better to stay in school and learn a good education.Probably to me I'm a fast learner and I count money real well too. I recommend this along w/ Money Rock to go with it.
