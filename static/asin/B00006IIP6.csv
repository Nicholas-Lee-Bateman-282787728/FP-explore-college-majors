You'd never see people smoking and drinking, with the guests half soused! In all, this is lots of laffs, most of which are still great today. All in all, the material is quite fun to watch.The producer of the disc has a clear-cut case of ""Because I can,"" that is, ""I can edit the program and add stuff to make it mine, so I did."" The opening was cut and clips of Carson entering the stage from different time periods were used. Ok. The most jarring thing is the psuedo-60s overlays with the guest's names after Carson announces them. What's the matter, can't we hear?Oh well. The material is as good as it can be for a video to film to DVD transfer. Get the disc for the laughs, not becuase there was good editing judgement used in putting it together. Maybe one day we'll get a bigger release of Carson's shows, with no stupid editors attached.",4,"A great time, but the DVD...",1107820800,"02 8, 2005",2005,925,"['great', 'DVD', 'wierd', 'look', 'how', 'different', 'television', 'was', '35', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'people', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'guests', 'half', 'soused', 'lots', 'laffs', 'most', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'today', 'material', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch.The', 'producer', 'disc', 'clear-cut', 'case', 'can', 'can', 'edit', 'program', 'add', 'stuff', 'make', 'so', 'did', 'opening', 'was', 'cut', 'clips', 'Carson', 'entering', 'stage', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'were', 'used', 'Ok', 'most', 'jarring', 'thing', 'psuedo-60s', 'overlays', 'guest', 'names', 'Carson', 'What', 'matter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Oh', 'well', 'material', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'video', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Get', 'disc', 'laughs', 'not', 'becuase', 'there', 'was', 'good', 'editing', 'judgement', 'used', 'putting', 'together', 'Maybe', 'one', 'day', ""'ll"", 'get', 'bigger', 'release', 'Carson', 'shows', 'stupid', 'editors', 'attached']",N/A

Not only is this the most complete Johnny Carson Tonight Show available to the public (hopefully that will change), but it really does leave today's talk shows in the dust.  They were there to entertain, not just plug their latest projects.  The legendary Bob Hope, Dean Martin, George Gobel segment is there in its entirety and is as funny as I had always heard it was.I highly recommend this DVD.  Keep an open mind and overlook its technical faults, and just sit back and enjoy what TV used to be.",5,It is what is...you won't be disappointed,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,1043,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'minor', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'production', 'pseudo-sixties', 'look', 'bad', 'sound', 'bad', 'editing', 'etc.', ""'m"", 'sure', 'producers', 'DVD', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'what', 'had.Sure', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'full', 'show', 'transferred', 'original', 'videotape', 'instead', 'film', 'due', 'network', 'geniuses', 'who', 'made', 'decisions', 'back', 'then', 'what', 'left', 'show.That', 'being', 'said', 'accept', 'fact', 'imperfect', 'version', 'classic', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'watching', 'Not', 'only', 'most', 'complete', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'available', 'public', 'hopefully', 'will', 'change', 'really', 'leave', 'today', 'talk', 'dust', 'were', 'there', 'entertain', 'not', 'just', 'plug', 'latest', 'projects', 'legendary', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'George', 'Gobel', 'segment', 'there', 'entirety', 'as', 'funny', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Keep', 'open', 'mind', 'overlook', 'technical', 'faults', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'what', 'TV', 'used', 'be']",N/A
716760,A42GFMF12V7XR,B00006IIP6,Paul J. Mular,"[12, 13]","In 1974 Johnny claimed this episode as his favorite show, the trouble was that the tapes of pre 1972 shows had been erased by NBC.  Because of that, this was never included in his anniversary specials.  Then a color kino-scope 16mm print was discovered at the Armed Forces Radio & Television Service archives.  This was great news!The AFTRS kept all of their shows on half hour reels, so this show would have been on three reels. The trouble here is that the middle reel is still missing. 20 some minutes in you go to a commercial break while talking to Judy Carne, and then come back to Bob Hope sitting next to Johnny.  Later Bob makes a quick reference to a ""comedy sketch"" which we never saw.  Hopefully someday the missing reel will be found.Another problem is the sound quality, it is so muffled at times that dialogue is hard to hear.  Audio Engineers should have been able to clear this up some.  I would suggest not listening to this from the small TV speakers.Otherwise this is a MUST HAVE for any Johnny Carson - Tonight Show fan!It IS the BEST show of the series, and it is even mentioned in the TV Guide Johnny Carson Tribute issue of 2/13/05.",4,Fun but short.

This was the classic 1969 show in which comedian George Gobel had the daunting task of following unannounced guests Bob Hope and Dean Martin. ""George not only followed them, he topped them,"" Carson recalled. The original 90-minute tape (now lost) was among the few ""Tonight Show"" broadcasts transferred to film in an edited version for the Armed Forces Network. The DVD runs 40 minutes, but it's a memorable document of vintage Carson. Hopefully, the Carson estate will release more programs from the 1960s and '70s - when late-night talk shows were spontaneous affairs rather than endless plug-fests.",4,When Carson Was King,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,711,"['Instead', 'packaged', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'highlights', 'finally', 'get', 'early', 'program', 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'vaults', 'was', 'classic', '1969', 'show', 'comedian', 'George', 'Gobel', 'had', 'daunting', 'task', 'following', 'unannounced', 'guests', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'George', 'not', 'only', 'followed', 'topped', 'Carson', 'recalled', 'original', '90-minute', 'tape', 'now', 'lost', 'was', 'few', 'Tonight', 'Show', 'broadcasts', 'transferred', 'film', 'edited', 'version', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'Network', 'DVD', '40', 'minutes', 'memorable', 'document', 'vintage', 'Carson', 'Hopefully', 'Carson', 'estate', 'will', 'release', 'more', 'programs', '1960s', ""'70s"", 'when', 'late-night', 'talk', 'shows', 'were', 'spontaneous', 'affairs', 'rather', 'endless', 'plug-fests']",N/A
