710944,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,B00006C7G9,A Customer,"[5, 5]","......Well, the men of Easy Company were regular Joes. Oh, there were a few that were more educated and afew with military training but basically they were young Americans asked to perform duties that ultimately sacrificed the entire company, one way or the other. Easy Company suffered 150% casualties. Let me repeat that:150%! Can you imagine that?Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have been forefront in the effort to keep our past alive through ""Schlinder's List,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". They are the executive producers of HBO's production of Stephen Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers"". I believe the cost of the production exceeded one hundred twenty million dollars but it was worth every dime... Folks, if you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you'll love this. I loved former movie but I believe this series is even better.The first episode dealt with the intense training that Easy Company went through in Georgia. They were pioneers in Airborne (Parachutists) warfare. Hanks and Spielbergdeliberately did not go after the big name Hollywood stars. The best known actor appears in the first episode as the hated Captain Herbert Sobel as portrayed by David Schwimmer from the ""Friends"" cast. Sobel was so mean that many of his trainees talked about killing him when they arrived in Europe. The training was not only physically exhausting but Sobel was a master of mind games. However, many years later, one of the veterans of the company saidthat it was his rigorous training that saved many lives in combat.The second episode concerned the D-Day jump of Easy Company behind Germany lines. The heroes of this episode were many but Lt. Richard Winters (later Major) begins to asserthimself as an amazing leader. As you probably know, almost all of the paratroopers did not land where they were supposed to due to intense anti-aircraft fire. One of the missions of Easy Company was to wipe out some massive German cannons (88's) which were creating havoc for the landing parties on Utah and Omaha Beaches. After gathering his forces together gradually, Winters led an assault on the cannons which is now textbook military strategy on such battles. The episode is called ""Day of Days"" and Winters thanks God for getting him through that incredible day.Easy Company was supposed to jump, accomplish their mission and go back to England. They did go back to England but not until they had fought its first big battle as an intactcompany in the French town of Carentan which was a valuable crossroads for both Allies and Germans. The third episode highlights the initial battle and the subsequent defensiveposition that the company went into after the battle to thwart massive German counterattacks. Each episode features different soldiers in their various roles. The individual acts of heroism are chronicled beautifully but nobody seems to thing much about it. They're doing their jobs and just trying to survive.The fourth episode highlights the move of Easy Company into Holland where it liberates a very grateful Eindhoven. There is really no battle and the people of the town are delirious to see the Americans after years of harsh treatment from the Germans. Although there is somefighting in this episode, it is probably the least violent episode to date. A false feeling that the war may be over by Christmas, 1944 starts to evolve. It wasn't to be, of course, but the lapse in fighting lulled the men into a false sense of security.The fifth episode has Easy Company traveling to Bastogne where the Germans are mounting a massive attack in a last ditch effort to stop the allies. Easy Company does not have enoughammunition, food nor the proper winter clothing but they do a miraculous job in holding off the Germans in attack after attack. This episode was directed by Hanks and reminded of the fierce battle scenes in ""Ryan"". Now Captain Winters is heavily featured in this episode in the battlefield as well as behind the lines where he has been promoted. He loves Easy Company and hates to sit behind a desk. There is a foreboding at the end of this episode that the nearfuture of the company is going to be trouble.Sure enough, Episode 6 concerns the now totally surrounded Easy Company's attempt to hold off German panzer attacks as well as far superior numbers. It is by far the bloodiestepisode as Easy gets [beat]. The episode features a young medic who is kept frantically busy due to the injuries and his lack of supplies. At the end of the episode, the casualties have mounted to a staggering degree but Easy Company still has fight left in it and are ready to move on into Germany....",5,THE BAND OF BROTHERS SHOULD MAKE

710948,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,B00006C7G9,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[6, 7]","I wasn't able to watch Band of Brothers when it aired on HBO in 2001, so I bought the late Stephen E. Ambrose's book of the same name.  It was the tie-in edition with the cover art taken from the miniseries promotional materials and a new foreword by the author describing the genesis of the miniseries and his praise for executive producers Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.  Ambrose stated that their personal interest and attention to detail were impressive, for they wanted to make sure they got everything right.I was finally able to borrow this 6-DVD set from a friend of mine who works on cruise ships, and I have found this to be not only a faithful adaptation of a very good non-fiction book about small unit warfare in the European Theater of Operations (...), but it's one of the most moving works made for television that I have ever watched.Band of Brothers follows the men and officers of Easy (E) Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from the unit's formation at Camp Toccoa, GA in 1942 to its deactivation in the summer of 1945.  During that time, Easy endured many challenges and hardships, including training under a first commanding officer who was a martinet (Capt. Herbert Sobel, played by David Schwimmer), a baptism of fire in a night drop on Normandy, participation in the failed Operation Market Garden, and the harrowing stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.In addition to Schwimmer, who makes you forget his more famous role as Ross in NBC's ""Friends"" as the tyrannical Capt. Sobel, the cast includes Damian Lewis as Maj. Richard Winters, Donnie Wahlberg as 2nd Lt. C. Carwood Lipton, and Colin Hanks (Tom's son) as 2nd Lt. Henry Jones....there are many, many more fine actors featured in the 10-hour running time of this marvelous miniseries.  The directors, which included Phil Alden Robinson and Tom Hanks, got outstanding performances from them all.The writing of each episode is also top-notch, capturing the spirit and the essential facts from Ambrose's book perfectly. Also worth mentioning are the amazing special effects and cinematography, and the late Michael Kamen (Die Hard) composed a hauntingly beautiful score that added emotional power to the stunning visuals of this monumental television miniseries.Disc 6 features a making-of featurette, a video diary from a cast member, and the documentary ""We Stand Alone Together.""I recommend Band of Brothers to anyone who wants to understand what the individual soldiers who fought in Europe during history's darkest period (...)",5,"TV at its best shows the ""brotherhood of war"" and its bonds",1082505600,"04 21, 2004",2004,2594,"['was', ""n't"", 'able', 'watch', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'when', 'aired', 'HBO', '2001', 'bought', 'late', 'Stephen', 'E.', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'tie-in', 'edition', 'cover', 'art', 'taken', 'miniseries', 'promotional', 'materials', 'new', 'foreword', 'author', 'describing', 'genesis', 'miniseries', 'praise', 'executive', 'producers', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Ambrose', 'stated', 'personal', 'interest', 'attention', 'detail', 'were', 'impressive', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'got', 'everything', 'right.I', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'borrow', '6-DVD', 'set', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'cruise', 'ships', 'have', 'found', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'very', 'good', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'small', 'unit', 'warfare', 'European', 'Theater', 'Operations', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'works', 'made', 'television', 'have', 'ever', 'watched.Band', 'Brothers', 'men', 'officers', 'Easy', 'E', 'Company', '2nd', 'Battalion', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'unit', 'formation', 'Camp', 'Toccoa', 'GA', '1942', 'deactivation', 'summer', '1945', 'time', 'Easy', 'endured', 'many', 'challenges', 'hardships', 'including', 'training', 'first', 'commanding', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'martinet', 'Capt', 'Herbert', 'Sobel', 'played', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'baptism', 'fire', 'night', 'drop', 'Normandy', 'participation', 'failed', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'harrowing', 'stand', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Bastogne', 'Battle', 'Bulge.In', 'addition', 'Schwimmer', 'who', 'forget', 'more', 'famous', 'role', 'Ross', 'NBC', 'Friends', 'tyrannical', 'Capt', 'Sobel', 'cast', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Maj.', 'Richard', 'Winters', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', '2nd', 'Lt.', 'C.', 'Carwood', 'Lipton', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Tom', 'son', '2nd', 'Lt.', 'Henry', 'Jones', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'fine', 'actors', 'featured', '10-hour', 'running', 'time', 'marvelous', 'miniseries', 'directors', 'included', 'Phil', 'Alden', 'Robinson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'got', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'all.The', 'writing', 'episode', 'also', 'top-notch', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'essential', 'facts', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'perfectly', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'late', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'Die', 'Hard', 'composed', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'score', 'added', 'emotional', 'power', 'stunning', 'visuals', 'monumental', 'television', 'miniseries.Disc', '6', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'video', 'diary', 'cast', 'member', 'documentary', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'Together', 'recommend', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'anyone', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'individual', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'Europe', 'history', 'darkest', 'period']",N/A

As a Veteran of Vietnam Era myself and fully understanding war is hell no matter what generation or where it takes place this presentation was stunning and worthy of repeat viewing on occasion as a reminder of the evil of man against mankind visits upon us historically again and again.  There's a part of this story telling that weaves a comraderie that soldiers share in such a way I've never observed outside the military and sticks with you the rest of your life.Bravo to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to tell a story that's as genuine today as it was then as there seemingly will always be Hitlers that hunger to control and reign Supreme at the expense of the weak. Amazing that you could gather young actors that weren't alive during that action and recreate a portrayal appearing so genuine. One of the best War Movie's that's becomes a book of historic story telling.

This production stands tall above most of the horrible pap you will see on TV.  Shows like this Deadwood, the Wire (seems to be a theme with HBO shows ;), new Battlestar, etc. make one pay attention- as if you are reading a good book.I can see now how the stories all are integrated together- one episode will introduce a theme, character, etc which may not show up to a few episodes down the road- keep your Eye on Lt Spears who makes a scary introduction but will Amaze in ""Breaking Point"" . Of course you get the visual and sound of the battle, which while amazing also shows the sheer carnage of modern warfare, you touch the people in Easy Company and they touch you. Almost all of this is passed on true stories told by the Men of Easy Comapny who were in the middle of all this madness.  Stand outs include the episodes ""Breaking Point""- a fine piece showing how to lead people and survive under extreme circumstances.  ""Day of Days""- the Jump into Normandy and the days that follow- you meet one of the amazing People of Easy who is also a great leader, Captain Winters. A quiet red haired Gentleman who guides his men and will be noticed throughout your viewing - keep your eyes on the interviews.  You also get overwhelming documentary that if it doesn't get you on an emotional level nothing will.

And the themes are not what one might expect: insubordination, lack of respect for command, incompetence,  cruelty, character weakness, the list goes on. Definitely not what one expects from a so called regular war film. But let's get back to that budget.

You will go away with a whole new understanding, respect and feelings of awe at what the men of WWII, and specifically, this group - the men of Easy Company - were able to accomplish, many times in situations that would cause the majority of us to be incapable of functioning.  Yet somehow, they managed to go on to save the world.  One of my wishes would be to meet the men this story is about and be able to thank them in person.  If you value our country's history at all, this movie will be one that you will cherish.You will get to ""know"" the characters and grow to feel as if you've known them for years.  You will go through their basic training, their first jump, the frustrations, the physical exhaustion, the hardships, and sense the brotherhood that you know is a life-long bond.  You'll be with them as they enter into war.  You'll experience the tension on the plane as they waited to jump into enemy territory on D-Day, and it will leave you glued to your tv.  You'll feel that stinging cold as they sit in wait at Bastogne, while being pummeled by the Germans.  Then at the end, you'll share that exhilaration of ""we made it"" with them.  By the ending credits, if you don't want to stand up and salute these men and run out and buy the biggest flag you can get, then it's time to re-evaluate your patriotism and sense of appreciation for our WWII vets.The acting is superb -- the different actors chosen for their roles were perfect.  I hadn't ever seen Damian Lewis in anything before this, and now he is one of my favorite actors.  He is phenomenal in the role of Dick Winters.  Ron Livingston was also great in his role, as well as all the other actors.  I was quite surprised at how well David Schwimmer was able to pull off the gruff attitude of Capt. Sobel.

I remember here in Russia some time ago the release of the series on video was streched for five weeks - every two episodes were coming out every Thursday. And I can't recall of some other film I was waiting more anxiously for. ""Band of Brothers"" graphically demonstrates what it means when a budget is spent wisely.There are no first-rate stars in the film (I think Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough are not considered as ones with all my respect) but acting impresses a lot. You have not a glimpse of a doubt all that's happening on screen is true. The story-line is very intense like it should be in a war film and at the same time very thoughtful. It's not just an action movie, it's a real drama based on real events. And it's amazing to watch the main characters during all ten episodes as they mature physically and mentally.The edition itself it brilliant, it contains a lot of useful information about the history of Easy company.

710980,A62G4QX6XQVLP,B00006C7G9,Anyechka,"[16, 16]","This is a miniseries of epic proportions, but even though it's 10 hours long, plus a bunch of bonus features, it's well worth every single second.  To many people today who weren't there, WWII seems like ancient history, and the veterans are elderly.  This miniseries goes a long way towards disspelling those preconceptions among those who might have them.  The action and the times are immediate, and we get to see these soldiers as they were then, as young vibrant young men.  The viewer goes through everything they do--basic training, preparations for D-Day, D-Day itself (the second episode really makes it vividly clear just why it was called ""Day of Days""), battles in France, Operation Market-Garden in Holland, how the men felt towards the replacements who came in after D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium and the long hard ordeal in the forest of Bastogne, battles in Germany, the ending of the war in Germany, the liberation of the Landsberg camp, the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in the beautiful Austrian mountains, and their very early return to civilian life during the immediate end of the war, while they were still stationed in Austria but not doing any more fighting.  BoB makes it so clear why this generation has been dubbed ""The Greatest Generation,"" why WWII was a morally justified war, and why we should all be very thankful that these men (and countless others like them) did this, sometimes even making the ultimate sacrifice, to free Europe and the world from tyranny.  It portrays war as it really is, and makes this experience so real.Each of the main discs has a field guide, which provides a glossary, an explanation of Army ranks, maps, a historical timeline, a summary of the episode, and profiles of the soldiers featured in each episode.  I was very pleased that the sections on the soldiers contained no spoilers, so that the viewer can find out for oneself what happens to each particular soldier in each episode as opposed to knowing ahead of time, for example, that one of them might be killed or injured during that episode.  The bonus material is also great.  There's a featurette on the making of BoB, a special message from Jeep, previews of each episode, a very powerful, moving, and poignant documentary based around interviews with the surviving veterans of Easy Company and historical footage, short video clips to give a general idea of each of the main soldiers, a written who's-who section on the soldiers, and a 12-part video diary from actor Ron Livingston, showing the real boot camp he and his co-stars went through in preparation for this miniseries.  You don't really find that kind of thing too much anymore, with actors literally throwing themselves into a role like that.  They went through ten days of boot camp and the exact type of military training the real-life soldiers did, complete with equipment and clothing from the 1940s, and also had to endure such things as sleeping in bombed-out buildings and re-enacted battle scenes.  This was a great strategy, and helped them immensely in being able to portray these soldiers so well, since they'd already been put in their mindset and gone through these experiences more or less for real.Since this miniseries is 10 hours long and the viewer goes through so many emotional ups and downs with these men, with such realistic recreations of battles and everything else they went through, one can almost feel as though one knows these men and that it's more than just a very long movie.  This is an incredibly epic and personal experience, and is so much more than just another WWII movie.  (Although, for obvious reasons, I wouldn't recommend watching it with young children, due to the graphic violence, graphic injuries, a brief sex scene near the beginning of the ninth episode, and a lot of off-color language.)  We see war through the eyes of those who lived it; it's not portrayed as some glorious adventure, nor is it potrayed as constant bombardment and suffering.  We see the ups and the downs of war, and fully come to see in the ninth episode why this war had to be fought.  I actually felt a bit sad after coming to the end of the bonus disc, after having invested so much time and emotion into the lives of these heroic men.  This is one of the most emotional and powerful movie experiences anyone could ever hope for, and one that should be revisited many times.",5,What an experience!,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,4399,"['miniseries', 'epic', 'proportions', 'even', '10', 'hours', 'long', 'bunch', 'bonus', 'features', 'well', 'worth', 'single', 'second', 'many', 'people', 'today', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'WWII', 'ancient', 'history', 'veterans', 'are', 'elderly', 'long', 'way', 'disspelling', 'preconceptions', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'action', 'times', 'are', 'immediate', 'get', 'see', 'soldiers', 'were', 'then', 'young', 'vibrant', 'young', 'men', 'viewer', 'everything', 'do', 'basic', 'training', 'preparations', 'D-Day', 'D-Day', 'second', 'episode', 'really', 'vividly', 'clear', 'just', 'why', 'was', 'called', 'Day', 'Days', 'France', 'Operation', 'Market-Garden', 'Holland', 'how', 'men', 'felt', 'replacements', 'who', 'came', 'D-Day', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Belgium', 'long', 'hard', 'ordeal', 'forest', 'Bastogne', 'Germany', 'ending', 'war', 'Germany', 'liberation', 'Landsberg', 'camp', 'capture', 'Hitler', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'beautiful', 'Austrian', 'mountains', 'very', 'early', 'return', 'civilian', 'life', 'immediate', 'end', 'war', 'were', 'still', 'stationed', 'Austria', 'not', 'doing', 'more', 'fighting', 'BoB', 'so', 'clear', 'why', 'generation', 'been', 'dubbed', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'why', 'WWII', 'was', 'morally', 'justified', 'war', 'why', 'should', 'all', 'be', 'very', 'thankful', 'men', 'countless', 'others', 'did', 'sometimes', 'even', 'making', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'free', 'Europe', 'world', 'tyranny', 'war', 'really', 'experience', 'so', 'real.Each', 'main', 'discs', 'field', 'guide', 'glossary', 'explanation', 'Army', 'ranks', 'maps', 'historical', 'timeline', 'summary', 'episode', 'profiles', 'soldiers', 'featured', 'episode', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'sections', 'soldiers', 'contained', 'spoilers', 'viewer', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'particular', 'soldier', 'episode', 'opposed', 'knowing', 'ahead', 'time', 'example', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'killed', 'injured', 'episode', 'bonus', 'material', 'also', 'great', 'featurette', 'making', 'BoB', 'special', 'message', 'Jeep', 'previews', 'episode', 'very', 'powerful', 'moving', 'poignant', 'documentary', 'based', 'interviews', 'surviving', 'veterans', 'Easy', 'Company', 'historical', 'footage', 'short', 'video', 'clips', 'give', 'general', 'idea', 'main', 'soldiers', 'written', ""who's-who"", 'section', 'soldiers', '12-part', 'video', 'diary', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'showing', 'real', 'boot', 'camp', 'co-stars', 'went', 'preparation', 'miniseries', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'kind', 'thing', 'too', 'much', 'anymore', 'actors', 'literally', 'throwing', 'role', 'went', 'ten', 'days', 'boot', 'camp', 'exact', 'type', 'military', 'training', 'real-life', 'soldiers', 'did', 'complete', 'equipment', 'clothing', '1940s', 'also', 'had', 'endure', 'such', 'things', 'sleeping', 'bombed-out', 'buildings', 're-enacted', 'battle', 'scenes', 'was', 'great', 'strategy', 'helped', 'immensely', 'being', 'able', 'portray', 'soldiers', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'already', 'been', 'put', 'mindset', 'gone', 'experiences', 'more', 'less', 'real.Since', 'miniseries', '10', 'hours', 'long', 'viewer', 'so', 'many', 'emotional', 'ups', 'downs', 'men', 'such', 'realistic', 'recreations', 'battles', 'everything', 'else', 'went', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'one', 'men', 'more', 'just', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'epic', 'personal', 'experience', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'WWII', 'movie', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watching', 'young', 'children', 'due', 'graphic', 'violence', 'graphic', 'injuries', 'brief', 'sex', 'scene', 'beginning', 'ninth', 'episode', 'lot', 'off-color', 'language', 'see', 'war', 'eyes', 'who', 'lived', 'not', 'portrayed', 'glorious', 'adventure', 'potrayed', 'constant', 'bombardment', 'suffering', 'see', 'ups', 'downs', 'war', 'fully', 'come', 'see', 'ninth', 'episode', 'why', 'war', 'had', 'be', 'fought', 'actually', 'felt', 'bit', 'sad', 'coming', 'end', 'bonus', 'disc', 'having', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'emotion', 'lives', 'heroic', 'men', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'movie', 'experiences', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'revisited', 'many', 'times']",N/A

One of the great benefits of this marvelous series was the closeup interviews of the real men portrayed, those wonderful old seamed faces, breaking at last with emotion as they recall their experiences and the love of their comrades and the pain of loss of other friends. It moves me greatly, and I'm glad the Extras in this set has an extended documentary re-tracing the time-frame of the film with these real veterans recalling the action we've seen re-created.Brought with loving care and fanatic attention to detail by producers Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks and their carefully chosen band of producers, directors and actors, this is an unsentimental, near-documentary telling of the story of Easy Co. from training to D-Day, Hedge Row fighting, Operation Market Garden, Bastogne, into Germany, liberation of Death Camps, and the capture of Berchesgarden & Hitler's Eagle's Nest.Throughout it all, the aim has been to tell it straight and get it right. They have done so in remarkable style.  The truth HAS enough drama, and the various episodes reveal it.  We get to know these men and care about them.  We marvel at their endurance and the way they go about getting the job done, professionally, and with matter-of-fact, everyday courage. It is a true tribute to the Citizen Soldiers who won the war.With 10 episodes and lots of extra goodies, presented within an exceptional package, there is just too much to review here.  Some memorable moments:  the harrowing jump into the explosive, tracer-lit night skies of Normandy; the assault on the 88's; Winter's killing the young German; the episode dedictated to the Medic; the monstrous artillery barrage on the men in the snowy forest of Bastogne; the shock of the farmer's wife on seeing the closeup hand-to-hand killing of the German by ""Bull""; and finally, the incredibly moving scenes of the liberation of the Concentration Camp, and the final days of Easy at the War's end.These last episodes are all the more powerful because we have followed Easy Co. and these men and  have seen the death so random and arbitrary around and among them that a slow emotional tension has been built that we now realize with the intensity of anger/pity/horror at the Camps and the bittersweet joy and subsequent farewell of VE day.I could cite great moments by each individual actor, and nicely played and effectively understated but powerfully emotional scenes but suffice it to say this is an ensemble piece with superb performances throughout. The quiet power of the different episodes underscores how wonderfully written the entire piece is, and with corresponding excellent direction and production values.A one-of-a-kind production, having the time to tell the tale with detail and care, and with all involved doing honor to the men who lived it.  And finally, there are those men, bringing it all back to the reality of real lives lived.

Nevertheless, this is an outstanding series of stories about WWII in Europe and the men that fought there.I was introduced to this series only about 6 months ago, but I have already watched this entire series through more than a few times.The storylines are engaing, the characters and acting are top-notch, and the staging, filming, and effects are excellent.The feelings of fighting men, their commitment to each other, their willngness to sacrifice for each other, and their unwillingness to let a comrade down come across in a crystal clear fashion.  It has been said that fighting men do not usually do what they do for home or country (though that's usually in the mix), but they do what they do in order to support their brothers in arms.  That impression and sentiment is made and strengthened throughout the entire series.This is a series worth watching over and over.  It repesents what is best about our country and those that put themselves in harm's way to defend it (and us).I'd like to express sincere thanks to the writers, producers, and actors, but most especially to those who fought and lived and those who fought and died.

I knew that it was highly acclaimed, but the reviews don't so it justice. If you want a glimpse into the real life stories of the men who freed the world and defeated a true evil, this is the best DVD around.Band of Brothers combines the realism of Saving Private Ryan while getting into far more detail. The rigorous training, the camaraderie that they felt, even their distancing themselves from new recruits to avoid getting attached to guys who they likely would see dead, all speak to the realism of this portrayal of WW II. Unlike any war prior, WW II was mainly a squad level war with a couple dozen soldiers on each side fighting it out rather than massive waves of men and Ambrose selected just the right size of outfit and the right people to profile.Perhaps just as telling is the lack of traditional heroes. The men who served in Easy Company were no angels or John Wayne types, just regular Joe's from all over America who heard the call and served their country. None of them wanted to be there but they had a job to do and in those days you just did what you had to do. The men of Easy Company went a step further and volunteered to jump out of airplanes for some reason. I had a history professor in college, a diminutive old man who looked like he wouldn't hurt a fly, who was a volunteer for the glider corps. He told us he did it to impress girls!What I found most poignant were the introductions by veterans and the stories of their lives after they returned from Europe. One veteran recounted that some young men he knew from his home town were rejected from service due to medical conditions, and were so distraught at not being able to serve that they committed suicide. It is hard in modern day America to imagine that anything could stir up our population with that sort of single-mindedness, given that we already are complaining about steps to combat terrorism as being too intrusive (like being in a collapsing building brought down by terrorists is preferential to having to wait in line to get to your gate at the airport). When the men returned home, they went back to living their lives grateful to be alive and back in America. It is a shame that the accomplishments of these heroes have only recently been given due respect with a memorial in D.C.",5,Realistic and memorable,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,2374,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'History', 'Channel', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunned', 'knew', 'was', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'reviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'justice', 'want', 'glimpse', 'real', 'life', 'stories', 'men', 'who', 'freed', 'world', 'defeated', 'true', 'evil', 'best', 'DVD', 'around.Band', 'Brothers', 'combines', 'realism', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'getting', 'far', 'more', 'detail', 'rigorous', 'training', 'camaraderie', 'felt', 'even', 'distancing', 'new', 'recruits', 'avoid', 'getting', 'attached', 'guys', 'who', 'likely', 'would', 'see', 'dead', 'speak', 'realism', 'portrayal', 'WW', 'II', 'war', 'prior', 'WW', 'II', 'was', 'mainly', 'squad', 'level', 'war', 'couple', 'dozen', 'soldiers', 'side', 'fighting', 'rather', 'massive', 'waves', 'men', 'Ambrose', 'selected', 'just', 'right', 'size', 'outfit', 'right', 'people', 'profile.Perhaps', 'just', 'telling', 'lack', 'traditional', 'heroes', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'Easy', 'Company', 'were', 'angels', 'John', 'Wayne', 'types', 'just', 'regular', 'Joe', 'America', 'who', 'heard', 'call', 'served', 'country', 'None', 'wanted', 'be', 'there', 'had', 'job', 'do', 'days', 'just', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'went', 'step', 'further', 'volunteered', 'jump', 'airplanes', 'reason', 'had', 'history', 'professor', 'college', 'diminutive', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'fly', 'who', 'was', 'volunteer', 'glider', 'corps', 'told', 'did', 'impress', 'girls', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'poignant', 'were', 'introductions', 'veterans', 'stories', 'lives', 'returned', 'Europe', 'One', 'veteran', 'recounted', 'young', 'men', 'knew', 'home', 'town', 'were', 'rejected', 'service', 'due', 'medical', 'conditions', 'were', 'so', 'distraught', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'serve', 'committed', 'suicide', 'hard', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'imagine', 'anything', 'could', 'stir', 'up', 'population', 'sort', 'single-mindedness', 'given', 'already', 'are', 'complaining', 'steps', 'combat', 'terrorism', 'being', 'too', 'intrusive', 'being', 'collapsing', 'building', 'brought', 'down', 'terrorists', 'preferential', 'having', 'wait', 'line', 'get', 'gate', 'airport', 'When', 'men', 'returned', 'home', 'went', 'back', 'living', 'lives', 'grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'back', 'America', 'shame', 'accomplishments', 'heroes', 'have', 'only', 'recently', 'been', 'given', 'due', 'respect', 'memorial', 'D.C']",N/A

710987,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B00006C7G9,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","Filmed in 2000 and transmitted in 2001, Band of Brothers is a 10-part mini-series which remains the most expensive TV series ever made (at least until the budget for its new companion series, The Pacific, is revealed). The series was developed by Steven Spielberg as a continuation of the themes and ideas he explored in his hit 1998 movie, Saving Private Ryan. Whilst the film's running time meant that only a small portion of the Second World War could be depicted, the greater scope and length afforded to a series meant that more of the conflict could be shown and the characters' story arcs would be more satisfying. Also, it was decided that, unlike the purely fictitious Saving Private Ryan, the TV companion piece would be based on true events and real soldiers. The rights to the book Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose were purchased and Ambrose and the surviving soldiers portrayed in the book were brought in to consult on the project.Band of Brothers opens in 1942, shortly after the formation of the 101st Airborne Division by the US Army. The first episode follows the training of Easy Company at Toccoa, Georgia, over the course of a year. They are placed in the care of Captain Herbert Sobel (Friends' David Schwimmer) who trains them far harder than the other men of the 101st, with the result that soon the company has a reputation as the best company in the division. However, Sobel's methods make him highly unpopular with the men, especially when it is revealed that his nerves fail him in field exercises. The unit is shipped to England to train and prepare for D-Day, but Sobel's limitations are eventually recognised and he is relieved of command. The second episode has the 101st parachute into Normandy just ahead of the beach landings. When Easy Company's commanding officer is killed during the drop, it falls to Lt. Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) to assume command and lead a daring attack on a German artillery position targeting the beaches. Winters becomes the closest thing to a central character and is one of only a few characters to appear in every episode.What initially impresses about Band of Brothers is its authenticity. Its production values would be impressive for a movie, but for a TV series they are stunning. But where the series really works is its focus on the characters. Whilst some events are dramatised or compressed for timing reasons, pretty much everything that happens in the series is based on a true event and every one of the main characters is based on a real person. This makes the series unpredictable and strongly emotionally resonant: if a character is wounded or killed without warning, it is because his real-life counterpart was wounded or killed at that point of the war. This is also why every single actor brings his A-game to his role: when the person you are playing is actually going to be watching your performance, or if he has passed away and his friends are, then you definitely need to be on top form.The producers seemed to realise early on that simply having ten episodes of non-stop carnage would get boring pretty quickly, so each episode is built around different characters and premises, and the individual episode directors are allowed to indulge their own artistic styles somewhat more than is normal on a television drama. A particular stand-out is the sixth episode, which focuses on Easy Company's medic during the Battle of the Bulge and follows him from unit to unit, seeing his friends get wounded and having to patch them up, or having to watch them die. It is an incredible piece of television drama. As is traditional with HBO, they don't make things too easy for the viewer. Easy Company is made up of several platoons, with some episodes focusing entirely on one group and others on all of them, meaning that characters appear, disappear and reappear from episode to episode. Characters are also promoted, demoted, wounded or killed off and the viewer is expected to work out who is who and what they are doing sometimes very quickly. This lack of spoon-feeding is as refreshing here as it is on other HBO productions such as The Wire, but casual viewers may find themselves swamped on first viewing.The series employs an interestingly desaturised colour tone, which puts its feel somewhere between full colour and black and white. Whilst this adds immensely to atmosphere, it does make telling some of the characters apart difficult, again on first viewing, especially as most of the time they are wearing full combat gear and helmets. For these reasons the series rewards careful re-watching and is also better suited to the DVD format, with the viewer able to watch several episodes in a row and work out who is who and what their roles within the company are.The series' action sequences rival some of the strongest war movies in their intensity and vividness, but it's in the quiet moments that it excels. The banter between the men is authentic and the importance of the bonds that form between soldiers in combat with regards to keeping them sane is strongly emphasised (more cliched, ""I love you, Sarge!"" moments are firmly absent, thankfully). In fact, one of the strongest moments in the series comes when one of the company's toughest, most effective lieutenants suddenly breaks down after seeing two of his men get their legs blown off in front of him. The mental pressures of the war are portrayed as being as dangerous and difficult to deal with as enemy action. Questions of morality in warfare are also intelligently raised: one soldier is rumoured as having brutally gunned down more than a dozen unarmed German PoWs on D-Day but later proves himself to be the bravest and most efficient officer in the unit whose actions repeatedly save the lives of his men.Band of Brothers (*****) is a staggeringly impressive piece of work, not just for its incredible budget and impressive special effects, but for its intelligent and often powerful writing, phenomenal acting and the resonance provided by knowing that pretty much everything that happened in the series is based on a real event. It is available on DVD in the UK and USA, and also now on Blu-Ray in the UK and USA.",5,Spectacular,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,6186,"['Filmed', '2000', 'transmitted', '2001', 'Band', 'Brothers',

Anyone not moved by Winter's letter has no heart nor understands how war bonds men.I knew a man who was a paratrooper, not in Easy Company, who was twenty-five years older than me and we spent hours talking about his experiences after D-Day and the march into Germany. He was another silent hero and told me that he had never talked to anyone about his experiences in World War II until he crossed my path.His name was Dick Morgan and we met in Savannah, Ga. in the early 1970s. At that time, he was selling office products and I was one of his customers. He tolerated fifteen years of my pulling information out of him. He died in 1988 and since I began teaching school in 1991, I have made a point of every class knowing who Dick Morgan was and what he did during World War II.He earned that just as all of the veterans of World War II did with their service to our country. Anyone reading this review will have to excuse my addition of Dick to it but he is someone that all Americans owe a huge debt and someone I will never forget.",5,BEST MOVIE ABOUT WORLD WAR II,1215475200,"07 8, 2008",2008,1618,"['teach', 'American', 'History', 'high', 'school', 'DVD', 'point', 'students', 'way', 'documentary', 'standard', 'two-hour', 'movie.The', 'strongest', 'points', 'movie', 'completely', 'true', 'story-lines', 'not', 'inserted', 'make', 'appealing', 'public', 'not', 'create', 'super', 'hero', 'types', 'Major', 'Winters', 'Mathew', 'Settle', 'character', 'showed', 'true', 'spirit', 'toughness', 'American', 'GI.I', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'single', 'out', 'two', 'more', 'heroic', 'Richard', 'Winters', 'sums', 'up', 'role', 'man', 'Easy', 'company', 'parting', 'letter', 'grandchild', 'Anyone', 'not', 'moved', 'Winter', 'letter', 'heart', 'understands', 'how', 'war', 'bonds', 'men.I', 'knew', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'paratrooper', 'not', 'Easy', 'Company', 'who', 'was', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'older', 'spent', 'hours', 'talking', 'experiences', 'D-Day', 'march', 'Germany', 'was', 'silent', 'hero', 'told', 'had', 'never', 'talked', 'anyone', 'experiences', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'crossed', 'path.His', 'name', 'was', 'Dick', 'Morgan', 'met', 'Savannah', 'Ga.', 'early', '1970s', 'time', 'was', 'selling', 'office', 'products', 'was', 'one', 'customers', 'tolerated', 'fifteen', 'years', 'pulling', 'information', 'died', '1988', 'began', 'teaching', 'school', '1991', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'class', 'knowing', 'who', 'Dick', 'Morgan', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'World', 'War', 'II.He', 'earned', 'just', 'veterans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'did', 'service', 'country', 'Anyone', 'reading', 'review', 'will', 'have', 'excuse', 'addition', 'Dick', 'someone', 'Americans', 'owe', 'huge', 'debt', 'someone', 'will', 'never', 'forget']",N/A
710994,A16NK4WD84MNK8,B00006C7G9,Barry Robinson,"[13, 15]","What do you get when Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks (director and star of Saving Private Ryan) team up with HBO? An amazing movie I could exceed the limits of this review talking about. Now right away some people might be thinking ""HBO, so this is a TV production."" Yes, it did originally debut on HBO but this is without a doubt cinema quality and has been released in selected theaters. Trust me and all the other excellent reviews that this movie not only delievers the best in action and story telling but also the true tale of the men of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne. Production values are extremely high. After the third episode the production team used more pyro technics than Saving Private Ryan and thats a lot. Throughout, the movie stays true to Ambrose's book and features top notch acting. Details, details. The story is so incredibley detailed that you'll need to watch the entire series several times before you catch every bit of excellence. This is truely film making at it's best as only Steven Speilberg can deliever. Now, I bet you want to know what each episode is about...Currahee - This is a great episode that introduces most of the main cast through training camp. The training is tough but no where near as tough as the upcoming D-Day invasion they set out on in the very end (which is very dynamic). 10/10Day of Days - This is a lot of action which to some will make up for the first's lack of. However, there is more to be had than just action. Winters (the main character) must deal with the death of one of his men. This is a moving episode that, unlike it's predecessor, ends with a sorrowful feeling. 10/10Carentan - This is a powerful episode that boasts a lot of action. For the first time, viewers take a look at the brutality of war and the affect it has on Private Blythe. This is not the best in the series but is excellent non the less. 10/10Replacments - This episode makes viewers really feel for the replacments who aren't excepted by the older guys. This episode, like Carentan, shows the brutality of war, but on a whole new level. This is a great episode that ends on a low note with Easy Company forced to retreat after heavy casualties. 10/10Crossroads - This is an excellent episode showing how the newly promoted Winters deals with his new job behind a desk, writing reports and the like. He wishes he were back on the battle fields with the men he has grown so close to. Never freight action fans becuase the title Crossroads actually refers to Winter's last battle before promotion. This episode is really good. 10/10Bastogne - This episode shows that sometimes the enemy wasn't the only thing life threatening. In the bitter cold forests of Belgium, Easy Company holds the main line of resistance in preparation for The Battle of the Bulge. This episode focuses on Doc. Roe, one of Easy's few medics. This episode knocks a few main characters out of the series, some only temporarily, but manages to end with a laugh. 10/10The Breaking Point - This is a spectacular episode that deals with the internal war many soldiers fight to keep themselves from going mad. Not only this, the final battle for Foy is amazing espeicially when Speirs single handedly charges the remaining German infantry. This episode knocks off a good portion of the main cast, this is very sad. 10/10The Last Patrol - This episode focuses on war as meirley a game that some of the men have grown to laugh at. Webster returns to the company after four months at the aid station. This not only shows how the bonds have strengthend between the men in Bastonge but how they are almost unwilling to except him back. Even after this and several more casualties this episode manages to end with a sence of hope that many of the soldiers will make it out alive.Why We Fight - This episode will probally be the one least rewatched not because its bad, simply becasue of how good it is. This episode shows a side of the war many don't like to confront. Easy encounters a Jewish prison camp and if you've seen Schindler's List, times that by two and add color. This episode is the only one that made me actually cry, although The Breaking Point came close. Watch it for what it is not necessarely for entertainment. 10/10Points - simple in name but deep in plot. For the main portion of this episode the war is over. Easy has captured Hitler's Eagle's Nest and is now waiting around for either redeployment or a perminent trip home. With nothing to do, trouble brews and although the war is over, violence is still present. This episode has it's sad points but ultimatley ends on a high note where viewers finally learn what became of the men who survived. The ending interviews are also very good. This is a perfect conclusion to a more than perfect (if that makes any sence) movie.Anyone with a pulse should be moved by this movie and I highly recommend you buy it, assuming you can handle the graphic violence and heavy language.Thanks for reading.",5,An acheivment that will forever live in our hearts!,1102636800,"12 10, 2004",2004,4970,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'Steven', 'Spielberg',

I had seen it so many times that I just had to get it on blue ray, a one day sale that had it bundled with the first episode of pacific for $37(I won't buy the pacific till its dirt cheap cause of the one sided blame america theme, and not on my must have list), so I bought band of brothers blue ray immediately, and point being is I watch my emails regularly for amazon's one day sales, or super sales, I mean, I've gotten in on so many 60% off sales, case in point again last year I got in on the complete ""Combat"" with Vic Morrow from the sixties on dvd for just a $130, a wonderful show that I won't ever need in blue ray.  I don't want to get every last movie and show on blue ray, and I won't, just a select few.The transfers to blue ray are nice and clear, there is some intentional grany shots, or shots and scenes that couldn't be made crystal clear in low light back then, that is to be expected.  The sound really is alot better than dvd seemingly, kind of made me jump many times.  The extras are something I haven't explored as of yet, I'm a blue ray newbie anyway.Mainly though, if you think you've really seen it too many times already, then you are like me and have, just see it again in blue ray if you can afford it or don't have to spend too much.

Gosh, there is hardly one thing I don't love about this DVD series.Now, if you're thinking of buying it:  DO SO!!!  It's money well spent.  This DVD series is far better than Saving Private Ryan and that is not a bad DVD either.I've been putting together models of German Armor for years.  On the set of ""Brothers"" they have reproductions of Tigers, Stug IIIs, Marders, and Jadpanthers.  The Stug was done so good it fooled me and only a DVD frame-by-frame analysis showed that it was a substitute, made of a former British personnel carrier.  But, what a wonderful substitute.  It is the attention to detail that makes you feel that the producers really went the extra mile in making this series.I'll give you another example of attention to detail.  In 1942 American aircraft had a star with a red circle inside as the national insignia.  That marking was only vaild for 1942 and earler.  In 1944 the invasion markings on the transports were obviously hand panted.  That is also correct for the period.  The producers went the extra mile just to research aircraft markings.  Yes, people like me pay attention and this will add to your enjoyment of the DVD.  Tom Hanks & crew got it right.Then there are the actors.  D. Williams plays LT/CPT/Major Winters.  What a fantastic job!  Darn, I wish my officers in the real military were half as good as Winters.  You never get over the impression that CPT Winters is a perfect American officer.  He's cool under fire, makes good decisions, and leads by example for his men.  Lt. Winter's mild words to an enlisted man, PVT Blythe, restores the man's courage and makes him an effective combat soldier.  What a leader!  Did D. Williams get an Emmy award for this performance?  He deserved it!!!Words excape my frail ability to write about Band of Brothers.  Now, if you read the book ""Band of Brothers"" by Stephen Ambrose it does give you some important background information.The reason why Winters does not drink (they make a big deal about this in the series) is he used to be a nationally rated wrestler in college.  So, Winters merely kept himself in athletic training mode while in the Army.  True athletes in training do not drink, it's empty calories.I really enjoyed the action between CPT Williams and CPT Nixon, the 506th S-2 (intelligence).  The book does a fantastic job of showing Nixon as two things:  1.  he was a wonderful planner and researcher for the Army (a positive effect of Yale) and 2.  he drank too much (a negative effect of fraternity life at Yale).Nixon loses the 506th Brigade job and the series makes a big deal about it.  This is a little different than the book because the war was winding down, another officer did want the job, and Nixon's drinking plus personal problems just gave an excuse to transfer Captain Nixon to Major William's command.  Remember, the European war was ending and the career soldiers were getting the plum assignments.I think the best part of the post fighting series is when Major Williams gives Captain Nixon the first pick of Nazi wine stash in Bavaria, Germany.  That was priceless.  Also, it follows the book nearly 100%.Fellow Amazon.comers, you will enjoy this DVD.  The Airborne comes off as super tough volunteers.  The series shows good officers - like Williams and Lt. Spears (who is rumored to be a cold blooded murderer) - bad officers, and officers with problems, such as the ever drinking Captain Nixon.This video is worth the money.",5,"It deserves 6 stars.

Everything's been made to almost perfection. The images are crisp, the colour tone is perfect, the sound is good. But then again, you would expect that wouldn't you? Considering the people involved in the making.The series is very well cast and I can honestly say that I don't think there's even one case of bad acting in the entire ten episodes, which is actually quite rare. If I should say something, it would be that the casting of David Schwimmer is a bit off. He acts very well, but because of his ""Friends"" fame, I think one tends to associate him with his ""Friends"" persona. It's a minor thing, and as said, he acts very well.I've heard people say that they feel that they don't get to know any the characters and thus don't care what happens to them. I genuinely find that very hard to believe. Even with all the good things I've said about the production qualities of the series above, by far the best thing about ""Band of Brothers"" is that it truly is about brotherhood. You DO get to know the characters and you DO care about them, so much in fact that you sit there wishing you were there with them! Not because of the war, no, but because of these people and their friendship, their bond, their brotherhood. It is something that people who have never been to war can't fully appreciate I reckon, and we never will be able to. But ""Band of Brothers"" brings us one step closer to understanding it.

The acting is wonderfully understated.  No superstars taking over the show here.  Dialogue and sequencing are authentic.  Fans of ""Saving Private Ryan"" will immediately appreciate ""Band of Brothers"" for its uncompromising look into the very darkest heart of the war.  But ""Band of Brothers"" seems even better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" if only because, this time, the script is based on reality.  The men who live and die on screen, really did live and die, as shown, and the gripping nature of this film is a testament to the real and brave heroics of those who stood against one of the greatest political and military menaces of the modern age.  Those who carp or complain about the film ""glorifying"" warfare simply miss the point.  This is not a typical hollywood blockbuster.  This is not ""Top Gun"".  This is the real war as seen through the eyes of the real soldiers who fought it, and I found it awesomely moving since we see first-hand how tough the average American 'mongrel' trooper really is: the hell he went through protecting the freedoms we Americans now enjoy, the turmoil the war brought to his personal and professional life, and the ultimate sacrifice he often made for his nation, his unit, and his buddies in the trenches.  This film is not a love letter to war itself.  It is a love letter to the valor and strength of the common free man.  Though certainly not child's fair, I would recommend this film to any parent who has a child that loves ""Lord Of The Rings.""  Show your son or daughter the REAL heroes and epic warfare that rescued our world from a REAL army of darkness.On a personal note, I found the bonus ""behind the scenes"" DVD to be a real winner.  Some bonus CD's are crud, but this one is a must see, not only for the in-depth interviews with the real-life guys upon whom this series is based, but also for actor Ron Livingston's home movie of the ""boot camp"" the actors were put through prior to filming.  As an Army Reservist I found myself laughing to the point of tears at some of the stuff Ron and the other guys went through, and I also found myself shaking my head that these guys found their ten-day mini-Basic to be so ""tough.""  Hey guys, try the real thing--9 weeks plus however many extra weeks you do in your Advanced school!  Ouch!  Anyway, even my Army training experience pails next to what the original Airborne troops had to go through.  My hat is off to the men of Easy Company, who paved the way for those of us in later generations, and who stand as shining examples to us all of what real heroes are made of.",5,Perhaps the best WW2 film ever?,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,2719,"['short', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'huge', 'film', 'following', 'true-life', 'epic', 'story', 'men', '101st', 'Airborne', 'who', 'fought', 'Europe', 'World', 'War', '2', 'acting', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'superstars', 'taking', 'show', 'here', 'Dialogue', 'sequencing', 'are', 'authentic', 'Fans', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'will', 'immediately', 'appreciate', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'uncompromising', 'look', 'very', 'darkest', 'heart', 'war', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'even', 'better', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'only', 'time', 'script', 'based', 'reality', 'men', 'who', 'live', 'die', 'screen', 'really', 'did', 'live', 'die', 'shown', 'gripping', 'nature', 'film', 'testament', 'real', 'brave', 'heroics', 'who', 'stood', 'one', 'greatest', 'political', 'military', 'menaces', 'modern', 'age', 'who', 'carp', 'complain', 'film', 'glorifying', 'warfare', 'simply', 'miss', 'point', 'not', 'typical', 'hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'not', 'Top', 'Gun', 'real', 'war', 'seen', 'eyes', 'real', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'found', 'awesomely', 'moving', 'see', 'first-hand', 'how', 'tough', 'average', 'American', ""'mongrel"", 'trooper', 'really', 'hell', 'went', 'protecting', 'freedoms', 'Americans', 'now', 'enjoy', 'turmoil', 'war', 'brought', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'often', 'made', 'nation', 'unit', 'buddies', 'trenches', 'film', 'not', 'love', 'letter', 'war', 'love', 'letter', 'valor', 'strength', 'common', 'free', 'man', 'certainly', 'not', 'child', 'fair', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'parent', 'who', 'child', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Show', 'son', 'daughter', 'REAL', 'heroes', 'epic', 'warfare', 'rescued', 'world', 'REAL', 'army', 'darkness.On', 'personal', 'note', 'found', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'be', 'real', 'winner', 'bonus', 'CD', 'are', 'crud', 'one', 'must', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'in-depth', 'interviews', 'real-life', 'guys', 'whom', 'series', 'based', 'also', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'home', 'movie', 'boot', 'camp', 'actors', 'were', 'put', 'prior', 'filming', 'Army', 'Reservist', 'found', 'laughing', 'point', 'tears', 'stuff', 'Ron', 'other', 'guys', 'went', 'also', 'found', 'shaking', 'head', 'guys', 'found', 'ten-day', 'mini-Basic', 'be', 'so', 'tough', 'Hey', 'guys', 'try', 'real', 'thing', '9', 'weeks', 'however', 'many', 'extra', 'weeks', 'do', 'Advanced', 'school', 'Ouch', 'Anyway', 'even', 'Army', 'training', 'experience', 'pails', 'what', 'original', 'Airborne', 'troops', 'had', 'go', 'hat', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'who', 'paved', 'way', 'later', 'generations', 'who', 'stand', 'shining', 'examples', 'what', 'real', 'heroes', 'are', 'made']",N/A

Well, if you're one of the few who haven't yet seen ""BoB,"" prepare for several scenes that are equally impressive in their intensity and realism.Nothing has made me appreciate the combat soldier like this miniseries.  Nothing has ever come close.  We can all wag our heads and say, ""War is hell,"" but the remarkable portrayal of these true stories, filmed by a production whose stated goal was to be as accurate as possible in every way, brings it home for me in a way that neither Hollywood, nor the press, nor the tales of returning veterans ever could.But it's not just those laudable results that make it happen.  It's the characterizations of such standout individuals as Winters, Garniere, Nixon, Compton, Toye, Spiers, etc., the real heroes (although they shun the word) who eagerly went forth to slay the Nazi dragon and got burned, to varying degrees, in the process.  I am grateful that we live in an age when such bravery is given its due, rather than that of 30 years ago when it drew suspicion.We live the war with these characters, from their soul-killing boot camp at the hands of possibly the worst company captain you could imagine (played brilliantly by David Schwimmer---yes, THAT David Schwimmer, clearly nobody's ""Friend"" here), to the nervous jump under fire over Normandy, to the firefights in the forests and fields of France and Holland, to Hitler's vaunted Eagle's Nest.  Our innocence and enthusiasm are shattered and rebuilt just like theirs, and our view of war, even of life itself, is forever altered in the process.  Thankfully for the viewer, we are not as deeply haunted as these fine men.Having watched the series a couple of times, the only nitpicks I have are that the primary military advisor on the series was a Vietnam vet who, I am told, wrongly approved two anachronisms:  The amount of foul language was much less among WWII veterans than presented here, and the extensive hand signals were not in use by the paratroopers whose story this is.  Both would be very familiar to him from 'Nam, a generation later, but don't belong in this WWII arena.Other than that, I have only praise and heartfelt thanks for this terrific 11-hour panorama of man's inhumanity to man and man's mechanisms for coping with same.

At times it has an almost documentary feel to it and I think that helped the series a lot.  The uniforms, weapons and gear are all pretty accurate.  There were a few things pictured in the movie that simply never happened or never would have happened (i.e. all of the guys huddled around the jeep singing songs after they take the town of of Foy - - I read an interview with Carwood Lipton (the Donnie Walberg character - - sadly he passed away shortly after the series was released) and he said it was the most glaringly inaccurate scene in the series), but the serious on the whole &quot;gets it right&quot; far more often that not. Even the casting was well done - - the actors all resemble the actual guys they portray circa 1943-45.  The history here is the real drama -- there's no need for phono BS Hollywood add-ons . . . the story of these men and what they did is incredible enough.Stephen Ambrose borrowed heavily from some earlier works that detailed this unit's history and it's combat record in the war when he wrote the book and the surviving members of Easy Company held him to a pretty high standard as far as getting the story right so the history is all there.  The series is a pretty good condensation of the book as well - - probably about as good a job as anybody could have done in turning a book into a mini-series.There were lots of combat units that endured the same sorts of hardships and made the same sacrafices as these men, but the story of the 101st Airborne, 506th PIR, 2d Battallion, Easy Company is a great microcosm of the whole story of the war on the Western front in Europe.Truly a great series worthy of all the acclaim in received.",5,Great Series - Good History,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,2032,"['want', 'whole', 'story', 'Easy', 'Company', 'read', 'official', 'unit', 'histories', 'want', 'emotional', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'telling', 'unit', 'experience', 'training', '1943', 'last', 'action', 'end', 'war', 'great', 'storytelling.It', 'look', 'feel', 'quot', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'quot', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'i.e', 'Hanks/Speilberg', 'times', 'almost', 'documentary', 'feel', 'think', 'helped', 'series', 'lot', 'uniforms', 'weapons', 'gear', 'are', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'pictured', 'movie', 'simply', 'never', 'happened', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'i.e', 'guys', 'huddled', 'jeep', 'singing', 'songs', 'take', 'town', 'Foy', 'read', 'interview', 'Carwood', 'Lipton', 'Donnie', 'Walberg', 'character', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'shortly', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'said', 'was', 'most', 'glaringly', 'inaccurate', 'scene', 'series', 'serious', 'whole', 'quot', 'right', 'quot', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Even', 'casting', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'actors', 'resemble', 'actual', 'guys', 'portray', 'circa', '1943-45', 'history', 'here', 'real', 'drama', 'need', 'phono', 'BS', 'Hollywood', 'add-ons', 'story', 'men', 'what', 'did', 'incredible', 'enough.Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'earlier', 'works', 'detailed', 'unit', 'history', 'combat', 'record', 'war', 'when', 'wrote', 'book', 'surviving', 'members', 'Easy', 'Company', 'held', 'pretty', 'high', 'standard', 'as', 'far', 'getting', 'story', 'right', 'so', 'history', 'there', 'series', 'pretty', 'good', 'condensation', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'anybody', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'turning', 'book', 'mini-series.There', 'were', 'lots', 'combat', 'units', 'endured', 'same', 'sorts', 'hardships', 'made', 'same', 'sacrafices', 'men', 'story', '101st', 'Airborne', '506th', 'PIR', '2d', 'Battallion', 'Easy', 'Company', 'great', 'microcosm', 'whole', 'story', 'war', 'Western', 'front', 'Europe.Truly', 'great', 'series', 'worthy', 'acclaim', 'received']",N/A

He was 92.A very private and modest man, he died last week but requested that the news be withheld until after the funeral, a family friend told the Associated Press.After enlisting in the Army on Aug. 25, 1941, the Pennsylvania native enrolled in Officer Candidate School, eventually being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in 1942. He was assigned to the 506th regiment of the 101st Airborne Division -- known as Easy Company -- and was deployed with his regiment to land by parachute in France on D-Day, June 6, 1944.By leading the takeover of a German artillery bunker on Utah Beach, Winters and his company saved countless lives from relentless cannon fire -- an action that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, the second-highest honor an American soldier can receive. Winters and Easy Company later fought near the Belgian town of Foy during the Battle of the Bulge, liberated the German concentration camp at Dachau, and occupied Hitler's mountainside retreat, Eagle's Nest.In 1945, one of Winters' soldiers, Floyd Talbert, wrote a letter to Winters from his hospital bed to express appreciation for his leadership in battle.""You are loved and will never be forgotten by any soldier that ever served under you,"" Talbert wrote. ""I would follow you into hell.""Shaken by what he experienced in war, Winters reportedly vowed to live a simple life if he managed to survive, and that's just what he did. After returning home, he married his then-girlfriend, Ethel, bought a farm in Pennsylvania and raised a family. He reportedly never talked about his war experiences until Ambrose came calling in the hopes of documenting Easy Company's role in winning the war. Winters said he honored Ambrose's request because he felt it important for future generations to learn about the war, its consequences and the sacrifices made by soldiers. He later wrote his own memoir, ""Beyond Band of Brothers.""Winters was leading a quiet life of farm retirement in Hershey, Pa., when ""Band of Brothers"" turned him into a minor celebrity. People who knew him say that he never really became comfortable with life in the spotlight. He had fielded countless requests for interviews and personal appearances over the past decade or so, most of which he turned down.Winters was, by all accounts, exceedingly modest. When someone would ask him whether he considered himself a hero, he would usually respond by saying, ""No. But I served in a company of heroes."" Chroniclers of the World War II era, however, such as legendary NBC newsman Tom Brokaw -- who detailed the lives of Winters and others like him in his ""Greatest Generation"" series of books -- beg to differ.""Dick Winters was the quintessential American infantry officer -- brave, canny and modest,"" Brokaw told The Lookout. ""His heroic leadership of the Band of Brothers is a one-man course on how to become a warrior without losing your humanity.""****************************************************************Oldest living member of 'Band of Brothers' diesBy Timberly Ross  Associated Press - Sat Jan 22, 5:52 pm ETOMAHA, Neb. - A member of the ""Band of Brothers"" who fought in some of World War II's fiercest European battles, Ed Mauser shunned the limelight and kept his service with the Army unit a secret, even from some of his family.His role came to light only after his brother-in-law got him a copy of the HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers,"" said Terry Zahn, who met Mauser during a 2009 Honor Flight trip to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II memorial. Mauser, who died Friday, told his family that some of the things in the miniseries, like the locations of buildings, weren't quite what he remembered from being there in person.But before that, ""he never talked about it for years and years and years,"" said Zahn, president of the Midwest chapter of the 101st Airborne Division Association.Mauser, 94, was the oldest living member of Easy Company, which is often better known now as the ""Band of Brothers.""Born Dec. 18, 1916 in LaSalle, Ill., he was drafted in 1942 and volunteered for the 101st Airborne Division. He was assigned to Company E, 506th Regiment -- Easy Company -- which participated in the D-Day invasion of France and the follow-up Operation Market Garden. The 101st also helped defend Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.Historian Stephen Ambrose interviewed Easy Company leader Dick Winters for the 1992 book ""Band of Brothers,"" upon which the HBO miniseries that began airing in September 2001 was based. Winters, of Hershey, Pa., died earlier this month at age 92.The miniseries followed Easy Company from its training in Georgia to the war's end in 1945. Its producers included actor Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg.Mauser was not among the soldiers portrayed in the miniseries.Zahn said he kept his service a secret, even from his relatives. After it became known, he reunited with some of his Army buddies and made a few public appearances. He preferred to stay out of the limelight.""Don't call me a hero,"" Mauser told the Lincoln Journal Star in a 2009 interview. ""I was just one of the boys. I did what I was told, and let's leave it at that.""Mauser had been fighting pancreatic cancer, Zahn said. Heafey Heafey Hoffmann Dworak & Cutler funeral home in Omaha confirmed his death.Mauser was preceded in death by his wife, Irene. He is survived by a daughter, Laurie Fowler of Omaha. She did not immediately return a message left Saturday by The Associated Press.A funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday in Omaha. Mauser will be given a military burial at Calvary Cemetery.",5,Farewell Brother,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,5856,"['Mon', 'Jan', '10', '11:29', 'am', 'ETDick', 'Winters', 'WWII', 'hero', 'Band',

711036,A282A0P69UT137,B00006C7G9,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[10, 10]","""Band of Brothers"" is without a doubt one of the greatest and most monumental mini-series ever to be shown on television.  When you see most war movies, you see a film about one battle, or one campaign, and its only two or three hours long.  With this mini-series format, you see around 12 hours of film that spans a couple of years of war.  Thus, you get a great deal more depth and detail than you do from a standard war movie.The series is about one company of the 101rst Airborne Division during World War II, and follows that company of men from the time they are trained in the U.S., to their deployment to Britain, to the Normany Invasion, through the campaign to liberate France, during the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne, and through the invasion of Germany to the end of the war.  Many of the episodes focus on one person of the unit as a sort of primary character, as he interacts with the others.  But through it all, the viewer gets an inside, no bull look at war at its worst, and the complex relationships that develop between men who face it together.This mini-series was the brain child of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, but is based on the book by the same title and subject by Stephen Ambrose, one of our most gifted World War II popular historians.  Ambrose is able to bring the story of World War II to life from the soldiers' point of view, in this book, and others such as ""Citizen Soldiers"", through his extensive interviews with veterans.Hanks and Spielberg have faithfully taken that work, and they along with their cast and crew have produced a monument to the American soldier of World War II.  This mini-series is a must see for any history buff, historian, student, any American in general, and any human being interested in a moment in time when, as the tag line for the series says, ""ordinary men were asked to do extraordinary things.""",5,"""Ordinary men were asked to do extraoridinary things.""",1029110400,"08 12, 2002",2002,1870,"['Band', 'Brothers', 'doubt', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'monumental', 'mini-series', 'ever', 'be', 'shown', 'television', 'When', 'see', 'most', 'war', 'movies', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'battle', 'one', 'campaign', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'mini-series', 'format', 'see', 'around', '12', 'hours', 'film', 'couple', 'years', 'war', 'Thus', 'get', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'depth', 'detail', 'do', 'standard', 'war', 'movie.The', 'series', 'one', 'company', '101rst', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'company', 'men', 'time', 'are', 'trained', 'U.S.', 'deployment', 'Britain', 'Normany', 'Invasion', 'campaign', 'liberate', 'France', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'Bastogne', 'invasion', 'Germany', 'end', 'war', 'Many', 'episodes', 'focus', 'one', 'person', 'unit', 'sort', 'primary', 'character', 'others', 'viewer', 'inside', 'bull', 'look', 'war', 'worst', 'complex', 'relationships', 'develop', 'men', 'who', 'face', 'together.This', 'mini-series', 'was', 'brain', 'child', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'subject', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'popular', 'historians', 'Ambrose', 'able', 'bring', 'story', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'life', 'soldiers', 'point', 'view', 'book', 'others', 'such', 'Citizen', 'Soldiers', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'veterans.Hanks', 'Spielberg', 'have', 'faithfully', 'taken', 'work', 'along', 'cast', 'crew', 'have', 'produced', 'monument', 'American', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'mini-series', 'must', 'see', 'history', 'buff', 'historian', 'student', 'American', 'general', 'human', 'being', 'interested', 'moment', 'time', 'when', 'tag', 'line', 'series', 'ordinary', 'men', 'were', 'asked', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'things']",N/A

711043,A17N23WXA7EAF,B00006C7G9,"C. Colt ""It Just Doesn't Matter""","[6, 19]","""Band of Brothers"" is an excellent docudrama of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Company's training, and military exploits including D-Day, the failed Operation Market Garden, triumphant survival during the Battle of the Bulge, and subsequent forays into Germany and Austria until the Allied victory in World War II. The series contains an excellent format in which each episode is preceded by the accounts of aged Easy Company veterans who both set the tone for the drama that follows and who remind us that (unlike ""Saving Private Ryan""), this is not a Hollywood adventure film-it's the real thing. Each episode is based on a true story and none of the characters in this series is fictional.The DVD series also contains some excellent supplementary material. Each episode also includes a brief summary, biographical information of the principle individuals, and historical details about World War II, the American military, and maps that pinpoint Easy Company's progress.The most remarkable aspect of this series is that it allows us to witness life in Easy Company from a variety of situations including training, leave, deployment, and combat, as well as a variety of perspectives. We see the entire life of the company from the lowest ranking soldier, to the executive officers and we experience issues ranging from killing and surviving on the battlefield to navigating through the thick military bureaucracy.Not surprisingly, the most sympathetic people in this series are the non-commissioned officers who provide the actual leadership of the company under all circumstances. When Easy Company is lead by competent field officers such as Winters, Compton, and Spears, the NCOs simply augment their effectiveness with their own professionalism and understanding of the day-to-day realities of their men. In some situation, however, Easy Company is lead by incompetent officers such as the hapless Lt. Dike who (like our President) is given command because of his connections but proves vacant and cowardly during a crisis when leadership is most needed. In such situations, command of the company unofficially and almost unnoticeably falls to the NCOs who must hold things together and make them work in place of the leadership needed from above.Equally as interesting is the mindset of Easy Company. Veterans who have survived training and battles together command the respect of green replacements. Even returning veterans, who have missed out on a battle or two because of their wounds, are not given an instant welcome but must prove themselves on the battlefield again.""Band of Brothers"" inevitably contains many dramatic moments since it examines battlefield heroism, survival, fear, despair, killing, and the horror of seeing your buddies die. Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" however, this series manages to be dramatic without being melodramatic. ""Band of Brothers"" simply recounts events and explores some of the feelings behind those events and fortunately, it does so without moralizing or sentimentalizing as ""Saving Private Ryan"" wound up doing.After watching this series I came to see the ""greatest generation"" of World War II veterans in a new light. It's not so much that they were better than our generation or that we are worse than theirs. It's just that they had great leaders and a just foreign policy, which motivated them to unite and make sacrifices for the greater good. Unfortunately there is no such leadership or foreign policy in place today.

With modern computer technology and filming, this series is like an 8-hour Saving Private Ryan, only better.The video quality is the reason I bought a DVD player. It is so crisp and clean, you'd swear you're right there in the trenches with the 506th. The audio is probably the best 5.1 sound of any DVD I own. They made use of the surrounds constantly throughout the series.  From rain and thunder to gunfire and mortars, they sounded spectacular.The ten episodes are extremely well written and acted. Each episode centers on a specific character and event in the timeline of the war. It follows E (Easy) Company, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne as they train, parachute into, and fight their way through Europe on the way to their ultimate objective: Nazi Germany.The most compelling episode for me was 'Bastogne'. This episode follows a 506th medic as he scurries around from foxhole to foxhole trying to gather meager supplies, as well as treat the wounded. The episode purposely has a very frantic pace as he goes from man to man, trying to help where he can. The medic expends an immense amount of energy to try and save a life, only to see it snatched away. This symbolism is further demonstrated when the medic goes to a field hospital and meets a young French nurse.  The two of them build a repoire, and the seeds of love seem to be sewn. After spending time on the line, he returns to find that the hospital has been hit by artillery fire, and the nurse is dead. The nurse always wore a cloth over her hair to keep it in place, so the young medic takes it from her, a remembrance of sorts. He makes his way back to the line, only to find a man whose hand is cut badly. The medic, being out of bandages, reluctantly uses the only thing he had to remember the nurse by, the piece of fabric. Another instance of the symbolism used in this episode.I'd have to say that young people today should watch this with an open mind, and understand that this isn't Hollywood. This is fact. History. Everything in the episodes truly happened, and many of the men who did these things are still alive today.

711056,AR3RAD2DPXBRN,B00006C7G9,Christopher Farrell,"[30, 123]","Band of Brothers, Stephen Ambrose's book on E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, is an interesting and engrossing read for those who already have some background on WWII. But, sadly, it's not history - more of a reminiscience by a few select members of the company. Ambrose uses appallingly few other sources to back up the narratives, tends to focus on the stories that are convenient, and generally takes the stories of the veterans without skepticism. Nontheless, in book format, that's OK, the book has merits to make up for it, and Band of Brothers (the book) succeeds.Band of Brothers (the miniseries), though, is shorn of its ""fireside chat"" style and is throwing you into the midst of this narrative and tries to convince you it is fact, that it can convey what it was like to be there; but it can't. It can't both because the underlying history is too sugar-coated and unreliable in general (there are exceptions, of course), and because the characters have no emotional resonance. They got the blow-up sequences down (leftover effects from Saving Private Ryan, presumably - the looks is almost identical), but the writing is uneven, being unable to make the transition for the storytelling style of Ambrose to real drama with any elan. You never really get to know more than a few of the characters the way the title might suggest, and there is no sense of jeapordy since we always have an instinctive sense that the characters we get to know are those that will survive, since they told their stories and contributed primarily to Ambrose's book.Despite my generally negative feelings, there are some good spots; the one episode that stood head and shoulders above the others was the Bastogne episode; even its calculated and gimmicky ending couldn't damage an otherwise excellent narrative, one where all the exposions complimented the excellent character work instead of being the main attraction (this episode was not in Ambrose's book).To boil it down, I supose, impressive explosions do not make good drama in and of themselves and neither do they convince you of the nature of war; the miniseries has lost the sense of its title.

At first, although I was riveted by the first enstallments, I wasn't able to distinguish all of the characters; I could follow the plot just fine, but basically we're talking about a story populated by a lot of young guys in helmets and fatigues.  On repeat viewings, you're able to see background characters who will later come into the foreground, and this gives the series a fascinating complexity.This is also a collection of excellent stories, made even more awe-inspiring by the fact that they're true.  The opening installment ""Curahee"" is a great prelude to the action, and a good introduction to the mindset of the men and what it takes to make a competent leader.  ""Carantan"" contains sequences as jolting as ""Saving Pvt. Ryan.""  And the stand-out episode, ""Bastogne,"" is so harrowing and exhausting and affecting it makes one wonder why wars are fought at all.  Of course ""Why We Fight,"" in which Easy Company uncovers a concentration camp, ably answers that question.One primary thought ricoched through my brain during this entire series: I am so glad I've never been in the situations those men were because I would've awful at it, I don't think I could've done it.

711062,A6YJXMMWFZR5P,B00006C7G9,Clyde A. Dodge,"[19, 19]","The DVD release of ""Band of Brothers"" is an exceptionally high-quality home video product. For anyone interested in World War II or epic filmmaking, this is a must have.The set consists of six DVDs, five of which contain two episodes each. At first you may wonder where the audio and language options are when the main menu for each DVD appears. These menus appear once an episode title has been selected. The menu for each episode includes chapter selection, an episode summary, a variety of audio options, and in the package's only real failing, the option to have only Spanish subtitles or none at all. No English subtitles are available, so the hard-of-hearing or the script geeks (like me) who like to follow the text on the screen, will need to have TVs with built-in closed captioning.The sixth DVD includes the documentary that was aired on HBO about the real men of Easy company, as well as trailers for upcoming episodes. Additonal video features include the premiere of the series at Normandy, where the actual veterans of Easy Company were in attendance. It is great to see the actors together with men they portrayed.One feature found on every DVD, which I found incredibly useful, is the Field Guide. This has definitions of every military term used in the series. For those who have wondered about military ranks, this field guide has the complete listing of each rank, along with the appropriate isignia. Take a look at this before viewing, and the appearance of characters' uniforms will be much more meaningful.For those who saw HBO's Golden Globe/Emmy winning mini-series when it was telecast, this DVD will be a welcome way to revisit and savor this great depiction of a true story (or rather, multiple true stories). For those who have not seen it, this is the one HBO product to have. Forget ""The Sopranos,"" forget ""Sex and the City."" These are quirky products which are vastly over-rated by the critics. ""Band of Brothers,"" on the other hand, is a monumental achievement for television, rivaling the dramatic intensity of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and far surpassing every other war movie released since then except for ""Blackhawk Down,"" another true story. If you think that, because it was made for television, it will pale in comparison to its megaplex brethren, think again. ""Band of Brothers"" stages some jaw-dropping battle sequences, and follows the lives of a cavalcade of characters with deft skill. Acting, direction, editing, special effects, music...all are top-notch.A few riveting moments:Episode 2: Easy Company assaults and captures a German gun position that was firing on the landing parties at Normandy. The episode's epilog points out that this assault has become THE textbook example of how to attack a fixed position, and is still taught at military academies today.Episode 3: Easy Company holds the line against an armored assault by the Germans after the companies flanking them have fled the field.Episode 9: On patrol in the woods of Germany, Easy Company stumbles upon one of the great horrors of this or any war, a concentration camp.",5,Almost Perfect,1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,3082,"['DVD', 'release', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'exceptionally', 'high-quality', 'home', 'video', 'product', 'anyone', 'interested', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'epic', 'filmmaking', 'must', 'have.The', 'set', 'consists', 'six', 'DVDs', 'five', 'contain', 'two', 'episodes', 'first', 'may', 'wonder', 'where', 'audio', 'language', 'options', 'are', 'when', 'main', 'menu', 'DVD', 'menus', 'appear', 'once', 'episode', 'title', 'been', 'selected', 'menu', 'episode', 'chapter', 'selection', 'episode', 'summary', 'variety', 'audio', 'options', 'package', 'only', 'real', 'failing', 'option', 'have', 'only', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'none', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'hard-of-hearing', 'script', 'geeks', 'who', 'follow', 'text', 'screen', 'will', 'need', 'have', 'TVs', 'built-in', 'closed', 'captioning.The', 'sixth', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'was', 'aired', 'HBO', 'real', 'men', 'Easy', 'company', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'upcoming', 'episodes', 'Additonal', 'video', 'features', 'include', 'premiere', 'series', 'Normandy', 'where', 'actual', 'veterans', 'Easy', 'Company', 'were', 'attendance', 'great', 'see', 'actors', 'together', 'men', 'portrayed.One', 'feature', 'found', 'DVD', 'found', 'incredibly', 'useful', 'Field', 'Guide', 'definitions', 'military', 'term', 'used', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'wondered', 'military', 'ranks', 'field', 'guide', 'complete', 'listing', 'rank', 'appropriate', 'isignia', 'Take', 'look', 'viewing', 'appearance', 'characters', 'uniforms', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful.For', 'who', 'saw', 'HBO', 'Golden', 'Globe/Emmy', 'winning', 'mini-series', 'when', 'was', 'telecast', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'welcome', 'way', 'revisit', 'savor', 'great', 'depiction', 'true', 'story', 'rather', 'multiple', 'true', 'stories', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'one', 'HBO', 'product', 'have', 'Forget', 'Sopranos', 'forget', 'Sex', 'City', 'are', 'quirky', 'products', 'are', 'vastly', 'over-rated', 'critics', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'other', 'hand', 'monumental', 'achievement', 'television', 'rivaling', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'far', 'surpassing', 'other', 'war', 'movie', 'released', 'then', 'Blackhawk', 'Down', 'true', 'story', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'will', 'pale', 'comparison', 'megaplex', 'brethren', 'think', 'again', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'jaw-dropping', 'battle', 'sequences', 'lives', 'cavalcade', 'characters', 'deft', 'skill', 'Acting', 'direction', 'editing', 'special', 'effects', 'music', 'are', 'top-notch.A', 'few', 'riveting', 'moments', 'Episode', '2', 'Easy', 'Company', 'assaults', 'German', 'gun', 'position', 'was', 'firing', 'landing', 'parties', 'Normandy', 'episode', 'epilog', 'points', 'out', 'assault', 'become', 'THE', 'textbook', 'example', 'how', 'attack', 'fixed', 'position', 'still', 'taught', 'military', 'academies', 'today.Episode', '3', 'Easy', 'Company', 'line', 'armored', 'assault', 'Germans', 'companies', 'flanking', 'have', 'fled', 'field.Episode', '9', 'patrol', 'woods', 'Germany', 'Easy', 'Company', 'one', 'great', 'horrors', 'war', 'concentration', 'camp']",N/A

An extremely impressive, deeply engrossing, emotional and brutal look at combat during World War II and Easy Company following in their footsteps from boot camp till the end of the war. Easy Company took part in some of the most difficult battles, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the failed invasion of Holland, and the Battle of the Bulge, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest. Drawn from interviews with survivors of Easy Company, as well as soldiers' journals and letters, making this miniseries very accurate upon dates and events that happened. This miniseries is very moving and  captures the wide range of the realistic responses to the stress and trauma of war fear, cynicism, cruelty, compassion, and all-encompassing confusion.The writing, directing, and acting are superb throughout. The cast is largely unknown, emphasizing the team of actors as a whole unit, much like the regiment; Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston play the central roles of two officers with grit and intelligence. It's clear and is shown in this miniseries that the things these soldiers had to do are both terrible and understandable, and the psychological price they paid is made clear. This also brings forward that these wars brought out some incredible acts such as unbelievable courage and sacrifices in some people while bringing out the worst in others.

While watching these previews, I had my fingers crossed that the BoB series would not be in such poor quality. Thankfully, it wasn't. HBO should fix this flaw. Yes, I know they are just previews...but still. I want quality all-around.Overall a superb mini-series everyone should watch. This is a war-drama series with little action. We're talking 90% talky with 10% war-action. And half of that 90% is actually just long glances and gazes--seriously. Yes, I am making fun of the series. But, when you break it down, it's mostly just a lot of starring (sp?) and open jaws.I wanted more action. Don't get me wrong, I love a good talky, but I felt a lot of the action scenes in this series are short-changed. I read The Pacific brings in more action. I'll have to check that series out.Also, the supposed worse times for Easy Company--their experience in Bastogne, which is span across two episodes, did not feel as powerful as it should, atleast to me. It felt kinda empty, though it did have some memorable moments.But overall, this is a SUPERB series with beautiful cinematography, acting, scoring, and directing that deserves the many awards it has gotten.And those two comrades, forgot their names, episode 2, right after landing in Normandy, who just met up after jumping, found an active AA nest.

As it follows this group of remarkable civilian soldiers from training in Georgia thru preparations in England for participation in D-Day, on up into Market Garden, Bastogne, and into Germany itself, Band of Brothers surpasses nearly all other ""human interest histories"" and becomes one of the most engrossing, captivating, emotionally-entangling tales that will ever be made.

Historical detail was a key interest in the making of this ten part series. Many first hand accounts were used to support the on-screen drama. Some complained that the section involving E Company's seizure of Hitler's Aldershorst was inaccurate. It is true that E Company was not the first allied unit to occupy the Eagle's Nest.

This series has so many reviews here that I can't really add anything new to someone interested in buying this collection. But the 1,800+ reviews that have rated this a 5 star series is all you really need to know.Major Winters died on January the 2nd. His leadership, which is displayed greatly in this series should be inspirational to all. He led without arrogance or a sense of bravado. His calm demeanor instilled confidence in the men who surrounded him in times of battle. He was a humble man. His decision making was always with the best interests of his troopers in mind.After the war ended Mr.Winters lived on a farm in Fredericksburg and built his own home. He didn't talk about the war, until the years leading up to Mr.Ambrose's "" Band Of Brothers"". The men that served under him had tried to get him the Medal Of Honor- but their attempts were unsuccessful. Mr.Winters is probably happier with the thoughts of his men than any medal he could be awarded.I had the original dvd series for many years. And like many others here I upgraded to blu ray when it was available- its amazing on blu ray. I have a tradition every winter when my area is about to get its first big snow of watching the series again- the Bastogne scenes coupled with the snow and cold winter here seem to go together for me.I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys history.

Thurlow,"[3, 3]","2001's ""Band of Brothers"" is Tom Hanks' and Steven Spielberg's absolutely superb dramatization of Stephen Ambrose's account of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  Originally aired on HBO as a mini-series, and later on the History Channel, the DVD collection includes all ten episodes plus some extra features on the making of the series.Each episode captures a piece of the story of Easy Company in the Second World War: The stand-up of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Toccoa, Georgia; the two brutal years of tough training that bonded the men together; the D-Day airborne drop into France and the fight for the Normandy beachhead; the drop into Holland as part of Operation Market-Garden; the desperate defense of Bastogne at Christmas 1944; the fight into Germany in 1945; and occupation duty in Austria at the end of the war.The series clears shows its extraordinary production values and dedication to authenticity.  The producers wisely chose a collection of relatively unknown actors; at the time of production, only ""Friends"" alumni David Schwimmer was well-known. The cast are allowed to inhabit their characters over the course of the series.  Damon Lewis and Ron Livingston are perfect as the two young officers at the center of the narrative. Lewis portrays Dick Winters, arguably the hero of Ambrose's original narrative and one of the featured speakers in the commentary by the real veterans of Easy Company, sprinkled throughout the episodes.Each episode is a complete story by itself, typically centering on one or more members of Easy Company.  The look at war is tough, realistic, unflinching, capturing the tough choices and tough deals that war hands out, yet ultimately sympathetic to the young men who made up Easy Company.  A brief retrospective at the end captures some of the fates of the Easy Company soldiers and reinforces the point of the series.  These were ordinary Americans who came together to form a nearly unbreakable unit through three years of war; the survivors went on with their lives afterward, but were forever changed by their experience together.""Band of Brothers"" is most highly recommended as a superb, even unmatched viewing experience and as a valid piece of history in its own right.

I was so impressed with the effort put into Saving Private Ryan to give it a documentary look and feel. Band Of Brothers falls from the same tree. Once again, Hanks and Spielberg reunite to produce this epic cable series of WW2 as told by the men themselves. Every episode has interviews from the soldiers who were there. Very realistic and emotional stuff.First off, the set comes in a metal box with fold out style disk holders. Exactly like the standard dvd edtion a few years ago.The Blu-Ray edition has 6 disks total. 2 episodes per disk on the first 5 with many, many extras on number 6.The quality of the picture is perfect. These films were shot with tons of natural grain for that documentary style look. The lenses also give the look of a 40's camera used in the field. Although the film itself is washed out and very rough, it has awesome detail. You will notice so many things going on in the background. The size of the shots sometimes leave you in awe. The blacks are sometimes unstable, but that is the intent. The daytime scenes are beautiful in their full scope. The greatest thing about this series is the uncompromising attention to detail. From the uniforms to the weapons. The skintones are spot on and very nice looking with great detail. The majority of these episodes were shot outdoors. So, the landscapes look fantastic! From the coast of France, to the mountains of Austria, this has some amazing and beautiful scenery. While the picture may be "" washed out "", it looks and feels just as you would expect from the point of view from a combat photographer. The battle scenes are simply unbelievable. It takes you to a new level realism.The sound is second to none. You will easily be blown away with the audio track quality. You have to turn down the volume at many points during battle scenes. The voices are crisp and clean, but the battle scenes really rock your sound system. All of your speakers get a good workout. The subwoofer really hammers out the explosions. The rear speakers have tons of gunfire from all directions, as do the side speakers. You will have a true surround sound experience. Many movies do not make full use of the full audio possibilities. This one does!There are great extras here as well. Great in depth interviews from the soldiers themselves. A really cool making of documentary called "" We stand together: The men of easy company "" And many other things for the history buff. Cant say enough about this product. If you are a war genre lover, this is one of the best. If you love history, and dont want a watered down, made for Hollywood war film. This is how it happened as told by the men of the 506th E Co. You will have a new respect for these guys who gave so much. It is hard to believe that some people could give so much for so little. Thank god they did.",5,Probably one of the best war films ever made.

The portrayal of the airborne infantry during World War II is stark, unsentimental, and at times very unpleasant.  We're glad for such a detailed portrayal over the course of the US' involvement in World War II, and for the dramatization of details that would otherwise be lost to history.  In the end, no one in their right mind would think the European theater was anything but horrific for these infantrymen.We see in the first episode that the men of Easy Company are human - fallible, ordinary, and in some cases mediocre.  At the final episode, we see that the strengths and weaknesses of each member of Easy Company contribute to the unit's combat success. The names for the most part are real.  The cliches are out the window - some of the men were strong, a few were weak, but all were heroes.  I don't know if I needed to know the name of the first failed company commander, or the name of a unit member who committed a petty crime...but in the end all of these men contributed to the astonishing combat success of Easy Company, whether they intended to or not.It's shocking to see how young the actors are...didn't we just see some of them in a music video?  However,  in many cases, the men they portrayed were even younger.  In the D-Day episode, we are treated to a near non-stop barrage of sound effects - anti-aircraft, artillery, and naval gunfire.  It continues for nearly an hour, and doesn't stop for breath.

711149,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00006C7G9,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[41, 44]","This superbly acted and directed DVD centers around the troopers of Company E (Easy), of the 506th (5 Oh 6th) Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), 101st Airborne Division (Screaming Eagles) from their training in Camp Toccoa and Curahee Mountain in Georgia through part of the occupation of Germany after victory in Europe.Their story begins with interviews of the now older men who recount how they volunteered for the airborne (paratroops). Thoughtfully, the director did not include the questions from the interviewer, only the accounts of the veterans. These accounts precede and conclude most episodes.The men, like the title of the song of the Screaming Eagles, have a ""Rendevous with Destiny"" engaging in some of the most important campaigns of World War II. They were dropped in Normandy just prior to D-Day, Holland in Operation Market-Garden, defended Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, liberated a concentration camp, were the first to occupy Hitler's lair in Berchtesgarden, and occupied some of the most beautiful country (I have ever seen) in Salzburg, Austria.This is a story about men, not war. It is a story about civilians who became the army's elite--paratroopers, and developed a brotherhood from the nightmare of their shared experiences, and the losses of their fellow troopers. The non-commissioned officers held their company together inspired by officers with outstanding leadership skills, or in spite of officers with dismal ones.The story concludes with answers to the question of whatever happened to the men. We learn of how they reentered civilian life, and when some of them died. We see the older veterans attending their reunions and their grown children telling the camera how they never knew what their fathers went through because they didn't talk about it. Fittingly, the story ends with former Major Winters who was one of the commanders of Easy Co. telling us that his grandson asked him if he was a hero in the war. ""No,"" he replied, ""but I served in a company of heroes.""Spoken like a true leader.Don't pass this one by. This is a story about our fathers and grandfathers.

711157,A4FAPQKQQLJY1,B00006C7G9,Elite,"[6, 6]","Band Of Brothers follows the path of Easy Company (of the 101st Airborne Division) during WWII. When I had first heard of this mini-series being made, I was excited by the prospect of Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks teaming up. Obviously their other WWII collaberation (Saving Private Ryan) was a success. Right away I knew this was going to be good. I just didn't realize it was going to be THIS good. This is easily the best mini-series I have ever seen. The production qualities pass some major motion pictures being made these days. Each episode is around an hour long (some running a bit longer), even though they all could have been two hours and I wouldn't have complained.Like I said, this is the true story of Easy Company. Easy Company fought in many of the major battles during WWII. Boot Camp, D-Day, Battle Of The Bulge, Holland, finding a concentration camp & even capturing Hitler's 'Eagle's Nest' is chronicled here. What I think I like best about this series, besides the production values & aboslute class everything in the series is done in, is that not every episode is just about some battle the company went through. The characters are well developed, so when they die you will actually care. And the little touches put into the series is amazing.Even though the cast if filled with mostly (at the time) no-name actors, the acting is outstanding. I especially liked Damian Lewis in the role of Lt. Richard Winters. Ever since I saw this series back in 2001, I have wanted to see him in some movies. Ron Livingston plays Easy's intelligent officer, and one of the other 'central' characters here. Donnie Wahlberg, Matthew Settle, Neal McDonough, David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, and even Tom Hank's son Colin play important roles in this tale. I can't remember the names of all of the other actors in the series, but they are great overall. Even Dale Dye is great here. Of course, what's a war movie without Dale Dye in in though?On top of the great acting and story, this is one great looking series. Some of the shots just make your jaw drop. I also love how it is shot in a washed out look. Only toward the end of the series when Easy captures the Eagle's Nest, does the series have a colorful and bright look to it. I must also commend Michael Kaman for his beautiful opening score. The rest of the music during the series is also top notch.It's hard to put into words how good everything is done in this series. By the time you are finished watching the opening credits of the first episode, you will know you are watching something special. I love how they put short comments from some of the original members of Easy Company at the beginning of some of the episodes. Some are very emotional and almost bring you to tears.One episode that stood out to me in particular that could have been a movie in it's own right was part seven. This is the best hour of television I have ever seen in my life. It's a visual sight to behold and will get you emotionally more than you would expect. The same could be said for part nine, which has Easy Company finding a concentration camp. I felt really disturbed after watching that one and it really shows how evil war can be.If you are fan of war movies in any way, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. If you are a fan of good cinema or TV, you owe it to yourself to go pick this up. This is not only the most amazing mini-series ever created, it's a true story of a group of men that were thrown together in a horrible war and ended up becoming heroes.Special Features: There is an 80 min. documentary on Easy Company's path through the war as told by some of the living members. It's very interesting and pulls at your heart strings at times. Very well done. Then there is a 30 min. 'making of' documentary by HBO. This isn't near as good as the first documentary, but it's a decent watch. You also get Ron Livingston's video diaries, which show what it was like to go through Dale Dye's actor boot camp. This lightens up the mood quite a bit and is interesting, as well as humorous.Before each episode you can access a 'Field Guide' to the series. This basically explains the ranks, who's each character, where the story is, etc. This would be helpful if you skipped episodes and wanted to pick the story back up quickly or are confused about which character is which. I didn't find much use for this, but it is great to have it nonetheless. Overall I liked the special features quite a bit and didn't feel shorted whatsoever. If I could give this DVD set ten stars, I would.

Some might just dismiss it as another in a long line of war films, which would be too bad. Band of Brothers is among the best war films I've ever seen, and don't let the made-for-TV label dissuade you. This may be a miniseries, but few films have achieved the epic scale and attention to detail this work creates.The miniseries' focus is on Easy Company, elite paratroopers fresh out of training and ready to make their drop over Normandy pre-D-Day. They're led by Lt. Richard Winters, a young, but intelligent, clear-headed officer who proves effective in the heat of combat. The film concentrates on Easy Company's journeys and battles through war-torn Europe, as well as the men themselves, and the growing effect war inflicts upon each of them.As Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks' second collaboration, Band of Brothers is a monumental achievement that approaches Saving Private Ryan in its ability to place you in the heat of combat. This miniseries isn't quite as successful with character development, mainly because the huge cast makes it hard to tell some people apart, especially when their faces are covered with dirt and grime, a consistent sight you'll get used to here.But the attention to so many details (including the characters) is what makes Band of Brothers a triumph. Most notable is a scene not long after the parachute drop, when one of the members of Easy Company encounters a German prisoner, who's actually from America, but fights on the opposite side because of his ethnic background. There's even a fairly in-depth description and meaning behind a flower that a dead German soldier has pinned to his buttonhole, a historical detail I was never familiar with (see, TV does teach you stuff).Most of the series is concerned with the camraderie among the members of Easy Company. And despite a cast of relatively unknown actors, there's not a weak performance throughout. As Richard Winters, Damien Lewis excels, displaying the admirable qualities that made this man so respected and beloved among his men. It's a superb performance, and hopefully it's the beginning of a great career for Lewis. The other standouts in the cast include Neal Mcdonough as an initially gung-ho soldier who undergoes the greatest transformation after he's shot in battle, Donnie Wahlberg as a thoughtful private who's quickly promoted through the ranks, and Matthew Settle as an enigmatic soldier who's so calm in the heat of combat, he almost becomes a living legend.Puncuating the moments of character interaction are the battle scenes, which are numerous, graphically violent, and often ferociously intense. Given the miniseries' 10 hour running time, you should prepare yourself for probably more battle action than any war film you've ever seen. The combat presented is harrowingly realistic, often resembling Spielberg's own work in Saving Private Ryan (methinks the fact he served as executive producer here is the main reason for all the similarities). The standout segment is the drop over D-day, sporting the most hair-raising aerial combat I've ever seen. The sight of paratroopers desperately trying to make their jump as flak threatens to down their plane is among the most terrifying sights I've ever seen.The other battle sequences focus on infantry combat.  The miniseries does an excellent job of conveying rigorous gun battles and ubiquitous artillery.  These scenes display a fair amount of clever strategy, particularly when Easy Company tries to disarm several German artillery sites, and do an excellent job of showing the difficulty of fighting in a variety of different settings (small towns such as Carentan, as well as snow-covered forests and villages).The production values are all first-rate. The special effects are mostly outstanding and the miniseries truly has the look and feel of the time period. Without a doubt, every penny of this 125 million dollar budget was well-spent.  Less successful than the production is Michael Kamen's score, which is actually pretty good; there's at least one adrenaline-pumping, rousing theme, but the music threatens to turn into schmaltz during the quieter moments.While dramatically powerful, Band of Brothers is never quite emotionally devastating (unlike Saving Private Ryan, which is what makes BOB slightly inferior to it), with perhaps the exception of Part 9, which focuses on the discovery of a concentration camp. It's eerily disturbing, horrific, and every bit as graphic as what was featured in Schindler's List. Band of Brothers is flawed, but its pros by far outweigh the cons.

You'll not regret it, and without question you'll watch all ten hours multiple times.Band of Brothers is a well-crafted, well-produced ten-hour epic following the exploits of one World War II Company from their pre-combat training, through D-Day and on through the end of the war. While it focuses on this one company - Easy Company - the series is without question epic in scope, featuring hundreds of actors, a huge cast, fantastic sets that capture WWII Europe and magnificent combat scenes.On the personal side, Band of Brothers allows you to get to know a rotating cast of core characters very well, with most of camera time focusing on a solid six to eight soldiers in Easy Company. The performances throughout are excellent, giving you a good understanding of and sympathy for the men portrayed on screen. Lovers of war film camaraderie will love large portions of this series (which, to me, is almost more of a ten-hour film than a miniseries) thanks to some good chemistry.On the epic side, Band of Brothers shines, mixing equal parts Saving Private Ryan and A Bridge Too Far to give viewers a sense of the grand scale in which this small band is fighting. The vistas are stunning, the action powerful, and fighting brutal. From the huge drop the night before D-Day to sieges of French towns to the shelling at Bastogne and more, this series thrills with its exciting, often gruesome combat footage.No, the price tag on this hefty set isn't small, but it's undoubtedly worth it, as you'll want to watch your favorite installments over and over again. Even if this set featured only the very best episodes (2, 3, 5, 7, and the very moving 9) it would be worth every penny.

This should win all 19 Emmey Awards it's been nominated for.The book ""Band of Brothers"" by Stephen Ambrose (the basis for the series) is a great read as well and the series follows the text almost to the letter.

This DVD set is a must for anyone who is interested in military history or simply a compelling story.  Truth is stranger than fiction.  It is also more compelling.The 10 episodes are generally good but there were one or two that I did not think measured up to the rest.  Each was directed by a different director and took different views of the events from the book.  With each episode being somewhat encapsulated by this, yet the series is basically, chronological.  In turn this makes the 600 or so minutes of program go through many emotional and stressful change ups.My personal favorites are the first three episodes and the holocaust episode.  The first two do a great job of setting up the company and the individual men.  The thirs is D-Day and does an incredible job of showing how terrible and confusing combat is.  The Holocaust episode I thought was one of the strongest though.  It was simply a fine example of soldiers coming across a concentration camp and not knowing exactly what it was about.  The horrors and atrocities speak for themselves and are very much put into the context of the episode rather than preaching the obvious facts that Nazi's were despicable.From a production values perpective, Band of Brothers is incredible.  Watching the ""making of"" really illustrated how much effort went into the show.

Scenes tend to stick with you; the artillery barrage in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge (with one soldier being badly wounded, and his cohort suffering the same fate while trying to help him).  A young Medic befriends a Belgian nurse in a church, only to later find the building she was treating the wounded in destroyed - and her most likely dead.This is as real as a war film can get.  It has the same look that 'Saving Private Ryan' had.  The airborne drops, the artillery, the gruesome wounds, the pain and fear held within until the battle is over.  'Brothers' grabs and shakes you - this is something like what our WWII veterans carry inside them.  The memory of dead friends, the fear of making new ones because they will most likely die fast due to lack of combat experience.My dad was one of those soldier/brothers; he fought in that poor sister to the famous D-Day campaign in France: Italy.  It was a filthy, slogging mess, with vicious fighting in such places as Salerno, Anzio, and Monte Cassino.  Italy was the first place American soldiers confronted the Germans on the European Continent, but was placed on the back burner after June 6, 1944.War is indeed a terrible thing - just ask our young men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan today.  It is not glorious or wonderful.  It is bloody, murderous hell.  It is long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of high adrenaline, sheer terror.  It is devotion to those Brothers and Sisters around you - and it is carrying the crystal clear memories of all of it for the rest of your life here on earth.  And 'Band of Brothers' comes as close as possible to actually being there with them.Thanks, Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, and all those involved in bringing us this most striking example of filmmaking.

While each episode is a masterpiece, for some reason episode 6 ""Bastogne"" seemed to especially resonate for me and it was impossible to watch this episode without viewing it through tears.There's not much more to say than ""Band of Brothers"" may be the finest film, television, whatever you want to call it that I've ever seen.",5,Bar None:  The Finest Television Series Ever,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",2005,1250,"['Make', 'mistake', 'most', 'powerful', 'mini-series', 'have', 'hit', 'television', 'certainly', 'finest', 'television', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'easily', 'Roots', 'Holocaust', 'one', 'seminal', 'works', 'television', 'impossible', 'not', 'follow', 'series', 'garner', 'respect', 'men', 'being', 'portrayed', 'Easy', 'Company', 'soldiers', 'war.Although', 'billed', 'mini-series', 'really', 'ten', 'hour', 'film', 'such', 'sweeping', 'power', 'words', 'practically', 'fail', 'describe', 'overwhelming', 'emotions', 'experienced', 'watching', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'boot', 'camp', 'end', 'war', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'see', 'hopes', 'lives', 'dashed', 'promise', 'living', 'unfulfilled', 'too', 'many', 'cases', 'just', 'what', 'ravages', 'war', 'cost', 'all.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'terrifyingly', 'realistic', 'reenactments', 'acting', 'direction', 'attention', 'detail', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfect', 'episode', 'masterpiece', 'reason', 'episode', '6', 'Bastogne', 'seemed', 'especially', 'resonate', 'was', 'impossible', 'watch', 'episode', 'viewing', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'say', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'may', 'be', 'finest', 'film', 'television', 'want', 'call', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

It focues on Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne. Unlike the book, it focuses on many of the people in the company, from the Lieutenants to the private.Episode One is a kind of drama comedy type thing. It begins with the company training in Camp Taccoa with their first CO, played by David Schwimmer from Friends. It follows them from here to the take off of the 101st to Normandy.The second episode takes place in Normandy. It begins with great special effects of the landing in the company. From there it shows the handful of the E Company men that came down in the right place take some artillery enplacments.The third episode is on the of the first episodes to focus on mainly one man. The company is still in Normandy and forming up. Albert Blithe, a private, is the main guy in this one. He is a coward and it shows how he overcomes his fears. Also in this episode the company takes Carentan and a ridge. They then return to England.Episode four is the drop into Holland. E Company takes part in Operation Market Garden. Bull Randlemen is the main guy in this one, is a Sergeant who has many replacements to handle.Episode Five is in Holland as well. We focus on the current Captain of the comapany in this one and see a platoon take dike.Episode six is one of the most terrifying episodes there is. It is in Bastogne in the battle of the bulge where the 101 is surrounded. Medic Eugene Roe is the focus in the this one where we see how bad the casualties were in this battle and the sacrafices of the medics and women volunteers in the war.Episode 7. This one is the most sad one of the ten. We see many people we like die in shellings and a man break. The company takes a village.Episode eight. Tom Hank's son is in this one as a replacment Lieutenant who becomes friends with a private in the company. The company is ordered by regiment to go across a river they are watching to take prisoners in a patrol.Episode nine. Easy Companys in Germany and some men who are out on patrol find a concentration camp. In this episode you will see many men who look so hardended by combat but that the concentration camp is too much from them.Episode ten. Easy Company takes Hitler Eagles Nest in this one and goes to Austria where they live a dream life. But they dont enjoy this too much because the division is going to Japan.Overall this is one miniseries and war movie you have to see.",5,A Good Look at Combat in World War II,1123200000,"08 5, 2005",2005,2499,"['Band', 'Brothers', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'what', 'soldiers', 'went', 'world', 'war', 'II', 'Easy', 'Company', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'book', 'many', 'people', 'company', 'Lieutenants', 'private.Episode', 'One', 'kind', 'drama', 'comedy', 'type', 'thing', 'company', 'training', 'Camp', 'Taccoa', 'first', 'CO', 'played', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Friends', 'here', 'take', 'off', '101st', 'Normandy.The', 'second', 'episode', 'place', 'Normandy', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'landing', 'company', 'handful', 'E', 'Company', 'men', 'came', 'down', 'right', 'place', 'take', 'artillery', 'enplacments.The', 'third', 'episode', 'first', 'focus', 'mainly', 'one', 'man', 'company', 'still', 'Normandy', 'forming', 'up', 'Albert', 'Blithe', 'private', 'main', 'guy', 'one', 'coward', 'how', 'fears', 'Also', 'episode', 'company', 'Carentan', 'ridge', 'then', 'return', 'England.Episode', 'four', 'drop', 'Holland', 'E', 'Company', 'part', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'Bull', 'Randlemen', 'main', 'guy', 'one', 'Sergeant', 'who', 'many', 'replacements', 'handle.Episode', 'Five', 'Holland', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'current', 'Captain', 'comapany', 'one', 'see', 'platoon', 'take', 'dike.Episode', 'six', 'one', 'most', 'terrifying', 'episodes', 'Bastogne', 'battle', 'bulge', 'where', '101', 'surrounded', 'Medic', 'Eugene', 'Roe', 'focus', 'one', 'where', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'casualties', 'were', 'battle', 'sacrafices', 'medics', 'women', 'volunteers', 'war.Episode', '7', 'one', 'most', 'sad', 'one', 'ten', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'like', 'die', 'shellings', 'man', 'break', 'company', 'village.Episode', 'eight', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'son', 'one', 'replacment', 'Lieutenant', 'who', 'friends', 'private', 'company', 'company', 'ordered', 'regiment', 'go', 'river', 'are', 'watching', 'take', 'prisoners', 'patrol.Episode', 'nine', 'Easy', 'Companys', 'Germany', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'out', 'patrol', 'find', 'concentration', 'camp', 'episode', 'will', 'see', 'many', 'men', 'who', 'look', 'so', 'hardended', 'combat', 'concentration', 'camp', 'too', 'much', 'them.Episode', 'ten', 'Easy', 'Company', 'Hitler', 'Eagles', 'Nest', 'one', 'Austria', 'where', 'live', 'dream', 'life', 'dont', 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'division', 'going', 'Japan.Overall', 'one', 'miniseries', 'war', 'movie', 'have', 'see']",N/A

711202,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,B00006C7G9,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[5, 5]","Without a doubt, HBO's mini-series based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book _Band of Brothers_, is the best war film ever produced! Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks has proven unequivocally that the old adage &quot;truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction,&quot; holds true. Realism and an undauted quest to bring to the screen the actuality of the combat experience in an infantry company, resonates in the countless themes exhibited throughout the film. The production team, that consisted of eight directors, including Hanks, has accomplished an extraordinary feat both on and beneath the surface of this remarkable mini-series. What the viewer sees in this action-packed movie will delight the staunchest war film aficionado. The directors utilize the same revolutionary cinematography techniques first seen in Spielberg's prior effort, &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; The chaotic hand-held camera work places the viewer right in the heart of the battle scenes. The addition of all the latest computer generated special effects, clearly confirms how great a war movie can be when backed by a big budget (lucky for us Spielberg is a World War II buff). The night jump over Normandy is arguably the best battle sequence ever shot on film. But it is the countless themes beneath the surface of the film that makes &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; a true gem, and destined to become a film classic. Let us always remember that this is not only the story of an elite Airborne company, but of the actual men who made up Easy Company. The Army succeeded in molding these men into a fine-tuned combat effective team through the most intense, rugged mental and physical training. Individuality is discarded and team-work is exemplified if one is to survive in combat. Yet regardless of the level of training, it is human beings that are sent into combat, and Easy Company's rank and file consisted of individuals of varying and diverse human attributes and character defects. And the film illustrates the &quot;humanity&quot; of Easy Company beautifully. The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment had good and bad leaders. The outstanding and natural leadership abilities of its level-headed commander Captain (later Major) Richard Winters (Damien Lewis) are off-set my many who could not make the grade. Anyone in a managerial position at any corporate level would benefit from watching the varying leadership styles depicted in this film. Likewise, a handful of youths filled with a volatile mixture of naivety and bravado will, through fire and death, become a solid cadre of N.C.O's. Their role is vital not only to a successful combat mission, but also to the survival of green replacements. Yet the horrors of war affected all ranks within Easy Company and the producers wisely chose not to sugar-coat anything. Alcoholism and the murder of enemy prisoners by officers and enlisted men alike, are very real themes boldly conveyed in the film. Combat exhaustion, or &quot;battle fatigue&quot; is another unpleasant topic displayed in the film. Men who could not be broken physically (several of Easy Company men recovered from wounds and went A.W.O.L from hospital to rejoin their unit), succumbed to the mental strain of constant exposure to enemy fire. Looting, murder and a general callousness towards the German civilian population after witnessing the horrors of a concentration camp, are also very real occurrences that took place within the entire European Theater at war's end. Band of Brothers is not only an action-packed and riveting war picture, but also an accurate social history of the American G.I. in World War II. Any combat veteran, particularly those who fought in Europe, can relate to the experiences (both internal and external) of these men. Any relative of a combat veteran, regardless of what unit he served, will gain a better understanding of their loved-one's experiences. Captains Winters, Nixon; Lieutenant Speirs, Compton; Sergeants Lipton, Martin, Randleman, Toye, Guarnere, Malarkey and others are not made-up characters, they are real men. And it is their real-life experiences, so accurately captured in this film that defies any screenwriter's pen. I cannot recommend this package highly enough.

711204,A33JPVYZOTTB8Q,B00006C7G9,Growly Pants,"[7, 10]","Simply the BEST ""television"" show ever produced. No questions. This is flawless, a real masterpiece. Thank you Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for bringing ""Saving Private Ryan"" to our television sets. Actually, I believe this should have been a movie. I dont care how long it would have run, people would have sat through it. But with todays televisions and surround sound systems, ones home theater if often just as impressive as the local mega-cinema.Anyway.....on to the review. I cannot stress enough how well done this show is. With interviews with the REAL men featured in this epic, it really gives the viewer a sense that they're watching a moving, bleeding, crying, biography. What these men went through!!! The series begins in the U.S. military boot camp, where recruits are preparing, both mentally and physically, for the rigors of combat (if one can actually PREPARE for such a thing). Although the first couple of episodes are a little slow at times, they are important to understand the cohesion of the military units and how this cohesion was obtained. But once D-Day arrives......the action REALLY heats up.Being dropped over Normandy on the night before D-Day so they can take important bridges and roadways from the Germans, as well as knocking out big artillary guns that can reign hot metallic death upon the troops landing on the Normandy beaches from MILES away, the boys (and they are just boys) of the 101st Airborne, Easy Company are loaded into gliders and troop transport aircraft for what they were TOLD would be an easy parachute drop into occupied France.As soon as these terrified, shivering, airsick men cross the coast onto coastal Normandy.....all hell breaks loose. Antiaircraft fire literally paints the sky from one end of the horizon to the other. Many planes are blown out of the sky and drop, in flames, to a fiery death below. Others are shredded by shrapnel, tearing apart the young men who are experiencing the horror of combat for the first time, sending them tumbling to the ground below. The pilots panic, they know they're gonna get killed if the dont get out of there ASAP, so they unload their cargo and,in 99% of the cases, they were WELL short of their planned landing sites.Easy Company bails out, hot shrapnel exploding in the air around them, the smell of cordite and gun powder burning their nostrils and seeping into their clothes. They're breathing hard, often hyperventilating. Their eyes are huge with fright. Some wet their pants. Some are shot to pieces by German ground troops as they float lazily through the hell that's surrounding them.When they land, they are lost. Lost in a foreign country where almost everyone they encounter is going to try to kill them. And they dont speak the language. They ditch their parachutes and head out in an attempt to hook up with their buddies.......with ANYONE who looks familiar, any American will do. Little by little they begin to find other Americans. One or two here, another couple of guys there. The men they're running into (sometimes literally) are often from other divisions, but who cares, they're still friendly faces.They begin to form little units and attempt to find their way to a meeting point or to where they were SUPPOSED to be originally. Often times, they encounter German soldiers. They hide in mud and flooded fields, they duck behind trees and hide in farm houses. Some are killed. They're as quiet as they can be. Their breath coming in short, frightened bursts. These ragtag groups of ""brothers"" band together and set out to do what they were THERE to do.By morning, many of the stragglers had met up at a local Norman town, waiting for their buddies and for their commanders, many of whom NEVER arrive. ""Band of Brothers"" is a war story, but first and foremost, its a story of friendship, dedication and commmitment.The series follows Easy Company from this horrific landing, through Operation Market Garden in Holland to the Battle of the Bulge and finally, to V-E day. Its a fabulous story, filmed in the same fashion as ""Saving Private Ryan"" giving the viewer the feeling that they are actually THERE with the troops, ducking as the bullets scream by, the shells explode, the blood runs and the men cry. The camera men run along with the actors. Everything is filmed from the same level as the troops. As they run, the camera moves up and down, when shells explode, the camera shakes and quivers. It's really the most realistic way to film war. Anyone who's seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" knows exactly what I'm talking about. And the sound effects are equally as wonderful. Bullets actually whiz by overhead, ping off metal and rip into trees around you. Often you can see the trail of the bullets as they tear by at murderously close range. You'd jump into a bush and hide, cover your head from the branches falling around you if you could.It's extremely graphic, but its war. When someone is shot, its horrifying. They dont pause in mid step, grab their stomach, wince and fall to the ground. Their flesh is torn to pieces, bone blown out of the body, organs fall out. Blood pours freely and paints a ghastly picture on anyone in range of the spray. They scream in pain, they scream for their mothers. They die. Their buddies sob, they hold onto their bleeding, dying, disemboweled, friends and loose their minds. War is NOT pretty.Anyone who votes eagerly to go to war has never BEEN to war.At the end of this epic, I was in tears. What these innocent young boys were thrown into was enough to break even the hardest soul. But they did their job (proudly!!!!!) and some of them returned home. MANY didnt. This movie, as well as ""Saving Private Ryan"" should be mandatory viewing for all American High School students. Maybe then our future leaders wouldn't be so fast to vote for war.  The actors do a wonderful job. Many faces I had seen in other movies or television shows, many I had never seen before. Nobody super famous, but it's better that way, it's the WAR that's famous here and that gets all the attention. The emotion that these actors show was amazing, its almost (and this is gonna sound super corny) like they channeled the spirits of these fine young soldiers, portraying them with the zeal, determination and pride that they deserve.I recommend this movie to anyone. Its reality brought to the big screen. Watch it (preferably in surround sound....loud). And next time you see an old man wearing a basball hat with his batallions insignia on it, remembering something that he experienced 60 years ago, THANK HIM, for what he sacrified for you (yes YOU) is astounding. And remember those who didnt return from this war, for what THEY sacrificed........was everything.",5,"BEAUTIFUL, HORRIFIC, FRIGHTENING, TOUCHING.

711206,A12L5LKHKW8M3,B00006C7G9,"G. Soots ""Gary""","[6, 6]","I read Stephen Ambrose's 1992 book Band of Brothers in 2009 while I was laid up in the hospital due to a motorcycle accident.  As a 20 year Army Retiree and First Sergeant I have affection for reading the real stories of men in combat.  This mini-series was first aired on September 9, 2001, two days prior to 9-11.  I had not seen the mini-series until after reading the book.  With many movies it is often said not to read the book first, or that reading the book will sometimes ruin the movie.  This was not the case with the mini-series as I don't believe it made a difference one way or the other.  So here are my thoughts on this powerful work of art focusing on the bravery of the men that made up ""the greatest generation.""This is a great mini-series from many standpoints.  First the storyline is taken from the book Band-of-brothers by Stephen Ambrose.  Ambrose researched the material and conducted many interviews with the actual soldiers.  The series is a chronicle of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  The series revolves around the actual members of this unit and in particular around Dick Winters, the man who will eventually command ""Easy Company"" through the majority of combat they see in Europe.  The series begins with the men at their airborne training in Taccoa, Georgia.  Initially, the company is led by Lieutenant, later Captain, Herbert Sobel.  Sobel is hated by the men for his tyrannical approach to leadership, a method despised by Winters who would never-the-less credit some of Sobel's methods with actually helping the men in combat.  David Schwimmer, from Friends fame, does a very good job portraying the much hated Sobel.  The men begin to migrate towards Winters (Damian Lewis) as he becomes their protector.  Because of Winters and the time at Toccoa, the men of Easy Company build strong attachments that will see them through some horrific times in combat.  One key friendship is that of Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Ron Livingston.  Nixon is a fellow second lieutenant and, even though leaving the Company prior to the Invasion of Normandy, is always close to Winters.  There are many other friendships that emerge through the series and unlike fictional movies, these friendships are real and continue throughout their lives.  These friendships are very important to the 10 episode series as is the bond formed by the entire company.  This bond separates this mini-series from its follow on ""The Pacific"" an equally masterful piece about the Pacific Theater of Operation which is told through the eyes of a select few individuals and based upon their wartime memoirs.The combat begins after a train up period in England.  The second Episode ""Day of days"" revolves around the invasion of Normandy, D-Day.  The company is now in the middle of real combat, combat they have trained for yet they lose many men during the invasion.  A critical loss is that of their commander, who had replaced Sobel in England after the Easy Company NCOs threatened to resign if Sobel remained in command.  With the new Easy Company Commander gone, Winters is now moved into that role which he will hold for much of the remainder of the war until he is promoted.  The next seven episodes involve the combat operations that move Easy Company through France, Holland, and Belgium and then eventually into Germany.  The most horrific of these battles are those of Bastogne and the follow on battle of Foy.  Winters, now a Captain, has been moved up to Battalion as the executive officer.  The company suffers with the loss of his leadership which is not corrected until the battle of Foy when Winters has the Easy Company commander relieved by Lieutenant Speirs (Matthew Settles) who will be the final Commander of Easy.The series winds down with the final two episodes showing the reality of the slaughter Hitler has undertaken against the Jews and other ""undesirables"" and the dangers of a post war occupation as well.  Through all of this you follow the men of Easy and cheer their triumphs as you weep for their losses.  The cinematography is excellent as is the costuming and technical aspects of the period.  As James Cameron did with Titanic, the directors and producers of Band of Brothers painstakingly researched the time period.  They ensured they had the correct uniforms, rifles, pistols, battle sequences and other references to ensure the historical reality of the series.  Again, this chronicles real men, so the Hollywood glitz and ""bang"" of fake combat is replaced by realistic portrayal.This series is one of the truly accurate and remarkable portrayals of the life of soldiers in the World War II European Theater.  Band of Brothers will keep you entertained while reminding you of the sacrifices made for our Nation by these brave, yet humble, heroes.",5,Superb WWII Portrayal,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,4824,"['read', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', '1992', 'book', 'Band', 'Brothers', '2009', 'was', 'laid', 'up', 'hospital', 'due', 'motorcycle', 'accident', '20', 'year', 'Army', 'Retiree', 'First', 'Sergeant', 'have', 'affection', 'reading', 'real', 'stories', 'men', 'combat', 'mini-series', 'was', 'first', 'aired', 'September', '9', '2001', 'two', 'days', 'prior', '9-11', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'mini-series', 'reading', 'book', 'many', 'movies', 'often', 'said', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'reading', 'book', 'will', 'sometimes', 'ruin', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'mini-series', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'made', 'difference', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'powerful', 'work', 'art', 'focusing', 'bravery', 'men', 'made', 'up', 'greatest', 'generation', 'great', 'mini-series', 'many', 'standpoints', 'First', 'storyline', 'taken', 'book', 'Band-of-brothers', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'Ambrose', 'researched', 'material', 'conducted', 'many', 'interviews', 'actual', 'soldiers', 'series', 'chronicle', 'Company', 'E', '2nd', 'Battalion', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', 'series', 'actual', 'members', 'unit', 'particular', 'Dick', 'Winters', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'command', 'Easy', 'Company', 'majority', 'combat', 'see', 'Europe', 'series', 'men', 'airborne', 'training', 'Taccoa', 'Georgia', 'Initially', 'company', 'led', 'Lieutenant', 'later', 'Captain', 'Herbert', 'Sobel', 'Sobel', 'hated', 'men', 'tyrannical', 'approach', 'leadership', 'method', 'despised', 'Winters', 'who', 'would', 'never-the-less', 'credit', 'Sobel', 'methods', 'actually', 'helping', 'men', 'combat', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Friends', 'fame', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'much', 'hated', 'Sobel', 'men', 'begin', 'migrate', 'towards', 'Winters', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'protector', 'Winters', 'time', 'Toccoa', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'build', 'strong', 'attachments', 'will', 'see', 'horrific', 'times', 'combat', 'One', 'key', 'friendship', 'Winters', 'Lewis', 'Nixon', 'played', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Nixon', 'fellow', 'second', 'lieutenant', 'even', 'leaving', 'Company', 'prior', 'Invasion', 'Normandy', 'always', 'close', 'Winters', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'friendships', 'emerge', 'series', 'fictional', 'movies', 'friendships', 'are', 'real', 'continue', 'lives', 'friendships', 'are', 'very', 'important', '10', 'episode', 'series', 'bond', 'formed', 'entire', 'company', 'bond', 'mini-series', 'follow', 'Pacific', 'equally', 'masterful', 'piece', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'Operation', 'told', 'eyes', 'select', 'few', 'individuals', 'based', 'wartime', 'memoirs.The', 'combat', 'train', 'up', 'period', 'England', 'second', 'Episode', 'Day', 'days', 'invasion', 'Normandy', 'D-Day', 'company', 'now', 'middle', 'real', 'combat', 'combat', 'have', 'trained', 'yet', 'lose', 'many', 'men', 'invasion', 'critical', 'loss', 'commander', 'who', 'had', 'replaced', 'Sobel', 'England', 'Easy', 'Company', 'NCOs', 'threatened', 'resign', 'Sobel', 'remained', 'command', 'new', 'Easy', 'Company', 'Commander', 'gone', 'Winters', 'now', 'moved', 'role', 'will', 'hold', 'much', 'remainder', 'war', 'promoted', 'next', 'seven', 'episodes', 'involve', 'combat', 'operations', 'move', 'Easy', 'Company', 'France', 'Holland', 'Belgium', 'then', 'eventually', 'Germany', 'most', 'horrific', 'battles', 'are', 'Bastogne', 'follow', 'battle', 'Foy', 'Winters', 'now', 'Captain', 'been', 'moved', 'up', 'Battalion', 'executive', 'officer', 'company', 'loss', 'leadership', 'not', 'corrected', 'battle', 'Foy', 'when', 'Winters', 'Easy', 'Company', 'commander', 'relieved', 'Lieutenant', 'Speirs', 'Matthew', 'Settles', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'Commander', 'Easy.The', 'series', 'down', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'showing', 'reality', 'slaughter', 'Hitler', 'undertaken', 'Jews', 'other', 'undesirables', 'dangers', 'post', 'war', 'occupation', 'well', 'follow', 'men', 'Easy', 'cheer', 'triumphs', 'weep', 'losses', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'costuming', 'technical', 'aspects', 'period', 'James', 'Cameron', 'did', 'Titanic', 'directors', 'producers', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'painstakingly', 'researched', 'time', 'period', 'ensured', 'had', 'correct', 'uniforms', 'rifles', 'pistols', 'battle', 'sequences', 'other', 'references', 'ensure', 'historical', 'reality', 'series', 'Again', 'chronicles', 'real', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'glitz', 'bang', 'fake', 'combat', 'replaced', 'realistic', 'portrayal.This', 'series', 'one', 'truly', 'accurate', 'remarkable', 'portrayals', 'life', 'soldiers', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'European', 'Theater', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'reminding', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'Nation', 'brave', 'yet', 'humble', 'heroes']",N/A

It depicts the travails of a quiet and nonviolent private named Albert Blithe. This episode is rather reminiscent of The Red Badge of Courage, with the viewer left wondering: does Albert Blithe find courage when he shoots the German?? - or does he become everything he dreads - a killer without remorse? My favourite scene is where Cpt Speirs, the cold-blooded killer, tries to convince Blithe not to have so many qualms about combat.Not only do you get this fine psychological drama, but you also get easily the bast battle-scene in the series - the tank battles to the southwest of Carentan. You've never seen a war-film until you've seen US Paratroopers fending off German Jagdpanther self-propelled guns! The Americans even counterattack in a dramatic (and historically accurate) tank-battle: the Shermans crash into the flank of the German armoured units, forcing them to retreat.This episode is perfectly scripted and acted, and would probably be Oscar material if it had been released cinematically.EPISODE 4: REPLACEMENTSNot as strong as the first three episodes, this depicts the Arnhem Campaign. Yet another tank battle, near Eindhoven, in which the British Cromwell tanks get trounced by none other than the famous German Tiger tanks. Very impressive. I have never seen a film with such realistic German tanks. The human element concerns the hobbit-like Sgt Bull Randleman, and his replacement-squad, which has to prove itself in battle.EPISODE 5: CROSSROADSThis episode has a very impressive battle against German SS infantry at the beginning - again, very accurately recreated. Dick Winters becomes head of Battalion, leaving Easy Company to Lt Dike. Not a particularly strong episode, lacks some structure. On the other hand, this is the episode directed by Tom Hanks; and there is some fine camera-work here, with striking imagery.EPISODE 6: BASTOGNEThis episode may be the weakest of the lot, with some poor acting and not-very-compelling scripting. But it is still worth watching. Hopeless love blossoms between medic Eugene and a Belgian nurse. This is the episode where McAuliffe is asked the surrender, and replies ""Nuts!!"" Not a lot of fighting or human story.EPISODE 7: THE BREAKING-POINTThis may possibly be the best episode, along with Episode 3. This episode truly captures the horrors of war. The constant shelling at the Battle of the Bulge has dreadful consequences as some of the company begin to go crazy. They are preparing to assault the village of Foy, near Bastogne. Led by the incompetent Lt Dike, Easy Company is slaughtered in the open. This film really shows what military incompetence can do., One is gritting one's teeth and yelling at Dike to get a move on!!!EPISODE 8: THE LAST PATROLThis is also one of the best, showing the effects of combat fatigue like no other film, not even PLATOON. Easy Company is so exhausted that they wander along half-asleep. Yet they are forced to defend Alsace from Hitler's new offensive. After the slaughter at Bastogne, one a few men are left in each platoon! Most tired of all is Malarkey, one of the most overworked men in the company.Contrasted with them are Webster, a man who has not seen the company since October 1944 and is treated like an outsider; and Jones, a freshfaced Westpointer who has just joined up. The contrast between the semi-conscious, fatigued Company and these two clean, fresh soldiers is unforgettable. The title refers to the patrol raid that takes place at the end of the episode - the last fight-scene in the series.EPISODE 9: WHY WE FIGHTThis is the episode where Easy Company relieves part of the Dachau complex of concentration and labour camps. Not one of the men is forewarned about such places, and one new recruit nearly goes crazy. Despite the accurate and affecting depictions of such horrors as walking skeletons and piles of corpses, and the fact that I like Beethoven string quartets, this episode is not actually very good. It lacks a certain dramatic unity.However, it is still well worth watching, especially to see the effects on Easy Company of seeing the Holocaust. Seeing the usually stolid and unmoveable Pte Bull Randleman vomiting is not something one forgets easily.No battle-scenes.EPISODE 10: POINTSThe episode that takes place after the surrounding of the Ruhr pocket. No battle scenes. Dull episode? Hardly! The episode is dramatic and intriguing, especially when the men liberate The Eagle's Nest at Rastenburg. It is moving to see the part near the end where we are told where the men all did after the war.I think I've gassed on long enough; I'll shut up now. But each episode of this series really is like a separate war film, and each deserves its own attention. Altogether the series is extremely impressive, and constitute my favourite war films.",5,Impressive,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,5488,"['will', 'review', 'episode', 'series', 'ONE', 'CURAHEEDepicts',

If you find it as riveting as I did, you should watch the series in no more than two sittings, three at the most, or three episodes in a row. Each is over an hour, but you will get a much greater appreciation for the show as well as for the events it is based on than watching, say, one episode a day or week.  Why this is true could easily take a book-length analysis. So see for yourself.  If you are expecting a longer version of Saving Private Ryan, you'll realize your assumption is way off. Band of Brothers is far superior to the movie by Steven Speilberg, but again, you should see it for yourself. This is one DVD package that is definitely worth purchasing: it should become a classic. Or, let's put it this way: if it doesn't become a classic and is forgotten as are most TV 'mini-series', it will be a terrible day for America.  Regarding the production values, I found the series a true work of art. I'm a photographer and I viewed scene after scene, and episode after episode and could see the meticulous work that went into the filming, the lighting, the special effects, the attention to detail, etc. I've watched the series now five or six times, and every time I appreciate what I saw previously and notice details that I missed before. This is apart from the structural brilliance of many of the episodes. If you contemplate each one and review each episode's title, it becomes clear that each segment is a morality tale in and of itself. I believe the entire series took three years to make.

In a brilliant adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book, we follow the exploits of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company from training, through D-Day and until the end of the war. The writing, direction, special effects and acting are all first rate, giving the viewer a battalion-full of real characters to identify with.The series honors the ordinary heroics of the soldiers it depicts without romanticizing them. It honestly depicts the horror, terror, suffering and randomness of war. The camera work puts you right in the action, and the dialog is realistic and unromantic. You can practically smell the sweat, terror and resignation.Critics who complain that we don't get to know the men of the company miss the point; in war (unlike the movies) you don't get to keep your favorite buddies until a propitious pause in the action. The DVD shows how even these minor characters were well-limned and authentic.The special feature of the making of the series was also fascinating, showing how some of the film's special effects were accomplished.

It began just after 9/11 and was especially gripping, partly due to the ""mood"" of the nation and the fear of what lay on the horizon. I became totally absorbed by the series and never missed an episode. When it was finally released on DVD, I gladly ran to the store and paid $120 for the set, and enjoyed it all over again.When the Bluray was announced, I deliberated about the value of investing in the upgraded version. Most of the scenes are intentionally gritty, and all battle scenes have a choppy, grainy, scratched-film effect to them. I decided to rent the Bluray from Netflix, to see if it was worth the difference.WOW! I never would have believed that Bluray sharpness and clarity could add so much to a film shot with so many intentional shortcomings. I'm now on disc 2, and the set has been added to the top of my Christmas wish list, highest priority.One thing I noticed immediately, the increased detail adds more emotional contrast between the battle scenes and the shots of the calm, beautiful landscapes and villages. Also, the facial expressions are also more intense. Finally, the horror of war is even more gruesome. It's like seeing the movie for the first time, all over again.

Tom Hanks was great in that one and hearing that he and the great Spielberg were involved in this series got me to check it out though my expectations were realistic; nothing could top Ryan, I thought--I was wrong. Even if you don't particularly care for war movies, please check out this series. I promise that five minutes into the first episode you'll be glad you did.Brothers follows a unit called Easy Company from boot camp, throughout various skirmishes in the German theater, to the Jewish labor camps, and finally victory and German surrender. The trip from point A to B is oftentimes heroic, sad, and harrowing. What I like about this series over Private Ryan is that even though there are quite a few characters, you spend enough time with them to get to know them, and care for them, and admire them. Like Sergeant Spears' character, my favorite character in the series. Or Lieutenant Winters.Each series begins with surviving members of Easy Company giving his account of the campaign depicted in the ensuing episode. If I were to sum up the theme of this series with its many twists and turns it's about how adversities turn men into brothers and how that adversity can often bring out the best and worst in men. Truly unbelievable series. So many memorable scenes in this film. One of the most ghoulish and convincing scenes is the one where they discover the labor camp. The episode is called Why We Fight and I promise you it will affect you, the depth of cruelty and barbarism man is capable of inflicting on another man. My favorite episode is the third one.But it's not all drama. There's more than enough good ol' American kick-*ss action in here. Looking at this series it's hard to believe that all of this stuff actually happened. Those were some bad dudes. And that this series was made at all is a miracle in this era of style over substance.

I was avoiding it because I thought it be riddled with sappy melodrama and cliche'd characters, pitfalls (to me) of some of Spielberg's movies.  Boy was I wrong.I was browsing through the DVD selections and thought I'd give this one a try, finally: the neat metal case caught my eye and I've a penchant for watching war movies anyway.  The case had Tom Hanks name on it, so I thought maybe there's a chance that Tom held the reins on Spielberg to keep him from going overboard with the drama.I watched it over a period of two days, unable to stop watching on the first day until sleep finally began to overtake me at about 2:00am.  I watched the first 3 DVDs without a stop that day, the next two the following day.  If I could've stayed awake to watch all of them at one sitting I surely would have.  It was that good.  Even though I just finished watching it yesterday, I'm already thinking about watching the whole thing again.What I like about this series would be too long to put into words here.  Just know that it is consistently excellent throughout its 10-hour span.  The acting is top-notch with no overacting or melodrama, the direction keeps everything in line and focused, and even though it's a movie with Spielberg's name on it, special effects are NOT the driving force of this movie.What IS the driving force are the men of Easy Company, the situations they faced, and how they worked as a team to survive and move ahead.Not to be left out of the credits are the brutal battle sequences.  Think of the opening of Saving Private Ryan... times 10, filmed at the same high shutter speed that captures all the detail.  Something that also caught my eye were all the hand signals they used to talk to one another when silence was key.  Incredible.Also, the DVD picture quality itself is superb to say the least.  I have a 73&quot; HDTV and DVDs lacking in quality look terrible on it.  This is not the case with Band of Brothers.  My DVD player said the DVD plays back at a bitrate of about 7-8Mbit/s, twice the 3.5-4Mbit/s of the average DVD.

Of course, in a 10 hour mini-series, the producers and directors have the opportunity ot go into much more detail in terms of character development and to be more faithful to the book than in a 2 or 3 hour movie, which makes this production a must have for war/history buffs.The length of this production gives the viewer a much better feel for the boredom/terror of war, and a better feeling of what is was really like to be in the 101st.  Two of the latter episodes (7 and 9 I think) were particularly good, and although just as important to the telling of the whole story, I could have done with less time spent on the training in episode 1.  It took me two viewings to really be clear on who was who, since of course they all have uniforms and sometimes it was difficult to remember the specific soldiers.

I was impressed by the proper equipment and dress of the characters where most often it is not so accurate.

It follows the men of &#34;Easy Company&#34; as they go from basic jump training to the end of World War Two and gives personal details often missed in many documentaries. The story was cut short in many aspects to cover a long time span I am sure due to production time limits. Reading the book is highly recommended either before or after viewing the series as it tells more detail that is aided by the series to tell a &#34;Tale of Men&#34; who went through so much together and the bonding impact of such intense minutes in their lives and the visual aspects.A four and one half star would be a better rating as it will be one of the more defining stories of World War Two that will be a must watch for generations.

Instead, the series captures the fast-paced tempo of live combat along with the edge-of-your-seat feel that something bad could happen at any moment.I have to warn you now that this movie (very convincingly) glorifies the American soldier for his heroic actions and sacrifices in Europe during WWII (using documented factual events), so if you're one of those who think America can only do wrong, you'd better leave this one on the shelf and get something else...",5,Awesome depiction of human sacrifice by a band of brothers,1081296000,"04 7, 2004",2004,1460,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'three', 'times', 'already', 'time', 'watch', 'more', 'compelling', 'last', 'Regardless', 'what', 'views', 'war', 'are', 'amazing', 'true', 'story', 'focuses', 'quot', 'band', 'brothers', 'quot', 'group', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'lumped', 'together', 'paratroopers', 'US', 'Army', 'WWII.This', 'series', 'great', 'job', 'capturing', 'futility', 'war', 'fragile', 'nature', 'man', 'capitalizing', 'ability', 'men', 'grow', 'together', 'fourish', 'overwhelming', 'obstacles', 'bleak', 'dismal', 'life', 'times', 'war.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'actor', 'character', 'portraying', 'including', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'very', 'convincing', '1SG', 'later', '2LT', 'Lipton', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'actors', 'including', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'who', 'part', 'incompetent', 'much-hated', 'company', 'commander.The', 'combat', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'completely', 'kind', 'pyrotechnics', 'stage', 'magic', ""'d"", 'see', 'action', 'film', 'Instead', 'series', 'fast-paced', 'tempo', 'live', 'combat', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'feel', 'something', 'bad', 'could', 'happen', 'moment.I', 'have', 'warn', 'now', 'movie', 'very', 'convincingly', 'American', 'soldier', 'heroic', 'actions', 'sacrifices', 'Europe', 'WWII', 'using', 'documented', 'factual', 'events', 'so', ""'re"", 'one', 'who', 'think', 'America', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'better', 'leave', 'one', 'shelf', 'get', 'something', 'else']",N/A

711300,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00006C7G9,Joseph Haschka,"[2, 2]","BAND OF BROTHERS is categorically the best TV miniseries ever created, surpassing my previous pick, LONESOME DOVE.This 10-hour/10-episode epic was a labor of love produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the latter the lead in perhaps the finest combat drama ever made for the Big Screen, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Based on the non-fiction book by Stephan Ambrose, BAND OF BROTHERS is a visual tribute to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Its timespan is a little more than 3 years, from the summer of 1942 to the late fall of 1945. It depicts the company's training in the United States and England, its combat roles in the D-Day invasion, the subsequent Operation Market Garden, and the defense of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and ends with the capture of Hitler's Alpine retreat, Berchtesgaden, and the occupation of a scenic Austrian lake valley.There aren't enough superlatives to describe the acting, period costuming and weaponry, cinematography, and sets. It's a masterpiece of cinema verite. The actors are virtual unknowns. Perhaps this is inescapable in a script calling for the rapid turnover of personalities. Company E's full complement was 140 men - 8 officers and 132 enlisted. But, as casualties mounted, original members were replaced with new, and the cast of characters is large. The viewer never really gets to &quot;know&quot; any one soldier, with the exception of perhaps Dick Winters (Damian Lewis), who provides a continuity of sorts. Winters began as a 2nd Lieutenant commanding a platoon, and ended the war as a Major commanding the 2nd Battalion. To the degree that the storyline allows, Winters is the foremost hero in a group of heroes, i.e. all of E Company. The viewer is thus forced to identify with the unit as a whole throughout its travails and final triumph. And Lewis, a Brit who manages to lose his accent for the role, is perfect. Ron Livingston as Lewis Nixon, Winter's good friend and alcoholic but competent battalion staff officer, provides an additional thread of continuity from beginning to end.Those who've both read the book and seen the miniseries will notice differences. Some events are shown in a different sequence, as when one of the Company E troopers is killed by a freak accident with a souvenir Luger pistol. More noticeably, an entire episode is more or less devoted to the heroics of a company medic during the defense of Bastogne, while another focuses on the unit's discovery of a Nazi enslavement camp. Both subjects are given but scant paragraphs in the original book.The DVD also includes a bonus track on the nuts and bolts of the production. I watched this feature after the miniseries, and was amazed to learn that the forest setting for the defense of Bastogne episode, one of the best, was an indoor creation, snow and all!I saw the ten episodes over a couple of weeks. Perhaps a better way to do it is have all your male pals over for a one-day viewing marathon to include pizza and beer (or C-rations and canteen water in an olfactory ambience of gun oil, blood, stale sweat, exploded earth, and open latrine trenches). Oh, did I mention that this is a Guy Flick? It's about young males bonding, jumping out of airplanes, fighting, killing, getting maimed and killed, and enjoying the fruits of victory (booze, women and looting). There's no female role of significance, and no love interest. It's Warrior Life at its best and worst.",5,The platinum standard for a TV miniseries,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",2003,3468,"['BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'categorically', 'best', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'created', 'surpassing', 'previous', 'pick', 'LONESOME', 'DOVE.This', '10-hour/10-episode', 'epic', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'latter', 'lead', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'combat', 'drama', 'ever', 'made', 'Big', 'Screen', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN.Based', 'non-fiction', 'book', 'Stephan', 'Ambrose', 'BAND', 'OF', 'BROTHERS', 'visual', 'tribute', 'Company', 'E', '2nd', 'Battalion', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'timespan', 'little', 'more', '3', 'years', 'summer', '1942', 'late', 'fall', '1945', 'company', 'training', 'United', 'States', 'England', 'combat', 'roles', 'D-Day', 'invasion', 'subsequent', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'defense', 'Bastogne', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'capture', 'Hitler', 'Alpine', 'retreat', 'Berchtesgaden', 'occupation', 'scenic', 'Austrian', 'lake', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'superlatives', 'describe', 'acting', 'period', 'costuming', 'weaponry', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'masterpiece', 'cinema', 'verite', 'actors', 'are', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'Perhaps', 'inescapable', 'script', 'calling', 'rapid', 'turnover', 'personalities', 'Company', 'E', 'full', 'complement', 'was', '140', 'men', '8', 'officers', '132', 'enlisted', 'casualties', 'mounted', 'original', 'members', 'were', 'replaced', 'new', 'cast', 'characters', 'large', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'quot', 'quot', 'one', 'soldier', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Dick', 'Winters', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'who', 'continuity', 'sorts', 'Winters', 'began', '2nd', 'Lieutenant', 'commanding', 'platoon', 'ended', 'war', 'Major', 'commanding', '2nd', 'Battalion', 'degree', 'storyline', 'Winters', 'foremost', 'hero', 'group', 'heroes', 'i.e', 'E', 'Company', 'viewer', 'thus', 'forced', 'identify', 'unit', 'whole', 'travails', 'final', 'triumph', 'Lewis', 'Brit', 'who', 'lose', 'accent', 'role', 'perfect', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Lewis', 'Nixon', 'Winter', 'good', 'friend', 'alcoholic', 'competent', 'battalion', 'staff', 'officer', 'additional', 'thread', 'continuity', 'beginning', 'end.Those', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'miniseries', 'will', 'notice', 'differences', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'different', 'sequence', 'when', 'one', 'Company', 'E', 'troopers', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'souvenir', 'Luger', 'pistol', 'More', 'noticeably', 'entire', 'episode', 'more', 'less', 'devoted', 'heroics', 'company', 'medic', 'defense', 'Bastogne', 'focuses', 'unit', 'discovery', 'Nazi', 'enslavement', 'camp', 'subjects', 'are', 'given', 'scant', 'paragraphs', 'original', 'book.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'track', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'production', 'watched', 'feature', 'miniseries', 'was', 'amazed', 'learn', 'forest', 'setting', 'defense', 'Bastogne', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'was', 'indoor', 'creation', 'snow', 'saw', 'ten', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Perhaps', 'better', 'way', 'do', 'have', 'male', 'pals', 'one-day', 'viewing', 'marathon', 'include', 'pizza', 'beer', 'C-rations', 'canteen', 'water', 'olfactory', 'ambience', 'gun', 'oil', 'blood', 'stale', 'sweat', 'exploded', 'earth', 'open', 'latrine', 'trenches', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'Guy', 'Flick', 'young', 'males', 'bonding', 'jumping', 'airplanes', 'fighting', 'killing', 'getting', 'maimed', 'killed', 'enjoying', 'fruits', 'victory', 'booze', 'women', 'looting', 'female', 'role', 'significance', 'love', 'interest', 'Warrior', 'Life', 'best', 'worst']",N/A

I figured that since Hanks and Spielberg had both done a great job with Saving Private Ryan that this should be good as well. Well I was not prepared for how good this miniseries was. I was in front of the television every Sunday night to watch this masterpiece. I had never been much of a fan of films about World War II. In fact I am ashamed to say I didn't know that much about WWII except for what little I was taught in history class. I was fascinated with all of the experiences, both good and bad, these men went through. And what made this film even better was that these were real stories. These men really went through all this and so did many many more. And they did it for us. They did it for their country. These men grow and mature right before our eyes, going from young recruits to hardened battle scared soldiers. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotions this show would bring out in me. This film will make you laugh, make you angry, make you grow closer to the characters, and trust me on this one, it will make you cry. More than once I found myself crying because of the loss of someone I had grown attached to and knowing tha these were actual people that had died. And the chapter dealing with the holocaust and the camps will really open your eyes. Also before each chapter of the series we are treated to short ""introductions"" by the actual soldiers themselves. By seeing these men as they are today we grow even closer to the soldiers we see on the screen. Before I had seen Band of Brothers I had respect for the men and women who serve in our armed forces but I never really knew all that they had gone through. But now I have a deeper respect for every man and woman that has served and currently serves in our military and a deeper respect for those who have given their lives fighting for this country.

711303,AX1Z5RQ1LWMM2,B00006C7G9,j-rob-82,"[15, 17]","I know there are plenty of reviews out there about Band of Brothers but I have never written any so I decided to give it a shot here.  1st off let me say I watched the original dvd version a few years ago and I was blown away by how the series was put together I didn't care about picture quality or sound.  Though picture and sound are nice it takes a back seat to what the series is all about.  So here is about the blu ray since the day I found out it was coming out for blu ray I knew I had to absolutely get this one.  One thing I did notice that someone who isn't a HD person odds are wont care about the amazing picture quality nor appreciate it.  Some people I know can look at it and really not tell a difference simply b/c they don't have the eye for HD or HD doesn't interest them.  I think pretty much everybody should see this series whether HD or not fan of war flicks or not.  The case is pretty much the same as the original and so is the inside of the case.  I didn't have a copy of the original to compare to but as far as I remember they are basically the same packaging even though this one I think is just a little smaller.Sticking the movies in at 1st is kind of annoying though it doesn't take long you have to sit through the warnings and HBO screen.  After that I had my 1st look at the blu ray version and I must say I am amazed by the quality such as richer blacks and color detail or even blades of grass.  Though the film grain still exists I am pretty sure its intentional since it's usually in battle scenes but I rather like film grain in this type of film.  I enjoy the grittiness and the shakiness of the camera that just add to the chaos of whats being shown.  I think that is what pulled me into Saving Private Ryan is just the overall rawness and chaos that was in WWII and the sense of realism with how the films were shot camera wise like (I think its called documentary style).The audio in this version is phenomenal and the sounds are just amazing even though the dvd version had good audio this one really shines like when you hear a Thompson, Garand, or an MG firing.  I guess its more about clarity and more dynamic when you have your surround sound cranked you can really have sound that jumps out and makes you say wow which most blu rays specialize at.  It made me really appreciate the sense of realism that was put into this series like hearing outdoor ambience or distant gunfire or how everything just has a distinct sound that you like to hear over and over.For some odd reason I kept listening to one part where there was a Carbine being shot by someone I can't remember but I think is in the episode about Carnetan.  One of my favorite parts in this regard is probably when they are about to jump in Disc 1 Ep. 2 and AA guns firing everywhere and planes getting holes shot in them and everything is just chaotic inside the planes as well as the outside.  So many parts from the series stick out in this regard like hearing the mortar strikes in Bastogne its just so much in each episode it would take a long time to write about it.I understand the realistic nature of whats being portrayed and all I am doing is pointing out how great the series is put together blu ray wise and not trying to sound like I am indulging in the violence.  I believe there is a great seriousness and respect that needs to be shown in regards to what is going on.Though the movie has actors the violence was real for the men of Easy Company as with everyone else in WWII.  What really makes this series hit such emotional peak with me is the openings and the extras that are from the actual men of Easy Company and not actors.  When I hear them speak of what they saw and what they felt I would have to say Band of Brothers was the series that finally got me to think and reflect on WWII.I know some people will watch it as just entertainment but it is so much more than that.  The extra like We Stand Alone Together which is a documentary that just amazes me to hear coming from the real people and it really pulled at my emotions.  I think the ending of the documentary is one of the greatest things I have ever seen or heard that brought me to tears when Winters shows his humility and talks about his grandchild asking him if he was a hero and I am sure most fans know what I am talking about.  To me those words resonate with me when I think about WWII.  Do yourself a favor and don't skip that documentary.  I think it would be great to have watched that before seeing the movie but no big deal.Since seeing the series for the 1st time a few years ago my respect grew greatly for ""The Greatest Generation"".  Blu ray or not this is far by one the greatest series ever and I found myself wishing there were more episodes since there is just so much about these men to tell indeed it was ""The Greatest Generation"".",5,As Time Passes the Memories of What Great Men Did Should Not,1228348800,"12 4, 2008",2008,4850,"['know', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'there', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'have', 'never',

Doesn't see a lot of WWII stuff -- he was mesmerized and watched it all the way through several times.  Actively avoids it at time. This presentation rang very true to him and perhaps even spoke to him.  (My son and I have watched it many times, in both the HBO and A&E; incarnations).Based upon Ambrose's wonderful oral history of an elite light infantry company in WWII (and its leadership) the production values are simply outstanding, and it communicates a sensibility about the war that rings true to all ages -- from 10 to 85.  I personally found the series to be uneven, and lacking in continuity, principally because the medium required a focus upon different characters in different episodes and, since it was based upon real events, there are necessary gaps in continuity.  Simply read Ambrose's book, and those problems are readily solved.It is difficult to identify a comparable movie or miniseries -- perhaps Stone's Platoon (which combined the real horror with the real bonds that formed amongst the men who fought) comes closest.

Watch this series and find out for yourself.  You will walk away with a new respect for our fighting men and what it really takes to ""let freedom ring.""This series shows the human side of WWII.  From sleeping in snow crusted trenches dug out painfully, one shovelful at a time in frozen ground, to going without basic needs like jackets and shoes in the snow because supply lines were cut off.  This series is very intense and very honest.  You will fall in love with certain characters and they will die on you.This is not Hollywood; this is WWII and sometimes it is hell.I would not and could not recommend it for young children.  The violence, though not overdone, is intense.  There is one s*x scene, where they flash to the ""event"" only long enough for you to know what was interrupted by the door opening and ""time to move on.""  (The thing some parents may like about this particular scene is--tiny spoiler here--that the service person involved ends up with a very uncomfortable side effect in the middle of a battle field with no instant RX to cure it.  In other words, there are consequences for being careless with s*x.)I would recommend this series for mature children 12 and older.  If your child is not mature for his/her age, you should hold off until they are 14 or 15; however, every child should see this.This series isn't just a history series; this is a series packed full of life lessons.

711344,ABI5DQG0FBWU2,B00006C7G9,"K. Patton ""K. Patton""","[10, 55]","Just finished watching all the disks and was amused by the previous posts.  Seems Amazon has becomea soapbox for Eurotrash.  That's okay.  At least they have free speech here.  I might remind some ofour Russian Comerads that if it wasn't for the mighty U.S. bringing Joe Steel, Nikita, Leonid and company'shouse of cards down into a steaming pile, they would still be living in a third world superpower state.Now they just live in a third world state, but have free speech.  Oh, I might add that we are waiting for thebillions you owe us in lend lease aid that you never paid back.  Maybe you should read the new editionsof those communist party history books you were brought up on. If it hadn't been for Uncle Sam's aidboth in material and in drawing most of the Luftwaffe back to western europe, you'd be employed washingsome Deutche technocrat's BMW, OR be a forgotten corpse in some mass grave.For the mentally challenged who couldn't follow the story line...well I can only surmise you missed the littleschool bus once too often and still possess the disabilities you were born with.You might not agree with the depiction, but the events were based on true events and characters.  Sorry if oursoldiers weren't too fond of charging into massed MG34's, something Ivan appears to have been quite fond offor the greater glory of the Motherland, Joe Steel and Gen Chechov.  I have news for our revisionist's inthe great USSR, er sorry I mean Russia, the empire formerly known as the USSR.  Huge casualty lists does nota great struggle make nor admiration earn.  Your own communist commisars executed the equivelent of a fullUS division...10,000 men, all to instill ""patriotic"" zeal in the troops. Could you blame them for wanting to go home to Ivana and a full bottle of vodka, rather than face the near certainty of death charging into the muzzle of an MG-42? So are we to have admiration for an army that had no regard for it's own men wasting them with little regard for questionable gains?Let's remember what Joe Steel once said "" The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.""  So, the Great Patriotic war was a statistic. Let's look at those statistics...If it had not been for the invasion of Europe and the drawing away of some of the Wehrmachts finest divisions toboth Italy and France, the Soviet manpower well would have run dry earlier with devastating consequences.The Soviet Army was tapped out after the battle of Berlin where over a million were wasted fighting for the honor of capturing a pile of smoldering bricks courtesy of the US Army Air Corp and the British Bomber Command  (PS we could have done the same thing to any city in the USSR at the time with impunity after a little forward basing into France or Germany).The post-soviet revisionists need to read the declassified documents now available to learn the actual extent of their country's betrayal of thier own troops during the Great Patriotic War.I read the book then threw it across the room and into the trash.  The movie is better.  The book comes offas self promoting and congradulatory drek by a known plagarist.  Stephen Ambrose was apparently slipping in hislater years, His family book mill does not help his writing, I once assume it was a cadre of grad students ghost writing for him, now I learn that it his extended family, which would probably explain the plagiarism inat least one of his more recent works.What the movie leaves out is the often lengthy withdrawls the 101st had from the front between engagements.Something the regular line divisions never had.  This was convienently glossed over in the movie.  It makes the combat fatigue lament in the book hard to swallow when many more endured the same for longer duration.  Sure these guyswere fearless, lucky and had balls as big as all out doors.  BUT, so did the lowly dogfaces in the regular linedivisions that stayed at the front for months on end.  Let's sing their praises too.Just like the USMC, the Airborne seems to have grabbed more than their fair share of the glory and accolades due to press savy brass such as Ridgway, no slouch in the PR department.The biggest criticism I have of the movie is the now cliche interviews, not with the participants, but the ACTORS!!I mean they took the overblown actor's commeraderie lauded in the LOTR trilogy to new conceited heights!!Who gives a great goddamn about the recounting of historical events by some actor playing army soldier who was born35 years after the event, and probably slept through history class too boot?  They are obviously regurgitatingthe material given to them to prep them for the roll.  Guys, stick to acting we don't care what you think, just scream anddrop dead on cue.",4,Good Movie with flaws...Not as bad as the EuroTrash say,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,4728,"['Just', 'finished',

711346,A10610LHTIBAVR,B00006C7G9,"Kurt Carmichael ""Kurt""","[9, 79]","The only 'fact' worth speaking about from this caricature of a movie is the fact that E company suffered a 150% death rate (in other words, that its members were killed and replaced 1.5 times before war's end).  Very few soldiers made it to the end of the war on either side unlike this overglorified depiction.  Some of the more gratuitous passages in this miniseries were the liberation of concentration camps in episode 8: entitled 'Why We Fight', where it depicts the SS officer's widow scrabbling to bury dead prisoners and infers by the scene that the Germans exceeded other nationalities in organized cruelty.  People watching the miniseries forget that Hitler's Germany was a prison and anyone (Jew, German or anyone else of any rank) contradicting the authorities met a similar fate to those in the prison camps--independence was not tolerated.  The movie calls the concentration camps such as Landsberg am Lech in Germany presumptuously a ""death camp"" but what is conveniently forgotten by the miniseries is that NO concentration camp in territorial Germany was a ""death camp"" (designed primarily for killing 'undesireables'), these were apparently sited outside of Germany proper, in Eastern Europe.The miniseries is also factually wrong on the death toll; the International Red Cross (which had access to the camps throughout the war) holds that the numbers dying in the German internment camp system during the war were about 500,000.  Why then does this movie and others like it keep promoting 'the 6 million' number or some other variant (as this miniseries does) 'the 6 million jews + 5 million other nationalities'? [This author believes that the German numbers are inflated in order to make the annihilation of Ukrainian kulaks (8 million), Orthodox priests (300,000) and other non-communist Russians (more than 40 million) by our ""illustrious"" ally, Bolshevik Russia, seem more reasonable and palatable.  As this logic goes, if the Germans were more murderous than Stalin, they deserved destruction and punishment.  The fact that they were less, even much less cruel than the communist Russians, calls into question our involvement in this war, our national judgment and our choice of allies].What is not explained by the miniseries (in fact, nothing contextual is explained at all, leaving viewers in their prejudices and biases) was that the camp in question was an internment camp that had lost its supply of food and pesticide due to American Army Air Corps aerial bombardment of rail lines supplying the camp.  Without resupply, the camps became isolated starvation centers by default.  The miniseries also badly misstates medical knowledge of refeeding syndrome that existed at the time.  In the movie, the brigade surgeon (doctor) is seen warning the soldiers not to give the prisoners food due to their starved condition.  This is a scene concocted by ex post facto screenwriting. In actual fact, once ""liberated"", most camps were bombarded with food from extra K-rations provided the prisoners by well-meaning soldiers.  This abundance of food killed approximately 50% of the surviving camp inmates due to the great electrolyte imbalances caused by too much food, too quickly.  Medical knowledge thus came AFTER and as direct result of the  liberation experience, Americans killing more inmates than they saved by their 1940's-era lack of understanding about how to feed prisoners that were starving.  In general, this miniseries is another whitewash of American intentions concerning intervention (first, to stop Hitler from invading other countries and later, because of mistreatment of other nationalities), general confusion about the war and is a one-sided display of American ""justificationalism"".  About the only thing that was true was the willingness of American soldiers to loot private (non-public) German property (wine cellars, alcohol, restaurant silver utensils, ""war souvenirs"") at every turn and claim somehow that we were the 'good guys'.

Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[652, 681]","Band of Brothers is an awe inspiring and visually stunning tribute, not only to Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, but to the ""Greatest Generation.""  But for their sacrifices, would we share the freedoms we so cherish and covet to our vests today!  Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg deserve all of the awards and accolades they received for bringing this epic to HBO and now this incredible DVD box set!Part 1 - Currahee - Currahee is a wonderful beginning to this unprecedented HBO miniseries.  Outside of the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" there has never before been such a realistic series such as this one.  Currahee poignantly highlights the training that was necessary for the newly designed Airborne Infantry.  While some may think that Captain Sobel was a complete idiot, in all truth, his combat skills were obviously lacking however, as a trainer, he put Easy Company in a very good position as a well trained unit.Part 2 - Day of Days - D-Day has arrived and Easy Company makes the jump that they've been preparing two years for.  As history unfolds, the German flak has caused nearly every plane to miss their designated drop zone.  1LT Winters finds he's in Normandy, lost his weapon and his company.  He finally arrives at the assembly area and is given the mission to take out a German artillery position.  Day of Days is an excellent episode that doesn't miss out on 1LT Winters depth of emotions as he loses his first soldier in combat.Part 3 - Carentan - Easy Company is ordered in to take the French village of Carentan.  While encountering only minor resistance, they take light casualties.  After successfully taking the town, they're ordered to move on to the next objective.  En route, they encounter the German force sent to retake Carentan.  They stalemate for the evening, expecting to forge a full assault in the morning.  The Germans have other plans though and counter attack in the morning with a combined force of mechanized infantry and armor.  Fortunately for Easy Company, they are finally rescued by the 2nd Armored Division.  Shortly after this action they are lucky enough to get some R&R; back in England.  The show ends with orders back to the front and a very poignant final scene to yet another wonderful episode.Part 4 - Replacements - Replacements jumps forward to September and Easy Company is on R&R; in England.  They're called into Operation Market Garden.  Easy Company is given the mission to take Eindhoven, Holland.  They were told they would be running into light resistance.  Operation Market Garden turns into a huge failure and the Allied Forces are turned back with heavy casualties.  Sgt ""Bull"" Randleman is quite unfortunate enough to get stuck behind enemy lines.  ""Replacements"" is another excellent episode.Part 5 - Crossroads - Crossroads is one of the best shows of the whole miniseries.  Captain Winters, due to the costs of war, garners advancement from Easy Company Commander to Battalion Executive Officer.  The episode is shown, through the eyes of Captain Winters as he is preparing a report on the actions of October 5th when he led his company in the attack of a German SS position.  The more telling part is later in the episode when he gets an R&R; in Paris and the horrors of war catch up to him.Part 6 - Bastogne - To quote Captain Winters, ""we're paratroopers; we're supposed to be surrounded.""  Bastogne tells the tale, from Easy Companies point of view, about the 101st Airborne Infantry being surrounded by German forces and holding the line during the Battle of the Bulge.  This is also the combat action where the Commanding General of the 101st Airborne replied to the German Commanders request for their surrender, ""nuts.""Part 7 - The Breaking Point - January 1945 and Easy Company is on the verge of attacking the Germans in Foy, Belgium.  Due to heavy resistance, Easy Company endures nearly a month of being barraged by German artillery on the front line.  This episode is very telling as far as the how demoralizing the artillery can be.Part 8 - The Last Patrol - Easy Company is on the front line in the Alsacian town of Haguenau.  They now have the sense that the war is coming to a close, as they are just across the river from Germany.  The brigade commander orders a patrol across the border to secure German prisoners.  This episode again brings to the forefront the emotions of the soldiers as they again are counted on to accomplish their mission!Part 9 - Why We Fight - This episode is clearly the most poignant of the series as Easy Company finds and liberates a concentration camp.  Although there had been rumors of these concentration camps, no once could truly comprehend what they were about until they were faced with them!  This episode alone should've garnered several awards.Part 10 - Points - Easy Company takes Eagles Nest, Hitler's mountaintop fortress.  The company settles in as an occupation force, yet expecting to be redeployed to the Japanese warfront.  A very emotional what happened to several of the units members after the war.  Overall, this episode is a fantastic conclusion to the ""Band of Brother.""Disk SevenWe Stand Alone Together:  The Men of Easy Company - An outstanding documentary containing interviews with surviving members of Easy Company!  Once you've seen all of the episodes, this documentary introduces you to the real members of Easy Company.Ron Livingston's Video Diaries - This is an exceptional set of clips filmed by Ron Livingston,

This series in one of the best excuses for buying a DVD player.  The audio?  Never mind the battle scenes, to measure the quality of the audio mixing and resolution of this box set, just keep your ears open for those typewriter sounds in the 'peaceful' scenes!! If you didn't know better, you'd think someone in your house is really typing on an old-style Underwood.  I had to rush out of the room and check (we do have a manual typewriter)!Of course, I did feel sometime during my viewing that I was watching an extended version of Saving Private Ryan, which gets many repeat viewings from me.  But then I remembered: the movies are based on true stories, I shouldn't be complaining.  If there's a similarity, maybe because much of the creative genius in ""Ryan"" was in BOB too.War movie enthusiasts will like the second episode (""Day of Days"", the D-Day parachute drop) and the third (""Carentan"").  The ""Bastogne"" episode is more like ""Battleground (available on VHS)"", they deal with the same event, more character development than gore, more snow than fire.  You'd get the idea just how cold it was there, and how desperate the defense was.  ""Points"" was heart-rending in the end.  And of course, there's the discovery of the concentration camp, which just about snuffs out your breath.  Many Americans went to war with little understanding of what they were fighting for.  Many were wondering what they were doing in Europe, when the first blow against them was struck by the Japanese.  After the finding of the concentration camps, there was no more debate.  They were fighting because a blow has been struck against humanity.The performances were superb, and rightly toned down for the era (not too many swear words).  Damian Lewis has a screen presence that is rare today.The real heroes of the last great war were not the high-profile men who got their names on history books.

But once in awhile, television does something so inspiring, so incredible, so extraordinary, that we are left speechless. Such is Band of Brothers.Henry the Fifth continues with his monologue, 'for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.' They changed the world. Without them, Normandy was in doubt. Bastogne was in doubt. Berlin was in doubt. Europe was in doubt.

Damn right!The remarkable thing about Easy company and the 101st  . . . and the guys that flew the hump in India, and the guys that gave close air support at Guadacanal, and the guys that held the line at Bastogne, is just that. They were just guys. No Stallone. No Duke. No Chuck Norris. These guys were from Decatur and Compton and Farmingdale and Bloomington and Tulsa and Omaha and the Ypsilanti.They were car mechanics and conductors on subways and teachers and kids who lied about their age while still in high school.This is the most remarkable thing ever put on television.

711359,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B00006C7G9,Libretio,"[3, 5]","BAND OF BROTHERS (2001)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1Soundtracks: Dolby 5.1 / DTS 5.1The trials and tribulations of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, from the D-Day landings in Normandy to their capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Austria at the end of World War II.Co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, HBO's epic 10-part miniseries (based on a terrific bestselling book by the late Stephen E. Ambrose) was the most expensive TV undertaking of its day, costing a massive $120 million to produce. And, as the old saying goes, every penny is up there on the screen. Borne from the success of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - with which it shares a similar dramatic and visual style - BAND OF BROTHERS' recreation of a glorious (and hard-won) chapter in American history assumed an even greater patriotic significance during its initial US broadcast, when it coincided with the horrific attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in September 2001.Written with economy and grace, and directed with emotional intensity by a series of directors (including Phil Alden Robinson, Richard Loncraine and Hanks himself) whose combined efforts achieve a genuine aesthetic uniformity, the movie is a masterpiece of storytelling and historical documentation. Punctuated by horrific battle sequences, in which the camera is placed within mere inches of the death and destruction, the film manages to transcend its educational remit by its relentless focus on the human cost of war. Almost every episode opens with testimony from surviving members of Easy Company (none of whom are identified until the end of the series), which further strengthens the emphasis which BAND OF BROTHERS - book and film - places on the bonds which drew them together in times of conflict. And, because it's a true story, there's no telling from one episode to the next which of the 'characters' will live or die, which makes it all the more potent and visceral.The entire production represents quality writ large: Beautifully filmed on various European locations (including the UK and Austria), the movie is noble without being the least bit pompous or austere, and it manages to humanize a large cast of essential characters with small touches of humanity and humor, all of which serves to heighten the sense of terror as they descend into the maelstrom of conflict. The first - and longest - episode is deceptively staid, featuring David Schwimmer (a long way from TV's 'Friends') as the bullying, cowardly commanding officer Herbert Sobel, whose tyrannical methods nevertheless shaped Easy Company into a fighting force which eventually cut a swathe through the heart of occupied Europe. Brit actor Damian Lewis takes the spotlight thereafter as Easy Company's most respected platoon leader, Richard Winters, with Ron Livingston as his right hand man, Lewis Nixon. Other standout performances in a flawless cast include Matthew Settle as battle-hardened platoon leader Ronald Speirs whose wartime career was distinguished by numerous acts of bravery (fuelled by a unique - if morbid - personal philosophy), Shane Taylor as company medic Eugene Roe, Neal McDonough as 2nd lieutenant 'Buck' Compton (laid low by his horrific combat experiences), and Donnie Wahlberg as 1st sergeant C. Carwood Lipton, who maintained the morale of his fellow soldiers, even when the odds seemed stacked against them.Every episode has its merits, but stand-outs include David Leland's 'Bastogne' (ep. 6), which recounts the horrendous circumstances surrounding Easy Company's involvement in the Battle of the Bulge, and David Frankel's 'Why We Fight' (ep. 9), in which the full horror of the Nazi regime is uncovered in a German forest. Additionally, the closing moments of chapter 10 ('Points', directed by Mikael Salomon) are truly heartbreaking.Like the movie itself, HBO's region 1 DVD is magnificent. Housed in a beautifully embossed metal case, all ten episodes are spread across five discs (running a total of 624m 23s). Crucially, each disc contains biographical information on the soldiers represented in every episode, which allows the viewer to keep track of an extensive array of characters, and there's a useful glossary, map and timeline of Easy Company's advance across Europe. Perhaps the number of chapters per episode could have been doubled (as it stands, there are six for each instalment), but that's a minor glitch in an otherwise exemplary presentation. The sixth disc in HBO's package contains a fascinating, feature length documentary on the real members of Easy Company (essential viewing), and a series of video diaries by actor Ron Livingston of the boot camp to which many of the cast were subjected in preparation for filming, during which the actors seem to have cultivated the same bonds of friendship experienced by real soldiers in combat situations.It's doubtful that a more fitting tribute to the men of Easy Company could have been devised than BAND OF BROTHERS, a truly remarkable experience, given the Rolls Royce treatment on DVD. By turns engrossing, provocative and deeply, profoundly moving, it stands as a testament to those who fought and died for our freedoms, almost a lifetime ago.",5,Powerful testament to the human

One of my uncles died on a boat from a torpedo attack. He was 19. That generation never talked about their experiences. I finally got my father to tell me some of his part when he was about 85. I called him up on Veteran's Day, saying that I wanted to thank a vet for his sacrifice. He was so touched that he started to open up about some things . He's in Heaven now, but I'm so glad that I did that. One year I did the same thing with my brother who was in Vietnam. He was very surprised and thanked me, but he really does not want to talk about it. That's okay with me. Just a chance to tell him I love him. The one thing I absolutely loved about Band of Brothers was how the actual vets talked about themselves, their fears, their love for our great country at the beginning of each episode. Dick Winters (played by Damion somebody, who is actually British, but you would never know it), was or is a great man. I'm not sure if he is still alive(the real Dick Winters). So many good actors.

711375,A2TBMX78M7PD5T,B00006C7G9,"Malvolio ""scott15724""","[28, 30]","Band of Brothers is an HBO original series, based on the book of the same name by historian Stephen Ambrose. It is the true story of a company of American warriors in World War II - E (Easy) Company of the 506th Infantry Regiment, a component of the famed 101st Airborne Division. Band of Brothers is based in large part on the accounts of surviving members of that group. It follows the men of Easy Company from their gruelling training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, through their airborne drop into France on D-Day; their involvement in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge (where they gained great notoriety as the ""battered bastards of Bastogne""); their conquest of Hitler's Eagle's Nest; and the end of the war.If you've seen Stephen Spielberg's fictional World War II epic Saving Private Ryan, you already have some inkling of the horror and constant peril accompanying the allies' assault on Fortress Europe in 1944. Ambrose's true account of the remarkable soldiers of the 101st Airborne will leave you wondering how any of these fellows survived at all. That they not only survived but achieved victory is a tribute to their training and their hardihood, but most of all their devotion to one another. The title is based on Henry Plantagenet's battlefield oration to his outnumbered and beleaguered men on St. Crispian's Day in Shakespeare's Henry V:""He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian. He that shall live this day, and see old age, Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, and say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day....'This story shall the good man teach his son; and Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, from this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remember'd - we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother....""Band of Brothers is permeated by that same sense of comradeship through shared danger - of glory based not on conquest but on the loyalty of ordinary men one to another. Saving Private Ryan alumni Spielberg and Tom Hanks are the Executive Producers of the 11-episode HBO series, and Hanks is the Executive Director as well (in which capacity he directed one episode, co-wrote another, and closely oversaw the whole production). Spielberg's influence is evident in the look and feel of the work; but where Saving Private Ryan is austere and ultimately repelling, Band of Brothers is warmer, more accessible - more personal. One of the most successful features of the series is that each episode begins with reminiscences of one or more survivors. As the series progresses, you come to know these old guys and like them enormously. When the whole thing is over, you feel you really have seen the war through their eyes.""We sweated bullets in order to achieve authenticity,"" Hanks said in an interview with the BBC. ""There are two types of authenticity. What's relatively easy to accomplish are things like making sure the buttons on the uniforms are right, the ammunition is correct and the locations look like they looked in the photograph. The thing that's much harder is the motivation and the nature of the interplay between the characters. So we were always forcing every moment of every page of the script through this sieve of authenticity. We said, 'look, if we can't be sure what they said and did at any given moment, we must at least capture the emotional reality of being there.""Successful acting in a miniseries, especially one as long as this one, is really a different enterprise than in a two-hour production at the cineplex. Dynamism and inventiveness are less important to a performance than subtlety and sustained character development. (Do you really want to watch a dozen hours of Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth? Didn't think so.) Judged by that standard, the performances in Band of Brothers are very fine indeed. Damian Lewis, the young British actor who stars as Captain (later Major) Richard Winters, painstakingly reveals a new facet of Winters' adamantine character with each successive episode. In the role of battalion intelligence officer Lewis Nixon, Ron Livingston beautifully portrays Nixon's gradual descent into despair and alcoholism. Supporting performances of note include Donnie Wahlberg as Carwood Lipton, Frank John Hughes as Bill Guarnere, and Rick Gomez as George Luz. The miniseries' other production values - soundtrack, effects, cinematography, constumes, etc. - are likewise top notch.There are a few flaws in the series. The earlier episodes in particular sometimes drag a bit. There is also a tendency from time to time to toss in a little melodrama, some small ""moment"" that is the war movie equivalent to the rising organ notes at the end of a 60s soap opera. Generally, though, the filmmakers resist such temptations to yank on the heartstrings. That is especially appreciated in parts like episode 9, ""Why We Fight,"" in which Easy Company stumbles across a concentration camp for the first time. The encounter is handled with a degree of restraint that makes the shock and enormity of the discovery all the more affecting...",5,The Real Deal,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,5276,"['Band',

All I want to say is this series was probably THE best WWII drama I've seen to-date.  From bootcamp to the end of the war, the series takes you along with Easy Company and puts you right in the middle of the action with them as they jump into Normandy, fight through the hedgerows, take part in Operation Market-Garden, and even deal with the inactivity and boredom of post-war occupation.  Along the way, the story takes on some very potent issues, including the liberation of concentration camps.The comradery between the men of Easy company is touching.  I like how each episode keyed in on a different Easy Company member or a few different members.  I love the pre-episode interviews with the actual members of Easy.  And the post-series look into the Easy company survivors and their yearly reunions is also a treat.This series definitely does not pull any punches.  In the mold of Saving Private Ryan, Hanks does not shy away from the brutality of war.

The book and the mini-series chronicles the story of one of the most decorated and battle-hardened infantry companies of World War 2 as they participate in the European campaign. The book is brilliant as a work of historical scholarship that tells an important story, and the mini-series is brilliant because it's a fantastic work of film (TV?) that tells that same important story. Highlights are the episode directed by Tom Hanks and one of the final episodes that recounts Easy Company's first discovery of a concentration camp.

711399,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,B00006C7G9,Michael Fishman,"[1, 1]","Band of Brothers is the HBO miniseries adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name that detailed the actions of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company during World War II. The story starts during paratrooper training and takes us to D-Day and Bastogne and eventually to the end of the war. I don't know how the miniseries holds up against the book, but as a stand alone series, this is some great stuff and is about as close to ""must see"" television as possible. The drama of individual characters is sacrificed for the drama of the war itself so this is no star vehicle for any one actor and the stories of the soldiers themselves are never brought into the plot. The tension in the battle scenes is palpable and because of their realism, they're very difficult to watch.Congratulations to Stephen Spielberg, Tom Hanks and HBO. This is about as close to perfect as anything on the screen can be. Each episode starts with some brief comments by actual members of Easy Company and each episode ends with a brief written summary of what was happening in the war after the time frame of the episode. The inclusion of these two pieces helped frame each episode beautifully.Please don't turn away from Band of Brothers because you don't like war movies because this is an amazing series that goes beyond being ""just"" another war story. As the title implies, this is ultimately the story of soldiers, ordinary men in an extraordinary situation, who live through, and deal with, some horrible situations and how they cope and survive and become really more than brothers. It's also an easy-to-swallow history lesson.I'm still going to hold out on I, Claudius being the best miniseries ever made, but Band of Brothers is right up there. My only complaints with the series was that I would have liked more individual character development of the soldiers and I felt that it was assumed the viewer had at least basic knowledge of the events being covered in each episode which seemed a little unfair to some viewers. However, the Field Guide in the DVD extras and the performances of Donnie Wahlberg, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough (three actors I've never cared for before seeing them here, but who all turned in brilliant performances) were enough to counter any small complaints I may have had.Recommended for everyone with the caveat that this miniseries contains scenes of very graphic violence and intense combat action.Also recommended for anyone interested in movies about some of the events covered in the miniseries are Battleground (1949) and The Longest Day (1962) and A Bridge Too Far (1977).",5,Not just another war story,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2613,"['Band', 'Brothers', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'detailed', 'actions', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'Easy', 'Company', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'story', 'paratrooper', 'training', 'D-Day', 'Bastogne', 'eventually', 'end', 'war', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'miniseries', 'up', 'book', 'stand', 'alone', 'series', 'great', 'stuff', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'must', 'see', 'television', 'possible', 'drama', 'individual', 'characters', 'sacrificed', 'drama', 'war', 'so', 'star', 'vehicle', 'one', 'actor', 'stories', 'soldiers', 'are', 'never', 'brought', 'plot', 'tension', 'battle', 'scenes', 'palpable', 'realism', ""'re"", 'very', 'difficult', 'watch.Congratulations', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'HBO', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'anything', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'episode', 'brief', 'comments', 'actual', 'members', 'Easy', 'Company', 'episode', 'brief', 'written', 'summary', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'war', 'time', 'frame', 'episode', 'inclusion', 'two', 'pieces', 'helped', 'frame', 'episode', 'beautifully.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'war', 'movies', 'amazing', 'series', 'being', 'just', 'war', 'story', 'title', 'implies', 'ultimately', 'story', 'soldiers', 'ordinary', 'men', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'who', 'live', 'deal', 'horrible', 'situations', 'how', 'cope', 'survive', 'become', 'really', 'more', 'brothers', 'also', 'easy-to-swallow', 'history', 'lesson.I', ""'m"", 'still', 'going', 'hold', 'out', 'Claudius', 'being', 'best', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'made', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'right', 'there', 'only', 'complaints', 'series', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'individual', 'character', 'development', 'soldiers', 'felt', 'was', 'assumed', 'viewer', 'had', 'least', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'events', 'being', 'covered', 'episode', 'seemed', 'little', 'unfair', 'viewers', 'However', 'Field', 'Guide', 'DVD', 'extras', 'performances', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'three', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'cared', 'seeing', 'here', 'who', 'turned', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'were', 'enough', 'counter', 'small', 'complaints', 'may', 'have', 'had.Recommended', 'everyone', 'caveat', 'scenes', 'very', 'graphic', 'violence', 'intense', 'combat', 'action.Also', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interested', 'movies', 'events', 'covered', 'miniseries', 'are', 'Battleground', '1949', 'Longest', 'Day', '1962', 'Bridge', 'Too', 'Far', '1977']",N/A

Personally i own both versions and with my 500 dollar samsung blu ray player i only watch the bluray version, the picture is amazing. the DVD version i have not played in probably a month i might give it to a friend.Oh yeah also if you dont have a 1080 HDTV dont bother getting anything in bluray. an upconverted DVD on a 1080 is clearer then any bluray on a 720.

Expound tenfold upon such an emotion, and that's what the entire final episode is like; you've grown to enjoy the characters so intensely that simply the knowledge of this miniseries' end is heartbreaking.Now... remember that these aren't 'characters' -- they are actual people.This isn't pure fantasy -- it's a recreation of actual events.Band of Brothers is so eloquently presented, so dynamically directed and produced, that I cannot watch this without feeling displaced. Every aspect of this series is crafted painstakingly,  from the casting choices to the actors' performances to the glimpses of ""things you've always heard about"" to sets and locations which completely immerse you in the storylines; this is a must-have for anybody interested in war movies, WWII, history... or just plain ol' good drama.

Entitled ""Band of Brothers,"" that mini-series told in dramatic fashion and with exquisite eloquence the true story of one of the most famous and highly decorated U.S. Army units to fight during World War II: Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. In 2002,  ""Band of Brothers"" was released DVD; in 2008 a six-disc Blu-ray edition was published, and now it is available on Amazon Instant Video in high definition digital format.For those not familiar with ""Band of Brothers,"" it's based upon the equally outstanding book entitled ""Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest,"" by the late Stephen E. Ambrose.  It describes in stunning detail the exploits of Easy Company, from its initial airborne landing in Normandy on D-Day; through its participation in Operation Market-Garden in September 1944 and its tenacious defense of Bastogne in December 1944; to its capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden in April 1945.The original HBO mini-series is divided into ten episodes, each about one hour long. The entire project - which cost an estimated $125 million to produce - has as its executive producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Stephen Ambrose.With such cinematic luminaries leading the production team, one would expect ""Band of Brothers"" to be outstanding in every respect, and it does not disappoint. Taken as a whole, the ten episodes provide a highly accurate and faithful chronology of the events narrated by Ambrose in his book, while at the same time providing viewers with superb acting, writing, cinematography, music, costumes, and sound. Taken separately, each episode stands as a powerful and gritty testament to the patriotism, heroism, and character of the men of Easy Company.It's impossible to describe with full justice how good ""Band of Brothers"" is. It is, for me, the nearly perfect war chronicle: an accurate depiction of real events; arrayed with a stellar cast, including many unknown actors who have made a name for themselves as a result of their work in this film (among them, most notably: Damian Lewis; Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston; Dale Dye (who also served as the series' military advisor); Frank John Hughes; and Rick Gomez.I now own the complete ""Band of Brothers"" miniseries in three formats: DVD (purchased 2003); Blu-Ray (2011); and now in digital format through my Amazon Prime membership. I think the digital format provides the clearest, sharpest, and most vibrant audio and video of the three formats I own. I have already watched several episodes on my Kindle Fire HD, and I can say without hesitation that the experience was superb in every way. It certainly made the purchase of this series well worth the price. (Of course, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can view ""Band of Brothers"" for free.)MY VERDICT:  No matter what format you own, ""Band of Brothers"" is truly outstanding.  Along with its sister miniseries ""The Pacific"" (2010), it is simply the best war story I've ever seen in any cinematic medium. Both ""Band of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"" deserve honored places in any home video collection.",5,"""Band of Brothers"" (HBO Miniseries) Truly outstanding in every respect.",1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,3396,"['September', '2001', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Pentagon', 'began', 'Home', 'Box', 'Office', 'HBO', 'cable', 'network', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'television', 'mini-series', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Entitled', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'mini-series', 'told', 'dramatic', 'fashion', 'exquisite', 'eloquence', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'highly', 'decorated', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'units', 'fight', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Easy', 'Company', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', '2002', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', '2008', 'six-disc', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'was', 'published', 'now', 'available', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'high', 'definition', 'digital', 'format.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'based', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'book', 'entitled', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'E', 'Company', '506th', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Normandy', 'Hitler', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'late', 'Stephen', 'E.', 'Ambrose', 'stunning', 'detail', 'exploits', 'Easy', 'Company', 'initial', 'airborne', 'landing', 'Normandy', 'D-Day', 'participation', 'Operation', 'Market-Garden', 'September', '1944', 'tenacious', 'defense', 'Bastogne', 'December', '1944', 'capture', 'Hitler', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'Berchtesgaden', 'April', '1945.The', 'original', 'HBO', 'mini-series', 'divided', 'ten', 'episodes', 'one', 'hour', 'long', 'entire', 'project', 'cost', 'estimated', '125', 'million', 'produce', 'executive', 'producers', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose.With', 'such', 'cinematic', 'luminaries', 'leading', 'production', 'team', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'be', 'outstanding', 'respect', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Taken', 'whole', 'ten', 'provide', 'highly', 'accurate', 'faithful', 'chronology', 'events', 'narrated', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'same', 'time', 'providing', 'viewers', 'superb', 'acting', 'writing', 'cinematography', 'music', 'costumes', 'sound', 'Taken', 'separately', 'episode', 'powerful', 'gritty', 'testament', 'patriotism', 'heroism', 'character', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company.It', 'impossible', 'describe', 'full', 'justice', 'how', 'good', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'war', 'chronicle', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'real', 'events', 'arrayed', 'stellar', 'cast', 'including', 'many', 'unknown', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'name', 'result', 'work', 'film', 'most', 'notably', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'series', 'military', 'advisor', 'Frank', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Rick', 'Gomez.I', 'now', 'own', 'complete', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'miniseries', 'three', 'formats', 'DVD', 'purchased', '2003', 'Blu-Ray', '2011', 'now', 'digital', 'format', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'membership', 'think', 'digital', 'format', 'clearest', 'sharpest', 'most', 'vibrant', 'audio', 'video', 'three', 'formats', 'own', 'have', 'already', 'watched', 'several', 'episodes', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'HD', 'can', 'say', 'hesitation', 'experience', 'was', 'superb', 'way', 'certainly', 'made', 'purchase', 'series', 'well', 'price', 'course', ""'re"", 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'member', 'can', 'view', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'free', 'VERDICT', 'matter', 'what', 'own', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'sister', 'miniseries', 'Pacific', '2010', 'simply', 'best', 'war', 'story', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Pacific', 'deserve', 'honored', 'places', 'home', 'video', 'collection']",N/A

This company saw action in all these engagements and more.The book is very accurate and straight forward. Ambrose interviewed the living members of the company to get the details for the book and Stephen  Spielberg and Tom Hanks do their magic in converting the great book to create a brilliant mini series. All of the events depicted in the film are taken from the book almost word for word. It is the most historically truthful war film made about WWII that I have ever seen. The creators went to great pains and expense to get all details as close to reality as possible from the uniforms, weapons and equipment to the actual battles the company was engaged in, one after another.This is a must see for anyone who wants to see the true experiences of what the real war was like for an American GI. Awesome endeavor to undertake and is well executed. Many thanks to Spielberg and Hanks to pay tribute to the brave men who served in this magnificent company. And most of all, thanks to the men of Company E who undertook this service to our Country. The original company was made up of only volunteers.",5,How it really was - The American Army in WWII in the European Theater,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,1423,"['Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'Writer', 'Historian', 'decided', 'write', 'book', 'E', 'Company', '506', 'PIR', 'was', 'considered', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'companies', 'serve', 'Europe', 'D-Day', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'incredible', 'stand', 'Bastogne', 'invasion', 'Germany', 'finally', 'first', 'allied', 'unit', 'arrive', 'Hitler', 'Eagles', 'Nest', 'company', 'saw', 'action', 'engagements', 'more.The', 'book', 'very', 'accurate', 'straight', 'forward', 'Ambrose', 'interviewed', 'living', 'members', 'company', 'get', 'details', 'book', 'Stephen', 'Spielberg', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'do', 'magic', 'converting', 'great', 'book', 'create', 'brilliant', 'mini', 'series', 'events', 'depicted', 'film', 'are', 'taken', 'book', 'almost', 'word', 'word', 'most', 'historically', 'truthful', 'war', 'film', 'made', 'WWII', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'creators', 'went', 'great', 'pains', 'expense', 'get', 'details', 'close', 'reality', 'possible', 'uniforms', 'weapons', 'equipment', 'actual', 'company', 'was', 'engaged', 'one', 'another.This', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'true', 'experiences', 'what', 'real', 'war', 'was', 'American', 'GI', 'Awesome', 'endeavor', 'undertake', 'well', 'executed', 'Many', 'thanks', 'Spielberg', 'Hanks', 'pay', 'tribute', 'brave', 'men', 'who', 'served', 'magnificent', 'company', 'most', 'thanks', 'men', 'Company', 'E', 'who', 'undertook', 'service', 'Country', 'original', 'company', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'volunteers']",N/A

In addition the DTS-HD Master audio track is excellent and brings out every sound imaginable.  Now to the series itself.  It is, in my opinion, the best mini-series ever produced for television.  Everything from the production to the acting and the writing is top notch.  I have seen Band of Brothers a minimum of 10 times and it never gets old.  It shows the sacrifices that those men made for their country and the world in a real way.  It can be exciting and moving at the same time.  From the first episode, 'Currahee', to the last 'Points', it is a captivating view.  Everyone will be moved by every episode.  In particular, the episode 'Why We Fight' shows not only the horror of the Nazis, but the compassion of our American soldiers.  The 2 episodes regarding the Battle of the Bulge would be one of the best WWII movies ever had these simply been release in that format.  Throughout the series, we see the best of the men who save the world.  We also see the faults and humanity of these same men.  This series should be required viewing in all high schools so every person can see what these men did to, in my opinion, save the world.  There are many standout performances throughout the series.  Ron Livingston (Nixon) and Damian Lewis (Winters) gave outstanding, though controlled performances.  Donnie Wahlberg's portrayal of Sgt. Lipton stands out among an excellent supporting cast.  Do yourself a favor and watch all the extras.  These give you a unique insight into the actual men on which the series is based.  This set is worth every penny and is my absolute favorite of every DVD/Blu-ray that I own.

Following Easy Company of the US Airborne through traing, D-Day parachute landings and onto Germany, the series is a wonderfully made depiction of the events of war as the men of Easy experienced it.The series combines the filmed parts with initial interview footage of surviving members making comments related to themes in that particular part. One part, with Albert Blythe, a scared soldier, is preceded by the interview footage discussing fear and dealing with it. These excerpts leant a great deal to the overall message of the films. Each part has an overall theme that is dealt with, such as replacements and so on.The execution and making of the parts was excellent throughout. The combat scenes are filmed with cameras bobbing about, as if the cameraman is running right behind the soldiers in combat. The choice makes these scenes all the more realistic.This is not a glossed over war movie, and the scenes are graphic and what the men did may not always inspire sympathy. However flawed the men were, the depiction is honest and real, and one still admires them their bravery, humour and loyalty to each other in adversity. A particularly moving part is when ""Bull"" Randall's men go back to a German occuppied village to find him after Easy had retreated from it. Luckily, he had already been found after the Germans had left.The special features are extensive, and add even more information to the making of the series and the men who inspired it.Overall, this is without doubt an excellent series on the invasions of Europe by the Allies during World War Two.

Veiluva ""sputnik99""","[7, 7]","""Band of Brothers"" is the most in-depth attempt by a film to depict the experience of a infantry rifleman in sustained modern combat.  It faithfully follows Stephen Ambroses' wonderful book of the same title, tracing a company of paratroopers from the training camp at Toccoa to the end of the war at Hitler's mountain retreat in the Bavarian Alps.  It benefits from an impeccable cast, modern post-Private Ryan battle effects, and incredible attention to detail.  This is a grognard's must-have.  And, like its soulmate ""Private Ryan"", due to its realism it renders most earlier and less-sophisticated WW2 films nearly unwatchable.Company E (Easy), 506th Airborne Regiment participated in the three pivotal battles of the Western European Campaign in World War II: D-Day, Market Garden (the failed attempt to seize the Rhine River crossing in Holland), and at the siege of Bastogne during Hitler's December 1944 Ardennes Offensive.  Because of their status as elite troops, the paratroopers were cold-bloodedly employed longer in battle, and against greater odds, than most equivalent units.  A point made repeatedly in the film is the enormous turnover caused by casualties, as more and more of the long-term characters we become comfortable with are wounded, killed, or incapacitated by combat stress.  Yet these troops were consistently thrown into the breach because of their reliability and lethal commitment to survive.The most valuable aspect of the film, which is not peopled by big-name actors, is in portraying the plight of line infantrymen.  The American method of waging war whether in World War II, Korea and especially Vietnam, imposed the burden of ground combat on a minority of units and individual soldiers at any given time.  What happens to these soldiers is the stuff of Band of Brothers - and if this is the fate of elite troops, one can only imagine how more standard units filled with a mix of draftees and enlisted men fared.  Ambroses's book and the movie follow the progression from the gung-ho D-Day battles to the first setback at Einhoven, and the frozen, starved soldiers torn apart by German artillery at Bastogne.  Ultimately, some of these soldiers crack, and company commanders finally refuse to take risks pre-empting higher authority.The book and film are both a ""Greatest Generation"" tribute and a lesson, in a way, a powerful anti-war statement of their own.  Ambrose's moral is that every soldier, no matter how well trained or elite, has a ""breaking point"" beyond which he or she should not be expected to endure.  The realties of modern war are such that unless the combat experience is in the context of a ""splendid little war"" such as Panama or the 1991 Gulf War, human beings were not meant to be exposed to a constant lethal environment for months on end.  Seemingly this lesson has to be re-learned in every sustained war, including the one we are now in.Must Read:  Stepehn Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers"" and related titles.  Other great related films:  ""Private Ryan"" (of course), the German films ""Das Boot"" and ""Stalingrad"", and (a possible surprise here) ""Memphis Belle.""",5,Lessons of War in Finest Mini-Series Ever,1109203200,"02 24, 2005",2005,3123,"['Band', 'Brothers', 'most', 'in-depth', 'attempt', 'film', 'depict', 'experience', 'infantry', 'rifleman', 'sustained', 'modern', 'combat', 'faithfully', 'Stephen', 'Ambroses', 'wonderful', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'tracing', 'company', 'paratroopers', 'training', 'camp', 'Toccoa', 'end', 'war', 'Hitler', 'mountain', 'retreat', 'Bavarian', 'Alps', 'benefits', 'impeccable', 'cast', 'modern', 'post-Private', 'Ryan', 'battle', 'effects', 'incredible', 'attention', 'detail', 'grognard', 'must-have', 'soulmate', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'due', 'realism', 'most', 'earlier', 'less-sophisticated', 'WW2', 'films', 'nearly', 'unwatchable.Company', 'E', 'Easy', '506th', 'Airborne', 'Regiment', 'participated', 'three', 'pivotal', 'battles', 'Western', 'European', 'Campaign', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'D-Day', 'Market', 'Garden', 'failed', 'attempt', 'seize', 'Rhine', 'River', 'crossing', 'Holland', 'siege', 'Bastogne', 'Hitler', 'December', '1944', 'Ardennes', 'Offensive', 'status', 'elite', 'troops', 'paratroopers', 'were', 'cold-bloodedly', 'employed', 'longer', 'battle', 'greater', 'odds', 'most', 'equivalent', 'units', 'point', 'made', 'repeatedly', 'film', 'enormous', 'turnover', 'caused', 'casualties', 'more', 'more', 'long-term', 'characters', 'become', 'comfortable', 'are', 'wounded', 'killed', 'incapacitated', 'combat', 'stress', 'troops', 'were', 'consistently', 'thrown', 'breach', 'reliability', 'lethal', 'commitment', 'survive.The', 'most', 'valuable', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'peopled', 'big-name', 'actors', 'portraying', 'plight', 'line', 'infantrymen', 'American', 'method', 'waging', 'war', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Korea', 'especially', 'Vietnam', 'imposed', 'burden', 'ground', 'combat', 'minority', 'units', 'individual', 'soldiers', 'given', 'time', 'What', 'soldiers', 'stuff', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'fate', 'elite', 'troops', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'more', 'standard', 'units', 'filled', 'mix', 'draftees', 'enlisted', 'men', 'fared', 'Ambroses', 'book', 'movie', 'follow', 'progression', 'gung-ho', 'D-Day', 'battles', 'first', 'setback', 'Einhoven', 'frozen', 'starved', 'soldiers', 'torn', 'apart', 'German', 'artillery', 'Bastogne', 'Ultimately', 'soldiers', 'crack', 'company', 'commanders', 'finally', 'refuse', 'take', 'risks', 'pre-empting', 'higher', 'authority.The', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'Greatest', 'Generation', 'tribute', 'lesson', 'way', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'statement', 'own', 'Ambrose', 'moral', 'soldier', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'trained', 'elite', 'breaking', 'point', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'endure', 'realties', 'modern', 'war', 'are', 'such', 'combat', 'experience', 'context', 'splendid', 'little', 'war', 'such', 'Panama', '1991', 'Gulf', 'War', 'human', 'beings', 'were', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'exposed', 'constant', 'lethal', 'environment', 'months', 'end', 'Seemingly', 'lesson', 'be', 're-learned', 'sustained', 'war', 'including', 'one', 'are', 'now', 'in.Must', 'Read', 'Stepehn', 'Ambrose', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'related', 'titles', 'Other', 'great', 'related', 'films', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'course', 'German', 'films', 'Das', 'Boot', 'Stalingrad', 'possible', 'surprise', 'here', 'Memphis', 'Belle']",N/A

But, unlike &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot; does not resort to mock-heroics or false philosophizing. Unfortunately, &quot;Battleground&quot; is available only on VHS.While I don't deny that both &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; are important movies from a historical perspective and that these stories are well worth telling today, I have problems with both movies depicting GIs with too modern a body language for the era, using inappropriate dialogue and idioms, and having too much &quot;attitude&quot;.In all the three episodes of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; that I watched, the acting was mostly mediocre, with the actors swaggering and giving the impression of &quot;look at me, I am a cool WWII GI&quot;. The GIs look a tad too smart for front line, the uniforms look too clean (with brushed cotton texture) and the haircuts look too perfect. The compter-generated effects are all too evident. The tracer bullets look too video-game like. In the &quot;Bastogne&quot; episode, the parachute supplies falling on Bastogne almost look cartoonish.I had a laugh with some reviewers saying &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is the best war movie, ever, period, etc., etc. To them I say get hold of copies of movie greats like &quot;The Story of GI Joe&quot;, &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, &quot;The Desert Rats&quot;, &quot;The Bridges of Toko-Ri&quot;, &quot;Battleground&quot;, or &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot;.

This is the best miniseries that was made for World War 2.  I have had see many World War 2 films but nothing that tops this.  You have not only that fact is about a company of men but it is about the famous Easy Company of the 506th and 101st airborne division.In the first episode called Currahee they have a commander named Sobel and this man is about the first man they meet in a series of commands and they meet this man Sobel.  In the next couple of episodes they start the drops on Normandy during D-Day and that episode is called the Day of Days.  Then you have a very cool episode called Carantan it is the raid on Market Garden that is episode 3 then 3 episodes later they have the infamous Battle of the Bulge.  That takes up 2 episodes of the miniseries episodes 6 and 7.  After episode 8 they get ready to come off the line and they go ahead into the forest and spot what is one of the German POW camps where they spot some stuff they do not want to see.  They find prisoners of war there and they find that they are getting killed in gas chambers and they are not being fed very well because they are all skin and bones.  After that they meet up in the final episode and raid one of Hitler's famous homes called the Eagle's Nest and finish raiding it and after that they set fire to the home and they win the war.All in all this miniseries made by HBO will get your heart going it is a very sad movie and that will make you feel bad for the men in Easy Company.,5,Great Miniseries on WWII,1050019200,"04 11, 2003",2003,1573,"['think', 'miniseries', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'powerful', 'sense', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'best', 'miniseries', 'was', 'made', 'World', 'War', '2', 'have', 'had', 'see', 'many', 'World', 'War', '2', 'films', 'nothing', 'have', 'not', 'only', 'fact', 'company', 'men', 'famous', 'Easy', 'Company', '506th', '101st', 'airborne', 'division.In', 'first', 'episode', 'called', 'Currahee', 'have', 'commander', 'named', 'Sobel', 'man', 'first', 'man', 'meet', 'series', 'commands', 'meet', 'man', 'Sobel', 'next', 'couple', 'episodes', 'start', 'drops', 'Normandy', 'D-Day', 'episode', 'called', 'Day', 'Days', 'Then', 'have', 'very', 'cool', 'episode', 'called', 'Carantan', 'raid', 'Market', 'Garden', 'episode', '3', 'then', '3', 'episodes', 'later', 'have', 'infamous', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'up', '2', 'episodes', 'miniseries', '6', '7', '8', 'get', 'ready', 'come', 'off', 'line', 'go', 'ahead', 'forest', 'spot', 'what', 'one', 'German', 'POW', 'camps', 'where', 'spot', 'stuff', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'find', 'prisoners', 'war', 'find', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'gas', 'chambers', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'fed', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'skin', 'bones', 'meet', 'up', 'final', 'episode', 'raid', 'one', 'Hitler', 'famous', 'homes', 'called', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'finish', 'raiding', 'set', 'fire', 'home', 'win', 'war.All', 'miniseries', 'made', 'HBO', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'going', 'very', 'sad', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company']",N/A

Gough,"[0, 0]","This story is one of the best ever told about the ETO and how men were able to fight and deal with themselves, each other and the horrors of war. I cannot express my feelings in the proper light with just words, as to how much this story means to me. While my father served in this (hopefully) last great war in England with the 8th AF in Rattlesden as a munitions soldier for B-17s, I never served in my time. That war in Vietnam was not one which needed to be fought. No war is. However, if any war was ever needed to quell the insatiable thirst of horror by those who wish to rule the world at any cost, WWII was that war. I won't go into how it could have been prevented by more peaceful actions after WWI.I have seen this series twice now within the past year and will never forget.Tom Hanks, Steven Speilberg, every actor, producer and director and writer, such as Erik Bork, as well as each and every sound engineer, crew member,  and technician are to all be saluted by the audience for their amazing work in telling this story of Easy Company. Without them, this story would have never been properly told to the masses. Awards mean less than being able to tell the story with care, love, honor and respect. This is their achievement and one which few people ever get to experience.Sadly, only a few Easy Company brothers are left in this world. However, this series and the original book by Stephen E. Ambrose, will serve as their story to be told as long as people read and can view films. May we never, ever see such horror again in our world. It is up to each of us to remember these stories and to never forget the sacrifice of millions of men, women and children who suffered and died during the war. Our honor to them should be to instill peace in our world, to do whatever it takes to not enter into military battles. It is up to us and everyone who comes behind us, to never forget men like those in Easy Company, those who sacrificed with their lives to wrest peace from the clutches of a madman who wished to dominate the world.Rest easy, Easy Company...

711453,A85K51H02XWZU,B00006C7G9,Nicholas J. Bertollo,"[13, 14]","Several years go, I saw the first few episodes of this when it first hit HBO.  Though I loved it, I took up a night job and couldn't see the last 7 episodes on TV when they first aired.  Fast forward to the spring of 2004.  I was in college then and my friends decided that instead of pissing our nights away playing videogames and watching anime (ugh, the horror!  What an utter fool I used to be!), we'd watch Band of Brothers, one episode a night for a week.  Having only seen a few episodes I was enthusiastic to finish the series.  The plan to watch one episode a night tanked right away, we ended up watching two a night.  We only refrained from watching three or four because honestly, what hardworking college student has four hours to put aside for watching TV on a Wednesday night?There were differences right away between what I'd seen on TV a few years ago and what I was watching now.  At least, I thought it was different - I remembered seeing something ""good"", but what I watched that spring was simply incredible.  I had no concept of what I had been watching when I saw the first episodes during high school.  This series is moving, highly emotional, and quite honestly, the best thing I have ever seen on a screen.  I will say again for clarity - it is my humble opinion that this is the best thing ever put to film.  People write this off as ""GI Joe"" action and mindless Nazi-killing.  I really wonder if they saw the same series I did.  If reviewers say that this is only about the action, they've missed the point.  The heart of this series is really the men and how they react to combat.  I was deeply moved by the characters (especially Dick Winters and Lewis Nixon, played by Damian Lewis and Ron Livingston, respectively), got a sense of the horrors of war (particularly the Normandy jump and the hellish artillery barrage outside Foy), and was brought to the brink of tears multiple times - Bastogne and the aforementioned Foy among others.  I am not a man that cries easily, either.  My girlfriend (what a gal!) got me the boxed set for Christmas, and after watching the series a second and third time through I can honestly say that if anything, I was more profoundly affected on successive viewings.As a side note, a friend and I saw Dick Winters speak a couple of weeks after I finished watching Band of Brothers in spring 2004 - anybody who says the characters are unbelievable or unrealistic is absolutely and irrevocably wrong.  Winters, the man, was EXACTLY the same as Winters, the character.  Standing outside that high school auditorium I'd driven out to (it was filled past capacity), I felt I'd already seen him before -  ten hours' worth!.  Damian Lewis did one hell of a job portraying his character.  Watch the special features (""We Stand Alone Together"" particularly) and it's obvious that the rest of the characters are more or less dead-on as well.  It's easy to say guys like Bull Randleman and John Martin were cliche or stereotypical, but I suspect that what we see on-screen is closer to reality than we can know.  Watching Babe Heffron being interviewed on the special features disc is a good example - in the series, Heffron is a smart-alecky kid from Philadelphia.  In interviews, he comes across as an old, smart-alecky guy from Philadelphia.  Ditto on Bill Guarnere.

It helped with Stephen Ambrose helming this before he died in 2001, and with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg helping produce.  However, the applause goes to the young actors who played the officers and enlisted men.  Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, Dale Dye, Kirk Acevedo, Michael Cudlitz, Donnie Wahlberg, Mark Gomez, and even Tom Hanks' son, Colin Hanks.  The film was brutally real, no bleeps or family friendly fair, just honest portrayals of the greatest generation of soldiers, ever.  The 506 Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Comany, is an ecclectic group from everywhere in the US.  The film keeps you interesting in every wise-cracking mechanic, businessman, farmer, and cab driver who lived and fought and even died for their country.  Every character existed and really trodded this earth.  Easy Company's reaction to the Nazi concentration camps was heartbreaking and equally on par with parts of Schindler's List, and even old movies like The Big Red One with Lee Marvin.  Shocking, and a horrible wake up call to farm boys and city dwellers sheltered from mass murder and Hitler until Pearl Harbor.  No soldier expected those horrors, let alone the Battle of the Bulge and D-Day.  Band of Brothers is not just a must for a historian or military freak, but a staple for most Americans seeking inspiration and recollections of patriotism which is sorely lacking.  This was released after September 11, on HBO and was well timed.  Tom, Steven, Mr. Ambrose, and the others, you did a magnificent job.

711459,A33TBHM3O9AY17,B00006C7G9,No one of consequence,"[3, 5]","Because that's exactly where it lands every time I watch any one of these incredibly well done episodes.  There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to do justice to the unparalleled quality of this production.  Contrary to the misguided opinion of the ""viewer from San Diego"" (see below), this is not about glorifying war or depicting the average German soldier as an awful person.  Rather, it's about giving the viewer a rare insight into war in all its horror, confusion and human-ness (is that a word?).  No doubt the Germans had their own ""bands of brothers"" -- just read Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier"" for a fine illustration of that.  However, this series doesn't take sides.  It shows both Americans and Germans alike as scared, tired, hungry, cold and confused.  The portrayal of the human and psychological toll of this conflict is not unbalanced, although admittedly the viewer only gets to ""personally"" know the characters on the American side.Even while the grim realities of war are highlighted, there is also an acute attention to historical detail and accuracy, right down to some of the minutiae described by the real survivors in Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name.  The series also presents an object lesson in courage, sacrifice and loyalty that is not to be overlooked.  Yes, war is an awful thing, but it also has the ability to bring out hitherto unknown greatness, albeit often subtle, in those who find themselves thrust into the middle of the conflict.  HBO and Spielberg do a wonderful job of striking just the right balance.The central character, the ""hero"" if you prefer, is Lt. (later Capt. and then Major) Richard ""Dick"" Winters, who is introduced early in Episode 1 as a platoon leader in Easy Company, and later the company commander after his predecessor turns up missing on the D-Day drop.  Winters proves himself an exceptional combat commander and later a highly competent battalion staff officer.  At every stage of his development, his exemplary leadership is underscored by a simple, down-to-earth (humble?) attitude and a deep concern for every soldier under his command.  This is well illustrated in Episode 5 when Winters personally leads his outnumbered men in a charge that catches two full companies of SS infantry by surprise.  The attack decimates the German units while only one of Winters' own men is killed and 22 wounded, yet even still he counts the cost and personally mourns the loss.In addition to the great development of the Dick Winters character (who was, of course, a real person), there is plenty of similar attention given to many others, such as Sgt. Guarnere and Capt. Nixon.  One of the other features that makes this such a great series is the phenomenally skillful camera work.  The positioning of the cameras, the jolt from a nearby artillery rounds, the jostling of men in the trenches, and the constant buzz and smack of bullets, all combine to put the viewer in the middle of the action with the men on the screen.  Frankly I think the ability to capture the ""atmosphere"" of combat rises to an even higher level than was demonstrated in ""Saving Private Ryan"", which set a new standard for modern war films.What more can I say?  Watch these for yourself.  You won't be disappointed -- not even a little bit.  There's no political agenda here.  What you'll see will (or should) give you pause to consider the nature and effects of war, but beyond that it's simply a great story about great men doing their best in an uncertain time.

Germany was on the wane but still had plenty of fighting left in it especially in Belgium during the Winter of 1944 in the Ardennes.  The story follows the lives of soldiers/friends assigned to EZ Company of the 101st Airborne who were dropped off behind enemy lines in Normandy as avant-garde contingents; they continued to serve in France, Belgium, Holland, Austria, and Germany until the end of the war in Europe.  Each DVD also contains an interview with the actual veterans whose lives are represented in the series where they recall and describe (sometimes with great emotion and difficulty) the experiences they felt and the bonds of friendship they formed in those harrowing years.As for the production values of the film, they are simply outstanding and equal, if not superior, to Spielberg's own 'Saving Private Ryan.'  This 10-hour miniseries is much deeper in character study and plot than any film could be and is therefore a superior production in that respect.  Although the series has one central character it tends to focus on, each episode in the film represents the perspective/narrative of one particular character in the platoon/company/batallion and their perspective on the events.  The acting is simply outstanding on the part of every actor in the series.  The special effects are as good if not better than 'Saving Private Ryan.'  In addition, the production is as faithful as possible to every detail of that period from speech/mannerisms, dress, uniforms, armaments, etc.This is without a doubt the best miniseries ever made and one of the top 5 war films to be produced.  Steven Spielberg has outdone himself in terms of producing this simply outstanding work of art.  This is a great film not only in terms of entertainment but also in terms of educating our youth as to the great courage and sacrifice demonstrated by these valliant soldiers and what their lives and times were like.  The most moving for me was to watch and hear the interviews of those men depicted in the series; when I see them cry and contemplate in silence as they remember those fateful years, I can only feel humble and respect the fact that they have experienced horrors and/or such selfless acts of heroism that are simply too painful for them to recite even today.  This miniseries is truly nothing less than a great mark in the achievement of film and historical reenactment/preservation: I most strongly recommend its purchase.",5,The Best Miniseries/War Film Ever Made,1114992000,"05 2, 2005",2005,2824,"['Spielberg/Hanks', 'produced', 'HBO', 'miniseries', 'undoubtedly', 'best', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'produced', 'compared', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'one', '5', 'best', 'war', 'films', 'time.In', 'mini-series', 'audience', 'immersed', 'best', 'cinematic', 'representation', 'what', 'WWII', 'was', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'last', 'stretch', 'WWII', 'Europe', 'Normandy', 'Berlin', '6/44-5/45', 'Germany', 'was', 'wane', 'still', 'had', 'plenty', 'fighting', 'left', 'especially', 'Belgium', 'Winter', '1944', 'Ardennes', 'story', 'lives', 'soldiers/friends', 'assigned', 'EZ', 'Company', '101st', 'Airborne', 'who', 'were', 'dropped', 'off', 'enemy', 'lines', 'Normandy', 'avant-garde', 'contingents', 'continued', 'serve', 'France', 'Belgium', 'Holland', 'Austria', 'Germany', 'end', 'war', 'Europe', 'DVD', 'also', 'interview', 'actual', 'veterans', 'lives', 'are', 'represented', 'series', 'where', 'recall', 'describe', 'sometimes', 'great', 'emotion', 'difficulty', 'experiences', 'felt', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'formed', 'harrowing', 'years.As', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'equal', 'not', 'superior', 'Spielberg', 'own', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan', '10-hour', 'miniseries', 'much', 'deeper', 'character', 'study', 'plot', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'therefore', 'superior', 'production', 'respect', 'series', 'one', 'central', 'character', 'focus', 'episode', 'film', 'perspective/narrative', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'platoon/company/batallion', 'perspective', 'events', 'acting', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'part', 'actor', 'series', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', ""'Saving"", 'Private', 'Ryan', 'addition', 'production', 'as', 'faithful', 'possible', 'detail', 'period', 'speech/mannerisms', 'dress', 'uniforms', 'armaments', 'etc.This', 'doubt', 'best', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'top', '5', 'war', 'films', 'be', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'outdone', 'terms', 'producing', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'work', 'art', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'entertainment', 'also', 'terms', 'educating', 'youth', 'great', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'demonstrated', 'valliant', 'soldiers', 'what', 'lives', 'times', 'were', 'like', 'most', 'moving', 'was', 'watch', 'hear', 'interviews', 'men', 'depicted', 'series', 'when', 'see', 'cry', 'contemplate', 'silence', 'remember', 'fateful', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'humble', 'respect', 'fact', 'have', 'experienced', 'horrors', 'and/or', 'such', 'selfless', 'acts', 'heroism', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'painful', 'recite', 'even', 'today', 'miniseries', 'truly', 'nothing', 'less', 'great', 'mark', 'achievement', 'film', 'historical', 'reenactment/preservation', 'most', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'purchase']",N/A

711471,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00006C7G9,Patrick L. Randall,"[6, 7]","There are few greater achievements that have made their way to the small screen than the HBO mini-series ""Band of Brothers"".  This 10-part epic is based on the book of the same name by noted historian Stephen E. Ambrose, which tells the story of the men of Easy Company, and elite World War II unit of paratroopers from the beginning of their training in 1942 through all their epic battles until the surrender of Germany in 1945.  Ambrose's book is one of the best military histories I have ever read.  With the ""Band of Brothers"" mini-series, the story of Easy Company is realized visually in a way that few war dramas or books have ever been.  The 10-part, 12-hour length necessitated its development as a television mini-series, yet ""Band of Brothers"" far surpasses anything I have seen committed to the big screen.  Each episode tells a different story from a different point of view along Easy Company's journey from training until the end of the war.  Lieutenant (later Major) Richard Winters is the focal point of this series.  It was Winters whose contributions and assistance helped Ambrose write the book in the first place, and he is the one who is conscience of the Company.  Each episode brings a fresh perspective to the stories told and are briefly summarized:Episode 1 - Curahee:  This first episode focuses on the earliest days of Easy Company under the training of the vicious and petty Captain Sobel.  Sobel's actions make Easy the finest company in the Regiment, but also prove him to be a petty leader and an inept battlefield commander.  This episode shows how Easy originally came into being and how they developed in the unit that would become Hitler's worst nightmare.  It ends with the spectacular image of the C-47s flying over the English Channel on the way to the start of the invasion with the massive Allied flight sailing below.  Few images are as awe-inspiring.Episode 2 - Day of Days:  The second episode begins with the paratrooper drops behind German lines the night before D-Day and focuses on the assault let by Lieutenant Winters on fortified German guns on D-Day.  Winters is thrust into command of Easy Company when the previous commander dies aboard his C-47 during the assault.  The images of the nighttime airdrop are truly nerve-wracking and breathtaking.  It should be noted that Lt. Winters' assault on the German fortified guns is still textbook material at West Point today.Episode 3 - Carentan:  Having successfully invaded France, the Allies (Easy Company specifically) are charged with capturing the town of Carentan, followed by a cross field battle with German armor.  Much of this episode is told from the perspective of Private Albert Blythe, a soldier who is dazed by battle and must face his fears to become a good soldier.  Lieutenant Spiers offers sage advice to Blythe by telling him ""You have to realize that you're already dead.  Then, you can do what need to do"".Episode 4 - Replacements:  Many of the men who initially died are now being replaced by new soldiers.  As they are not original Taccoa men, the replacements are not met with an enthusiastic welcome.  This is all put aside as the disastrous Operation Market Garden is launched.  The focus of this episode becomes Sergeant ""Bull"" Randlemen who takes care to watch out for his men and then must carefully maneuver himself to avoid capture by the Germans when he trapped behind enemy lines.Episode 5 - Crossroads:  Focuses on a surprise attack on two German companies in the crossroads dike.  This stunning and resounding victory is Captain Winters last as Easy Company commander.  He is promoted to Battalion Executive Officer.  The story shifts to Winters reflecting on the war so far during his `forced' 48-hour leave in Paris before returning the Easy Company men to battle when the Germans break through and start the Battle of the Bulge.Episode 6 - Bastogne:  Deals with the terror of repeated German shellings and assaults upon Easy Company's entrenched line.  Doc Eugene Roe becomes the focal point as he tries to patch together wounded and preserve his own sanity.  There are some gruesome wounds depicted in this episode.Episode 7 - Breaking Point:  The men of Easy are at their last threads as the constant mortar attacks continue to wounds some soldiers and claim the lives of others.  First Sergeant Carwood Lipton keeps Easy together in spite of the inept leadership of Lieutenant Dike.  In the subsequent attack on the town of Foy, Lieutenant Spiers relieves Dike when Dike freezes and leads Easy to a successful assault.Episode 8 - The Last Patrol:  Private Webster has rejoined Easy in Hagenau but is not well-received after having missed Bastogne.  The men of Easy begin to realize that they may actually make it out of the war alive and are disheartened by dangerous assignments like a patrol to capture German prisoners for intelligence.Episode 9 - Why We Fight:  Captain Nixon deals with the consequences of his alcoholism while the Allied forces accept the surrender of 300,000 German soldiers.  During a patrol in the Alps, Easy Company stumbles upon a horrible sight, a Nazi concentration camp.  The images of the surrendering Germans are impressive.  The images of the concentration camp are horrifying and saddening.Episode 10 - Points:  The war in Europe is over and Easy Company captures Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden and acquire the riches that lay within.  While awaiting orders to head to the Pacific war, Easy must deal with the perils of idle time in which men are still dying or are being hurt.  The story of Easy Company ends with the telling of the lives the men lived after the war ended.There is no shortage of superlatives that can be heaped upon ""Band of Brothers"".  This DVD is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the bravery of the men of Easy Company.",5,Words can't do justice to this saga,1062547200,"09 3, 2003",2003,5836,"['are', 'few', 'greater',

This best captures the ethos of this work. And it is an excellent experience and vivid history.This epic runs from July 1942 to shortly after the end of the war in Europe. Starting with the company''s initial bonding experience, under the hot, miserable, days of training under an abusive, ""chickens--t""  first leader, the brothers came together. They learned to hate their leader perhaps as much as the looming Germans; later, this mode of training earned begrudging respect from some of the men. But not before a revolt in their ranks prior to being shipped out to Europe.D-Day offered an early, hard test of their training and teamwork. Their success at knocking out a field battery, I have heard, remains a training example today. Following the own, self-assessment that, if there was a dirty job that needed to be done, Easy Company would be assigned to do it, the brother fight through Holland, the Ardennes, and, finally, Germany.The details of the production fully reveal the $120 million invested. The sepia tones create a wonderful sense of time and place. The large, ensemble cast is magnificent, including David Schwimmer in an unlikely and unlikeable role as the much-despised training camp leader. Damien Lewis, a fine English actor, captures the respect of his men as the focal point Cpt Winter. Each man has something to say, something to contribute. They really are a team, linked by mutual respect and a hard-edged sense of purpose. Watching the men train, struggle, fight and die, I could help but feel frustrated, sympathetic, impressed and sad along with them. I cried more times than I care to recall.This is a fitting, perfect extension of ""Saving Private Ryan."" As Colonel Chamberlain says in ""Gettysburg"", ""What it comes down to, in the end, is that we're fighting for is each other.""",5,A sweeping war saga of courage and brotherhood,1036627200,"11 7, 2002",2002,1939,"['was', ""n't"", 'hero', 'fought', 'lot', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'So', 'one', 'heroic', 'brand', 'brothers', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'best', 'ethos', 'work', 'excellent', 'experience', 'vivid', 'history.This', 'epic', 'July', '1942', 'shortly', 'end', 'war', 'Europe', 'Starting', 'company', 's', 'initial', 'bonding', 'experience', 'hot', 'miserable', 'days', 'training', 'abusive', 'chickens', 't', 'first', 'leader', 'brothers', 'came', 'together', 'learned', 'hate', 'leader', 'perhaps', 'as', 'much', 'looming', 'Germans', 'later', 'mode', 'training', 'earned', 'begrudging', 'respect', 'men', 'not', 'revolt', 'ranks', 'prior', 'being', 'shipped', 'out', 'Europe.D-Day', 'offered', 'early', 'hard', 'test', 'training', 'teamwork', 'success', 'knocking', 'out', 'field', 'battery', 'have', 'heard', 'training', 'example', 'today', 'Following', 'own', 'self-assessment', 'was', 'dirty', 'job', 'needed', 'be', 'done', 'Easy', 'Company', 'would', 'be', 'assigned', 'do', 'brother', 'fight', 'Holland', 'Ardennes', 'finally', 'Germany.The', 'details', 'production', 'fully', '120', 'million', 'invested', 'sepia', 'tones', 'create', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'time', 'place', 'large', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'magnificent', 'including', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'unlikely', 'unlikeable', 'role', 'much-despised', 'training', 'camp', 'leader', 'Damien', 'Lewis', 'fine', 'English', 'actor', 'respect', 'men', 'focal', 'point', 'Cpt', 'Winter', 'man', 'something', 'say', 'something', 'contribute', 'really', 'are', 'team', 'linked', 'mutual', 'respect', 'hard-edged', 'sense', 'purpose', 'Watching', 'men', 'train', 'struggle', 'fight', 'die', 'could', 'help', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'sympathetic', 'impressed', 'sad', 'cried', 'more', 'times', 'care', 'recall.This', 'fitting', 'perfect', 'extension', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Colonel', 'Chamberlain', 'Gettysburg', 'What', 'down', 'end', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'other']",N/A

But this series is as captivating as it is informative, and even entertaining despite the difficult subject matter.  This is the true story of the Easy Company of the 105th Airborne Division paratroopers, following their combat training, their actual combat on D-Day, at Market-Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and their liberation of a concentration camp and control of Hitler's German mountain refuge.  All of the characters are real, and are mostly played by lesser known actors.  David Schwimmer of ""Friends"" does appear in a couple episodes as do ""Saturday Night Live's"" Jimmy Fallon (very briefly) and Tom Hanks' son Colin.  Fans of NBC's ""Boomtown"" will also recognize four of the actors, especially Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough, who have major roles.  Each episode begins with pertinent moments from interviews with the actual surviving members of Easy Company, though they are not identified so as not to give away which characters survive the war.  It takes a while, but becoming familiar with the many characters and their comaraderie for one another is what makes this series so compelling.  Producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have delivered outstanding filmmaking which will definitely remind you of ""Saving Private Ryan"" but improves on that film because of the depth that a miniseries allows.  You will want to watch the DVD extras, especially the 80 minute documentary with the surviving soldiers, so you can see these characters as they are now in real life.  The thirty minute making-of documentary is decent but not extraordinary.

Band of Brothers shows that the real commitment in war is not to the nation or any other large body politic.  It is fought by people who wish to take care of the soldier next to them and not let them down.  I highly recommend this recounting of a company of men who were in the forefront of the fight in Europe on D-Day and through its conclusion on VE Day.

711507,AJANSYFGUIB3K,B00006C7G9,"R Fain ""Rod Fain""","[0, 0]","Epic example of the courage of American soldiers during WWII by the Airborne Infantry.  Based on the true accounts from the book Band of Brothers this is truly a fine piece of work and all the actors in it did credit to the real life heros they portrayed.  Of particular note is that of Damian Lewis who does portray Lt. Winters as a leader of men who does a difficult job of leading men into battle knowing that some may day so that there may be freedom for all who live.  My favorite line from the series comes in the 2nd episode when Damian Lewis (Winters) is in command of Easy Company prior to D-Day and tells Neal McDonough (Lt Compton) not to ever take anything from the men even in gambling.  I believe this was due to his belief that these men were to give so much of themselves in the coming conflict that the officers should not ask more than that,  The knowledge that an officer will be asking men to go into situations where some will die always seems to weigh on Winters mind throughout the series and is a telling point of the sacrifices he sees the men make who were all volunteers.",5,The best series I've ever seen done on WWII is a very real way.

711510,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00006C7G9,Richard B. Schwartz,"[2, 2]","Band of Brothers is a 10-part account of the wartime experience of Easy Company, in the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division.  It begins with their training experience in Georgia and follows them to England, to D-Day in Normandy, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the siege of Bastogne and, eventually, the capturing of Hitler's Eagle Nest headquarters/estate in Bavaria.Featuring Damian Lewis, Ron Livingston, David Schwimmer, Donnie Wahlberg, et al. the miniseries (based on Stephen Ambrose's book) features the individual experiences of individual characters in separate episodes and contains opening commentary by the characters' real-life counterparts.  A sixth disc, containing material on the making of the miniseries, etc. features more interviews with the actual, surviving members of Easy Company.Under the leadership of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the miniseries contains a great deal of realistic footage of the sort seen in Saving Private Ryan.  Limbs are severed and the sounds of bullets and shrapnel whizzing through the air are omnipresent.  We feel the cold of Bastogne, luxuriate in the beauties of Austria and suffer through the training regimens to which the company is subjected.  Watching is not always easy or pleasant, but the emotional impact of the separate episodes is strong.The individual episodes are quite uneven.  Some are extremely powerful, e.g., the training episode and the D-Day episode (with stunning use of CGI).  Others are less satisfactory.  The Bastogne episode, for example, is a long, cold sojourn in foxholes with German artillery and mortar fire shattering trees and shattering bodies.  Civilians, however, will obtain a realistic sense of the actual nature of war.The production is courageous in representing the courage of some individuals, the incompetence of others, given the fact that the `characters' represent real people.  Given the fact that the narrative is historically accurate, our `wishes' as viewers sometimes go unsatisfied.  We want to see much more of Damian Lewis in the role of Dick Winters, for example, but the fact is that Dick Winters was promoted to a battalion position and could not be there, leading Easy Company, for the duration of the miniseries.In general, this is a superb miniseries and the subsidiary material on the sixth disc is excellent.  The actual, historical members of Easy Company speak for themselves with great but simple eloquence and their eyes tell a story of war that brings the reality home in ways that films can never quite do.",5,Superb Miniseries,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",2012,2544,"['Band', 'Brothers', '10-part', 'account', 'wartime', 'experience', 'Easy', 'Company', '506th', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'training', 'experience', 'Georgia', 'England', 'D-Day', 'Normandy', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'Holland', 'siege', 'Bastogne', 'eventually', 'capturing', 'Hitler', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'headquarters/estate', 'Bavaria.Featuring', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'et', 'al', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'individual', 'experiences', 'individual', 'characters', 'separate', 'episodes', 'contains', 'opening', 'commentary', 'characters', 'real-life', 'counterparts', 'sixth', 'disc', 'containing', 'material', 'making', 'miniseries', 'etc', 'features', 'more', 'interviews', 'actual', 'surviving', 'members', 'Easy', 'Company.Under', 'leadership', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'miniseries', 'great', 'deal', 'realistic', 'footage', 'sort', 'seen', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Limbs', 'are', 'severed', 'sounds', 'bullets', 'shrapnel', 'whizzing', 'air', 'are', 'omnipresent', 'feel', 'cold', 'Bastogne', 'luxuriate', 'beauties', 'Austria', 'suffer', 'training', 'regimens', 'company', 'subjected', 'Watching', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'pleasant', 'emotional', 'impact', 'separate', 'episodes', 'strong.The', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'uneven', 'are', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'e.g.', 'training', 'episode', 'D-Day', 'episode', 'stunning', 'use', 'CGI', 'Others', 'are', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'Bastogne', 'episode', 'example', 'long', 'cold', 'sojourn', 'foxholes', 'German', 'artillery', 'mortar', 'fire', 'shattering', 'trees', 'shattering', 'bodies', 'Civilians', 'however', 'will', 'obtain', 'realistic', 'sense', 'actual', 'nature', 'war.The', 'production', 'courageous', 'representing', 'courage', 'individuals', 'incompetence', 'others', 'given', 'fact', 'characters', 'represent', 'real', 'people', 'Given', 'fact', 'narrative', 'historically', 'accurate', 'wishes', 'viewers', 'sometimes', 'go', 'unsatisfied', 'want', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'role', 'Dick', 'Winters', 'example', 'fact', 'Dick', 'Winters', 'was', 'promoted', 'battalion', 'position', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'there', 'leading', 'Easy', 'Company', 'duration', 'miniseries.In', 'general', 'superb', 'miniseries', 'subsidiary', 'material', 'sixth', 'disc', 'excellent', 'actual', 'historical', 'members', 'Easy', 'Company', 'speak', 'great', 'simple', 'eloquence', 'eyes', 'tell', 'story', 'war', 'reality', 'home', 'ways', 'films', 'can', 'never', 'quite', 'do']",N/A

Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this series, based on true occurrences, has all the realism and gut wrenching tension that we saw in ""Saving Private Ryan"".I had no idea of what was in store for me when I dropped the first disc in the DVD player. I was simply mesmerized: I could have sat through the entire series non-stop except for the fact the five movie discs plus one specialty disc took up about 12 hours. I could hardly wait for the next day to arrive to watch the next segment.The series is about a group of men that volunteer for the newly formed parachute regiment and eventually drop in behind enemy lines in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. They eventually end up capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in Austria as WWll ends.When I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" I didn't think that any war movie could be better: I was wrong. Band of Brothers is well acted, incredible realistic and shows you what a prolonged campaign must have been like with the constant stress and tension that turned boys into men and men into.....As this series develops, from one story to the next, you begin to appreciate the meaning of the cliche "" the fog of war"": sometimes simple sorties turn into unexpected nightmares and then other times when all seem lost, something or someone, completely unexpected, will turn up and save the day. You just can never predict in war what will happen: who will turn in a hero or a man paralyzed with fear or fatigue. Nothing is ever a 100% sure bet.Adding to the drama of the story are the interviews with the actual participants who lived through this horrific period and are still alive today.

711528,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00006C7G9,Robert Badgley,"[2, 2]","Michael Kaman,music.Kaman is responsible in a large part for the success of this wonderful mini series co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.The music is epic in tone,grand in sweep and sets the emotional mood throughout the series.Kudos to Kaman for his spectacular work.The series,based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose of the same name,follows the exploits of the men of the 101st Airborne(Screaming Eagles),506 PIR(Parachute Infantry Regiment),E(Easy)Company from their training in Toccoa,Georgia in 1942 to near the end of the units de-activation at the end of /46.Ambrose while generally a good author was known to have his ""moments"" and ""Band of Brothers"" was no exception.The biggest mistake he made here is depicting E Company taking Hitlers' so called ""Eagle's Nest"" above the town of Berhtesgarden,first.In point of fact the 7th Infantry from the Third Infantry Division took it on May 4/45,a day before the 101st arrived.This has been long known fact as it was even in the 101st Divsions' own official history in ""Rendezvous With Destiny"" and even in(the Airbornes' own over all commander)General Maxwell Taylors' memoirs,both written years ago.It's unfortunate Ambrose didn't do the proper research.In 2008 a plaque was finally dedicated at the ""Eagle's Nest"" site of the 3rd's accomplishment.However,despite this faux paux and others much smaller,the series is still an oustanding piece of story telling.It tells with great drama,grit and realism the story of these brave and great young men as they trudge across Europe,often enduring the unendurable.There is little left out as far as realistic touches go;from the equipment,weapons and machinery used to the interaction of the men themselves and the wounds they receive both pyhsically and mentally,as they slowly and surely bond with each other,becoming ""brothers"" in arms.We also witness a certain""pecking order"" that develops amongst the men;from those that were there from basic training and all the way to end,as compared to the replacements that arrive piecemeal into the group.There are ten eps in this series ranging from around 50-70 minutes in length.All are filmed in widescreen(taken from a hi-def master)with a colour-washed sepia tone to them,giving a nice added touch to the proceedings.Also the camera work and editing provides(especially during battle scenes)a wonderful immediacy that draws the viewers easily into the action.The actors throughout the series display a wonderful restraint,an ""under-acting"",if you will,which again serves to enhance the entire pace and mood of the series(watch for Simon Pegg of ""Hot Fuzz"" fame briefly as a courier!).From the acting to the directing,editing,story writing and to it's final execution,it is top drawer all the way.Therefore it was no surprise that it garnered itself six of the 19 Emmy awards it was nominated for.I believe it is STILL the most successful DVD release of all time to date,and deservedly so!Along with the 10 eps on five discs,each disc contains a story summary,the usual scene selection and language selections,along with a ""field guide"" which includes:an intro to the field guide,soldiers(a blurb on the main characters),an historical timeline,a general map of Europe,a glossary of terms(military jargon,etc)and chain of command which lists the ranks of command from top to bottom,in order.On the sixth disc there is a documentary""We Stand Together Alone"",about 77 minutes long.Also a behind the scenes doc about 29 mins.long,a video on-set diary by actor Ron Livingston(Capt.Dixon),some footage on the premiere of the film in France in June of 2001,little vids of each Easy Company persona and a photo gallery.I cannot recommend this set""Band of Brothers"" highly enough.Although vets and WW2 buffs will get the most out of this set,there is enough plain human drama and emotion in this series to attract just about everyone in every demographic.Very few watching will be able to catch or really care about any mistakes that may have arisen in the series.Its'intelligent and highly crafted story line,its great acting and beautiful soundtrack far and away make up for any shortcomings.A great piece of historical stortytelling that belongs in every one's home!",5,World War Two comes to

Following E (""Easy"") Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne throughout their World War Two trials, the production, script, direction, and acting combine to make this possibly the most compelling production about war and the camaraderie of men who have served in combat together that has ever been filmed, and for that we own Stephen Ambrose, Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg genuine gratitude. Ambrose wrote the book on which the series is based, and oddly, while good, I didn't find the book in the same league as the series, or Dick Winters' autobiography (which I highly recommend.) The genius here was in the synthesis of excellent scripts, general historical accuracy, a perfect cast, first-rate special effects, and a keen directorial eye, which resulted in a sum far greater than its parts.While I was floored by the entire cast, I have to single out a few for special mention. First and foremost, Damian Lewis as Maj. Dick Winters gave one of the greatest performances in cinema history. Period. There is no way that his nuanced performance could have been improved upon by anyone.  Ron Livingston also gave the performance of a lifetime as Winters' best friend, Capt. Lewis Nixon. We can also thank Livingston for his good humored behind-the-scenes video diaries which are included as extras in the set. Donnie Wahlberg likewise gave a great performance as Carwood Lipton, the most mature of the soldiers, while Neal McDonough perfected the role of the sensitive Lt. Buck Compton, a brave man troubled by the horrors he had endured. Finally, Matthew Settle appears as Capt. Ronald Speirs, an enigmatic warrior, whose legend is (perhaps) bigger than the man himself, and who has some mighty big shoes to fill when Winters departs for a headquarters position. The cast is huge, but suffice it to say that every single cast member was superior in their role.The DVD set comes with numerous features, including a ""Making of 'Band of Brothers'"" feature (which could have been longer in my opinion,) and a superior documentary about the real men of Easy Company, called ""We Stand Alone Together."" Unlike most sets of this size and scope, every single minute is worth watching, re-watching, and truly absorbing.

711534,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00006C7G9,Robert Moore,"[5, 6]","By any standard, this is easily one of the finest things ever done about World War II, or for that matter about any war.  The series details the adventures of Easy Company of the 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne from their training in Georgia through D-Day and action in Belgium and into Germany.  The reason that this mini-series is so successful is not hard to determine:  no effort to make it as accurate and as good as possible was spared.  In every detail, the show is as close to perfect as is possible.Who to praise first?  One could easily start with the actors.  The cast is absolutely first rate, and they not only are extraordinarily fine as actors, they also bear an amazing physical resemblance to the real life individuals whom they portray.  If you look at the photos in the Stephen Ambrose book upon which the series was based or watch the documentary WE STAND ALONE TOGETHER, which featured interviews with the survivors of Easy Company, the likenesses are striking.  Although the entire cast is superb, Damian Lewis pretty much steals the whole show as Winters.  I love the quiet competence and confident leadership he projects in all his scenes.  If I were to go to war myself, I would very much like to serve under someone like Winters.  Unbelievably, Damian Lewis is English, which seems scarcely possible his accent is so natural.  Ron Livingston is a wonderful surprise as Capt. Nixon.  I had previously seen him in purely comic roles in SWINGERS and then in OFFICE SPACE, and while he definitely brings a mildly comic tone to this series, it isn't in the end a role that brings nothing but smiles.  Eion Bailey is memorable in his role as Pvt. Webster, the Harvard educated noncom who wants to become a writer.  He also is the character who allowed me to keep alive a boast I make to a friend that I can connect almost any movie or television show to Buffy the Vampire Slayer in one way or another (he appeared as one of the students who took on hyena-like qualities in the episode &quot;The Pack&quot; from the first season).  The rest of the cast is always at least very good.The technical aspects of the film are just off the chart.  The film always looks and sounds great.  Much like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, many of the battle scenes have an almost tactile feel to them.  Some feel so real that I as a viewer felt physically vulnerable.  In a large number of the episodes I had that same sensation of almost being pulled into the film.  In a large number of the battle scenes they employed handheld cameras, and that helped induce a &quot;you were there&quot; kind of experience.  One of the greatest achievements was giving the illusion of the film being shot on location, while in fact nearly the entire film was shot on a huge lot in England.  During filming it was remade constantly to recreate the various locations that were needed.  There were some scenes filmed on location, but far fewer than one would have imagined.All of this excellence meshes together to tell in superb fashion the tales of real human beings.  Throughout one gets the sense that these are ordinary human beings who are called upon by the demands of history to do extraordinary things.  All in all, this is a remarkable achievement, a landmark both of television and of filmmaking about World War Two.  I can't imagine anyone seeing it finding it is any sense a disappointment.",5,An exceptional series about a remarkable group of men,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,3385,"['standard', 'easily', 'one', 'finest', 'things', 'ever', 'done', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'matter', 'war', 'series', 'details', 'adventures', 'Easy', 'Company', '506th', 'Regiment', '101st', 'Airborne', 'training', 'Georgia', 'D-Day', 'action', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'reason', 'mini-series', 'so', 'successful', 'not', 'hard', 'determine', 'effort', 'make', 'accurate', 'as', 'good', 'possible', 'was', 'spared', 'detail', 'show', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', 'possible.Who', 'praise', 'first', 'One', 'could', 'easily', 'start', 'actors', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'extraordinarily', 'fine', 'actors', 'also', 'bear', 'amazing', 'physical', 'resemblance', 'real', 'life', 'individuals', 'whom', 'portray', 'look', 'photos', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'watch', 'documentary', 'WE', 'STAND', 'ALONE', 'TOGETHER', 'featured', 'interviews', 'survivors', 'Easy', 'Company', 'likenesses', 'are', 'striking', 'entire', 'cast', 'superb', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'whole', 'show', 'Winters', 'love', 'quiet', 'competence', 'confident', 'leadership', 'projects', 'scenes', 'were', 'go', 'war', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'serve', 'someone', 'Winters', 'Unbelievably', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'English', 'scarcely', 'possible', 'accent', 'so', 'natural', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'Capt', 'Nixon', 'had', 'previously', 'seen', 'purely', 'comic', 'roles', 'SWINGERS', 'then', 'OFFICE', 'SPACE', 'definitely', 'mildly', 'comic', 'tone', 'series', ""n't"", 'end', 'role', 'nothing', 'smiles', 'Eion', 'Bailey', 'memorable', 'role', 'Pvt', 'Webster', 'Harvard', 'educated', 'noncom', 'who', 'become', 'writer', 'also', 'character', 'who', 'allowed', 'keep', 'alive', 'boast', 'make', 'friend', 'can', 'connect', 'almost', 'movie', 'television', 'show', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'one', 'way', 'appeared', 'one', 'students', 'who', 'took', 'hyena-like', 'qualities', 'episode', 'quot', 'Pack', 'quot', 'first', 'season', 'rest', 'cast', 'always', 'least', 'very', 'good.The', 'technical', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'chart', 'film', 'always', 'great', 'Much', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'have', 'almost', 'tactile', 'feel', 'feel', 'so', 'real', 'viewer', 'felt', 'physically', 'vulnerable', 'large', 'number', 'episodes', 'had', 'same', 'sensation', 'almost', 'being', 'pulled', 'film', 'large', 'number', 'battle', 'employed', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'helped', 'induce', 'quot', 'were', 'quot', 'kind', 'experience', 'One', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'was', 'giving', 'illusion', 'film', 'being', 'shot', 'location', 'fact', 'nearly', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'huge', 'lot', 'England', 'filming', 'was', 'remade', 'constantly', 'recreate', 'various', 'locations', 'were', 'needed', 'were', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'location', 'far', 'fewer', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'imagined.All', 'excellence', 'together', 'tell', 'superb', 'fashion', 'tales', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'one', 'sense', 'are', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'demands', 'history', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'landmark', 'television', 'filmmaking', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'seeing', 'finding', 'sense', 'disappointment']",N/A

711569,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00006C7G9,Scott Schiefelbein,"[3, 3]","The accolades cannot pile up high enough to overwhelm HBO's epic 10-part miniseries, ""Band of Brothers.""  Based on the famous book by the late, great historian Stephen Ambrose, ""BoB"" sets a high-water mark for television.On a personal note, I watched this miniseries after falling in love with HBO's ""The Sopranos"" and watching the first four seasons of that mesmerizing series.  I have to admit that I was a little concerned about going back to the gosh-darn solidity and goodness of the Greatest Generation after being steeped in the murderous cynicism of the Soprano family for a few weeks.  How could the noble soldiers of D-Day compare to the awful, glorious humanity of America's favorite crime family?  I was prepared to slog through ten hours of bland goodness and sacrifice, spiced only by action scenes.I shouldn't have worried.  Stephen Ambrose served as co-executive producer of this series, along with Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and other noteworthy talents.  Gifted writing and directing showed the intimate details of the life of Easy Company as it is forged in basic training and the D-Day invasion and the pounding it took in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market-Garden, up through discovering one of the first concentration camps to the taking of Hitler's famed Eagle's Nest in the Alps.  Rather than serve up a bunch of cardboard cutouts, the creative team shows a cast of soldiers full of hopes, dreams, sins, virtues, and flaws.In short, ""BoB"" tells the real story of real men who did amazing things during their 434 days in Europe.  Even though the action scenes are legitimately amazing (often rivalling the best scenes from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" if not surprassing them), the strongest elements of ""BoB"" are the quiet ones.  Whether showing the struggles of a man raised from the ranks to become an officer, or the pain associated with losing a beloved comrade on one of the last patrols of the war, or the fury that only comes from being ordered about by a complete cretin, ""BoB"" captures the essence of what it was to be a ""grunt.""  Ambrose was famously a fan of Eisenhower, Marshall, and the infantryman.  That love comes through in this series in spades.Spicing most of the series are interviews with actual members of Easy Company.  To watch these old soldiers recall these dark days with such humility simply stuns you into silence.HBO has done an amazing thing with ""BoB.""  By focusing on a company that was seemingly everywhere in the Allied advance across Europe, ""BoB"" tells as comprehensive a tale as can be told of our experiences over there.

711577,AP3V63JVKLEO5,B00006C7G9,Sherman A. Thompson,"[17, 17]","I doubt that this World War II series will ever be equalled. Many factors had to be brought together to make an epic such as this. Words fail me in an attempt to praise this series sufficiently. After seeing several episodes on HBO I knew I had to have my own copy of the series in its entirety so I could dissect and review it slowly, part by part, at my leisure.I bought the DVD package, then bought a DVD player so I could watch it. It has been worth every dollar invested.The story line and dramatization depicts E company of the 101st ""Screaming Eagle"" Airborne Division from the time it was formed and trained in Virginia, and all the way through the battles it fought, from D-Day to the end of the European war and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchesgarten.The episodes are pure reality and the events really happened. Most of the dialog consists of the same words as they was actully spoken by the real troopers who somehow lived through it.  This series tends to leave the vewer stunned and pensive for a few minutes after the screen goes blank at the end of each episode. This is largely because the surviving troopers, who are now very old men, supplied first hand accounts of the events depicted, the descriptions of what it was actually like. and much of the dialog, word for word still engraved in their memories after so many years. Each of them was given a copy of the script to review, comment on, and correct. The actors were selected, in part, by their resemblence to the young paratroopers, as they were over fifty years ago.This series should be required viewing in every American high school curriculum. Aside from breathtaking entertainment, it allows the younger generations to see how horrible war can get, and the debt all Americans owe to the young men who fought and died to preserve our freedoms. The only film that even remotely came close was the much shorter WW-1 true story, ""Lost Battallion.""The viewer gets to know the men's names, their personality characteristics, their strengths, and their weaknesses.  The characters eventually become almost like family to the viewer.  When a leg is blown off or a seemingly fatal shot is taken to the head, the viewer is genuinely upset, and later relieved when word comes that the trooper somehow survived in the hospital. This is war reality at its best, without actually being in it.The cinematography and musical score are sensitive and virtually perfect.  The series was filmed in muted color, neither black and white, nor full color, but a perfect blend of both, setting a perfect mood for the time and events. Hanks and Spielberg really outdid themselves on this series. It sets a high water mark for the cinematographer's art in skill, sensitivity, and accuracy.I would add more praise but must stay within the 1,000 word review limit. Nothing I can say can do it adequate justice, anyway.Get this series; you won't be sorry.

711580,A2ZDY6WY3MDJVZ,B00006C7G9,"Sight Reader ""sight_reader""","[4, 5]","Catapulted by momentum from ""Saving Private Ryan"", the astounding achievement of ""Band of Brothers"" was badly undermined by its ill-timed September 11th premiere.  Based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose, this HBO series follows Easy Company, an elite American airborne (parachute) company, all the way from training camp to German occupation duty.  The death toll amongst these men was horrific, and reverence for their sacrifice clings onto every frame.  Scattered hopelessly across Normandy, this unit wrenched the crucial town of Carentan from ammo-starved Germans, participated in the massive airborne debacle of Operation Market Garden (rescuing many British paratroopers), suffered horrible losses in at the Battle of the Bulge, held off an ""offensive"" at Haguenau, and finally seized the ""Eagle's Nest"", Hitler's personal luxury perch in the mountains.The highly effective style pioneered by ""Saving Private Ryan"" (steady-cam with washed out colors) suffuses the entire series with a gritty documentary feel.  Occasionally an obvious CGI or studio shot will clash with lush location shooting, but overall the production values are staggering.  Even minor historical details are studiously reproduced, but, like ""Private Ryan"", the camera never wallows in indulgent spectacle.  The miniseries format is used to full advantage to present a truly comprehensive account of war from a wide variety of viewpoints that normally can't be appreciated.  Since the events of history itself do not neatly line themselves up in the sort of dramatic arc viewers are accustomed to, some may leave the series with a sense that it is dramatically uneven.  Each episode, usually a bit over an hour long, is elegantly introduced in both mood and content by interviews with actual survivors from the company.Like the best of war films, the emphasis is not on bloodshed and action, but on human relationship and suffering within the company.  The performances, by a dedicated cast of largely unknown players, are uniformly excellent, but very little help is given to the first time viewer in identifying the multitude of war-weary faces (often, even after several important appearances, a character's full name is never mentioned).  While this can be frustrating for new viewers, it allows for dialogue unencumbered by forced introductions and creates immense replay value, with new insights appearing with every viewing.The character confusion is alleviated nicely by some of the DVD's reference features.  Accompanying each episode is a picture gallery of the important names and faces in that episode, as well as a glossary of terminology and the general locations within Europe.  A somewhat less useful timeline is included, and a few of the most important characters are given nice dramatic collages (perhaps used when promoting the series).The DVD offers 5.1, DTS, and surround sound, all of which are richly spectacular.  Only Spanish is offered in subtitle, and (unfortunately) no commentary tracks accompany any of the episodes.  A 30 minute ""Making Of"" feature briefly describes techniques used in filming in a promotional sort of way, but it is not as promotional as a feature describing the gala screening at Normandy (very few of the veteran's reactions are shown) nor as obnoxious as a Jeep advertisement that somehow snuck onto the disc.Two further wonderful additions are provided in the DVD: a full and moving documentary, consisting solely of the gripping interviews of Easy Company's survivors, and Ron Livingston's (Office Space) thorough and very likeable video diary of the actor's boot camp.",5,A miniseries in the tradition of Saving Private Ryan,1036713600,"11 8, 2002",2002,3607,"['Catapulted', 'momentum', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'astounding', 'achievement', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'was', 'badly', 'undermined', 'ill-timed', 'September', '11th', 'premiere', 'Based', 'book', 'late', 'Stephen', 'Ambrose', 'HBO', 'series', 'Easy', 'Company', 'elite', 'American', 'airborne', 'parachute', 'company', 'way', 'training', 'camp', 'German', 'occupation', 'duty', 'death', 'toll', 'men', 'was', 'horrific', 'reverence', 'sacrifice', 'clings', 'frame', 'Scattered', 'hopelessly', 'Normandy', 'unit', 'wrenched', 'crucial', 'town', 'Carentan', 'ammo-starved', 'Germans', 'participated', 'massive', 'airborne', 'debacle', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'rescuing', 'many', 'British', 'paratroopers', 'suffered', 'horrible', 'losses', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'held', 'off', 'offensive', 'Haguenau', 'finally', 'seized', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'Hitler', 'personal', 'luxury', 'perch', 'mountains.The', 'highly', 'effective', 'style', 'pioneered', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'steady-cam', 'washed', 'out', 'colors', 'entire', 'series', 'gritty', 'documentary', 'feel', 'Occasionally', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'studio', 'shot', 'will', 'clash', 'lush', 'location', 'shooting', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'staggering', 'Even', 'minor', 'historical', 'details', 'are', 'studiously', 'reproduced', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'camera', 'never', 'indulgent', 'spectacle', 'miniseries', 'format', 'used', 'full', 'advantage', 'present', 'truly', 'comprehensive', 'account', 'war', 'wide', 'variety', 'viewpoints', 'normally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'appreciated', 'events', 'history', 'do', 'not', 'neatly', 'line', 'up', 'sort', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'viewers', 'are', 'accustomed', 'may', 'leave', 'series', 'sense', 'dramatically', 'uneven', 'episode', 'usually', 'bit', 'hour', 'long', 'elegantly', 'introduced', 'mood', 'content', 'interviews', 'actual', 'survivors', 'company.Like', 'best', 'war', 'films', 'emphasis', 'not', 'bloodshed', 'action', 'human', 'relationship', 'suffering', 'company', 'performances', 'dedicated', 'cast', 'largely', 'unknown', 'players', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'very', 'little', 'help', 'given', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'identifying', 'multitude', 'war-weary', 'often', 'even', 'several', 'important', 'appearances', 'character', 'full', 'name', 'never', 'mentioned', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'new', 'viewers', 'dialogue', 'unencumbered', 'forced', 'introductions', 'immense', 'replay', 'value', 'new', 'insights', 'appearing', 'viewing.The', 'character', 'confusion', 'alleviated', 'nicely', 'DVD', 'reference', 'features', 'Accompanying', 'episode', 'picture', 'gallery', 'important', 'names', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'glossary', 'terminology', 'general', 'locations', 'Europe', 'A', 'somewhat', 'less', 'useful', 'timeline', 'included', 'few', 'most', 'important', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'nice', 'dramatic', 'collages', 'perhaps', 'used', 'when', 'promoting', 'series', '.The', 'DVD', '5.1', 'DTS', 'surround', 'sound', 'are', 'richly', 'spectacular', 'Only', 'Spanish', 'offered', 'subtitle', 'unfortunately', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'accompany', 'episodes', '30', 'minute', 'Making', 'feature', 'briefly', 'techniques', 'used', 'filming', 'promotional', 'sort', 'way', 'not', 'as', 'promotional', 'feature', 'describing', 'gala', 'screening', 'Normandy', 'very', 'few', 'veteran', 'reactions', 'are', 'shown', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'Jeep', 'advertisement', 'somehow', 'snuck', 'disc.Two', 'further', 'wonderful', 'additions', 'are', 'provided', 'DVD', 'full', 'moving', 'documentary', 'consisting', 'solely', 'gripping', 'interviews', 'Easy', 'Company', 'survivors', 'Ron', 'Livingston', 'Office', 'Space', 'thorough', 'very', 'likeable', 'video', 'diary', 'actor', 'boot', 'camp']",N/A

Lu ""sensiblefootwear""","[1, 2]","...is the most profound legacy of the actions of veterans of WWII, such as those in Easy Company whose heroic exploits against pro-White Germany are documented in Band of Brothers.  It would be hard to come to such a conclusion from a two-or-three-hour film like Saving Private Ryan which--in conforming to narrow plot conventions--presents an abbreviated, textbook example of both the horrors of war and its competing causes (i.e. freedom vs. tyranny), the only things one can divine from brief exposure to such an enormous subject as WWII in the European theater.  With its meandering serialized form, BOB can more accurately depict the totality of life during warfare:  moods, sensations, joys, lust, comraderie, hunger, fear, hatred, compassion, and, most of all, boredom.  The sheer drudgery of war--the monotonous beat of advancing columns, battle prep, attack and counterattack--is simply beyond the scope of any film.  When one is absorbed by the subtleties of BOB, one begins to see the metaphorical forest which, for me, was the forest, or more specifically the color of the forest, and the snow, and the dirt, and the soldiers and their uniforms.  The muted, almost monochromatic color scheme is striking, as is the fact that virtually everyone is white.  Could any of these soldiers even conceive of the world they were bringing about in this battlefield, this ""crucible of time""?  They fought for our freedoms, yes, but our free society is--at least in theory--ephemeral, as political systems may come and go given the current circumstance.  In the aftermath of some staggering disaster, I doubt that a freewheeling democracy would remain when a more authoritarian regime would be better suited for those in need of mere survival.

Melvin,"[2, 2]","Band of Brothers is likely known for its near real representation of life for the average &#34;Joe&#34; (U.S. military soldier) during World War II.  The cast did a marvelous job of portraying the life and attitudes of the American soldiers during that time period.  The director and crew only helped the matter by bringing the audience right into the picture in a way that, at times, made you feel like you were in the thick of things with the soldiers being represented.This series follows the lives of the soldiers of &#34;Easy&#34; Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, pulling from interviews with veterans from that outfit and sprinkling in a bit of Hollywood flare and pizazz.  The overall effect is a captivating look into the lives of an American soldier and how they handled the most stressful of situations (combat) and the most mundane periods between.  Ever wonder if soldiers enjoyed a little rest and relaxation while in combat?  How about, the sights and sounds of artillery and machine gun fire, while witnessing a tank advancing on your position?  That and much more are captured in this series in, what many military veterans, both old and young alike, have described as the closest you can get to the real thing while still in the comfort of your home.Overall, this collection is worth viewing and includes some great footage from interviews with actual veterans from the war.

711598,ABVULUZ2ILKKO,B00006C7G9,Stephen Ressel,"[1, 2]","Lots of Hollywood efforts toward dramatizing WW2 look too glossy, make the death too sanitized or far flung gore.  Human relations are usually lost, and love stories thrown in to grab the girls.  It becomes about the grit, the determination, and the supermen on the line.  But, in this mini-series you get actual relations of people in the military ranks, to leadership, to each other, and shows them dealing with the chaos of war in a very human approach and without piles of blood and intestines strewn through the shots to hammer home the idea that someone died.Made by the 'Private Ryan' heads, I found this film much better.  'Private Ryan' was rather boring.  It did what it had to do - punctuate the hell of D-Day, and then get you into the closer fighting in towns, and the lack of orientation that must happen in heated battles.  But 'Ryan' seemed like a comic book compared to this adaptation of a book by a US soldier in WWII.  'Band Of Brothers' takes you through the entire experience of the war, and makes it work by making a stew of solid entertainment crafted from great acting, great writing and script editing, great directing (most times), great lighting, great effects, great characters, great settings, and wonderful detail.  Is it precisely historic?  Who can really say?  The Euros and war-sissies always get strung out on anything that isn't their view of events from a distant seat.  From what I know of WW2 and how people are under pressure in situations of danger, this sure seems absolutely plausible.  But, what does it matter?  The purpose of this is to create an escapism drama wrapped around real people and events.  And it succeeds 110%.The weakest facet of most all dramatic simplifications of complex histories is that they can easily lose many people that are not intimately aware of the geography, time line, or greater events surrounding the subject portrayed.  'Band of Brothers' would have really been aided by the old standard of a map with arrows animating along to show how the troops were progressing, or where they were at every part of the story (usually beginning of episodes).  It really was getting confusing during the battle of the bulge when the 101st was surrounded, but you never get the idea they were truly surrounded or cut off, and have no idea where this all is taking place; fox holes, town, blue lighting, yellow lighting, two worlds apart, people say things, we can't tell what is going on, somehow it is connected.Despite the nay saying, this really does show a lot of the earthy and practical attitudes of Americans under fire.  Some falter, some crack, some die, some harden themselves, some are afraid, some fool hardy, and true to the history they make it work by applying pressure and standing ground.  You can tell how everyone is changed by the war, and how most will go back home and have trouble sleeping for decades to come after all they were through.  Contrary to the soldier who commented a while back, I remember seeing a documentary that related how Eisenhower came into Berlin, or some part of Germany at the end of the war, saw the unshaven, sloppy, dirty, US soldiers contrasted against the clean, proper lines and energy of the Germans, and said something like, 'We have to do something.  Our soldiers look like sacks of garbage.'  And thus, Ike got the army uniform trimmed.  'Band' shows the men slowly becoming dirtier, more unkempt, and scattered through the heavy battles up to the end of the war when they cleaned up very well after the pressure was off.  I don't envy the men of WW2, but I sure do thank them for a job well done.  And I thank Hanks/Spielberg for dramatizing it so effectively.",5,Greatest WW2 Dramamentary ...,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,3682,"['Lots', 'Hollywood', 'efforts', 'dramatizing', 'WW2', 'look', 'too', 'glossy', 'make', 'death', 'too', 'sanitized', 'far', 'flung', 'gore', 'Human', 'relations', 'are', 'usually', 'lost', 'love', 'stories', 'thrown', 'grab', 'girls', 'grit', 'determination', 'supermen', 'line', 'mini-series', 'get', 'actual', 'relations', 'people', 'military', 'ranks', 'leadership', 'other', 'dealing', 'chaos', 'war', 'very', 'human', 'approach', 'piles', 'blood', 'intestines', 'strewn', 'shots', 'hammer', 'home', 'idea', 'someone', 'died.Made', ""'Private"", 'Ryan', 'heads', 'found', 'film', 'much', 'better', ""'Private"", 'Ryan', 'was', 'rather', 'boring', 'did', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'punctuate', 'hell', 'D-Day', 'then', 'get', 'closer', 'fighting', 'towns', 'lack', 'orientation', 'must', 'happen', 'heated', 'battles', 'seemed', 'comic', 'book', 'compared', 'adaptation', 'book', 'US', 'soldier', 'WWII', ""'Band"", 'Brothers', 'entire', 'experience', 'war', 'work', 'making', 'stew', 'solid', 'entertainment', 'crafted', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'writing', 'script', 'editing', 'great', 'directing', 'most', 'times', 'great', 'lighting', 'great', 'effects', 'great', 'characters', 'great', 'settings', 'wonderful', 'detail', 'precisely', 'historic', 'Who', 'can', 'really', 'say', 'Euros', 'war-sissies', 'always', 'get', 'strung', 'out', 'anything', ""n't"", 'view', 'events', 'distant', 'seat', 'what', 'know', 'WW2', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'pressure', 'situations', 'danger', 'sure', 'absolutely', 'plausible', 'what', 'matter', 'purpose', 'create', 'escapism', 'drama', 'wrapped', 'real', 'people', 'events', '110', '%', '.The', 'weakest', 'facet', 'most', 'dramatic', 'simplifications', 'complex', 'histories', 'can', 'easily', 'lose', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'intimately', 'aware', 'geography', 'time', 'line', 'greater', 'events', 'surrounding', 'subject', 'portrayed', ""'Band"", 'Brothers', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'aided', 'old', 'standard', 'map', 'arrows', 'animating', 'along', 'show', 'how', 'troops', 'were', 'progressing', 'where', 'were', 'part', 'story', 'usually', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'really', 'was', 'getting', 'confusing', 'battle', 'bulge', 'when', '101st', 'was', 'surrounded', 'never', 'get', 'idea', 'were', 'truly', 'surrounded', 'cut', 'off', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'taking', 'place', 'fox', 'holes', 'town', 'blue', 'lighting', 'yellow', 'lighting', 'two', 'worlds', 'apart', 'people', 'say', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'somehow', 'connected.Despite', 'nay', 'saying', 'really', 'show', 'lot', 'earthy', 'practical', 'attitudes', 'Americans', 'fire', 'falter', 'crack', 'die', 'harden', 'are', 'afraid', 'fool', 'hardy', 'true', 'history', 'make', 'work', 'applying', 'pressure', 'standing', 'ground', 'can', 'tell', 'how', 'everyone', 'changed', 'war', 'how', 'most', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'have', 'trouble', 'sleeping', 'decades', 'come', 'were', 'Contrary', 'soldier', 'who', 'commented', 'while', 'back', 'remember', 'seeing', 'documentary', 'related', 'how', 'Eisenhower', 'came', 'Berlin', 'part', 'Germany', 'end', 'war', 'saw', 'unshaven', 'sloppy', 'dirty', 'US', 'soldiers', 'contrasted', 'clean', 'proper', 'lines', 'energy', 'Germans', 'said', 'something', ""'We"", 'have', 'do', 'something', 'soldiers', 'look', 'sacks', 'garbage', 'thus', 'Ike', 'got', 'army', 'uniform', 'trimmed', ""'Band"", 'men', 'slowly', 'becoming', 'dirtier', 'more', 'unkempt', 'scattered', 'heavy', 'battles', 'up', 'end', 'war', 'when', 'cleaned', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'pressure', 'was', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'envy', 'men', 'WW2', 'sure', 'do', 'thank', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'thank', 'Hanks/Spielberg', 'dramatizing', 'so', 'effectively']",N/A

Those men went through hell as they were asked to do what no-one should expect other human beings to do on their behalf; yet still it continues.The series is split into 10 episodes beginning with the raw recruits' training camp through to training for D-Day in England, D-Day itself, Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge to the `liberation'of Berchtesgarden where Hitler had his Bavarian country retreat. At the time it was the most expensive TV mini-series ever made and it shows. The production values are superb and the action brilliantly realized. But it is the individual stories that really grip against the backdrop of the momentous events the series describes.This has to be one of the most extraordinary and finest television productions in history and what lends it historical credibility is the inclusion of some of the surviving members of Easy Company who comment at the start of each new episode. An added bonus is the final documentary on the last disc with the real BoBs describing their own individual experiences.Avoiding the touches of schmaltz that sometimes mar Spielberg's films this is, for once, a production that really does live up to and exceed the hype!

And this is one extraordinary series. Once I started watching it, I could not stop. The acting is uniformly superb. No big box-office names, but you will recognize many of the actors. Great pacing and continuity on the story. First rate special effects. As we're introduced to the people in this, we begin to know and care about all of them. Donnie Wahlberg really is an excellent actor. Though his brother Mark has had more box office success, I think Donnie is a more well-rounded and nuanced actor. Also retired Capt. Dale Dye is in this. He is always good. While others pretend to be military, all he has to do is be himself. From start to finish, an emotional and entertaining masterpiece.

But it's mine now, so for those few who've never seen it, here's a brief synopsis. Produced by Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List), this is one for the history books...literally. It's the true story of Easy Company, an airborne division that air dropped behind enemy lines the night before D-Day. Their history is detailed from the night of the drop through their final action of taking Hitler's Bertchesgarten (the Eagle's Nest, his mountain retreat). What separates this from the multitude of WW II movies is that, before each episode, surviving members of Easy Company at time of filming told their personal stories. As time continues, anyone involved in any theatre of the campaign will be gone; and it's that personal history that needs...MUST be preserved.Great soundtrack, very realistic; to the last detail. Very well researched and documented.Drawbacks: Price (it ain't your bargain bin product yet, but you get a lot of for what you pay!). The battle scenes are graphic, but war isn't pretty; and I'm glad the producers opted for real rather than sterile. I'm not a fan of the ""handicam"" view, as it causes a vertigo feeling when you view it (at least to me; make your own conclusions). It's long, but best viewed in one sitting...hard to do, but worth your time.If you don't get that lump-in-your-throat, misty-eyed feeling during this film, check your heart and make sure you still have one!Make it a tradition to watch this on on Memorial Day, at the minimum. Honor those who have made it possible for you to be here in the first place, let alone to see it in relative freedom. God bless the men of Easy Company, the veterans of every war, and those still fighting today for their country and for the sake of others; and for the ideals of freedom and democracy.",4,Band of Brothers,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2007,"['set', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'been', 'waiting', 'get', 'hands', 'ever', 'orginal', 'HBO', 'airings', 'mini-series', 'came', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'huevos', 'put', 'out', 'kind', 'money', 'mine', 'now', 'few', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'here', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'Produced', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Schindler', 'List', 'one', 'history', 'books', 'literally', 'true', 'story', 'Easy', 'Company', 'airborne', 'division', 'air', 'dropped', 'enemy', 'lines', 'night', 'D-Day', 'history', 'detailed', 'night', 'drop', 'final', 'action', 'taking', 'Hitler', 'Bertchesgarten', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'mountain', 'retreat', 'What', 'multitude', 'WW', 'II', 'movies', 'episode', 'surviving', 'members', 'Easy', 'Company', 'time', 'filming', 'told', 'personal', 'stories', 'time', 'anyone', 'involved', 'theatre', 'campaign', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'personal', 'history', 'MUST', 'be', 'preserved.Great', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'realistic', 'last', 'detail', 'Very', 'well', 'researched', 'documented.Drawbacks', 'Price', 'ai', ""n't"", 'bargain', 'bin', 'product', 'yet', 'get', 'lot', 'what', 'pay', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'war', ""n't"", 'pretty', ""'m"", 'glad', 'producers', 'opted', 'real', 'rather', 'sterile', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'handicam', 'view', 'vertigo', 'feeling', 'when', 'view', 'least', 'make', 'own', 'conclusions', 'long', 'best', 'viewed', 'one', 'sitting', 'hard', 'do', 'time.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lump-in-your-throat', 'misty-eyed', 'feeling', 'film', 'check', 'heart', 'make', 'sure', 'still', 'have', 'one', 'Make', 'tradition', 'watch', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'minimum', 'Honor', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'possible', 'be', 'here', 'first', 'place', 'let', 'alone', 'see', 'relative', 'freedom', 'God', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'veterans', 'war', 'still', 'fighting', 'today', 'country', 'sake', 'others', 'ideals', 'freedom', 'democracy']",N/A

711622,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B00006C7G9,The Guardian,"[2, 2]","This 6-disk-in-tin-box Blu-Ray edition of possibly the greatest TV drama series ever made is the one to go for. Five disks each contain two episodes of the series and the sixth disk of extras includes extended personal interviews with surviving members of Easy Company to give the viewer the opportunity to appreciate how character-defining and life-changing were the experiences these guys went through in WW2, and how superb was Spielberg's and Hanks' casting for the series in managing to get the actors exactly right. Some even look like the real men they portray (Frank John Hughes looks so like the real Bill Guarnere it's actually spooky, and all surviving members of Easy attest to the fact that British actor Damian Lewis's portrayal of Dick Winters captures the understated integrity, intelligence and leadership qualities of their real-life CO to perfection).There's little to say about this epic, landmark drama series that hasn't already been said. It's essentially a true story based on the real-life recollections of surviving members of Easy Company through their paratrooper-training in Georgia through 1942, to their deployment to England in 1943 in preparation for finally jumping into action with the 101st Airborne on the night of 5-6 June 1944 as part of the first wave of the allied invasion of Normandy, through their subsequent actions in France, Holland (Market Garden), holding Bastogne against the Waffen SS during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, to finally confronting the horrors of a Nazi death camp in Germany and occupying Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in the Alps in May 1945. The drama is gripping, the action sequences utterly realistic and viscerally real, the character portraits complex, the dialogue rich, clich&eacute;-free and tinged with irony and humor. Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and the entire Dreamworks production company excelled in every way with this series and produced a kind of masterpiece which it is difficult to imagine might ever be equalled. The seriousness of the subject matter is treated with respect, and every aspect of the writing, casting, direction (each episode has a different director but you'd hardly notice, so seamless is the production and the continuity) and editing is flawless.The Blu-Ray edition looks and sounds superb, and brings an even sharper realism to the original TV series. It's very nicely presented with the quality befitting this superlative piece of work. Since Spielberg proved with ""Schindler's List"" in 1993 that he could make grown-up films for a grown-up audience he has evolved into a serious, mature and intelligent film-maker of the highest calibre, and BOB may prove to be his crowning achievement in a lifetime of first-class work (though ""Pacific"" might run a very close second).BOB is not just first-class, genre-defining TV drama: it's also a fitting, respectful testimony to a generation not just of Americans but of all allied citizen-soldiers who fought and eventually won the greatest war in human history against a ruthless and totalitarian enemy who needed to be defeated: the most obvious and probably the only acknowledged ""just"" war of the past century, undiminished from the perspective of our more fortunate but generally less principled times where current issues of good and evil are far more opaque.Respect, Easy Company. Spielberg's epic may cause your names to live forever, as they should.PS 11 January 2011: just heard the news today that the real Dick Winters died on 2 January, aged 91.

Though the entire collection is some 90 bucks, keep in mind that this is definately worth it for just the battle scenes alone.Now I personally like to see the relationships between the soldiers rather than seeing guys getting shot or wounded in battle. It makes me miss the guys even more if they are shot because I sort of feel like they are someone I know who lives across the street from me or is my best friend.The main story focusses on men of Easy Company, who are paratroopers of the 101st airborne who fight in Germany during World War 2. While most of the disks are taken place during the war, I found myself liking the first and second disks the best, as the men trained for months before the war and then actually got to jump right before D-Day.David Schwimmer also makes an appearance as their drill sergant, who seemed to relish the fact that he could make their lives a living miserable hell if he really wanted to. One scene is that the cafeterias serve spaghetti one day, only to have a heavy duty run up several hills right after. A lot of guys lost their lunches in the following scenes.Anyway, each disk has their own storylines in them. From the first at bootcamp, to the sixth or seventh when they were entrenched in snow and forests outside several german occupied towns.Now some of the camera scenes may be a little hard to follow [the camera angles go up down, back and forth] but I soon got used to it and actually found it to add more to the suspense because the men were probably too distracted by the bombing to focus on the surrounding trees in detail.Now I really liked the acting, I thought the guys from New York were great, lots of talk about respect and earning it was in here, and i really respected what these guys did for each other, and for others. I really got to liking these guys more and more.All in all, this is probably the best story about bonding and wartime. The Men of Easy Company, in real life, even tell their experiences in war right before each episode starts, so it was cool to see them in real life.I would definately reccommend this, and if you don't have the money, well Christmas and Hanukah are in a few weeks, get my point?",5,They really hit the jackpot with this series.....,1098489600,"10 23, 2004",2004,2293,"['Band', 'Brothers', 'one', 'best', 'movies/series', 'WW2', 'personally', 'feel', 'out', 'stores', 'nowadays', 'entire', 'collection', '90', 'bucks', 'keep', 'mind', 'definately', 'worth', 'just', 'battle', 'scenes', 'alone.Now', 'personally', 'like', 'see', 'relationships', 'soldiers', 'rather', 'seeing', 'guys', 'getting', 'shot', 'wounded', 'battle', 'miss', 'guys', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'shot', 'sort', 'feel', 'are', 'someone', 'know', 'who', 'street', 'best', 'friend.The', 'main', 'story', 'focusses', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'who', 'are', 'paratroopers', '101st', 'airborne', 'who', 'fight', 'Germany', 'World', 'War', '2', 'most', 'disks', 'are', 'taken', 'place', 'war', 'found', 'liking', 'first', 'second', 'disks', 'best', 'men', 'trained', 'months', 'war', 'then', 'actually', 'got', 'jump', 'right', 'D-Day.David', 'Schwimmer', 'also', 'appearance', 'drill', 'sergant', 'who', 'seemed', 'relish', 'fact', 'could', 'make', 'lives', 'living', 'miserable', 'hell', 'really', 'wanted', 'One', 'scene', 'cafeterias', 'serve', 'spaghetti', 'one', 'day', 'only', 'have', 'heavy', 'duty', 'run', 'up', 'several', 'hills', 'right', 'lot', 'guys', 'lost', 'lunches', 'following', 'scenes.Anyway', 'disk', 'own', 'storylines', 'first', 'bootcamp', 'sixth', 'seventh', 'when', 'were', 'entrenched', 'snow', 'forests', 'several', 'german', 'occupied', 'towns.Now', 'camera', 'scenes', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'hard', 'follow', 'camera', 'go', 'up', 'down', 'back', 'forth', ']', 'soon', 'got', 'used', 'actually', 'found', 'add', 'more', 'suspense', 'men', 'were', 'probably', 'too', 'distracted', 'bombing', 'focus', 'surrounding', 'trees', 'detail.Now', 'really', 'liked', 'acting', 'thought', 'guys', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'great', 'lots', 'talk', 'respect', 'earning', 'was', 'here', 'i', 'really', 'respected', 'what', 'guys', 'did', 'other', 'others', 'really', 'got', 'liking', 'guys', 'more', 'more.All', 'probably', 'best', 'story', 'bonding', 'wartime', 'Men', 'Easy', 'Company', 'real', 'life', 'even', 'tell', 'experiences', 'war', 'right', 'episode', 'was', 'cool', 'see', 'real', 'life.I', 'would', 'definately', 'reccommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'well', 'Christmas', 'Hanukah', 'are', 'few', 'weeks', 'get', 'point']",N/A

711641,A31EZZ14E0IIME,B00006C7G9,Tom Harrison,"[3, 4]","Band of Brothers is an emotional look at the World War 2 experiences of the men from E Company, 2nd Battalion 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. Over 10 episodes, the men grow from young recruits training in Toccoa, Georgia to soldiers on the frontline of some of the Allies' most crucial battles.The stories which unfold do not set out to make every man a hero who saved the world singlehandedly, but rather as human beings who came together as a group and battled against the odds. Each episode is seen through the eyes of a different soldier, everyone from Easy Company's unquestionable leader 'Dick' Winters to a field medic to a paratrooper separated from his battalion. The stories are touching and emotional but not to 'Hollywood' that they lose authenticity.The men upon which the show is based, the real veterans of E Company, provide interviews in the opening of each part of the series, giving insight into how the group really felt. Band of Brothers is not a show written by another big-shot whose closest encounter with war is through the nightly news.One cannot recommend this series enough. To watch it is to pay homage to those young men who created the freedom we have today, to respect and be grateful for what they did.For those who appreciate that war is not all guts and glory, or who respect what the men of the WW2 generation did, Band of Brothers is a brilliantly written and produced series worthy of 5-star status.The DVD boxset is brilliant, with documentaries and interviews to complement a perfect audio-visual transfer. It is complete with both Dolby Digital and DTS soundtracks, is presented in 16x9 widescreen format, and includes subtitles in nearly every language imaginable.

All of the actors were put through a mini-boot camp and were instructed to remain in character for the duration of the filming.  The end result is that they are believable in every way.  They easily become US military personnel of the era.  Each of the actors adopts the persona of their real-life counterpart and become that person.  By remaining in character, they effortlessly respond to their name and convey the feeling that they are actually who they portray.  I read the book and much of the dialogue stems from the book.  One can connect to each of the main characters.  It was interesting to note that many of the actors are British, but pull off an American accent very nicely.All of the battle scenes are meticulously researched and draw the viewer in.  In particular, the scenes set during the siege of Bastogne where the men are holding the line in the Ardennes forest. They are so realistic that I could feel the cold and experience the privations the men were experiencing, although many of the scenes were shot on a sound stage.  My favorite battle scenes however, were of the D-Day landings and the attack on the German Artillery Battery at Brecourt Manor.  I was privileged to travel to Normandy a few years ago and went to Brecourt Manor and the story was retold by the current resident who is the son of the actual family who lived there at the time.  There is a small monument dedicated to the members of Easy Company who attacked the manor and destroyed the guns that were firing on Utah Beach.As I watched the series, I became more acquainted with each of the characters and was saddened each time one was killed in battle or because of some weird accident.  You cannot help but notice that each of the actual members of the 501st ""Easy Company"" were proud to have served and while it was a terrifying experience for many, to a man, they would not have missed it for anything.  They fought for each other and bonded as brothers.  I felt the loss of their comrades as conveyed by each of the actual members in their interviews for the series.  I think this series does a great honor to the men of the 101st Airborne and all of the soldiers who fought during WWII.

For example, one episode set in Bastogne is done from the perspective of a medic. Another episode, after that, is from the perspective of Webster, who missed Bastogne because he was in the hospital. The other men resented his not having shared in their misery during those cold winter months in the trenches, being blown to bits. But he shows himself worthy on &#34;The Last Patrol.&#34;It's a great series. The only feature film that I think comes close to the grit and realism of Band Of Brothers is Battleground, from 1949. It, too, is shown from the perspective of the average soldier, not the leaders. That's what makes this series so unique - most war films are written from the perspective of the leadership or the historian because they're based on the memoirs of various military leaders. Most people want to know what it was like for the average Joe.Also, the production values are through the roof. This is probably one of the best mini-series ever made.

711682,AP3B615GM191G,B00006C7G9,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Right off the bat, I just want to comment that Band of Brothers is the best dramatic interpretation of World War II events that I have ever seen (think ""Saving Private Ryan"", but for ten entire episodes).  The basic premise of the show is following the 101st Airborne Regiment (a section of the 506th Parachute Regiment) from its entrance into the war (""basic"" training) to events such as D-Day, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and eventually capturing Hitler's famed ""Eagle's Nest"" hideout and symbolically ending the European campaign.  There are two main reasons why I believe this cinematic masterpiece is the best of all-time:First, is the realism of the war-action scenes.  Whether it was the visual spectacle of hundreds of paratroopers floating down into France on D-Day, the intense street-to-street fighting that was often needed to capture certain landmarks, or the trees exploding from German shells in the woods nearby Bastogne as American soldiers dived for cover, the sheer scope of the cinematography is remarkable and will leave you feeling as if you have the slightest comprehension of what being there ""in the flesh"" must have been like.  I remember when ""Saving Private Ryan"" was released and many film-goers commented on how realistic the D-Day action was...well, Band of Brothers sustains that realism throughout multiple war events.  A sight to behold, at the very least.However, what really makes Band of Brothers special is its dramatic focus on the men of Easy Company (the 101st).  The show starts right from the beginning, with the men receiving the toughest training the army has to offer.  Grueling runs up and down the infamous ""Curahee"" mountain effectively weeded out the best of the best and essentially shaped Easy Co. into perhaps the finest fighting force in the entire U.S. Service.  The bond that those men achieved during that training carries over into their combat experience (starting with their drop behind enemy lines on D-Day), and makes for a very personal dramatic experience, as each man really did think of the guy next to him as a brother of sorts.  What really impressed me, though, was how each episode seemed to focus on a different dramatic angle to the story.  A few that stand out in my mind are...-How Easy Co. handles the incompetence (leading to lives being needlessly lost in one case) of not one but two different commanders throughout the war.-The internal struggle of Frank Winters, who initially leads Easy Co. but eventually moves up in rank.  Though he is honored by the promotion, he also is a bit uncomfortable in what he perceives as ""leaving"" his men in the heat of war.-The devastation that was wreaked in the forests surrounding Bastogne, where more American soldiers (without proper winter clothing) died because of sickness and ""trenchfoot"" (essentially a completely frozen foot) than due to enemy shelling.  Perhaps the saddest moment of the series comes when one Lt. sees his two best friends get their legs blown off trying to help others find cover.  The Lt. suffers a nervous breakdown and is never quite the same afterwards.-The level of shock in the hearts and minds of Easy Co. when they stumble across their first concentration camp and liberate it.Overall, Band of Brothers will both shock you with the intensity of its war scenes and make you think long and hard about the heavy toll that warfare takes on the human soul.  A special treat comes at the tail end of the series, when actually living veterans of Easy Co. appear on camera and tell their experiences firsthand.For anyone even remotely interested in war drama, this series will blow you away.  Also, if I were an instructor teaching the effects of WWII, I can guarantee that I would use multiple clips from this series.",5,A Cinematic and Dramatic Experience You Will Never Forget,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,3784,"['Right', 'bat', 'just', 'want', 'comment', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'best', 'dramatic', 'interpretation', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'events', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'ten', 'entire', 'episodes', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'following', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Regiment', 'section', '506th', 'Parachute', 'Regiment', 'entrance', 'war', 'basic', 'training', 'events', 'such', 'D-Day', 'Operation', 'Market', 'Garden', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'eventually', 'capturing', 'Hitler', 'famed', 'Eagle', 'Nest', 'hideout', 'symbolically', 'ending', 'European', 'campaign', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'why', 'believe', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'best', 'all-time', 'First', 'realism', 'war-action', 'scenes', 'was', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'hundreds', 'paratroopers', 'floating', 'down', 'France', 'D-Day', 'intense', 'street-to-street', 'fighting', 'was', 'often', 'needed', 'capture', 'certain', 'landmarks', 'trees', 'exploding', 'German', 'shells', 'woods', 'nearby', 'Bastogne', 'American', 'soldiers', 'dived', 'cover', 'sheer', 'scope', 'cinematography', 'remarkable', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'have', 'slightest', 'comprehension', 'what', 'being', 'flesh', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'remember', 'when', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'was', 'released', 'many', 'film-goers', 'commented', 'how', 'realistic', 'D-Day', 'action', 'was', 'well', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'realism', 'multiple', 'war', 'events', 'sight', 'behold', 'very', 'least.However', 'what', 'really', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'special', 'dramatic', 'focus', 'men', 'Easy', 'Company', '101st', 'show', 'right', 'beginning', 'men', 'receiving', 'toughest', 'training', 'army', 'offer', 'Grueling', 'infamous', 'Curahee', 'mountain', 'effectively', 'weeded', 'out', 'best', 'best', 'essentially', 'shaped', 'Easy', 'Co.', 'perhaps', 'finest', 'fighting', 'force', 'entire', 'U.S.', 'Service', 'bond', 'men', 'achieved', 'training', 'combat', 'experience', 'starting', 'drop', 'enemy', 'lines', 'D-Day', 'very', 'personal', 'dramatic', 'experience', 'man', 'really', 'did', 'think', 'guy', 'next', 'brother', 'sorts', 'What', 'really', 'impressed', 'though', 'was', 'how', 'episode', 'seemed', 'focus', 'different', 'dramatic', 'angle', 'story', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'mind', 'are', '-How', 'Easy', 'Co.', 'incompetence', 'leading', 'lives', 'being', 'needlessly', 'lost', 'one', 'case', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'different', 'commanders', 'war.-The', 'internal', 'struggle', 'Frank', 'Winters', 'who', 'initially', 'Easy', 'Co.', 'eventually', 'up', 'rank', 'honored', 'promotion', 'also', 'bit', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'leaving', 'men', 'heat', 'war.-The', 'devastation', 'was', 'wreaked', 'forests', 'surrounding', 'Bastogne', 'where', 'more', 'American', 'soldiers', 'proper', 'winter', 'clothing', 'died', 'sickness', 'trenchfoot', 'essentially', 'completely', 'frozen', 'foot', 'due', 'enemy', 'shelling', 'Perhaps', 'saddest', 'moment', 'series', 'when', 'one', 'Lt.', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'get', 'legs', 'blown', 'off', 'trying', 'help', 'others', 'find', 'cover', 'Lt.', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'never', 'quite', 'same', 'afterwards.-The', 'level', 'shock', 'hearts', 'minds', 'Easy', 'Co.', 'when', 'stumble', 'first', 'concentration', 'camp', 'liberate', 'it.Overall', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'will', 'shock', 'intensity', 'war', 'scenes', 'make', 'think', 'long', 'hard', 'heavy', 'toll', 'warfare', 'human', 'soul', 'special', 'treat', 'tail', 'end', 'series', 'when', 'actually', 'living', 'veterans', 'Easy', 'Co.', 'appear', 'camera', 'tell', 'experiences', 'firsthand.For', 'anyone', 'even', 'remotely', 'interested', 'war', 'drama', 'series', 'will', 'blow', 'away', 'Also', 'were', 'instructor', 'teaching', 'effects', 'WWII', 'can', 'guarantee', 'would', 'use', 'multiple', 'clips', 'series']",N/A
