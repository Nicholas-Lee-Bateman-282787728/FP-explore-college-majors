FROM WITHIN touches on an all-too-familiar plot that is filled with nothing beyond your average characters, yet it remains fast-paced and entertaining from beginning to end. Phedon Papamichael sets an ominous mood prefacing each attack in preparation for the shocks and thrills to come. He has enlisted a serviceable cast led by Elizabeth Rice as Lindsay, who pulls us through some of Thomas Dekker's weaker moments as the typical teen outsider, Aidan.

1226475,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001P9N99O,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 10]","""From Within"" isn't all that successful as a horror movie, or even as a regular movie. It is, however, often times very interesting in its approach, shifting back and forth between a commentary on religious tolerance and a vengeance fable that pulls no punches regardless of denomination. It's interesting and problematic, because by the end of the film, the Godless pagans look just as guilty as the fundamentalist Christians. In other words, I no longer could determine which side represented good and which side represented evil. Maybe that's the point of this film: That religion is dangerous no matter what god you happen to pray to. Or maybe it has nothing to do with attacking any particular religion; maybe it's just a way to make the overused idea of supernatural forces wreaking havoc seem original.Whatever. What I know for sure is that, even though ""From Within"" had some genuinely engaging moments, it still didn't quite live up to its potential. Consider the fact that it takes place one of those small Southern towns where the vast majority take faith in God a little too seriously; while effective as a plot device, the truth is that we've seen too many horror films about communities with frightening mob-like mentalities. There's also the fact that religion is generalized to the point of turning virtually everyone into a caricature. The only neutral character is a teenager named Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice), who seems to recognize that, in spite of her own faith, people should be allowed to worship as they see fit.The story: A string of deaths are plaguing the God-fearing town of Grovestown. At first, they all appear to be a part of a suicide pact; it begins when a teenager named Sean (Shiloh Fernandez) blows his brains out right in front of his girlfriend, Natalie (Rumor Willis), who later kills herself in her father's shop right before her father hangs himself. As more people die, the townsfolk begin to fear that it's not a pact, but a curse. Here enters a brooding teenager named Aidan (Thomas Dekker), the son of a woman who practiced witchcraft before her untimely death; when he's physically beaten by Lindsay's pious boyfriend, Dylan (Kelly Blatz), Lindsay takes pity on Aidan and takes him home. It there she learns more about his mother, whose demise may have been at the hands of extremist vigilantes seeking revenge for the death of a young boy.The character development is interesting, if a little one-dimensional. Take Lindsay's stepmother, Trish (Laura Allen), an alcoholic who seems detached from everything. When she's not passed out on the couch in front of the TV, she throws herself at her boyfriend, Roy (Adam Goldberg), an angry kind of guy whose wardrobe always consists of dirty undershirts and baseball caps. Dylan's father, Pastor Joe (Steven Culp), is introduced giving a sermon, and we immediately sense that every word coming out of his mouth is laced with hypocrisy. At the other end of the religious spectrum, there's Aidan's cousin, Sadie (Margo Harshman), who deeply distrusts Lindsay simply for being an outsider. She only wears black, and she can never speak to anyone without copping a seriously off-putting attitude. She supplies one of the films best moments of humor; as Lindsay and Aidan talk seriously about what's happening in town, Sadie sits at a piano, hitting dramatic chords.I've said plenty about the characters, and that may not be a good sign because this is supposed to be a horror movie. What about the horror, anyway? There are some great atmospheric moments during the suicide scenes, in which the victims see ghastly apparitions of themselves. This obviously plays into the film's title, suggestive of the inner demons we all have. Exactly what brought on this curse is something I leave for you to find out. I will say that it isn't all that surprising given the vindictive nature of the story.That brings me to the disturbing ending, which is satisfying in that twisted, downbeat, horror-movie way that can't easily be described. I use the word ""satisfying"" reluctantly, mostly because I didn't like the fact that I felt any sense of satisfaction. It's not a pleasant ending--it's ugly and mean-spirited, and it actually made me rethink how I felt about certain characters. Then again, maybe that was the intended effect. Director Phedon Papamichael seems to have labored under the belief that duplicity wears many masks, none more convincing than that of righteousness. If that was the message of the film, I can't help but question why it had to be sent in the guise of a horror story. A simple parable would have been just fine. (No, I'm not making comparisons to ""Doubt,"" which is anything but a horror film, although it is worth noting that it was able to send the exact same message without resorting to supernatural occurrences and grizzly death scenes.) In spite of its flaws, I'm well aware that ""From Within"" was made for a very select horror-friendly audience, and I have no doubt that they will respond to this film.",3,The Wicked Will Be

I'm getting tired of these horror religious plots that go nowhere. Sure, there is a stunning cast, who tried to the best with little they had to work with. The basic plot is that there are several suicides in a small town, in which the church members believe that a deceased devil worshipper's son is involved with the deaths. The actually truth is that the son and his brother cast a suicide spell because the churchgoers had murdered their innocent mother.There were no surprises for me as I could clearly tell who the next victim was. I have to admit that I fell asleep for twenty minutes and I don't think I missed a single thing.

1226477,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B001P9N99O,Elisabeth,"[3, 5]","Many of the scenes in this movie I've seen elsewhere.  For example, like the movie ""The Ring"", you have a young woman with long hair covering her face and days being counted down to build suspense.  However, in ""The Ring"", that countdown made sense since victims were only given 7 days to live, but in this movie, the countdown is unnecessary and gimmicky.Also taken from other horror movies is the satanic whisperings of ""Susperia"", mirror image tricks of ""Poltergeist 2"", and spooky mannequins in a dark room of ""I Know What You Did Last  Summer"".  And of course, no horror movie would be complete without someone running in the woods and tripping onto the ground.When this movie wasn't copying other movies, it was hitting you over the head that Christians are all hypocrites.  For instance, you have the mother who preachers to her daughter about purity while getting drunk and bedding a loose man.  She wears a cross around her neck while watching a striptease workout.There's no subtlety here, but there is hypocrisy in this message.  This story preaches against stereotyping others while simultaneously stereotyping all Christians as ignorant zealots.  There's no other sane Christians in this film to balance it out.And finally, the acting is lackluster and amateurish -- especially the acting by the redheaded twins from America's Next Top Model.Overall, I didn't find this movie scary at all.  I found the acting to be mediocre, the messages too in-your-face, and the pacing to be too slow (I almost fell asleep a few times).",2,"A blend of recycled horror, hypocritical messages, and bad acting",1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,1535,"['Many', 'scenes', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'example', 'movie', 'Ring', 'have', 'young', 'woman', 'long', 'hair', 'covering', 'face', 'days', 'being', 'counted', 'build', 'suspense', 'However', 'Ring', 'countdown', 'made', 'sense', 'victims', 'were', 'only', 'given', '7', 'days', 'live', 'movie', 'countdown', 'unnecessary', 'gimmicky.Also', 'taken', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'satanic', 'whisperings', 'Susperia', 'mirror', 'image', 'tricks', 'Poltergeist', '2', 'spooky', 'mannequins', 'dark', 'room', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'course', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'complete', 'someone', 'running', 'woods', 'tripping', 'ground.When', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'copying', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'hitting', 'head', 'Christians', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'instance', 'have', 'mother', 'who', 'daughter', 'purity', 'getting', 'drunk', 'bedding', 'loose', 'man', 'cross', 'neck', 'watching', 'striptease', 'subtlety', 'here', 'hypocrisy', 'message', 'story', 'stereotyping', 'others', 'simultaneously', 'stereotyping', 'Christians', 'ignorant', 'zealots', 'other', 'sane', 'Christians', 'film', 'balance', 'finally', 'acting', 'lackluster', 'amateurish', 'especially', 'acting', 'redheaded', 'twins', 'America', 'Next', 'Top', 'Model.Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'scary', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'mediocre', 'messages', 'too', 'in-your-face', 'pacing', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'few', 'times']",From Within

The film is a cross between ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Grudge,"" with elements of revenge and a curse.  The movie takes place in a small town, where so-called Christian zealots hold cult-like sway over many of the people, with one notable exception: a family of wiccans (for lack of a better term).  In an event prior to the start of the movie, a woman was burned alive because the religious townspeople suspected her - without any real evidence - in the death of a child.  Events are soon set in motion, resulting in a curse being placed upon the town for their evil and unjust act.  The film is really worth a watch, and the end has a really good twist!The acting isn't too bad for a lower-budge movie.  Thomas Dekker, from ""The Sarah Conner Chronicles,"" is one of the main actors in the film.There are some stereotypes (ignorant, hypocritical, over-zealous Christians as well as the ever persecuted wiccans) used in the film, but I don't think that they detract from the film too much.

Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 3]","From Within has a pretty standard premise: small town with a dark secret unjustly murders a woman for witchcraft, witch takes revenge, townsfolk fall apart as their dark secret is unveiled and foolish teenagers pay the price.From Within plays with preconceived notions of who is wrong and right in the debate over fundamentalism by sprinkling forthright characters with dark secrets...and dark characters with dark secrets too.  Nobody's innocent.  Not Aidan (Thomas Dekker, Mr. John Connor himself) the goth pretty boy whose brother Sean (Shiloh Fernandez) committed suicide in front of his girlfriend (Rumor Willis), nor Dylan (Kelly Blatz) the son of a preacher man.  With Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice) in the middle, they form a peculiar love triangle that's not particularly convincing, as Dylan comes off as nothing more than a pious robot.  It's hard to conceive that he and Elizabeth had a relationship at all.The other characters, including Lindsay's boozy stepmother Trish (Laura Allen), her redneck boyfriend (Roy Adam) and the always-smiling Pastor Joe (Steven Culp) are all just about as awful as you might expect.  Christian fundamentalism is portrayed as just as ugly as alternative religions like Wicca.  It's not the mask of religion that's the problem, according to director Phedon Papamichael, it's what people are really like on the inside.  And with the exception of Lindsay, everyone is petty, vindictive, and self-centered.But this is a horror film with a curse at its center, and From Within doesn't disappoint.  The ghosts all appear as dead, animated doppelgangers of their future victims, providing a fun ""guess how they're gonna die"" game for the audience that has echoes inFinal Destination. The deaths all look like suicides, as the curse causes the victim to harm herself. There are two particularly inspired moments of creepiness, including a scene in a bathroom mirror and one confusing a bottle of whiskey with something a little stronger.From Within hits all the Japanese-horror highlights, including a viral curse, creepy girls with long hair concealing their faces, and encounters that are just as weird as they are frightening. The first living person to reach the most recent dead victim catches it.  This has to be the first social media curse.But what really propels From Within beyond the usual ghost story fare is the ending. Nihilistic and unflinching in its damning portrayal of everyone in the town, the director shows no mercy.  While that might not make for a happy ending, it sure makes for one heck of a twist.Not quite as good asThe Ringbut certainly better thanSeamstress, From Within is a worthy installment in American-style J-horror.",4,A worthy installment for J-horror fans,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,2683,"['Within', 'pretty', 'standard', 'premise', 'small', 'town', 'dark', 'secret', 'unjustly', 'woman', 'witchcraft', 'witch', 'revenge', 'townsfolk', 'fall', 'apart', 'dark', 'secret', 'unveiled', 'foolish', 'teenagers', 'pay', 'price.From', 'Within', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'who', 'wrong', 'right', 'debate', 'fundamentalism', 'sprinkling', 'forthright', 'characters', 'dark', 'secrets', 'dark', 'characters', 'dark', 'secrets', 'too', 'Nobody', 'innocent', 'Not', 'Aidan', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Connor', 'goth', 'pretty', 'boy', 'brother', 'Sean', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'committed', 'suicide', 'front', 'girlfriend', 'Rumor', 'Willis', 'Dylan', 'Kelly', 'Blatz', 'son', 'preacher', 'man', 'Lindsay', 'Elizabeth', 'Rice', 'middle', 'form', 'peculiar', 'love', 'triangle', 'not', 'particularly', 'convincing', 'Dylan', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'pious', 'robot', 'hard', 'conceive', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'relationship', 'all.The', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Lindsay', 'boozy', 'stepmother', 'Trish', 'Laura', 'Allen', 'redneck', 'boyfriend', 'Roy', 'Adam', 'always-smiling', 'Pastor', 'Joe', 'Steven', 'Culp', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'awful', 'might', 'expect', 'Christian', 'fundamentalism', 'portrayed', 'as', 'just', 'as', 'ugly', 'alternative', 'religions', 'Wicca', 'not', 'mask', 'religion', 'problem', 'according', 'director', 'Phedon', 'Papamichael', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'inside', 'exception', 'Lindsay', 'everyone', 'petty', 'vindictive', 'self-centered.But', 'horror', 'film', 'curse', 'center', 'Within', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'dead', 'animated', 'doppelgangers', 'future', 'victims', 'providing', 'fun', 'guess', 'how', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'game', 'audience', 'echoes', 'inFinal', 'Destination', 'deaths', 'look', 'suicides', 'curse', 'victim', 'harm', 'are', 'two', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'moments', 'creepiness', 'including', 'scene', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'one', 'confusing', 'bottle', 'whiskey', 'something', 'little', 'stronger.From', 'hits', 'Japanese-horror', 'highlights', 'including', 'viral', 'curse', 'creepy', 'girls', 'long', 'hair', 'concealing', 'encounters', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'weird', 'are', 'frightening', 'first', 'living', 'person', 'reach', 'most', 'recent', 'dead', 'victim', 'catches', 'be', 'first', 'social', 'media', 'curse.But', 'what', 'really', 'Within', 'usual', 'ghost', 'story', 'fare', 'ending', 'Nihilistic', 'unflinching', 'damning', 'portrayal', 'everyone', 'town', 'director', 'mercy', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'happy', 'ending', 'sure', 'one', 'heck', 'twist.Not', 'quite', 'good', 'asThe', 'Ringbut', 'certainly', 'better', 'thanSeamstress', 'Within', 'worthy', 'installment', 'American-style', 'J-horror']",From Within

Elizabeth Rice stars as Lindsay, a young girl living in an ultra conservative Christian town.  A wave of mysterious suicides starts to plague the town, and it soon becomes apparent that vengeance is being wrecked upon the town by otherworldly forces, drawn from something terrible that happened years before.  What makes From Within interesting enough is the examination it gives of the small-minded, Christian-based town it takes place in, but it really doesn't do too much with it.  It also doesn't make the kind of use that it could have with a cast that includes Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' Thomas Dekker, as well as small roles for Adam Goldberg, Jared Harris, Laura Allen, Steven Culp, and Rumer Willis; of which only Goldberg does anything remotely memorable.  The moments that are supposed to be suspenseful fall flat, and the film's conclusion only ends up throwing one twist after another at the viewer.

Mix guilt with self-righteousness, power and influence and injustice usually follows. However, in this wonderful little film, vengeance has a supernatural advantage which seems to be correcting a serious crime that has been covered up. The problem, which often happens with vengeance, is that the innocent get caught up in the fray and also suffer. As with most religious people they refuse to believe that their faith, leaders, church, or denomination could do any wrong, creating a staunch resistance against any justice or change. That lunacy also allows the guilty to go free ...sometimes.Why do people pander and cater to religious beliefs? After all it is the religious who must ""prove"" the gibberish they spout. After centuries of blather...""god created everything in six days and he will burn you in hell... blah, blah, blah."" We've all heard it, but why do people still accommodate or waste a moment of time with something that is provably wrong? With literally tens of thousands of religions, not even counting the thousands that no longer exist, at each others (and non-believers) throats. Doesn't that indict god in some way? Even if it is just to accuse god of not clarifying who or what, he, she, or it is, and wants. The word clarify originates from Middle English meaning to make pure and clean. Do you think a god would have a problem with that? It seems like it would save a lot of lives and end false-worship.

He did in 2008 with &lt;em>From Within&lt;/em> which contains, to date, the only halfway decent script penned by Brad Keene (who was also responsible for the horrific &lt;em>The Gravedancers&lt;/em>). Not a bad little film, quite possibly the best of the lot from After Dark Horrorfest 3 (I still haven't seen a couple of the entries, but it's far superior to the five I have), but still has some issues that rank it as a film probably best left to hardcore fans of low-budget horror.Plot: as we open, two rebellious teens who live in a small town in Maryland, Sean (&lt;em>Deadgirl&lt;/em>'s Shiloh Farnandez in an uncredited role) and Natalie (&lt;em>Hostage&lt;/em>'s Rumer Willis), necking in a secluded spot. You get the idea you know where this is going, at least until Sean kills himself. Natalie, understandably traumatized, rushes back into town and into her father (&lt;em>b.Monkey&lt;/em>'s Jared Harris)'s dress shop, babbling that she's being followed by a strange woman. Within moments, she, too, has killed herself, and this is just the beginning of a rash of suicides in this town. While the rest of the populace girds their loins with the armor of faith, Aidan (&lt;em>A Nightmare on Elm St.&lt;/em>'s Thomas Dekker), Sean's younger brother, and his friend Lindsay (&lt;em>My Dog Skip&lt;/em>'s Elizabeth Rice) try to figure out what's actually going on, and whether it may have supernatural origins. Lindsay's problem is that, unlike Aidan and Sean, she was raised in the conservative-Christian atmosphere of the town--is, in fact, the girlfriend of the son of the local megachurch's preacher ( a great, sleazy-to-the-max role for TV character actor Stephen Culp)--and she is torn between the town's belief that God will provide and the evidence of her own senses.It's got so much potential, and in some ways, it delivers. Dekker and Rice are good enough actors, and there's a solid chemistry between them that taps into the love-triangle subplot before you even know it's there. And while fundamentalist Christians are almost too easy a target for any plot dealing with corruption, blasphemy, etc., Papamichael and Roy keep enough Christians in the plot on the good side of the coin to remind us that they're not attempting to tar the entire town with the same brush (a subtlety that, it seems, was lost on a number of fundamentalist commenters on IMDB, who attacked the film for doing exactly that).On the other hand, the longer the movie goes, the more ludicrous the premise gets, and pieces of it seem to wander in for no reason. Specifically, the character of Sadie (&lt;em>Keith&lt;/em>'s Margo Harshman), Aidan and Sean's cousin--what is she even &lt;em>doing&lt;/em> in this movie, except possibly providing a little more shading to the grey areas by providing a non-angelic (pardon the pun) pagan character to mirror the preacher? Problem is, she's not a weighty enough character to do so, leaving her being extremely annoying with no reason for being in this movie. Gah.In other words, not a great movie, not an awful one.

These are the questions asked by Phedon Papamichael in his new film From Within. While the film does tread some well-worn territory, the movie is atmospheric enough - and the performances are good enough - for the viewer to be able to overlook the tired tropes and enjoy a solid independent horror film.From Within begins with a suicide, followed immediately by the death of the person who witnessed it, followed by many more deaths. The residents of the ultra-religious town begin to suspect Aidan (Thomas Dekker), the son of the woman they killed for practicing witchcraft. But who's really to blame for the string of deaths, and what price must be paid in order to stop them.As a veteran of the last three ""8 Films to Die For"" festivals, I wasn't expecting much from this film. The annual horror festival is synonymous with boring, derivative crap. You know it's sad when the best film to come out of the previous two outings was Nightmare Man, a C-grade schlock fest saved by corny acting and Tiffany Sheppis' [...]. So you can understand my trepidation coming into this movie - especially after having the derivative Dying Breed a few weeks ago. Luckily, I was in good hands.From Within begins shakily. It's difficult to decipher what's going on at first. The film simply transitions from one deadly set piece to the next without any apparent connection. Only when ""final girl"" Lindsay (Elizabeth Rice) decides to befriend the gothy-looking Aidan do the pieces of the plot begin to come together. Besides the foibles with the plot, other things fall a little flat. I  wasn't too bothered by the whole people-getting-killed-by-evil-doppelgangers aspect of the story, but I felt it would have been creepier if we couldn't see the force killing these people.Despite the flaws, the film does a lot right. The religious fanatics weren't too over the top. You could definitely imagine these nut-jobs living in a red state near you (hell, there are plenty of them in Arizona). Also, the ending was note-for-note perfect. The film's credit sequence - a grim version of the apocalypse - is creepier than most of the horror films that came out in 2008.As another entry in the horror genre, From Within is a competent and engaging movie that's just a little rough around the edges. As an entry in the ""8 Films to Die For"" library, it's a near masterpiece.

The first is the fact that, chilling as it is, the bulk of the films scares are lifted almost directly from other films.  You have the creepy girl with the hair covering her face, or the girl appearing in the TV, or the cheap After Effects shot of the sudden black-eyed demon face.  The film also suffers from having THE BROKEN in the same festival this year, both films drawing heavily on mirrors and reflections attacking people.  But, though these effects are lifted from other films, they are still employed very well here - the movie delivers plenty of great creep-out moments, even if they are familiar.The only other issue I have is in the broadly stereotypical portrayal of extreme religion.  For starters, the writers don't seem to have much of a grasp on what religious group they are portraying.  At first, it would seem to be the evangelistic mega-church with its ""God is here to bless you"" mentality.  But, early on it is clear that they want these to be ""witch hunt"" types that blame every ill on the devil and are quick to take up a gun and shoot their own members who stray.  In other words, NOT the type of belief system that attracts enough members to become a mega-church.Later still, the loonies are suddenly invoking a catholic type ceremony, making the sign of the cross on a girls forehead, repeating a rote prayer, and referring to visions of the Virgin Mary.  It's this kind of inconsistent portrayal that tells me the writers were just looking for a convenient villain, and thus created a conglomerate of every religious stereotype they could think of, again lifted from other films.Now, at least the pastor has his moment to condemn the extremities that his son is going to.  And, to be fair, the pagan character are also rendered in a pretty stereotypical light.  In fact, one could argue that, at its core, the film argues for moderation from ALL faiths, as our two main characters both seem disillusioned with the extreme believers of their relative belief systems.  I know the feeling!But, these quibbles aside, the film is still very well put together, and will have no problem being remembered as one of the few stand outs for After Dark's third Horror-fest.",4,"Dark and Creepy, if Derivative - I'm gonna go ahead and call it the best of 2009's ""8 Films To Die For.""",1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,3282,"['small', 'town', 'afflicted', 'rash', 'suicides', 'Beginning', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'front', 'bewildered', 'girlfriend', 'continuing', 'anyone', 'who', 'latest', 'victim', 'Christian', 'girl', 'named', 'Lindsay', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'tragedies', 'beset', 'other', 'affliction', 'town', 'suffers', 'extreme', 'religious', 'views', 'mega-church', 'Convinced', 'deaths', 'stem', 'local', 'witch', 'family', 'Lindsay', 'boyfriend', 'Dylan', 'effort', 'first', 'intimidate', 'ultimately', 'kill', 'off', 'Lindsay', 'choose', 'sides', 'devotion', 'town', 'faith', 'helping', 'boy', 'whom', 'town', 'gunning', 'for.FROM', 'WITHIN', 'one', 'last', 'year', '8', 'Films', 'Die', 'watched', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'polished', 'Acting', 'flawless', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'most', 'part', 'writing', 'story', 'coherent', 'logical', 'progression', 'plenty', 'chills', 'way', 'short', 'what', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'have.I', 'do', 'have', 'two', 'slight', 'issues', 'movie', 'first', 'fact', 'chilling', 'bulk', 'films', 'scares', 'are', 'lifted', 'almost', 'directly', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'creepy', 'girl', 'hair', 'covering', 'face', 'girl', 'appearing', 'TV', 'cheap', 'Effects', 'shot', 'sudden', 'black-eyed', 'demon', 'face', 'film', 'also', 'having', 'THE', 'BROKEN', 'same', 'festival', 'year', 'films', 'drawing', 'heavily', 'mirrors', 'reflections', 'attacking', 'people', 'effects', 'are', 'lifted', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'still', 'employed', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'movie', 'delivers', 'plenty', 'great', 'creep-out', 'moments', 'even', 'are', 'familiar.The', 'only', 'other', 'issue', 'have', 'broadly', 'stereotypical', 'portrayal', 'extreme', 'religion', 'starters', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'grasp', 'what', 'religious', 'group', 'are', 'portraying', 'first', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'evangelistic', 'mega-church', 'God', 'here', 'bless', 'mentality', 'early', 'clear', 'want', 'be', 'witch', 'hunt', 'types', 'blame', 'ill', 'devil', 'are', 'quick', 'take', 'up', 'gun', 'shoot', 'own', 'members', 'who', 'stray', 'other', 'words', 'NOT', 'type', 'belief', 'system', 'enough', 'members', 'become', 'mega-church.Later', 'still', 'loonies', 'are', 'suddenly', 'invoking', 'catholic', 'type', 'ceremony', 'making', 'sign', 'cross', 'girls', 'forehead', 'repeating', 'rote', 'prayer', 'referring', 'visions', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'kind', 'inconsistent', 'portrayal', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'looking', 'convenient', 'villain', 'thus', 'created', 'conglomerate', 'religious', 'stereotype', 'could', 'think', 'again', 'lifted', 'other', 'films.Now', 'least', 'pastor', 'moment', 'condemn', 'extremities', 'son', 'going', 'be', 'fair', 'pagan', 'character', 'are', 'also', 'rendered', 'pretty', 'stereotypical', 'light', 'fact', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'core', 'film', 'moderation', 'ALL', 'faiths', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'disillusioned', 'extreme', 'believers', 'relative', 'belief', 'systems', 'know', 'feeling', 'quibbles', 'aside', 'film', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'remembered', 'one', 'few', 'stand', 'outs', 'Dark', 'third', 'Horror-fest']",From Within

1226497,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001P9N99O,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Death.That title blurb makes perfect sense once you see the film.2008's ""From Within"" tells the story of a Maryland town plagued by a series of apparent suicides. The people of the town's prominent church attribute the problem to witchcraft and zero-in on the Wiccan son of a witch who literally burned to death years earlier (written off as an ""accident""). A Christian girl, Lindsay, takes compassion on the Wiccan dude, Aiden, and tries to understand him and what's really going on. Meanwhile people keep dying. Is this a curse of retribution released by the Wiccans? A small group of the Christians led by Dylan, the pastor's son and Lindsay's boyfriend, become desperate enough to pull out the guns. Havoc ensues.If you're interested in seeing another typical slasher flick ""From Within"" probably won't appeal to you, but if you're in the mood for a serious chiller with an original concept and truly thought-provoking material this is the film to see, particularly if you're interested in belief systems, psychology, spirituality and questions of morality.Some might criticize the film as anti-Christian but this is a superficial and knee-jerk reaction. The story's main protagonist, Linday, is shown in a completely positive light and most of the other Christians reveal positive and negative qualities. Is this anti-Christian or simply the way it is? Besides, the film clearly shows the negative sides of the Wiccans as well.The picture acknowledges the human need for belief systems to get through life and that people are still people regardless of what they believe. It doesn't tell the viewer what belief system to adhere to (or which one is 'right') but it does unveil the existence of dark spiritual power and the dangers of sin, so what's that tell ya?Some rightly point out that the influential mega-church in the film shows aspects of numerous Christian sects, which isn't realistic (see Steve Forsyth's excellent review). I believe this was done intentionally by the writer (Brad Keene) so that the film's not picking on just one group. Hence, the mega-church is a microcosm of Christendom and represents all Christianity. Such an approach yields a group that is not fully believable even while having many aspects of truth. Needless to say, don't look to this film for a completely accurate depiction of legitimate Christianity. It's a movie, not real life.The way the death-curse works is very interesting: The curse is spread socially via the first person exposed to the latest victim; in other words, it's contagious. Also, the victims die via an evil doppelganger (an obvious type of the flesh or sin nature) who kills them in a way that looks like suicide. This supports the idea that evil can only slay or ruin or limit a person through their own volition, i.e. 'from within'. You could put it this way: The way of darkness is the way of self-destruction.I liked how the film shows members of both belief systems humbly admitting they made mistakes (i.e. repentance) and willing to make things right, whatever the cost.The story shows the domino effect of human failing. One person's moral failure leads to a deadly cover-up & slander which brings about retribution and numerous innocents' deaths. On and on and on. Evil begats evil.As noted above, the film is truly thought-provoking. Lindsay sees her church's error and hypocrisy even while she experiences its positive aspects. She reaches out in compassion to the Wiccan dude, a purely loving gesture, but ultimately realizes that witchcraft is what released the death-curse. She's stuck between evil & error on both sides, what can she do?""From Within"" is a horror film in the truest sense. Although it reveals a lot of truth about the human condition -- both good and bad -- it's not ultimately 'life-affirming' (but only within the small scope of the film, not the broader context of eternity). This is horror.One of the film's highlights is the song played during the opening credits ""This Voice"" by Ane Brun. The song is outstanding, to say the least. It's from her 2006 album A TEMPORARY DIVE. You can hear the whole tune on youtube.The picture was shot in Havre de Grace & Perryville, Maryland (it's nice to see a movie shot somewhere else rather than friggin' Vancouver and British Columbia).The runtime is 89 minutes.FINAL WORD: ""From Within"" is nothing less than amazing.
