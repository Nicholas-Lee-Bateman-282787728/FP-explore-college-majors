I watched every episode and I was loving every minute of this stylish, cool, and controversial show about swingers. The premise is simple, the acting is top-notch, and the fashion is hideous but memorable, love the music as well. Grant Show aged very well, he's still a babe. This show takes place in 1976 so get out your mood rings and platform shoes and buy this stellar first season of Swingtown. Hope the network allows for a second season, fingers crossed.",5,Sexy nostalgia.,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,530,"['Swingtown', 'one', 'best', 'summer', 'shows', 'have', 'probably', 'ever', 'seen', 'watched', 'episode', 'was', 'loving', 'minute', 'stylish', 'cool', 'controversial', 'show', 'swingers', 'premise', 'simple', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'fashion', 'hideous', 'memorable', 'love', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'Grant', 'Show', 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'still', 'babe', 'show', 'place', '1976', 'so', 'get', 'out', 'mood', 'rings', 'platform', 'shoes', 'buy', 'stellar', 'first', 'season', 'Swingtown', 'Hope', 'network', 'second', 'season', 'fingers', 'crossed']",Swingtown: Season 1

And I really hope they bring this back again next summer! This show is not really about swinging married couples. It is about how intertwined adults become in their friends lives. It's set back in the 70's in Chicago. I was drawn to this show due to Grant Show (who knew he would look that hot in a stach?) and Molly Parker (who was phenomenal in Deadwood) I kept watching because i was so intrigued in the characters and their lives. For the prudes who protested this show because of the swinging.... there are only seconds long clips of the actual swinging in darkly lit rooms. Most of it is implied instead of shown. The characters are richly written and resonate as true. The family dynamics are real to life with the children and times of the excessive 70's. The costumes and settings are so 70's its like watching your own town, driving your old family cars and your own homes. I was surprised that CBS had the balls to bring this for viewers. This is more like the quality shows you get from HBO or showtime. I promise you will love this show. And there are way too many loose ends to leave it dangling....

I hope there are many more great seasons to come. Please keep this show alive. The show is so refreshing at a time when a show about swingers seems be so taboo in the wake of the terrible conservative climate we are currently living in this country - hopefully when Obama becomes President the country will be able to relax a little.This show has great scripts, great acting, great sets, and attention to detail the producers have is amazing, down to the products the characters use that don't even exist anymore. But, if you were alive in the day they jump out as if it was yesterday.The show really started getting interesting in the last few episodes, and the characters really started facing some difficult situations. I can't wait for the second season to start.Oh, and one more thing, the music in this series (set in the 70's) is vitally important, I HOPE that the DVD rights were cleared for the SAME music before the show even aired.

1184604,A21UUO3LE3SDGD,B001E6DLK0,CWC,"[12, 12]","Summer shows are meant to reflect the time of the year: light, fun, and happy. And... as with most with the changing of the leaves and coolness of autumn air, they quickly disappear from memory. I frankly wasn't expecting much from the show as it seemed to be atypical CBS's preferred line-up. My curiousity to watch the series was both my familarity with Grant Snow (Melrose Place), Jack Davenport (Coupling), and Josh Hopkins (Jack & Jill, Pepper Dennis, & Brothers & Sisters) and my fond memories of 1976. The first episode started out the gate giving a glimspe of a series that was going to produce thought, conversation, and refection besides just skin and nostalgia. Unfortunately, as with CBS's penchant with a quality series, i.e., ""WKRP"" and ""Jericho,"" the network quietly jumped the show in its schedule making it harder to gain an audience, especially moving it to the ""graveyard"" Friday nights.A very true reflection of culture, morals, mores of 1976 America! Just when I thought the show couldn't get better in quality, character development, or more entertaining, the next week's episode would prove me wrong. It is obvious that Mike Kelly took great pains to reproduce Chicago (or anytown) 1976 to an authenticity not equalled in many period shows. The actors don't play one-dimensional characters, but multi-layered people with a spectrum of feelings, opinions that crossed the morals, mores, economic-class, feelings, opinions (religious and otherwise), and casualness of the time and attitudes of both adults and kids of the '70's. My one apprecation of the show was that the teenagers actually looked like teenagers because they were teenagers and not 20 & 30-somethings playing those parts!A very much under-rated and under-appreciated series! If you were lucky enough to lived through the '70's, catch this gem on this lucky chance that allows ""Swingtown"" to live again. Kudos, to the actors, producers, etc. that obvious went to great pains and broke the mold with a summer series that gives more than ""light and fluff."" They succeeded in more ways than they know. It is apparent the memories and appreciation of this show from its ardent fans about the summer of 1976 is going to last well beyond the summer of 2008. Here's hoping the ""Swingtown"" fan base increases thousands-fold! Spread the word!

It's just what American television needs right now - a fun, and honest show, that's not feminized nor politically correct! Yes, we used to have open sex (pre-aids), smoked a lot of pot, and even worse - cigarettes!

In a time when we're all being brainwashed by all the garbage, and untruths on TV, this must be hailed as the very best show in many years! And in true fashion, it only lasted one, summer season.

1184607,A2YCTMCK9VFCQJ,B001E6DLK0,"James M. Cayon ""ogam5""","[28, 32]","There have been but a handful of television programs about the Seventies exploring a decade that is still not completely understood by the vast majority to this day even while it has become a permanent part of our collective cultural experience - and with good reason. These would include ""The Wonder Years"", ""That 70's Show"", the NBC miniseries ""The Seventies"", ""Swingtown"", and soon, an American adaptation of the BBC's early Seventies time-traveling detective show, ""Life On Mars"". As for movies, two of the more.....seminal films are ""Dazed And Confused"" and ""Boogie Nights"". While the Sixties are held in a certain, somewhat justifiable reverence, the decade following them still doesn't receive all the respect it equally deserves for being a similar witness to profound changes in how many of us view our lives and roles in Western society. The two decades cannot be viewed separately without a loss of understanding as to why they unfolded in the ways that they did. It may be oversimplifying to say that, if the Sixties were the cause, then the Seventies were largely the effect, but there is some truth to that perception; much of the preoccupation with physical, less deep concerns that overflowed well into the Eighties was as a direct result of Vietnam's increasingly unacceptable level of carnage, underscored by Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley and Harry Reasoner's sonorous deliveries on a nightly basis - despite exponentially larger losses of life in the Civil War, as well as both world wars, the spread of television helped death really get up in our faces - and the fundamentally unsatisfying manner in which that conflict ended.When searching for a word that describes what fueled the late Sixties and Seventies, one frequently referenced is 'exploration' - all that had transpired, from the riots to the assassinations and dehumanizing effect of police actions in Southeast Asia, provoked much soul-searching and a truly ravenous desire to play, lustily reconnect with life after being thoroughly immersed in death for almost a decade. But paradoxically, such indulgences as wife-swapping were really expressions of adult desires to be innocent again. With this exploration inevitably came insight as to the nature of relationships and the aforementioned changes to them. A lot of the soundtrack to this process illuminates it well, but also lays bare the superficial quality accompanying those times. While so much of the music produced in the late Sixties and Seventies was genuinely innovative and diverse, by the mid-Eighties an undeniable ennui and soullessness had crept into it sonically, art imitating life - the new visual medium pushed the societal envelope far more than the sounds being made and MTV thrived for that reason alone. To the ears of many baby boomers - this reviewer's included - the Eighties simply cannot compare to either decade preceding them.""Swingtown"", more than any other television show focusing upon the Seventies, reveals the underlying forces that altered some long-accepted perceptions about relationships; as has been noted by others, any hedonistic forays in this show act only as a vessel for the characters' journeys to discover intimacy again, as illustrated by how Tom and Trina Decker, swinging throughout, bond in the first-season finale with the prospect of becoming unintentional parents while the marriages of Susan, Bruce, Roger and Janet all seemingly hang in the balance - the underlying message speaking to the value of honesty, about who the Deckers are as people and what they feel free to enjoy; they have never been anything less than communicative. True, there is a distinct danger of portraying their experiences too broadly and glossing over the emotional consequences in particular of these explorations, but such honesty will be what helps all concerned to navigate the very new terrain awaiting them and a nation still young at 200 years.The cast of ""Swingtown"" features the unsinkable Molly Parker as Susan Miller, Jack Davenport as her husband Bruce struggling to be an effective father and faithful partner, Miriam Shor as earnest, loyal and forthright Janet Thompson - the eventual breakout character whose career path, much to our surprise, fully exposes a strong element of independence and who could potentially become a retroactive icon for women's liberation should the series be given renewed life. Her slightly chauvinistic husband Roger, whose moral bearings have been lost with his job and blurred familial role, is deftly portrayed by Josh Hopkins as, at first feeling less than useful to his family, he inexorably gravitates toward the somewhat emotionally neglected Susan, although she has not effectively communicated the depth of her frustration to Bruce before their relationship degenerates at the Decker's annual end-of-summer beach party on the shores of Lake Michigan. The teenagers in ""Swingtown"" are also on their own, comparatively modest, journeys of exploration - with the possible exception of Laurie Miller, who is growing up much too fast for Bruce to reconcile, further straining his family's bond with him. That this series takes place around Chicago is not entirely surprising; the social aftershocks in question did take a while longer to reach the heartland.....CBS and producer Mike Kelley have a well-written, thought-provoking show (the latter does need to be more diligent about some anachronisms that have snuck into the dialogue and settings; for example, 'no-brainer' first arose in the Nineties and the men's suit lapels should be wider, but those are minor quibbles) that wholly deserves to be renewed for a full second season; in just 13 episodes, the character development has been outstanding and thousands of viewers have been vociferous in their online support of ""Swingtown"" - one petition has garnered almost 6,000 signatures in less than a month. Here's hoping that the Tiffany Network rewards that support.....",5,Swingtown - next stop after Saigon.....,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,5949,"['have', 'been', 'handful', 'television', 'programs',

I cannot remember the last time I've watched a show that was so entertaining and funny and clever. A series like ""Swingtown"" restores my faith in broadcast network television which has otherwise gone to hell in a hand basket.Truth be told, I never would have watched this show if none other than Grant Show were not staring in it. He's one of my favorite actors and he was on one of my favorite TV shows so I had a feeling that anything he would be in would at least be mildly fun to watch. But this show is way more than just a little fun. And, even if Grant weren't in it, I think I'd still enjoy it. But watching him is just icing on the cake. Doesn't he look so sexy with that mustache, too? In a recent TV Guide interview when asked about his new 70's appearance Grant said: It's a boom-chick-a-boom-boom mustache, that's for sure.This is the main cast:Grant Show / Tom DeckerLana Parrilla / Trina DeckerShanna Collins / Laurie MillerJack Davenport / Bruce MillerMiriam Shor / Janet ThompsonNick Benson / Roger ThompsonThe show is basically about 3 very different families, living through the free-loving 70's in a suburb of Chicago. The Miller's are more or less your typical family. They moved to a nicer neighborhood with their children. And when they moved, they met Tom and Trina Decker. Tom and Trina are a little more adventurous and enjoy trying new things. Janet & Roger are the Millers' neighbors from their previous neighborhood who they were always very good friends with; however since the move the relationship has become to start getting strained for a variety of reasons.What's so special about this show?Well, as the title (may) suggest, some of the principal characters enjoy swinging. The Decker's are serious swingers who just want to make new friends and enjoy themselves. The Miller's are (much) less adventurous, however after meeting Trina and Tom they decide to throw cautions to the wind and try it. And, the Thompson's are at the other end of the pendulum. I wouldn't call them prudes, though. Because I don't think many people would consider swinging a fun thing or even something that would be simple to try.What's most interesting about this series is watching these 3 very different groups of people come together and put their differences out there for everyone to see. They each have a very diverse perspective and they're each right and wrong in their own ways.When I think of swinging the very first thing that comes to mind is that hilarious ep from ""All in the Family."" Do you remember the one? Edith invited a couple that she met from a personals ad over and unbeknownst to her they were a couple of swingers. And, when she found out that they both enjoyed having sex with multiple partners because as they put it, ""we were drowning, swinging saved our marriage,"" Edith replies: ""I think I'd rather drown.""Frankly, that's how I feel, too. I'd sooner walk though a burning building before I or my husband ever did such a thing. But that doesn't mean that this series still isn't informative and just great to watch. You don't have to take sides and you don't have to be for it or against it to enjoy the show.CBS has ordered a total of 13 eps for Season 1 (these were actaully filmed last year) and these included:PilotLove Will Find a WayDouble ExposureCabin FeverGo Your Own WayFriends With BenefitsHeatwavePuzzleramaSwingus InterruptusRunning on EmptyEpisode #11 - title not yet announcedSurpriseTake It To The LimitEven though the series has been canceled, you can still can see previews and purchase epshere.Two fundamentalist groups already tried to get ""Swingtown"" boycotted. Whatever happened to live and let live? I suppose changing the channel would be too difficult for these people. Remember, judge not lest ye be judged and in the case of this series you are not what you watch.",5,"they don't want to hurt the others, so they love in the nighttime, and shake hands in the light of day",1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,3940,"['Swingtown', 'best', 'series', 'television', 'program', 'been', 'American', 'television', 'years', 'years', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'last', 'time', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'clever', 'series', 'Swingtown', 'faith', 'broadcast', 'network', 'television', 'otherwise', 'gone', 'hell', 'hand', 'basket.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'watched', 'show', 'none', 'other', 'Grant', 'Show', 'were', 'not', 'staring', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'had', 'feeling', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'mildly', 'fun', 'watch', 'show', 'way', 'more', 'just', 'little', 'fun', 'even', 'Grant', 'were', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'just', 'icing', 'cake', ""n't"", 'look', 'so', 'sexy', 'mustache', 'too', 'recent', 'TV', 'Guide', 'interview', 'when', 'asked', 'new', '70', 'appearance', 'Grant', 'said', 'boom-chick-a-boom-boom', 'mustache', 'sure.This', 'main', 'cast', 'Grant', 'Show', '/', 'Tom', 'DeckerLana', 'Parrilla', '/', 'Trina', 'DeckerShanna', 'Collins', '/', 'Laurie', 'MillerJack', 'Davenport', '/', 'Bruce', 'MillerMiriam', 'Shor', '/', 'Janet', 'ThompsonNick', 'Benson', '/', 'Roger', 'ThompsonThe', 'show', 'basically', 'about', '3', 'very', 'different', 'families', 'living', 'free-loving', '70', 'suburb', 'Chicago', 'Miller', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'typical', 'family', 'moved', 'nicer', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'when', 'moved', 'met', 'Tom', 'Trina', 'Decker', 'Tom', 'Trina', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'adventurous', 'enjoy', 'trying', 'new', 'things', 'Janet', 'Roger', 'are', 'Millers', 'neighbors', 'previous', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'were', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'however', 'move', 'relationship', 'become', 'start', 'getting', 'strained', 'variety', 'reasons.What', 'so', 'special', 'show', 'Well', 'title', 'may', 'suggest', 'principal', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'swinging', 'Decker', 'are', 'serious', 'swingers', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'enjoy', 'Miller', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'adventurous', 'however', 'meeting', 'Trina', 'Tom', 'decide', 'throw', 'cautions', 'wind', 'try', 'Thompson', 'are', 'other', 'end', 'pendulum', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'prudes', 'though', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'swinging', 'fun', 'thing', 'even', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'simple', 'most', 'interesting', 'series', 'watching', '3', 'very', 'different', 'groups', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'put', 'differences', 'out', 'there', 'everyone', 'see', 'have', 'very', 'diverse', 'perspective', ""'re"", 'right', 'wrong', 'own', 'ways.When', 'think', 'swinging', 'very', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'hilarious', 'ep', 'Family', 'Do', 'remember', 'one', 'Edith', 'invited', 'couple', 'met', 'personals', 'ad', 'unbeknownst', 'were', 'couple', 'swingers', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'sex', 'multiple', 'partners', 'put', 'were', 'drowning', 'swinging', 'saved', 'marriage', 'Edith', 'replies', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'drown', 'Frankly', 'how', 'feel', 'too', ""'d"", 'sooner', 'walk', 'burning', 'building', 'husband', 'ever', 'did', 'thing', ""n't"", 'mean', 'series', 'still', ""n't"", 'informative', 'just', 'great', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'sides', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'enjoy', 'show.CBS', 'ordered', 'total', '13', 'eps', 'Season', '1', 'were', 'actaully', 'filmed', 'last', 'year', 'included', 'PilotLove', 'Will', 'Find', 'WayDouble', 'ExposureCabin', 'FeverGo', 'Own', 'WayFriends', 'BenefitsHeatwavePuzzleramaSwingus', 'InterruptusRunning', 'EmptyEpisode', '11', 'title', 'not', 'yet', 'announcedSurpriseTake', 'LimitEven', 'series', 'been', 'canceled', 'can', 'still', 'can', 'see', 'previews', 'purchase', 'epshere.Two', 'fundamentalist', 'groups', 'already', 'tried', 'get', 'Swingtown', 'boycotted', 'happened', 'live', 'let', 'live', 'suppose', 'changing', 'channel', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'difficult', 'people', 'Remember', 'judge', 'not', 'lest', 'ye', 'be', 'judged', 'case', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'watch']",Swingtown: Season 1

The plot is groovy, the acting superb and the music and feel of this show literally brings me back to that era. Very well made and should be on a channel such as HBO or FX to get the full effect. It really has very little sex and focuses more on the relationships that develop very well over the 13 episode season.

'Swingtown' was one of those shows that came on in the middle of the year--I'm thinking like the Spring season, in the middle of the week--that I guess I could never quite keep track of.And maybe that's what happened with a LOT of other people too--which probably lead to this show's cancellation.  And what a shame!  BecauseSwingtown - The First Seasonwas a GEM of a show!!!The character's were so wonderfully put together.  And the actors who got to play them were EVERYTHING and MORE than you would've wanted them to be!!!And the funny thing--and it's not even really funny, but the MAIN reason that I wanted to get this show was because of the actor Jack Davenport--who I remember enjoying from the BBC showCoupling - The Complete First Season--I always liked him in that--always kinda reminded me of the 'Ross' character from the TV showFriends: The Complete First Season.  Though, he was NOTHING like either of those characters in this show.I liked how he and his wife, played by the wonderful Molly Parker--who I remember seeing inSix Feet Under: The Complete Seriesas the lady Rabi, were like the 'normal' couple moving up from suburbia.I liked how even though they could've been thought of as slightly 'conservative', they were MORE than open enough to...well, the name of the show IS 'Swingtown', so I'm sure you can put it all together!But what I liked even more than the 'swinging' aspect of the show, was how the two couples Jack & Susan and Tom & Trina related to each other when it wasn't about the 'swinging'.  It was like Susan was NEVER going to look at Trina sideways for sleeping with her husband.  And Tom was NEVER going to be caught leering at Susan.  It was like (the 'swinging') was something that the four of them did together.  And it held a special place for them, CERTAINLY. Though it wasn't going to get to the point that it was BIGGER than their friendship.  Like their friendship could even be sustained without it. (Which as the show went along, it sorta came to.)More importantly, what I liked about this show, is that it was about people. And the lives that they were living at a certain time in America that has LONG since been forgotten about--well, maybe not SO forgotten about, but people have a lot of other things on their minds these days!I liked that this show could be unique and different and didn't have to follow the same old formula of 'crime show' THIS, 'medical drama' THAT, that most current shows seem to me modeled around.Sure wish that the network wouldn't have cancelled this and sure wish that the production staff of this show could've somehow found another network for this show to be moved to, to keep it going--I mean, that's what cable's for!I mean, it seemed to work for the showSliders - The First and Second Seasonsas well as another long time favorite of mine--The Paper Chase: Season One.But, oh well, I can be thankful for my DVD just the same!!!  Just wish there was something on TV right now like it.  (Mr. Kelley, that's a hint!!!)Also, GREAT work by the incredibly talented Grant Show--who played the 'swinging' Pilot Tom, who makes EVERYTHING better and better by his very presence!!!

That said, I fully agree with the other raves about this show.  What was so shocking to me (in a good way) was how un-cynical this show is.  It's about love, relationships, and the importance of honesty.  The sexual exploration is handled without the expected put-downs and mocking.  It's not perfect, fell back on formulas a couple times during the season, but just when you think it will become another ""problems because nobody says whats really going on"" plot, it resurrects itself with honesty, grace, and love.

Remotes really are handy, aren't they? They have gone to great lengths to make the songs, the clothes, the items around the house and every detail of the show authentic to 1976. We watch it for the nostalgia and the chemistry Tom and Trina have is amazing. Add to that the open exploration of Susan and Bruce (two adults who married young just like my parents) and the chipping away of the ice queen Janet and her goofy but loveable husband Roger and you have a great cast. Knowing how the history went back then leaves so much open for great storylines going into the 80's if the moral majority would get off their high horse and find something else to complain about.

The people in ST reminded me of many swingers I knew, liked, respected and enjoyed. The majority were married (most still are, happily) although such partying times are past for most (it's been almost 40 years!). I saw little of swing's 'down-side'. Swingers I knew were successful, educated, 'normal' except they had heightened libidos and took good care of themselves and so looked real good.(Like to get an unbiased but statistical/dry view of swinging? [[ASIN:B001NXVFT8The Gilmartin Report]]. For a bit more verve (from a Harvard PhD thesis) tryMake Love, Not War : The Sexual Revolution: An Unfettered History. )Swingtown is a wonderful series for so many reasons. First, it's authentic. It addresses both simple and complex human relationship issues. Excellent production values shine from scripts to casting to direction. ST is unbiased, showing the pros and cons of the lifestyle. It's a nostalgic visit to the 70's, a simpler, less cynical time, sort of an American adolescence before the harder, angrier, scarier times in the last decades of the 20th Century. And now, too. For most viewers it will be very, very entertaining, certainly thought-provoking.Yes, it involves rather sensational sex. But in tasteful, only illusionary ways; actually, in rather romantic, mature, character-defining ways. It could be the most interesting, humanistic and dramatic way to get insights into the sociology, psychology and cultural aspects of adult relationships via TV today.ST is never vulgar. (You want vulgar, see Californication!) Rather, it delves into complex American belief systems then (and now) and dramatizes our wants versus our needs and the confusions that hit when they don't jive. Of course, it's sexy and stirring too.ST can be seen as intelligent soap opera. Social pressures, moral questioning, heavy on relationship depictations. As characters aren't all swingers it's interesting to see conventional people's conflicts and often-titillated interest when they get what's going on. Often, pretty funny too.The net of it: Swingtown is more than sex, it successfully uses the charged swinger's context to address many aspects of human nature; while being great entertainment.Last note: Estimates say over 50-million swingers are in America today.

I grew up in the 70's and can really relate to the characters and it really took me back. Watching Swingtown makes me realise how Lucky I was to grow up in that era! This show isnt the raunchfest that many conservative groups made it out to be(would have helped if they actually watched the show). The writers did a really great job of making the characters grow as the series went along. I remember that in the first show, I didnt care for Janet, too prissy and stuck up but as the show moved along her character really began to explore her feelings and aspirations and she began to loosen up and now she is my FAVORITE character on the show. The show to me strikes an emotional chord with alot of people who are approaching middle age and ask ""What's It All About"" and it helps to watch these characters that you grow to love go through it and you are rooting for them to find whatever it is they are looking for. I feel it may have been a mistake for CBS to promote the sex so much when the show first started, yes there are some scenes that are risque(though not nearly as risque as what you see on cable), this show is so much more than that, it is about real people and the real problems that they go through in relationships, work and family! I am THRILLED that the series will be released in DVD because Tonight is the VERY LAST EPISODE!! It looks like that the show will not be renewed because who watches tv in the summer anyway, BUT if enough people buy this dvd set, who knows, maybe it will get a second life. that what happended to King Of The Hill, the show was cancelled but the response to the dvd was so huge that the show was renewed and now it thrives!

1184618,A2GOKFQGLRBXUB,B001E6DLK0,TruAim,"[5, 18]","Honestly, I don't understand all the 5-Star reviews for ""Swingtown,"" because I found it poorly made on almost every level.  And if you're looking for anything even remotely close to the quality of ""Madmen,"" sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this show is at Titanic level depths beneath the quality of ""Madmen.""  First problem, the writing of Swingtown was terrible.  Evidently none of the writers grew up in the 70s, because there was virtually zero attempt to make the characters speak like they're actually in the 70s.  The 70s were exploding with words, phrases and slang unique to the 70s but you'll find hardly any ""70s-speak"" on this show.  What's worse, the writers use words in ways they were not used back in the 70s, such as the dismissive form of ""whatever"" and the buddy/pal form of ""dude.""  Those uses of ""whatever"" and ""dude"" didn't start until the mid 80s.  So sloppy lazy writing that fails to immerse you in the time period.  Set design is also weak, with far too many sets and locales looking too ""stage-y"" and fake.  And if you look closely in some scenes in which characters are driving around in a car, you can see 2000-era sports cars and SUVs driving past in the background.  I mean that's so bad that it's like Ed Woods levels of incompetance.  Stories?  Forgettable.  Acting?  Forgettable.  Editing?  Forgettable.  Music/Soundtrack?  So-so.  I mean I love good TV shows set in by-gone eras, but if you're going to make a show set in the 70s you better make it FEEL like the 70s.  I grew up in the 70s, I knew the 70s, and you, Swingtown, are no 70s show.",1,THERE'S A REASON THIS SHOW GOT CANCELLED- -- IT'S BAD,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,1585,"['Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', '5-Star', 'reviews', 'Swingtown', 'found', 'poorly', 'made', 'almost', 'level', ""'re"", 'looking', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'close', 'quality', 'Madmen', 'sorry', 'be', 'bearer', 'bad', 'news', 'show', 'Titanic', 'level', 'depths', 'quality', 'Madmen', 'First', 'problem', 'writing', 'Swingtown', 'was', 'terrible', 'Evidently', 'none', 'writers', 'grew', 'up', '70s', 'was', 'virtually', 'zero', 'attempt', 'make', 'characters', 'speak', ""'re"", 'actually', '70s', '70s', 'were', 'exploding', 'words', 'phrases', 'slang', 'unique', '70s', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hardly', '70s-speak', 'show', 'What', 'worse', 'writers', 'use', 'words', 'ways', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'back', '70s', 'such', 'dismissive', 'form', 'buddy/pal', 'form', 'dude', 'uses', 'dude', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'mid', '80s', 'So', 'sloppy', 'lazy', 'writing', 'immerse', 'time', 'period', 'Set', 'design', 'also', 'weak', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'sets', 'locales', 'looking', 'too', 'stage-y', 'fake', 'look', 'closely', 'scenes', 'characters', 'are', 'driving', 'around', 'car', 'can', 'see', '2000-era', 'sports', 'cars', 'SUVs', 'driving', 'past', 'background', 'mean', 'so', 'bad', 'Ed', 'Woods', 'levels', 'incompetance', 'Stories', 'Forgettable', 'Acting', 'Forgettable', 'Editing', 'Forgettable', 'Music/Soundtrack', 'So-so', 'mean', 'love', 'good', 'TV', 'shows', 'set', 'by-gone', 'eras', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'show', 'set', '70s', 'better', 'make', 'FEEL', '70s', 'grew', 'up', '70s', 'knew', '70s', 'Swingtown', 'are', '70s', 'show']",Swingtown: Season 1
