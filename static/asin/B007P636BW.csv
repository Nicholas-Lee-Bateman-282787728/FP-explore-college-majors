1535632,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B007P636BW,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[11, 12]","For the past four months, Penny Abbott (played by Stephanie Greco) has been working as a tour guide at The Whaley House, where Anna and three other members of the Whaley family died during the 1800s. Penny is a skeptic and doesn't believe in the ghostly encounters that tourists claim to see there, even when a new tourist has to be hospitalized after claiming that she saw ghosts.Penny is close with Bethany Romero (played by Lynn Lowry), who has been running the museum for over thirty years. She gives Penny three rules of the Whaley House that you should never break.Don't Call the Ghosts OutDon't Damage the HouseDon't Ever Go Inside the House at NightAfter Penny tells her boyfriend Jake and their three friends, Vanessa, Craig, and Giselle about the incident with the tourist, they persuade Penny to go with them to the house that night to see if there are any real ghosts. She agrees and lets them inside the house, along with Ray, who has all the paranormal gadgets and gizmos, and the famous psychic, Keith Drummond.As they attempt to investigate, Vanessa flips out just like the tourist did and an accident occurs. What they don't know is that Anna Whaley's spirit doesn't like unwanted guests at night and one by one she'll claim all of their souls.The ASYLUM Home Entertainment was nice enough to send me a free DVD in exchange for this review. The Haunting of Whaley House is similar to The ASYLUM's other recent release100th Street Haunting (The Ghost of Richard Speck), as both plots are based on actual haunted locations. Due to budget restraints, they couldn't afford to film the movie at the actual Whaley House (an official Haunted House by the United States Commerce Department), so they found another creepy looking house for the movie.The plot is simple; a group of friends sneak into a haunted house looking for ghosts. The premise works well for horror films, but one of the problems I had with it is that the characters are just too old to be breaking into a house looking for ghosts. If they characters were teenagers, I can understand that, or if they characters were doing research for a college project. The acting in the movie is mediocre at best, except for Stephanie Greco, and the small appearance by screen legend, Lynn Lowry, who gave a great performance. Since I don't watch horror movies for the acting, I can overlook this.The cinematography throughout the movie was well done considering the low-budget and I consider it to be better than some theatrical movies. I liked the fact that they used old-fashioned scares with the occasional bloody scenes, and of course the cameo by Mindy Robinson.The Haunting of Whaley Houseoffers nothing new to the horror genre, but it does offer a frightening atmosphere and quirky dialogue that should satisfy most horror fans.",3,Don't Go Into the Whaley House at Night!,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,2801,"['past', 'four', 'months', 'Penny', 'Abbott', 'played', 'Stephanie', 'Greco', 'been', 'working', 'tour', 'guide', 'Whaley', 'House', 'where', 'Anna', 'three', 'other', 'members', 'Whaley', 'family', 'died', '1800s', 'Penny', 'skeptic', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghostly', 'encounters', 'claim', 'see', 'there', 'even', 'when', 'new', 'tourist', 'be', 'hospitalized', 'claiming', 'saw', 'ghosts.Penny', 'close', 'Bethany', 'Romero', 'played', 'Lynn', 'Lowry', 'who', 'been', 'running', 'museum', 'thirty', 'years', 'Penny', 'three', 'rules', 'Whaley', 'House', 'should', 'never', 'break.Do', ""n't"", 'Call', 'Ghosts', 'OutDo', ""n't"", 'Damage', 'HouseDo', ""n't"", 'Ever', 'Go', 'House', 'NightAfter', 'Penny', 'boyfriend', 'Jake', 'three', 'friends', 'Vanessa', 'Craig', 'Giselle', 'incident', 'tourist', 'persuade', 'Penny', 'go', 'house', 'night', 'see', 'are', 'real', 'ghosts', 'house', 'Ray', 'who', 'paranormal', 'gadgets', 'gizmos', 'famous', 'psychic', 'Keith', 'Drummond.As', 'attempt', 'investigate', 'Vanessa', 'out', 'just', 'tourist', 'did', 'accident', 'occurs', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Anna', 'Whaley', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'like', 'unwanted', 'guests', 'night', 'one', 'one', ""'ll"", 'claim', 'souls.The', 'ASYLUM', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'send', 'free', 'DVD', 'exchange', 'review', 'Haunting', 'Whaley', 'House', 'similar', 'ASYLUM', 'other', 'recent', 'release100th', 'Street', 'Haunting', 'Ghost', 'Richard', 'Speck', 'plots', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'haunted', 'locations', 'Due', 'budget', 'restraints', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'film', 'movie', 'actual', 'Whaley', 'House', 'official', 'Haunted', 'House', 'United', 'States', 'Commerce', 'Department', 'found', 'creepy', 'looking', 'house', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'group', 'friends', 'sneak', 'haunted', 'house', 'looking', 'ghosts', 'premise', 'well', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'problems', 'had', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'breaking', 'house', 'looking', 'ghosts', 'characters', 'were', 'teenagers', 'can', 'understand', 'characters', 'were', 'doing', 'research', 'college', 'project', 'acting', 'movie', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Stephanie', 'Greco', 'small', 'appearance', 'screen', 'legend', 'Lynn', 'Lowry', 'who', 'gave', 'great', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'acting', 'can', 'overlook', 'this.The', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'considering', 'low-budget', 'consider', 'be', 'better', 'theatrical', 'movies', 'liked', 'fact', 'used', 'old-fashioned', 'scares', 'occasional', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'course', 'cameo', 'Mindy', 'Robinson.The', 'Haunting', 'Whaley', 'Houseoffers', 'nothing', 'new', 'horror', 'genre', 'offer', 'frightening', 'atmosphere', 'quirky', 'dialogue', 'should', 'satisfy', 'most', 'horror', 'fans']",The Haunting of Whaley House

You have a young group of would be ghost hunters who sneak into one of Americas haunted house the Whaley house to try and finally confirm for themselves if there truly is such a thing as ghosts.  Though after awhile they discover more to the growing angst and terror that ghosts may truly be real after all but are in no way friendly to the living.  The movie relies more on the pop up effects of ghosts appearing rather then using highly priced CGI Effects to make them appear,that's not to say the effects are totally cheesy but just don't expect the quality to be like Avatar or anything.  The movie also uses the effects that creep us out late at night like shutting doors and light whispers or hearing thumping sounds that could be footsteps or not which in this movie actually worked pretty well.  The cast are a mix of decent to lower then B-movie quality but not the worst cast to do movie.The movie at the end is pretty much a generic ghost movie which many of us grew up with and while the limited budget made the producers and director cut back on more of the high tech effects most movies have nowadays it pulls off the scares enough to leave you entertained.

Spoiler alert: the biggest mistake made during the making of this film was abandoning the comedy angle and going for a straight horror film, because the opening scenes of this movie--while still well below average--are its best.

The storyline is tight and cohesive, and makes sense. The effects are actually really great for the budget. The actors are pretty good, but have their excessively cheesy moments.  The ending is a bit overdone and melodramatic -- it's the one place where the acting and effects are way out of whack.
