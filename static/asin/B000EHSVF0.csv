I love this season, every character is engaging and charming but with an edge. Laura Prepon's acting really took flight this season, she's a great and thoughtful actress. Look for Luke Wilson who plays Michael's jerk brother Casey. I highly recommend this heart-tugging and outrageous season.

973387,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B000EHSVF0,Alexiel,"[4, 5]","""That 70s Show"" is a guilty pleasure of a television show, set in the late 1970s and revolving around Eric Forman and his motley crew of friends and family. It's not a show that appeals to everyone to be sure, but I find it's a very funny show at times (less often it's wince-inducingly bad).Season 4 picks off where the bombshell that concluded Season 3 left off. While I don't like Season 4 as much as I like Season 3, it's still one of the best seasons of ""That 70s Show."" Here are some of what I feel are the highlight episodes of this season.""It's a Wonderful Life"" - Eric is depressed over his break-up with Donna and wishes they'd never gone out. An angel shows up and grants him his wish, and we get to see a funny (and somewhat creepy) view of what life would be like if Eric and Donna never got together, also providing a glimpse into how the gang reacts to 80s culture.""Pinciotti Vs. Forman"" - Donna and Eric have split up, so now they fight for ""custody"" of their friends, who act like children caught up in a divorce.""The Relapse/Uncomfortable Ball Stuff"" - Donna and Eric ""make up"" - or so it seems to Eric. Kelso helps Fez pick up older women at the supermarket, with hilarious results. In the second episode of the two-parter, Donna and Eric share an uncomfortable date at the Pricemart Ball.""An Eric Forman Christmas"" - Eric has to direct the church Christmas paegant and listen to his friends' complaints; Kelso's love of Christmas specials makes for good comedic fodder.""Class Picture"" - On class picture day, the gang remembers moments from the past, which sounds like a clip show, but it actually features the friends as children in events that took place well before the show's history began.""Prank Day"" - My favorite episode of Season 4. Eric, Hyde, and Fez declare prank war on Kelso for the pranks he's pulled on them. Things backfire quickly.""Hyde's Birthday"" - The gang goes on a quest to steal the ""High Street"" street sign for Hyde's birthday.""That 70s Musical"" - Fez's active imagination leads him into many fantasy musical sequences when he begins to think his friends do not care about him.""Love Wisconsin Style"" - Two members of the group of friends run off to California.What else can be said about this? The extra ""features"" are remarkably sparse and unimaginative, the commentaries dry, etc. but these remarks reply to all of the seasons of ""That 70s Show"" released on DVD so far. The draw is, of course, the episodes, and if you liked past seasons, you should like this season.",4,More fun from Point Place.,1152662400,"07 12, 2006",2006,2514,"['70s', 'Show', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'television', 'show', 'set', 'late', '1970s', 'revolving', 'around', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'motley', 'crew', 'friends', 'family', 'not', 'show', 'appeals', 'everyone', 'be', 'sure', 'find', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'times', 'less', 'often', 'wince-inducingly', 'bad', '.Season', '4', 'picks', 'where', 'bombshell', 'concluded', 'Season', '3', 'left', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Season', '4', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'Season', '3', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', '70s', 'Show', 'Here', 'are', 'what', 'feel', 'are', 'highlight', 'episodes', 'season', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Eric', 'depressed', 'break-up', 'Donna', ""'d"", 'never', 'gone', 'out', 'angel', 'up', 'grants', 'wish', 'get', 'see', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'view', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'Eric', 'Donna', 'never', 'got', 'together', 'also', 'providing', 'glimpse', 'how', 'gang', '80s', 'culture', 'Pinciotti', 'Vs.', 'Forman', 'Donna', 'Eric', 'have', 'split', 'up', 'so', 'now', 'fight', 'custody', 'friends', 'who', 'act', 'children', 'caught', 'up', 'divorce', 'Relapse/Uncomfortable', 'Ball', 'Stuff', 'Donna', 'Eric', 'make', 'up', 'Eric', 'Kelso', 'Fez', 'pick', 'up', 'older', 'women', 'supermarket', 'hilarious', 'results', 'second', 'episode', 'two-parter', 'Donna', 'Eric', 'share', 'uncomfortable', 'date', 'Pricemart', 'Ball', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'Christmas', 'Eric', 'direct', 'church', 'Christmas', 'paegant', 'listen', 'friends', 'complaints', 'Kelso', 'love', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'good', 'comedic', 'fodder', 'Class', 'Picture', 'class', 'picture', 'day', 'gang', 'remembers', 'moments', 'past', 'clip', 'show', 'actually', 'friends', 'children', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'well', 'show', 'history', 'began', 'Prank', 'Day', 'favorite', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'Eric', 'Hyde', 'Fez', 'declare', 'prank', 'war', 'Kelso', 'pranks', 'pulled', 'Things', 'backfire', 'quickly', 'Hyde', 'Birthday', 'gang', 'quest', 'steal', 'High', 'Street', 'street', 'sign', 'Hyde', 'birthday', '70s', 'Musical', 'Fez', 'active', 'imagination', 'many', 'fantasy', 'musical', 'sequences', 'when', 'think', 'friends', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'Love', 'Wisconsin', 'Style', 'Two', 'members', 'group', 'friends', 'run', 'off', 'California.What', 'else', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'extra', 'features', 'are', 'remarkably', 'sparse', 'unimaginative', 'commentaries', 'dry', 'etc', 'remarks', 'reply', 'seasons', '70s', 'Show', 'released', 'DVD', 'so', 'far', 'draw', 'course', 'episodes', 'liked', 'past', 'seasons', 'should', 'like', 'season']",N/A

973390,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000EHSVF0,Cubist,"[3, 4]","Initially disregarded as a lame Dazed and Confused knock-off, That `70s Show has survived for more seasons than anyone thought possible and helped launch the careers of Topher Grace and, to a lesser degree, Ashton Kutcher. To the show's credit, it doesn't solely rely on the kitschy d?cor and fashion sense of the decade for cheap laughs. Although, they do sneak in some cool artifacts, like the mousetrap game. Instead, That `70s Show adheres strictly to standard sitcom conventions.The cast has a good chemistry together - by the fourth season they ought to. The diversity of the actors accounts for a large part of the show's appeal with Grace and Kutcher drawing the teenage demographic and established veteran actors like Kurtwood Smith appealing to an older generation who may also watch for nostalgic reasons - a trip down memory lane evokes simpler times. Smith is the show's secret weapon as Eric's gruff, no-nonsense father, Red. He gets some great zingers with his dry, sarcastic remarks. The appeal of these characters is that they are archetypes that anyone can relate to. We've all known or been a jock or a geek or the popular kid.The first disc features an audio commentary on ""Eric's Depression"" by director David Trainer. He does a good job dissecting this particular episode. For example, he points out that there is the main story - Eric's depression over being dumped by Donna - and the counter-story - the gang going to Funland.The third disc features a commentary on ""Class Picture"" again by Trainer. He points out that this episode re-establishes the core relationships between the characters. Also, the show very rarely took place in a class room.Disc four features the bulk of the set's extras. Trainer returns one more time for a commentary on the episode ""Hyde's Birthday."" He talks about Hyde, his backstory and how it informs the character's behaviour. He tends to describe what we are seeing on this track.""Season 4 in 4 Minutes"" condenses the season into a highlight reel.""Making Company: David Trainer on Directing `That `70s Show'."" What he loves about making the show is the sense of company, working with a group of people that gets a long and loves what they are doing. He talks about what makes the show work.""A `70s Flashback: Laura Prepon"" features the actress talking about how she grew up on the show and how she got the role. Prepon also talks about the relationship between Donna and Eric and gets quite emotional when talking about the end of the show.""A `70s Flashback: Mila Kunis"" is similar to Prepon's extra that mixes interview soundbites with lots of clips from the show. She talks about her character and how Jackie is nothing like she is in real life.",4,An entertaining trip...,1147392000,"05 12, 2006",2006,2704,"['Initially', 'disregarded', 'lame', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'knock-off', '70s', 'Show', 'survived', 'more', 'seasons', 'anyone', 'thought', 'possible', 'helped', 'launch', 'careers', 'Topher', 'Grace', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'show', 'credit', ""n't"", 'solely', 'rely', 'kitschy', 'd', 'cor', 'fashion', 'sense', 'decade', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'do', 'sneak', 'cool', 'artifacts', 'mousetrap', 'game', 'Instead', '70s', 'Show', 'strictly', 'standard', 'sitcom', 'conventions.The', 'cast', 'good', 'chemistry', 'together', 'fourth', 'season', 'ought', 'diversity', 'actors', 'accounts', 'large', 'part', 'show', 'appeal', 'Grace', 'Kutcher', 'drawing', 'teenage', 'demographic', 'established', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Kurtwood', 'Smith', 'appealing', 'older', 'generation', 'who', 'may', 'also', 'watch', 'nostalgic', 'reasons', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'simpler', 'times', 'Smith', 'show', 'secret', 'weapon', 'Eric', 'gruff', 'no-nonsense', 'father', 'Red', 'great', 'zingers', 'dry', 'sarcastic', 'remarks', 'appeal', 'characters', 'are', 'archetypes', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', ""'ve"", 'known', 'been', 'jock', 'geek', 'popular', 'kid.The', 'first', 'features', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Eric', 'Depression', 'director', 'David', 'Trainer', 'good', 'job', 'dissecting', 'particular', 'episode', 'example', 'out', 'main', 'story', 'Eric', 'depression', 'being', 'dumped', 'Donna', 'counter-story', 'gang', 'going', 'Funland.The', 'third', 'disc', 'commentary', 'Class', 'Picture', 'again', 'Trainer', 'out', 'episode', 'core', 'relationships', 'characters', 'Also', 'show', 'very', 'rarely', 'took', 'place', 'class', 'room.Disc', 'four', 'bulk', 'set', 'extras', 'Trainer', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'commentary', 'episode', 'Hyde', 'Birthday', 'Hyde', 'backstory', 'how', 'character', 'behaviour', 'describe', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'track', 'Season', '4', '4', 'Minutes', 'season', 'highlight', 'reel', 'Making', 'Company', 'David', 'Trainer', 'Directing', '70s', 'Show', 'What', 'making', 'show', 'sense', 'company', 'working', 'group', 'people', 'long', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'show', 'work', 'A', '70s', 'Flashback', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'actress', 'talking', 'how', 'grew', 'up', 'show', 'how', 'got', 'role', 'Prepon', 'also', 'relationship', 'Donna', 'Eric', 'quite', 'emotional', 'when', 'talking', 'end', 'show', 'A', '70s', 'Flashback', 'Mila', 'Kunis', 'similar', 'Prepon', 'extra', 'mixes', 'interview', 'lots', 'clips', 'show', 'character', 'how', 'Jackie', 'nothing', 'real', 'life']",N/A

All the guys are infatuated with her, much to Donna and Jackie's dismay. Jackie and Donna try to be hotter than Penny, with disasterous results. Kitty, feeling like she's not needed, wants to get a pet.15.) Tornado Prom 2/5/02A tornado is on its way to Point Place and Red and Kitty are stuck in their basement with Bob and Joanne; Eric is stuck with Donna at the radio station; the rest of the gang is stuck at the school during a dance. Kelso is named the Snow King and Jackie can't believe she's only the Snow Queen runner-up.16.) Donna Dates a Kelso 2/5/02Eric and Donna both start dating other people; Jackie sets Donna up with Kelso's older brother Casey, while Eric has his pick of the girls at school after being named Point Place High's most eligible bachelor. Fez thinks that he's finally going to lose his virginity, and looks for a place that he and Rhonda can use for that purpose. Bob becomes rich again and Red buys a Corvette.17.) Kelso's Career 2/12/02Eric doesn't know what to do when Red says 'I love you', so he decides to say it back, but learns that Red was drugged when he said it. Fez buys Rhonda a box of candies for Valentine's day, then can't help but eat them all.

Leo Loves Kitty 2/18/02Hyde tries to teach Fez to drive but Fez damages the car and hurts Leo, who was taking a nap behind the car. While in the hospital Leo falls in love with Kitty and starts showing up at the Formans bearing gifts for her.

Jackie's Cheese Squeeze 2/26/02Eric catches Jackie kissing Todd, her boss, but instead of telling Kelso, he holds it over her head. Jackie decides to tell Kelso about it herself, as well as telling him that Eric knew all about it. Both of their plans backfire on them.

Class Picture 3/19/02While trying to come up with a quote for the yearbook, the gang recalls how they met for the first time. They go through the times when they each met each other, no matter how embarrassing or stupid they were. They also try to work out a saying to put under each of their pictures. Kelso finally comes up with the perfect quote for them all, ""It's been a long, strange journey...in Forman's basement!"" The gang also realizes how strong their friendship is.21.) Prank Day 3/26/02It's Prank Day according to Kelso, who manages to trick his friends twice with his stunts. The guys' attempt to retaliate backfires horribly when Red triggers their prank instead. But rather than venting his wrath on Eric, Red joins the prank war to show the boys how it's done. Meanwhile, Jackie throws an impromptu slumber party to cheer Donna up on her parents' wedding anniversary.22.) Eric's Corvette Caper 4/9/02When Red and Kitty go out of town, Eric takes the Corvette out and lets his date drive. She manages to get it all dirty and Eric scrambles to get it clean in time because his parents are coming home early.

Hyde's Birthday 4/23/02Kitty plans a surprise birthday party for Hyde's 18th birthday. She recruits Jackie and Fez as decorators because of their feminine creativity (much to Donna's annoyance). Eric, Donna, and Kelso decide to steal a street sign for Hyde's present. But Hyde doesn't want to celebrate because he thinks this means he'll have to move out of the Formans' house.24.) That '70s Musical 4/30/02 (100th episode!)Fez fantasizes about several musical numbers featuring himself and the rest of the gang while he gets ready for a school concert.25.) Eric's False Alarm 5/7/02When Eric finds out that Casey is taking Donna to a motel, he decides to show up to make sure she doesn't do anything she'll regret. Bob's divorce from Midge comes through, he mentions marriage to Joanne, who totally freaks out. Naturally, Red and Kitty are called upon to advise their neighbors, but unfortunately they aren't offering the same advice. And Kelso stalks Jackie at the mall to prevent her from kissing anyone else.26.) Everybody Loves Casey 5/14/02Eric confronts Casey about Donna, Kitty wins a year's worth of hot dogs and Kelso breaks up with Jackie.27.) Love, Wisconsin Style (Season Finale) 5/21/02Kitty and Eric go to the Hub after a dentist appointment and catch Donna (who's drunk) skipping school with Casey. Neither Bob nor Joanne can exert any authority over Donna, so a frustrated Red intervenes while everyone watches. Meanwhile, Jackie suggests that Kelso kiss another girl so that they can reconcile. And Hyde and Fez try to decide what to do with some dead fish that they stole.Special Features,That '70s KISS Special the preview show that launched That '70s Show in syndication in the fall of

973402,AEBGZ1YSE8LB7,B000EHSVF0,S. Bacon,"[1, 1]","Mill Creek Entertainment has re-released That '70s Show on DVD at a budget price.==Packaging==Season 4 of That '70s Show is spread across 3 DVDs in individual paper sleeves inside a cheap plastic case. I would recommend upgrading to a basic flip-tray case for about $2.==Audio/Video==The DVDs look and sound great. The presentation suffers a bit (I'd say 8.5-9/10) due to Mill Creek putting 8 or 9 episodes onto each disc, but it's not a deal breaker (for me, anyway).==Contents==That '70s Show was actually filmed in 16:9 widescreen, but framed in 4:3 for broadcast. Mill Creek's DVD release of Season 4, like Season 3 but unlike Seasons 1 and 2, contain an odd mix of framed 4:3 and true 16:9 transfers. (Seasons 1 and 2 were released with all eps in framed 4:3 aspect ratio). 3 episodes have full-length audio commentary.Below is a list of [episode #. Title - aspect ratio / commentary track].Disc 1 (eps 1-9)1. It's a Wonderful Life - 4:32. Eric's Depression - 4:3/Commentary3. Pinciotti vs Forman - 4:34. Hyde Gets A Girl -4:35.

They're priced very inexpensively. The picture quality may not be as good as it could be (due to cramming so many episodes onto each disc), but this is a solid release.",4,That '70s Show Season 4 (Mill Creek Re-release),1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,2310,"['Mill', 'Creek', 'Entertainment', 're-released', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'DVD', 'budget', 'price.==Packaging==Season', '4', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'spread', '3', 'DVDs', 'individual', 'paper', 'sleeves', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'case', 'would', 'recommend', 'upgrading', 'basic', 'flip-tray', 'case', '2.==Audio/Video==The', 'DVDs', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'presentation', 'bit', ""'d"", 'say', '8.5-9/10', 'due', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'putting', '8', '9', 'episodes', 'disc', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker', 'anyway', '.==Contents==That', ""'70s"", 'Show', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', '16:9', 'widescreen', 'framed', '4:3', 'broadcast', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'DVD', 'release', 'Season', '4', 'Season', '3', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'contain', 'odd', 'mix', 'framed', '4:3', 'true', '16:9', 'transfers', 'Seasons', '1', '2', 'were', 'released', 'eps', 'framed', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', '3', 'episodes', 'have', 'full-length', 'audio', 'commentary.Below', 'list', '[', 'episode', 'Title', 'aspect', 'ratio', '/', 'commentary', 'track', ']', '1', 'eps', '1-9', '1', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '4:32', 'Eric', 'Depression', '4:3/Commentary3', 'Pinciotti', 'vs', 'Forman', '4:34', 'Hyde', 'A', 'Girl', '-4:35', 'Bye-bye', 'Basement', '4:36', 'Relapse', '4:37', 'Uncomfortable', 'Ball', 'Stuff', '4:38', 'Donna', 'Story', '4:39.The', 'Forgotten', 'Son', '4:3Disc', '210', 'Red', 'Stacy', '4:311', 'Third', 'Wheel', '4:312', 'Eric', 'Forman', 'Christmas', '16:913', 'Jackie', 'Cheese', '4:314', 'Eric', 'Hot', 'Cousin', '4:315', 'Tornado', 'Prom', '4:316', 'Donna', 'Kelso', '4:317', 'Kelso', 'Career', '4:318', 'Leo', 'Love', 'Kitty', '4:3Disc', '319', 'Jackie', 'Cheese', 'Squeeze', '4:320', 'Class', 'Picture', '4:3/Commentary21', 'Prank', 'Day', '16:922', 'Eric', 'Corvette', 'Caper', '4:323', 'Hyde', 'Birthday', '4:3/Commentary24', '70s', 'Musical', '4:325', 'Eric', 'False', 'Alarm', '4:326', 'Everybody', 'Casey', '4:327', 'Love', 'Wisconsin', 'Style', '4:3BONUS', 'Season', '4', '4', 'Minutes', 'Making', 'Company', 'Interviews', 'David', 'Trainer', 'A', '70s', 'Flashback', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'A', '70s', 'Flashback', 'Mila', 'Kunis==Bonus', 'Features==Season', '4', 'above', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'Season', '4', '4', 'minutes', 'overview', 'interview', 'David', 'Trainer', 'interview', 'Laura', 'Prepon', 'interview', 'Mila', 'Kunis.==Bottom', 'Line==If', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'now-discontinued', 'Season', 'years', 'past', 're-releases', 'are', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', ""'re"", 'priced', 'very', 'inexpensively', 'picture', 'quality', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'cramming', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'disc', 'solid', 'release']",N/A

The story line needs to change for the sake of keeping the show fresh but too much changed in a single season, it seems. Really like the addition of Big Rhonda to more of the episodes - funny character. Bob's new girlfriend, however leaves me wondering which one of the two is Bob much of the time; could they have replaced Midge with a more homely woman? I get the joke and the irony but Bob has had flirtations in past episodes with much more outwardly attractive women (the red head from Midge's feminist group for example) and this seems like a divergence from the character of Bob as we've come to know him. Well, what's done is done. Still love the show but, beginning with this season, the alterations bug me enough to post them publicly and my rating changes from five to four stars.
