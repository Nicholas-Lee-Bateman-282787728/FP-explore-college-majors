He marries the natural beauty Loretta Young (The Bishop's Wife) as a marraige of conveniance as she will be his housekeeper and teacher for his son. Holden and son think lightly of Young and both treat her as a laborer and emotionally harshly as they both miss the first wife/mother. Holden and Young live under the same roof but not the same bedroom and without any physical interaction of any kind (but she is Loretta Young!). Young though plays an independent woman who plans on surival by practicing her own wilderness skills secretly adapting beyond anyone's later belief. But suddenly out of the wilderness steps the king of the masculine leer, Robert Mitchum (Cape Fear) and he immediately recognizes the chemical breakdown between husband and wife and he is ready to fullfill the void for the lucious Young. All this attention to Young awakens Holden who suddenly recognizes the person and beauty of Young and the adventure takes off as Holden and Mitchum become rivals with interceding Indians entering the fray and Young emerges as an independent Lioness.

264598,A1N4OFD1OGTVFI,6301766210,Mr. Dudley J. Tate,"[0, 0]","""Rachel and the Stranger"" made in 1948 is one of the many enjoyablemovies of the 1940's, a time when movies were pure entertainment -light hearted, believable and not offensive.  If you are somewhat tiredof to-day's unrealistic movies and you are looking for a pleasant change,then this movie is for you.Although it is classified as a western, it is not a cowboy western but anearly frontier western set in the days of the early pioneers and like agood book your interest is held to the very end.The story told is simple but absorbing and although there is not anabundance of action scenes, there are excellent performances by atalented cast who play out their roles naturally and convincingly.The cast includes:Loretta Young as Rachel HarveyWilliam Holden as David HarveyRobert Mitchum as Jim FairwaysGary Gray as DaveyLoretta Young is very attractive and a fine actress, whilst William Holdenand Robert Mitchum perform their best as usual.  We should not over-lookthe fact that child actor Gary Gray was outstanding and for those who areinterested in the finer points, Gary Gray beat that other fine child actorBobby Driscoll for the role of Davey and I would add that Gary Gray wasthe ideal choice.  That of course is in itself some achievement.  Gary Graylooks and acts the part well.The story told concerns David Harvey who is suffering a period ofdepression after the loss of his wife and he constantly visits her gravesite  near their cabin where he spends a lot of his time mourning herpassing on.  Things get so bad that he neglects his chores andunfortunately his son.David Harvey has an unattached friend Jim Fairways who occasionallydrops in for a visit to see David and Davey and he is surprised to findone day that David has taken in a bonded woman Rachel to assist withthe housework and to teach his son basic schooling as his wife wouldhave done.  David Harvey is a decent man and treats Rachel well andlater marries her but of course this is really only a marriage ofconvenience.  David shows no real affection towards Rachel and Daveydislikes her mainly due to the fact that she is a bonded woman.This of course all changes when smooth-talking Jim Fairways arrives andtakes an obvious interest in Rachel.  David starts to realize that she meansfar more to him then he first thought and young Davey now thinks betterof her than at first because she has become proficient with a gun andsaves his life.This movie is on VHS tape which was purchased brand new and sealedfrom an Amazon Marketplace supplier.  It is in pristine condition and Ibelieve that it would not look or sound any better on DVD.This movie is a pleasant relief from to-day's nonsense and so-called arthousemovies and it makes you feel good to relax and watch it.Highly recommended.",5,Rachel and the Stranger,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,2764,"['Rachel', 'Stranger', 'made', '1948', 'one', 'many', 'enjoyablemovies', '1940', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'pure', 'entertainment', '-light', 'hearted', 'believable', 'not', 'offensive', 'are', 'somewhat', 'tiredof', 'to-day', 'unrealistic', 'movies', 'are', 'looking', 'pleasant', 'change', 'then', 'movie', 'classified', 'western', 'not', 'cowboy', 'western', 'anearly', 'frontier', 'western', 'set', 'days', 'early', 'pioneers', 'like', 'agood', 'book', 'interest', 'held', 'very', 'end.The', 'story', 'told', 'simple', 'absorbing', 'not', 'anabundance', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'atalented', 'cast', 'who', 'play', 'out', 'roles', 'naturally', 'convincingly.The', 'cast', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Rachel', 'HarveyWilliam', 'Holden', 'David', 'HarveyRobert', 'Mitchum', 'Jim', 'FairwaysGary', 'Gray', 'DaveyLoretta', 'Young', 'very', 'attractive', 'fine', 'actress', 'whilst', 'William', 'Holdenand', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'perform', 'best', 'usual', 'should', 'not', 'over-lookthe', 'fact', 'child', 'actor', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'was', 'outstanding', 'who', 'areinterested', 'finer', 'points', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'beat', 'other', 'fine', 'child', 'actorBobby', 'Driscoll', 'role', 'Davey', 'would', 'add', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'wasthe', 'ideal', 'choice', 'course', 'achievement', 'Gary', 'Graylooks', 'part', 'story', 'told', 'concerns', 'David', 'Harvey', 'who', 'suffering', 'period', 'ofdepression', 'loss', 'wife', 'constantly', 'gravesite', 'cabin', 'where', 'lot', 'time', 'mourning', 'herpassing', 'Things', 'get', 'so', 'bad', 'chores', 'andunfortunately', 'son.David', 'Harvey', 'unattached', 'friend', 'Jim', 'Fairways', 'who', 'occasionallydrops', 'visit', 'see', 'David', 'Davey', 'surprised', 'findone', 'day', 'David', 'taken', 'bonded', 'woman', 'Rachel', 'assist', 'withthe', 'housework', 'teach', 'son', 'basic', 'schooling', 'wife', 'wouldhave', 'done', 'David', 'Harvey', 'decent', 'man', 'treats', 'Rachel', 'well', 'andlater', 'course', 'really', 'only', 'marriage', 'ofconvenience', 'David', 'real', 'affection', 'towards', 'Rachel', 'Daveydislikes', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'bonded', 'woman.This', 'course', 'changes', 'when', 'smooth-talking', 'Jim', 'Fairways', 'andtakes', 'obvious', 'interest', 'Rachel', 'David', 'realize', 'meansfar', 'more', 'then', 'first', 'thought', 'young', 'Davey', 'now', 'first', 'become', 'proficient', 'gun', 'life.This', 'movie', 'VHS', 'tape', 'was', 'purchased', 'brand', 'new', 'Amazon', 'Marketplace', 'supplier', 'pristine', 'condition', 'Ibelieve', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'sound', 'better', 'DVD.This', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'relief', 'to-day', 'nonsense', 'so-called', 'arthousemovies', 'feel', 'good', 'relax', 'watch', 'it.Highly', 'recommended']",Rachel and the Stranger VHS

Rachel And The Stranger may be the only movie to explore that topic, though lightly.The whole plot is based on antiquated mores, and all the more interesting for it.  It starts out like The Courtship of Eddie's Father in the wild west.  William Holden (Bridge on the River Kwai) is a widower trying to raise his young son, Gary Gray (The Next Voice You Hear), at a cabin in the wilderness.  On the advice of the parson in a nearby town, he marrys a bond slave played by Loretta Young (The Bishop's Wife), buying her out of servitude.  But the marriage is only for convenience, to make the living arrangements proper; he still treats the woman as a slave, requiring her to cook and keep the house and mother the boy, and sleep in the loft alone.  But when an old family friend, Robert Mitchum (Night of the Hunter), passes through hunting, and shows an interest in the girl, jealously brings out the husband in Holden.The script is engaging, the actors charming, as with such classics as Shane, Of Human Hearts, Friendly Persuasion, etc.  This was probably Mitchum's first singing role.  Loretta Young is beautiful as ever as the sympathetic slave, and Holden plays the widower with unresolved feelings just right to make the whole thing work.Recommended if you like the above mentioned films, and may be of interest to history students as well.

A trapper, friend offers to buy the woman and set her free, and a jealous rivalry ensues.Filmed on location in a cabin in the woods alongside a river in hostile Indian country.A film about relationships; a little action; a relaxed pace, but enjoyable.",4,Pioneer widower buys a bond-servant to mother his son.,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,804,"['Surprisingly', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'can', 'sing', 'fun', 'little', 'song', 'friend', 'wife', 'son', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.Back', '1700', 'poor', 'people', 'coming', 'Europe', 'U.S.', 'paid', 'ticket', 'ship', 'indenturing', 'bond-servants', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'sometimes', 'as', 'long', '7-years', 'story', 'widowed', 'man', 'female', 'bond-servant', 'be', 'mother', 'son', 'bond-servant', 'endless', 'chores', 'coldness', 'rather', 'giving', 'her', 'freedom', 'treating', 'wife', 'trapper', 'friend', 'offers', 'buy', 'woman', 'set', 'free', 'jealous', 'rivalry', 'ensues.Filmed', 'location', 'cabin', 'woods', 'river', 'hostile', 'Indian', 'country.A', 'film', 'relationships', 'little', 'action', 'relaxed', 'pace', 'enjoyable']",Rachel and the Stranger VHS

264606,A37S3ACL57LN62,6301766210,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[8, 8]","Rachel and the Stranger is like Sarah Plain and Tall, the children's story. It concerns a man (William Holden) and his son (Gary Gray) after his wife Susan dies. He realizes that it is proper for his son to be raised by a woman and sets out to get a new wife (Loretta Young). He frees Rachel from servitude by marrying her, but she is basically treated as a maid in her new home. Her husband's traveling friend (Robert Mitchum) serves to integrate her into the family, but in the process begins a territorial fued between the two men for Rachel's affections.Although the action isn't wildly exciting, the characters are interesting enough to carry the story along nicely. Young and Mitchum in particular contribute. Young uses her eyes and a tranquil personality to convey her character; she has much fewer lines than one might expect. Mitchum is rugged and charismatic, the jell that holds the family together. He also has quite a nice voice, with a deep Bing Crosby-esque quality about it that makes him all the more appealing.",4,Rachel the Slave,1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,1029,"['Rachel', 'Stranger', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'children', 'story', 'man', 'William', 'Holden', 'son', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'wife', 'Susan', 'proper', 'son', 'be', 'raised', 'woman', 'out', 'get', 'new', 'wife', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Rachel', 'servitude', 'marrying', 'basically', 'treated', 'maid', 'new', 'home', 'husband', 'traveling', 'friend', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'integrate', 'family', 'process', 'territorial', 'fued', 'two', 'men', 'Rachel', 'action', ""n't"", 'wildly', 'exciting', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'carry', 'story', 'nicely', 'Young', 'Mitchum', 'particular', 'contribute', 'Young', 'eyes', 'tranquil', 'personality', 'convey', 'character', 'much', 'fewer', 'lines', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'Mitchum', 'rugged', 'charismatic', 'jell', 'family', 'together', 'also', 'quite', 'nice', 'voice', 'deep', 'Bing', 'Crosby-esque', 'quality', 'more', 'appealing']",Rachel and the Stranger VHS
264607,ACT1EPHFS9E7V,6301766210,true crime reader,"[16, 16]",This is one of my favorite movies. I really like loretta young. She plays a bond woman who is bought to help a man out with the work on the farm & to take care of his young son. He does marry her but only because it is the right thing to do. It is in name only. His first wife died. Then along comes Robert Mitchum. He treats Rachael like a woman & it opens her husbands eyes. He also starts to see her as his woman & the boy is starting to like her also because Jim likes her. They even fight over her.,5,love it,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,503,"['one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'really', 'loretta', 'young', 'bond', 'woman', 'who', 'bought', 'help', 'man', 'out', 'work', 'farm', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'son', 'marry', 'only', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'name', 'only', 'first', 'wife', 'died', 'Then', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Rachael', 'woman', 'eyes', 'also', 'see', 'woman', 'boy', 'starting', 'also', 'Jim', 'even', 'fight']",Rachel and the Stranger VHS
