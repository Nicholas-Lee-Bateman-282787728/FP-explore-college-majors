1071706,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B000PITGIO,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 2]","Both creepy and engaging, this time-distorting, psychologically driven ghost story weaves our protagonists' tortured past into their present with a shockingly smart script.  Definitely the best killer mirror movie on the market, and a superior horror film overall as well!POLARIZED REVIEWS: Other reviews' opinions seem to vary wildly, ranging from calling it poorly acted and carelessly written to praising it as fantastic across the board.  I fell on the &#34;pro&#34; side of the argument and feel that those who were disappointed don't like to think about their horror (during the movie) as much as I do.  After all, it is no rollercoaster nor is it really &#34;exciting,&#34; so I see how some may bore of this.Horror is a genre characterized by one-dimensional characters typified by hardly serviceably acting their way through flat writing to occupy the time until they drink, vandalize, have premarital sex, or do whatever it is that justifies their upcoming death.  Despite this, filmmakers press on and we find the occasional pleasant surprise in The Cabin in the Woods (2012), The Conjuring (2013), or other films in which people actually cared about more than simply turning a profit and brought us new spins on classic tropes and even some entirely original ideas.  I feel that Oculus is one of those refreshing films.  Its scares number low and it's gore is nothing special, but the acting is phenomenal and the story execution is captivating, although tough to follow at times.  More a product of deep and undeniable intrigue than dread, the tension mounts and really never loosens its grip until the closing credits are cast down the screen.Tim (Brenton Thwaites; The Signal, Maleficent) and Kaylie (Karen Gillan; Doctor Who) had a seriously messed up childhood.  As tweens, they endured a disturbing experience involving their parents' murder and a demonic mirror which resulted in young Tim being held responsible and placed in a psychiatric care facility until his 21st birthday (ten years later).Not a day after his release to begin his &#34;recovery,&#34; Kaylie makes it readily apparent that everything he has been conditioned to understand as psychosis and repression has remained, much to his surprise, very real to her.  Kaylie, in fact, remains absolutely convinced that her parents' deaths were caused by The Lasser Glass, a centuries old antique mirror housing a malevolent force.  Obsessed with proving to the world the evil nature of this supernatural mirror, Kaylie reconstructs the item's history and creates an evidence-documenting scenario festooned with failsafes to circumvent the antique's hallucinatory mind-bending wiles.  After obtaining this proof, they would destroy it&#8230;a task which has proven strangely difficult.  Kaylie's elaborate documentarian approach smacks of Poltergeist 2 (1986), and she leaves little room for error.Writer/director Mike Flanagan (Absentia) makes frequent and careful use of flashbacks.  Kaylie insists that she recalls their terrifying past correctly and Tim resists, contrastingly rationalizing her claims with psychological babble.  As Tim and Kaylie's tortured past unravels before our eyes, that same past seems to slowly take hold of their present as they fight this evil reflective entity.Any good horror movie pays close attention to lighting as much for mood as for execution.  Smart cinematography, deliberately distracting lighting and scene-cut transitions mislead our own sense of time along with our protagonists'.  Our notion of the present becomes ever distorted and with every step that Tim comes closer to believing his sister's claims, their horrific past seems to eerily converge with their perhaps inevitable future as hallucinations distort the present.  It's easy to get lost in it, but I found that to be intentional and engaging.Everyone did a solid job with their roles. Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff (Riddick, White Noise 2, Battlestar Galactica) play the parents and they really own their mania.  I was particularly shocked by the committed performances by Garrett Ryan (Insidious Chapter 2) and Annalise Basso as the younger Tim and Kaylie, who get ample screen time in the flashbacks.  If anyone left something to be desired, it would be Brenton Thwaites' portrayal of the most complicated character Tim.Oculus is a movie you can't trust.  As the story persists and the timeline is distorted we are as readily confused as the protagonists&#8230;and this is a good thing!  It's clever, it keeps us guessing, and there's nothing like it.  You may be left with more questions than answers.  But this is a quality of deliberately disorienting mystery rather than plot-holed writing.This is a must see!",5,"A clever, engaging, hypnotic, creepy, psychologically-driven ghost story about an evil mirror",1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2014,4706,"['creepy', 'engaging', 'time-distorting', 'psychologically', 'driven', 'ghost', 'story', 'protagonists', 'tortured', 'present', 'shockingly', 'smart', 'script', 'Definitely', 'best', 'killer', 'mirror', 'movie', 'market', 'superior', 'horror', 'film', 'overall', 'as', 'well', 'POLARIZED', 'REVIEWS', 'Other', 'reviews', 'opinions', 'seem', 'vary', 'wildly', 'ranging', 'calling', 'poorly', 'acted', 'carelessly', 'written', 'praising', 'fantastic', 'board', 'fell', '34', 'pro', '34', 'side', 'argument', 'feel', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'think', 'horror', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'rollercoaster', 'really', '34', 'exciting', '34', 'so', 'see', 'how', 'may', 'bore', 'this.Horror', 'genre', 'characterized', 'one-dimensional', 'characters', 'typified', 'hardly', 'serviceably', 'acting', 'way', 'flat', 'writing', 'occupy', 'time', 'drink', 'vandalize', 'have', 'premarital', 'sex', 'do', 'whatever', 'justifies', 'upcoming', 'death', 'filmmakers', 'press', 'find', 'occasional', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Cabin', 'Woods', '2012', 'Conjuring', '2013', 'other', 'films', 'people', 'actually', 'cared', 'more', 'simply', 'turning', 'profit', 'brought', 'new', 'spins', 'classic', 'tropes', 'even', 'entirely', 'original', 'ideas', 'feel', 'Oculus', 'one', 'refreshing', 'films', 'scares', 'number', 'low', 'gore', 'nothing', 'special', 'acting', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'execution', 'captivating', 'tough', 'follow', 'times', 'More', 'product', 'deep', 'undeniable', 'intrigue', 'dread', 'tension', 'mounts', 'really', 'never', 'grip', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'cast', 'screen.Tim', 'Brenton', 'Thwaites', 'Signal', 'Maleficent', 'Kaylie', 'Karen', 'Gillan', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'had', 'seriously', 'messed', 'up', 'childhood', 'tweens', 'endured', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'involving', 'parents', 'murder', 'demonic', 'mirror', 'resulted', 'young', 'Tim', 'being', 'held', 'responsible', 'placed', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'facility', '21st', 'birthday', 'ten', 'years', 'later', '.Not', 'day', 'release', 'begin', '34', 'recovery', '34', 'Kaylie', 'readily', 'apparent', 'everything', 'been', 'conditioned', 'understand', 'psychosis', 'repression', 'remained', 'much', 'surprise', 'very', 'real', 'Kaylie', 'fact', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'parents', 'deaths', 'were', 'caused', 'Lasser', 'Glass', 'centuries', 'old', 'antique', 'mirror', 'housing', 'malevolent', 'force', 'Obsessed', 'proving', 'world', 'evil', 'nature', 'supernatural', 'mirror', 'Kaylie', 'item', 'history', 'evidence-documenting', 'scenario', 'festooned', 'failsafes', 'circumvent', 'antique', 'hallucinatory', 'mind-bending', 'wiles', 'obtaining', 'proof', 'would', 'destroy', '8230', 'task', 'proven', 'strangely', 'difficult', 'Kaylie', 'elaborate', 'documentarian', 'approach', 'smacks', 'Poltergeist', '2', '1986', 'little', 'room', 'error.Writer/director', 'Mike', 'Flanagan', 'Absentia', 'frequent', 'careful', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'Kaylie', 'terrifying', 'correctly', 'Tim', 'resists', 'contrastingly', 'rationalizing', 'claims', 'psychological', 'babble', 'Tim', 'Kaylie', 'tortured', 'past', 'unravels', 'eyes', 'same', 'past', 'slowly', 'take', 'hold', 'present', 'fight', 'evil', 'reflective', 'entity.Any', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'close', 'attention', 'lighting', 'as', 'much', 'mood', 'execution', 'Smart', 'cinematography', 'deliberately', 'distracting', 'lighting', 'scene-cut', 'transitions', 'mislead', 'own', 'sense', 'time', 'protagonists', 'notion', 'present', 'becomes', 'ever', 'distorted', 'step', 'Tim', 'closer', 'believing', 'sister', 'claims', 'horrific', 'past', 'eerily', 'converge', 'perhaps', 'inevitable', 'future', 'hallucinations', 'distort', 'present', 'easy', 'get', 'lost', 'found', 'be', 'intentional', 'engaging.Everyone', 'did', 'solid', 'job', 'roles', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'Katee', 'Sackhoff', 'Riddick', 'White', 'Noise', '2', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'play', 'parents', 'really', 'own', 'mania', 'was', 'particularly', 'shocked', 'committed', 'performances', 'Garrett', 'Ryan', 'Insidious', 'Chapter', '2', 'Annalise', 'Basso', 'younger', 'Tim', 'Kaylie', 'who', 'get', 'ample', 'screen', 'time', 'flashbacks', 'anyone', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'would', 'be', 'Brenton', 'Thwaites', 'portrayal', 'most', 'complicated', 'character', 'Tim.Oculus', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'story', 'persists', 'timeline', 'distorted', 'are', 'readily', 'confused', 'protagonists', '8230', 'good', 'thing', 'clever', 'guessing', 'nothing', 'may', 'be', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'quality', 'deliberately', 'disorienting', 'mystery', 'rather', 'plot-holed', 'writing.This', 'must', 'see']",N/A
1071707,A1DWUPXRD1HN1B,B000PITGIO,Kurt Russell,"[1, 2]","While the film is undeniably assembled in an original and inventive manner, the movie is ultimately a failure for its lack of scares and its inability to cohesively tie all its narrative strings together.The movie tells the story of a family's dark tragedy, but presents their plight in two concurrent narratives: the past and the present. Nimbly jumping between both eras, the movie nicely splices together the parallel timelines to highlight their eerie similarities. The older version of the protagonist will enter a room and suddenly become her younger self. Certainly the editing and writing from that perspective elevate this film to a more artistic affair.Unfortunately, that's where the cleverness stops. Were this an indie art-house film, the nonlinear efforts might be more laudable. But as a horror film, it cannot salvage an otherwise weak outing. Despite the film's intelligent framing, the story proper devolves into trite and uninteresting cliches from the horror genre. Why the heroes are even embarking of their quest makes no sense either. Though the heroine looks directly at a camera to literally explain her motivations and mission, the &#34;experiment&#34; they conduct is extremely contrived and nonsensical, a poor excuse to drive the narrative. The final resolution is quite tame and unsatisfying too, infuriating those who invested themselves in getting to the truth of the mystery.A final affront comes from its misleading R-rating. As most commercial horror films are sanitized with a PG-13 version to draw the largest theater-going audience, this film is inexplicably rated R. However, the dearth of scares and fright does not warrant this more adult rating, as the film still feels like a watered-down PG-13. It's odd enough to almost feel like the marketers were intentionally mislabeling the film to draw in the more hardcore horror fans.",2,Smart editing is not scary,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,1870,"['film', 'undeniably', 'assembled', 'original', 'inventive', 'manner', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'failure', 'lack', 'scares', 'inability', 'cohesively', 'tie', 'narrative', 'strings', 'together.The', 'movie', 'story', 'family', 'dark', 'tragedy', 'plight', 'two', 'concurrent', 'narratives', 'past', 'present', 'Nimbly', 'jumping', 'eras', 'movie', 'nicely', 'together', 'parallel', 'timelines', 'highlight', 'eerie', 'similarities', 'older', 'version', 'protagonist', 'will', 'enter', 'room', 'suddenly', 'become', 'younger', 'self', 'Certainly', 'editing', 'writing', 'perspective', 'elevate', 'film', 'more', 'artistic', 'affair.Unfortunately', 'where', 'cleverness', 'stops', 'Were', 'indie', 'art-house', 'film', 'nonlinear', 'efforts', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'laudable', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'salvage', 'otherwise', 'weak', 'outing', 'film', 'intelligent', 'framing', 'story', 'proper', 'trite', 'uninteresting', 'cliches', 'horror', 'genre', 'Why', 'heroes', 'are', 'even', 'embarking', 'quest', 'sense', 'either', 'heroine', 'directly', 'camera', 'literally', 'explain', 'motivations', 'mission', '34', 'experiment', '34', 'conduct', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'nonsensical', 'poor', 'excuse', 'drive', 'narrative', 'final', 'resolution', 'quite', 'tame', 'unsatisfying', 'too', 'infuriating', 'who', 'invested', 'getting', 'truth', 'mystery.A', 'final', 'affront', 'misleading', 'R-rating', 'most', 'commercial', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'sanitized', 'PG-13', 'version', 'draw', 'largest', 'theater-going', 'audience', 'film', 'inexplicably', 'rated', 'R.', 'However', 'dearth', 'scares', 'fright', 'not', 'warrant', 'more', 'adult', 'rating', 'film', 'still', 'watered-down', 'PG-13', 'odd', 'enough', 'almost', 'feel', 'marketers', 'were', 'intentionally', 'mislabeling', 'film', 'draw', 'more', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fans']",N/A

1071709,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B000PITGIO,Paul Donovan,"[0, 2]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Oculus&#8221; (USA, 2014)1. This smart, dark film was quietly released in theaters with almost no publicity. It had only been seen at a couple of film festivals. The movie takes bits of &#8220;The Shining&#8221;, and mixes them into the cursed-object/haunted house genre.2. This movie was obviously influenced by &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221;. But &#8220;Oculus&#8221; is a much more intelligent version.3. It&#8217;s about a young man, Tim, who was sent to a mental institution because of a childhood trauma where his father tried to kill his family. Tim is released and goes to join his sister Kaylie.4. Kaylie is convinced that what happened to their family is because of a demonic mirror that was hanging in their house. She tries to get Tim to help her face the demon and destroy it. But Tim is convinced that there was nothing supernatural going on. He believes that they were exposed to a real trauma, and that their minds converted it into a story of demons so they wouldn&#8217;t have to face the truth about their father.5. Tim tries to humor Kaylie&#8217;s plan, and also to get her to understand she has false memories of the event. They spend the evening in the house with the mirror, and the movie begins to flip back and forth between the present night and the night of the trauma.6. The movie weaves between present and past, the supernatural and psychological. It really plays with your mind so that you aren&#8217;t quite sure what&#8217;s going on and who to believe.7. The movie is shot and acted very well, especially for an independent horror film. It has a great creepy and tense mood that ratchets itself up steadily, until the ending that made a lot of people in the audience (including me) gasp.8. This movie does move much more slowly than other horror films, though. By adding in some actual science and psychology, some horror fans are going to find this movie slow and boring.9. This is a thinking person&#8217;s horror film. If you like a plot that you can&#8217;t predict from the trailer, if you don&#8217;t need mindless jump scares every ten minutes, and are willing to expand your definition of a &#8220;horror&#8221; movie a little bit, this is a great piece of work.",4,More than your typical jump scares,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,2243,"['Nine', 'Things', 'Movie', '8220', 'Oculus', '8221', 'USA', '2014', '1', 'smart', 'dark', 'film', 'was', 'quietly', 'released', 'theaters', 'almost', 'publicity', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'seen', 'couple', 'film', 'festivals', 'movie', 'bits', '8220', 'Shining', '8221', 'mixes', 'cursed-object/haunted', 'house', 'genre.2', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'influenced', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', '8220', 'Oculus', '8221', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'version.3', '8217', 's', 'young', 'man', 'Tim', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'childhood', 'trauma', 'where', 'father', 'tried', 'kill', 'family', 'Tim', 'released', 'join', 'sister', 'Kaylie.4', 'Kaylie', 'convinced', 'what', 'happened', 'family', 'demonic', 'mirror', 'was', 'hanging', 'house', 'get', 'Tim', 'help', 'face', 'demon', 'destroy', 'Tim', 'convinced', 'was', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'going', 'were', 'exposed', 'real', 'trauma', 'minds', 'converted', 'story', 'demons', 'wouldn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'face', 'truth', 'father.5', 'Tim', 'humor', 'Kaylie', '8217', 's', 'plan', 'also', 'get', 'understand', 'false', 'memories', 'event', 'spend', 'evening', 'house', 'mirror', 'movie', 'flip', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'night', 'night', 'trauma.6', 'movie', 'present', 'past', 'supernatural', 'psychological', 'really', 'mind', 'aren', '8217', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', '8217', 'going', 'who', 'believe.7', 'movie', 'shot', 'acted', 'very', 'well', 'especially', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', 'great', 'creepy', 'tense', 'mood', 'up', 'steadily', 'ending', 'made', 'lot', 'people', 'audience', 'including', 'gasp.8', 'movie', 'move', 'much', 'more', 'slowly', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'though', 'adding', 'actual', 'science', 'psychology', 'horror', 'fans', 'are', 'going', 'find', 'movie', 'slow', 'boring.9', 'thinking', 'person', '8217', 'horror', 'film', 'like', 'plot', 'can', '8217', 'predict', 'trailer', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'mindless', 'jump', 'scares', 'ten', 'minutes', 'are', 'willing', 'expand', 'definition', '8220', 'horror', '8221', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'great', 'piece', 'work']",N/A

Graham's final descent seems a bit too accelerated, the little set cluttered -- a more spartan approach would have been spookier (a la 2001) -- and, most of all, I wish Flanagan had resisted the temptation to ""monsterize"" his film.

1071711,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000PITGIO,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","OCULUS is a kind of cool movie.  It features some intricate editing, even for a genre that relies heavily on editing.  It has a fairly straightforward premise and doesn&#8217;t spend a lot of time messing around with filler before the creepy stuff starts to happen.Unfortunately, it mostly forgets to be scary.  So much work and thought went into the film, but it&#8217;s more wrapped up in its own cleverness.  It is also poorly cast and performed, which makes it harder to overlook those moments when a character does something stupid, as most characters in horror stories must do at some point or another in order to further the plot.OCULUS tells the story of one family&#8217;s haunting by a mirror.  Mom and Dad move into a new house with their young kids (12 year old daughter, 10 year old son).  The house itself is fine&#8230;but the ornate, large, antique mirror that dad buys to put in his home office is NOT fine.  Soon, the influence of the entity in the mirror has mom and dad acting crazy, and the kids are the unfortunately victims.  Then years later, sis manages to track the mirror down again, and brings it back to the old family home to see if she can defeat the mirror and the entity within.  She recruits her understandably reluctant brother to help her.  A series of unfortunate events ensue.What OCULUS does really well is bounce back and forth between the scenes from the past and the &#8220;current day&#8221; scenes.  They become more enmeshed as the events unfold, and the fancy camera work and editing get more and more elaborate.  Yet none of it is confusing&#8230;the plot is very easy to follow, no matter how twisty it gets.  I appreciated that effort, clearly done on a low budget.  The film required considerable pre-planning and that pays off well.Sadly, the resulting work doesn&#8217;t deliver what I want from a horror film&#8230;good, old-fashioned scares.  I want to be creeped-out by my horror films.  I understand that the plot may develop holes or just general silliness, but a movie that makes me hold my breath, or scrunch my eyes shut, or speed my respiration will make me forgive clumsy problems.  Whether a PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, or SINISTER or (a personal favorite) THE RING&#8230;these films first and foremost scared me.  Sometimes the entire film is creepy.  Sometimes it may just be a few memorable scenes (the recent THE CONJURING fits that bill.  Much of the film is frankly mundane, but there are a few absolutely effective sequences that make it all worthwhile).  But OCULUS essentially has no moments like this.  Yes, occasionally there is a brief jump scare, and there is one squirm inducing moment involving fingernails&#8230;but I never had the feeling of being creeped-out.I think in large part, that sort of feeling comes when we feel some sympathy or connection to the characters.  And this requires some convincing acting.  The movies I mention above all have effective acting.  Sometimes you&#8217;ve got an experienced star simply delivering solid work (whether Naomi Watts or Ethan Hawke or Lily Taylor) or you just have unknowns who are able to muster up good work, as in the better moments of the PARANORMAL&#8230; films.  But OCULUS features bland performances from Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites (as the grown up kids).  Gillan, in particular, is not only bad but downright annoying.  Her character is extremely unlikable, and this makes it very difficult to look beyond the fact that the &#8220;experiment&#8221; she&#8217;s performing with the mirror is so blatantly and stupidly ill-advised that she deserves whatever happens to her.  That is not a good basis for sympathizing with a lead character.  The parents are played by Katee Sackhoff (a striking figure, but not a good actor, really) and Rory Cochrane, who has no business being in show business.

1071714,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000PITGIO,Thomas M. Sipos,"[7, 11]","[...]Running at 32 minutes, OCULUS is a masterpiece of minimalist horror, using little more than one actor, a room, and a mirror to create a sense of unease that slowly builds into terror.  Its story concerns occult researcher Timothy Alan Russel (played by Scott Graham) investigating a reputedly haunted mirror with both his high-tech paraphernalia (cameras, recorders, phones, alarms, IV tubes) and live subjects (a plant and a dog).  But the mirror holds secrets that result in Russel's physical and mental deterioration over the course of the film.Says director/co-writer Mike Flanagan, ""I was disheartened that many modern horror trends lean more toward gross-out comedies than real horror.  Once, drunk at a party, I said to [co-writer] Jeff Seidman that a competent director could make a truly frightening film without any genre requirements that Hollywood is leaning on these days.  For instance, doing away with the over-the-top visuals and returning to the lesson of Jaws -- it's not what you see that scares you most, it's what you don't.  And setting the film in a bright, sterile environment rather than in the overused and over stylized darkness and shadows.  We got to talking about it, and once we hit on the 'one guy alone in a bright room' idea, we got real excited trying to make it scary.""Such a conceit relies heavily upon the actor playing that ""one guy,"" and Flanagan was well served by Graham.  ""I'd worked with Scott Graham on my third feature, GHOSTS OF HAMILTON STREET,"" said Flanagan. ""He was cast in that film via an open casting call in Baltimore and did a fantastic job.  Knowing we wouldn't have much money for OCULUS, and not wanting to gamble on an actor I didn't know for such a crucial role, I told him it was his if he wanted it, and was willing to fly out to L.A. for a week.""The ""bright room"" was the back room of a Venice Beach coffee shop.  ""The owner was a freelance photographer and artist, and that was her studio,"" said Flanagan. ""We found them through an ad on Craigslist and paid a very low rental rate for the four day shoot.  It was a terrific spot, but not air conditioned.  The temperature was a constant 110 degrees.  [Note to aspiring filmmakers: film lights are hot!]  And we had to stop shooting whenever they made espresso out front, and during peak business hours as we could hear the customers ordering coffee.""OCULUS builds much of it tension by incessantly and erratically altering our viewpoint of events, sometimes depicting events directly, sometimes through one of Russel's monitors.  The technique also helps alleviate the potential monotony of seeing the same guy in the same room for a half hour.""We shot on a Sony HDR-FX1 and the consumer cameras (all 1-chip DVs) that are set up in the room as props,"" said Flanagan.  ""Rather than cut directly to these consumer cameras' footage, I thought filming the monitors themselves would look more authentic.""Complementing OCULUS's multiple visuals is a layered soundtrack of alarms and ring tones, real and imagined, that bombard Graham as the mirror erodes his sanity.  ""Our sound was captured using a wireless lav mic under Scott's shirt and a boom on another channel as a backup,"" said Flanagan.  ""It was very thin, clean sound.  All the other noises (alarms, phones, atmosphere, voices, etc.) were done in post, using a combination of the SmartSound, ambient library, and foley.  The sound design took longer than the picture edit.  Much longer.""Contributing to the production's hardships was its small crew.  ""The room was so small, we could only fit about three people in there at a time while shooting,"" said Flanagan.  ""I shot the film myself, not because I think much of myself as a DP, but because it was economical.  The sound was tethered to the camera, and I watched the levels in the eyepiece for peaking.  In retrospect, I wish I had a DP.  This was the first time I've directed without one.  I don't think I'll do that again.""And there will be another film.  OCULUS is subtitled: ""Chapter 3, The Man With The Plan.""  Explains Flanagan, ""This short is just one installment of an anthology about the mirror.  We outlined nine stories, of which this is the third.  When it came to shoot, we looked for the story that'd be the most realistic for our budget and also best orient the audience to the 'legend' of the mirror.  The idea is to shoot one 'Chapter' a year, and eventually combine the first three into a feature film.""Mike Flanagan graduated Towson University's film program in Baltimore.  He has directed for ESPN, Discovery, and the National Lampoon Network's The Gleib Show.  He's completed three feature films.",5,Best Horror Short Film -- 2006 Tabloid Witch Awards,1177459200,"04 25, 2007",2007,4645,"['[', ']', 'Running', '32', 'minutes', 'OCULUS', 'masterpiece', 'minimalist', 'horror', 'using', 'little', 'more', 'one', 'actor', 'room', 'mirror', 'create', 'sense', 'unease', 'slowly', 'terror', 'story', 'concerns', 'researcher', 'Timothy', 'Alan', 'Russel', 'played', 'Scott', 'Graham', 'investigating', 'reputedly', 'haunted', 'mirror', 'high-tech', 'paraphernalia', 'cameras', 'recorders', 'phones', 'alarms', 'IV', 'tubes', 'live', 'subjects', 'plant', 'dog', 'mirror', 'secrets', 'result', 'Russel', 'physical', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'course', 'film.Says', 'director/co-writer', 'Mike', 'Flanagan', 'was', 'disheartened', 'many', 'modern', 'horror', 'trends', 'lean', 'more', 'gross-out', 'comedies', 'real', 'horror', 'Once', 'drunk', 'party', 'said', '[', 'co-writer', ']', 'Jeff', 'Seidman', 'competent', 'director', 'could', 'make', 'truly', 'frightening', 'film', 'genre', 'requirements', 'Hollywood', 'leaning', 'days', 'instance', 'doing', 'away', 'over-the-top', 'visuals', 'returning', 'lesson', 'Jaws', 'not', 'what', 'see', 'most', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'setting', 'film', 'bright', 'sterile', 'environment', 'rather', 'overused', 'stylized', 'darkness', 'shadows', 'got', 'talking', 'once', 'hit', ""'one"", 'guy', 'alone', 'bright', 'room', 'idea', 'got', 'real', 'excited', 'trying', 'make', 'scary', 'Such', 'conceit', 'heavily', 'actor', 'playing', 'one', 'guy', 'Flanagan', 'was', 'well', 'served', 'Graham', ""'d"", 'worked', 'Scott', 'Graham', 'third', 'feature', 'GHOSTS', 'OF', 'HAMILTON', 'STREET', 'said', 'Flanagan', 'was', 'cast', 'film', 'open', 'casting', 'call', 'Baltimore', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Knowing', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'money', 'OCULUS', 'not', 'wanting', 'gamble', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'such', 'crucial', 'role', 'told', 'was', 'wanted', 'was', 'willing', 'fly', 'out', 'L.A.', 'week', 'bright', 'room', 'was', 'back', 'room', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'coffee', 'shop', 'owner', 'was', 'freelance', 'photographer', 'artist', 'was', 'studio', 'said', 'Flanagan', 'found', 'ad', 'Craigslist', 'paid', 'very', 'low', 'rental', 'rate', 'four', 'day', 'shoot', 'was', 'terrific', 'spot', 'not', 'air', 'conditioned', 'temperature', 'was', 'constant', '110', 'degrees', '[', 'Note', 'aspiring', 'filmmakers', 'film', 'lights', 'are', 'hot', ']', 'had', 'stop', 'shooting', 'whenever', 'made', 'espresso', 'front', 'peak', 'business', 'hours', 'could', 'hear', 'customers', 'ordering', 'coffee', 'OCULUS', 'much', 'tension', 'incessantly', 'erratically', 'altering', 'viewpoint', 'events', 'sometimes', 'depicting', 'events', 'directly', 'sometimes', 'one', 'Russel', 'monitors', 'technique', 'also', 'alleviate', 'potential', 'monotony', 'seeing', 'same', 'guy', 'same', 'room', 'half', 'hour', 'shot', 'Sony', 'HDR-FX1', 'consumer', 'cameras', '1-chip', 'DVs', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'room', 'props', 'said', 'Flanagan', 'Rather', 'cut', 'directly', 'consumer', 'cameras', 'footage', 'thought', 'filming', 'monitors', 'would', 'look', 'more', 'authentic', 'Complementing', 'OCULUS', 'multiple', 'visuals', 'layered', 'soundtrack', 'alarms', 'ring', 'tones', 'real', 'imagined', 'bombard', 'Graham', 'mirror', 'sanity', 'sound', 'was', 'captured', 'using', 'wireless', 'lav', 'mic', 'Scott', 'shirt', 'boom', 'channel', 'backup', 'said', 'Flanagan', 'was', 'very', 'thin', 'clean', 'sound', 'other', 'noises', 'alarms', 'phones', 'atmosphere', 'voices', 'etc', 'were', 'done', 'post', 'using', 'combination', 'SmartSound', 'ambient', 'library', 'foley', 'sound', 'design', 'took', 'longer', 'picture', 'edit', 'Much', 'longer', 'Contributing', 'production', 'hardships', 'was', 'small', 'crew', 'room', 'was', 'so', 'small', 'could', 'only', 'fit', 'three', 'people', 'time', 'shooting', 'said', 'Flanagan', 'shot', 'film', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'DP', 'was', 'economical', 'sound', 'was', 'tethered', 'camera', 'watched', 'levels', 'eyepiece', 'peaking', 'retrospect', 'wish', 'had', 'DP', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'directed', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'do', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'OCULUS', 'subtitled', 'Chapter', '3', 'Man', 'Plan', 'Flanagan', 'short', 'just', 'one', 'installment', 'anthology', 'mirror', 'outlined', 'nine', 'stories', 'third', 'When', 'came', 'shoot', 'looked', 'story', ""'d"", 'be', 'most', 'realistic', 'budget', 'also', 'best', 'orient', 'audience', ""'legend"", 'mirror', 'idea', 'shoot', 'one', ""'Chapter"", 'year', 'eventually', 'combine', 'first', 'three', 'feature', 'film', 'Mike', 'Flanagan', 'graduated', 'Towson', 'University', 'film', 'program', 'Baltimore', 'directed', 'ESPN', 'Discovery', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Network', 'Gleib', 'Show', 'completed', 'three', 'feature', 'films']",N/A
