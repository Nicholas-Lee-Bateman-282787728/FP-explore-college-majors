I actually really like Adam Sandler when he does serious roles (Spanglish, Anger Management), much moreso than his comedies. He plays the same character a bit, but it works for me. And Don Cheadle is really strong as his counterpart who tries to help Sandler (who has lost his way after losing his family in the 9/11 attacks).

1075456,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000QFCCQY,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","This is one of those movies that contains a fair amount of comedy but mostly centers around drama so viewers should certainly treat it as a drama above everything else.  Not that you'd expect a comedy anyway if you read the description and notice it pertains to 9/11 of course.It's about Adam Sandler's character who lost his family in the 9/11 airplane incident and spends his entire days doing everything he can to completely forget about that painful tragedy.  Throughout the movie he constantly says ""I don't want to remember"" because he realizes that the best way to cope with losing a loved one (or in this case a series of loved ones) is to completely wipe them out of your memory.  Well, perhaps this is going *too* far (since it's good to keep the good memories alive as often as you can).  Surprisingly enough, the man who receives most of the attention isn't Adam Sandler but rather, the man who spends his time trying to get Adam some much needed help- Don Cheadle's character.  It's sort of strange that Adam plays second role most of the time.  As a result, at first I didn't even realize the man who lost his family was Adam Sandler.Anyway, it's obvious Adam has issues and initially it's quite hard and confusing figuring out what's wrong with him when Don's character meets up with him on a sidewalk one evening.  He's secluded for one thing which should send up a red flag that something's wrong, and as I say above, Adam Sandler doesn't seem to remember much of his past for quite a while.  He loves playing video games in his apartment room and basically his behavior is off.  Maybe it's unintentional, but Adam resembles Bruce Springsteen in the face and hair.  I figure it's intentional because he frequently mentions some of his favorite albums as a teenager such as Graham Nash's Songs for Beginners (odd that a fairly forgotten album such as this is mentioned, but kudos all the time since the song ""Military Madness"" is INCREDIBLY powerful), the Who's Quadrophenia (Adam sings ""Love Reign O'er Me"" to himself several times to help block out the bad memories) and yeah, Bruce Springsteen's the River (another excellent album).  Subtle moments of comedy occur on a few occasions when Don and Adam mention late 70's/early 80's artists but never agree with each others music tastes.The only reason I'm not giving Reign Over Me 5 stars is because the first half is really slow and takes forever to get going.  At least 45 minutes in the beginning is quite slow and boring.  For a while, at least from my point of view, it's sort of weird that a movie tries to take elements of comedy and wrap them around a storyline pertaining to the 9/11 incident.  Weird because this movie was released only 6 years after that incident.  Anyway, expect Don Cheadle to play equally as much of an important role in the way this storyline rolls along.  Don has to deal with his own hilarious issues such as a woman asking to perform sexual favors in his dentist office and then threatening him with a lawsuit when things don't go her way.  This is when the humor comes in, and though its existence is odd I suppose I have an explanation for this portion of the storyline- as a means to throw some humor in an otherwise really terrible, tragic, and painful situation involving Adam Sandler's character losing his entire family.  That's my only guess.Overall, occasionally dry but finally rewarding and fulfilling by the final 45 minutes.",4,reign on down,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,3440,"['one', 'movies', 'fair', 'amount', 'comedy', 'mostly', 'centers', 'drama', 'viewers', 'should', 'certainly', 'treat', 'drama', 'everything', 'else', 'Not', ""'d"", 'expect', 'comedy', 'anyway', 'read', 'description', 'notice', '9/11', 'course.It', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character', 'who', 'lost', 'family', '9/11', 'airplane', 'incident', 'entire', 'days', 'doing', 'everything', 'can', 'completely', 'forget', 'painful', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'constantly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'remember', 'best', 'way', 'cope', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'case', 'series', 'loved', 'ones', 'completely', 'wipe', 'memory', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'going', '*too*', 'far', 'good', 'keep', 'good', 'memories', 'alive', 'as', 'often', 'can', 'Surprisingly', 'enough', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'attention', ""n't"", 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'rather', 'man', 'who', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'Adam', 'much', 'needed', 'help-', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'sort', 'strange', 'Adam', 'second', 'role', 'most', 'time', 'result', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'family', 'was', 'Adam', 'Sandler.Anyway', 'obvious', 'Adam', 'issues', 'initially', 'quite', 'hard', 'confusing', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'wrong', 'when', 'Don', 'character', 'up', 'sidewalk', 'one', 'evening', 'secluded', 'one', 'thing', 'should', 'send', 'up', 'red', 'flag', 'something', 'wrong', 'say', 'Adam', 'Sandler', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'much', 'past', 'quite', 'while', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'apartment', 'room', 'basically', 'behavior', 'off', 'Maybe', 'unintentional', 'Adam', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'face', 'hair', 'figure', 'intentional', 'frequently', 'favorite', 'albums', 'teenager', 'such', 'Graham', 'Nash', 'Songs', 'Beginners', 'odd', 'fairly', 'forgotten', 'album', 'such', 'mentioned', 'time', 'song', 'Military', 'Madness', 'INCREDIBLY', 'powerful', 'Who', 'Quadrophenia', 'Adam', 'Love', 'Reign', ""O'er"", 'Me', 'several', 'times', 'help', 'block', 'out', 'bad', 'memories', 'yeah', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'River', 'excellent', 'album', 'Subtle', 'moments', 'comedy', 'occur', 'few', 'occasions', 'when', 'Don', 'Adam', 'mention', 'late', ""70's/early"", '80', 'artists', 'never', 'agree', 'others', 'music', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'Reign', 'Me', '5', 'stars', 'first', 'half', 'really', 'slow', 'forever', 'get', 'going', 'least', '45', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'quite', 'slow', 'boring', 'while', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'sort', 'weird', 'movie', 'take', 'elements', 'comedy', 'wrap', 'around', 'storyline', 'pertaining', '9/11', 'incident', 'Weird', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'only', '6', 'years', 'incident', 'Anyway', 'expect', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'play', 'equally', 'as', 'much', 'important', 'role', 'way', 'storyline', 'along', 'Don', 'deal', 'own', 'hilarious', 'issues', 'such', 'woman', 'asking', 'perform', 'sexual', 'favors', 'dentist', 'office', 'then', 'threatening', 'lawsuit', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'when', 'humor', 'existence', 'odd', 'suppose', 'have', 'explanation', 'portion', 'storyline-', 'means', 'throw', 'humor', 'otherwise', 'really', 'terrible', 'tragic', 'painful', 'situation', 'involving', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'character', 'losing', 'entire', 'family', 'only', 'guess.Overall', 'occasionally', 'dry', 'finally', 'rewarding', 'fulfilling', 'final', '45', 'minutes']",N/A
1075457,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000QFCCQY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 4]","REIGN OVER ME is a powerful drama with a few liberal portions of comedy mixed throughout. It is also Adam Sandler's most powerful and upstanding performance to date.Many movie watchers have probably seen plenty of the post-911 movies that've come out in recent years:World Trade CenterandUnited 93being the most notable. But what most movie-goers haven't seen is the long-term after-affects of that day on the lives of those left behind. Film studios wanted to show the special effect, the gore, or the panic of the day. But if we take our heads out of the clouds (and off of those collapsed structures) and focus them on the heads of those who lost everything, the glimpse is much more personal, much more gripping.I wasn't expecting much when I heard that Adam Sandler (Click) had taken one of the lead roles. He's known more as aSaturday Night Livegoofball and comedic talent. And although there are funny moments in Reign Over Me, none of them really fall in Sandler's normally outlandish comfort-zone.Sandler plays John Dillon lookalike Charlie Fineman, a man who lost his entire family on one of the planes that struck the Twin Towers. Years have passed and he suffers from the worst case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder you could imagine. Wandering around on his gas-powered skateboard, he acknowledges no one, living a secluded life both externally and internally. Until...Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle,Crash) went to college with Charlie, both of them at that time studying to become dentists. They'd grown apart, even though they were roommates, but now Alan spots Charlie on the street and sparks up a strange conversation with him. Charlie doesn't seem to remember him, but later comes to accept that he and Alan were indeed friends at some point. The two form an unusual bond based on communication problems. Charlie can't communicate for fear of ripping his heart out, and Alan can but won't for fear of losing his individuality to his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith).Clashes and questions build as the two men get closer and closer. Unable to break through to Charlie, Alan eventually employees the services of a pretty young psychiatrist named Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler,The Lord of the Rings). But even she can't seem to puncture the bubble that Charlie has built up around the loss of his family.Meanwhile, Alan is battling the sexual advances of a dental patient named Donna Remar (Saffron Burrows,Fay Grim), his lack of communication skills with his wife, and his grumpy receptionist (played by Paula Newsome,Little Miss Sunshine). Amazingly, Alan's relationship with Charlie helps him deal with all of these issues while at the same time helping Charlie regain some composure to his life.Sandler's portrayal of a mentally unstable post-911 survivor is quite good. His methods of avoidance are psychiatrically accurate, including listening to loud music, not finishing projects, rocking back-and-forth during times of increasing stress, and collecting inane object (like vinyl records of bad bands). But Cheadle is the real star here. His desperate need to help Charlie (and thus himself) are so simply pulled off the viewing audience will hardly notice the subtle changes that occur within him.Although there are some trite lines (""I have no one. At least you two have each other.""), the story itself is engrossing and well thought-out.",4,Adam Sandler Builds His Dramatic Chops,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,3349,"['REIGN', 'OVER', 'ME', 'powerful', 'drama', 'few', 'liberal', 'portions', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'also', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'most', 'powerful', 'upstanding', 'performance', 'date.Many', 'movie', 'watchers', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'plenty', 'post-911', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'come', 'out', 'recent', 'years', 'World', 'Trade', 'CenterandUnited', '93being', 'most', 'notable', 'what', 'most', 'movie-goers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long-term', 'after-affects', 'day', 'lives', 'left', 'behind', 'Film', 'studios', 'wanted', 'show', 'special', 'effect', 'gore', 'panic', 'day', 'take', 'heads', 'clouds', 'collapsed', 'structures', 'focus', 'heads', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'glimpse', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'much', 'more', 'gripping.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'when', 'heard', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Click', 'had', 'taken', 'one', 'lead', 'roles', 'known', 'more', 'aSaturday', 'Night', 'Livegoofball', 'comedic', 'talent', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'Reign', 'Me', 'none', 'really', 'fall', 'Sandler', 'normally', 'outlandish', 'comfort-zone.Sandler', 'plays', 'John', 'Dillon', 'Charlie', 'Fineman', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'entire', 'family', 'one', 'planes', 'struck', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'Years', 'have', 'passed', 'worst', 'case', 'Post-Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'could', 'imagine', 'Wandering', 'around', 'gas-powered', 'skateboard', 'one', 'living', 'secluded', 'life', 'externally', 'internally', 'Alan', 'Johnson', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Crash', 'went', 'college', 'Charlie', 'time', 'studying', 'become', 'dentists', ""'d"", 'grown', 'apart', 'even', 'were', 'roommates', 'now', 'Alan', 'spots', 'Charlie', 'street', 'up', 'strange', 'conversation', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'later', 'accept', 'Alan', 'were', 'indeed', 'friends', 'point', 'two', 'form', 'unusual', 'bond', 'based', 'communication', 'problems', 'Charlie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'fear', 'ripping', 'heart', 'Alan', 'can', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fear', 'losing', 'individuality', 'wife', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', '.Clashes', 'questions', 'build', 'two', 'men', 'get', 'closer', 'closer', 'Unable', 'break', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'eventually', 'employees', 'services', 'pretty', 'young', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Angela', 'Oakhurst', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'puncture', 'bubble', 'Charlie', 'built', 'up', 'loss', 'family.Meanwhile', 'Alan', 'battling', 'sexual', 'advances', 'dental', 'patient', 'named', 'Donna', 'Remar', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'Fay', 'Grim', 'lack', 'communication', 'skills', 'wife', 'grumpy', 'receptionist', 'played', 'Paula', 'Newsome', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Amazingly', 'Alan', 'relationship', 'Charlie', 'deal', 'issues', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'helping', 'Charlie', 'regain', 'composure', 'life.Sandler', 'portrayal', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'post-911', 'survivor', 'quite', 'good', 'methods', 'avoidance', 'are', 'psychiatrically', 'accurate', 'including', 'listening', 'loud', 'music', 'not', 'finishing', 'projects', 'rocking', 'back-and-forth', 'times', 'increasing', 'stress', 'collecting', 'inane', 'object', 'vinyl', 'records', 'bad', 'bands', 'Cheadle', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'desperate', 'need', 'help', 'Charlie', 'thus', 'are', 'so', 'simply', 'pulled', 'off', 'viewing', 'audience', 'will', 'hardly', 'notice', 'subtle', 'changes', 'occur', 'him.Although', 'are', 'trite', 'lines', 'have', 'one', 'least', 'two', 'have', 'other', 'story', 'engrossing', 'well', 'thought-out']",N/A
1075458,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000QFCCQY,Boss Fan,"[8, 11]","Adam Sandler is Charlie, a man who rides the streets of New York on his moped, detached from life in his own little i-pod assisted universe.  Suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after his family became victims in the 9/11 attacks, he has withdrawn from all family and friends, and is on the verge from withdrawing from reality itself.  Alan (Don Cheadle) is his college roommate from dental school who has not spoken with Charlie since that trajic day - until he runs into him one day.No more plot description is really necessary for ""Reign Over Me,"" because after the film's initial set-up, the movie asks that you just watch these two men exist.  It is an invitation you should not miss.  Those who accept it are in, I think, for something special:  a small but powerful film that is, by turns, funny and disquieting, but never lapses into a place where it condescends to its audience with easy answers and trite clich&eacute;s.And there are two terrific performances at the center.Outside of his first two or three classic comedies, ""Reign Over Me"" may be the movie I start referring to as Adam Sandler's best film.  I know he gets the most props in the drama realm for ""Punch Drunk Love"" - and I agree his performance there is terrific - but this film is far more accessible and heartfelt, even if only because you'd be hard pressed to find a person who could not relate to this character's pain; whereas I'd wager half the people who saw ""Drunk,"" not only could not relate to what the character was going through, but had no idea what was going on in that film at all.Again, I liked ""Drunk,"" but ""Reign"" feels, while maybe not as unique, much more passionate, intimate and realistic.  It is also a fascinating character study - though fictitious - of the unfortunate inability to deal with loss many 9/11 widows, widowers, and survivors (or anyone who has lost loved ones and seen their life fall apart in the wake of any tragedy for that matter) must be struggling with.  The idea that people like this, suffering from this level of post traumatic stress disorder, are out there is heartbreaking.But ""Reign"" is not simply a downer or a movie that throws 9/11 in the audiences face just to come off as profound, important or find an easy way to pull on the audiences heartstrings and manipulate their emotions.  It is surprisingly restrained and un-exploitive given the potentially volatile subject matter (and I am torn - as much as I admire the idea that there is no need to speechify about 9/11 at this point, but for a character like Sandler's in this film - who has never dealt with it - you almost want to see more raw emotion and anger from him about the event that ruined his life).  There are some heavy scenes to be sure, but they all feel genuine.  And the film has a rough-around-the-edges quality (like Sandler the actor and his character here) and a sense of random, explosive humor and desperation (also qualities Sandler possesses as an actor), that allows the characters, their actions and situations to come of as authentic and valid.Director Mike Binder peppers the film with all kinds of terrific little touches to give his characters actual personalities.  Sandler's constant listening to his i-pod, his reversion back to his college self - before he even met the wife he lost, his apartment, and his belief in the soul-saving power of Bruce Springsteen's ""The River"" (listen to his emotional breakdown/confession while ""Drive All Night"" plays almost subliminally underneath the dialog and you'd be hard pressed not to agree with him).  Confession:  though the movie is filled with high points, the scene that pretty much broke me was a short, simple one between Sandler's character his former in-laws:  written and played to perfection.And, of course, Don Cheadle.  One of this generation's very best, most natural and personable actors.  You know how directors and producers say that the key to acting is not acting?  This must be what they mean.  Watching Cheadle on screen almost always feels like we are watching someone act just as they would in real life; facial expressions, body language - all that.  He is terrific here and his chemistry with Sandler is pitch-perfect.  And since it is the backbone of the film, it better be or all would be lost.Some critics have griped about the supporting performances by Liv Tyler as shrink and Saffron Burrows as, well, you can just find out; but the complaint seems to be they exist as tacked on subplots.  I can see that, but they both work within the world this film has created.  Donald Sutherland, though he utters the phrase `shut-up' one too many times, is brilliant in a small amount of screen time.  If I have a complaint about the film it is that its pace slackens a bit here and there and feels like we see every single move the characters make, which makes it difficult for the movie to provide a satisfying end place.But God bless any movie that presents such a traumatic problem and doesn't wrap it up with easy answers or happy endings.  This film knows there may be no cure for what the Sandler character has suffered and become, but it says it is the small moments, seemingly insignificant little passions (video games, Chinese Food, kitchen remodeling, Mel Brooks movies, and The Boss and The Who), and the shoulder of a close, nonjudgmental friend that can help us along.  There is hope, even if there is not an outright solution.""Reign Over Me"" is funny and moving, but doesn't pile-on either one.  That is its greatest asset:  nothing feels forced or fake, but rather just lingers as truth and basic human emotional response - and that includes humor, anger and desperation.  If two people can pull all that off together better, more relaxed, assured and realistically than Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle do here, I'd love to see it.",5,"Sad, funny  tale of loss and - mainly- friendship.

1075466,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000QFCCQY,Chris Pandolfi,"[10, 12]","""Reign Over Me"" is a film that doesn't offer easy answers to life's problems; it's a matter of give and take, of knowing when to get involved and when to back off. A wealth of complex issues is presented in this film, all of which are handled with a surprising and welcome mix of humor and drama. I say this because life itself can be viewed as funny or depressing, often times both. How interesting that the emotional gamut of this film can successfully go from tense and heartbreaking to laugh-out-loud funny in the exact same scene. Example: Adam Sandler's character has an emotional breakdown in Don Cheadle's dental office, one in which framed degrees, magazines, and lamps are thrown and destroyed. When the chaos ends, a beautiful woman arrives for her appointment. Sandler turns to Cheadle and mimics oral sex while raving over her physical appearance.It's moments like these that add depth to a heartfelt story. This isn't to say that ""Reign Over Me"" is a perfect film; certain plot devices are incredibly unrealistic and a couple of key characters are underdeveloped. Nonetheless, it was a fascinating exploration of grief, friendship, and family, enough to allow the flaws to be overlooked. I was especially pleased with Adam Sandler's dramatic performance; apart from ""Punch Drunk Love,"" he has never been able to show his range as an actor. In this film, he plays Charlie Fineman, a former dental school student who lost his wife and daughters on September 11, 2001. His inability to cope has forced him to regress, pretty much to the point of detaching from the rest of the world. From the moment we first lay eyes on him, it's quite obvious that his emotional state is broken, practically shattered; he aimlessly rides around New York City on a motorized scooter, his hair unkempt, his face worn, his eyes unfocused.The plot mainly focuses on a rekindled friendship between Fineman and Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a successful dentist. Formerly roommates in college, the two saw less of each other as time went on. All contact was severed by the time the events of 9/11 occurred. When they first reunite, Johnson is surprised to discover that Fineman doesn't remember him. As the film progresses, Johnson begins to understand why; Fineman is choosing to forget every aspect of his old life. He now loses himself in hobbies, from renovating his kitchen to playing video games. He's especially fond of music, with a massive vinyl album collection and an MP3 player that's with him at all times. When his repressed emotions show signs of resurfacing, he'll put a pair of headphones over his ears, push play, and turn the volume all the way up.Clearly, this is not the Charlie Fineman that Johnson remembers. Yet, in some strange way, the two begin to reconnect as friends. They spend long nights together, reveling in a lifestyle any single man would be proud of: they play video games together; they go to late night movies; they go to clubs. The problem is that Johnson isn't single; he has a wife, Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith), and two daughters. This is one aspect of the story I wish had been developed a bit more. The marriage is clearly troubled, with both spouses feeling as if they're stuck in a monotonous routine. Unfortunately, not enough of this is shown; Smith's screen time is reduced to only a few scenes, all of which take place in their apartment. Their marital problems seem almost insignificant to the story, which is bad because Johnson's relationship with Fineman is part of the reason they're in trouble. Janeane eventually suspects that her husband is jealous of Fineman for being single. This is in spite of the fact that he's suffered a great loss.A majority of their problems stem from a lack of communication. This isn't helpful to anyone, especially when work related problems arise. I'm directly referring to a subplot involving Donna Remar (Saffron Burrows), one of Johnson's patients. In many ways, her emotional state is just as fragile as Fineman's; she had recently divorced her husband due to years of his infidelity. As a result, she's desperate for attention, so much so that she's willing to give Johnson oral sex right in his office. Turning her away prompts her to file a sexual harassment lawsuit, an act that puts Johnson's entire dental office in jeopardy. In order to avoid such unwanted legal action, Johnson has no choice but to personally appeal to Donna. This adds an intriguing if odd dimension to the story; both Donna and Fineman are disturbed individuals, and through Johnson, the two will enter each other's lives. I can't say that I bought such a convenient set up, but it still made for an interesting idea.As the relationship between Johnson and Fineman grows deeper, it becomes apparent that Fineman needs more help than Johnson can provide. For one thing, any mention of Fineman's family sends him over the edge; Johnson learns this the hard way, first at an open mike night, second at his dental office. Furthermore, Fineman's in laws (Robert Kline and Melinda Dillon) are trying to reenter his life, something he's simply not ready for. Desperate to get his friend some help, Johnson introduces Fineman to psychiatrist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler). Every one of their sessions is brief, with every attempt at bringing up Fineman's past thwarted by him putting on his headphones. ""There are some things I don't like to think about,"" he says, avoiding Oakhurst's questions. These scenes would have been effective if it weren't for Liv Tyler's performance. I never once believed her in this role; her soft voice and lax mannerisms don't allow for a psychiatrist to come through.Everything comes to a head when Fineman attempts suicide by provoking police officers. It backfires; instead of shooting him, he's merely arrested. Within the context of the story, I wasn't sure if this was good thing. On the one hand, entering him into the legal system may provide him with some professional help. On the other hand, he may not need professional help. Maybe the best thing to do is to leave him alone and let him come to terms with his loss in his own way. This is something many of the characters have to consider, especially Fineman's in laws; despite the fact that they've been pushing him, it's obvious that they have the best intentions. Such high drama also leaves an impression on Johnson, who soon realizes that he needs to reconnect with his wife. I appreciated this aspect of the story because it exemplified the complexity of certain issues. It also exemplified how certain people can affect others, even in subtle ways. Thus brings home the point that ""Reign Over Me"" is a generally well-crafted human story. Yes, it lacks some character development. Yes, many of the plot devices are preposterous. But I have to recommend this movie; it's touching, it's funny, and it tells a genuinely engaging story.",4,A Friend in Need,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,6879,"['Reign', 'Me', 'film', ""n't"",

1075469,AQALTWTLGTUM1,B000QFCCQY,"Dave ""KingstonKid'64""","[2, 2]","There are people like Sandler portrayed in the film out there right now with ties to NYC and 9/11. I'm from NY, but live in RI, and I lost former high school classmates and college classmates from the 1980's. The Sandler character used music (instead of drugs/alcohol) in the film to create the diversion that so many people desire when trying not to remember what happened when discussing loved ones lost in 2001. It's a tragic and painful reality that a lot of folks within the immediate New York area still can't comprehend or face. On same note, I find it difficult to emphasize the pain of Pearl Harbor survivors year after year, as I was born 20 plus years later from December 7, 1941.  What a horrifying reality to have to live with the shock of one traumatic day for the rest of one's life.  The film is fair representation of one man's pain and his coping with love, loss, suffering, and reckoning.  The stages of grief (guilt, anger, etc.) are the traits of Sandler's character.  It's a dfferent role for Sandler, but I found it to be a refreshing change. I recommend this film wholeheartedly as a testament to mankind's ability to go on as best we can.

Brilliant movie.Normally one would think it would not be something for me, because it's a ""human drama"" story. But it's a good one, it avoids the usual sentimental sand traps most of these movies are mired in.And importantly, it has a lot of humor. It's subtle, of the kind people may not remember after, but it's there all the time. One small example: a therapist, played by lovely Liv Tyler, is told by a defensive patient that what he thinks about are her perfect tits. And next session she is wearing the bulkiest sweater you ever saw... and it's not even mentioned! That's excellent.There's a bit of dangeous casting by Adam Sandler as the messed up guy, but he actually does a wonderful job.One of the main themes of the film is also unique (so far as I know): even if it's obvious that a person needs to Get Help, and Open Up, and Face His Past, how much can you do for him? How much can you push him? Can you really help him? Is it him you really want to help, or youself?",5,Bril,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",2008,1010,"['just', 'watched', 'Reign', 'Me', 'Brilliant', 'movie.Normally', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'something', 'human', 'drama', 'story', 'good', 'one', 'usual', 'sentimental', 'sand', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'mired', 'in.And', 'importantly', 'lot', 'humor', 'subtle', 'kind', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'remember', 'there', 'time', 'One', 'small', 'example', 'therapist', 'played', 'lovely', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'told', 'defensive', 'patient', 'what', 'about', 'are', 'perfect', 'tits', 'next', 'session', 'wearing', 'bulkiest', 'sweater', 'ever', 'saw', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'bit', 'dangeous', 'casting', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'messed', 'up', 'guy', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'job.One', 'main', 'themes', 'film', 'also', 'unique', 'so', 'far', 'know', 'even', 'obvious', 'person', 'Get', 'Help', 'Open', 'Up', 'Face', 'Past', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'How', 'much', 'can', 'push', 'Can', 'really', 'help', 'really', 'want', 'help']",N/A

1075472,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000QFCCQY,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","While dramas reenacting the devastation of 911 abound, only a few select films appear to be dealing with the personal, long-term effects of that day of doom.  REIGN OVER ME, with a brilliant script by Mike Bender (who also directs and acts in the film), reaches into the arena of emotional states that continue to filter through the detritus of that event, states that have altered many minds permanently and states that have provided pathways for growing into a more profound appreciation for life and the privilege of living.Successful dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) and his beautiful wife Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith) live luxuriously well from the income Alan makes tending to the vanity of the wealthy New Yorkers: their lives seem perfect but there is a static vibration that pleads for change.  Alan happens to see his old college and dental school roommate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), disheveled and skirting around the streets on a motorized scooter.  Charlie doesn't recognize Alan: Charlie doesn't recognize anything or anyone from his past as his mind has been jumbled by the unrepaired grief over the loss of his wife and three daughters in one of the airplanes that crashed in 911 disaster. The rigid but needy Alan succeeds in making contact with Charlie, offering solace and help and companionship to his old friend, and through a series of incidents (some hilarious, others tragic) the two men find a common Gilead - Charlie faces  his loss and begins to cope and Alan is set free from his self inflicted cage in which he lives.Binder writes well and introduces enough interesting sidebar characters through the course of the film to make the statement about change and healing credible.  The fine cast includes Liv Tyler as a psychiatrist, Saffron Burrows as a stalking patient whose recovery from a divorce plays significantly in the interaction between Alan and Charlie, Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon play the parents of Charlie's deceased wife, Mike Binder is Charlie's accountant, and Donald Sutherland offers a brief but sophisticated cameo as a judge.  The quality of acting is first rate and even Adam Sandler manages to overcome his own well-worn bag of schlocky tricks to bring the sad Charlie to life.  Food for thought, here, and worth watching, if only to see how personal 911 is to be remembered.

1075473,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B000QFCCQY,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 2]","That's it in a nutshell. Everyone knows that Don Cheadle is a good actor but Adam Sandler? That remark would have been a joke a few years ago when Sandler was churning one offensive, comedy after another but not now. He still does his lame comedies and I really wish he would do more drama as clearly he can do drama with movies like ""Punch-Drunk Love"".Anyways, it's about time we had more movies dealing with people dealing with the post 9/11 aftermath. Hell, Hollywood has milked the event to produce one war movie after another so this was a refreshing change.Sandler plays Charlie Fineman, a guy living like a kid, in his own world. However, we see this as a front for the real pain and agony he has experience since 9/11 (as he lost his family in that event). Little by little Charlie's shows signs of anger, grief, insanity, and periods of illusion as he is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.I love Sandler in this, he totally ""gets"" the role. I liked his character more than Alan Johnson who was totally shall we say ungrateful of the life he has and the life Charlie doesn't have. Johnson tries to get Charlie better  but fails until he meets Angela Oakhurst a psychologist/shrink played excellently by Liv Tyler. Man she is beautiful and so talented. Anyways, Angela tells Johnson the diagnosis. However, trouble is ahead as Charlie's behavior has prompted the courts to decide whether he should be committed for some outrageous behavior.Besides capturing the character of someone suffering from the events of 9/11 this movie is another commentary on the way society perceives such victims. We feel sorry but we do really want to be around? Especially people like Charlie who has obvious issues. The answer doesn't seem as comforting as most people will admit. I think some people who will sympathize with Charlie's ""situation"" will only do so up to a certain point and then expect them to move on from the event like nothing ever happened. Of course that is the worst thing they could do yet they do it. Alan's friendship with has certain limits. Charlie's own family in disgusting fashion seems doesn't seem to consider the pain that he is in instead of concentrating on who they lost, not who they are losing (that is still alive) right in front of them.Anyways, this is a great movie, judging by the wide number of reviews ""Reign Over Me"" will be held as a great movie for a long time.",5,Adam Sandler's best movie.

I didn't, however, ever believe that Don Cheadle, my favorite strut-walking acting dynamo, could ever go slumming at a time when he is arguably at his zenith in terms of recognition. Well, he went slumming in Reign Over Me, a quasi-sophisticated film about the burden of friendship and the importance of healing.If you watch this film closely and remove yourself from the garage sale-type plotline, you will see a Sandler laughably trying too hard, and a Cheadle not trying hard enough. This combination is horrifically combustible and acts like a pin being thrust into your left kneecap while your torturers merrily play John Tesh music in the background.Sandler, as always, resorts to screaming and looking red-eyed as opposed to actually playing a believable character not named Billy Madison. Cheadle, on the flipside, seems mentally engaged in some other realm, wandering an ethereal plain of lower consciousness where the paychecks play water polo in Paycheck Land.PLOT:Two friends meet after years of separation following the 911 tragedy that took the lives of one of their families.

1075481,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000QFCCQY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 3]","In 2007, Adam Sandler released two movies that were as different from each other as night and day. Both films were being hailed as the best in their genre for the year, but only one of the movies actually earned the accolades being bestowed upon it. The first film was the supposedly hilarious comedy ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" that was so thoroughly disappointing that I wondered why people would even think it was the funniest film all year. And the second film, and the one that actually came through on the promise made by the advertisers and critics, was the powerful drama ""Reign Over Me"" starring Adam Sandler (""The Longest Yard"") and Don Cheadle (""Ocean's 13"").""Reign Over Me"" tells the story of Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a lonely widower who lost his wife and daughters in the terrorist attacks on September 11th. He lives out his days trying to convince himself that he never had a family, and has separated himself from anyone that could remind him otherwise. One day he meets his former college roommate Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), who is aware of what had happened and sees what his old friend has become, and is now hoping to reawaken this man to what life still has to offer. The more time Alan spends with Charlie, the more he begins to understand the pain Charlie endures daily, but he also begins to see signs of life sparking within Charlie, and the realization that though his pain is great, there is hope that the healing process will begin.This movie is an example of just how surprising one can be by an actor's performance. Adam Sandler is an actor primarily known for his hilarious comedies, and sarcastic, sometimes crass, sense of humor, yet he displays here an incredible talent for drama that I never thought possible. It's strange that in the same year, Sandler gave what was probably his worst performance ever in ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"", and then went on to deliver a brilliant turn in ""Reign Over Me"" that should change critic's opinions of him from now on. Supporting Sandler in this film was the always capable Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda""), who gives another terrific performance as a loving husband who feels trapped by his own life, yet through the process of reawakening Adam's character to life he reawakens himself as well. The scenes that Adam and Don shared in this film (which is a majority of them) were so well-written that I really became engrossed in these characters. The most incredible scene for me, was when Charlie finally broke down the walls he'd built around himself and let Alan into his life by telling him about his family and what he'd lost that horrible day in September, 2001. In that scene, Sandler's performance was so moving and genuine, that I actually got tears, and that's saying a lot for me to get teary during a movie, and Cheadle perfectly played his part as the caring friend and listener, conveying each of his emotions through his facial expressions alone, it was just terrific.The story for ""Reign Over Me"", written and directed by Mike Binder, was so well-crafted and paced that I didn't feel like I was watching a fictional movie. The characters were so rich and believable, and their story was one that could have been that of any of the victim's families from that day, that it almost felt as if it were a documentary depicting the far reaching effects that day has had for so many people. Even though the movie is a very heavy dramatic piece, it does have a few welcome moments of comedy to lighten the mood, but not too much to take away from the overall tone of the film.It was interesting that director Mike Binder opted to not show any big sweeping establishing shots of New York City for this movie, most of the time when a movie takes place in New York, or any big city for that matter, there's the obligatory city shot, but not here. As he stated in the `Making of' special feature on the DVD, he wanted the movie to take place on the street level of NYC, allowing the movie to feel more intimate and personal to the audience. It was a surprising choice, but one that worked well for the movie.In the end, ""Reign Over Me"" is a powerfully moving story of one man's shattered life being put back together by the bonds of friendship. This is one movie you should definitely see.""Reign Over Me"" is rated R for language and sexual references.",5,Learn To Live Again,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,4355,"['2007', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'released', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'different', 'other', 'night', 'day', 'films', 'were', 'being', 'hailed', 'best', 'genre', 'year', 'only', 'one', 'movies', 'actually', 'earned', 'accolades', 'being', 'bestowed', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'supposedly', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'was', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'disappointing', 'wondered', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'even', 'think', 'was', 'funniest', 'film', 'year', 'second', 'film', 'one', 'actually', 'came', 'promise', 'made', 'advertisers', 'critics', 'was', 'powerful', 'drama', 'Reign', 'Me', 'starring', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Longest', 'Yard', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Ocean', '13', 'Reign', 'Me', 'story', 'Charlie', 'Fineman', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'lonely', 'widower', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'daughters', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'September', '11th', 'out', 'days', 'trying', 'convince', 'never', 'had', 'family', 'separated', 'anyone', 'could', 'remind', 'otherwise', 'One', 'day', 'former', 'college', 'roommate', 'Alan', 'Johnson', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'who', 'aware', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'what', 'old', 'friend', 'become', 'now', 'hoping', 'reawaken', 'man', 'what', 'life', 'still', 'offer', 'more', 'time', 'Alan', 'Charlie', 'more', 'understand', 'pain', 'Charlie', 'daily', 'also', 'see', 'signs', 'life', 'sparking', 'Charlie', 'realization', 'pain', 'great', 'hope', 'healing', 'process', 'will', 'begin.This', 'movie', 'example', 'just', 'how', 'surprising', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'actor', 'performance', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'actor', 'primarily', 'known', 'hilarious', 'comedies', 'sarcastic', 'sometimes', 'crass', 'sense', 'humor', 'yet', 'here', 'incredible', 'talent', 'drama', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'strange', 'same', 'year', 'Sandler', 'gave', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'worst', 'performance', 'ever', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'then', 'went', 'deliver', 'brilliant', 'turn', 'Reign', 'Me', 'should', 'change', 'critic', 'opinions', 'now', 'Supporting', 'Sandler', 'film', 'was', 'always', 'capable', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'who', 'terrific', 'performance', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'trapped', 'own', 'life', 'process', 'reawakening', 'Adam', 'character', 'life', 'well', 'scenes', 'Adam', 'Don', 'shared', 'film', 'majority', 'were', 'so', 'well-written', 'really', 'became', 'engrossed', 'characters', 'most', 'incredible', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Charlie', 'finally', 'broke', 'down', 'walls', ""'d"", 'built', 'let', 'Alan', 'life', 'telling', 'family', 'what', ""'d"", 'lost', 'horrible', 'day', 'September', '2001', 'scene', 'Sandler', 'performance', 'was', 'so', 'moving', 'genuine', 'actually', 'got', 'tears', 'saying', 'lot', 'get', 'teary', 'movie', 'Cheadle', 'perfectly', 'played', 'part', 'caring', 'friend', 'listener', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'alone', 'was', 'just', 'terrific.The', 'story', 'Reign', 'Me', 'written', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'was', 'so', 'well-crafted', 'paced', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'fictional', 'movie', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'rich', 'believable', 'story', 'was', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'victim', 'families', 'day', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'documentary', 'depicting', 'far', 'reaching', 'effects', 'day', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'Even', 'movie', 'very', 'heavy', 'dramatic', 'piece', 'have', 'few', 'welcome', 'moments', 'comedy', 'lighten', 'mood', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'tone', 'film.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'opted', 'not', 'show', 'big', 'sweeping', 'establishing', 'shots', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'movie', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'big', 'city', 'matter', 'obligatory', 'city', 'shot', 'not', 'here', 'stated', 'Making', 'special', 'feature', 'DVD', 'wanted', 'movie', 'take', 'place', 'street', 'level', 'NYC', 'allowing', 'movie', 'feel', 'more', 'intimate', 'personal', 'audience', 'was', 'surprising', 'choice', 'one', 'worked', 'well', 'movie.In', 'end', 'Reign', 'Me', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'shattered', 'life', 'being', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'one', 'movie', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'Reign', 'Me', 'rated', 'R', 'language', 'sexual', 'references']",N/A

Charlie, once a successful dentist, loses his wife and three daughters in a plane crash that totally broke his heart. He suffers from post traumatic stress, quits his job, lives totally alone, and throws his whole life behind. He tries to forget about his family and feels very angry and frustrated with anyone that reminds him of them.Johnston as a friend tries to offer help to Charlie. Throughout he movie he hangs out with Charlie and encounters all Charlie's angers and disturbances, however remains patient with him. Eventually, with the help of a psychiatrist, Charlie learns to accept his loss and realizes that life must go on, meets a lovely women, and it seems he will get into a relationship with her that surely will help him not stay lonely anymore.This movie is about the importance of friendship. Many people would be your friend when you are funny, well off, cool, smart, and interesting. But they would run away from you if you start being a source of discomfort to them. Johnston was a true friend and illustrated how friends should stick to each other at both good and bad times.We really can't blame Charlie for being so disturbing and angry. He lost his whole family in a plane crash. If anyone has a similar experience they will for sure change and will need some professional help. If anyone in a matter of minutes lost everyone he/she knows, it will surely crush his/her heart. However one should believe that losing people doesn't mean the end of them. Its very helpful to believe that they are gone for a short time and we'll catch up with them later and see them again.

First, because I liked the premise of it and second because I'm such a big fan of Adam Sandlers and I wanted to see him step out of his comedy roles and do some drama.  He was excellent in this.He plays Charlie Fineman who lost his wife and two children in a plane on 9/11.  He was Alan Johnsons (Don Cheadle) former college roomate and the two had lost touch for many years.  One day by chance, the two are brought together again and Alan finds it really hard to accept Charlie as he is now since the loss of his family (he withdrew from the world and became very reclusive).  Yet they rekindle their friendship and help each other out at times in their lives where they are both going through hard times.This is a little long winded in parts, but the acting is great and the story line is ultimately lovely.  Adam does a great job here and Don Cheadle is brilliant as always.  His wife is played well by Jada Pinket Smith.  I enjoyed this a lot and am so glad I finally got around to watching it.

1075495,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000QFCCQY,Melissa Niksic,"[4, 10]","I didn't really care for this film at all. ""Reign Over Me"" is about a man named Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) whose wife and three daughters were killed on one of the airplanes that hit the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Six years have passed, and Charlie's college roommate, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), runs into Charlie on the street one day and is stunned by how much his old friend has changed. Charlie lives his life completely alone, unable to cope with his unspeakable sadness. Alan does everything he can to help his friend and save Charlie from self-destruction.It's hard to pinpoint what I hated so much about this film. The basic plot is decent, and both Sandler and Cheadle deliver strong performances. However, I didn't think the movie was very genuine. I failed to experience any kind of emotional response to the horrible situation that Charlie found himself in. There was just something off about this movie, and several very random things (Alan's crazy, sex-obsessed patient who sort of befriends Charlie at the end; stupid Liv Tyler cast as a psychiatrist who is a total bitch and eavesdrops on Charlie's private conversation with Alan) pissed me off and totally ruined the movie for me. After watching this film, I felt that it somehow desensitized the whole September 11 tragedy in spite of the fact that the intent of the film was actually to honor it. For that reason, I think this movie was a massive failure.",2,Depressing and stupid,1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,1444,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'film', 'Reign', 'Me', 'man', 'named', 'Charlie', 'Fineman', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'wife', 'three', 'daughters', 'were', 'killed', 'one', 'airplanes', 'hit', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'September', '11', '2001', 'Six', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'Charlie', 'college', 'roommate', 'Alan', 'Johnson', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Charlie', 'street', 'one', 'day', 'stunned', 'how', 'much', 'old', 'friend', 'changed', 'Charlie', 'life', 'completely', 'alone', 'unable', 'cope', 'unspeakable', 'sadness', 'Alan', 'everything', 'can', 'help', 'friend', 'save', 'Charlie', 'self-destruction.It', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'hated', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'basic', 'plot', 'decent', 'Sandler', 'Cheadle', 'deliver', 'strong', 'performances', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'genuine', 'failed', 'experience', 'kind', 'emotional', 'response', 'horrible', 'situation', 'Charlie', 'found', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'off', 'movie', 'several', 'very', 'random', 'things', 'Alan', 'crazy', 'sex-obsessed', 'patient', 'who', 'sort', 'befriends', 'Charlie', 'end', 'stupid', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'cast', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'total', 'bitch', 'eavesdrops', 'Charlie', 'private', 'conversation', 'Alan', 'pissed', 'off', 'totally', 'ruined', 'movie', 'watching', 'film', 'felt', 'somehow', 'desensitized', 'whole', 'September', '11', 'tragedy', 'spite', 'fact', 'intent', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'honor', 'reason', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'massive', 'failure']",N/A
1075496,A2BZ7MYTSNYMEW,B000QFCCQY,"Michelle L. Beck ""Always the Devourer of Good...","[2, 2]","aybe I liked this film because (1) I was not expecting anything, (2) I am not a Don Cheadle (although I loved him in Crash) or Adam Sandler fan, and I knew very little about it. What I did know was that ""on demand"" is probably the best invention since ""the remote control""! So, when all else fails, or if you are bored, you can always order a movie from on demand. So, imagine sitting on the sofa, with tons of things that you could be doing, but saying I am going to take a few minutes to veg-out with a good movie. Out of a list of dozens, I selected ""Reign on Me"" and have not regretted it. When I started to review this movie, I glanced at the reviews and was puzzled by some of the criticisms. Maybe because I didn't have any expectations, I was pleasantly pleased.The story is unique, in my opinion because of the subject matter....the idea that someone could completely lose themselves in hopelessness and despair. What I found to be so thought-provoking was the concept of how some people cope a traumatic and unexpected loss, especially one of a spouse, during a violent incident, especially one like 9/11. Just imagine all of the regrets (the last thing that you said or argued with your loved one about), the ""what ifs"" (what if I had made a different decision, would the outcome be the same)? These are all questions that I know people who experience tragedy face (I work with Homicide survivors and I know first hand). ""Reign on Me"" is the journey of two men, linked by their pasts, experiences a crisis of sorts. One is trying to fight his way back from the brink of hopelessness, and the other is trying to figure out why he is dissatisfied with the life he has. Alan, Don Cheadle's character, a dentist, is facing charges of inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment by a patient (who has a series of issues of her own). Faced with everything a man should possibly want (a beautiful wife, played by Jada Pinckett-Smith and two wonderful daughters) he finds himself wondering why he feels troubled, and is desperately looking for answers at every turn (even striking up conversations with a Psychologist in his building). He is struggling desperately to juggle his own sense of despair, with demands both personally and professionally that seem to be pushing him to the brink. One day he sees his old Dental School roommate and realizes that Charlie (played by Adam Sandler) has found what he seeks, a means of escaping reality. While Alan attempts to rescue Charlie from himself, we see the two work their way through their problems to make themselves better people, and perhaps one day whole.There were several things that I liked about the movie, among them: the relationship between Alan and his wife and how they showed that sometimes marriage is work and when you attempt to navigate those ""rocky"" waters without your spouse, you can get lost; how people sometimes react when confronted with loss; and how you life can be influenced by one event, one person; and how sometimes what you think is bad, really isn't when you find out what others are going thru. I also enjoyed seeing Adam Sandler in a non-comedic role. I didn't know that he had that kind of range. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and don't intend to go into more detail about the plot.

I'm assuming based on what we know of his life, Adam Sandler's character was what we would consider a relatively normal person before his ""tragedy?"" Because if the way we saw him in his current state WAS his personality before all of this, then this movie is even more of a joke than for the reasons I'm about to bash it for in the next paragraphs.What a pretentious piece of garbage this turned out to be. This was NOT uplifting. When your movie has pacing as slow as Spike Lee movies, AND it features a main character that you wish would've suffered the same fate as the rest of his family, then you've pretty much failed and don't need to make a movie for awhile. I can almost see exactly how this was created, someone was sitting there deciding on what kind of story to make, and they said, ""I'm going to create a story about a person who has to help his friend overcome depression."" That COULD'VE been the backdrop and foundation for a heartwarming movie, but they made it in THE most GENERIC, unimaginative, simplistic way possible. There's like, nothing to this movie. Nothing more beyond the first layer. They're generic characters, executing their scripted functions and nothing more (act like an unreasonable retard, be the friend that cares, the lonely wife, and the lunatic woman with an insatiable craving for dentist).Normally with a straightforward premise like this, you expect it to be more than JUST about someone helping someone else overcome depression (or whatever his problem was, I don't even care at this point), you expect either: 1) clever writing, or 2) a great character based story that makes you really care about the characters, or 3) an inspirational story of human triumph. This was human excrement.Complaints:--I can't believe the number of times I heard the phrase ""Charlie Fineman"" uttered in this movie. Who refers to someone by their full name???

1075505,A1129LM24YWSZV,B000QFCCQY,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[2, 2]","Reign Over Me is an amazing and ultimately uplifting film.The movie tells the story of Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a Manhattan dentist who's feeling a bit stifled by his life. Everything looks good from the outside - a successful dental practice, a beautiful wife that loves him, sweet kids - but he finds himself oddly closed off and non-communicative.Alan is driving one day, and he catches sight of Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), his college roommate from dental school. Alan knows that Charlie lost his wife and three daughters in the Sept. 11 attacks (five years ago in the world of the movie). Though Alan has tried numerous times since then to make contact with Charlie, he's been unsuccessful. Eventually, Alan and Charlie reconnect, and Alan discovers that Charlie has steadily slipped away from reality since his horrible loss.As the two men re-establish their friendship, they find they both benefit in different ways from being with one another. Alan feels less pressured by career and family obligations, and Charlie begins to confront the death of his family and what it has meant for him.Though the storyline sounds grim, I laughed alot during this movie. Cheadle and Sandler both give solid performances (especially Cheadle - he is freaking amazing in this), and their joy at rediscovering one another makes for some wonderful moments on screen. Liv Tyler plays a sweet supporting role as a grief and loss counselor, and Donald Sutherland gives a dead-on fabulous cameo as an irritable judge.Despite the tragic timbre of the story, I never found it maudlin or emotionally manipulative. It seemed effortless. ""This is what loss is like. This is what grief can do to you. This is how you can start to come out of it."" The movie felt very true, somehow.And it leads the viewer to ask some questions of him/herself.

Don Cheadle's performance feels watered down mainly because Adam Sandler and Liv Tyler gives him very little to work with.  I can't help but feel Adam TRYING to act.  It's a reoccuring problem that shows up in his dramatic efforts of the past.  Only time he shines is during the few comedic moments-and even then Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler.  He's not like a Robin Williams who flip the script effortlessly between comedy and serious dramatic roles.  Liv Tyler truely is a blank slate-her acting range is near zero since she seems to be playing herself no matter what the role as well.  My main problem with the film is that it FEELS long.  Cheadle's storyline tends to get dropped for large portions of the film and I wonder why Jada Pinkett can't land a part that will give her more than 20 minutes of screen time. Over all it's not a very memorable film.,3,Good message but mediocre execution,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",2008,992,"['2.5', 'stars', 'movie', 'started', 'good', 'premise', 'due', 'couple', 'bad', 'casting', 'rambling', 'script', 'movie', 'short', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'performance', 'feels', 'watered', 'down', 'mainly', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'very', 'little', 'work', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Adam', 'TRYING', 'act', 'reoccuring', 'problem', 'up', 'dramatic', 'efforts', 'past', 'Only', 'time', 'few', 'comedic', 'moments-and', 'even', 'then', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'not', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'flip', 'script', 'effortlessly', 'comedy', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'truely', 'blank', 'slate-her', 'acting', 'range', 'zero', 'be', 'playing', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'FEELS', 'long', 'Cheadle', 'storyline', 'get', 'dropped', 'large', 'portions', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'ca', ""n't"", 'land', 'part', 'will', 'give', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'not', 'very', 'memorable', 'film']",N/A

Trust the majority this one time. The bombers critique it with comments like:""Normally with a straightforward premise like this, you expect it to be more than JUST about someone helping someone else overcome depression (or whatever his problem was, I don't even care at this point), you expect either: 1) clever writing, or 2) a great character based story that makes you really care about the characters, or 3) an inspirational story of human triumph.  Or,Not like I thought this was going to be some feel good movie but you wanted to hang yourself it was so depressing and with no real resolution.""If you're looking for a nice, tidy 'Hollywood resolution' or a nice clean, recipe-laden Hollywood narrative in a drama about human interactions involving grief, this ain't that movie. You'll need to be a little more pensive than that. This ain't that story about human triumph, nor is it a great ""character-based"" story. It's just a fictitious tale about a character slugging through daily life crushed by the weight of his own demons. ""Clever writing"" doesn't usually produce good acting in and of itself; that comes from the cast, and its' audience has to be able to flow with it; if you're one of that kind of audience that has to be led to the ""magic-of-Hollyood"" clean conclusion, skip this movie.One criticism I'd agree with though; there is a ditzy ""female logic"" purported in the storyline that might make ""Hollywood sense"" but real women don't act that way. (Sure, there might be the ""off-the-deep-end PMS victims"" who behave as depicted, but who in the population has actually met someone like that??)Cheadle and Sandler are phenomenal--and I can't stand Sandler's performances in the several Sandler vehicles I've seen. Enough that I'd given up renting movies in which he's the lead; why he's popular as even a comedian just baffles me (as did Woody Allen, Don Knotts, Tim Conway, Lucy, et. al.) I rented this movie solely on Don Cheadle's drawing power, hoping he could carry the story line and Adam Sandler with his acting ability. He didn't have to; Sandler carried his own weight with aplomb. If this is Sandler's break-out drama role, he did a fine job, and I'm a convert.This is NOT a movie about 9/11; 9/11 is the 'circumstance' that foments the Fineman character's grief and is the causal moment that spurs his conduct. That's all 9/11 does for this film; it's the medium that ties the characters together, but only as the incident that caused deaths--9/11 is not the story here--neither is this a story about one character helping another (though it is)--it's a drama depicting how the conduct of one affects so many others. This is just a fine character study; that's all it is.

1075509,A1MZW5Z6RFSIZI,B000QFCCQY,"Old School Gamer ""What the hell's a gigawatt!?!""","[1, 1]","I love Adam Sandler, first off. I'm a huge fan of idiotic comedies such as Billy Madison and grew up as a teen about the same time they came out, so he's a bit of a favirote of mine as a comedic actor. The best part I think about Adam is that he does most of the writing and stuff for his material and LOVES to bring in his friends to play a small role in almost every movie he makes. Recently, however, his movies have developed a lot more plot sense and they are becoming less and less like the Adam we all know and love, such as 40 First Dates(a very sweet love story, but hilarious all the while) and Reign Over Me.This movie came as a bit of a surprise for me and my fiance. I had no idea it had a contextual story based on the events of 9/11 until I watched it. There have been a few stinkers in my mind(Twin Towers and the other film I forget the name of right now) that tried to represent a real picture of the 9/11 tragedy. This movie is not in any way like those movies. Reign Over Me attemptes to portray a real life, honest-to-goodness account of someone who's life was directly impacted by the attack, but it never takes center stage.Adam plays Charlie Fineman, a man who has lost himself in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. I don't like giving too mucgh info on the plot so, long storry short, Don Cheadle is an old, but very close, friend to Charlie and discovers him one day in New York and they begin to rekindle the friendship they once had. The friendship serves as he backbone of the entire movie and is really heartwarming, I must say, you feel like Sandler and Cheadle have been friends for years and they do exceedingly well at pulling off their respective roles. Cheadle's character also stands to gain a lot of perspective from this renewed friendship and the bond they reforge is eventually what causes Charlie to begin to come back to reality. There is a moment in the movie, I won't say which because you'll know if you watch it, where both I and my fiance could not help but cry. Sandler's performance truelly surprised me and I am extremelly happy to say it shows his real skill as an actor. I'm not much of a cryer myself, being a ""man"" and all >.&lt; but I recently rewatched the movie, by myself, and I cried harder this time than I did the first. I already love Cheadle as an actor and he is very well known as a strong support or lead ever since Hotel Rowanda, so I don't think I need to say much about his performance at all.All in all, I think this movie should have been nominated for some academy awards but it was overlooked, most likelly due to the fact that Adam Sandler was cast as the lead and god forbid they take him seriously. This movie is funny, sad, happy, heart-wrenching, and ultimatelly satisfying and I hope this review makes more people go out and buy it because I honestly feel you will walk away from the experience feeling nearly as satisfied as I did.",5,Adam Sandler's definitive drama role and a very nice surprise!,1219190400,"08 20, 2008",2008,2907,"['love', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'first', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'idiotic', 'comedies', 'such', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'grew', 'up', 'teen', 'same', 'time', 'came', 'out', 'bit', 'favirote', 'mine', 'comedic', 'actor', 'best', 'part', 'think', 'Adam', 'most', 'writing', 'stuff', 'material', 'LOVES', 'bring', 'friends', 'play', 'small', 'role', 'almost', 'movie', 'Recently', 'however', 'movies', 'have', 'developed', 'lot', 'more', 'plot', 'sense', 'are', 'becoming', 'less', 'less', 'Adam', 'know', 'love', 'such', '40', 'First', 'Dates', 'very', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'hilarious', 'while', 'Reign', 'Over', 'Me.This', 'movie', 'came', 'bit', 'surprise', 'fiance', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'contextual', 'story', 'based', 'events', '9/11', 'watched', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'stinkers', 'mind', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'other', 'film', 'forget', 'name', 'right', 'now', 'tried', 'represent', 'real', 'picture', '9/11', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'not', 'way', 'movies', 'Reign', 'Me', 'portray', 'real', 'life', 'honest-to-goodness', 'account', 'someone', 'who', 'life', 'was', 'directly', 'impacted', 'attack', 'never', 'center', 'stage.Adam', 'Charlie', 'Fineman', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'wake', '9/11', 'attacks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'giving', 'too', 'mucgh', 'info', 'plot', 'so', 'long', 'storry', 'short', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'old', 'very', 'close', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'one', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'begin', 'rekindle', 'friendship', 'once', 'had', 'friendship', 'serves', 'backbone', 'entire', 'movie', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'must', 'say', 'feel', 'Sandler', 'Cheadle', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'years', 'do', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'pulling', 'off', 'respective', 'roles', 'Cheadle', 'character', 'also', 'gain', 'lot', 'perspective', 'renewed', 'friendship', 'bond', 'reforge', 'eventually', 'what', 'Charlie', 'begin', 'come', 'back', 'reality', 'moment', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', ""'ll"", 'know', 'watch', 'where', 'fiance', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'cry', 'Sandler', 'performance', 'truelly', 'surprised', 'am', 'extremelly', 'happy', 'say', 'real', 'skill', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'cryer', 'being', 'man', '>', 'lt', 'recently', 'rewatched', 'movie', 'cried', 'harder', 'time', 'did', 'first', 'already', 'love', 'Cheadle', 'actor', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'strong', 'support', 'lead', 'ever', 'Hotel', 'Rowanda', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'say', 'much', 'performance', 'all.All', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'academy', 'awards', 'was', 'overlooked', 'most', 'likelly', 'due', 'fact', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'was', 'cast', 'lead', 'god', 'forbid', 'take', 'seriously', 'movie', 'funny', 'sad', 'happy', 'heart-wrenching', 'ultimatelly', 'satisfying', 'hope', 'review', 'more', 'people', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'honestly', 'feel', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'experience', 'feeling', 'nearly', 'as', 'satisfied', 'did']",N/A

How would you deal with the reality that changed in the space of a day?  That very morning you are seeing your family off then the next moment they are gone forever.

How does one deal with that harsh reality?This drama is not pretty in it's presentation of one who does not want to face this reality.  However what triumphs ultimately is a friendship that has gone though extremely trying times.  It also reminds us how we just want to just ""sweep things under the rug"", or ""take the easy way out"".

Though the first ten or fifteen minutes were slightly slow (Don't hold it against me, I'm a Joss Whedon fan and my standards are quite high), when the plot got rolling, I was captivated.  This character-driven story isn't just another ""big event rocks the life of a regular person"" cheesy tear fest.  What we get here is a heartfelt story that treats the audience like intelligent human beings, giving us heavy doses of both comedy and drama.There are many things going on during this movie and sometimes the focus of the film isn't maintained as well as I would have liked.  The movie begins with Johnson (Don Cheadle) as the main character and the center of the action, but as the story develops and we're introduced to the life of Charlie (Adam Sandler), this character suddenly becomes the entire focus of the film.  While this might have been necessary for the story that had to be told, it was a bit awkward to suddenly shift Cheadle's character into the supporting role.  However, what I did like was the continuity of the film.  The ""protagonist shift"" I mentioned earlier was atoned for by allowing Johnson (Cheadle) the final scene, as well as the fact that the movie was book ended with scenes of a character riding a motor scooter through the city.I'm a guy that's usually able to figure out how movies will end before they do.  However (except for one plot line which I had figured out) ""Reign Over Me"" kept me guessing until the credits started rolling.

His old college roommate Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) crosses paths with him years later, but he barely recognizes him.  Charlie has quit his dental practice, and he is living in his own world as he tries to forget his family as his way of coping with the pain.  Alan catches up with him, and the two begin to hang out.  Alan is married with his own family, but he feels smothered by his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith).  While they are at very different places in their lives, the both lack a good friend that they can just talk to.  That is what propels the story of the movie.  I liked they way that the two of them just hung out to have fun and do things.  Naturally there is some tension as Alan tries to help Charlie deal with his grief.  However, Reign Over Me is a movie that has many laughs in spite of the sad underlying story.  Cheadle and Sandler have great chemistry, and the supporting cast brings the goods as well.  This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie ala Waterboy or You Don't Mess With The Zohan, but he is great in this setting too.  There's not a lot to speak of in the way of extras.  There is a jam session where Cheadle plays bass and Sandler plays guitar as they make up a song.

1075521,AYZO4X4MGKK4U,B000QFCCQY,"Roberto H ""Lover of libros""","[4, 5]","By examining one man's emotional damage caused by 9/11, this movie explores the broader concept of what it means to create expectations for and seek control over other peoples' lives.After his wife and daughters die aboard one of the 9/11 planes, Adam Sandler just wants to be left alone to deal with matters his own way; however, his friends and in-laws don't agree with the way he's going about it; i.e. by withdrawing to a secluded life mostly filled with video games, Chinese food, kitchen remodeling, and record collecting.When his college roommate, Don Cheadle, spots him on his scooter and flags him down, he's open to rekindling their friendship because Cheadle hasn't seen him since he got married; thus, is incapable of bringing up any reminders of what life was like immediately before the tragedy.  Despite this apparent safeguard, Cheadle repeatedly urges Sandler to seek psychological help, efforts upon which Sandler heavily and angrily resists.Cheadle realizes that, by deciding what's right for Sandler, he too is giving in to the desire for control.  In facing this, Cheadle regretfully realizes that his own life is controlled by others' expectations and not really by what he desires.  When he stops controlling Sandler's life, Cheadle then confronts those seeking to control his.  This brings him great relief.This idea of letting people do what they want is a common theme in Sandler's work.  It can be seen in Big Daddy, where Sandler allows his adopted son to make his own mistakes instead of bossing him around.  It is also seen in the Waterboy, where Sandler must resist an overbearing mother to play football.  And, Happy Gilmore is all about Sandler's quest to reject others' ideas of how he should behave on the golf course.Whether or not you fully agree with this laissez faire notion, it's certainly worth considering.

1075522,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000QFCCQY,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Adam Sandler takes on one of his rare dramatic roles in ""Reign Over Me,"" playing a man suffering from acute post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the loss of his wife and daughters on 9/11.  Once a successful dentist, Charlie Fineman has now retreated to a world of his own, cut off from friends, family members and even the memories of his old life.  Don Cheadle plays Alan Johnson, Charlie's former college roommate with a successful dental practice of his own who runs into Charlie on the street one day and slowly, tentatively offers him the hand of friendship.  The movie chronicles the slow but steady healing process that takes place as a result of that friendship.Given the setup, one wouldn`t expect Alan to turn out to be the more complex, layered and compelling of the two characters.  But in writer/director Mike Binder's gifted hands, we come to see that Alan is struggling every bit as much as Charlie is with his own set of weaknesses, insecurities and inadequacies, albeit not in so obvious a fashion.  For the major difference between Alan and Charlie is that Alan can at least manage to hold his life together and remain a productive adult while Charlie clearly cannot.  Is Alan drawn to Charlie because he sincerely wants to help him, or is he drawn to him because, in some strange way, he envies the freedom that Charlie`s dysfunctional life affords him?  Or is it a little of both?  The beauty of the character - and of Cheadle's magnificently rich interpretation of him - is that we never really know the answer to those questions.Binder is notably less successful at getting into Charlie`s head, partly because Sandler's performance, while not bad, lacks the subtle shadings we find in Cheadle's.  Still, there are  moments in which Sandler effectively captures the heartbreaking pain that his character is going through.  The movie also boasts very fine work from Jada Pinkett Smith, as Alan's wife; Melinda Dillon as Charlie's concerned mother-in-law; Saffron Burrows as a mentally disturbed patient who comes on to Alan in his office; Liv Tyler as a compassionate psychiatrist; and Paula Newsome as Alan's sassy office receptionist who provides some much needed humor to lighten the load.The movie could be criticized for having a few too many subplots cluttering up the main storyline, but I argue that it is those very subplots that are indispensable to the movie, since they help to flesh out Alan's character and world.  It's true that the film does run on too long and that it occasionally feels a bit too contrived, simplistic and cutesy for its own good, but, on the whole, this is a moving, thoughtful film that treats both its subject matter and its audience with the respect they deserve.",4,thoughtful film with a great Cheadle performance,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,2731,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'one', 'rare', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'Reign', 'Me', 'playing', 'man', 'suffering', 'acute', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'brought', 'loss', 'wife', 'daughters', '9/11', 'Once', 'successful', 'dentist', 'Charlie', 'Fineman', 'now', 'retreated', 'world', 'own', 'cut', 'off', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'even', 'memories', 'old', 'life', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Alan', 'Johnson', 'Charlie', 'former', 'college', 'roommate', 'successful', 'dental', 'practice', 'own', 'who', 'Charlie', 'street', 'one', 'day', 'slowly', 'tentatively', 'hand', 'friendship', 'movie', 'slow', 'steady', 'healing', 'process', 'place', 'result', 'setup', 'one', 'wouldn', 't', 'expect', 'Alan', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'layered', 'compelling', 'two', 'characters', 'writer/director', 'Mike', 'Binder', 'gifted', 'hands', 'come', 'see', 'Alan', 'struggling', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'Charlie', 'own', 'set', 'weaknesses', 'insecurities', 'inadequacies', 'not', 'so', 'obvious', 'fashion', 'major', 'difference', 'Alan', 'Charlie', 'Alan', 'can', 'least', 'manage', 'hold', 'life', 'together', 'remain', 'productive', 'adult', 'Charlie', 'clearly', 'can', 'not', 'Alan', 'drawn', 'Charlie', 'sincerely', 'help', 'because', 'strange', 'way', 'freedom', 'Charlie', 's', 'dysfunctional', 'life', 'affords', 'little', 'beauty', 'character', 'Cheadle', 'magnificently', 'rich', 'interpretation', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'answer', 'questions.Binder', 'notably', 'less', 'successful', 'getting', 'Charlie', 's', 'head', 'partly', 'Sandler', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'subtle', 'shadings', 'find', 'Cheadle', 'Still', 'are', 'moments', 'Sandler', 'effectively', 'heartbreaking', 'pain', 'character', 'going', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'work', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'Alan', 'wife', 'Melinda', 'Dillon', 'Charlie', 'concerned', 'mother-in-law', 'Saffron', 'Burrows', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'patient', 'who', 'Alan', 'office', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'compassionate', 'psychiatrist', 'Paula', 'Newsome', 'Alan', 'sassy', 'office', 'receptionist', 'who', 'much', 'needed', 'humor', 'lighten', 'load.The', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'criticized', 'having', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'cluttering', 'up', 'main', 'storyline', 'argue', 'very', 'subplots', 'are', 'indispensable', 'movie', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'Alan', 'character', 'world', 'true', 'film', 'run', 'too', 'long', 'occasionally', 'bit', 'too', 'contrived', 'simplistic', 'cutesy', 'own', 'good', 'whole', 'moving', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'audience', 'respect', 'deserve']",N/A

1075525,A2SPI5WNZLOJ2U,B000QFCCQY,Sal Nudo,"[7, 11]","It took a while to pinpoint what bothered me about ""Reign Over Me,"" and surprisingly, those thoughts brought me back to another Adam Sandler movie,Spanglish, to conclude what the problem was. In ""Spanglish,"" Sandler plays the slushy role of a good-hearted husband married to a thoroughly high-strung, obsessive woman acted a bit too dramatically by Tea Leoni. Throughout ""Spanglish,"" I never believed that the childlike Sandler could be attracted to, much less have married, such a woman, despite the ""opposites attract"" attraction that often brings couples together. Sandler's role didn't seem believable to me, possibly because of his one-dimensional acting skills, so I never got absorbed into ""Spanglish"" like many others did.Fast forward to 2007's ""Reign Over Me."" I understand that each person deals with grief in his or her own manner, but the way Sandler's character so sweepingly changes after losing his entire family in one of the 9/11 plane crashes never came off as plausible to me. At the risk of sounding heartless, are we seriously supposed to believe that a once prospering, doting father and husband has transformed to a complete jerk who grows out his hair, rides a stand-up scooter, plays drums in a horrible rock band, collects vinyl albums and sits obsessively in front of the TV playing a weird video game all day? Throw in a touch of schizophrenia and you have the gist of Sandler's character. I'm no expert on post-traumatic disorder, but there are sadly loads of men and women throughout the world who have had to deal with losing entire families because of some sad tragedy. In the bookA Thousand Splendid Sunsby Khaled Hosseini, for example, one Afghan character dealt with the same type of tragedy Sandler did in ""Reign Over Me,"" but her tough journey did not lead to eccentricity or even that much self-pity, as Sandler's did. She simply picked up the scattered pieces of her life, albeit in a very depressed mode at first, and got on with it -- like adults do.But Sandler never once acts like an adult in ""Reign Over Me,"" indicating that he was perhaps predisposed toward mental illness even if his family had not perished in a plane crash. The scene where he is dragged out of the courtroom kicking and screaming, headphones and music firmly attached to his head, is overwrought, unlikely and actually embarrassing to watch. I could fathom Sandler angrily stomping out of the courtroom or perhaps telling off the people trying to hurt him, but his childish tantrum made him come off as an immature 8-year-old kid, rather than a man dealing with his formidable depression. What's worse is that Sandler's character, despite displaying acts of aggression, violence, immaturity and genuine craziness throughout the movie, seems to blithely land on his feet. And oh yeah, in typical Hollywood fashion, he also manages to get the beautiful girl in the end, a girl who was attracted to Don Cheadle's straight-laced character at the start of the movie, but puzzlingly becomes drawn in to Sandler, a long-haired manic depressive who can barely eke out two words to her. In fairness, Sandler's new lady friend was attracted to the loner-ish side of Cheadle, which Sandler's character displayed in spades, so perhaps that's what drew her in to Sandler in the end. Nonetheless, the ending seemed a bit too tidy. Sandler seemed like a man who perhaps DID need to be institutionalized or receive medicine, but the ending makes it seem like he's suddenly magically cured, which is actually a mockery of true mental illness.The premise of this movie was promising: two old college friends who reunite and reconnect, one of them suffering from a major life tragedy. But between Sandler's unlikely character and the forced, unneeded drama going on in Cheadle's life, I never bought most of this story. A thoughtful, realistic drama about how an actual person deals with the aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy would make for a poignant drama. Unfortunately, ""Reign Over Me"" blatantly relies too much on Hollywood schmaltz and classic rock music to make it a worthy flick.",2,Hollywood's schmaltzy aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy,1198540800,"12 25, 2007",2007,4079,"['took', 'while', 'pinpoint', 'what', 'bothered', 'Reign', 'Me', 'surprisingly', 'thoughts', 'brought', 'back', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'Spanglish', 'conclude', 'what', 'problem', 'was', 'Spanglish', 'Sandler', 'slushy', 'role', 'good-hearted', 'husband', 'married', 'thoroughly', 'high-strung', 'obsessive', 'woman', 'acted', 'bit', 'too', 'dramatically', 'Tea', 'Leoni', 'Spanglish', 'never', 'believed', 'childlike', 'Sandler', 'could', 'be', 'attracted', 'much', 'less', 'have', 'married', 'woman', 'opposites', 'attract', 'attraction', 'often', 'couples', 'together', 'Sandler', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believable', 'possibly', 'one-dimensional', 'acting', 'skills', 'never', 'got', 'absorbed', 'Spanglish', 'many', 'others', 'did.Fast', 'forward', '2007', 'Reign', 'Me', 'understand', 'person', 'deals', 'grief', 'own', 'manner', 'way', 'Sandler', 'character', 'so', 'sweepingly', 'changes', 'losing', 'entire', 'family', 'one', '9/11', 'plane', 'crashes', 'never', 'came', 'off', 'plausible', 'risk', 'sounding', 'heartless', 'are', 'seriously', 'supposed', 'believe', 'once', 'prospering', 'doting', 'father', 'husband', 'transformed', 'complete', 'jerk', 'who', 'out', 'hair', 'stand-up', 'scooter', 'drums', 'horrible', 'rock', 'band', 'vinyl', 'albums', 'sits', 'obsessively', 'front', 'TV', 'playing', 'weird', 'video', 'game', 'day', 'Throw', 'touch', 'schizophrenia', 'have', 'gist', 'Sandler', 'character', ""'m"", 'expert', 'post-traumatic', 'disorder', 'are', 'sadly', 'loads', 'men', 'women', 'world', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'losing', 'entire', 'families', 'sad', 'tragedy', 'bookA', 'Thousand', 'Splendid', 'Sunsby', 'Khaled', 'Hosseini', 'example', 'one', 'Afghan', 'character', 'dealt', 'same', 'type', 'tragedy', 'Sandler', 'did', 'Reign', 'Me', 'tough', 'journey', 'did', 'not', 'lead', 'eccentricity', 'even', 'much', 'self-pity', 'Sandler', 'did', 'simply', 'picked', 'up', 'scattered', 'pieces', 'life', 'albeit', 'very', 'depressed', 'mode', 'first', 'got', 'adults', 'do.But', 'Sandler', 'never', 'once', 'adult', 'Reign', 'Me', 'indicating', 'was', 'perhaps', 'predisposed', 'mental', 'illness', 'even', 'family', 'had', 'not', 'perished', 'plane', 'crash', 'scene', 'where', 'dragged', 'courtroom', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'headphones', 'music', 'firmly', 'attached', 'head', 'overwrought', 'unlikely', 'actually', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'could', 'fathom', 'Sandler', 'angrily', 'stomping', 'courtroom', 'perhaps', 'telling', 'off', 'people', 'trying', 'hurt', 'childish', 'tantrum', 'made', 'come', 'off', 'immature', '8-year-old', 'kid', 'rather', 'man', 'dealing', 'formidable', 'depression', 'What', 'worse', 'Sandler', 'character', 'displaying', 'acts', 'aggression', 'violence', 'immaturity', 'genuine', 'craziness', 'movie', 'blithely', 'land', 'feet', 'oh', 'yeah', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fashion', 'also', 'get', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'end', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'attracted', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'straight-laced', 'character', 'start', 'movie', 'puzzlingly', 'drawn', 'Sandler', 'long-haired', 'manic', 'depressive', 'who', 'can', 'barely', 'eke', 'out', 'two', 'words', 'fairness', 'Sandler', 'new', 'lady', 'friend', 'was', 'attracted', 'loner-ish', 'side', 'Cheadle', 'Sandler', 'character', 'displayed', 'spades', 'so', 'perhaps', 'what', 'drew', 'Sandler', 'end', 'Nonetheless', 'ending', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'tidy', 'Sandler', 'seemed', 'man', 'who', 'perhaps', 'DID', 'need', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'receive', 'medicine', 'ending', 'seem', 'suddenly', 'magically', 'cured', 'actually', 'mockery', 'true', 'mental', 'illness.The', 'premise', 'movie', 'was', 'promising', 'two', 'old', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'reunite', 'reconnect', 'one', 'suffering', 'major', 'life', 'tragedy', 'Sandler', 'unlikely', 'character', 'forced', 'unneeded', 'drama', 'going', 'Cheadle', 'life', 'never', 'bought', 'most', 'story', 'thoughtful', 'realistic', 'drama', 'how', 'actual', 'person', 'deals', 'aftermath', '9/11', 'tragedy', 'would', 'make', 'poignant', 'drama', 'Unfortunately', 'Reign', 'Me', 'blatantly', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'schmaltz', 'classic', 'rock', 'music', 'make', 'worthy', 'flick']",N/A

Cheadle's character's dedication to Sandler's is truly unique in a world where ""close friends"" wouldn't put up with such grief and unconventional behavior.

1075535,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000QFCCQY,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[34, 42]","Although I found this film to be powerful, I do have some issues with it that may displease Sandler fans.I will dispense with any film synopsis here as Amazon's review is about as perfect as you can get.  It is a must read, so do so.  My focus here is my personal take on the film as a former New Yorker who has yet to deal with his own losses from 9/11, and as someone who is not a Adam Sandler fan.Let me begin with all that is wrong with this film and then go to all that is right and right enough that I highly recommend this film in spite of its flaws.  For starters, Adam Sandler is not my favorite actor, dramatic or otherwise.  However, I absolutely admired him inClickand thought that kind of comedy/drama was perfect for him and I even thought he should have received a Best Actor nod for that work (but that genre rarely gets properly noticed).This film, however, IS NOT the kind of drama for Sandler even though I will say he had some very compelling moments and was good overall.  The problem I have is that I don't think it was a stretch for him to act childish as a grown man in this film where he felt the need to retreat to a more gentle time.  He was simply being Sandler there.  His dramatic moments ranged from believable and compelling to silly and over-the-top.  He was not consistent.  He was simply a distraction to a terrific story that should have been more the focus.My other issue with this film is the heavy-handed handling of Sandler's psychological problems and overly simplistic dialogue at times, such as, ""It hurts me to remember things.""  Oh, please!  I cringe at lines like that in a serious film about mental disorders as it makes the illness seem all too easy to treat and it's not.  Besides, no one talks like that.  In addition, the film tries too hard to be a comedy/drama with the storyline about the dentist, played by Don Cheadle, who is being sexually harassed by a patient.  Hey, I'm not saying it isn't funny;  I found it hysterical.  I just think it was a poor fit with the dramatic components of this particular story.  The comedy/drama genre is always a tough one in which to strike a balance between everyday humor that can be found within a tragic situation.  This film, I think, failed to do that effectively.Okay, enough bashing of this film.  Why in the world would I give four stars to a film in which I could write so many negative comments?  That's easy, the story itself is compelling and poignant. It speaks volumes for the many survivors of 9/11 who became indirect victims on that day.  Many of them have a voice, but have lost it somehow.  We ALL lost something that day: many lost friends and loved ones, and others lost a sense of security and others even innocence.  The effects of that day continue to ripple out like a boulder thrown into the center of a calm lake.  More than just our landscaped changed that day and this film sensitively handles all that I've mentioned in addition to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the value of friendship and compassion.The performance by Sandler, while distracting and uneven, is good and even very good sporadically in this film.  He looks scarily like Bob Dylan here, but that's a side note.  He's simply okay enough to carry the role even though I think he was miscast and that this role was a bit beyond him.  Don Cheadle, who was robbed of an Oscar for his subtle but powerful performance inHotel Rwanda, is very good here.  He isn't asked to bring any enormous depth to his character, but Cheadle always delivers well whatever he is asked to do.  I never miss a film he's in and neither should you.  Jada Picket Smith (AKA Mrs. Will Smith) continues to grow as an actress with quiet, but meaningful roles like this one.  She has successfully been moving away from those loud, in-your-face roles that plagued her early career.The direction is confident enough, if not a bit pedestrian at times.  The film is delivered much likeThe Pursuit of Happynesswas delivered.  It has a TV-movie feel, but it is executed well.  The film isn't perfect by any means, however, it is a small but important film and I'm glad that I watched it.In conclusion and on a personal note, it important to observe that we all lost something on 9/11, some indirectly and some directly.  As former New Yorkers, my wife and I lost co-workers, friends, and a sense of security oddly found in the skyline of that great city that no longer looks as it did when we last were there.  We both worked in and around The World Trade Centers (I actually witnessed them be built).  I worked at the base in a department store and my wife worked on the 96th floor for a bank.  It's hard to imagine that most of our co-workers and friends from there are gone.  I have yet to return to New York, but I know I will one day; I must.  In the meantime, I find films like this one to be an emotional outlet, a reminder of the fragility of life and the evil man is capable of committing, and the fight to survive that is in all of us.With Respect,Steve",4,A compelling and compassionate film that also has its humorous moments.,1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,5018,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'powerful', 'do', 'have', 'issues', 'may',

And the story was original and really yanks at the heart, a tear jerker.  I hope that this may make the acadamy's table for next years oscars, even if it's just for the soundtrack.
