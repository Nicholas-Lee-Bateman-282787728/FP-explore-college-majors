1586266,A3HOBP97RKKY0M,B00965ZJT2,J. Wiles Parker,"[4, 4]","I love this show.  My only complaint is that there is not more it.  Twenty Twelve follows the fake Olympic Deliverance Commission as they prepare for the London 2012 Olympic games.  The cast of characters is highlighted by established comedic and dramatic British actors such as Hugh Bonneville, Jessica Hynes, and Olivia Colman.  The more they say, the more you realize that they're all good at talking, but not at creating anything of substance.  The show follow The Office style of filming, but each exchange is carefully crafted to feel as real as possible while still leaving you laughing and frustrated.  Its too bad that BBC America buried this late on a weekend night, because I think it could have been huge in the states.  However, that has now been remedied by the release of the complete series on DVD.  The only thing lacking is special features as the included cast and crew interviews are all too short.  There may only be 13 episodes, but they're well worth the money if you like absurdist comedy.",5,My New Favorite Show,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,1013,"['love', 'show', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'more', 'Twenty', 'Twelve', 'fake', 'Olympic', 'Deliverance', 'Commission', 'prepare', 'London', '2012', 'Olympic', 'games', 'cast', 'characters', 'highlighted', 'established', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'British', 'actors', 'such', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'Jessica', 'Hynes', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'more', 'say', 'more', 'realize', ""'re"", 'good', 'talking', 'not', 'creating', 'anything', 'substance', 'show', 'follow', 'Office', 'style', 'filming', 'exchange', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'feel', 'as', 'real', 'possible', 'still', 'leaving', 'laughing', 'frustrated', 'too', 'bad', 'BBC', 'America', 'buried', 'late', 'weekend', 'night', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'states', 'However', 'now', 'been', 'remedied', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'DVD', 'only', 'thing', 'lacking', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'cast', 'crew', 'interviews', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'may', 'only', 'be', '13', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'well', 'money', 'like', 'absurdist', 'comedy']",Twenty Twelve: The Complete Series

1586268,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00965ZJT2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[20, 20]","Note: I wish both seasons of ""Twenty Twelve"" had been packaged and released for all markets prior to the Olympic Games! Seems like great cross-promotional opportunity was missed!A perfect companion piece for the recent 2012 Olympic games, ""Twenty Twelve"" is so of-the-moment that I'm afraid it will be forgotten soon after the games end. And that would be a shame! This incisive British mockumentary series expertly skewers the trails and tribulations of the individuals responsible for prepping London for the impending competition. Shot over two seasons, the entire run of the series is only 13 episodes with Season One comprised of six and Season Two of seven. I watched both seasons back to back and that seemed an ideal prelude to seeing the Olympics in an amusing new light. What ""Twenty Twelve"" does well, it does exceedingly well. Strikingly, the show feels both incredibly real and absolutely absurd and this is a difficult balancing act to pull off. It's not an easy job preparing for a world event, and our hapless heroes are tasked with making everyone content at every moment in the most politically correct manner possible. And that's a task that just might be too big! The humor, for the most part, is quite subtle but there are plenty of big laughs as ordinary plans tend to go way off track into escalating mayhem.The episodes are shot in a faux documentary style complete with a hysterical narration that points out the obvious at every turn. Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey) plays the head of the Deliverance Committee and, although often flustered, he tries to maintain the voice of reason throughout. His staff includes Amelia Bullmore (Head of Sustainability), Vincent Franklin (Head of Contracts), Karl Theobald (Head of Infrastructure), and Jessica Hynes (Head of Brand). An invaluable Olivia Colman plays Bonneville's too-good-to-be-true assistant and her palpable longing for him is one of the show's most effective and bittersweet elements. Long running gags include Theobald's challenge with the impending traffic nightmare (and aversion to deadlines) and Bullmore's struggle delineating Sustainability and Legacy. I know it doesn't sound funny, but the ridiculous distinction between these two departments really sticks out in my mind! For my money, though, the MVP of ""Twenty Twelve"" is Hynes. Maybe I have had nothing but negative interactions with Public Relations professionals, but Hynes nails the indifference, cluelessness, and sheer obliviousness of someone who hasn't any real contribution to give but still thinks they're in charge. She is so funny and scarily real.I can understand why some may feel that ""Twenty Twelve"" lacks expected jokes. It does. Instead, it mines its humor from realistic situations. It falls closer in the comedy spectrum to satire than to anything else. While most of my favorite episodes pop up in Season Two, Season One's ill-fated bus journey of Episode Two and the motivational speaking in Episode Four are absolutely priceless. If you like British humor, I highly suggest you check out ""Twenty Twelve."" Colman and Bonneville were both nominated for BAFTAs for their work on the series, but the cast is uniformly expert. And one more shout-out to Hynes for her astute and memorable performance. One more way to celebrate the 2012 games, I had quite a bit of fun with this one.
