It's more of a drama than a thriller-horror if it even is a thriller at all. It's not even good, and there's only one creepy scene; when she looks into the mirror and a creepy face is right next to her. That's the only relatively scary scene. It looks more like a show on the CW than a horror movie, seriously. I also don't like that weird athiest message at the end either.

I'm not above loving bad movies just for their entertainment value, so I guess you could just say I'm not super picky...Unfortunately this movie wasn't very good. It also wasn't scary, AT ALL and I am a total scaredy cat. There was one scene that startled me, but it was for about 2 seconds. That was also the only scene I recall with any kind of special effect. I'm not crazy into special effects one way or another, but for those who look for that, theres not much at all.I popped it in at least figuring I would recognize some of the cast from things like 90210, Gossip Girls and Medium. It wasn't terribly bad acting, just a boring horror script, nothing unique or new.Molly Hartley is almost killed by her mother, who is now in a psych ward for attempting to out of the blue murder her daughter. Dad takes her to a new town to get a 'fresh' start, but she's hallucinating(or is she?) and having panic attacks etc etc, is she crazy like her mother?? Has a religious aspect to the ending. Whatever.That's the premise for the most part. Feels like it's been done a million times over. The special features also were boring. A couple of cast interviews but no making of featurettes, which I usually will watch even if I hated the movie to try and see at least why they bothered to make it.Lastly...whomever did the cover art has got to have a beef with AnnaLynne McCord(90210, top left of the cover), she's a pretty girl and they made her look like she just shoved a box of twinkies in her mouth!!",2,"Not good, not scary, barely even entertaining",1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,1598,"['love', 'movies', 'will', 'watch', 'just', 'anything', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'big', 'fan', 'psychological', 'horror', ""'m"", 'not', 'loving', 'bad', 'movies', 'just', 'entertainment', 'value', 'guess', 'could', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'super', 'picky', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'AT', 'ALL', 'am', 'total', 'scaredy', 'cat', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'startled', 'was', '2', 'seconds', 'was', 'also', 'only', 'scene', 'recall', 'kind', 'special', 'effect', ""'m"", 'not', 'crazy', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'way', 'who', 'look', 'not', 'much', 'all.I', 'popped', 'least', 'figuring', 'would', 'recognize', 'cast', 'things', '90210', 'Gossip', 'Girls', 'Medium', 'was', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'bad', 'acting', 'just', 'boring', 'horror', 'script', 'nothing', 'unique', 'new.Molly', 'Hartley', 'almost', 'killed', 'mother', 'who', 'now', 'psych', 'ward', 'attempting', 'blue', 'murder', 'daughter', 'Dad', 'new', 'town', 'get', ""'fresh"", 'start', 'hallucinating', 'having', 'panic', 'attacks', 'etc', 'etc', 'crazy', 'mother', 'religious', 'aspect', 'ending', 'Whatever.That', 'premise', 'most', 'part', 'Feels', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'over', 'special', 'features', 'also', 'were', 'boring', 'couple', 'cast', 'interviews', 'making', 'featurettes', 'usually', 'will', 'watch', 'even', 'hated', 'movie', 'try', 'see', 'least', 'why', 'bothered', 'make', 'it.Lastly', 'did', 'cover', 'art', 'got', 'have', 'beef', 'AnnaLynne', 'McCord', '90210', 'top', 'left', 'cover', 'pretty', 'girl', 'made', 'look', 'just', 'shoved', 'box', 'twinkies', 'mouth']",N/A

1228147,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001PPGAIU,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 6]","I enjoyed ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" ... back when it starred Sissy Spacek, was directed by Brian De Palma, and went by the title of ""Carrie."" No, we're not dealing with a full-blown rip off here, but we are dealing with two films that have annoyingly similar elements: a misunderstood teenage girl in high school; a mother who wants to ""save"" her daughter by murdering her; religious fanaticism; the maturing of supernatural powers; a frightening parable about identity and the dangers of emotional and physical development. The difference between the two films? ""Carrie"" actually made sense. And it wasn't a tame date movie geared towards a young PG-13 crowd. ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" is so juvenile in its approach to horror that the filmmakers overlooked many crucial elements, a fully realized story being one of the most important. We get an idea of what's happening, but we get no real sense of why, and what little we're told is painfully lacking in detail.This movie was not made for people like me. It was made for young adult audiences, and it shows not only through a predictable, unoriginal plot, but also through a litany of phony pop-out scares. At the start of the film, a flock of birds suddenly fly through a shot, making a seventeen-year-old girl scream. Later on, another girl awakens from a nightmare; after less than three seconds of silence, the girl's alarm clock loudly comes to life. Later still, that same girl is startled by a loud thud. When she turns around, she realizes that an assortment of mail was just delivered through the slot on her front door. None of these scares have anything to do with the story--they were included for no reason other than making the viewers jump in their seats. It's sort of like a carnival funhouse, which is filled with random frights that have no narrative connection. When you see as many horror movies as I have, you come to recognize how and when those cinematic false alarms will appear. You may also grow tired of them, as I have.The plot: the title character (Haley Bennett) is a troubled seventeen-year-old girl, having survived a viscous stabbing at the hands of her mother. Since then, her mother has been locked away in a mental institution. To make a fresh start, Molly and her father (Jake Weber) move to a new city. Once there, Molly is enrolled in a posh private high school, and it's there that she meets: Leah (Shannon Marie Woodward), a rebellious teen with an anger management problem; Suzie (AnnaLynne McCord), who's jealous and spiteful; and Alexis (Shanna Collins), a perfect Little Miss Christian who introduces herself by saying, ""Some are offended because I have a close, personal relationship with Jesus."" Molly also meets Joseph Young (Chance Crawford), who just happens to be Suzie's ex as well as the one of the richest, most popular guys on campus. He immediately takes a liking to her, although right from the start, we suspect it's for reasons other than the fact that she's a beautiful loner with a painful past.Not everything is fun and games for Molly. She begins to fear that she's just as crazy as her mother. That's because she regularly has crippling panic attacks, all of which are accompanied by disturbing visual and aural hallucinations. Many of these attacks are kick started by Alexis, who will gladly bend anyone's ear about God and Jesus and the Bible. Clearly, she's serious about her faith, and it shows in a scene in which Bibles are distributed as a companion guide to John Milton's ""Paradise Lost""; Alexis protests to her teacher, claiming that God's word should never be reduced to the level of a classroom textbook. When not in class, Alexis continuously tries to convert Molly, insisting that she's a good person who, for the sake of her immortal soul, needs to be saved. Molly refuses to listen ... until her mother (Marin Hinkle) pays her an unexpected visit. Never mind questioning how she got out of the asylum or how she knew where to find her daughter--let's just focus on the fact that she had perfectly legitimate reasons for wanting Molly dead. I won't reveal them, but I will say that lines like, ""I know what you are,"" and, ""I have to save you,"" continuously enter the conversation.When Molly hears the truth, she rushes to Alexis for help. Then she reunites with Joseph, who wants to protect her by ... oh, why am I even bothering with a plot description? Does anyone really care what this movie is about? I certainly didn't, and this was before all eight-six minutes had gone by. At the end of the film, my feelings for it shifted from dislike to apathy, which is even worse when you stop and think about it. I place most of the blame on the ending, which is incredibly vague and unsatisfying. ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" is lifeless, derivative, devoid of scares, and just plain boring. Worst of all, it didn't want to be any better than what it was, which is to say that it had no ambition to be more than a mild teen thriller. I can't say I was expecting a masterpiece, but I certainly did expect something that actually made an effort. It's a horror movie without actual horror, which may explain why it was aimed at younger audiences. God forbid they should see a movie that's too scary for them.",2,Could It Be the Devil in Me?,1226361600,"11 11, 2008",2008,5250,"['enjoyed', 'Haunting', 'Molly', 'Hartley', 'back', 'when', 'starred',

1228151,A3GV24GH1AFXDJ,B001PPGAIU,"FaithOryx ""Always Searching""","[1, 2]","This movie was really fun to watch. A lot of the reviewers compared it to ""Carrie""- but I actually got a vibe more like ""The Omen."" If Damien was a female teenager in modern day times- he would be Molly.I won't re-summarize the entire movie but basically, Molly is 17 years old and had a fairly normal life. That is, until her mother stabbed her in the chest with a pair of scissors in an effort to ""save her from the darkness."" The mother is diagnosed as delusional and locked away in a mental hospital. Molly and her father start a new life in a new house, new school, new everything.Things get creepy after that as Molly starts to hear voices and become paranoid that she herself is going crazy.  One thing I want to make clear is all the ""starts"" in this film. Some reviewers stated that they thought they were silly and lame and not scary. Like, the mail dropping through the slot and Molly jumping. I think some people missed the point. The point was to show how paranoid the character was- how terrified she had become by all the auditory hallucinations and also the PSTD effects of being brutally attacked by her mother. The mail dropping through the slot wasn't mean to startle the viewer- it startled Molly because she is so traumatized.I would have given it more stars except that there was a lot of fluff and unexplained situations. Case in point, a jealous schoolmate Suzie provokes Molly and they have a spit at a party. Molly crushes the girls arm and this scene is rather entertaining. However, later Suzie (in a zombie creepy voice)  says to Molly, ""I know what you are."" And that seemed silly. Like how does she know? What did she see? Because Molly hurt her arm she suddenly has some supernatural insight? That's the sort of plot hole fluff that, to me, was rather unnecessary. The fight scene was fine in itself. All would have been well if Suzie was just terrified of Molly instead of ""knowing something dark was there.""Anyway, I thought the film was very entertaining.

She hears strange noises, has odd visions of murdered women, and comes saddled with a boatload of family dysfunction.  But by the strict definition of actually being haunted, there's no spirits harassing poor Molly (Haley Bennett).Her actual problem is a big spoiler, so I'll leave it simply that this movie isn't a ghost story but another movie form entirely, updated to take place in high school, when everyone is painfully hip, pretty, and gets what they deserve in the end.Okay, not quite what they deserve.  The Haunting of Molly Hartley is actually an anti-fundamentalist rant; it seems poor Hartley is the target of divinely-inspired assassins who believe she is the incarnation of evil that must be destroyed. One of them happens to be Molly's mother (Marin Hinkle), who was remanded to an insane asylum.  Things go from bad to worse when Molly tries to start a new life in a new high school with her sad-sack father (Jake Weber).Unfortunately for Molly, her high school seethes with stereotypes: The handsome jock who takes an inordinate interest in her (Chace Crawford); the queen bee who hates her; the rebel girl who allies with her.  Notably, there isn't an unattractive soul in the bunch.And that's the problem with a movie that has nothing to do with ghosts.  Anyone expecting an actual haunting will be sorely disappointed by the somewhat mundane reality that at heart is every bad girl's dream: being badder than everybody else.The Haunting of Molly Hartley uses random scares to substitute for actual horror, too-cool-for-school dialogue to make up for actual dialogue, and steals another plot entirely to make up for the distinct lack of spiritual activity.

The chaotic nature of this movie keeps you entertained, whether it is with dreams that seem to be real, but are not; schizophrenic-like attacks (mostly hearing voices), water turning on by itself, etc. The scares are more the kind that make you jump than gross you out. This movie shows religious delusions and makes a wonderful parallel between religious extremists and the insane. They keep the ultra-religious ideas true to form, with for example, one extremist continuously pushing the heroine to join her church group and later on baptizing her to ""save"" her soul. The panic attacks that the heroine experiences and her worry that she will become like her insane (also religious nut) mother are very plausible, and so is her worry that her mother will get out of the mental ward and try to hurt her again.

It's good for a rental and one viewing, but not much more than that.I realized as I was writing up this review that this film was all too much like so many other ""pact with the devil"" kind of films likeRosemary's BabyandGhost Riderwherein someone wants out of the deal before it's, drum roll, ""too late"" (gasp!).  In this film couples that are about to lose their child during labor are visited by a mysterious entity that offers life to the child, but takes ownership of it at the age of 18.  This ownership consists of giving them a life of luxury, power, and popularity, but one loses his or her soul in the process.  That's about it in the nutshell for this film.Molly Hartley, very nicely and believably played by Haley Bennett, is the damsel in distress in this film.  Earlier her mother attempted to kill her, but failed and was sentenced to an insane asylum.  She is cared for by her loving and concerned dad,Medium's Jake Weber, who continues to see his deranged wife while comforting his daughter by changing schools and moving in an effort to have a fresh start.  Yup, it's that clich&eacute;-ridden.  Jake is always believable in any role I've seen him in and one wishes he had more to work with in this film, but he is solid support and even makes the clich&eacute;d moments seem more real.When Molly arrives at her new school she is assigned a student adviser/guide of sorts, Alexis, who attempts to befriend her.  She is the religious one that every pact with the devil movie has, but she's played with such honesty by Shanna Collins that she doesn't seem corny, but actual genuine in her beliefs.  Unlike other stereotypical religious zealots in films likeThe Mist, she is both pleasant and not over-the-top-in-your-face religious, although I can bet others who see her will hate her.  I actually liked Alexis and her character subtly develops in the film whereas the others are stagnant.Molly is friendly enough with Alexis, but becomes closer with the local outcast kid, Leah, who is so stereotypical in the role that you will roll your eyes and yawn at her presence.  She's the girl that no one likes because she isn't rich enough, pretty enough, or influential enough.  You've heard it all before.  Molly also befriends and catches the eye of the school hunk who appears to have won the Zach Effron,High School Musical, look-alike contest (haircut and all) and then begins to butt heads with the stereotypical jealous cheerleader ex-girlfriend.This film is a bit of every teen angst film the proceeded it and it is grating at times; however, the acting is good enough much of the time by these young actors to make the film tolerable.  Barely.What is NOT tolerable is the very unsatisfying ending.  The film focused on that we are whom we choose to be and not what others believe we are and Molly makes a clear choice near the end to NOT reap the benefits of this pact with the devil; however, after a drum roll fade out we have her basking in the joys of power and influence with absolutely no explanation as to why the change of heart. The turnaround makes no sense whatsoever.  I felt rather disgusted with the ending and it's too reminiscent of those 70's horror flicks in which the devil always won.  Here the devil wins and we don't even know why or how?  Is this the writer's idea of how to be clever and/or sophisticated?  Sorry, I just don't get it.As far as the scares go in this film, they are often not related to the actual storyline, but rather done to just get the audience to jump in their seats a bit like flying birds out of nowhere and alarm clocks going off.  Yeah, I jump in my seat from being startled like that, but that doesn't make a film scary by any means.  In fact, there really isn't anything overtly scary in this film.  It's a rather tame PG-13 movie and parents can relax in that there are no sex scenes to get worried about either.  The rating is more for the mild violence and ""adult"" themes (relating to the occult world).Overall, it's a mediocre film with a dud ending.",2,What was an average thriller is severely hampered by an unsatisfying ending.,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,4115,"[""n't"", 'bad', 'little', 'film', 'rather', 'lazy', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'viewing', 'good', 'rental', 'one', 'viewing', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'that.I', 'realized', 'was', 'writing', 'up', 'review', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'pact', 'devil', 'kind', 'films', 'likeRosemary', 'BabyandGhost', 'Riderwherein', 'someone', 'deal', 'drum', 'roll', 'too', 'late', 'gasp', 'film', 'are', 'lose', 'child', 'labor', 'are', 'visited', 'mysterious', 'entity', 'life', 'child', 'ownership', 'age', '18', 'ownership', 'giving', 'life', 'luxury', 'power', 'popularity', 'one', 'soul', 'process', 'nutshell', 'film.Molly', 'Hartley', 'very', 'nicely', 'believably', 'played', 'Haley', 'Bennett', 'damsel', 'distress', 'film', 'Earlier', 'mother', 'attempted', 'kill', 'failed', 'was', 'sentenced', 'insane', 'asylum', 'cared', 'loving', 'concerned', 'dad', 'Medium', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'who', 'see', 'deranged', 'wife', 'comforting', 'daughter', 'changing', 'schools', 'moving', 'effort', 'have', 'fresh', 'start', 'Yup', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'Jake', 'always', 'believable', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'wishes', 'had', 'more', 'work', 'film', 'solid', 'support', 'even', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'moments', 'seem', 'more', 'real.When', 'Molly', 'new', 'school', 'assigned', 'student', 'adviser/guide', 'sorts', 'Alexis', 'who', 'befriend', 'religious', 'one', 'pact', 'devil', 'movie', 'played', 'such', 'honesty', 'Shanna', 'Collins', ""n't"", 'seem', 'corny', 'actual', 'genuine', 'beliefs', 'other', 'stereotypical', 'religious', 'zealots', 'films', 'likeThe', 'Mist', 'pleasant', 'not', 'over-the-top-in-your-face', 'religious', 'can', 'bet', 'others', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'hate', 'actually', 'liked', 'Alexis', 'character', 'subtly', 'film', 'others', 'are', 'stagnant.Molly', 'friendly', 'enough', 'Alexis', 'closer', 'local', 'outcast', 'kid', 'Leah', 'who', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'will', 'roll', 'eyes', 'yawn', 'presence', 'girl', 'one', ""n't"", 'rich', 'enough', 'pretty', 'enough', 'influential', 'enough', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Molly', 'also', 'eye', 'school', 'hunk', 'who', 'have', 'won', 'Zach', 'Effron', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'look-alike', 'contest', 'haircut', 'then', 'butt', 'heads', 'stereotypical', 'jealous', 'cheerleader', 'ex-girlfriend.This', 'film', 'bit', 'teen', 'angst', 'film', 'proceeded', 'grating', 'times', 'however', 'acting', 'good', 'enough', 'much', 'time', 'young', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'tolerable', 'Barely.What', 'NOT', 'tolerable', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'film', 'focused', 'are', 'whom', 'choose', 'be', 'not', 'what', 'others', 'believe', 'are', 'Molly', 'clear', 'choice', 'end', 'NOT', 'reap', 'benefits', 'pact', 'devil', 'however', 'drum', 'roll', 'fade', 'out', 'have', 'basking', 'joys', 'power', 'influence', 'absolutely', 'explanation', 'why', 'change', 'heart', 'turnaround', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'felt', 'rather', 'disgusted', 'ending', 'too', 'reminiscent', '70', 'horror', 'flicks', 'devil', 'always', 'won', 'Here', 'devil', 'wins', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'why', 'how', 'writer', 'idea', 'how', 'be', 'clever', 'and/or', 'sophisticated', 'Sorry', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.As', 'far', 'scares', 'go', 'film', 'are', 'often', 'not', 'related', 'actual', 'storyline', 'rather', 'done', 'just', 'get', 'audience', 'jump', 'seats', 'bit', 'flying', 'birds', 'nowhere', 'alarm', 'clocks', 'going', 'off', 'Yeah', 'jump', 'seat', 'being', 'startled', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'scary', 'means', 'fact', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'overtly', 'scary', 'film', 'rather', 'tame', 'PG-13', 'movie', 'parents', 'can', 'relax', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'get', 'worried', 'rating', 'more', 'mild', 'violence', 'adult', 'themes', 'relating', 'occult', 'world', '.Overall', 'mediocre', 'film', 'dud', 'ending']",N/A

Well, seems like I spoke too soon, the production outfit that brought us ""Dragon Wars"" brings a teen drama/occult thriller in ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"". I should have known better, sure it's not the worst film I`ve ever seen, but it does come very close.Molly Hartley (pretty Haley Bennett) is a 17-year old who has experienced significant trauma in her life; her own mother tried to kill her before her 18th birthday. Now, relocated to a neighboring town with her dad (Jake Weber), Molly tries to fit in a new high school. He battles headaches and nosebleeds, voices in her head, the usual teenage issues and major concerns about her psychotic mother. She finds a small amount of comfort in religious Alexis (Shanna Collins) and bad girl Leah (Shannon Marie Woodward), the school psychiatrist (Nina Siemaszko) and finds puppy love with campus hunk Joseph (Chace Crawford). Molly's 18th birthday is looming, and she begins to fear what is going to happen--apparently, a parent killing his daughter before she turns 18 is pretty common.The film does begin in a decent manner, a father killing his daughter for an unspecified reason save for her approaching 18th birthday managed to grab my attention. Then, the film just goes downhill from there. The teen drama that follows just lost me, the film definitely took its time and the proceedings almost stops to a crawl. There are some cheap scares whenever Molly dreams and hallucinates, but none that really made me jump from my seat. Wow! This was the first time that mail delivery was used to induce a cheap jolt! The Upcoming birthday thing is abandoned for a stretched out script, and never generated a feeling of dread. The film relies on some attempts at character development that proved useless and dry. Elements were introduced, but none of them were fully fleshed out; the script was a mess and never reinforced its main concept.Ok, I managed to sit through it to find out exactly what was going to happen, well, nothing much. The final act is just an overload of demonic overtones, but none of it gave the film narrative impact. There were attempts to cover up the weaknesses of its plot by inserting scenes of potential thrills in the final act, but it just didn't work since it was backed up by the screenplay. When the satanic conspiracy and manipulations were revealed, none of it proved interesting since you can see it coming a mile away and its twists is just so perfunctory, made worse with the lack of a great set up. Director Mickey Liddell seemed very lost in the techniques of effective horror, and it was obvious that he had no idea on how to build a story around potential Armageddon.The one good thing about the film is Haley Bennett, she is remarkably charming although lacking in acting ability. I do give her the benefit of a doubt since this script is a total mess, and even an A-list actress would be lost in it. Teenage girls would swoon over Chace Crawford from ""Gossip Girl"" (my lady friends did) and it's just too bad his acting doesn't match his supposed good looks. Jake Weber was decent, but not exactly convincing, no doubt because of the idiotic script. The rest of the cast was so wooden and lacked emotion.Wow, I can't remember the last time I felt bored by a horror film. ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" had potential, but it misses its dreadful tone by a lot. The film turned out ludicrous, and I would have preferred a more ""filled"" out 18th birthday than an ending that looked lifted from ""Legally Blond"".  Did they think that this would be successful enough to spawn a sequel? What the heck were the filmmakers behind this film thinking--underestimating the tastes of hardcore horror fans??Skip It.
