Jon has a terrific comedic timing, and he shines whenever he's on screen. A proof of that is that the Daily Show got much, much better since  he started hosting it. As for this particular movie, it has a slow start,  and the first part is the hardest to get through. But once we move on to  the second things start connecting, and culminate in a sweet ending where  everything falls in place.
