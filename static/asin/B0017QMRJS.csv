The movie is a perfect complement to the show and the soundtrack.  I was a fan of Cirque's reality show, the underratedCirque du Soleil - Fire Within (TV Series).  Though I hated the manufactured drama behind the ""will he or won't he make it?"" auditioning, I loved the behind-the-scenes look at how the sausage gets made.  ""All Together Now"" succeeds for the same reason.  We see the Cirque troupe piecing together yet another show and - Nirvana to any Beatles fan - George Martin (working along son, Giles) arranging a soundtrack.  If you know the soundtrack, you know George Martin's fount of creativity is nowhere close to tapping out.I delight in knowing that ""Love"" sprung out of a friendship between George Harrison and Cirque founder Guy Lalibert&eacute;.  Harrison - always my favorite of the four - collected friends across the world from a diverse set of circles (ukulele festivals, anyone?) Lalibert&eacute; was one of those surprising connections.  ""Love"" stands as a testament to the promises made between these two as Harrison's life drew to a close.  It's wonderful that this film captures that commitment being turned into reality.",5,"Cirque fan, Beatles fan - ""All Together Now"" is like catnip for me",1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,1225,"['Beatles', 'fan', 'Cirque', 'fan', 'Together', 'Now', 'was', 'catnip', 'movie', 'perfect', 'complement', 'show', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'fan', 'Cirque', 'reality', 'show', 'underratedCirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'Fire', 'Within', 'TV', 'Series', 'hated', 'manufactured', 'drama', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'auditioning', 'loved', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'how', 'sausage', 'made', 'Together', 'Now', 'same', 'reason', 'see', 'Cirque', 'troupe', 'piecing', 'together', 'yet', 'show', 'Nirvana', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'George', 'Martin', 'working', 'along', 'son', 'Giles', 'arranging', 'soundtrack', 'know', 'soundtrack', 'know', 'George', 'Martin', 'fount', 'creativity', 'nowhere', 'close', 'tapping', 'out.I', 'delight', 'knowing', 'Love', 'sprung', 'friendship', 'George', 'Harrison', 'Cirque', 'founder', 'Guy', 'Lalibert', 'eacute', 'Harrison', 'always', 'favorite', 'four', 'collected', 'friends', 'world', 'diverse', 'set', 'circles', 'ukulele', 'festivals', 'anyone', 'Lalibert', 'eacute', 'was', 'one', 'surprising', 'connections', 'Love', 'testament', 'promises', 'made', 'two', 'Harrison', 'life', 'drew', 'close', 'wonderful', 'film', 'commitment', 'being', 'turned', 'reality']",N/A
1157761,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B0017QMRJS,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[12, 12]","In Adrian Will's documentary All Together Now the audience follows the creation of the Beatles and Cirque du Soleil's Love from its inception in a wintry Montreal to opening night at the Mirage in Las Vegas.In the beginning George Harrison  met with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte to discuss a possible collaboration between the two groups. The key was that both the Beatles and Cirque would not give up creative control of the project. Unfortunately soon after their original meeting Harrison died. Harrison's widow Olivia, along with Yoko Ono, Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr vowed to keep the project going.The documentary follows the process of getting the show on stage. Starting with concept meetings in Montreal we move through casting and recreating the Beatles music for the show. There are extensive interviews with musical directors Sir George Martin nd his son Giles on how the original music was remixewd for the show. Interviews with Apple Corps representatives detail the concern that the music be performed by the Beatles and not stage performers.After five months the show moves to its new home in Las Vegas and the creation of the theatre is shown along with the creative changes that were mandated by the production crew and director Dominic Champagne. Champagne explains at one point his concept for the show:  ""I wanted to create a Beatles experience rather than a Beatles story, taking the audience on an emotional journey rather than a chronological one, exploring the landscapes and experiences that have marked the group's history.""There are meetings with the surviving members of the Beatles and the widows and chilgren of Lennon and Harrison and the production moves into high gear as preparations are made for opening night. The film ends with clips from the premeire.All in all this is a well made documentary that takes the audience through the creative process. It will appeal more to those who have seen Love than those who have not but it is still a worthwhile viewing experience. The DVD also features three shorts on the production.",4,Creation of a Spectacle,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,2078,"['Adrian', 'Will', 'documentary', 'Together', 'Now', 'audience', 'creation', 'Beatles', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'Love', 'inception', 'wintry', 'Montreal', 'opening', 'night', 'Mirage', 'Las', 'Vegas.In', 'beginning', 'George', 'Harrison', 'met', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'founder', 'Guy', 'Laliberte', 'discuss', 'possible', 'collaboration', 'two', 'groups', 'key', 'was', 'Beatles', 'Cirque', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'creative', 'control', 'project', 'Unfortunately', 'soon', 'original', 'meeting', 'Harrison', 'died', 'Harrison', 'widow', 'Olivia', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'Sir', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Ringo', 'Starr', 'vowed', 'keep', 'project', 'going.The', 'documentary', 'process', 'getting', 'show', 'stage', 'Starting', 'concept', 'meetings', 'Montreal', 'move', 'casting', 'recreating', 'Beatles', 'music', 'show', 'are', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'musical', 'directors', 'Sir', 'George', 'Martin', 'son', 'Giles', 'how', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'remixewd', 'show', 'Interviews', 'Apple', 'Corps', 'representatives', 'detail', 'concern', 'music', 'be', 'performed', 'Beatles', 'not', 'stage', 'performers.After', 'five', 'months', 'show', 'new', 'home', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'creation', 'theatre', 'shown', 'creative', 'changes', 'were', 'mandated', 'production', 'crew', 'director', 'Dominic', 'Champagne', 'Champagne', 'one', 'point', 'concept', 'show', 'wanted', 'create', 'Beatles', 'experience', 'rather', 'Beatles', 'story', 'taking', 'audience', 'emotional', 'journey', 'rather', 'chronological', 'one', 'exploring', 'landscapes', 'experiences', 'have', 'marked', 'group', 'history', 'are', 'meetings', 'surviving', 'members', 'Beatles', 'widows', 'chilgren', 'Lennon', 'Harrison', 'production', 'high', 'gear', 'preparations', 'are', 'made', 'opening', 'night', 'film', 'clips', 'premeire.All', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'audience', 'creative', 'process', 'will', 'appeal', 'more', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Love', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'experience', 'DVD', 'also', 'three', 'shorts', 'production']",N/A
1157762,AY12DBB0U420B,B0017QMRJS,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I remember when the Beatles first appeared in the early 60s. They were a British band that did covers of American Rock 'n' Roll tunes. Quite good, actually. I wondered what these Brits were up to. Remember, this was at least several years before the ""British Invasion"" of the popular music world. And then they they started writing their own material. My, oh my, it was good! I became a Beatles fan. I suppose the culmination for me was with ""St. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" a really stunning recording! Well, the rest is history. Now I note that Lennon and McCartney are widely recognized as the greatest composers of the 20th century. They'd have my vote!All of this came to mind as I viewed the ""All Together Now"" DVD, a documentary film of the Las Vegas extravaganza ""Love"" produced by Apple Corp (The Beatles) and Cirque Du Soleil. It's an interesting film and records the efforts of producers to put together a multi-million dollar Las vegas stage presentation. Every detail was worked out to perfection. Paul McCartney, Ringo Star, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison were called in as consultants and all have major roles in the film. McCartney and Star came across as rather likable people, and rather modest, actually. I somehow felt they were a bit in awe at the efforts to construct this monumental musical and were somewhat taken back at the worshipful awe in which they were held. After all, they were just two of four Liverpool blokes who put together a Rock 'n Roll band and now, about a half century later, their efforts had come to this. Amazing, really! Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison came across as two rather pleasant women and wives of the deceased members and they were looking out after their former mates best interests, as good wives might be expected to do. It was an interesting mix of personalities and the project was just awesome. I'm sure that every true fan and collector of Beatles memories will want to have this excellent DVD.

With the DVD showing the production in Vegas with Cirque Du Soleil, all the work that went into the visual production and how much Paul, Ringo, Olivia & Dhani Harrison & Yoko Ono got involved. Much to the dismay of the ""Cirque"" crew. Over-all making a show that should be see by every Beatles fanatic! Audio - wise, what George & Giles Martin have done to recreate the music from the original master tapes, getting a digital ""joining"" and over-laping thrillride! George Martin, of course being the old school master of the recording desk. Son, Giles Martin takes the tracks into the 21st Century by bringing them to true digital form so they can be manipulated and blended into one non-stop track. If you haven't gotten the CD, what are you waiting for?! It is precise and over the top! Giles Martin knowing more about today's technology with programs like ""Pro-tools"" and the over all transfer to a format that his dad Sir George, never cared to learn because he saw no reason to. After the audio product was finished not only was Sir George smiling and amazed, so were the surviving Beatles and Beatle wives and children!The Dvd contains ""All Together Now"", a documentary film on the whole process with rehearsal and actual performance footage of ""The Cirque"" making magic with Beatle music, imagery,rare photos and of course the newly, remixed and re blended Beatle historic music. To watch the show and not be moved shows a person without a soul. I choke up every time I view the documentary.Also included is ""Changing The Music"" (22 minutes) which the title says it all. Twenty-two minutes of magic and being a ""fly on the wall"" in the studio wil Giles Martin and his Pops, Sir George adding his input. Worth getting just for this!Then, there is the process of making a 5.1 mix of the music for the teater designed for such an event. This segment is only 9 minutes but being played over a proper 5.1 audio system, it teases you and makes you want to take a road trip to Vegas!""Making Love"", a nother 10 minutes giving you an insight of how the show was designed. I predict that everyone that buys this DVD will want to hit Vegas next! With the terrible economy, it would be wise to see a travel agent to get to see the show and stay away from the casino's so you experience this show with I believe thousands of speakers! In the wall on the ceiling, in the chairs! It must be unreal to witness! I am planning my trip to Vegas myself before the show folds up. I noticed the signs were still up in the movie ""The Hangover"", so the chances are that it will be there for a good decade. In the meantime, get this ""Best Buy"" and ""Amazon"" only DVD that will take you back into an era that was so much more stable than it is in 2011. Escapism at it finest!!  I love The Beatles and look forward to sitting in the speaker chairs and being transported into a time when things were a bit more simple and stable. In hind-sight, people then, thought it was the worst of times. If they only knew, the were living in the best of times minus the Vietnam war.

Olivia hit it right on the head in a comment she made in this documentary. There's a point in the doc. where she says to the head Cirque guy, something like, ""Gee, I expected it to be more like your other shows, with more acrobatics and stunts. I hope people aren't disappointed.""For me it was worth it to get to see the live show and to hear the fabulous surround sound music George Martin and Son had cooked up! My wife was more disappointed in the show than me, as she's not AS into deep listening to the music as I am, and we'd both seen another Cirque show and were expecting something more like that.However, we did like the show, overall, and we found this documentary to be  excellent! It really made me realize how much went in to it, and it was fantastic to hear Martin and Son talking about how they did it. It seemed to me that the hardest part for the Cirque guys must have been dealing with Yoko and Olivia. I think Paul and Ringo were much easier to deal with, if the doc. is representative of how it went down.Olivia and Yoko were probably *overly* protective of their husbands' music. At one point Yoko says - after months of development - that she did not like the way they did ""Come Together"" at all! And at another point Olivia says she doesn't like 2 of the main ""characters"" at all! Yikes! The Cirque guys must have nearly gotten lockjaw as they tried to hold their tongues! ;-D Though they seemed to take it very calmly. They were more nervous about Ringo and Paul liking it, it seemed, but R&P; seemed pretty easy to please.Seeing how it all came together was really fascinating to me, and watching the doc. actually made me want to see the live show a 2nd time! I did hear they made some changes since I saw it, so it would be nice to see it again. Too bad it's so danged expensive!

I was hoping to get a film or video of the Cirque du Soleil show with all the music from show intact and the stage numbers that went with them.  NOOoooo.  You get mostly talk and talk (interesting the first time through but not for repeat listenings!) of the inception and preparation of the show and soundtrack.  It was like buying a DVD of a feature film that you had seen in the movie theatre or wanted to see and then getting the Special Features section of the DVD instead with mostly talk about the show and not the show itself.  Very few of the music numbers are even complete, most just are snipits and sound great but I felt like I was watching the Special Features from my other DVD's and was hoping for the whole show and the whole music from the show.  I was very unhappy with what I got, although as stated above worth watching ONCE.  Makes me wonder if the CD version I saw has snippits also or the entire music numbers.

I have personally seen the finished product and this documentary more than does justice to the show.  It is great to see Ringo, his wife, Paul, George's wife and Yoko, John's widow watch and really, really love this show.  I can say without a doubt that they all felt as if they were really seeing the Beatles reunited.  I would urge everyone to see this show in Vegas.  Cirque du Soleil performs choreographed routines that are smasho-boffo (to use a made up show buz term) in every sense of the word.  The show is not completely covered in this documentary but 1)  it really makes you want to go to see the live performance and 2) after seeing the live performance, it is a great reminder of all of the real highlights that are too numerous to count. I cannot recommend this documentary too highly.  The two surviving Beatles are interviewed as well as the family members of those who have gone to the great concert in the sky.  Great show, all you need is love, all you need is love, love, LOVE is all you need. She Loves You, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All of this is the truth as I know it.

The film is dedicated to the memory of Neil Aspinall, who passed away last March 2008. Being this one of the stationary shows of Cirque in Las Vegas, it is understandable that for now, a DVD release may not be viable for an ongoing show.The film starts with the story we all know in which it was George Harrison's idea to bring together the music of the Beatles with Cirque Du Soleil. From then on we see the whole creative process that ends up with the premiere with the attendance of Paul, Ringo, Olivia Harrison and Yoko Ono. All the people directly involved tell their stories and how the show materialized after struggling with so many things. As Cirque fans should know, they never let people outside the Cirque be involved in creative control, in this case, besides having Mirage and Cirque agreeing on what the show should be, there were other four people involved in the creative process, the surviving Beatles, Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. It is a little bit funny to see both Olivia and Yoko arguing with Cirque people on the things they did not like or they would prefer to see with the songs of their late husbands. In the end, as Yoko says, all they do is try to take care of the things John and George created, ""It is sad that John is now only a voice"" she points.It has some very emotional moments and the creation of the soundtrack is also covered, many fans argued if what George and Giles Martin did to the masters and the songs was the right thing to do. Paul is very direct when he says ""The fact that we (The Beatles) are allowing it should be enough for anyone"" I had mixed feelings about the music too when I first heard it, loved some songs hated some others, but when I finally saw the performance I understood that all they did was for the sake of the show and to have it flow as all Cirque shows do. The point of mixing the Beatles' songs like they did had as an only purpose to enhance the incredible visuals Cirque had created.The last 20 minutes of the documentary include some bits of the show for the people who have not had the opportunity to see it live. It is presented in anamorphic widescreen with subtitles in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese. Audio is presented in Dolby digital, Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1Extras include three more documentaries: ""Changing the music"" follows George and Giles Martin to the studio where they mixed the songs, very interesting to find out which song convinced everybody to go for the mixing. ""Music in the theatre"" shows the sound system they had to create specially for this show to have the audience fell the surround experience they designed for the music. ""Making Love"" has some examples of the performances and how they were developed, including the shadows sequences (one of my favorites), while I believed all the voices in the show were imitators, all the dialogues are actual montages from dialogues of the Beatles themselves while recording in studio!Bottom line, a great DVD, I found myself enjoying this documentary very much. This may ease for a while the wait to see a release of the show soon on DVD, hopefully BD...
