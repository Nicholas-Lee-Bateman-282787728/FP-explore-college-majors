The sound quality for the CD that comes with the DVD is awesome.  It's excellent, and I think it was recorded near flawlessly.  You can hear both guitar parts, the bass, and the drums just like you are supposed to.  As for the quality on the DVD, I believe it is the exact same if you watch in 5.1 surround.  Some of the sound is lost if you're not surround sounding it, but the quality is still more than enough to seriously rock out to.If I am going to complain about anything, it is going to be the concert footage itself.  The film is often grainy at times, and I sometimes wonder if anyone checked the stationary camera angles before pressing the ""record"" button to make sure they were actually on target.  The footage from other concert DVDs, such as Reel Big Fish's, Korn's, or Something Corporate's is crisper and cleaner, but watching Coheed rock out like that is tremendously awesome.  However they filmed it could have also done a better job of picking up the various lighting used, but still, it's a pretty sweet DVD.The price on this DVD rocks all!  $20 for both a DVD and a CD of the show?  Awesome!  Honestly, it is worth the price for the CD alone.  At this point I'm considering the DVD itself as the bonus disc because hearing Coheed live on my iPod or in my car is so intense it's amazing.  In Keeping Secrets has to be one of the best live songs ever, and the CD captures it flawlessly!",4,Awesome Freakin' Band,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1511,"['Okay', 'everyone', 'who', 'sound', 'quality', 'stinks', 'performance', 'are', 'right', 'wrong', 'sound', 'quality', 'CD', 'DVD', 'awesome', 'excellent', 'think', 'was', 'recorded', 'flawlessly', 'can', 'hear', 'guitar', 'parts', 'bass', 'drums', 'just', 'are', 'supposed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'believe', 'exact', 'same', 'watch', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'lost', ""'re"", 'not', 'surround', 'sounding', 'quality', 'still', 'more', 'enough', 'seriously', 'rock', 'out', 'to.If', 'am', 'going', 'complain', 'anything', 'going', 'be', 'concert', 'footage', 'film', 'often', 'grainy', 'times', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'anyone', 'checked', 'stationary', 'camera', 'angles', 'pressing', 'record', 'button', 'make', 'sure', 'were', 'actually', 'target', 'footage', 'other', 'concert', 'DVDs', 'such', 'Reel', 'Big', 'Fish', 'Korn', 'Something', 'Corporate', 'crisper', 'cleaner', 'watching', 'Coheed', 'rock', 'tremendously', 'awesome', 'However', 'filmed', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'picking', 'up', 'various', 'lighting', 'used', 'still', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'DVD.The', 'price', 'DVD', '20', 'DVD', 'CD', 'show', 'Awesome', 'Honestly', 'price', 'CD', 'alone', 'point', ""'m"", 'considering', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'disc', 'hearing', 'Coheed', 'live', 'iPod', 'car', 'so', 'intense', 'amazing', 'Keeping', 'Secrets', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'live', 'songs', 'ever', 'CD', 'flawlessly']",N/A
885016,A169YNE7TAQDUS,B0007OQ6OI,Nathan Unck,"[1, 3]","Okay, I have been following Coheed and Cambria since thier Shabuite years. I love this band. I listen to their albums at least once a day. I have been learning how to play some of their songs on my guitar. I have the comic book, signed by claudio himself. I was so excited to hear about this DVD. I was having a hard time waiting for it to come out, but finally, the wait is over and in a way, I wish that I was still waiting. THe sound doesn't do them justice at all. some of the shots are kinda cool because you can see just how amazing their talent really is, but that terrible sound that comes out. The sound recording is just bad. I will take a live show any day. If you can find the DVD at the library or borrow it from a friend, then do that. I love Coheed, but this DVD only makes them sound average. That review is also my answer to the bonus disc. I think I was just as excited for the extra disc for the concert on CD. But it all goes back to the sound. Bad sound. It just isn't enjoyable to listen to, which is what their music is all about.",2,Best band to come around in a while screws up DVD...,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,1053,"['Okay', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Coheed', 'Cambria', 'thier', 'Shabuite', 'years', 'love', 'band', 'listen', 'albums', 'least', 'once', 'day', 'have', 'been', 'learning', 'how', 'play', 'songs', 'guitar', 'have', 'comic', 'book', 'signed', 'claudio', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'hear', 'DVD', 'was', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'waiting', 'come', 'out', 'finally', 'wait', 'way', 'wish', 'was', 'still', 'waiting', 'THe', 'sound', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'shots', 'are', 'kinda', 'cool', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'amazing', 'talent', 'really', 'terrible', 'sound', 'out', 'sound', 'recording', 'just', 'bad', 'will', 'take', 'live', 'show', 'day', 'can', 'find', 'DVD', 'library', 'borrow', 'friend', 'then', 'do', 'love', 'Coheed', 'DVD', 'only', 'sound', 'average', 'review', 'also', 'answer', 'bonus', 'disc', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'excited', 'extra', 'disc', 'concert', 'CD', 'back', 'sound', 'Bad', 'sound', 'just', ""n't"", 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'what', 'music']",N/A
885017,A39W3263A9HCMN,B0007OQ6OI,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[0, 0]","I am a huge Coheed and Cambria fan and I was extremely excited to buy this when I saw it in the store.Now first, the concert. The concert, which despite being a bit short (Although the Alexisonfire concert last night was 65-70 minutes) at 58 minutes long (2 minutes being taken up by the credits) was good. The setlist was great! They perfomed The Crowing, my favorite Coheed song.However, the sound quality is HORRIBLE. It comes with a 2.0 Dolby Stereo track and a 5.1 Surround Sound track. I began watching it with 5.1 Surround and the audio was so scrambled, I could hardly tell what was going on!!!! And not only that, I could barely hear Claudio's voice. About halfway through IKSOSE3, I restarted it with Stereo and guess what? I COULD HEAR CLAUDIO'S VOICE!!!! wEwT!Stereo sounded much better, especially with Claudio's amazing rendition of ""The Light and the Glass"" at the end.The menus are lousy too. Even the cheesy looking menus on the DVD with the deluxe edition of No World For Tomorrow were cooler looking.The Extras are OK at best. THere's no rehersal footage, just some footage from performances at Skate 'N' Surf, which is a nice addition, but just with even worse sound quality. The back of the DVD states there's an interview with Claudio and Travis(?). Yeah, well if the all-of-a-minute-and-a-half of Claudio telling someone which songs he loves playing live is considered an ""interview"", then there ya go. The interview with the other members is f--king hilarious though, I was crying laughing so hard. They must be stoned or something. The videos are a nice edition, but they aren't anything we HAVEN'T seen before. But I did like ""The Making of the Blood Red Summer video"".Overall, this DVD is OK.",3,"Good, but a tad dissapointing...",1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,1719,"['am', 'huge', 'Coheed', 'Cambria', 'fan', 'was', 'extremely', 'excited', 'buy', 'when', 'saw', 'store.Now', 'first', 'concert', 'concert', 'being', 'bit', 'short', 'Alexisonfire', 'concert', 'last', 'night', 'was', '65-70', 'minutes', '58', 'minutes', 'long', '2', 'minutes', 'being', 'taken', 'up', 'credits', 'was', 'good', 'setlist', 'was', 'great', 'perfomed', 'Crowing', 'favorite', 'Coheed', 'song.However', 'sound', 'quality', 'HORRIBLE', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'track', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'track', 'began', 'watching', '5.1', 'Surround', 'audio', 'was', 'so', 'scrambled', 'could', 'hardly', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'not', 'only', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'Claudio', 'voice', 'halfway', 'IKSOSE3', 'restarted', 'Stereo', 'guess', 'what', 'COULD', 'HEAR', 'CLAUDIO', 'VOICE', 'wEwT', 'Stereo', 'sounded', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'Claudio', 'amazing', 'rendition', 'Light', 'Glass', 'end.The', 'menus', 'are', 'lousy', 'too', 'Even', 'cheesy', 'looking', 'menus', 'DVD', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'No', 'World', 'Tomorrow', 'were', 'cooler', 'looking.The', 'Extras', 'are', 'OK', 'best', 'rehersal', 'footage', 'just', 'footage', 'performances', 'Skate', 'N', 'Surf', 'nice', 'addition', 'just', 'even', 'worse', 'sound', 'quality', 'back', 'DVD', 'interview', 'Claudio', 'Travis', 'Yeah', 'well', 'all-of-a-minute-and-a-half', 'Claudio', 'telling', 'someone', 'playing', 'live', 'considered', 'interview', 'then', 'ya', 'go', 'interview', 'other', 'members', 'f', 'king', 'hilarious', 'was', 'crying', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'must', 'be', 'stoned', 'something', 'videos', 'are', 'nice', 'edition', 'are', ""n't"", 'anything', 'HAVE', ""N'T"", 'seen', 'before', 'did', 'Making', 'Blood', 'Red', 'Summer', 'video', '.Overall', 'DVD', 'OK']",N/A
