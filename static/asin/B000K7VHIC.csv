Richard Lewis and Jaime Lee Curtis fit surprisingly well into the sitcom format.Anyway, when ""Seinfeld"" came out a year or so after this, I watched a few episodes, didn't care much for it and, said to myself, and anyone else who would listen, ""poor Jerry Seinfeld, his show will never take off and be a hit, like Richard Lewis' show.""At the urging of some friends, I picked up on Seinfeld in their second season and the rest is history.Regardless of all that, I can't wait to watch these again.

1031544,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000K7VHIC,Cubist,"[8, 9]","The problem inherent in any television show that revolves around the sexual tension between its two romantic leads is how do you keep the audience interested after the thrill of the chase is gone? Once the anticipation of the potential couple hooking up has been removed, what do you put in its place? The early `90s sitcom Anything But Love tried to answer these questions in a smart and entertaining way with two very engaging leads - neurotic comedian Richard Lewis and sexy actress Jamie Lee Curtis. This much beloved sitcom finally gets its due on DVD with the first two seasons available in one volume.Richard Lewis gets to do his stand-up shtick and plays the neurotic guy to the hilt. Marty is jaded and cynical and this acts as a nice contrast to Hannah's peppy enthusiasm. She's just happy to be working in a job she truly loves. As she demonstrated with a film like A Fish Called Wanda, Curtis has a knack for comedy, displaying crackerjack timing with Lewis while also being adept at physical humour as well. The writing is top notch - sharp, crisp dialogue that snaps and pops with sarcastic one-liners courtesy of Lewis in contrast to Curtis' unflappable optimism. The writers hit the right beats on a consistent basis and the cast does a great job of delivering them.Watching Curtis and Lewis in Anything But Love is like going back in time. He sports the big hair look from the 1980s (that has not aged well) while Curtis adopts a mousy look that downplays her natural sexiness that she normally exudes. Thankfully, they would tweak her look in the second season. There is also undeniable chemistry between Curtis and Lewis that is constantly evident, like in a scene from the ""Deadline"" episode where they dance to a cheesy romantic song. You can see a genuine expression fun and enjoyment in their faces. They work well together and the appeal of this show is watching their characters flirt and eventually fall in love with each other.Disc one features an audio commentary on ""Fear of Flying"" by Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis. From the way they banter you can tell that they are still good friends and this only emphasizes the chemistry we see on-screen.Disc two features a commentary on ""Hotel of the Damned"" by director Robert Berlinger. He says that this was his very first episode of T.V. and points out his first mistake (a visible boom microphone in the first shot).The third disc has a retrospective featurette entitled, ""All About Anything But Love,"" with Curtis, Lewis, creator Wendy Kout and other key people back to reminisce about the show. In discussing its origins, footage from the unaired pilot is shown and it's interesting to see the original idea which was eventually rejected.""Stories from the Set"" features most of the participants from the previous extra telling more anecdotes about working on the show, including their impressions of cast and crew members and how everyone bonded like a big family.",5,Lots of love for this underrated show.,1172188800,"02 23, 2007",2007,2946,"['problem', 'inherent', 'television', 'show', 'sexual', 'tension', 'two', 'romantic', 'leads', 'how', 'do', 'keep', 'audience', 'interested', 'thrill', 'chase', 'gone', 'Once', 'anticipation', 'potential', 'couple', 'hooking', 'up', 'been', 'removed', 'what', 'do', 'put', 'place', 'early', '90s', 'sitcom', 'Anything', 'Love', 'tried', 'answer', 'questions', 'smart', 'entertaining', 'way', 'two', 'very', 'engaging', 'neurotic', 'comedian', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'sexy', 'actress', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'much', 'beloved', 'sitcom', 'finally', 'due', 'DVD', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'available', 'one', 'volume.Richard', 'Lewis', 'do', 'stand-up', 'shtick', 'neurotic', 'guy', 'hilt', 'Marty', 'jaded', 'cynical', 'nice', 'contrast', 'Hannah', 'peppy', 'enthusiasm', 'just', 'happy', 'be', 'working', 'job', 'truly', 'loves', 'demonstrated', 'film', 'Fish', 'Called', 'Wanda', 'Curtis', 'knack', 'comedy', 'displaying', 'crackerjack', 'timing', 'Lewis', 'also', 'being', 'adept', 'physical', 'humour', 'as', 'well', 'writing', 'top', 'notch', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'dialogue', 'snaps', 'pops', 'sarcastic', 'one-liners', 'courtesy', 'Lewis', 'contrast', 'Curtis', 'unflappable', 'optimism', 'writers', 'hit', 'right', 'beats', 'consistent', 'basis', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'delivering', 'them.Watching', 'Curtis', 'Lewis', 'Anything', 'Love', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'sports', 'big', 'hair', 'look', '1980s', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'Curtis', 'mousy', 'look', 'natural', 'sexiness', 'normally', 'Thankfully', 'would', 'tweak', 'look', 'second', 'season', 'also', 'undeniable', 'chemistry', 'Curtis', 'Lewis', 'constantly', 'evident', 'scene', 'Deadline', 'episode', 'where', 'dance', 'cheesy', 'romantic', 'song', 'can', 'see', 'genuine', 'expression', 'fun', 'enjoyment', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'appeal', 'show', 'watching', 'characters', 'flirt', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'other.Disc', 'one', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Fear', 'Flying', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'way', 'banter', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'friends', 'only', 'chemistry', 'see', 'on-screen.Disc', 'two', 'commentary', 'Hotel', 'Damned', 'director', 'Robert', 'Berlinger', 'was', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'T.V', 'out', 'first', 'mistake', 'visible', 'boom', 'microphone', 'first', 'shot', 'third', 'disc', 'retrospective', 'featurette', 'entitled', 'Anything', 'Love', 'Curtis', 'Lewis', 'creator', 'Wendy', 'Kout', 'other', 'key', 'people', 'back', 'reminisce', 'show', 'discussing', 'origins', 'footage', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'shown', 'interesting', 'see', 'original', 'idea', 'was', 'eventually', 'rejected', 'Stories', 'Set', 'most', 'participants', 'previous', 'extra', 'telling', 'more', 'anecdotes', 'working', 'show', 'including', 'impressions', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'how', 'everyone', 'bonded', 'big', 'family']","Anything But Love - Volume 1, Season 1 & 2"

1031548,A59EAODMJ673M,B000K7VHIC,John Gentile,"[13, 14]","Anything But Love was never a huge hit. It ran from 1989 to 1992.  The first season was only six episodes, and the final season was cancelled midway through. Why? Because network execs thought the show was not repeatable. No syndication value. Lifetime broadcast repeats briefly. So why is Anything But Love coming to DVD?  Someone at Fox must think it's a fine show.  And it is. The combination of a charming actress (Jamie Lee Curtis) and a very funny stand up comic (Richard Lewis) is perfect. Their chemistry drives this vehicle, and they are strongly supported by a wonderful group of actors.The setup is simple. These too people are attracted to each other but won't admit it because they work together. Love will not bloom until the third season, but the first two are still great.Lewis and Curtis do not hog the spotlight. They allow the other characters to shine. Ann Magnuson is a standout as the editor of the magazine, and Holly Fulger is very funny as Curtis' needy best friend.The dvds also include a documentary about the series, and commentary on the pilot with Curtis & Lewis.

1031551,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000K7VHIC,Phil S.,"[3, 3]","This Battle of the Sexes was more about the *internal* battle of two romantic souls just a bit over-cautious about ""letting it happen again"". Yes, all the ingredients are there for Love....but it's anything but. Or so they think.The first few shows have the proverbial growing pains of many successful sitcoms (conscious or unconscious ""borrowing"", here maybe from Mary Tyler Moore/Lou Grant/others) but right from the start Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis hit the mark, and that expected stiltedness, staginess, if you will, is not evident as it is in the early ventures of Seinfeld, for example.It's interesting that both shows went through major changes for the better: here ABL morphed from a sentimental young-woman-from-the-country takes-on-a-big-city-publisher to a non-stereotypical setting, with self-deprecating intellectuals working for a Boss who is anything but self-deprecating. Close to the time this series abrupted ended, JS showed up, and that show went from a show about a hip comedian and his quirky New York friends to the ""show about nothing"".Well, ABL did not become a show which dominated television, as it had a short run. The interviews and reflections in the special features suggest that a warm show involving nice people who cared about each other and the world they lived in just not might be what would soon be the norm for sitcoms.",4,"Kinder, gentler Battle of the Sexes",1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,1366,"['Battle', 'Sexes', 'was', 'more', '*internal*', 'battle', 'two', 'romantic', 'souls', 'just', 'bit', 'over-cautious', 'letting', 'happen', 'again', 'Yes', 'ingredients', 'are', 'there', 'Love', 'anything', 'so', 'think.The', 'first', 'few', 'shows', 'have', 'proverbial', 'growing', 'pains', 'many', 'successful', 'sitcoms', 'conscious', 'unconscious', 'borrowing', 'here', 'maybe', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore/Lou', 'Grant/others', 'right', 'start', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'Richard', 'Lewis', 'hit', 'mark', 'expected', 'stiltedness', 'staginess', 'will', 'not', 'evident', 'early', 'ventures', 'Seinfeld', 'example.It', 'interesting', 'shows', 'went', 'major', 'changes', 'better', 'here', 'ABL', 'morphed', 'sentimental', 'young-woman-from-the-country', 'takes-on-a-big-city-publisher', 'non-stereotypical', 'setting', 'self-deprecating', 'intellectuals', 'working', 'Boss', 'who', 'anything', 'self-deprecating', 'Close', 'time', 'series', 'abrupted', 'ended', 'JS', 'showed', 'up', 'show', 'went', 'show', 'hip', 'comedian', 'quirky', 'New', 'York', 'show', 'nothing', '.Well', 'ABL', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'show', 'dominated', 'television', 'had', 'short', 'run', 'interviews', 'reflections', 'special', 'features', 'suggest', 'warm', 'show', 'involving', 'nice', 'people', 'who', 'cared', 'other', 'world', 'lived', 'just', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'would', 'soon', 'be', 'norm', 'sitcoms']","Anything But Love - Volume 1, Season 1 & 2"

The VHS tapes were fair to poor quality as I had no cable TV and reception was lousy.  Still, I watched these tapes many times over the years.  I am thrilled to have good copies on DVD at last.  I've yet to watch every episode and the bonus materials.  I have watched about half of them.  I am disappointed in one episode as it appears on the DVD.  It's the one titled ""Breast of Friends"".  Marty has to appear on one of those 'Report' shows where panelists discuss issues of the day.  He tapes crib sheets to his chair because he freezes up in front of an audience.  He tells Hannah that he was in his high school production of ""Oklahoma"" and taped crib sheets to the set.  When he freezes 'on air' during the tv show, he starts singing ""Surrey with the Fringe on Top"" from Oklahoma.  This moment was edited out on the DVD.  The only reason I can think of is that they would have to pay royalties (the song was written by Rogers & Hammerstein).  The trouble is, the rest of the episode has great jokes relating to this moment.  Most of these jokes were also edited out.  A couple of related jokes remain but make no sense.  Too bad.
