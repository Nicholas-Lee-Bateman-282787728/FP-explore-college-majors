701943,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000067A8A,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 3]","I saw this back when it debuted on NBC and felt it was mediocre then. I recently watched it and had to downgrade my opinion. This movie is NOTHING original. I don't know if it's a true story or not but it's exactly like a million other TV movies out there and the acting isn't even that good.We have the same set up as a million other movies. Melissa (Candace Cameron, years before she was Bure) plays the shy, naive, virginal coed who goes to her first big frat party on campus (big surprise!) gets stinking drunk and is raped by jock Scott (Mark Paul Gosselaar). Turns out she completely misjudged him (gasp!) and she realizes that his sweet charms was just a way to get her into bed.The best parts of the movie was before the rape which is probably twenty minutes. After that it goes downhill fast. We have nothing different from all the other million date-rape TV movies. Not. One. Thing. At first she's ashamed to tell what happened then when she does no one believes her. Her brother who is a frat brother of Scott's doesn't even believe Melissa at first. She walks around like a zombie and even continues to talk to Scott after what he did. This has been done a million times! Nothing, nothing was different about this movie!The writing is horrible and the acting is unconvincing. Cameron gets on your nerves with her squealing and Mark is as dry as cardboard. None of the characters seemed realistic or three dimensional and seemed to be formed from cliche cutouts.I found it hard to have sympathy for Melissa. Rape is never the victim's fault but she made some very irresponsible decisions and I didn't like how the character was so stupid. She was so naive yet she gets dead drunk at her first campus party then lets Scott take her upstairs. It was hard to find sympathy. Also the rape scene was pathetic and like something out of a bad After School Special.The only reason someone should watch this is if they are fans of these two or are too lazy to turn the channel when the movie is playing. Otherwise skip it. There are tons of better TV movies that deal with date rape that feature better actors, more engaging characters and good writing. Skip it.This is bad even for a TV movie.",1,Nothing New or Entertaining,1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,2196,"['saw', 'back', 'when', 'debuted', 'NBC', 'felt', 'was', 'mediocre', 'then', 'recently', 'watched', 'had', 'downgrade', 'opinion', 'movie', 'NOTHING', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'true', 'story', 'not', 'exactly', 'million', 'other', 'TV', 'movies', 'there', 'acting', ""n't"", 'even', 'good.We', 'have', 'same', 'set', 'up', 'million', 'other', 'movies', 'Melissa', 'Candace', 'Cameron', 'years', 'was', 'Bure', 'shy', 'naive', 'virginal', 'coed', 'who', 'first', 'big', 'frat', 'party', 'campus', 'big', 'surprise', 'stinking', 'drunk', 'raped', 'jock', 'Scott', 'Mark', 'Paul', 'Gosselaar', 'out', 'completely', 'misjudged', 'gasp', 'sweet', 'charms', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'get', 'bed.The', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'was', 'rape', 'probably', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'downhill', 'fast', 'have', 'nothing', 'different', 'other', 'million', 'date-rape', 'TV', 'movies', 'Not', 'One', 'Thing', 'first', 'ashamed', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'when', 'one', 'brother', 'who', 'frat', 'brother', 'Scott', ""n't"", 'even', 'believe', 'Melissa', 'first', 'zombie', 'even', 'talk', 'Scott', 'what', 'did', 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'Nothing', 'nothing', 'was', 'different', 'movie', 'writing', 'horrible', 'acting', 'unconvincing', 'Cameron', 'nerves', 'squealing', 'Mark', 'as', 'dry', 'cardboard', 'None', 'characters', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'three', 'dimensional', 'seemed', 'be', 'formed', 'cliche', 'cutouts.I', 'found', 'hard', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Melissa', 'Rape', 'never', 'victim', 'fault', 'made', 'very', 'irresponsible', 'decisions', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'stupid', 'was', 'so', 'naive', 'yet', 'dead', 'drunk', 'first', 'campus', 'party', 'then', 'Scott', 'take', 'upstairs', 'was', 'hard', 'find', 'sympathy', 'Also', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'pathetic', 'something', 'bad', 'School', 'Special.The', 'only', 'reason', 'someone', 'should', 'watch', 'are', 'fans', 'two', 'are', 'too', 'lazy', 'turn', 'channel', 'when', 'movie', 'playing', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'tons', 'better', 'TV', 'movies', 'deal', 'date', 'rape', 'feature', 'better', 'actors', 'more', 'engaging', 'characters', 'good', 'writing', 'Skip', 'it.This', 'bad', 'even', 'TV', 'movie']",N/A
701944,A36283XJO4ODGM,B000067A8A,puff,"[15, 16]","This is one of the best made for tv films I've ever seen. I taped it 8 years ago and still watch it once in awhile.This film stars Candace Cameron, the wholesome, studious, pretty college freshman. She makes one mistake-she decides to drink at a frat party even though she is underage- and winds up getting drunk. A good looking, smooth talking older student played by Mark Paul Gossler takes her up to his room and tries to seduce her. She says No repeatedly and yet he forces her to have sex. She realizes immediately that she was raped and tries to tell others, but has a hard time getting them to believe her. She stands up for the truth and eventually the rapist gets some punishment, but not nearly enough in my opinion.This is a very well written and educational film that I think teen girls should definitely watch, preferably with their parents. I don't think anyone under 13 should see this, it is violent, although pretty tame considering the crime.It is also a wake up call to the parents of college students as well as university personnel about what really goes on at college parties.I sure hope amazon makes this available (soon!) on dvd or video for purchase.",5,awesome made for tv movie,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,1175,"['one', 'best', 'made', 'tv', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'taped', '8', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'watch', 'once', 'awhile.This', 'film', 'stars', 'Candace', 'Cameron', 'wholesome', 'studious', 'pretty', 'college', 'freshman', 'one', 'mistake-she', 'drink', 'frat', 'party', 'even', 'underage-', 'up', 'getting', 'drunk', 'good', 'looking', 'smooth', 'talking', 'older', 'student', 'played', 'Mark', 'Paul', 'Gossler', 'up', 'room', 'tries', 'seduce', 'repeatedly', 'yet', 'have', 'sex', 'immediately', 'was', 'raped', 'tries', 'tell', 'others', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'believe', 'up', 'truth', 'eventually', 'rapist', 'punishment', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'opinion.This', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'educational', 'film', 'think', 'teen', 'girls', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', 'preferably', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', '13', 'should', 'see', 'violent', 'pretty', 'tame', 'considering', 'crime.It', 'also', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'parents', 'college', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'university', 'personnel', 'what', 'really', 'college', 'parties.I', 'sure', 'hope', 'amazon', 'available', 'soon', 'dvd', 'video', 'purchase']",N/A
