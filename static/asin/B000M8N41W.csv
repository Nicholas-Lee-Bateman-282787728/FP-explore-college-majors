1044095,A31FF3A1RSPHCQ,B000M8N41W,"A. E. Prins-Stairs ""Spaction3""","[1, 3]","I have been waiting for this set for years,  and finally my prayers have been answered.  SatAM with many extras comes to DVD at last, I know DICs partnership with Shout Factory would help this, I was hoping it would be a good thing for this and thank god it was.  And best of all for me, MY ARTWORK IS GOING TO BE ON THE PACKAGING!  I left my mark on Mario but now I leave my mark on Sonic as well, I am part of DVD history.But to the point.  Sonic the Hedgehog is a series with more of a plot then the other series have mainly had.  It takes place on the planet Mobius with Sonic and his fellow freedom fighters Rotor, Antoine, Bunnie Rabbot, and Sally Acorn trying to stop the evil Dr. Robotnik who has taken over the planet.This would have had another season but Power Rangers got in the way and prevented it from happening.  But I promise you, this is one Sonic series that does not disappoint.  For any Sonic fan young and old, I would buy and enjoy this DVD set, it's one of the best Sonic shows ever made.Watching it now, it angers me more that it was cancelled.  This show is WAY above Sonic X, and the best of all DIC Sonic Series.I have check the special features, not bad, the Jaleel convo was nice as was the prototype opener (I like the finished opener better).  There are a few things I have not checked out just yet though so I can not comment them just yet.The best thing for me to see will be Season 2, I missed a lot of that but I saw low def versions online but they were edited, to finally have them uncut with the opener, credits and such will be is awesome.Another cool thing about this set is that the pilot episode is airing first instead of last in Season 1 for once.Looks like the perfect DVD set for any oldschool Sonic fan and a Must have for any Sonic fan.",5,"At last, it's HERE!",1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,1785,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'set', 'years', 'finally', 'prayers', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'SatAM', 'many', 'extras', 'DVD', 'last', 'know', 'DICs', 'partnership', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'would', 'help', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'thank', 'god', 'was', 'best', 'MY', 'ARTWORK', 'IS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'BE', 'ON', 'THE', 'PACKAGING', 'left', 'mark', 'Mario', 'now', 'leave', 'mark', 'Sonic', 'well', 'am', 'part', 'DVD', 'history.But', 'point', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'series', 'more', 'plot', 'then', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'mainly', 'had', 'place', 'planet', 'Mobius', 'Sonic', 'fellow', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'Rotor', 'Antoine', 'Bunnie', 'Rabbot', 'Sally', 'Acorn', 'trying', 'stop', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'planet.This', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'season', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'got', 'way', 'prevented', 'happening', 'promise', 'one', 'Sonic', 'series', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Sonic', 'fan', 'young', 'old', 'would', 'buy', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'Sonic', 'shows', 'ever', 'made.Watching', 'now', 'more', 'was', 'cancelled', 'show', 'WAY', 'Sonic', 'X', 'best', 'DIC', 'Sonic', 'Series.I', 'have', 'check', 'special', 'features', 'not', 'bad', 'Jaleel', 'convo', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'prototype', 'opener', 'like', 'finished', 'opener', 'better', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'have', 'not', 'checked', 'out', 'just', 'yet', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'just', 'yet.The', 'best', 'thing', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'Season', '2', 'missed', 'lot', 'saw', 'low', 'def', 'versions', 'online', 'were', 'edited', 'finally', 'have', 'uncut', 'opener', 'credits', 'such', 'will', 'be', 'awesome.Another', 'cool', 'thing', 'set', 'pilot', 'episode', 'airing', 'first', 'instead', 'last', 'Season', '1', 'once.Looks', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'set', 'oldschool', 'Sonic', 'fan', 'Must', 'have', 'Sonic', 'fan']",Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series
1044096,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B000M8N41W,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[2, 3]","It took me a long time to really figure out what I thought about the popularly-dubbed SatAM. I've arrived at one conclusion; I love it. I think it's a wonderful cartoon. It does have its shortcomings, but all in all I am very fond of it. This dark yet eternally shining, all-too-short cartoon remains one of my favourites to this day - even if I missed it the first time around.The disturbing plot sees the evil Dr Robotnik having taken over Mobius, particularly the capital city Mobotropolis, which he has turned into the robotic city Mobotropolis. Along with his assistant Snivelly, he has captured many citizens and - chillingly - turned them into robotic slaves (a process known as 'robotisizing'). Sonic and his motely fathering of friends have lost family members to this process, and unite under the name of the ""Freedom Fighters"". Operating from their secret base in Knothole Village, they work to overthrow Robotnik one step at a time, often with the help of other groups of Freedom Fighters around Mobius. This premise inspired the long-running Sonic comics, but contrary to popular belief it was SatAM who came first. The adventures of the FF span two series, distinctly different in plot and atmosphere, a planned third one infamously cancelled by people at ABC who didn't like the show. The second season was almost solely written by Pat Allee and Ben Hurst, and as such that season is the more consistent one.The characters are definitely one of the series's biggest strengths. Sonic, Tails and Robotnik are the only staple characters - Robotnik now very much uncanny, completely different from his video-game renders even today - but the rest are a likeable, colourful bunch. They are; Sally, a tenacious squirrel and Sonic's secret crush; Bunny Rabbot, a partly-roboticised rabbit with a delightful southern-U.S. accent; Antoine, a coyote who was once a member of the palace guard, his cowardice only outdone by his French-muddled English; and then my favourite, Rotor the walrus, an inventor who supplies the FF with all their gadgets (even if they are of varying use). Each character has a personality; Sally is the unofficial 'leader' (her super-computer Nicole an endless help to the FF), Rotor's awkward but always ready to help out his friends if just with a spot of advice, Antoine is desperate to prove his worth but his cowardice often renders this difficult, and then Bunny keeps them all together with her good nature.The animation itself is very good generally, and shows that the people making it did their homework. The voice acting is very good, too. Rotor's voice actor catches his personality very well, even though his voice took me some time to get used to, as I hear him speak in my head with a deeper voice than he does on the show. Bunny Rabbot's south-U.S. drawl is really heartwarming, and Antoine's arrogant but cowardly personality is perfectly captured by his voice actor (as well as his French accent). I have a love-hate relationship with Robotnik's voice, though, whose manner of speech consists mostly of evil whispers (which are chilling enough).As said, the show saw two seasons. The first season, sadly, doesn't take the plot forward an inch. Its plots have little to do with the subject at hand; they range everything from races against robots to underground reservoirs that Robotnik has polluted. There are a few when the plot is vital, however, such as when Sonic and company try to rescue his robotisized uncle Chuck. But even though Robotnik is present for the majority of the season, the plot doesn't progress an inch. The second season is definitely the more concrete one; the Freedom Fighters' fight with Robotnik begins to make some progress, Sonic and co. meet with other groups of Freedom Fighters, e.g. the ram Ari and the wolf Lupe; the events that led to Robotnik's takeover are touched upon, and a final battle with Robotnik ensues.There is one main flaw with the series, however, particularly during the second season; it tends to forget the significance of its supporting cast - we rarely see Bunny and especially Rotor in Season 2. Sally takes up way too much spotlight; one might almost go as far as dub the show 'The Sally Show'; meanwhile Rotor's gadget genius and Bunny Rabbot's martial arts skills are all but overlooked for the majority of the second season, which is a real shame. To make matters worse, ABC just couldn't lay off the show's crew, ordering them to introduce a new character for season 2 for the female audience to identify with... I ask you, in what way are Sally and Bunny NOT characters for the female audience to identify with?! The result is Dulcy the dragon, another character we see take far too much spotlight (and her ongoing crash jokes lose their zeal very quickly). To cap it off, I don't like Tails in this cartoon AT ALL - rather than Sonic's tenacious sidekick, he's a helpless little kid who has to be taught everything and sometimes even tucked in at night.Yet in spite of this, the series does come out glowing. The story works out in a very nice way and retains its charm. The series could've been stronger had it been more faithful to its supporting cast - I have a hard time forgiving how Rotor's even left out of the final roar of celebration! And I who like him even more in the second season. On the whole, however, that's only enough to knock out one star. This is a cartoon deserving of its reputation, and this beautiful and informative set is a must have for all those who, like me, have been touched by the adventures of Sonic, Rotor and co.",4,"A Real

I loved Sonic, but I was rarely up early enough to catch these shows when they were on originally, so I'm especially grateful to see them all in a single DVD package now.Sonic fans probably already know the premise behind these shows: Sonic and the Freedom Fighters are in a continuous guerrilla war with Julian Ivo Kintobor, or ""Robotnik,"" and his myriad robotic minions. Robotnik is able to augment his armies by ""roboticizing"" innocent Mobians (the anthropomorphic animals, like Sonic and his friends, that are the chief citizens of planet Mobius). Overall, the story is a dark saga of resistance that may seem somewhat trite (due to the similarities with ""The Matrix"" and the untold dozens of fictional worlds based upon similar premises), but it's still a good story. Fans of the Archie Sonic comics will easily find themselves at home with these cartoons, as they're essentially the same story and characters.If you were a fan of the shows to begin with, don't hesitate--get these as soon as you can.

Maybe it's because of the great cast of characters, including Jaleel White from ""Family Matters"" in the role of Sonic, and the wonderfully versatile Jim Cummings as the villain, Doctor Robotnik (known today as Dr. Eggman).  Maybe it's because the show relies on the original characters from the comic books, and not some of the more recent characters from the newer games.  It could be because of the dry wit and numerous puns that add humor to it.  Perhaps it's because of the powerful underlying themes of freedom, justice, and friendship that give the story so much depth.Whatever the reason, this is still the most enduring series in the Sonic franchise.

1044108,A2W6SI073FIRMA,B000M8N41W,KlownArt,"[2, 3]","Sonic the Hedgehog- The Complete SeriesThis is a 4-Disk DVD Set is for the original Sonic the Hedgehog Cartoon. Many people loved it in 1993 and 1994 when it was playing with Fox's Saturday Morning Line-up, along with the phenomenon known as the Power Rangers. The show was not given the respect it deserved and was often taken off the air so Fox could show Saturday morning sports. So, as a viewer you would not always get to see Sonic on Saturday. The Power Rangers would always be on...but that's a juggernaut that Fox felt safe with. Sonic ran two seasons, each of them being 13 episodes. The second season ended with a huge cliffhanger that I won't spoil, but Fox still cancelled the show.Before I go on into the content, I'd like to say that I never watched this show as a kid. I thought this was a different Sonic, and ended up picking this up by mistake. So, I am a fanboy in no way at all. So, if you are someone who's never watched this series before, my review will most likely be a good view of things for you.This cartoon was made before characters like Knuckles, Amy, and all those other Sonic characters were even made. The only ones in this series you'll probably know are Dr. Robotnik (Dr. Eggman), Sonic, and Tails. Sonic's homeland has been taken over by the maniacal tyrant Dr. Robotnik. He has a machine called the Robotizer that turns people into his robot slaves. He has also overrun the world with pollution. All of the world except the Great Forest and it's secret hideout for the Freedom Fighters, Knothole. I don't want to spoil too much about how it happened as it does that in an episode. Sonic and the Freedom Fighters are trying to stop Dr. Robotnik whatever way they can. The cartoon is really dark considering it's a Sonic cartoon.The first two disks contain Season 1. Season 1 doesn't really stay on a strict storyline at all. They pretty much show random events that happen during the lives of the Freedom Fighters as they fight against Dr. Robotnik. Nothing really special except a few stand out episodes that don't consist of ""Let's do this to Robotnik, one of us gets caught, Sonic saves us"".Disks 3 and 4 are amazing though. They contain Season 2, which was a truly touching season. It followed a storyline Project Doomsday. Robotnik was preparing something really evil and Sonic was trying to figure out what to do most of the season. For part of the season he is helping his robot uncle turn back into a human. In the series of two episodes, Sonic and Sally, his almost-girlfriend, go back in time and it is revealed what happened to the world. It's truly a great story with a really great final episode. It would've been great if they would've continued on with the series.The Bonus features consist of storyboards, concept art, and deleted sequences. I'm not one of those people who like seeing the drawings, but luckily there were also two interviews that were really intriguing. There is one with Jaleel White (Family Matters), who did the voice of Sonic. Another is with Ben Hurst, who was a writer on the series. Both are really interesting and pretty long.I can't give this 5 stars, mainly due to the first Season not being as interesting. I still suggest that any fan or non-fan pick this up and watch it. Also, whoever says the box art is bad is out of their mind. It's created out of Fan Art. It's not all the best, but the way it is put together like a collage is very cool looking.",4,"Season 1 is iffy, Season 2 is Amazing",1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,3434,"['Sonic', 'Hedgehog-', 'Complete', 'SeriesThis', '4-Disk', 'DVD', 'Set', 'original', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'Cartoon', 'Many', 'people', 'loved', '1993', '1994', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'Fox', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Line-up', 'phenomenon', 'known', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'respect', 'deserved', 'was', 'often', 'taken', 'off', 'air', 'so', 'Fox', 'could', 'show', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'sports', 'So', 'viewer', 'would', 'not', 'always', 'get', 'see', 'Sonic', 'Saturday', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'would', 'always', 'be', 'juggernaut', 'Fox', 'felt', 'safe', 'Sonic', 'ran', 'two', 'seasons', 'being', '13', 'episodes', 'second', 'season', 'ended', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'Fox', 'still', 'cancelled', 'show.Before', 'go', 'content', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'kid', 'thought', 'was', 'different', 'Sonic', 'ended', 'up', 'picking', 'up', 'mistake', 'So', 'am', 'fanboy', 'way', 'So', 'are', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'review', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'good', 'view', 'things', 'you.This', 'cartoon', 'was', 'made', 'characters', 'Knuckles', 'Amy', 'other', 'Sonic', 'characters', 'were', 'even', 'made', 'only', 'ones', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'know', 'are', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'Dr.', 'Eggman', 'Sonic', 'Tails', 'Sonic', 'homeland', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'maniacal', 'tyrant', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'machine', 'called', 'Robotizer', 'people', 'robot', 'slaves', 'also', 'overrun', 'world', 'pollution', 'world', 'Great', 'Forest', 'secret', 'hideout', 'Freedom', 'Fighters', 'Knothole', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'happened', 'episode', 'Sonic', 'Freedom', 'Fighters', 'are', 'trying', 'stop', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'way', 'can', 'cartoon', 'really', 'dark', 'considering', 'Sonic', 'cartoon.The', 'first', 'two', 'disks', 'contain', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '1', ""n't"", 'really', 'stay', 'strict', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'much', 'show', 'random', 'events', 'happen', 'lives', 'Freedom', 'Fighters', 'fight', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'Nothing', 'really', 'special', 'few', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'consist', 'Let', 'do', 'Robotnik', 'one', 'caught', 'Sonic', '3', '4', 'are', 'amazing', 'contain', 'Season', '2', 'was', 'truly', 'touching', 'season', 'followed', 'storyline', 'Project', 'Doomsday', 'Robotnik', 'was', 'preparing', 'something', 'really', 'evil', 'Sonic', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'most', 'season', 'part', 'season', 'helping', 'robot', 'uncle', 'turn', 'back', 'human', 'series', 'two', 'episodes', 'Sonic', 'Sally', 'almost-girlfriend', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'revealed', 'what', 'happened', 'world', 'truly', 'great', 'story', 'really', 'great', 'final', 'episode', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'would', ""'ve"", 'continued', 'series.The', 'Bonus', 'consist', 'storyboards', 'concept', 'art', 'deleted', 'sequences', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'seeing', 'drawings', 'luckily', 'were', 'also', 'two', 'interviews', 'were', 'really', 'intriguing', 'one', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'Family', 'Matters', 'who', 'did', 'voice', 'Sonic', 'Ben', 'Hurst', 'who', 'was', 'writer', 'series', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'pretty', 'long.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'mainly', 'due', 'first', 'Season', 'not', 'being', 'interesting', 'still', 'suggest', 'fan', 'non-fan', 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'Also', 'whoever', 'box', 'art', 'bad', 'mind', 'created', 'Fan', 'Art', 'not', 'best', 'way', 'put', 'together', 'collage', 'very', 'cool', 'looking']",Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series

Video game cartoons of the time generally had choppy animation, bad music, and stock gags (The Mario Bros. Super Show, Captain N, and Legend of Zelda, for example). However this show goes above an beyond expectations, and holds its own apart from the games.There are hints of the games' plot in this show, with animals trapped inside robots and super-fast Sonic having to free them, but it's been greatly expanded. Sonic's nemesis Dr. Robotnik has taken over the world and turned much of the population into robotic slaves. Sonic and his friends form a ragtag resistance in the forest, aiming to sabotage Robotnik at every turn and undo his damage. It sounds heavy at first, but it's actually well-handled, never being overly-preachy and breaking up some of the moodier situations with character gags. Generally episodes stand on their own, but particularly in the second season, there are some continuing plot threads.The newly-introduced characters are well-handled, and help to balance Sonic's more ""extreme"" personality. The main new character is Sally, the cool-headed resistance leader. She and Sonic have a mutual ""thing"", but she still can't stand the more boorish, reckless part of his personality. Also introduced are Snively, Robotnik's long-suffering assistant, and the rest of Sonic's freedom fighters. While some are a little annoying, all are generally likable, and make it easy to get into the show.The show is wrapped up nicely in the end, but teases episodes that unfortunately were never to be made (its failure to compete with Power Rangers cut it short of a third season). Still, while it lasted, Sonic the Hedgehog ran with the shallow plot of a '90s sidescroller and really made it worth watching.The DVD itself is also well done, including storyboards, writer interviews, and production designs typical of Shout Factory's releases, really giving the set some value.",5,Runs with a shallow premise without getting exhausted,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,2093,"['familiar', 'current', 'Sonic', 'games', 'characters', 'Knuckles', 'Shadow', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'vastly', 'different', 'series', 'produced', 'early', ""'90s"", 'height', 'Sonic', 'popularity', 'Video', 'game', 'cartoons', 'time', 'generally', 'had', 'choppy', 'animation', 'bad', 'music', 'stock', 'gags', 'Mario', 'Bros.', 'Super', 'Show', 'Captain', 'N', 'Legend', 'Zelda', 'example', 'However', 'show', 'expectations', 'own', 'apart', 'games.There', 'are', 'hints', 'games', 'plot', 'show', 'animals', 'trapped', 'robots', 'super-fast', 'Sonic', 'having', 'free', 'been', 'greatly', 'expanded', 'Sonic', 'nemesis', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'taken', 'world', 'turned', 'much', 'population', 'robotic', 'slaves', 'Sonic', 'friends', 'form', 'ragtag', 'resistance', 'forest', 'aiming', 'sabotage', 'Robotnik', 'turn', 'undo', 'damage', 'heavy', 'first', 'actually', 'well-handled', 'never', 'being', 'overly-preachy', 'breaking', 'up', 'moodier', 'situations', 'character', 'gags', 'Generally', 'stand', 'own', 'particularly', 'second', 'season', 'are', 'continuing', 'plot', 'threads.The', 'newly-introduced', 'characters', 'are', 'well-handled', 'help', 'balance', 'Sonic', 'more', 'extreme', 'personality', 'main', 'new', 'character', 'Sally', 'cool-headed', 'resistance', 'leader', 'Sonic', 'have', 'mutual', 'thing', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'more', 'boorish', 'reckless', 'part', 'personality', 'Also', 'introduced', 'are', 'Snively', 'Robotnik', 'long-suffering', 'assistant', 'rest', 'Sonic', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'are', 'little', 'annoying', 'are', 'generally', 'likable', 'make', 'easy', 'get', 'show.The', 'show', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'end', 'episodes', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'never', 'be', 'made', 'failure', 'compete', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'cut', 'short', 'third', 'season', 'Still', 'lasted', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'ran', 'shallow', 'plot', ""'90s"", 'sidescroller', 'really', 'made', 'watching.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'including', 'storyboards', 'writer', 'interviews', 'production', 'designs', 'typical', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'releases', 'really', 'giving', 'set', 'value']",Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series

The series is produced by DIC Entertainment and partnered with Sega of America. Another Sonic show -Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog- began airing around the same time as this series. Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog is more of a kid friendly-light hearted show, while this series has a more dark-complex plot. Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be based off of the video games, but I find it more to be based off of the comics. I admit, when I first watched the show (I was about 5. I'm 22 now), I thought it was a bit scary. But as I got older, I grew to love it.Boxart/packaging: This set comes in a nice thinpak Set with 2 DVDs cases. Each DVD case has 1 disc on each side totalling 4 DVD discs. 95% of the boxart was drawn by the fans. Some of the fanart closely resembles art from the show. The only artwork that isn't fanart is on the cover and on the spins. This set truly was made for the fans.Video Transer: From the beginning of the first episode, I could still see lots grainy spots flickering everywhere. So far, I only noticed it in the first episode. The sound quality is excellent you don't have to turn your volume up too high to hear it. Most of the video seems to be restored and remastered. The colors are bright and colorful.Features: Every episode has its opening and closing themes. Episodes are played in the original airdate order. The show is presented in it's original full frame (1:33:1) aspect ratio. This DVD set even includes the pilot episode (Heads or Tails) that aired on September 18th 1993. Audio and subtitles are only in English.Overall: I just got this set in the mail today and I'm very happy I purchased it. Even if you didn't watch this back in the 90's, I still recommend this to all Sonic fans. Though I would only recommend this show for kids 8 and older. If you want a more kid friendly show, go for Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog (another one of my favorite Sonic shows).Episode List;Disc 1:Heads or Tails (Pilot Episode)Sonic BoomSonic & SallyUltra SonicSonic & The Secret ScrollsSuper SonicSonic RacerDisc 2:Harmonic SonicHooked On SonicsSonic's NightmareWarp SonicSub-SonicSonic Past CoolDisc 3:Game GuySonic ConversionNo BrainerBlast To the Past (Part 1)Blast To the Past (Part 2)Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted DulcyDisc 4:The VoidThe Odd Couple/Ro-BeccaCry Of the WolfDrood HengeSpyhogThe Doomsday Project [END]",5,This DVD Set is Way Past Cool! :),1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2473,"['most', 'know', 'series', 'became', 'known', 'Sonic', 'SATAM', 'aired', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'ABC', 'series', 'produced', 'DIC', 'Entertainment', 'partnered', 'Sega', 'America', 'Sonic', 'show', '-Adventures', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog-', 'began', 'airing', 'same', 'time', 'series', 'Adventures', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'more', 'kid', 'friendly-light', 'hearted', 'show', 'series', 'more', 'dark-complex', 'plot', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'find', 'more', 'be', 'based', 'comics', 'admit', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'show', 'was', 'about', '5', ""'m"", '22', 'now', 'thought', 'was', 'bit', 'scary', 'got', 'older', 'grew', 'love', 'it.Boxart/packaging', 'set', 'nice', 'thinpak', 'Set', '2', 'DVDs', 'cases', 'DVD', 'case', '1', 'disc', 'side', 'totalling', '4', 'DVD', 'discs', '95', '%', 'boxart', 'was', 'drawn', 'fans', 'fanart', 'closely', 'art', 'show', 'only', 'artwork', ""n't"", 'fanart', 'cover', 'spins', 'set', 'truly', 'was', 'made', 'fans.Video', 'Transer', 'beginning', 'first', 'episode', 'could', 'still', 'see', 'lots', 'grainy', 'spots', 'flickering', 'everywhere', 'So', 'far', 'only', 'noticed', 'first', 'episode', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'turn', 'volume', 'up', 'too', 'high', 'hear', 'Most', 'video', 'be', 'restored', 'remastered', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'colorful.Features', 'episode', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'Episodes', 'are', 'played', 'original', 'airdate', 'order', 'show', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'frame', '1:33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'DVD', 'set', 'even', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Heads', 'Tails', 'aired', 'September', '18th', '1993', 'Audio', 'subtitles', 'are', 'only', 'English.Overall', 'just', 'got', 'set', 'mail', 'today', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'purchased', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'back', '90', 'still', 'recommend', 'Sonic', 'fans', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'show', 'kids', '8', 'older', 'want', 'more', 'kid', 'friendly', 'show', 'go', 'Adventures', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'one', 'favorite', 'Sonic', 'shows', '.Episode', 'List', 'Disc', '1', 'Heads', 'Tails', 'Pilot', 'Episode', 'Sonic', 'BoomSonic', 'SallyUltra', 'SonicSonic', 'Secret', 'ScrollsSuper', 'SonicSonic', 'RacerDisc', '2', 'Harmonic', 'SonicHooked', 'SonicsSonic', 'NightmareWarp', 'SonicSub-SonicSonic', 'Past', 'CoolDisc', '3', 'Game', 'GuySonic', 'ConversionNo', 'BrainerBlast', 'Past', 'Part', '1', 'Blast', 'Past', 'Part', '2', 'Fed', 'Up', 'Antoine/Ghost', 'Busted', 'DulcyDisc', '4', 'VoidThe', 'Odd', 'Couple/Ro-BeccaCry', 'WolfDrood', 'HengeSpyhogThe', 'Doomsday', 'Project', '[', 'END', ']']",Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series

1044119,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B000M8N41W,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","Sonic has always been my favorite videogame character, partially because he has the best life outside of videogames.  I loved the Adventures of Sonic cartoon first, because I was little & the silliness appealed to me.  But that quickly changed when I saw this show one Saturday morning.  I mean, I was confused at first because it was so different, but by the end of the opening I was into it.  When I finished watching Sonic's Nightmare, I realized this was the most awesome Sonic cartoon ever.  The new characters were a little weird to me at first, but they really grew on me.  And even back then I could have told you the animation looked better.  When I discovered the comics based on the show, I was even happier.  My first issue was the Mecha Madness special, which incidentally is when the series got really good.  Before then, the first 20 something issues were basically the serious characters in rejected plots from the funny show, which were terrible for the most part.  But around issue 25 or so, it got good & while it still had some silly main stories, there were always good back-up stories.  The comic continues to this day, & every month for the past 10 years I go to my local comic store & get the latest Sonic.  I have everything after 100, & a lot of the good issues that came before, but not all (incidentally, it's incredibly hard to find back issues for that time).  I think it says something that I had all the VHS tapes for the goofy show, but only 1 for this one (the one with Sonic Racer & Sonic Boom).  I got rid of all my AoStH tapes later, but kept the good one until my VCR chewed it up.  I got this DVD the day it came out, & have watched it over & over since then.  This show always rocks.  Even though it's darker than the other one, there's still some funny moments, thanks to good comic relief characters like Antoine & Snively.  By the way, the package design is one the best I've ever seen for a DVD set.  The use of fan art is just a wonderful touch, although the covers for the discs should have been switched.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.1.  Heads or Tails:  Princess Sally sends Sonic to Robotropolis in search of materials to build a defense against an impending invasion by Robotnik.  She doesn't know that the inexperienced Tails is tagging along...  This is like a plot from the early comics, & that's not a good thing.  C2.  Sonic Boom:  Princess Sally follows up on a lead that suggests that her father, King Maximillian, may be alive.  This is the real pilot, & it is an excellent first episode.  It's actually one of the greatest single part first episodes I've ever seen of any show.  Of the 6 episodes released on 3 VHS tapes, this one was always my favorite.  I mean this is the episode I would recommend the most to first time viewers.  A+3.  Sonic & Sally:  When the Princess is captured, Robotnik creates a robotic duplicate of her as a means of spying on and sabotaging the Freedom Fighters.  When Tails suspects something is wrong, will Sonic believe him?  My other favorite of the episodes I watched on VHS.  It's easy to see why the writers for this one got to write all of season 2.  A+4.  Ultra Sonic:  Sonic finds his long lost uncle, Sir Charles, after a failed mission in Robotropolis, kicking off an emotional roller coaster ride for him.  Seeing this episode on TV was one of the most vivid memories I have of any show I watched as a kid.  A+5.  Sonic & the Secret Scrolls:  The Freedom Fighters embark on an outlandish mission: to find magical scrolls which may hold the key to unlimited power.  A great adventurous episode.  A6.  Super Sonic:  Robotnik searches for a computer archive of spells belonging to an ancient evil wizard. Sonic heads to Robotropolis to get the crystal before Robotnik can use it.  But soon he is stripped of his legendary speed: can he get to the crystal in time?  This is a great focus on Sonic.  A7.  Sonic Racer:  Robotnik holds a race in Robotropolis in a bid to lure Sonic into a trap. The other Freedom Fighters take advantage of Robotnik's fixation on the race in hopes of destroying the city's power generator.  Another old favorite of mine.  The plot's great, & it has some hilarious moments.  A+8.  Harmonic Sonic:  Robotnik launches a spy satellite in an effort to locate Knothole Village, the Freedom Fighters' hidden base. Sonic and Rotor head towards the satellite using a makeshift rocket to destroy it.  Not the best, but not bad.  B+9.  Hooked on Sonics:  Antoine goes after Robotnik himself in an insane bid to impress Sally and earn personal glory.  Will he get out alive?  A great focus on Antoine.  A10.  Sonic's Nightmare:  Sonic is paralysed by a recurring nightmare personifying his own personal fears; meanwhile, Robotnik unleashes a machine that can literally destroy the world.  The first episode I ever saw, & it's one of the best.  A+11.  Warp Sonic:  The Freedom Fighters find themselves defending an underground city of Mobian refugees... all the while coming to terms with their own personal relationships.  A pretty good episode.  B12.  Sub-Sonic:  The Freedom Fighters home, the Great Forest, is dying. In search of magical water that causes plants to grow at an accelerated speed, the Freedom Fighters journey underground.  The better of the 2 episodes to focus on Rotor.  A+13.  Sonic Past Cool:  Robotnik has set his greedy eyes on the last living herd of a dinosaur-like species.  The Freedom Fighters help the creatures navigate through the Great Jungle while fighting off the advances of Robotnik's machines.  My second least favorite episode of the season, but it's not bad.  B14.  Game Guy:  Sonic and Sally befriend an ally who claims to be part of another Freedom Fighter group, but he is not what he seems to be.  An excellent start to the second season.  A+15.  Sonic Conversion:  Knothole's De-roboticizer is a success! Bunnie Rabbot and Uncle Chuck are back to their normal selves! But is the Freedom Fighters' latest accomplishment too good to be true?  Another excellent episode, marred only by a breaking of the fourth wall at the end.  A16.  No Brainer:  When Sonic loses his memory by a device Robotnik invented, Snively takes advantage and gets the hedgehog to infiltrate Knothole.  Can the Freedom Fighters return Sonic's memory to him before he betrays them?  By far the best use of the amnesia plot in an action cartoon, since it's done on purpose & makes for a very good weapon.  A-17-18.  Blast From the Past:  The war with Robotnik goes badly.  The only hope may lie in a pair of magical Time Stones: using them Sonic and Sally could travel to Mobotropolis Kingdom's past, prior to Robotnik's takeover and stop the fight before it begins!  The only 2-part story this show did is one of its best.  A+19a.  Fed Up with Antoine: Antoine is appointed king of a biker gang, unaware of their ""cannibalistic"" tradition.  The first of the comedic half-episodes, & it's actually pretty funny.  B+19b.  Ghost Busted:  Sonic and Tails investigate a possible ghost problem while camping out.  My least favorite of the comdic episodes, but it's not bad.  B20.  Dulcy:  Dulcy is summoned to a dragon mating ground as Robotnik seeks to roboticize the remainder of her species.  I love Dulcy, so it was great that she got an episode to call her own.  A21.  The Void:  When Sally and Bunnie disappear, Sonic and Nicole rush in to rescue them, entering the Void.  But getting into the Void, is much easier than getting out.  My least favorite of the 5 Doomsday Project episodes, but it's still above average.  A-22a.  The Odd Couple:  Antoine is forced to share his house with Sonic after a failed landing from Dulcy destroys the hedgehog's home.  My favorite of the comedy episodes.  It makes me laugh quite a lot.  A22b.  Ro-Becca:  Antoine accidentally activates a robot Rotor was working on. The robot suddenly develops a crush on him.  My second favorite comedy episode.  I honestly do get some real laughs out of this one.  A-23.  Cry of the Wolf:  Sonic and company finally make contact with another Royal Freedom Fighter group. They must work together when a nearly indestructible war-machine arrives to attack.  The Wolf Pack has some of the best characters in all of Sonic.  A+24.  Drood Henge:  Sonic and Tails team up in order to thwart Robotnik's scheme to possess the magical Deep Power Stones.  Another great episode.  A25.  Spy Hog:  Uncle Chuck finds himself increasingly at risk operating as a spy in Robotropolis.  A really good penultimate episode.  A+26.  The Doomsday Projecy:  Robotnik's Doomsday Project begins a week early than anyone had anticipated.  With all of Mobius in danger, the Freedom Fighters prepare for what may be their final battle.  The best episode of the whole series.  A+It's a shame this show was cancelled so soon.  It would have been awesome!  But, with a little editing here & there, it's not hard to imagine the story continuing in the comics.  But I would still love to see a continuation with the original voice actors (as long as they don't rename Robotnik Eggman).  I mean, the Biker Mice From Mars got a sequel series recently with the original voice actors.  That was a great show & was glad to see it return, but I would like to see Sonic & SWAT Kats return even more.  I recommend this to all Sonic Fans.",5,My favorite videogame character in my favorite videogame cartoon.,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,9337,"['Sonic', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'videogame',

Today though, I've heard the story enough to know what happened.  SatAM originally competed with the power rangers, and one show won, and the other (SatAM) was canceled.SatAM is THE Sonic show that didn't talk down to its audience.  The longtime villain of the games, Doctor Robotnik, has basically won in his bid for world conquest: he already rules the world when you start watching, and Sonic the Hedgehog with his band of freedom fighters now fight against the tyrant to take back their home world.  The story and plot is very nicely summed up in the memorable opening title sequence, complete with catchy theme song.Unlike the more well-known Sonic cartoon (which just tries to come off as goofy) or Sonic Underground (which has Sonic moon-lighting in a family rock band), this is a much darker, action oriented show, with a serious setting.  Sonic is essentially fighting a war using guerrilla tactics while maintaining his 90's era ""way-past-cool"" attitude.  The enemy, Doctor Robotnik, literally traps any animals that inhabit Sonic's world, and turns them into his robot slaves, stripping them of their free-will and identity.  In addition, he lives in a very polluted machine city, while Sonic and friends fight from their secret hideout within a nearby forest, giving the show an ecological message)  In a way, this makes the show the closest yet to the games... but the similarities stop there.To start, the story and characters are lifted straight out of (but not part of) the Sonic comics published by Archie, with the viewer left to familiarize themselves with a brand new cast of side characters (including Robotnik's nephew, Snively, Sonic's uncle Chuck, and the dethroned Princess Sally) as they watch... which isn't hard, but the complete lack of recognizability from the get-go may turn some off.  And while power rings make an appearance, Chaos Emeralds and Super Sonic (and Knuckles... he's in Sonic Underground) do not.There's also the matter of the ending: thankfully, we are lucky to have some sort of a proper ending for a canceled television cartoon, but it also ends on a very obvious cliff hanger, indicating that there were many plans for the show that we never got to see to fruition.SatAM was no doubt a great television show, but today it may take the right kind of person to see the value in it.  If you're a fan of the comics already (and have perhaps been reading the ""Sonic Archives"" series of graphic novel reprints), but haven't seen it, you'll probably find it very enjoyable.  Anyone who enjoys collecting these old cartoon shows would also probably be able to see the show for how good it really is.

You will also see where Sonic gets his power rings, you will also see some of his friends that weren't mentioned in Sonic X, and you will see why Sonic doesn't like Amy(because he already has a girlfriend).I like this series also because it has so many well known voice actors. Of course we should all know that Sonic was voiced by Jaleel White whom we all know as Steve Urkel from Family Matters. Tails was voiced by Bradley Pierce who also played as Peter on Jumanji. Princess Sally was voiced by Kath Souice who also voiced Lolla Bunnie on Space Jam. Dr. Robotnik was voiced by Jim Cummings who played on many movies but my favorite role he did was of Steel on the movie Balto.I hope your ready for this because I have to say too that this is the best Sonic the Hedgehog series EVER!!!",5,Are You Ready For This!!!,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,943,"['are', 'Sonic', 'X', 'fan', 'then', 'will', 'definatly', 'love', 'series.In', 'show', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'Sonic', 'friends', 'did', 'way', 'went', 'Earth', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'where', 'Sonic', 'power', 'rings', 'will', 'also', 'see', 'friends', 'were', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'Sonic', 'X', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'Sonic', ""n't"", 'like', 'Amy', 'already', 'girlfriend', 'series', 'also', 'so', 'many', 'well', 'known', 'voice', 'actors', 'course', 'should', 'know', 'Sonic', 'was', 'voiced', 'Jaleel', 'White', 'whom', 'know', 'Steve', 'Urkel', 'Family', 'Matters', 'Tails', 'was', 'voiced', 'Bradley', 'Pierce', 'who', 'also', 'played', 'Peter', 'Jumanji', 'Princess', 'Sally', 'was', 'voiced', 'Kath', 'Souice', 'who', 'also', 'voiced', 'Lolla', 'Bunnie', 'Space', 'Jam', 'Dr.', 'Robotnik', 'was', 'voiced', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'who', 'played', 'many', 'movies', 'favorite', 'role', 'did', 'was', 'Steel', 'movie', 'Balto.I', 'hope', 'ready', 'have', 'say', 'too', 'best', 'Sonic', 'Hedgehog', 'series', 'EVER']",Sonic The Hedgehog - The Complete Series
