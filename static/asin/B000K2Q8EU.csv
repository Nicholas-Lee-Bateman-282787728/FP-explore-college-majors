Since I purchased the discs and have watched a couple of more times I must say I am happy with the pace and camera work.  It is interesting to see so much and there are times when the camera pans out and you see the whole stage.  There are times when you see medium shots with all of Miss(Mrs.) Mutter ( not just nostrils and what have you ).I enjoy seeing so much of the Stradivarius up close.  This is about as close as I will ever get to such a breathtaking violin ( a close up shot on video ).Complain, complain, complain . . . just enjoy the different and better (?) (!) video experience that is available on these DVDs.The person who says Anne-Sophie Mutter is cold and unfriendly must be speaking of some other experience than this performance.  From what I see in these and other performances she seems genuinely friendly and appreciative of her fellow musicians and interacts with them with warmth.  True she looks intense at times but she IS NOT PLAYING AROUND ! THIS IS WORLD CLASS MOZART and she is giving it her full attention.It is so nice to watch/listen to this music and then go to sleep and wake up in the morning with the music still playing in my memory .One word that kept coming to mind between the time I watched the NetFlix and after I bought these DVDs : Gracious.I say : Buy it.  Enjoy it.",5,awe come on lieutenant . . . who knows . . . you might enjoy it . . .,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,1454,"['others', 'have', 'said', 'camera', 'change', 'lot', 'When', 'rented', 'NetFlix', 'viewed', 'once', 'too', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'hyper', 'purchased', 'discs', 'have', 'watched', 'couple', 'more', 'times', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'happy', 'pace', 'camera', 'work', 'interesting', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'camera', 'out', 'see', 'whole', 'stage', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'see', 'medium', 'shots', 'Miss', 'Mrs.', 'Mutter', 'not', 'just', 'nostrils', 'what', 'have', '.I', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'so', 'much', 'Stradivarius', 'up', 'close', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'breathtaking', 'violin', 'close', 'up', 'shot', 'video', '.Complain', 'complain', 'complain', 'just', 'enjoy', 'different', 'better', 'video', 'experience', 'available', 'DVDs.The', 'person', 'who', 'Anne-Sophie', 'Mutter', 'cold', 'unfriendly', 'must', 'be', 'speaking', 'other', 'experience', 'performance', 'what', 'see', 'other', 'performances', 'genuinely', 'friendly', 'appreciative', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'interacts', 'warmth', 'True', 'intense', 'times', 'NOT', 'PLAYING', 'AROUND', 'THIS', 'WORLD', 'CLASS', 'MOZART', 'giving', 'full', 'attention.It', 'so', 'nice', 'watch/listen', 'music', 'then', 'go', 'sleep', 'wake', 'up', 'morning', 'music', 'still', 'playing', 'memory', '.One', 'word', 'kept', 'coming', 'mind', 'time', 'watched', 'NetFlix', 'bought', 'DVDs', 'Gracious.I', 'say', 'Buy', 'Enjoy']",N/A

If I had to buy it at the higher price I would certainly still get this DVD.  Here, you get a video and audio performance designed for a high definition system.  Mutter is well known for her Mozart performances, and I have seen her perform Mozart twice live.  The performances on this disk are first rate.  The editing is very good.  The camera moves around but not in an annoying way, yet you see the amazing skill level of Ms. Mutter from several angles.  The sound in DTS is VERY pleasing.  I'm so happy to see a great performance that isn't 20+ years old with mediocre sound and flat filming.  This DVD is fantastic.  Is there a negative?  Well, there's always a negative.  The lighting on the sides focused on the symphonic players seem a little odd at times, but this is seen if you're looking for a flaw.  If you're a Mozart fan, a violin fan, a classical fan or a Mutter fan..... this disc will please you.  All 5 Mozart concertoes in great sound, filmed very well, with a fantastic performance.

1030215,A2WCM95GPISEEH,B000K2Q8EU,Roderick Keech,"[9, 9]","I purchased this DVD set with great anticipation.  I have enjoyed Anne-Sophie Mutter since her earliest recordings of the war horse Mendelssohn/Bruch Concertos with von Karajan, and the prospect of a double DVD set recorded in High Definition was too hard to resist.Upon loading disc one, I thought I had a dud DVD.  As another reviewer has stated, the orchestra seem to be out of focus and in some sort of haze.  I checked the packaging and the DVD, but no, it was not a bootleg.  I was about to complain and return it when I thought I would check other reviews of this set, and lo and behold, most reviewers had the same complaint.This is not a faulty DVD - it is exactly as the manufacturer intended.There is nothing wrong with the audio content - that is first class, as you would expect, but the director and Universal Classics ought to get a grip and realise that if they are going to advertise on the packaging that the performance is recorded in HD, then they ought to deliver.  Arty-farty (read:trendy) effects and editing do nothing but distract you from the sole purpose of buying the DVD: to watch the soloist and orchestra perform together in a clear and sparkling visual treat. Ms Mutter is always in sharp focus, looking elegant as usual - pity about the orchestra. I wondered if it was a filter on the camera or if the orchestra were being subjected to permanent respiratory damage due to the haze that seems to surround them.If I had known this before, I would have just bought the CDs, as the DVD is just too annoying for words.I wonder what Ms Mutter thinks ?",2,"High Definition, but only Ms Mutter",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1578,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'anticipation', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Anne-Sophie', 'Mutter', 'earliest', 'recordings', 'war', 'horse', 'Mendelssohn/Bruch', 'Concertos', 'von', 'Karajan', 'prospect', 'double', 'DVD', 'set', 'recorded', 'High', 'Definition', 'was', 'too', 'hard', 'resist.Upon', 'loading', 'disc', 'one', 'thought', 'had', 'dud', 'DVD', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'orchestra', 'seem', 'be', 'focus', 'sort', 'haze', 'checked', 'packaging', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'bootleg', 'was', 'about', 'complain', 'return', 'when', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'other', 'reviews', 'set', 'lo', 'behold', 'most', 'reviewers', 'had', 'same', 'complaint.This', 'not', 'faulty', 'DVD', 'exactly', 'manufacturer', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'audio', 'content', 'first', 'class', 'would', 'expect', 'director', 'Universal', 'Classics', 'ought', 'get', 'grip', 'realise', 'are', 'going', 'advertise', 'packaging', 'performance', 'recorded', 'HD', 'then', 'ought', 'deliver', 'Arty-farty', 'read', 'trendy', 'effects', 'editing', 'do', 'nothing', 'distract', 'sole', 'purpose', 'buying', 'DVD', 'watch', 'soloist', 'orchestra', 'perform', 'together', 'clear', 'sparkling', 'visual', 'treat', 'Ms', 'Mutter', 'always', 'sharp', 'focus', 'looking', 'elegant', 'usual', 'pity', 'orchestra', 'wondered', 'was', 'filter', 'camera', 'orchestra', 'were', 'being', 'subjected', 'permanent', 'respiratory', 'damage', 'due', 'haze', 'surround', 'them.If', 'had', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'bought', 'CDs', 'DVD', 'just', 'too', 'annoying', 'words.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'Ms', 'Mutter', 'thinks']",N/A

Sonatas include a piano and other instruments in a chamber or small room setting. Piano sonatas are ubiquitous and do not include other instruments.This recording by the German artist Anne-Sophie Mutter is called a concerto, which includes a symphony orchestra. Because symphony orchestras in Mozart's day were much smaller than the  symphonies being composed today, Mutter is able to conduct without adding a Conductor.This performance was held by Camerata Salzburg in Mozart's home town.
