However many people do not know where some of the other obscure traditions came from. No documentary could be the end-all be-all. However this one comes fairly close. At least it touches on the main themes and traditions of today's Christmas and their roots in history. A few things been overlooked such as Clara and her Nutcracker. But all in all you'll find that the subjects they cover are covered well. Who would've suspected the metamorphosis of Santa Claus? Or the real transference of the Christmas tree from its origins to the US?There are a lot of great visuals some nice music and narration by Harry Smith. I was surprised to see Elaine Pagels ""The Gnostic Gospels"" (1979); I think this was her first media introduction.Once again the history Channel does a good job of unwrapping Christmas for us and we get to enjoy watching snippets of our favorite old movies seeing our traditions from a traditional standpoint and downright have fun saying I didn't know that.",4,Yule light up my life,1293926400,"01 2, 2011",2011,1104,"['Christmas', 'Unwrapped', 'History', 'Christmas', '1997', 'TV', 'documentary', 'Everyone', 'December', '25', 'was', 'usurped', 'Christians', 'However', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'other', 'obscure', 'traditions', 'came', 'documentary', 'could', 'be', 'end-all', 'be-all', 'However', 'one', 'fairly', 'close', 'least', 'main', 'themes', 'traditions', 'today', 'Christmas', 'roots', 'history', 'few', 'things', 'been', 'overlooked', 'such', 'Clara', 'Nutcracker', ""'ll"", 'find', 'subjects', 'cover', 'are', 'covered', 'well', 'Who', 'would', ""'ve"", 'suspected', 'metamorphosis', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'real', 'transference', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'origins', 'US', 'are', 'lot', 'great', 'visuals', 'nice', 'music', 'narration', 'Harry', 'Smith', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Elaine', 'Pagels', 'Gnostic', 'Gospels', '1979', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'media', 'introduction.Once', 'again', 'history', 'Channel', 'good', 'job', 'unwrapping', 'Christmas', 'get', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'snippets', 'favorite', 'old', 'movies', 'seeing', 'traditions', 'traditional', 'standpoint', 'downright', 'have', 'fun', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'know']",N/A

892272,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B0007WFULA,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[2, 3]","The celebration is a mixture of pagan ritual and Christian assimilation. The Norse pagans called their winter celebration Yule. It consisted of feasting and an evergreen in the home because the tree symbolized life. The fire inside inspired the partying and protection from the demons outside. The ancient Germans were terrified of their mythical god Oden who rode the sky at night determining who would live and die in the following year.The ancient Romans celebrated a week before the winter solstice, with Saturnalia and Juvenalia, a feast that honored the children of Rome. The Patricians celebrated Mythra, the sun God. Since Mythra occurred around December 25th, it was an opportune way to supplant one celebration with a Christian one, and that day became the Church's official recognition of the birth of Christ, even though it is an unlikely birth date if ""shepherds were guarding their sheep"" in the freezing cold.The Christians knew they could not supplant the pagan celebrations, but they could assimilate them to a more Christian tradition. The evergreens could be decorated with apples to represent the Garden of Eden. These were the first Christmas ornaments. Holly, a midwinter decoration became a symbol of Christ's crown of thorns. By the Middle Ages, the faithful were called to celebrate Christ's Mass, which became known as Christmas.English celebrations were more debaucherous than reverent. They would demand favor and presents from the Lords of the Manor at the risk of being given a trick instead. (Sound familiar)? The landlord could be forgiven slights large and small by supplying his best provisions for making merry. But Oliver Cromwell and the Puritans proved to be the ""bah-humbugs"" of the 17th Century outlawing Christ's Mass and all other celebrations. Non-Puritans simply took their celebrations underground substituting Christmas Pie for Mince Pie. Once the king was restored to the throne the celebration was renewed.The Puritans in New England were no different than their religious cousins back home, but the Jamestown settlement celebrated Christmas introducing eggnog, ""nog"" being from grog or rum, but English traditions did not survive the Revolution in America where they were eschewed. Congress met on Christmas day in 1789 and continued to do so for the next 67 years!Charles Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" reflected the economic and social chasm between rich and poor, and a time when parents began to view their children less as subjects to be discipline and more to be nurtured. Presents at Christmas time were a reflection of that change.The Christmas tree might have remained an ancient pagan ritual had it not been for the marriage of the German Albert to his English cousin and bride, Victoria. He brought the German tradition of the Christmas tree to England, a ritual that took root in England and America. Not to be outdone, the Americans added the poinsettia to the Christmas celebration when Joel R. Poinsett brought the plant from Mexico. In 1843, an English firm began making Christmas cards that could be distributed through the newly formed postal services. The tree, the plant, and the card became popular on both sides of the Atlantic.The only place that Christmas could not be found by the mid 19th Century was in church. Pressure was put on the Protestant services to match the Christmas celebrations of the Catholic and Episcopalian faiths.There was only one thing missing.The Dutch celebrated the anniversary of St. Nicolas on December 6th.  Good children awoke to find presents from St. Nick, while naughty children received nothing. The Dutch brought the tradition to the New World, but it would become American when an Episcopal minister, inspired by the Dutch practice of Sinter Klaus, wrote a poem in 1822 about a good-natured elf that brought gifts to children in their homes by entering through the chimney. It wasn't until 1863 when Thomas Nast, a cartoonist, developed his version. He was fat and looked a lot like bearded robber barons who fleeced the poor. But this one gave to the children rather than take things from them. Santa Claus or St. Nick took form.Yule, Juvenalia, Mythra, evergreens, December 25th, apples and holly, Christmas cards, Christmas trees, and Santa Claus make people think that Christ's birthday was lost in Christmas celebrations, but it was never really only about Christ to begin with, as one historian noted. The secular celebration as well as the spiritual one need not be separate or in competition. It is doubtful that the spiritual one would have ever gained traction on its own or even survived if it had been the only form of celebration. Both go hand-in-hand rather than separate paths. Both reinforce each other.Christmas is the spirit of giving, and the belief that to give is better than to receive, that Christmas presents represent the ever-evolving mystery of Christmas.Perhaps that is the true spirit of Christmas.Merry Christmas!",5,The True Spirit of Christmas,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,4948,"['celebration', 'mixture', 'pagan', 'ritual', 'Christian', 'assimilation',

Stane ""Sunshine""","[1, 9]","1)  Because there was a pagan celebration in Norway and Rome in December does not mean that it had anything to do with the Christian's celebration of Christ's birth!2)  They stated that the early church did not celebrate Christ's birth, but rather only the Easter resurrection.  But historian Dr. Peter Hammond states the opposite, that there is evidence of Christians celebrating Christ's birth ever since Christ was born!  ""Roman Emperor, Aurelian, did attempt to inaugurate 25 Dec. as a pagan festival 'the birth of the unconquered Sun.' This was in AD 274.  Aurelian was attempting to breathe new life into a declining paganism devastated by the advances of Christianity.""3)  They stated that Christ was born when Shepherds were watching their flocks by night indicating springtime, not the cold winter.  But I was in Jerusalem in November and it was in the 90s.  Consider this: the Assumption of Mary was March 25th.  Nine months later is December 25th.4)  They stated, that in Rome, people were allowed to pay lip service to the new Christian God.  How absurd is this statement?  Christians were fed to lions for sport, tortured and massacred by the tens of thousands for centuries by the Romans!  Lip service???5)  They then skip 1500 years of Christian history and jump to the 17th century Puritans, who wanted to escape the commercialism of Christmas, so they abstained.  This does not mean that true Christians everywhere else were not celebrating the Birth of Christ!6)  They stated that the US Congress met on Christmas from 1789 for the next 67 years.  This is absolutely not true. Donald Richie, a Senate historian, stated that they were officially in session, but in actuality, the house met only once in 1797 and the Senate only once in 1802 on Christmas.  While visiting Colonial Williamsburg at Christmas, I saw first-hand how they celebrated Christmas since 1650.  The whole town does a march with drum, fife and three pointed hats down to the large lawn town center, and then they sing Christmas Carols together.  All of the charming colonial houses had Christmas candles in their windows.  This is where Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and Patrick Henry had lived.  Historian Peter Lillback wrote an exhaustive study, ""Sacred Fire,"" on Washington, who wrote that he deeply loved celebrating Christmas with his family at Mt. Vernon.  To suggest that early Americans didn't keep Christmas is just not true.7)  They stated that America reinvented Christmas for the whole world.  Rick Steves is a noted travel expert with his own TV show.  He made a DVD entitled, ""European Christmas"" which includes scores of Christian Christmas traditions from the last 2000 years.  The historical evidence is that there were devout Christians celebrating Christ's birth throughout Europe.  Not paganism like this phony presentation states.8)  They stated that it wasn't until around 1830 that families began to be interested in their children, so they gave them a Christmas myth.  Why am I even listening to this garbage???9)  And now we have the memory of St. Nicholas, being compared to an industrialist  ""robber baron"".  In reality, he was a generous Christian man who left presents for poor children on Christmas eve.10)  They failed to mention that the tradition of giving gifts began with the three eastern kings who came to see the Christ child.  They brought ""gold, frankincense and myrrh.""  Matthew 2:11.  This was first century, not 19th century!11)  They think that a blend of paganism and Christianity is a good thing???  But in reality, there is a war on Christmas right now in America.  And the atheist Marxists/ progressives/ secular humanists, are trying to remove every manger and cross from society.12)  They end by saying that the ""spirit of Christmas has always been with us and perhaps it always will.""  The Spirit of Christ?.... or the pagan spirit of commercialism and myth?  It depends on what you believe.

892276,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0007WFULA,Tim Janson,"[49, 52]","This documentary originally appeared on the history channel back in 1997 and has been repeated every year.  It has become a holiday favorite of mine even though I've seen it numerous times.  It's narrated by ""Early Show"" host Harry Smith and traces the roots of Christmas back to its earliest beginnings as a pagan Roman holiday of feasting.  We then see Christmas virtually outlawed by the Puritans but never forgotten.  TRhe holiday would enjoy a rebirth in the mid 1800's thanks to several people including Clement Moore's poem ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"", and cartoonist Thomas Nast who helped define the look of Santa Claus.From there we see the holiday further defined by popular culture in movies and TV and also by consumerism, as the holiday shopping season is invented and begins to really flourish at the turn of the 20th century.  Nast gives way to Haddon Sundblom's Santa paintings that he did for Coca Cola, finally giving us the jolly, fat santa we know today.  Throughout he documentary we get comments from historians such as Stephen Nissenbaum and Penne L. Restad who've written their own books about the origins of Christmas.  And comments from Humorist jean Shepherd, whose works the famous holiday film ""A Christmas Story"" was based on.It's a wonderful documentary.  As a Christmas fanatic I only wish it would have been longer but I never tire of seeing this each year.
