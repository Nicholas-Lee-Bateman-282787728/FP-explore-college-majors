To my surprise this film was well done! The storyline was well written. the actors were superb. there was character dynamic. The cinematography what flawless. Oh, and the movie was funny!! Also, it is one of the rare lesbian-themed films where there is a happy ending.

1227488,ANH213Y0DZZIV,B001PNY1EC,M. Skye,"[3, 3]","It's quirky, I'll give it that. Scarlet is a good person, though she tries to hide it. We don't really see the other woman, in any depth until the end, but we know she's a good person too. The minute they bring in a man to buffer the zone of okness between two women, especially in a lesbian film, I groan and think about turning it off;  comments about the man being 'like a brother' make it worse. Does one really think that screwing their brother is a good explanation for not doing the same to the woman in front of them?Still, I continued to watch because I wanted to see when Rosita would lose her accent. I secretly suspected she was Russian the whole time. I was gently surprised and happy when the two women developed some intimacy and Scarlet allowed herself to have some fun.Was happy with the conclusion, though would have been happier if the conclusion happened about midway and went on from there, not for the sex, which is fairly non-existent, but for the deeper happiness and intimacy they gave each other. Maybe watching a movie about deep happiness, intimacy and romance would be boring. If you have tendency to see lesbian film as generally abysmal, I recommend. It's why I gave it three stars. I wasn't counting the minutes for it to end.There is a light-hearted quality.
