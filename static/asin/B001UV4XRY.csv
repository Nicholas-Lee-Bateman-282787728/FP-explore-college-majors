Its a simple cop versus the world movie where Gibson plays a detective in the Boston police force. As the protagonist, Gibson's character pushes the story slowly through government and classified secrets. I really enjoyed the cinematography it really showed the power Gibson's character had at times and how lonely he was at others. I enjoyed the whole storyline and even the ending was well done; it leaves enough open for imagination and gives just the right amount of information. I give the movie 3 out of 5 stars. It was good enough to rent and watch but I wouldn't go out and buy it. I would recommend to families that are accustomed to violence and language and movies, it is rated R.

1241727,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B001UV4XRY,amerdale876,"[7, 8]","A lot has been said in the press about Mel Gibson ever since his infamous DUI exchange with a police officer. Honestly, though, no matter if the guy likes to drink - and what he slurs out of his mouth at the time - or not, the guy can act. His latest, Edge of Darkness, based on the 1985 BBC miniseries, is directed by the director of the miniseries Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) and offers up one of the best revenge thrillers I've seen sinceTaken [Blu-ray] andMunich (Widescreen Edition).The story follows Boston Detective Thomas Craven (Gibson) who witnesses the brutal murder of his daughter, Emma (Bojana Novakovic), and then conducts a rogue murder investigation into who committed the crime, which leads him across some rather mysterious, smarmy characters, including Ray Winstone and Danny Huston. Sounds like a basic plot, but, like most revenge thrillers, there's a lot more to the story than meets the eye, and there are plenty of moral ambiguities that come into play. Director Campbell uses his same trademark pacing that made the likes ofCasino Royale (Collector's Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray],The Mask of Zorro [Blu-ray] andGoldenEyeso great. As for Gibson, he's had a paramount list of films in his resume that have dealt with revenge before and all of them are superb (i.e.,Ransom (Special Edition),The Patriot (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray],Braveheart (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray],Payback - Straight Up - The Director's Cut [Blu-ray]). In all of these films, he has this moment where, through just the look on his face, he conveys such emotion in one expression. And that moment in this film is just after Craven has witnessed the murder of his only daughter and his buddy cop comes in amidst the coroners, cops and media to see Craven sitting calmly on his couch, just staring. Just that one look is proof enough that Gibson is an actor in every sense of the word. The look on his face is pure determination, betrayal and enraged wrath all in one. It's a look that reminds me of the famous General George S. Patton quote: ""May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't."" And that's the moment in the movie when you know that you're in for one hell of a ride!Of course, most quests for revenge are not clean and they're definitely not pretty. Craven goes down a path full of twists and turns with which he never knew his daughter was involved. While the father discovers his daughter's secret life, he never waivers in his belief in her character, and it's that drive that pushes him in his quest for truth and justice. As a father of two young girls, with the subject matter, this movie is difficult to watch. The scenes that especially got to me were the ones where he pictured his daughter as a little girl and the moments they shared. But each scene is vital to the strength of the story and our belief and devotion in Gibson's character's drive.Many of those who have seen the original BBC miniseries that the film is based on may say this isn't as good as the original, which is easy to say when the miniseries had more than two hours to tell a story. However, I thought this remake lived up very well to the original and was just as good. In fact, this film was a great ride that I wouldn't exactly describe as ""a non-stop thrill ride."" But I would say that it is one great revenge thriller; it certainly beats out the most recentLaw Abiding Citizen [Blu-ray]. The only main drawback was Ray Winstone's delivery of lines; his voice was so mumbled that I and the other audience members could hardly understand what he was saying. I often heard viewers around me asking again and again what he had just said.Nevertheless, ""Edge of Darkness"" is one of the most taut thrillers I've seen in a long time, and is easy to enjoy with its tense action and pacing, smart plot, and great acting. Say what you will about the man but Gibson delivers again and again with each performance.",4,Gibson shines in Darkness,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,3900,"['lot', 'been', 'said', 'press', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'ever', 'infamous', 'DUI', 'exchange', 'police', 'officer', 'Honestly', 'though', 'matter', 'guy', 'drink', 'what', 'mouth', 'time', 'not', 'guy', 'can', 'act', 'latest', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'based', '1985', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'directed', 'director', 'miniseries', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'revenge', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'sinceTaken', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'andMunich', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '.The', 'story', 'Boston', 'Detective', 'Thomas', 'Craven', 'Gibson', 'who', 'brutal', 'murder', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Bojana', 'Novakovic', 'then', 'rogue', 'murder', 'investigation', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'smarmy', 'characters', 'including', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'basic', 'plot', 'most', 'revenge', 'thrillers', 'lot', 'more', 'story', 'eye', 'are', 'plenty', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'come', 'play', 'Director', 'Campbell', 'same', 'trademark', 'pacing', 'made', 'likes', 'ofCasino', 'Royale', 'Collector', 'Edition', '+', 'BD', 'Live', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Mask', 'Zorro', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'great', 'Gibson', 'had', 'paramount', 'list', 'films', 'resume', 'have', 'dealt', 'revenge', 'are', 'superb', 'i.e.', 'Ransom', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Patriot', 'Extended', 'Cut', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Braveheart', 'Sapphire', 'Series', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Payback', 'Straight', 'Up', 'Director', 'Cut', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'films', 'moment', 'where', 'just', 'look', 'face', 'conveys', 'such', 'emotion', 'one', 'expression', 'moment', 'film', 'just', 'Craven', 'witnessed', 'murder', 'only', 'daughter', 'buddy', 'cop', 'amidst', 'coroners', 'cops', 'media', 'see', 'Craven', 'sitting', 'calmly', 'couch', 'just', 'staring', 'Just', 'one', 'look', 'proof', 'enough', 'Gibson', 'actor', 'sense', 'word', 'look', 'face', 'pure', 'determination', 'betrayal', 'enraged', 'wrath', 'one', 'look', 'famous', 'General', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'quote', 'May', 'God', 'have', 'mercy', 'enemies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'moment', 'movie', 'when', 'know', ""'re"", 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'course', 'most', 'quests', 'revenge', 'are', 'not', 'clean', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'not', 'pretty', 'Craven', 'down', 'path', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'never', 'knew', 'daughter', 'was', 'involved', 'father', 'daughter', 'secret', 'life', 'never', 'belief', 'character', 'drive', 'quest', 'truth', 'justice', 'father', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'difficult', 'watch', 'scenes', 'especially', 'got', 'were', 'ones', 'where', 'pictured', 'daughter', 'little', 'girl', 'moments', 'shared', 'scene', 'vital', 'strength', 'story', 'belief', 'devotion', 'Gibson', 'character', 'drive.Many', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'film', 'based', 'may', 'say', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'easy', 'say', 'when', 'miniseries', 'had', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'tell', 'story', 'However', 'thought', 'remake', 'lived', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'original', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'ride', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'describe', 'non-stop', 'thrill', 'ride', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'great', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'certainly', 'out', 'most', 'recentLaw', 'Abiding', 'Citizen', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'only', 'main', 'drawback', 'was', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'delivery', 'lines', 'voice', 'was', 'so', 'mumbled', 'other', 'audience', 'members', 'could', 'hardly', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'often', 'heard', 'viewers', 'asking', 'again', 'again', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'said.Nevertheless', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'one', 'most', 'taut', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'easy', 'enjoy', 'tense', 'action', 'pacing', 'smart', 'plot', 'great', 'acting', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'man', 'Gibson', 'delivers', 'again', 'again', 'performance']",N/A

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Edge of Darkness stars Mel Gibson playing the role of a father/cop who's forced to experience his daughter's sudden tragic death which occurs the very moment she walks out the front door in the beginning of the film (immediately after she runs outside throwing up blood- yeah, not a pretty way to go).  This is actually one of about three VERY shocking scenes that completely caught me off guard, and will probably do the same for you as well.  There's no sign these shocking segments are about to occur which makes them pretty startling to say the least.While watching the movie you will probably be able to sense that all the friends of the Mel Gibson's daughter (along with the boyfriend) are acting extremely terrified for their lives, but for a while it's never clear exactly why.  There's a good reason for this- there's a conspiracy going on, but I won't spoil exactly what it is.  It's good though.  A lot of good suspense in this regard.Maybe it's just me, but Mel Gibson didn't seem particularly bothered by his daughter's death immediately after it happened.  Maybe he was going through shock, but if you notice he seemed pretty emotionless.The only reason I'm not giving the movie a 5-star rating is because it goes through its share of dry spells concerning VERY slow-moving storyline development whenever Mel Gibon's character either communicates with the police department or goes on a seach to figure out who the murderer is.  Sometimes the conversations between Mel's character and everyone else becomes so quiet and uninteresting it almost feels like total pointlessness.  However keep watching, because eventually the storyline will become exciting again.  You just have to deal with some subpar moments.  The conclusion is fantastic.Overall, it's a good murder mystery-type film.  Just be prepared for some slow, uninteresting segments from time to time.",4,has its ups and downs,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1874,"['Edge', 'Darkness', 'stars', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'playing', 'role', 'father/cop', 'who', 'forced', 'experience', 'daughter', 'sudden', 'tragic', 'death', 'very', 'moment', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'beginning', 'film', 'immediately', 'throwing', 'up', 'blood-', 'yeah', 'not', 'pretty', 'way', 'go', 'actually', 'one', 'three', 'VERY', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'completely', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'will', 'probably', 'do', 'same', 'as', 'well', 'sign', 'shocking', 'segments', 'are', 'occur', 'pretty', 'startling', 'say', 'least.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'sense', 'friends', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'acting', 'extremely', 'terrified', 'lives', 'while', 'never', 'clear', 'exactly', 'why', 'good', 'reason', 'this-', 'conspiracy', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'exactly', 'what', 'good', 'lot', 'good', 'suspense', 'regard.Maybe', 'just', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'bothered', 'daughter', 'death', 'immediately', 'happened', 'Maybe', 'was', 'going', 'shock', 'notice', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'emotionless.The', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'movie', '5-star', 'rating', 'share', 'dry', 'spells', 'concerning', 'VERY', 'slow-moving', 'storyline', 'development', 'whenever', 'Mel', 'Gibon', 'character', 'communicates', 'police', 'department', 'seach', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'murderer', 'Sometimes', 'conversations', 'Mel', 'character', 'everyone', 'else', 'so', 'quiet', 'uninteresting', 'almost', 'feels', 'total', 'pointlessness', 'However', 'keep', 'watching', 'eventually', 'storyline', 'will', 'become', 'exciting', 'again', 'just', 'have', 'deal', 'subpar', 'moments', 'conclusion', 'fantastic.Overall', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery-type', 'film', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'slow', 'uninteresting', 'segments', 'time', 'time']",N/A

1241737,A3F0OFSE2M25U2,B001UV4XRY,bronx book nerd,"[0, 0]","Mel Gibson became a controversial Hollywood figure after he created The Passion of the Christ.  The film, focusing on Christ's final days, was not received well by Hollywood elites - it was too gory and it was filmed in Aramaic.  The underlying problem was that the film was also an expression of Gibson's Catholic faith.  Once the movie was out, and with all the controversy stirring around it, the best thing that could happen to Hollywood would be for Gibson to self-implode.  That he did after his drunken driving arrest and his anti-Semitic remarks to arresting officers.  Hollywood couldn't have scripted it better: Gibson was now just a hypocrite, as much a sinner as anyone else.The above is why I believe that this film, Edge of Darkness, did not get the acclaim that it deserves.  It is one of the best movies of its kind, the action/thriller.  Gibson displays his magnificent acting skills, convincingly playing a cop father distraught by his daughter's murder.  He struggles with this, at times hallucinating his daughter's voice and presence.  He portrays the character with the appropriate intensity without going too far.  The other actors are excellent too, all handling their roles more than adequately and helping make the plot believable.  The plot itself was very good.  Stories like these, with twists and turns that keep you in suspense, can get into trouble: how could he have known that?  How did he get there so quickly?  Except for one odd issue with a key prop, none of this occurred.  The viewer is riveted to the movie, waiting with anticipation for what happens next.  The story builds appropriately to a satisfying climax, and not necessarily the one you would expect.

Many have said that it's a typical revenge flick, and many are right about that, but in another sense, it isn't typical because unlike most revenge flicks, Mel Gibson gives this one heart and complexity. The film truly explores the emotions felt when a Massachusetts police officer loses everything he has in the world, his daughter. With appropriate humor in places and an odd relationship with a hitman that stands on the opposite side of the dilemma, the movie has a righteousness about it.EDGE OF DARKNESS is one of the movies that you really can't say too much about without giving away plot points and ruining it for people who haven't seen it, so I won't. But I will say that the movie has an err of truth about power and how the highest of them all have walls, security and money, but they too have to answer to somebody and many times, power is a thin thin line.DARKNESS isn't just a slam bam action fest where Bronson, Schwartzenegger or Seagal going kicking everybody's butts.  Mel Gibson plays Thomas Craven, who kicks the appropriate people's butts. It has intelligence and it has a mystery among its circumstance. Although the mystery may be pretty easy to figure out, it still delivers with locking in its audience. Besides, who doesn't like a movie where somebody grabs the attorney's and politicians of the world by their throats and shakes some truth and reality out of em'?This movie should be required viewing for all people who pass the bar or get elected to public office.

A variety of mysterious characters prevent the film from being predictable, and you're thrown an interesting curveball from what the movie's trailer might lead you to assume about the story.

Sanders, Caterina Scorsone and Denis O'HareWRITTEN BY: William Monahan, Andre Bovell and Tony Kennedy MartinDIRECTED BY: Martin CampbellRated: RGenre: ThrillerRelease Date: 29 January 2010Review Date: 21 March 2010The legendary Mel Gibson is back and doing what he does best: playing pissed off and kicking butt! This is the first true `Mel flick' that he's acted in since the awesome Signs, was released in 2002, so it's long overdue. He's in my top five actors of all time, so needless to say, I was like a kid in a candy store, watching him shine on the big screen.Edge of Darkness wasn't a great movie, but it was a good one and Mel's performance will not disappoint you.  He plays a homicide detective named Thomas Craven. Yeah, we've seen him play a cop countless times, but here he throws in a catchy East coast accent that we enjoy.As far as I remember, his wife if he ever had one, was never mentioned. It's just him and his daughter and we meet them in a scene in the opening of the film that bonds us to both of them quickly. They are real people and this makes us able to appreciate what soon happens to them.Craven's daughter is brutally murdered and he's not sure if he was the target or if it was just divine circumstance. Regardless of the cause, he's devastated and enraged and the film takes us off onto a grizzly quest for answers and vengeance.As he begins to find clues to her mysteries murder, he realizes that she may have been living a life that he had no knowledge of. This angers him more, and he begins to get a little rough with those with whom he has questions to ask. One guy is asked kindly to remove his sunglasses, only to receive a brutal punch to the face. Another is pulled over on the street, has his window bashed in and meets face to face with Craven's handgun. Good stuff here folks; classic Mel.Director Martin Campbell knows what he's doing with the camera and is good at building suspense with it. At times he has us so captivated in what is going on with the characters that our attention is invested there, and we never see some of the nice scares coming.

So when a gunman shows up at his door and kills his daughter, Craven automatically thinks they were gunning for him.  But were they?  Why was his daughter so sick?  Why had she suddenly decided to come home?  Why was she carrying a gun?  And just what was her job at the Northmoor weapons manufacturing company?Say what you want about the man; Mel Gibson, as an actor and director, is nearly unequaled.  When he wants, he can sink his teeth into a role and never give up--and he wants to here.  Gibson breathes life into Craven, making him a sympathetic, flawed hero.  Ray Winstone, as a mysterious British special op, is also dynamite (as always).  Danny Houston makes a great villain, even though he doesn't have much to work with.And that is the main flaw of the film: it's forced at times, and this leads to a plot that just don't seem to make much sense (or make its audience care).  I haven't seen the original miniseries; I'm guessing the problems here are condensing a longer, complicated plot into one 2-hour experience.  It just doesn't always fit; this is far from William Monahan's best script, and it's certainly not Martin Campbell's best directing effort.  Yet, the film IS a step or two above the usual thrillers of its type, mainly because of Gibson's bleak performance.  It all leads up to an ending that is deplorable (I'm talking about the very last scene, not the ending in general), but the ride along the way is well-worth it.  He's a cop with nothing to lose--so fasten your seat belt.

1241755,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B001UV4XRY,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[3, 4]","Director Martin Campbell refashions his 1986Edge of Darkness: The Complete BBC Seriesto fit into a two-hour film format of the same name starring Mel Gibson as the tortured father using his police credentials to discover the identity of his daughter's murderer.  Is it a successful re-creation?  For all intents and purposes, the piece does work as an example of unrelenting drama with a visceral reality that smarts the eyes and turns the stomach.  A visibly older Gibson stares at the audience with a creased death mask perpetually beleaguered by the devastating emotions that he refuses to let permeate his spirit and divert him from his goal.  His love for his daughter Emma (Bojana Novakovic) tangibly resides in a telling slackness of his facial muscles, not unlike that which Liam Neeson utilizes in ""Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)"".  This softness flickers intermittently from the still intense blue eyes to the lines around mouth, but again as it does for Neeson, it hardens emulating the manic lethality of Clint Eastwood'sDirty Harry.  For the most part, he is Mel weathered by his own stormy Hollywood saga--as tightly wound as a key-operated Swiss mantle clock.  His performance seethes with pent up anger; he makes us feel both his pain and need for answers.No doubt it is difficult to cut down the six hours of miniseries into two hours of film time.  Many of the intricacies must be diluted to fit the abbreviated formats, allowing the director longer ""ah-ha"" moments for his audience to savor.  In this 2010 film format Campbell shrinks the larger behind-the-scenes intrigue to fleeting moments filled with muffled voices and characters that are not always identified.  As much as the Ray Winstone (Beowulf) `cleaner' character entertained, his lower-pitched intonations along with Mel's teeth-clenching one-liners were not always easy to hear. Nevertheless, Campbell succeeds in putting his finger to the pulse of the cultural zeitgeist regarding environmental concerns interwoven with political and capitalistic conspiracies played for money, power and world domination.Bottom line?  Mel Gibson plays a convincing father grieving for his brutally murdered daughter in the political/environmental thriller ""Edge of Darkness.""  Somber lighting and Boston rain augment the already gritty subject matter.  Projectile vomiting and other visceral signs of imminent death amply illustrate the fatalistic themes of a sick government bottle-feeding an equally unhealthy and narcissistic industry.  (The audience applauds amidst gasps of horror as Mel force-feeds technology company CEO Danny Huston some super-spoiled milk.)  Some scenes reek with harsh realities and are not for the faint of heart.  Director Martin Campbell does an adequate job of converting his six-hour BBC miniseries of the same name to film format with a bit of an updated twist, however he should have hired a better dialect/accent coach to better re-create the many different speech patterns of beloved Beantown.

In fact, as stated, insofar as any trouble was taken to explain it, hardly a conspiracy for Evil at all. It's true that I don't pay much attention to these explanations in films or thriller novels. I won't  go into the old 'guys in prison gag', but the truth of it is, I have heard so many of these through the years, that all I require is that they tell me, ' Conspiracy 353', and I immediately gear up without the necessity for any long-winded explanations. Presumably, we have all been trained to this by the time we reach voting age.At any rate, what we do know is that Mel Gibson, Boston Cop, has seen his daughter shot down on his doorstep. The figuring is, that it was a failed attempt to get Mel, but things look differently once he begins to investigate. Gibson is fine as the Cop and Father, and there is some very solid support by a handful of featured players, and competent work by the remainer. Having just learned that this is based on a BBC television extended mini-series, I now understand the somewhat choppy nature of the screenplay; however, any elision of matter is hardly missed, at least by those like myself, who have never seen the original.As played here, my personal feeling is that there was a bit too much heart and flowers in those remembered scenes with the daughter growing up: topping that by far, however, were the archaic early 20th Century scenes with the imagined daughter, particularly the last such; it brought back memories of Lionel Barrymore, Edward G. Robinson, Spencer Tracy and cadres of others in the silent and talkie era, who had to play that sort of thing straight. Takes a good actor not to gag on it.Never mind, though,  the movie is a good take on the old 30's cops and dirty politicians theme, the 'conspiracy' stuff is simply  a translation of the old Mob-City Politicos and Dirtycops  theme, and it will likely hold the average viewer's interest throughout.",4,Good Conspiracy Drama,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,1978,"['good', 'conspiracy', 'drama', 'not', 'very', 'coherent', 'conspiracy', 'fact', 'stated', 'insofar', 'trouble', 'was', 'taken', 'explain', 'hardly', 'conspiracy', 'Evil', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'explanations', 'films', 'thriller', 'novels', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'old', ""'guys"", 'prison', 'gag', 'truth', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'require', 'tell', 'Conspiracy', '353', 'immediately', 'gear', 'up', 'necessity', 'long-winded', 'explanations', 'Presumably', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'time', 'reach', 'voting', 'age.At', 'rate', 'what', 'do', 'know', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Boston', 'Cop', 'seen', 'daughter', 'shot', 'down', 'doorstep', 'figuring', 'was', 'failed', 'attempt', 'get', 'Mel', 'things', 'look', 'differently', 'once', 'investigate', 'Gibson', 'fine', 'Cop', 'Father', 'very', 'solid', 'support', 'handful', 'featured', 'players', 'competent', 'work', 'remainer', 'Having', 'just', 'learned', 'based', 'BBC', 'television', 'extended', 'mini-series', 'now', 'understand', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'nature', 'screenplay', 'however', 'elision', 'matter', 'hardly', 'missed', 'least', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original.As', 'played', 'here', 'personal', 'feeling', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'flowers', 'remembered', 'scenes', 'daughter', 'growing', 'up', 'topping', 'far', 'however', 'were', 'archaic', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'scenes', 'imagined', 'daughter', 'particularly', 'last', 'such', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'Lionel', 'Barrymore', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'cadres', 'others', 'silent', 'talkie', 'era', 'who', 'had', 'play', 'sort', 'thing', 'straight', 'Takes', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'gag', 'it.Never', 'mind', 'though', 'movie', 'good', 'take', 'old', '30', 'cops', 'dirty', 'politicians', 'theme', ""'conspiracy"", 'stuff', 'simply', 'translation', 'old', 'Mob-City', 'Politicos', 'Dirtycops', 'theme', 'will', 'likely', 'hold', 'average', 'viewer', 'interest']",N/A

I haven't seen the original, nor read the book, but from an entertainment perspective; this movie is a true winner.Without providing spoilers, what I liked about this film was the character identification. This film took the time, up front, to explore the main character's psyche and develop a decent understanding of he and his his approaches to life. Don't get me wrong, there could have been more and I was left with some questions of background that went unresolved, yet I understood enough to comprehend the meaning and motivations of the movie so that it made sense in a complicated plot.As to the plot, it begins sleepy, but quickly (with some foreshadowing) it cascades into a big brother, murder mystery/action flick that involves tons of intrigue without ever stalling, as so many movies do. In fact, this film moves rather quickly, never disappointing those that have different interests, whether they be mystery, drama, or action - it has it all.One of the few criticisms I have is that you will want to see this film with the volume high in certain spots, or you will miss critical dialogue. I found myself replaying certain sections with volume double that of other scenes in order to understand important content. Be careful to lower the volume, however, as there are certain scenes that will creep up on you and provide some real decibel shock!One final thing. There is a certain realism to this movie. The actors don't overact. Gibson is excellently cast and he does a terrific job in this, now, familiar role. The plot is not inconceivable in reality.

Max Gooding,"[3, 3]","This film, although it is an action thriller, has emotional depth, and as usual, Mel Gibson delivers big as homicide detective Thomas Craven. From the start of Mel Gibson's career as an actor, he has been able to sum up emotional depth, especially when a family member is killed in the movie, as was the case in Mad Max in 1979 (where his wife and toddler were brutally run over by a motocycle gang.)When it comes to taking revenge in a film, the roles that Mel Gibson takes would normally go full blast. This movie starts out with video clip of him and his 8 year old [or so] daughter. The bond between them seems strong and the mother never seems to be a part of their lives. (No explanation is given concerning this.)The plot has a lot of depth as well, and after the sudden, shocking and graphic murder of his now adult daughter at his front door, the journey starts. Please note that there is a lot of graphic footage of murder victims in this film. There are a lot of twists as a father seeks to get to the depths of the cause of his daughter's murder.You will need to follow the story closely, if you are to be able to keep up with Detective Craven as he seeks to get answers.In my opinion, the cast is well choosen as well, from the corrupt politicians to crooked policemen and ruthless business executives. One of the most interesting characters presented is Jedburgh (Ray Winstone). He is a well seasoned killer and has a nack for being eccentric and unpredictable, he adds a nice flavor to the film.In conclusion, this film varies in its momentum, its irregular rythm ensures that you can't just say what will happen next.

It would be a shame to think that Mel Gibson's current off-screen life kept audiences skeptical, but for those who respect excellent filmmaking, this is a pleaser.Tom Craven (Mel Gibson, in very fine form) is a Boston detective who keeps to himself, inviting his beloved daughter home Emma (Bojana Novakovic) for a weekend, only to see her become progressively ill, and when about to take her to see a doctor, Emma is shot and killed: Tom thinks the shot was meant for him and though devastated by the death of his only child he pursues the killer.  As the story unravels Tom discovers that Emma was employed by a corporation - headed by the smoothly smarmy Jack Bennett (Danny Huston) - whose activities are scrupulously classified.  Tom tries to gain information form Emma's boyfriend David (Shawn Roberts, a new talent to watch!), discovers a girl Melissa (Caterina Scorsone) who reveals information about Emma's ties to a truth seeking group who are attempting to uncover the big corporate connection to the government.  A British man Jedburgh (Ray Winstone) appears on the scene, converses with Tom as well as the corporate villains (including Senator Pine -Damian Young) and Tom's drive to discover the truth about Emma's death and an incredible conspiracy results in one surprising and terrifying event after another.Mel Gibson is in top form once again, proving that he can still rise to amazingly fine acting challenges.  He is ably supported by Winstone and Huston as well as a fine supporting cast that includes such talents as Gbenga Akinnagbe, Wayne Duval, Shawn Roberts, Jay O. Sanders, David Aaron Baker, Denis O'Hare, and Frank Grillo.  Phil Meheux is the superb Director of Photography and Howard Shore once again provides a music score that underscores the tension.

She is not pregnant. She is gunned down at his front door, as he is standing beside her. The first question, as previously indicated, is did the gunman mean to kill him or his daughter? He discovers that she was carrying a gun and the gun belonged to her boy friend, who he does not like, and this friend refuses to tell him anything citing fear of being killed.The problem that some viewers may find in the film is Gibson's acting.

What starts out as a routine detective/revenge story turns into a loopy and violent conspiracy thriller. There's alot of plot twists and not all of them make sense but it's energetic and filled with colorful characters and a protagonist you want to root for. The action is also incredibly well done, though I'd expect nothing less from the director of Casino Royale.A big reason I never saw this film in the theaters was having Mel Gibson in the starring role. He's getting older and his real-life outbursts and anti-semetism is more than a little off-putting (he seems to be trying to prove himself one of the worst human beings on the planet!). Thankfully Gibson fully disappears into his role with a decent bostonian accent and solid acting chops and charisma. Equally good (and delightfully dark humored) is Ray Winstone as an assassin conducting his own investigation. Danny Huston is well cast as a shady corporate man with alot of secrets.While Edge of Darkness may not be best movie of the year it is a VERY well done and entertaining film.

1241782,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001UV4XRY,Jason,"[2, 2]","Directed by Martin Campbell, and based on an eponymous 1985 BBC mini-series, Edge of Darkness is a character-driven, hard-hitting action that explores what one man will do for revenge, and the depth of the often incestuous conspiracies between governments and corporations.Boston homicide detective Tom Craven (Mel Gibson) is visited by his estranged daughter Emma.  Soon after her arrival Tom realizes she is not well, sleeping quite a bit, developing nose-bleeds, and he decides taking her to the emergency room is best.  Before he can even get her into the car, a masked man surprises them, screams their surname, and uses a shotgun to Jackson Pollock the Craven family house with Emma's viscera.  Initially bewildered and in shock, Tom soon decides to put on his detective hat and figure out which one of his enemies killed his daughter.  After a little investigation, however, he finds his daughter's gun, learns of her work at Northmoor - a weapons manufacturer - and realizes the mystery surrounding his daughter's death may be deeper than initially realized.Scouring the city for clues, Craven soon discovers a web of deceit.  Digging knee deep into the murder, he uses his tools, experience, connections, and ingenuity to find the truth.  Along the way he must intimidate government officials, cut through the red tape of the slimy CEO of Northmoor (Danny Huston), and dodge the veiled threats from a mysterious government cleaner named Darius Jedburgh (Roy Winstone).  The deeper he digs, the more dangerous it becomes, as those with power wish to keep their secrets hidden.To be honest, the plot is nothing new.  Seen too many times to mention - the most recent noteworthy attempt was Death Wish Neeson (akaTaken) and before it Death Wish Foster (akaThe Brave One) - and goes all the way back to the grand-daddy of relentless revenge without restrictions movies, Death Wish.  The setup is quite simple: Mess with protagonist's family, unleash protagonist with righteous indignation upon the enemy with complete disregard for the surroundings.Gibson absolutely nails the role of Tom Craven.  Capable of flipping the switch from sympathetic, heartbroken, emotionally destroyed and in denial, to complex intensity and rage; not only is his range of emotions nearly unequaled in Hollywood, but his layered performance in Edge of Darkness is a relatable, grounded, believable hero that elicits emotion and support.  The other primary actors, Huston and Winstone, are very good, but Winston unfortunately delivers several lines like he has a mouth full of marblesDosed with realism, this great revenge thriller rendition is phenomenal because the action is nonstop and because Gibson absolutely delivers in his long-awaited comeback to acting.Jason Elin",5,DEATH WISH GIBSON!,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,2758,"['Directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'based', 'eponymous', '1985', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'character-driven', 'hard-hitting', 'action', 'what', 'one', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'revenge', 'depth', 'often', 'incestuous', 'conspiracies', 'governments', 'corporations.Boston', 'homicide', 'detective', 'Tom', 'Craven', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'visited', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Soon', 'arrival', 'Tom', 'not', 'well', 'sleeping', 'quite', 'bit', 'developing', 'nose-bleeds', 'taking', 'emergency', 'room', 'best', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'car', 'masked', 'man', 'screams', 'surname', 'shotgun', 'Jackson', 'Pollock', 'Craven', 'family', 'house', 'Emma', 'viscera', 'Initially', 'bewildered', 'shock', 'Tom', 'soon', 'put', 'detective', 'hat', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'enemies', 'killed', 'daughter', 'little', 'investigation', 'however', 'daughter', 'gun', 'learns', 'work', 'Northmoor', 'weapons', 'manufacturer', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'daughter', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'deeper', 'initially', 'realized.Scouring', 'city', 'clues', 'Craven', 'soon', 'web', 'deceit', 'Digging', 'knee', 'deep', 'murder', 'tools', 'experience', 'connections', 'ingenuity', 'find', 'truth', 'way', 'must', 'intimidate', 'government', 'officials', 'cut', 'red', 'tape', 'slimy', 'CEO', 'Northmoor', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'dodge', 'veiled', 'threats', 'mysterious', 'government', 'cleaner', 'named', 'Darius', 'Jedburgh', 'Roy', 'Winstone', 'deeper', 'more', 'dangerous', 'power', 'wish', 'keep', 'secrets', 'hidden.To', 'be', 'honest', 'plot', 'nothing', 'new', 'Seen', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'mention', 'most', 'recent', 'noteworthy', 'attempt', 'was', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Neeson', 'akaTaken', 'Death', 'Wish', 'Foster', 'akaThe', 'Brave', 'One', 'way', 'back', 'grand-daddy', 'relentless', 'revenge', 'restrictions', 'movies', 'Death', 'Wish', 'setup', 'quite', 'simple', 'Mess', 'protagonist', 'family', 'unleash', 'protagonist', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'enemy', 'complete', 'disregard', 'surroundings.Gibson', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Tom', 'Craven', 'Capable', 'flipping', 'switch', 'sympathetic', 'heartbroken', 'emotionally', 'destroyed', 'denial', 'complex', 'intensity', 'rage', 'not', 'only', 'range', 'emotions', 'nearly', 'unequaled', 'Hollywood', 'layered', 'performance', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'relatable', 'grounded', 'believable', 'hero', 'emotion', 'support', 'other', 'primary', 'actors', 'Huston', 'Winstone', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Winston', 'unfortunately', 'several', 'lines', 'mouth', 'full', 'marblesDosed', 'realism', 'great', 'revenge', 'thriller', 'rendition', 'phenomenal', 'action', 'nonstop', 'Gibson', 'absolutely', 'long-awaited', 'comeback', 'acting.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

1241791,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B001UV4XRY,Jordan David,"[1, 1]","Alright, here's the deal:  Mel Gibson is a man with troubles.  He always has been, and he likely always will be.  No doubt a madman, at that.  But he's OUR madman and, as such, we're responsible for the guy.  And I may be in a minority, here, but I want a Gibson comeback more than anything right now.And, although some (many) would be opposed to this, his performance in Campbell's ""Edge of Darkness"" is a damn strong argument.  Mel is still Mel; a mad scientist of a performer who pendulum-swings back and forth between a genius and a headline grabbing anti-semitist.  But when he's the former, he ranks among cinema's most consistent badasses.It's a powerhouse performance that Gibson puts his heart into, if only to remind us of what he's still capable of.  Never forcing the envelope that bounds him between a loving father and a vengeful killer, the balance is impeccably crafted; one wrong move, and Gibson's credibility is shot to pieces.  It's a balancing act that the actor pulls off smashingly, and he makes the movie his own with the ease of a veteran.True to Campbell's track record, Darkness spawns the thrills and shocking, albeit surprisingly classy, action that restrains itself long enough for the intriguing plot to unfold.There's an offset to being in the film that marks the attempted comeback of an actor, and Winstone and Huston get the brunt of it.  Supporting performances are strong, as one would expect from both, but the film was made to belong to Gibson, and there's only enough room for them to wriggle into their characters before their screen time is over.  Winstone, especially, feels half-baked, and his interactions with Gibson throughout the film mark the more needlessly obscure moments in an otherwise brisk, taut and matter-of-fact flick.It's not a film that is build upon a foundation of trickery, despite the mysterious nature of everything.

Slevin,"[5, 5]","I guess Mel, mellowing with age, has slowed the pace down for less of an action role to more of a well thought out process of getting what he wants.  Yes, he still has the  ""I am a good guy and have to do this to get even with the bad guy"" routine.  But the movies simply keeps moving forward towards its inevitable climax.  This makes me want to watch the show that it was adapted from.  Mel, being of Irish decent, plays a Boston Irish cop, accent and all, seeking to find out who kills his daughter after yelling out the family name.  Were they after him? Why?  You know from the trailer that he is setting out to right the wrong.Mel is serious all the way through the film.  Craven reconnects with his estranged daughter who is working as an intern for some company, which? he does not know.  He loses her fairly quickly, turning things very serious.  You get all of the Mel Gibson intensity without the usual corny theatrics you may see in Lethal Weapon, The Patriot or others.  Nor is there any banter and clowning you may have seen in other films, whimsically playing a funnier role is not what this is about.  The movie is much more like Ransom, yet, there are no one liners (give me back my son)that comedians can make fun of.  It is just focus.There is a political message in the movie as well.  Surely they are telling a story on this one.I like Edge of Darkness, not a hype movie, not a thriller in the sense of his other films, but it can be a nail biter with a few unique surprises.",5,Deeper than other Mel Gibson Roles,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,1496,"['guess', 'Mel', 'mellowing', 'age', 'slowed', 'pace', 'down', 'less', 'action', 'role', 'more', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'process', 'getting', 'what', 'Yes', 'still', 'am', 'good', 'guy', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'even', 'bad', 'guy', 'routine', 'movies', 'simply', 'moving', 'forward', 'inevitable', 'climax', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'was', 'adapted', 'Mel', 'being', 'Irish', 'decent', 'Boston', 'Irish', 'cop', 'accent', 'seeking', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'daughter', 'yelling', 'out', 'family', 'name', 'Were', 'Why', 'know', 'trailer', 'setting', 'out', 'right', 'wrong.Mel', 'serious', 'way', 'film', 'Craven', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'who', 'working', 'intern', 'company', 'not', 'know', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'turning', 'things', 'very', 'serious', 'get', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'intensity', 'usual', 'corny', 'theatrics', 'may', 'see', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Patriot', 'others', 'there', 'banter', 'clowning', 'may', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'whimsically', 'playing', 'funnier', 'role', 'not', 'what', 'about', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'Ransom', 'yet', 'are', 'one', 'give', 'back', 'son', 'comedians', 'can', 'make', 'fun', 'just', 'focus.There', 'political', 'message', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Surely', 'are', 'telling', 'story', 'one.I', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'not', 'hype', 'movie', 'not', 'thriller', 'sense', 'other', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'nail', 'biter', 'few', 'unique', 'surprises']",N/A
1241793,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B001UV4XRY,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[0, 0]","How appropriate is the title?  I think we are all beginning to realize that Mel Gibson has a slight ""Edge of Darkness"" in real life, and in his movies as well.  It has been a while since he graced the big screen and I was pleasantly surprised at his reentry.  The movie is a little drawn out at times and jumped around a too much, but Mel Gibson injected it with his usual intense dramatic flair and kept my interest throughout.  Being a father of three daughters myself, I must admit the opening scene hooked me as I watched this poor father hold his dying daughter in his arms while she lay gasping her last breath.  I really did feel his loss, it was so personal and crushing the way he held her in his arms.Thomas Craven is a detective on the Boston police force.  His daughter comes home from her top secret job to see him and never even makes it to dinner.  She gets gunned down on his doorstep as he holds her in his arms.  Everyone believes the killers were targeting Mr. Craven due to his job, but the puzzle pieces don't quite fit the all too easy synopsis.  As he begins uncovering evidence throughout the movie it becomes clear that there is far more to the story than a previously arrested criminal out for some bloody revenge.The plot follows the typical big corporations are bad and are always out to crush the little guy routine.  We have seen this in a thousand movies before and this one doesn't give us anything out of the ordinary.  It titters on the edge of being unbelievable at times with just how insane the CEO of this corporation is and how easy Thomas Crave comes by all of his discoveries.  Still, Mel Gibson proves if you give him a chance to play a character flawed with darkness he can use his own personal demons to elevate an entire movie.  He truly has a gift at playing the hero who loves the taste of blood.While most of the other characters are not really worth mentioning, I did enjoy Ray Winstone and his eerie government assassin bit.  He played it so damn well I was creeping out a little every time he came on screen.  I think if I met this dude in real life, I would actually feel the need to thank him for not killing me, just as Thomas Craven did in the movie.  Everyone else played their roles adequately, but did nothing to steal any scenes.  All of the juicy accolades were left to the two main characters, and they did more than enough to keep my attention.I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it if you like a nice dramatic movie with a little action.  It has a few violent scenes but it is more of a detective/mystery movie than an action flick.  You will have to be able to tolerate a little blood though.  Remember this is a Mel Gibson movie and as is typical he likes to see plenty of ketchup squirting in the air when a gunshot blasts through the sound speakers.Definitely worth renting but not chick flick.

I think he created the TV show from the 80's He directed Golden Eye which is a great James Bond movie I reviewed it along with Casino Royale which was ok. Stars Mad Mel Gibson as Boston Detective Thomas Craven this was Gibson's 1st movie since Signs. That was a s  h i  tt  y movie. Also stars Bonjana Mavokovic as Emma Craven Danny Houston as Jack Bennett, Ray Winestone Darius Jedburgh, Jay O. Sanders as Bill Whitehouse & Damian Young as Jim Pine. Stoty is Thomas Craven a Boston Detective is pickinb up his daughter Emma at The Air Port she is sick & we find out why she's throwing up later on there is something she's going to tell him suddenly a guy yells CRAVEN! Emma was murdered so he does his own investigation looking into where she worked he finds a gun he finds out about her boyfriend Davidhe won't talk to him but he gives him the keys to her apartment. He finds out that she was working for this place called Northmoor that manufactured nuclear weapons. They are going to send them for usage of dirty bomb. His daughter found this out after a failed break in of Northmoor by activists she was also poised with Thallium. 1 of activists contacts Craven it turns out that the head of Northmoor ordered her death. Craven himself got poised with The Thallium. Craven encounters a guy named Jedburgh he's tasked with preventing him from furthering his investigation but takes a liking to him. Jedburgh kills David though. The poisoning makes Craven sick & starts hallucanating while talking to his friend from The Boston PD Bill Whitehouse it turns out he's set up Northmoor agents come in Bill uses a tazer on him. He awakes at The Northmoor Facility he escapes goes right after Jack Bennett & the shooter I love the scene were he tells the man who killed his daughter SAY CRAVEN! He kills that guy Bennett shoots Craven but he still has it in him to pour this poisonous milk with The Thallium in it down Bennett's mouth. Bennett tries to get these pills Craven drags himself to the room & shoots Bennett in the throat. Craven later dies in the hospital Jedburgh is dying of a unrelated illness. He kills Senator Pine & his political advisors the part with Jedburgh & the cop was a little off but whatever. The ending felt a little too much like a Hallmark channel original movie it didn't kill it for me. Robert DeNiro was was originallly cast for Darius Jedburgh but dropped out due to creative differences. John Coriglino wrote the original score. It was  rejected when the reshootd called for more action. Coriglino refused to redo it so he was replaced with Howard Shore. Martin Campbell wanted to do a Edge of Darkness movie since 2002. Other than the part with Jedburgh & the cop & The Hallmark TV movie ending this is a solid movie. I'll admit I wasn't big on this movie when I 1st saw it like the movie now  so that's my review stay aroud for more movie & game reviews.",4,Could've been a comeback for Mad Mel unfortunately not so much 8.5/10,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",2011,2974,"[""'m"", 'going', 'review', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'think', 'created', 'TV', 'show', '80', 'directed', 'Golden', 'Eye', 'great', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'reviewed', 'along', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'was', 'ok.', 'Stars', 'Mad', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Boston', 'Detective', 'Thomas', 'Craven', 'was', 'Gibson', '1st', 'movie', 'Signs', 'was', 's', 'h', 'i', 'tt', 'y', 'movie', 'Also', 'Bonjana', 'Mavokovic', 'Emma', 'Craven', 'Danny', 'Houston', 'Jack', 'Bennett', 'Ray', 'Winestone', 'Darius', 'Jedburgh', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'Bill', 'Whitehouse', 'Damian', 'Young', 'Jim', 'Pine', 'Stoty', 'Thomas', 'Craven', 'Boston', 'Detective', 'pickinb', 'up', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Air', 'Port', 'sick', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'throwing', 'up', 'later', 'something', 'going', 'tell', 'suddenly', 'guy', 'CRAVEN', 'Emma', 'was', 'murdered', 'so', 'own', 'investigation', 'looking', 'where', 'worked', 'gun', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'Davidhe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'keys', 'apartment', 'out', 'was', 'working', 'place', 'called', 'Northmoor', 'manufactured', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'are', 'going', 'send', 'usage', 'dirty', 'bomb', 'daughter', 'found', 'out', 'failed', 'break', 'Northmoor', 'activists', 'was', 'also', 'poised', 'Thallium', '1', 'activists', 'contacts', 'Craven', 'out', 'head', 'Northmoor', 'ordered', 'death', 'Craven', 'got', 'poised', 'Thallium', 'Craven', 'guy', 'named', 'Jedburgh', 'tasked', 'preventing', 'furthering', 'investigation', 'liking', 'Jedburgh', 'David', 'poisoning', 'Craven', 'sick', 'hallucanating', 'talking', 'friend', 'Boston', 'PD', 'Bill', 'Whitehouse', 'out', 'set', 'up', 'Northmoor', 'agents', 'come', 'Bill', 'tazer', 'Northmoor', 'Facility', 'right', 'Jack', 'Bennett', 'shooter', 'love', 'scene', 'were', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'daughter', 'SAY', 'CRAVEN', 'guy', 'Bennett', 'shoots', 'Craven', 'still', 'pour', 'poisonous', 'milk', 'Thallium', 'down', 'Bennett', 'mouth', 'Bennett', 'get', 'pills', 'Craven', 'room', 'shoots', 'Bennett', 'throat', 'Craven', 'later', 'dies', 'hospital', 'Jedburgh', 'dying', 'unrelated', 'illness', 'Senator', 'Pine', 'political', 'advisors', 'part', 'Jedburgh', 'cop', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'ending', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'original', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'was', 'was', 'originallly', 'cast', 'Darius', 'Jedburgh', 'dropped', 'out', 'due', 'creative', 'differences', 'John', 'Coriglino', 'wrote', 'original', 'score', 'was', 'rejected', 'when', 'reshootd', 'called', 'more', 'action', 'Coriglino', 'refused', 'redo', 'so', 'was', 'replaced', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'wanted', 'do', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'movie', '2002', 'Other', 'part', 'Jedburgh', 'cop', 'Hallmark', 'TV', 'movie', 'ending', 'solid', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'movie', 'when', '1st', 'saw', 'movie', 'now', 'review', 'stay', 'aroud', 'more', 'movie', 'game', 'reviews']",N/A

I first saw Edge of Darkness on HBO. I had never heard of the film and had not seen a Mel Gibson movie since the brilliant Braveheart. I was immediately drawn into the film, which is a whodunnit. Gibson portrays a Boston police detective, whose daughter was shot in front of his home by an unknown assailant as the two of them walk out the door. I will avoid further spoilers by saying that because he's a police detective, Gibson's character pursues an investigation of his daughter's murder on his own. Was the killer trying to kill him as the Boston PD suspects? Was it someone he had once arrested seeking revenge? Or, was his daughter the target? The remainder of the film is exciting, thought provoking and brings in a number of interesting characters, which deepens the mystery. Frankly, this film is far better than I expected.

1241796,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B001UV4XRY,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 2]","When I clicked on the movie title, ""Edge of Darkness,"" I was prepared to find negative reviews--you know, because of Mel Gibson's private behavior in public places. In fact, I seem to be one of only a very few people who bring that topic to the table. Excellent! A creative artist should be judged by the merits of his work, not his life (unless that something is heinous).So, ""Edge of Darkness""--the title clues the viewer at the onset what direction the film will take. The question becomes: What darkness? Which edge of that darkness? The blurbs in the advertisement campaign tell us that Gibson's character, Tom Craven, will arrest no one, with the obvious omission that he will kill his daughter's murderer. That darkness, the one in which a policeman allows a murderous and vengeful heart to dominate, is this the darkness?Step closer. The darkness of a governmental conspiracy theory? Who is involved? For what purpose? This is darkness, indeed! Closer, please. The darkness of whistle blowing, not the act itself, but the resulting consequences, legal and illegal. Now, all the way to the edge...the darkness of an absolute and abject fear caused by ... Ah, you thought I would give a spoiler, eh? In fact, all of these things are hinted and suggested in televised preview blips, making the viewer aware early on just what darkness is being investigated and played out on the big screen.So it's not the darkness--except for that final ring that is the centerpoint of this well-written, well-acted film, but the journey there, the story of a man who loses a daughter he barely knows and his efforts to learn why she had to die. Each discovery takes him closer and closer to that final darkness which he will experience first-hand. Each revelation in this tightly wrapped mystery is a bit more shocking than the one before. I found this story gripping, partly because of the darkness theme, but more because of Gibson's painful portrayal of a man who loses his only child just at the moment he will actually get to know her. The scene at the beach with its flashback and Craven's purpose there had me quietly sobbing.There are just so many surprising moments like the beach scene which, technically, should have slowed the momentum of the film but actually subtly intensifies it. I very much like such films which involve the viewer in so many expected scenes--shootings, for example, car chases, but also very unexpected ones like the Cleaner cleaning and the shock of that scene's conclusion.The film's conclusion itself is unexpected, or at least was for me. Overall ""Edge of Darkness"" is just that: edgy and dark, and an excellent reason why we celebrate films and film-making, actors and acting.The four-star rating does deserve an explanation. I had the volume of my big-screen unit at two notches below its highest level and STILL had trouble understanding everything being said. Didn't someone in production watch the movie and check for such things? I was annoyed enough to subtract one star from my rating. That's a shame!As a final note--and a positive one--""Edge of Darkness"" rates a highly recommended status from this viewer. And Mel Gibson has clearly put himself into the ace acting category with this thoughtful, controlled performance. This is a film I will see again.",4,Which edge?

Yet, the further he digs into the murder, the more surprising his discoveries become as a twisted web of intrigue, money and political power begins to unwind and not everything is what it seemed.The film, based on a six episode 1985 BBC mini-series of the same name, features a story written by screenwriters William Monahan (""The Departed"") and Andrew Bovell (""Lantana""). The story's plot is rife with intensity and drama as Thomas Craven must attempt to uncover the mystery of who is responsible for this tragedy, all the while dealing with such a profound loss. As if that weren't enough the writers toss into the mix a hefty dosage of political intrigue, conspiracies, and a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. It's not hard to imagine that a possible mantra for the writers when developing the story was, ""No rest for the weary.""There are some writers, and even directors, that would have their hands full just dealing with the two main plot threads alone. Truth be told, those two plots would have made for an incredibly intriguing, dramatic movie on their own. Yet, with the deftly woven layers and intricate sub-plots included within the story, the film packs an even greater punch and leaves you with a much more powerful movie experience.With so much happening in a single story, we've seen time and again where a movie simply crumbles beneath its own weight. While the writers did their part in creating an elaborate, yet cohesive mixture of plotlines, director Martin Campbell (""Casino Royale"") still had to guide the movie into becoming a reality. Being no stranger to action movies, Martin Campbell was an ideal choice for director. Not to mention he was already familiar to some extent with the material having directed all six of the episodes that comprised the BBC mini-series all those years ago. On top of all that, this is also the man that reinvigorated the James Bond franchise a couple of years back, so who better to bring Mel Gibson back to the big screen?Martin's ability to mix hard-hitting, gritty action sequences into this movie that never overshadow the intense drama unfolding is one of the reasons he has become (in my opinion) one of the best action directors around. So many action thrillers lose sight of the story as the driving force and allow the action to propel the film forward, especially during its final moments (case in point, Tony Scott's overblown ""Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" remake). Martin's movies typically don't suffer from this shortcoming; instead, he allows the story to unfold, and then inserts action into the proceedings. You see, the key is to not forget the action scenes, but to include them in a way that doesn't feel unnatural to the story (take note Tony Scott, you used to know how to do this). Anyways, I digress.Headlining the cast, as I already stated, is none other than Mel Gibson (""Braveheart""). An actor that despite his absence in front of the camera, still remains one of the most talented stars in Hollywood (as showcased in this film). After being away from the spotlight for so long, this type of movie was the perfect way for Mel to make his return. After all, not too many actors do action thrillers/revenge movies as well as Mel (see ""Ransom"" for a prime example). As Thomas Craven, Mel goes through a wide range of feelings and emotions from incredible sadness and denial to bewilderment, from anger to an all-consuming thirst for revenge against those responsible. All the while, Mel keeps Thomas grounded, never once over-selling the character's heartache or rage; a choice that was key to keeping him completely believable and relatable to the audience.At the heart of the conspiracy within the movie is actor Danny Huston (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"") who appears so completely earnest and sincere one second, yet at a moments notice shows himself to be a twisted, morally compromised individual who would do anything to protect his interests. I've seen several movies that Danny has appeared in, and every time he always delivers a great performance. Out of all the roles I've seen him play, he seems to excel even more when playing the antagonist and this one is no exception. His performance in this film is so rich that he easily stands toe-to-toe with Mel's Thomas Craven, thus making their scenes together all the more intense and enjoyable to watch.Lastly, is actor Ray Winstone (""The Departed"") as a shadowy government operative, whose job is to prevent people from discovering the truth in sensitive matters. Sadly his character only pops up every once in a while; even so, Ray makes the most out of every single moment, skillfully creating such a complex and layered portrayal. His scenes opposite Mel are quite simply the best in the film, and their verbal sparring is so rich with intensity, veiled threats, and above all, respect that you're almost sorry when they end. While Ray's not one of the most well-known actors in Hollywood, he is one that you can always rely upon to deliver a solid performance no matter the size of the role.To sum up, ""Edge of Darkness"" features a terrific screenplay, top-notch performances, and incredibly hard-hitting and gritty action scenes, making it a thriller that will grab hold and not let go until the very end.""Edge of Darkness"" is rated R for violence and language.",5,Some Mysteries Can Push You to the Edge...,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,6231,"['eight', 'year', 'absence', 'starring', 'major', 'Hollywood',

The story opens in Boston.  As we admire the beautiful scenery of a winding river and the fall foliage, 3 bodies pop up floating!  We jump to a warmer scene, as single dad Mel Gibson (Tommy Craven) reminisces, watching home movies of his daughter playing on the beach in 1990 as a child.  Emma is all grown up now, and has moved away from home.Tommy meets Emma at the train station as she comes home for a visit, but he soon finds that she is not well.  Shortly after and still in the very beginnings of the film, 24-year old Emma is killed by a drive-by shooter, screaming ""Craven""!Since Tommy is an active police detective, his department assumes that he has made enemies somewhere and they were after him, but Tommy cannot think of anyone who might want to kill him.  Through a series of investigatory analysis work, Tommy begins to look into Emma's background, revealing her work at Northmoor, a nuclear plant with national security ties to the government.  Emma worked in the research department of a company dealing with nuclear fusion and stockpiles.  As Tommy, with the help of his police department, begins to track down Emma's friends and ask questions, he learns some very interesting things.This movie is excellent and I would most certainly watch it again.

On-screen, he is still the same cool, disenchanted hard-ass we came to love him as in the 90's with such bleak gems as Brian Hedgeland's superb modern noir Payback. Edge of Darkness is Mel operating in familiar territory. The story, based on a condensed version of a BBC miniseries, feels like something we have seen a few times before. It is a standard revenge/conspiracy film with a bleak veneer and a particularly talky script by Departed scribe William Monahan. The film details a shady nuclear research facility that might, in fact, be an arms dealer financing shady dealings overseas. At the head of the corporate ladder is a man so coy and conniving, even an audience member not particularly well-versed in this sort of mysterious criminal world will have him pegged as the antagonist almost instantly. It doesn't help that he asks grief-stricken Gibson how the pain feels, and stares him down with an icy gaze that mars the clean, well-lit office around him. There is not a lot of texture to the plot line. So much as others have championed its labyrinthian intriguing elements, this is no Maltese Falcon. Mel basically runs around with increasingly depleting stamina, questioning witnesses and beating up bad guys. There is a parallel storyline with Ray Winstone in an excellent, if underwritten role, as a hitman whose story would probably be more interesting that Mel's, as he seems higher up in the food chain of corruption, and whose climactic showdown is perhaps the only really memorable scene in the movie...apart from a smashing car accident that has been done so many times I can't count them, particularly in horror films like Final Destination I. Ultimately, the film is rather turgid and less than a sum of its parts. There is not enough action to qualify it as a potboiler like Payback, which had a lot of shoot-outs and the like, or enough enigmatic villains (the lame Gregg Clark shows up in his signature type-cast role as a nameless suit...ho hum- get another actor for these roles!!! The man is vapid and weak. Did you see his interpretation of Palahniuk's seminal Choke? Criminal. But I digress) to qualify as an intelligent conspiracy theory film like...well Mel's early 90's Conspiracy Theory. I really wanted to like this movie, despite its star's relentless attempts to destroy himself publicly. Alas, it was just more of the same. Mel should stick with directing, I suppose.

Craven's solitary search for answers about his daughter's death transforms into an odyssey of emotional discovery and redemption.The cast led by Mel Gibson (in an excellent performance as Thomas Craven) is excellent!

Swanson,"[0, 0]","3.4 starsWell made, with a good score by Shore and solid lead from Gibson, EOD is nonetheless merely decent, with nothing to really praise it for apart from competency. The basic idea is interesting, from an old BBC tv series, but too much is jammed into too little space here, and as the deaths pile up it all gets more and more inane. The basic idea is certainly well worth considering, and probably a lot closer to the truth than many viewers will want to admit.After a while the violence grates, the revenge factor is leaned on too heavily, and it feels like there's no real soul to any of this. Winstone is good as yet another cynical old pro, but when everyone in the movie is a cynical old pro, there's not much light to contrast the dark. This film is well past the edge of darkness and heading for the heart, and there's no fun of any sort to make it much worth watching, or worthwhile thoughts about bigger issues to make it worth pondering.Which is too bad, as the basic concept opens onto so many fascinating avenues and could have been examined so much more intelligently.",3,A little too much darkness and not enough light,1273968000,"05 16, 2010",2010,1085,"['3.4', 'starsWell', 'made', 'good', 'score', 'Shore', 'solid', 'lead', 'Gibson', 'EOD', 'nonetheless', 'merely', 'decent', 'nothing', 'really', 'praise', 'apart', 'competency', 'basic', 'idea', 'interesting', 'old', 'BBC', 'tv', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'jammed', 'too', 'little', 'space', 'here', 'deaths', 'more', 'more', 'inane', 'basic', 'idea', 'certainly', 'well', 'worth', 'considering', 'probably', 'lot', 'closer', 'truth', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'want', 'admit.After', 'while', 'violence', 'grates', 'revenge', 'factor', 'leaned', 'too', 'heavily', 'real', 'soul', 'Winstone', 'good', 'yet', 'cynical', 'old', 'pro', 'when', 'everyone', 'movie', 'cynical', 'old', 'pro', 'not', 'much', 'light', 'contrast', 'dark', 'film', 'well', 'edge', 'darkness', 'heading', 'heart', 'fun', 'sort', 'make', 'much', 'watching', 'worthwhile', 'thoughts', 'bigger', 'issues', 'make', 'worth', 'pondering.Which', 'too', 'bad', 'basic', 'concept', 'so', 'many', 'fascinating', 'avenues', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'examined', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'intelligently']",N/A

1241808,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B001UV4XRY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","Rugged cop Thomas Craven (Mel Gibson) is spending some quality catch-up time at his house with his daughter, Emma (Bojana Novakovic), who is suddenly coughing up blood.  As he rushes her out the front door to the hospital a shadowy figure yells out ""Craven!"" and empties a shotgun blast into Emma.  Before she dies, Emma says she has something to tell her father and the obvious assumption that it was the cop who was the target starts falling apart quite early in the investigation.  Emma works for a mega-company named Northmoor (the name alone should tell you this is anEngulf and Devoursort of evil corporation), which means there is the attendant corporate and political intrigue covering up deaths and dirty secrets in the name of profits and power.  Craven has to butt his head up against a series of walls shielding him from the truth until Ray Winstone's Jedburgh arrives upon the scene.  He is a shadowy figure more in the tradition of ""Deep Throat"" than Basil Exposition, to fill in a few key details for Craven and offer some friendly advice tempered with a giant flashing neon warning sign.  But our grieving hero is now the proverbial man with nothing left to lose.  As he works the chain of evidence back to the people who shot his daughter and ordered the hit, Craven continues to talk to and sometimes see, his daughter.  At one point he even tells her, ""I'm sorry you had to see that, honey.""Once again we have an American cinematic remake of aBritish television mini-series, attempting to follow in the somewhat grand tradition of ""Traffic"" and ""State of Play,"" which is certainly a more worthwhile approach than recycling less than stellar American television programs into, more often than not, buffoonish movies from ""The A-Team"" to however far you can make it down an alphabetical listing of such tripe.  Director Martin Campbell also directed the original BBC version as well as both the recent James Bond reboot in ""Casino Royale"" and an earlier 007 film, ""GoldenEye.""  However, Campbell does not engage in the same sort of action set pieces that are the staple of the Bond films, relying instead on short bursts of violent action, much more appropriate to this particular story.  Like many others, I have no interest in having Mel Gibson over for dinner, especially if he has been drinking, but in this first major role in front of the camera since ""Signs"" he once again shows that he is a compelling figure on screen.  It helps that his obvious love for his daughter and our immediate identification with both the grief of his character and the inevitable quest for vengeance put us squarely on his side.  Add to the equation that Gibson is not playing the wisecrackingMartin Riggsor any variation thereof, because there is little humor to be found in this film given the grim nature of both the circumstances and the character.Winstone's performance provides another level of gravitas to the proceedings, especially in contrast to the corporate bad guys and their hirelings, all of whom reek of an arrogance that makes you seriously doubt their abilities to be successful at their jobs, whether it be nefarious business dealings or taking out one grieving cop with a hand gun.  Ironically, there is a sense in which ""Edge of Darkness"" becomes another ""buddy movie.""  Still, there is a certain elegance to this film, which eschews a lot of the trappings that weigh down contemporary action films in favor of having Craven proceed straight ahead in his pursuit of justice.  In the end, what makes this film less than satisfying in the end is that it requires a little deus ex machina intervention to allow Craven his shot at the bad guys.  On the one hand I appreciate that in the ""real world,"" it will take a lot more than a mere mortal to have a chance to bring down Northmoor, but there needs to be more than plot requirements to provide the necessary motivation.  That being said, I liked Craven's use of the carton of milk and the grace note this 2010 film offers before fading to black.",4,You are not going to kill Mel Gibson's daughter and get away with it,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,4018,"['Rugged', 'cop', 'Thomas', 'Craven', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'spending', 'quality', 'catch-up', 'time', 'house', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'Bojana', 'Novakovic', 'who', 'suddenly', 'coughing', 'up', 'blood', 'out', 'front', 'door', 'hospital', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'out', 'Craven', 'shotgun', 'blast', 'Emma', 'Emma', 'something', 'tell', 'father', 'obvious', 'assumption', 'was', 'cop', 'who', 'was', 'target', 'falling', 'apart', 'quite', 'early', 'investigation', 'Emma', 'mega-company', 'named', 'Northmoor', 'name', 'alone', 'should', 'tell', 'anEngulf', 'Devoursort', 'evil', 'corporation', 'attendant', 'corporate', 'political', 'intrigue', 'covering', 'up', 'deaths', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'name', 'profits', 'power', 'Craven', 'butt', 'head', 'up', 'series', 'walls', 'shielding', 'truth', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Jedburgh', 'scene', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'more', 'tradition', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Basil', 'Exposition', 'fill', 'few', 'key', 'details', 'Craven', 'offer', 'friendly', 'advice', 'tempered', 'giant', 'flashing', 'neon', 'warning', 'sign', 'grieving', 'hero', 'now', 'proverbial', 'man', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'chain', 'evidence', 'back', 'people', 'who', 'shot', 'daughter', 'ordered', 'hit', 'Craven', 'talk', 'sometimes', 'see', 'daughter', 'one', 'point', 'even', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'had', 'see', 'honey', 'Once', 'again', 'have', 'American', 'cinematic', 'remake', 'aBritish', 'television', 'mini-series', 'attempting', 'follow', 'somewhat', 'grand', 'tradition', 'Traffic', 'State', 'Play', 'certainly', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'approach', 'recycling', 'less', 'stellar', 'American', 'television', 'programs', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'buffoonish', 'movies', 'A-Team', 'however', 'far', 'can', 'make', 'down', 'alphabetical', 'listing', 'such', 'tripe', 'Director', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'also', 'directed', 'original', 'BBC', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'recent', 'James', 'Bond', 'reboot', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'earlier', '007', 'film', 'GoldenEye', 'However', 'Campbell', 'not', 'engage', 'same', 'sort', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'staple', 'Bond', 'films', 'relying', 'instead', 'short', 'bursts', 'violent', 'action', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate', 'particular', 'story', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'interest', 'having', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'dinner', 'especially', 'been', 'drinking', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'front', 'camera', 'Signs', 'once', 'again', 'compelling', 'figure', 'screen', 'obvious', 'love', 'daughter', 'immediate', 'identification', 'grief', 'character', 'inevitable', 'quest', 'vengeance', 'put', 'squarely', 'side', 'Add', 'equation', 'Gibson', 'not', 'playing', 'wisecrackingMartin', 'Riggsor', 'variation', 'thereof', 'little', 'humor', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'given', 'grim', 'nature', 'circumstances', 'character.Winstone', 'performance', 'level', 'gravitas', 'proceedings', 'especially', 'contrast', 'corporate', 'bad', 'guys', 'hirelings', 'whom', 'reek', 'arrogance', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'abilities', 'be', 'successful', 'jobs', 'be', 'nefarious', 'business', 'dealings', 'taking', 'out', 'one', 'grieving', 'cop', 'hand', 'gun', 'Ironically', 'sense', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'buddy', 'movie', 'Still', 'certain', 'elegance', 'film', 'lot', 'trappings', 'weigh', 'down', 'contemporary', 'action', 'films', 'favor', 'having', 'Craven', 'proceed', 'straight', 'ahead', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'end', 'what', 'film', 'less', 'satisfying', 'end', 'little', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'intervention', 'allow', 'Craven', 'shot', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'hand', 'appreciate', 'real', 'world', 'will', 'take', 'lot', 'more', 'mere', 'mortal', 'have', 'chance', 'bring', 'down', 'Northmoor', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'plot', 'requirements', 'provide', 'necessary', 'motivation', 'being', 'said', 'liked', 'Craven', 'use', 'carton', 'milk', 'grace', 'note', '2010', 'film', 'offers', 'fading', 'black']",N/A

Sceptical of whether this Australian actor could pull off this character, and have the chops to do Shakespeare, my preconceptions were laid to rest by his excellent performance. Everyone touched by the taint of Hamlet died, as did Hamlet.In Edge of Darkness, the inciting incident is not the death of the father, but the death of the only child, and we explore vicariously what happens as we look through the lens of Detective Craven's grief, we wonder what he will do next, to what lengths he will go, will he be able to control his emotions or will he lose control entirely, and cross the line.  Will he survive, or will the forces of adversity win?Memories flicker through his mind and reenact themselves onscreen as he attempts to reconcile the images of the daughter he knew with the developing picture of the daughter he lost.  As he searches for answers, the body count starts to mount, and danger lurks at every turn.His face perfectly expresses his inner anguish and torment, and Gibson gives a superb performance, as he teeters on the edge of darkness.We have not seen him in a starring role for six years, although he has directed theThe Passion of the Christ (Full Screen Edition), a mega box office success, andMel Gibson's Apocalypto (Widescreen Edition), an outstanding achievement in directing, one of my favorite Gibson movies, but not for the squeamish.Point of interest, EOD also stars Danny Huston, son of Director John, and brother of Angelica. He plays the daughter's boss.Edge of Darkness is an excellent thriller, and scored $17 million on its opening weekend, which at $10 a ticket means that 1.7 million people have already seen this movie.

1241825,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B001UV4XRY,"MK ""Hussar""","[1, 2]","One of the more over-used expressions in the English language could be that one has ""nothing to lose.""  Used flippantly in television, movies, news broadcasts, and books, most people employ the phrase as an explanation for the heinous acts of another.  How many of us, one wonders, truly understand what someone who has ""nothing to lose"" is capable of?  What is necessary to reach the state where preservation of life becomes secondary?  Martin Campbell (director, ""Casino Royale""), attempts to answers these and other questions in ""Edge of Darkness.""Mel Gibson (""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Ransom"") plays detective Craven, a lonely man who only has his job and his daughter, Emma, to keep meaning in his life.  On a rare visit home to her father's house, Emma suddenly grows ill and panics, prompting Craven to rush her outside in order to transport her to medical attention.  This plan falls apart when masked men waiting near his front porch shout ""Craven!"" and end Emma's life with a blast from a shotgun.  After a whirlwind of police inquiries, media attention, and public sympathy, the grieving father makes several disturbing discoveries regarding his daughter's life--discoveries which bring into doubt the official suspicion that Emma was the accidental target of a hit on Craven.The main fuel of this movie--that of Thomas Craven's love for his daughter and thirst for vengeance--worked quite well all told, especially considering Emma is only alive for the first ten or so minutes of the movie.  An opening sequence of video clips of father and daughter on the beach, combined with flashbacks/hallucinations later in the film, quite effectively convey the bond between the two, and make more believable Craven's determination.  However, the believability of the conspiracy portion of the movie felt lacking in several places, as I will explain below.*spoilers*I could not get over the fact that a private company, manufacturing classified weapons under contract for the U.S. government and with enough funding to provide ""generous"" insurance packages for even its entry-level employees, would allow one detective to discover and seriously gum up its bottom line with his meddling.  Thomas Craven basically runs around doing whatever he wants in the movie--maybe art mimics life?  Another example:  Craven was captured and taken to the Northmoor compound for unknown purposes, and then he manages to subdue two employees and escape back to his home.  It felt like the classic ""Bond capture"" scene, without the evil ""domination"" speech and ugly cat.  Ray Winstone, who plays the ""cleaning"" (i.e., wet work) contractor Jedburgh, decides not to kill Craven despite many chances because he feels a convenient affinity for the detective secondary to his own, developing, personal tragedy.  Last, Jack Bennett, CEO of Northmoor and one of two main foozles in this movie, is directly threatened by Craven, yet doesn't order his death until much later in the film.There are issues besides the ineptness of the bad guys.  The underlying conspiracy involves the clandestine manufacture of ""dirty"" nuclear weapons--being intentionally designed to appear foreign made--by Northmoor, under the auspices of a ruthless senator.  It is sufficiently mysterious and multilayered, but portions appear confusing, underdeveloped, and/or heavily edited.  The ecoterrorist group subplot is never really fleshed out and feels like a stub.  Many questions seemed unanswered or not dealt with fully by movie's end, but perhaps that is because I had some difficulty understanding Winstone's accent--his character was unfortunately responsible for much of the exposition.  Gibson fiddling with a Geiger counter was unintentionally funny, and the point of the irradiated milk was a bit of a question--perhaps Emma shops in the supermarkets of Germany?*end spoilers*The acting--primarily that of Mel Gibson, Ray Winstone, and Danny Huston--was very good.  I especially enjoyed the interaction between Craven and Jedburgh--more than a few flashes from the Pacino/de Niro scenes from ""Heat"" shot to my brain.  Although perhaps inconsistent with what might happen in reality between a hitman and his mark, Jedburgh identifying with Craven's loss was intriguing.  There were fewer action scenes than I expected, but the ones that were there were quite gripping and held attention; furthermore, the ghost of detective Riggs flashed across Gibson's features several times when he was needed.  The editing was well-done and didn't induce much eyestrain.  The suspense needs a lot of work--the story just appeared too fragmented to carry the rhythm that one needs to feel suspense.The overall quality of acting, the convincing portrayal of love of a father for his daughter, and Craven's subsequent descent into near-madness and desperation in his search for answers make this movie worth watching.  This is a five-star drama, a three-star thriller, and a two-star conspiracy movie--a little more or a little less film may have done the trick to elevate this one to classic status.  As it stands it is a flawed, but still enjoyable, diversion for a lazy Saturday evening or two.",3,"Mel trims down the sharp ""Edge"" from ""Taken""",1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,5140,"['One',

As long as he keeps making good movies in front and behind the camera, I'll keep showing up. He hasn't acted in 8 years and his presence on screen is strong and captivating from the opening to the closing credits. He now sports a bald spot with pride, along with some major age lines running amok along his face. Very few actors can bring the raw intensity this guy possesses and still manage to show an emotional side, often with tears just waiting for release from his eyes. Ray Winstone has always been a fine actor and he's quite a force of nature on screen. He's very subtle and sometimes mumbles a little too much for me, but there's something about him that demands the viewer's attention. Danny Huston plays his typical slimebag self, but this may be his most vile role yet. I never saw the original BBC miniseries directed by the same guy, Casino Royale's Martin Campbell, so even though there were similarities to other films, this story was fresh to me. It went in two totally different directions that connect more and more as it goes along. You have the revenge portion and the corporate/government coverup. This almost could have been made into two seperate movies, but that's what makes Edge of Darkness a step up from the usual Death Wish type fare. It might be a little slow paced for those looking for something along the lines of Taken, but the realistic and often brutal action scenes will jolt you awake if you happen to be nodding off. Edge of Darkness is a nice welcome back vehicle for Gibson. The movie itself is somewhere in the middle of his body of work in terms of quality, but his performance speaks the need for this man to not only direct, but to be on the screen for all who are willing to see.",4,"Like it or not, Mel is back and as good as ever",1265328000,"02 5, 2010",2010,1792,"['do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'off-screen', 'antics', 'As', 'long', 'making', 'good', 'movies', 'front', 'camera', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'showing', 'up', ""n't"", 'acted', '8', 'years', 'presence', 'screen', 'strong', 'captivating', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'now', 'sports', 'bald', 'spot', 'pride', 'major', 'age', 'lines', 'running', 'amok', 'face', 'Very', 'few', 'actors', 'can', 'bring', 'raw', 'intensity', 'guy', 'still', 'manage', 'show', 'emotional', 'side', 'often', 'tears', 'just', 'waiting', 'release', 'eyes', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'always', 'been', 'fine', 'actor', 'quite', 'force', 'nature', 'screen', 'very', 'subtle', 'mumbles', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'something', 'viewer', 'attention', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'typical', 'slimebag', 'self', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'vile', 'role', 'yet', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'directed', 'same', 'guy', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'Martin', 'Campbell', 'so', 'even', 'were', 'similarities', 'other', 'films', 'story', 'was', 'fresh', 'went', 'two', 'totally', 'different', 'directions', 'connect', 'more', 'more', 'along', 'have', 'revenge', 'portion', 'corporate/government', 'coverup', 'almost', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'two', 'seperate', 'movies', 'what', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'step', 'up', 'usual', 'Death', 'Wish', 'type', 'fare', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'paced', 'looking', 'something', 'lines', 'Taken', 'realistic', 'often', 'brutal', 'action', 'scenes', 'will', 'jolt', 'awake', 'happen', 'be', 'nodding', 'off', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'nice', 'welcome', 'back', 'vehicle', 'Gibson', 'movie', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'body', 'work', 'terms', 'quality', 'performance', 'need', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'direct', 'be', 'screen', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'see']",N/A

Mel Gibson has (to my recollection) never dissappointed me with a movie that at least didn't hold my interest.  So for 4 bucks I had to give it a shot.  I can't say I wasted my money, but it's not the best 2 hours I have ever spent either.The plot was very contrived in my opinion, with the political, social, and corporate corruption.  It has all of the elements of the Bourne trilogy, but it's just not as fun or as believable.  Political coverups (I am sure) happen, but the one in this movie really stretch believability, even in a movie.And that isn't my real problem.  Plot is important, but if I am to be able to follow the plot, I have to understand (and hear) the dialogue.  (I have a great sound system, so it was not the problem).  So many times I had to rewind and ask my wife, ""What did he say?""  And it wasn't just because Ray of Winestone's heavy accent, Mel Gibson's speech was often mumbled and muted in my opinion .  (Note:  Ray Winestone is an awesome actor, but English subtitles on in whatever movie he is in is suggested for us California folks).Some surprising moments and some good action sequences did keep it at least interesting enough to keep it on.

Like most Gibson films - even the ones he doesn't direct - it's so melodramatic and emotionally lurid that you're either captured by the mood or you sit outside of it, startled by the absurdity.Mix ""Taken"" with the cynicism and dark wit of ""The Departed"" and you have this film; Baby Boomers may like it because all of the twentysomethings in the movie are idiots and pawns - which is roughly where Boomers like twentysomethings to remain - while it champions blarney like righteous vengeance and booze in the afternoon. I appreciated it for the big-eared Senator in a track suit.Mousy scientist Emma Craven (Bojana Novakovic, a cute Serb with bangs) harbors some secret about the shadowy weapons company she interns at; before she can tell her Boston cop dad Thomas (Gibson) about it, a masked gunman pumps a couple barrels into her chest on Tom's doorstep. Cue Gibson staring into space as a sign of rage, and ""hey, it's that guy!"" Jay O. Sanders showing up as Tom's chummy chief.Ray Winstone co-stars as a world-weary Somebody Hired By Someone named Jedburgh to follow Craven around while he knocks on the doors of Emma's freaked-out boyfriend and best friend, who employ 20-cent accents and conduct themselves as if they'd just sucked hard on a meth pipe.Jedburgh smokes cigars and sips champagne lunches on park benches, aristocratic villains (Danny Huston and Damian Young) smell of malfeasance and faint homosexuality, and Gibson stalks around in his moralistic, legalistic manner, invoking, at one point, the crucifixion of Jesus. The meaning of life is frequently discussed by the elders; the lines of dialogue have been shorn like a dog in summer so that you have no earthly clue what Craven and Jedburgh are really talking about. At the end we are essentially told Craven is ""saved"" for his actions, which, given the events of ""Edge of Darkness,"" is among the most pharisaical interpretations of the gospel I can imagine, right up there with Denzel Washington's body count in ""Man On Fire.""",3,A grief pizza loaded with blarney and vengeance,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,2264,"['Edge', 'Darkness', 'Boston', 'passion', 'play', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'whole', 'grief', 'pizza', 'loaded', 'paternal', 'rage', 'extra', 'cheese', 'bunch', 'nerve-jangled', 'Chowdahs', 'finally', 'snarling', 'corporate', 'villains', 'away', 'big', 'loud', 'gun', 'most', 'Gibson', 'films', 'even', 'ones', ""n't"", 'direct', 'so', 'melodramatic', 'emotionally', 'lurid', ""'re"", 'captured', 'mood', 'sit', 'startled', 'absurdity.Mix', 'Taken', 'cynicism', 'dark', 'wit', 'Departed', 'have', 'film', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'may', 'like', 'twentysomethings', 'movie', 'are', 'idiots', 'pawns', 'roughly', 'where', 'Boomers', 'twentysomethings', 'remain', 'blarney', 'righteous', 'vengeance', 'booze', 'afternoon', 'appreciated', 'big-eared', 'Senator', 'track', 'suit.Mousy', 'scientist', 'Emma', 'Craven', 'Bojana', 'Novakovic', 'cute', 'Serb', 'bangs', 'harbors', 'secret', 'shadowy', 'weapons', 'company', 'can', 'tell', 'Boston', 'cop', 'dad', 'Thomas', 'Gibson', 'masked', 'gunman', 'couple', 'barrels', 'chest', 'Tom', 'doorstep', 'Cue', 'Gibson', 'staring', 'space', 'sign', 'rage', 'hey', 'guy', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'showing', 'up', 'Tom', 'chummy', 'chief.Ray', 'Winstone', 'co-stars', 'world-weary', 'Somebody', 'Hired', 'Someone', 'named', 'Jedburgh', 'follow', 'Craven', 'doors', 'Emma', 'freaked-out', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'employ', '20-cent', 'accents', 'conduct', ""'d"", 'just', 'sucked', 'hard', 'meth', 'pipe.Jedburgh', 'smokes', 'cigars', 'sips', 'champagne', 'lunches', 'park', 'benches', 'aristocratic', 'villains', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'Damian', 'Young', 'smell', 'malfeasance', 'faint', 'homosexuality', 'Gibson', 'stalks', 'moralistic', 'legalistic', 'manner', 'invoking', 'one', 'point', 'crucifixion', 'Jesus', 'meaning', 'life', 'frequently', 'discussed', 'elders', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'have', 'been', 'shorn', 'dog', 'summer', 'have', 'earthly', 'clue', 'what', 'Craven', 'Jedburgh', 'are', 'really', 'talking', 'end', 'are', 'essentially', 'told', 'Craven', 'saved', 'actions', 'given', 'events', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'most', 'pharisaical', 'interpretations', 'gospel', 'can', 'imagine', 'right', 'there', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'body', 'count', 'Man', 'Fire']",N/A

In several scenes he is deliberately paired standing next to actors who are very tall, which shows how small Gibson is and seems to emphasize how he's an ordinary man caught up in events.Contrasting with Craven is Darius Jedburgh, a Black Ops hitman who begins to question his purpose, and should have been a much bigger part of the plot.Things jump the shark somewhat at about the three quarters mark as the film makers ran out of ideas and went into action movie mode.

1241863,A2OEYJHD2KTPJ1,B001UV4XRY,southasia,"[12, 13]","Mel Gibson plays Tom Craven, a Boston police detective in this brilliant (and topical) political thriller. This movie is like a sock turned inside out from the original BBC production. In the original, it's a British detective who solves the mystery of his daughter's death with the assistance of an American agent, played quite ably by Joe Don Baker. This one exhibits an American police officer and an emotionally complicated British agent (Ray Winstone).Of the two, I find the Mel Gibson one to be much better. That probably shows my American bias, but the original was a 6 hour miniseries. I can't watch cricket either. I also encourage everyone to watch the original. The complicated relationship between Baker and Peck gives us a deeper insight into the human condition, asking the question ""What is right?"" Both characters have deep cultural bonds, and both carry out their actions for different reasons. One for simple revenge, the other becomes a dangerous idealist. The ending to the original is slightly different, much more poignant.Both have similiarities in story line, though the American cop has many more action-oriented scenes than the original. Mel Gibson gives us a stunning and brilliant portrayal throughout the film. His Boston accent is perfect, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job, particularly the witty yet sparse banter between Gibson and Ray Winstone. Unlike the original, however, there's not much time to show how their relationship changes both of them, the American and the Brit, the agent and the policeman. I enjoyed the end scene with Ray Winstone. It's surprising. But both films offer wonderful scenes of the main character having conversations with his dead daughter, sometimes tender, sometimes conflicting.I put this movie on the same level as almost all of Mel Gibson's work: well worth watching.",5,"Gibson is back, better than ever",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,1847,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'Tom', 'Craven', 'Boston', 'police', 'detective', 'brilliant', 'topical', 'political', 'thriller', 'movie', 'sock', 'turned', 'inside', 'original', 'BBC', 'production', 'original', 'British', 'detective', 'who', 'mystery', 'daughter', 'death', 'assistance', 'American', 'agent', 'played', 'quite', 'ably', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'one', 'American', 'police', 'officer', 'emotionally', 'complicated', 'British', 'agent', 'Ray', 'Winstone', '.Of', 'two', 'find', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'one', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'probably', 'American', 'bias', 'original', 'was', '6', 'hour', 'miniseries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'cricket', 'also', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'watch', 'original', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'Baker', 'Peck', 'deeper', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'asking', 'question', 'What', 'right', 'characters', 'have', 'deep', 'cultural', 'bonds', 'carry', 'out', 'actions', 'different', 'reasons', 'One', 'simple', 'revenge', 'other', 'dangerous', 'idealist', 'ending', 'original', 'slightly', 'different', 'much', 'more', 'poignant.Both', 'have', 'similiarities', 'story', 'line', 'American', 'cop', 'many', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'scenes', 'original', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'stunning', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'film', 'Boston', 'accent', 'perfect', 'supporting', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'job', 'particularly', 'witty', 'yet', 'sparse', 'banter', 'Gibson', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'original', 'however', 'not', 'much', 'time', 'show', 'how', 'relationship', 'changes', 'American', 'Brit', 'agent', 'policeman', 'enjoyed', 'end', 'scene', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'surprising', 'films', 'offer', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'having', 'conversations', 'dead', 'daughter', 'sometimes', 'tender', 'sometimes', 'conflicting.I', 'put', 'movie', 'same', 'level', 'almost', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'work', 'well', 'watching']",N/A

It's mesmerizing to watch him at his craft, and when you watch him, there's no doubt that he is the character he's portraying. However that's not enough to make this movie worth the time and money.The story is about a Brooklyn cop who's daughter comes home for a visit. Within a few minutes of the film's opening, she's shot down while next to her father. The rest of the movie is about the father's pursuit of truth as Mel's character seeks to uncover why his daughter was killed.There are several reasons why I can't really recommend this film. First we found the movie to be confusing at times. During the film, I found myself uncertain about what was going on, and who certain people really were. By the end of the flick we had several unanswered questions. It's possible those questions were answered during the film, but the story was sometimes difficult to follow. Perhaps this movie would be better watched on DVD so you can go back over it to determine what's going on. However I don't feel the movie was interesting enough to buy the DVD.Second, there were long periods when the movie was very slow moving and just not that interesting. There was plenty of exciting moments and some surprises, but there were times when this movie dragged.Third, I think the film lacked relationship. I do feel that the bond Mel had with his daughter was somewhat established, but it could have been more well done so that we, the audience could care more deeply. For example, there seemed to be some kind of separation or break between Mel's character and his daughter, but you never see what happened or why. It's hinted at by the daughter's boyfriend, but there was no answer given. There was also no real information about why the mother was not in the picture. This type of stuff was lacking.Fourth, certain things were predictable. That's never part of a recipe for a great movie.I'm glad Mel is back in the movies, and I hope he continues working. I can't say enough about him as an actor. However I hope he is able to pick some better projects in the future. He's done some extraordinary films over the years, and hopefully he'll get back on the path.",3,"Mel is fantastic, but this movie is not",1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,2184,"['Mel', 'Gibson', 'amazing', 'actor', 'mesmerizing', 'watch', 'craft', 'when', 'watch', 'doubt', 'character', 'portraying', 'However', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'time', 'money.The', 'story', 'Brooklyn', 'cop', 'who', 'daughter', 'home', 'visit', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'opening', 'shot', 'down', 'next', 'father', 'rest', 'movie', 'father', 'pursuit', 'truth', 'Mel', 'character', 'uncover', 'why', 'daughter', 'was', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'First', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'confusing', 'times', 'film', 'found', 'uncertain', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'who', 'certain', 'people', 'really', 'were', 'end', 'flick', 'had', 'several', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'possible', 'questions', 'were', 'answered', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'watched', 'DVD', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'determine', 'what', 'going', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'buy', 'DVD.Second', 'were', 'long', 'periods', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'was', 'plenty', 'exciting', 'moments', 'surprises', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'dragged.Third', 'think', 'film', 'lacked', 'relationship', 'do', 'feel', 'bond', 'Mel', 'had', 'daughter', 'was', 'somewhat', 'established', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'well', 'done', 'so', 'audience', 'could', 'care', 'more', 'deeply', 'example', 'seemed', 'be', 'kind', 'separation', 'break', 'Mel', 'character', 'daughter', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'hinted', 'daughter', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'answer', 'given', 'was', 'also', 'real', 'information', 'why', 'mother', 'was', 'not', 'picture', 'type', 'stuff', 'was', 'lacking.Fourth', 'certain', 'things', 'were', 'predictable', 'never', 'part', 'recipe', 'great', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Mel', 'back', 'movies', 'hope', 'working', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'about', 'actor', 'However', 'hope', 'able', 'pick', 'better', 'projects', 'future', 'done', 'extraordinary', 'films', 'years', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'path']",N/A

I do not have the Standard Def version but have seen in a few times on the cable channels which really are highly compressed.Edge of DarknessVideo; There was a surprisingly clean transfer of Edge of Darkness with little noticeable grain and a realistic color grading.  Skin tones are as they should be and there was no artifacting or video issue that I could see.  Mbps stayed generally in the low 20s but I really didn't notice any obvious DNR in any area of the film. .  Details were easily viewed even in the darker, more shadowy areas as well as the amazingly deep lines and wrinkles of Mel Gibson's skin.Audio: Lossless DTS HD 5.1 with some nice panning across the front stage and ambient use of rear channels for some, not a whole lot, of discreet use.  The sub generally serves for a bit of ambient bottom end and a couple of powerful action scenes.  There was no need to have your remotes volume nearby to roller coaster with, but I did have to boost the volume up a touch more than I usually do from the start of the film.  The lower audio production levels should not be an issue if you just bring up the volume a tad from the start.Extras include what they are now calling 'Focus Points' which is really no more than the typical 'Making of""  documentaries that often come with films.  They just break up the documentary into several parts including how the story came together, the original TV series by the BCC,  Boston and other areas of interest.

Aired on PBS in the United States, it was a dark, brooding thriller that seemed destined for a big-screen version that would be found lacking in ways big and small. However, Mel Gibson's 2010 version of the story still provides a lot of the sadness, bitterness, and intrigue with some changes that while they do necessarily improve the story, they don't damage it, either.Gibson plays Tom Craven (played as Ron Craven by Bob Peck in the original), a widowed Boston Homicide detective eagerly awaiting the visit of his only child Emma, who works for a research facility, Northmoor. Soon into the visit, Craven sees that his daughter is very ill. Just as he is taking her to the hospital, she is shot and killed. Being a police officer, Craven immediately assumes that the bullet was meant for him, but upon investigating further, he soon learns that she was involved in the illegal entry of Northmoor by a protest group looking for evidence of wrongdoing by the corporation. A conspiracy begins to surround Craven that includes Northmoor, a US senator, and a shadowy government fixer named Jedburgh, played by Roy Winstone.Gibson is always in his element in revenge thrillers, and Edge of Darkness is no exception. His tears, anger, rage, and righteous indignation strike the right notes at the right time, and he is ably supported by an excellent script and solid supporting cast. Again, a few details have been changed, but the general story remains bleak with perhaps a little more Hollywood hope and optimism added for good measure.",5,"Gibson's Updating of ""Edge"" A Masterful Retelling of A Great Story",1266105600,"02 14, 2010",2010,1620,"['Edge', 'Darkness', 'was', 'sensation', 'when', 'first', 'aired', 'British', 'television', '1985', 'Aired', 'PBS', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'dark', 'brooding', 'thriller', 'seemed', 'destined', 'big-screen', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'found', 'lacking', 'ways', 'big', 'small', 'However', 'Mel', 'Gibson', '2010', 'version', 'story', 'still', 'lot', 'sadness', 'bitterness', 'intrigue', 'changes', 'do', 'necessarily', 'improve', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'damage', 'plays', 'Tom', 'Craven', 'played', 'Ron', 'Craven', 'Bob', 'Peck', 'original', 'widowed', 'Boston', 'Homicide', 'detective', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'visit', 'only', 'child', 'Emma', 'who', 'research', 'facility', 'Northmoor', 'Soon', 'visit', 'Craven', 'daughter', 'very', 'ill.', 'Just', 'taking', 'hospital', 'shot', 'killed', 'Being', 'police', 'officer', 'Craven', 'immediately', 'bullet', 'was', 'meant', 'investigating', 'further', 'soon', 'was', 'involved', 'illegal', 'entry', 'Northmoor', 'protest', 'group', 'looking', 'evidence', 'wrongdoing', 'corporation', 'conspiracy', 'surround', 'Craven', 'Northmoor', 'US', 'senator', 'shadowy', 'government', 'fixer', 'named', 'Jedburgh', 'played', 'Roy', 'Winstone.Gibson', 'always', 'element', 'revenge', 'thrillers', 'Edge', 'Darkness', 'exception', 'tears', 'anger', 'rage', 'righteous', 'indignation', 'strike', 'right', 'notes', 'right', 'time', 'ably', 'supported', 'excellent', 'script', 'solid', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Again', 'few', 'details', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'general', 'story', 'bleak', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'hope', 'optimism', 'added', 'good', 'measure']",N/A

Similar elements to what were delivered, but in a different direction.  Not having any experience what the original materials that this ""update"" was based on, I only had the trailers to give me any sort of preconcieved notion of what to expect here.  What I expected was a revenge thriller, and yes, this film delivers that, but it adds in a conspiracy element that some will find too anti-government/anti-business to tolerate.Gibson has done the role of the man deserving and seeking and revenge many times along the way.  For me, most memorably in the Lethal Weapon series, and later in Payback and the film Ransom.  It's a role that some might most recently remember being filled by Liam Neeson in the filmTaken [Blu-ray].  Basic formula, take someone that is a definite bad-*ss and have a loved one harmed or threatened to be harmed in some fashion and then turn the revenge seeker loose to wreak havoc on anyone and everyone in their way.The one difference in this film is that there's a question of why the loved one was harmed and whether or not the wrong person was harmed?  In terms of the film, certainly the wrong person wasn't harmed.  If daddy (Gibson) had been the victim rather than the daughter then one would expect much less damage to have been caused by revenge seeker, though I suppose we'll know we've truly reached equality when we start seeing films of this genre that feature females in the lead roles.Edge of Darkness moves along at a reasonable pace and delivers a fairly satisfying result, though personally I don't see it as being head and shoulders above just about anything else in the same genre(s).

The story was actually pretty good, filled with twists, turns, crosses, and double crosses, but the problem was that it was all too familiar. Murdered daughter, angry father looking for justice, Mel Gibson on a crazy rampage....and why are these things always in Boston? Does Hollywood have some secret underground bet about who will have the worst accent? That being said, Gibson, (minus the accent), was terrific. Say what you will about him as a person, but when it comes to a dark, action thriller, there is still no one better than Mel Gibson. His character was very reminiscent of Porter in Payback, intense, strong, and smart as a whip.

Gibson brings a similar single minded determination to his role in Edge of Darkness (2010), playing a Boston police detective, searching for his daughter's killer.  There have been some rather well publicized incidents, where anger management has been a problem for Gibson.  And though it may be unfair, his performance in Edge of Darkness displays some of the intensity and seething rage that many have come to associate with Gibson, who is often quite scary.  Relocated to America, the film is based on a 1985 BBC miniseries.  Some major spoilers follow.Emma Craven (Bojana Novakovic) has just arrived in Boston, to visit her father Thomas (Gibson).  While standing on the front porch, she is blasted by a man with a shotgun.  Following her death, with the assumption that he was the intended target, detective Craven is given a free hand to investigate Emma's murder.  Craven unexpectedly discovers that his daughter is just one of many victims, in a massive criminal conspiracy involving, her employer, and the federal government.The rather familiar premise, utilizes a multitude of clich&eacute;s, including ruthless businessmen who employ hit men, crooked politicians, a shadowy figure, surveillance teams, a secret lab, informants, and lots of intrigue and backstabbing, as to keep secrets from being revealed, people begin to turn up dead.Craven's investigation provides some insights into his relationship with his daughter as a young girl, but not so much as an adult.  It's not really essential, but this serves as further motivation, for his at times ruthless actions.  The action scenes are impactful, and well-done, as Gibson does a great job of keeping things edgy and tense.  His character is totally screwed and facing impossible odds, but nevertheless manages to extract what ""justice"" can be had under the circumstances.  You would expect nothing less from Mel Gibson, and although the story doesn't always hold up well, Gibson's performance helps to carry it through.Edge of Darkness provides some gritty thrills, but with its extremely downbeat tone, it's not a feel-good experience, that many will want to see over and over again.  The corporate conspiracy thing has been done so many times before, and it seems like very familiar territory here.

The film is directed by Martin Campbell (""GoldenEye"" ""Casino Royale""), who also directed the British TV mini-series ""Edge of Darkness"" in 1985, on which this new version is based.The 2010 remake benefits from the solid acting from the stars Mel Gibson (his first lead role in about eight years since ""Signs"") and Ray Winstone as mysterious Darius Jedburgh, as well as the director's sure-handed approach to the genre, but the film's storyline holds no big surprises and its political aspects, once intriguing, look sadly dated now. Also, the film's second part feels rushed, and everything seems to wrap itself up all too conveniently.After all, we have seen so many revenge thrillers (including the ones starring Mel Gibson himself).

1241882,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001UV4XRY,Turfseer,"[0, 3]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating 2.5 out of 5After eight years of not appearing in pictures, Mad Mel finally returned in this remake based on a 1985 BBC television series. It appeared to be a good vehicle to restore his public image which Mad Mel did great damage to after getting arrested for a DWI and spouting anti-Semitic epithets while inebriated. The setting is now Boston instead of London. Mad Mel plays Thomas Craven, a police detective who witnesses the murder of his daughter, Emma, on his front porch. At first, the authorities believe Craven was the intended target but Craven concludes otherwise.Craven soon discovers that Emma was working for Northmoor, a private research and development facility, contracted by the US government but surreptitiously developing nuclear weapons made to look like Jihadist dirty bombs so they can't be traced. One wonders why Northmoor loses confidence after attempting to kill Emma by poisoning her with a radioactive substance and then awkwardly murders her in plain view in front of her father (why didn't they kill her before she met up with him?) What's more, you would think that the first person a young woman who fears for her life would contact, is her father. After all he IS a police detective and given her level of fear, I hardly believe that their purported 'estrangement' would have moved her to accept a gun from her boyfriend for protection instead of calling on the one person she knows could really help her.Speaking of the boyfriend, I also hardly believe that Northmoor would have accepted the results of that 'lie detector test' as they were quite aware that he was intimately involved with Emma and knew what was going on. Simply put, if they were such a nefarious group who had no scruples about killing Emma, they would have simply disposed of the boyfriend at the same time as they decided to dispose of Emma.The plot picks up again when Craven visits Jack Bennett, played by Danny Huston who is utterly believable as Northmoor's menacing CEO. There's an exciting scene where Craven escapes from two Northmoor goons by breaking out a glass panel in a rest area bathroom but too much of Mad Mel when Craven cuts off Bennett in his limousine on the highway and almost shoots him with his gun, inside Bennett's vehicle.As for the shady 'fixer', Jedburgh, I can't agree with many critics who found Ray Winstone to be compelling as an urbane assassin hired by the government to prevent Craven from finding out what happened to Emma or even kill him. First off, Winstone mumbles most of his lines and it's difficult understanding half of what he's saying. Worse is the fact that whenever he appears, he ends up having these long-winded conversations with Craven, and slows the action down considerably. Finally, Winstone's character is not at all convincing. Supposedly an amoral character, he somehow acquires a conscience and gives Craven a free pass. Oh yes, he's also suffering from a terminal illness and I suppose that's the other reason he 'softens up' and eventually turns against his employers.Craven obtains more information about one of Emma's contacts from one of her friends. They meet in a secluded spot inside his car but when she ends the meeting, somehow a Northmoor employee has secret psychic powers, as he's aware of the exact moment when she steps out of the car, so he can run her down (the car would have had to be parked right next to and a little behind Craven's car since we never hear the sound of the motor running as he hits her!).Perhaps the most ludicrous scene in the movie (even more ludicrous when Mad Mel does the bad guys in at the end) is when he's set up by his police pal and is captured by the Northmoor goons. Why don't they just kill him on the spot? Instead, Craven (or should I say 'Mad Mel') uses super strength to rip apart a gurney that he is handcuffed to and then easily escapes from the maximum security facility! We're led to believe that Craven ends up poisoned by drinking milk tainted with a radioactive substance (just as was done to his daughter). This despite the fact he had a mini-Geiger counter (found in his daughter's effects) at his ready to check any of the food or drinks in his refrigerator. Somehow, it doesn't occur to the clever detective that Northmoor could have easily broken into his home and poisoned any aspect of his food supply.Mad Mel is most dramatically compelling when he picks on the unprincipled 'ordinary citizen' who betrays the victims here for a few 'pieces of silver'. It doesn't matter whether they work for the sleazy Northmoor Corporation or the government--Mad Mel pummels both Sanderson (the attorney) and Robinson (Northmoor employee) with his fists but chooses not to kill them (at one point, he states that his daughter wouldn't have approved!).The Edge of Darkness denouement proves to be as implausible as a good deal of the rest of the film. Somehow, Craven (channeling Mad Mel), is easily able to gain access to Bennett's private residence, dispatches the two goons (one who killed his daughter) and kills Bennett with a shot to the throat (before dispatching Bennett, he forces him to drink the radioactive milk!). Jedburgh (also channeling Mad Mel), dispatches the government goons (including the sleazy Senator Pine, well played by Damian Young) by also shooting them.Despite illegally taking revenge on the bad guys, Mad Mel joins his murdered daughter in heaven as he succumbs to his injuries. Craven aka Mad Mel aka Mad Mel the Saint, proves for the umpteenth time, that he's 'one of the good guys' and that God is definitely on his side! If you can ignore all the cardboard cutout bad guys plus Mad Mel's sermonizing, you may find all this somewhat entertaining.",2,Mad Mel occasionally entertains as he takes down implausible corporate &

1241886,AP3B615GM191G,B001UV4XRY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[5, 21]","After the resounding success of the 2008 film ""Taken"", the ""Dad pushed to the limit over his daughter's distress"" formula comes back in the form of Mel Gibson.  Unfortunately, this effort cannot hold a candle to its predecessor.For a basic plot summary, the movie revolves around detective Thomas Craven (Gibson), whose daughter is shot and killed in his arms and thus prompts an investigation into the circumstances.  The plot deepens a bit when Craven learns that his precious daughter may have not been so innocent as originally thought.To be honest, this was perhaps one of the most boring movies I have ever sat through.  I usually don't get distracted or antsy while watching a film, but in this case it was all I could do to keep from looking at the VCR timer to see how much time was left.  As usual, the culprits were an uninspiring plot and understated acting:-Plot-wise, I never really understood exactly what was going on (both literally and figuratively).  Viewers come to understand exactly what Craven's daughter was involved in, but there really isn't any emotional payoff at the end.  It's hard to root for Craven, as he is so depressed that it will begin to rub off on you, while the villain (a ""mysterious"" figure with a foreign accent so heavy it is often difficult to make out what he is saying) is so contrived and uninteresting that you really won't care one way or the other when his fate is ultimately decided.  When you can't rouse much interest in either the hero OR the villain and how they affect the overall plot, what is there to really care about?-In terms of acting, the film really is all about Mel, and he plays Craven as much too depressed and moody to do anything but alienate viewers.  I kept waiting for the character to emotionally snap (like Neeson in ""Taken"") and do something gritty/exciting, but it just never happened.  The action seemed to be thrust upon him, never seeing him do anything heroic or even remotely cheer-worthy.So, because of the muted acting and complicated, uninspiring plot, I really can't recommend this movie to anyone.  If you are into the whole ""revenge justice"" thing (e.g. Jack Bauer is your personal life hero), PLEASE opt for ""Taken"" instead.  If not, prepare for two hours of looking at your watch.",1,Two Hours Of Mel Gibson Sitting Around And Looking Depressed,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2271,"['resounding', 'success', '2008', 'film', 'Taken', 'Dad', 'pushed', 'limit', 'daughter', 'distress', 'formula', 'back', 'form', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Unfortunately', 'effort', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'predecessor.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'around', 'detective', 'Thomas', 'Craven', 'Gibson', 'daughter', 'shot', 'killed', 'arms', 'thus', 'prompts', 'investigation', 'circumstances', 'plot', 'bit', 'when', 'Craven', 'precious', 'daughter', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'innocent', 'originally', 'thought.To', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'sat', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'distracted', 'antsy', 'watching', 'film', 'case', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'keep', 'looking', 'VCR', 'timer', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'usual', 'culprits', 'were', 'uninspiring', 'plot', 'understated', 'acting', '-Plot-wise', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Viewers', 'come', 'understand', 'exactly', 'what', 'Craven', 'daughter', 'was', 'involved', 'there', 'really', ""n't"", 'emotional', 'payoff', 'end', 'hard', 'root', 'Craven', 'so', 'depressed', 'will', 'begin', 'rub', 'off', 'villain', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'foreign', 'accent', 'so', 'heavy', 'often', 'difficult', 'make', 'out', 'what', 'saying', 'so', 'contrived', 'uninteresting', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'when', 'fate', 'ultimately', 'decided', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rouse', 'much', 'interest', 'hero', 'OR', 'villain', 'how', 'affect', 'overall', 'plot', 'what', 'there', 'really', 'care', '-In', 'terms', 'acting', 'film', 'really', 'Mel', 'Craven', 'much', 'too', 'depressed', 'moody', 'do', 'anything', 'alienate', 'viewers', 'kept', 'waiting', 'character', 'emotionally', 'snap', 'Neeson', 'Taken', 'do', 'something', 'gritty/exciting', 'just', 'never', 'happened', 'action', 'seemed', 'be', 'thrust', 'never', 'seeing', 'do', 'anything', 'heroic', 'even', 'remotely', 'cheer-worthy.So', 'muted', 'acting', 'complicated', 'uninspiring', 'plot', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'are', 'whole', 'revenge', 'justice', 'thing', 'e.g', 'Jack', 'Bauer', 'personal', 'life', 'hero', 'PLEASE', 'opt', 'Taken', 'instead', 'not', 'prepare', 'two', 'hours', 'looking', 'watch']",N/A
