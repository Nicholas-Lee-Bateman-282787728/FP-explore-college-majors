I really wish they would put this movie on DVD because it rightly deserves to be there.  It is a great movie. It has everything a movie needs action, drama, excitement and any other words I could think of other than GREAT !!!  Maybe someday they will put it on DVD and we will get a clearer picture.  I definately would buy it in a heartbeat! Once you watch it you will have to watch it over and over and over again.

Its great to see it available again, especially in Widescreen.  Tim Hutton is really convincing as a fella who idolizes his older fireman brother.  This movie holds more magic today, mainly because of 9/11.  This movie has wit, charm, class and enough joy to outlast any chick flick.  Yeah, it's a chick flick for guys!
