1664388,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00E3V9N1E,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[11, 12]","When I watch a time period-specific movie or a TV series, I pay close attention to the production design, hoping that I would make me feel that I was there. Set in the Miami of the late fifties, ""Magic City"" certainly made me feel that way - its attention to detail is just fascinating as the story itself. Having reviewed the first season of this classy and intriguing series, I anxiously waited for the second one. And, for my bucks, the ""Magic Season - The Second complete Season"" did not disappoint - it is first class entertainment.The second season Blu-ray edition includes 3 discs, the first two featuring eight episodes and the third one loaded with special features. It opens with ""Crimes and Punishment,"" where we find Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the series' main character, in prison, accused of murder, with Judi Silver (Elena Satine), a prostitute, as the main witness. However, Ike is able to get bail, and is also fortunate to keep his beloved Miramar Playa Hotel. ""Angel of Death,"" the second episode, introduces us to a new character: Sy Berman (the always dependable James Caan), a respected Chicago Outfit mobster, who arrives to Miami to visit Ben Diamond (Danny Huston, who shines in his role), the local mobster king. When asked by Sy if he is happy, Ben responds, ""Happy? F-----g Howdy Doody is happy. I'm content."" At the end of the episode, Ike is traveling to Cuba, to expand his empire. In the following episodes, we'll keep witnessing Ben's sexual fantasies with his wife (Jessica Marais); Ike's deals with the Cuban government;  Jack Klein (Matt Ross), Miami's District Attorney, restless harassment of Ike Evans; Ike's son, Stevie (Steven Strait) rising up in the power structure, but not in a good way; Ben putting pressure on Miami politicians to pass the law that would allow gambling in Miami, and Ike and Meg Bannock (Kelly Lynch) fight against it; and much more. The last episode of the season, and the best, I think, feels like ""The Godfather,"" with all the pieces falling into place, and in which only the best will survive, with Ike always trying to save and keep his hotel, with the support of his beautiful wife Vera (Olga Kurylenko). In addition to Caan, the second season also features Esai Morales and Sherilyn Fenn. I specially enjoyed the use of the track ""Fever,"" with the voice of legendary Cuban singer La Lupe.As I mentioned in the review for the first season, ""Magic City"" ""has class and elegance in everything - the sex, the ambiance, the colors, the nudity... hell, even the violence. It has style and it has substance - great production design and photography --, and it feels like noir at times."" The exciting second season follows the same path, and I can't wait for the next one. The special features include the documentaries ""The gamble for Havana,"" ""The Criminal Element,"" ""Magic City Style,"" and more.

To me, the casting and acting was very well done. The settings, music, clothes, and cars were great. Everything was very authentic. The show really gave you a look at what life was like in those times as far as clothing, culture, cars, etc go. The story was rich and multifaceted and could have taken several of the main characters in different directions. Season two sort of served as the fork in the road or turning point for a lot of characters and you could definitely see it all unfolding. However, at the end, you are left hanging big time with no resolution because that was all supposed to be season three! (which is ok as long as you actually get the next season). It was unfortunate that the cancellation news broke after all the filming had wrapped up so there really wasn't a chance for the show to go out in a blaze of glory and tie up all the loose ends. Instead you are left with a tremendous feeling of I can't wait to see what happens in season three. A season that will never come......I am definitely sad to see magic city go and I wish the show would be saved, but I guess the numbers just weren't there. I don't think the show got the recognition it deserved.

I've heard that Starz has cancelled the series so I can't fully recommend this since it seems to be building towards something bigger in an imagined season 3. One can only hope that there will be some sort of closure in the future - whether that means a movie to complete it, or by some luck only the dreamland of 60's Miami cool could create - that it would get picked up by Netflix or Amazon for more seasons.",4,Another great series...but,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,534,"['series', 'beauty', 'style', 'really', 'alive', 'stellar', 'cast', 'truly', 'have', ""'magic"", 'here', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'Starz', 'cancelled', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fully', 'recommend', 'be', 'building', 'something', 'bigger', 'imagined', 'season', '3', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'sort', 'closure', 'future', 'movie', 'complete', 'luck', 'only', 'dreamland', '60', 'Miami', 'cool', 'could', 'create', 'would', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'more', 'seasons']",N/A
