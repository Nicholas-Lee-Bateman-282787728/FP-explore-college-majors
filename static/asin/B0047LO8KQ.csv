This is probably the last season that still seemed like reality TV. The next two seasons are more scripted/staged and more about her celeb guests. Just as funny, just different format.

Seriously, Kathy Griffin is hilarious! Sure,to some, she's abrasive but then, they can SUCK IT! I just wish that they could bring out the rest of the series more quickly.
