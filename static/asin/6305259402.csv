456322,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,6305259402,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[9, 10]","I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no, it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay, enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go, except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who, after reneging on a promise to throw a fight, escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop,' `Octopussy' and `Rambo: First Blood Part II' but then seemed to disappear from view. Here he plays the Foreign Legion commander who must lick the raw recruits into shape - and he dominates every scene in which he appears.The action scenes are also well staged and you feel the danger in which the troops are thrust into, the movie makers also do a good job of conveying the confusion and chaos that comes from close quarters fighting.If you enjoyed other Jean Claude movies then chances are this one will also hit the spot. It's not quite as good as `Sudden Death' (my favorite Jean Claude picture) but it's an entertaining ride.",3,"Actually, it's not that bad",1100736000,"11 18, 2004",2004,2139,"['think', 'television', 'listing', 'description', 'read', 'movie', 'was', 'misleading', 'actually', 'was', 'wrong', 'According', 'what', 'TiVo', 'said', 'story', 'followed', '1920s', 'playboy', 'who', 'stint', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'reclaim', 'former', 'lover', 'mobster', 'girl', 'Obviously', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'starters', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'playboy', 'was', 'boxer', 'second', 'never', 'France', 'reclaim', 'former', 'lover', 'fact', 'learn', 'progress', 'film', 'woman', 'question', 'emigrated', 'United', 'States.Okay', 'enough', 'gripes', 'how', 'inaccurate', 'tv', 'listings', 'can', 'be', 'what', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'question', 'actually', 'okay', 'far', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'VanDamme', 'movies', 'go', 'really', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'way', 'martial', 'arts', 'previous', 'films', 'Instead', 'more', 'rifle', 'shoot', 'charging', 'North', 'African', 'tribesmen', 'fists', 'straighten', 'out', 'fellow', 'Foreign', 'Legionnaire', 'who', 'get', 'kicks', 'bullying', 'weaker', 'colleagues.Jean', 'Claude', 'boxer', 'who', 'reneging', 'promise', 'throw', 'fight', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'flee', 'clutches', 'murderous', 'mobster', 'flung', 'headfirst', 'North', 'Africa', 'war', 'local', 'nomadic', 'tribesmen', 'occupying', 'French', 'forces.What', 'was', 'really', 'treat', 'was', 'presence', 'Steven', 'Berkoff', 'been', 'awhile', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'high', 'profile', 'early', 'mid', '1980s', 'movies', 'such', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Cop', 'Octopussy', 'Rambo', 'First', 'Blood', 'Part', 'II', 'then', 'seemed', 'disappear', 'view', 'Here', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'commander', 'who', 'must', 'lick', 'raw', 'recruits', 'shape', 'scene', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'staged', 'feel', 'danger', 'troops', 'are', 'thrust', 'movie', 'makers', 'also', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'confusion', 'chaos', 'close', 'quarters', 'fighting.If', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'movies', 'then', 'chances', 'are', 'one', 'will', 'also', 'hit', 'spot', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Sudden', 'Death', 'favorite', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'picture', 'entertaining', 'ride']",N/A

A long-time friend and boxing promoter gets 86'd after a crooked fight.3. Does he take his shirt off? And pants in an all male shower, in a rare bare-butt scene for JCVD4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, but there is that shower...5. Is there a tournament? No tournament at all, this is a different movie for Van Damme6. Is training needed for this tournament? Aaaarmy training sir!7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? No splits are necessary when you have a rifle8. Does he punch someone in the balls? Sadly, JCVD is breaking all of his movie rules in this one.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Unbelievably, he doesn't kick at all.  I guess being a boxer makes kicking forbidden.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? A bunch of Berber warriors on horses are hardly worthy of JCVD's awe-inspiring will to win.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Throughout this movie there is more than one person who poses a roadblock for JCVD.  The love of his life is lost to him early on.  While in the French Foreign Legion he has to team up with a squirrelly Frenchman named Rosetti who can't march more than a day without falling out, a surly black American who breaks every rule, and a posh Brit with a drinking problem who was dishonorably discharged from the British military.12. Does he win? This might be the first movie since No Retreat No Surrender in which JCVD is not the unequivocal winner and hero of the movie.Straying quite a bit from his norm, Van Damme takes on a role and a script that strays from most of his standard practices.  Very little fighting immediately makes it foreign territory for him, but the fact that this plays out like a Lawrence of Arabia (maybe even Beau Geste) than Lionheart - another movie in which he plays a character on the run who joins the French Foreign Legion and gets stationed in northern Africa.Production values and cinematography in this film truly reflect the 35 million dollar budget.  Stunning desert landscapes and multiple juxtapositions of the sun create foreboding dimensions which visually explain Lefevre's hopeless and weathered outlook on life.  Other aspects of the time period are perfect, with the music and costumes providing authenticity.  Even the supporting cast is superb, most notably Steven Berkoff as hard-nosed Sgt. Steinkampf.Essentially this is about men running away from lives, seeking new future, finding camaraderie and danger in the French Foreign Legion, and fighting until the last breath for survival.

Instead, it's a war movie about the French Foreign Legion in 1925 that is sent to war in Africa. Van Damme plays Alain, a fugitive boxer who signs up with the Legion as a way of escape from gangsters. This all happens within the first 10 or so minutes. The large bulk of the film has Alain befriending his fellow legionnaires and learning the values of friendship even in a time of war. True, this movie is rather predictable and many of the characters seem cliche, but the cinematography, score and (surprisingly) acting are all above average. Even Van Damme pulls off a convincing performance, proving that when he's given a good script, he can be believable. The reason this $40 million film was never released in theaters was because of its downbeat ending. Don't be fooled by its direct-to-video nature, though.

The very-overated ""Beau Geste,"" by comparison, is definitely a better story-line, but Gary Cooper was way too old to play the title role and he's too wooden.

When he meets his old girlfriend who he stiffed at their wedding he decides to run away with her. This doesn't work out and he decides to run away to join the French Foreign Legion. He knows that it is going to be bad going in but has to do it. I wish they would have explained a little more of exactly why he joined but that is really the only major flaw in the movie. The interaction between the main charcters who Jean Claude meets is the shining point in the movie. Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje's(Oz, Lost) southern accent was odd to hear. It didn't fully work for me but it is always great to see him on screen. Everybody is great and they stick by each other no matter what and everybody just does a brilliant acting job overall. Jean Claude's facial expressions looked stiff for the most part but he was the worst of the bunch and still did pretty good for himself.While fighting battles with no of chance winning, some of Jean Claude's past catches up with him but the heart of the story is between the main characters and the story remains that way until the end which was a good choice.I was completely surprised this wasn't your standard B-action flick. It is actually a very good movie with great sets and superb battle scenes. The cinematography in the desert is one of the finer points of the movie. No stylized action and the movie is all the better for it. We don't need to see Jean Claude doing super kicks and taking out everybody who has a gun with his bare 2 hands. We have seen that way too many times. You could tell it was right at this point in his career that he wanted to start doing better movies and he has put out about 4 good movies since this. Things are definitely looking up for the man who's first starring role was in Ng See Yuen's 'No Retreat, No Surrender'(AKA Karate Tiger). The movie gets a 3.5 from me but I can only pick a 3 or a 4. I don't know if I would watch it again since I am a hardcore action junkie but it was damn good movie.This is a great DVD release from Sterling Entertainment. Picture is widecreened in a letterboxed format. Only 2-channel sound but still pretty good.Special features include a 7 minute behind the scenes. It has an interview with one of the producers where he talks about Jean Claude. It also has an interview with the director and you get a little bit of a look behind the scenes.There is a French Foreign Legion section and has a good interview with an historian. This is very good information wise and briefly tells how the Legion came to be and a bit about what happens after this movie. Best special feature on here. Also in this section is a very brief recent look at the FFL, text given on descriptions of weapons used, and a still gallery of filming the movie.There is also a commentary with the writer of the movie.The back of the DVD case also says that it has a commentary from a FFL expert and I was very disappointed not to find that on the disc.",4,Good direct to TV movie,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,3078,"['think', 'direct', 'TV', 'certainly', 'never', 'heard', 'theaters.Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'boxer', 'who', 'supposed', 'throw', 'fight', 'When', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'stiffed', 'wedding', 'run', 'away', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'run', 'away', 'join', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'going', 'be', 'bad', 'going', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'explained', 'little', 'more', 'exactly', 'why', 'joined', 'really', 'only', 'major', 'flaw', 'movie', 'interaction', 'main', 'charcters', 'who', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'meets', 'shining', 'point', 'movie', 'Adewale', 'Akinnouye-Agbaje', 'Oz', 'Lost', 'southern', 'accent', 'was', 'odd', 'hear', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'work', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'screen', 'Everybody', 'great', 'stick', 'other', 'matter', 'what', 'everybody', 'just', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'job', 'overall', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'facial', 'expressions', 'looked', 'stiff', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'worst', 'bunch', 'still', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'himself.While', 'fighting', 'battles', 'chance', 'winning', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'past', 'up', 'heart', 'story', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'way', 'end', 'was', 'good', 'choice.I', 'was', 'completely', 'surprised', 'was', ""n't"", 'standard', 'B-action', 'flick', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'sets', 'superb', 'battle', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'desert', 'one', 'finer', 'points', 'movie', 'stylized', 'action', 'movie', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'doing', 'super', 'kicks', 'taking', 'out', 'everybody', 'who', 'gun', 'bare', '2', 'hands', 'have', 'seen', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'right', 'point', 'career', 'wanted', 'start', 'doing', 'better', 'movies', 'put', 'out', '4', 'good', 'movies', 'Things', 'are', 'definitely', 'looking', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'was', 'Ng', 'See', 'Yuen', ""'No"", 'Retreat', 'No', 'Surrender', 'AKA', 'Karate', 'Tiger', 'movie', '3.5', 'can', 'only', 'pick', '3', '4', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'am', 'hardcore', 'action', 'junkie', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'movie.This', 'great', 'DVD', 'release', 'Sterling', 'Entertainment', 'Picture', 'widecreened', 'letterboxed', 'format', 'Only', '2-channel', 'sound', 'still', 'pretty', 'good.Special', 'features', 'include', '7', 'minute', 'scenes', 'interview', 'one', 'producers', 'where', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'also', 'interview', 'director', 'get', 'little', 'bit', 'look', 'scenes.There', 'French', 'Foreign', 'Legion', 'section', 'good', 'interview', 'historian', 'very', 'good', 'information', 'wise', 'briefly', 'how', 'Legion', 'came', 'be', 'bit', 'what', 'movie', 'Best', 'special', 'feature', 'here', 'Also', 'section', 'very', 'brief', 'recent', 'look', 'FFL', 'text', 'given', 'descriptions', 'weapons', 'used', 'still', 'gallery', 'filming', 'movie.There', 'also', 'commentary', 'writer', 'movie.The', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'also', 'commentary', 'FFL', 'expert', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'not', 'find', 'disc']",N/A

A straight-forward plot sets the action in motion.  I must confess to not being a Van Damme fan, and actually knew little about him before this film, but I give him credit for a good job here.  In fact he seems to have co-produced it which I also appluad.  He gives a solid performance combining humor with pathos and sadness.  The film provides a realistic view of the Legion during the murderous Riff Wars of the 1920s.  This was just after WW1 and France was hard-pressed to hold onto her Algerian colonies.  The movie accurately portrays the brutal atmosphere of the Legion from training to combat.  The harshness of life, the tough NCOs and the inadequate officers who indifferently lead the Legion are all well shown.  One can almost say that this is a modern re-make of BEAU GESTE, but it also combines elements of MARCH OR DIE as well.  Still, there is enough here that is original and allows LEGIONAIRE to stand on its own with those two earlier classics.  The film movies quickly and is handsomely produced.  Fans of the Legion will surely enjoy, and those use to Van Damme in a different kind of film may be intriqued as well.

The movie tells the story of a boxer who betrays a French mob boss when he goes back on a deal.  He is then forced to join the Foreign Legion when he has nowhere else to turn too.  The film follows the training of the new company and then there battles against the Rif tribesmen.  This film is very different from most of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, but it is very good.  He doesn't fight throughout the movie instead actually talking although there are plenty of action scenes.Surprisingly, Van Damme is very good as Alain DuChamps, the boxer forced into the Legion.  He is very believable in the role.  The supporting cast for this movie stands out as above average compared to other Van Damme action movies.  Nicholas Farrell is excellent as Macentosh, the ex-soldier with a weakness for gambling.  Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Alain's friend, Luther, a man fed up with his past and how he's been treated. He is excellent in the supporting role to Van Damme and Farrell.  Also starring are Steven Berkoff and Jim Carter.  This is an excellent movie with grand landscapes in the African landscape, well put together action scenes, and believable characters.  This movie deserved better than its straight to video release.

People expecting a usual Van Damme karate movie will be suprised to see that there isn't much of that kind of action in it. I watched this movie only a half hour ago and I liked all the way. The acting of Van Damme is at its best (Though its stil not good)This movie goes deeper than other Van Damme Flicks. People who say its boring probably bought this movie because they wanted to see Van Damme kick and punch his opponents to death.Alain Lefevre (Van Damme) joins the foreigner Legion after double-crossing some kind of Maffia guy. In the Legion he makes friends that include a black guy that joined the Legion so he could escape America and go to Africa, an addicted Gambler from the U.K. and a sissy that wanted to prove himself to his Parents in law. They will be followed during the events they have in the Legion.With a good dose of drama and Action, placed in beautiful settings, this movie provided me an entertaining 90 minutes. Its a shame that this movie didn't ended up in the theaters and Universal Soldier: The Return did. This movie is outstanding and without a doubt one of the best movies Van Damme has played in. Not only for Van Damme fans, but for everyone that loves a good movie.",4,Worth a look,992736000,"06 17, 2001",2001,1250,"['will', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'hate', 'People', 'expecting', 'usual', 'Van', 'Damme', 'karate', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'suprised', 'see', ""n't"", 'much', 'kind', 'action', 'watched', 'movie', 'only', 'half', 'hour', 'liked', 'way', 'acting', 'Van', 'Damme', 'best', 'stil', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'deeper', 'other', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Flicks', 'People', 'who', 'say', 'boring', 'probably', 'bought', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'Van', 'Damme', 'kick', 'punch', 'opponents', 'death.Alain', 'Lefevre', 'Van', 'Damme', 'foreigner', 'Legion', 'double-crossing', 'kind', 'Maffia', 'guy', 'Legion', 'friends', 'include', 'black', 'guy', 'joined', 'Legion', 'could', 'escape', 'America', 'go', 'Africa', 'addicted', 'Gambler', 'U.K.', 'sissy', 'wanted', 'prove', 'Parents', 'law', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'events', 'have', 'Legion.With', 'good', 'dose', 'drama', 'Action', 'placed', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'movie', 'provided', 'entertaining', '90', 'minutes', 'shame', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'ended', 'up', 'theaters', 'Universal', 'Soldier', 'Return', 'did', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'Van', 'Damme', 'played', 'Not', 'only', 'Van', 'Damme', 'fans', 'everyone', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
