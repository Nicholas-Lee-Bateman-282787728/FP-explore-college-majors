Overall, BORING. I didn't even want to finish it and regret buying it. Search harder if you want a good dance workout that is also fun to do.",2,Don't like it.,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,453,"['was', 'looking', 'dance', 'DVD', 'could', 'teach', 'moves', 'could', 'actually', 'USE', 'club', 'just', 'dancing', 'around', 'friends', 'moves', 'are', 'super', 'outdated', 'instructor', 'friendly', 'clear', 'enough', 'just', 'too', 'fast', 'enough', 'breakdown', 'even', 'learn', 'moves', 'Overall', 'BORING', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'finish', 'regret', 'buying', 'Search', 'harder', 'want', 'good', 'dance', 'workout', 'also', 'fun', 'do']",Rhythmica: Dance Cardio Party

1461926,A291LDD62756XF,B005IQGNGQ,Expert Shopper,"[3, 3]",I LOVE this video!!  I will warn you that if you have never done dance videos before it may take you while to get down the move but don't let that stop you! The instructor is awesome and makes you want to dance your hardest! I have thought that most of the dance videos out there are not enough of a workout but this one is! Even when the moves are slow you are working your muscles and working up a sweat!  You will feel it after this one!  This is probably the most fun I have ever had working out!  I HIGHLY recommend this one!!!!,5,Best Dance Workout I have ever done!!,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,533,"['LOVE', 'video', 'will', 'warn', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'dance', 'videos', 'may', 'take', 'get', 'down', 'move', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'instructor', 'awesome', 'want', 'dance', 'hardest', 'have', 'thought', 'most', 'dance', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'workout', 'one', 'Even', 'when', 'moves', 'are', 'slow', 'are', 'working', 'muscles', 'working', 'up', 'sweat', 'will', 'feel', 'one', 'probably', 'most', 'fun', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'working', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'one']",Rhythmica: Dance Cardio Party
1461927,A3LV82YY8G0VH6,B005IQGNGQ,GoBeFabulous,"[0, 1]","This the very first fitness dvd I've ever bought and I totally love it. It has 3 different segments: House Party Fitness, Hip Hop Dance and Latin Dance. Each segment has 2-3 dance routines. I have crappy knees, two left feet and zero rhythm so I was somewhat dubious but the reviews were so spectacular that I thought if I was ever going to try one, this would be the one to experiment with.Imagine my surprise when I found I could do the routines! The lead guy (who has 2 female backup dancers) is engaging and encouraging and makes understanding the moves very very simple (perfect for an idiot like me:) Plus they run through the move slowly several times over before doing it in real time. Once you learn a move, you move on to the next one. After you learn that one, they string the two moves together. Then you go on to the 3rd move and so on and so forth.There was only 1-2 moves that didn't make sense for me with my creaky knees so I would insert a move I learned from a different dance to keep time.I really dug the music too. It's some sort of house synth but it has a nice little repetition to it.Overall, I would say this is an excellent dance fitness DVD for most people and worth the money I spent on it. I recommend it.",5,Pretty Awesome Even for Beginners!,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,1235,"['very', 'first', 'fitness', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bought', 'totally', 'love', '3', 'different', 'segments', 'House', 'Party', 'Fitness', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Dance', 'Latin', 'Dance', 'segment', '2-3', 'dance', 'routines', 'have', 'crappy', 'knees', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'zero', 'rhythm', 'so', 'was', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'reviews', 'were', 'so', 'spectacular', 'thought', 'was', 'ever', 'going', 'try', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'experiment', 'with.Imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'found', 'could', 'do', 'routines', 'lead', 'guy', 'who', '2', 'female', 'backup', 'dancers', 'engaging', 'encouraging', 'understanding', 'moves', 'very', 'very', 'simple', 'perfect', 'idiot', 'run', 'move', 'slowly', 'several', 'times', 'doing', 'real', 'time', 'Once', 'learn', 'move', 'move', 'next', 'one', 'learn', 'one', 'string', 'two', 'moves', 'together', 'Then', 'go', '3rd', 'move', 'so', 'so', 'forth.There', 'was', 'only', '1-2', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'creaky', 'knees', 'would', 'insert', 'move', 'learned', 'different', 'dance', 'keep', 'time.I', 'really', 'music', 'too', 'sort', 'house', 'synth', 'nice', 'little', 'repetition', 'it.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'excellent', 'dance', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'most', 'people', 'worth', 'money', 'spent', 'recommend']",Rhythmica: Dance Cardio Party

You can work out a sweat by the third routine or maybe even sooner it's work out every area of your body no body part goes un-noticed. I love how he pretends like the dance is coming to an end and then out of no where he throws in another dance step, he got me every time. I became a junkie for this video I will rewind, rewind, rewind and rewind until I get the dance steps down pack. (It works) I became addicted and I'm afraid to order something from Marc Santa Maria again because I might get even more addicted.I'm not a club person but this sure do makes me want to go just to show these dance moves off..It was a good investment for me..if you love to dance, can endure fast pace routines than this my dear is for you.",5,I dream of going to the club..and shutting it down,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,782,"['Ok..I', 'love', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'Party', 'can', 'feel', 'vibe', 'can', 'work', 'out', 'sweat', 'third', 'routine', 'maybe', 'even', 'sooner', 'work', 'out', 'area', 'body', 'body', 'part', 'un-noticed', 'love', 'how', 'dance', 'coming', 'end', 'then', 'where', 'dance', 'step', 'got', 'time', 'became', 'junkie', 'video', 'will', 'rewind', 'rewind', 'rewind', 'rewind', 'get', 'dance', 'down', 'pack', 'became', 'addicted', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'order', 'something', 'Marc', 'Santa', 'Maria', 'again', 'might', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'addicted.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'club', 'person', 'sure', 'do', 'want', 'go', 'just', 'show', 'dance', 'moves', 'off..It', 'was', 'good', 'investment', 'me..if', 'love', 'dance', 'can', 'endure', 'fast', 'pace', 'routines', 'dear']",Rhythmica: Dance Cardio Party
