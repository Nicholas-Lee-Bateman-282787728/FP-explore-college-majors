The premise was weak in my view, the Phantom goes to Coney Island, I just could'nt buy it.  But even more far fetched, why would Christine go there?  And the characters of Meg and her Mother seemed to me to be the complete opposites of the characters in Phantom.  I really think it could have been better.  But I lied it nonetheless.

1515014,AY8JV2D8A80EK,B006GHA9QQ,Amazon Customer,"[7, 12]","When I first heard of a Phantom sequel, I was excited, but also had my doubts.  Phantom phans can be vicious and I knew that for some the idea of a sequel smacked of heresy.I immediately grabbed the London Recording and was enthralled by the music.  Beneath The Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, and Till I Hear You Sing were amazing.  Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess were absolutely incredible and the entire piece resonated with me.The recording had a few miscues like Heaven By The Sea, but overall, I was entranced.The show hit with mixed to negative reviews and immediately underwent a rewrite.  It is the results of those rewrites that appears on this video.Let me start off by saying that while the 2nd Act has remained largely unchanged, with the exception of the final scene.  The 1st Act, however, has been heavily modified.  The show starts off with Till I Hear You Sing, and completely excises Heaven By The Sea and a majority of the prologue.A central plot element is also tweaked.  In the original concept, Christine and Raoul are invited by Mr. Y (The Phantom) to perform.  The only ""trick"" the Phantom plays on the De Chagney's is in hiding his true identity.In the modified plot, Christine and Raoul are invited to New York by Oscar Hammerstein to perform at a new Opera House he is opening and they are ""intercepted"" at the pier by The Phantom's ""freaks"" and brought back to Phantasma.  Raoul is coaxed out of his room on the premise to meet Oscar in the bar downstairs.  This allows the Phantom to sneak into and confront Christine.  Christine is then ""forced"" to sing ""Love Never Dies"" due to a veiled threat the Phantom makes towards the safety of her son, Gustav after the end of ""Once Upon Another Time"".  This makes the Phantom a much darker character, delving, again into the darkness seen in the first show.  It's obvious that Erik has no problems murdering (including children I suppose) those who would thwart his plans.While this could be a bit more true to his character, it also makes him more schizoprenic.  In one scene he's threatening Gustav with bodily harm, and after he discovers Gustav's true parantage, he decides to leave ""all that he has ever made"" to his son.  This just comes across as too extreme.  The Phantom just seems to travel the whole emotional arc a bit too quickly.  In the original plot, the Phantom doesn't have to threaten Christine to get her to perform, so he doesn't quite have so far to travel from Dr. Mengele to Dr. Huxtable""Dear Old Friend"" has also changed in tone.  I always saw this song in my minds eye as being sung through gritted teeth and forced smiles.  This is because in the original, Meg and Madam Giry seem to be well aware of Christines impending visit to Phantasma.  In the new version, Christine is not supposed to be there and Meg and Christine sort of bump into each other.  The song starts out very sincere and then changes in tone as each participant suspects they've been played, both by the Phantom and by each other.  I like watching the smiles change to grimaces as they perform their final toast.Overall the production values and filming of this show are fantastic.  The set design is amazing, especially during ""The Beauty Underneath"", and ""Love Never Dies"".The one weakness of the show is the fact that Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne are not Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  Yes, I know that is a shallow argument, but Karimloo and Bogness bring a fierceness and chemistry that literally leaps off the CD.  This chemistry is also apparant in their performance during the 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom Of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall.  Had this production had those two in it, this would have been a 5 star production in my mind.Lewis and O'Byrne are capable, but I never truly bought Lewis as the Phantom.  O'Byrne was much better as Christine, and her scene with Gustave in ""Look With Your Heart"" is brilliant.The other weakness is that this show never reaches the musical heights of the original CD.  Many people feel, including myself, that this is one of ALW's best scores, and it is truly showcased in the CD.  The score feels smaller in this production and not as glorious.  I understand changes were required to tweak the show.  And believe me, I don't grieve the loss of the painful ""Heaven By The Sea"".  But this show just never quite hit the heights of the original CD.Overall this is a great show and I am thrilled that ALW decided to give everyone a chance to view it.Make no mistake, this is no ""Phantom Of the Opera"", but it is no ""Starlight Express"" either and that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing!",4,Best seen with an open mind.

1515015,AY4R8JIZO1LBH,B006GHA9QQ,A music fan,"[3, 5]","I had the chance to catch LND in a local movie theater the other night as it was playing for one night only.  Being a big Phantom fan, I thought I'd give it a try.  And while this show does not hold a candle to POTO, on its own I think it holds up rather well.  It has all the hallmarks of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical - if someone were to play a random song from it, I could pretty easily guess the composer was ALW without any hints.The basic story line is that 10 years after POTO has ended, Phantom has moved to Coney Island (naturally) and started his own show there that features Meg Giry with Madame Giry overseeing it.  Christine and Raoul are now married with a son, Gustave, who is 10.  Raoul is a real douchebag it turns out - an alcoholic and a gambler - and apparently not very good at basic math.  The couple is broke, and the Phantom manages to lure them to Coney Island with the promise of money if Christine will perform one time.  When they find out that their benefactor is the Phantom, well you can just imagine how everyone feels. The rest of the show basically deals with Christine being torn between two lovers (again) and also facing the fact that Gustave is actually the Phantom's son.  That's right, Raoul - it only takes one night. Ten years ago. Do the math!I found parts of the story a bit contrived at times and there were a few points in the show where I actually had to muffle my laughter when things got a bit campy.  But on the flip side, there were some beautiful songs, especially ""Til I Hear You Sing"" and ""Devil Takes the Hindmost"" (whatever that means).  Also (and I realize this means I have way too much time on my hands), POTO took place in 1881.  LND takes place in 1907.  That's not 10 years later, but you just have to go with it.  As far as the cast, I thought they were stellar.  And I thought it was filmed beautifully.  You would have had a hard time noticing this was filmed on a theatrical stage and not a sound stage because it had such great camera angles and excellent lighting.So rather than overanalyze it and try to compare it to POTO, it's probably best to judge it on its own merits, and that's why I give it 4 stars.  Great cast, beautiful music, and beautifully staged and filmed.",4,"Not perfect, but beautiful and haunting",1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2243,"['had', 'chance', 'catch', 'LND', 'local', 'movie', 'theater', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'playing', 'one', 'night', 'only', 'Being', 'big', 'Phantom', 'fan', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'try', 'show', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'POTO', 'own', 'think', 'up', 'rather', 'well', 'hallmarks', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'musical', 'someone', 'were', 'play', 'random', 'song', 'could', 'pretty', 'easily', 'guess', 'composer', 'was', 'ALW', 'hints.The', 'basic', 'story', 'line', '10', 'years', 'POTO', 'ended', 'Phantom', 'moved', 'Coney', 'Island', 'naturally', 'started', 'own', 'show', 'Meg', 'Giry', 'Madame', 'Giry', 'overseeing', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'are', 'now', 'married', 'son', 'Gustave', 'who', '10', 'Raoul', 'real', 'douchebag', 'out', 'alcoholic', 'gambler', 'apparently', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'basic', 'math', 'couple', 'broke', 'Phantom', 'lure', 'Coney', 'Island', 'promise', 'money', 'Christine', 'will', 'perform', 'one', 'time', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'benefactor', 'Phantom', 'well', 'can', 'just', 'imagine', 'how', 'everyone', 'rest', 'show', 'basically', 'Christine', 'being', 'torn', 'two', 'lovers', 'again', 'also', 'facing', 'fact', 'Gustave', 'actually', 'Phantom', 'son', 'right', 'Raoul', 'only', 'one', 'night', 'Ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', 'math', 'found', 'parts', 'story', 'bit', 'contrived', 'times', 'were', 'few', 'points', 'show', 'where', 'actually', 'had', 'muffle', 'laughter', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'bit', 'campy', 'flip', 'side', 'were', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'especially', 'Til', 'Hear', 'Sing', 'Devil', 'Takes', 'Hindmost', 'Also', 'realize', 'have', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'POTO', 'took', 'place', '1881', 'LND', 'place', '1907', 'not', '10', 'years', 'later', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'As', 'far', 'cast', 'thought', 'were', 'stellar', 'thought', 'was', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'noticing', 'was', 'filmed', 'theatrical', 'stage', 'not', 'sound', 'stage', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'camera', 'angles', 'excellent', 'lighting.So', 'rather', 'overanalyze', 'try', 'compare', 'POTO', 'probably', 'best', 'judge', 'own', 'merits', 'why', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'Great', 'cast', 'beautiful', 'music', 'beautifully', 'staged', 'filmed']",N/A

ALW has created the second musical with the same magical formula that the original did, only this time he has managed to include parts of the original that actually help this one. In various points in LND you hear notes or lines from POTO which underscore the story he is trying to tell without altering this story. this means that people who have not seen POTO can watch LND without needing the backstory, while those that have can get the extra layers that the music provides.the actual recording of this musical is good, it focuses on the people singing or those using the fantastic sets. the only reason I have not given this musical 5 stars is because I  think they filmed the wrong one.

1515018,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B006GHA9QQ,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 5]","I was very exited when I saw this blu ray for sale Phantom of the Opera is one of my favorite musicals and I also love many of Andrew Lloyd Webber's works, I must say however that I am a little disappointed. Now some critics of this musical complain about the story but I think the story itself is fine. Most musicals do not really have that exiting stories, you see them for the music, take Cats for example is is basically about a bunch of cats having a party to determine which of them get to be reborn, there it is not so much going on but the music is awesome. Love Never Dies have a ok enough story for a musical, I actually got quite interested in it, and while it is just a basic love triangle story it is not bad. Basically what happens is that ten years after the end of Phantom of the Opera it is made clear that the Phantom survived, he Madame Giry and Meg have moved to New York and started a side show. In the meanwhile Christine have become a famous opera star but her marriage to Raul is in trouble as he has become a drunkard and have gambled away all of their money. Christine comes to New York to hold a concert to earn money for her husband and the story from there is rather predictable, but it works.The problem with this musical is the music itself, it is boring. Now there are few songs, mostly people sing what they are saying in a conversation, the problem is when there is no rhyme that just end up sounding forced, of the actual songs there is few is memorable. In Phantom of the Opera there are so many great songs, and they are catchy to, you can listen to them once and be humming them in the shower for weeks. In this new musical the only two songs I can really remember is Love Never Dies and Devil Takes The Hindmost, all else just is a mass of music, yes it is pleasant, it is nice to listen to, but it says absolutely nothing and is for the most part bland.Another problem I have with this musical is that everyone are A**holes. In Phantom of the Opera sure the Phantom was a villein but you could sympathize with him, this time around he is an obsessed idiot, Madame Giry and Meg do everything for him, Meg going so far as to prostitute herself so he could have the money to start his sideshow, and he toss them aside, he also threaten to kidnap Cristine's son. Raul who is the night in shining armor in the first musical is now a drunk, unpleasant fool which treat his wife and son as nothing, something which bothers be for off course it happens that the once night in shining armor turn out to be a jerk, however in a romantic story that sort of realism is not what you want to see. Meg Giry tries to kill a kid ad so on, I know I am mentioning some spoilers here but seriously why is all the characters portrayed this way. Now I love to see layered characters and even down right villains, but when everyone are jerks it get really hard to care for their fate in what is a love tragedy.One thing I do like in this musical is the set, the Phantom's sideshow is wonderfully strange and Gothic, everything look beautiful. I also love the actors, they can both act and sing and they do an amazing job, the little boy has a bit to squeaky voice but all in all the cast is amazing. Another thing I do like is that they never show the Phantom's face. Now this is something that bothers me in most film and musical versions of The Phantom of the Opera, there is really no way to do the make up properly. The Phantom is supposed to be so ugly that he makes people faint, even die of fright, but when they show his face they usually have just made him have a few scars, perhaps some unseemly birth mark. Now I know a few people which scars on their faces and they do not make you faint in fright. By just showing people's reaction to seeking the Phantom without his mark they convey so much more about the horror of it than if they had shown his face with cheap makeup.All in all Love Never Dies is pretty weak, the songs, the story and all of it can not hold a candle to Phantom of the Opera, when that is said the story is okey, the music, while bland is pleasant and there is a couple of good songs in there, the set is beautiful and the actors are good.

It was released in Australia yesterday, so I can give a review of the real thing - not conjecture, which applies to most of the ""reviews"" so far. Before I say anything further, if you have not pre-ordered this yet, do so immediately.I haven't seen the now-closed London production, so I am unable to give comparisons, except in relation to comments I have read. ALW had decided that the show would open London, Melbourne, Broadway. But the Australian director discussed the weaknesses of which ALW was already aware. So he gave total control over all revisions and the show has ended up brilliantly. Made for theater release, the Blu-ray is 2.35:1, not the figure given above. As I have a habit of writing l-o-n-g posts, I will keep this short. I saw the revised stage show here in Melbourne where the film was made, thought it to be among the best musicals I have seen. I think you will find many of the objections have been dealt with.The show, in my mind, has emerged as being among ALWs best works, and the ability to see close-ups in the disk made the balanced flow of story and music more easily recognized. Universal have done a first-rte job in transferring the show to the screen. There have been no compromises, no cuts other than handling some sene transition in a manner better suited to the screen.The first act (the Blu-ray has no such division) is really spectacular, and the story gets darker as it progresses. Acting, singing, sets, costumes, orchestra and conductor all play their roles in a way that could not be bettered.So, to summarise: a great show, especially for ALW fans who enjoy his more serious work, beautiful video direction, image quality good without quite managing demonstration standards. Sound is exemplary, doing real justice to voices, diction and the orchestra. And at its low price (presumably because of the inferior initial version) and good Blu-ray technical standards, why are you waiting.

1515030,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B006GHA9QQ,Byron Kolln,"[5, 10]","Filmed during its triumphant Melbourne run at the Regent Theatre, this sparkling production of LOVE NEVER DIES does mend a lot of the problems that the show suffered during its earlier troubled London incarnation.  With a lavish new set and costume concept by Gabriela Tylesova and a fabulous cast of new faces and old favourites, it has earned the praise of Lord Lloyd Webber, and most recently closed at Sydney's Capitol Theatre after a limited 12-week run, which was attended by sell-out, capacity houses.Ten years after escaping to New York with the aid of Madame Giry (Maria Mercedes) and her daughter Meg (Sharon Millerchip), the Phantom (Ben Lewis) has established himself as a showman amid the freaks and oddities of Coney Island, where he has installed Meg as the headlining act of ""Phantasma"", his vaudeville theatre.  But he's still haunted by the memory of Christine, the beauteous young girl from the Paris Opera who inspired his creative hand but left him heartbroken.  When he learns that Christine (Anna O'Byrne) has been invited to America to sing for Hammerstein, he devises a plan to divert her journey to Coney, where he hopes she'll sing a new aria he has written especially for her.  Accompanied by her husband Raoul (Simon Gleeson) and their ten-year-old son, Gustave (Jack Lyall), Christine's world seems perfect, but once again confronted by the Phantom, she is also faced with finally dealing with the ghosts of her past...Set ten years after the events of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", the passage of time has severely corroded the familiar characters who return for the sequel.  In the original, Christine was the nave opera ing&eacute;nue, petrified and yet intrigued by her fascination with the Phantom.  Now at last, Christine has recognised, perhaps too late, their special bond, as she tells her son Gustave - ""Love is not always beautiful...make sure you don't forget...love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret"".  The love of Christine and the Phantom has only intensified during the ten long years since he disappeared without trace from the Paris Opera.  When they finally come face-to-face once more, Christine must make a final choice of where her heart truly lies.Critics are always going to find major cracks within the veneer of LOVE NEVER DIES, but the Australian production, under the tight direction of Simon Phillips, finally presents a far more satisfying alternative to the problematic London production.  The London production was a frustrating animal, its various gathered elements almost but never *quite* clicking to create an organic whole.  In the Australian production, the story (slight as it may be) flows seamlessly under Andrew Lloyd Webber's beautiful score (which has undergone significant cutting and re-shuffling since the London opening).Playing the Phantom and Christine are two relative newcomers - Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne.  Anna O'Byrne was one of the Christine covers/alternates in the last few legs of the latest Australasian tour of ""Phantom"", and has the most breathtaking voice - she's also one of the most physically-beautiful Christine's I've probably ever witnessed.  Although Ms O'Byrne is still quite young, I'm guessing in ""real life"" Christine was probably only in her late-teens/early 20's when she married Raoul and would have only just hit 30 when LOVE NEVER DIES takes place.Ben Lewis gives us a more soulful, mellow Phantom, yet still quite menacing when he wants to be (for instance his threatening to do away with Gustave in order to force Christine to sing at ""Phantasma"").  Most Phans feel that Raoul is treated quite shabbily in LOVE NEVER DIES.  The sequel sees Raoul as a bitter, alcoholic mess who cares little for Christine or their son, and squanders the money she makes singing in drinking and gambling.  We're now far away from the starry Paris Opera roof where Raoul sang his devotion forevermore with ""All I Ask of You"".  To be fair, Raoul's character is explored quite sensitively in this new revised LOVE NEVER DIES, and Simon Gleeson's performance is fantastic.Having earlier played Meg in the original Australian company of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", it is truly a delight to have Sharon Millerchip, a three-time Helpmann Award winner, back in the role for LOVE NEVER DIES.  Meg is a far more prominent figure in the sequel, and is a much more sympathetic, tragic figure than how she was drawn in the London production.  Maria Mercedes is a steely, powerfully-sung Madame Giry, the former Paris Opera ballet mistress who is now reduced to overseeing the garish kick-lines in ""Phantasma"".In the period since LOVE NEVER DIES temporarily closed for revisions in London (before folding altogether), Andrew Lloyd Webber has re-shaped his score, with Glenn Slater and original ""Phantom"" lyricist Charles Hart also adding a few new touches.  It's significantly different from what is heard on the 2010 original cast album - and mostly for the better.  Phantom now sings ""Till I Hear You Sing"" right at the top of the show, Meg has some added material about her excitement of being reunited with Christine, ""Dear Old Friend"" has a lot of new lyrics, ""Heaven By the Sea"" has been completely taken out; and there's much more of the original ""Phantom"" included, which is lovely.  For instance, Christine sings ""Twisted Every Way"" in her dressing room before the music of ""Prima Donna"" sweeps her on to the stage of ""Phantasma""; and there's a few reprisals of the 'You have come here' lair motif.LOVE NEVER DIES, it seems, will never be accepted by the serious Phans (who've been campaigning against the sequel ever since Lloyd Webber first announced he was writing one), and that is a shame.  Especially because this particular production, so beautifully staged and put together, is ""Phantom""'s equal in every possible way.  Believe me, I too adore ""Phantom"" (it's still my all-time favourite theatre experience) and it took a lot of persistence from me before I embraced what Lloyd Webber has tried to achieve in LOVE NEVER DIES.  There's a lot to love about this show, just give it a chance.  I cried when I saw it at the Capitol and had the exact same emotional reaction with the DVD.

1515032,A12AY3UEE23A7S,B006GHA9QQ,"Carol Flores ""carflo""","[2, 3]","First a couple of notes to those who have never seen this production on DVD.  The characters do not all have moles on their foreheads, but microphones.  If seen live, I don't think the microphones could have been seen at all.  I just ignore them just like I ignore the concert style mics used in the Royal Albert Hall, 25th Anniversary production.  Also, there are many discrepancies in time line and in character and even in plot from the live production and the movie.  I am as willing to suspend disbelief for this production just as I did for the book, the old movies and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fantastic play.It is not quite as good as the original Phantom.  The music is as beautiful, but the lyrics are not  as good as the the original Lloyd Webber Phantom.  Every once in a while, the lyrics jar a bit.***Spoiler below***However, I have read the lyrics to the original Love Never Dies, and this is a great improvement and not just in lyrics.  From what I can tell from reading those lyrics, the original play had a catastrophically bad ending.  Thank goodness the folks in Australia did quite a bit of ""cleaning up.""  I am not happy with the current ending, but at least I can use my imagination and change it.Mr. Lewis who plays the Phantom is a bit melodramatic in his acting, more like the acting in an opera which, like everything else, is subordinate to the voice of the singer.All of the above being said, this is a wonderful musical and a wonderful production.  I wish I could have seen it in Australia to get a much better vision of the working of the sets which I found very impressive.  The singing was magnificent and the music was as good as any by LLoyd Webber (and certainly better than JC Superstar).  Mr. Lewis has a wonderful baritone which I have always preferred to tenor anyway.  Ms O'Bryne has a beautiful voice also.  Her makeup is a bit heavy, but probably not for a theater and she is as beautiful as the Phantom thinks she is.  Maria Mercedes has a wonderful (if short) solo which shows she can belt them out as well as any Broadway legend.I was not happy with it when I first saw it, but since then it has become an addiction and I watch it almost every day - and it gets better each time I watch it.  Ben Lewis is very good looking as the Phantom (with his mask on) and not as bad as the orignal Phantom, but worse than Gerard Butler in the movie, with it off.  You have to be able to stop the DVD at just the right spot to see him.Whatever it's flaws this Andrew Lloyd Webber step child is a beautiful work with soaring music and singing.  It also has a very sexy duo between the Phantom and Christine that is more explicit than Past the Point of No Return.Anyway, I now love it as much as the original Phantom which I have in three versions:  the movie, the Royal Albert Hall 25th anniversary production and the original cast album.  But this Phantom is a very calculating and dangerous man, but still more worthy of Christine than the other two.  He is less hot headed and a little more sane than the previous Phantoms.",5,"Not quite as good as The Phantom, but very very good",1348012800,"09 19, 2012",2012,3056,"['First', 'couple', 'notes', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'production', 'DVD', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'moles', 'foreheads', 'microphones', 'seen', 'live', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'microphones', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'just', 'ignore', 'just', 'ignore', 'concert', 'style', 'mics', 'used', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'production', 'Also', 'are', 'many', 'discrepancies', 'time', 'line', 'character', 'even', 'plot', 'live', 'production', 'movie', 'am', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'production', 'just', 'did', 'book', 'old', 'movies', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'fantastic', 'play.It', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Phantom', 'music', 'as', 'beautiful', 'lyrics', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Phantom', 'once', 'while', 'lyrics', 'jar', 'bit', '***Spoiler', 'below***However', 'have', 'read', 'lyrics', 'original', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'great', 'improvement', 'not', 'just', 'lyrics', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'reading', 'lyrics', 'original', 'play', 'had', 'catastrophically', 'bad', 'ending', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'folks', 'Australia', 'did', 'quite', 'bit', 'cleaning', 'up', 'am', 'not', 'happy', 'current', 'ending', 'least', 'can', 'use', 'imagination', 'change', 'it.Mr', 'Lewis', 'who', 'Phantom', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'acting', 'more', 'acting', 'opera', 'everything', 'else', 'subordinate', 'voice', 'singer.All', 'above', 'being', 'said', 'wonderful', 'musical', 'wonderful', 'production', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'Australia', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'vision', 'working', 'sets', 'found', 'very', 'impressive', 'singing', 'was', 'magnificent', 'music', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'LLoyd', 'Webber', 'certainly', 'better', 'JC', 'Superstar', 'Mr.', 'Lewis', 'wonderful', 'baritone', 'have', 'always', 'preferred', 'tenor', 'anyway', 'Ms', ""O'Bryne"", 'beautiful', 'voice', 'also', 'makeup', 'bit', 'heavy', 'probably', 'not', 'theater', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Phantom', 'Maria', 'Mercedes', 'wonderful', 'short', 'solo', 'can', 'belt', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'Broadway', 'legend.I', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'then', 'become', 'addiction', 'watch', 'almost', 'day', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'Ben', 'Lewis', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'Phantom', 'mask', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'orignal', 'Phantom', 'worse', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'movie', 'off', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'DVD', 'just', 'right', 'spot', 'see', 'flaws', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'step', 'child', 'beautiful', 'work', 'soaring', 'music', 'singing', 'also', 'very', 'sexy', 'duo', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'more', 'explicit', 'Point', 'No', 'Return.Anyway', 'now', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'Phantom', 'have', 'three', 'versions', 'movie', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', '25th', 'anniversary', 'production', 'original', 'cast', 'album', 'Phantom', 'very', 'calculating', 'dangerous', 'man', 'still', 'more', 'worthy', 'Christine', 'other', 'two', 'less', 'hot', 'headed', 'little', 'more', 'sane', 'previous', 'Phantoms']",N/A

I agree with some reviewers in that Love never Dies is completely different. It's style is more gothic but the score is still very memorable. I love Ben lewis' portrayal of the phantom in this particular production. I also love Ramin Karimloo in POTO. However, I prefer Ben Lewis for Love Never Dies because the whole production is so different. He is meant to sound older, darker, more masculine. At this point in the story, he is a broken man pining for his lost love. I love his deep baritone voice and the way he is stylized is almost vampiric, like he has truly become a Coney Island freak. I think Lloyd-Weber meant for that.  His facial expression and body language were particularly moving and believable. I also loved Sierra Boggess in POTO and she is incredibly talented in other productions as well. Again, this is a wholly different production. Anna O'Byrne was a perfect Christine for this production. Andrew Lloyd Weber cast the  Lewis and O'Byrne for a reason. Their voices are very complimentary. They have such great on screen chemistry. They really knew how to act for the theatre and for the camera. One thing POTO fans can appreciate is the use of dramatic entrances and exits and the use of gas lights and smoke. There are a couple of particular scenes that come to mind. When Christine first gets off the boat, and walks into the crowd of paparazzi, the music and for and lighting make it look like she's walking out of a dream...It's beautiful. Also, the phantom's entrance prior to ""Beneath a Moonless sky"" is breathtaking. There are some tid bits of POTO lyrics. For example, when the phantom sees Christine get off the boat, he sings,"" I am your angel of music, come to me angel of music.""About the camera...I understand that they wanted a really dramatic look. They intended for it to look more like a movie, less like a theatrical show. I wish they would have zoomed out more and shown the scene changes. It seemed like there was too little time between each song to really let the songs sink in. Still, the sets, costumes, score, and performances were phenomenal. Just wish I could see it live!

Like Mr. Llyod webber is going to be able to pull off a sequel to phantom of the opera. ( which was not needed in my opinion.)I thought this muscial sequel was going to be a big flop. Boy was I wrong. Love never dies is spectacular. And it does not take away the magic of the first one.The music is so sweeping and just as powerful as the music to phantom of the opera. The sets were full of vibrant colors and I loved the opening scene of coney Island when all the freaks come out of the circus tent. It was interesting to see what happend to the characters after Phantom but at the same time I hated the changes because it was like they all did a three sixty or one eighty. For example, the phantom to me seemed less mysterious and the fact that christine apparently went back and had a child by him, dosen't really make sense especially since she seemed repulsed by him in Phantom 1 and choose Raoal over him. But then again Raoal became a bit of an ass and a drinker in the sequel, so I guess it makes some sense.And the changes in Meg and madame Giry I also hated. Why would Meg kill christine all because she now wants the phantom? This makes no sense to me since in Phantom 1 the audience was never shown any hostility between Christine andMeg.They were like best friends. Not to mention meg was terrified of the phantom. I think Love Never Dies is easier to look at as a stand alone piece rather then a sequel. But despite some flaws in the story and continuation as well as the annoying way that they had to ryhme every lyric. The sets are stupendous, the costumes wonderful, the singing and the acting are excellent.

Second, there are some surprises in this production that are very interesting - primarily, that the attitudes of Raul (the Vicomte) and Meg Geary (the daughter of Ms Geary who rescued the Phantom from his captivity) have changed drastically from 'Phantom'; I guess time makes changes in all our characters, and you will have to accept that in order to enjoy this whole thing.

Nothing on earth could ever compare to Phantom, but this stands on it's own. The characters seem realistic considering the time-lapse.  The set design and costumes are so dazzling - I'd be surprised if they didn't get complaints from the Orchestra. It enveloped me into it's world.  The music was passionately melodic with wonderful lyrics containing universal ideas on love and life.  So much like Phantom, but with a different kind of darkness.  So much regret and longing.  I was enthralled with all my essense viewing this on Blu-ray.  The  first few songs were gorgeous and hooked me right in.  I kept waiting for it to fail and just when I thought it would, it soared!  The only thing that upsets me is that I wasn't aware of this great production to have seen it in the theatre.  I can't wait to familiarize myself with the songs.  I know over time I will grow to love it more.  Sir Andrew Loyd Webber made NO MISTAKE in taking such a risk.  It works and hopefully at some point pays off. I couldn't help but imagine Baz Lurhman reconstructing this project into a movie.  It has so many qualities I imagine he could build on.

1515048,A1B86SJOKGAZ3B,B006GHA9QQ,"E. Sadowski ""marine sis""","[9, 13]","Look, I won't go into what this beautiful musical is about since others have already said plenty . My biggest issue with some other reviewers, NOT all, is that too many are stuck on the original ""Phantom of the Opera"". POTO is wonderful but I don't consider any one musical to be a masterpiece. As a matter of fact, I judge them each on its own merits and some I like more than others. Personally, I like ""Love Never Dies"" better than ""Phantom of the Opera"". It would profit others to be more open-minded to the musical.Furthermore, I am thoroughly impatient with snobs who are very nit picky and demand that events more closely resemble the original Gaston Leroux book. Grow up,already! So the sequel has nothing to do with Leroux's book but is based on ""Phantom of Manhattan"" which I never did read just the original. Just for your information, a sequel DOES NOT mean it should be a continuation of the same plot line. Sequels are meant to move the story along. So, LND takes place in America on Coney Island which is a place with which I am familiar. In the early 1900s it would be a perfect place to hide anonymously among people whom society deemed misfits and not fit to socialize among the rest of the population. Besides, Andrew LLoyd Webber mentioned in an interview that he always considered POTO to be a cliffhanger and he always wanted to do a follow-up musical for the past 20 years.Also, some have issues with how the characters have changed from the original. Well, if anyone went through a traumatic experience such as the fire at the Opera Populaire then peopledo change for the better or the worse. Some become weaker, some stronger depending how deeply those individuals are affected. Christine, Erik, Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry would not be the same people as before the fire. As for the continuation of the date line and other minor points not making sense to others I say: yada, yada, yada! The Australian version was reworked and for those who DO possess an imagination pretend that there is no continuation flow. I did and it works great! Again, that falls under nit picky, nit picky, nit picky! Please DO grow up!Lastly, to each his own. If you've given this musical piece a chance and still don't like it, well, that's that.

1515049,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B006GHA9QQ,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","""Love Never Dies"", with music by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber with Lyrics by Glenn Slater/Additional Lyrics by Charles Hart is beautiful. The original production which opened in London a few years back met with a cold response. Although I never saw it, I did end up eventually falling in love with the music and listen to the London Cast Recording often. Shortly after the show's premier, it was re-tweaked - certain plot elements removed, scenes shuffled around and although the principal songs were left intact, the changes made did impact the overall production. This new production was launched in Australia to some critical acclaim and this is the show Webber decided to immortalize here.The plot is set 10 years after the events of the original story and centres around the 3 main characters:The Phantom (Ben Lewis), now living in New York's Coney Island and owner of ""Phantasma"", a Coney Island amusement park.Chrisine Daae (Anna O'Byrne), a famous French soprano. She is summoned by composer Oscar Hammerstein to sing for him in a New York opera house.Raoul - Vicomte de Chagny, now married to Christine. They have a 10 year old son Gustave. Raoul is now an insecure, bitter alcoholic who is constantly clashing with his young wife.Also returning from the original story are Meg Giry and Madame Giry. Meg who is no longer a ballerina, she performs in the Phantom's vaudeville show and has dreams of stardom while Madame Giry is a bit more questionable. She remains loyal to the Phantom but questions his motivations and is angered that he shows little interest in Meg.When Christine is summoned to sing in New York by the famous composer Oscar Hammerstein, the Phantom, upon knowing Christine is in town, intercepts and has members of his troupe pick her up at the pier along with Raoul and Gustave. The Phantom, who for years has longed to be reunited with Christine, wants her to sing at his ""Phantasma"" and has written a song specifically for her. The story is laced with love, bitter love, passion, obsession and betrayal and at the centre of this is the always vulnerable Christine who again has to chose between the 2 polarizing men in her life.Simply put. I love this show. This newer version of this relatively new show moves much better than the original staging which did have a lot of unnecessary scenes. The most obvious revision was with the Phantom's song ""Till I Hear You Sing"" which was moved from the middle of act 1 to the opening number. Although ""Love Never Dies"" is very different than the original ""Phantom"", Webber's music is varied and still majestic with its sweeping melodies and glorious orchestrations. The original was darker. Its location and time, the Paris Opera house in the late 19th century, demanded a more classical tone. Webber succeeded and created some hauntingly beautiful songs and mock operas with some dark, atmospheric music. Although ""Love Never Dies"" is a follow up, it is a totally different animal. There are lesser moments of operatic grandeur and since it takes place in the confinement of a Coney Island amusement park, there are a whole array of quirky, colorful images and characters. The music fits this scene. It is sumptuous with the Phantom and Christine, as expected, having the best tunes of the bunch but unlike the original musical where Raoul didn't really have a solo number, he is given a great tune here (""Why Does She Love Me""). The songs here are not as instantly catchy so it may take a few extra listens for the viewer/listener to appreciate the full beauty of some of these melodies but once embedded in your head, you may find yourself humming several of these tunes. Some of the score is very reminiscent of ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", even ""Cat's"" and despite some less than memorable numbers, the positives in the score far outweigh the negatives.Many have complained about the drastic changes to the characters. Unlike some reviewers, I find these changes refreshing. As much as I love ""Phantom of the Opera"", with the exception of the Phantom and that Grande Diva ""La Carlotta"", the characters are a bit bland. Raoul and Meg for instance, were a bit boring. Meg especially is under-utilized and severely under-developed. Although Christine herself was interesting in the sense that she sang the best tunes in the show (she is in almost every scene), she spends most of her time in a trance so there is not much range of emotion and she was far too nave to excite any real sympathy (I think this is where the movie worked, because Rossum's youth made this naivet&eacute; believable). That was then, this is now as Raoul, Meg and Madame Giry have been turned to more complex characters, loud, selfish, maybe not as likeable but so be it. They are the complete opposite to how they were portrayed in the original musical. Raoul's drastic transformation is believable to me because, well, we didn't really get to know him in the original piece. He was simply a stiff, rich pretty boy who was in love with Christine and who was more than willing to place her, the love of his life, in danger to try to capture the Phantom during the staging of his ""Don Juan Triumphant"". Also a lot can happen in 10 years. The guy is made more human and this is not far-fetched. The 2 main characters remain the same overall. The Phantom remains as obsessive, as dangerous, as loving as ever; although more human, we do not see many magic tricks here. Christine, although more mature, still retains the charming characteristics of a decade earlier.The leads are great. Ben Lewis (The Phantom) and Anna O'Byrne (Christine) are both fantastic with solid vocals and great stage presence, delivering just the right amount of emotion. I am very picky with stage Christine's. After watching Rebecca Caine's (Canadian Cast) sublime performance in Toronto 2 decades ago, I have not been able to find a Christine that commanded my attention the way Caine did  (and I've seen the show 18 times). O'Byrne is almost as spellbinding. She is beautiful and the score really shows off her wonderful soprano. While the original musical was the ""Phantom's"" show, this is clearly Christine's show. Simon Gleeson is also noteworthy for portraying the sometimes really unlikeable but far more interesting-this-time around Raoul, Vicomte de Chagney. While Raoul was a cookie cutter pretty boy with no real personality the first time around, he is an embittered, angry-at-the-world failure here.The costumes and sets are wonderful. Despite not having any crashing chandeliers or subterranean lakes, the musical is a spectacle. The Phantom's lair this time around is more modernized. Gone are the thousand, melting, flickering candles. It is now an overwhelming, crazy maze of steel, smoke and mirrors.Some of the highlights include:""Till I Hear You Sing"" - An emotional ballad sung by the Phantom. Beautiful and melodic. Ben Lewis' rich tones are splendid. A great opening scene.""The Coney Island Waltz"" - Originally this was an instrumental piece. This revised version is a full blown ensemble piece with added lyrics. It is visually a spectacular number.""Look With Your Heart"" - A lovely ditty sung by Christine and her son Gustave. A bit sugary but Webber's melody is so sweet and O'Byrne's vocals soar.""Beneath A Moonless Sky"" and ""Once Upon Another Time"" - This entire scene between the Phantom and Christine during their first reunion is a powerful one. ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"" is one of my favorite songs from the musical and noticed changes were made to the lyrics.""The Beauty Underneath"" - Although this song sticks out like a sore thumb since the screeching guitars and drums differs from the romantic strings of previous songs, it works. The melody is infectious and the mix of the 2 voices, the Phantom and the young Gustave, is a good combination.""Why Does She Love Me"" - Showcases Raoul in all of his tormented glory.""Love Never Dies""- I love this song. Christine's aria written specifically for her by the Phantom is beautifully sung by O'Byrne and here, she is a site to behold. If ever there was a number where the costume and set take centre stage, it is this one. However Webber and O'Byrne's talents ensure that we are not mesmerized just by the scenery, but the music, the voice, the performance all contribute to making this a fantastic scene.The DVD/Blu-ray picture quality is sharp and the sound quality is fantastic. Watch this on a big screen with the volume turned up for maximum effect. A ""Making of"" documentary with cast interview is also included. Overall, a beautiful transfer.""Love Never Dies"" works for me as a sequel and as a standalone piece despite the drastic changes. Those enamored with the syrupy romance of the original may find plenty to dislike here as this tale deviates considerably from its predecessor and as previously mentioned, the stark changes in character personalities may be hard for many to swallow. I do find this to be Webber's best musical since ""Sunset Boulevard"". Taking into account the setting, the music successfully captures the era and the love songs in typical Webber fashion are gorgeous. The score may sound repetitious at times and there are also brief moments in the score where melodies from Webber's original piece, ""Little Lotte"", ""Twisted Every Way"", are mixed in with the new, but there is no denying the beauty that permeates the score. When the Phantom burst into his songs and Christine beautifully sings her aria showcasing her delicate soprano, it all comes together to create a certain magic. The Phantoms return may not please all but if you are accepting of it, you may find yourself surrendering to the music all over again.",5,"A Gorgeous, Sumptuous, Glorious Production that Deserves a

1515056,A3MAX2X7VK8EWB,B006GHA9QQ,"Hallauthor ""Tom A""","[27, 37]","Where to start, where to start? OK, the beginning.Like a lot of Phantom fans, I was nervously expectant when I heard that ALW was fashioning a sequal to Phantom of the Opera. Now let me say that I am not a fan of musicals per se. The ONE exception was Phantom, which I fell in love with and saw several times. From the special effects, to the performances of Michael Crawford and his successors, to the wonderfully realized re-telling of the compelling tale, I thought it was a flawless theatrical experience. A good sequal would have been wonderful, but outside of The Godfather, sequals have a spotty history at best. Still...one could hope.My first red flag came when I heard that Love Never Dies was to be set in Coney Island. Coney Island? Novelty acts and roller coasters? For my Phantom? WHAT??? How does one go from the Paris Opera House to Coney freakin' Island? OK, deep breath. It can still work, right?Wrong.Almost everything about Love Never Dies falls flat. First fatal flaw; the Phantom has a pedestrian entrance. Its so pedestrian its basically a non-entrance. Using suspenseful anticipation is a key to great art; Hitchcock was the master, and ALW used it beauitifully in Phantom. Where was the Phantom? Is he watching us now? When will he return? No such element in LND. Although disappointed by this beginning, the opening number itself is wonderful and Phantom-worthy.Second red flag however, occurs during the Phantom's first number and is the Phantom himself. If ""story"" is primary, as ALW contends in interviews, how did the Phantom get younger in the intervening 10 years? Indeed, age is a problem with the entire cast. As the story unfolds, Madam Geary is the same age as when we last saw her in Paris, Meg is the same age without having matured emotionally at all, Raoul is the same age, Christine is the same age.As for Raoul, he has been reduced to having become a degenerate gambler and drinker. The only interesting thing about him is that he and Christine have managed to have a son, Gustav. Gustav is...wait...wait...10 YEARS OLD. Of course, story being everything for ALW, Gustav COULDN'T be the Phantom's son because we learned in the original that his disfigurement also prevented him from partaking in the ""Joys of the flesh."" That little detail apparently has been forgotten/tossed aside/ignored so that we now understand who little Gustav's real father is. This is not so much a red flag as it is a king sized red sheet.The rest of the play's progression reads like a Lifetime Movie. Like mother like son, son is revolted by the Phantom's appearance, but learns to look beyond it. Raoul and the Phantom have a confrontation in a seedy bar. ( This was the funniest scene in the play. I half expected Raoul to break a beer bottle in half and tell the Phantom he was gonna cut him.) Christine's fate is sealed by an errant gunshot.The opening number and The Beauty Underneath are wonderful. Outside of those, the music is utterly forgettable. The sets pale in comparison, magic and execution to the original. The voices of the players are all quite wonderful and appropriate. The acting is well, um, acting. The Phantom here does not have enough nuance and is far too broad. Raoul is cartoonish, but that may owe as much to the book as to the actor. Christine is portrayed ably, but just so. Gustav's sense of wonderment is a little too much, Madam G has become Norma Desmond and Meg needs lithium more than any character who's trod the boards.As for the other reviews on Amazon, I have to say I was totally shocked to see the number of 5 star reviews. Either ALW has a lot of relatives working the site, or there are a lot of people out there with very low standards who had a poor grasp of the original Phantom plotline and production.The biggest challenge after watching this poorly fleshed out affair will come when The Phantom next comes to town.

1515057,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B006GHA9QQ,HAMLET,"[6, 10]","I just finished watching Love Never Dies, and it is a spectacular production. I was excited from the second I heard that it was being shown in theaters (albeit for a limited time), but I was disappointed when I realised I couldn't go see it. So, one of my relatives was kind enough to pre-order it for me on DVD.In spite of what Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber said, I think it's absolutely vital to see The Phantom Of The Opera (the stage show AND the 2004 film version) before viewing Love Never Dies, as the original is referenced several times throughout Love Never Dies, in dialogue, music and song. Some songs even sound like the musical equivalents of several songs from The Phantom Of The Opera (I don't mean that as a put-down in any way; merely an observation on a brilliant choice of music and lyrics by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and Glenn Slater).The story is absolutely gripping. Plenty of drama, story, spectacle and show-stopping songs in the vein of The Phantom Of The Opera. A job bloody well-done.My favourite songs from this production are Til I Hear You Sing, Look With Your Heart, Beneath A Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, The Beauty Underneath, Devil Take The Hindmost and Love Never Dies. However, every song is top-notch. Well-written sequel.

1515058,A17771LTRWSKQ5,B006GHA9QQ,Helen S. Lam,"[1, 2]","I am a HUGE fan of the Phantom of the Opera (POTO) so I really wanted to love ""Love Never Dies"" (LND), the sequal to POTO.  It is a beautiful play without any comparison to POTO.  In a comparison, it still falls short of POTO.  However, since it's cheap to rent/buy this DVD, I still recommend it.REASONS TO SEE LND - 1) The Phantom, Christine and Raoul are more ""human"" in LND.  They show more emotions so the audience can relate to them more on a personal level.  Each one of them is flawed but I still wanted all of them to be happy. The Phantom is no longer a cold Angel of Music but a feeling human being who shows his vulnerable side and fights to get back his Christine.  There is more dimension to this Raoul and I was very touched by his parting note to his wife.  Christine is very conflicted between the 2 men who love her.  Each actor portrays these characters perfectly.  2) The child actor who plays Christine's son Gustav adds to the play.  He is pint-sized but what a great voice!  3) The set is beautiful.  Many scenes remind me of Cirque du Soleil.  I was wowed by the crystal obelisks that contain live actors who are dressed up as oddities - a mermaid, a shaman, a 4 legged man, etc.  What eye candy!REASONS I STILL LOVE POTO MORE - 1) The songs in LND never strike a chord with me the way the songs in POTO did.  There is no iconic ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""Music of the Night"", ""All I Ask of You"", or ""Masquerade"" songs.  The only two songs that are somewhat memorable are ""Devil takes the Hindmost"" and the song that the Phantom composed for Christine for her last performance (I assume it's called ""Love Never Dies"").  However, they still do not compare to any of the above songs in POTO in the music or the lyrics. 2) It's not necessarily a bad thing but the costumes in LND is so much more modern that it is hard to believe only 10 years had passed between the two plays.  It seems like a whole century had passed.I think the key reason why LND did not do well in England and Australia is that POTO is still playing and thus it overshadows LND.  When given a choice between the well-established POTO and the newbie LND, most probably went for POTO.  I bet LND would have done MUCH better if POTO were no longer playing.",4,Good but does not compare to The Phantom of the Opera,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",2012,2244,"['am', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'POTO', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'LND', 'sequal', 'POTO', 'beautiful', 'play', 'comparison', 'POTO', 'comparison', 'still', 'short', 'POTO', 'However', 'cheap', 'rent/buy', 'DVD', 'still', 'recommend', 'it.REASONS', 'TO', 'SEE', 'LND', '1', 'Phantom', 'Christine', 'Raoul', 'are', 'more', 'human', 'LND', 'show', 'more', 'emotions', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'one', 'flawed', 'still', 'wanted', 'be', 'happy', 'Phantom', 'no', 'longer', 'cold', 'Angel', 'Music', 'feeling', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'fights', 'get', 'back', 'Christine', 'more', 'dimension', 'Raoul', 'was', 'very', 'touched', 'parting', 'note', 'wife', 'Christine', 'very', 'conflicted', '2', 'men', 'who', 'love', 'actor', 'characters', 'perfectly', '2', 'child', 'actor', 'who', 'Christine', 'son', 'Gustav', 'play', 'pint-sized', 'what', 'great', 'voice', '3', 'set', 'beautiful', 'Many', 'scenes', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'was', 'wowed', 'crystal', 'contain', 'live', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'dressed', 'up', 'oddities', 'mermaid', 'shaman', '4', 'legged', 'man', 'etc', 'What', 'eye', 'candy', 'REASONS', 'STILL', 'LOVE', 'POTO', 'MORE', '1', 'songs', 'LND', 'never', 'chord', 'way', 'songs', 'POTO', 'did', 'iconic', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Music', 'Night', 'Ask', 'Masquerade', 'songs', 'only', 'two', 'songs', 'are', 'somewhat', 'memorable', 'are', 'Devil', 'Hindmost', 'song', 'Phantom', 'composed', 'Christine', 'last', 'performance', 'assume', 'called', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'However', 'still', 'do', 'not', 'compare', 'above', 'songs', 'POTO', 'music', 'lyrics', '2', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'costumes', 'LND', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'hard', 'believe', 'only', '10', 'years', 'had', 'passed', 'two', 'plays', 'whole', 'century', 'had', 'passed.I', 'think', 'key', 'reason', 'why', 'LND', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'England', 'Australia', 'POTO', 'still', 'playing', 'thus', 'LND', 'When', 'given', 'choice', 'well-established', 'POTO', 'newbie', 'LND', 'most', 'probably', 'went', 'POTO', 'bet', 'LND', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'MUCH', 'better', 'POTO', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'playing']",N/A

It floored me with its subtle changes in orchestrations and characterizations, which gave new emphasis to everything I already knew, yet still surprised me. The cast was huge, the settings and lighting were stunning. I only mention the 25th Anniversary re-work because it really ought to be experienced before moving on to ""Love Never Dies"".While the original play had all the right ingredients for a mesmerizing theatrical experience, ""Love Never Dies"", because of its ""newness"" has its own surprises, mysteries, shocks, comedy and a visually hypnotic world of beauty. It gives us a deeper, darker, convoluted look at the Phantom, Christine, Raoul, Gustave (their son), Mdm. Giry and Meg Giry...ten years after the Paris Opera House fire and the mysterious disappearance of a heartbroken Phantom. I really don't want to divulge any plot elements, because it's a whole new story. I will say that the music and lyrics vie for the splendorous sound of the original. Andew Lloyd Webber does something truly wonderful by sprinkling melodies and a few lyrics from ""Phantom I"" among the new score. It has an extremely comforting effect, because we are still emotionally connected, though all that unfolds on stage is its own legitimate entity.From the elite Paris Opera House to the glitzy world of turn-of-the-century Cony Island? It works splendidly, just as the underground lake took our breath away in ""Phantom I"". The whole atmosphere is near circus-like...a circus with a constant tug of war on our emotions. The second half of the show is definitely full of midnight secrets, heart-pounding suspense and looks into the souls of those characters we think we already know. Not so!""Love Never Dies"" is definitely a light-framed roller coaster ride of plunges into nightmare and ascensions into glory.

1515071,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B006GHA9QQ,Jon Thompson,"[10, 14]","I have been a moderate fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, but have particular favorites, as I'm sure most people do. Love Phantom, kinda can't get into Cats, couldn't stand Jeeves. I suppose it has to do with the way Webber bounces between major and minor keys more than anything else.However, to the point.Love Never Dies is a sequel to a story that really can't have one. I'll explain that momentarily, but speaking of just the elements of the show other than the story, the production values are first rate, the orchestrations are lovely and, in general, the score is somewhat uneven. It might have been a mistake to open the show with undoubtedly the strongest number, ""Til I Hear You Sing, Once More"". It is this show's ""Music of the Night"" and very hard to top, especially if much of the rest of the score is a light, almost lilting collection of motifs in minor keys and odd timing. Nothing much really grabs at the emotions.But none of that is the real reason this show never had much of a chance, regardless of the value of the various elements.The reason this could never work or measure up to the original story is that it was mythic, culturally iconic. It is, in short an archtype. The reason no one has ever successfully written a sequel is that there is literally no story to tell. The Phantom is rendered resolved as a character at the end of the first story. There is nothing left of him worth observing.Think of it as an archtype, a basic story that strikes at something human inside all of us, not just something that suits our personal tastes. Christine is an archtype. She represents Innocense and Purity, not just sexually, but also artistically. Raul is also an archtype, representing Brave and Noble Manhood. As an archtype story, it is inevitable they will wind up together, regardless of anything else that occurs. That is the moral, cultural, archtypal lesson: Brave and Noble Manhood deserves the prize of Innocense. In this respect, and in the way they are presented in the original Phantom show, they are rather flat, one dimensional characters, precisly because they are archtypes.The Phantom, on the other hand, is the one everyone associates with, emotionally, because it is his tragedy that contains elements with which we all identify. He has his deep obsessive love for his own work, which can only become true ""art"", at least for him, when sung by Christine. So he faces the dilemma of what exactly he is passionate about: the female or just the mechanism of her voice.At the end of the story he has to decide what has any true value, his own creations or human life, in the person of Raul. And we can even see the moment when he finally has his ephiphany that, between his own work and Christine being regarded as an actual person, one that does not share his dream and would be hurt badly if forced to share it, he realizes that reality is more important, and all his life's work is meaningless in comparison. Only then does he truly fall helplessly in love with Christine as herself, not just hte perfect voice. And makes the ultimate sacrifice for her, giving up his reason to exist. It's no wonder that he vanishes at the close of the story. Not to set up a possible sequel, but precisely because his story is told and he is, from this point onwards, nothing.The actual story of Love Never Dies is a valient attempt, but it can never rise above the purity and sharp emotional impart of Phantom, and yet will always be compared to it to its detriment.Indeed, all it can ever do is deminish the characters. In this case, Noble and Brave Raul has become pretty much a selfish jerk who gambled away all their money. Christine has now become a rather lackluster matron with not all that much to do but endure her husband's irresponsibility with stoic dignity and fuss over their ten year old son. And the change to the Phantom almost borders on the pathetic. Now he is a whiny, obsessed stalker who, when he finally reveals himself to her gets shot down rather embarrassingly. He becomes utterly powerless, unable to instill awe of any kind. In fact his interaction with Christine's son is like watching the devil bouncing a toddler on his knee and cooing over it. The image is a little bit of self-parody that can't be escaped in order to assemble the rather mundane ""who really hired Christine?"" story nonsense.Personally I don't think there exists a follow-up story for the character of the Phantom that could ever add anything to the character or even capture the pure impact of that first tale. It says it all. Anything else would be overkill.Still, as done here, it is very skillful overkill. You can put it on in the background to have the tunes going. Works quite well for that.",3,"A Noble Effort, but....",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,4722,"['have', 'been', 'moderate', 'fan', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'work', 'have', 'particular', 'favorites', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'Love', 'Phantom', 'kinda', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Cats', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Jeeves', 'suppose', 'do', 'way', 'Webber', 'bounces', 'major', 'minor', 'keys', 'more', 'anything', 'else.However', 'point.Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'sequel', 'story', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'momentarily', 'speaking', 'just', 'elements', 'show', 'other', 'story', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'orchestrations', 'are', 'lovely', 'general', 'score', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'open', 'show', 'undoubtedly', 'strongest', 'number', 'Til', 'Hear', 'Sing', 'Once', 'More', 'show', 'Music', 'Night', 'very', 'hard', 'top', 'especially', 'much', 'rest', 'score', 'light', 'almost', 'lilting', 'collection', 'motifs', 'minor', 'keys', 'odd', 'timing', 'Nothing', 'much', 'really', 'grabs', 'emotions.But', 'none', 'real', 'reason', 'show', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'chance', 'regardless', 'value', 'various', 'elements.The', 'reason', 'could', 'never', 'work', 'measure', 'up', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'mythic', 'culturally', 'iconic', 'short', 'archtype', 'reason', 'one', 'ever', 'successfully', 'written', 'sequel', 'literally', 'story', 'tell', 'Phantom', 'rendered', 'resolved', 'character', 'end', 'first', 'story', 'nothing', 'left', 'worth', 'observing.Think', 'archtype', 'basic', 'story', 'something', 'human', 'not', 'just', 'something', 'suits', 'personal', 'tastes', 'Christine', 'archtype', 'Innocense', 'Purity', 'not', 'just', 'sexually', 'also', 'artistically', 'Raul', 'also', 'archtype', 'representing', 'Brave', 'Noble', 'Manhood', 'archtype', 'story', 'inevitable', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'together', 'regardless', 'anything', 'else', 'moral', 'cultural', 'archtypal', 'lesson', 'Brave', 'Noble', 'Manhood', 'prize', 'Innocense', 'respect', 'way', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'Phantom', 'show', 'are', 'rather', 'flat', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'precisly', 'are', 'archtypes.The', 'Phantom', 'other', 'hand', 'one', 'everyone', 'emotionally', 'tragedy', 'elements', 'identify', 'deep', 'obsessive', 'love', 'own', 'work', 'can', 'only', 'become', 'true', 'art', 'least', 'when', 'sung', 'Christine', 'So', 'dilemma', 'what', 'exactly', 'passionate', 'female', 'just', 'mechanism', 'voice.At', 'end', 'story', 'decide', 'what', 'true', 'value', 'own', 'creations', 'human', 'life', 'person', 'Raul', 'can', 'even', 'see', 'moment', 'when', 'finally', 'ephiphany', 'own', 'work', 'Christine', 'being', 'regarded', 'actual', 'person', 'one', 'not', 'share', 'dream', 'would', 'be', 'hurt', 'badly', 'forced', 'share', 'reality', 'more', 'important', 'life', 'work', 'meaningless', 'comparison', 'Only', 'then', 'truly', 'fall', 'helplessly', 'love', 'Christine', 'herself', 'not', 'just', 'hte', 'perfect', 'voice', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'giving', 'up', 'reason', 'exist', 'wonder', 'close', 'story', 'Not', 'set', 'up', 'possible', 'sequel', 'precisely', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'onwards', 'nothing.The', 'actual', 'story', 'Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'valient', 'attempt', 'can', 'never', 'rise', 'purity', 'sharp', 'emotional', 'impart', 'Phantom', 'yet', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'compared', 'detriment.Indeed', 'can', 'ever', 'do', 'deminish', 'characters', 'case', 'Noble', 'Brave', 'Raul', 'become', 'pretty', 'much', 'selfish', 'jerk', 'who', 'gambled', 'away', 'money', 'Christine', 'now', 'become', 'rather', 'lackluster', 'matron', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'endure', 'husband', 'irresponsibility', 'stoic', 'dignity', 'fuss', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'change', 'Phantom', 'almost', 'borders', 'pathetic', 'Now', 'whiny', 'obsessed', 'stalker', 'who', 'when', 'finally', 'shot', 'rather', 'embarrassingly', 'utterly', 'powerless', 'unable', 'instill', 'awe', 'kind', 'fact', 'interaction', 'Christine', 'son', 'watching', 'devil', 'bouncing', 'toddler', 'knee', 'cooing', 'image', 'little', 'bit', 'self-parody', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'escaped', 'order', 'assemble', 'rather', 'mundane', 'who', 'really', 'hired', 'Christine', 'story', 'nonsense.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'follow-up', 'story', 'character', 'Phantom', 'could', 'ever', 'add', 'anything', 'character', 'even', 'capture', 'pure', 'impact', 'first', 'tale', 'Anything', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'overkill.Still', 'done', 'here', 'very', 'skillful', 'overkill', 'can', 'put', 'background', 'have', 'tunes', 'going', 'Works', 'quite', 'well']",N/A

This latest effort of Andrew Lloyd Webber just doesn't measure up to his earlier work. Sure, the sets are spectacular, costumes were top-notch, and musicality was excellent. I don't fault any of the cast or crew here.Webber's music compositions here just feel uninspired. Chord progressions are so predictable and and bit bland. Lyrics fare a bit better, but there's nothing new here. There's a reason this musical only lasted 18 months in London.I'm a fan of Webber, but I hold him to a high standard. This is not up to par in my book for him. I don't care what Webber lovers here say regarding this sequel (it's crazy to rate this 5 stars). It IS a sequel to Phantom of the Opera. By now we all know how sequels to almost anything fare these days. The track record isn't pretty.Regarding the blu-ray quality, overall video and audio is excellent, but there are way too many editing cuts to different camera angles (like a rock concert) instead of shots of the entire stage so we could enjoy the impressive sets. I know this video was filmed to allow audiences to experience close-ups of the actors and to get more of the emotion they're trying to convey, but there were too many unnecessary cuts to different angles here. Some camera operators struggled to keep a few shots in focus as well.There is one special feature (making-of) that was mediocre. It showed some backstage shots, but also used footage from the show itself. Basically, this was more of a love-fest for the Australian production and cast instead of a true making-of production of the musical itself.I'd suggest a rental before committing to buy, except for the die-hard Webber fans.",3,Meh.

1515091,A2QWEFSPX33C5L,B006GHA9QQ,Modrnknght,"[3, 4]","Let's start out by saying that I like the Phantom of the Opera films through their various incarnations, even TV hack jobs like The Phantom of Hollywood, and I really enjoyed Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical (whcih I have seen about six times), and the movie made from it...but this sequel, Love Never Dies, is one of those projects where one can't help but wonder, ""What was Webber thinking?""If you are going to move from the Phantom out of Paris, a good place to go would likely be London...but Coney Island?  Could Webber have possibly cheapened the character any more than by taking him from the granduer of the Paris Opera House to an actual freak show on Coney Island?  I don't think so.  And it is in this new setting that the production automatically gets into trouble.  When the Phantom was the single ""freak"" in the original musical, he was someone you could sympathize with, though be repelled by physically and for his persona.  Putting him amongst a lot of evil freaks of Coney Island is something that I am sure others besides myself found not only off-putting, but repulsive.  Many of these characters are out of your worst nightmare.And then we come to a plot that really stretches your belief.  First off, that Coney Island is where he would come to and set up shop as the mysterious owner of this carnival, but that Madame Giry and her daughter Meg would not only follow him there but work for him.  And Meg is in love with the Phantom.  Yes, I know, that is going some distance for the original musical's characters.  Then into this ugly land comes Christine and Raoul, believing herself summonded to perform for Oscar Hammerstein. Okay, now, I won't spoil any more of the plot, but where I left off is the ""point of no return"" with any possible suspension of our believing in the story.There is one thing I have to say about the production as a whole...it's very sleep-inducing, especially the first part of the second act.  I fell asleep the first two times I tried sitting through it, and only barely made it on the third.Music-wise, I hoped to find at least a few songs that might be nice additions to POTP, but with the slight (and I mean very slight) exception of the title tune, there is nothing here to indicate that Webber had anything to do with the music at all (except for one or two musical passages from the original POTO production that have new lyrics).  You don't come away from this humming any notable tunes.Talent-wise, Ben Lewis makes an adequate Phantom.  Anna O'Burne is a very lovely Christine, and has a beautiful voice to match, which she gets a chance to really use in the second half.Picture quality is excellent, as likewise is the the audio.  I ave no complaints in these departments.The only extra is a 15-minute ""making of"" featurette, and while it is supposedly HD, it looks SD.I wouldn't recommend this as a purchase, even to diehard Phantom musical fans.  You might like to just catch it if it shows up on Netflix or the like, but I can't guarantee you will want to see it all the way through.

1515092,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B006GHA9QQ,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[45, 117]","--------------------------------------UPDATED REVIEW BASED ON DVD PRODUCTION AS SHOWN ON PBS------------------------------As promised, I am now reviewing the actual production filmed.  What I find interesting is that it was on TV 2 and a half weeks after the video release!!  This confirms my initial thoughts that most people are rejecting it.  But I am reviewing it as a second look of the show and a first look of a new production.As with most ALW shows, the production is more sumptuous than the score.  Beautiful sets and costumes and TV direction but at the heart is a bad libretto and score (as with most ALW shows, there are great songs but the overall score is mediocre.Early on Meg and Madame Giry sing that the night that mob came for the Phantom, they found the Phantom and smuggled him to Calais then to the US.Next when Christine first sees the Phantom. the sing Beneath the Moonless Sky and sing about the night that they met.  Now, some think that it is a time after the initial show but I feel it refers to the time that they went to his lair in the original show (moonless sky -- sewers of Paris) makes sense.Taking this into consideration with the song about his escape, then the only time for the ""conception"" would be that one night where she went to his lair.  And most people agree that nothing happened there!So as I originally stated, having the boy Gustav (great French name?) being the Phntom is still a stretch beyond reason.  And this is why I stand by my one star review.Another issue is Raoul.  Phantom begins with the auction where an old infirmed Raoul buys the music box.  It is obvious that he well off with a man servant.  But at the beginning of LND, it is stated that that Raoul has gambled away his fortune.  And later on, it is stated that he is a drunk.  Another rewrite of the original.If ALW was not involved in the show, then I would be more forgiving but he stated in the program that he was incharge of every aspect of the show especially the book of the show.As I have over and over stated that the issue is not the staging but the story.  The best example I have of the staging being the issue is the show that premired at the same time as Phantom, Into the Woods.I saw the first national company of the show.  At intermission everyone was saying it was the best show they ever saw.  At the end of the show, we were all dazed on how the second act totally sunk the show.  It was so dark (in tone and texture)that it totally ruined the show. Six months later, I was in London and saw their production.  They took out the darkness and made it more of a farce.  This worked well and kept the tone very even throughout the show.  It now worked but was a bit hollow.  A few years later, I saw a production by Glen Casale in Long Beach and he combined the best of both verions and added a few improvements of his own and turned the show into the great show it is.What I am trying to say is that the problem with ITW was the direction not the book or score.  The problem with LND is the book and score and while a great director can camaflage the flaws, they cannot remove them, especially when they are as glaring as those in this show.---------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW based on London Production------------------------------------I saw the show in London just before it closed.  And I can say that the subtitle should be ""but thank God the show did!""Be warned that to tell you why this show is so bad, I will have to reveal some plot secrets.The Phantom has escaped Paris and is now in turn of the century Coney Island where he can blend with the other side show freaks.  He has built a vaudville palace and has lured Christine Daae to perform there.  Christine married Raoul who has become a drunk.  They have a son.  Madame Giry and her daughter Meg have followed.Meg has become the Phantom's ingenue but he still desires Christine.  When Christine is lured to Coney Island, Meg realizes that her chance at being the main attraction is slipping away.  This sets up a series of events that will end in tragedy.Now for the spoiler, which I guessed about 20 minutes into the show. Chistine's son is not Raoul's but the Phantom's!  Now could someone tell me where in PotO did Christine and the Phantom ever make love or just have sex.  This is just ridiculous.What's even more disappointing than the banal book is the contrived score.  Even at ALW's worst his shows usually have at least one or two show stoppers.  This score is more of a show snorer!If you are a Phantom lover, protect your memory of that show and pass this one up. Or wait until it is shown on your local PBS station (probably in the next year) as Cats, Joseph and JC videos were.UPDATE - Los Angeles times Saturday, February 25, 2012.'Love Never Dies'livesAndrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, rejiggered after chilly run in London, heads to cinemasBy David NgLet the Andrew Lloyd Webber offensive begin.The famed British composer a Phantom of the Opera seems to be everywhere this season with the revivals of Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita opening soon on Broadway and Phantom sequel 'Love Never Dies' hitting cinemas around the world next week.It's hard to believe that the celebrated composer - who has multiple Tony awards - was nearly down for the count last year when the critics and audiences delivered a knockout punch to his Love Never Dies during its London run. The highly anticipated sequel received mixed to negative reviews and closed earlier than expected in August.Lloyd Weber said in a recent phone interview from New York that the London staging ""didn't work"" and the recent Australian version that opened in Melbourne ""worked triumphantly,"" though he acknowledges that ""my involvement in Australia was that of an observer.""""There's not a lot in terms of rewriting - no new music was written for Australia, but one or two things have been rethought,"" Lloyd Webber said. ""Very small things can make a difference. One of the things I've learned in my career is that the fine line between something being huge or not is very small.""The Austrailian production will hit cinemas in the US starting Tuesday. It will be the first time that the US audiences will have a chance to see the musical Lloyd Webber said he isn't concerned that this screenings could you rode the chances of a Broadway transfer.The musical will screen in about 600 venues in North America and more in Latin America, according to Omniverse Vision, the distributor.Lloyd Webber was in New York to drum up interest or support for love never dies he said a Broadway transfer of the SDRAM production would be expensive but he remains optimistic.",1,ALW at his worst,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,6666,"['UPDATED', 'REVIEW', 'BASED',

I wasn't sure about some of the previous reviews that said this sequel would completely destroy the original story (and your childhood love of it), so I had to get it myself to decide.They were right. This adaptation feels more like a horribly rushed twisted fan-fiction in response the original Broadway, instead of a well thought-out, well composed sequel. I expected so much more from ALW. The effects and sets are BEYOND fantastic, but the actual storyline and music score are subpar.It destroys most of the original storyline, fantasy, magic, romance and everything else you loved about the original Broadway. I regret seeing this and will recommend anyone who deeply loved the original storyline, NOT watch this.The plot twist is unnecessary and just plain absurd!If you do your research, you'll see ALW based the first play on the original book from the early 1900's and then made up the sequel on his own. I feel, it was to fill some strange fan boyish void he harbored for the original story.The sequel does no justice to the original.

1515113,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B006GHA9QQ,Richard Masloski,"[2, 2]","I actually know the answer to the question posed in this review's title.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was pure gold in every way imaginable.  And being pure gold there would most certainly be the seductive urge to nurse yet again at the teats of the cash cow.  And there might not have been anything wrong in doing a sequel!  After all, as far as cinematic sequels go BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN was a much better film than FRANKENSTEIN and GODFATHER II was likewise superior to part one of the Corleone story.  Now if a story had come along that was really and truly worth the effort of coming forth with a follow-up to Eric's sad saga, then so be it. More power to all the powers-that-be concerned!But LOVE NEVER DIES tells a completely cliched, totally unbelievable, sappy, sloppy, silly story that seems to involve none of the characters from the original musical production, even though they may be tagged with the same names and similar costumes. If the original PHANTOM is heightened soap opera, these are the suds and suds only.  The story - and the song lyrics largely used to tell that story - absolutely reeks.As to Sir Andrew's music, I must say that I really enjoyed a few selections.  The opening song ""Til I Hear You Sing"" is the best number in the entire show.  It is far richer and romantic than the title song itself.  ""The Beauty Underneath"" is a catchy, driven song, as is ""Devil Take the Hindmost.""  And Christine and Gustave's duet - ""Look With Your Heart"" - is touching and tender.  These melodies - not the ding-dong lyrics - are what is worth the rather low price of the DVD.  (Unfortunately, I don't think that the soundtrack to this production has been released yet on CD.)  One thing, though, about Sir Andrew's music:  beautiful as it so overwhelmingly can be, there is much in it that sounds derivative.  I remember years ago Sir Andrew was on a talk show and told the story of how his father reminded him that one of his signature songs  - ""Memory""  - sounded much like a melody from some Italian opera.  I've noted this imitative tendency also.  In the original POTO, every time I'd hear ""Music of the Night"" I couldn't help but hear the beginning melody of the song ""School Days"".  And the driving musical intro to the main song for POTO is identical to a few licks from a piece in Prokofiev's score for ALEXANDER NEVSKY.  So it is with many of the songs in LOVE NEVER DIES: the title song has much in common with Kern's ""You Are Love"" from SHOWBOAT mixed together with another source melody which title eludes me.  Even ""Til I Hear You Sing"" sounds hauntingly familiar, with a smidgen of ""Evergreen"" in it - but the refrain is definitely bugging me because I have heard it elsewhere. It will hopefully come to me - and when it does I will add to these comments. Despite these observations, Sir Andrew is still a great, great composer.  And, despite the syrupy storyline of LOVE NEVER DIES, it is still worth a look and listen - even if just to hear some rich and rewarding music.  But be forewarned: if you wish to keep your precious memories of the original magnificent PHANTOM OF THE OPERA inviolate...then pass this one by.",2,WHY???????,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,3147,"['actually', 'know', 'answer', 'question', 'posed', 'review', 'title', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'was', 'pure', 'gold', 'way', 'imaginable', 'being', 'pure', 'gold', 'would', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'seductive', 'urge', 'nurse', 'yet', 'again', 'teats', 'cash', 'cow', 'there', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'wrong', 'doing', 'sequel', 'as', 'far', 'cinematic', 'sequels', 'go', 'BRIDE', 'OF', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'FRANKENSTEIN', 'GODFATHER', 'II', 'was', 'likewise', 'superior', 'part', 'one', 'Corleone', 'story', 'Now', 'story', 'had', 'come', 'was', 'really', 'truly', 'worth', 'effort', 'coming', 'forth', 'follow-up', 'Eric', 'sad', 'saga', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'More', 'power', 'powers-that-be', 'concerned', 'LOVE', 'NEVER', 'DIES', 'completely', 'cliched', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'sappy', 'sloppy', 'silly', 'story', 'involve', 'none', 'characters', 'original', 'musical', 'production', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'tagged', 'same', 'names', 'similar', 'costumes', 'original', 'PHANTOM', 'heightened', 'soap', 'opera', 'are', 'suds', 'only', 'story', 'song', 'lyrics', 'largely', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'absolutely', 'reeks.As', 'Sir', 'Andrew', 'music', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'selections', 'opening', 'song', 'Til', 'Hear', 'Sing', 'best', 'number', 'entire', 'show', 'far', 'richer', 'romantic', 'title', 'song', 'Beauty', 'Underneath', 'catchy', 'driven', 'song', 'Devil', 'Take', 'Hindmost', 'Christine', 'Gustave', 'duet', 'Look', 'Your', 'Heart', 'touching', 'tender', 'melodies', 'not', 'ding-dong', 'lyrics', 'are', 'what', 'rather', 'low', 'price', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'soundtrack', 'production', 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'CD', 'One', 'thing', 'though', 'Sir', 'Andrew', 'music', 'beautiful', 'so', 'overwhelmingly', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'derivative', 'remember', 'years', 'ago', 'Sir', 'Andrew', 'was', 'talk', 'show', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'father', 'reminded', 'one', 'signature', 'Memory', 'sounded', 'much', 'melody', 'Italian', 'opera', ""'ve"", 'noted', 'imitative', 'tendency', 'also', 'original', 'POTO', 'time', ""'d"", 'hear', 'Music', 'Night', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'hear', 'beginning', 'melody', 'song', 'School', 'Days', 'driving', 'musical', 'intro', 'main', 'song', 'POTO', 'identical', 'few', 'licks', 'piece', 'Prokofiev', 'score', 'ALEXANDER', 'NEVSKY', 'many', 'songs', 'LOVE', 'NEVER', 'DIES', 'title', 'song', 'much', 'common', 'Kern', 'Are', 'Love', 'SHOWBOAT', 'mixed', 'together', 'source', 'melody', 'title', 'Even', 'Til', 'Hear', 'Sing', 'hauntingly', 'familiar', 'smidgen', 'Evergreen', 'refrain', 'definitely', 'bugging', 'have', 'heard', 'elsewhere', 'will', 'hopefully', 'come', 'when', 'will', 'add', 'comments', 'observations', 'Sir', 'Andrew', 'still', 'great', 'great', 'composer', 'syrupy', 'storyline', 'LOVE', 'NEVER', 'DIES', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'listen', 'even', 'just', 'hear', 'rich', 'rewarding', 'music', 'be', 'forewarned', 'wish', 'keep', 'precious', 'memories', 'original', 'magnificent', 'PHANTOM', 'THE', 'OPERA', 'inviolate', 'then', 'pass', 'one']",N/A

For me the best of Webber is Cats closely followed by Jesus Christ Superstar... and then this great piece. I prefer it to Phantom with its murderous madness. Probably the best thing about the show is the way the songs become emblazened in the mind. This used to happen quite frequently up to the mid 1970s but nowerdays is quite rare - things are so bland. Not this show and especially not the Melbourne version. Pointless to list the many great songs except perhaps to point out that 'Dear Old Friends' gets much better treatment in the revised version than the sarcastic original, and 'Ten Long Years' is more dramatic. The story line is much improved - the Phantom foxier - and the over-the-top number 'The Beauty Underneath' is rescued somewhat by the dramatic staging, which was incredibly effective on stage but loses some of its dramatic impact on Blu-Ray.The Blu-Ray gives emphasis to the characters and has a close perspective. This works well as a representation of the fine acting and singing, but misses some of the drama of the incredible stage props. I cried the first time I heard the title song and found it highly moving and impressive in Melbourne, but on the disk the wonderful peacock stage is somewhat diminished. Anna O'Byrne as Christine is a new star of the stage, with her classically trained voice and noble profile creating a truly magnetic performance. And isn't the little boy remarkable?

1515118,AW54VHNI1HKSY,B006GHA9QQ,"Robert Vargo ""Random Thoughts""","[5, 5]","I reeeely wanted to like this performance. I must admit I only found it mildly entertaining. The script stretches every which way with no obvious justification or direction. In this follow up to ""Phantom of the Opera"", Raoul and Christine find themselves in New York AND mostly in Coney Island - yes, Coney Island. The Phantom has taken up residence there with a freak show and seems to have brought the two lovers (now married and packing a ten year old son) to New York under the pretense of Christine's appearing for the impresario, Oscar Hammerstein I. Without getting into the plot; there isn't much of one here - the performers must be given their due, making much of the nothing they've been given to speak. They have even less to sing; there is only one memorable song in the entire performance; ""Love Never Dies"" - which had it's initial incarnation in a number sung by Kiri Te Kanawa ""The Heart Is Slow To Learn"". I think the better choice would have been to stick to the original lyric. Those offered in this performance have little meaning and are slightly repetitious.The most disappointing aspect of this blu-ray is the minimal, flat, crammed audio - it has no depth, width or dynamic range. You'll be hard pressed to hear the difference in quality or stereo imaging between the 5.1 and 2.0 audio choices. Switch back and forth - you'll see what I mean. So, this long awaited sequel (by me) to the classic Phantom musical falls flat in my estimation and joins the embarrassing company of the ""Les Miz"" concert at Albert Hall for reeeeely crappy audio. The lack of expertise in some of the concert blu-rays and the annual Tony Awards leads me to wonder where all the capable audio people have gone. Is there something in Vegas; a convention or continuing product show? There can be no excuse for poor, sub-standard audio in this day and given the current paradigm. Even more confusing is the fact that both Lloyd-Webber and Cameron Mackintosh gave the ""go"" to releasing their material with inferior audio!In closing, this production is an eye full!

1515125,A2M936H1RSLS5Z,B006GHA9QQ,Steven Schafersman,"[2, 3]","Love Never Dies--the Melbourne, Australia, production--is a beautiful musical with amazing costumes, sets, design, and production. This is all first-rate with the highest production values. Lloyd Webber's music is simply wonderful. Extremely melodic, romantic, and beautiful. I am going to buy the Blu-ray version just for the music and production. The music is characterized by LW's recognizable style, rhythms, and orchestration. He captures all the human emotions perfectly with lovely melodic and tonal music of the highest craftsmanship. I am truly in awe of his musical genius.Although the story of Love Never Dies follows by ten years that of Phantom of the Opera, and this has been described as the sequel to Phantom by LW himself, LND is not Phantom II. The Phantom acts and appears differently here, and the characters' situations and motivations are different. This does not bother me in the least. This musical can stand on its own, and its music certainly does.Unfortunately, I cannot give this musical five stars. What were Lloyd Webber and his librettist thinking? Why was this story set in Coney Island, New York, rather than the obvious choice of London. Aren't there plenty of carnival and sideshow performers there? Coney Island seems to me to be a remote and uncharacteristic setting for romantic musicals. I read that this musical got poor reviews and its Broadway production was canceled (although the Australian production I viewed was a revision and quite excellent). (SPOILER ALERT for what follows; details can be learned in the Wikipedia article if you wish.) The reviews and cancellation were wise decisions, since the worst aspect of this musical by far is that the ending is insufferably sad. Believe me, no one wants to come away from a musical that has this ending. Even though there is a moment of touching consolation for the Phantom at the very end, it is simply cruel to subject the protagonist (and us) to so much unwanted tragedy. What musical theater-going customer wants to pay to experience such sadness and subsequent depression? Lloyd Webber is not Verdi. He should save the tragedy for kings, queens, princes, princesses, and other classical noble figures so we lesser mortals can achieve some sort of catharsis through their tragic ends. Perhaps he thought he was composing an opera instead of a musical. In the nineteenth century, some famous operas were revised by impresarios to have happier endings to better attract the public. Although these operas are thankfully not performed with these endings today, I can see why the popular theater-going public would prefer endings that reduce the tragic and increase the romantic, and I agree. Lloyd Webber should take note.",4,Insufferably Sad,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,2716,"['Love', 'Never', 'Dies', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'production', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'amazing', 'costumes', 'sets', 'design', 'production', 'first-rate', 'highest', 'production', 'values', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'music', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Extremely', 'melodic', 'romantic', 'beautiful', 'am', 'going', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'just', 'music', 'production', 'music', 'characterized', 'LW', 'recognizable', 'style', 'rhythms', 'orchestration', 'human', 'emotions', 'perfectly', 'lovely', 'melodic', 'tonal', 'music', 'highest', 'craftsmanship', 'am', 'truly', 'awe', 'musical', 'genius.Although', 'story', 'Love', 'Never', 'ten', 'years', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'been', 'described', 'sequel', 'Phantom', 'LW', 'LND', 'not', 'Phantom', 'II', 'Phantom', 'acts', 'differently', 'here', 'characters', 'situations', 'motivations', 'are', 'different', 'not', 'bother', 'least', 'musical', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'music', 'certainly', 'does.Unfortunately', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'musical', 'five', 'stars', 'What', 'were', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'librettist', 'thinking', 'Why', 'was', 'story', 'set', 'Coney', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'rather', 'obvious', 'choice', 'London', 'Are', ""n't"", 'there', 'plenty', 'carnival', 'sideshow', 'performers', 'there', 'Coney', 'Island', 'be', 'remote', 'uncharacteristic', 'setting', 'romantic', 'musicals', 'read', 'musical', 'got', 'poor', 'reviews', 'Broadway', 'production', 'was', 'canceled', 'Australian', 'production', 'viewed', 'was', 'revision', 'quite', 'excellent', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'what', 'details', 'can', 'be', 'learned', 'Wikipedia', 'article', 'wish', 'reviews', 'cancellation', 'were', 'wise', 'decisions', 'worst', 'aspect', 'musical', 'far', 'ending', 'insufferably', 'sad', 'Believe', 'one', 'come', 'away', 'musical', 'ending', 'Even', 'moment', 'touching', 'consolation', 'Phantom', 'very', 'end', 'simply', 'cruel', 'subject', 'protagonist', 'so', 'much', 'unwanted', 'tragedy', 'What', 'musical', 'theater-going', 'customer', 'pay', 'experience', 'such', 'sadness', 'subsequent', 'depression', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'not', 'Verdi', 'should', 'save', 'tragedy', 'kings', 'queens', 'princes', 'princesses', 'other', 'classical', 'noble', 'figures', 'lesser', 'mortals', 'can', 'achieve', 'sort', 'catharsis', 'tragic', 'ends', 'Perhaps', 'thought', 'was', 'composing', 'opera', 'instead', 'musical', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'famous', 'operas', 'were', 'revised', 'impresarios', 'have', 'happier', 'endings', 'better', 'attract', 'public', 'operas', 'are', 'thankfully', 'not', 'performed', 'endings', 'today', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'popular', 'theater-going', 'public', 'would', 'prefer', 'endings', 'reduce', 'tragic', 'increase', 'romantic', 'agree', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'should', 'take', 'note']",N/A

By then my life had gone through some MAJOR changes. For one thing my Dad died 2.75 months after I saw The Phantom of the Opera on stage (believe it or not) and my life was continuing to get worse, so my personality like the characters in ""Love Never Dies"" changed with life. What I'm trying to  say is ""Misery loves company"" especially from close friends. When I was 13 I had read ""The Phantom of Manhattan"" so it was not a surprise to me when Christine died. :(!In a class called ""Working with Young Children"" I learned that If a child is born less than a year into a marriage it most likely falls apart, which contributes WHY Christine chooses the Phantom. Furthermore, Gustave's attraction to music, and also having the same concept  of beauty as the Phantom, can be explained by the existence of the Hobby Gene. This means that because both of his parents like music, he is more likely to as well.Also gambling was popular among rich people during the time that the Phantom of the Opera was set.  This would most likely result in a lower income, which would put stress on Raoul and Christine's marriage, Which would contribute to WHY Christine chooses the Phantom.  Raoul in the original novel is immature and immature people are impulsive, and do things like drink too much, and gamble.  I know that the dates between ""Love Never Dies"" and the auction at the beginning of ""The Phantom of the Opera are correct because alcoholism causes premature aging, by reducing the amount of collagen, (which is what makes your skin look young)  by reducing amount of the antioxidant vitamin A which is important in slowing down the signs of agingBut what Meg said before she shot her sounded JUST like I was feeling by the time I was 16. (added to that my relationship with my sister had gone tough the same stages as Meg and Christine's in ""Love Never Dies"" the Australian production in the past eight years at the time) but I HADN'T killed anybody. Why? Because our undying love we've had since we were children, for our family (including pets) friends, jobs,our favorite media, hobbies, and interests, and ourselves enables us not to change when change is making our world fall apart around us, even over a period as long as ten years. We are the same people we always were because love never dies that's what misery causing change taught me, and ""Love Never Dies"" affirmed. When I saw the DVD The blocking for ""Please Miss Giry I Want to go Back"" made it look like Meg MEANT to shoot Christine. Also she has UNTREATED Bipolar Disorder, and has these symptoms:1. Feeling unusually ""high"" and optimistic OR extremely irritable2. Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about one's abilities or powers3. Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic4. Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next5. Impaired judgment and impulsiveness6. Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences7.

It destroyed the whole concept. That's why I had to block the first story out of my head completely, in order to enjoy the sequel. The acting was to mechanical for me. The best actors were Meg and the kid. Kristine was to young for her role she did not have any experience, in being a mother, wife and a lover. Phantom himself was to stiff and he is so far from Michael Crawford, like me to Michael Baryshnikov. I must have watched the first Phantom 5 times, 3 times with Crawford, and each time I watched I had chills in my spine. Even watching the movie, I had to wipe my eyes a few times. LND did not do anything for me, except a nice music. Some of the melodies repeat themselves over and over again Did ALW run out of the notes? He should have borrowed from Frank Wildhorn, he has a lot of them in his head. The ending of the story is absolutely stupid, and did not make any sense for me, besides it contradicts the original story. Kristina, who does she really love, besides her dresses? The story should have had a happy ending one, when Kristine helps the Phantom to be recognized as one of the best composers by beautifully performing his ballads. People could see the beauty in his music that would over shine his distorted face.I can go on and on about cons, but I will stop right there, because over all its pretty good show, just do not compare with the first one, if you do you will be disappointed.",2,Expected Better,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,1646,"['Pros', 'Beautiful', 'production', 'great', 'sound', 'love', 'music', 'perfect', 'floating', 'well', 'directed', 'Kristine', 'great', 'voice', 'Phantom', 'voice-acceptable', 'Cons', 'Very', 'week', 'story', 'not', 'believable', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'not', 'related', 'first', 'Phantom', 'destroyed', 'whole', 'concept', 'why', 'had', 'block', 'first', 'story', 'head', 'completely', 'order', 'enjoy', 'sequel', 'acting', 'was', 'mechanical', 'best', 'actors', 'were', 'Meg', 'kid', 'Kristine', 'was', 'young', 'role', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'experience', 'being', 'mother', 'wife', 'lover', 'Phantom', 'was', 'stiff', 'so', 'far', 'Michael', 'Crawford', 'Michael', 'Baryshnikov', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'first', 'Phantom', '5', 'times', '3', 'times', 'Crawford', 'time', 'watched', 'had', 'chills', 'spine', 'Even', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'wipe', 'eyes', 'few', 'times', 'LND', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'nice', 'music', 'melodies', 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'Did', 'ALW', 'run', 'out', 'notes', 'should', 'have', 'borrowed', 'Frank', 'Wildhorn', 'lot', 'head', 'ending', 'story', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'original', 'story', 'Kristina', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'dresses', 'story', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'happy', 'ending', 'one', 'when', 'Kristine', 'Phantom', 'be', 'recognized', 'one', 'best', 'composers', 'beautifully', 'performing', 'ballads', 'People', 'could', 'see', 'beauty', 'music', 'would', 'over', 'shine', 'distorted', 'face.I', 'can', 'go', 'cons', 'will', 'stop', 'right', 'there', 'pretty', 'good', 'show', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'compare', 'first', 'one', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A

First this show looks INCREDIBLE. Set design, lighting and costuming give the show a wonderful fantastic eerie look. Song wise nothing stayed with me. One song has a huge build up the Phantom has written an amazing song for Christmas the singing of which will have very serious consequences the tune though well sung is only adaquate and so is a huge let down. Also the story is as ludicrous as the original Phantom (maybe be more so) but because the songs are average it was more difficult to suspend disbelief. I found it hard to believe the sequence of events leading to the finale and I found the outcome improbable too. None of this is the fault of the impeccable cast who sing and smoulder well! Credit to the Australian team for doing such a good job with this material. The DVD is beautifully filmed balancing between making it clearly a filmed musical with the correct sets and lighting and using close ups etc to heighten drama on a TV screen.Keen ALW fans and those interested to see how effective filming a musical can be may be interested,just don't be surprised if the music falls a little short of expectation.",3,GREAT SETS SHAME ABOUT THE SONGS!,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1229,"['much', 'praise', 'Australian', 'production', 'LND', 'Unfortunately', 'music', 'not', 'First', 'show', 'INCREDIBLE', 'Set', 'design', 'lighting', 'costuming', 'give', 'show', 'wonderful', 'fantastic', 'eerie', 'look', 'Song', 'wise', 'nothing', 'stayed', 'One', 'song', 'huge', 'build', 'Phantom', 'written', 'amazing', 'song', 'Christmas', 'singing', 'will', 'have', 'very', 'serious', 'consequences', 'tune', 'though', 'well', 'sung', 'only', 'adaquate', 'so', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'Also', 'story', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'original', 'Phantom', 'maybe', 'be', 'more', 'so', 'songs', 'are', 'average', 'was', 'more', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'sequence', 'events', 'leading', 'finale', 'found', 'outcome', 'improbable', 'too', 'None', 'fault', 'impeccable', 'cast', 'who', 'sing', 'smoulder', 'well', 'Credit', 'Australian', 'team', 'doing', 'such', 'good', 'job', 'material', 'DVD', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'balancing', 'making', 'clearly', 'filmed', 'musical', 'correct', 'sets', 'lighting', 'using', 'close', 'ups', 'etc', 'heighten', 'drama', 'TV', 'screen.Keen', 'ALW', 'fans', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'effective', 'filming', 'musical', 'can', 'be', 'may', 'be', 'interested', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'music', 'little', 'short', 'expectation']",N/A
