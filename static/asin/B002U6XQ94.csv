I went to see them live on this tour and they were absolutely amazing.  This DVD not only captures an unforgettable concert experience, but gives you a lot of ""behind the scenes"" footage of the bands reunion, tour, and life off the stage.As for the music on the DVD, you can see from the track listing that they really did a brilliant job compiling a set list that included a bunch of songs from all of their albums!  They really played some of their most impressive stuff from My Own Prison, Human Clay, Weathered and also added in a few tracks from their newest album Full Circle! They played every song to absolute perfection and this DVD really displays the incredible talents of guitarist Mark Tremonti (one of the best guitarist ever), dummer Scott Phillips, bassist Brian Marshall, touring guitarist Eric Friedman and of course, lead vocalist Scott Stapp who is back and better than ever!I would recommend this DVD to everyone regardless of whether they are a current Creed fan or not because after seeing this DVD, there is no way you won't be a Creed fan!",5,Incredible Live DVD,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,1261,"['Creed', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'bands', 'early', 'days', 'My', 'Own', 'Prison', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'when', 'heard', 'were', 'going', 'reform', 'reunite', 'not', 'only', 'album', 'tour', 'went', 'see', 'live', 'tour', 'were', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'unforgettable', 'concert', 'experience', 'lot', 'scenes', 'footage', 'bands', 'reunion', 'tour', 'life', 'stage.As', 'music', 'DVD', 'can', 'see', 'track', 'listing', 'really', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'compiling', 'set', 'list', 'included', 'bunch', 'songs', 'albums', 'really', 'played', 'most', 'impressive', 'stuff', 'My', 'Own', 'Prison', 'Human', 'Clay', 'Weathered', 'also', 'added', 'few', 'tracks', 'newest', 'album', 'Full', 'Circle', 'played', 'song', 'absolute', 'perfection', 'DVD', 'really', 'incredible', 'talents', 'guitarist', 'Mark', 'Tremonti', 'one', 'best', 'guitarist', 'ever', 'dummer', 'Scott', 'Phillips', 'bassist', 'Brian', 'Marshall', 'touring', 'guitarist', 'Eric', 'Friedman', 'course', 'lead', 'vocalist', 'Scott', 'Stapp', 'who', 'back', 'better', 'ever', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'regardless', 'are', 'current', 'Creed', 'fan', 'not', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'Creed', 'fan']",Creed: Live

1289618,AYSLSU7966FWE,B002U6XQ94,"Greg ""gkw1982""","[8, 9]","This show was filmed right here in my hometown of Houston just a little over 2 months ago. I very much wanted to go to this show, but I was trying to save money and talked myself out of it since I had already seen Creed 4 times (many years before). As my luck would have it, the show was forever captured and released here on DVD. Anyway, I was impressed at the quality of the DVD, it looks sharp, has tasteful editing, and a respectable amount of bonus features. Still, if Creed were to put out a live DVD, I wish they had chosen a performance from their Human Clay tour or Weathered tour. Creed was a well-oiled machine back then and consistantly delivered some of the best concerts I'd ever seen, and while they are still good (the band in particular), this isn't their best.The musicianship of the band seems as good as ever. Mark Tremonti is an especially gifted guitar player who delivers some sweet yet modest solos. However, singer Scott Stapp seems a bit rough. In the past he always sounded as good as the albums, and on the band's newest album (Full Circle) he belted it out as well, but he sounds like he's struggling ever so slightly at this show. He seems to have trouble hitting some of the higher notes on just a couple occasions, and his deep voice often sounds exaggerated. Still, it's an overall solid performance and I enjoyed watching it, especially with the excellent song selection. My only complaint is that ""Ode"" and ""Rain"" didn't make the setlist, but it was worth it to hear a lot of old favorites that I wasn't expecting. While this may not be as good as a Creed show from 10 years ago, it's still a lot of fun and I'd recommend it.",4,"Great DVD, but it doesn't capture Creed at their finest",1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,1660,"['show', 'was', 'filmed', 'right', 'here', 'hometown', 'Houston', 'just', 'little', '2', 'months', 'ago', 'very', 'much', 'wanted', 'go', 'show', 'was', 'trying', 'save', 'money', 'talked', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'Creed', '4', 'times', 'many', 'years', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'show', 'was', 'forever', 'captured', 'released', 'here', 'DVD', 'Anyway', 'was', 'impressed', 'quality', 'DVD', 'sharp', 'tasteful', 'editing', 'respectable', 'amount', 'bonus', 'features', 'Still', 'Creed', 'were', 'put', 'out', 'live', 'DVD', 'wish', 'had', 'chosen', 'performance', 'Human', 'Clay', 'tour', 'Weathered', 'tour', 'Creed', 'was', 'well-oiled', 'machine', 'back', 'then', 'consistantly', 'delivered', 'best', 'concerts', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'band', 'particular', ""n't"", 'best.The', 'musicianship', 'band', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'Mark', 'Tremonti', 'especially', 'gifted', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'sweet', 'yet', 'modest', 'solos', 'However', 'singer', 'Scott', 'Stapp', 'bit', 'rough', 'past', 'always', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'albums', 'band', 'newest', 'album', 'Full', 'Circle', 'belted', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'struggling', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'show', 'have', 'trouble', 'hitting', 'higher', 'notes', 'just', 'couple', 'occasions', 'deep', 'voice', 'often', 'exaggerated', 'Still', 'overall', 'solid', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'especially', 'excellent', 'song', 'selection', 'only', 'complaint', 'Ode', 'Rain', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'setlist', 'was', 'worth', 'hear', 'lot', 'old', 'favorites', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Creed', 'show', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', ""'d"", 'recommend']",Creed: Live

1289620,A1SHIUVOIHSZJO,B002U6XQ94,"Jason A. Kentros ""SharkByte""","[2, 2]","Like most bands who embark on a ""reunion"" tour, Creed mostly stuck to their hits, including only 2 new songs from ""Full Circle"".  I love the new album, and there are several songs that would have done justice to this uninspired live performance.  The band sounds pretty tight, but Scott tries too hard to belt out the classics and oversings most of them terribly.  That's not to say that this is unwatchable by any means, but I think they could have picked a better show to use for a DVD.  Glad to see they're back, but for a live DVD this doesn't showcase their music as well as it could have.",3,"Worth watching for hardcore fans, but not their best",1264982400,"02 1, 2010",2010,594,"['most', 'bands', 'who', 'embark', 'reunion', 'tour', 'Creed', 'mostly', 'stuck', 'hits', 'including', 'only', '2', 'new', 'songs', 'Full', 'Circle', 'love', 'new', 'album', 'are', 'several', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'justice', 'uninspired', 'live', 'performance', 'band', 'pretty', 'tight', 'Scott', 'too', 'hard', 'belt', 'out', 'classics', 'oversings', 'most', 'terribly', 'not', 'say', 'unwatchable', 'means', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'picked', 'better', 'show', 'use', 'DVD', 'Glad', 'see', ""'re"", 'back', 'live', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'showcase', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have']",Creed: Live
1289621,A1Z9OQG9GZ26X2,B002U6XQ94,Joboo,"[4, 4]","First off, I just got through watching/listening to the DVD again for the 7th time. I have spent a couple more extra viewings trying to hear what the Stapp bashing is all about. Folks, not sure what you hear, but what is coming out of my speakers is a guy singing aggressively and sounding in command of the audience. He has more than enough range and power to handle all the songs. He has fantastic presence on stage and as I said, has command of the audience. Noone seemed to notice the guest guitarist butchering the back vocals on (he was way late most of the time during ""What If""), or Tremonti's less than smooth playing of ""Higher"". Nitpicks could be thrown across the whole band if we all really wanted to. Me, I enjoyed the DVD thoroughly. The setlist is full of hits and album favorites a long with new songs off their latest. The quality of the production is fantastic, the sound, both in mix and clarity is also fantastic. I say to those who have a question as to whether or not to purchase this DVD, give it a rental if you are nervous by the Stapp bashing done on some of these reviews. As far as my personal opinion, it is a definite purchase for Creed fans, no question about it. In fact, I will be upgrading to Blu-ray. My son is a big Creed fan and loves the disk, I will give it to him and get myself the Blu-ray.",4,Solid live performance,1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,1332,"['First', 'just', 'got', 'watching/listening', 'DVD', 'again', '7th', 'time', 'have', 'spent', 'couple', 'more', 'extra', 'viewings', 'trying', 'hear', 'what', 'Stapp', 'bashing', 'Folks', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'hear', 'what', 'coming', 'speakers', 'guy', 'singing', 'aggressively', 'sounding', 'command', 'audience', 'more', 'enough', 'range', 'power', 'handle', 'songs', 'fantastic', 'presence', 'stage', 'said', 'command', 'audience', 'Noone', 'seemed', 'notice', 'guest', 'guitarist', 'butchering', 'back', 'vocals', 'was', 'way', 'late', 'most', 'time', 'What', 'Tremonti', 'less', 'smooth', 'playing', 'Higher', 'Nitpicks', 'could', 'be', 'thrown', 'whole', 'band', 'really', 'wanted', 'Me', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'thoroughly', 'setlist', 'full', 'hits', 'album', 'long', 'new', 'songs', 'off', 'latest', 'quality', 'production', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'mix', 'clarity', 'also', 'fantastic', 'say', 'who', 'have', 'question', 'not', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'give', 'rental', 'are', 'nervous', 'Stapp', 'bashing', 'done', 'reviews', 'As', 'far', 'personal', 'opinion', 'definite', 'purchase', 'Creed', 'fans', 'question', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'upgrading', 'Blu-ray', 'son', 'big', 'Creed', 'fan', 'disk', 'will', 'give', 'get', 'Blu-ray']",Creed: Live
