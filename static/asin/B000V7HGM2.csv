The acting gets stronger with each episode.  I am looking forward to the day I can purchase the third season.  I did miss a few episode's and would like to catch up with anything I might have missed.  I am also looking forward to meeting Dannie's mother and what that storyline is all about.  I also would like to hear more about Kris's family background. Maybe in the fourth or fifth season??????????Thanks.,5,Excellent family fun.,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",2008,531,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'day', 'one', 'stories', 'are', 'compeling', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'likeable', 'joy', 'watch', 'acting', 'stronger', 'episode', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'day', 'can', 'purchase', 'third', 'season', 'did', 'miss', 'few', 'episode', 'would', 'like', 'catch', 'up', 'anything', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'am', 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'meeting', 'Dannie', 'mother', 'what', 'storyline', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'hear', 'more', 'Kris', 'family', 'background', 'Maybe', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'season', 'Thanks']",N/A

If you've ever wonder what 'life on small ranch' must be like this series is the perfect starting place.Its the tale of two families in the racing businness. One is the elite Davis farms, a rich family living at the top of the horse racing game. Mansions. Cars. Top Bred Horses. The other is Raintree farm, home to the Ritters, a family, who care passionately about horses but are living life day to day, struggling for survival.Enter main character Kris Furillo, a trouble girl whose trying to get her life back together after spending sometime in prison. As part of her prison rehabilitation, she begins working at horse ranch. Shortly afterward, she's bonds with spirited horse named Wildfire. Wildfire reminds Kris alot of herself. Both are lost and misunderstood by people.Kris soon completes her sentence, but she has nowhere to go. Pablo, one Raintree's horse trainer, has been watching her interaction with Wildfire for sometime. At Kris's court hearing, He offers her chance at independence, a job working for him. Kris accepts his proposal. In the process, she develops a relationship with both families.Together with Wildfire, Kris's determination and heart strikes a chord with the Ritter Family. Her racing talents and beauty attracts one, Junior Davis, the youngest family member of Davis farms. Which creates a more than a few problems. Drama and Competions aside, Kris finds a new home for herself. The discovery of a racing future.What's unique about Wildfire, is that the series does'nt portray the easy side of life. Nor does it coast through life struggles. Horseracing is what both the Ritter and Davis Families live and die for. What refreshing, is that the teenagers, don't consume their time with frivolous shopping sprees/nor do they care about how their precieved by others. They're deeply involved in ensuring their familes survival. The series has a big heart. Its worth giving it shot. Its presents good family values along the lines of The WB's Everwood and Gilmore Girls.Part family drama. Part teen love story. Your kids will love it.Just to let you know, the Fourth Season starts on Monday Jan 21 2008 at 9pm on ABC Family. Check it out. You may fall in love with the series.",5,Keep the seasons coming,1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2289,"['ABC', 'Family', 'Wildfire', 'No', 'show', 'television', 'ever', 'explored', 'racing', 'world', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'wonder', 'what', ""'life"", 'small', 'ranch', 'must', 'be', 'series', 'perfect', 'starting', 'place.Its', 'tale', 'two', 'families', 'racing', 'businness', 'One', 'elite', 'Davis', 'farms', 'rich', 'family', 'living', 'top', 'horse', 'racing', 'game', 'Mansions', 'Cars', 'Top', 'Bred', 'Horses', 'other', 'Raintree', 'farm', 'home', 'Ritters', 'family', 'who', 'care', 'passionately', 'horses', 'are', 'living', 'life', 'day', 'day', 'struggling', 'survival.Enter', 'main', 'character', 'Kris', 'Furillo', 'trouble', 'girl', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'spending', 'sometime', 'prison', 'part', 'prison', 'rehabilitation', 'working', 'horse', 'ranch', 'Shortly', 'afterward', 'bonds', 'spirited', 'horse', 'named', 'Wildfire', 'Wildfire', 'Kris', 'alot', 'herself', 'are', 'lost', 'misunderstood', 'people.Kris', 'soon', 'sentence', 'nowhere', 'go', 'Pablo', 'one', 'Raintree', 'horse', 'trainer', 'been', 'watching', 'interaction', 'Wildfire', 'sometime', 'Kris', 'court', 'hearing', 'chance', 'independence', 'job', 'working', 'Kris', 'proposal', 'process', 'relationship', 'families.Together', 'Wildfire', 'Kris', 'determination', 'heart', 'chord', 'Ritter', 'Family', 'racing', 'talents', 'beauty', 'one', 'Junior', 'Davis', 'youngest', 'family', 'member', 'Davis', 'farms', 'Which', 'more', 'few', 'problems', 'Drama', 'Competions', 'aside', 'Kris', 'new', 'home', 'herself', 'discovery', 'racing', 'future.What', 'unique', 'Wildfire', 'series', ""does'nt"", 'easy', 'side', 'life', 'coast', 'life', 'struggles', 'Horseracing', 'what', 'Ritter', 'Davis', 'Families', 'live', 'die', 'What', 'refreshing', 'teenagers', 'do', ""n't"", 'consume', 'time', 'frivolous', 'shopping', 'sprees/nor', 'do', 'care', 'how', 'precieved', 'others', ""'re"", 'deeply', 'involved', 'ensuring', 'familes', 'survival', 'series', 'big', 'heart', 'worth', 'giving', 'shot', 'presents', 'good', 'family', 'values', 'lines', 'WB', 'Everwood', 'Gilmore', 'Girls.Part', 'family', 'drama', 'Part', 'teen', 'love', 'story', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'it.Just', 'let', 'know', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'Monday', 'Jan', '21', '2008', '9pm', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Check', 'out', 'may', 'fall', 'love', 'series']",N/A
