I figured the movie would have begun with the girls making the pact and telling us why they planed to get pregnant, but instead we see a bunch of girls pregnant, some already with child and their just having babies for the fun of it. it isn't til the 55 minute mark where the pact is actually brought up. The movie actually makes the girls look dumb and naive. Some are I know 2 15 year olds and a 17 year old that were pregnant, it was  shocker to everyone....except me. I saw it coming. Regardless this is a serious issue, you can find the stats everywhere online. Ever watch MTV's 16 and Pregnant?

1388547,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0047HXMIY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","""Pregnancy Pact"" is another Lifetime Channel movie that straddles the uneasy line between well meaning social commentary and lurid melodrama. A ripped from the headlines plot is inspired by the Massachusetts case that received national news coverage involving an extremely high preponderance of high school girls getting (you guessed it) pregnant. The real life story was, without doubt, fascinating and disturbing. So I held out hope that the hype surrounding the actual circumstances might elevate Lifetime to produce an accounting of more substance than their usual output. A cast of unknowns--except the A grade talent of Thora Birch, Nancy Travis, and Camryn Manheim--is stranded with a lackluster and obvious script that hopes to illuminate the issue of teen pregnancy but really just makes everyone seem a bit (or a lot) foolish.The premise, obviously, has some merit being grounded by actual events. And the movie starts out promisingly enough. A school nurse (Manheim) pursues more awareness in the schools after having administered a ridiculously high percentage of pregnancy tests in the preceding year. Unbeknownst to the conservative authority figures, a group of girls are actively seeking to bring babies into the world. One of the primary proponents of an abstinence only education is Travis, but she soon gets blind-sided that her perfect daughter may be caught up in a bigger scandal. Luckily a roving Internet blogger (Birch) is on hand to blow the lid off the story. If it sounds a bit odd to have a blogger doing the legwork--well, it is!It all boils down to expected stereotypes--different factions and different politics--everyone is represented in some rudimentary form. The girls themselves are particularly silly--even villainous as painted by the film. The film really shies away from coming to any sort of real societal conclusions. Instead, we're treated to the melodramatic trappings of generic moralizing. With plenty of music montages, you know that healing and forgiveness can't be far behind. ""Pregnancy Pact"" takes compelling true life drama and whitewashes away any real discussion of the issues for a quick and easy conclusion. But that's really no surprise, is it?

1388548,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,B0047HXMIY,StillWaters,"[2, 5]","This movie was supposed to be based on real life events, but I'm not sure how much of it was really true and how much was made up. The teenagers are typical of what you would see in a Lifetime movie- very ignorant. The girls are portrayed as being needy girls who have sex to keep their boyfriends and expect that they are going to get married. Honestly I would rather stop seeing this stupid stereotype in movies. I know teenage girls are obviously a little naive, but come on. Many girls date different boys in high school, maybe have sex with them, and don't expect to get married. As far as pregnancy and birth control, ignorance continues to abound. The teens don't know the first thing about having a baby or caring for it. They apparently think that they can just have a baby but they won't have to pay for anything. One girl wants to have sex but is too afraid to go in and buy condoms.The teenage boys were portrayed as just going along with it and having sex without any regard for the consequences. Apparently they don't have any problem with having sex without a condom. Then when these 18 girls turn up pregnant, it's all their fault, and no blame is put on the fathers of the babies who obviously also chose not to use a condom.As far as the ""church committee"" or whatever it was, I couldn't figure out what exactly they were doing making decisions for a public school. They make the decisions about whether birth control is handed out? They pay for the day care? That is insane. There is no reason for there to be a day care at the school, when there are programs to help women pay for child care already. The movie acted as if, if there was no day care these girls would automatically have to drop out and then have no life after that. Uh...wrong. Many teen girls get pregnant and continue on with school without a day care being at the school. My own mother had me when she was in high school, and she graduated with A's and there was no day care at her school. There are social programs to help the girls out, not to mention the fact that the fathers of the babies have a legal obligation to help pay for them, and the girls have families that may also help contribute.The issue with the nurse was weird as well. Nurses at high schools give out pregnancy tests all the time? Why do they even have pregnancy tests? They can't go to a local clinic? It seems to me like the school nurse is supposed to be there to help you if you are sick or have an injury...not be a reproductive health care provider for teenage girls. The idea that the nurse gave out 150 pregnancy tests is pretty unrealistic. She kept going on and on about giving out condoms, when that would be pointless anyway because they wouldn't use them. And like I said, since when is a high school responsible for teenager's reproductive health?The blogger played by Thora Birch was a good character, although I found the ""plot twist"" at the end to be a little weird and to be kind of any obvious attempt at trying to make the movie more dramatic. Her character talks endlessly about how no one is asking the real question of why these girls want to get pregnant in the first place, and yet the movie never answers this question.",2,"Just tells a story, not much else",1309478400,"07 1, 2011",2011,3207,"['movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'really', 'true', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'teenagers', 'are', 'typical', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'Lifetime', 'movie-', 'very', 'ignorant', 'girls', 'are', 'portrayed', 'being', 'needy', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'sex', 'keep', 'boyfriends', 'expect', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'Honestly', 'would', 'rather', 'stop', 'seeing', 'stupid', 'stereotype', 'movies', 'know', 'teenage', 'girls', 'are', 'obviously', 'little', 'naive', 'come', 'Many', 'girls', 'date', 'different', 'boys', 'high', 'school', 'maybe', 'have', 'sex', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'get', 'married', 'As', 'far', 'pregnancy', 'birth', 'control', 'ignorance', 'abound', 'teens', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'thing', 'having', 'baby', 'caring', 'apparently', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'have', 'baby', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'anything', 'One', 'girl', 'have', 'sex', 'too', 'afraid', 'go', 'buy', 'condoms.The', 'teenage', 'boys', 'were', 'portrayed', 'just', 'going', 'along', 'having', 'sex', 'regard', 'consequences', 'Apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'having', 'sex', 'condom', 'Then', 'when', '18', 'girls', 'turn', 'up', 'pregnant', 'fault', 'blame', 'put', 'fathers', 'babies', 'who', 'obviously', 'also', 'chose', 'not', 'use', 'condom.As', 'far', 'church', 'committee', 'whatever', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'were', 'doing', 'making', 'decisions', 'public', 'school', 'make', 'decisions', 'birth', 'control', 'handed', 'out', 'pay', 'day', 'care', 'insane', 'reason', 'be', 'day', 'care', 'school', 'when', 'are', 'programs', 'help', 'women', 'pay', 'child', 'care', 'already', 'movie', 'acted', 'was', 'day', 'care', 'girls', 'would', 'automatically', 'have', 'drop', 'out', 'then', 'have', 'life', 'Uh', 'wrong', 'Many', 'teen', 'girls', 'get', 'pregnant', 'continue', 'school', 'day', 'care', 'being', 'school', 'own', 'mother', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'graduated', 'A', 'was', 'day', 'care', 'school', 'are', 'social', 'programs', 'help', 'girls', 'out', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'fathers', 'babies', 'have', 'legal', 'obligation', 'help', 'pay', 'girls', 'have', 'families', 'may', 'also', 'help', 'contribute.The', 'issue', 'nurse', 'was', 'weird', 'as', 'well', 'Nurses', 'high', 'schools', 'give', 'out', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'time', 'Why', 'do', 'even', 'have', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'local', 'clinic', 'school', 'nurse', 'supposed', 'be', 'there', 'help', 'are', 'sick', 'have', 'injury', 'not', 'be', 'reproductive', 'health', 'care', 'provider', 'teenage', 'girls', 'idea', 'nurse', 'gave', 'out', '150', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'kept', 'going', 'giving', 'out', 'condoms', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'pointless', 'anyway', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'said', 'when', 'high', 'school', 'responsible', 'teenager', 'reproductive', 'health', 'blogger', 'played', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'was', 'good', 'character', 'found', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'be', 'little', 'weird', 'be', 'kind', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'trying', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'dramatic', 'character', 'talks', 'endlessly', 'how', 'one', 'asking', 'real', 'question', 'why', 'girls', 'want', 'get', 'pregnant', 'first', 'place', 'yet', 'movie', 'never', 'question']",N/A
