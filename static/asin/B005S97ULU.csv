I can't wait for the continuation!!!  Having grown up in a very political town, I could relate to much of the unorthodox behavior that reigns supreme in the politics of Chicago (as with many other cities in America and around the world).

He played a psychiatrist who was beset with personal problems on every level and was hilarious. For anyone who knows him as Frasier, it is a real shock to see him as the deeply corrupt Mayor of Chicago in BOSS. He is also terminally ill with a disease which is affecting his memory and causing him hallucinations.  His main concern is staying in power for the time he has left and he will do anything to achieve this. He is a very evil guy and about as anti-Frasier a character as he could find. he has a very able supporting cast but make no mistake, he is what anchors and holds together the whole show. He does a fantastic job.  Season two begins in less than a week and I am ready for it.  This is a very dark show but excellent.

The rave reviews had me wondering what the hype is all about, but honestly it didn't intrigue me too much. However, once I watched the first episode of this dark political drama, I was sucked in. Kelsey Grammer gives a demanding performance as Tom Kane, mayor of Chicago, who is battling a life-threatening brain disease. I do wish it had a few tangents from time to time though, as the story was very much serious and agenda-driven. I will definitely be curious how this series continues to play out, and if they can keep it up, it's sure to make it's place as a classic dark drama up there with The Sopranos.Source: criticnic.com 28-July-2012Disclosure: Series sent by Lionsgate",4,Surprisingly solid drama series,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",2012,749,"['do', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'TV', 'DVD', 'one', 'was', 'curious', 'rave', 'reviews', 'had', 'wondering', 'what', 'hype', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'intrigue', 'too', 'much', 'However', 'once', 'watched', 'first', 'episode', 'dark', 'political', 'drama', 'was', 'sucked', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'demanding', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Kane', 'mayor', 'Chicago', 'who', 'battling', 'life-threatening', 'brain', 'disease', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'few', 'tangents', 'time', 'time', 'though', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'serious', 'agenda-driven', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'curious', 'how', 'series', 'play', 'out', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'sure', 'make', 'place', 'classic', 'dark', 'drama', 'there', 'Sopranos.Source', 'criticnic.com', '28-July-2012Disclosure', 'Series', 'sent', 'Lionsgate']",N/A

1498165,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B005S97ULU,D. C. Obraztsov,"[9, 13]","As an avid television viewer, I have seen series such as Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, Oz, Mad Men, among many others.  I consider myself to be pretty picky in what I watch, and I didn't even know the existence of this show until Kelsey Grammer beat out Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) for a Golden Globe for this show.  I was a little upset because Breaking Bad is one of my favorite shows and Bryan Cranston is one heck of an actor, but I realized that I couldn't complain until I actually watched Kelsey Grammer's performance.  And.....wow.  Just wow.My favorite shows aren't black and white.  I hate fairytale shows with mushy romance, happy endings, and where the writers basically dictate who is good and bad to you.  I prefer my shows with characters with a bit more grey to them.  I want to make my own decisions on how I feel about characters without the writers pushing their morals in my face.  Not many shows are capable of this, because it's one of the most difficult things in television writing - stepping aside and letting your characters come to life on their own and letting viewers contemplate and think for themselves.  Boss does all of this.  It reminds me a lot of The Sopranos with its unforgiving, brutal tone that can really shake you to your core.  It makes you THINK.The premise of the show is simple enough.  I decided to watch it On Demand without having any idea what it was about, except that it starred Kelsey Grammer.  He plays Tom Kane, the mayor of Chicago, and he undoubtedly dabbles in some ""questionable"" political practices.  The real thing here though is that Kane is diagnosed in the very first scene with Lewy Body Disease (similar to Alzheimer's), and so his mental health begins to deteriorate over time.  If you look up the symptoms of the disease, you see Kane start to really exemplify some of these symptoms, and it makes for some ominous and interesting television.One of the things about this show that makes it unique is that while the characters are grey, Tom Kane is definitely more on the ""black side.""  He isn't your typical protagonist, but more like an ""antihero.""  Tony Soprano is honestly less of an antihero than this guy.  Tom Kane cares about one thing - Tom Kane.  Family, friends, honor, loyalty, constituents, none of that matters to him, and he'll do anything it takes to stay in power, and I mean *anything.*  Kelsey Grammer is perfect for this part.  He looks like a politician, acts like one, and has such a scary presence that I can't believe I used to watch him on Frasier.  This guy will scare the heck out of you.  His acting is phenomenal and I really had no idea what an amazing actor he was.  I can't think of any other actor in the world that could play the role of Tom Kane except him.This show is disturbing.  It's brutal.  It's sick.  Twisted.  Morbid.  And it's all happening within the political system to boot.  Kelsey Grammer isn't the only good actor here.  Connie Nielsen plays Meredith Kane, Tom Kane's estranged wife.  Meredith is also highly politically-motivated and puts her self-image and politics above all else as well, and Nielsen plays it perfect.  Martin Donovan plays Ezra Stone, Tom Kane's senior political advisor and my favorite character after Kane.  He is intelligent, ambitious, and knows the game like Kane and is his most trusted advisor, and once again, he was perfectly cast.  Oh, and did I say *extremely* intelligent?  I am sick of watching political shows with dumb political advisors.  Ezra Stone is a genius and as the senior political advisor to Chicago's mayor, he damn well should be.  Kathleen Robertson (Beverly Hills 90210!) plays Kitty O'Neill, a personal aide to Kane.  She is a very interesting and confused character and incredibly unpredictable.  Hannah Ware plays Emma Kane, the estranged daughter, and she is also a complex character that I keep wanting to learn more about.  And finally, there is Jeff Hephner as Ben Zajac, the Illinois State Treasurer and candidate for the Governor of Illinois.  I can't say much of him as not to spoil anything for you, but he develops interesting relationships with several of the characters.So, did Kelsey Grammer deserve this award?  I think him and Bryan Cranston's performances were pretty neck-and-neck, with them both portraying a wide variety of emotions and were absolutely out of this world amazing.  We're talking almost James Gandolfini quality here.  So I am obviously not upset anymore over Kelsey Grammer's Golden Globe win.  This show is DEFINITELY worth your time, and is definitely way underrated.  I hope this review can inspire more people to watch so that the seasons can keep coming.  Unfortunately, it's always easer to make a killer first season drama than it is to keep that momentum for seasons to come.  But I have high faith in the abilities of the writers to keep this going strong.  Oh, and it's been signed to another season already for August 17, 2012 (and we'll get 10 episodes instead of 8).Break down:POSSIBLE PROS+Incredible acting, especially from Kelsey Grammer and Martin Donovan+Unforgivingly brutal, thought-provoking, and suspenseful+Characters are grey and open for interpretation; it's not black and white+The dialogue and writing is unbelievably good, and even lines that may sound cheesy from others come out sounding great from this set of actors.+It's pretty intense and sometimes scary, if you're into that.POSSIBLE CONS+If you're into more black and white shows with happier endings and storylines, you will find this to be a major downer.+Only eight episodes :(+There is a LOT of sex.  It's not extremely graphic, but it is heavily prevalent.  That doesn't bother me in the slightest, but sometimes it is rather gratuitous and I could see it bothering some viewers+The political system is portrayed as incredibly shady and corrupt.  If you're not a believer of this level of politically brutality and corruption (and many find it too stereotypical of Chicago politics), you may not like it.Overall, this fits right into the league of some of the best shows I have ever seen, assuming that it keeps going the way it is.

1498167,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B005S97ULU,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 6]","-----------------------------------------------------""Boss: Season One""-----------------------------------------------------America's current hate-affair with our politicians is taken to the n-th degree in this well-written but often overwrought soap opera-ish political drama, in which nearly every character is untrustworthy and unlikable. Kelsey Grammer produces the series and stars as Thomas Kane, a fictitious, uber-Machiavellian mayor of modern-day Chicago, in control of a huge political machine that can make or break anyone in the state of Illinois.  The series draws on a wealth of talent, including directors Gus Van Sant and Mario Van Peebles; one thing I liked, however, was that other than Grammer most of the cast were unknown to me, and the acting was mostly pretty good.I thought the dialogue was good as well, peppered with allusions, subtle barbs, and hidden meanings galore, well delivered by the cast. Where the writing failed, however, was in the dramatic turns and devices used to further the plot, which were frequently unbelievable and distracted from, rather than aided, the story. For a series that was supposed to show the main character's super-duper political skill, the screenwriters rely heavily on lots of clumsy, overt violence -- threatening people, beating them up, maiming them, killing them -- employed at times of crisis that would seem to call for subtlety and finesse. It's dramatic and visceral, good for TV I suppose, but it doesn't ring true as something that might happen in the real world: I don't think the mayor of Chicago, worried about unfavorable media attention, would be ordering his opponents to be so obviously bullied or injured.Comparisons with ""The Wire"" are inevitable here, and ""The Wire"" soars past this series in terms of resonance and believability. The writers of ""Boss"" are over-reliant on clumsy, thuggish violence as a way to resolve dramatic tension (and titillate the audience) and rarely do we see Mayor Kane, or any other characters, using what I would consider real political finesse to achieve their goals. Lots of graphic sex scenes, too, for what that's worth.Still, political junkies will probably enjoy this show - it echoes the cynicism of many in today's political landscape and may have the right tang for many viewers. I, however, am probably in the minority in that I don't actually believe that all politicians are by definition bad, dishonest, unprincipled hypocrites: I think most people who go into politics do so with good intentions, and while ""the system"" forces them into compromises, the picture painted here -- in which there isn't a single honorable person to be found anywhere in the Illinois landscape -- seems to me to be a bit much. Also, in this first season, which centers on the results of a gubernatorial primary, the *only* politicians we see are Democrats, and their universal sleaziness is perhaps a reflection of Kelsey Grammer's own far-right conservatism. (He endorsed Michelle Bachmann for President.) It'll be interesting to see how Republican politicians are portrayed in Season 2. Anyway, this series has some strong points and may have some legs beyond this first eight-episode run.

1498168,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005S97ULU,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 3]","You don't have to go back into the pantheon of TV dramas to find some great storylines involving politicians.  In fact, they've long been the villains and saviors in a variety of programs stretching back probably to TV's golden years.  What you would have to look long and hard to find, though, would be such an accomplished performance that Kelsey Grammer delivers in the titular role of the BOSS to premium cable channel Starz's riveting show.Tom Kane (played by Grammer) is the mayor of Chicago.  You've heard of the Windy City, no doubt?  It's the place long-rumored to have voting rolls involving household pets and the dead.  Into this world of down-and-dirty shenanigans, Mayor Kane discovers his darkest secret: he's gravelly ill.  His mind is slowly being ravaged by neuromuscular disease that's affecting his physical and mental faculties to the point where he's seeing things, and these `things' tend to more often than not take the shape of people he believes he's speaking with.  Those closest to him slowly begin to take notice in the change to his behavior, but what can they do to maintain the status quo when the pursuit of power is all that matters most?It's a captivating premise delivered with great promise.  Kane's doctors can't effectively predict how rapidly the disease will progress or render him incapable of doing his job, so there's this constant undercurrent of unpredictability tied to his behavior.  Is he doing what he's doing all to maintain his status, or is he functioning in order to belay the demands of a hallucination?  The scripts run the gamut between smaller moments of character-to-character up to the grander moments of a mayor battling his councilmen for control of the city.  While the lesser moments are nice, they're certainly not as convincing or involving as those detailing big city politics.Indeed, the central reason to enjoy BOSS is no less a stalwart performance by Kelsey Grammer.  His portrayal of Kane as the vile, despicably flawed politico calling all of the shots is absorbing on all levels.  When you can't see the wheels moving in Kane's magnetic stares and glares, you can no doubt hear `em grinding when he cries, crucifies and cajoles those around him to heed his bidding ... or else.  Even in the quiet moments - and I'm thinking specifically of the big finale that builds over the course of these several hours - he's chewing scenery like only the best Thespians of his generation can accomplish.  The fact that he's surrounded by many who complement what he brings to the role is terrific, but no one holds a candle to Grammer's magnetism here.In all honesty, there are a few weaknesses here, and I'm reserving hope that they'll be chocked up to first seasons jitters of a writing staff trying to flesh out the possibilities of several of the supporting characters.  For example, Connie Nielsen plays Kane's wife, Meredith; and it's hard to imagine her character being of much use to the program besides the usual `prostituting herself out' to her husband's pet political causes.  Nielsen does the best she can with what she's given here - that's saying plenty for her skills; I can only hope she serves a more compelling purposes in the upcoming season.  Also, Hannah Ware is largely wasted as Kane's redemption seeking daughter, Emma.  In fact, she's so wrapped up in the idea of seeking redemption they've gone and made her the equivalent of a female priest, though she fails to act like it in almost every way possible.  Her plotlines involve drugs and sex - in which she's a willing participant in both - almost as if the writers are trying to thumb their noses at the religious establishment.  Perhaps that wouldn't be so hard to swallow IF there were a single character that behaved appropriately in the complex drama, but, alas, that isn't the world created here.Also, actress Kathleen Robertson (who's absolutely stunning to look at) is utterly wasted in a season-long storyline involving politicians and infidelity.  If there's any measure of predictability to the bulk of the show, there it lies.  Hopefully, the writers will give her something of substance to do besides ""taking one for the team"" (which she appears to do quite well) as she delivers an undercurrent of poise and snarkyness for a program that could use a powerful female presence in the world of consummate alpha males.BOSS: SEASON ONE is produced by Category 5 Entertainment, Grammnet Productions, Lionsgate Television, and Boss Kane Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lions Gate.  The picture looks terrific, and it sounds even better.  There are some modest issues I encountered with the sound; however, most of them had to do with Kane's debilitating episodes and NOT spoken word issues.  Sadly, the set is kinda/sorta slim with special features; there are a few audio commentaries (not all that much is all that revelatory, either), and a brief interview cut with scenes from the show that really serves more as a promotional piece than it does anything else.  Sad.  I would've liked to see much more exploration of this modern day Greek tragedy set against the backdrop of one of America's most corrupt institutions.  Maybe a second season set will deliver more.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  It's a great program with great promise.  Grammer is Atlas here, and he's hoisted the weight of an entire production on his shoulders.  Only time will tell if the writers can deliver storylines that captivate all of the characters into achieving more than stock moments.  Granted, that may be tough given that Grammer is the focal point, but here's hoping that they're all given a bit more to do in the upcoming season.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at Lions Gate provided me with a DVD screener of BOSS: SEASON ONE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",4,BOSS: A Winning Program Built on Grammer's

That should be enough to make it a surefire purchase, but i'll try to elaborate.The basic set-up of ruthless power politics is handled well and informatively. Most characters are interesting, and Kelsey Grammer is really nice as the outwardly charming, yet utterly scary, mayor. The storyline is a nice selection of double crosses over double crosses, and most of these are plausible enough. It shows the webs of power and money, and the matter-of-factlyness of arrangements between all the structures of a city.I was on the edge of my seat for most of the episodes, and the characters will remain with me for quite some time. Though it must be said that i felt the ending failed to work properly. There is neither definite closure, nor the proper set-up for a second season. Tom Kane coming out on top of this season relies too heavily on stupid actions/inactions on the part of actors who up until becoming slobbering imbeciles are ruthless, faultless, schemers. That they suddenly decide to flip out at the pivotal moment just does not seem likely. This is a shame, as the rest of the series is so darn good.It is also weird that mayor Kane's medical condition features so heavily in the first three or four episodes, then for all intents and purposes never to be seen again.Watch it and enjoy it, but keep yourself braced for a slightly disappointing ending.(I have not watched season 2, so the lay-up may be brilliant, it might not....)",4,"Brilliant, but let down by the ending.",1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,1590,"['evil', 'ruthless', 'methodical', 'politicians', 'thing', 'then', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'occasionally', 'better', 'original', 'House', 'Cards', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'surefire', 'purchase', 'i', ""'ll"", 'try', 'elaborate.The', 'basic', 'set-up', 'ruthless', 'power', 'politics', 'handled', 'well', 'informatively', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'really', 'nice', 'outwardly', 'charming', 'yet', 'utterly', 'scary', 'mayor', 'storyline', 'nice', 'selection', 'double', 'crosses', 'double', 'crosses', 'most', 'are', 'plausible', 'enough', 'webs', 'power', 'money', 'matter-of-factlyness', 'arrangements', 'structures', 'city.I', 'was', 'edge', 'seat', 'most', 'episodes', 'characters', 'will', 'remain', 'quite', 'time', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'i', 'felt', 'ending', 'failed', 'work', 'properly', 'definite', 'closure', 'proper', 'set-up', 'second', 'season', 'Tom', 'Kane', 'coming', 'out', 'top', 'season', 'too', 'heavily', 'stupid', 'actions/inactions', 'part', 'actors', 'who', 'up', 'becoming', 'slobbering', 'imbeciles', 'are', 'ruthless', 'faultless', 'schemers', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'flip', 'out', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'likely', 'shame', 'rest', 'series', 'so', 'darn', 'good.It', 'also', 'weird', 'mayor', 'Kane', 'medical', 'condition', 'features', 'so', 'heavily', 'first', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'then', 'intents', 'purposes', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again.Watch', 'enjoy', 'keep', 'braced', 'slightly', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'season', '2', 'lay-up', 'may', 'be', 'brilliant', 'might', 'not']",N/A

The answer is an emphatic YES! Season 2  premiered this week with many of the same cast members in the same rolls, but with enough changes due to developments in the first season to change certain aspects. Kelsey Grammer continues his fine acting as Mayor Tom Kane, Connie Nielsen is his peculiar wife (with a surprise at the end of the first episode), Jonathan Groff (a very fine promising actor) replaces Kathleen Robertson who is staying with her parents during a shocking pregnancy,  Hannah Ware as Kane's daughter is in prison, Troy Garity is now editor of the Sentinel and is beginning to reveal that even honest people can be bought in this tale of Chicago corruption. Jeff Hephner, Sanaa Lathan and Rotimi continue their fine roles.As for the storyline this season, Tom Kane cements his mayoral legacy with a lavish ceremony celebrating the groundbreaking of the new modernized O'Hare terminals. Now Kane looks to the future, setting his sights on reviving a subsidized housing project. While his political future seems bright, Kane continues to battle for control over his disease. And that is where this series is serving a public service.  Kan suffers form Lewy Body Dementia and it deserves definition as few viewers have ever heard of it: according to the Mayo Clinic definition, `In Lewy body dementia, abnormal round structures -- called Lewy bodies -- develop in regions of your brain involved in thinking and movement. LBD is not a rare disease. It affects an estimated 1.3 million individuals and their families in the United States. Because LBD symptoms can closely resemble other more commonly known diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, it is currently widely underdiagnosed. In the early 1900s, while researching Parkinson's disease, the scientist Friederich H. Lewy discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain's normal functioning. These Lewy body proteins are found in an area of the brain stem where they deplete the neurotransmitter dopamine, causing Parkinsonian symptoms. In Lewy body dementia, these abnormal proteins are diffuse throughout other areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex. The brain chemical acetylcholine is depleted, causing disruption of perception, thinking and behavior. Lewy body dementia exists either in pure form, or in conjunction with other brain changes, including those typically seen in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.'So we have a new season of a fine show created by Farhad Safina,  written by Dee Johnson and Kevin J. Hynes and directed by Jim McKay that is unafraid to uncover dirty politics and concerned enough about audience medical information that it presents an important disease for us to study.

1498183,A2IA5Q0TDWE81X,B005S97ULU,Kaiser Soze,"[1, 8]","I am proposing that this Blu-ray disc be boycotted. The Blu-ray format relies heavily on scripting, so much so that the producer of a disc has almost unlimited control over the way that the player behaves, when the disc is played. Unfortunately, some Blu-ray producers with compromised ethics exploit this in a way that consumers should find intolerable, and should simply refuse to accept. Consumers had no voice in defining the Blu-ray specification, and if they had, it almost certainly would have been done in a way that would insure that when you put a disc in the player, you are able to access the movie and the menus without having to first play your way through a bunch of previews. If they want to put promotional material of this sort on the disc, the right way to do that is to make them a special feature, accessible through the disc's main menu the same as all the other special features on the disc. Many Blu-ray discs do this. The way put previews on a disc is NOT by doing it in a way such that they have to be played through before you can even access the main menu for the disc. And even if the control buttons for fast-forwarding and stepping through the previews are enable, this still does not make it acceptable to put the previews in the disc in this manner. A couple of times while watching this movie, I accidentally hit the stop button on my remote. I was not even able to resume play, and this as well is a fault of the way the disc was produced. I should have been able to resume, but was not able to do even that. Instead, I had to start over, much as though I had just inserted the disc. I had to sequence back through the previews all over again, and then bunch of other short video segments, such as the one that it promotional for DTS sound, all of which are accompanied by individual scripts that the player has to locate in order to load. It took several minutes in total to get back to where I was, and this is with a newer, fast player with a good reputation for being a fast player. I shudder to think what this would have been like on my older Pioneer Blu-ray player (which was a piece of junk). Each and every time you decided to watch this disc, you have to go through this all over again. It should not be this way. This disc was produced by people who had no sense of ethics.

Or are even those flashes just an act?  Almost everyone in this show isworking an angle, playing their cards, hoping to come out on top and not worried about who they stepon to get there.  Filled with some really surprising and often depressing turns, this is as dark a look atU.S. politics as I've seen in a long time.  And to me that makes this important viewing.  Because sadly, asover the top as the show can seem, why do I think it's much, much closer to reality than we'd all like tobelieve?As for the weak spots, there are a couple of performances in supporting roles that don't quite keep up,and especially in the first few episode a lot of gratuitous sex that feels shoehorned in.

1498188,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005S97ULU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","The world of Chicago politics takes another savage beating in the sharp and cynical Starz original series ""Boss."" Really, the city needs to get an expert PR firm on the case immediately! Any TV show or movie that features Chicago invariably paints its city offices as a hotbed of corruption and malfeasance. But that's okay Chi-Town, I won't hold it against you if it keeps producing top notch entertainment like this unexpectedly rewarding drama. In truth, I had absolutely no interest in following Kelsey Grammar into this den of inequity. I think it's fair to say, that while I think he's talented, Grammar is not a particular favorite of mine. But I'm glad I gave the show a shot. After finding the early episodes intriguing, if somewhat unfocused, ""Boss"" brought all of its disparate plot threads together in almost operatic fashion to provide some of the year's most intense drama. As all the political machinations, plotting, and back-stabbing reached fever pitch proportions--""Boss"" grew into the season's most pleasant (if rather unpleasant) surprises. Filled with great performances, the show recently scored a Golden Globe nomination for Best Drama and one for Grammar as Lead Actor.Grammar plays Tom Kane, the ruthless mayor of Chicago. He is diagnosed in the first episode with a degenerative neurological condition which he struggles to control and keep a guarded secret. Corrupted by power, Grammar has lost all vestiges of idealism that he might once have had and, in the process, seems to have pushed away those closest to him. Most of the season revolves around the state gubernatorial race as Grammar hopes to oust the current regime with someone more controllable. Past scandals, brittle and complicated relationships, palace coups, and backroom deals populate the season's eight episodes as every major character tries to advance through the maze of corruption. And in many ways, everyone is complicit in some form of wrong-doing and it will be almost impossible to remain unscathed. At the center, Grammar rules the roost in a towering performance--a terrifically despicable anti-hero. Everyone may want to take him down, but it's easier said than done!I won't recount the various plot points of the season, I think it's best to let the show unravel like a good novel. But I will say that ""Boss"" would be nowhere near as effective if it were not for the great (and huge) cast of supporting players. Everyone is great, but I'll only mention a few of my favorites. A deadpan Martin Donovan and a crisp Kathleen Robertson provide excellent support as Grammar's closest confidantes. This may be Robertson's best role to date. Connie Nielsen is an understated presence as Grammar's estranged wife, but shows unexpected importance as the episodes progress. Francis Guinan is spot-on as the current Governor and Jeff Hephner serves up a true star making role as his rival. I expect we'll be seeing Hephner more frequently if this is any indication. But at the heart of ""Boss"" is a fierce Grammar. Like the driving force within a Shakespearean tragedy, his Mayor Tom Kane is an unforgettable power player who stands to conquer all challengers. It's a big role and a great performance. A smart and savvy political drama for adults, check out ""Boss.""

1498192,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B005S97ULU,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[11, 17]","This is a really odd show. It stars Kelsey Grammer as basically Rahm Emanuel running chicago as mayor. Its good and bad. Kelsey Grammer is outstanding in the lead in an acting sense. Its probably the most ambitious and best dramatic thing he has ever done. He plays completely against type in that he doesn't look like a chicago mayor. But he has a legtimate ruthlessness in acting the part that is worthy of ""all the kings men"". And he has an almost Shakespearean quality in doing the character. The mayor is a man who becomes whatever the situation requires. He is a man who is almost lost in himself. His wife is even better in that I can't ever remember the political wife being played in this way. She is a serious person playing her own game rather than a victim or a conscience. I like most of the characters. I like the attention to detail and I like the acting. Its an antidote to the simple-mindedness of ""the west wing"" that was so influential for so many years.The only thing I didn't like was the basic premise of a man in decline (medically) and that at times they departed reality and went over the top. Drugging a woman in public in a car is silly. The whole thing with the ears was silly. They need these things for ratings but its a shame that something this good has to be brought down by that kind of nonsense.I think it would have been better to have a man breaking down mentally and gradually collapsing rather than having a man be physically ill. But they could still do good things with what they have.Its the most interesting thing on television so far this year in my opinion. Its flawed but its ambitious and a rather brave thing for television these days.--------------------------Some additional comments at the end of the first season.The show maintained its quality right to the end. Its almost at the level of an American version of the British drama ""House of Cards"". The problem with it is that everything is blown up bigger than real life and exaggerated. Its like the violence and emotion knob is turned up to ""11"". If the killings became firings (or career destruction) and acts of violent intimidation became more normal threats, it would be a much better show. And be more real. An example of something I liked was the whole bit about dealing with a crisis and dealing with TV coverage (the whiteboard). I also liked the mechanics of showing how to influence a lawsuit or a newspaper. And I especially liked the meeting with the ward bosses near the end. I liked that the candidate for governor seemed to get progressively more out of control personally the more politically popular he got. One of the best moments was when he met the retired police officer and talked about why he was who he was....and the mirror of that moment at the end where his longtime assistant explains that he has ceased to benefit the city.Where they were close to the reality of how things are done politically, they did great work. When they ignored reality in favor of overheated violence or other nonsense.The only thing that never quite worked was the daughter. Her backstory was far too complicated and contrived. And it seems that there is nowhere left to go with that character.In the next season they have potential to explore/contrast republican politics in the state with democratic (Chicago) politics in the context of a statewide election for governor. If they are as honest about those issues as they were about the politics of the city, it could be quite good.",5,very ambitious and very odd interesting show,1319587200,"10 26, 2011",2011,3492,"['really', 'odd', 'show', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'basically', 'Rahm', 'Emanuel', 'running', 'chicago', 'mayor', 'good', 'bad', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'acting', 'sense', 'probably', 'most', 'ambitious', 'best', 'dramatic', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'completely', 'type', ""n't"", 'look', 'chicago', 'mayor', 'legtimate', 'ruthlessness', 'acting', 'part', 'worthy', 'kings', 'men', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'quality', 'doing', 'character', 'mayor', 'man', 'who', 'whatever', 'situation', 'man', 'who', 'almost', 'lost', 'wife', 'even', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'remember', 'political', 'wife', 'being', 'played', 'way', 'serious', 'person', 'playing', 'own', 'game', 'rather', 'victim', 'conscience', 'like', 'most', 'characters', 'attention', 'detail', 'like', 'acting', 'antidote', 'simple-mindedness', 'west', 'wing', 'was', 'so', 'influential', 'so', 'many', 'years.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'basic', 'premise', 'man', 'decline', 'medically', 'times', 'departed', 'reality', 'went', 'top', 'Drugging', 'woman', 'public', 'car', 'silly', 'whole', 'thing', 'ears', 'was', 'silly', 'need', 'things', 'ratings', 'shame', 'something', 'good', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'kind', 'nonsense.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'man', 'breaking', 'down', 'mentally', 'gradually', 'collapsing', 'rather', 'having', 'man', 'be', 'physically', 'ill', 'could', 'still', 'do', 'good', 'things', 'what', 'have.Its', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'television', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'opinion', 'flawed', 'ambitious', 'rather', 'brave', 'thing', 'television', 'days.', 'additional', 'comments', 'end', 'first', 'season.The', 'show', 'maintained', 'quality', 'right', 'end', 'almost', 'level', 'American', 'version', 'British', 'drama', 'House', 'Cards', 'problem', 'everything', 'blown', 'up', 'bigger', 'real', 'life', 'exaggerated', 'violence', 'emotion', 'knob', 'turned', 'up', '11', 'killings', 'became', 'firings', 'career', 'destruction', 'acts', 'violent', 'intimidation', 'became', 'more', 'normal', 'threats', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'real', 'example', 'something', 'liked', 'was', 'whole', 'bit', 'dealing', 'crisis', 'dealing', 'TV', 'coverage', 'whiteboard', 'also', 'liked', 'mechanics', 'showing', 'how', 'influence', 'lawsuit', 'newspaper', 'especially', 'liked', 'meeting', 'ward', 'end', 'liked', 'candidate', 'governor', 'seemed', 'get', 'progressively', 'more', 'control', 'personally', 'more', 'politically', 'popular', 'got', 'One', 'best', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'met', 'retired', 'police', 'officer', 'talked', 'about', 'why', 'was', 'who', 'was', '.and', 'mirror', 'moment', 'end', 'where', 'longtime', 'assistant', 'ceased', 'benefit', 'city.Where', 'were', 'close', 'reality', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'politically', 'did', 'great', 'work', 'When', 'ignored', 'reality', 'favor', 'overheated', 'violence', 'other', 'nonsense.The', 'only', 'thing', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'was', 'daughter', 'backstory', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'complicated', 'contrived', 'nowhere', 'left', 'go', 'next', 'season', 'have', 'potential', 'explore/contrast', 'republican', 'politics', 'state', 'democratic', 'Chicago', 'politics', 'context', 'statewide', 'election', 'governor', 'are', 'honest', 'issues', 'were', 'politics', 'city', 'could', 'be', 'quite', 'good']",N/A

1498199,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B005S97ULU,"Ray ""A Reader""","[0, 0]","If you've watched all eleven seasons of ""Frasier,"" you probably were doubled over in hysterical laughing fits at various points of that show. ""Frasier"" is nearly universally viewed as one of the most successful comedy shows ever made, and Kelsey Grammer ""walks away"" with his comedic performance (as do the other excellent cast in that show). But after viewing that show, if you've then heard that Grammer has taken on the dramatic role as the mayor of Chicago in a serious drama, you're bound to be skeptical he can pull it off. After all, isn't he a comedian? The truth is that many great comedians simply cannot pull off a dramatic role, not for lack of talent, but because the skill sets between these two performance crafts are so different.But, as surprising as it may be, ""Boss"" is perhaps Grammer's greatest performance yet, even when compared with ""Frasier."" If you've scanned through any of the reviews of ""Boss"" here on Amazon, you've likely seen one person after another say that this is one of the best dramatic shows they've ever seen, and all I can say is that this is Grammer like you've never seen him before. He's so good that it's SCARY. (""Do you know who I am? (growling) ... I'm the Mayor of Chicago!"")""Boss"" is a serious drama about a fictional mayor of Chicago, but anyone who knows anything about the Windy City knows that this show is closely mirrored against those famous Chicago mayors, ""bosses"" of a city empire that stretches back to 1837. If you know the history of the city, ""Boss"" is like walking into the inner circle of one of those mayors, giving detail and insight into the broad story lines that have been associated with Chicago throughout the 20th century. It's nakedly tough: there's nothing polite, sugar-coated, or weak about it. It's so direct and powerful that it may catch you off guard at first. In fact, it is the opening scene of the first episode that completely shakes off any fleeting concern that this may be ""Frasier in the City."" It knocks you off your feet with a painful and open description of the life of the mayor, and then goes on throughout  the entire fist season (eight one-hour episodes) to see the story arc unfold. Grammer has said in interviews that the story is not about politics, but rather about the life story of this mayor as he clings to power. He may be right, but the story takes place within the political environment, and we can't help but feel that politics is indeed a part of this story.Grammer won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Mayor Thomas Kane (strangely enough, only two letter's away from ""Crane""), and nearly anyone who has watched the show understands why. Grammer is powerful, honest, intimidating, believable. His presence is almost like one of the gargoyles at the top of the Notre Dame in Paris, a seemingly all-knowing presence watching over the city with a medieval grimace. Although I said it before, I'll say it again: this is a scary-good performance.The supporting cast is also uniformly excellent. Casting was superbly accomplished in ""Boss,"" and each character is as believable as Mayor Kane himself. The characters are also each interesting in their own rights, with snarky, shadowy, and politically ambitious people all working with and around each other. It's really an impressive ensemble.And, on a minor note, some of the brief shots you'll see of Chicago at various points throughout the series are just gorgeous. If you are watching on Blu-Ray, the city shines and sparkles in a way that reminds us that Chicago is one of the most architecturally significant cities in the world. If you can, watch this on Blu-Ray. You'll see vistas of Chicago, both day and night, that just glitter.And yet Chicago is only a backdrop to the story of ""Boss."" ""Boss"" is about Mayor Kane's political career, his power over aldermen, his continual vying and maneuvering to keep the reins of power.There are some difficult pieces to follow in some of the episodes that may make you want to re-watch them to assemble the pieces together. But you'll almost certainly want to re-watch the series anyway, so this is not an issue. There is a lot of complexity in both the characters as well as the interwoven plot that I only made full sense of after two full viewings of both seasons.There was some talk that Grammer was incredibly upset when the series was cancelled by Starz at the end of Season Two. When you see the show, you'll understand why, and will probably share that feeling. The decision to cancel the show in Season Two must stand as one of the most incredibly stupid decisions by a television channel in recent memory. Yes, the ratings were not what they could have been in Season Two, but other things could have been done, including a ""wrap-up"" episode that doesn't leave us hanging after the events of Season Two. But don't let any of that muttering deter you. Season One stands on its own as an amazing work, and, to be honest, Season Two does, as well (but you have to accept that, if you watch Season Two, you'll be left with numerous unanswered questions and uncompleted plot lines).I used to say to my wife while we were watching ""Frasier"" that it almost seemed that Kelsey Grammer wasn't acting at all when he did that show, and that ""Frasier"" was just a fortuitous casting that allowed Grammer to be himself. I have to completely revise that view. ""Boss"" also shows Grammer as one who seems not be acting at all, so believable is his performance. I think it is difficult to now deny that Grammer is anything less than an incredibly gifted actor, and one who works hard at his roles to make them what they should be.""Boss"" is certainly going to stand for quite some time as a premier show in the genre. Five stars.Note:As with a number of television shows of recent times, ""Boss"" doesn't make any sense unless each episode is watched, and in order. If you attempt to enter midstream into the series, it doesn't work. The story lines are interwoven and build upon each other, so you have to watch these in order, starting right with episode one. (And, oh, yes, ""Boss"" is also one of those rare shows where the ""pilot"" episode is absolutely fantastic, right up in quality with all the subsequent episodes.)

I had no idea that Kelsey Grammer is such a fine actor - he's up there with Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. I'm from Texas and believe that LBJ was the most ruthless politician to ever claw his way to power. Mayor Cain is just as ruthless. But he has enough good qualities and Grammer is such a nuanced actor that we empathize with him, the same as we did for Vito Corleone in The Godfather. The plot is a Shakespearean tragedy like Macbeth or King Lear, the  dialogue, photography, cinematography and the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the actors who play the consigliere Ezra Stone, Cain's wife and daughter. There's a scene in the last episode where Cain is standing in front of a mural that I won't describe so as not to spoil it that shows his true character. There's also a hit man that is scary as hell.
