This is one of several pictures featuring legendary Pipeline surfer Gerry Lopez.  Gerry's always been one of my favorites because of how easy he makes riding the big waves look.  Whether he's riding Gum's SandBar, surfing down the line at pipe or kicking it backdoor w/ 10+ footers; Gerry has always seemed to get more barreled on North Shore than anyone -and because of that I'm extremely jealous of him!This DVD is no longer in print and is very difficult and expensive to find BRAND NEW.

Recently he has gotten typecast as a heavy, but in this film he is very ordinary but possessing surfing prowess that is remarkable.

234729,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6300269450,David Baldwin,"[3, 3]","Anybody venturing into this film thinking that this is primarily a surf film will be in for a rude awakening.  Surfing is central to the film, yes, but it is the connecting thread of the diverse lives of the film's main characters.  The film spans the period of 1962 to 1974 and catalogues the internal changes of Matt(Jan-Michael Vincent), Jack(William Katt), and Leroy(Gary Busey)as the well as the social changes that occurred during that time.  One of the more memorable sequences in the film is one where the buddies go to the military induction center and try any number of schemes to avoid being drafted.  These characters are real human beings with the foibles associated with all of us.  Any sentiment this film engenders is earned.  This is a surprisingly poignant film coming from a director, John Milius, normally not associated with sentimentality.  The film also delivers the goods as far as the surfing sequences.  The film's Great Swell of 1974 sequence is breathtaking.  I remember when this film came out in 1978 it got generally good reviews but spotty box office and release.  It did not even have a theatrical run in Philly.  Thank God for DVD where treasures like this can be rediscovered.

234732,ACNKNZSZQGZ5Q,6300269450,John Moulis,"[34, 36]","This movie is regarded as a surf classic and rightly so.  Slickly produced, consisting of a series of vignettes over 13 years it gives a non-surfing person a revealing insight into the surf culture.  The  still-thorny issue of the Vietnam War is dealt with and the transition from  the swinging sixties into the seventies is handled very well (a technique  John Milius perfected in his 1983 classic Uncommon Valor which incidentally  pre-dated the much hyped Rambo First Blood II by nearly two years).  The  climax of the film is the surf footage at the end depicting the legendary  day of a lifetime, Big Wednesday.  The only negative is the thought that  the two stars, Jan Michael Vincent and Gary Busey threw away their lives  after this movie due to drug addiction (Busey almost died from an overdose  in 1994).  Another negative is that some of the surfing terminology in the  book didn't make it to the film.  In the book, the car is referred to as  &quot;The Makeshift&quot; - it isn't in the film.

No wetsuits then-pre Jack O'Neill. Milius did an excellent job capturing that era. Sam Melton aka The Bear reminded me of my Uncle Jack Blair. Gruff, fair and experienced in all things. Every town had a trio of surfers like Leroy, Jack and Matt in those days. Probably still true but I'm the old guy on a longboard now so I wouldn't know any personally. Any surfer over 45 can relate to this movie and if anybody younger than that wants to relate to older surfers like their Dads or Uncles, they should watch this movie.

234742,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6300269450,Only-A-Child,"[4, 5]","""Big Wednesday"" (1978) is a film that was made for baby boomers. Writer/director John Milius was born in 1944 and the material draws on a ten year span of his life from the early 1960's to the early 1970's. Along with needing a span of time to qualify as a coming-of-age saga, it was hoped that the long time span would enable it to connect with the entire range of boomers (birth dates from 1945-1963). Almost anyone born during those years will find things in the film they relate to-even shadow boomers with just the second-hand exposure provided by their older siblings. Younger viewers should enjoy the spectacular surfing sequences and might find the other stuff an interesting history lesson.Milius is one of the so-called young auteur directors of the 70's (Coppola, Lucus, Spielberg, Scorsese, De Palma). Unlike the others he did very little after 1984, the year he released ""Red Dawn"", an embarrassingly moronic and histrionic right-wing propaganda film that alerted an unsuspecting world to his extremist political views. Hollywood insiders already knew about this and the Coen Brothers would use him as a model for John Goodman's character in ""The Big Lebowski"".But ""Big Wednesday"" is his masterpiece and it is unlikely that any other writer/director could have brought this story to the screen this effectively. Unfortunately its surfer subject matter did not draw many non-enthusiasts to the theatre; even though the film is a lot more than surfing, containing a very original universal message about the process of living and changing. Low box office led to a re-edit for pay- television, with the more philosophical content taken out for that version. The current DVD and VHS are that shorter version so if you saw the ""Big Wednesday"" during its theatrical release you maybe somewhat disappointed.Structured like a four act play with each transition moving the action ahead a couple of years, ""Big Wednesday"" follows three young surfers in the LA area (Jan-Michael Vincent, William Katt and Gary Busey). Each plays a talented surfer with Vincent's character approaching legendary status. Surfing plays a big part in their lives (Bruce Surtees' cinematography provides some of the most stunning views of the sport you are likely to ever see) but much of the film takes place away from the beach with scenes of parties, the induction center, Tijuana, family life, and romance (a full range of what growing up in southern California was all about).Milius' treatment of surfing is reverential and sometimes even mystical, with a sweeping musical score and local character (Bear) who is a kind of guru for the sport. In a scene cut from the television version Bear explains the origin and significance of the ""Big Wednesday"" title. Somehow Milius gets all this right and the film transcends what might have been a pretentious exercise in sport glorification.The final scene is truly special as the three main characters manage a convergence for a final day of surfing, a scene that recalls the freedom and awe of their teenage years, contrasting it with how removed they have gotten from this former way of life. Anyone who has had to choke back their emotions after a nostalgic rush reminds them of what they will never have again, will be moved my this wonderful sequence.Then again, what do I know?

Based on the fantastic reviews, I expected much better of this movie.  This is frankly, a very bad movie.  Where can I start?Clearly a low budget movie, the sound is very low quality.  Of course, that may be considered a positive given the extremely poor screenplay.  The movie starts by a series of sketches designed to show life as a teenager growing up.  The beach, the party, the quick trip to Tijuana, the girlfriend, and the older surfer mentor.  All of them very cliched like they were almost copied.  The dialog by all characters is so poor it's virtually impossible to feel emotion for the characters.  A few weak attempts at comedy are more lowlifes.The movie then moves in time to show the kids growing up.  The trip to the Draft Board and attempts to be deferred are almost incoherent.  But the most humorous part of this movie is Jan Michael Vincent's occasional flashes as a drunken street person.  Look quickly because he recovers by the next scene and is normal again.  Maybe it's a disease because next the elder surfer (resembles Greg Noll, da Bull) catches the drunken role disease.As to being a surf cult film, yes there are some early surf scenes, and the ending has a solid 10 minutes of surfing as the kids are drawn to the beach 13 years later when the surf is up.  But it's not enough to sit through 2 hours of bad movie to watch some surfing.I'm surprised this movie is rated so high by so many.  If you want a movie of growing up, rewatch American Graffiti or even Saturday Night Fever.  But not this movie.  The one large positive of this movie is watching some future stars or at least working actors and see what they were like at the start of their careers.",1,BORING,999216000,"08 31, 2001",2001,1792,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'many', 'surf', 'books', 'can', 'find', 'grew', 'up', 'Southern', 'California', 'mid-60s', 'Based', 'fantastic', 'reviews', 'expected', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'frankly', 'very', 'bad', 'movie', 'Where', 'can', 'start', 'Clearly', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'sound', 'very', 'low', 'quality', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'considered', 'positive', 'given', 'extremely', 'poor', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'series', 'sketches', 'designed', 'show', 'life', 'teenager', 'growing', 'up', 'beach', 'party', 'quick', 'trip', 'Tijuana', 'girlfriend', 'older', 'surfer', 'mentor', 'very', 'cliched', 'were', 'almost', 'copied', 'dialog', 'characters', 'so', 'poor', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'feel', 'emotion', 'characters', 'few', 'weak', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'are', 'more', 'lowlifes.The', 'movie', 'then', 'time', 'show', 'kids', 'growing', 'up', 'trip', 'Draft', 'Board', 'attempts', 'be', 'deferred', 'are', 'almost', 'incoherent', 'most', 'humorous', 'part', 'movie', 'Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'drunken', 'street', 'person', 'Look', 'quickly', 'next', 'scene', 'normal', 'again', 'Maybe', 'disease', 'next', 'elder', 'surfer', 'resembles', 'Greg', 'Noll', 'da', 'Bull', 'drunken', 'role', 'disease.As', 'being', 'surf', 'cult', 'film', 'yes', 'are', 'early', 'surf', 'scenes', 'ending', 'solid', '10', 'minutes', 'surfing', 'kids', 'are', 'drawn', 'beach', '13', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'surf', 'up', 'not', 'enough', 'sit', '2', 'hours', 'bad', 'movie', 'watch', 'surfing.I', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'movie', 'rated', 'so', 'high', 'so', 'many', 'want', 'movie', 'growing', 'up', 'rewatch', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'even', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'not', 'movie', 'one', 'large', 'positive', 'movie', 'watching', 'future', 'stars', 'least', 'working', 'actors', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'like', 'start', 'careers']",Big Wednesday VHS
234752,A2F2BJTA5L1GHY,6300269450,Siriam,"[1, 1]","When I first saw this film on release in 1978, many of the critics had panned it with several observing that it was only interesting when in the water, given surfing is its main excitement and the movie subsequently bombed. Looked at again 30 years later (I have in fact seen it several times in between given the cult status it enjoys in UK fringe cinemas), the film's time horizon of mid 1960s to early 1970s following a surfing mad group growing up is nowhere as bad as those critics may have indicated.Named after the fact that most big surfing swells over the years have occurred on Wednesday, the film by using the surfing culture provides an excellent snapshot of a group of Californian teenagers maturing across the late 1960s and facing up to their changing responsibilities, with its keen observations along the way on the tension with the later hippy movement and the indirect impact of the Vietnam War and its draft on people's lives.None of the three lead actors (two actual surfers and Gary Busey as the ""Masochist"" in gonzo mode) were going to be Oscar contenders based on this outing but what makes the performances succeed is the quality of the ensemble playing. The director co-written script  given John Milius's other writing credits is a bit clunky in parts (especially the lead personal relationships and the father figure of ""Bear""), but since Milius was a surfer from a very young age, he admits in the recent interview included in this Anniversary DVD that it is a very personal movie and an amalgam of many different characters he knew from those days.Sure the film's surfing scenes still look fantastic 30 years on, especially in widescreen format. The accompanying short Milius interview and his Director commentary (which because of its conversational style works well in conveying his enthusiasm for the subject as well as including lots of personal observations and stories) also makes you realise the difficulties and dangers that were faced in the location shooting of such footage.Yes, one suspects as has already been seen over the last 30 years that this little gem while bombing on initial release will outlast many other over hyped movies of the same period. This is not just just because of its surfing community following but because it is a lot closer to depicting how it actually was for many in those times.",5,"A ""bombed"" masterpiece",1218499200,"08 12, 2008",2008,2350,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'release', '1978', 'many', 'critics', 'had', 'panned', 'several', 'observing', 'was', 'only', 'interesting', 'when', 'water', 'given', 'surfing', 'main', 'excitement', 'movie', 'subsequently', 'bombed', 'Looked', 'again', '30', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'fact', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'given', 'cult', 'status', 'UK', 'fringe', 'cinemas', 'film', 'time', 'horizon', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'following', 'surfing', 'mad', 'group', 'growing', 'up', 'nowhere', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'may', 'have', 'indicated.Named', 'fact', 'most', 'big', 'surfing', 'swells', 'years', 'have', 'occurred', 'Wednesday', 'film', 'using', 'surfing', 'culture', 'excellent', 'snapshot', 'group', 'Californian', 'teenagers', 'maturing', 'late', '1960s', 'facing', 'up', 'changing', 'responsibilities', 'keen', 'observations', 'way', 'tension', 'later', 'hippy', 'movement', 'indirect', 'impact', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'draft', 'people', 'lives.None', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'two', 'actual', 'surfers', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'Masochist', 'gonzo', 'mode', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contenders', 'based', 'outing', 'what', 'performances', 'succeed', 'quality', 'ensemble', 'playing', 'director', 'co-written', 'script', 'given', 'John', 'Milius', 'other', 'writing', 'credits', 'bit', 'clunky', 'parts', 'especially', 'lead', 'personal', 'relationships', 'father', 'figure', 'Bear', 'Milius', 'was', 'surfer', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'recent', 'interview', 'included', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'very', 'personal', 'movie', 'amalgam', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'knew', 'days.Sure', 'film', 'surfing', 'scenes', 'still', 'look', 'fantastic', '30', 'years', 'especially', 'widescreen', 'format', 'accompanying', 'short', 'Milius', 'interview', 'Director', 'commentary', 'conversational', 'style', 'well', 'conveying', 'enthusiasm', 'subject', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'lots', 'personal', 'observations', 'stories', 'also', 'realise', 'difficulties', 'dangers', 'were', 'faced', 'location', 'shooting', 'such', 'footage.Yes', 'one', 'already', 'been', 'seen', 'last', '30', 'years', 'little', 'gem', 'bombing', 'initial', 'release', 'will', 'outlast', 'many', 'other', 'hyped', 'movies', 'same', 'period', 'not', 'just', 'just', 'surfing', 'community', 'following', 'lot', 'closer', 'depicting', 'how', 'actually', 'was', 'many', 'times']",Big Wednesday VHS

234754,A2MNMZMM6BGLTA,6300269450,"Uncle Chino ""Johnny""","[5, 5]","This is an old favorite from my younger days. It is a movie written by John Millius about a group of young teens growing up in California and surfing. It starts with them in their teen years and deals with their parties, loves, friendship and of course riding the big waves. It is a simpler and nicer time in America in the early 60's. The Beachboys and surf music ruled the airwaves and everybody was tan, hair bleached by the sun, in bikinis and swimming trunks, surf boards, your best girl and late night camp fires on the beach. But then things start to change and the Viet Nam era comes into play. The boys have to make a decision on if they are going to serve, dodge the draft or scheme to come up with a way to get out of it. Also other things are changing. Things are getting more complicated simply because everybody is growing up and has to face more serious issues than when the next keg party is going to be and when the next waves are coming in.Jan Michael Vincent stars and looks like he is cut out of a Michelangelo sculpture. He was the early 70's adonis and he and Willian Katt and Garey Busey round out the cast. They and their friends are a colorful bunch of characters and as they go thru the ups and downs of becoming adults their friendships are tested by time and by adversity.I think this is a really good movie. The surfing footage is also very good and I think most of the guys do their own surfing. The guy that plays 'The Bear' is also very good in his role. I believe Millius wrote this about his own coming of age and surfing so it is dead on accurate and believable. Vincent is outstanding in his performance and you can't take your eyes off of him his charisma is that commanding.",4,Great Surf Movie,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,1712,"['old', 'favorite', 'younger', 'days', 'movie', 'written', 'John', 'Millius', 'group', 'young', 'teens', 'growing', 'up', 'California', 'surfing', 'teen', 'years', 'deals', 'parties', 'loves', 'friendship', 'course', 'riding', 'big', 'waves', 'simpler', 'nicer', 'time', 'America', 'early', '60', 'Beachboys', 'surf', 'music', 'ruled', 'airwaves', 'everybody', 'was', 'tan', 'hair', 'bleached', 'sun', 'bikinis', 'swimming', 'trunks', 'surf', 'boards', 'best', 'girl', 'late', 'night', 'camp', 'fires', 'beach', 'then', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'era', 'play', 'boys', 'have', 'make', 'decision', 'are', 'going', 'serve', 'dodge', 'draft', 'scheme', 'come', 'up', 'way', 'get', 'Also', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'changing', 'Things', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'complicated', 'simply', 'everybody', 'growing', 'up', 'face', 'more', 'serious', 'issues', 'when', 'next', 'keg', 'party', 'going', 'be', 'when', 'next', 'waves', 'are', 'coming', 'in.Jan', 'Michael', 'Vincent', 'stars', 'cut', 'Michelangelo', 'sculpture', 'was', 'early', '70', 'adonis', 'Willian', 'Katt', 'Garey', 'Busey', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'friends', 'are', 'colorful', 'bunch', 'characters', 'go', 'ups', 'downs', 'becoming', 'adults', 'friendships', 'are', 'tested', 'time', 'adversity.I', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'surfing', 'footage', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'most', 'guys', 'do', 'own', 'surfing', 'guy', ""'The"", 'Bear', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'believe', 'Millius', 'wrote', 'own', 'coming', 'age', 'surfing', 'dead', 'accurate', 'believable', 'Vincent', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'charisma', 'commanding']",Big Wednesday VHS

234756,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,6300269450,William,"[1, 4]","BIG WEDNESDAY is, as many have stated, so much more than just a surfie movie.  It explores the friendship of three friends over a 10 year period who just happen to all have a surfing passion.  A film overlooked by many, yet has a great story to tell with excellent performances by Katt, Busey and Vicent.  The surfing aspect is a small part of the overall storyline.I think the marketing people should have released this DVD title with a different cover as it is misleading and cheapens the movie to a great degree. It is so much more deserving than that.",4,Cover misleading - needs better cover,1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,555,"['BIG', 'WEDNESDAY', 'many', 'have', 'stated', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'surfie', 'movie', 'friendship', 'three', 'friends', '10', 'year', 'period', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'have', 'surfing', 'passion', 'film', 'overlooked', 'many', 'yet', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Katt', 'Busey', 'Vicent', 'surfing', 'aspect', 'small', 'part', 'overall', 'storyline.I', 'think', 'marketing', 'people', 'should', 'have', 'released', 'DVD', 'title', 'different', 'cover', 'misleading', 'movie', 'great', 'degree', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'deserving']",Big Wednesday VHS
