When the daughter of the duo decides to strike out on her own, her mother pulls a series of her own cons in hopes of keeping her daughter ""safe"" and tied to her forever - and each predictably spins off into zany dysfunction.The premise is cute, and Weaver and Hewitt dazzle in their performance, switching between their roles consummately - however, the replay value of this movie may not be as high. The plot with Hewitt and her love interest seems less about learning trust and maturity, and more about finding ""the one"" guy who won't bag your mother/aunt on your wedding night...and once you find him, you're romantically set for life. Since most infidelities don't occur at first opportunity, however, this creates a bit of a Family Unfriendly Aesop, on top of the whopping problems that somehow the leading ladies should try to make a concerted go with their beaus based on nothing more than mild mutual attraction and a couple of whirlwind romances based on wildly false premises.

Its funny how that works, isn't it.  `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' is one of my favorite comedies (hilarious) and this film lacks a lot of the intelligence and wit that that film had (in spades).That said; this film was fun.I don't really think you can go wrong with Sigourney Weaver or Gene Hackman.  You can go very (very) wrong with nearly everyone else in the cast, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt, but she actually nails her role (not too hard to play an arrogant spoiled brat though, is it).The film centers around mother/daughter con-artists Max and Page Conners who make it a habit of scamming rich men out of their money (Max marries them and then gets her hot young daughter to seduce them so she can divorce them, taking them for everything they have...or at least half).  Things get complicated when Page decides she wants to do the baiting, getting someone halfway decent for a change (as apposed to the older, less attractive men her mother snatches up).  They wind up both baiting two very different men, and things get even stickier when Page actually falls in love.There are many laughs, most of which are cheap, but the cast is having a lot of fun and it shows.  Weaver is a comedic goldmine most of the time, and while this is far from her best work, it is very entertaining.  Hewitt is hot, and Lee is charming...and Hackman, well, he's Hackman!

While it is a typical, by the numbers kind of a comedy film, it is still a pretty pleasant and modestly entertaining film. Not exactly one that will still be in your memory a while from now. Except for the ample bossom that is on full display here. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt star as a mother-daughter con artist team who go to Palm Beach for one last big hit. They plan to attract billionaire Gene Hackman, who is in horrible health, so the mom can marry him and the daughter can set him up in a compromising way for the mom to catch and...voila!...instant money!. But, as usual, things go horribly wrong as the luscious duo try to correct things. All of the stars here are obviously game. Weaver is very good in her role as Angela. She definitley has a nice knack for comedy that she doesn't get to show off too often. A nice performance from a great actress. Hewitt also benefits here. Sure, her cleavage and, well, her whole body is amply on display in hot poses and clothes, but she does a good job. Her character wanting to break away from mommy dearest, only to realize it's a hard world out there on your own. This is a definite plus for her career. It should open her up to BIGGER and BETTER things. Plus, she's sexy as all hell here. Hackman is ridiculously silly. He's made up to look really awful and it works. Another performer not known for goofy comedy who pulls it off nicely. Ray Liotta is on hand as a victim of the duo's cons. He's an intense actor, but he lightens up here in a comedic role. Jason Lee also stars as a bar owner that Hewitt falls in love with. His role is pretty typical. Not given much to do. It's a predictable film really. I don't think anybody won't know how it turns out. Weaver and Hewitt are really good together. They look as if they could actually be mother and daughter. The only good thing a Heartbreakers 2 would bring is these two back together. Nora Dunn, Jeffrey Jones, Ann Bancroft co-star, with a cameo by Carrie Fisher and SNL's Kevin Nealon. If all else fails, you get the great shots of Ms. Hewitt in all her glory. Did I mention how sexy she is?. Our two stars just barely make it work.

Opportunity knocks when the ladies find themselves at a beautiful Florida resort and daughter discovers true romance with the local bartender (Jason Lee, winning personality thoroughly intact). Gene Hackman is hilarious as the smoking addict that Weaver picks as her next project, and Ray Liotta is almost reminiscent of his brilliant work in Something Wild as one of Weaver's previous jobs gone wrong. Featuring some very funny moments, this out of control comedy starts off so right and then squeezes too much into its last third.

538566,AE0E6UII0VSZA,B00003CXWL,Blake Kleiner,"[3, 4]","I was dragged to this movie kicking and screaming (well, not really...). I didn't want to see it, or at least, I didn't want to see it as much as I wanted to see &quot;Spy Kids.&quot; (Please take this opportunity to laugh at the grown man wanting to watch a kids movie, but hey, it was Robert Rodriguez.) From the very opening shot of the film, I was drawn in, not because it was funny, but because this film struck me in a different way: It was a visually stunning comedy. It is from beginning to end, shot with expert cinematography; and packed between the bookends of great shots are so many huge laughs that I literally clutched my stomach and fell out of my seat. The whole theater was erupting in constant laughter at this marvel of a comedy that just kept pounding away at your funny bone, not giving you a second to stop and think. This film is so jam-packed with great laughs, yet with a very sweet sentimentality, that I would recommend it so much so as to name it one of the best comedies I've seen in years, which pretty much puts in a secluded list with Kevin Smith films and the &quot;American Pies.&quot; The main reason for it is because the cast is so wonderful, and we never doubt for a second that all of them are having the time of their lives, making this trifle of a guilty pleasure. Ranging from screen veterans like Sigourney Weaver (most widely known for her Oscar-nominated portrayal of the first woman hero in space, Lt. Ellen Ripley of the &quot;Alien&quot; fame), Gene Hackman (do I really need to explain this guy's resume?), and Ray Liotta (with a complete, intact brain, despite his last bad career move), to &quot;PO5&quot;'s Jennifer Love Hewitt, looking as incredible as ever, and one of my personal favorite actors, Jason Lee, who delivers every line with the precision of a great comic actor.The film opens during a wedding between the Weaver and Liotta characters, which it turns out, wasn't meant to be, as he no sooner gets out of bed the morning after than he's got his secretary's hair caught in his zipper during some hilarious filandering. The marriage ends with a settlement, of course; somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000, I believe, and Weaver goes on her way. But we soon find out, much to our shock (that is, if we didn't see the previews), that the skimpy dressed secretary was, in fact, Weaver's daughter, Page (Hewitt). The mother-daughter chemistry between these two here is perfect. If it wasn't, the only way you could've saved this movie was by giving Jason Lee center stage and having him recite the game show scenes of &quot;Mallrats.&quot; But they didn't have to resort to that: The movie works perfectly without the brilliant Kevin Smith dialogue we're used to Lee spewing with steely perfection because it's got a heart, one that isn't broken by these two con-artists, and it keeps on getting bigger, like the Grinch or something. Anyway, the majority of the film circulates between four plots that all co-exist flawlessly: 1) Regaining the money lost to the IRS by conning a cigarette tycoon name Tensy (Hackman, in one of the most hilariously repulsive roles ever played), 2) A separate, last-ditch effort con between Lee and Hewitt that could actually be real love, 3) The typical &quot;I'm ready to strike out on my own&quot; argument between mother and daughter, and 4) The Liotta character's pursuit of Weaver, whom he still loves, despite what happened. All of this is happening at once at certain points in the film, and it would've fallen apart without a good director, and the immense amount of comic energy displayed by the perfect cast. I love this movie, and I've been recommending it to everyone from the moment I stepped out of the theater.

Weaver and Hewitt are mother and daughter con artists who do a 1-2 seduction number on wealthy men for lucrative divorce settlements.  The movie is being compared to &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; but neither Weaver or Hewitt have the comic talents of Steve Martin and Michael Caine.  They also are not at total odds with one another in the story as Martin and Caine were, which gave the Martin-Caine duo more of a comic edge.  Liotta and Hackmann are both targets of these two gold diggers.  I was never convinced that they were so easily able to trick Liotta who plays a crook himself.  Hackmann was more believable as a dupe and had many comedic moments as a tobacco baron who smokes and hacks constantly, seemingly one step away from lung cancer death.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Director David Mirkin can direct comedy, he proved that in ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" but for me ""Heartbreakers"" ran well out of the gate, but mid way through the race, it faltered. And it breaks my heart.""Heartbreakers"" is about a mother-daughter pair of grifters: Max (Sigourney Weaver) and Page Conners (Jennifer Love Hewitt). (Get it? They are con artists, and therefore they're 'conners.') Max claims she is saving herself until she gets married. She celebrates heartily at the wedding reception, and then, just prior to consumation on the honeymoon, she conks out. Meanwhile, Page has ingratiated herself into the mark's life. She has a job as his receptionist, for example. When he returns to work still unsatisfied he is vulnerable to Page's full d&eacute;colletage press. Mom barges in to find the mark in flagrante delicto. She sues for divorce, along with a healthy settlement.So far, so good. I enjoyed the twisted mother-daughter dynamic between Weaver and Love Hewitt.-------------------------------Max Conners: Maybe you'd like a spanking?Page Conners: Just try it. I dare you!=========================================Kind of like ""The Joy Luck Club"" meets ""The Grifters."" When they move to Palm Beach, Florida, in search of new targets, that's when ""Heartbreakers"" stumbles. Max sets her sights on billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman). Mirkin uses one running gag: he is a chain smoker with a hacking cough. This soon gets tiresome. What is it with Mirkin and the whacky nomenclature? Casting Hackman as a smoker with a hacking cough? People who live in glass mirkins should not throw stones.For some reason Max affects a Russian accent for this con, if for no other reason than to cry about deportation, thus hastening the mark's marriage proposal. Sigourney is no Streep, and maybe that's the point of one amusing scene in a Russian restaurant where she fails miserably to convince Native Russian Speakers of her authenticity. But, like Hackman's hacking cough, the faux accent also became annoying in short order.Ray Liotta was good as the mark ""Dean"" in the first act, but when he returns he mostly just gets in the way. A few jokes hit their mark, but many miss. The best thing about the second part is the ongoing war/romance between Page and Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee).-----------------Jack Withrowe: Hi. Can I get you a drink?Page Conners: Wow! I've never heard that one before. You really blow me away with your creativity.Jack Withrowe: Well, I...Page Conners: ""Well, I, uh..."" Your recovery's even better! Do you even care at all who I am? I mean, I could be the Antichrist or have the intelligence of a thermos, but unfortunately *those* are not the matters the male ***** ponders. So please tell me, why did you walk all the way over here to ask to get me a drink?Jack Withrowe: Well, because... I'm the bartender.===========================When she finds out he is not only the bartender, but the bar owner, she sets her sights on him as her next mark. Of course, she never expected to fall for the guy, though her mother warned her. Mothers. What would we do without them?--------------------Max Conners: How do I look?Page Conners: If I were a guy, I'd do you.==============================Somehow though, I get the feeling that the marketing department wasn't 100% behind Sigourney Weaver, especially if you look at the box cover. The picture doesn't even look like her.----------------------------Max Conners: You will respect your mother and do the con.Page Conners: Keep dreaming, witch!Max Conners: You are not too old to spank!========================================Nora Dunn and Kevin Nealon, both former SNL cast members, have funny cameos.Anne Bancroft plays Max's con artist mentor. Director David Mirkin even pulls a Hitchcock as Jack's lawyer. Zach Galifianakis (who is on fire since ""The Hangover"") and Sarah Silverman play Jack's friends, but talk about wasted resources. They just sit there while those of lesser comedic gifts flail about helplessly.----------------------Max Conners: I'm sorry, Page. I'm a terrible mother.

538579,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00003CXWL,darragh o'donoghue,"[1, 2]","The brilliant opening sequence of 'Heartbreakers' explains what is right and wrong about the film.  Ray Liotta, who has just married a Catholic Sigourney Weaver who refused sex before marriage, is desperate for consummation, and eager to dispense with the polite wedding formalities of the bridegroom.  Weaver insists, however, on dancing with everyone in the room, and drinking her way into a chastity-belt stuopor.  When Liotta finally drags her away, director Mirkin expertly conveys the violence of his burning hormones and the inevitable frustration of his desire, by propulsive hand-held camera behind the raging stud, and a camera pulling away from him down an endless corridor.  Inevitably, by the time he gets his lady on the bed, she passes out.Like 'Touch Of Evil', 'Heartbreakers' can be seen as the quest of the male hero to consummate the deferred kiss.  Like Charlton Heston in that movie, or many Bunuel leads, Liotta's complacent self-image is destroyed and he becomes violently consumed by this frustrated desire.  'Heartbreakers' might seem to be about powerful women - a mother and daughter team of con-artists who trick wealthy men into marriages, adultery and expensive divorces - but is really about the men who go crazy for these wild cards, who try to tame them.  The actreses (especially Weaver) try hard, but they achieve no real chemistry; their power is monotonous, their capitulation sentimental and sinister.  It is the men - chain-smoking, phlegm-spluttering, male-nude-statue-purchasing tobacco billinaire Gene Hackman; and Liotta in a wonderful send-up of his gangster image - that the film achieves its most wicked comic moments.  The women's work couldn't succeed if it wasn't for the rampant idiocies of the male libido, which lets men down as much as it exploits women (aw the poor loves).  The dreary mother and daughter love/hate stuff and the lure-of-true-love angst might ring true, but is considerably less fun.That's why the opening scene is emblematic.  Mirkin brings to it the larger-than-life cartoon truth that he kept from his time at 'The Simpsons' and he injected into his debut 'Romy and Michelle's High-School Reunion', with exagerrated music, composition and camera-movement.  It focuses on the older characters - the battle-of-the-sexes sub-Hawksian tussle has always provided richer comic material than the generational conflict.

This is a great comedy for all ages.  Its humor keeps its viewers laughing during and after watching.  Its theme of a woman who cons many men offers many interesting twists and turns, always keeping everyone interested.  Such theme takes a big turn when her daughter begins sliding away from her for a man, whom she truly falls in love with.  The suspense builds as her most recent ex-husband searches for her.  The writers are brilliant.  The actors offer their own humor.  Sigourney Weaver performs her role as the con artist wonderfully.  Her fake russian accent can fool anyone.  Her performance of &quot;Back In the USSR&quot; almost lives up to the original Beatles version.  Gene Hackman's role as her latest victim is hilarious.  The smoke constantly blowing out of his mouth and his nostrils gives the movie its own flamboyance.  Everyone else also acts their roles wonderfully.  &quot;Heartbreakers&quot; is a great comedy for those looking for a laugh fest.  This unforgettable experience will not disappoint its viewers.

But is wasn't as horrific as some (like The Wedding Planner), and it was entertaining, if only to enjoy the beauty and charms of Sigourney Weaver, who at 51 is still stunning.Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play a mother daughter con team.  Weaver tricks rich men to marry her, then uses her daughter to get the men in a compromising situation so that she can get a hefty divorce settlement.  The scam works well until Weaver winds up scamming Ray Liotta (who gives a one-dimensional performance as a crooked car parts business owner.)  The doofus falls for Weaver and decides to try and win her back.Weaver meanwhile has gone on to scam a wealthy tobacco billionaire (Gene Hackman in easily his worst role ever) and Hewitt has fallen for a rich bar owner who she jerks around (played by Jason Lee, from ""Almost Famous"" and ""Mumford"".  His role here falls way short of his other efforts). P>The movie also goes through another overused plot device - finding a statue of a naked male and having the penis break off.  Ha Ha.  The Wedding Planner also used this device with equally ineffective results.  Perhaps the filmakers were trying to illustrate what the mother-daughter team does to men.I will say that at least the movie was entertaining and not a crashing bore, although at slightly over 2 hours, it goes on too long.

538587,A2KB14WCZ1DVE3,B00003CXWL,elvistcob@lvcm.com,"[0, 0]","This is a movie with a plot totally full of holes.  A movie that does many of the things I hate about Hollywood.  But they get away with it in this case because they do just enough things well to make it worth a look.First, the plot holes.  This is a movie about a mother-daughter con-artist team.  It's giving away nothing that mom, Sigourney Weaver, gets rich guys to marry her.  Then, apparently after setting records for post-nuptial headaches to prevent any actual consummation, she gets nubile daughter Jennifer Love-Hewitt to get into a compromising position with the guy, and gets approximately half of his net worth in the divorce settlement.While certainly possible, I don't buy several twists to the plot.  First, even though there is a small plot twist to explain this, there are times when they seem to have no money at all, although even though this point contradicts itself.  On one hand, they resort to extremely petty cons for things like gas and hotel rooms (which would be spotted immediately by hotel management and endanger the big score).  On the other hand, the overhead for their cons, such as renting a mini-yacht to scout out suckers and buying the wardrobes necessary to appear rich themselves would cost a small fortune in itself.  So this part doesn't wash.Nor does the way Hollywood has been treating male-female attraction ever since Hollywood began.  Yes, believe me, I know that the right kind of female get-up gets guys, including myself, all ga-ga.  And this is the basis of the movie.  But with scene after scene of guys practically willing to sign over their net worth after just a smile gets the point across with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  The bar owner takes way too much garbage from Hewitt to make it believable.  And the Ray Liotta character, considering his profession, would never wait until marriage for ""his"" big score.  For you ladies at home wanting to try this occupation, reality says you'll probably have to go that ""extra mile"" before marriage to get the brass, I mean, gold ring.Ok, so why as high as three stars?  First, it's a professional project with a professional set of actors.  While I really hate smoking, Gene Hackman is a scream as one of the targets, who puts his cigarette out in other peoples' drinks, generally ignores ""No Smoking"" signs, and even does studies to hook 9-year-olds on the habit.  While all of this would range from rude to unthinkable in real life, Hackman, who can't seem to do a bad performance, is hilarious here.  Weaver and Liotta also handle the timing their roles require, even though I emphasize his character would NOT have waited until marriage, and would NOT have used her wedding night excuse as a reason to stop.But even though I've slammed the way Hollywood handles sex in a leering, teasing manner, I will also declare my hypocrisy by stating that the performance of Jennifer Love-Hewitt got me hook, line and sinker.  They could not have cast a better actress for the part, and she's perfect on screen.  Not for the acting, mind you.  While adequate, I don't believe for a minute she is ready for the life she chooses at the end.  But it's her screen presence that blows me over.  Normally I would be really ticked off with all the teasing that goes on with no nudity to back it up.  But sometimes in life you just have to conform to peer pressure.  The lady is so sexy here, with dresses that are shorter than my T-shirts, and heels longer than my, well, never mind, you got me.  You hear me Hollywood!

The results are mixed (but mostly good), with some terrific slapstick and some pure drivel.  Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them, only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes, they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over.  Meanwhile, Paige is running her own scam on Jack (Jason Lee) who owns a bar resting on prime real estate worth $3 Million.It is mostly pratfall humor, with lots of sight gags and general nuttiness, which is often uproariously funny.  The whole idea that the diminutive Paige could have been spawned from the Amazonian Maxine is implied comedy at its finest, leading us to conclude that Paige's father could only have been a midget.Gene Hackman completely steals the show as the wheezy billionaire.  Hackman, who is one of our national treasures as a dramatic actor, shows magnificent range, and he turns out to be the best comedian of the bunch.  Sigourney Weaver is also in rare form brandishing some bodacious outfits and undergarments.  She is especially funny as Olga, trotting out impressive broken English and even doing some vocals accompanied by a Russian balalaika band.  Ray Liotta gives a lighthearted and funny performance as a chop shop owner who can't get over his love for Maxine, even though he knows she scammed him.  Jason Lee's understated nice guy portrayal serves as the perfect counterpart to Jennifer Love Hewitt's bratty vamp.  The perennially cute Hewitt still can't seem to transition into grownup roles.  No matter how sexy they make her up (and they do quite a good job with her considerable attributes), her pubescent mannerisms and delivery still make her come off as a teenage harpy.  In her defense, this is what the role required, but it doesn't do much to move her out of her character rut.Overall, there is a lot of good fun here that is often dissipated by puerile absurdity.  Still, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly delivered by Weaver and Hackman, that make this a better than average comedy.  I rated it 7/10.

Heartbreakers isn't really a 'smart' funny film, it's more of a physical comedic film, meaning most of the laughs come from physical comedy such as golf clubs getting whacked against people's head, cars running into trees, people tripping and falling face flat on the floor, etc.Jennifer Love Hewitt plays her ditzy, self-absorbed character extremely well.  Throughout the course of the film, her character changes and becomes more sympathetic as she begins falling in love with a man she's supposed to be scamming.  Jennifer represents this character extremely well.  Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, and Ray Liotta are also fantastic in this film.  Most of the cast are mainly known throughout the world for their work in drama films, but they're also able to carry off this comedic film very well.  The cast is absolutely amazing.The DVD has whopping extras.  Outtakes (which are extremely funny), Featurettes, trailers, deleted scenes, etc.  This is definitely worth a look.

This is billed as a lightweight romantic comedy/con caper. As cons go, it is all too predictable - as a matter of fact, I believe it's  been done before, and better, in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."" And any romance involved here is lukewarm, at best.Sigourney Weaver and  Jennifer Love-Hewett play mother daughter grifters, Maxine and Page Conners, (and a variety of colorful aliases), on the lookout for any man wealthy enough to be bilked for all he's got. Curvy Moma Conners is on husband number 13, and her aide-de-camp, 20 year-old Page, has her own game going with Jack, (Jason Lee), a monied bar owner. The duo also has a vast repertoire of  money-making scams, from putting glass in restaurant food for a free meal to securing a complimentary suite of rooms in a posh Palm Beach hotel. At first these con-games are funny, but after a while they grow old and one can see them coming a mile away.The IRS threatens jail unless Maxine and Page come up with undeclared back taxes. So they're off for ""one last score."" Ray Liotta plays Dean Cumanno, the last man Max ripped-off. He is still wildly in love with her, even after she took him to the cleaners and got his Mercedes to boot. He takes off in pursuit not knowing all the facts about his ex. Ailing billionaire tobacco baron William Tensy, (Gene Hackman), who looks a few days over one hundred, with ashen, liver-spotted skin, pink nose and a 5 pack-a-day-man's hacking cough, is the next target. I must say, Weaver, playing the Russian vamp Olga, makes for some big laughs, and she has the accent down pat. And Hackman is so disgusting, he's cool! There's a wild dinner scene where she is asked to sing in Russian, which could be worth the rental price alone. Unfortunately, Love-Hewett, who does petulant with a capitol ""P"", has an extremely limited range.The film moves at a reasonable pace, although not fast enough to make it work as a comedy. It starts good, but goes downhill  way before the conclusion. And it's far too long at 123 minutes  - I mean this is NOT ""War and Peace."" Weaver, who has a knack for comedy, gets to ham it up and have fun. Apparently director Dave Mirkin wants his audience to focus on his stars' natural assets.

Well if I had woman in my life that acted like the two in this, yeah I'd probaly do what the guys in this do.Max Connors(Weaver) scans men. She seduces them and marries them. She then gets her hot daughter Paige(Hewitt) to seduce them and just when there about to you know what she walks in on them. She then divorces them and takes half of their assests. Shes been doing it her whole life and they just did it to Dean(Liotta). It looks like the girls are off for a big pay and Paige looks to go out on her own. That is until the IRS bust them for tax eviction and leaves them broke.The two head off to Palm Beach to look for big money and they find that in William B. Tensy(Hackman) a tobacco company owner worth 3 billion. He's the play and things are going good. That is until Paige starts trying to play Jack(Lee) a local bar owner worth a couple of million. She's falling in love with him. They also have to deal with Dean who's come back looking for love with Max. The girls now have little time to see if they can play Tensy.Sigourney Weaver is gorgeous in the movie. It's hard to believe she is in her early fifties dressing the way she does. She is so hot to be that old. Shes funny and her singing Back in the USSR with a bad Russian accent is terrific. You have to love what she does and brings to this movie. It's a different kind of character. You almost have trouble believing this gorgeous woman was once bald in Alien series.Jennifer Love Hewitt gives one of the best performances of her young carear. Whew is she hot in this movie. She is so hot in all those tiny dresses and thank the lord for the wonder bra. Im 20 years old and shes my favorite part of the movie. Her chemistry with Lee is real good and looks authentic.Gene Hackman is funny in this. The two time Oscar winner is the disgusting tobacco guru. He's always smoking like a chimney in the movie and he looks horrible. The make up guys did good with him. His love scenes with Weaver kill me. They are so funny with him kissing her and blowing smoke out at the same time. It's even better when I found out Weaver didn't know he was going to do it.Ray Liotta and Jason Lee are also great. Liotta is always great in his movies. Lee is one of the funniest underrated guys in Hollywood. This is a different kind of character for him. I'd rather see him do more stuff like Mallrats. The two are still good though.The DVD extras are pretty good. There are 18 deleted scenes. There is plenty of commentary on the movie. There are a couple of documentaries on the movie that are quite interesting. The DVD extras add to the movie.This is a great DVD. It's a funny movie with gorgeous woman and a happy ending. It's pretty easy to find cheap. I wouldn't rent it because you can get it at a lot of places for a little more than a rental. If you don't like the story the men should at least enjoy the eye candy.

Perhaps it's because we love freedom in all its many forms. The movies have always given us with characters who delight in bending the rules. From Mae West and W. C. Fields to The Godfather and Indiana Jones, we have laughed or cried, as the case may be, at their antics. The mother-daughter con team in the comedy Heartbreakers is Hollywood's latest devilish duo. This movie isn't destined to be a classic. It's too long, and it's not as clever as it should have been. Still, it provides an adequate number of laughs. Despite its limitations, it stands head and shoulder about this year's other comedies, most of which have had about as much class as a toilet bowl.The opening shots are of the gorgeous wedding of Max and Dean [Sigourney Weaver and Ray Liotta]. Dean is completely smitten by Max and is clueless as to the problems that are about to develop. She is using an alias. He doesn't even know her real name is Max. He'd certainly be surprised to know this is her thirteenth trip down the aisle. No wonder she's so good at it. Poor Dean! The best is yet to come. His sexy new secretary, who is about to seduce him, is not only Max's partner, she's also her daughter, Page [Jennifer Love Hewitt]. Soon the ladies will be off to Palm Beach, taking with them all of Dean's heart and half of his fortune. Who will the ladies try to catch in Florida's playground of the rich? And what of Dean? Have they heard the last of him?Weaver and Liotta make a welcome return to comedy, a medium they both excel at. Liotta is one of the few actors who can be funny and menacing at the same time. Also aboard is Gene Hackman, who plays Max's next victim, an obnoxious, chain-smoking tobacco heir named William Tensy. He appears to be having as much fun playing the part as we do watching him play it. Anne Bancroft has a small but delightful part as Barbara, the woman who taught Max everything. Jason Lee is fine as Jack, the guy Page accidentally falls in love with. Hewitt is the weak link in the cast. She plays Page as a woman totally devoid of charm, which makes Jack's falling for her a bit of a stretch.This is a really lovely movie to look at. The color in the photography is vibrant and crisp. The location shots and the sets are dazzling. And those dresses! I rarely even notice dresses, but the ones designed for Weaver and Hewitt are knockouts.

It's hideous. Yes, it has a good cast and a  promising premise, but a cast and a premise do not a good movie make. In fact, this might be the worst movie I've seen in the entire year of 2001.This gives the appearance of a fun, light comedy but yet there are no laughs in the entire film. The outcome of every situation will be predicted by the viewer, and/or many of the &quot;funniest&quot; situations were seen in the ads for the film. Perhaps it is because the cast members are not really known for their comedic work. The funnest part of watching Heartbreakers ends up being spotting the many celebrity cameos throughout the film.A high level of coincidence plagues this film as well. Jason Lee's bartender character seems to consistently be in the right place at the right time in order to fall in love with Jennifer Love Hewitt despite her hating him for most of the movie. Doesn't he have a clue? And its hard to swallow when Hewitt's Paige character suddenly develops a conscience towards the end of the film, especially after she has lived a life of con games and tomfoolery under her mother's wing for her entire life. And then when Ray Liotta's character buys into Weaver and Hewitt's act after he's lost half of his material posessions to them? It makes no sense that he's less angry about their ripoff than more willing to join their crew in order to get his money backThe end of the film will be predicted within the first third of the running time and is so unsatisfying you'll be left dumbfounded at the generic quality of it. Who's going to fall in love? If you can't see it coming, you haven't seen many movies.Yes, this DVD had quite a few extras on it, but the movie was so awful, I didn't even watch them. Twenty deleted scenes is very cool, but if the movie was bad in the first place, why even bother with 20 minutes more footage? If those scenes were cut because they weren't needed or very good, maybe the filmmakers should have taken a look at other scenes in the movie and ask if those were really any better.

I was quite surprised that Jennifer Love Hewitt (Paige) & Sigourney Weaver (Max) made such a good pairing in the movie, a great mother & daughter team. Others considered for their roles were: Cameron Diaz, Alicia Silverstone, Cher and Anjelica Huston. (Anjelica & Cher obviously for the mother roles!)I hate JLH with a passion, probably cos she wears as little as possible throughout, and will have every guy's tongue hanging out. And she plays the same character in every movie. She cannot play another character. Rant over.Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, & Ray Liotta were outstanding in this movie, considering what little they had to work with. Jason Lee was fabulous as ever, he can't do anything wrong! :) And Sigourney was very brave to get up & sing ""Back In The USSR"" in a Russian restaurant. (I still don't understand why she was pretending to be Russian.)There's a lot of establishing shots in this, which other reviewers have spoken about, but what's amazing is, that for the amount of car scenes there are, JLH never drove in any of the car scenes.The card handling that JLH does in the restaurant (saying it relaxes her) was taught to her by stage magician Ricky Jay. She actually learned more tricks than that, but was unable to do them in the movie because she broke her finger. The most expensive shot in the movie was when JLH leaned against the car to talk to Ray Liotta near the end of the movie. Because it was cold on set, she had a white sweatshirt around her waist that was in the shot, and it had to be digitally taken out.Overall, this film has everything a film needs to have, and that's mainly a totally implausible storyline, and a happy ending, which really didn't work well considering the rest of the film. OK, I'm kidding (am I?) The film is OK, but not really worth a look unless you're a JLH fan.",3,"Not bad, although I think I'm in a minority",1120348800,"07 3, 2005",2005,1917,"['bought', 'film', 'absolutely', 'ago', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Paige', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Max', 'made', 'such', 'good', 'pairing', 'movie', 'great', 'mother', 'daughter', 'team', 'Others', 'considered', 'roles', 'were', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Cher', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Anjelica', 'Cher', 'obviously', 'mother', 'hate', 'JLH', 'passion', 'probably', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'will', 'have', 'guy', 'tongue', 'hanging', 'out', 'same', 'character', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'character', 'Rant', 'over.Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'were', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'considering', 'what', 'little', 'had', 'work', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'fabulous', 'ever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Sigourney', 'was', 'very', 'brave', 'get', 'up', 'sing', 'Back', 'USSR', 'Russian', 'restaurant', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'pretending', 'be', 'Russian', 'lot', 'establishing', 'shots', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'spoken', 'about', 'what', 'amazing', 'amount', 'car', 'scenes', 'are', 'JLH', 'never', 'drove', 'car', 'scenes.The', 'card', 'handling', 'JLH', 'restaurant', 'saying', 'was', 'taught', 'stage', 'magician', 'Ricky', 'Jay', 'actually', 'learned', 'more', 'tricks', 'was', 'unable', 'do', 'movie', 'broke', 'finger', 'most', 'expensive', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'JLH', 'leaned', 'car', 'talk', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'cold', 'set', 'had', 'white', 'sweatshirt', 'waist', 'was', 'shot', 'had', 'be', 'digitally', 'taken', 'out.Overall', 'film', 'everything', 'film', 'have', 'mainly', 'totally', 'implausible', 'storyline', 'happy', 'ending', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'considering', 'rest', 'film', 'OK', ""'m"", 'kidding', 'am', 'film', 'OK', 'not', 'really', 'look', ""'re"", 'JLH', 'fan']",N/A

This stems from condoning the behavior of thetwo ladies. I would not underestimate Hewitt, despite this.Other questionable, or unnecessary aspects is the excess libido thatis relentlessly demonstrated on screen, suggesting that nobody canshield themselves from their basic instincts, or avoid being playedon that basis, which is obviously a flawed theory. Some may findHEARTBREAKERS somewhat sleazy, although the goal is to underline thecomedy aspect, the easy laughs that for some, may find gets old fastover 90 mins.Apart from the greed shown, thoughtless adultery is suggested as partof ladies behavior as a necessary evil in their setups, which mayalso be objectionable to some.The only morality in this story, is Liotta, despite his own mobstertype of persona, vocabulary, mannerisms tells the ladies ""Do you haveany idea how much therapy you need ? "", later telling them one thing,but doing another, when he plays into their hands, as he ismanipulated and capitulates to their domination.For those who appreciate comedy, even on a difficult theme like thisone, HEARTBREAKERS will win them over, if not for the charisma,professionalism, and skill brought into the picture by Weaver,Hewitt, and Hackman.

538659,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXWL,Reviewer,"[7, 9]","A movie that proves that what you see is not necessarily what you get, as a mother/daughter team con one well-heeled member of the opposite sex after another, in ""Heartbreakers,"" directed by David Mirkin and starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yes, the con is on, as mom takes `em to the altar, daughter seduces `em (getting caught in the act by mom, of course), and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women, it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg, and all is going well; the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page (Hewitt), much to the chagrin of her mother, Angela (Weaver), decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate, luck, chance or what-have-you would have it, at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account, but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point, what's a girl to do, but find another mark.  Only this time, it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that, the hunt is on.An amusing, and at times hilarious comedy, the fact that it works as well as it does can be attributed to two things, by category:  Weaver and Hewitt; and Ray Liotta and Jason Lee.  For what the movie lacks in originality is made up for with the performances of the aforementioned four.  As far as the women, such a pair of femmes fatales you've never seen; Hewitt has it and flaunts it, but she's still overshadowed by the gorgeous Weaver.  Looks aside, however, what really makes it cook is their shared if-you-see-me-comin'-better-step-aside, take-no-prisoners attitude, a Mae West meets Kate Hepburn persona that gives their con its zing.  Weaver plays it to the hilts, saucy, seductive and sharp as a tack.  And not to be outdone by her co-star, Hewitt stays right there with her, by giving a performance that makes you believe that this is a young woman who could actually pull this stuff off.  Together, their antics on screen are reminiscent of Lemmon and Curtis in ""Some Like It Hot,"" or Caine and Martin in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.""  There's a refreshing lack of pretentiousness about them that really makes them fun to watch.As for the guys, Liotta gives a sharp performance as Dean, a guy with a hard edge and a soft spot for Angela, and Lee does a notable turn as Jack, a regular guy who finds himself in the eye of Angela and Page's storm.  Lee has an especially engaging screen presence, and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt.Last, but far from least, Gene Hackman scores some guffaws as billionaire tobacco magnate William Tensy.  He gets a bit tongue-in-cheek with his character, who with his tobacco stained teeth and smoker's cough is at the same time hilarious and repulsive.  When Angela demurs his attempted kiss, you'd swear you can smell his breath and the reek of smoke from his clothes.  And you have to give Hackman credit for this one, because to play this role all vanity had to be stuffed in the closet for the duration.The supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft (Barbara), Jeffrey Jones (Mr. Appel), Nora Dunn (Miss Madress), Julio Oscar Mechoso (Leo), Carrie Fisher (Mrs. Surpin), Ricky Jay (Dawson's Auctioneer) and Elya Baskin (Vladimir).  Director Mirkin must be given credit for his imaginative approach to some fairly unoriginal material, and for making up for it's lack of substance by extracting some top performances from his actors.  The real strength of ""Heartbreakers,"" however, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.  If you look deep enough, you may find some insight into human nature, but for the most part this is a movie that was made with nothing but fun in mind.  It's entertaining, there's some laughs and some nice moments, and it's easy on the eyes.  If you let it, it's a movie that will let you off the hook for awhile and show you a good time.  And for my money, that's not such a bad deal.",3,Weaver and Hewitt Make It Work,987379200,"04 16, 2001",2001,4098,"['movie', 'what', 'see', 'not', 'necessarily', 'what', 'get', 'mother/daughter', 'team', 'con', 'one', 'well-heeled', 'member', 'opposite', 'sex', 'Heartbreakers', 'directed', 'David', 'Mirkin', 'starring', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'Yes', 'con', 'mom', 'em', 'altar', 'daughter', 'seduces', 'em', 'getting', 'caught', 'act', 'mom', 'course', 'mom', 'settles', 'divorce', 'big', 'bucks', 'women', 'having', 'goose', 'laid', 'golden', 'egg', 'going', 'well', 'bucks', 'are', 'rolling', 'Cupid', 'path', 'being', 'littered', 'wake', 'carnage', 'men', ""'ve"", 'despoiled', 'Then', 'Page', 'Hewitt', 'much', 'chagrin', 'mother', 'Angela', 'Weaver', 'time', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'take', 'down', 'score', 'herself', 'fate', 'luck', 'chance', 'what-have-you', 'would', 'have', 'moment', 'IRA', 'steps', 'not', 'only', 'out', 'bank', 'account', 'bill', 'back', 'taxes', 'far', 'away', 'amount', 'already', 'confiscated', 'point', 'what', 'girl', 'do', 'find', 'mark', 'Only', 'time', 'be', 'one', 'rich', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'hunt', 'on.An', 'amusing', 'times', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'fact', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'two', 'things', 'category', 'Weaver', 'Hewitt', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'what', 'movie', 'originality', 'made', 'up', 'performances', 'aforementioned', 'four', 'As', 'far', 'women', 'pair', 'femmes', 'fatales', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Hewitt', 'still', 'overshadowed', 'gorgeous', 'Weaver', 'Looks', 'aside', 'however', 'what', 'really', 'cook', 'shared', ""if-you-see-me-comin'-better-step-aside"", 'take-no-prisoners', 'attitude', 'Mae', 'West', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'con', 'zing', 'hilts', 'saucy', 'seductive', 'sharp', 'tack', 'not', 'be', 'outdone', 'co-star', 'Hewitt', 'right', 'giving', 'performance', 'believe', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'pull', 'stuff', 'Together', 'antics', 'screen', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'Lemmon', 'Curtis', 'Hot', 'Caine', 'Martin', 'Dirty', 'Rotten', 'Scoundrels', 'refreshing', 'lack', 'pretentiousness', 'really', 'fun', 'watch.As', 'guys', 'Liotta', 'sharp', 'performance', 'Dean', 'guy', 'hard', 'edge', 'soft', 'spot', 'Angela', 'Lee', 'notable', 'turn', 'Jack', 'regular', 'guy', 'who', 'eye', 'Angela', 'Page', 'storm', 'Lee', 'especially', 'engaging', 'screen', 'presence', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'shares', 'Hewitt.Last', 'far', 'least', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'guffaws', 'billionaire', 'tobacco', 'magnate', 'William', 'Tensy', 'bit', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'character', 'who', 'tobacco', 'stained', 'teeth', 'smoker', 'cough', 'same', 'time', 'hilarious', 'repulsive', 'When', 'Angela', 'attempted', 'kiss', ""'d"", 'swear', 'can', 'smell', 'breath', 'reek', 'smoke', 'clothes', 'have', 'give', 'Hackman', 'credit', 'one', 'play', 'role', 'vanity', 'had', 'be', 'stuffed', 'closet', 'duration.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Barbara', 'Jeffrey', 'Jones', 'Mr.', 'Appel', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'Miss', 'Madress', 'Julio', 'Oscar', 'Mechoso', 'Leo', 'Carrie', 'Fisher', 'Mrs.', 'Surpin', 'Ricky', 'Jay', 'Dawson', 'Auctioneer', 'Elya', 'Baskin', 'Vladimir', 'Director', 'Mirkin', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'imaginative', 'approach', 'fairly', 'unoriginal', 'material', 'making', 'up', 'lack', 'substance', 'extracting', 'top', 'performances', 'actors', 'real', 'strength', 'Heartbreakers', 'however', 'fact', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'look', 'deep', 'enough', 'may', 'find', 'insight', 'human', 'nature', 'most', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'nothing', 'fun', 'mind', 'entertaining', 'laughs', 'nice', 'moments', 'easy', 'eyes', 'let', 'movie', 'will', 'let', 'off', 'hook', 'awhile', 'show', 'good', 'time', 'money', 'not', 'such', 'bad', 'deal']",N/A

You won't glean valuable insights into the meaning of the universe, as heartthrob Jason Lee innocently seeks in this lightweight offering, but you will have been pleasantly entertained. The unlikely cast of Weaver, Hewitt, Hackman, and Liotta work suprisingly well. Call it ""The Sting"" lite. This amusing farce revolves around the exploits of a mother and daughter team of gold digging grifters. Jennifer Love Hewitt as the daughter supplies plenty of eye candy, but her acting skills and comedic timing are first rate. I suspect we will be seeing a lot more of her in the future. You gotta love Gene Hackman as an obnoxious, unrepentant tobacco billionaire who's face seems to be perpetually obscured in a cloud of  cigarette smoke. Ray Liotta does not look much older than he did in ""Goodfellas"" and is hilarious as a shady businessman/love interest for Sigourney Weaver who in a rare comedic appearance, turns in a humorous performance.

It said &quot;My only problem with the film is it had too much cleavage.&quot;  Besides both gold digging women discovering they passed up a treasure more valuable, love with a man who really cares for them. The film is about the power of cleavage. So if you are not a guy who wants to drool over Jennifer Love Hewitt in dresses so short you can see the bottom of her panties. Or a woman who enjoys watching powerful moneyed men crumble into tiny piles of crumbs at sight of women in lacy garments, you have no business viewing this movie.Heartbreakers is about a mother daughter con team. The mother woos and marries the target then the daughter lures him into a compromising position where they are discovered and the two collect a lucrative divorce settlement. Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) pulls a double con on her own daughter to keep her from going off on her own and breaking up the team. Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt) meanwhile works behind her mother's back on a good hearted bartentender/ beach comber who has some property that might be worth some money to some developers. Both get in a little over their heads as former-mark Liotta re-enters the picture and Page comes to realize she is having to fight real feelings for her target.Hackman is a little too cartoony and some of the situations and motivations feel contrived. But after being immersed in the film for an hour or so you begin to go along with it. Heartbreakers is silly stupid slapstick fun for the first hour and then begins to develop its real story in the last half hour where the characters are allowed to have some real feelings. It takes a while to get going but it will eventually win you over.

There is enough air in the beginning romp to draw you in. It is only when you find yourself predicting exact lines and jokes that you begin to wonder if there is much meat left past the first hour.As the mother in a mother-daughter con-woman pair, Sigourney Weaver is by turns comical and lascivious. Subjective opinion: I found her significantly more fetching than the younger Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is pesky as usual but teenagers and brain candy diehards may find her entertaining in that lightly adoloscent way. Liotta I simply feel sorry for, what a tragic waste of Goodfellas calibre talent. Gene Hackman serves reliably as an aging stumblebum, but gets no more than ten minutes of actual screentime.The theme has an unmistakable halo of the much sharper Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which leaves one hoping for that clever twist that never quite materializes. Instead the film breaks into a half-bummed pondering of profound issues: the need for the mother to Let Go, the importance of true love that trumps a grifter's dayjob, and suchlike.

538675,AE684YFOXJVHW,B00003CXWL,Skip Jones,"[4, 17]","This movie was completely irritating.  Here are ten (10) observations:1. Who ever told Jennifer Love Hewett she could act?2. Nothing really happens in this film. It's one establishing shot after another, after another. We see characters opening and closing doors, getting in and out of automobiles, walking into restaurants... for about two hours.3. The dialogue is largely meaningless. It's like watching people speak in esperanto or some language entirely foreign to earth. This is because:4. The characters in this film are completely the figment of someone's imagination, with no roots in reality. If anyone could relate to the characters that Ray Liotta, Sigourney Weaver, Love Hewett or Gene Hackman portrayed, I'd certainly like to interview them for ""Sixty Minutes"".5. After about forty minutes into the film, Sigourney Weaver breaks into song. I hoped that her rendition of ""Back in the USSR"" was the low point of the film, but unfortunately, I was wrong.6. The whole concept behind this film was rather formulaic, with a rather poor foundation. The end result is something from the bizarro world, like a $450,000.00 home built from clapboard and thrown-out furniture crates.7. For the last hour or so, the film unravels spectacularly, much like a burning Zeplin heading down to earth. However, this film was not as bad as ""AI: Artificial Intelligence"", because that film was in a class of awfulness all by itself. Even so, it was still a hateful experience to watch ""Heartbreakers"".8. I hope that in the future, someone will purchase this film, dispense with all the dialogue, and rearrange each scene into a more credible story, a la Woody Allen's ""What's Up Tiger Lilly"".9. One nice thing about the movie is that you can leave the dvd running, and take a long break to get something to eat, come back to watch the movie, and not really miss anything.10. Would I recommend ""Heartbreakers"" to my friends? Sure..

It's so sneaky & crafty. And the scenery is beautiful (even though I see it everyday since I live in South Florida). Love-Hewitt really works it too, but Sigourney steals the show, especially as she pretends to be a wealthy Russian woman trying to get Gene Hackman's old, chain-smoking-and-ready-to-drop-dead character to marry her. And Love-Hewitt wants to run her own scam which she's doing behind her mother's back. I don't want to give anything else away.

538686,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXWL,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","A comedy about two female grifters, ""Heartbreakers"" is just a good showcase of today's talents of Hollywood -- Weaver, Hackman, Hewitt and Liotta -- but ends up with a half-baked work.  Should its director's chair be handed to a French (or anyone from Europe), it could be much better.  As it is, it misses many marks though it still is enjoyable ... sometimes.The concept is this: Weaver & Hewitt, both sexy with a wide cleavage, live a life of con-women, fooling dumb...guys.  But that's not all.  They are really a mother and a daughter, and the latter is now about to leave her mom's domineering reign, to start a new life as a grifter of her own.  But the  daughter happens to meet a good-natured guy, and her mom, knowing that, try to induce her to deceive this honest new ""boyfriend"".  In the meanwhile, Mother got another target in the shape of rich Gene Hackman, who is likely to drop dead next moment....The premise is interesting, and the performance is all good, including the pouting-mouthed daughter Jennifer Love Hewitt, and the silly boss of stolen-car dealers Ray Liotta (who seems to have recovered a thankless role of being part of dinner at Dr. Hannibal).  The film has some good moments, especially when Sigourney Weaver sings a Beatles song ""Back in the USSR"" with Russian accent, and Hackman again provides his still underused comic sense here.But it is the director David Mirkin (of ""Romy & Michele's High School Reunion"" fame) that doesn't know what to do with these first-rate cast in order to generate genuine, comical momentum, giving too much unnecessary stress on the repeated clithe in character and story (just count the chances to see those leading ladies' clevarage).  To make matters worse, he misses every good opportunity that could have created hilarious moment -- Weaver's joyful song is cut short, Hackman is given too short time, etc. and lovely Hewitt always looks sullen.  And the worst is the mother-daughter relation, which often looks like one between mortal enemies.  Watch out how many times this mom exploits her daughter, tripping Ms Hewitt's leg in a hotel to get a room for free, spying on her date with a boy, and finally talking her into deceiving him to get money, and, moreover, delectable Jennifer almost is convinced !Oh, I know it's a comedy, and I know she will relent and be sorry in the end, but it takes too much time till there (almost 2 hours) and moreover, lovely Hewitt seems to be spending her life, always grumbling under the shadow of her mom.  So why  don't you leave her once and for all?  After all, the trouble is coming from the fact that the film is afraid of involving  the matter of sex, and by including substitute gags, renders the whole work just another Hollywood clithe-ridden comedy.  Give this one some edge, with straightforward comments on sexual matters, or make it snappy.

538687,A16GAIJJE39T1S,B00003CXWL,Ulfilas,"[0, 0]","Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play a mother-daughter team of con-artists where the mother tricks some rich guy into marrying her, and then the daughter seduces him into cheating on the mother.  The mother then divorces the guy and lands a big settlement.  Their plans go wrong in a number of different ways--the final misstep occurring when the daughter falls for one of their marks, a lovable dimwit bar-owner.  Some of the schemes hatched by these girls are genuinely funny--look for the bellboy who they distract with a glance of Hewitt partially undressed to get out of paying their hotel bill!  In the end, however, the characters in this movie are too lacking in depth for me to care very much what happens to them.The one character that I found somewhat interesting was an unscrupulous New Jersey wiseguy played by Ray Liotta--who had also been one of the girls' marks.  Unlike the others characters, Liotta's guy is neither a dope, nor a complete scoundrel.  He likes a good score as much as the next con man, but draws the line at ruining the life of somebody who's done nothing wrong.  In a way, he seems to subscribe to the code expressed by George C. Scott's character (""You can't cheat an honest man"") in the memorable old movieThe Flim-Flam Man (1967).At the time this movie was made, Hewitt was considered THE hot babe in Hollywood.  She does look quite appealing in this movie.  Nevertheless, I would not consider this movie worth buying or renting.
