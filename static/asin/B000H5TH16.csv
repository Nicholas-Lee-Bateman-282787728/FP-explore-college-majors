Almost every episode was a poorly contrived rip off... sorry, 'homage' to a recent movie.  The characters were inconsistent and the writing was weak and sloppy.  And don't get me started on that dreary, depressing and unsatisfactory ending.It is irresponsible and wrong to have ended the show the way they did, especially when in this series vampirism was used as a metaphor for addiction. What does that say exactly?  If you're an addict just give up now because it's hopeless and your struggles are for nothing? Nick deserved better than that.

1009269,A1RXXFG6310KZF,B000H5TH16,Amazon Customer,"[4, 9]","This last and final episode to the title show's episodes of ""Forever Knight"" ended in the title ""Last Knight"".  It was truly compelling, though I think not as creative on the question of the 2 characters Nick and Natalie as to whether they would remain together or not.  The last scene with Natalie desiring to stay with her Nick forever was slightly tempestuous of him renigging since Nick was all too quick to add Det. Vetter into ""His"" Fold.I always believe that the whole premise of the show just would not be the same without ""Natalie's"" character.  It would be void of ""Love"".  She brought so much energy and steel character that even though she may have not received what she asked for in the end, she got in Eternity with Nick, unless LaCroix brought her across in those final moments we were not privvy to see.  I think the end of the show was poorly executed.  Natalie should have come over into the Vampire Fold because she not only deserved it, she asked and Nick appeared confused far too much.  He didn't seem to be confused about bring over ""Det. Vetter"".If he could do this for someone he knew in one last episode, they, the writers, of which Gyrant Wyn Davies, as Nick Knight's character was also the director and should have seen the value of a more happier ending and a less troublesome one to the viewer since this was The Last and Final Episode.The episode was somewhat problematic because it starts with a suicide and ends with the demise of Nick Knight, Det. Vetter and let's not forget Natalie.  We see LaCroix in the background trying to give anecdotes throughout the scenes, but I think in vain since it is clearly shown he is ""moving on"" as he tells Nick.  Too much for one episode.  There should have been a 2-part show ender rather than a crunch one.The climactic end is surely dramatic but should have had an even more dramatic ending.  We never really know whether Natalie is choosing to leave the Police Station due to her friend's earlier suicide or because of Nick.  The whole last episode is simply put, as if in a ""Dream Like State"".  As if it were all a dream and we will all wake up with Season 4, though we all know that it never happens.

1009279,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000H5TH16,D. S. Thurlow,"[34, 38]","In its third season, cult favorite ""Forever Knight"" continues a fine tradition of excellent, even thought-provoking storytelling while concluding the saga of Nick Knight, 13th Century vampire and 20th Century Toronto homicide detective.In the opening double episode of the season, ""Black Buddha"", a deranged bomber destroys an airliner leaving Toronto, precipitating a major shakeup in the cast of ""Forever Knight.""  Knight's partner and his precinct captain are killed in the crash.  Knight's new partner is Tracy Vetter, an inexperienced and often impulsive detective whose father happens to be police commissioner.  Her arrival allows an interesting plot twist.  Tracy falls in love with the boyishly charming vampire Vashon, but remains unaware that Nick is also a vampire, leading to a series of humorously ironic situations, notably in the episode ""My Boyfriend is a Vampire."".Season Three continues the themes of the series.  Nick hungers for redemption and struggles with the guilt of 800 years of killing.  He continues to work through a complicated relationship with police coroner and close confidant Natalie Lambert.  Their love for each other will come to drive several episodes and the ending of the series.As in Seasons One and Two, actions relentlessly have consequences; Nick's life is repeatedly made complex by his struggle to balance his vampire nature against his instinct to act for good.  Nick's tendency to resort to his vampire abilities to solve crime sometimes complicates the cases or threatens the intended moral outcome.Nick's vampire mentor LaCroix plays a large role, continuing his delicate wrestling match with Natalie for Nick's soul while sometimes bailing Nick out of trouble.  Nick will try to return the favor when LaCroix faces his own long estranged and vengeful vampire mentor in ""Ashes to Ashes"".Jeanette, Nick's fellow vampire and sometime lover from the first two seasons, has ""moved on"" but resurfaces in ""The Human Factor"" to validate Nick's search for his lost humanity and to offer a seeming alternate pathway back to it.As all good things must come to an end, so does the season and the series.  In the dramatic ""Last Knight"", Nick resolves his relationships with Vetter, LaCroix and Natalie.  The ending is one every fan of the series will want to watch.Season Three is highly recommended to fans of ""Forever Knight"" as the final 22 episodes of a series that managed to be highly entertaining and often thoughtful despite a limited budget.

However, when the cast was changed (mentioned elsewhere) the look, feel, and overall flavor of the show diminished.I n many episodes, Nick was reduced to pimping the Vetter character because (whether due to writing, or poor acting) despite being the Commissioner's daughter, she simply was not a good cop.  Case in point, in one episode, the villain is hiding behind the door, Vetter bursts in, but never looks to her right, thus  enabling the killer to grab hold of her.  In another episode, she goes undercover and gives her prostitution ring employer her actual home telephone number, knowing that a killer is targeting women at the agency.  In yet another episode, when retelling how Nick comes to be shot, she twists the story to make it sound like she had these terrific instinct that they were in danger (she actually only pulled her gun in the deserted warehouse when she sees Nick pull his), she later returns to the warehouse based on a call from someone she does not know late at night without backup or letting anyone know what she was doing.  Despite this, Nick spends half his time telling her and others what a good cop she is.  As for the addition of Vachon, I suggest that if you do not wish to be forced into a coma, you fastforward all his scenes, as the actor walks through the role as if thought were beyond him (despite being a vampire, he is just as dim as Vetter, perhaps that's why they get along so well.)",3,Cast Changes Hurt the show,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,1553,"['Forever', 'Knight', 'was', 'good', 'campy', 'Saturday', 'Early', 'Evening', 'came', '6:00', '7:00pm', 'fun', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'However', 'when', 'cast', 'was', 'changed', 'mentioned', 'elsewhere', 'look', 'feel', 'overall', 'flavor', 'show', 'n', 'many', 'episodes', 'Nick', 'was', 'reduced', 'pimping', 'Vetter', 'character', 'due', 'writing', 'poor', 'acting', 'being', 'Commissioner', 'daughter', 'simply', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'cop', 'Case', 'point', 'one', 'episode', 'villain', 'hiding', 'door', 'Vetter', 'never', 'right', 'thus', 'enabling', 'killer', 'grab', 'hold', 'episode', 'undercover', 'prostitution', 'ring', 'employer', 'actual', 'home', 'telephone', 'number', 'knowing', 'killer', 'targeting', 'women', 'agency', 'yet', 'episode', 'when', 'retelling', 'how', 'Nick', 'be', 'shot', 'story', 'make', 'sound', 'had', 'terrific', 'instinct', 'were', 'danger', 'actually', 'only', 'pulled', 'gun', 'deserted', 'warehouse', 'when', 'Nick', 'pull', 'later', 'warehouse', 'based', 'call', 'someone', 'not', 'know', 'late', 'night', 'backup', 'letting', 'anyone', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Nick', 'time', 'telling', 'others', 'what', 'good', 'cop', 'addition', 'Vachon', 'suggest', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'be', 'forced', 'coma', 'fastforward', 'scenes', 'actor', 'role', 'thought', 'were', 'being', 'vampire', 'just', 'as', 'dim', 'Vetter', 'perhaps', 'why', 'get', 'along', 'so', 'well']",N/A

Nick's life in Toronto is beginning to end as the series opens.  In the first episode both his partner and boss are replaced and not for the better.  In the vampire world Janette has moved on.  Nick's new partner, Tracey Vetter, a rather annoyingly perky young woman has stumbled upon the existence of vampires, a secret that she is intent on keeping from Nick.  As the season progresses the stories do improve, particularly those involving Tracey and Vachon, 'her' vampire. The stories are interesting and well done for the most part.The final episode is compelling but will certainly cause fans of the series to scream 'no' and frantically search for a loophole.The downside to this set, besides being the final episodes, is the lack of extras.

1009292,A3USZM6HYVCIRZ,B000H5TH16,Roger M. Longo,"[9, 10]","This is one of the better TV series in the horror genre and can be compared to such classic series as Have Gun Will Travel and Kung Fu. There are elements of Have Gun Will Travel in the shows in terms of philosophical musings on the part of the character LeCroix. The central character, Nick Knight is driven by the tension between the intrinsicly violent, sociopathic nature of a vampire and the vestages of humanity that remain within him. His role as a police officer becomes the focus for this tension and can be seen as what psychologists might refer to as reaction formation. As a police officer he is repressing the violent and criminal tendencies in others who threaten the social fabric while, at the same time, trying to cope with his own plight reinforced by is idealistic views. Nick Knight's idealism is cast against LeCroix's (Nick's unwanted mentor) dark pessimistic views of human nature. This point is underscored in the season and series finale. In the final analysis this series is a classic by virtue of the intelligent scripts that attempt to grapple with larger philosophical questions. In this regard there are also parallels with the classic series Kung Fu starring David Caradine as Kane. Both Kane and Nick Night exist on the cusp of a moral delemma regarding human nature and violence, although the resolutions are quite different. I can recommend Seasons one, two, and three of Forever Knight (I have purchased all of them and I am pleased with the product) for those who have enjoyed Have Gun Will Travel (an excellent series - DVDs for the three available seasons well worth the purchase) and Kung Fu (also an excellent series with the three seasons worth owning).",5,Forever Knight: Season 3,1173398400,"03 9, 2007",2007,1694,"['one', 'better', 'TV', 'series', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'such', 'classic', 'series', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'are', 'elements', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'shows', 'terms', 'philosophical', 'musings', 'part', 'character', 'LeCroix', 'central', 'character', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'driven', 'tension', 'intrinsicly', 'violent', 'sociopathic', 'nature', 'vampire', 'vestages', 'humanity', 'remain', 'role', 'police', 'officer', 'focus', 'tension', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'what', 'might', 'refer', 'reaction', 'formation', 'police', 'officer', 'repressing', 'violent', 'criminal', 'tendencies', 'others', 'who', 'threaten', 'social', 'fabric', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'cope', 'own', 'plight', 'reinforced', 'idealistic', 'views', 'Nick', 'Knight', 'idealism', 'cast', 'LeCroix', 'Nick', 'unwanted', 'mentor', 'dark', 'pessimistic', 'views', 'human', 'nature', 'point', 'underscored', 'season', 'series', 'finale', 'final', 'analysis', 'series', 'classic', 'virtue', 'intelligent', 'attempt', 'grapple', 'larger', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'regard', 'are', 'also', 'parallels', 'classic', 'series', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'starring', 'David', 'Caradine', 'Kane', 'Both', 'Kane', 'Nick', 'Night', 'exist', 'cusp', 'moral', 'delemma', 'regarding', 'human', 'nature', 'violence', 'resolutions', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'can', 'recommend', 'Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'have', 'purchased', 'am', 'pleased', 'product', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'excellent', 'series', 'DVDs', 'three', 'available', 'seasons', 'well', 'purchase', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'also', 'excellent', 'series', 'three', 'seasons', 'owning']",N/A
1009293,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B000H5TH16,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[1, 3]","Finally, after years of fan petitions and pleading, the final season of Forever Knight has been released. Season three of Forever Knight saw the departure of several core cast members (John Kapelos Deborah Duchene), and Nick's new partner, blond-and-perky replacement Tracy Vetter (Lisa Ryder), doesn't live up to the quirky jokes and weird fetishes of Nick's former partner Donald Schanke (Kapelos was the only series cast member to have starred in the original 1989 pilotNick Knight).The writing also seemed more uneven than in the second season, where the show truly hit its stride. Part of this is due to the two-part season opener Black Buddha, in which the new characters such as Captain Joe Reese (Blu Mankuma) and Javier Vachon (Ben Bass) are explained. My major complaint with the setup was that Nick's new partner Tracy falls in love with Spanish vampire Javier Vachon (Ben Bass, the one redeeming addition to the season), yet doesn't catch on that her own partner is a vamp.As for guest stars, keep your eyes peeled for several famous guests this season. Fans of the Canadian vampire TV series Blood Ties (2006 TV Series) will want to look for Christina Cox (Vicki Nelson on Blood Ties) as Joan of Arc, and there's a whole episode starring Callum Keith Rennie, the gritty, high-strung replacement Ray on the final season ofDue South: Season Three (4-DVD Digipack). Hayden Christensen (yes, THAT Hayden fromStar Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)) makes an appearance in ""Fallen Idol.""Overall, this season felt lacking; there were only a handful of episodes that really captured my imagination, including ""Blind Faith,"" in which a woman struggling with MS and blindness finds out her guide dog Perry is not what he seems, ""Outside the Lines,"" featuring Callum Keith Rennie as a high-strung undercover cop who's gone over the edge, ""Fever,"" in which Javier, Screed, Nick and Lacroix are infected by a form of vampiric AIDS, and ""Night in Question,"" which features Nick suffering from amnesia after being shot point-blank with a cop-killer bullet. The series finale ""Dark Knight"" may not have been the ending that the show's more romantic fans may have wanted to see, but it was perfectly in line with the show's mood and former story arcs.Picture quality looks like it was transferred directly from the original tape; sound is decent. Extras are slightly improved from the no-frills first season box, and special mention goes out to Kristin's three fabulous fan videos. Her website KnightVision came to my attention several years ago; she uses series footage from Forever Knight and other vampire-themed movies and series to create slick, professional music videos. Columbia Tristar even allowed her to use the original Lori Yates / Fred Mollin audio tracks fromForever Knight: Original Television Soundtrack. Kristin also has a ton of FK bloopers and alternate takes on her site that weren't released on the official box sets.A worthy investment for series fans (it would be nice to see this released as a series box, much like was done recently withBeauty and the Beast - The Complete Series), but if you're new to the Forever Knight phenomenon, you're better off starting out withForever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993). Forever Knight influenced later vampire detective shows such asAngel - Seasons 1-5 30-Disc DVD Set,Moonlight - The Complete Series, and Blood Ties (2006 TV Series), and although it didn't have a huge budget or a commercial success so much as a cult following, it's still a memorable show with much to say on the ills of modern society and how our past continues to haunt our present.",4,The final curtain for Nick Knight and crew,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,3653,"['Finally', 'years', 'fan', 'petitions', 'pleading', 'final', 'season', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'been', 'released', 'Season', 'three', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'saw', 'departure', 'several', 'core', 'cast', 'members', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'Deborah', 'Duchene', 'Nick', 'new', 'partner', 'blond-and-perky', 'replacement', 'Tracy', 'Vetter', 'Lisa', 'Ryder', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'quirky', 'jokes', 'weird', 'fetishes', 'Nick', 'former', 'partner', 'Donald', 'Schanke', 'Kapelos', 'was', 'only', 'series', 'cast', 'member', 'have', 'starred', 'original', '1989', 'pilotNick', 'Knight', '.The', 'writing', 'also', 'seemed', 'more', 'uneven', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'show', 'truly', 'hit', 'stride', 'Part', 'due', 'two-part', 'season', 'opener', 'Black', 'Buddha', 'new', 'characters', 'such', 'Captain', 'Joe', 'Reese', 'Blu', 'Mankuma', 'Javier', 'Vachon', 'Ben', 'Bass', 'are', 'explained', 'major', 'complaint', 'setup', 'was', 'Nick', 'new', 'partner', 'Tracy', 'love', 'Spanish', 'vampire', 'Javier', 'Vachon', 'Ben', 'Bass', 'one', 'redeeming', 'addition', 'season', 'yet', ""n't"", 'catch', 'own', 'partner', 'vamp.As', 'guest', 'stars', 'keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'several', 'famous', 'guests', 'season', 'Fans', 'Canadian', 'vampire', 'TV', 'series', 'Blood', 'Ties', '2006', 'TV', 'Series', 'will', 'want', 'look', 'Christina', 'Cox', 'Vicki', 'Nelson', 'Blood', 'Ties', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'whole', 'episode', 'starring', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'gritty', 'high-strung', 'replacement', 'Ray', 'final', 'season', 'ofDue', 'South', 'Season', 'Three', '4-DVD', 'Digipack', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'yes', 'THAT', 'Hayden', 'fromStar', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'III', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'appearance', 'Fallen', 'Idol', 'Overall', 'season', 'felt', 'lacking', 'were', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'really', 'captured', 'imagination', 'including', 'Blind', 'Faith', 'woman', 'struggling', 'MS', 'blindness', 'out', 'guide', 'dog', 'Perry', 'not', 'what', 'Lines', 'featuring', 'Callum', 'Keith', 'Rennie', 'high-strung', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'gone', 'edge', 'Fever', 'Javier', 'Screed', 'Nick', 'Lacroix', 'are', 'infected', 'form', 'vampiric', 'AIDS', 'Night', 'Question', 'Nick', 'suffering', 'amnesia', 'being', 'shot', 'point-blank', 'cop-killer', 'bullet', 'series', 'finale', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'ending', 'show', 'more', 'romantic', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'perfectly', 'line', 'show', 'mood', 'former', 'story', 'arcs.Picture', 'quality', 'was', 'transferred', 'directly', 'original', 'tape', 'sound', 'decent', 'Extras', 'are', 'slightly', 'improved', 'no-frills', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'special', 'mention', 'out', 'Kristin', 'three', 'fabulous', 'fan', 'videos', 'website', 'KnightVision', 'came', 'attention', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'series', 'footage', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'other', 'vampire-themed', 'movies', 'series', 'create', 'slick', 'professional', 'music', 'videos', 'Columbia', 'Tristar', 'even', 'allowed', 'use', 'original', 'Lori', 'Yates', '/', 'Fred', 'Mollin', 'audio', 'tracks', 'Knight', 'Original', 'Television', 'Soundtrack', 'Kristin', 'also', 'ton', 'FK', 'bloopers', 'alternate', 'site', 'were', ""n't"", 'released', 'official', 'box', 'sets.A', 'worthy', 'investment', 'series', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'see', 'released', 'series', 'box', 'much', 'was', 'done', 'recently', 'withBeauty', 'Beast', 'Complete', 'Series', ""'re"", 'new', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'phenomenon', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'starting', 'out', 'withForever', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'Part', '1', '1992', '1993', 'Forever', 'Knight', 'influenced', 'later', 'vampire', 'detective', 'shows', 'such', 'asAngel', 'Seasons', '1-5', '30-Disc', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Moonlight', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Blood', 'Ties', '2006', 'TV', 'Series', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'huge', 'budget', 'commercial', 'success', 'so', 'much', 'cult', 'following', 'still', 'memorable', 'show', 'much', 'say', 'ills', 'modern', 'society', 'how', 'past', 'haunt', 'present']",N/A

At first it was the first oneline attempt to save a show (most of the protest sites can still be found on goggle; and some still have protest letters you can send to the producers but it's all over now but the the shoutin' and all the actors have gone on to other projects).  This show was goth before there was a word for goth.  Emo before emo was a word.  But both those tags are disingenous.  This show was prophetic in that it depicted socially rejected people in the 90's before nirvana ever hit a chord on the guitar and before bevis and butthead ever hit the air.  It was socially relevant before most shows had the balls to represent the rejected. Fans who know it and recognize it you must inform all the others who don't know what this series represents.  While this is one of the most fan beloved shows on tv (the protests on its 3rd successive cancelation launched the very first ever oneline campain to save a TV show!) it has fallen into obscurity (look at the rankings on previous seasons).  I will not say like my previous listing that this release is totaly for the fans. But, i will say all the fans owe it to buffy, angel, stargate, stargate atlantis, firefly, smallville, timecop, 24 (the lead from this series is a baddie in one of the seasons of 24 look it up!), battlestar galatica, highlander (movies and tv), lost, the prisoner, the avengers (yes the whole run), alias, wonder woman, dark angel, supernatural, the man from u.n.c.l.e, babylon 5, the tomorrow people , I spy, the X-files (which were also for the first five i think seasons produced in the same part of toronto), due south, friday the 13th the series, (i could go on but i hope u know what i mean by now that this series was the first in a line...) and many, many lesser known shows, buy this offering now. It is both a fan favorite and a pice of TV history.  Many, many series owe thier life to this series.  It's a must see.  Many of the previously listed series (some are not, some are not listed! like i have all day to list them) derive some plot point of inspiration form this series.  It is truely a must see for fans of the genre and fans of TV drama all around (like the smallville and the Buffy ref is in one episode only each i leave it up to fans to list it!)",5,My last reviews were all trashed but i have to try again,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2337,"['ever', 'series', 'was', 'canceled', 'what', '1992', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'crying', 'out', 'first', 'was', 'first', 'oneline', 'attempt', 'save', 'show', 'most', 'protest', 'sites', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'found', 'goggle', 'still', 'have', 'protest', 'letters', 'can', 'send', 'producers', 'over', 'now', 'shoutin', 'actors', 'have', 'gone', 'other', 'projects', 'show', 'was', 'goth', 'was', 'word', 'goth', 'Emo', 'emo', 'was', 'word', 'tags', 'are', 'disingenous', 'show', 'was', 'prophetic', 'depicted', 'socially', 'rejected', 'people', '90', 'nirvana', 'ever', 'hit', 'chord', 'guitar', 'bevis', 'butthead', 'ever', 'hit', 'air', 'was', 'socially', 'relevant', 'most', 'shows', 'had', 'balls', 'represent', 'rejected', 'Fans', 'who', 'know', 'recognize', 'must', 'inform', 'others', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'fan', 'beloved', 'shows', 'tv', 'protests', '3rd', 'successive', 'cancelation', 'launched', 'very', 'first', 'ever', 'oneline', 'campain', 'save', 'TV', 'show', 'fallen', 'obscurity', 'look', 'rankings', 'previous', 'seasons', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'previous', 'listing', 'release', 'totaly', 'fans', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'fans', 'owe', 'buffy', 'angel', 'stargate', 'stargate', 'atlantis', 'firefly', 'smallville', 'timecop', '24', 'lead', 'series', 'baddie', 'one', 'seasons', '24', 'look', 'battlestar', 'galatica', 'highlander', 'movies', 'tv', 'lost', 'prisoner', 'avengers', 'whole', 'run', 'alias', 'wonder', 'woman', 'dark', 'angel', 'supernatural', 'man', 'u.n.c.l.e', 'babylon', '5', 'tomorrow', 'people', 'spy', 'X-files', 'were', 'also', 'first', 'five', 'i', 'think', 'seasons', 'produced', 'same', 'part', 'toronto', 'due', 'south', 'friday', '13th', 'series', 'i', 'could', 'go', 'i', 'hope', 'u', 'know', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'now', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'line', 'many', 'many', 'lesser', 'known', 'shows', 'buy', 'offering', 'now', 'fan', 'favorite', 'pice', 'TV', 'history', 'Many', 'many', 'series', 'owe', 'thier', 'life', 'series', 'must', 'see', 'Many', 'previously', 'listed', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'listed', 'i', 'have', 'day', 'list', 'derive', 'plot', 'point', 'inspiration', 'form', 'series', 'truely', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'genre', 'fans', 'TV', 'drama', 'smallville', 'Buffy', 'ref', 'one', 'episode', 'only', 'i', 'leave', 'fans', 'list']",N/A
1009298,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B000H5TH16,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[0, 2]","First off, I love Forever Knight, nay, I worship the series. In every way, it is the best, most profound vampire series ever created, with some of the best written characters in any genre of fiction. Like most of the other fans of this series, this was my least favourite season, but that's like saying that this is my slowest race car. It's still mind blowing and superior to anything on air today (with only Heroes and 24 remotely coming close).What are the negatives to this season? Well, for starters, they killed off most of the main characters, with only Nick, Natalie, and Lacroix remaining (Janette makes a very interesting one episode appearance). The new characters they introduce are, for the most part, not up to par with their earlier counterparts (Lisa Ryder, in her early years, does not display much acting ability and her character isn't very believable). Vachon never really draws us in the way a vampire should, and Traci doesn't seem as if she capable of making coffee for a bunch of cops, let alone being one of them. The episodes that centre on Traci and Vachon can be rather tedious, and for the most part, I simply skip over them.What are the positives for this season? Well, some of the most compelling storylines ever to be introduced are freatured in the third. Nick is possessed by a demon and Lacroix must overcome his skepticism in order to save him. A vampiric plague is introduced, and the entire vampire species is at risk for extinction. And of course the final episode, which deals with God, the afterlife, love, faith, and the enduring bond between Nick and Lacroix.Honestly, if you are a die hard fan, you must own this season if for nothing else but to have the complete series. If you are a new fan, you really should start from the beginning, but in my opinion the second season has the best storylines and the most Lacroix (my favourite vampire of all time!). But to all, give Forever Knight a chance, and it will become your favourite series instantly. Every element that makes the vampire tales so amazing is displayed like nowhere else in this programme. The flashbacks are mesmerizing, the costumes are gorgeous, the writing is masterful, and the acting is superb. This is not simply a series about vampires; it is about the deepest levels of the human pysche and our longing for meaning and higher truth.

I loved the characters Nick, Natalie, Lacroix, Jeanette and most definately Vachon!  The only thing about the 3rd and last season is that I cannot look at the last two shows again due to all of the characters were killed off which broke my heart.  I wish the writers could have had more of a happy ending for the characters.  It would have been nice if Nick brought Natailie across and lived happily ever after as well as Vachon.  I never really liked the character Tracy Vetter though, in my opinion Vachon and Tracy just didn't fit together.",5,Cheesy show but I Loved It!!,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,620,"[""'m"", 'still', 'mourning', 'cancellation', 'show', 'even', 'almost', '20', 'yrs', 'loved', 'characters', 'Nick', 'Natalie', 'Lacroix', 'Jeanette', 'most', 'definately', 'Vachon', 'only', 'thing', '3rd', 'last', 'season', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'last', 'two', 'shows', 'again', 'due', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'broke', 'heart', 'wish', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'happy', 'ending', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Nick', 'brought', 'Natailie', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'as', 'well', 'Vachon', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'Tracy', 'Vetter', 'opinion', 'Vachon', 'Tracy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together']",N/A
