When I did see it I was really disppointed. There was very little violence at all, and what there was went too fast. In the final shootout at the end (which I thought would be a huge, explosive borderline massacre by the police) was a poorly choreographed hotel gunfight. Steve McQueen could have done better.

A strong cast led by Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw makes does good work with a plot that was original in its time  and still keeps up the suspence after years of inferior spin-offs. Sam  Peckinpah's directing is outstanding and the score by Quincy Jones is one  of the best ever. Better in my opinion than his work for the Pawnbroker.

Pacing and editing seem to be Peckingpah's forte'. However, the actions scenes are directed with economy and style, not the mindless action scenes we see today, where a director overload scenes with endless explosions and gunplay. Penningpah always tried for some realism when it came to violence; although some say he exploited it by filming gory bloodshed in slow motion.  One thing I have noticed about his films is that he has the uncanny ability to switch between actions scenes and locations with seamless precision.  Just by the action scenes alone I can immediately identify his directorial style.One of the robbers who double crosses  the Steven McQueen and Ali MacGraw characters in the film is played by Al Lettieri, who almost steals the film from McQueen,  something few actor have done. With his stocky build and wild mustache he is hard to ignore. He is a character totally without any principals, but he seems as indestructible as the Terminator. However, this menacing looking actor is probably best known as playing Virgil Sollozo in the Godfather.Apparently, the music in the film was changed by McQueen, much to the dismay of Peckingpah. However, in hindsight it was the right move, because the music fits perfectly with the action. When the action begins harmonica solos are heard, which add to the drama. The music was arranged by Quincy Jones.In 1994 an inferior remake was made starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, which apparently lifted many scenes from the original.",4,Good action flick,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1699,"['Gateway', 'everything', 'desired', 'action', 'flick', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'bank', 'robbery', 'scene', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'shootout', 'end', 'Peckingpah', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Pacing', 'editing', 'seem', 'be', 'Peckingpah', 'forte', 'However', 'actions', 'scenes', 'are', 'directed', 'economy', 'style', 'not', 'mindless', 'action', 'scenes', 'see', 'today', 'where', 'director', 'overload', 'scenes', 'endless', 'explosions', 'gunplay', 'Penningpah', 'always', 'tried', 'realism', 'when', 'came', 'violence', 'say', 'exploited', 'filming', 'gory', 'bloodshed', 'slow', 'motion', 'One', 'thing', 'have', 'noticed', 'films', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'switch', 'actions', 'scenes', 'locations', 'seamless', 'precision', 'Just', 'action', 'alone', 'can', 'immediately', 'identify', 'directorial', 'style.One', 'robbers', 'who', 'double', 'Steven', 'McQueen', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'characters', 'film', 'played', 'Al', 'Lettieri', 'who', 'almost', 'film', 'McQueen', 'something', 'few', 'actor', 'have', 'done', 'stocky', 'build', 'wild', 'mustache', 'hard', 'ignore', 'character', 'totally', 'principals', 'as', 'indestructible', 'Terminator', 'However', 'menacing', 'looking', 'actor', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Virgil', 'Sollozo', 'Godfather.Apparently', 'music', 'film', 'was', 'changed', 'McQueen', 'much', 'dismay', 'Peckingpah', 'However', 'hindsight', 'was', 'right', 'move', 'music', 'perfectly', 'action', 'When', 'action', 'harmonica', 'solos', 'are', 'heard', 'add', 'drama', 'music', 'was', 'arranged', 'Quincy', 'Jones.In', '1994', 'inferior', 'remake', 'was', 'made', 'starring', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'apparently', 'lifted', 'many', 'scenes', 'original']",N/A

No matter what kind of movie he stars in he knows how to lead and this movie is no exception.  The editing can be a bit confusing at times especially at the beginning.  Other than that I found the movie to be quite a thrill ride with very real tough situations for the two main characters who are on the run after a few screw-ups brought on by betrayal and secrets involving a bank heist.  I have seen the remake first and I liked it but it seemed to lack some pop this original provides.  Any fan of Steve McQueen should definitely own this action crime film.  Sam Peckinpaw delivers his usual scenes of wild gunfights and pulls no punches.  It isn't The Wild Bunch necessarily but it's also a different type of movie.

Peckinpah goes a little mild in this film, especially when compared to such other films of his as the Wild Bunch, but this movie is still pretty violent, and has a lot of action.  Doc (McQueen) is a newly paroled prisoner who, in exchange for his freedom, agrees to do a job for the man (Ben Johnson) who helped him get parole.  What Doc doesn't know is that his wife (McGraw) also had to sleep with this man to gain her husband's freedom.  The result, when Doc finds out, is that he and his wife spend most of the movie squabbling about their relationship while they try to get safely to the Mexican border.Basically, the plot of the movie revolves around the bank robbery gone wrong.  There is more here, though, and this is what saves the movie from being just another dull action flick.  The relationship between Doc and his wife is very compelling, and developed interestingly as the movie progresses.The movie is well directed, and Steve McQueen is great as always.  Still, this isn't one of the best movies of the era, and cannot even really be considered a classic of the period.

357460,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6303111874,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[1, 1]","I was pleasantly surprised at how will this film stands-up. It's perhaps even more enjoyable today than it was back in 1972.  Next to recent action flicks, Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway is a positively refreshing breath of fresh air.  The 1994 re-make with Alec Baldwin and Kim Bassinger (directed by Roger Donaldson)has steamier sex and a little more action, but it lacks the suspense, authenticity, attention to detail and stylistic flair that Peckinpah brings to his film.This 1972 film at first seems almost leisurely paced. when you put it against recent slam-bang over the type action films. It's not, it's just not as hyped up or phony as most action films tend to be these days.  This is a neo-noir chase film.  It's about details and character.  You get a sense of place from the film, you feel like you are watching characters that have a basis in reality, not in film.  There are sleazy characters, but they are portrayed neither as brilliant geniuses, nor as psycho killers, but as villains who aren't too bright, and have a dogged determination to get their work done. . . hopefully having a little fun in the process.  The rather spare action sequences are set up with important details and there isn't an overabundance of pyrotechnics or of cartoonish exaggeration It's downright refreshing today to see a film like this.  I even appreciated Quincy Jones soundtrack which employs a wide variety of sounds, instruments and styles to help keep things interesting.Now this film has a  big-time movie STAR as its central character, not just any STAR though, but the quintessential anti-hero movie star.  The man who moved like a panther, and had a strong solid presence which never needed to be sold to us.  Few had Steve McQueen's intense macho charisma (it was Bogart re-invented) . McQueen didn't need to earn his charisma, he exuded it.  A few determined looks and you knew you were dealing with a guy who played things by his own rules.  Women were turned on by his sex appeal, most men wouldn't have minded being McQueen.  Never mind his private life, on-screen McQueen towered above all the Bronsons, and Eastwoods around him.  He was a better actor too.He was a good actor for Sam Peckinpah to work with.  They made two films together (Junior Bonner and The Getaway) and both are quite good.  Sam, like McQueen also did things his way. Peckinpah drove studio executives crazy, was a difficult person for anyone to deal with but had a unique genius vision of how films should be made and fought hard to be able to make them his way. For a while he won the battles against the studio executives and then ultimately he lost and drank too much and turned out a few less than stellar films.  His masterpiece is The Wild Bunch- and that film is so good on so many different levels it deserves to be right next to the finest masterpieces of film ever made.The Getaway isn't a masterpiece.  For one thing it's got a huge weight around it's neck.  That weight is named Ali McGraw.  Sure, during the filming of The Getaway, McQueen and McGraw became a huge ITEM which led to a torrid long lasting very mercurial relationship off-screen-but none of their real life heat is evident in the film.  Ali McGraw can not act.  She's not completely wooden, but she's never convincing in any scene where she is expected to emote.  Peckinpah picked her to be an ice princess, but she never convinces us she's very tough or particularly icy. The closest she comes is somewhat detached -- as in somewhat lost.Her part is not unique enough that the film needs her to be great actress, and so the film is not done in by her.  Indeed, there's too many good things about the film for that to happen.Walter Hill( who would later direct 48 hours, The Warriors, The Driver, Long Riders, etc) wrote an excellent adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel for Peckinpah to direct. Since not one of the principal characters in the film are good or decent people, we are dealing with a film about crooks.  Low life crooks, middle of the road crooks and rich crooks with political influence and power.  Peckinpah casts this world perfectly (with the exception of Ali McGraw).Most memorable is the garbage truck sequence late in the film.  My favorite is the scene with Slim Pickens.The Getaway is an excellent film despite it's McGraw flaw because of the way Peckinpah, Hill, and McQueen approach the material.  It's more character and detail based than action/chase  films usually are, but does deliver enough of what the people want to be thoroughly entertaining.",4,Still a Great Getaway,978566400,"01 4, 2001",2001,4539,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'will', 'film', 'stands-up', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'today', 'was', 'back', '1972', 'Next', 'recent', 'action', 'flicks', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'Getaway', 'positively', 'refreshing', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', '1994', 're-make', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'directed', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'steamier', 'sex', 'little', 'more', 'action', 'suspense', 'authenticity', 'attention', 'detail', 'stylistic', 'flair', 'Peckinpah', 'film.This', '1972', 'film', 'first', 'almost', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'when', 'put', 'recent', 'slam-bang', 'type', 'action', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'not', 'hyped', 'up', 'phony', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'tend', 'be', 'days', 'neo-noir', 'chase', 'film', 'details', 'character', 'get', 'sense', 'place', 'film', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'characters', 'have', 'basis', 'reality', 'not', 'film', 'are', 'sleazy', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'brilliant', 'geniuses', 'psycho', 'killers', 'villains', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'bright', 'have', 'dogged', 'determination', 'get', 'work', 'done', 'hopefully', 'having', 'little', 'fun', 'process', 'rather', 'spare', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'important', 'details', ""n't"", 'overabundance', 'pyrotechnics', 'cartoonish', 'exaggeration', 'downright', 'refreshing', 'today', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'appreciated', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'soundtrack', 'wide', 'variety', 'sounds', 'instruments', 'styles', 'help', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting.Now', 'film', 'big-time', 'movie', 'STAR', 'central', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'STAR', 'quintessential', 'anti-hero', 'movie', 'star', 'man', 'who', 'moved', 'panther', 'had', 'strong', 'solid', 'presence', 'never', 'needed', 'be', 'sold', 'Few', 'had', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'intense', 'macho', 'charisma', 'was', 'Bogart', 're-invented', 'McQueen', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'earn', 'charisma', 'exuded', 'few', 'determined', 'looks', 'knew', 'were', 'dealing', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'things', 'own', 'rules', 'Women', 'were', 'turned', 'sex', 'appeal', 'most', 'men', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'minded', 'being', 'McQueen', 'Never', 'private', 'life', 'on-screen', 'McQueen', 'towered', 'Bronsons', 'Eastwoods', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'too.He', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'work', 'made', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'Getaway', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Sam', 'McQueen', 'also', 'did', 'things', 'way', 'Peckinpah', 'drove', 'studio', 'executives', 'crazy', 'was', 'difficult', 'person', 'anyone', 'deal', 'had', 'unique', 'genius', 'vision', 'how', 'films', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'fought', 'hard', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'way', 'while', 'won', 'battles', 'studio', 'executives', 'then', 'ultimately', 'lost', 'drank', 'too', 'much', 'turned', 'out', 'few', 'less', 'stellar', 'films', 'masterpiece', 'Wild', 'Bunch-', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'be', 'right', 'next', 'finest', 'masterpieces', 'film', 'ever', 'made.The', 'Getaway', ""n't"", 'masterpiece', 'one', 'thing', 'got', 'huge', 'weight', 'neck', 'weight', 'named', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'Sure', 'filming', 'Getaway', 'McQueen', 'McGraw', 'became', 'huge', 'ITEM', 'led', 'torrid', 'long', 'lasting', 'very', 'mercurial', 'relationship', 'off-screen-but', 'none', 'real', 'life', 'heat', 'evident', 'film', 'Ali', 'McGraw', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'not', 'completely', 'wooden', 'never', 'convincing', 'scene', 'where', 'expected', 'emote', 'Peckinpah', 'picked', 'be', 'ice', 'princess', 'never', 'very', 'tough', 'particularly', 'icy', 'closest', 'somewhat', 'detached', 'somewhat', 'lost.Her', 'part', 'not', 'unique', 'enough', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'actress', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'done', 'Indeed', 'too', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'happen.Walter', 'Hill', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'direct', '48', 'hours', 'Warriors', 'Driver', 'Long', 'Riders', 'etc', 'wrote', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'novel', 'Peckinpah', 'direct', 'not', 'one', 'principal', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'good', 'decent', 'people', 'are', 'dealing', 'film', 'crooks', 'Low', 'life', 'crooks', 'middle', 'road', 'crooks', 'rich', 'crooks', 'political', 'influence', 'power', 'Peckinpah', 'casts', 'world', 'perfectly', 'exception', 'Ali', 'McGraw', '.Most', 'memorable', 'garbage', 'truck', 'sequence', 'late', 'film', 'favorite', 'scene', 'Slim', 'Pickens.The', 'Getaway', 'excellent', 'film', 'McGraw', 'flaw', 'way', 'Peckinpah', 'Hill', 'McQueen', 'approach', 'material', 'more', 'character', 'detail', 'based', 'action/chase', 'films', 'usually', 'are', 'deliver', 'enough', 'what', 'people', 'want', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining']",N/A

357462,A2RMQWK75EEN7R,6303111874,Constantreader,"[0, 9]","It is amazing how dull this movie is, considering the director and some of the actors. Unfortunately, the film is too dependent on Ali McGraw, who is so bad as to be almost unwatchable. There is no chemistry between her and McQueen (surprising, since they were having an affair at the time) and she seems to be sleepwalking through her scenes. McGraw's character has traded her body and the promise of her husband's cooperation in a bank heist, for his freedom from jail. The transaction takes a few seconds, and the terms are ambiguous at first, but are later made clear by verbal reference. There is no drama or emotional impact to it, so we are left in doubt as to what actually happened and whether the husband knew what was going on or not. The rest of the film is the actual robbery and getaway. The director, Sam Peckinpah, doesn't seem to have had his heart or much interest in this film. The pacing of the action, as well of his lack of emotional input, leaves the audience without any emotional connection to either the action or the characters.

357463,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303111874,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[42, 45]","Unpredictable, volatile, abrasive, and the only man Charlton Heston ever threaten on a set of a movie (Major Dundee)...I'm talking about `Bloody' Sam Peckinpah...love him or hate him, the man knew how to tell a story, one that could entertain not only the average film patron with loads of action and violence, but also the haughty, oft-times snobby film critics with his thoughtful and insightful characterizations...actually, I think these same, snobby critics actually got off secretly on being able to enjoy the more visceral elements of his films while still being able to tout them on a cerebral level...like a guilty pleasure without the guilt.  But that's not to say Peckinpah's films were always critically accepted...I know his film Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) took a beating, but I enjoyed the hell out of it, in all its glorious dirty, sweaty, dust-caked, fly-ridden seediness...based on a novel by Jim Thompson (The Grifters) and adapted for the screen by Walter Hill (The Warriors, 48 Hrs.), The Getaway (1972) stars Steve McQueen (The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape), the man many believe to be the penultimate in machismo and cool, on and off the screen.  Co-starring with McQueen is the very beautiful Ali MacGraw (Love Story, Convoy), who became so enamored with her co-star she actually left her husband at the time, movie producer Robert Evans, to be with McQueen, and thus gave up the opportunity to star in several high profile films like Chinatown (1974) and The Great Gatsby (1974)...yes, the lure of the McQueen is a strong one...also appearing is Peckinpah favorite Ben Johnson (Major Dundee, The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner), quintessential heavy Al Lettieri (The Godfather, Mr Majestyk), Sally Struthers (Five Easy Pieces), whose most recent work include the tearful pleas to feed the starving children (which would probably be a lot more effective if she wasn't so heavyset...there I said it),  Slim Pickens (Blazing Saddles), Richard Bright (The Godfather), `Rub a Dub' Dub Taylor (The Wild Bunch), Jack `Howard Sprague' Dodson (""The Andy Griffith Show""), and Bo 'Knows' Hopkins (The Wild Bunch, White Lightning).The film begins with scenes of a Texas prison, focusing on one inmate in particular, that of Carter 'Doc' McCoy (McQueen), who's in his fourth year a ten-year stretch for bank robbery.  After being denied parole, Doc agrees to cut a deal with a politically powerful and corrupt individual named Jack Beynon (Johnson), who just happens to also be a member of the parole board (that's convenient).  The deal involves, on being released from prison, that McCoy pull a bank job for Beynon, which he does, and while McCoy's meticulous planning nets the robbers a large amount of cash, things quickly fall apart as there's a couple of jokers in the deck (one of them being one of the men McCoy got saddled with by Beynon), and the double cross is in, but McCoy isn't going down without a struggle, and he's certainly not going back to the joint.  Now McCoy and his wife Carol (MacGraw) must make their way to El Paso with the money, avoiding capture by the authorities (by this time McCoy's face is plastered all over the news), Beynon's trigger-happy goons, and one of the aforementioned jokers, all in a effort to make it safely across the border into Mexico.While not my favorite Peckinpah film (I've always been partial to The Wild Bunch), The Getaway is still an excellent film with strong themes and just an all around entertaining story, assisted by superior cast.  One thing I've noticed about Peckinpah is his ability to relate important aspects of story through visual means, carefully crafted shots and sequences, and make it look easy.  A perfect example in this movie is the opening sequences with McQueen's character in prison.  We learn much about him, and feel a sense of the frustration and oppressive nature of his incarceration on his mental well-being to where desperation finally pushes him to the point of doing something he would normally wouldn't in that of working for Beynon.  Of course, this wouldn't have worked as well with out McQueen playing the role, as his presence is the strong point throughout the film.  I've heard some comment of MacGraw's acting abilities (or lack of), but I think this was just a case of having to share the screen with McQueen, and who could complete with that?  Not many...I think she did really well, avoiding some over dramatic pitfalls others would have succumbed to in the role...and then there's supporting cast and the sense they were truly hand picked for their roles, providing, complex, distinctive, and believable characters.  I've also heard complaints about how the story drags at certain points, and the action sequences uneven and too short, but I'd disagree.  I thought the strength was in the quiet moments before the storm, the pacing intentional, to allow for the audience to develop an understanding of the characters and see them not as two-dimensional constructs but living, breathing individuals willing to do what they have in order to get what they want...to me, the action sequences, while certainly a draw for me to this film, were a part of a much larger piece.  There were a couple of really interesting aspects about this movie for me, one being that while Peckinpah's trademark usage of slow motions shots during the violent sequences is present, it seemed a little toned down from some of his other films, but that wasn't a bad thing.  The 2nd aspect was the sort of upbeat ending, which was a real departure given that many of Peckinpah's films are permeated with fatalistic characters draw down inevitable paths of self-destruction.  Some scenes to watch for...Steve McQueen going to town with a shotgun...oh yeah, kiss that squad car good-bye (quite a few cars were killed in the making of this film)...Steve McQueen slugging Sally Struthers in the mouth...hey, you can't have a Peckinpah film without a little misogyny, and while I would never advocate the use of violence against a woman, I doubt there'd be few who wouldn't agree that her highly annoying (and fairly sleazy) character was somewhat deserving...all in all this is a great film (much better than the 1994 Kim Bassinger/Alec Baldwin remake, in my opinion), with an exceptional script, acting, and direction, one that entertained me throughout, and reaffirms my belief of the possibilities of the cinema when in the hands of people who know (or knew) what they're doing...The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (2.40:1), enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions, looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 1.0 audio comes through very well.  The `Deluxe Edition', which is the one I have, has a few extra features in that of a commentary track with producer Nick Redman, and Peckinpah biographers/historians Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons, and David Weddle.  Also included is an original theatrical trailer, along with a `virtual' audio commentary track with Sam Peckinpah, Steve McQueen, and Ali MacGraw that consists of 1972 audio interview material from the three, spliced together and played over the film.Cookieman108",5,"""Don't get any blood on me...I hate blood.""",1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,7134,"['Unpredictable', 'volatile', 'abrasive',

357467,A315K47GRB024C,6303111874,Daniel C. Markel,"[7, 8]","This review is for the 2005 Warner Brothers DVD.The movie opens in a Texas prison where Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is doing time for armed robbery. He is denied parole and has to come to terms that the only way to get out early is to bribe a prison board member, Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) by indulging him with sexual favors with McCoy's wife Carol (Ali McGraw).  The dirty deed is done and McCoy is then paroled, but Beynon coerces Doc into doing one major bank job with a collection of other crooks that Beynon has assembled.  This sets up a big heist with several twists and turns along the way for an action packed film.I've seen just about all of McQueen's movies and this is my favorite.  First, I like the opening scenes in a real Texas prison.  The guards and other prisoners aren't actors - they are the real deal.  This rest of the movie is shot in Texas also.  I don't recall seeing a single scene that appeared to be  made in a Hollywood backlot.  The plot of this movie is original.  It's more than just a bank robbery and car chases.  There are a series of interesting confrontations and slick double-crosses that add a lot of pizzazz to the film.  The street-smart character of Doc McCoy played by McQueen is what sets this apart from most action films.  His uncanny knack of figuring out what's going on and eluding his advisories is what makes it an extra special movie.  Ali McGraw is beautiful, but her acting is suspect at times.  Sally Struthers gives a wonderful performance as a ditzy, yet too sympathetic hostage.  Slim Pickens also does a stellar job as an older, but very spirited cowboy.As for the DVD, the widescreen color presentation is near pristine.  The stereo audio quality is excellent.

357468,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6303111874,Dave. K,"[7, 8]","THE GETAWAY***** Out of 5Release Date- December 13th, 1972Running Time- 122-MinutesRating- PGScreenplay- Walter Hill (Novel, Jim Thompson)Director- Sam PeckinpahStarring- Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri, Jack Dodson, Sally Struthers and Slim PickensReleased in 1972 The Getaway is a classic 70s crime/drama with some action mixed in and has three Hollywood legends. Writer Walter Hill best known for his cult classic The Warriors, director Sam Peckinpah and the King of Cool Steve McQueen; The Getaway has all the right talent and all of that talent is put on full display with no doubt a classic film.The Getaway actually holds up rather well and in some areas it is a bit dated more due to the fact this kind of film has become a staple in film and TV as well. The plot has Doc McCoy (McQueen) serving time in prison and is up for parole, but it's denied. Doc ends up being released when his wife Carol (MacGraw) sleeps Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson), but there's more to it than that. Doc also has to take part in a bank robbery, but of course things go wrong and Doc and Carol are now on the run.The screenplay by Walter Hill was based off a novel by Jim Thompson and since I've never read the novel I cannot comment on it. Hill though does a solid job with the script. The plot has a good structure and the characters while not the most developed are interesting and well written. The Getaway mixes crime/drama with some action and a little bit of comedy. The movie is rather serious, but there are some light moments, which work well. Walter Hill's script may not be one of the all time greats, but it works well and is very well written and interesting.Director Sam Peckinpah creates a masterpiece of a film with The Getaway; the biggest complaint by fans is that at times the movie can be a little boring and I would have agreed at first, but seeing it again I would now disagree. While The Getaway can be slightly slow in some spots, I always found it interesting and in the slower scenes it better establishes the main characters of Doc and Carol McCoy. Peckinpah also creates some nice suspense in spots like the bank heist and his action scenes are well staged and very exciting. The final act has a classic film shootout that has to be rated as one of the best.The Getaway is probably my favorite Steve McQueen movie and probably my favorite role as well. McQueen is one of the classic tough guys of cinema and we just don't have any actors like this anymore. McQueen was a great actor, but in movies like this is where he really shines. He doesn't show a whole lot of emotion, which is perfect since it wouldn't fit the character. McQueen has the no nonsense tough guy persona down to perfection and he has to rate in the very least the top 3 greatest Hollywood tough guys. Like I said Steve McQueen was perfect in movies like this. His no nonsense tough guy persona works great here as well in his other movies. And he also makes for one of the greatest action stars of all time. When Steve McQueen sadly passed away far too young in 1980 a big part of cinema died with him. The days of actors like McQueen are long gone.Ali MacGraw I feel gets a little too much heat from fans of the movie for her performance; while it may not go down as one of the greats I do think she handled her role well and gives a good performance. Al Lettieri is excellent as Rudy Butler who is on the hunt for Doc McCoy and Sally Struthers gives a fun performance, but in typical fashion she's also a tad bit annoying, which also leads to one of the greatest scenes when McCoy hauls off and whacks her right in the face. Slim Pickens appears in a small role and nearly steals the show.I love the chemistry between McQueen and Ali MacGraw; there is a little bit of trust issues between the two well more of Doc has some issues with trust, but their relationship is quite complex and interesting and it's these scenes that the power really comes from in The Getaway. And like I said MacGraw gets a little too much heat. She's acting upon side a legend in Steve McQueen. When working with such an amazing talent like Steve McQueen was it's not easy to keep up with him.What I love about The Getaway is the hero isn't the typical hero. Doc McCoy is a criminal and while he is likeable he also isn't really the nicest of people. Despite what he's done he is a good guy I suppose, but he's not the typical hero who always does the right thing. These days in cinema you'll be hard pressed to find characters like that. Steve McQueen delivers a brilliant performance like I said he's the no nonsense tough guy with no fear and does what he has to do to survive. There is a reason why McQueen is known as the King of Cool!The Getaway is a classic film and still holds up today and is just as brilliant as ever. This is a must see for McQueen fans and those who haven't seen any of his movies The Getaway is a great place to start.The Blu-ray release has drawn some mixed reviews. The extras are the same as the DVD and are actually kind of weak. The picture quality though is very solid, but don't expect the full Blu-ray look. The Getaway was released in 1972 and obviously won't look as good as newer releases. But the picture is solid and while I haven't seen the DVD I doubt the transfer is that much better to warrant replacing it, while there is some grain I was surprised at how good it looked. Like I said you won't get the full Blu-ray experience, but the transfer is strong. The sound quality is weak though and that's the biggest flaw for the BD. The aspect ratio is 2.35: 1 and not 1.85: 1 like listed on the back of the cover. Overall the BD release was good, but if you have the DVD there is no need for this. I got the movie for under $20 so I would recommend the Blu-ray for the right price if not you might be better off with the DVD.",5,There is a reason why Steve McQueen is called the King of

And McQueen and future wife Ali McGraw create combustion every time they're in a scene.

357474,AVCRD98TH48RN,6303111874,D. Knouse,"[5, 7]","What makes this movie work is the great chemistry between Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw.  Both are solid here, as is the direction from Sam Peckinpah.  The best scenes here are the action sequences.  The car chases are well-staged and edited sharply to maintain intensity, and the shoot-outs are classic Peckinpah, with slow-motion cuts edited with real-time gun-play and the blood splatters everywhere. Yes! My favorite Peckinpah film is still &quot;The Wild Bunch,&quot; where his style of filmmaking affected all action films that followed.  In &quot;The Getaway,&quot; for the most part, the story and plotting are good, except for a few scenes I just can't get around.  One is at the bank robbery when one of the robbers disarms the security guard and leaves the gun a couple of feet away from him laying on the floor.  You should be able to guess what happens there.  The second is why did Harold exit the movie like he did.  I won't give away the scene, but it made no sense other than to rid the plot of a superfluous character.  The third and final head-shaker is when the two lead characters are being sought by the police.  They stop at a drive-in for burgers and coffee even after they hear on the radio a description of their vehicle, and that the police are on the lookout for it.  The last criticism is that this film screams 1970s.  From the mutton-chops to the gritty texture of the movie there is little doubt as to what decade this came from.  However, the two lead actors carry the movie with excellent performances, and Sam Peckinpah's work here is among his best.  His style of filmmaking may have been emulated and improved upon over the course of the ensuing decades, but his original vision started the revolution.",4,"&quot;Punch it, baby!&quot;",1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,1739,"['What', 'movie', 'work', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'are', 'solid', 'here', 'direction', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'best', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'well-staged', 'edited', 'sharply', 'maintain', 'intensity', 'shoot-outs', 'are', 'classic', 'Peckinpah', 'slow-motion', 'cuts', 'edited', 'real-time', 'gun-play', 'blood', 'splatters', 'everywhere', 'Yes', 'favorite', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'still', 'quot', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'quot', 'where', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'affected', 'action', 'films', 'followed', 'quot', 'Getaway', 'quot', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'plotting', 'are', 'good', 'few', 'scenes', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'around', 'One', 'bank', 'robbery', 'when', 'one', 'robbers', 'disarms', 'security', 'guard', 'gun', 'couple', 'feet', 'away', 'laying', 'floor', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'what', 'there', 'second', 'why', 'did', 'Harold', 'exit', 'movie', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'scene', 'made', 'sense', 'other', 'rid', 'plot', 'superfluous', 'character', 'third', 'final', 'head-shaker', 'when', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'being', 'sought', 'police', 'stop', 'drive-in', 'burgers', 'coffee', 'even', 'hear', 'radio', 'description', 'vehicle', 'police', 'are', 'lookout', 'last', 'criticism', 'film', '1970s', 'mutton-chops', 'gritty', 'texture', 'movie', 'little', 'doubt', 'what', 'decade', 'came', 'However', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'carry', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'work', 'here', 'best', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'emulated', 'improved', 'course', 'ensuing', 'decades', 'original', 'vision', 'started', 'revolution']",N/A

Doc McCoy (McQueen) is a master thief cooling his heels in prison.  His wife (McGraw)  springs him by sleeping with the warden, but that's only half the price.  McCoy must also pull a bank robbery at the warden's request, and his  partners are a moron (Bo Hopkins) and a psycho (Al Letteri). Of course,  it's a set-up, and McCoy is not intended to come out alive.  Letteri, the  warden, and maybe even Doc's own wife are in on the plan to murder Doc and  split the money.  McCoy and wife take off for the Mexican border, with  Letteri hot in pursuit. This is classic Peckinpah.  In fact, Peckinpah is  the only director I've ever seen who does FULL justice to the gritty,  savage novels of Jim Thompson (THE GRIFTERS, KILLER INSIDE ME, and THIS  WORLD, THEN FIREWORKS are a few other Thompson adaptations).  Walter Hill's  script (Hill also wrote and directed the 1996 remake) is a masterpiece! Not  a lot of features on the DVD (I'd've LOVED a commentary by Walter Hill on  this one!), but the format really brings the beautiful cinematography to  life in a way lesser formats can't.

357477,A109WIE49N0GV,6303111874,DVD buff,"[7, 23]","Being a big fan of both Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, I recently got the DVD of &quot;The Getaway.&quot; I was largely disappointed in the film -- it looks and feels very dated. Visually, I suppose it was meant to seem innovative at the time, but it looks like a lot of the bad movie-making of the early '70s now. And the soundtrack by Quincy Jones is remarkably amateurish-sounding.My biggest complaint, however, is with the pacing of the film.

357479,A1U52BQJG7MILK,6303111874,Epops,"[5, 5]","This film has many layers.It is one of the best action movies ever made.  It is full of graphic beatings, intimidation, sexual sadism, shootings, fires and car crashes.  The Texas prison guards and police look real and mean business.  The criminals look and act like real criminals - seedy, ignorant, brutal, and callous.  When Beynon (whose name in pronounced ""Benyan"" throughout the movie) is found dead his brother orders his henchmen not to waste time burying the body, saying ""dump it down a dry well, if you can find one.""  McQueen handles the 12 gauge shotgun and .45 Government Model pistol adroitly as befits an ex-Marine and the shoot-outs are very believable.  The wounds look real, the dead people look dead.  In reality, two people could not survive such a series of violent encounters unscathed, but it's a movie, so they do.  Such is the magic of film that we believe it all happens just as we see it.It's a portrait of life in a certain time and place, Texas in the early 1970's.  The background scenes are very unselfconscious and natural - the accents, the heat, the mesquite, and barbecue, the open and friendly manner of Texans.  The extras seem to have been there all along, living their lives; the camera just happens to catch them as they respond to the whirlwind of violence that rolls into town with McQueen and MacGraw.It's the story of a strong sexual relationship between two very attractive people.  It is not surprising that Steve and Ali became sexually involved off the screen and eventually married.  The chemistry is obvious and clearly communicated, even though the standards of the time did not require the sexual explicitness that we have become accustomed to these days.It is an exceptionally well made film.  Every frame hold one's interest.  In fact, Peckinpah's mastery of the visual aspect of film is such that each PART of each frame holds one's interest.The plot is intriguing.  How is ""Doc"" going to get out of prison, and how is he going to rob the bank, and who is going to betray whom, and how?  And how are he and ""Carol"" going to finally get to Mexico?  Only the ending has a false ring.  ""Doc"" and ""Carol"" are ruthless criminals in spite of their good looks and classy clothes, but we prefer to think they are misunderstood lovers, and we want true love to win out in the end, so we accept this ending.  But as others have pointed out this is not how the book ended, and it is not consistent with the overall tone of the movie.""The Getaway"" is a powerful portrayal of the criminal mind as it acts out its ruthless greed and selfishness.  But two amoral people like ""Doc"" and ""Carol"" could in the end never have really trusted each other.  Thompson's story makes this clear, while Peckinpah's film muddies these waters in order to provide an acceptable ""Hollywood"" ending.This review is based on the VHS version.Update Oct. 20, 2007:I have just seen the DVD version for the first time.  Visually it is a significant improvement over the VHS version.  The music is more coherent, less sappy.  The critical commentary track provides some very interesting insights into the acting and Peckinpah's film technique.  The ""virtual"" commentary by Peckinpah, MacGraw, and McQueen reveals all three to be fairly inarticulate and lacking in insight - Ali gushes on and on about what a great actor McQueen is, when what she really means is how much in love with him she is.It's still a great film, even better on DVD.",5,"Love and betrayal, greed and violence.",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,3455,"['film', 'many', 'layers.It', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'full', 'graphic', 'beatings', 'intimidation', 'sexual', 'sadism', 'shootings', 'fires', 'car', 'crashes', 'Texas', 'prison', 'guards', 'police', 'look', 'real', 'mean', 'business', 'criminals', 'look', 'act', 'real', 'criminals', 'seedy', 'ignorant', 'brutal', 'callous', 'When', 'Beynon', 'name', 'pronounced', 'Benyan', 'movie', 'found', 'dead', 'brother', 'orders', 'henchmen', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'burying', 'body', 'saying', 'dump', 'down', 'dry', 'well', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'McQueen', '12', 'gauge', 'shotgun', '.45', 'Government', 'Model', 'pistol', 'adroitly', 'befits', 'ex-Marine', 'shoot-outs', 'are', 'very', 'believable', 'wounds', 'look', 'real', 'dead', 'people', 'look', 'dead', 'reality', 'two', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'survive', 'such', 'series', 'violent', 'encounters', 'unscathed', 'movie', 'do', 'Such', 'magic', 'film', 'believe', 'just', 'see', 'portrait', 'life', 'certain', 'time', 'place', 'Texas', 'early', '1970', 'background', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'unselfconscious', 'natural', 'accents', 'heat', 'mesquite', 'barbecue', 'open', 'friendly', 'manner', 'Texans', 'extras', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'lives', 'camera', 'just', 'catch', 'respond', 'whirlwind', 'violence', 'town', 'McQueen', 'MacGraw.It', 'story', 'strong', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'two', 'very', 'attractive', 'people', 'not', 'surprising', 'Steve', 'Ali', 'became', 'sexually', 'involved', 'off', 'screen', 'eventually', 'married', 'chemistry', 'obvious', 'clearly', 'communicated', 'even', 'standards', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'require', 'sexual', 'explicitness', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'days.It', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'frame', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'fact', 'Peckinpah', 'mastery', 'visual', 'aspect', 'film', 'such', 'PART', 'frame', 'one', 'interest.The', 'plot', 'intriguing', 'How', 'Doc', 'going', 'get', 'prison', 'how', 'going', 'rob', 'bank', 'who', 'going', 'betray', 'whom', 'how', 'how', 'are', 'Carol', 'going', 'finally', 'get', 'Mexico', 'Only', 'ending', 'false', 'ring', 'Doc', 'Carol', 'are', 'ruthless', 'criminals', 'spite', 'good', 'looks', 'classy', 'clothes', 'prefer', 'think', 'are', 'misunderstood', 'lovers', 'want', 'true', 'love', 'win', 'out', 'end', 'accept', 'ending', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'not', 'how', 'book', 'ended', 'not', 'consistent', 'overall', 'tone', 'movie', 'Getaway', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'criminal', 'mind', 'out', 'ruthless', 'greed', 'selfishness', 'two', 'amoral', 'people', 'Doc', 'Carol', 'could', 'end', 'never', 'have', 'really', 'trusted', 'other', 'Thompson', 'story', 'clear', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'muddies', 'waters', 'order', 'provide', 'acceptable', 'Hollywood', 'ending.This', 'review', 'based', 'VHS', 'version.Update', 'Oct.', '20', '2007', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'DVD', 'version', 'first', 'time', 'Visually', 'significant', 'improvement', 'VHS', 'version', 'music', 'more', 'coherent', 'less', 'sappy', 'critical', 'commentary', 'track', 'very', 'interesting', 'insights', 'acting', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'technique', 'virtual', 'commentary', 'Peckinpah', 'MacGraw', 'McQueen', 'reveals', 'three', 'be', 'fairly', 'inarticulate', 'lacking', 'insight', 'Ali', 'gushes', 'what', 'great', 'actor', 'McQueen', 'when', 'what', 'really', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'is.It', 'still', 'great', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'DVD']",N/A

The robbery, as initially pulled off by two associates (Al Lettieri, Bo Hopkins) goes fine...until an injured guard reaches for his pistol, and Hopkins has to shoot.This sets off a series of close calls for both McQueen and his wife (Ali MacGraw).  Hopkins is killed by Lettieri during their escape; and McQueen, realizing this (when Lettieri tells him, &quot;He (Hopkins) didn't make it.  Neither did you.&quot;), wounds Lettieri.  But after Johnson is killed by MacGraw, McQueen learns that the two were sleeping together, spawning a mutual lack of trust that goes for a good deal of the film.Johnson's henchmen and Lettieri are both after the pair; and this results in a stunning gun battle at the Laughlin Hotel (run by Peckinpah stalwart Dub Taylor) in El Paso.  After killing their foes, McQueen and MacGraw get an old-timer (Slim Pickens) to drive them across the border into Mexico.Peckinpah's assmebling of the action scenes is far superior than almost any of his imitators.  The explosions of bloody violence that were part-and-parcel of THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS are not in as great abundance here, but there is enough so that the 'PG' rating could be upped to 'PG-13'.  McQueen is as good as always, and I didn't have the same problem that a lot of others seem to have with MacGraw.  Quincy Jones also provides a good score (though that score was put in at McQueen's insistence [his company First Artists distributed the film] over the one done by Peckinpah favorite Jerry Fielding).A top-notch film, infinitely superior to the 1994 remake, THE GETAWAY was Peckinpah's most financially successful movie of all time; and the end result shows why.",5,He didn't make it.

Thats story idea behind this Peckinpah film. It moves along fairly slowly, until about halfway through when there is a chase scene inside a train. That was far and away the best part of the movie. Then the pace slows down again and continues that way pretty much until the end of the picture.Ali MacGraw is gorgeous but her acting is not. She doesn't show a moment of emotion in the whole film, and her line delivery is just plain bad. You would think that since she was actually in a real life relationship with McQueen at the time they would have some sort of on screen chemistry, but alas that is not the case.Steve McQueens acting, as you might expect is a little better but I think he was held back by the dialog. There isn't a lot of dialog, but when there is it isn't all that impressive or important.I found the sub-plot to be one of the most interesting parts of the movie. It involves a mans wife falling in love(?) with Rudy, the other criminal who is hunting down McQueen. Rudy forces a doctor and his wife to bandage up his shoulder and then forces them both to drive him to Texas. At first the wife seems to like Rudy but you think ""She is just trying to lull him into a false sense of security"" but then as the film goes on you see that is not the case. The fact that a woman falls in love with a bad bad man is nothing new, but to do so enthusiastically and almost defiantly in front of the man who loves you is just a horrible thing to do to someone and I found it to be the most poignant part of the entire film. I can't say as I blame the husband for his reaction.This isn't Peckinpahs best film. Apparently McQueen, who was a big star at the time, had a lot of sway over how the film was written, edited, and even scored; so maybe it isn't really Peckinpahs fault. Apparently he disowned the film after he saw the final cut. That may have been wise.My rating: 3 out of 5",3,Not Peckinpah's best,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,2003,"['Doc', 'McCoy', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'been', 'granted', 'parole', 'man', 'named', 'Beynon', 'condition', 'bank', 'Thats', 'story', 'idea', 'Peckinpah', 'film', 'along', 'fairly', 'slowly', 'halfway', 'when', 'chase', 'scene', 'train', 'was', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Then', 'pace', 'down', 'again', 'way', 'pretty', 'much', 'end', 'picture.Ali', 'MacGraw', 'gorgeous', 'acting', 'not', ""n't"", 'show', 'moment', 'emotion', 'whole', 'film', 'line', 'delivery', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'would', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'real', 'life', 'relationship', 'McQueen', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'sort', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'alas', 'not', 'case.Steve', 'McQueens', 'acting', 'might', 'expect', 'little', 'better', 'think', 'was', 'held', 'back', 'dialog', ""n't"", 'lot', 'dialog', 'when', ""n't"", 'impressive', 'important.I', 'found', 'sub-plot', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', 'mans', 'wife', 'falling', 'love', 'Rudy', 'other', 'criminal', 'who', 'hunting', 'down', 'McQueen', 'Rudy', 'doctor', 'wife', 'bandage', 'up', 'shoulder', 'then', 'forces', 'drive', 'Texas', 'first', 'wife', 'like', 'Rudy', 'think', 'just', 'trying', 'lull', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'then', 'film', 'see', 'not', 'case', 'fact', 'woman', 'love', 'bad', 'bad', 'man', 'nothing', 'new', 'do', 'so', 'enthusiastically', 'almost', 'defiantly', 'front', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'horrible', 'thing', 'do', 'someone', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'poignant', 'part', 'entire', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'blame', 'husband', 'reaction.This', ""n't"", 'Peckinpahs', 'best', 'film', 'Apparently', 'McQueen', 'who', 'was', 'big', 'star', 'time', 'had', 'lot', 'sway', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'edited', 'even', 'scored', 'so', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'really', 'Peckinpahs', 'fault', 'Apparently', 'disowned', 'film', 'saw', 'final', 'cut', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wise.My', 'rating', '3', '5']",N/A

This is big news in guysville: Hand us a Steve McQueen action flick in a trick new video format and life is very, very good.It's hard to watch the old DVDs after seeing the high-def, but as with most older films processed for HD, there are a few issues.These movies come from a dicey period for film stock, especially ""The Getaway,"" so they don't have the punch, pop and clarity of, say, older Technicolor titles like ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" Skin tones tend to be ruddy, contrasts are jacked up and some detail is lost to the darker bias. On ""The Getaway,"" the audio sounds over processed, like when the amp goes to 11 -- I almost prefer the DVD version's sonics. The HD ""Bullitt"" audio nails it, though -- warm, realistic voices, great environmental detail, big bangs.These are quibbles because an A-B comparison is no contest at all. The old DVDs look flat and lifeless compared with the HD-DVDs. And they were decent DVDs, special editions from just a year ago. (Both of these high-def discs port over the extras from the latest DVDs. ""Bullitt"" has an additional extra about editing for 1080p HD.

357487,A9I40WFF40R4,6303111874,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[0, 0]","This 1972 movie directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Steve McQueen as Doc McCoy and Ali MacGraw as his wife Carol deserves to be seen again and certainly is worth the viewer's time. Based on a novel by Jim Thompson ""The Getaway"" essentially is the tale of a recently-sprung convict who must perform a bank robbery to pay back a character named Beynon who has pulled strings to spring him. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong in this perfect robbery so we have this genre film that never slows up.The film, however, is also about a marriage, its ups and downs, what can go wrong, how a cuckolded husband handles his wife's infidelity. etc. Certainly the best thing in the movie is McQueen's usual understated performance. While he is not Marlon Brando, he doesn't have to be. A man of few words, he acts with both his face and body. Initially I thought Ali MacGraw (of ""Love Story"" fame) was going to be only mildly pretty with a great mane of hair, but she does rise to the occasion and is quite good as the wife who makes the sacrifice of adultery to get her husband out of jail. The scenes between this couple work and sometimes sizzle; the fact that they were having some kind of an affair off-screen during the filming of ""The Getaway"" probably didn't hurt either. (MacGraw left her husband Robert Evans and married McQueen soon after the completion of the movie.) Sally Struthers has a strange role (the Patricia Hurst syndrome?) as a women who is kidnapped, along with her husband, by one of McCoy's cohorts who double-crosses him and is left for dead by McCoy and his wife. It is never clear whether or not she is brainwashed by her captor although she appears to like her new position in life a lot more than her dire circumstances call for. Then there is the obligatory car chase scene, not as good as the one in ""Bullitt"" but exciting just the same.As we would expect from the director of ""Straw Dogs"" ""The Getaway"" has enough violence for the most bloodthirsty viewer. This is, after all, a film about a bank robbery. On the other hand, McCoy appears to be a decent man if only left alone, if you disregard his profession. He only kills when absolutely necessary.The opening scenes from the film that show the frustration and pent-up emotions of prisoners are extremely well done and probably had an influence years later on the makers of the extraordinary prison series ""Oz."" Finally, the ending of ""Getaway"" was something totally new for this kind of movie.The DVD edition has commentary by Peckinpah, McQueen and MacGraw that is worth watching.",5,Scenes From A Marriage,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,2567,"['1972', 'movie', 'directed', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'starring', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Doc', 'McCoy', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'wife', 'Carol', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'certainly', 'viewer', 'time', 'Based', 'novel', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'Getaway', 'essentially', 'tale', 'recently-sprung', 'convict', 'who', 'must', 'perform', 'bank', 'robbery', 'pay', 'back', 'character', 'named', 'Beynon', 'who', 'pulled', 'strings', 'spring', 'Everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'go', 'wrong', 'perfect', 'robbery', 'have', 'genre', 'film', 'never', 'up.The', 'film', 'however', 'also', 'marriage', 'ups', 'downs', 'what', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'how', 'cuckolded', 'husband', 'wife', 'infidelity', 'etc', 'Certainly', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'McQueen', 'usual', 'understated', 'performance', 'not', 'Marlon', 'Brando', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'face', 'body', 'Initially', 'thought', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'Love', 'Story', 'fame', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'only', 'mildly', 'pretty', 'great', 'mane', 'hair', 'rise', 'occasion', 'quite', 'good', 'wife', 'who', 'sacrifice', 'adultery', 'get', 'husband', 'jail', 'scenes', 'couple', 'work', 'sometimes', 'sizzle', 'fact', 'were', 'having', 'kind', 'affair', 'off-screen', 'filming', 'Getaway', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either', 'MacGraw', 'left', 'husband', 'Robert', 'Evans', 'married', 'McQueen', 'soon', 'completion', 'movie', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'strange', 'role', 'Patricia', 'Hurst', 'syndrome', 'women', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'husband', 'one', 'McCoy', 'cohorts', 'who', 'left', 'dead', 'McCoy', 'wife', 'never', 'clear', 'not', 'brainwashed', 'captor', 'like', 'new', 'position', 'life', 'lot', 'more', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'call', 'Then', 'obligatory', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'Bullitt', 'exciting', 'just', 'same.As', 'would', 'expect', 'director', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'Getaway', 'enough', 'violence', 'most', 'bloodthirsty', 'viewer', 'film', 'bank', 'robbery', 'other', 'hand', 'McCoy', 'be', 'decent', 'man', 'only', 'left', 'alone', 'disregard', 'profession', 'only', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'show', 'frustration', 'pent-up', 'emotions', 'prisoners', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'probably', 'had', 'influence', 'years', 'later', 'makers', 'extraordinary', 'prison', 'series', 'Oz', 'Finally', 'ending', 'Getaway', 'was', 'something', 'totally', 'new', 'kind', 'movie.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'commentary', 'Peckinpah', 'McQueen', 'MacGraw', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Luckily, one of Hollywood's biggest stars at the time, Steve Mcqueen, enjoyed working with Peckinpah. When Producer Robert Evans sent his new wife Ali Macgraw (who was also a huge star at the time) to work with McQueen, he had no idea that they would fall in lust and that it would be the end of his marriage. The Getaway garnered a lot of gossip and box-office. It was Peckinpah's most successful film.The film is just okay. There are some exciting twists in the plot and the usual slo-mo bloodspurting violence you expect in a Peckinpah film but overall, I grew antsy waiting for this to end. McQueen is at his usual tough guy best. Macgraw simply cannot act to save her life. She doesn't deliver a single one of her lines convincingly. She seems to know only one note - a snotty delivery that sounds like a bratty, spoiled girl rather than the tough woman accomplice to an experienced criminal. She ruins the picture. Considered one of the world's great beauties at the time, today she looks like she had too much of her nose clipped off during plastic surgery. At some angles, she looks odd. But it's her acting that sucks.If you love McQueen, crime films, and explosive action scenes, this will fill half an afternoon for you.

The perfect widescreen photography, quick editing (but not a blur, I should add) and dramatic use of slow-motion give the action in The Getaway an authentic edge. And all done on a low-budget too.Adapted from a Jim Thompson novel by Walter Hill (his macho characteristics are all in there), the story has newly-freed jailbird Carter McCoy forced into a bank robbery by crime boss Jack Benyon. He's also forced to work with rank amateur Frank and psychotic renegade Rudy. You can tell that this dost not bode well.Rudy goes haywire, killing everyone in sight but is soon put out of action by McCoy, who then legs it across country with his cheating wife (the lovely Ali McGraw) and a bag full of simoleons. Down, but not out, Rudy follows him, as well as several associates of the recently deceased Jack Benyon, not to mention loads of cops.The film is basically one action scene after the other but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than tough-guy entertainment. I find it bizarre that this film is rated PG in America and the exact same version is rated 18 in the UK. But the blood effects in the film are pretty damn fake so it does take it out of reality a little bit. Plus there are no (audible) F-words and the nudity is minimum and quick.I saw the 1994 remake first and while it's passable it's not really as rustic and straight-forward as this. It was quite a pointless film and virtually identical, shot-for-shot. Everything that The Getaway has to offer is done best in this one.

357493,A34FSS6DNL1UJ,6303111874,"""iriley1979""","[1, 3]","The Getaway is a slick, fast paced action film with, great acting, and a supurb script. Their is not a weak performance in the film despite the fact that many people seem to hate Ali Mcgraw. My theory is that these people are ugly losers who resent Mcgraw because she is more attractive than they can ever hope to be. She is not a great actress but she does a good job in this movie, her character is understated, quiet, but strong, forgiving and dependable. Without her Doc (McQueen's character) would not have survived or even gotten out of jail in ther first place. McQueen does a masterful job of portraying Doc, a smooth, cool, (sometimes ice cold) soft spoken tough guy. He may seem mild, but push his puttons once to often and you better start ducking because the bullets will be humming. Doc will shoot you dead without a second thought if he has to. His wife can shoot as well as drive and she too will kill if necessary. The music in this movie is great, especially the twanging music that starts whenever a violent confrontation occures. The story begins with Doc (McQueen) in prison. The monontanty of his days drive him crazy, he is made to tear up tree stumps all day long. Even though this film does not focus that much on it is clear how much prison sucks in the few short scenes in which Doc is imprisoned. He comes up for parole and is denied. Desperate to get out of prison he swallows his pride and sends his wife to Benion, the local political power broker/gangster/rancher/ all around rich scumbag. In order to get Doc out of jail Mcgraw (I forget her character's name) is forced to sleep with Benion. On top of that once Doc gets out Benion requires him to pull a bank heist for him. Benion already has the bank selected because he has inside information on when a lot of money will be coming in, his brother-in-law sits on the board of the bank, and Benion has already assembled a team for Doc to lead. The actor who plays Benion does a great job of being really sleazy in a political way, arrogant and condecining. Rudy and Frank are the names of the characters Benion has selected to work for Doc. Doc does not trust these people for good reason, the guy who plays Rudy played Solotzo in the Godfather and man is he GREAT!!! in this movie. He steals the show and in my opinion out performs McQueen. Dont get me wrong, McQeen gives a great performance but the guy who plays Rudy (Silversti?) is a menacing villian who exudes subtle threats throughout the film. He is also clever and funny but ruthless and viscious. Doc and his wife soon realize that they are surrounded by enemies, who they have no choice but to cooperate with now but who will likely betray them at the first oppurtunity. No one trusts each other on this job, Benion does not trust Doc and his wife and vice versa, Rudy does not trust anyone and no one in their right minds trusts Rudy. These people are all criminals but Doc and his wife are by far the most likeable and least scummy. This bizzare group of individuals are compelled by circumstance to cooperate but after the job is over, all bets are off!!! The job goes bad and betryal followes betryal, Doc discovers his wife's ""infiedility"" and is enraged even though he sent her to Benion and she only did what she had to get him out of prison. Doc and his wife end up with the money but with Rudy and Benion's boys on their trail. Not to mention the cops who have thrown out a state wide search for Doc, his wife, and everyone else involved with robbery gone wrong. It is now a race to the border with Doc and his wife playing the hare for the cops, Rudy, and Benion's thugs. Across the border lies freedom and the good life beyond the reach of the American authorities. However, Doc and his wife are starting to distrust each other, their relationship is falling apart, deterioting more and more the closer they get to actually escaping. The viewer really gets invested in Doc and his wife and roots for them to hold it together and trust each other. The viewer really wants to see them get away with the money, the villians in this film are delicioulsy sinister, watching them die is truly a pleasure and a relief. People die horribly in this movie, the violence is realistic without being overdone. Plenty of shooting and shoot outs with lots of death, car chases, narrow escapes, and constant tension. This movie is very metaphorical in the sense that viewers will really relate to Doc and his wife. Who does not want to get away from the dreary life of a wage slave, who does not feel that they only person they can trust is themselves, even though they badly want to trust their spouse, in this movie it is man and wife against the world. Who does not feel sometimes that they are surrounded by evil people intent on their destruction, and that the only solution is to destroy these other people first. Doc and his wife's odysessy to escape America and long arm of the law, not to mention their previous ""partners"" in crime represents a fantasy many people have of escaping the prison of their lives. The real problem is that they are starting not to trust each other, and if anything is going to get them killed its that. The suspense climaxes in a great shoot out in a sleazy border motel where all acounts are settleed once and for all and Doc and his wife found out wheater or not they can truly trust each other. This movie proves the old adage that the robbery is the easy part of the crime, the true test of a criminal is the Getaway.",4,"Doc and his wife have many  enemies, including each

357494,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,6303111874,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 1]","After watching several Steve McQueen films recently, I have become a dedicated man. McQueen was one of the best actors ever and it's sad we lost him at the young age of 50. We can only imagine what great film roles would have come his way. Unfortunately, THE GETAWAY is not one of McQueen's best films. He's great as always but THE GETAWAY disappoints on all levels.McQueen stars as Doc McCoy, a convicted thief serving a long jail sentence. He is denied parole but is somehow released thanks to a local politican. The story is rather murky and confusing as Doc is immediately expected to pull off a bank heist in payment for his release.THE GETAWAY was the film that brought Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen together on-screen and off-screen. Supposedly, their chemistry on-screen sizzles and I saw none of that. McGraw is rather a dry and cardboard actress. There is little emotion or enthusiasm in her voice or expressions. I just watched PAPILLON and Steve McQueen had a much better chemistry with Dustin Hoffman than he did with Ali McGraw in THE GETAWAY.Fans of TV's ALL IN THE FAMILY will get a different look at Sally Struthers as a sexy kidnap victim fascinated by and attracted to the man who has kidnapped her and her husband. She has more screen prescence than Ali McGraw.There is a lot of double-crossing in this film yet Doc McCoy somehow decides to stick the original plan even though nothing has gone as expected.In my book, any film starring Steve McQueen is worth the time.

357518,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6303111874,Marty Gillis,"[12, 12]","Written by Walter Hill, Directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Steve McQueen!  A winning combination if ever there was one!  With a supporting cast, including Ally MacGraw, Sally Struthers, Dub Taylor , Slim Pickens (in a great role) and Ben Johnson, this is one class A piece of classic entertainment !What else do you need to know to decide whether or not you want to purchase this movie on Blu Ray?How about some info on the transfer itself to help you out?A very large step up from previous home video releases , The Getaway (1972)  comes to Blu Ray in style. Easily one of the best 1970's Blu Ray transfers I have seen.  For the most part it is a solid 4 out of five stars all the way on image quality.  A few scenes are a bit soft looking, a couple of stock footage shots, notable a train going by, are grainy and lousy looking (a couple of seconds is all they last) and maybe 3 times there is a slightly fuzzy looking shot that lasts all of a few moments. Otherwise this transfer is sharp, clear and with vibrant Technicolor images and ""Normal"" color timing that lets everything look just as it should instead of today's ""Make everything look Teal tinted"" or worse.  The colors look ""right"" to me and that is a huge plus. Presented on a BD50 disc with a decent average bit rate and a VC-1 encode, The Getaway is shown in it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1 which helps complete the theatrical viewing experience.  (bars on top and bottom of your screen)Unfortunately the sound is presented in only Dolby Digital and not DTS HD Master Audio or Dolby Tru HD , but the MONO track remains faithful to the original and I never had a problem with it.  Most films were NOT mixed in stereo back then and I can only guess the original separate ""stems"" of this movie , the dialogue, effects, foley and music were just not available to remix into even a stereo track, let alone a 5.1 remix.  You won't miss what you have never heard to begin with and for a mono mix it is just fine.  It never once detracted from my enjoyment of the film and with today's modern surround amps and center channels I am quite sure it pretty much sounds just as good if not better than it did in the theater if your system is a mid priced or better set-up.A nice selection of Bonus Features (for those who are interested) round out this package.  They include two sets of commentary tracks , an isolated score track featuring music from the original composer Jerry Fielding (Quincy Jones did the score you hear in the released version) plus the bank robbery scene with the alternate score intact and a 30 minute documentary. Not bad at all.This film is a gold mine of entertainment for all Steve McQueen fans and action movie fans alike.  There is a very good reason Steve McQueen is still to this day referred to as ""The King of Cool"" and The Getaway goes a long way towards showing us why.

These different elements were all pretty much perfected with Steve Mcqueen. There are a lot of movies that have used a lot of these same techniques to a successful degree. However, what no action movie has matched since is the man himself. All of the successful ingredients of an action movie are here in this movie. But it is Steve Mcqueen, the realist, the quiet one who dominates with his persona. He is in total control and rules the screen with pure confidence. There is very little in the way of Hollywood type dialogue. In fact, the dialogue is very to the point. It is everday dialogue couched in an action film.This is what makes Mcqueen's movies so damn special. The action is in the Action. Everything is geared towards a life-like conflict, problems that you don't want to deal with, but have to.Mcqueen is the master of this realm of character. He is the reluctant hero who is good at a job, one he doesn't necessarily like. When mistakes are made, he cleans them up under pressure.I suppose, in a lot of ways, Mcqueen represents a certain way of dealing with modern problems, modern stresses.

Well, no accounting for tastes, is there?The Getaway is a gritty, realistic view of 'Doc' McCoy (Steve McQueen) as a professional bank robber. Released early from prison by virtue (or lack thereof) his wife, Carol (Ali McGraw), Doc immediately plans another hold up as part of the conditions of his release. During the course of events he meets several unsavory charactors who seem intent on his destruction. The highlight of the film is a shoot out in a southwestern hotel with machinegun toting gangsters and a vengeful Rudy (former bank job partner and all around not-nice guy). Steve is trying to make his getaway using a 12 guage as the door. The movie is directed by Sam Peckinpah -- need I say more?The movie is low key, as Steve tends to be, but packs a punch in its realism. This could actually happen, one thinks. Several small plots underlie the main one of a getaway into Mexico w/ the stolen money. Steve turns in a outstanding performance as the anti-hero and has you cheering each time he eludes his pursuers once again.Certainly a good evenings entertainment and well worth the investment if you collect movies (if you don't, just rent it from the local Blockbuster).

Neither of those things can improve upon the original stories and mainly the original performances we find with McQueen.  Indeed, both films benefit from not being excessive (okay -- maybe the shootout in Getaway) and concentrating on the interpersonal relationships.It's not so much that a newer version may not be enjoyable to some folks, but then I'd rather see what influenced them to try a remake.  As for the general make-up of Getaway, it is well done.  Lots of action, suspense in regards to the situations our anti-heros find themselves in, not to mention the finale -- will they get caught in the end?

357537,A27HB7WK96IQYA,6303111874,"Robert Bykowski ""Robert Bykowski""","[4, 6]","As an action flick, 'The Getaway' is just OK.  Some good shoot-'em-up sequences, some good car chase parts, and that innovative scene where McQueen and McGraw hide out in a trash compactor.  The part where McQueen slaps around McGraw after learning that she slept with the prison warden to get him out early supposedly really happened during filming, and you could tell McGraw's crying and shock is real because McQueen totally improvised the slapping.  The sexual tension and love/hate feelings between the two is very apparent throughout the film.But one thing fails to be mentioned in the other reviews I've read here.  I'm not trying to be politically correct by any means, but doesn't anyone find Sally Struthers' role in this movie totally offensive ?  I mean, here she is, married to a veterinarian, with both of them being forced to take in an on-the-lam hit man who is after McQueen and the bank money (Al Lettieri).  And what does she do ?  She washes him up, performs oral sex on him, jokes around with him while her husband is being forced to drive, has sex with him in bed in a hotel room while her husband is tied to a chair and forced to watch, and finally causes her husband to hang himself in the hotel room because of all of this.  Has anyone noticed that director Peckinpah, in almost all of his films, portrays most women as evil sluts ?  I mean, jeez...I've had some bad relationships but Peckinpah, he must have gotten totally burned more than once.In any case, the film itself has a pretty standard 'bank-robbery-with-husband-and-wife-on-the-lam-and-being-pursued' plot.  What keeps it interesting is Peckinpah's slow-motion violence sequences (although pretty tame here), great editing, and McQueen's always solid as a rock acting.  Good supporting work here too from Slim Pickens and Ben Johnson.  But the plot is somewhat predictable, McGraw is still stale as an actress, and Struthers...well, I've already explained that.  'The Getaway' is simply just an OK film.  Not Peckinpah's worst by any means, but certainly nothing great or noteworthy.",3,"OK Peckinpah/Mc Queen...not great, not bad, but Struthers' role is offensive",1228089600,"12 1, 2008",2008,2070,"['action', 'flick', 'Getaway', 'just', 'OK', 'good', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'sequences', 'good', 'car', 'chase', 'parts', 'innovative', 'scene', 'where', 'McQueen', 'McGraw', 'hide', 'out', 'trash', 'compactor', 'part', 'where', 'McQueen', 'McGraw', 'learning', 'slept', 'prison', 'warden', 'get', 'out', 'early', 'supposedly', 'really', 'happened', 'filming', 'could', 'tell', 'McGraw', 'crying', 'shock', 'real', 'McQueen', 'totally', 'improvised', 'slapping', 'sexual', 'tension', 'love/hate', 'feelings', 'two', 'very', 'apparent', 'film.But', 'one', 'thing', 'be', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'means', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'find', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'role', 'movie', 'totally', 'offensive', 'mean', 'here', 'married', 'veterinarian', 'being', 'forced', 'take', 'on-the-lam', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'McQueen', 'bank', 'money', 'Al', 'Lettieri', 'what', 'do', 'up', 'performs', 'oral', 'sex', 'jokes', 'husband', 'being', 'forced', 'drive', 'sex', 'bed', 'hotel', 'room', 'husband', 'tied', 'chair', 'forced', 'watch', 'finally', 'husband', 'hang', 'hotel', 'room', 'Has', 'anyone', 'noticed', 'director', 'Peckinpah', 'almost', 'films', 'most', 'women', 'evil', 'sluts', 'mean', 'jeez', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bad', 'relationships', 'Peckinpah', 'must', 'have', 'gotten', 'totally', 'burned', 'more', 'once.In', 'case', 'film', 'pretty', 'standard', ""'bank-robbery-with-husband-and-wife-on-the-lam-and-being-pursued"", 'plot', 'What', 'interesting', 'Peckinpah', 'slow-motion', 'violence', 'sequences', 'pretty', 'tame', 'here', 'great', 'editing', 'McQueen', 'always', 'solid', 'rock', 'acting', 'Good', 'supporting', 'work', 'here', 'too', 'Slim', 'Pickens', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'McGraw', 'still', 'stale', 'actress', 'Struthers', 'well', ""'ve"", 'already', 'explained', ""'The"", 'Getaway', 'simply', 'just', 'OK', 'film', 'Not', 'Peckinpah', 'worst', 'means', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'great', 'noteworthy']",N/A

(Off-screen, their love affair ruined her marriage to Robert Evans whose studio was involved with producing this film.) There are numerous nasty moments. Also, remarkably, several humorous and sometimes playful moments as when Doc joyously jumps into a lagoon. Members of the supporting cast are first-rate, notably Ben Johnson (Jack Benyon), Al Lettieri (Rudy), and Sally Struthers (Fran Clinton). Based on Jim Thompson's novel The Getaway, this film really doesn't follow any specific formula. (Peckinpah's films never do.) It evolves logically but casually from one situation to the next. However, there are unexpected developments and complications along the way, notably Rudy's kidnapping of a staid veterinarian and his sexually unfulfilled wife.  Credit Walter Hill for an especially literate screenplay as well as Lucien Ballardfor his contributions as cinematographer and Quincy Jones as composer of the music score.

It's a great prison film.  It's a great chase film.  It's a great love story.  It fires on all cylinders.  The depth and complexity of the story and the performances are peerless.  It's a sprawling tale over several days, with many important and complex characters, all of whom you feel you know with some depth.  Even the small roles are standouts, including Ben Johnson as the crooked sherriff, and Dub Taylor in what should have been a throwaway piece playing a hotel clerk.  The only weak spot for me over the years is Ali McGraw who, although beautiful and believable, seems to be playing it so minimalist that she becomes nearly transparent.  But that's a small nit to pick - her by-play with McQueen is spot on.  When I saw it for the first time the first thought that came into my mind was ""these kids really look and act MARRIED..."" which is a tough bit of business to play.  Their violent love for one another is the undercurrent here, their desire to simply be left alone, to make it in life, to get away from their problems.The artistry is in the details, in the small brush strokes - the way McQueen holds and uses his .45 automatic are perfect.  He is definitely more than just another actor handed a pistol and said ""Here, hold this...""  Slim Pickens has a tiny gem of a role at the end and in a few brief sentences we learn volumes about his sweet, sad life, and cheer his good fortune for running into our heroes.

I will say first that this version prior to the Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin version is way, way better.

The Baldwin/Basinger was a train wreck in comparison, and quite frankly if I was McQueen I would be quite offended, and or rolling in my grave.The raw edginess of this movie is so great and ahead of it's time, with that being said; I can not believe that anyone would ever attempt a remake. The character's are gritty, &#34;love to hate&#34; kind of thing; I mean they are all bad guys but ya' just can not help liking them.There are two things about this movie that is very irritating, 1.) The intro to the movie is a montage of McQueen getting along in prison, (that's not the issue), the issue is the press machines that are going on during the montage! Very irritating and I always find myself fast forwarding through this part of the intro. 2.) Sally Struthers screaming..., it's like a cat screeching.

The rest of the movie is great though.  MacGraw just looks lost, even intimidated by McQueen.  He carries this movie, helped by great performances by Al Lettieri, Sally Struthers (she was thin once!!!), and the one of kind Slim Pickens.

The spark between the two is genuine and authentic. Slim Pickens, who plays a minor role at the end of the movie, is a joy to watch.

Bank robber Doc McCoy is released from prison with the help of a crooked politician with one catch.  He must rob a bank and split what he takes with him.  The bank heist goes wrong when one of McCoy's partners shoots a bank guard.  Soon after, McCoy learns that his wife slept with the politician to get him out early from prison.  From here on in it is a mad dash for Mexico with all the stolen money while the politician's henchmen and the police are in hot pursuit as well as another one of McCoy's partners.  This is a very realistic movie that shows it like it is.  The short introduction in prison, the bank heist, the chase through Texas, and the final shootout in a seedy hotel all have a very gritty feel to them that adds the sense of realism in the film.  Also, the showdown in the hotel is very well put together.  What a surprise, Sam Peckinpah doing a good action scene.Steve McQueen stars as bank robber Doc McCoy and is very good. Like many of his movies, he doesn't have to act much, he just has to be cool, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Ali McGraw plays Doc's wife Carol.  Many people think she is a bad actress, but I don't think she is that bad in this role.  Ben Johnson stars as the crooked politician with alterior motives, and is his usual good self.  The Getaway also stars Al Lettieri as McCoy's partner in hot pursuit, Bo Hopkins, Sally Struthers, Peckinpah regular Dub Taylor, and in a small but very good role as a down on his luck cowboy, Slim Pickens.  The DVD offers widescreen and fullscreen presentation, a theatrical trailer, behind the scenes info, and Reel Recommendations.  The Getaway is a very good movie with an excellent cast and good storyline.  It is too bad McQueen and Peckinpah did not work together more often since The Getaway and Junior Bonner were such good films.  Fans of McQueen will enjoy this gritty action movie.

357562,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6303111874,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","One of the many things that gives 1972's The Getaway the edge over its now almost-forgotten remake is that, unlike Alec Baldwin, Steve McQueen doesn't act like a movie star - he is a movie star. From the days when cool was what you were, not what you wore or owned, the plot itself is nothing special: Steve McQueen's bank robber is sprung from jail to pull a job with wife Ali MacGraw and has to hightail it to Mexico with both the relentless double-crossing Al Lettieri and numerous Texas mobsters in hot pursuit. Like most chase thrillers, you've seen it before: it's what Peckinpah does with it that counts, and Peckinpah does plenty. Most of Peckinpah's usual trademarks can be found in the margins, from children's fascination with violence to the Hellfire and brimstone preacher whose radio sermon goes unheard, and the action scenes are superbly staged - especially the hotel shootout and the lovingly filmed shooting up of a police car - but just as importantly he keeps a clear focus on his characters. The film's emotional terrain is as harsh as the barren landscape the ensuing chase is set against, with the odds on McQueen and MacGraw's marriage making it just as touch-and-go as whether they will make it across the border in one piece, their road to possible marital redemption through ordeal mirrored with the fast-track to Hell that hostage couple Sally Struthers and Jack Dodson take chauffeuring Lettieri's perverse wounded animal on their trail.It's probably Sam Peckinpah's last truly successful film before self-indulgence, laziness and too much booze and drugs took their toll on his work. True, it's a purely commercial piece that has none of the personal passion that drove The Wild Bunch or The Ballad of Cable Hogue, but it's put together with a level of genuine artistry that's way above the norm for the genre: the editing of the first twenty minutes alone, with its freeze-frames and non-linear structure, is remarkably adventurous and successful. Both perfectly representing the state of mind and frustration and disorientation of McQueen's character in a way that is both complex and yet entirely accessible and transforming what could have been bog-standard exposition into something much more memorable, it's strikingly effective. Far more entertaning than it has any right to be.(On an incidental note, although Walter Hill claimed that little of his screenplay made it to the screen (the bleak ending of Jim Thompson's novel is replaced by a much sweeter and more optimistic one), it's interesting to note how much of the film he would rework in his own The Driver, from the destruction of a car in a key setpiece to the train sequence with a very (un)lucky bagman.)Warners' 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a good transfer, with a brief 'virtual commentary' by Peckinpah and the two stars drawn from radio interviews, a full-length commentary byPeckinpah biographers and the film's strikingly awful original theatrical trailer. The extras are carried over to the region-free Blu ray, which also includes a documentary on composer Jerry Fielding's relationship with Peckinpah, an isolated score track for his rejected score (sadly not mixed into the film proper, though the Blu Ray does include the bank robbery sequence with Fielding's score as an extra) and trailers for The Wild Bunch, The Ballad of Cable hogue, Ride the High Country and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.",5,Getting away with it,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3401,"['One', 'many', 'things', '1972', 'Getaway', 'edge', 'now', 'almost-forgotten', 'remake', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'Steve', 'McQueen', ""n't"", 'act', 'movie', 'star', 'movie', 'star', 'days', 'when', 'cool', 'was', 'what', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'wore', 'owned', 'plot', 'nothing', 'special', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'bank', 'robber', 'sprung', 'jail', 'pull', 'job', 'wife', 'Ali', 'MacGraw', 'hightail', 'Mexico', 'relentless', 'double-crossing', 'Al', 'Lettieri', 'numerous', 'Texas', 'mobsters', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'most', 'chase', 'thrillers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'Peckinpah', 'Peckinpah', 'plenty', 'Most', 'Peckinpah', 'usual', 'trademarks', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'margins', 'children', 'fascination', 'violence', 'Hellfire', 'brimstone', 'preacher', 'radio', 'sermon', 'unheard', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'superbly', 'staged', 'especially', 'hotel', 'shootout', 'lovingly', 'filmed', 'shooting', 'up', 'police', 'car', 'just', 'as', 'importantly', 'clear', 'focus', 'characters', 'film', 'emotional', 'terrain', 'as', 'harsh', 'barren', 'ensuing', 'chase', 'set', 'odds', 'McQueen', 'MacGraw', 'marriage', 'making', 'just', 'as', 'touch-and-go', 'will', 'make', 'border', 'one', 'piece', 'road', 'possible', 'marital', 'redemption', 'ordeal', 'mirrored', 'fast-track', 'Hell', 'hostage', 'couple', 'Sally', 'Struthers', 'Jack', 'Dodson', 'take', 'chauffeuring', 'Lettieri', 'perverse', 'wounded', 'animal', 'trail.It', 'probably', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'last', 'truly', 'successful', 'film', 'self-indulgence', 'laziness', 'too', 'much', 'booze', 'drugs', 'took', 'toll', 'work', 'purely', 'commercial', 'piece', 'none', 'personal', 'passion', 'drove', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Ballad', 'Cable', 'Hogue', 'put', 'together', 'level', 'genuine', 'artistry', 'way', 'norm', 'genre', 'editing', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'alone', 'freeze-frames', 'non-linear', 'structure', 'remarkably', 'adventurous', 'successful', 'perfectly', 'representing', 'state', 'mind', 'frustration', 'disorientation', 'McQueen', 'character', 'way', 'complex', 'yet', 'entirely', 'accessible', 'transforming', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bog-standard', 'exposition', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'memorable', 'strikingly', 'effective', 'Far', 'more', 'entertaning', 'right', 'be', 'incidental', 'note', 'Walter', 'Hill', 'claimed', 'little', 'screenplay', 'made', 'screen', 'bleak', 'ending', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'novel', 'replaced', 'much', 'sweeter', 'more', 'optimistic', 'one', 'interesting', 'note', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'would', 'rework', 'own', 'Driver', 'destruction', 'car', 'key', 'setpiece', 'train', 'sequence', 'very', 'un', 'lucky', 'bagman', 'Warners', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'DVD', 'good', 'transfer', 'brief', ""'virtual"", 'commentary', 'Peckinpah', 'two', 'stars', 'drawn', 'radio', 'interviews', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'byPeckinpah', 'biographers', 'film', 'strikingly', 'awful', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'extras', 'are', 'carried', 'region-free', 'Blu', 'ray', 'also', 'documentary', 'composer', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'relationship', 'Peckinpah', 'isolated', 'score', 'track', 'rejected', 'score', 'sadly', 'not', 'mixed', 'film', 'proper', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'include', 'bank', 'robbery', 'sequence', 'Fielding', 'score', 'extra', 'trailers', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Ballad', 'Cable', 'hogue', 'Ride', 'High', 'Country', 'Pat', 'Garrett', 'Billy', 'Kid']",N/A
357563,A3JEV3M4L5R2OL,6303111874,T. S. C.,"[3, 3]","I love this film, and I love Steve McQueen, especially when he is in all-action films like this. In some ways, there isn't a great deal of plot; con gets out of jail, gets the nod to rob a bank, everything goes awry, and they have to skedaddle as best they can with the loot, with all sorts of scary heavies on their trail.I've read reviews of this film (perhaps on Amazon UK) that sort-of slag the film off, saying it doesn't have any real plot, or that it is too simplistic, or whatever. Perhaps these reviewers are more intellectual than me, but to me this is the perfect all-action, American thriller, complete with heist, love-relationship which doesn't get in the way of the main themes of the movie, shady gangsters looking for the loot, and action all the way. Isn't this what we want of Steve McQueen and American heist movies of the early 1970's? I know I do. In other words, if this movie is the equivalent of a massive cheeseburger and large fries and coke on ice, so what? I love Ingmar Bergman and those arthouse intellectual movies a whole lot, but the Americans (and sometimes the French and Japanese) have had a great knack throughout cinematic history of making great action movies, that do work on more levels if you want them to, that excite and thrill, and keep you entertained for 2 hours or so; this is one of those movies!If you look at anything, anything certainly that is or has been successful, you can be critical of it, and perhaps also see that it works on many levels. Some books, films, pieces of music have this quality. Is 'The Getaway' critical of America in some way, is it attacking the premise of American capitalism, or the state of America in general? Or is it just a rollicking balls-to-the-wall all-action American movie? You decide, because I can't!Then you have Al Lettieri, who plays the murderous, scary and downright nasty and psychotic Rudy Butler, who is after our heroes for the money, and no doubt to kill them. Lettieri was an Italian-American actor whose most popular role was that of Virgil Sollozzo 'The Turk' in the Godfather movie. In 'The Getaway' his character was equally as menacing, but more scary and unpredictable. And he was a fine actor, in many heist movies and thrillers in America in the early 70's.I love this movie, it is a prime piece of Americana, and a wonderful and typical all-action movie of the early 70's.
