777215,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B0000D9PNP,barry,"[0, 0]","This film is a joy to watch.  A simple independant film that shows a little slice of life and be sure, that slice of life will move you in all ways.  This film is the second production as a result of the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon show Project Greenlight.The story is simple but the acting is impeccable and it develops a wallop emotionally.  The movie is totally carried by Shia LaBeouf.  He had done some work before this, but here, at 17 he shows the maturity and skill that his furthering career would only develop.  He is the sparkle that shines in this film.  LaBeouf plays Kelly, a somewhat unhappy teen from a somewhat unhappy family.  He escapes by participating in war reenactments.  It is here he meets the wealthy, preppie Bart.  They become best friends and his family an escape for the emotionally lost Kelly.  He also falls for Bart's sister played by Amy Smart.The story is well told and all the characters have depth.  They all experience some life changes through their experiences together but it is Kelly and Labeouf's portrayal that shows the most depth.  His innocence is very believable.  The drama is provided in some excellent moments by him but the biggest surprise is his comedic timimg.  All the comedic touches are provided by the shyness of Kelly.I highly recommend this slice of life coming of age film to all independant film lovers and also Shia LaBeouf fans.

777218,ANRWZEICI5ZY0,B0000D9PNP,"D. F. Curran ""dfcurran""","[1, 2]","First let me say I was disappointed in the show which was project Greenlight 1, but liked the movie by the winning writer/director Pete Jones, STOLEN SUMMER very much.  I would watch STOLEN SUMMER again.  The show, on the other hand, with what seemed to me phony senseless bickering between producers Jeff Balis and Chris Moore seemed to lack the insight into the movie making I would have liked.  Come on, Chris Moore fussing because Jeff and Pete postponed the lake swim because the water was too cold for the child stars, made Moore look like an idiot.  And made careful thinking about what you'll need to get the movie done seem bad.  I do want to point out that Jones went on to make other movies.Project Greenlight 2, was an inversion.  I loved the show, and found the movie, BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS lacking.Now I have made a feature film.  I made my feature KNAPTID for $6,000 and wrote about how in myHow to Make a Low-Budget Digital Movieshort. Even though I had some bad actors I thinkKnaptid--4 Days After The First Abductionis a better movie than BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS.  So my comments here are those of an experienced low-budget filmmaker.Project Greenlight 2 does give you some real insight into how a Hollywood film is made, and what all happens.  The way in which the parent company tried to change the movie after it went before a test audience is a lesson by itself for the would-be filmmaker. The casting problems which I experienced myself--though not with stars, struck home, and the list goes on.  What might really be of value to the independent filmmaker here is watching the problems develop.Greenlight 2 makes producers Balis and Moore look good, and the winning directors look like idiots, while the writer, Erica Beeney is treated sympathetically.  The question is: did the show treat Potelle and Rankin fairly or just make them look bad?  (One does wonder after watching the show if the winner had been the director candidate who said she would only make SHAKER HEIGHTS or the one who actually did the best job on his directorial sample, the one with the crazy person in the psych ward, whether the end product would have been better. )How bad are the directors? Here is an example.  We see them filming at a church.  They need the church for outside shots of Shia LaBeouf as Kelly at his best friend's sister's (Amy Smart) wedding.  So what do the directors do.  They spend way to much time filming LaBeouf  in a Limo talking to Smart in a scene they never get right, and then have to set up lights to fake daylight in a scene that has to be outdoors.  In the final movie there is a shot of LaBeouf riding away from the church before the daytime service starts, while cars on the street have their headlights on because it is actually dusk.  They only had the church for a day.  LaBeouf did okay,  but Smart never got the 'in limo scene' right.  We never get the idea that she is being confronted just before her wedding by a guy she may have made love to while on the outs with her fiance.  (Want to see the surprised bride done right watch THE GRADUATE.) The thing is there was no background in focus, so they could have shot the 'in the limo shot' anywhere after spending a little time directing Smart.When the movie making was beginning, I can't believe the directors didn't ask the casting director right up front 'who can we reasonably get? LaBeouf was a bad choice here for example. LaBeouf may be great in comedy, but he did not always deliver here.  Example, the bully.The bully picks on LaBeouf because LaBeouf harasses the bully's father who is a history teacher.  But the bully's demeanor and LaBeouf's is cartoonish.  The fact that the bully has motive to hate LaBeouf is important as LaBeouf later regrets the trick he pulls on the bully.  The interaction of the two characters comprise some of the worst, most wooden acting in the movie.  In fact, LaBeouf barely seems bothered by the bully, emotionally detached.Speaking of emotion to really show it in a movie you need close-ups.  This movie seems shot entirely in medium shots. In fact, one extreme close up is of a tiny doll held by LaBeouf's best friend's father.  The problem is instead of a real character the friend's father is a caricature.Directing the actors:  Didn't these people ever rehearse? Kathleen Quinlan does this scene that ends where her saying 'because' she loves her husband.  This is an emotional scene yet she doesn't seem real because she goes from smiling to serious without really being the character.Some of the problems could be placed on Beeney the writer.  But if you watch the show you'll see the directors tried to rewrite her.  And the studio heads redid the movie edit. So who is to blame for some of the movie's problems is up in the air, for example: Why LaBeouf hates his father is not revealed until the end of the movie.  Meanwhile we go through the movie finding his 'I hate you Dad' attitude unbelievable enough to make him unsympathetic.Here  the directors made mistakes, the writer may have, the studio heads obviously did, and so what was in Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's heads when they actually said the fiasco that was THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS was better than STOLEN SUMMER.(By the way: The directors and the writer here have not gone on as Pete Jones has. At the time of this writing the SHAKER directing gang has one movie of their own they are working on.  Beeney has no further credits.  Pete Jones seems to have done a few things.)This all makes for an educating show.  They show these guys making mistakes people can learn from.  So enjoy the show, endure the movie and learn.",5,"Green Light gives new insight into Hollywood makes movies, the movie? well....",1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,5634,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'was',

777219,A1TDFF5G1KYE8T,B0000D9PNP,"H. Guentert ""Christian Independent""","[1, 1]","Project Greenlight season two was very entertaining, unlike the movie that resulted from it.  I think it is a wonderful idea, and applaud Ben And Matt for sponsoring it. Bottom line, the problem with the project results may be the frustrating process.What I believe from watching the DVDs was that Project Greenlight and Miramax need to choose the director(s) and then let him/her/them have a large part in selecting the script.  The group selecting the script now, including Ben and Matt, either do not know how to choose a good script, or have too much politics involved in the process.  After watching the comments on the scripts, you still have no idea what they will ultimately pick.In my opinion, the ""Battle of Shaker Heights"" was a lame story, and had no hope of making a profit regardless of who directed it, because there was nothing novel about it on top of being a very contrived (unrealistic) plot.  The casting process also was a political process driven by Miramax which seemed to almost force actors on the directors, but even great actors cannot fix a story that is not very interesting, funny, or believable.If the directors were chosen and given a large input into the script selection process, this could be a huge step forward in the quality of the project. I felt it was unfair for the directors to have to produce a script that really had nothing new to offer other than a showcase for the actor Shia.It somewhat killed my desire to compete in Project Greenlight again, but the support by Chris Moore and others gives great insight to the difficulties and challenges in making a low budget movie even with the best crew and equipment.  I hope they have more financial success in the future and let the directors have more input into the script in the future.

I happened upon this movie and I'm glad I did.  To me it's only of minor importance how this movie was funded and made, because the end product matters most.  And the end product is much better than many would lead you to believe.  You just have to know what kind of movie watcher you are.  If you love independent films and don't mind slow and nuanced acting and a story with no cheap thrills, you can enjoy this.  If you like more traditional movie experiences, you might find this treatment a bit slow.Shia LaBoeuf shows why he is the ""next big thing"" of his generation in a very subtle and impressive portrayal of the main character.  As Kelly he's an extremely over-intelligent high school kid who channels his brain power into nerdy pursuits like World War II history and military memorablia. Elden Henson is Bart, his fast friend from the better-off side of town.  When he meets Bart's older sister Tabby, he develops a crush for a girl way out of his league, something every boy in high school is familiar with.All the while, he works at the supermarket with Sarah, played well by Shiri Appleby, who would have clearly been an easier target for him.  All of these relationships are a back drop to the frustration we see Kelly experience from his family life, with a father battling his demons and a mother fighting to hold it together.William Sadler and Ray Wise round out what really is an all star cast.  And even though the slow is made in a slow and deliberate way, the cast of this movie is really one of the treats.  They all perform exceptionally well, even in parts that are written sparsely.I think they definitely captured the angst of high school in a way that was honest and real.  These are not typical kids, but that makes it all the more easy to understand why a character like Kelly might not fit in and might act out.  Sure they could have fleshed this one out more, but I guess all those Damon and Affleck connections helped to cast this one well enough to more than make up for it.If you enjoy slow and introspective independent films, or are a fan of Shia LaBoeuf, you will find lots to like in this movie.Enjoy!",4,The Battle of Shaker Heights - For Lovers of Independent Film Making and Acting,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,2228,"['Battle', 'Shaker', 'HeightsI', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'said', 'happened', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'only', 'minor', 'importance', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'funded', 'made', 'end', 'product', 'matters', 'most', 'end', 'product', 'much', 'better', 'many', 'would', 'lead', 'believe', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'watcher', 'are', 'love', 'independent', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'slow', 'nuanced', 'acting', 'story', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'can', 'enjoy', 'like', 'more', 'traditional', 'movie', 'experiences', 'might', 'find', 'treatment', 'bit', 'slow.Shia', 'LaBoeuf', 'why', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'generation', 'very', 'subtle', 'impressive', 'portrayal', 'main', 'character', 'Kelly', 'extremely', 'over-intelligent', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'brain', 'power', 'nerdy', 'pursuits', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'history', 'military', 'memorablia', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'Bart', 'fast', 'friend', 'better-off', 'side', 'town', 'When', 'Bart', 'older', 'sister', 'Tabby', 'crush', 'girl', 'way', 'league', 'something', 'boy', 'high', 'school', 'familiar', 'while', 'supermarket', 'Sarah', 'played', 'well', 'Shiri', 'Appleby', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'clearly', 'been', 'easier', 'target', 'relationships', 'are', 'back', 'drop', 'frustration', 'see', 'Kelly', 'experience', 'family', 'life', 'father', 'battling', 'demons', 'mother', 'fighting', 'hold', 'together.William', 'Sadler', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'round', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'star', 'cast', 'even', 'slow', 'made', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'way', 'cast', 'movie', 'really', 'one', 'treats', 'perform', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'even', 'parts', 'are', 'written', 'sparsely.I', 'think', 'definitely', 'captured', 'angst', 'high', 'school', 'way', 'was', 'honest', 'real', 'are', 'not', 'typical', 'kids', 'more', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'character', 'Kelly', 'might', 'not', 'fit', 'might', 'act', 'out', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'fleshed', 'one', 'more', 'guess', 'Damon', 'Affleck', 'connections', 'helped', 'cast', 'one', 'well', 'enough', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'it.If', 'enjoy', 'slow', 'introspective', 'independent', 'films', 'are', 'fan', 'Shia', 'LaBoeuf', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'like', 'movie.Enjoy']",The Battle of Shaker Heights

But there's a much stronger, deeper movie in here somewhere. Unfortunately, that movie is somewhere on the Mirimax cutting room floor.This year's installment of &quot;Project Greenlight&quot; was really amusing. I liked all three of the winners - Kyle, Efram and Erica - and the movie seemed like it had potential to be a great one. But K &amp; E, who seemed to get unfairly villified as arrogant control freaks, were unprepared to get slammed against the Mirimax machine.They made mistakes. They weren't team players. But they have talent and an honest vision, and their movie really could have been great. Instead, we have this, a 75-minute lightweight job that touches on many subjects and characters, only to &quot;resolve&quot; them with two-sentence exchanges.Think of all the missed opportunities here. The parents. The fiance. The bully, who is fascinatingly literate and short of stature. Bart's parents. And, most importantly, Kelly himself. Shia's performance is deeply perceptive and natural, but this cut of the movie refuses to let us see the source of Kelly's anger and intelligence.

Getting a fly-on-the-wall perspective of the movie making process was fascinating. The show allowed a glimpse of the angst the writer experienced having her story re-written a few times to suit the directors' vision. Conflicts between the directors and the writer and producers as well as Mirimax execs made it seem the movie would not finish successfully.Sadly, the movie was only released in a limited number of cities and theaters, and probably wasn't the blockbuster hit originally hoped for.I believe the movie was a huge success in a couple of ways: great writing and super acting by Shia LeBeouf. Witty subtleties in the dialogue can be attributed to brilliant writing. I hope Erica, the writer (also listed in the credits as a bridesmaid), didn't have to compromise as much as it seems she did during the course of Project Greenlight.I think this was a breakthrough performance for Shia. He artfully and comically captured Kelly's (his character) intriguing mix of angst, passion, self-deprecating humor, knowledge and intellect. I was captivated by his passion, pitied him for being a bully target, and was mad at him for his resentment aimed at his freshly sober dad.The movie was lacking in plot and character development, especially the relationship between Kelly and his father. This, I believe, was due in great part to editing, and not the original story. Another area I felt the movie lacked was the crush Kelly had on his best friend's sister. It didn't seem particularly believable and more awkward than anything. Hooray that in the end Kelly chose his friend-coworker. That was a much more believable and endearing match.Though I wouldn't categorize the movie as Oscar-worthy, all in all, it was very sweet and cleanly pulled together. It held my attention and left me loving and empathizing with Kelly.",4,A SURPRISING SUCCESS,1075075200,"01 26, 2004",2004,1895,"['watched', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'when', 'Battle', 'Shaker', 'Heights', 'was', 'featured', 'Getting', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'perspective', 'movie', 'making', 'process', 'was', 'fascinating', 'show', 'allowed', 'glimpse', 'angst', 'writer', 'experienced', 'having', 'story', 're-written', 'few', 'times', 'suit', 'directors', 'vision', 'Conflicts', 'directors', 'writer', 'producers', 'as', 'well', 'Mirimax', 'execs', 'made', 'seem', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'finish', 'successfully.Sadly', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'released', 'limited', 'number', 'cities', 'theaters', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'originally', 'hoped', 'for.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'couple', 'ways', 'great', 'writing', 'super', 'acting', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'Witty', 'subtleties', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'hope', 'Erica', 'writer', 'also', 'listed', 'credits', 'bridesmaid', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'compromise', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'course', 'Project', 'Greenlight.I', 'think', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'performance', 'Shia', 'artfully', 'comically', 'captured', 'Kelly', 'character', 'intriguing', 'mix', 'angst', 'passion', 'self-deprecating', 'humor', 'knowledge', 'intellect', 'was', 'captivated', 'passion', 'pitied', 'being', 'bully', 'target', 'was', 'mad', 'resentment', 'aimed', 'freshly', 'sober', 'dad.The', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'relationship', 'Kelly', 'father', 'believe', 'was', 'due', 'great', 'part', 'editing', 'not', 'original', 'story', 'area', 'felt', 'movie', 'lacked', 'was', 'crush', 'Kelly', 'had', 'best', 'friend', 'sister', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'particularly', 'believable', 'more', 'awkward', 'anything', 'Hooray', 'end', 'Kelly', 'chose', 'friend-coworker', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'endearing', 'match.Though', 'would', ""n't"", 'categorize', 'movie', 'Oscar-worthy', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'cleanly', 'pulled', 'together', 'held', 'attention', 'left', 'loving', 'empathizing', 'Kelly']",The Battle of Shaker Heights

Rankin and Potelle submitted a short film of uncommon grace and humor and deserved to be given the chance to film this screenplay.  Chris Moore the producer (American Pie Movies) did everything he could to dilute the talents of Potelle and Rankin and unfortunately in the process did the same to Beeney's screenplay. ""They"" gave these artists the opportunity to make a studio film and then bit by bit stripped away and soiled their artistic visions by demanding changes with the threat of discharge if they didn't make them. Nasty Stuff, if you ask me.  I don't know whose movie is on view in the in theaters now, but it I were Rankin, Potelle and Beeney, I'd remove my name.Rankin and Potelle filmed a drama with comedy. After the first public screening the studio demanded a more comedic film. Unfortunately since they were on such a tight budget, there was very little comedic footage to tack on. And on and on. A real horror story that Moore and Miramax should be ashamed of.Right now, as is, TBOSH is a hodgepodge of scenes that are much of the time, incoherent. It is very obvious where comedy stuff was patched in to the detriment of the dramatic flow of the story. Shia LaBeouf comes off best but it is obvious his best scenes were left on the cutting room floor and poor William Sandler and Kathleen Quinlan's roles have been relegated to cameo status.Since those of us who watched The Project Greenlight episodes know that this released version of THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS is a sad, pallid, botched mess of a film, we long for what might have been if the powers that be had allowed their directors and artisans to do the work they were hired to do.",1,David and Goliath,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,1974,"['Fans', 'myself', 'HBO', 'PROJECT', 'GREENLIGHT', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'aware', 'making', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'SHAKER', 'HEIGHTS', 'battle', 'visions', 'wills.The', 'Project', 'competition', 'case', 'chose', 'Erica', 'Beeney', 'screenplay', 'directors', 'screenplay', 'Kyle', 'Rankin', 'Efram', 'Potelle', 'Rankin', 'Potelle', 'submitted', 'short', 'film', 'uncommon', 'grace', 'humor', 'deserved', 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Chris', 'Moore', 'producer', 'American', 'Pie', 'Movies', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'dilute', 'talents', 'Potelle', 'Rankin', 'unfortunately', 'process', 'did', 'same', 'Beeney', 'screenplay', 'gave', 'artists', 'opportunity', 'make', 'studio', 'film', 'then', 'bit', 'bit', 'stripped', 'away', 'soiled', 'artistic', 'visions', 'demanding', 'changes', 'threat', 'discharge', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Nasty', 'Stuff', 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'view', 'theaters', 'now', 'were', 'Rankin', 'Potelle', 'Beeney', ""'d"", 'remove', 'name.Rankin', 'Potelle', 'filmed', 'drama', 'comedy', 'first', 'public', 'screening', 'studio', 'demanded', 'more', 'comedic', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'such', 'tight', 'budget', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'comedic', 'footage', 'tack', 'real', 'horror', 'story', 'Moore', 'Miramax', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'of.Right', 'now', 'TBOSH', 'hodgepodge', 'scenes', 'are', 'much', 'time', 'incoherent', 'very', 'obvious', 'where', 'comedy', 'stuff', 'was', 'patched', 'detriment', 'dramatic', 'flow', 'story', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'off', 'best', 'obvious', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'poor', 'William', 'Sandler', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'relegated', 'cameo', 'status.Since', 'who', 'watched', 'Project', 'Greenlight', 'episodes', 'know', 'released', 'version', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'OF', 'SHAKER', 'HEIGHTS', 'sad', 'pallid', 'botched', 'mess', 'film', 'long', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'powers', 'be', 'had', 'allowed', 'directors', 'artisans', 'do', 'work', 'were', 'hired', 'do']",The Battle of Shaker Heights

(This may have something to do with something called Project Greenlight, as the box makes sure to tell us that this is ""the Project Greenlight movie!"", whatever that may be.) Me, I knew absolutely nothing about it other than that the words ""Shaker Heights"" are in the name. I wasn't even sure it was the Shaker Heights I was thinking of. So it's pretty fair to say I went into this with no expectations at all, and what I got was a small, but pleasant, surprise. (Oh, and yes, I did get the Shaker Heights I was expecting-- but since I live on the other side of town, I didn't actually recognize anything, assuming it was, in fact, filmed here.)Kelly Ernsweiler (Holes' Shia LaBoeuf) is seventeen, in high school, and a social misfit, only interacting with others in reenactments of World War II battles. After one of them, he meets Bart Bowland (Lords of Dogtown's Elden Henson), a kid from the other side of the tracks. The two immediately fall to ribbing one another about the differences in their stations, but they becomes fast friends.There is, of course, a love triangle. Kelly works with Sarah (Shiri Appleby, recently of Swimfan), a pixie-like waif who's obviously got the hots for him, but he's interested in Tabby (Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!'s Amy Smart), Bart's graduate-school-aged sister who's on the verge of getting married. There's also the big fight, though this one's got a minor twist; the other guy is defending his father, a history teacher who spends his days being corrected, argued with, and otherwise hampered in his profession by Kelly (who, as a World War II reenactor, knows a good deal more about the subject than most high-school kids).It's a coming-of-age tale that's somewhat idealized, sure, but knows when to come back to earth for a breath of fresh air. The acting is at least never less than tolerable, and contains two real star turns by two actors of whom we see far too little these days, Trespass' William Sadler and Twin Peaks' Ray Wise, as the two boys' fathers.A fun little movie; nothing groundbreaking, but a feel-good flick, in an odd kind of way.

777230,A2YM6JTQIBZ8YC,B0000D9PNP,"Rock Quarry ""rockq""","[8, 11]","Here's why:1)From the beginning, they set up the filmmakers to fail by allotting a comparitively meager budget and ridiculously short timeframe to produce a ""Hollywood"" feature. They go way over-budget by spending most of the dough on bloated production costs for a supposedly low-budget picture. It's a big enough crew to work on Braveheart. If they are going to have that kind of staff, they should increase the production costs so that the movie can compete with multi-million dollar blockbusters. Otherwise, get rid of half the staff, and spend more time and money working on the script.Watch the ""making of"" featurette on the Citizen Toxie bonus dvd. THAT'S low-budget filmaking. And Toxie is a movie that's watchable, too.2)The producers constantly bad-mouth their last Project Greenlight film, Stolen Summer. ""It's a REAL MOVIE this year,"" says Affleck.3)The directors show their dismay for allowing Chris Balis, the awful producer of the last project, to produce their movie. Cut to Balis wolfing down a bagel. Its obvious Chris Moore brought him on so he could have someone under his thumb. When Balis wisely suggests that there should be another editor on the movie other than the directors, to allow for a diffent point of view, Moore responds,""I see producing as supporting the directors' process, not subverting it!"". Balis is left impotent for the rest of the production. (Balis was right. The directors end up cutting the film and the movie is awful.).4)Moore blames everyone else for the faults of the movie, yet its his hands-off approach (read: he's never there), allowing the directors to do whatever they want, that in large part is what's responsible for the movie's failure. When he asks the writer on the set how she could allow the directors to run roughshod over her script, after giving her no power at all to prevent it, she rightly responds,""F-You, Dude!""5)The only time EXECUTIVE PRODUCER Ben Affleck arrives on the set, its with superstar girlfriend J-Lo. Not too disruptive to a production, is it? Reminds me of when Elizabeth Taylor would show up to Richard Burton's set with her whole entourage.6)We see Good ol' Matt Damon at the beginning of the series, when they choose the winners, and then at the end, when filming is finished. He doesn't even show up at the premeire, but cuts a ten second closing comment for the series from another location. However, he's wearing a Project Greenlight hat, so he must have been deeply involved. HAW!!

777231,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B0000D9PNP,Scott FS,"[0, 0]","I'm interested in what goes behind the scenes of a motion picture.  Turns out there is a lot more to the process than one might expect.Project Greenlight lasted a mere three seasons, the first two on HBO, the last on Bravo.  Only the first two seasons are available.  I enjoyed the first year with Pete Jones, so I ponied up the bucks for the second.The second season features a change from the first season.  This time, there were to be a writer whose script was chosen, and a different director to direct the film.  There was still a competition that narrowed down the list from the thousands of scripts submitted, and the hundreds of potential directors.The format was similar in the competition.  Each screenwriter and director had to make a pitch to a team of studio executives as well as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  Once the screenplay and the director was chosen, then the team had a short period of time to do pre-production.The main problem this year was casting.  The directors wanted certain actors/actresses, but Miramax (who was funding the film) had final say.  This caused a LOT of friction.  The final casting was not done until the film was underway (!).All-in-all, a superb entry in the short series.  I enjoyed it immensely, and felt it was as good as, or even a bit better than, the first season.Highly recommended if you have even a passing curiosity about the filmmaking process.  As Affleck and Damon comment, it's a lot harder than it looks.  And infused with a lot more drama, arguments and strife than you'd think.  Probably more so than some of the films that result!",5,Project Greenlight Rocks!,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,1595,"[""'m"", 'interested', 'what', 'scenes', 'motion', 'picture', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'process', 'one', 'might', 'expect.Project', 'Greenlight', 'lasted', 'mere', 'three', 'seasons', 'first', 'two', 'HBO', 'last', 'Bravo', 'Only', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'available', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'year', 'Pete', 'Jones', 'ponied', 'up', 'bucks', 'second.The', 'second', 'season', 'change', 'first', 'season', 'time', 'were', 'be', 'writer', 'script', 'was', 'chosen', 'different', 'director', 'direct', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'competition', 'narrowed', 'list', 'thousands', 'scripts', 'submitted', 'hundreds', 'potential', 'directors.The', 'format', 'was', 'similar', 'competition', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'had', 'make', 'pitch', 'team', 'studio', 'executives', 'as', 'well', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'screenplay', 'director', 'was', 'chosen', 'then', 'team', 'had', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'do', 'pre-production.The', 'main', 'problem', 'year', 'was', 'casting', 'directors', 'wanted', 'certain', 'actors/actresses', 'Miramax', 'who', 'was', 'funding', 'film', 'had', 'final', 'say', 'caused', 'LOT', 'friction', 'final', 'casting', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'film', 'was', 'underway', '.All-in-all', 'superb', 'entry', 'short', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'felt', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'bit', 'better', 'first', 'season.Highly', 'recommended', 'have', 'even', 'passing', 'curiosity', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'Affleck', 'Damon', 'comment', 'lot', 'harder', 'infused', 'lot', 'more', 'drama', 'arguments', 'strife', ""'d"", 'think', 'Probably', 'more', 'so', 'films', 'result']",The Battle of Shaker Heights
