Its just a bit of an annoyance rather than a convenience in my opinionNow that I got that out of the way onto the actual review...This DVD covers the first 24 episodes of the series so, for those that enjoyed ""The War of Austrian Succession"" like me, you'll be pleased to know that its on this disc along with the episode when my favorite Austrian aristocrat was forced to stay with Germany and trust me when I call that the beginning of the ""Austrian blackmail"" scenario :)Speaking of Austria his role is once again voiced by Mr. Chuck Huber and once again the ending for the first couple of episode of ""World Series"" is ""Marukaite Chikyuu"" (incidentally during this writing I'm listening to Austria's version).  It isn't until they get to about say episode 10 (maybe a little earlier) that they change over to the actual theme for ""World Series"" which is ""Hata futte parade!"" (and if that's misspelled I apologize) which I actually kind of like better.  It should be noted by the way that when they do the Marukaite Chikyuu they only did a few of the of the Axis and Allies before the changeover.  It kind of makes you wonder why, for the world series they didn't use some of the other countries versions but oh well.The inside of the DVD was interesting as it showed three of the Nordics and Sealand (obviously to tie in with one of the episodes) but the funny thing is the episode that this would be a reference to actually isn't on the disc so, unless you did a look for an episode guide you'd be clueless as to why that was even there.Maybe it was because a lot of the skits were on Youtube but a lot of the jokes lost their effect because you could find the eps on Youtube from the dub for free making them more tired than they should be...although Austria's reaction to seeing Germany in boxers was actually priceless!  I'm not gonna tell you WHY that happened but you have to watch the season to see the joke in full effect and trust me its worth it.So with all of this that I said why is it a 4 out of 5?  Not just because of Austria being involved but because there was some priceless comedy involving GermanyxItaly, the Chibi RomanoxSpain skits were drop dead funny and Austria's straight pwnage of Germany.  Have you figured out yet that Austria is my favorite character?If you are going to buy this season do yourself a favor and DON'T watch it on Youtube at all.  If you do you might tire of the jokes before you are meant to and that's just not AWESOME like it should be!Have a good night",4,Good but stay away from Youtube,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,2741,"['Alright', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'then', ""'ll"", 'get', 'actual', 'review', 'Funimation', 'crack', 'down', 'people', 'whom', 'post', 'clips', 'episodes', 'series', 'so', 'way', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'funny', 'parts', 'spoiled', 'users', 'just', 'bit', 'annoyance', 'rather', 'convenience', 'opinionNow', 'got', 'way', 'actual', 'review', 'DVD', 'first', '24', 'episodes', 'series', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'War', 'Austrian', 'Succession', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'know', 'disc', 'episode', 'when', 'favorite', 'Austrian', 'aristocrat', 'was', 'forced', 'stay', 'Germany', 'trust', 'when', 'call', 'beginning', 'Austrian', 'blackmail', 'scenario', 'Speaking', 'Austria', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'voiced', 'Mr.', 'Chuck', 'Huber', 'once', 'again', 'ending', 'first', 'couple', 'episode', 'World', 'Series', 'Marukaite', 'Chikyuu', 'incidentally', 'writing', ""'m"", 'listening', 'Austria', 'version', ""n't"", 'get', 'say', 'episode', '10', 'maybe', 'little', 'earlier', 'change', 'actual', 'theme', 'World', 'Series', 'Hata', 'futte', 'parade', 'misspelled', 'apologize', 'actually', 'kind', 'better', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'way', 'when', 'do', 'Marukaite', 'Chikyuu', 'only', 'did', 'few', 'Axis', 'Allies', 'changeover', 'kind', 'wonder', 'why', 'world', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'other', 'countries', 'versions', 'oh', 'well.The', 'inside', 'DVD', 'was', 'interesting', 'showed', 'three', 'Nordics', 'Sealand', 'obviously', 'tie', 'one', 'episodes', 'funny', 'thing', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'reference', 'actually', ""n't"", 'disc', 'so', 'did', 'look', 'episode', 'guide', ""'d"", 'be', 'clueless', 'why', 'was', 'even', 'there.Maybe', 'was', 'lot', 'skits', 'were', 'Youtube', 'lot', 'jokes', 'lost', 'effect', 'could', 'find', 'eps', 'Youtube', 'dub', 'free', 'making', 'more', 'tired', 'should', 'be', 'Austria', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'Germany', 'boxers', 'was', 'actually', 'priceless', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'tell', 'WHY', 'happened', 'have', 'watch', 'season', 'see', 'joke', 'full', 'effect', 'trust', 'worth', 'it.So', 'said', 'why', '4', '5', 'Not', 'just', 'Austria', 'being', 'involved', 'was', 'priceless', 'comedy', 'involving', 'GermanyxItaly', 'Chibi', 'RomanoxSpain', 'skits', 'were', 'drop', 'dead', 'funny', 'Austria', 'straight', 'pwnage', 'Germany', 'Have', 'figured', 'out', 'yet', 'Austria', 'favorite', 'character', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'season', 'do', 'favor', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'watch', 'Youtube', 'do', 'might', 'tire', 'jokes', 'are', 'meant', 'just', 'not', 'AWESOME', 'should', 'be', 'Have', 'good', 'night']",N/A

I also love those 'OMG, that can't be what they originally said' moments when you turn on the subtitles and reverse to see what the original dialog was. The English version is usually a lot funnier.But I ended up watching most of this season with the subtitles on.  There were moments in the show which were meant to be cute and sweet and emotional, but Funimation seems to feel a need to fill every single minute with off-color humor now, whether it's particularly funny or not.  Guys, there's such a thing as 'too much of a good thing.' Rein it in a little and let the spirit of the show come through.One other slight disappointment was, after Sealand being prominently mentioned on the back of the package and pictured inside, I expected a bit more of him. Thinking back, I can't actually remember his appearing at all (though that might be faulty memory, or maybe I dozed off and missed something.)Apart from that, this season is good fun as usual, with lots of old favorite characters, plus new countries appearing. My favorite part was when France decided to repair his economy by emulating Switzerland and forming a bank to launder foreign money.

1504368,A182VTJIIEVM37,B005W2BWIA,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","We had to wait a while for season 3 to come out in English and the dub doesn't disappoint. I would joke that the dub intentionally makes more innuendoes then necessary but I still find them hilarious.The season focuses on Germany, Spain and Prussia according to the cover but I think Japan, England and America get their fair amount of screen time as well. Ironically, despite being the main character, Italy is kind of pushed back in this season in favor of the characters mentioned above. Like season 2, season 3 jumps all over the timeline as well but this time it's more justified given the title of season 3 is World Series (and not Axis Power).  I would joke that this season has the ""most action"" in the series but that title still goes to the Hetalia Paint it White movie of having 8 minutes of action sequence. We see Hungary fight (or kick the Prussian armies ass) single handily and we also get an attempted battle by Spain vs. Turkey (doesn't go anywhere sadly but this side of Spain is cool).The main timelines are the 17th century, and the 12-15th (again I'm not sure what timeline Spain has a lot of power but it might be around the 17th century as well), and the modern era. There is only one serious episode if you consider that episode serious (you're no by how the music stops and how the colors get all dark and it's an America episode so...)I find this season more hilarious in the dub given how Spain curses a lot in Spanish (calling Austria a ""Puta"" is so OOC for him but funny given the situation). Again like I say with the other Hetalia season DVDs, pick it up because it's cheap and easy to get into and at this point, you should know who the characters are (my dad has at this point).",5,The Long Awaited Season 3 Doesn't Disappoint,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1712,"['had', 'wait', 'while', 'season', '3', 'come', 'out', 'English', 'dub', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'would', 'joke', 'dub', 'intentionally', 'more', 'innuendoes', 'then', 'necessary', 'still', 'find', 'hilarious.The', 'season', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'Prussia', 'according', 'cover', 'think', 'Japan', 'England', 'America', 'get', 'fair', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'well', 'Ironically', 'being', 'main', 'character', 'Italy', 'kind', 'pushed', 'back', 'season', 'favor', 'characters', 'mentioned', 'above', 'season', '2', 'season', '3', 'jumps', 'timeline', 'well', 'time', 'more', 'justified', 'given', 'title', 'season', '3', 'World', 'Series', 'not', 'Axis', 'Power', 'would', 'joke', 'season', 'most', 'action', 'series', 'title', 'still', 'Hetalia', 'Paint', 'White', 'movie', 'having', '8', 'minutes', 'action', 'sequence', 'see', 'Hungary', 'fight', 'kick', 'Prussian', 'armies', 'ass', 'single', 'handily', 'also', 'get', 'attempted', 'battle', 'Spain', 'vs.', 'Turkey', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'sadly', 'side', 'Spain', 'cool', '.The', 'main', 'timelines', 'are', '17th', 'century', '12-15th', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'timeline', 'Spain', 'lot', 'power', 'might', 'be', '17th', 'century', 'as', 'well', 'modern', 'era', 'only', 'one', 'serious', 'episode', 'consider', 'episode', 'serious', ""'re"", 'how', 'music', 'stops', 'how', 'colors', 'get', 'dark', 'America', 'episode', 'so', 'find', 'season', 'more', 'hilarious', 'dub', 'given', 'how', 'Spain', 'lot', 'Spanish', 'calling', 'Austria', 'Puta', 'so', 'OOC', 'funny', 'given', 'situation', 'Again', 'say', 'other', 'Hetalia', 'season', 'DVDs', 'pick', 'up', 'cheap', 'easy', 'get', 'point', 'should', 'know', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'dad', 'point']",N/A

It's called internet, idiots.Anyway, World series will be my favorite because the cast brought in Spain, Hong Kong(can't wait to hear his voice) more Prussia, the Nordics (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland), more Prussia, and more awesomeness to the Hetalia world.
