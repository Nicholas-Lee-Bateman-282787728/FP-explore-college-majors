902850,A1N10ZN3IQUA6E,B0009A409S,"Allen Berry ""Emerald Archer""","[1, 1]","This is not the glitz and glimmer of Iron Man, The Avengers, or other recent Marvel tales. It's a much grittier smaller version of the Marvel Universe, a dark musty swampland somewhere on the forgotten fringes of a world inhabited by super powered heroes and villains. It is a place where man's conspicuous consumption is comes into conflict with the natural world... and the natural world is having NONE of it.Don't get me wrong, this is a B-Movie. The plot is thin in places, the effects are more Ray Harryhausen than Industrial Light and Magic, but it's still well worth watching. Man-Thing, though largely a secondary character in what is essentially a horror movie reveal, keeps to the shadows mostly--hinted at and glimpsed rather than seen--is fairly impressive. The scenes where it does appear are pretty good. The performances by the lead characters are watchable, more than that, really.Don't expect the sort of catharsis that more recent films boast, nor the glitzy sheen of Avengers, the message is largely environmental, but not preachy.This is a good bet for the Marvel Movie buff or for the B-Horror Movie fan. Me personally?  I bought it out of A) curiosity, and B) to add to my Super hero movie collection.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film.",4,Marvel's Strangest Hero Gets Big Screen debut... or maybe small screen... or straight to DVD... I dunno.

902852,AE8LL9S715YTE,B0009A409S,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[2, 2]","I have to say I liked the movie.  There was mystery and horror, there was character growth and (of course) character death.  The movie goes down and dirty quickly, everything is not as it seems.  As the Man-Thing begins to further his attack upon those who pollute and desecrate the lands, the main character has to fight his own fears and his own trepidations to overcome the obstacles in his way.  The main characters have a mystique about them.  You know who they are, you know what they are-for good or ill-and you understand what they do and why they do things.  And though as many will point out the origin of the Man-Thing is different than what Marvel had produced in the comics of the past, still, the heart of the beast was intact.  Also, yes this is a direct to DVD movie, I think the special effects and the tight storyline gives it a high rewatch value (at least for me).  I've seen a lot of really, really bad made for DVD movies in the past and have seen how they work and react in both storyline and special effects, and this one surpasses them all.

902854,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B0009A409S,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[2, 3]","First off, 'Man-Thing' is about the worst possible title for a film ever.  It sounds like it should be a movie about a sexually confused transvestite.  But its not.  Its actually about a new sheriff in a Louisianna bayou town investigating a series of brutal murders.  Throw in an evil oil magnate, some Indians pissed off about their tribal land being invaded, an angry swamp monster, and the requisite dumb blonde love interest and you basically get the gist of the plot.The first hour of 'Man-Thing'(god...I hate calling it that...worst title ever)is pretty good.  The cast, made up entirely of no-name actors, all put on good performances save for some ocassionally horrid Southern accents.  The new sheriff's investigation into the murders, their link to a large oil company and to some local Indians is interesting.  Its not a super-original story but engaging enough to keep you interested.  The special effects are great, especially the dead corpses, and the CGI is well done.But the movie falls apart during the last half-hour when the swamp monster is fully introduced.  The first two-thirds of the film was a well-put-together mystery but quickly unravels into an unremarkable B-movie.  Cliched dialogue, awkward kissing scenes, etc.  Its like the scriptwriter tried really hard at first and then was just like ""Screw it."" and just typed out anything to get the script finished.  Though the last third of the flick is bad, there are some extremely grizzly deaths shown and most of them are pretty sweetly executed.All in all, I think 'Man-Thing' could've been a much better flick.  I know it was based on some old Marvel comic, but once the monster was introduced the movie lost all its steam.  I personally think the film would've been better had the monster not owned the last third of the flick.  Had it never really been seen, but just more implied I think 'Man-Thing' would've been better off.  The film switches on a dime from an interesting murder/mystery to an average horror flick.I'd have to recommend this film for its fine first hour, its fabulous-looking dead bodies, and extremely grizzly deaths.

902855,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0009A409S,blackaciddevil,"[2, 2]","I'll admit, I'm quite surpised to see a Man-Thing movie from Lionsgate and Marvel. Don't get me wrong, I love the comic. Always have. It's just I wasn't expecting a Man-Thing movie so soon from Marvel.  I'm glad they decided to make this movie. I love Swamp movies. Why? Well, Swamps have always been a little creepy to me. The movie itself is about a new sheriff who comes to a small Louisiana town. Evil corporate people are drilling around the Louisiana Swamp Area for their own personal gain. The townsfolk don't like it and neither does Man-Thing who awakes from his slumber in the swamp. The body count rises as the sheriff tries figuring out who is doing the killing(to which he finds out in the end) and that is, basically, the gist of it.Take into account, though, that Man-Thing is by no means a bad movie even though the plot seems a little thin and you only get to see a good bit of Man-Thing during the last twenty or so minutes of the movie. It is actually pretty entertaining.However, there are some things that kinda miffed me about the movie. First off, they changed his powers in the movie. In the comics, he had the power to burn those who 'know fear' to being able to manipulate the swamp's vegetation(like DC's Swamp Thing). I didn't want to see a Swamp Thing movie--I wanted to see a Man-Thing movie. Second, they took a lot of liberties with the source material(again, making it more into a Swamp-Thing type movie) changing little things like Man-Things identity from a scientist to a shaman. Thirdly, if Marvel wanted to make a Man-Thing movie at all, why couldn't they have put a more suitable budget into it and have several of the title's writers come up with a good script??At any rate, the movie is good for what it is. A creepy Swamp movie. In that, it succeeds admirably. It is directed by Brett Leonard and stars: Matthew Le Nevez, Rachel Taylor, Jack Thompson, and Conan Stevens as The Man-Thing. Just don't expect it to be of the same calibur as Marvels other movies(like Spider-Man, X-Men, Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk). Maybe, at some other point, Marvel will decide to make a 'proper' movie for fans like me of the comic once they get their movie-making company rolling.",4,Man-Thing......,1223942400,"10 14, 2008",2008,2210,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surpised', 'see', 'Man-Thing', 'movie', 'Lionsgate', 'Marvel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'comic', 'Always', 'have', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Man-Thing', 'movie', 'so', 'soon', 'Marvel', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decided', 'make', 'movie', 'love', 'Swamp', 'movies', 'Why', 'Well', 'Swamps', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'creepy', 'movie', 'new', 'sheriff', 'who', 'small', 'Louisiana', 'town', 'Evil', 'corporate', 'people', 'are', 'drilling', 'Louisiana', 'Swamp', 'Area', 'own', 'personal', 'gain', 'townsfolk', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'neither', 'Man-Thing', 'who', 'slumber', 'swamp', 'body', 'count', 'sheriff', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'doing', 'killing', 'out', 'end', 'basically', 'gist', 'it.Take', 'account', 'though', 'Man-Thing', 'bad', 'movie', 'even', 'plot', 'little', 'thin', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'good', 'bit', 'Man-Thing', 'last', 'twenty', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining.However', 'are', 'things', 'kinda', 'miffed', 'movie', 'First', 'off', 'changed', 'powers', 'movie', 'comics', 'had', 'power', 'burn', 'who', ""'know"", 'fear', 'being', 'able', 'manipulate', 'swamp', 'vegetation', 'DC', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'Man-Thing', 'movie', 'Second', 'took', 'lot', 'liberties', 'source', 'material', 'again', 'making', 'more', 'Swamp-Thing', 'type', 'movie', 'changing', 'little', 'things', 'Man-Things', 'identity', 'scientist', 'shaman', 'Thirdly', 'Marvel', 'wanted', 'make', 'Man-Thing', 'movie', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'more', 'suitable', 'budget', 'have', 'several', 'title', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'script', 'rate', 'movie', 'good', 'what', 'creepy', 'Swamp', 'movie', 'admirably', 'directed', 'Brett', 'Leonard', 'stars', 'Matthew', 'Le', 'Nevez', 'Rachel', 'Taylor', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'Conan', 'Stevens', 'Man-Thing', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'same', 'calibur', 'Marvels', 'other', 'movies', 'Spider-Man', 'X-Men', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Maybe', 'other', 'point', 'Marvel', 'will', 'decide', 'make', ""'proper"", 'movie', 'fans', 'comic', 'once', 'get', 'movie-making', 'company', 'rolling']",Man-Thing

In terms of getting their own series, Swamp Thing came first beginning in 1972, while Man-Thing got his due sometime in 1974 (the Man-Thing series was short lived, lasting all of about 22 issues while the Swamp Thing series continues to thrive in one form or another).  Directed by Brett Leonard (The Lawnmower Man), who is currently working on a new Highlander movie, the film stars the relatively unknown Matthew Le Nevez (Peaches), along with newcomer Rachel Taylor and Jack Thompson (Original Sin).  Also appearing is Rawiri Paratene (Whale Rider), Patrick Thompson (The Seventh Floor), Steve Bastoni (The Matrix Reloaded), and Alex O'Lachlan (Oyster Farmer).  Also, look for the director himself who appears in the film as the smokes-a-lot county coroner.As the story begins we learn through narration of an area in the swamps called `the dark water', a place that basically contains the spirit of the swamp and is also the `nexus of all realities' (I think I got one of these in the basement, next to the furnace).  We also learn that this place, held sacred by native locals, is being violated by greedy men in search of oil, subsequently causing much damage, as industrialist are wont to do (or so the movies tell us)...but apparently the swamp isn't one to take this defilement lying down, so it strikes back, our first victims being a young couple canoodling in a boat, giving us a great bit of breastage within the first five minutes of the movie...enjoy it boyos, because that's all there is...I bet they didn't show that on the Sci-Fi Channel...anyhoo, next we meet our hero (of sorts) in Kyle Williams (Le Nevez) as he's recently relocated to the town of Bywater, assuming the position of sheriff and learns that a large number of people have since gone missing, including the last sheriff...he also meets the local bigwig oilman Frederic Schist (Thompson) and his idiot son, while dealing with some local protesters, one of them being 3rd grade teacher Teri Richards (Taylor), whom later on develops into a love interest for Kyle, but never gets nekkid, although she does show off her midriff quite a bit more than I would have expected from a school teacher...anyway, Schist claims a mysterious swamp dweller named LaRoque (Bastoni) is responsible for the missing people, and also for the recent spate of sabotage to his equipment, so Kyle begins his, ahem, `investigation', discovering Schist may have not gotten the rights to the land on the up and up, and his eco-destructive was may have awakened a guardian creature, one bent on retribution...let the soggy, boggy, slimy, bloodletting fun begin!Alright, Man-Thing wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it wasn't as good as it could have been, if that makes sense...the element that annoyed me the most was the how some aspects of the comic book character were preserved (like the `protector of the nexus of all realities' thing), while other, more important one, in my opinion, were deliberately left out (the whole `use what you see fit, and discard the rest' tactic).  In the comic, scientist Ted Sallis was working on some super formula, eventually taking it himself and running off into the swamp, where science and magic combined to create Man-Thing (there's a lot more to it than that, but that's the gist)...now this next part is important, as it creates a clear distinction between the Man-Thing and Swamp Thing...the Man-Thing `feels' emotions of other beings, and is often drawn to them out of curiosity.  Emotions like fear, hatred, and anger cause him pain, to which he produces a `fuming sulfuric acid' and attack that which causes him pain...thus his touch burns...this was completely left out of the story...and in the movie the creature kills indiscriminately...the film starts out pretty strong, but then drops off severely up until about the last twenty minutes or so.  Heck, we don't even get a good view of the Man-Thing until about an hour in...I did think the CGI creature effects looked pretty cool, but, as I already mentioned, without the burning touch element, this might as well have been a Swamp Thing movie.  The story itself hardly stands on its own as various lame duck characters parade across the screen (the pointless Mike Ploog character, who, by the way, was named after an artist on the comic book series) and the whole love subplot between Kyle (he's hot for teacher) and Teri was forced together for no other reason that they had to have a romantic aspect (by the way, did it seem like Teri's accent would come and go?)  There's a few decent kills featuring some greasy, racist, redneck, grit sucking, swamp rat locals, but these scenes were far and few between.  Thompson, who played the greedy industrialist Schist, made a pretty good villain (didn't his corporate logo look kinda like a swastika?)  Or at least I thought so until the scene where he and his son are sitting in their Hummer talking about the sheriff and how he's getting close to their secrets...Schist Jr. `He keeps on digging', to which Schist Sr. replies `We'll let him dig...it's his own grave he's digging!' followed by maniacal laughter from both...oh bruther...and I have to say Le Nevez's (who looks like a transvestite...nice job make-up department) character hardly seemed like much of a hero as his role consisted of him fumbling around witnessing things but having little effect on the outcome of the story...I got the impression it would have ended they way it did with or without him.  There were some pretty cool and interesting visuals, and the swamp sets looked suitably foreboding, although they seemed completely devoid of animal life like snakes, frogs, newts and other such denizens one would expect to see in the green, spongy morass.This Lion's Gate Entertainment DVD release features a widescreen (1.85:1) picture that looks very sharp and clean.  The audio, available in both 2.0 and 5.0 Dolby Digital comes though clear.  There are no special features, but included is some trailers for other Lion's Gate releases like Alone in the Dark (2005), Undead (2003), The Slaughterhouse Massacre (2005), The Punisher (2004), and

However, this Marvel comic adaptation took many of the elements of the comic and kind of stuffed them into a better-than-average horror flick.  This film is far from ground-breaking, but the effects look really good (considering that this was originally slated for a theatrical release before being relegated to the Sci Fi Channel and DVD), the acting is good for the most part (I, personally, hope to see more of Rachel Taylor), and the story is decent enough for 90 minutes.  If there are any major flaws with this movie, it's just that a)there isn't enough story and b)they don't really do enough to explain the background of the Man-Thing character, who was examined very carefully in the late-90s ""Strange Tales"" series by JM DeMatteis and Liam Sharpe.This movie gives me hope that Marvel will try out some of their other B- and C-list characters on film.

The land in question is important to the local Native Americans.  There is also a huge number of missing persons recently reported.  Are the two connected?Although this film bears the Marvel Comics logo, it bears little resemblance to the comics I used to read.  Despite that it makes for a pretty good film.

Native American legends, greed, dirty dealings and protestors all have to be dealt with to stop the trouble and killings in the swamp.  Check it out.I have to say that I rather liked this film.  Right at the start I decided to disassociate it from the comic.  As a film it works pretty well but as a comic adaptation it is pretty much a failure.  This was obvious with the opening scene of nudity and sex (although the original comic could be pretty racy at times).  Here the title creature is purely a force of nature with no human origin and its touch does not burn, fear or no fear.  It is sad to see Marvel gave approval for such a way-out adaptation.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[9, 10]","Okay, so it's more like three-and-a-half stars, but I was quite surprised at how good ""Man-Thing"" actually is.  There aren't any major stars in this direct-to-DVD film, but it garnered enough attention to be produced by Avi Arad and executive produced by Stan Lee.  That alone should show the viewer that this film is at least worthy of one viewing.Since I'm only remotely familiar with the ""Man-Thing"" comics, I have to go on what I've seen on the screen alone.  Matthew Le Nevez plays the newly appointed sheriff of a swampy Florida county who is literally dropped into a peculiar case involving multiple missing persons and a little construction site sabotage.  Ever since bigwig Schist has placed his oilrig in the middle of the sacred ""darkwater,"" people have gone missing.  When the new sheriff gets to the sleepy town of Bywater, the bodies start popping up in the swamp.  Le Nevez has a few leads to go on, but nothing for sure.  He is assisted by the local third grade teacher, played by the attractive Rachael Taylor, who believes that what she's been told by the local indian tribe is true.  She believes that a guardian spirit has been awakened due to the intrusion of the Schist oil company and is exacting his revenge on the locals.The film rolls along at a nice pace and actually has a few jittery moments in it that caught me off guard.  I really enjoyed watching the action in the dark swamp.  The action sequences are rather violent at points, and the ""leftovers"" from each death are pretty grisly.The acting is pretty good.  The story is just good enough that the actors don't have to stretch themselves too hard to fit into their roles.  The redneck characters are stereotypical of folks in the South, but they are tolerable enough.  Being a Southerner myself, I wasn't offended by the idiots on  the screen that Man-Thing makes quick work of.As for the actual Man-Thing, he looks really good on the screen.  The CGI creation holds up rather well considering that this flick's budget was nothing like other recent Marvel flicks like ""Hulk"" and ""Fantastic Four.""  In fact, ""Man-Thing"" is much better than ""Hulk"" as far as the story is concerned.  It recognizes its limits and isn't bloated into a two-plus hour film.My only gripe with this film is that the new sheriff adapted to his swampy surroundings way too quick.  Anyone with half a brain knows that people just don't haul off into a foreign swamp on their own and expect to get back in one piece.  There are people here in Louisiana who've spent their entire lives in the Atchafalaya swamp and they still don't know every inch of it.  Other than this small detail, this flick is well worth watching.I will personally buy this DVD.  I rented it since I missed its original airing on SciFi channel some time ago.

By doing so, I had a chance to see it and immediately realize why it was never released in theaters.  This made-in-Australia ""film"" is based (loosely) on a comic book produced by Marvel comics, the same people that brought us Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Blade, Hulk, etc.  Marvel has brought back ""Man-Thing"" several times since his introduction in the 70's, but all the stories that are stolen...uh, I mean BORROWED by this film are from the 70's run of comics written by Steve Gerber (who this horrible movie ""honors"" by naming a villain after him).Basically, the plot of this movie goes: Evil, obvious, redneck Nazis (their company's symbol is an oh-so-obvious Swastika) try to destroy the eco-system of a never-been-to-the-real-bayou, fantasy-land, I-was-obviously-born-in-Australia, version of the ""BAYOU.""

It's a fine line between ""spiritual"" and ""incapacitated"" with this guy's ""acting"") try to stop them. In the end they are ""helped"" (in that he tries to kill them) by...Man-Thing.  Hey, still awake?  Well, it gets better...The movie...er, I mean, ""movie,"" suffers greatly from the fact that someone decided to save a few sheckels and film the entire project in...AUSTRALIA, with an all-Australian cast trying oh-so-hard to speak with Southern-American accents.  I guess if you are like Avi Arad, one of the main producers of this movie, and grew up in the Mediterranean, everything other than Henry Kissinger's gorgeous brogue sounds the same to you.  Well, if you are reading this, you are probably an American and you WILL tell the difference.  See, this alone will make you feel smart; just by virtue of where YOU WERE BORN, you are more aware of the world around you than the people that were actually PAID MONEY to make this piece of junk.To me, the funniest part of this movie was its view of the Florida Everglades, the setting of the story in the comics.  Here's a simple I.Q. test the producers, writers and editors of this movie failed: the Florida Everglades are in which state?  Florida?  You are right!  The idiots mentioned above blend Cajuns from Lousiana, Voodoo from the Caribbean and Lousiana and lots of trite stereotypes into their green-lensed ""SWAMP."" This ""swamp"" looks like what it actually is: Australian mangroves filmed through a green lens put over the camera, with a few strands of Spanish moss tossed here and there.  Sad.  These punks should know better, and you punks watching should be insulted that THEY think they can fool you.This leads me to my main point: if the producers of this film wanted to portray the area of the world they ATTEMPTED to portray in this ""film"" they should have actually GONE THERE!  Get on a plane and go to the freaking Florida Everglades!  TALK to the people there!  Maybe even HIRE some of them!  Better yet, FILM THE MOVIE in the Everglades!  How much more money could it have cost?  Seriously!  If the people in the area you are portraying are as dumb as you portray them, why not go there, pay them in porno and beer and film their primeval nescience?  Instead, what we get with ""Man Thing"" is idiocy and ignorance given a level it doesn't deserve: actors struggling (and failing) to portray people that are (supposedly) beneath them in both social and mental status.  This lack of authenticity leads the audience to assume that the type of people ""Man-Thing"" seeks to portray as actual Southerners, no longer exist.  In other words, just because the writers and producers of this crap couldn't find the stereotypes they wanted in our United States, they went to another country and paid to create the monsters they knew existed.  Man, oh man, a Cultural Anthropologist could have a field day with this movie.Ugh.  Anyway, to sum up, ""Man-Thing"" is:1.) Boring2.) Predictable3.) Cheap looking4.) Poorly acted5.) Insulting to everyone that grew up south of Delaware6.) A waste of moneyIf you want a good ""Swamp Monster"" film, I would suggest:""SWAMP THING""  either #1 (Adrienne Barbeau) or #2 (with Heather Locklear!) or an old episode of the 70's TV show ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"" entitled ""The Spanish Moss Murders.""  Better yet, if you want to know more about ""Man-Thing,"" go to your local comic-shop and buy some old back-issues of ""Adventure into Fear"" and Manny's solo-title ""Man-Thing.""

If the characters well-known (Catwoman) then such changes will be met with scorn.  If the character is obscure (Man-Thing) then why bother paying the extra expense for the rights?  It doesn't make sense.Admittedly, Man-Thing is a very atypical hero.  He's a big plant monster, guardian of the Nexus of Realities, with no conscience mind, empathic abilities, and the ability to burn anything that ""knows fear"" with his touch.  He's a hard character to get hold of, and so the filmmakers decided to just throw away everything but the name and instead of trying something original, produced a Grade B horror flick.Instead of being the hero, this Man-Thing is a typical monster, stalking his swamp in search of victims.

However, it's not as utterly horrible as some perceived it to be, and while it's not a good movie one bit, it still manages to supply enough B-horror movie thrills.  Fans of the old Marvel Comics stories will be disappointed in finding that Hans Rodionoff's screenplay pretty much discards the comic history of the character, and instead focuses on new sherrif Kyle Williams (Matthew Le Nevez) and his encounters with an evil drilling company, and the beast which kills anything and everything that crosses into it's swamps.  The CGI and gore effects are what you would expect from a low budget horror film, though the Man-Thing itself is surprisingly nicely designed.  What kills Man-Thing however, is that the acting from the mostly unknown Austrailian cast is horrid, and directing by Brett Leonard (Lawnmower Man) is uninspired.

I remember reading it when I was a kid and sharing it with my friends. I was thrilled when Brett Leonard decided to create a movie about it. For those unfamiliar with the story of ""Man-Thing,"" an obnoxious oilman drills wells in a sacred Seminole swamp called ""Dark Water"" and awakens a supernatural creature. The creature, which is the swamp's spirit protector, seeks revenge for the violation of the sanctity of ""Dark Water"" and a string of unusual deaths follow.The new Sheriff has his hands full when he is faced with this investigation on his first day on the job. He and the other characters in the film seem to be superficial stereotypes of the parts they are playing: dishonest oil man, streetwise sheriff, smart and beautiful school teacher, good American Indian, renegade American Indian and an assortment of oddball bayou folks. The stereotypes are a disservice to the film because a little more depth of character would make the film more interesting. However, the photography and special effects are very good. I really like how the greens, reds and yellows bleed into the edges of the screen when transitioning from scene to scene - just like in the comic. Although most panned this flick, I found it entertaining despite the lack of character development. When ""Man-Thing"" makes his appearance, its hard not to watch.Anyway, I wouldn't describe this movie as an adult horror film. It's targeted more at a teen audience.

For one, this whole movie feels A LOT like 'Wendigo,' another film where the ""monster"" doesn't appear until the last possible second. So I couldn't even say, with a clear conscience, that the production team was trying to do as much as they could with what they had.Secondly, and most regrettably, it's also just good enough to keep itself out of the ""so bad it's entertaining"" catagory.  I always felt that (a lot of times) being forgettable is worse then being a catastrophy, and 'Man-Thing' is absolutely forgettable.Thankfully Lion's Gate Films decided to spare themselves the embarassment of a theatrical release and pop Man-Thing straight to the Sci-Fi channel.  It was absolutely the right decision, basic-cable is exactly where it belongs.There are worse ways to spend your time, but I didn't find this to have any entertainment value at all.

At first, I was actually enjoying it, wondering what the problem was with all the poor reviews.  It was kind of like watching a Saturday afternoon horror movie; suitably spooky, creepy background, cheesy blood, redneck atmosphere...and then it all went wrong.The potential was here for a decent horror movie, but the film falls flat halfway through.  The plot looses speed, the script becomes sporadic, the creepiness fades to commonness...and I kept wondering where all the leeches were.  If these people are passing out in swamps, shouldn't they be covered with leeches by now?The plot?  Bywater has a new sheriff, Kyle Williams, arriving smack in the middle of a feud between oilmen Frederic and Jake Schist and the local tree huggers.  Well, not really tree huggers, but protesters against the oilmen for taking away the Indians sacred land and drilling on it.Protester and third grade teacher Teri, an impossibly pretty girl in an inbred town, tried to tell Kyle about the problems with the oilrigs, but she is too coy and Kyle to vague at this point.The Schist's want to drill, and Indians Pete Horn and the elusive Rene Laroque want their land back.  Redneck brothers Wayne and Rodney Thibodeaux just want to make trouble.People start dying in horrible ways, and the coroner blames it on alligators, but Kyle knows something else is happening out in the swamps.  Kyle and deputy Eric Fraser go a'huntin, and the fun begins.  Will the Man Thing eat them all before they figure out they need to destroy the oilrig?This would be a great drinking movie, as long as you consume enough alcohol during the first half to not care as much about the second half.  Swamps are creepy, and oilrigs are creepy, and putting the two together should have been a no brainer.  I have not read the comic, so I can't compare the movie to it, but compared to the original, campy 1970's 'Swamp Thing' with Adrienne Barbeau, 'Man Thing' can't hold itself up on his cheesy, trunk-like legs.  Although, the human oil well near the end was pretty darn cool.Rent, don't buy.

902881,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B0009A409S,Sid the Elf,"[2, 3]","Already at film numero 24 in Sid's October HorrorGreatSuccess we decided to go with a little swamp monster action. The real inspiration for us was all the jokes we've made over the years thanks to the one cop on To Catch a Predator that dresses up like Swamp Thing. And if you know Sid, we never mess around when it comes to Chris Hansen. With all that going for it there really was no choice. Also being that it's one of those films on the sci-fi channel every couple weeks we were assured it would be very b, helping us keep our expectations in line.Man-Thing starts off with some slickster oil tycoons planning to do some drilling at a swamp in the town of Bywater. During this time Kyle Williams takes the town's sheriff job only to be harassed by the local rednecks, which were plentiful. All of a sudden some nasty murders begin showing signs that a local legend is alive. It's the Man-Thing, Swamp Thing's b cousin who just happens to be awesome. This creature actually looks really good, like to the point where if you saw it you'd wet yourself Santa style. Kyle has trouble believing the drunk hicks but wants to check things out for himself. And like any good sheriff he enlists the help of a cute young teacher to embark upon the swamp. They're the best team since Chuck Norris and Reno the Dog in the soon to be reviewed Top Dog.So for us Man-Thing proved to be mediocre but still enjoyable for sure. The story tends to drag a bit, like most movies, but really is saved thanks to the giant angry swamp creature. Every time it showed up on the screen it reeked havoc tearing up some of the locals in extreme fashion. It would inject it's tentacle like appendages into it's victim and then pretty much cook them til there eyes exploded. If I was there I'd be like, aw sweet. So if you happen to come across Man-Thing and have plenty of free time then relax, just do it.

I must say, when I rented this, I didn't have high hopes for it to begin with. I thought the cover artwork looked very cheesy. I was kind of sucked in by the fact it said Marvel on it, so curiosity killed the cat. I was trying to figure out why Marvel would have anything to do with a horror movie. Anyway, having low expectations may have helped me get more out of this movie than it was probably worth. I didn't think it was half bad, but don't get me wrong, it was what it was: a B-horror movie. The FX where way better than I anticipated. They used a lot of the new computer FX that you don't see in too many B-horror flicks. The gore was great!!! They had some nice props in this movie, better than your average B-horror (although, still noticeably fake). The atmosphere was absolutely amazing (and the best thing about the movie). The picture quality, dark swap scenery in the movie was absolutely gorgeous. However, the movie definitely has its bad points: Bad acting, stereotyping, and a million overdone horror clich&eacute;s  - It started to play out like a bad episode of the dukes of hazard meets ScoobyDoo. The redneck cops are just too reminiscent of ""JD HOG and Rosco"" It was a bit laughable. The native American's rolls in this movie couldn't have be more clich&eacute; if they tried. Its actually was to a point that it is almost makes a mockery of them. If a Native American watched this movie, they would probably either laugh, be mad, or be offended at how the Indians were portrayed.Anyway, my verdict: Some better than average B-horror movie gore FX with a dark atmosphere. probably worth a rental if your bored, just don't have your hopes set to high. After all, it's a killer tree we are talking about here. There is deffinitly no new territory covered in this movie.

(Indiandies, screaming revenge and curses for wrongful death and abusing nature.. Enter Man Thing.This movie was never released in theaters i hear it went straight to the Sci-Fi channel 1st(litterally), but let me tell you it has Marvel Quality all over it. Its not cheap the Actorsand story, the Look of the Man Thing are Very Credible. It was all done ""THE MARVEL WAY"" fromthe beggining from the pages of the comic book flipping as in Spider Man, Hulk, Or Daredevil,so was the same Quality of film with this release. It bears the Marvel stamp no Doubt.This movie does not have SCI-fI, Or Low Budget Written anywhere on it, ill repeat it was alldone the Marvel Way. Very Very Professional in casting Feel and look, even the storyline. OFcause you can only Evolve so much to run around the central Figure. But Hey. I like the film alot actually because it was not done in haste or low budget, i mean what can you expect from a""Hero/Being"" called the Man Thing in the first place. The tone was set great the Swamp wasreally great looking the trees where all Knotty, Man Thing really looked Great actually some ofthe CGI was all done keeping the Marvel name in the same breath as Greatness in that respect.The Movie no how matter how disjointed even the concept may seem. worked. It was never a rea-lly popular comic book compared to others that where brought to life. Go Figure. I am giving itthree stars. there is only so much you can do with the Man Thing, a swamp, some mysticism, acurious new sherrif a heroine and some antagonistic back-wood hicks.The only thing i dont get is who on earth would mention Man Thing as a viable investment orone of equity to earn profit from. Its Not! Even the comic book was canceled after the first year1974-1975 brought back 1979-1981 stopped and brought back in 1997 for a short series.

The only thing that got to me was some of the casting. Now I know a lot of no-name Australian Actors were cast for this movie and well... Aussies cant pull a Southern accent off for crap. It's not a major problem; 15 minutes into it and you don't really notice (in between all the tree branch impalings). But I have to say that Jack Thompson and the female lead are the worst offenders in this regard. The rest of the cast do a decent job.Oh, and I've read some reviews on certain sites that the Man-Thing monster is hardly shown. That's BS. The director takes the ""Jaws"" route at the start of the movie, showing very little of the monster but by the last half hour you get to see plenty of him. And for a low budget flick, the monster effects are pretty cool ... better than say, the effects in StarShip Troopers 2, another low-budget direct-to-DVD flick.Overall for a DVD rental or previously-viewed purchase, ""Man-Thing"" will do the job. It would have been a misfire to release this theatrically, but for a Sci-Fi channel/direct-to-DVD movie, this one is much much better than other similar releases.Worth a watch if you're into B movies or slasher/monster flicks with lots of gore. 3 out of 5 stars.",3,"Mediocre Marvel movie, but that's why it went straight-2-DVD",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2193,"['reviewers', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'claim', 'movie', 'horrible', 'Um', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'exactly', 'movie', 'called', 'Man-Thing', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'comic', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'things', 'did', 'Blade', 'character', 'movies', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'making', 'goofy', 'teen', 'comedy', 'someone', 'man', 'thing', 'ok', 'now', 'd*ck', 'joke', 'system', 'B', 'movie', 'pure', 'simple', 'slasher/monster', 'flick', 'when', 'view', 'just', 'not', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'masterpiece', 'then', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'good', 'cheap', 'scares', 'monster', 'tree', 'yes', 'said', '*tree*', 'butchering', 'people', 'Did', 'mention', 'lot', 'gore', 'plenty', 'violent', 'deaths', 'make', 'typical', 'Friday', '13th', 'fan', 'happy', 'Graphic', 'Tree', 'tentacle/root', 'impalings', 'are', 'order', 'day.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fine', 'story', 'job', 'sort', 'movie', 'probably', 'bloodiest', 'Marvel', 'movie', 'yet', 'kid', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'was', 'casting', 'Now', 'know', 'lot', 'no-name', 'Australian', 'Actors', 'were', 'cast', 'movie', 'well', 'Aussies', 'cant', 'pull', 'Southern', 'accent', 'crap', 'not', 'major', 'problem', '15', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'tree', 'branch', 'impalings', 'have', 'say', 'Jack', 'Thompson', 'female', 'lead', 'are', 'worst', 'offenders', 'regard', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'decent', 'job.Oh', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reviews', 'certain', 'sites', 'Man-Thing', 'monster', 'hardly', 'shown', 'BS', 'director', 'Jaws', 'route', 'start', 'movie', 'showing', 'very', 'little', 'monster', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'get', 'see', 'plenty', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'monster', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'better', 'say', 'effects', 'StarShip', 'Troopers', '2', 'low-budget', 'direct-to-DVD', 'flick.Overall', 'DVD', 'rental', 'previously-viewed', 'purchase', 'Man-Thing', 'will', 'do', 'job', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'misfire', 'release', 'theatrically', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel/direct-to-DVD', 'movie', 'one', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'similar', 'releases.Worth', 'watch', ""'re"", 'B', 'movies', 'slasher/monster', 'flicks', 'lots', 'gore', '3', '5', 'stars']",Man-Thing

While it's fun to laugh at pop idol and the like, and the losers that watch it, it's sometimes hard to write negative one star reviews on things you desperatly wanted to like.Take Man-Thing. Dunno if you've read any of The Curmudgeon's reviews before, but I'm a comic book movie collector; anything live-action related to superheroes or comics I'm there. Sometimes its a drag, buying stuff you know you'll hate (Catwoman, Popeye, Batman and Robin) but I really did have high hopes for this.Why?  Well, Man-Thing isn't exactly a well known comic book figure, so I reckoned the people responsible were creating a labour of love, a movie based on a character THEY love. How wrong I was. I doubt the idiots responsible for this mess even thumbed through a few pages of a Man-Thing comic.So, instead of Man-Thing, a tragic anti-hero who feeds on raw emotion (hate, anger, fear), we get a zero imagination monster movie where, for no reason at all, Man-Thing attacks teenagers and hicks in the swamps.The ONE thing they managed to get right was Man-Thing's original name - Ted Sallis. But they still mananged to screw that up. In the comic he was a scientist working on a follow up to the Super Soldier serum (that created Captain America, fact fans) when it all goes wrong - in this he's an Indian chief who, like, angered the Gods or something.Yup - an Indian Chief. Called Ted.What's really galling is there's so much potential here. The acting is half decent, the location of the swamps is fine and creepy, and Man-Thing doesn't look at all bad, and the film's an 18 certificate so there's no need to tone down the violence. If they had just got someone with a passion and knowledge of the comics,instead of some talentless hack who just wanted to make a pointless monster mash but with a Marvel name tacked on, they really could have had something special. Instead they've made a sub-par horror film, something to watch at 2am and laugh at.I'm going to go punch someone in the throat.The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk",1,A crying shame.,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,2071,"['Sigh', 'Sometimes', 'reviews', 'are', 'fun', 'write', 'fun', 'laugh', 'pop', 'idol', 'like', 'losers', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'write', 'negative', 'one', 'star', 'things', 'desperatly', 'wanted', 'like.Take', 'Man-Thing', 'Dunno', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Curmudgeon', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'collector', 'anything', 'live-action', 'related', 'superheroes', 'comics', ""'m"", 'there', 'drag', 'buying', 'stuff', 'know', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'Catwoman', 'Popeye', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'this.Why', 'Well', 'Man-Thing', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'well', 'known', 'comic', 'book', 'figure', 'reckoned', 'people', 'responsible', 'were', 'creating', 'labour', 'love', 'movie', 'based', 'character', 'THEY', 'love', 'How', 'wrong', 'was', 'doubt', 'idiots', 'responsible', 'mess', 'even', 'thumbed', 'few', 'pages', 'Man-Thing', 'comic.So', 'instead', 'Man-Thing', 'tragic', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'raw', 'emotion', 'hate', 'anger', 'fear', 'get', 'zero', 'imagination', 'monster', 'movie', 'where', 'reason', 'Man-Thing', 'attacks', 'teenagers', 'hicks', 'swamps.The', 'ONE', 'thing', 'managed', 'get', 'right', 'was', 'Man-Thing', 'original', 'name', 'Ted', 'Sallis', 'still', 'mananged', 'screw', 'up', 'comic', 'was', 'scientist', 'working', 'follow', 'up', 'Super', 'Soldier', 'serum', 'created', 'Captain', 'America', 'fact', 'fans', 'when', 'wrong', 'Indian', 'chief', 'who', 'angered', 'Gods', 'something.Yup', 'Indian', 'Chief', 'Called', 'Ted.What', 'really', 'galling', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'acting', 'half', 'decent', 'location', 'swamps', 'fine', 'creepy', 'Man-Thing', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'film', '18', 'certificate', 'need', 'tone', 'down', 'violence', 'had', 'just', 'got', 'someone', 'passion', 'knowledge', 'comics', 'instead', 'talentless', 'hack', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'pointless', 'monster', 'mash', 'Marvel', 'name', 'tacked', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'something', 'special', 'Instead', ""'ve"", 'made', 'sub-par', 'horror', 'film', 'something', 'watch', '2am', 'laugh', 'at.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'punch', 'someone', 'throat.The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You', '@', 'yahoo.co.uk']",Man-Thing

The tragedy of Ted Sallis becoming the title creature led to several stories that held a pathos that is sorely missing from this film. There was an opportunity to paint something much more majestic and terrifying. This felt like a throw-away.Man-Thing would often find itself immobile until stirred to respond to emotion, specifically fear. His reaction was to destroy the source of that fear so he'd often appear from the dark, unannounced burning his victim. Once in a long stretch, the creature would seem to feel an echo of its' former human self which had a truly heart tugging element that kept the stories afloat even during the most ridiculous mash-up.I don't mind a re-working of a character or plot and I wasn't expecting 'Citizen Kane', but this was disappointing right down to the CGI work.

902889,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0009A409S,Tim Janson,"[3, 4]","Manthing reminded me of Marvel from the 1970's and early 80's when they were so desperate to get their characters on TV and film that they didn't care how badly they came off.  Who can forget the horrible Captain America TV movies with Reb Brown, or the Dr. Strange TV movie with who?  Or how about the Hulk TV movies featuring Thor and Daredevil in a black costume?  And we can't forget Howard the Duck...Ughhh!  In that grand tradition comes this original Sci-fi Channel film.In the comics, Ted Sallis was a bio-chemist working for at a secret research facility in the Florida swamps for AIM to duplicate the legendary Super Soldier formula that created Captain America.  The experiment goes astray and Sallis is caught in an explosion sending him into swamp.  He degenerates into a muck-covered beheomth with glowing red eyes.  Manthing was virtually non-intelligent but he was an empath and could feel emotion, especially fear.  Anyone showing fear would burn at the touch of the Manthing.This movie just basically ditches that entire history.  We never see Sallis at all...we just hear that he disappeared into the swamps.  Seems the native Americans are upset over a corporations drilling for oil in the swamps.  It's a tired, old cliched plot about the greedy industrialist forcing others off their land..yadda yadda...and up rises the Manthing for revenge, killing anyone who enters the black waters of his swamp.  The corporation is owned by Frederic Schist and his son Jake.  There's one classic scene in their Hummer where they share a father and son maniacal laugh that has to be seen to be believed.Anyway a new sheriff comes to town and begins to investigate the disappearances and also the Schist company.  he gets some help from a local girl and another indian.  The Indian gives us some background on Manthing referring to him as a spirit of the swamp.  Meanwhile there's all sorts of nuts running around this swamo including a photographer looking for his big picture, a Bayou crazy who wears a robe and is responsible for the vandalism against the Schist corp., and a couple of red-neck brothers who try to stop the new Sheriff.It's just one big swampy mess.  Most of the actors have few acting credits and it shows.  This is even worse than most SciFi films.  How desperate is Marvel to make a buck anyway that they would allow such a mess like this to happen?  As far as the creatture goes, it probably is the best thing about the movie but ir really doesn't show up until the last 20 minutes or so of the film.  Add to that his powers to control branches and such owe more to Swamp Thing than to the Manthing.It's really just a total mess from the word go.  I'll give it two stars just for the Manthing creature but there's nothing else remotely redeeming in the film.Reviewed by Tim Janson",2,"MARVEL, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???",1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2812,"['Manthing', 'reminded', 'Marvel', '1970', 'early', '80', 'when', 'were', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'characters', 'TV', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'badly', 'came', 'off', 'Who', 'can', 'forget', 'horrible', 'Captain', 'America', 'TV', 'movies', 'Reb', 'Brown', 'Dr', 'Strange', 'TV', 'movie', 'who', 'how', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Thor', 'Daredevil', 'black', 'costume', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'Ughhh', 'grand', 'tradition', 'original', 'Sci-fi', 'Channel', 'comics', 'Ted', 'Sallis', 'was', 'bio-chemist', 'working', 'secret', 'research', 'facility', 'Florida', 'swamps', 'AIM', 'duplicate', 'legendary', 'Super', 'Soldier', 'formula', 'created', 'Captain', 'America', 'experiment', 'astray', 'Sallis', 'caught', 'explosion', 'sending', 'swamp', 'muck-covered', 'beheomth', 'glowing', 'red', 'eyes', 'Manthing', 'was', 'virtually', 'non-intelligent', 'was', 'empath', 'could', 'feel', 'emotion', 'especially', 'fear', 'Anyone', 'showing', 'fear', 'would', 'burn', 'touch', 'Manthing.This', 'movie', 'just', 'basically', 'entire', 'history', 'never', 'see', 'Sallis', 'just', 'hear', 'disappeared', 'swamps', 'native', 'Americans', 'are', 'upset', 'corporations', 'drilling', 'oil', 'swamps', 'tired', 'old', 'cliched', 'plot', 'greedy', 'industrialist', 'forcing', 'others', 'land..yadda', 'yadda', 'up', 'Manthing', 'revenge', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'black', 'waters', 'swamp', 'corporation', 'owned', 'Frederic', 'Schist', 'son', 'Jake', 'one', 'classic', 'scene', 'Hummer', 'where', 'share', 'father', 'son', 'maniacal', 'laugh', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.Anyway', 'new', 'sheriff', 'town', 'investigate', 'disappearances', 'also', 'Schist', 'company', 'help', 'local', 'girl', 'indian', 'Indian', 'background', 'Manthing', 'referring', 'spirit', 'swamp', 'Meanwhile', 'sorts', 'nuts', 'running', 'around', 'swamo', 'including', 'photographer', 'looking', 'big', 'picture', 'Bayou', 'crazy', 'who', 'robe', 'responsible', 'vandalism', 'Schist', 'corp.', 'couple', 'red-neck', 'brothers', 'who', 'try', 'stop', 'new', 'Sheriff.It', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'swampy', 'mess', 'Most', 'actors', 'have', 'few', 'acting', 'credits', 'even', 'worse', 'most', 'SciFi', 'films', 'How', 'desperate', 'Marvel', 'make', 'buck', 'anyway', 'would', 'allow', 'mess', 'happen', 'As', 'far', 'creatture', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'ir', 'really', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'Add', 'powers', 'control', 'branches', 'such', 'owe', 'more', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'Manthing.It', 'really', 'just', 'total', 'mess', 'word', 'go', ""'ll"", 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'just', 'Manthing', 'creature', 'nothing', 'else', 'remotely', 'redeeming', 'film.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",Man-Thing

902896,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0009A409S,Wuchak,"[8, 11]","Marvel Comics' Man-Thing is a mindless, empathic swamp creature that lives in the Everglades. This 2005 film is loosely based on the story ""Cry of the Native"" from the 1973 comic Adventure Into Fear #16, which featured the Man-Thing, by writer Steve Gerber and Howland, Ohio's Val Mayerik (artist).WHAT WORKS: The plot's great: The Seminoles and environmentalists are upset over a developer taking over their precious swamp. A new police chief comes into town and has to deal with the situation, as well as investigate an increasing number of horrifying deaths in the swamp and reports of a ""man-thing"" creature living there.The swamp sets, cinematography, music, locations (Sydney, Australia -- of all places) and cast are all quite good. This is not a Grade-Z movie. As a matter of fact, it was originally intended for theatrical release.The film has a good mysterious feel to it, in particular the first 30 minutes and final 20 minutes. The vibe, to be expected, is very comic booky, but the material is respected and generally taken seriously, avoiding the rut of camp.What works best is the ""Man-Thing"" itself; imagine Val Mayerik's rendition of the creature with a bunch of creepy branches & roots sticking out of its back & head and you'd have a pretty good idea of what ol' Manny looks like in this film -- he's an 8-foot tall, hulking, and utterly horrifying piece of man-like swamp mass.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Although the Man-Thing looks great, which is a cinematic triumph in and of itself, he doesn't appear fully until the last 20 minutes. This would be fine if the story were captivating, like say ""Jaws"", but it's not. Although the plot's great, the story itself barely holds your attention after the first half hour and is unnecessarily convoluted with pointless characters. The middle-hour is wasted on various characters hanging out in the swamp for one reason or another, half of them getting picked off by the creature. I'm sure they did this to show-off the cool swamp sets and lighting, etc., but they forgot the most important part -- an interesting story and characters. This makes no sense since Gerber's run on the comic contains a wealth of great material for compelling scripts.Unfortunately, the film deviates too far from Man-Thing's original concept. Some new ideas introduced are great -- like the way the creature looks and horrifically attacks people -- but where's Manny's empathic nature? Where's the ""whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch"" element? And why does Manny kill people indistinguishably? For instance, the creature kills a noble native at one point and later threatens the two protagonists of the story. The Man-Thing never did this in the comics even though he was a mindless creature.Also, the Man-thing in the film is not Ted Salis (although Salis fits into the storyline another way); in the film the swamp monster is the spirit-guardian of the ""Dark Water"" area of the swamp, which is a nexus to another dimension, apparently birthed because of Salis' murder. At least the nexus aspect is faithful to the comic.COMPARISON: The first comic featuring the Man-thing beat out DC's Swamp Thing by two months in 1971, but Theodore Sturgeon's similar swamp creature ""It"" appeared in one of his short stories 31 years earlier! The first comic book bog beast, The Heap, appeared two years later in 1942, obviously inspired by Sturgeon's creature.Let's compare the films ""Man-Thing"" and the similar ""Swamp Thing"" from 1982. To be expected, the creature from ""Man-Thing"" absolutely blows away the guy-in-a-rubber-suit in ""Swamp-Thing."" The sets, atmosphere and cinematography of ""Man-Thing"" are also better than ""Swamp-Thing,"" not to mention the vibe's not as goofy. As for the story, I would say they're about equal.I suggest watching ""Swamp-Thing"" and ""Man-Thing"" back-to-back, like I just did. Then, if you really want to get wild & crazy, catch ""Frogs"" and ""Pumpkinhead"". You'll be swamped out after this.FINAL ANALYSIS: The midsection of ""Man-Thing"" is lethargic and meandering, filled with uninteresting or undeveloped characters, but the film's attributes noted above make it worth checking out if you're into creature-on-the-loose flicks, particularly swamp monster films. On that level it's a decent movie. The greatest part is the creature itself, which is a cinematic triumph, especially if you're a fan of the comic books. But these same fans will be disappointed because the film's a very loose interpretation. It's too bad because the potential for greatness was there.GRADE: C+",3,Deviates too much from the comic and has a boring midsection,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,4544,"['Marvel', 'Comics', 'Man-Thing', 'mindless', 'empathic', 'swamp', 'creature', 'Everglades', '2005', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'story', 'Cry', 'Native', '1973', 'comic', 'Adventure', 'Into', 'Fear', '16', 'featured', 'Man-Thing', 'writer', 'Steve', 'Gerber', 'Howland', 'Ohio', 'Val', 'Mayerik', 'artist', '.WHAT', 'plot', 'great', 'Seminoles', 'environmentalists', 'are', 'upset', 'developer', 'taking', 'over', 'precious', 'swamp', 'new', 'police', 'chief', 'town', 'deal', 'situation', 'as', 'well', 'investigate', 'increasing', 'number', 'horrifying', 'deaths', 'swamp', 'reports', 'man-thing', 'creature', 'living', 'there.The', 'swamp', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'music', 'locations', 'Sydney', 'Australia', 'places', 'cast', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'Grade-Z', 'movie', 'matter', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'theatrical', 'release.The', 'film', 'good', 'mysterious', 'feel', 'particular', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'vibe', 'be', 'expected', 'very', 'comic', 'booky', 'material', 'respected', 'generally', 'taken', 'seriously', 'avoiding', 'rut', 'camp.What', 'best', 'Man-Thing', 'imagine', 'Val', 'Mayerik', 'rendition', 'creature', 'bunch', 'creepy', 'branches', 'roots', 'sticking', 'back', 'head', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'ol', 'Manny', 'film', '8-foot', 'tall', 'hulking', 'utterly', 'horrifying', 'piece', 'man-like', 'swamp', 'mass.WHAT', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'WORK', 'Man-Thing', 'great', 'cinematic', 'triumph', ""n't"", 'appear', 'fully', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'story', 'were', 'captivating', 'say', 'Jaws', 'not', 'plot', 'great', 'story', 'barely', 'attention', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'unnecessarily', 'convoluted', 'pointless', 'characters', 'middle-hour', 'wasted', 'various', 'characters', 'hanging', 'out', 'swamp', 'one', 'reason', 'half', 'getting', 'picked', 'off', 'creature', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'show-off', 'cool', 'swamp', 'sets', 'lighting', 'etc.', 'forgot', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'interesting', 'story', 'characters', 'sense', 'Gerber', 'run', 'comic', 'wealth', 'great', 'material', 'compelling', 'scripts.Unfortunately', 'film', 'too', 'far', 'Man-Thing', 'original', 'concept', 'new', 'ideas', 'introduced', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'creature', 'horrifically', 'attacks', 'people', 'where', 'Manny', 'empathic', 'nature', 'Where', 'knows', 'fear', 'burns', 'Man-Thing', 'touch', 'element', 'why', 'Manny', 'kill', 'people', 'indistinguishably', 'instance', 'creature', 'noble', 'native', 'one', 'point', 'later', 'two', 'protagonists', 'story', 'Man-Thing', 'never', 'did', 'comics', 'even', 'was', 'mindless', 'creature.Also', 'Man-thing', 'film', 'not', 'Ted', 'Salis', 'Salis', 'storyline', 'way', 'film', 'swamp', 'monster', 'spirit-guardian', 'Dark', 'Water', 'area', 'swamp', 'nexus', 'dimension', 'apparently', 'birthed', 'Salis', 'murder', 'least', 'nexus', 'aspect', 'faithful', 'comic.COMPARISON', 'first', 'comic', 'featuring', 'Man-thing', 'beat', 'out', 'DC', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'two', 'months', '1971', 'Theodore', 'Sturgeon', 'similar', 'swamp', 'creature', 'appeared', 'one', 'short', 'stories', '31', 'years', 'earlier', 'first', 'comic', 'book', 'bog', 'beast', 'Heap', 'appeared', 'two', 'years', 'later', '1942', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'Sturgeon', 'creature.Let', 'compare', 'films', 'Man-Thing', 'similar', 'Swamp', 'Thing', '1982', 'be', 'expected', 'creature', 'Man-Thing', 'absolutely', 'away', 'guy-in-a-rubber-suit', 'Swamp-Thing', 'sets', 'atmosphere', 'cinematography', 'Man-Thing', 'are', 'also', 'better', 'Swamp-Thing', 'not', 'mention', 'vibe', 'not', 'goofy', 'story', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'equal.I', 'suggest', 'watching', 'Swamp-Thing', 'Man-Thing', 'back-to-back', 'just', 'did', 'Then', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'wild', 'crazy', 'catch', 'Frogs', 'Pumpkinhead', ""'ll"", 'be', 'swamped', 'out', 'this.FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'midsection', 'Man-Thing', 'lethargic', 'meandering', 'filled', 'uninteresting', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'film', 'attributes', 'noted', 'make', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'creature-on-the-loose', 'flicks', 'particularly', 'swamp', 'monster', 'films', 'level', 'decent', 'movie', 'greatest', 'part', 'creature', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'comic', 'books', 'same', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'very', 'loose', 'interpretation', 'too', 'bad', 'potential', 'greatness', 'was', 'there.GRADE', 'C+']",Man-Thing
