But but treat yourself to the series first.Marginal spoiler alert:The family member who turned me on the series warned me about the movie: ""Don't watch it! Characters you like will die....""And while this is indeed true, carnage does not befall the entire crew, so the finality is not wholesale.This story focuses on the Alliance's interest in River's special skills, and the Alliances desperate ploy to cover up the truth about the origin of the Reavers.

If you're a die-hard Firefly fan that's a purist about details, you might not like this movie.I read some of the 1-star reviews and I read some of the 5-star reviews. In both cases, I think people were a little too harsh on a movie that's very entertaining.For the Firefly fans, there were a few things that were inconsistent with the series, but in my opinion, they weren't major enough to detract from the entertainment value of the movie.The dialogue was just as quick-witted and sharp as it was on the series. The action and non-action scenes were balanced. I was not once bored during the film. While the deaths were heart-breaking and hard to bear, I understood why Joss wrote them in that way.I took both my mother and my girlfriend in to see this film in the theater. They both have rewatched it on DVD at least once, and now my girlfriend is watching the series because she liked the movie so much.

I have no basis for this film from the perspective of someone who is unfamiliar with the ""Firefly Universe"". Objectively speaking though, I believe even if you haven't seen the Firefly series you will still find this one of the best movies to come out in a long time.If you ever wondered what it would be like to watch a movie with comedy/horror/action/drama all rolled up into one succesfully then that is Serenity.There are a lot of characters in the film, but Mr. Whedon combined them all rather well. After the dismal showing of the Star Trek: Next Generation films which were basically suped up episodes I was skeptical about a TV series making a transition to film. This is not just another episode and it does take into account everything that happened in the TV series. It is a film with a great plot and excellent storytelling.The comedy is by far my favorite from this movie. I was laughing out loud quite a few times in the theatre. There are so many trash films that come out of late with suped up special effects or very boring storylines that watching Serenity was a real treat.If you haven't been to the movie theatre in awhile because of the lack of good films then give this one a try.

950951,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000BW7QWW,Adam Craig,"[8, 9]","The only way I can think of to describe Serenity would be a ""laid back"" movie that was well aware of its core audience, and well aware of ways to exploit its own genre, in a positive way.The crew of the Serenity is being trailed by the Alliance due to the fact that they are harboring a psychic girl with unknown powers.  In what seemed like an anti-big government screed, the movie presents the Alliance as an all powerful, corrupted, invasive government that tries to control every aspect of the life in the new solar system.  River, the psychic girl, knows some secret that the Alliance has been keeping from its citizens; a secret that could cause the whole thing to come crashing down.  So the alliance sends its best assassin after the girl, and the whole crew of the Serenity.  The assassin, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is one of the best villains I have seen in a movie in quite a long time.  A lot of that is thanks to his acting, but also thanks to the writing of Joss Whedon.  The writing in this movie is amazing.  Whedon does an amazing job of giving each character their own distinct personality.  Each Serenity crew member adds something, and by the end of the movie, you are really rooting for the crew as a family.  The dialogue is interesting, not overdone, and extremely funny in some parts.The action is cool.  Yeah, there are some cheesy parts.  But you are rooting for the good guys so much, you just don't care how cheesy it is.  Near the end, I was almost standing up yelling at the TV for crew of the Serenity to fight their way out of the situation.  Technically, the movie is also very well-done.  The special effects are pretty dang cool.  The one real ""battle"" scene in the movie provides some amazing visuals, with the Serenity spinning out of control down through the atmosphere in the middle of a huge battle between the Alliance and the Reavers.Like I said, I never watched Firefly, but now I feel like it might be worth a shot.  In the least, I think that Joss Whedon is an amazingly talented up-and-coming filmmaker.  I can't wait for his next movie, I hope some studio will give him the opportunity to really create another vision of his like he did with this film.",4,"From someone who's never seen Firefly, a really cool film",1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,2201,"['only', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'describe', 'Serenity', 'would', 'be', 'laid', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'aware', 'core', 'audience', 'well', 'aware', 'ways', 'exploit', 'own', 'genre', 'positive', 'way.The', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'being', 'trailed', 'Alliance', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'harboring', 'psychic', 'girl', 'unknown', 'powers', 'what', 'seemed', 'anti-big', 'government', 'screed', 'movie', 'Alliance', 'powerful', 'corrupted', 'invasive', 'government', 'control', 'aspect', 'life', 'new', 'solar', 'system', 'River', 'psychic', 'girl', 'secret', 'Alliance', 'been', 'keeping', 'citizens', 'secret', 'could', 'cause', 'whole', 'thing', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'alliance', 'best', 'assassin', 'girl', 'whole', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'assassin', 'played', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'one', 'best', 'villains', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'quite', 'long', 'time', 'lot', 'thanks', 'acting', 'also', 'thanks', 'writing', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'writing', 'movie', 'amazing', 'Whedon', 'amazing', 'job', 'giving', 'character', 'own', 'distinct', 'personality', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'member', 'something', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'rooting', 'crew', 'family', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'not', 'overdone', 'extremely', 'funny', 'parts.The', 'action', 'cool', 'Yeah', 'are', 'cheesy', 'parts', 'are', 'rooting', 'good', 'guys', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'cheesy', 'end', 'was', 'almost', 'standing', 'up', 'yelling', 'TV', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'fight', 'way', 'situation', 'Technically', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'well-done', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'dang', 'cool', 'one', 'real', 'battle', 'scene', 'movie', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'Serenity', 'spinning', 'control', 'down', 'atmosphere', 'middle', 'huge', 'battle', 'Alliance', 'Reavers.Like', 'said', 'never', 'watched', 'Firefly', 'now', 'feel', 'might', 'be', 'shot', 'least', 'think', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'up-and-coming', 'filmmaker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'movie', 'hope', 'studio', 'will', 'give', 'opportunity', 'really', 'create', 'vision', 'did', 'film']",N/A

And you don't see things coming.I walked out a Browncoat with nobody to tell. It was (mostly) magic. A ticket to a science fiction world you've glimpsed maybe here and there. And here you are in it.The reviews (I scoured them) were downright weird: 4 star reviews that duck at the end and say ""well, you know if you like this kind of stuff"" (as if it must be washed off).What does FIREFLY/SERENITY have to do to get noticed (so that the money guys will give us another fix)?

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[15, 17]","As I glance through other reviews of this film, I see several people mention that they had not seen the television series prior to watching this film.  While most still loved what Whedon had to offer in this big screen adaptation, I must warn everyone that you MUST watch the television series first.  There are character connections and emotional moments that you may not develop an understanding about without watching the series first.  Serenity is a conclusionary film in the sense that its purpose is to finally answer those questions that were left on the table at the end of the television series.  With that said, Serenity is the BEST conclusionary film ever!  The true conclusion to Whedon's science fiction epic is finally told with the budget it deserved.  While I do believe that Whedon could have successfully done this perhaps seven seasons later, due to the final termination of the first season, he did the best that he could.  Actually, who am I kidding, he did magnificently.I am an enormous, yet new, fan of this series.  For those that have not experienced the television show Firefly, you are missing out on possibly the best that television had to offer.  This film is just a brief snippet of what was offered in the television series.  So much of this film is left up to the idea that the viewer has seen the television series, no matter what others may say.  You need to watch the television series first.  Whedon has amazingly transformed the bond between these characters, the tension, the excitement, the passion, and given them their feature debut.  Everyone, from the small background characters to the head-honchos of this crew, give more than 100% in their efforts for Whedon's dream.  It is obvious as you watch this conclusion that those involved with this series were extremely passionate about what Whedon was creating.  The actors were completely immersed in their roles, giving us the same spunk, pizzazz, and charm from the original series.  Watching Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau reprise their characters was like revisiting your favorite book on a beautiful spring day at the beach.  Nothing could have been more enjoyable or relaxing.One of the aspects that I love about this film is that Whedon honestly does answer all of those burning questions that are in the back of your mind.  Fans of the show will know what I am talking about.  Those watching the series and wondering about River, Reavers, the Alliance, and a bit about Book will know more coming out of this film.  Whedon does not disappoint his fans.  He does this by keeping so many of the same elements in the film that we grew to love in the television series.  The very technological CGI, the western atmosphere (though this film does feel a bit more sci-fi than the television series), and the bond between the crew (a element that you do not see in most television film adaptations) are all points that made the series great.  Whedon has taken these and crafted one of the best films this year.  Even three years after the final episode, Whedon remembers what brought his fans to this series.  He remembers the humanity of the characters, the humbleness of Mal, and the fire that is in each of their eyes.  It is about having faith (but not always about God), it is about honesty, and it is about courage and dedication.  After watching this film you cannot help but feeling motivated to get up and fight for what you believe in.  Mal and his crew ignite that passion within you!If I had to have two gripes about this film, they would be very small, yet still dwelling within my mind.  Where were the men in the blue gloves?  Remember, River always chanted, ""two by two""?  There was even an episode called ""Ariel"" nearly dedicated to them.  I wish Whedon had expanded with them instead of focusing so contently on this Operative.  While I think the Operative was amazing, I just kept thinking about them throughout the film.  The second remaining question that I had was this, ""Who was Shepard Book""?  I thought out of all of the characters, even River, he was the most complex.  While he is hardly in this film, he continues to force us to ponder on what is truly in his past.  What makes him different, yet special at the same time?  Just two simple questions that I did not feel validated by the end of the film.  Small gripes, nothing huge to talk about.Overall, this movie was fantastic.  It carries everything a sci-fi, western, action genre person would want.  Whedon proves that he has the power to control his characters and develop honest stories that keep simple themes and devoted morals.  Serenity was nothing short, to use words from my Firefly review, of perfection on a stick.  Never have I finished a series, coupled with a film, only to want to start from the beginning again to see my old ""friends"" in action.  I actually felt very emotional when this film was over because I really didn't want to have a final closing to this series.  I wanted to know that my friends would still be out there waiting to make me laugh, enjoy an adventure, and grow challenging secrets.  It is what I loved about the TV series, and it is what completed this film for me.Whedon, from Firefly to Serenity, I applaud you!!BRAVO JOSS, BRAVO!!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,Half of writing

I saw the first two or three episodes and then I gave up on it; the central mystery of the crazy girl was interesting but the individual episodes were slowly paced and bland. With the episodic structure gone, Serenity takes Firefly's central mystery and runs with it, creating a fast-paced, consistently entertaining sci-fi western.The movie is a lot of fun, with sharp dialog and pretty good acting (especially the assassin played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), but like Star Wars, there's really not much to it beyond surface flash. Which is okay, since I'm a sucker for good surface flash, but it does mean this cannot be called great science fiction; just very good action.While I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it does contain one of the central flaws of the series; the characters are a little bland, except for Gina Torres and the aforementioned Ejiofor. Nathan Fillion is a decent dashing hero, but he lacks the panache of a Harrison Ford or Errol Flyn. The crazy girl is an interesting concept but the actress doesn't have much to do except look fretful, and her brother is painfully bland. The other couple of women are likable but really don't have much to do. And the big tough guy, I almost forgot to even mention him.It seems Whedon's concept of a sci-fi western included using typical western stock characters, and I think that was a mistake. You can't have a good series full of two-dimensional heroes.

Now, I'm not sure why I liked the movie so much.  I don't know if it was because I really liked the series, or because the movie was indeed ""just good"" despite the short lived series.  Who knows.  I do know that the people I went to see the movie with, who had never watched the series, liked the movie as well.My only complaint is that it ""babied"" those who didn't watch the series or know anything about the series for too long.  If this had been the season premiere of Firefly, many things they showed you and talked about in this movie would have been editted out.  I was like, ""yeah, we know this already, let's move on"".

This time, the movie was actually better than the previews, an achievement in itself.P.S.Sure I wish for a Serenity 2, but I'm not certain it should be made.  This movie was made in such a way, I don't think it could be topped by another.  It's like when Michael Jorden retired, he should have stayed retired.  Joss Whedon may be very talented, but I think he should leave this series alone, for now.  I'll still like to read the books though.

When I bought the DVD set I knew it was limited and therefor enjoyed it the more knowing it was as scarce as a rare jewel.Serenity as a film succeeds in the way that most space-operas fail: character development. In so many space opera characters are virtually interchangable and few have anything that really sets them apart. Serenity and Firefly revels in the characterizations and plays on the differences to make the whole better and stronger.I have read several professional reviews that opined that Serenity was better cast, written and performed than any of the last 3 Star Wars episodes. On this I heartily agree. Serenity makes the Star Wars look like as superficial as a Japanime cartoon in comparison.Dialog is fast and witty. Spec-effects are on par with the best of the best ( and probably done for a fraction of the cost of others) and Whedon's writing and directing make this a personal film with a strong libertarian streak throughout.The Firefly/Serenity universe is probably realistic for the time imagined -  +500 years. No aliens, no transporter beams, but  strong and pervasive internet ( the Cortex ), and above all practicality.You can see the future here and believe it.For those of you not familiar with the Firefly/Serenity universe, it may seem odd at first - old western. But logic it out. It makes sense. The Allinace terraforms ""dozens of planets and hundreds of moons"" populates them and leaves them to their own devices except when it's tax time. Most are forced into a agrarian economic base and a technology equivalent to the mid 1800's.Anyway way it doesn't matter all that much anyway because the plot doesn't depend on laser battles and weird aliens. It's about people and their yearning for freedom and our hope that 500 years is not enough time to stamp out the love of freedom no matter how powerful the Alliance or the Fed become and that individuals can triumph and live their own lives.Serenity is easily on par with the new Battlestar Galactica which according to Wired magazine is the ""best show on television"".Lets all hope that the success of this film will revive the series or at the very least lead to second movie.",5,Shiny,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,2344,"['movie', 'exceeded', 'expectation', 'had.I', 'got', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'ballistic', 'when', 'morons', 'FOX', 'cancelled', 'When', 'bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'knew', 'was', 'limited', 'therefor', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'knowing', 'was', 'as', 'scarce', 'rare', 'jewel.Serenity', 'film', 'way', 'most', 'space-operas', 'fail', 'character', 'development', 'so', 'many', 'space', 'opera', 'characters', 'are', 'virtually', 'interchangable', 'few', 'have', 'anything', 'really', 'apart', 'Serenity', 'Firefly', 'revels', 'characterizations', 'plays', 'differences', 'make', 'whole', 'better', 'stronger.I', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'professional', 'reviews', 'opined', 'Serenity', 'was', 'better', 'cast', 'written', 'performed', 'last', '3', 'Star', 'Wars', 'heartily', 'agree', 'Serenity', 'Star', 'Wars', 'look', 'as', 'superficial', 'Japanime', 'cartoon', 'comparison.Dialog', 'fast', 'witty', 'Spec-effects', 'are', 'par', 'best', 'best', 'probably', 'done', 'fraction', 'cost', 'others', 'Whedon', 'writing', 'directing', 'make', 'personal', 'film', 'strong', 'libertarian', 'streak', 'throughout.The', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'universe', 'probably', 'realistic', 'time', 'imagined', '+500', 'years', 'aliens', 'transporter', 'beams', 'strong', 'pervasive', 'internet', 'Cortex', 'practicality.You', 'can', 'see', 'future', 'here', 'believe', 'it.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'universe', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'first', 'old', 'western', 'logic', 'out', 'sense', 'Allinace', 'dozens', 'planets', 'hundreds', 'moons', 'own', 'devices', 'when', 'tax', 'time', 'Most', 'are', 'forced', 'agrarian', 'economic', 'base', 'technology', 'equivalent', 'mid', ""1800's.Anyway"", 'way', ""n't"", 'matter', 'that', 'much', 'anyway', 'plot', ""n't"", 'depend', 'laser', 'battles', 'weird', 'aliens', 'people', 'yearning', 'freedom', 'hope', '500', 'years', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'stamp', 'out', 'love', 'freedom', 'matter', 'how', 'powerful', 'Alliance', 'Fed', 'become', 'individuals', 'can', 'triumph', 'live', 'own', 'lives.Serenity', 'easily', 'par', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'according', 'Wired', 'magazine', 'best', 'show', 'television', '.Lets', 'hope', 'success', 'film', 'will', 'revive', 'series', 'very', 'least', 'lead', 'second', 'movie']",N/A
950965,A402IK8HX9SBN,B000BW7QWW,"Alex Lovejoy ""Alex""","[4, 5]","Firefly, the series, is one of my all time favorite Sci-Fi / Future/Tech Fantasy TV shows.  I love the Wild West and Oriental cultural overtones ... I love the rough and tumble nature of the crew and their missions and lifestyle.  And I particularly loved the time and attention that was given to exploring and expressing the very different personalities of the crew members as their individual and collective stories were being unfolded. I just loved that series.  I watch the DVDs over and over.So, I was really very interested in what they were going to do with the Serenity movie.  Here's my take, now that I've seen it:A)  Were they true to the characters, themes and styles of the TV show?  YES, absolutely, though with a few twists.B)  Did they explore and expand on the themes and plot lines laid down in the series without doing so in a way that requires having seen the TV series to enjoy the movie?  YES.  Absolutely.C)  Was the mixture of action, suspense and quality gritty story telling up to the standard of the TV show.  Yes, absolutely.D)  Was the movie just like the series?  No.A series can take the time, week to week, to slowly and carefully unfold layers of it's characters and story lines that a movie simply can't.  The series brief 11 episodes had something like 450 minutes with which to carefully, slowly, gradually unfold these characters and story lines ... the movie had 119.  So I didn't expect the movie to have THE SAME feel as the show.  What I was hoping for was a look and feel that was consistent with the show while recognizing that a theatrical movie release has to have somewhat different goals from a TV series.  I think they did a great job of that.  And I really enjoyed the movie.I've seen some folks say that the movie lacked some of the personal intimacy of the TV show, and I think that's true.  Given the fact that it was a 2 hour movie and they had 9 characters to deal with in a balanced way, maintaining the same degree of intimacy while still presenting a movie that was compelling to the action/adventure crowd would have been amazingly difficult, if it's possible at all.  As someone who really loved that very personal feel the series had, I didn't think they gave up more of that in the movie than was absolutely necessary.  And if the gangbuster movie results win them a chance to give new birth to the TV show ... well, then they will have succeeded in achieving what I think was their and their fans dream of dreams.Were there any things I'd have done differently?  Yeah, but so what.  This show had a lot of very emotionally attached fans.  They can't do everything the way every fan would have preferred.  Did they do a great job that I felt totally able to enjoy?  Yes, you bet.  And the friend who went with me to the movie had only seen 2 of the 11 series episodes and he also enjoyed it ... and he's a pretty demanding Sci-Fi fan.",4,"VERY enjoyable, yet different from the series.",1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,2895,"['Firefly', 'series', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'Sci-Fi', '/', 'Future/Tech', 'Fantasy', 'TV', 'shows', 'love', 'Wild', 'West', 'Oriental', 'cultural', 'overtones', 'love', 'rough', 'tumble', 'nature', 'crew', 'missions', 'lifestyle', 'particularly', 'loved', 'time', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'exploring', 'expressing', 'very', 'different', 'personalities', 'crew', 'members', 'individual', 'collective', 'stories', 'were', 'being', 'unfolded', 'just', 'loved', 'series', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'over.So', 'was', 'really', 'very', 'interested', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'Here', 'take', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Were', 'true', 'characters', 'themes', 'styles', 'TV', 'show', 'YES', 'absolutely', 'few', 'twists.B', 'Did', 'explore', 'expand', 'themes', 'plot', 'lines', 'laid', 'down', 'series', 'doing', 'so', 'way', 'having', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'YES', 'Absolutely.C', 'Was', 'mixture', 'action', 'suspense', 'quality', 'gritty', 'story', 'telling', 'up', 'standard', 'TV', 'show', 'Yes', 'absolutely.D', 'Was', 'movie', 'just', 'series', 'No.A', 'series', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'week', 'week', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'unfold', 'layers', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'movie', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'series', 'brief', '11', 'episodes', 'had', 'something', '450', 'minutes', 'carefully', 'slowly', 'gradually', 'unfold', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'movie', 'had', '119', 'So', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'have', 'THE', 'SAME', 'feel', 'show', 'What', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'look', 'feel', 'was', 'consistent', 'show', 'recognizing', 'theatrical', 'movie', 'release', 'have', 'somewhat', 'different', 'goals', 'TV', 'series', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'folks', 'say', 'movie', 'lacked', 'personal', 'intimacy', 'TV', 'show', 'think', 'true', 'Given', 'fact', 'was', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'had', '9', 'characters', 'deal', 'balanced', 'way', 'maintaining', 'same', 'degree', 'intimacy', 'still', 'presenting', 'movie', 'was', 'compelling', 'action/adventure', 'crowd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazingly', 'difficult', 'possible', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'loved', 'very', 'personal', 'feel', 'series', 'had', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'gave', 'up', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'gangbuster', 'movie', 'results', 'win', 'chance', 'give', 'new', 'birth', 'TV', 'show', 'well', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'succeeded', 'achieving', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'fans', 'dream', 'dreams.Were', 'things', ""'d"", 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'Yeah', 'so', 'what', 'show', 'had', 'lot', 'very', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'fans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'way', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'Did', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'felt', 'totally', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Yes', 'bet', 'friend', 'who', 'went', 'movie', 'had', 'only', 'seen', '2', '11', 'series', 'episodes', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'pretty', 'demanding', 'Sci-Fi', 'fan']",N/A

I can understand liking it if you're high on a few beers or a joint and you would find almost anything entertaining, but really, being fully sober I couldn't find anything to like about this. Even the story is somewhat muddled, something about a female action hero who is always ready to bang some heads together to save the day. I mean, please, there are better action movies!

950969,A52X1I4UT56KL,B000BW7QWW,"Amazon Customer ""debater7""","[7, 8]","Serenity gives Firefly fans what we all want (besides more Firefly): closure.  Director Whedon does a brilliant job of tying up loose ends by explaining the central mystery of Firefly and even developing the characters more.  He also leaves room for a continuation of the series, by advancing key relationships to points that would allow a new storyline, including making room for new characters.  I can't be more specific w/o including spoilers, but really, this movie's great strength is the amount of material it covers.  The Firefly saga gets wrapped up neatly and satisfyingly and Serenity works well as a a stand-alone because of the very fast pace required to explain what could have been the basis of an entire second season.As other reviewers point out, this is also the movie's only weakness.  Certain parts do seem rushed.  However, what is lost is not terribly significant.  For example, not much time is spent on Jayne, but, hey, Firefly had a whole episode focused on Jayne and his character isn't supposed to be terribly complex.  Meanwhile, Kaylee and Simon both get a lot of attention and River reaches a point where she could be more than merely mysterious and disfunctional.  We also get an explanation of the Reavers.Technically, Serenity is solid.  Good special effects, good dialog, good acting.  For non-Firefly fans, this is the best sci-fi movie to come out in a long while.  It moves faster, is funnier, has more realistic characters, and more interesting relationships than the Star Wars prequels. (I apologize in advance to the George Lucas fans out there). If you like sci-fi, Serenity will be pure joy.  If you like Westerns, it'll be good.  If you don't, this may be the one recent movie that can change your mind.Gongrats to the whole Firefly team.

I was concerned about several things:1.  Would people who didn't watch the series be able to follow along with the movie?2.  How was he going to make a two hour movie over a twenty episode series with hours of character development?3.  If the movie busted, would it kill future Joss Whedon projects?All of my concerns were met with outstanding answers:1.  The movie was done in a way that you could watch it without having seen the show (Although the show's character development does help).2.  Joss decided to pick a few specific character's stories and go with them in the movie (And the beautiful thing is, he left it open for sequels to go into the other characters' stories).3.  It didn't bust and Joss is already scheduled to write and direct two more movies in the next two years (Including the highly anticipated Wonder Woman)The movie is great.  It has the perfect combination of Whedon humor, action, story, drama, thrills, and character development.  It is a roller coaster ride that doesn't disappoint and I can't wait until the December release of the DVD, which with any luck will have all sorts of goodies on it.I hope and hope that the success of Serenity will also spawn one of two things; Either many sequels or a television network to pick up the the Firefly series and continue the saga that was so horribly murdered.",5,Outstanding Film and DVD should be too!!!,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1482,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'based', 'Firefly', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'began', 'wonder', 'how', 'would', 'make', 'was', 'concerned', 'several', 'things:1', 'Would', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'series', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'movie', '2', 'How', 'was', 'going', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'twenty', 'episode', 'series', 'hours', 'character', 'development', '3', 'movie', 'busted', 'would', 'kill', 'future', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'projects', 'concerns', 'were', 'met', 'outstanding', 'answers:1', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'could', 'watch', 'having', 'seen', 'show', 'show', 'character', 'development', 'help', '.2', 'Joss', 'decided', 'pick', 'few', 'specific', 'character', 'stories', 'go', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'left', 'open', 'sequels', 'go', 'other', 'characters', 'stories', '.3', 'did', ""n't"", 'bust', 'Joss', 'already', 'scheduled', 'write', 'direct', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'Including', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'movie', 'great', 'perfect', 'combination', 'Whedon', 'humor', 'action', 'story', 'drama', 'thrills', 'character', 'development', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'December', 'release', 'DVD', 'luck', 'will', 'have', 'sorts', 'goodies', 'it.I', 'hope', 'hope', 'success', 'Serenity', 'will', 'also', 'spawn', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'Either', 'many', 'sequels', 'television', 'network', 'pick', 'up', 'Firefly', 'series', 'continue', 'saga', 'was', 'so', 'horribly', 'murdered']",N/A

As well as the short lived Firefly series that this was based off of.  The series I never got into.  Didn't hate it, just wasn't my type of show though I am a big fan of his other creations.As a movie Firefly is ok.  It is fun, lighthearted, not overly violent or strange so it is kid friendly, and Whedon's wit still shines here and there.The problems are that there are a lot of flaws in the writing and the directions that were odd for Whedon to make.The concept is nothing new.  There was a b movie in the early 90's called Oblivon that won a few indie film awards that was the same concept, sci fi western and parody.  Wild west themes also played heavily into the original Star Wars series.Whedon is well renowned in Buffy and Angel for making interesting bad guys, or big bads; the Mayor, Wolfram and Hart, Spike and Drusilla, Adam.  This group however is rarely seen aside from their ninja superagent.  The other problem is that they are pretty much Britain in everything but name.  Which is a long running cliche in American movies. In an interview Kenneth Branagh commented on how America needs to let it go and stop making British villians.  If more focus had been made on it I would have accepted it as a joke.  He made similar references to good guys in Buffy, calling them white hats.  But here they are just vague references to a parliment and well refined British speaking bad guys that are an afront to the goodly salt of the earth heroes.The action sequences were a dissappointment.  They were often filmed too close to see what was going on. Strange flaw for the maker of Buffy.  Mostly what you see is random images of peoples facesThere was also the problem that this film offered little for those who haven't seen the show.  I reall just didn't care about the characters and for the life of me can't remember anything specific about any of them save the captain and young girl.this movie I give four stars for my dedication to whedon and appreciation for what he has done.  but I wouldn't advise it to anyone that wasn't a fan of his or who hadn't seen the show.

There are things that I felt like I missed because I didn't watch the show, but Whedon goes out of his way to make sure that everyone will enjoy this movie.And enjoyed it and there are some good scenes, and I am not usually a sci-fi fan (with the exception of the outstanding, ""Fifth Element,"" which is like this movie in that it's not all about the action or the genre, but there are actual human elements to the characters and a good dose of humor sprinkled into the mix).The story itself is message oriented, without feeling like you're being beaten over the head for it, and as already stated, the humorous moments were a bit wrecked since most of them are shown in the trailer of the movie.The acting is well, for the film. Because the entire case of the television show is brought back for the movie, they've developed a great rapport and a style that shows they genuinely care about each other as actors and characters. This leads to all kind of great moments in which the characters interact almost as family, which is the whole point of the story, that this family is on the run and will do anything for each other. There are a few things in the film that are a bit confusing, not so confusing that you won't understand the story but you might just have to re-think it twice. I was expecting to see a little bit more buttkicking from the girl, River instead she just fights in two moments of the movie. The plot very oddly, was very similar to Resident Evil: Apocalypse which was also a great film. The only bad thing about this film, is the plot was a bit too stretched and it took a small tad of time to realize what they were doing. Overall This movie deserves a 4/5 and was very nice.

Well...1) As a huge fan of the Firefly series, I enjoyed immensely the relevance to the plot line and inclusion of main characters.2) Okay, I admit it... River (played superbly by young actress Summer Glau) is extremely good-looking and a great actress.  Plus, the fact that she kicked major undead ass trying to defend Simon and the rest of the crew (using her amazing karate skills and a sword and a handax stolen from a dead undead) scores a billion cool points in my book.3) Two words: SPECIAL EFFECTS!!  Even though Firefly's SE was great, Serenity's CGIs blow all competition out of the water.4) The film is directed by Joss Whedon, the producer of two of the best series ever, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  Whedon did an excellent job on the two series, but outdoes himself a million times over writing and directing Serenity.5) The plot rocks.  What else can I say?6) The Reavers (cannibalistic bounty hunters) were cool, but I loved seeing the crew kick their asses the one time they meet face to face.All in all, Serenity has something for everyone... It has romance, action, and some funny parts.  If I could give it more than five stars, rest assured I would.

950994,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000BW7QWW,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[12, 15]","I still can't believe this movie was even made.  After all, Serenity is the follow-up to a failed TV show from 2002 that lasted only 11 episodes on FOX.  Sure the DVD sales for the complete series of Firefly have been amazing, but that is no indicator of how a movie will do.  Yet, Universal Pictures took a chance and bought the movie rights from FOX.  Reassembling the original cast and creator, they made the hopes and dreams of Browncoats (Firefly fans) everywhere.  The series left many questions unanswered (supposedly, creator Joss Whedon planned out seven years of storylines for the show), and fans saw this movie as not only a way to get answers for their questions, but it was a way to revisit the Firefly universe and its beloved characters.  You see, it's not just the stories that made Firefly a great show, it was also the amazing cast.  People genuinely cared for the characters, and being able to see them again was, as I said, a dream come true.Six months after the series finale of Firefly, things have only gotten worse on the firefly-class transport ship Serenity.  Due to the overbearing government, known as the Alliance, work is becoming harder and harder to come by for petty thieves like Capt. Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew.  This is causing the ship to fall into further disrepair, despite the best efforts of their gifted mechanic, Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and makes flying the ship more and more difficult for skilled pilot Hoban ""Wash"" Washburn (Alan Tudyk).  Meanwhile, former crew members Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a registered companion (read: prostitute), and Sheperd Deria Book (Ron Glass) have left the ship for reasons that, while differnt, both involve Mal.  Furthermore, fugitive siblings Simon (Sean Maher) and River Tam (Summer Glau) are still wanted by the Alliance, and the government is getting desperate.  They have recently enlisted one of their nameless, rankless officers, known only as The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to bring in River Tam.  The Operative is simultaneously a ruthless killing machine, skilled in all types of combat and strategy, and an articulate orator who deeply believes in the possibility of a world without sin.While The Operative hunts down Serenity, Mal has decided to take River along with himself, Zoe Warren (Gina Torres), his first mate and wife to Wash, and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) on their missions/jobs due to her ability to psychically read the thoughts of others.  Simon disapproves of this, fearing that she will somehow get hurt or caught.  Despite a good performance by River, Simon becomes enraged after the crew narrowly escapes an attack by Reavers (cannibalistic madmen) while on the mission, and decides that he and River are going to leave the ship and find a new transport.  Of course, things don't always go as planned on Serenity, and when the crew discovers one of River's latent abilities, they are forced to keep her onboard.Everything about this movie, in my opinion, goes well above and beyond any expectations I may have had prior to seeing it.  As usual, Joss Whedon delivers his trademark witty dialogue and (more importantly) an amazing plot.  A good amount of our questions from the series are not only answered, but answered superbly.  I never would have guessed at what really happened, and yet it makes sense and is truly a revelation.  Other questions were left unanswered, to be addressed in later movies (which unfortunately, as of right, now doesn't look like a possibility).  And while the level of character development isn't as good as it was in the series, this is a two-hour movie; there is only so much time to devote to each aspect (such as plot, action, and development).  Whedon has said that the film is pretty much season 2 of the series crammed into two hours.  He had to take out a lot of character stuff (such as a relationship between Mal and Inara) in order to tell us River's story.Furthermore, the actors all do phenominal jobs.  No one in the movie is on Hollywood's A-list, but I almost prefer it that way.  The original cast obviously have great chemistry together, and it is clear that they are all happy to be back.  Meanwhile, newcomers like Ejiofor and David Krumholtz give very solid performances as well (although Krumholtz's Mr. Universe is a bit of a silly character).For a film that was only made for about $40 million, the special effects look great.  With few exceptions (such as few shots in the chase scene near the beginning), the effects look seamless.  The ending battle is one of my favorite space battles in movie history, and yes, I have seen the original Star Wars trilogy.All in all, this is an amazing film.  I can't understand how it didn't take off.  It was supposed to be a sleeper hit, with word-of-mouth as its primary proponent.  For some reason, despite rave reviews from both mainstream and non-mainstream critics in addition to support from both old and new fans, the general movie-going public was very apathetic towards Serenity.  Sadly, a lot of people missed out on one of the year's best films.  Hopefully, the DVD* will win over all those people who didn't want to pay $10 for a ticket (so worth it).  Find Serenity, for there is no place that you can be once you find it.  They'll never take the skies from us.*Speaking of DVDs, I'm really afraid that Universal is going to release a multi-disc super special edition sometime down the line.

(And a spoiler warning)I loved that Serenity and crew were flying again! ""Serenity"" picks up the story at a point where the crew is embarking on almost a crucible of a sort; no one's coming out the same. Some may not come out at all.  While darker than the series, ""Serenity"" still retained most of what I loved about ""Firefly"".  The cast, characters, the story and the style were as welcome as old friends.  Heists, Reavers, government assassins and conspiracies, and the ""truth about River"" (alas, it appears we will never know the tantalizing truth about another mysterious character); my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  For an hour and a half, all was right in my `verse.During this rather dark chapter, I missed the humor that was more prevalent in the series.  The length of the film prohibited the quieter kind of individual moments between characters that I found appealing and gave them clich&eacute;-killing depths (Before live-in-the-moment-mercenary  Jane's conversation with Book in the Firefly episode, ""The Message"", who would have pictured him giving much thought to his life, death, or God. Or giving much thought to anything really!).  But this movie deals with hard times on Serenity.  As with many of my favorite shows, books, or movies, at the end I had the feeling that the story could not have been done better any other way.  ""Whedon and Co."" are Storytellers; they have stories to tell and they know how to do it.  A smart network or studio would just get out of their way and let them do what they do.(Warning Mini-Spoiler coming)  Before the movie's release, I dreaded the rumored loss of any of the main characters.  I've always found it difficult to choose a ""favorite"" character; they all appealed at different times for different reasons (a rare hallmark of good writing and acting).  Dramatically speaking, it did raise tension; literally no one was safe.  (Still, something in me insists that it sucks.)  But all is (almost.... mostly...) forgiven. I'll miss those irreplaceable characters and what they added to the mix (One has always reminded me of someone very special in my real life).

I think one thing I really like about the movie is that the bad guy (a trained assassin) has style. Unlike many stories where the villain is either a psycho or worse a poorly written idiot, this antagonist is fresh and fun. He knows what he's doing. He knows that it's wrong. But he also believes that he works for a higher purpose. He's soft spoken, violent, and skilled. It is the character chemistry and beautiful space landscapes that makes this movie so good.If you like the movie, I'd definitely recommend you get the entire Firefly series on DVD. It is also very good, and you will gain a new understanding of the characters from the series.P.S.

It's even more tragic that, due to the recent ineptitude of writers for both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, the vast majority of the moviegoing public will never even consider seeing what I believe is superlative cinematic storytelling in Serenity, writer/creator Joss Whedon's latest and best effort to date.For those of you who have seen last season's cancelled series Firefly (there's a sad tale in there all its own), this film is a splendid wrap-up, done with Joss Whedon's typical style and wit and an atypically luxurious budget for cinematography.  That's all I need say for you folks, but for those who haven't had the pleasure of getting to know Serenity's crew through the tv show, how to describe it...perhaps as a Space Western written for smart people?  No, that sounds snobbish, when I was only trying to make the point that the dialogue was more intelligent than what casual SF movie fans might have come to expect in recent years.Aw heck, here's all you need to know about Serenity:  a plot that involves lots of action, eye candy (in the form of great SFX, cinematography and good-looking actors), and classic human drama;  just enough humor to keep it from getting overwhelming; and the right amount of philosophy to ponder in the aftermath.  You can enjoy it whether you've ever watched Firefly or not, whether you care for megaSF like Star Wars or not, and whether you're in it for the characters or the fights.Bless you Joss...please keep `em coming.-Andrea, aka Merribelle",5,"Howling good story, well told in film.",1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1616,"['too', 'dahm', 'bad', 'Academy', 'never', 'seriously', 'considers', 'handing', 'award', 'Best', 'Film', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'tragic', 'due', 'recent', 'ineptitude', 'writers', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'vast', 'majority', 'moviegoing', 'public', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'consider', 'seeing', 'what', 'believe', 'superlative', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'Serenity', 'writer/creator', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'latest', 'best', 'effort', 'date.For', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'season', 'cancelled', 'series', 'Firefly', 'sad', 'tale', 'there', 'own', 'film', 'splendid', 'wrap-up', 'done', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'typical', 'style', 'wit', 'atypically', 'luxurious', 'budget', 'cinematography', 'need', 'say', 'folks', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'pleasure', 'getting', 'know', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'tv', 'show', 'how', 'describe', 'perhaps', 'Space', 'Western', 'written', 'smart', 'people', 'No', 'snobbish', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'make', 'point', 'dialogue', 'was', 'more', 'intelligent', 'what', 'casual', 'SF', 'movie', 'fans', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'recent', 'years.Aw', 'heck', 'here', 'need', 'know', 'Serenity', 'plot', 'lots', 'action', 'eye', 'candy', 'form', 'great', 'SFX', 'cinematography', 'good-looking', 'actors', 'classic', 'human', 'drama', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'getting', 'overwhelming', 'right', 'amount', 'philosophy', 'ponder', 'aftermath', 'can', 'enjoy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Firefly', 'not', 'care', 'megaSF', 'Star', 'Wars', 'not', ""'re"", 'characters', 'fights.Bless', 'Joss', 'please', 'keep', 'em', 'coming.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",N/A

Like millions of others, I was immediately drawn into Joss Whedon's show that included characters with realistic emotions, thick and overlapping plots and a great sense of humor, all of which are rarely seen in sci-fi let alone any type of television. With that being said Fox (as they have done so many times before, latest victim: Arrested Development) prematurely canceled a great series. Fortunately, the sole season of Firefly, along w/ unaired episodes, was released on DVD in 2003 to overwhelming success. And that's how we get to Serenity.So much was left unsaid in the series finale, so many questions were unanswered. Although it would have been a nice way to go, the last show was more of a sign of this that COULD HAVE come rather than a sign of this TO come. With Serenity, the basic premise of Objects in Space is expanded all throughout the Firefly 'verse in a 120 minuet epic that should exceed any fans wildest expectations.Serenity has everything a fan of Firefly could ask for and more. The story is so emotional, especially in the final 25 minuets, that it feels as if Firefly never left.You will be reminded of the first line in the show's theme song all throughout the movie as the story (for now) come full circle.

I think that everyone involved did a remarkable job in making this both a respectable extension of the television show and an entertaining standalone action movie. They both wrapped up the River Tamm storyline neatly and left breathing room for a possible sequel(s), whatever form that might take at this point.The dialogue is fresh and believable, the acting is inspired, the characters are as fans will tell you memorable, and the effects are awesome. Let's face it though, Joss Whedon's hallmark is coming up with a clever idea, memorable characters and letting the characters and dialog move the show. So what about the plot? Well at least he was smart enough to know his one weakness and steal from one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time-Forbidden Planet.

I saw some things that reminded me of Star Wars, some of Star Trek, and some of . . . well, other science fiction stories more generally. The girl River made me think of Lord of the Rings. But that's OK; it's all put together in a rather unique combination.At one level, this is a swashbuckling heroes adventure story. At another, it's a war story. Lots of technology for the nerds. And some rather spacey spiritual stuff, too. There's even a touch of romance. Just when I thought I understood (sort of) what was going on, something completely unexpected threw me off again. The fact is, it's got me hoping for a sequel.The basic story, as I understand it, is that in the far future, there came to be a major division among inhabited planets between those on the outer edges and those toward the center of ""civilization"" who formed an empire-like central government that behaves as if it is benevolent, and may even believe itself to be. But River saw the flaw even as a child in the opening scene. They meddle. They're not into freedom, they're into peace. In fact, the entire story seems to be about the tension between those two goals. River is the subject of some strange mind-control experiment that is really very spooky, but not well defined at first. Her older brother, a medical doctor, risks much to get her free from the authorities, but then she and her brother are hunted. It's clear she has been made into some sort of a weapon, but in exactly what way takes a while to be revealed.Anyway, her brother takes her back to the ship Serenity, where he has been ship's doctor while the ship is engaged in a variety of mercenary missions, some of them even legal. (Millenium Falcon, anyone?) Captain Mal is not happy with having a fugitive on board against his will, but reluctantly takes her along because there doesn't seem to be a lot of options. And she does have some useful talents, as he soon discovers.The crew is actually fighting two enemies: the Empire (OK, I may be going a little too much into the Star Wars analogy, but I don't recall what the authoritarians were called) and some rather horribly cannibalistic sub-humans called Reavers (think Tuscan Raiders). They don't just eat people, they prefer to eat them while they are still alive. Brace yourself: toward the end of the story we find out how the Reavers got that way. Not pleasant, not at all.There's also a Haven planet, run by a gentle sort called the Shepherd, and there's a mysterious planet that the authorities have gone to great lengths to keep secret. Yes, there are lots and lots of threads to this plot. I may watch it again someday.Four stars. I'd give it five if I understood better what was going on. There's a lot of action way too fast for me to follow, and sometimes people say things I simply do not get. Otherwise I'd probably give it five.",4,"Good Science Fiction, But Not the Best",1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,3009,"['understand', 'movie', 'started', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Firefly', 'probably', 'not', 'surprising', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'everything', 'went', 'saw', 'things', 'reminded', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'well', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'more', 'generally', 'girl', 'River', 'made', 'think', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'OK', 'put', 'together', 'rather', 'unique', 'combination.At', 'one', 'level', 'swashbuckling', 'heroes', 'adventure', 'story', 'war', 'story', 'Lots', 'technology', 'nerds', 'rather', 'spacey', 'spiritual', 'stuff', 'too', 'even', 'touch', 'romance', 'Just', 'when', 'thought', 'understood', 'sort', 'was', 'going', 'something', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'threw', 'off', 'again', 'fact', 'got', 'hoping', 'sequel.The', 'basic', 'story', 'understand', 'far', 'future', 'came', 'be', 'major', 'division', 'inhabited', 'planets', 'outer', 'edges', 'center', 'civilization', 'who', 'formed', 'empire-like', 'central', 'government', 'benevolent', 'may', 'even', 'believe', 'be', 'River', 'saw', 'flaw', 'even', 'child', 'opening', 'scene', 'meddle', ""'re"", 'not', 'freedom', ""'re"", 'peace', 'fact', 'entire', 'story', 'be', 'tension', 'two', 'goals', 'River', 'subject', 'strange', 'mind-control', 'experiment', 'really', 'very', 'spooky', 'not', 'well', 'defined', 'first', 'older', 'brother', 'medical', 'doctor', 'risks', 'much', 'get', 'free', 'authorities', 'then', 'brother', 'are', 'hunted', 'clear', 'been', 'made', 'sort', 'weapon', 'exactly', 'what', 'way', 'while', 'be', 'revealed.Anyway', 'brother', 'back', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'where', 'been', 'ship', 'doctor', 'ship', 'engaged', 'variety', 'mercenary', 'missions', 'even', 'legal', 'Millenium', 'Falcon', 'anyone', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'not', 'happy', 'having', 'fugitive', 'board', 'will', 'reluctantly', 'along', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'options', 'have', 'useful', 'talents', 'soon', 'discovers.The', 'crew', 'actually', 'fighting', 'two', 'enemies', 'Empire', 'OK', 'may', 'be', 'going', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Star', 'Wars', 'analogy', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'what', 'authoritarians', 'were', 'called', 'rather', 'horribly', 'cannibalistic', 'sub-humans', 'called', 'Reavers', 'think', 'Tuscan', 'Raiders', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'eat', 'people', 'prefer', 'eat', 'are', 'still', 'alive', 'Brace', 'end', 'story', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Reavers', 'got', 'way', 'Not', 'pleasant', 'not', 'also', 'Haven', 'planet', 'run', 'gentle', 'sort', 'called', 'Shepherd', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'authorities', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'keep', 'secret', 'Yes', 'are', 'lots', 'lots', 'threads', 'plot', 'may', 'watch', 'again', 'someday.Four', 'stars', ""'d"", 'give', 'five', 'understood', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'lot', 'action', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'follow', 'sometimes', 'people', 'say', 'things', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'probably', 'give', 'five']",N/A

The crew and the beloved bucket of bolts they call home, return on the big screen this time.  Malcom Reynolds [Nathan Filton] and his ragtam team of space buccaneers are harboring a pint size weapon in the form of a girl named River [Summer Glau].  She has used her mind reading abilities to inadvertantly garner some secrets that the evil Alliance doesn't want found out.  This leads to deadly entanglements with the Alliance, space cannibals called Reavers and a forgotten planet named Miranda.  Serenity's staff soon learns that the 90 pound waif that has been riding around with them is capable of taking on whole groups of weapon toting henchman by herself without breaking a nail.  You don't need to be a fan of the television series to enjoy this science fiction saga [as of this writing I have yet to see any of the 14 episodes].  The characters are well drawn out and the plot isn't so terribly complicated that you can't figure out the basic details quick enough to keep up with the fast moving script.  The movie has a silly, spaghetti western feel to it that somehow comes across as charming and amusing rather than quirky and annoying.  Comparisons to the Star Wars universe are inevitable, but Serenity doesn't get swallowed up by expectations of grandeur and legacy.  It is free to be razor sharp, witty and simply enjoyable.  At times, the George Lucas films seem to take themselves a little too seriously.  That is never a problem with Serenity.  Joss Whedon manages a near perfect balance between serious action sequences and humor.",5,CHARMING SPAGHETTI SPACE WESTERN,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",2005,1871,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'space', 'western', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'wide', 'audience', 'televison', 'was', 'unceremoniously', 'yanked', 'Fox', 'lineup', 'rock', 'solid', 'writing', 'Given', 'choice', 'make', 'money', 'make', 'quality', 'programs', 'broadcasters', 'logically', 'chose', 'former', 'Fortunately', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'nomad', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'beloved', 'bucket', 'bolts', 'call', 'home', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'time', 'Malcom', 'Reynolds', '[', 'Nathan', 'Filton', ']', 'ragtam', 'team', 'space', 'buccaneers', 'are', 'harboring', 'pint', 'size', 'weapon', 'form', 'girl', 'named', 'River', '[', 'Summer', 'Glau', ']', 'used', 'mind', 'reading', 'abilities', 'inadvertantly', 'garner', 'secrets', 'evil', 'Alliance', ""n't"", 'want', 'found', 'out', 'deadly', 'entanglements', 'Alliance', 'space', 'cannibals', 'called', 'Reavers', 'forgotten', 'planet', 'named', 'Miranda', 'Serenity', 'staff', 'soon', '90', 'pound', 'waif', 'been', 'riding', 'capable', 'taking', 'whole', 'groups', 'weapon', 'toting', 'henchman', 'breaking', 'nail', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'fan', 'television', 'series', 'enjoy', 'science', 'fiction', 'saga', '[', 'writing', 'have', 'yet', 'see', '14', 'episodes', ']', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'out', 'plot', ""n't"", 'so', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'basic', 'details', 'quick', 'enough', 'keep', 'up', 'fast', 'moving', 'script', 'movie', 'silly', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'feel', 'somehow', 'charming', 'amusing', 'rather', 'quirky', 'annoying', 'Comparisons', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'are', 'inevitable', 'Serenity', ""n't"", 'get', 'swallowed', 'up', 'expectations', 'grandeur', 'legacy', 'free', 'be', 'razor', 'sharp', 'witty', 'simply', 'enjoyable', 'times', 'George', 'Lucas', 'films', 'seem', 'take', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'never', 'problem', 'Serenity', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'near', 'perfect', 'balance', 'serious', 'action', 'sequences', 'humor']",N/A

The film will be most enjoyable for those who have seen the series, but it's still fun for those who haven't.It also has a stronger narrative through-line than the often leisurely television episodes, better special effects and make-up and even better writing.

The characters are quickly outlined and filled in, brought to life in their interactions with each other and the breakneck pace of the plot.  If it feels a bit rushed compared to most films, that is only because this movie has so much more to say.  This movie is not about space, politics, or good and evil, it is about people.  An unusually large cast of ""main characters"" is quickly and adeptly introduced to you, each of which is endearing in their own peculiar way.  A doctor with endless devotion to his sister, a mechanic with an unstoppable sunny disposition, a quirky and somewhat goofy pilot, a caring and wise religious man, a mildly dimwitted yet powerful mercenary, the doctor's tortured and talented young sister, an unfailingly loyal first mate, a stunning and adoring companion, and the rugged realist who captains them all in their attempts to carve out a life for themselves on the edge of civilization.The companion is actually a prostitute, and yet somehow she is the only character with any real social status and respectability in society.  And it doesn't bother you or seem quaint.  In the amazing world that has been created here, it just seems normal.That being said, so interested in every aspect of the ""verse"" due to brilliant and witty dialogue sprinkled over a deep and involving plot, I could have easily sat for another two hours if they had chosen to dig deeper into this world.  I swear I thought the whole thing lasted only 40 minutes.  The world Mr. Whedon has created is teeming with depth and completeness that draws you in quickly, and seems tangible from the first scene.As the plot unfolds and the action sets in, the interactions between the characters are engaging and brief, but much like old friends you haven't seen in awhile, you immediately understand where they are coming from and the intricacies and depths of their relationships to each other.  These relationships serve not only to illustrate the story and decisions they face, but they actually drive it forward and add great depth to the conflicts unfolding on screen.  As varied a crew as they are, they seem at home with each other and so real you'd think you might run into them at the shopping mall or grocery store.There is a heartfelt sincerity and love that is exuding from the experience of this film, and I consider myself lucky to have caught it at the end of its run in the theatres.  On a Sunday afternoon, with a rather old crowd and about a half-full theatre, the audience actually stood up and applauded this film when it finished.  A sixty year old woman walked out with tears in her eyes, and I myself actually had trouble driving all the way home, so many thoughts about family and friends were racing through my head.This film is all heart.

I personally don't care that the creator/writer has had other successful series.  This was the one I was focusing on at the moment.  Past success and/or fame does not automatically make something great.I really enjoyed the story-line and the characters.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the ship Serenity and it's multiple meaning.

This movie is about the spaceship Serenity where you're lucky if the spaceship just plain works.Serenity does a good job of projecting people into the future in a believable future.  The producers of the movies have slightly changed the way English is spoken.  Personally, I though this was a wonderful touch to the movie.  It gives a viewer a sense that things really have changed in the future.  I thought the speech patterns were quite believable.  I'm so bored of ""Picard"" and ""Data"" perfectly speaking the King's English.  On Serentity you'll get introduced to a form of English that seems like a cross between the old West and the Future.  The pattern of speech takes some getting used to.Serenity does a good job of showing the problem with a future government, the Alliance.  In the Alliance all people are equal but the civilized planets are just more equal than the uncivilized outer planets.  The basic cause of the problems in the universe is an out-of-control central government that wants to control all human behaviour.The plot of Serenity is the Alliance finally decides to hunt down River because River had the opportunity and ability to mind scan some high Alliance governmental officials.  I shall not give too much away to the Amazon.com reader.  Why?  It will wreck your viewing of the movie.The effects on the big screen are a lot better than what was done in the TV show of the movie.  Also, because this show was made for the big screen a little more could be done with the cast of characters.Serenity is a fun movie.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5.  I grade DVD movies much harder than books.  This movie will not go down as the best Sci-Fi ever made.  But this movie is a solid grade B+.  And what is wrong with just seeing a good movie?Serenity has action.  It explains the source of the Reavers.  It cleans up the back ground on River.  A long standing ship board romance gets going.  And we get to see some regretful goodbyes.Also, the movie has some parts on the design of the Firefly class ships, the crew of Serenity, and how the series was make.  It was quite good and informative.If you liked Firefly then you'll really like this movie.My only wish is Firefly had been picked up by the Science Fiction channel and made into a series.  A replacement for some of their more elderly shows is badly needed.  But life isn't perfect.  That is why I liked this movie; it isn't perfect either.4 stars.  You'll like it.

The Firefly series was truly great; it has extremely high-level characters, acting and writing mixed with edge-of-your-seat action sequences. The only flaw was that it was cancelled much too soon. Without this movie, the series would have left the viewer hanging, with several vital plot twists left unresolved. This movie takes care of that. As others here have wisely pointed out, see this movie only AFTER watching the series. Then, after watching the last episode and feeling frustrated as all Firefly fans were, cue up this movie and watch the magic as Joss Whedon does a very satisfying job of wrapping it all up. It doesn't all resolve as I might have wanted it to--there is some tragedy here--but if you liked the series, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

Marold""","[1, 1]","With so many reviews, it is hard to imagine there is something I can say which has not already been said, except to add my vote to the chorus of five star reviews. The film is a strange mixture of Star Wars action / adventure and Blade Runner suspense. Lead character Malcolm Reynolds, played to a tee by Nathan Fillion, is far more the hard as nails Rick Deckard than he is the carefree Han Solo. He has strong loyalties to his crew and to those who help him in his shadowy half legal / half bandit role as an old fashioned highwayman of the 'verse (contraction for ""universe"").The heavy, an Alliance ""Operative"" has the determination of an unturned Terminator, who is a lot smarter and more wily than the humanoid androids (and smarter than the replicants of ""Blade Runner"", although the final fight between Reynolds and The Operative is vaguely reminiscent of the fight between Deckard and Roy Batty.The plot resolves two of the biggest questions arising out of the world of the ""Firefly"" series. Why are Alliance agents so intent of recovering control of the mysterious River Tam. The opening of the story proper (after a flashback on River's rescue) shows part of why she is so valuable. She is psychic, reliably. It doesn't come and go. It is not hit and miss. She saves the crew's bacon more than once by using that ability. The second question, not explored deeply in the series, is what is the origin of the ""Reavers"". It is hard to say more without giving away the surprise resolution.The special effects are primitive, and a lot of laws of physics are given too little attention, such as the famous problem of gravity while in outer space. Unlike the compulsively accurate Stanley Kubrick (or James Cameron), and like virtually everyone else, the problem is ignored. The space ship design would probably work in space, but it's ability to land from and take off to space, and fly in the atmosphere, seems quite improbable. But none of that seems to matter, because the story is so, so good.The cast is strong, and it is great to see Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame) in a role. Most of the characters have a depth to them, such as Adam Baldwin, who plays the heavy weapons toting ""Animal Mother"" character he created in ""Full Metal Jacket"", but his backstory (shown better in the movie than in the series) is delightful, as he regularly communicates with his mother. The most interesting is the triangle between Malcolm the captain, Zoe, his second in command, and her husband, Wash, the pilot. Zoe and Malcolm fought in the rebellion before Zoe met Wash, and there is sometimes a conflict between, command, duty, and loyalty.And... there are two of the most unusual fight scenes you will ever see... Can't say more about that.This is more than worth the cost of admission (whoever, the squeamish may cash in before the film is over.)",5,Should be rated among the best sci-fi movies,1369526400,"05 26, 2013",2013,2845,"['so', 'many', 'reviews', 'hard', 'imagine', 'something', 'can', 'say', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'add', 'vote', 'chorus', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'film', 'strange', 'mixture', 'Star', 'Wars', 'action', '/', 'adventure', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'suspense', 'Lead', 'character', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'tee', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'far', 'more', 'hard', 'nails', 'Rick', 'Deckard', 'carefree', 'Han', 'Solo', 'strong', 'loyalties', 'crew', 'who', 'help', 'shadowy', 'half', 'legal', '/', 'half', 'bandit', 'role', 'old', 'fashioned', 'highwayman', ""'verse"", 'contraction', 'universe', '.The', 'heavy', 'Alliance', 'Operative', 'determination', 'unturned', 'Terminator', 'who', 'lot', 'smarter', 'more', 'wily', 'humanoid', 'androids', 'smarter', 'replicants', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'final', 'fight', 'Reynolds', 'Operative', 'vaguely', 'reminiscent', 'fight', 'Deckard', 'Roy', 'Batty.The', 'plot', 'two', 'biggest', 'questions', 'arising', 'world', 'Firefly', 'series', 'Why', 'are', 'Alliance', 'agents', 'so', 'intent', 'recovering', 'control', 'mysterious', 'River', 'Tam', 'opening', 'story', 'proper', 'flashback', 'River', 'rescue', 'part', 'why', 'so', 'valuable', 'psychic', 'reliably', ""n't"", 'come', 'go', 'not', 'hit', 'miss', 'crew', 'bacon', 'more', 'once', 'using', 'ability', 'second', 'question', 'not', 'explored', 'deeply', 'series', 'what', 'origin', 'Reavers', 'hard', 'say', 'more', 'giving', 'away', 'surprise', 'resolution.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'primitive', 'lot', 'laws', 'physics', 'are', 'given', 'too', 'little', 'attention', 'such', 'famous', 'problem', 'gravity', 'outer', 'space', 'compulsively', 'accurate', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'James', 'Cameron', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'else', 'problem', 'ignored', 'space', 'ship', 'design', 'would', 'probably', 'work', 'space', 'ability', 'land', 'take', 'off', 'space', 'fly', 'atmosphere', 'quite', 'improbable', 'none', 'matter', 'story', 'so', 'good.The', 'cast', 'strong', 'great', 'see', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'fame', 'role', 'Most', 'characters', 'have', 'depth', 'such', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'heavy', 'weapons', 'toting', 'Animal', 'Mother', 'character', 'created', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'backstory', 'shown', 'better', 'movie', 'series', 'delightful', 'regularly', 'mother', 'most', 'interesting', 'triangle', 'Malcolm', 'captain', 'Zoe', 'second', 'command', 'husband', 'Wash', 'pilot', 'Zoe', 'Malcolm', 'fought', 'rebellion', 'Zoe', 'met', 'Wash', 'sometimes', 'conflict', 'command', 'duty', 'loyalty.And', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'unusual', 'fight', 'scenes', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'that.This', 'more', 'cost', 'admission', 'whoever', 'squeamish', 'may', 'cash', 'film']",N/A

Having said that, I firmly believe you needn't ever have seen the TV series to enjoy this movie.Even though most reviews have been positive, I'd like to start out by addressing the negative comments... The first is that it will only appeal to fans of the TV series. As stated above, I don't believe this to be the case and what little feedback I've heard from non-fans has borne out this assumption. Secondly, some have criticized the budget and FX. I'd argue that big budgets aren't necessary to a good SF movie and often get in the way (think George Lucas). In Serenity, there was only one scene, lasting maybe 2 seconds, where the CGI was clearly showing and not up to par, but I can forgive that. The important part is that the FX/CGI are in the service of the script, rather than the other way around.Finally, let's talk performances... One of the thing that people most liked about Firefly was the quality and coherence of the ensemble cast. Wisely (or maybe not - remember the meager budget), Whedon resisted the temptation to toss in a few expensive ""big names"" to punch up the box office. The cast still clicks like a well-oiled machine. The audience can respond to their cohesiveness. We easily believe this wildly disparate group of people actually care about  each other.*** Warning: Minor spoilers ahead ***More importantly, even the most reprehensible characters have redeeming qualities, dictated by their histories. There are no 2-dimensional good or evil characters. Each has multiple aspects and layers that helps us believe that they're real people rather than archetypes. We may not approve of all of them, all the time, but we do understand them.For far too long, SF films and TV has been focused on action and FX. Even many of the classics (e.g. 2001) are emotionally sterile. Where character development was pursued, I found it often difficult to really care about them (e.g. Blade Runner). While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand - even in their more questionable choices.I expect to see this at least twice more in the theater, and will then eagerly await the DVD release.Now, if they'd only make a Babylon 5 movie...",5,Great - accessible and character-driven,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,2331,"['First', 'readily', 'admit', ""'m"", 'Firefly', 'fan', 'not', 'Josh', 'Whedon', 'fan', 'Firefly', 'fan', 'Having', 'said', 'firmly', 'believe', 'need', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'enjoy', 'movie.Even', 'most', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'positive', ""'d"", 'like', 'start', 'out', 'addressing', 'negative', 'comments', 'first', 'will', 'only', 'appeal', 'fans', 'TV', 'series', 'stated', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'be', 'case', 'what', 'little', 'feedback', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'non-fans', 'borne', 'out', 'assumption', 'Secondly', 'have', 'criticized', 'budget', 'FX', ""'d"", 'argue', 'big', 'budgets', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'good', 'SF', 'movie', 'often', 'get', 'way', 'think', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Serenity', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'lasting', 'maybe', '2', 'seconds', 'where', 'CGI', 'was', 'clearly', 'showing', 'not', 'par', 'can', 'forgive', 'important', 'part', 'FX/CGI', 'are', 'service', 'script', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'around.Finally', 'let', 'talk', 'performances', 'One', 'thing', 'people', 'most', 'liked', 'Firefly', 'was', 'quality', 'coherence', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Wisely', 'maybe', 'not', 'remember', 'meager', 'budget', 'Whedon', 'resisted', 'temptation', 'toss', 'few', 'expensive', 'big', 'names', 'punch', 'up', 'box', 'office', 'cast', 'still', 'well-oiled', 'machine', 'audience', 'can', 'respond', 'cohesiveness', 'easily', 'believe', 'wildly', 'disparate', 'group', 'people', 'actually', 'care', 'other', '***', 'Warning', 'Minor', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '***More', 'importantly', 'even', 'most', 'reprehensible', 'characters', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'dictated', 'histories', 'are', '2-dimensional', 'good', 'evil', 'characters', 'multiple', 'aspects', 'layers', 'believe', ""'re"", 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'archetypes', 'may', 'not', 'approve', 'time', 'do', 'understand', 'them.For', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'SF', 'films', 'TV', 'been', 'focused', 'action', 'FX', 'Even', 'many', 'classics', 'e.g', '2001', 'are', 'emotionally', 'sterile', 'Where', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'pursued', 'found', 'often', 'difficult', 'really', 'care', 'e.g', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'sort', 'folks', ""'d"", 'seek', 'out', 'hang', 'are', 'people', 'could', 'respect', 'understand', 'even', 'more', 'questionable', 'choices.I', 'expect', 'see', 'least', 'twice', 'more', 'theater', 'will', 'then', 'eagerly', 'await', 'DVD', 'release.Now', ""'d"", 'only', 'make', 'Babylon', '5', 'movie']",N/A

Even if you have never seen the series this movie originated from it's ok as it's a great movie on it's own. The actors are mainly those from the original series with a couple additions that fit right in.The movie gets quite intense in a few areas and does keep you very much interested. I didn't want to pause it to take a break but did to kick a few people out of the house so I could watch in peace and continue to enjoy a well-done movie.It's a shame the series had to be canceled but that's show biz I guess. The movie was basically an ending to the entire series that could have easily gone for another couple of season. All in all it was a great movie that put a lot of information and action into a 2-hour movie.HD Video: 4.5 star, There are a couple of scenes that were a little grainy but for the most part the quality was exceptional.AUDIO: 4.5 stars, I use a 5.1 system and I caught myself looking around the room a couple times thinking a few cuss words as some sounds caught me off guard and made me look.

951058,A1TR0WPC93BEC8,B000BW7QWW,"Brendan L. Agnew ""rothwyn""","[8, 8]","""Nothing here is what it seems.""Science fiction just isn't what it used to be. Over the last couple decades, beginning a few years after George Lucas's Star Wars Trilogy came to a close, sci-fi started to get darker. With films like Blade Runner, Terminator, and Total Recall, dystopian or apocalyptic futures started to invade the genre, supplanting the romps and high-spirited adventuring styles of Buck Rogers and Luke Skywalker. More and more ""darker"" kinds of films like The Matrix, Minority Report and I, Robot became sci-fi staples, with space opera becoming an endangered species, even moreso with Lucas's new lifeless, awkward, lumbering ""vision"" of the Star Wars universe that was employed in the Prequel Trilogy.Fortunately, space opera was still alive and kicking, in the form of a prematurely cancelled TV series from the mind of Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel). FireFly launched in 2001, and after a series of idiotic scheduling decisions by Fox, the series was put to rest. However, a legion of fans and suprisingly high DVD sales caught the attention of the movie industry, and creator Whedon, not content to let his baby die, managed to get a movie in the works to finish the story that began on a small transport ship in the backwater of the 'verse.And in 2005, we got Serenity, and a reminder of what made movies like Star Wars a joy in the first place.Now, that doesn't mean that there's nothing dark about the movie; there are both laughs and cries aplenty here. The story of the faithless former soldier and current captain of the ship Serenity, Malcom Reynolds, and his ragtag crew certainly has its share of woe. His medic, Simon, Tam is a fugitive who is trying to keep his mentally unstable (and psychic) sister, River, from the watchful eyes of the totalitarian Alliance, which makes finding paying work (legal or otherwise) that much harder. His compatriots (some of whom qualify as friends) consist of a brilliant and lovestruck mechanic, Kaylee; his former second-in-command, Zoe; her husband and resident idiot-savant pilot, ""Wash""; Inara Senera the courtesan; Darial Book the preacher; and Jayne, a blue-collar killer who has the morals of a wolverine. Mal himself is a man who has lost his faith, and keeps fighting for survival simply to protect those he cares about.And yet, these characters, troubled though they are at times, are what makes this tale so incredible, and despite its tragedy, so uplifting and joyous. The story of their battles against the Alliance, the cold-hearted Operative sent to hunt them down, and the vicious Reavers, crazed cannibals drifting on the edges of the black, is full of fast-paced action, witty banter, and real, full characters that provide such a great emotional anchor that you geniunely care about the entire world (or worlds) they live in. While Serenity has its share of interstellar scraps and old-fashioned shootouts, it is the way the characters resonate with the audience that really makes it feel magical.With surprisingly skillfull camera work for a first-time movie director (thanks to help from technical veterans of movies like Mystic River), as well as more than a little help from David Newman's brilliant score, Serenity soars to new heights of the kind of emotion and entertainment that science fiction can offer. It's a tale of heroes and villains who are, in the end, just people; a story of sorrow, joy, victory, and belief. Nathan Fillion isn't Harrison Ford, and doesn't try to be (though he does a hell of a job of making his character shine), but like the original Star Wars, it's him, the actor and his co-workers and most importantly, their characters, that help Whedon's vision echo back to the glory of science fiction's past.It's what happens when you truly reach for the stars.",5,I aim to misbehave. . .,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,3795,"['Nothing', 'here', 'what', 'Science', 'fiction', 'just', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'last', 'couple', 'decades', 'beginning', 'few', 'years', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Trilogy', 'came', 'close', 'sci-fi', 'started', 'get', 'darker', 'films', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Terminator', 'Total', 'Recall', 'dystopian', 'apocalyptic', 'futures', 'started', 'invade', 'genre', 'supplanting', 'romps', 'high-spirited', 'adventuring', 'styles', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'More', 'more', 'darker', 'kinds', 'films', 'Matrix', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Robot', 'became', 'sci-fi', 'staples', 'space', 'opera', 'becoming', 'endangered', 'species', 'even', 'moreso', 'Lucas', 'new', 'lifeless', 'awkward', 'lumbering', 'vision', 'Star', 'Wars', 'universe', 'was', 'employed', 'Prequel', 'Trilogy.Fortunately', 'space', 'opera', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'kicking', 'form', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'TV', 'series', 'mind', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'FireFly', 'launched', '2001', 'series', 'idiotic', 'scheduling', 'decisions', 'Fox', 'series', 'was', 'put', 'rest', 'However', 'legion', 'fans', 'suprisingly', 'high', 'DVD', 'sales', 'caught', 'attention', 'movie', 'industry', 'creator', 'Whedon', 'not', 'content', 'let', 'baby', 'die', 'managed', 'get', 'movie', 'works', 'finish', 'story', 'began', 'small', 'transport', 'ship', 'backwater', ""'verse.And"", '2005', 'got', 'Serenity', 'reminder', 'what', 'made', 'movies', 'Star', 'Wars', 'joy', 'first', 'place.Now', ""n't"", 'mean', 'nothing', 'dark', 'movie', 'are', 'laughs', 'cries', 'aplenty', 'here', 'story', 'faithless', 'former', 'soldier', 'current', 'captain', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'Malcom', 'Reynolds', 'ragtag', 'crew', 'certainly', 'share', 'woe', 'medic', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'fugitive', 'who', 'trying', 'keep', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'psychic', 'sister', 'River', 'watchful', 'eyes', 'totalitarian', 'Alliance', 'finding', 'paying', 'work', 'legal', 'otherwise', 'much', 'harder', 'compatriots', 'whom', 'qualify', 'friends', 'consist', 'brilliant', 'lovestruck', 'mechanic', 'Kaylee', 'former', 'second-in-command', 'Zoe', 'husband', 'resident', 'idiot-savant', 'pilot', 'Wash', 'Inara', 'Senera', 'courtesan', 'Darial', 'Book', 'preacher', 'Jayne', 'blue-collar', 'killer', 'who', 'morals', 'wolverine', 'Mal', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'fighting', 'survival', 'simply', 'protect', 'about.And', 'yet', 'characters', 'troubled', 'are', 'times', 'are', 'what', 'tale', 'so', 'incredible', 'tragedy', 'uplifting', 'joyous', 'story', 'battles', 'Alliance', 'cold-hearted', 'Operative', 'sent', 'hunt', 'down', 'vicious', 'Reavers', 'crazed', 'cannibals', 'drifting', 'edges', 'black', 'full', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'witty', 'banter', 'real', 'full', 'characters', 'provide', 'great', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'geniunely', 'care', 'entire', 'world', 'worlds', 'live', 'Serenity', 'share', 'interstellar', 'scraps', 'old-fashioned', 'shootouts', 'way', 'characters', 'resonate', 'audience', 'really', 'feel', 'magical.With', 'surprisingly', 'skillfull', 'camera', 'work', 'first-time', 'movie', 'director', 'thanks', 'help', 'technical', 'veterans', 'movies', 'Mystic', 'River', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'little', 'help', 'David', 'Newman', 'brilliant', 'score', 'Serenity', 'new', 'heights', 'kind', 'emotion', 'entertainment', 'science', 'fiction', 'can', 'offer', 'tale', 'heroes', 'villains', 'who', 'are', 'end', 'just', 'people', 'story', 'sorrow', 'joy', 'victory', 'belief', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', ""n't"", 'Harrison', 'Ford', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'hell', 'job', 'making', 'character', 'shine', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'actor', 'co-workers', 'most', 'importantly', 'characters', 'help', 'Whedon', 'vision', 'back', 'glory', 'science', 'fiction', 'past.It', 'what', 'when', 'truly', 'reach', 'stars']",N/A

For those who don't know, this film is based on the well made but short lived FOX series ""Firefly.""The movie centers on a band of misfits leaving on the edge of society and the law: There is the ship's captain Malcolm Reynolds, who was a soldier on the losing end of a civil war;  His comrade and first mate Zoey and her pilot husband Wash; The Shepherd (preacher) Book who has a mysterious past;  The beautiful Companion Inara, the untrustworthy mercenary Jayne, the ship's doctor Simon and his gifted and disturbed sister River round out the crew.  When River's past catches up with the crew, they are pitted against a nameless, relentless and implacable enemy in the form of the Operative, a agent of the Alliance government whose only mission is to kill River whatever it takes. This leads them over the edge of society and they are forced to find and confront the secret that River holds, and that may be more dangerous than the Operative.If you have not seen the Firefly series and are a Sci Fi fan, you will enjoy this movie.

The emotional impact of several scenes is so intense it was hard to stay seated (a crash landing sequence can almost give you motion sickness). This brings a satisfying end to the storyline the original series had started. It's a shame the show never got to tell this story in its entirety.

951067,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000BW7QWW,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 2]",In the short lived Fox TV series Firefly Joss Whedon created an interesting new world 500 years in the future that was a mixture of outer space adventure and the post Civil War old West. He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14. In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself. An assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find her and bring her back at all costs.Without spoilers that is the premise of the film. The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself. Also available are numerous featurettes; some outtakes and deleted and extended scenes.This may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well.

By backdrop, I mean that the technology wasn't the story, it was merely a support aspect of the story.  There was no bouncing an energy beam off the deflector dish to save the day or slingshotting your space craft around the sun to travel in time.  The Sci-Fi was as comfortably placed in the world of Serenity / Firefly as your microwave oven is in real life.Serenity came about because Joss, the cast and crew, and the fans would not let such a special story die.The movie allowed Joss to write a deeper story than he could have within the limits of a television series.  Serenity is deeper, darker, and more emotionally impacting than even Firefly was.Even the villian has a good reason for being a villian.  He's not two dimensional.  The character was well written and well performed.  You couldn't help but to admire and hate the guy in one thought.The hero, Captain Mal Reynolds, had to learn a lesson.  He had to regain his faith.  In the series, we learned that he lost his hope and faith after losing the war for freedom from oppression.The Firefly/Serenity story is one of individual struggle, freedom, and life.

There's no question that that kind of stuff can cause an adrenaline rush, and be entertaining. From my perspective, however, that's all there was, a handful of folks on a beat up space ship trying to escape with a fugitive from the home planet. Dense as I am, I wasn't sure why the dude chasing our heroes wanted the wisp of a 17 year old girl that they were ferrying around the universe. Of course she did provide some of the excitement what with her copying scenes from Matrix where she fights a large crowd of drooling maniacs and lays them all out on the ground dead or dying.There really is no depth to this movie. It's just a space opera. If you are satisfied with that well then you can give it five stars, but it wasn't enough for me.One thing that puzzled me. When we see the crew walking around the space ship you see all sorts of loose equipment and furnishings. Then when you see the outside of the ship while it is taking off you see it going through an amazing number of spins and loops.

951079,A3536O3S8N11VU,B000BW7QWW,Carlos Teran,"[8, 10]","America (and most of the world) has a romance with the ones who lose, the underdogs, the fighters of lost causes with a true merit of their own. Firefly was a very short-lived TV series that was based on one basic premise: the world in the future, will be just about the same, but with fancier technology. The show was well-written, with inteligent (but somewhat naive) plots and very decent visual effects. Firefly wasn't a big-names show, as for most of the actors, this was their really big break... and they got cancelled. So again, the underdog motif is lingering around.Let pass some years. Firefly has a huge fan-base that rivals that one of Star Trek and Star Wars. In some ways, even more dedicated, because just a season isn't much to brag about and they had to build their own fandom around the Firefly universe and mythos. So, the dedication of those fans and Josh Whedon (a true underdog by all means) gave birth to Serenity, about the only movie based on a cancelled TV series, not made with footage pieces of the series. Raw, new material for the browncoats around the world.The spawn of such devotion is a true quality product. Good acting, an intelligent script (in some poetic ways, above average for a Sci-Fi movie) and better visual effects than the actual TV show (created by Zoic, of Battlestar Galactica and Children Of Dune fame). Unlike many Star Trek movies (and I'm myself an avid ST fan), Serenity doesn't feel like a feature-lenght episode at all. About the only flaw that can be found in this product is that it needs an in-depth knowledge of the TV series. This movie isn't for the casual viewer without a Firefly Boxed Set at hand.Regarding the DVD itself, the extras are less than expected, with the director's commentary about the only pleasant surprise in this DVD. I wonder if a 2 discs set would have been any better than this.It's sad that this movie did not-so-well at the box-office, but that's because the lack of support from the studio and the awful timing for the release. Such as Firefly, it deserved better.My advise would be: buy it. You'll get an excellent story, packed with action and stunning visuals. You won't regret it.

Serenity keeps all the heart, all the dazzle, all the strength of the Firefly series, while adding the sort of sparkle that a feature film needs. ""Browncoats"" and newcomers alike can enjoy this; I came to it in theatres not knowing anything about the series, but I was instantly captivated. One can only hope that interest in Serenity will revive faith in Whedon and demand for the story in some form.The story itself is wildly entertaining. Whedon drops the viewer into a world that is ours. For all it's set five hundred years in the future, it's still just people, it's still all the fancies and foibles of life. He creates a true ""space western"" with the sort of energy and liveliness not seen since the original Star Wars trilogy - and he does it with better dialogue, and less focus on flashy special effects. Each character is engaging; every member of the Serenity crew is someone you want to know personally. You want to sign on with Captain Reynolds and throw yourself into danger with him and the rest of the crew. The dialogue is very natural, and unexpected. Whedon makes you think he's going to use typical sci-fi conventions, and then shatters them entirely, undercutting the tension with a quick quip, or having a typically flippant character say something profound without losing his mannerisms. But most of all, the movie makes you feel. You connect, you love... you ache for more when it's over.The special features, incidentally, are also delightful. I'm not someone who usually spends hours watching bonus features on DVDs, but I sat straight through all of these. The deleted scenes are treasures, and Whedon's commentary on them is fascinating, and all of the featurettes showing Whedon and the cast and crew are so heartfelt and so entertaining.

But, after writing the analysis, I realized it basically expressed my feelings about the movie equal or better than any review could, so without further delay, here is my review/analysis of Serenity...Reasons why you should like Serenity...1). The cast. They are, in short, fantastic. Not particularly because of acting ability alone - though I'm not saying they're bad actors - but chemistry. They fit with each other, and play off each other, SO well you just literally fall in love with all of them. I harken their chemistry to the original Star Wars cast's; they fit so well together, you really begin to care about them, and it all seems so believable.2). The dialogue. Okay, I'll say it; Whedon writes campy, corny dialogue. BUT! who says campy and corny is bad if done well? Whedon does it well, and it shows. Plenty of memorable quotes, plenty of fun lines that have you chuckling in even the most dire of scenes, it's just excellent, I think.3). The universe Whedon has created is, at least, creative - and may even be even magnificent if not for some failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2). The merging of cultures and customs is very interesting, and believable, and the whole Han Solo meets Wild Wild West in China is really unique and likeable.4). The action and special effects are quite good. It's not World of the Worlds of King Kong, but it's very strong for a film of this budget and scale, and despite, again, a few failings (see; reasons you shouldn't like this movie #2...and a lil bit o' #1), it's very entertaining.And as an added bonus, reasons why you SHOULDN'T like the movie...1). The plot. It's very, very...blah. A problem that I had with the show continues in the film; all they do is run. They run to this planet, they run to that planet. They're running from this person, they're running from that person. After a while it becomes quite boring and monotonous.2). The sorta ""cheap"" feel of it all. Again, this is a problem I had with both Buffy and Firefly; Whedon doesn't seem to know how to make things look...good, or ""rich"" at least. Everything seems to sorta have this ""made for TV"" quality to it. From dim lighting to set design, it all didn't seem very much like a feature film, or for that matter, real.3). A mediocre villain. That's right; Serenity has one. While I'm sure Chiwetel Ejiofor did his very best playing the intimidating and power ""Operative,"" he just didn't really seem to have the presence all true great villains have; that Darth Vader-like dread you feel whenever he walks into a shot - that just wasn't there, sadly. He is a fair villain, I mean, he goes through all the motions well, and does what he has to do, but The Operative simply isn't a great villain, and while this doesn't necessarily hurt the film, it certainly doesn't help it.Overall, however, I do think the positives outweigh the negatives by quite a good margin - and Serenity is quite a good film. I think the most important thing though - in watching any movie - is don't go in with sky high expectations, don't go in with your head full of things these crazy Whedon worshippers are saying, go in hoping for an enjoyable film. And, hopefully, you will enjoy it, and with luck, you'll come out having seen a film that you, dare I say, love.Personally, I didn't ""love"" it, but still, it gets a solid 4.5/5 from me.",5,"Serenity: box office failure, creative success",1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,3512,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'wording', 'tone', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'odd', 'originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'review', 'post', 'popular', 'movie', 'discussion', 'board', 'writing', 'analysis', 'realized', 'basically', 'expressed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'equal', 'better', 'review', 'could', 'so', 'further', 'delay', 'here', 'review/analysis', 'Serenity', 'Reasons', 'why', 'should', 'like', 'Serenity', '1', 'cast', 'are', 'short', 'fantastic', 'Not', 'particularly', 'acting', 'ability', 'alone', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""'re"", 'bad', 'actors', 'chemistry', 'fit', 'other', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'SO', 'well', 'just', 'literally', 'fall', 'love', 'harken', 'chemistry', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'cast', 'fit', 'so', 'well', 'together', 'really', 'begin', 'care', 'so', 'believable.2', 'dialogue', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'say', 'Whedon', 'campy', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'BUT', 'who', 'campy', 'corny', 'bad', 'done', 'well', 'Whedon', 'well', 'Plenty', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'plenty', 'fun', 'lines', 'have', 'chuckling', 'even', 'most', 'dire', 'scenes', 'just', 'excellent', 'think.3', 'universe', 'Whedon', 'created', 'least', 'creative', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'even', 'magnificent', 'not', 'failings', 'see', 'reasons', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', '2', 'merging', 'cultures', 'customs', 'very', 'interesting', 'believable', 'whole', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'China', 'really', 'unique', 'likeable.4', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'World', 'Worlds', 'King', 'Kong', 'very', 'strong', 'film', 'budget', 'scale', 'again', 'few', 'failings', 'see', 'reasons', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', '2', 'lil', 'bit', 'o', '1', 'very', 'entertaining.And', 'added', 'bonus', 'reasons', 'why', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'movie', '1', 'plot', 'very', 'very', 'blah', 'problem', 'had', 'show', 'film', 'do', 'run', 'run', 'planet', 'run', 'planet', ""'re"", 'running', 'person', ""'re"", 'running', 'person', 'while', 'quite', 'boring', 'monotonous.2', 'sorta', 'cheap', 'feel', 'Again', 'problem', 'had', 'Buffy', 'Firefly', 'Whedon', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'things', 'look', 'good', 'rich', 'least', 'Everything', 'sorta', 'have', 'made', 'TV', 'quality', 'dim', 'lighting', 'set', 'design', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'much', 'feature', 'film', 'matter', 'real.3', 'mediocre', 'villain', 'right', 'Serenity', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'did', 'very', 'best', 'playing', 'intimidating', 'power', 'Operative', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'have', 'presence', 'true', 'great', 'villains', 'have', 'Darth', 'Vader-like', 'dread', 'feel', 'whenever', 'shot', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'sadly', 'fair', 'villain', 'mean', 'motions', 'well', 'what', 'do', 'Operative', 'simply', ""n't"", 'great', 'villain', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'hurt', 'film', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'help', 'it.Overall', 'however', 'do', 'think', 'positives', 'outweigh', 'negatives', 'quite', 'good', 'margin', 'Serenity', 'quite', 'good', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'watching', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'sky', 'high', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'head', 'full', 'things', 'crazy', 'Whedon', 'worshippers', 'are', 'saying', 'go', 'hoping', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'hopefully', 'will', 'enjoy', 'luck', ""'ll"", 'come', 'out', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'dare', 'say', 'love.Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'still', 'solid', '4.5/5']",N/A

Miles,"[3, 3]","I must respectfully disagree with some of my fellow reviewers and say that you do not under any circumstance need to have seen the short lived television series `Firefly' to enjoy, or understand its feature film continuation `Serenity'. I was never a huge fan of `Buffy the Vampire Slayer' but I had always heard great things about all of the Joss Whedon penned series, and since `Firefly' was canceled so quickly I never got a chance to sample it either. However, when I signed up for one of the on-line video rental services, I added `Serenity' to my queue. It arrived, and with little expectation I popped it in the old DVD player and sat down for what I thought would be your typical run of the mill sci-fi / action movie. I was hooked from the opening sequence, and decided by the time the movie was over that I had to own it. Not only do I own my own DVD copy, I also stop to watch it every time it shows up on cable. Obviously, I don't expect you to enjoy it as much as I did, but please don't be scared off by the sci-fi premise. It is not a typical CGI, special effects laden movie, this is a rarity in Hollywood these days; an actual story, with deep, meaningful characters that you really care about.Serenity is the name of a decaying freighter, home to Captain Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds and his peculiar crew comprised of a faithful soldier, her pilot husband, a mechanic, a ruthless mercenary, a doctor and his traumatized sister, one of whom carries a secret that will cost them all dearly. As the Captain and crew attempt to avoid detection from the oppressive government know as the Alliance, a government agent known only as an Operative has been dispatched to recover this secret or cover it up, and he will stop at nothing to complete his mission. A deadly game of cat and mouse between the wily Captain Reynolds and the dangerous Operative ensues, and soon many innocent lives hang in the balance.What really makes this movie unique is not only the first rate dialog (a Joss Whedon staple), but a plot that never becomes predictable. As the antihero, Captain Reynolds (played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion) seldom does anything you expect him to do, but always manages to make things interesting.As I said earlier, I had never seen the television show that inspired the motion picture, but after seeing `Serenity' multiple times, I did purchase the entire `Firefly"" series, which I enjoyed as much if not even more than I did the movie. If you are an action/adventure fan I really think you will like this movie, and if you are even a fringe sci-fi fan, this is one you will want to check out. My wife, my 19 year old daughter, and my 7 year old son all loved this movie; I am guessing you will too.",4,"A really good movie, don't overlook it.",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2716,"['must', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'fellow', 'reviewers', 'say', 'do', 'not', 'circumstance', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'short', 'lived', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'feature', 'film', 'continuation', 'Serenity', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'penned', 'series', 'Firefly', 'was', 'canceled', 'so', 'quickly', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'sample', 'However', 'when', 'signed', 'up', 'one', 'on-line', 'video', 'rental', 'services', 'added', 'Serenity', 'queue', 'arrived', 'little', 'expectation', 'popped', 'old', 'DVD', 'player', 'sat', 'down', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'run', 'mill', 'sci-fi', '/', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'hooked', 'opening', 'sequence', 'decided', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'own', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'own', 'own', 'DVD', 'copy', 'also', 'stop', 'watch', 'time', 'up', 'cable', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'off', 'sci-fi', 'premise', 'not', 'typical', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'movie', 'rarity', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'actual', 'story', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'really', 'care', 'about.Serenity', 'name', 'decaying', 'freighter', 'home', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'peculiar', 'crew', 'comprised', 'faithful', 'soldier', 'pilot', 'husband', 'mechanic', 'ruthless', 'mercenary', 'doctor', 'traumatized', 'sister', 'one', 'whom', 'secret', 'will', 'cost', 'dearly', 'Captain', 'crew', 'attempt', 'avoid', 'detection', 'oppressive', 'government', 'know', 'Alliance', 'government', 'agent', 'known', 'only', 'Operative', 'been', 'dispatched', 'recover', 'secret', 'cover', 'up', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'complete', 'mission', 'deadly', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'wily', 'Captain', 'Reynolds', 'dangerous', 'Operative', 'ensues', 'soon', 'many', 'innocent', 'lives', 'hang', 'balance.What', 'really', 'movie', 'unique', 'not', 'only', 'first', 'rate', 'dialog', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'staple', 'plot', 'never', 'predictable', 'antihero', 'Captain', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'seldom', 'anything', 'expect', 'do', 'always', 'make', 'things', 'interesting.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'television', 'show', 'inspired', 'motion', 'picture', 'seeing', 'Serenity', 'multiple', 'times', 'did', 'purchase', 'entire', 'Firefly', 'series', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'even', 'more', 'did', 'movie', 'are', 'action/adventure', 'fan', 'really', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'even', 'fringe', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'wife', '19', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '7', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'guessing', 'will', 'too']",N/A

951094,A17ZP3VKZ4QRWT,B000BW7QWW,Charlie Brooks,"[0, 0]","Serenity is billed as a stand-alone movie, but it is really a conclusion of the television series Firefly, which met with premature cancellation thanks to some bad decision making by Fox. The film reintroduces the characters from the series and ties up several of the loose ends that were left at the end of the last episode, specifically the troubled psychic River and her flight from the Alliance.If you've watched and enjoyed the TV series, then Serenity is for you. The movie has the same interesting characters, wonderful universe, and mix of tragedy and humor that appealed to television audiences. I will warn you that this is a conclusion -- a farewell to the Firefly Universe -- and therefore has a sense of finality and change to it. Be prepared to face some real tragedies and tough moments as these characters finish the adventure of their lives.The film is somewhat accessible to people who aren't familiar with the TV series, but it does have its flaws to a fresh audience. The characters are very detailed, but only the surface gets scratched in this movie. While Joss Whedon provided enough of a backstory to help newcomers understand what is going on, a lot of the subtleties will be lost on people who didn't see the 13-episode run on television. Additionally, the circumstances that the characters face won't seem as grave to someone who hasn't grown to love the setting.Overall, this film is an excellent sendoff to a series that was canceled before its time. If you didn't watch Firefly, however, I would suggest checking out the DVD box set of that series first.

An imaginative idea, a well written script with a mix of action, emotion and humor and a good cast to carry it all off.Serenity is the name of a ship with a crew of semi-outlaws who have been protecting a doctor and his young sister River who is telepathic and has been severely damaged psychologically by the Alliance as they used behavior modification to turn her into a weapon. The crew is about to let her and her brother behind because they have become a hindrance, when they get a look at what she can do. She is subliminally induced into another state and proceeds to beat the living crap out of a room full of men in a bar. Before going into her fighting state she said the word ""Miranda"". They find out Miranda is a planet and decide they must go there and discover the secret behind what the Alliance is doing. To do this they must get through the Reavers, humans that have gone mad and become cannibals. Add to this an assassin from the Alliance who is tracking them to get the girl back to continue their experiments on her.Serenity is exciting, funny and beautiful to look at. It takes little time for the movie to draw you into its world and have you care about the crew and what happens to them.

The movie features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.

951103,A3TTKMUH9REXNH,B000BW7QWW,"Christopher Perry ""Azazel2099""","[0, 0]","Firefly is a geat show. Serenity is a fitting and awesome conclusion to this story. 1st the characters/actors are awesome. Each actor has had or currently owns a major role in a television/movie. Nathon Fillion is the main character he is currently on the show Castle. Kalee, Jewel Staite, was also on the show Stargate Atlantis for a awhile. Also, lets not forget Joss Whedon himself, if you liked the new Avenger's movie then you should like this show for they are both his work. My point is the cast is strong, so the comments on bad writing and acting is unfounded. As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage. Lastly, after this show was cancelled, unjustly, this show had a ""HUGE"" fan base. So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did. The Full length film finishing the Firefly series is called ""Serenity"" and currently holds a 4 1/2 star rating here on Amazon out of 1800 + reviews and was rated a 7.9 on IMDB out of 143,000 people.Let me explain the Western aspect and the Chinese influence to this show for those people who might find merrit in this argument. Joss Whedon doesn't just come out and say it in this show he wants the viewer to watch and come to their own understanding of why modern society in Firely has a Chinese and old western style to it. Most of Frefly's fans understand it but for those who don't let me explain...nerd moment beware....In this show Earth is no more or if there are people still on it, its a LOOOONG ways away. The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China. When they settled on their new worlds they formed an Alliance. This is why you see and hear people in Firefly wearing chinese clothing and speaking Chinese while still using English as their base language. Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it. Lastly the western feel to the story, Joss Whedon actually explained this in the show better then the Chinese part alot better, you just have to pay attention. In the Pilot episode they clearly state that after the Alliance TERRAFORMS a world they throw settlers on them with almost no resources and a few small herds and minor supplies. This is why the show has a Western Feel to it, the inner Alliance Core worlds are the Metropolitan mega cities you might be expecting in a Sci-fi show which appear later in the series while the outer rim worlds have the desolate wild west aspect. That is the story plot for the western feel to the story. However, I suspect budget played into this part aswell. Almost every TV show out there costs several million dollars just to air one episode, so the production costs of creating a futuristic city in every episode or space battles and what not probably would be to costly from a producers stand point. The movie Serenity makes up for the lack of production restraints in Firefly and spares no expense when it comes to CGI effects and scenery.",5,Fitting End to Firefly!!!,1339286400,"06 10, 2012",2012,3283,"['Firefly', 'geat', 'show', 'Serenity', 'fitting', 'awesome', 'conclusion', 'story', '1st', 'characters/actors', 'are', 'awesome', 'actor', 'had', 'currently', 'major', 'role', 'television/movie', 'Nathon', 'Fillion', 'main', 'character', 'currently', 'show', 'Castle', 'Kalee', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'was', 'also', 'show', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'awhile', 'Also', 'not', 'forget', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'liked', 'new', 'Avenger', 'movie', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'show', 'are', 'work', 'point', 'cast', 'strong', 'comments', 'bad', 'writing', 'acting', 'unfounded', 'Western', 'aspect', 'movie', 'well', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'western', 'feel', 'touch', 'Chinese', 'heritage', 'Lastly', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'unjustly', 'show', 'had', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'base', 'So', 'much', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'had', 'grounds', 'finish', 'series', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'did', 'Full', 'length', 'film', 'finishing', 'Firefly', 'series', 'called', 'Serenity', 'currently', '4', '1/2', 'star', 'rating', 'here', 'Amazon', '1800', '+', 'reviews', 'was', 'rated', '7.9', 'IMDB', '143,000', 'people.Let', 'explain', 'Western', 'aspect', 'Chinese', 'influence', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'find', 'merrit', 'argument', 'Joss', 'Whedon', ""n't"", 'just', 'come', 'out', 'say', 'show', 'viewer', 'watch', 'come', 'own', 'understanding', 'why', 'modern', 'society', 'Firely', 'Chinese', 'old', 'western', 'style', 'Most', 'Frefly', 'fans', 'understand', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'explain', 'nerd', 'moment', 'beware', 'show', 'Earth', 'more', 'are', 'people', 'still', 'LOOOONG', 'ways', 'away', 'Alliance', 'major', 'power', 'Firefly', 'what', 'understand', 'Allaince', 'comprised', 'were', 'remnants', 'Earth', 'western', 'powers', 'United', 'States/Great', 'Britain', 'China', 'When', 'settled', 'new', 'worlds', 'formed', 'Alliance', 'why', 'see', 'hear', 'people', 'Firefly', 'wearing', 'chinese', 'clothing', 'speaking', 'Chinese', 'still', 'using', 'English', 'base', 'language', 'Inara', 'who', 'companion', 'great', 'example', 'almost', 'always', 'wearing', 'gown', 'Chinese', 'oriental', 'style', 'Lastly', 'western', 'feel', 'story', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'actually', 'explained', 'show', 'better', 'then', 'Chinese', 'part', 'alot', 'better', 'just', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'clearly', 'state', 'Alliance', 'TERRAFORMS', 'world', 'throw', 'settlers', 'almost', 'resources', 'few', 'small', 'herds', 'minor', 'supplies', 'why', 'show', 'Western', 'Feel', 'inner', 'Alliance', 'Core', 'worlds', 'are', 'Metropolitan', 'mega', 'cities', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'Sci-fi', 'show', 'appear', 'later', 'series', 'outer', 'rim', 'worlds', 'have', 'desolate', 'wild', 'west', 'aspect', 'story', 'plot', 'western', 'feel', 'story', 'However', 'suspect', 'budget', 'played', 'part', 'aswell', 'TV', 'show', 'there', 'several', 'million', 'dollars', 'just', 'air', 'one', 'episode', 'production', 'costs', 'creating', 'futuristic', 'city', 'episode', 'space', 'battles', 'what', 'not', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'costly', 'producers', 'stand', 'point', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'up', 'lack', 'production', 'restraints', 'Firefly', 'expense', 'when', 'CGI', 'effects', 'scenery']",N/A

What does it mean to believe?  What is the power of belief?

951108,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000BW7QWW,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 4]","There are essentially 3 people that will watch this film: 1) the so-called ""Browncoats"", huge fans of the show Firefly and who probably campaigned to save the show after it was cancelled after 11 of the 14 episodes air. 2)People like me that saw a couple of Firefly episodes but either didn't watch enough to be a fan or are a fan but haven't watched the entire thing and became group number 1. 3) non-fans of anything Firefly related and merely saw it out of trailer interest or store browsing. Well as part of group #2, I can say that it's quite the film although you might be lost on certain things.In the future, Earth became too populated so we branched out. America and China formed to become one big superpower(Amerina? Chirica?) and formed the Alliance featuring other central planets. They also are hunting the Tams, brother/sister duo Simon and River although more specifically River who was engineered to be quite efficient at killing. They both ends up on the ship Serenity.On this ship are quite a crew of characters: captain Mal, husband and wife Wash and Zoe, engineer Kaylee, main muscle Jayne and also returning are preacher Shepherd Book and ""companion"" Inara(she's similar to a geisha I believe, an artisan entertainer rather than a whore). So the entire team is trying to solve the mystery of why the Alliance are after River and also avoiding them and Reavers, primitive people who love to eat/rape people.The first Star Wars trilogy left such a mark on cinema because it had funny moments as well as drama and action. Lately though the recent trilogy has a feeling of ""talk talk talk, action, talk talk talk and by the way look at our awesome effects"". Well Serenity is well-done as it contains many funny dialogue, moments of character and even some well-designed action sequences including an early chase scene in the valley.What might be disorienting to people is the fact that the film assumes people watching Serenity have watched Firefly so they continue on characters where you're like ""whoa, who's he?"" such as when Book shows up. But since the movie was written(and demanded I might add) by the fans, the ""Browncoats"", it's obvious they're didn't need to be any episode recap such as the X-Files film.Compared to special features, this release is a little bare. While I am recommend a purchase, I am most likely thinking there will be a 2 disc edition with a whole bunch of goodies.

951113,A39LRLKACX89IP,B000BW7QWW,Courtland J. Carpenter,"[18, 21]","I guess movie promotion is a science in itself.  You'd think Universal would have learned the lessons of how this series failed on TV.  Joss is a great storyteller and script writer, but this is twice he's had some marginal clout, and not acted in the interest of his product.  You can't just get caught up in the dreams of the fanbase.  They are by definition, fanatics, it does not always translate into ticket sales.  Now, lets get onto the movie review.First, we need a bit of needed background information for non-fans of the series.  This movie is based on the short-lived, but fantastic tv show, Firefly.  Created by Joss Whedon, of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fame.  He was looking to create a post American civil war type of story, moving the setting into futuristic space.  Sometimes described as a western in space show, it's really a fairly logical speculation on how man would begin to settle, and terra form other planets.  Joss does not believe in ""little green men"" so there are no alien types in his universe, that in itself is  one of the more unique elements, which serve make the series, and movie, something special.I'd heard some disturbing things initially on how they were gonna make this movie. It sounded like they were gonna redo the pilot, so as not to lose viewers who hadn't seen the series.  I think they chose wisely for fans of the series. Unfortunately, I can't help but think they maybe needed a little beginning film narrative.  Perhaps few flashbacks, to bring non-series viewers up to speed. The story line here begins after the series plot arc, and sometime beyond.  Two former crew members (sort of) are staying off ship, each with their own reasons.Joss Whedon must have reviewed the episodes in Firefly, and thought he had a good villain type from the episode ""Objects in Space"".  I really think the main ""bad guy"" in this one was based on the character ""Early"", who matched wits with River, and lost in one of the last episodes shown on TV. Some of the implied violence, killings done by the Alliance, and its chosen henchman, killer, was a bit over the top.  It didn't ring true, because it was not justified.  I think Joss could have done better.  He was looking at a cerebral type of assassin, I don't think mass murder would be ""his"" solution.  Some of the most ""scary"" characters from the series were the black suited men that came after River in the hospital robbery episode.  I think the reprise of those guys, would have had a greater impact to the story.Joss brought a little of Buffy in this movie to the character, River Tam.  Buffy fans, watch for a classic weapon pose, stare, at the end of a long fight scene, which occurs late in the movie. The film has taken some heat over the elimination of some main characters.  This is science fiction, so is anyone really ever dead.  If they need them back there are a number of ways to do it, and I think the deaths were necessary to the story line.  If not for death number one, it would be hard to personalize the killings in the name of finding River.  Later death(s) were abrupt, maybe too much so for fans, but it helped give a sense of reality to the final battles. (Possible Spoiler next)At one point it looked as if any or all of the main cast could die, something that rarely happens in an ensemble cast. You really had the suspicion that Joss might just have believed this movie was a one shot deal, and was going to move on to bigger, better projects! I do like the fact that they got all of the cast involved, in an all too short movie.  This resolved, or at least partially resolved a lot of the loose ends in the series.As a stand alone Science Fiction action movie, with good dialog, story, and action. Its hard to believe this movie didn't manage to pick up some momentum in the theaters. I can only speculate the movie just didn't appeal to movie audiences on some level.  The title may have hurt it, almost as much as the lack of promotion.  Going in a movie like this coming out well after Star Wars III, and War of the Worlds, then six weeks ahead of the latest Harry Potter should have had the movie ticket buyers largely to itself.  It didn't happen.I can't speak for the DVD yet, but I'd buy the wide-screen version, there are many scenes that would lose something without it.  I believe fans will buy this DVD in droves, but if you are a movie fan of good story, good dialog, and even good action, you should buy this film.  In a different time with the right kind of promotion, this film could have launched a new space genre much like Trek or Star Wars.  It is unfair to compare them head to head, but in a lot of ways this is just as good, and often better.",4,Terrific Film was largely unnoticed by the general populus in theaters.,1132876800,"11 25,

951116,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000BW7QWW,Craig Matteson,"[9, 10]","This is a movie I enjoyed a lot more than I expected I would.  Joss Whedon has a thing for telling stories about very small women, girls really, doing really big things.  It is not unlike Buffy in its broad gesture, but very different in its specifics.  Like most space stories it is really a story that would have been a sea story a hundred years ago.  The characters even refer to their spaceship as a boat.  Being a space story of some indefinite time period allows for everything to be more extreme and even disorienting.The broad range of characters from the half-crazed waif, River, and her doctor brother, to the boat's motley crew, through the seemingly invincible ""operative"", to the Reavers themselves there is a lot to notice and enjoy.  Nathan Fillion as the boat's captain does the hero's job quite well while Summer Glau fill's the River role with all the insanity and power the role demands.  Whedon shoots her face at all kinds of very odd angles to play up strangeness and mystery.There are several love interests in the story all of a different kind of love.  We have the husband and wife love between Zoe (weapons officer) and Wash (the great pilot), then the brother and sister devotional love of Simon (the doctor) and River (Glau), and the new romance love developing between Simon and Kayee (Jewell Staite).  And what about the weird relationship between ""Mr. Universe"" (David Krumholtz) and his lovebot?  Of course, there is some kind of relationship between Captain Mal and Inara as well.The payoff of the movie is pretty good, if not particularly subtle.

951123,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,B000BW7QWW,Crystal Starr Light,"[12, 15]","You can't really review ""Serenity"" without spending a wee bit of time talking aboutFirefly - The Complete Series.  ""Firefly"" was, in short, an amazing cancelled TV series.  It was a cross between Westerns and Scifi, what I've heard called numerous times ""Han Solo in the Old West"".  You had this cast of characters that was downright superb.  Mal was the captain, bitter from losing a war in Serenity Valley and secretly having feelings for Inara, the on-ship Companion who often uses her esteemed status to get the crew out of capers.  Zoe is his second-in-command, a fairly emotionless woman who doesn't hesitate following orders.  Wash, Zoe's husband, is the pilot, goofy, wise-cracking, and adoring his wife.  Jayne thinks about himself and isn't terribly brilliant.  Kaylee is the sweet mechanic who wants to be ravaged in bed by the attractive doctor, Simon, who in turned left a life of plenty to rescue his sister, River, from being experimented on.  Lastly, we have Shepherd Book, a man of God who is somehow living with these criminals and not abiding in his monastery.Unfortunately, the producers didn't see the magic of ""Firefly"" and canceled the series.  However, Joss Whedon, the man behind this brainchild, was given the chance to catapult his dream onto the big screen--a big deal for a full-fledged series, much, much bigger for a series canceled before finishing its first season.The story of ""Serenity"" is basically tying the loose ends from the TV series.  Simon took River away from a lab where they were turning her into a psychic assassin.  But now, the Parliament has sent a man known only as the Operative after her, to bring her back.  Because River knows secrets...secrets that are about to get the crew of Serenity in very serious trouble.The first time I watched it, I watched ""Serenity"" without seeing the TV series first, and, while I still enjoyed it, it was terribly confusing.  You spend the better part of half the movie trying to catch up.  Then, I purchased ""Firefly"", watched the entire series, and fell in love.  THEN I rewatched ""Serenity"", and found that it makes much more sense.To see the entire cast back is a joy.  And to finally learn what happened to River, what she knew, was great.  But I have quite a few reservations about the movie as a whole.The characters feel...off.  Mal is so grouchy.  Where is his wry humor, glinted at in the beginning with the words ""This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode""?  So much of the time, Mal is a brutal, stiff, angry man...nothing like the man we met in ""Firefly"".  He readily brings along River on a job, when in ""Firefly"" he would never have done that, not after the strange things she did.  And his fights with Simon, how he treated Simon and River...it almost seemed as if none of ""Firefly"" had happened.  Simon and River weren't crew to him in ""Serenity""; something that vastly contradicts what he says and does in ""Firefly"".Another sad aspect is Inara.  Besides obviously not being in much of the movie, when she is there, she is delegated action girl and given a gun.  Yes, the stakes are high, but the stakes were high in many of their previous jobs, and never once did she don action girl clothes and tout a gun.  She was in the back, helping Simon nurse the wounded or acting as backup or some other such function (as in the ""Heart of Gold"" episode).  I just felt it violated her crucial role on the team.While the story is absolutely superb, interesting, on the edge of your seat, it disintegrates into a plain 'ol action flick in the last hour.  Lots of Star Wars-y space battles, fist fights, shoot-outs...yes, ""Firefly"" had its fair share of shootouts, but nothing on the scale of ""Serenity"".  I almost felt that they were included, to ""show off"" the film, to draw as many into the seats, wow them, and get them to come back for more.There were a few other aspects I didn't like...but to detail them would probably be huge spoilers.  Let's just say, not everyone makes it out in the end.  And seeing that...makes me very sad indeed (although I understand not everyone can survive).So, there we have it.  The gasping breath of ""Firefly"", the movie ""Serenity"".  I wish it blew my socks off.  Alas, it did not.  Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it.  It's okay to watch, particularly if you have seen ""Firefly"".  Personally, I just hate seeing the characters I've grown to love in ""Firefly"" change so drastically.  Many people apparently didn't have a problem with it.  Maybe I'm just weird.  Regardless, I very sadly give a 3 stars.  Bring back Firefly...the way it should be!Brought to you by:*C.S.

I knew nothing about the television series ""Firefly"" at the time (though I have subsequently seen several episodes, and love them almost as much as the movie).  I am not a ""cult follower"" of any show/movie/band/author/etc.  ""Serenity,"" however, grabbed my attention right off the bat, for one simple reason: its smooth blend of action and comedy into one tight, well-acted picture.River Tam (Summer Glau) is a troubled teenage girl; troubled in the sense that she's psychic, and has incredible fighting powers.  Her brother Simon (Sean Mahr) has bought both of them a place on Serenity, a starship led by Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion).  However, with a deadly assassin (Chiwetal Ejiofor) in hot pursuit, Mal and his ragged band of outlaws are about to uncover a secret so vast, it could rip the universe apart.I'll admit, the plot seems kinda hokey.  But what makes a good sci-fi movie is not the plot (let's face it, the plot is ALWAYS hokey in this genre), it's how the plot is pulled off.  Director Joss Whedon manages to keep the film tight and taught, while the superb cast keeps it all human.  The outcome is this: a science fiction flick that is dark, funny, and delectible.

951128,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BW7QWW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 8]","Even though I'm a big science-fiction fan who watches Fox more than any other network, I somehow managed to never see an episode of Firefly.  That means I came on board the Serenity with basically no knowledge at all about the series or the characters.  Naturally, I now plan on watching the Firefly episodes in the near future, but there is a very real chance I will say something in this review that will be deemed rather stupid by loyal fans - but, rest assured, I intend to have nothing but good things to say about this movie.  It definitely can be enjoyed on its own merits, but I did feel as if I were missing out on some background, especially in terms of the recent war and the true natures of the Alliance, the colonists on the outer, wilder worlds, and of course the Reavers.  It was also a little hard to fully embrace the heroes at first because - well, they are basically criminals who aren't averse to leaving a few bodies in their wake when they do a job.  These are deep characters, however, and it takes time to get to know them, especially Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), who seems to run hot and cold all the time.  Of course, his mood swings are nothing compared to those of River Tam (Summer Glau), the young psychic super-girl currently being protected by Mal and his crew.  River was trained by the Alliance government to be a superhuman with extrasensory powers and lethal fighting skills.  I must say I always enjoy watching a woman stomp mudholes in wave after wave of bad guys - and this girl doesn't bother with taking any names when she gets her groove on.  What a woman!River was saved from her life as an Alliance-controlled guinea pig of death by her brother, who can be a little annoying in a Jerry O'Connell sort of way.  Naturally, the Alliance wants her back - not just for whom and what she is but also for the highly classified information she might have gleaned from people in authority.  Since she doesn't officially exist, the government can't just put out an interstellar APB on her; instead, they send in a smooth-talking, highly trained assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who doesn't let a little thing like countless innocent deaths get in the way of his mission.  As for Mal and some of his crew, they aren't even sure they want to keep River around anymore, especially after she goes Bruce Lee on a whole bar full of tough hombres for no discernible reason.  It's bad enough the Alliance is gunning for them just for having her onboard, but it starts to look like she could be a danger to them in and of herself.  Mal wants to know what secret she has buried in her fragile brain, though - given the hated Alliance's determined effort to find and eliminate her, he knows it must be a real threat to their position and power.  He's right, of course.Serenity is a remarkable movie - nay, concept - in many ways.  The very story itself represents a unique take on science fiction (although I can't say I saw a lot of Firefly's vaunted Western tie-in in the movie), one built on fascinating characters as much as futuristic technology and marvelous (and they are marvelous, by the way) shoot-'em-ups in space.  The ever-ingenious Joss Whedon likes to diverge from common wisdom and prove all the ""it will never work"" critics wrong, and part of that involves some pretty unexpected fates for his characters here in this big-budget crowd-pleaser of a feature film.  I can see where fans of the Firefly series might come away rather shocked on a couple of occasions.I could quibble about a couple of things in the film (such as the melodramatic romantic pause at one point just before the climax and the bad guy's decision to risk his life going after the hero when he had ample opportunity to just blow the guy's brains out as easy as you please), but I won't.  Serenity is a great movie and the ultimate vindication for Joss Whedon and his hand-picked actors who were mismanaged and then dropped mercilessly and far too quickly by Fox.

Since this was opening night, packed with fans of the TV series, their lack of enthusiasm speaks a lot louder than words!I don't watch TV (gasp), so I haven't seen a single episode of the supposedly wonderful series. As a lover of sci-fi, my mind was wide open. What I saw was one of the most godforsaken awful formula movies of my entire life. A modern day cowboys and Indians flick geared towards the mentality a 15-year-old boy with way too much time on his hands!In the world of Serenity the stakes are high because the guys in the black hats are gonna eat ya alive, quite literally, if they catch ya! Or, you could get lucky, and just get a sword rammed through ya by a self-professed psychopath who in the end conveniently sprouts a conscience. Or better yet, we get to see a 90 pound, 17-year old, morose female, kill a roomful of blood thirsty, and hungry, fellers with her bare hands. So make sure you don't get her cranky! This movie is so twisted, disgusting and campy, I can't decide if it should be categorized as a horror flick or an out-of-control comedy. But it was so bad, it wasn't funny!I'm also sick and tired of a rather dangerous message running through this film: Government is bad because it oppresses the poor, innocent, good guys. If only the those liberal meanies would leave us alone nothing bad would ever happen! Boo-Ho! Yeah, right! This terribly misguided libertarian message of ""no government is the best government,"" simply does not hold water in the real world.One final question: How do Living Dead-type zombies, who are unable to utter a single word, other than arrrrrrgh, pilot high-tech spaceships with ease? How do these zombies have the smarts to maintain these ships, and even go toe-to-toe in battle with the big, bad government? It seems in the world of Serenity being a blood thirsty, insane, speech impaired mutant is no obstacle to success!I hope I have discouraged you from spending your hard earned money on this really rotten piece of celluloid. But if I have failed, please do not let your children see this film. You'll thank me later!P.S. For those of you who continuely fawn over this movie with cult-like adoration, I humbly suggest that you learn what REAL Science Fiction has to offer. It will take only one book to open narrow minds: ""Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,"" edited by Neil Barron.

951133,A2JLSQGDZZUNG,B000BW7QWW,Dante1138,"[4, 4]","Serenity is probably my favorite sci-fi film since Aliens, and a much closer franchise in feel to the original Star Wars then anything since The Empire Strikes Back. It is different in its tone from Firefly, the show that it follows (it is more plot and action driven than the delightfully meandering space western series) but the heart is still the same, with the most delightful set of characters this side of a Stagecoach.  Those who love Firefly/Serenity wax poetic about it to a nauseating degree, and I fall into this myself often times, so I will just say that if you have never seen the film or the series, both are worth your time.  There.As for the Blu Ray, I bought it as an upgrade over my DVD copy of the film. It is definitely a superior disc, but how much you notice will definitely depend on your set up. The film is often shot in dark, grainy interiors, an effective stylistic choice, but not one that lends itself to HD scrutiny. The image is by no means bad, it just won't be your reference disc any time soon. In exterior shots and during the space sequences, the HD shines through much more clearly, and it is a significant bump up from the standard definition version.The audio track is 5.1, but I would warn that you really need a 5.1 set up to appreciate it, or even to prefer it, to the DVD sound mix. Due to space restrictions in our TV room we are stuck with a soundabar with sub system that tries to emulate 5-channel surround sound through 3 speakers. On this set-up while watching Serenity, the dialogue often sounds too bright. Many times entire chunks of dialogue sound a bit like they've been looped (re-recorded after filming) which may or may not have been the case but were unnoticeable on the same set-up with the DVD.  Sound effects are booming and robust but fall into the familiar problem of being drastically louder than dialogue, so even with DAC cranked up you may have to ride the volume button through the entire film.  Again, this may be a result of using a soundbar instead of a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system, but it is a valid point to mention.Overall, the Blu Ray of this fantastic film is a clearly superior disc to the old DVD version. While it's not anywhere close to being one of the top looking discs out there, it is the best-looking - and depending on your set-up, best-sounding - version of this amazing movie you are going to find.",4,"An Excellent Film, A Very Good Blu Ray",1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,2386,"['Serenity', 'probably', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Aliens', 'much', 'closer', 'franchise', 'feel', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'then', 'anything', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'different', 'tone', 'Firefly', 'show', 'more', 'plot', 'action', 'driven', 'delightfully', 'meandering', 'space', 'western', 'series', 'heart', 'still', 'same', 'most', 'delightful', 'set', 'characters', 'side', 'Stagecoach', 'who', 'love', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'wax', 'poetic', 'nauseating', 'degree', 'fall', 'often', 'times', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'series', 'are', 'time', 'There.As', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'bought', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'copy', 'film', 'definitely', 'superior', 'disc', 'how', 'much', 'notice', 'will', 'definitely', 'depend', 'set', 'up', 'film', 'often', 'shot', 'dark', 'grainy', 'interiors', 'effective', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'not', 'one', 'HD', 'scrutiny', 'image', 'means', 'bad', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'reference', 'time', 'soon', 'exterior', 'shots', 'space', 'sequences', 'HD', 'shines', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'significant', 'bump', 'up', 'standard', 'definition', 'version.The', 'audio', 'track', '5.1', 'would', 'warn', 'really', 'need', '5.1', 'set', 'up', 'appreciate', 'even', 'prefer', 'DVD', 'sound', 'mix', 'Due', 'space', 'restrictions', 'TV', 'room', 'are', 'stuck', 'soundabar', 'sub', 'system', 'emulate', '5-channel', 'surround', 'sound', '3', 'speakers', 'set-up', 'watching', 'Serenity', 'dialogue', 'often', 'too', 'bright', 'Many', 'times', 'entire', 'chunks', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'bit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looped', 're-recorded', 'filming', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'were', 'unnoticeable', 'same', 'set-up', 'DVD', 'Sound', 'effects', 'are', 'booming', 'robust', 'fall', 'familiar', 'problem', 'being', 'drastically', 'louder', 'dialogue', 'so', 'even', 'DAC', 'cranked', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'ride', 'volume', 'button', 'entire', 'film', 'Again', 'may', 'be', 'result', 'using', 'soundbar', 'instead', '5.1', '7.1', 'surround', 'system', 'valid', 'point', 'mention.Overall', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'fantastic', 'film', 'clearly', 'superior', 'disc', 'old', 'DVD', 'version', 'not', 'anywhere', 'close', 'being', 'one', 'top', 'looking', 'discs', 'there', 'best-looking', 'depending', 'set-up', 'best-sounding', 'version', 'amazing', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'find']",N/A

The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths. The story-line is a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme.

Settlers occupy the outer rim, facing a literal final frontier as they battle with the hardships of poverty and technological breakdown and raids by cannabalistic humanoids known as 'reevers'. Amid this chaos add a ship full of brigands who harbour two fugatives on the run from the alliance, one of whom may be the most powerful weapon known to man.It should be run of the mill space fantasy but Whedon's strengths as a writer and first time big screen director hone this movie into a rewarding experience for the viewer.

The bad characters drive the action perfectly and with malicious intent and the good characters deal with the adversity brilliantly. Conceptually, most SF builds on what came before it. Serenity has no such limitations: it builds on something else. It's hard to describe why a story with so little in the way of truly original thought plays so well on all levels. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that when all the pieces come together just right, originally takes a back seat to synergy and perfect execution. You could have put the troupe of misfits in Serenity in covered wagons on the western plains and the story would have worked just as well. Convert them to pirates on the open seas and the stories would still play. Make them a band of renegade rebel soldiers and the basic plot lines would hold up with a few adjustments. I loved this film and after seeing it, immediately watched the DVDs of the series, and I was surprised by how well the feature film preserved those elements that made the series work so well - the characters - fascinating, complex, fully developed and above all, entertaining.

951160,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,B000BW7QWW,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[3, 4]","I watched Serenity in the cinema without having seen Firefly. Very simply, Serenity is an outstanding Sci Fi film with a great storyline and laced throughout with wry and gritty humour. Characterisation is very good, indeed, and melds superbly with the aforementioned storyline and humour. Basically the characterisation depicts real people and this makes the difference.Serenity is also an example of the Sci Fi genre making relevant social comment but sadly this probably contributed to the cancellation of the tv series from which it is derived.Joss Whedon (the series creator) has made a space saga set 500 hundred years in the future. With undertones of the Old West, Mankind has been colonising other planets and moons. A bitter civil war between Separatists and the Alliance Government has recently finished, resulting in the victory of the Alliance. This government tends to interfere in every day life, is ultra politically correct, and seems to be in hock to mega corporations..... (Hmmm I wonder what the parody there could be?!!).Eking out an existence among the many worlds, is a survivor of the Separatist forces - Captain Mal Reynolds (played well by a wry Nathan Fillion). His command is an old spaceship called Serenity. Mal Reynolds and his crew smuggle and deal in contraband etc. They also take on passengers on a 'no questions asked' basis.Recent additions to the crew of the Serenity include a young doctor - Simon and his telepathic sister - River. Both are fleeing from the Alliance, and River was a test subject for drug research on psychics. This testing was carried out by the Alliance and the mega Corporations, and both want her returned swiftly. Hunting River and Simon, is an Alliance elite officer/assassin known as an operative. Superbly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, he is a glacially calm, reflective, and totally ruthless individual, determined to catch River and Simon by any means possible.Apart from the Alliance, the crew of the Serenity have to face other dangers including the Reavers who are horrifically deformed space cannibals who hunt the cosmos, looking for victims to be eaten alive, dead not being to their taste (so to speak).Serenity is a brilliant film from start to finish and will keep the viewer wholly engrossed. I was surprised and delighted with how good it actually was, and went back for a repeat viewing at the cinema. I also bought the dvd when it came out, and again it makes for terrific viewing on the home cinema system. Sound and picture are both superb on an HDMI picture and multi channel sound.I also bought the dvd of the tv series Firefly and really enjoyed this too. In fact I am glad that I saw the film first because if I had seen the tv series first, then I might have had some unrealistic expectations for the film version. Like many other reviewers on here, I am amazed that the tv series was cancelled but there do appear to be a number of reasons for this, and I intend to look at these in more detail when I write my review of Firefly the tv series. The film, however, ties up many of the loose ends from the tv series.Good news for fans is that Whedon and Universal apparently have another two films of Serenity in the pipeline, and I for one cannot wait to see them.",5,Simply outstanding,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,3248,"['watched', 'Serenity', 'cinema', 'having', 'seen', 'Firefly', 'Very', 'simply', 'Serenity', 'outstanding', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'film', 'great', 'storyline', 'laced', 'wry', 'gritty', 'humour', 'Characterisation', 'very', 'good', 'indeed', 'melds', 'superbly', 'aforementioned', 'storyline', 'humour', 'Basically', 'characterisation', 'real', 'people', 'difference.Serenity', 'also', 'example', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'genre', 'making', 'relevant', 'social', 'comment', 'sadly', 'probably', 'contributed', 'cancellation', 'tv', 'series', 'derived.Joss', 'Whedon', 'series', 'creator', 'made', 'space', 'saga', 'set', '500', 'hundred', 'years', 'future', 'undertones', 'Old', 'West', 'Mankind', 'been', 'colonising', 'other', 'planets', 'moons', 'bitter', 'civil', 'war', 'Separatists', 'Alliance', 'Government', 'recently', 'finished', 'resulting', 'victory', 'Alliance', 'government', 'interfere', 'day', 'life', 'ultra', 'politically', 'correct', 'be', 'hock', 'mega', 'corporations', '..', 'Hmmm', 'wonder', 'what', 'parody', 'could', 'be', '.Eking', 'out', 'existence', 'many', 'worlds', 'survivor', 'Separatist', 'forces', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'played', 'well', 'wry', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'command', 'old', 'spaceship', 'called', 'Serenity', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'crew', 'smuggle', 'deal', 'contraband', 'etc', 'also', 'take', 'passengers', ""'no"", 'questions', 'asked', 'basis.Recent', 'additions', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'include', 'young', 'doctor', 'Simon', 'telepathic', 'sister', 'River', 'are', 'fleeing', 'Alliance', 'River', 'was', 'test', 'subject', 'drug', 'research', 'psychics', 'testing', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'Alliance', 'mega', 'Corporations', 'want', 'returned', 'swiftly', 'Hunting', 'River', 'Simon', 'Alliance', 'elite', 'officer/assassin', 'known', 'operative', 'Superbly', 'played', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'glacially', 'calm', 'reflective', 'totally', 'ruthless', 'individual', 'determined', 'catch', 'River', 'Simon', 'means', 'possible.Apart', 'Alliance', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'have', 'face', 'other', 'dangers', 'including', 'Reavers', 'who', 'are', 'horrifically', 'deformed', 'space', 'cannibals', 'who', 'hunt', 'cosmos', 'looking', 'victims', 'be', 'eaten', 'alive', 'dead', 'not', 'being', 'taste', 'so', 'speak', '.Serenity', 'brilliant', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'keep', 'viewer', 'wholly', 'engrossed', 'was', 'surprised', 'delighted', 'how', 'good', 'actually', 'was', 'went', 'back', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'cinema', 'also', 'bought', 'dvd', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'again', 'terrific', 'viewing', 'home', 'cinema', 'system', 'Sound', 'picture', 'are', 'superb', 'HDMI', 'picture', 'multi', 'channel', 'sound.I', 'also', 'bought', 'dvd', 'tv', 'series', 'Firefly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'too', 'fact', 'am', 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'had', 'seen', 'tv', 'series', 'first', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'unrealistic', 'expectations', 'film', 'version', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'am', 'amazed', 'tv', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'do', 'appear', 'be', 'number', 'reasons', 'intend', 'look', 'more', 'detail', 'when', 'write', 'review', 'Firefly', 'tv', 'series', 'film', 'however', 'up', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'tv', 'series.Good', 'news', 'fans', 'Whedon', 'Universal', 'apparently', 'have', 'two', 'films', 'Serenity', 'pipeline', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see']",N/A

Early in the film the crews doctor Simon rescues his mysterious sister River Tam. River has been held by people who have been pumping her head full of memories that are not her own. After rescuing River, Serenity's crew finds themselves in much danger as the people who were holding River will stop at no means to get her back because of the secrets she holds.Nathan Fillion stars as Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, the captain of Serenity. He doesn't mind having River on board because he feels that she has a sixth sense that can help them when they go on their bounty missions. Gina Torres also stars in the film as Zoe a fiery crew member who doesn't like when the crew has to use guns but won't hesitate to fire when she has to. The renegade crew has to survive crazed cannibals known as Revers and they have to stay one step ahead of the killers who want River Tam back. Popular character actor Ron Glass (Barney Miller), has a small role in the film as a shepard that the crew seeks guidance from. Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor steals the show with his amazing role as an assasin out to kill River Tam. He is so believable in his role that when his character experiences a change of heart it's unbelievable.The bottom line is that if you watched the television series Firefly you will enjoy this film 10 times more than a casual film viewer. I watched this film with my mother, who watched Firefly and she was filling in gaps for me that the writers of the film didn't address for the person watching the film who had never seen the television series. The pace of the movie mixed with the lack of big name stars and mediocre score makes it seem much more like a made for television or made for cable movie than a theatrical release.

Bottom line: the HD DVD was beautiful; the Blu-ray is even better.For context, I'm evaluating these on a 50"" Pioneer Elite Kuro TV through very good electronics, but without the newer HDMI 1.3 ability to pass a lossless, true DTS HD sound signal by means of that connection.  So when I say that the sound on the Blu-ray is much more dynamic than on the HD DVD, I am comparing apples-to-apples the converted digital signal as processed by my 3-year old Pioneer Elite AVR.  Not only does the Blu-ray deliver a far greater dynamic range, but the center channel dialogue is much clearer than I have ever heard it, including in any theater.  The directionality and clarity of the surround effects are simply awesome, putting this disc in the demonstration-quality range for the sound alone.But it doesn't stop there. The picture is also the most vibrant I have seen it: vivid color saturation, and accurate reproduction of the visuals I remember from the theater, not to mention it being the first time I have ever experienced the computer-generated special effects scenes as looking truely high-def themselves.  All in all, a recommended purchase for Serenity fans; lovers of that type of sci-fi film that, like the original Day the Earth Stood Still, assays a rarified level of artistry and social commentary; and (yeah, I admit it) an incredible Blu-ray experience.

Simply delighted to discover an unknown, well crafted Sci-fi show--which Firefly certainly is.  The TV series was great fun, mixed with regret that it was all going to end too soon--its sad fate sealed and finished years earlier from corporate dictates.Once bonded to the first, short Firefly season, the movie brings  welcomed, well developed characters (with much unsaid) back to life on the screen, spewing the same clever diologue (sometimes breathlessly), some tying up loose ends.  My compliments to the special-effects guys for launching a space craft that looks like a duck and gains the effection I usually reserve for my '81 Subaru wagon. The sequence where a Reever ship follows Serenity through the Alliance battle, blazing away with a continuous ray bolt accompanied with a deep electric hum was noticably original in my book.  To great satisfaction, River's quiet, disconcerning persona is finally unleashed toward the movie's end.Genuinely sorry to see such a good cast and concept come and go as it has. I'll miss this idea. Someone should e-mail the 628 reviews here to date (just from the movie released in Sept. 2005) to the Fox gods on high to remind them they turned gold to dust.As it turned out, my Firefly DVD first season set had two disc 1's--missing Disc 2.

By way of testimonial though I actually watched Serenity first and liked it enough that I then watched the whole Firefly series so that should be an indication of how good it is I hope.Firefly was an amazing series that wove, cool concepts, giant glactic govenment, rebles, smugglers, awesome characters, interesting mysteries, violence and peace all together to come up with probably one of the most original sci-fi concepts around.  Its cancelation was a kick in the sack to its fans and kind of makes us late takers cry on the inside.The movie gave us the crew of Serenity again with a slightly bigger budget, cool story, and was a way for Joss to tie up some of the loose ends in the series.  Although they would have been so much more if he could of done it over the course of, oh say, Season 2! Oh well.The movie itself ties up one of the main mysteries of the series, that of, ""What's up with River?""  It leaves other open though, such as what the Sheppard's real back ground is.  Maybe well find out one day.  Cross your fingers.While the movie itself and the final outcome may not have been the most original, its still wrapped around an excellent cast and concept that, if you've seen the series, you care about.  If you haven't seen the series it may peak you interest enough that you'll want to as in my case.

Serenity bombed at the box office but for the people who have seen it, they can be divided into two camps. Fan boys who have an unhealthy fixation with Joss Whedon of all people and the other camp is the general, all purpose hater who despises anything that might be remotely different from the status quo. Allow me to be the voice of reason as I am not of either camp, not a Whedon fan, nor a hater.No one can possibly claim Serenity is off the beaten path, unique or should enjoy cult-like status, this movie is a highly predictable space adventure of the kind you've seen or heard countless times before. What makes this movie somewhat different is the writer/director Whedon's light touch. Whedon has certainly seen too many westerns and sci-fi movies, he's read too many adventure novels and comic books and he's seen countless hours of television and been the producer of countless hours of television. Whedon knows what he's about, he's ironic, he's smart and in Serenity he shows himself a capable director.Serenity is very breezy, tongue in cheek, full of humor, sharp as a knife dialogue and even dramatic at the appropriate places. In it's own way, this film is more satisfying than Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. I still have reservations about Serenity because the final act is somewhat cliche ridden, we know at least one of the crew has to die for instance. It devolves into a terrific made for cable TV movie in the last half hour, like a cheesy sci-fi channel flick with a big budget.

951193,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000BW7QWW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","SERENITY (2005, 119 minutes, Writ./Dir. Joss Whedon) is one of the best sci-fi goofball future universe films I have ever seen, this side ofIce Pirates. It was fun, had exactly one swear word and virtually no sex - but lots of fun, innuendo that hit the spot and a very moving, rousing conclusion. The swashbuckling is the best I've seen since STAR WARS. Even the opening credits are a credit to opening credits!This appears to be set circa the year 2500. As far as I can tell, the crew of the Serenity - all salty ex-warriors in a rebellion (a special battalion known as ""Browncoats"") against the evil totalitarian Alliance - are kind of a fun, silly version of the original crew fromAlien. The captain, a former Browncoat apparently turned mercenary - finds himself harboring his doctor's psychic sister. If you're lost or confused, welcome to the world of SERENITY.Throw in an assassin agent (the outstanding yet chameleonic Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's hunting the psychic girl and you have an adventure to end all adventures. If they had thrown in more aliens this would have been right on par withJohn Carter(see my review). The special effects are literally the best I have ever witnessed, like I was really there with those people, the story, though a bit SyFy-film-of-the-month in nature, was compelling.My only complaints aside from not knowing any of the backstory is that the film was a tad clunky and amateurish in an odd way. Whether stylized bad acting at certain moments or the teen-minded arc of the plot, it lacked a certain maturity - but I can live with that when everything else is so good. Even the soundtrack was perfect. Not John Williams, but it was perfect.How did I alight on this film?Countless people had begged me to watch the ill-fated, two-season TV series ""Firefly"" (Firefly: The Complete Series). I never did because I wasn't too interested. Anyway when I went to look for it the thing had vanished at the time. ""Firefly"" was gone. So, I'd heard of this SERENITY film for years, and had been told it was the conclusion of the ""Firefly"" series, which Whedon had done to satisfy fans who are also known as ""Browncoats"". That is how I closed the circuit - I was looking for a brown coat on the internet one day. I ran across a photo of the captain of SERENITY in his brown coat.Plus I found and bought two dandy brown coats for myself. Weird how these things happen. In any case, the series is long dead (from what little I know), the film obviously never engendered a sequel, and I am still endeavoring to discover why the English in this is mid-18th century in nature and why everyone speaks in perfect Chinese half the time. My understanding is the Americans and the Chinese resolved their differences to get to space together, and I have to admit that is how a bilingual 'biculture' is born.These guys also read/write in Chinese as well as English, eat Chinese food and drink tea.Also I'd like to know their martial arts history and why they all seem to know some form of art. Finally, I wonder why there are Buddhists, Christians, one Jewish kid and apparently nothing else in the way of religions. I liked what I assume is the Christian pastor's title, ""Shepherd"", and I may adopt that. Being a Buddhist priest, I wondered why SERENITY has none - or rabbis for that matter.  All these things really make a stand-alone film, yet despite that I understand SERENITY won critical acclaim as the best film adapted from a TV series.Perhaps some fan will post under my review and tell me some stuff. Or else I can buy the series and discover it the painful way. No matter what the heck I do, don't you worry about what or how, I suggest you get this fantastic, rousing film and watch the father of all these recent sci-fi-outer-space TV series. If you got fed up with Galactica as fast as I did, check this out and see how it SHOULD be done! I just reviewedThe Hunger Games... I did not know quite what it was missing.Well, it SHOULD have been more like SERENITY.",5,Synchronicity led THIS Browncoat to Serenity,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,3988,"['SERENITY', '2005', '119', 'minutes', 'Writ./Dir', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'goofball', 'future', 'universe', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'side', 'ofIce', 'Pirates', 'was', 'fun', 'had', 'exactly', 'one', 'swear', 'word', 'virtually', 'sex', 'lots', 'fun', 'innuendo', 'hit', 'spot', 'very', 'moving', 'rousing', 'conclusion', 'swashbuckling', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'Even', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'credit', 'opening', 'credits', 'be', 'set', 'circa', 'year', '2500', 'As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'salty', 'ex-warriors', 'rebellion', 'special', 'battalion', 'known', 'Browncoats', 'evil', 'totalitarian', 'Alliance', 'are', 'kind', 'fun', 'silly', 'version', 'original', 'crew', 'fromAlien', 'captain', 'former', 'Browncoat', 'apparently', 'turned', 'mercenary', 'harboring', 'doctor', 'psychic', 'sister', ""'re"", 'lost', 'confused', 'welcome', 'world', 'SERENITY.Throw', 'assassin', 'agent', 'outstanding', 'yet', 'chameleonic', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'who', 'hunting', 'psychic', 'girl', 'have', 'adventure', 'end', 'adventures', 'had', 'thrown', 'more', 'aliens', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'par', 'withJohn', 'Carter', 'see', 'review', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'literally', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'was', 'really', 'people', 'story', 'bit', 'SyFy-film-of-the-month', 'nature', 'was', 'compelling.My', 'only', 'complaints', 'aside', 'not', 'knowing', 'backstory', 'film', 'was', 'tad', 'clunky', 'amateurish', 'odd', 'way', 'Whether', 'stylized', 'bad', 'acting', 'certain', 'moments', 'teen-minded', 'arc', 'plot', 'lacked', 'certain', 'maturity', 'can', 'live', 'when', 'everything', 'else', 'so', 'good', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'perfect', 'Not', 'John', 'Williams', 'was', 'perfect.How', 'did', 'alight', 'film', 'Countless', 'people', 'had', 'begged', 'watch', 'ill-fated', 'two-season', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'Firefly', 'Complete', 'Series', 'never', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'interested', 'Anyway', 'when', 'went', 'look', 'thing', 'had', 'vanished', 'time', 'Firefly', 'was', 'gone', 'So', ""'d"", 'heard', 'SERENITY', 'film', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'was', 'conclusion', 'Firefly', 'series', 'Whedon', 'had', 'done', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'known', 'Browncoats', 'how', 'closed', 'circuit', 'was', 'looking', 'brown', 'coat', 'internet', 'one', 'day', 'ran', 'photo', 'captain', 'SERENITY', 'brown', 'coat.Plus', 'found', 'bought', 'two', 'dandy', 'brown', 'coats', 'Weird', 'how', 'things', 'happen', 'case', 'series', 'long', 'dead', 'what', 'little', 'know', 'film', 'obviously', 'never', 'engendered', 'sequel', 'am', 'still', 'endeavoring', 'discover', 'why', 'English', 'mid-18th', 'century', 'nature', 'why', 'everyone', 'speaks', 'perfect', 'Chinese', 'time', 'understanding', 'Americans', 'Chinese', 'resolved', 'differences', 'get', 'space', 'together', 'have', 'admit', 'how', 'bilingual', ""'biculture"", 'born.These', 'guys', 'also', 'read/write', 'Chinese', 'as', 'well', 'English', 'eat', 'Chinese', 'food', 'drink', 'tea.Also', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'martial', 'arts', 'history', 'why', 'seem', 'know', 'form', 'art', 'Finally', 'wonder', 'why', 'are', 'Buddhists', 'Christians', 'one', 'Jewish', 'kid', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'else', 'way', 'religions', 'liked', 'what', 'assume', 'Christian', 'pastor', 'title', 'Shepherd', 'may', 'adopt', 'Being', 'Buddhist', 'priest', 'wondered', 'why', 'SERENITY', 'none', 'rabbis', 'matter', 'things', 'really', 'make', 'stand-alone', 'film', 'yet', 'understand', 'SERENITY', 'won', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'best', 'film', 'adapted', 'TV', 'fan', 'will', 'post', 'review', 'tell', 'stuff', 'else', 'can', 'buy', 'series', 'discover', 'painful', 'way', 'matter', 'what', 'heck', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'what', 'how', 'suggest', 'get', 'fantastic', 'rousing', 'film', 'watch', 'father', 'recent', 'sci-fi-outer-space', 'TV', 'series', 'got', 'fed', 'up', 'Galactica', 'as', 'fast', 'did', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'how', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'reviewedThe', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'was', 'missing.Well', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'like', 'SERENITY']",N/A

951197,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B000BW7QWW,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","I watched the TV seriesFirefly. I admit I liked it, but didn't become a hardcore fan. I was looking forward toSerenity, the movie I thought would wrap up many of the TV show's loose ends. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have suffered in the hands of ""Hollywood"".Where the TV showFireflyfocused on low-key character development,Serenityis nearly indistinguishable from most big-budget sci-fi/action flicks. The film focuses on one of the more villains from the show: the Reavers, a group of space zombies. At least in the TV show, when we didn't ever actually see the Reavers, our imagination could fill in the blanks and thus magnify the horror. On screen, they're just B-movie zombies. A good portion of the movie features fight scenes between the crew and Reavers that go on way too long. Not what I expected from such a character-driven sci-fi franchise.I remember watching the TV show thinking that there are so many possibilities for River and the only way they could mess up the mystery surrounding her character would be to reveal that she was part of a secret weapons program. And, sadly, in Serenity the Alliance experiments on River are revealed to be a part of a secret weapons program. So, River was trained to be a super-soldier. As if that isn't the oldest sci-fi cliche in the book! Utterly disappointing. River was such an interesting character that I'd really hoped for something more exciting from her character.Finally, there were several pointless deaths of some of the principal characters. I won't spoil it by revealing who dies, but none of their deaths were particularly memorable or did much to drive the story along. Several other characters fall by the wayside, including the Companion Inara Serra, who rejoins Serenity briefly but doesn't do much after that. The ensemble that worked so well on TV often became the Nathan Fillion show on the big screen.Overall, I just got the sense that Universal thought Serenity would do better by appealing to teenage boys and throwing in a lot of battle scenes. It's a shame because there's a lot that I like about the movie. The production values, special effects, and acting are all much better than anything seen in the TV show. There's a gem of an interesting philosophical idea when the Firefly crew uncovers the mystery, but it's thrown out there in a heavy-handed way for a few moments before going back to more fight scenes. Given that there probably won't ever be another Firefly movie, this is a somewhat lackluster end for the franchise.Overall, 2.5 starsUPDATE (2/21/13): I rewatched the movie again and think I was a bit too harsh. While I don't think the movie lives up to the glory of the original show, nor is it a bomb. In fact, it does explore several subtle philosophical themes about government control over society and the many aspects of faith. I could have done with fewer Reavers and more characters, but I also appreciate that the Reavers play a more central role to the story than ""just"" mindless ghouls.Overall: 3.5, rounded down to 3 stars.",3,Hollywoodization of Firefly,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",2012,3036,"['watched', 'TV', 'seriesFirefly', 'admit', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'become', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'toSerenity', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'wrap', 'up', 'many', 'TV', 'show', 'loose', 'ends', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'have', 'suffered', 'hands', 'Hollywood', '.Where', 'TV', 'showFireflyfocused', 'low-key', 'character', 'development', 'Serenityis', 'nearly', 'indistinguishable', 'most', 'big-budget', 'sci-fi/action', 'flicks', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'villains', 'show', 'Reavers', 'group', 'space', 'zombies', 'least', 'TV', 'show', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'actually', 'see', 'Reavers', 'imagination', 'could', 'fill', 'blanks', 'thus', 'magnify', 'horror', 'screen', ""'re"", 'just', 'B-movie', 'zombies', 'good', 'portion', 'movie', 'features', 'fight', 'scenes', 'crew', 'Reavers', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Not', 'what', 'expected', 'such', 'character-driven', 'sci-fi', 'franchise.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'TV', 'show', 'thinking', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities', 'River', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'mess', 'up', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'reveal', 'was', 'part', 'secret', 'weapons', 'program', 'sadly', 'Serenity', 'Alliance', 'experiments', 'River', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'part', 'secret', 'weapons', 'program', 'So', 'River', 'was', 'trained', 'be', 'super-soldier', ""n't"", 'oldest', 'sci-fi', 'cliche', 'book', 'Utterly', 'disappointing', 'River', 'was', 'such', 'interesting', 'character', ""'d"", 'really', 'hoped', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'character.Finally', 'were', 'several', 'pointless', 'deaths', 'principal', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'revealing', 'who', 'none', 'deaths', 'were', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'did', 'much', 'drive', 'story', 'along', 'Several', 'other', 'characters', 'fall', 'wayside', 'including', 'Companion', 'Inara', 'Serra', 'who', 'Serenity', 'briefly', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'ensemble', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'TV', 'often', 'became', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'show', 'big', 'screen.Overall', 'just', 'got', 'sense', 'Universal', 'thought', 'Serenity', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'appealing', 'teenage', 'boys', 'throwing', 'lot', 'battle', 'scenes', 'shame', 'lot', 'like', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'seen', 'TV', 'show', 'gem', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'idea', 'when', 'Firefly', 'crew', 'uncovers', 'mystery', 'thrown', 'out', 'there', 'heavy-handed', 'way', 'few', 'moments', 'going', 'back', 'more', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Given', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'Firefly', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'lackluster', 'end', 'franchise.Overall', '2.5', 'starsUPDATE', '2/21/13', 'rewatched', 'movie', 'again', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'up', 'glory', 'original', 'show', 'bomb', 'fact', 'explore', 'several', 'subtle', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'government', 'control', 'society', 'many', 'aspects', 'faith', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'fewer', 'Reavers', 'more', 'characters', 'also', 'appreciate', 'Reavers', 'play', 'more', 'central', 'role', 'story', 'just', 'mindless', 'ghouls.Overall', '3.5', 'rounded', 'down', '3', 'stars']",N/A

The plot of Serenity picks up a few months, it seems, after the end of the series. We quickly see that River is serving as the voice of the film and we watch from her eyes as things go from complicated, to disturbing and then downright terrifying. No spoilers here, but for my money, the film answers all the questions you might have had lingering.If you are still left wanting, there's a few graphic novels and a role-playing game that share this 'verse.The film was gorgeous on DVD format, and on Blu-Ray, it sweeps through scenes in details some viewers may have missed. And the sound in 5.1 systems was impressive in DVD format, but there are a few scenes that ratchet up better than the DVD (at least, that's how it sounds to me). The special features are incredible, including a few 'sessions' as River experienced at the hand of the Alliance. The bulk of these features are included on the special edition of the DVD, but the Blu-Ray includes a few U-Control tidbits not seen before.And for non-fans watching the film for the first time, watch it with subtitles on. That way you can catch the lightning-like banter at the start of the film. That alone tells you everything you need to know about the background.

Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds, a renegade who fought against the new unified central government (the ""Alliance""), the crew of the Firefly-class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can. They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar.""So you haven't watched the tv series Firefly? No biggie. You can jump right in to this great flick without the pre-knowledge of each of the characters and enjoy it all the same (though the enjoyment is multiplied for fans of the show).Characters: We have depth to characters here, no one-dimensional action heroes. Everyone has a different motivation and nothing is cliche that I can think of off the top of my headPlot: This is a wrap up to the series in some regards but also makes it so a new series can take off at any given point. The story is more functional in giving us background on the Alliance, River & Simon Tam and Reavers. . .all of which were a big boon and highly appreciated.Setting: You got to love the western/sci-fi feel of this flick. It makes it adventureous and a sense of discover because we finally break from the traditional Star Trek and Star Wars worlds that have been overly exploited over the years. I actually appreciate there are no ""alien humunoids"" in this movie/show.Action: The trailer made me wince thinking the fight scenes were going to be pretty weak, but with the right direction and great acting the fight scenes were welcomed.Special Effects: Taking the same great special effects applied to the series and uping things a knotch the visual eye candy is handled well, but neither does it detract or add too much to the movie. It was just the right balance to be functional, attractive and keep us focused on the story and characters.OVERALL: I was greatly impressed with this movie and will own it when it comes out in a few weeks. It stands alone as a great addition to any movie collection or a wonderful addition to anyone who already ownes the series. Watch it on the big screen if you still can then run out and buy it.

951215,A1OZFMJ2AD2R41,B000BW7QWW,Furiae,"[25, 26]","The reason Serenity didn't do well in theaters had nothing to do with the movie itself.  The cast was superb, each actor seemed born for their part, the script was fantastic, and the story was absolutely inspiring.  The story was warm, funny, and heartbreaking, and there was an amazing amount of depth present in this film.  Joss Whedon's genius was on high display in Serenity.  The film is also highly accessible.  You don't need to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it.  I brought two of my gal pals to see the movie and both hate science fiction, but both were thoroughly impressed and praised it as a ""really good movie.""  80+% of critics also enjoyed it, which is rare praise for a science fiction film.So, why did Serenity perform poorly at the box office?  Because none of the stars were famous.  There were no headliners.  Combine that with the fact that it's a science fiction ""space opera"" (a description that turns off most people), there was no draw to the movie.The movie is a spin-off of the short-lived series ""Firefly"" (which was some damned good television).  Like most people who watched the series, I approached it with apprehension (sci-fi is *not* my favorite genre).  I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, however, so I thought I'd give Joss Whedon's new series a chance.  I was won over by the third episode, and I almost didn't want to finish my ""Firefly"" DVDs because I knew the show got canceled and I simply didn't want it to end.Lightning struck twice, however, and we were treated to a Firefly movie.  Serenity was everything I had hoped for and more.  I went to see the movie with already-high expectations that I, in my foolishness, thought couldn't be topped.  I was so surprised by the brilliance of the film that I went back for more, and ended up seeing it in theaters three times--that is a huge compliment coming from me, because I generally wait for movies to come out on DVD and rarely visit the theater.Every time I saw Serenity in the theater, the audiences laughed, gasped, and applauded.  The story is engaging, easy to understand, and even easier to appreciate.  Joss Whedon's mastery over the English language translates into a colorful (in a good way) script, and the pace at which the movie unfolds is perfection--believe me, if there were parts of the film that dragged, I would have caught it after three trips to the theater.What separates this film from every other science fiction film is its focus on its characters.  This is a human story, despite it being a sci-fi story.  It's not about space travel, wars between supernaturally gifted forces wielding lightsabers, aliens, and discovering new worlds.  It's focus remains with its central cast.  Joss Whedon's focus has always been on people, and his characters are rich, warm, and three-dimensional.  It doesn't require a huge stretch of the imagination to believe these people might exist.Too much science-fiction has its characters exist to revolve around their fantastic worlds and ideas.  Science-fiction has a tendency to turn off people because of its tendency to be stories about everything but its characters.  It's hollow and hard to follow.  Serenity is just the opposite.  It's a story about the characters, and everything revolves around the main characters.Many critics have described the movie's plot as what would have happened if Star Wars centered around Han Solo.  Indeed, Han Solo was one of the few characters who were more fleshed out and less trapped by their ""role,"" so there is some truth to this.  Mal, Serenity's mercenary captain, does, at times, resemble a crankier, darker Han Solo.  Mal is the perfect anti-hero.Mal is a mercenary who does what he needs to do to keep his ship afloat and his crew together, and he fights in the movie's conflict because he is forced to.  Mal doesn't suffer from pretentions of nobility and has no qualms about running from fights he doesn't need to fight.  However, when the story's antagonist threatens members of his crew and forces Mal to decide between fighting for his people or abandoning crewmembers, Mal chooses the former.  Having fought in the war as a sergeant, the one thing Mal won't do is leave his men.  He is a flawed man with his own code of honor.As fascinating as Mal (who is played by the funny and dashing Nathan Fillion) is, it's River who steals the show.  River is a gifted teenage girl that was once part of a government experiment.  Her off-the-chart IQ attracted the government's attention, and she was made into a secret weapon.  River became a psychic super-soldier, albiet an emotionally and mentally instable one, as a result of having her brain tampered with too many times in too many experiments.  River is played by the beautiful Summer Glau, who brings extraordinary grace to the character.  It was a treat to see Summer Glau's fight scenes, since she's a classically trained ballet dancer.  I'm sure it was intentional, since the character was described as loving dance, but all the fight scenes flowed like a dance.  I have never used the word ""graceful"" to describe a fight scene, but it definitely applies in this case.You'll notice that I haven't gone into the plot too much, because I sincerely don't want to ruin the surprise.  I had never been so swept away by a film like Serenity.  The first time I saw the movie, I knew that it would be a long time before I would encounter another movie that could take me on a ride as wild as the one Serenity inspired.  The film is action packed and the plot is emotionally driven.  This film is a fine example of the perfection that results in a marriage between good action and fine storytelling.I sincerely hope this DVD sells well and that we'll get sequels.  Underworld and Pitch Black bounced back as a result of DVD sales, and I am holding my breath for Serenity 2.  I have never urged readers to buy products in my reviews.  I have always only encouraged and suggested, but this film deserves it--SEE THIS MOVIE.  It's the best film of 2005.",5,Good movie--perhaps *too* good,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",2005,5995,"['reason', 'Serenity', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie',

Suffice to say, this is probably my favorite film from last year, and definitely my favorite so-called 'space opera' of all-time.  This is one of those films that has got it all:  Good action, interesting, dynamic and most of all, very likable characters, emotional resonance, lotsa extremely funny dialogue and last but not least, zombies.  Yet, despite it's being a 'fun' movie, it's not with out a darker edge, and it feels more substantiative then most films of this sort.  Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds is a classic character.  Yes he's just the outwardly cynical anti-hero who is actually somewhat idealistic at heart archetype, but this is probably my favorite sort of hero, and he plays it as well as anyone ever has.  Chiwetel Elijofor is also especially good as the villainous Operative.  He's another typical character, the cold and polite yet ruthless villain-killer, but he gives the role a bit more depth then it usually has.  Here Whedon wrote a character that reminds us that most 'villains' don't think of themselves as such (Though the Operative, ironically, does) and are still quite human.  The film also deserves credit for just allowing a somewhat novel take on the genre.  This sorta genre has always been associated with westerns, but this is the only instance where I think that the connection has been overt, and I think it's a very effective combination.My only complaint is that even at 2 hours in length the movie seems to end only as it's getting started.

951232,A3LFIA97BUU5IE,B000BW7QWW,Get Reel,"[8, 9]","To start with, while it's not necessary to watch the Firefly series first, I do think it's very helpful so that you have the correct (or a better) emotional context to enjoy the film. What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode. I knew I was going to love it when the Pilot episode opened with Wash (the ship's pilot) playing with plastic dinosaurs while waiting for the crew to finish a 'heist.'Serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past. The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good and consistent with the series). There is great action. But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special. It's not that the acting is Oscar quality per se, it's that the characters are so real. This is in contrast to the last three Star Wars films where the acting is so stilted and wooden, you don't care who gets killed or about anything else for that matter (note that I loved the original trilogy for the same reason as Firefly/Serenity..the way the cast chemistry worked). Humor, anger, angst, sadness...all of them ring true in the way they play off each other.Mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex-soldier who cares for his crew, but tolerates no challenge to his authority (but has a good sense of humor). Ron Glass does a great job as Shepard Book, it's hard not to like Kaylee the engineer and my favorite, tough guy Jayne (Alec Baldwin) who is by far the funniest character (""Uhhhh, I been workin' on a new plan. What say we shoot her first."").At the end of the day, that's what made this film/series so special. The characters are genuine and easy to care about. There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast. Every episode provided good action and comic relief. If I had to use one word to decribe the series/film, it would be ""fun.""I own over 600 DVDs and am a pretty serious movie buff. I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride.

951237,A3CWLBSGRN7N1W,B000BW7QWW,"Glenn Steinhilber ""gsdrew91""","[9, 13]","When Gene Roddenberry first pitched his concept for Star Trek to networks execs he presented it as ""a 'Wagon Train' to the stars"".  It is unclear whether Star Trek ever achieved that vision.  However, there is no doubt that Joss Wheedon did succeed when he created the television series ""Firefly"" and the current major motion picture ""Serenity"".The story so far.Five hundred years from now the earth is used up and humanity takes to the stars.  They discover hundreds of planets and moons that they terraform to become new earths.  Some of these planets are ""rich and flush with the new technology; some not so much"".  The Alliance tries to bring all planets under centralized control.There was some disagreement on that point.  A civil war ensued between the Alliance and the Independents. After the war many of the defeated Independents drifted to the outer reaches of the known universe (or simply the 'verse in Firefly-speak)  and they are made to get by with only the most basic of technology.Enter the crew of the cargo ship Serenity, an amiable and good hearted group of outlaws just trying to get by in a screwed up universe, I mean 'verse.The movie opens where the TV shows leaves off.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) has rescued his sister River (Summer Glau) from the clutches of the Alliance.  You see River is a prodigy and the Alliance has conducted experiments on her in an effort to enhance her abilities which has the side effect of leaving her psychotic.They take refuge on board Serenity but are pursued by an evil agent of the Alliance known only as ""The Operative"", played with icy panache by Chiwetel Ejiofor.  Ejifor's performance is one the best in the film and his is most memorable villain.We are then whisked off on a wild ride to discover the secrets of not only River's psychosis but also the awful truth behind the origins of the cannibalistic sub-humans known as ""The Reavers"".I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Though the special effects are good they are in no way in the class of Star Wars.  However, where Star Wars tends to fall flat in the areas of acting, story and dialogue ""Serenity"" wildly succeeds.  The story is well told and plotted and Wheedon suffuses the whole with moments of whit and humor.  Some of the best comic moments are reserved for engineer Kaylee Frye, played by the incredibly gorgeous Jewell Staite, and tough guy Jayne Cobb, played by the always reliable Adam Baldwin.The entire cast, which is lead by Nathan Fillion as Captain Malcolm Reynolds (think Robin Hood meets Han Solo), reprise their roles without missing a beat. Unlike some of the failed Star Trek movies, Wheedon does an excellent job of utilizing his entire cast in a way that never seems contrived. Each character is given their own unique moment in the film.  Other returning members of the cast include Gina Torres as first mate Zoe Washburn, Alan Turdyk as the pilot simply known as ""Wash"", Ron Glass as the intriguing clergyman Shepherd Book and the exotically beautiful Morena Baccarin as Ambassador Inara Serra.Another reason ""Serenity"" is so successful is the Wheedon resists the temptation to condescend to his audience and does not fall back on tired plot devices.  This leads to some surprising moments, including the deaths of two major characters.  Wheedon also does not succumb to the temptation to provide a romantic moment between Fillion and Baccarin.Fans of the television show should and I think will adore this movie.  It picks up and embellishes on the original episodes and provides a satisfying conclusion should this be the end of the line.  I certainly hope it is not and I have read that the entire cast has signed on for a sequel should ""Serenity"" prove sufficiently successful at the box office.If you have never watched the show before the movie provides enough backstory for you to jump right in and enjoy.  Some of the character bits will not be as meaningful but there is more than enough here for you to enjoy.  So please do all of us ""Firefly"" fans a favor see ""Serenity"" so that there might be a future for this great story and these great characters.",5,Serenity NOW!,1129334400,"10 15, 2005",2005,4102,"['When', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'first', 'pitched', 'concept', 'Star', 'Trek', 'networks', 'execs', 'presented', ""'Wagon"", 'Train', 'stars', 'unclear', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ever', 'achieved', 'vision', 'However', 'doubt', 'Joss', 'Wheedon', 'did', 'succeed', 'when', 'created', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'current', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Serenity', '.The', 'story', 'so', 'far.Five', 'hundred', 'years', 'now', 'earth', 'used', 'up', 'humanity', 'stars', 'discover', 'hundreds', 'planets', 'moons', 'terraform', 'become', 'new', 'earths', 'planets', 'are', 'rich', 'flush', 'new', 'technology', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Alliance', 'tries', 'bring', 'planets', 'centralized', 'control.There', 'was', 'disagreement', 'point', 'A', 'civil', 'war', 'ensued', 'Alliance', 'Independents', 'war', 'many', 'defeated', 'Independents', 'drifted', 'outer', 'known', 'universe', 'simply', ""'verse"", 'Firefly-speak', 'are', 'made', 'get', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'technology.Enter', 'crew', 'cargo', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'amiable', 'good', 'hearted', 'group', 'outlaws', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'screwed', 'up', 'universe', 'mean', ""'verse.The"", 'movie', 'where', 'TV', 'off', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'rescued', 'sister', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'clutches', 'Alliance', 'see', 'River', 'prodigy', 'Alliance', 'conducted', 'experiments', 'effort', 'enhance', 'abilities', 'side', 'effect', 'leaving', 'psychotic.They', 'take', 'refuge', 'board', 'Serenity', 'are', 'pursued', 'evil', 'agent', 'Alliance', 'known', 'only', 'Operative', 'played', 'icy', 'panache', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Ejifor', 'performance', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'villain.We', 'are', 'then', 'whisked', 'off', 'wild', 'ride', 'discover', 'secrets', 'not', 'only', 'River', 'psychosis', 'also', 'awful', 'truth', 'origins', 'cannibalistic', 'sub-humans', 'known', 'Reavers', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'way', 'class', 'Star', 'Wars', 'However', 'where', 'Star', 'Wars', 'fall', 'flat', 'areas', 'acting', 'story', 'dialogue', 'Serenity', 'wildly', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'plotted', 'Wheedon', 'whole', 'moments', 'whit', 'humor', 'best', 'comic', 'moments', 'are', 'reserved', 'engineer', 'Kaylee', 'Frye', 'played', 'incredibly', 'gorgeous', 'Jewell', 'Staite', 'tough', 'guy', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'played', 'always', 'reliable', 'Adam', 'Baldwin.The', 'entire', 'cast', 'lead', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'think', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'meets', 'Han', 'Solo', 'reprise', 'roles', 'missing', 'beat', 'failed', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'Wheedon', 'excellent', 'job', 'utilizing', 'entire', 'cast', 'way', 'never', 'contrived', 'character', 'given', 'own', 'unique', 'moment', 'film', 'Other', 'returning', 'members', 'cast', 'include', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'first', 'mate', 'Zoe', 'Washburn', 'Alan', 'Turdyk', 'pilot', 'simply', 'known', 'Wash', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'intriguing', 'clergyman', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'exotically', 'beautiful', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'Ambassador', 'Inara', 'Serra.Another', 'reason', 'Serenity', 'so', 'successful', 'Wheedon', 'temptation', 'condescend', 'audience', 'not', 'fall', 'back', 'tired', 'plot', 'devices', 'surprising', 'moments', 'including', 'deaths', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'Wheedon', 'also', 'not', 'succumb', 'temptation', 'provide', 'romantic', 'moment', 'Fillion', 'Baccarin.Fans', 'television', 'show', 'should', 'think', 'will', 'adore', 'movie', 'up', 'embellishes', 'original', 'episodes', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'should', 'be', 'end', 'line', 'certainly', 'hope', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'entire', 'cast', 'signed', 'sequel', 'should', 'Serenity', 'prove', 'sufficiently', 'successful', 'box', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'show', 'movie', 'enough', 'backstory', 'jump', 'right', 'enjoy', 'character', 'bits', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'meaningful', 'more', 'enough', 'here', 'enjoy', 'So', 'please', 'do', 'Firefly', 'favor', 'see', 'Serenity', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'future', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'characters']",N/A

It's a cheap trick, that's not storytelling.In the first ten minutes I found five or six instances that seemed to be ""quotes"" from other science fiction movies.

The story overall doesn't exactly remain taut, but it's difficult to fault the movie for that, given what it does achieve. It's a really good effort. You care about the characters. The captain of the Serenity is very, very good in his role. The girl that plays River has a creepy sexuality about her that's disturbing... kind of an Angelina Jolie f-me-and-I'll-kill-you vibe.Overall: BUY IT NOW WHILE IT'S STILL AVAILABLE.

I am proud to report that Serenity is a pretty good movie - not great, just pretty good. It gives the audience a reason to like the characters and care about what happens to them, which is something that all 14 episodes of Firefly completely failed to do. However, it tries to do so by playing the same few cards over and over, and constantly hearing the same old things being said gets tiresome. The story is very tightly told and has many very clever plot points. It also has some noticeable gaps and contrivances for the sake of convenience. The humor, of course, is very much Joss Whedon's uniquely brilliant brand, but as with Firefly, it's not abundant. The action sequences, though cool, aren't very original; one scene felt like a ripoff of the opening space battle in Revenge of the Sith, while the scene where River fights a horde of Reavers was too much like the Smith-Neo brawl in The Matrix Reloaded.

We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons. Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life. To be new Earths. The central planets formed The Alliance, ruled by an interplanetary parliament. The Alliance was a beacon of civilization. The savage outer planets were not so enlightened, and refused Alliance control. [At about here, you realize that this is sounding too much like a political ad, or maybe indoctrination. Then, sure enough, you see the speaker, a teacher standing in front of her young charges. She continues:]The war was devastating. But the Alliance's victory over the Independents insured a safer universe. And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization.""One of the students is the young River Tam. She tells the teacher why the Independents would have rebelled: ""We meddle ... People don't like to be meddled with. We tell them what to do. What to think. Don't run. Don't walk. We're in their homes and in their heads and we haven't the right.""It's not just the plot and acting of ""Serenity"" that are excellent. It is the way the story is told; how it unfolds. First the disembodied voice, which turns into the teacher, which turns into a memory of the now 17 year-old River the subject of terrible experiments, which turns into an archive video being watched by The Operative. And this all happens before the opening credits!The archive video is of Simon Tam rescuing his little sister, River, from the Alliance laboratory. And now the two are on the run from the Alliance, aboard the Serenity, a Firefly class transport ship. Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds was a Brown Coat, an Independent squashed by the Alliance. Now he's trying to make a living smuggling and salvaging, on the ship he named after the Plains of Serenity, the last great battle of the failed war of independence.It is a hard way to make a living. As Mal tells the unhappy Simon, ""I put this crew together with the promise of work, which the Alliance makes harder every year. Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to ship about at all. This job goes south, there well may not be another. So here's us, on the raggedy edge. Don't push me and I won't push you.""The themes of ""Serenity"" are universal, sometimes troubling. The dialogue is snappy. The humor is great and frequently campy. Our first view of the ship Serenity shows it in trouble. The pilot says, ""This landing is going to get pretty interesting.""The Captain looks at him: ""Define interesting.""Pilot: ""Oh God Oh God, we're all going to die?""I saw ""Serenity"" in the movie theater before we even knew of the prequel TV series, ""Firefly"". Now, we have both for home viewing, and I strongly recommend watching the TV series first, if possible. The movie does stand alone and gives you sufficient background.

""Somebody who would believe so strongly in what he was doing, that he would do anything. The exact opposite, of course, of the hero. In casting Chiwetel Ejidfor, we found the perfect person because he brings such depth and soulfulness and regret to everything he does.""Whedon says that he likes to cast comedians in drama roles. Comedy, he says, ""is the hard one."" If the actor can do comedy, then they can do drama.7.  Deleted Scenes (17 minutes) Interesting - one deleted scene showed the Operative researching Mal. He finds out that the Battle of Serenity had a 68% casualty rate for the Independents. Soldiers like Mal kept fighting for 2 weeks after the generals surrendered.8.  Outtakes (6 minutes)9.  ""Future History: The Story of Earth That Was"" (10 minutes) Joss Whedon tells how he came up with this version of the future, which is supposed to be 500 years from now. For example, there are two universal languages used, English and Chinese. In Joss's imagined future, these two superpowers merged when Earth set out to colonize.It's also interesting how he ""chose"" his hero: ""I just wanted to tell a story about people who are living in space, but not living in grandeur. And not living in great portent, but were more the fringe people.

The people we all like to be identified with, we're all interested in, is the South, because we love losers.""10.  ""What's in a Firefly"" (10 minutes) Fascinating look at how they worked scenes, such as the mule skip chase scene after the beginning bank robbery. Both CG and visual effects people explain how it was done.11. ""Re-lighting the Firefly"" (25 minutes, from 2005) The story of how Joss Whedon and others pulled together a film to tell the story that was left unfinished in the prematurely cancelled TV series. Commentators include Whedon and most of the ""Firefly"" cast. The most memorable moment was the San Diego ComicCon, after the show's cancellation and before the movie was finished. On the last half of the last day of the convention, 5,000 people showed up to see Josh and the cast.12. Joss Whedon Introdution (6 minutes) This is Whedon's introduction to a draft of the movie (not the final cut).Excellent, excellent film.

I had seen it once at that time and had thought it was indeed very good and that it was certainly better than any of the Star Wars prequels.  But that's like saying filet mignon is better than hamburger.  So I went to see it a couple more times.  Then it clicked.  This movie is so detailed and nuanced that it can only truly be appreciated after multiple viewings.  There's simply too much going on at once, both visually and aurally, to fully grasp the complexity of this film in one sitting.  This, of course, makes it the ideal movie to purchase on dvd.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but come to appreciate it more and more each time you see it.

Kikkert ""HKikkert""","[9, 11]","First off, I want to warn everyone that I am not going to reveal any of the specific happenings of the movie in this review, because someone will shoot me in my sleep for spoiling it.Although my sister watches many of Whedon's television series, I myself do not. Unfortunately, she is not a big sci-fi outer-space type person, otherwise I would have been an avid `Firefly' fan a lot sooner. I discovered the show on DVD well after it had been canceled, when I was pre-ordering the prematurely canceled `Wonderfalls' series on Amazon. Many of the people who rated Wonderfalls mentioned how FOX had canned their 2 best shows before giving them a fair chance, and named Firefly as the other of FOX's major  bubble follies. This intrigued me, so I read a lot of the Amazon reviews for `Firefly'. After seeing that even though quite a few people gave it 0-1 stars, it still came out on top of 550+ reviews with an astounding 5 stars, so I ordered it as well. I was not disappointed in the least. It started out a bit slow over the first couple of episodes, but what show doesn't while trying to introduce all of their characters and get the plot going without totally confusing the viewers? After the first few episodes, I was totally hooked. The special effects of the series, as well as the movie, might not be up to par with Star Wars, but that combined with the perfect cast members, are what make it all the more realistic and believable. I truly can not decide if I like the show or the movie better, but that's a good thing, isn't it? In my opinion, they are both most excellent.When I first saw the `Serenity' trailer, it appeared that Whedon had remade a lot of the previous tv series so that it was big screen worthy and easier for the audience who had never seen the show to follow, but boy was I wrong. He actually just gave supplemental information from what had already been revealed on the show, which in effect answered all the previously posed questions. Instead of that creating a true ending, I am hoping tying up all of the loose ends gives Joss more flexibility for incorporating new ideas into possible upcoming Serenity flicks. And may there be many more to come.",5,Truly Superb!,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",2005,2181,"['First', 'want', 'warn', 'everyone', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'specific', 'happenings', 'movie', 'review', 'someone', 'will', 'shoot', 'sleep', 'spoiling', 'it.Although', 'sister', 'watches', 'many', 'Whedon', 'television', 'series', 'do', 'not', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'big', 'sci-fi', 'outer-space', 'type', 'person', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'avid', 'Firefly', 'fan', 'lot', 'sooner', 'discovered', 'show', 'DVD', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'canceled', 'when', 'was', 'pre-ordering', 'prematurely', 'canceled', 'Wonderfalls', 'series', 'Amazon', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'rated', 'Wonderfalls', 'mentioned', 'how', 'FOX', 'had', 'canned', '2', 'best', 'shows', 'giving', 'fair', 'chance', 'named', 'Firefly', 'other', 'FOX', 'major', 'bubble', 'follies', 'intrigued', 'so', 'read', 'lot', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'Firefly', 'seeing', 'even', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'gave', '0-1', 'stars', 'still', 'came', 'out', 'top', '550+', 'reviews', 'astounding', '5', 'stars', 'ordered', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'least', 'started', 'out', 'bit', 'slow', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'what', 'show', ""n't"", 'while', 'trying', 'introduce', 'characters', 'get', 'plot', 'going', 'totally', 'confusing', 'viewers', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'was', 'totally', 'hooked', 'special', 'effects', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'up', 'par', 'Star', 'Wars', 'combined', 'perfect', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'like', 'show', 'movie', 'better', 'good', 'thing', ""n't"", 'opinion', 'are', 'most', 'excellent.When', 'first', 'saw', 'Serenity', 'trailer', 'appeared', 'Whedon', 'had', 'remade', 'lot', 'previous', 'tv', 'series', 'was', 'big', 'screen', 'worthy', 'easier', 'audience', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'follow', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'actually', 'just', 'gave', 'supplemental', 'information', 'what', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'revealed', 'show', 'effect', 'answered', 'previously', 'posed', 'questions', 'Instead', 'creating', 'true', 'ending', 'am', 'hoping', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Joss', 'more', 'flexibility', 'incorporating', 'new', 'ideas', 'possible', 'upcoming', 'Serenity', 'flicks', 'may', 'there', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'come']",N/A

951262,A2QRIAGC06TE7J,B000BW7QWW,"H. J. Matthews ""Soccer Dad""","[2, 2]","The decision on this movie is simple.  If you are a fan of the Firefly TV series, you must see this movie.  It brings to conclusion several (but not all) of the long-term sub-plots introduced in the series.  If you are not a fan, this movie is just so-so because you won't understand why certain events and interactions are significant without knowing the character development of past episodes.If you have never seen the Firefly series, consider getting into it.  It's that good.  For just under $20 I bought the entire series as a collector set from Amazon in late June, 2008.  On four DVDs it's the entire single season that aired and was tragically cancelled before anyone knew it had begun.  The Firefly series and its conclusion movie Serenity are a wonderful combination of the action-packed sci-fi/space and western genres - all presented with witty conversations, wonderful characters, and hilarious situations that have viewers literally laughing out loud again and again.To better understand this recommendation, pick a favorite TV series with funny characters.  For illustration, I'll pick Everybody Loves Raymond.  Now imagine the charcters buy the space ship equivalent of a yacht and travel together to remote planets so early in their settlement they resemble western frontier territories.  Even if the plot, special effects, and action made a first-rate movie, it's the funny characters playing it out that would make this hypothetical movie tremendously entertaining.  Using my example: when Marie and Debra Barrone argue about cooking in the ship's galley, and then Raymond gets a larger slice of pie than Robert, it's a lot funnier if you already know those characters from the TV series.The Serenity movie is similar to the example above.  It's OK in its own right, but tons better if you know the characters from the Firefly series.  It's a little worse in the case of Serentiy because the setting requires some Firefly background to make sense.  A Star Trek movie wouldn't make complete sense if you hadn't watched the series enough to understand that Klingons are always war-like, Romulans routinely use cloaking devices, and the Federation is guided by the Prime Directive.  Firefly similarly creates a universe setting with its own ""rules"", and the Serenity movie just can't take the time to explain it all again.In conclusion:1.  If you've watched Firefly, buy the Serenity movie.2.  If you haven't watched Firefly, buy the Firefly series and then watch the Serenity movie.  You'll be glad you did, on both counts.3.  If you haven't watched Firefly and won't follow #2 above, then don't buy the Serenity movie.",5,Firefly fans only,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,2637,"['decision', 'movie', 'simple', 'are', 'fan', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'series', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'several', 'not', 'long-term', 'sub-plots', 'introduced', 'series', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'movie', 'just', 'so-so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'certain', 'events', 'interactions', 'are', 'significant', 'knowing', 'character', 'development', 'past', 'episodes.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Firefly', 'series', 'consider', 'getting', 'good', 'just', '20', 'bought', 'entire', 'series', 'collector', 'set', 'Amazon', 'late', 'June', '2008', 'four', 'DVDs', 'entire', 'single', 'season', 'aired', 'was', 'tragically', 'cancelled', 'anyone', 'knew', 'had', 'begun', 'Firefly', 'series', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'are', 'wonderful', 'combination', 'action-packed', 'sci-fi/space', 'western', 'genres', 'presented', 'witty', 'conversations', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'hilarious', 'situations', 'have', 'viewers', 'literally', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'again', 'again.To', 'better', 'understand', 'recommendation', 'pick', 'favorite', 'TV', 'series', 'funny', 'characters', 'illustration', ""'ll"", 'pick', 'Everybody', 'Loves', 'Raymond', 'Now', 'imagine', 'charcters', 'buy', 'space', 'ship', 'equivalent', 'yacht', 'travel', 'together', 'remote', 'planets', 'so', 'early', 'settlement', 'resemble', 'western', 'frontier', 'territories', 'Even', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'made', 'first-rate', 'movie', 'funny', 'characters', 'playing', 'would', 'make', 'hypothetical', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'entertaining', 'Using', 'example', 'when', 'Marie', 'Debra', 'Barrone', 'argue', 'cooking', 'ship', 'galley', 'then', 'Raymond', 'larger', 'slice', 'pie', 'Robert', 'lot', 'funnier', 'already', 'know', 'characters', 'TV', 'series.The', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'similar', 'example', 'OK', 'own', 'right', 'tons', 'better', 'know', 'characters', 'Firefly', 'series', 'little', 'worse', 'case', 'Serentiy', 'setting', 'Firefly', 'background', 'make', 'sense', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'complete', 'sense', 'had', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'enough', 'understand', 'Klingons', 'are', 'always', 'war-like', 'Romulans', 'routinely', 'use', 'cloaking', 'devices', 'Federation', 'guided', 'Prime', 'Directive', 'Firefly', 'similarly', 'universe', 'setting', 'own', 'rules', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'again.In', 'conclusion:1', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Firefly', 'buy', 'Serenity', 'movie.2', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Firefly', 'buy', 'Firefly', 'series', 'then', 'watch', 'Serenity', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'counts.3', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Firefly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'follow', '2', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Serenity', 'movie']",N/A

Mal does get a bit more serious in this movie, as there isn't quite as much of the lightheartedness that there was in Firefly.  He and Inara can still manage to bicker though, even while under duress.  I loved Star Trek, enjoyed Star Wars, but this series surpasses both of them for me.

951284,AZBME7LBPMF7W,B000BW7QWW,"Jakob Ambrose ""Jake""","[0, 3]","What made Firefly a chore to sit through was the fact that it did not have a focus. It felt like it was meandering for far too long first episode before it made an effort to tell a season narrative. I mean the actual first episode and not the train robbery. The episodes were disjointed and written by someone that did not have an clue what he wanted to do with the series. Had Whedon figured out a direction before the first episode was penned and stayed with it, then it might have done better with the science fiction audience. Instead, he produced D work and it only has appeal to his fans and no one else.Serenity, on the other hand is everything that Firefly should have been. Yes, I like the movie and hate the series it was based on, something a lot more common that you think. The movie did more things right than the series. It had a clear focus that went somewhere. We understood the goal of the story and it did not waver from it. Every line of dialog added to the story and was not a wasted, look at how clever I am, bit of witty banter that makes non Whedonites want to strangle themselves. Even the story made a sort of sense that worked within the universe and did not reference anything else.The best part of the script is that it trusted itself enough to not waste time explaining how things work in the universe. It told the audience just enough to understand and follow it. All I needed to know about, namely the main characters, their allies, the bad guys and what happened before the series was summed up nicely in the first act. It did not waste time with being clever and told a compelling story. While it did not compel me to seek out the series afterwards, I did not feel like my intelligence was insulted by this movie.Unfortunately, when I did seek out Firefly, it felt more like a waste of time than anything insightful. The series was not nearly a tenth as good as the movie. The series fell into the same trap that all of Whedon's creations fall into. It did not trust the audience to get what it was trying to do. Instead, it meanders around in the dark wasting eight or nine valuable episodes building a universe instead of creating a compelling storyline with character development and a destination. The science fiction audience is a lot smarter than Whedon gave us credit for and would have accepted a lot with the just go with it explanation. We did not need witty asides, clever banter, or incoherent plot threads. He just needed to trust us to get it and not hold our hand through the series.What's even more infuriating is that Whedon's squandered a chance to make Firefly good by doing what he did with Buffy and Angel. He wasted too many episodes with world building and not providing a good story. In the same amount of episodes that Whedon typically wastes, other producers and writers could come up with 3 dimensional characters, believable universes, and great story lines and build to a logical conclusion. That's the difference between good writers and Whedon. Whedon takes 13 episodes to lay down the foundations of the universe, something that he should have done before filming the first episode.",4,Everything Firefly should have been,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,3147,"['What', 'made', 'Firefly', 'chore', 'sit', 'was', 'fact', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'focus', 'felt', 'was', 'meandering', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'episode', 'made', 'effort', 'tell', 'season', 'narrative', 'mean', 'actual', 'first', 'episode', 'not', 'train', 'robbery', 'episodes', 'were', 'disjointed', 'written', 'someone', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'series', 'Had', 'Whedon', 'figured', 'out', 'direction', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'penned', 'stayed', 'then', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'science', 'fiction', 'audience', 'Instead', 'produced', 'D', 'work', 'only', 'appeal', 'fans', 'one', 'else.Serenity', 'other', 'hand', 'everything', 'Firefly', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Yes', 'like', 'movie', 'hate', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'common', 'think', 'movie', 'did', 'more', 'things', 'right', 'series', 'had', 'clear', 'focus', 'went', 'somewhere', 'understood', 'goal', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'waver', 'line', 'dialog', 'added', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'wasted', 'look', 'how', 'clever', 'am', 'bit', 'witty', 'banter', 'non', 'Whedonites', 'want', 'strangle', 'Even', 'story', 'made', 'sort', 'sense', 'worked', 'universe', 'did', 'not', 'reference', 'anything', 'else.The', 'best', 'part', 'script', 'trusted', 'enough', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'explaining', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'universe', 'told', 'audience', 'just', 'enough', 'understand', 'follow', 'needed', 'know', 'about', 'namely', 'main', 'characters', 'allies', 'bad', 'guys', 'what', 'happened', 'series', 'was', 'summed', 'up', 'nicely', 'first', 'act', 'did', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'being', 'clever', 'told', 'compelling', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'compel', 'seek', 'out', 'series', 'afterwards', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'intelligence', 'was', 'insulted', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'when', 'did', 'seek', 'out', 'Firefly', 'felt', 'more', 'waste', 'time', 'anything', 'insightful', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'tenth', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'series', 'fell', 'same', 'trap', 'Whedon', 'creations', 'fall', 'did', 'not', 'trust', 'audience', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'Instead', 'around', 'dark', 'wasting', 'eight', 'nine', 'valuable', 'episodes', 'building', 'universe', 'instead', 'creating', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'character', 'development', 'destination', 'science', 'fiction', 'audience', 'lot', 'smarter', 'Whedon', 'gave', 'credit', 'would', 'have', 'accepted', 'lot', 'just', 'go', 'explanation', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'witty', 'asides', 'clever', 'banter', 'incoherent', 'plot', 'threads', 'just', 'needed', 'trust', 'get', 'not', 'hold', 'hand', 'series.What', 'even', 'more', 'infuriating', 'Whedon', 'squandered', 'chance', 'make', 'Firefly', 'good', 'doing', 'what', 'did', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'wasted', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'world', 'building', 'not', 'providing', 'good', 'story', 'same', 'amount', 'episodes', 'Whedon', 'typically', 'other', 'producers', 'writers', 'could', 'come', 'up', '3', 'dimensional', 'characters', 'believable', 'universes', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'build', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'difference', 'good', 'writers', 'Whedon', 'Whedon', '13', 'episodes', 'lay', 'down', 'foundations', 'universe', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'filming', 'first', 'episode']",N/A

That being said, you can watch this movie and still get a kick out of it without watching the television show, but I would recommend watching the first season if you've got a lot of time on your hands.  It was a five-star show that got cancelled well before its prime.  There was a central plot to the show and that plot is finally resolved in this movie.The movie is fantastic!  And it did quite well (better than anybody expected) at the box office which goes to show that the series should have had a few more years in it.  This is Sci-Fi at its finest, even though it does have quite a Western/Frontier feel to it.  It was nice to see Firefly upgraded with a more decent budget for the special effects.  And they didn't go too overboard with the special effects so that it distracted from the story.The characters were right on.  Nobody was out of character at all from the series.  But you can tell that this was written to finalize the series as some of the crew do end up dieing.  It probably made this movie better, not trying to work a storyline for a sequel into it, but it is heartbreaking to watch a few people we care about die.This movie is very highly recommended whether you've seen the series or not.

Picht,"[4, 4]","I'm a fan of science fiction films, but I'd be the first to admit that the genre is deservedly under-represented on most ""best films of the decade"" lists. Does Serenity belong on those lists? Not if you think great film is always high art. But Serenity does what too few Great Films get around to doing - it tells an exciting and interesting story, it builds suspense, it makes you care about the characters, it leaves you drained and satisfied at the end. If Serenity isn't Great Art, it is superlative entertainment.The dialogue isn't great art. It is, however, witty, brisk, and effective. The acting isn't brilliant, but the actors enjoy what they're doing and imbue their characters with believable humanity in over-the-top unbelievable situations. The special effects are good, but they don't overshaddow the actors and they aren't the point of the film. The story is the point, and the story is a very, very good one. And it's told very, very well.The movie begins with a computer simulation/recreation of a brother's attempt to save his sister from some seriously bad government bad guys. We understand almost immediately that these two siblings are devoted to each other. When the computer recreation ends we meet the film's chief bad guy. Within minutes we realize that this is one of those really scary villains, the kind who knows that what he does is bad but believes he's doing it for the very best cause. He's not a casual killer, but he can easily kill anyone, any number of anyones, for the sake of his cause. That sense of ultimate virtue drives him until the final minutes of the film.The film is space opera. A brave but damaged spaceship captain and his daring but badly flawed crew have taken in the siblings and flee with them across the galaxy as they try to stay out of harm's way. Death and ruin follow wherever they go. Will they prevail in the end and strike a blow against the interstellar government? Of course they will. We know that from the beginning. It's a testament to the creative skill of the director and writer that we know that and are kept at the edges of our seats anyway. This is space opera as it should be, sci fi at its very best. It's a morality play with none of the philosophical, moral, or artistic pretentiousness that afflict most sci fi that tries to be Art. It's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. And it's a fitting continuation of the grossly underrated TV series that spawned it, Firefly.This collector's edition has some entertaining features that weren't included in the original DVD release of the film. I enjoyed watching it at a friend's house, but I won't replace my own copy until I upgrade my DVD player. It isn't worth it to me to spend $17 for the extra features. Given the choice between the collector's edition and the regular edition, though, the price differential would make this edition worth buying to me.

I watched the first half an hour and thought to myself what a bad straight from UPN (or WB, whatever network ""Firefly"" was on) but thankfully it got a lot better once the action really started. As far as Sci-Fi goes, there usually aren't a lot of good movies out there; sure every now and again you'll get your ""Matrix"" or ""Alien"" or even ""Predator"" but typically they're low budget affairs that have horrible acting and even worse cinematography. While the dialogue throughout ""Serenity"" was cheesy and comedic (Captain Malcolm Reynolds reminded me of the captain prince hero from Mel Brooks' ""Space Balls""), the action was great and the storyline was compelling. And a virgin viewer of this movie whom had never seen nor heard of ""Firefly"" can still follow the plot without struggle. But what really stood out for me was how intriguing the cinematography was; the galaxy was etched well as were all of the sets on the ground. You won't find any big name movie stars here, unless you count Adam Baldwin (based on his last name and not his acting skills of course), but I will tell you that Yan and Rafael Feldman are NOT related to Corey!

951302,A2PIX2K56IZZYX,B000BW7QWW,Jason W. Kaiser,"[4, 5]","I had no idea what to expect with this, good sci-fi movie's are so hard to find these days, plus I had never seen any of the short-lived TV series 'Firefly' which this was based on. Well, I'm happy to report that not only do you not need to have seen the series to follow this, but you're going to have a real good time watching this. It is really done well, strong action and acting with some perfectly timed comedic touches. It is two hours long, but I was actually wishing it had been a little longer as I was that into it. I'm probably going to get torched for this, but I'd pick this over the last Star Wars just slightly, which was the last decent sci-fi I'd seen before Serenity.Keep this name in mind, Summer Glau, she plays River, the whole movie is pretty much based around her, and she is one hell of an actress, plus the girl has some incredible fight scenes that will knock your socks off. I'm sure she had some training and a stunt double, but even if that means she only performed half of the stunts, it's still pretty impressive. Nathan Fillion plays Reynolds, the captain of his ship 'Serenity' and I know once you see him you'll recognize him, he was the husband of the girl in 'Two guys, a girl, and a pizza place. He too is very solid, both charming and intense when need be. Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays the main bad guy from The Alliance, a group that wants the powerfull River all to themselves, but can't seem to catch up with Reynolds and his crew who River and her brother are flying with. He shows no emotion, you almost think he might be an android, but he to can kick alot of butt, and his fight scene toward the end with Captain Reynolds is quite a watch.The rest of Reynolds crew are all very good, including Adam Baldwin, who plays Jayne, and some of his back-and-forth with Reynolds is priceless. Also, the movie looks great, no grain, great sound, outstanding sets and locations, and the battle scenes between the spaceships does rival some of the best Star Wars endings. It is surprisingly violent for a PG-13, and also has lots of salty languange, I'd say 14 years old and above should be fine. I'm not going to go into much of the plot, mostly because it's rather complicated and I don't want to ruin anything for anyone who wants to rent Firefly first before watching this. My only complaint is the man who plays River's brother is a real wuss, and I didn't care for his character at all, it may or may not be the actor's fault, but it sucked. He whines alot and gets his assed kicked severall times by both the good guys and the bad........wuss.I'm not sure why Hollywood doesn't seem to into sci-fi's anymore, but it was real refreshing to not only see one, but a good one at that. Although they tied most of the loose ends up, I have heard rumors that a sequel is being discussed, mostly because it was such a surprise at the box-office. But if you think about, why was it such a surprise? there are so many sci-fi fans out there, and so few movies, you are almost guaranteed success if you even make a crappy one. Well, I rented Red Eye with this, so I'll be back soon with some thoughts on Wes Craven'a latest suspense ride, until then, take care all......",4,Great Sci-Fi Fun Here....................,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3233,"['had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'days', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', ""'Firefly"", 'was', 'based', 'Well', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'follow', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'real', 'good', 'time', 'watching', 'really', 'done', 'well', 'strong', 'action', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'comedic', 'touches', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'was', 'actually', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'was', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'get', 'torched', ""'d"", 'pick', 'last', 'Star', 'Wars', 'just', 'slightly', 'was', 'last', 'decent', 'sci-fi', ""'d"", 'seen', 'before', 'Serenity.Keep', 'name', 'mind', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'River', 'whole', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'based', 'one', 'hell', 'actress', 'girl', 'incredible', 'fight', 'scenes', 'will', 'knock', 'socks', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'training', 'stunt', 'double', 'even', 'only', 'performed', 'half', 'stunts', 'still', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Reynolds', 'captain', 'ship', ""'Serenity"", 'know', 'once', 'see', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'was', 'husband', 'girl', ""'Two"", 'guys', 'girl', 'pizza', 'place', 'too', 'very', 'solid', 'charming', 'intense', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'fine', 'performance', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'Alliance', 'group', 'powerfull', 'River', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'up', 'Reynolds', 'crew', 'who', 'River', 'brother', 'are', 'flying', 'emotion', 'almost', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'android', 'can', 'kick', 'alot', 'butt', 'fight', 'scene', 'end', 'Captain', 'Reynolds', 'quite', 'watch.The', 'rest', 'Reynolds', 'crew', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'including', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'who', 'Jayne', 'back-and-forth', 'Reynolds', 'priceless', 'Also', 'movie', 'great', 'grain', 'great', 'sound', 'outstanding', 'sets', 'locations', 'battle', 'scenes', 'spaceships', 'rival', 'best', 'Star', 'Wars', 'surprisingly', 'violent', 'PG-13', 'also', 'lots', 'salty', 'languange', ""'d"", 'say', '14', 'years', 'old', 'above', 'should', 'be', 'fine', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'much', 'plot', 'mostly', 'rather', 'complicated', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'anything', 'anyone', 'who', 'rent', 'Firefly', 'first', 'before', 'watching', 'only', 'complaint', 'man', 'who', 'River', 'brother', 'real', 'wuss', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'character', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'actor', 'fault', 'sucked', 'alot', 'assed', 'kicked', 'severall', 'times', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', '..wuss.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sci-fi', 'anymore', 'was', 'real', 'refreshing', 'not', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'tied', 'most', 'loose', 'up', 'have', 'heard', 'rumors', 'sequel', 'being', 'discussed', 'mostly', 'was', 'such', 'surprise', 'box-office', 'think', 'why', 'was', 'surprise', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'there', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'almost', 'guaranteed', 'success', 'even', 'make', 'crappy', 'one', 'Well', 'rented', 'Red', 'Eye', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'soon', 'thoughts', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'latest', 'suspense', 'ride', 'then', 'take', 'care']",N/A

Well, I had heard about it, but it disappeared before my age/maturity came about in order to truely understand it.  I never watched it... there, I said it.  Putting all that aside though;Serenity has by far been the best movie I've seen in quite some time.  That's not to say that other movies aren't as good, but this movie had everything I'd been looking for.  Futuristic Sci-Fi, gun fights, space-ships, zombie-like creatures, a ninja(what else would you call him?), and good old mature humor.The story of Serenity, as seen by someone who has not experienced Firefly yet, can be seen as a story of freedom.  Several people crew a ship, Serenity, and fly around space committing random felonies for money.  Though they are ""bank robbers"" they are not ruthless people.  They simply look-out for themselves and those closest to them.  It's shown that they do care about people in general through-out the movie, but they tend to only look out for those that fly with them.I won't get too into the storyline (I do have to get back to work =P), but I can assure you that other reviews have.  My reasons for this review are simply to let you know that the movie doesn't have to have a rapper in it to be good.  It doesn't need a truck-load of big names to be good.  It doesn't need a lot of dramatic pauses and tacked-on Hollywood messages to be good.What a move needs to be good is what Serenity has to offer.  Greats actors and actresses that work well together off screen and on screen.  One deep and constant message instead of several messages thrown together.  Zombie-like creatures.  And the desire to make you seek humanity where ever you can find it.If you're more in to Honda's with three foot spoilers and cheesey lines about racing, you probably won't like this movie... you've probably never even heard of it.  But for the ""some of us""... the ""please, God, not another car chase!""s... the ""just cause he can rap doesn't mean he can act""s... the ""if it's got that much hype, it'll probably suck""s among us, I recommend this movie.

It's very Whedon-y. Second, my review is going to be extremely slanted because I do GET and thoroughly enjoy Whedon's universe. So, assuming that you've never seen an episode of Firefly, but that you are acquainted with the Buffy Universe you'll understand that sarcasm, unexpected humor in dark situations, girl power, and smarm are all part of the charm that is Serenity. It's more blatantly a ""space western"" than even Star Wars was. It is literally young man go terraform a planet instead of young man go west. The government is a bad thing, the government wants to control how you think, feel, and behave. Some people, like Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew don't hold to that. Psychic River Tam was experimented on by the government and was rescued by her brother Simon but not before she learned a horrible secret from certain members of Parliament that they don't want the general populous to know. Now, The Operative is chasing River and the whole crew of Serenity and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Mal is a good man with his own unique code. He's a thief along the Robin Hood vein, if Robin Hood kept the loot for himself rather than giving it to the poor. But he's knows right from wrong and he believes in something greater than himself even if it takes the entire movie for him to understand that quality in himself. In short, the bad guys get it, the good guys don't come out unscathed and it's a completely satisfying end to a series that I wish had never been cancelled.

I have read so many reviews and heard so much from those who are familiar with the background of this movie, and almost all say you do NOT have to know anything about all that to understand and appreciate 'Serenity'.  I say BS.  As the movie began I felt like I had come in 20 minutes AFTER it had started.  It took a while for me to pick up what was going on and I really don't think I am stupid.For some to call this a modern-day Star Wars is an Injustice to that masterpiece.  Sure, many will say that 'Time will tell' regarding that statement...but I think the box-office numbers are already saying that FOR me.  I don't CARE if Ebert & Roeper gave the film two thumbs up (which they apparently did), the movie was okay at best, and without being really well versed with the back-story in the plot and where it all came from, this movie simply did not ""Do It"" for me.  I honestly wish that it had, but sorry, it just didn't.Aside from all of that, there WERE some genuinely entertaining moments throughout the film.  The special effects were by and large pretty good (which I am a real stickler about noticing).  Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie (for the most part anyway) I felt that all the characters were well cast and the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me in the least.  Surprisingly funny moments came out of left field on occasion which made the experience much better than it would have otherwise.  On the whole, I guess for those who are better acquianted with the movie and how it came to be, this is probably wonderful, and I can see many really enjoying it -- however for those of us who are NOT aware of all that, be prepared to be confused from the get-go.

The movie can be enjoyed without seeing the series, but the film does a great job of explaining the background of the series and tying up plot lines.The dialog is witty.

951315,A2BC978GQQEA2A,B000BW7QWW,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[23, 60]","Not too long ago, Joss Whedon - the creator of the popular television show, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - had another show on the air called ""Firefly"". It was a western by way of science fiction, and (due to an erratic broadcast order, some would say) it was cancelled before all of its first season episodes were aired. Like many other shows, it developed a devoted following, the series as it stood was released on DVD, and that, you might say, was that.Universal Pictures has decided to gamble on ""Serenity"", a feature film version of the show directed by its creator. Mr. Whedon insisted on retaining all of the cast members, and from what I've heard from fans, the film fits well in the program's narrative continuity. Happily, though, it's not a film that preaches exclusively to the converted.The plot focuses on River (Summer Glau), a 18-year-old being conditioned by the Alliance, a passive-agressive version of the Empire in ""Star Wars"". Much like her doppleganger Buffy, she has extrodinary fighting abilites, but it's her psychic powers that interest The Alliance the most -- River may contain information that would be incriminating to them. Her brother Simon Tam (Sean Maher) rescues her from their brainwashing, and as the film begins, they're passengers aboard the good ship Serenity.The crew - Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillin), his right hand woman Zoe (Gina Torres), her pilot husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), the Willow-like mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), and hotheaded lunk Jayne (Adam Baldwin) - make their living by pulling small heists here and there, Butch-and-Sundance-style, on the less developed planets. In addition to the usual hazards of larceny, these areas are also rife with the Reivers, savage cannibals who rape and devour their victims alive.Like Han Solo, Malcolm is not too concerned with the political repercussions of his choice of passengers. He mainly sees River as a sort of living Fuzzbuster, potentially able to warn them of danger. However, his crew is starting to chafe with the closeness of space travel. The ship needs repairs, everyone is broke, and Kaylee is bluntly in need of shore leave. The mood of the Serenity is anything but.Unfortunately, the procedures that River has been subjected to have left her unstable, and she begins to have unpredictable, violent episodes. This, coupled with the pursuit of The Operative, an assassin sent by The Alliance to recover her and destroy her comrades, keeps the Serenity in a escalating squeeze play through the rest of the film.""Serenity"" doesn't quite free itself from its television origins as successfully as, say, ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" or ""The Fugitive"". There's a lot of characters and plot to set up, and the first half hour is weighted with talky exposition. While the dialogue is snappy, the abundance of one-liners leaves the characters sounding anachronistic (most of the folksy flourishes sound awkward), and very similar to one another. Perhaps due to their premature cancellation, the performers haven't yet developed the vivid personality contrasts that can make an ensemble so much fun. There's an estranged love interest for the captain (Inara, played by Morena Baccarin), but she has little to do aside from joining the cast for a sequel.Things pick up in the second half, though, once the set-up is out of the way and we can get to the space battles and hand-to hand combat. The action sequences are a bit choppy, but they are brisk and have a nice sense of scale to them without being overwheming.

951318,A2ZWYRK9LRMTBJ,B000BW7QWW,"Jeff S. Martin ""Jeffrey Stuart Martin""","[39, 42]","It would be superficial to say that Serenity is a science fiction movie. Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.The plot: Malcolm, captain of the space-ship Serenity and his crew are doing their usual gallivanting around in space, trying to eke out a living in a politically hostile environment, with one difference: their crew is temporarily supplemented by a young doctor (Simon) and his mentally unstable, but very telepathic, younger sister, River. Simon and River are fugitives from the afore-mentioned political hostility, embodied by a sword-wielding man known as ""the Operative"". The crew, the fugitives, the government, and a group of very evil secondary villains called Reavers, provide a magnificent cast of characters whose conflict (and other interactions, but mostly conflict) kept me spellbound for the entire movie.I've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either.  Reflecting on the movie afterwards, I kept finding similarities to Star Trek: Voyager.  Both shows focus on a small ship and her rag-tag crew. The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good.  However, I liked Serenity much more than I ever liked Voyager because it was so much more real and alive.  Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters.  Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness.  Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys.  The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.In the last few years a lot of science fiction and fantasy movies have had two things:  lots of characters with British accents, and cheesy lines.  Serenity once again leaves its competitors in the dust by transcending all predictability by using fairly neutral, Chinese, and American accents, as well as a British accent from India.  Instead of cheesy lines, it goes for totally-unexpected-and-hilarious, such as: ""Been more'n a year since I had anything twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!""  There is no denying that the language is odd, and it may take you a while to get used to it.  But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to!  The odd terminology and turns of phrase drive home the fact that this is not just another sci-fi copy.(Spoiler alert!) A popular phrase in screen-writing these days is ""action that tells the story"". I first remember seeing this concept in The Bourne Identity. Serenity does an even better job because it has an even more interesting motivation for violence, and it juggles multiple action characters. If you've read anything about the history of Serenity you already know that River has some amazing skills. She is also a very attractive young woman. In an average movie, a young male viewer (such as myself) might be inclined to focus on the person on screen more than on her character. In this case, River's character is so incredibly fascinating that you can't help but focus on her character. She is complex, she invokes sympathy, and she has more dimensions than the average human, let alone movie character. Although Malcolm and his crew seem like the main characters of the movie, it is ultimately River who steals the show.  (End spoiler).I've always assumed that if you notice computer graphics in a movie, it is because they are badly done.  Serenity dashed this theory for me.  The three or four times I noticed effects elements, they didn't take center stage or in any way distract from the movie.  They simply communicated the necessary information to the audience and then got out of the way and let the story continue.  The shots of planets were extremely beautiful; an excellent counterpoint to other, more disturbing, images in the movie.As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror.  The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination. The Reavers are a hideous and evil ""people"" whose presence could easily have been overplayed for shock value. But the film judiciously cuts around them, never showing more than a glimpse of their horrible faces. In place of these images are lines such as, ""You know he's better off dead than what the Reavers would have done to him."" Once again, the movie is about the characters, rather than about something as superficial as Reaver make-up.I can only think of one negative thing to say about Serenity: There were a few times during big action scenes when two characters would hold an important (and usually emotional) conversation. Obviously, in terms of sound mixing, you have to turn the environmental sounds down so that you can hear the dialog, but I think they went too far.  Two or three times, the contrast of these suddenly quiet conversations broke the mood for me.On the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot. Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head. In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it. I didn't grow up watching movies, so I have often found myself a little confused when movies do things like this. In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.Serenity is an excellent movie.  It might be a little confusing at first, but if you are a action movie fan or science-fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story-telling, you will like it.Note: For the few who don't know, Serenity is based on the TV series Firefly.  When I watched Serenity, I had never seen Firefly, but I still loved the movie!  Since then, I have watched most of the Firefly series.  All the praise I have given the movie also applies to the TV series.",5,Transcends all genres!,1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,6039,"['would', 'be', 'superficial', 'say', 'Serenity', 'science',

951319,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B000BW7QWW,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[3, 4]","With the cult fan success of the TV Series Firefly, Joss Whedon's OTHER labor of love (the first being the TV Series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), found life even after cancellation.  In what is a rare occurrence where a TV show is cancelled and then made into a major motion picture Firefly, aptly re-named Serenity, pushed forward and finished on most levels what was started with the intelligent weekly series.Here's a short time line; in the fall of 2002, a new show called Firefly came on the airwaves of FOX television.  It was something of a hybrid.  Part serialized western and part sci-fi adventure and featuring the sharp and witty dialogue that Whedon's fans come to expect.  It was a hit with critics and the few people who watched it.  Unfortunately several factors came into play that clinched it's demise.  FOX barely promoted it, mainly because they didn't like the direction the show started out in the pilot episode.  In a rush, a whole new action oriented episode was created in one weekend and even though it was a good episode, the higher ups obviously didn't like Whedon's `I want to do it my way' approach.  After several successful seasons of producing Buffy and Angel, both very successful shows, you would think the Execs at FOX would give Whedon the creative license to do the show the way he thought it should be done.  Alas, the businessmen thought they knew how to create complex entertaining stories and characters more than anyone else.  With a sour relationship the show was never promoted beyond a few short notices during the sports broadcasts that pre-empted the regular viewings.  In addition, no support was given to Whedon to create the show as a character driven show.  They simply wanted the action variety and nothing else.  They wanted the characters to be the bad-a$$ soldiers.  Whedon wanted to create characters who were flawed and but happen to have skills, some good some bad.  In other words, a balanced character study.  In December of 2002, the show was canceled and the two hour pilot episode was aired as the last show, that statement alone should clue anyone in on the thought process of the Execs at FOX.Whedon swore that Firefly would continue in some way shape or form.  With that, many would hope that the show would be picked up again by another network.  Sci-Fi channel, UPN, WB, fans wished someone would get this show back on the air.  It never happened.  Later in 2003, the DVD box set was released with three unaired episodes, fourteen in all.  It was a hit.  Amazon sales of the DVDs reached records highs and the reviews for the set were consistently in the four or five star range.  Many reviews read with phrases like `I never heard of the show, but I saw the DVDs and loved it.'  Later in 2003, it was confirmed that a major motion picture would be created.  Fans rejoiced.  As the movie went into production and teaser trailers were released, fans salivated and semi-fans were anxious.  Unfortunately the combination of two and the lack luster media coverage didn't amount to great ticket sales.  The movie barely covered it's expenses.  But it was critically hailed as a great movie and anyone who saw it seemed to like it as well.Ok, finally, I get to my synopsis of the movie itself; don't worry if you never saw the show, what you need to know is conveniently condensed into the first ten minutes.  It's a great scene, a testament to Joss' Whedon's writing ability to fit fourteen episodes of story into just a few minutes.  Taking place 500 years in the future, it centers on River Tam, a brilliant young girl who was manipulated by the government for covert purposes.  An Operative is assigned to find River and bring her in, or kill her.  Once past that we are treated to the first shot of Serenity, the ship.  Then we are introduced to it's crew as a long camera shot follows Captain Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) through the entire inner workings, displaying his relationship with each crew member.  It's so efficient and so well done, you can't believe you're entertained at the same time.  The plot continues the main story arc of the TV show as River and Simon Tam are being chased by the Alliance, the unionized Government of the US and Chinese that governs the core planets.  As the Captain picks up a job, this one being somewhat unlawful, they are suddenly attacked by the Reavers, a group of cannibalistic and brutal murders who are feared through out the system.  At the close of the job, River and Simon are expected to leave the ship for good.  When River suddenly goes ballistic in a bar, beating the pulp out of everyone in the place, the operative is tuned in on their location and the chase is on.  Instead of running, the crew find themselves tracking down the source of Rivers outburst.  I don't want to say much more because hopefully I've peaked your interest.  If not, I'll say this; Serenity is a top-notch character study and action/sci-fi adventure that goes, and goes fast.  The actors love their characters and to top that off, the dialogue is excellent.  With such a balanced crew and cast of characters you get a sense that this is a group of people who may not always like each other, but know they have to work together for something greater.The movie ends in surprising ways, Whedon's way of saying, `Maybe there will be a sequel, maybe there won't.'  He can never tell.  But suffice to say, even if he never does anything for the Firefly/Serenity Universe again, at least he got to complete this story and give his fans a glimmer of hope that one day it may rise again.",5,Reborn for closure,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,5572,"['cult', 'fan', 'success', 'TV', 'Series', 'Firefly', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'OTHER', 'labor', 'love', 'first', 'being', 'TV', 'Series',

Before then I was contemplating on seeing the film because I had never seen Firefly and didn't know what to expect. Time to time I noticed all the good reviews it was raking in on this site so I finally gave in and I'm glad I did! It may be sci-fi, but this film isn't all sci-fi, it's more action and definitely a comedy as well! The script is just fantastic, the way all these different film elements were combined together are just unbeatable.Basically the crew of Serenity, lead by Captain Mal, are a group of rebels who decide to take along a fugitive named River, plus River's brother Simon. The crew decide to use River to pull off such things as bank robberies, as she can detect if anything bad is about to happen. Mal refuses to surrender River over to anyone, and hence the body count rises! I must admit the story does bog a little over the course of the film, and some of the best characters are killed at the end, but in a film like this you focus on what makes the film so special. And the script was just astounding, that was enough to give this film such a high rating, and is the reason why it is loved so much. The fight scenes and things like that in the film are terrific as well, who would have thought that a film adapted from a TV Series could become so popular, and that a TV director could do such a good job. It is clear that the plot and script were worked on for a great length of time to make it so great, simply nothing was rushed here! The gore in the film may not be so great but there is only small amounts, and not much blood (until the end), but if you don't mind rotting corpses you should be fine.The cast that was pick for this film done very well, Fillion as Mal was believable as the captain. Other members of the cast like Maher and Torres are great as well! Whedon is the star of the day; he has made this film fantastic!In conclusion, Serenity is one of the best films for '05, and is also one of the best sci-fi films ever made! This is a highly recommendable film and you must view.

FOX canceled someone of their best shows like Fastlane, Tru Calling, Futurama, Family Guy and Firefly. They were even dumb enough to cancel Fastlane with a cliffhanger ending and I'm still want to know what happened next. Anyway both Family Guy and Firely got  second chances. Family Guy is back on FOX and Firefly creator Joss Whedon brought his vision back to life on the big screen.I just got into Firefly with the dvd's and sci-fi channel showing re-runs and I don't why I never watched it. It's great fun, with smart dialogue and a nice science fiction/western combination. Whedon does a fine job bringing all that to the big screen. With some better special effects and  more ruthless villians. The actors are up to the challenge too since most of them have been on the big screen before. This movie though will probably get them more starring roles. Nathan Fillion ""the evil and strong priest in the last season of Buffy"" is awesome as Mal, the captain of Firefly. The guy can deliver witty lines well but when  he has to show off the character's dark self-cenered side he's even better. Adam Baldwin (My Bodyguard, Full Metal Jacket, Angel's last season) is equally good as the unpredictable Jayne. You never know what he's gonna say or do.Gina Torres ""who Whedon also used as a powerful villian in Angel season 4"" is great just like she was in the show. She plays Mal's trusted alley who fought in a war with him. She'd follow him anywhere, especially since her husband's the pilot of Serenity. The sexy Summer Glau almost steals the show as River. A psychic who was also turnt into a weapon by scientists. Her being on the ship is a danger to Serenity and it's members since she's wanted all over the galaxy. That was the plot in the show too but it also works in the movie since we never got to learn much about her before the show was canceled. Here Serenity and anyone who has helped it's crew is in threat by a dangerous member of the alliance. He wants River and he won't stop killing until he gets her. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers) is a badass and even scary as the bounty hunter.What makes the movie more unpredictable than the show is that since it's no longer a show, it doesn't matter to Whedon if he kills anyone off.

Joss finally delivered with this theatrical film, ""Serenity"", which ties up as many of the lingering plot threads from the series in the amount of time provided. However, the film still stands well enough on it's own, and could have been the Star Wars of a new generation if it had succeded in the box office.The plot picks up 6 months after the final episode ended, with the United space Alliance still in pursuit of River Tam (Summer Glau), a 17 year old girl whom they experimented on to turn her into a weapon. After being freed by her brother Simon (Sean Maher), the siblings ally themselves with a mercenary named Captain Malcom Renolds (Nathon Fillion) and his crew in their Firefly-class ship named ""Serenity"". The group tries to uncover just what the government did to River, and stumble across a conspiracy that could jeapordize not only their lives, but anyone who comes into contact with them.While watching the film, I noticed that it definately seems smarter than most Summer block busters. I may be biased due to being a Whedon fanboy,but the themese presented in this film seem to be more morally ambigious, which is common in Whedon's work. Even the villain of the film, the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor)believes that what he is doing is for the greater good, and Malcom learns he has more in common with him than he'd like.The cast members give likeable to great performances, particularly Fillion as Reynolds and Glau as River.

Some of the things the characters do and say just don't fit what was established in the TV series. and Kaylee has lost about 20lbs (which is also a shame!)

In an extremely tight storyline, the ""Firefly"" story wraps up nicely, and the loose ends left are either intentionally left that way for effect or are relatively minor.That is also the greatest weakness of ""Serenity"" - without the foreknowledge from the series, the plot picks up in medias res, and you end up wondering how a lot of things came to be. The main villain, who wields a sword (anachronistic but cool), seems kind of tossed in at the last minute, and though he fleshes out nicely at the end, I can't shake the feeling that he was somehow fake (and strikingly similar to the villain from the final episode of ""Firefly"").That said, this DVD is full screen, and suffers for it - get the widescreen edition.

951360,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B000BW7QWW,Jon Norris,"[2, 2]","This film is a continuation of the Firefly TV series, axed in its prime by  TV network executives who just didn't get it.For details about the series, search for the Firefly DVD set here on Amazon, and read the reviews (mine first, of course!) Buy them both, but watch the series first! You will enjoy it more that way.The story line is about a spaceship full of interesting characters squeaking past the law, trying to live free and do the right thing whenever possible. This film picks up a short time after the last TV episode, Objects in Space, and follows on very nicely with the story arc of the series.To go into the story very deeply would give away too much. Suffice it to say that many of the smaller story arcs from the series (avaliable on Amazon in a boxed set) are resolved, and the series put to rest with a finish that would have made a beautiful season ender. There is an opening for more movies/projects based on the same ""verse,"" (short for Universe, show slang for the extremely interesting world/society/galaxy Joss and company created for the series). This 'verse consists of a blend of the old American West, Chinese culture (people speak Chinese and English interchangeably), old West technology and future space travel and related technology.One would think the blend would simply not work, but it does work, and it works unbelievably well. The characters draw you in instantly, and hold your attention through the entire series and movie, leaving you wanting more. I have watched Serenity (the movie - the first section of the DVD series set is also called Serentiy, but is different) so many time I have lost count (not as much as Howard Hughes watched Ice Station Zebra, rest assured, but lots). (Which reminds me - the recent movie about Hughes is also great.)In the movie you will see some things clarified, some things teasingly dangled in front of you and then buried (for future projects?), and at least two primary parts of the story arc resolved. It will make you laugh and cry, be happy and angry, leaving you feel very much a part of the lives of the characters. I won't give you details about the story line because that would take too much of the fun away. Great surprises and twists in store!I haven't been a Joss Whedon fan before, but I sure am now. I am going to go back and visit his previous series and see what I have been missing. I complain frequently that there is little or no good TV being made, but Joss proves me wrong. I just haven't found enough of his work. I am also going to keep an eye out for the actors in other projects, as they are all great as well.Remember, I recommend you get this movie with the Firefly series and watch the series first.

Like all great SF movies, the action and special effects serve the story and the characters, not the other way around.  Having said that, however, when the action and effects kick in, they really kick in.  There are terrific chases, space battles, and confrontations, as well as all kinds of other surprises.Those surprises, by the way, include some very clever revelations about the mysteries introduced in the short-lived but much missed ""Firefly"" television series, where the movie's characters were introduced.  For that reason, you might want to pick up the inexpensively-priced ""Firefly"" boxed set (you get all the show's episodes in the one set) and watch them before diving into ""Serenity"".  By all means, you don't need to do that- there's a painless and even clever re-cap of the show's major happenings in the movie's opening minutes- but why miss out on the fun of the show before enjoying the movie?Also, getting to know the characters by watching the show first will give added impact to some of the movie's major dramatic moments.  But be warned, that added impact won't always be of the happy variety, as Mr. Whedon believes that in order to generate genuine tension in a danger-filled adventure like this one, the viewer has to see that not everyone will make it out alive.  That's all I'll say on that score.  Well, I'll also say this: As well as directing the movie, ""Serenity"" was also written by Joss Whedon, so you know you'll be getting some funny stuff here, too.The DVD offers a sharp, clean widescreen image, and there are many interesting, fun extras, including a chatty, informative commentary track by Mr. Whedon.

I like Joss Whedon and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I just never got around to it, and then it got cancelled.  Thus, I do not know what information in Serenity is new to the movie, and what is already-established lore from the show.  Judged on its own merits, Serenity is a pretty-good film.  Some of the reviews I've read claim that it is better than Star Wars.  This is drastically overstating things - especially since the ""hero"" bears more than a passing resemblance to Han Solo.  This movie has more in common with Star Trek - also based on a TV series.  It isn't as much concerned with creating a new mythology, the way Star Wars is - it's about the continuing adventures of a crew of a pirate ship.

951371,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,B000BW7QWW,J. SHARP,"[26, 29]","I'm a Joss Whedon fan but not a browncoat. I'd never seen Firefly and was a bit skittish about going into Serenity knowing none of the backstory. But by and large it didn't hurt. I'm sure there'd be much more subtext to many parts of the film but it stands fairly well on its own. My only gripes are about some scenes in which you cannot understand the dialog (and I'm not talking about the Chinese bits!)I am somewhat amused but mostly dumbfounded by people saying ""If Serenity were any good, it would have made more money in theaters. Therefore, why bother seeing it?"" That's so foolish. It's like saying the big, delicious hamburgers at the corner diner can't be better than a Big Muck because if they were they'd be selling billions of the diner burgers instead. Well, just because one product has better marketing and more people consume it doesn't mean it's of higher quality.Another thing that bothers me is the unknown actor factor. One reviewer here gave Serenity's cast an unintentional back-handed compliment by saying, ""Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie ... the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me."" This mindset (""Even though they weren't overused famous people, they did alright"") is at the heart of why good movies rarely get made and also why you see the same 15 actors in every major studio release. The average moviegoer, when given a selection of movies to attend, doesn't ask ""What's it about?"" or ""What happens in it?"" They ask ""Who's in it?"" as if that will automatically make it good or bad. It's obvious that many people looked at Serenity's ads, saw no recognizable names, and said ""What else is on?"" This killed its box office take. If Whedon had recast it with Owen Wilson as Mal, Halle Berry as Zoe, and Ashlee Simpson as River it would have done three times the business. But it would not have been a better movie. It would have been worse. They aren't right for those roles! Familiar faces can get in the way of the story. You end up watching their prepackaged persona, not the character as it was imagined. For example, in The Fugitive (which I liked by the way) you never once felt you were watching a medical doctor on the lam. You were watching ""Harrison Ford"" fighting bad guys.My point is this: Don't follow the media hype. Try the diner down the street versus the prefab burger joint. You may like it. You may not.

It is predictible, the ""big shock"" at the end is underwhelming, and the fight scenes are so mediocre that even the fights on ""Buffy"" and ""Angel"" seem Matrix-worthy in comparison. Overall I feel like the plot is structured in a way that makes it harder for people who'd never seen the show to get into the movie.  There's some snappy dialogue, but the final death in the movie was cruel and unnecessary and it made me pretty mad.  But to be fair, this was the one part that WASN'T predictable, and that's exactly how Whedon wanted it.  His commentary track is uncharacteristically boring; most of it is taken up by talk of camera lenses and other sleep-inducing technical details I could care less about, and the the rest of it is ""I love this shot, and this piece of music, and this actor and that actor"" on and on and on.  He's usually much more interesting on commentary so I don't know what happened there.There's also not much character development here, and what little we get is truncated due to the need to spur the plot towards its disappointing conclusion.  One would think that fans of the show would be let down by that, but I guess not.  The DVD extras are pretty dull in general and generally not worth the time it takes to watch them.That's all fairly negative, so why the three-star review?  Well, it's mostly out of loyalty to Joss Whedon.  I am a huge fan of his work, and my general motto is that ""Anything you can do, Joss Whedon can do better.""  I think he's done better things than ""Firefly"" and this movie, but I respect and admire his passion for this work.  This movie is proof that passion -- from Whedon, his cast and all the ""browncoat"" die hard fans -- can move mountains, or at least get movies made.  And I think that's great news.  I certainly hope that if nothing else, all the people who like ""Firefly"" who weren't Whedon fans before will jump on the bus and help make all his future projects more successful.  This one wasn't, and I think the bad news is that its lack of success may have a lot to do with the fact that this movie simply wasn't that great.  And that's really too bad because Joss Whedon is very capable of greatness.

951388,AHQBXGFFMBBC9,B000BW7QWW,kazper,"[0, 0]","I'll be honest, when Firefly came out I had no clue what it was. It wasn't until almost a decade later that I found the series on Netflix and started watching it. From then, I was hooked by the great case and original plot lines.After going through the series twice, I decided it was finally time to watch the &#34;finale&#34; of Serenity. My biggest fear was that it wouldn't live up to the hype of the series. Luckily, that was a non-issue. My only other concern was that there would be no new adventures with the crew of the Serenity after watching the movie. Still, I pressed on and watched the end of this epic saga.The movie itself does a much better job of outlining the characters than the first few episodes of the show ever did. Granted there was a reason for this, but if this movie led the way to the series, I think there would have been a larger following.Serenity picks up a while after Firefly left off. Not all of the crew are still aboard the ship, as the Shepherd has moved onto a planetary colony elsewhere and Inara is tending to one of her &#34;clients&#34;. The movie mostly deals with the crew trying to free Summer from the chase of the Alliance. In order to do this, they have to battle countless foes including the mysterious reevers. The movie provides details that would have been covered if the show had not have been cancelled so quickly, such as why the Alliance is after Summer. Truth be told, it is very obvious why any organization would want her &#34;talents&#34; after seeing her abilities in action.I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because there were some parts that I wasn't impressed with. Wash's death really sticks out in my mind. Not that killing his character was wrong, but how they did it seemed tragic. He could have died protecting Zoe, sacrificing himself to make sure she managed to escape an impossible situation or gone down with his ship while everyone else escaped (Titanic-esque, I suppose).Still, this was a great movie that I will probably watch at least once or twice more. I'm sad to see the cast and crew leave their roles, but I'm glad they were given one last chance to tie things up at least a little bit.",4,"So long, Serenity...",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,2170,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'Firefly', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'almost', 'decade', 'later', 'found', 'series', 'Netflix', 'started', 'watching', 'then', 'was', 'hooked', 'great', 'case', 'original', 'plot', 'lines.After', 'going', 'series', 'twice', 'decided', 'was', 'finally', 'time', 'watch', '34', 'finale', '34', 'Serenity', 'biggest', 'fear', 'was', 'would', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'series', 'Luckily', 'was', 'non-issue', 'only', 'other', 'concern', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'adventures', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'watching', 'movie', 'Still', 'pressed', 'watched', 'end', 'epic', 'saga.The', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'outlining', 'characters', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'show', 'ever', 'did', 'Granted', 'was', 'reason', 'movie', 'led', 'way', 'series', 'think', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'larger', 'following.Serenity', 'up', 'while', 'Firefly', 'left', 'off', 'Not', 'crew', 'are', 'still', 'ship', 'Shepherd', 'moved', 'planetary', 'colony', 'elsewhere', 'Inara', 'tending', 'one', '34', 'clients', '34', 'movie', 'mostly', 'crew', 'trying', 'free', 'Summer', 'chase', 'Alliance', 'order', 'do', 'have', 'battle', 'countless', 'foes', 'including', 'mysterious', 'reevers', 'movie', 'details', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'covered', 'show', 'had', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'cancelled', 'so', 'quickly', 'such', 'why', 'Alliance', 'Summer', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'very', 'obvious', 'why', 'organization', 'would', 'want', '34', 'talents', '34', 'seeing', 'abilities', 'action.I', 'gave', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'were', 'parts', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Wash', 'death', 'really', 'out', 'mind', 'Not', 'killing', 'character', 'was', 'wrong', 'how', 'did', 'seemed', 'tragic', 'could', 'have', 'died', 'protecting', 'Zoe', 'sacrificing', 'make', 'sure', 'managed', 'escape', 'impossible', 'situation', 'gone', 'down', 'ship', 'everyone', 'else', 'escaped', 'Titanic-esque', 'suppose', '.Still', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'more', ""'m"", 'sad', 'see', 'cast', 'crew', 'leave', 'roles', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'given', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'tie', 'things', 'up', 'least', 'little', 'bit']",N/A

951392,A2DB720I9XRX7K,B000BW7QWW,K. Draper,"[0, 0]","""Serenity"" is the name of the space vessel in this space-western movie.  The name seems to be based on the valley Serenity where Captain Mal and his first mate Zoe were the lone survivors in a battle against the Alliance. They were part of the resistance, but after they--The Brown Coats--lost the war, Mal still resisted assimilation and aquired a ""Firefly class"" cargo space ship, and. along with his assorted crew of nine, basically continued to operate on the fringes of society. Their adventures are the subject of the TV series ""Firefly"".  Among the ship's crew is a talented young doctor, Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his rather mysterious younger sister, River (Summer Glau). As it turns out, River, though she has been highly traumatized by the Alliance through special ""schooling"" they had her in, has some extrodinary gifts, including being a psychic and having astonishing fighting skills. Simon had risked his life and gave up a prestigious career to rescue her from the Alliance and they are hell-bent on getting her back. The action of the movie centers around the Alliance, in the person of a nameless yet fearsome operative nicely played by Chiwetel Ejiofer, hunting down Serenity in order to recapture or kill the young prodigy. Captian Mal and crew are really not aware of who she is or the risk they are under, yet they end up actually having similar goals in resisting the domination of the Alliance and exposing the truth about them, at least insofar as planet Miranda and the identity of the Reavers, a bestial and violent human-variant.As I said, the movie does have quite a lot of action. Like the TV series, it sometimes seems like a cowboy shoot 'em up show, only in outer space. The characters have a peculiar way of speaking--they use ""ain't"", and the leave the gs off of the end of verbs, which makes them seem ""country"", but they also sometimes mutter phrases in Chinese or use words like ""gorom"" or ""verse"".  Zoe (Gina Torres) is tough as nails, and she uses a sawed-off shotgun. Jewel Strait as Kaylee, is a chipper young girl who is also a mechanical genius who keeps the scarred and embattled Serenity running. Other characters are equally colorful. The story worked pretty well. I like how they showed flash-backs to River's childhood in school where she didn't just accept everything she was being taught, and also at the end where we learned more about the Reavers and how they came about.

This set probably should have been available from the very beginning, but better late than never I suppose.The movie itself is a great sci-fi ride that isn't reliant on exploding ships and is more dependent on an actual story with depth. Of course, that's not to say there's no action as there is plenty of that as well. This is the perfect blend of great sci-fi storytelling, genre diversity and action in a single feature film.While the movie is based off the Firefly TV series, the director and writing staff did a great job in making it easily accessible to those who have not seen the series. It's rare that a film so anticipated by its fanbase actually lives up to their expectations; but I would argue Serenity easily surpassed mine.My one gripe is that this version has DTS sound, where as the previous version did not. While DTS is normally a good thing, I must admit I didn't notice too great a difference between the DTS and Dolby Digital tracks. The sound is great regardless, but I was just hoping to be blown away by the difference like when you compare a film like Master and Commanders DTS to its Dolby track.The special features are definitely worth picking up this volume for. The behind the scenes features and interviews are great and do not get boring. The Sci-Fi Inside feature does repeat some elements seen in other special features, but it also provides plenty of material not seen in the other features to make it worth watching.All in all this is a great, if not late, release of a highly underrated film. I know many are probably saying that the sci-fi fanbase rates it very highly, but I believe that it easily deserves praise from the mainstream as well.

951398,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000BW7QWW,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[9, 22]","This movie proves my claim that part of what makes Firefly a classic TV series is that it's incomplete.  In an attempt to turn a brilliant-but-cancelled TV show into a film franchise, the creators try to tie up too many loose ends, lose track of the radiant energy that makes the show a DVD mainstay, and don't even shoot the finished product in a visually appealing manner.To start with, the movie gives us an opening sequence that flatly contradicts some of the facts revealed in the series pilot.  To its credit, this sequence also gives us Chiwetel Ejiofor, an inspired young British actor who adds a strong note to this story.  But the confusion brought about by this opening teaser presages the confusion committed fans will likely feel throughout the film.Then the main body of the story starts several months after the end of the series.  Inarra and Book have left the crew of Serenity, and River has crossed a line, getting her and her brother evicted.  If this feels like the kind of crew-splitting that caused the first Star Trek movie to have such a confoundingly long opening act, well, that's an apt analogy.The film then sets out to close down several of the series' unresolved storylines, not by actually closing them, but by creating new storylines that have nothing to do with the series.  Couple that with River's newfound superhero powers, and a visual design so murky that the entire movie seems shot through Beijing smog, and you have a film that frustrates rather than satisfies fans.I really, really love Firefly.  Though only fourteen episodes were shot, it's so full of promise and energy that fans of smart stories can't help but be drawn in.  That very promise, unsullied by the need for pat answers, has made the unfinished series a classic.  This effort at just those pat answers, well, sullies the series.

951401,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000BW7QWW,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 15]","I'm sure you got a lot more out of ""Serenity"" if you followed the television series it is a part of.  To be honest, it was a tad confusing to figure out just who was who in this film since I've never watched the show.  I played catch-up for most of the film.  The basic plot is simple enough:  the ""Alliance"" is after the young girl named ""River.""  We don't find out until later in the film exactly why they are after.  That's a good thing, but I felt as if the girl and her brother had only recently joined the crew of the ""Serenity.""  From watching the documentaries on the DVD, I gathered that they've been a part of the crew for some time.The acting is very good in this flick.  Adam Baldwin is great as ""Jayne.""  I've always felt that deep inside that guy is a superstar waiting to crawl out.  Instead, he's left to play second fiddle or be a minor character in the bulk of the movies he's been in.  It's nice to finally see him get a little more spotlight in this movie.  Nathan Fillion plays ""Mal,"" the captain of the outlaw crew.  The crew is fleshed out with solid acting from Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau and the beautiful Jewel Staite.  Chiwetel Ejiofor is the figurehead for the ""Alliance"" in the film, and he ends up being a rather good character in the film.  Other characters included the humorous ""Mr. Universe"" and ""Shepherd,"" a sort of ""Gandalf"" of the galaxy kind.The special effects were very good considering this flick had a rather thin budget to work with compared to other films in the sci-fi genre.  The majority of the digitally animated sequences blended quite nicely with the live-action in the movie.  Also, the effects do not hinder the action, which is often throughout, in the film.The banter between characters was nice to see on the screen.  All of them had witty exchanges that made me laugh, much like writer and director, Joss Whedon's other TV hits, ""Buffy"" and ""Angel.""Speaking of Whedon, watching him in the documentaries gave me the feeling that this dude is a little bit too much into himself.  Sure, he wrote ""Angel,"" ""Buffy,"" and ""Firefly,"" but all of those flicks have cult appeal.  There's nothing wrong with that, but there are other writers out there who've done the same thing Whedon has done but have managed to reach massive groups of people.  For instance, the original ""Star Wars"" flicks reached a lot of non-sci-fi fans.  Of course, George Lucas has fallen prey to vanity, but he's made a few more pennies at this craft than Whedon.  The ""Star Trek"" franchise has both a cult AND non-sci-fi following.  In short, I'm not knocking Whedon for what he has done, I just think his ego is a bit too big for his current status.  Ask Joe Public who George Lucas is, and they'll know.  Ask them the same thing about Whedon and you'll probably get a puzzled look in return.For fans of the TV series, I'm sure that ""Serenity"" is a dream-come-true, but for general film fans, this movie's a bit middle-of-the-road.  If you enjoy any series cranked out by SciFi channel, this film is for you.  If you watch SciFi for their hokey creature features, just flip on the TV on Saturday or Sunday.For fans:  purchase.

A friend of mine in Australia bought the series for me. He told me in detail what happened with the show. I was skeptical when I first watched it. There is really very little GOOD sci-fi out there.By the end of the short series, I was in tears. I have never cried over a television show. The pulling of this show has to be one of the biggest blunders in network history ! It would have outdone and outlasted Star Trek. The realism and the humor are brilliant. The cast could not have been more perfect.My friend consoled me with the fact there was a movie ""Serenity"" soon to be released on DVD. The promotion for the movie was so lacking I never even knew it was in the theatres. I'd never heard of it. I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out.They had a very small budget to work with in making this movie. What they did with that budget is nothing short of miraculous. It is so very rare when every part of a movie is good. The story, plot, characters, actors, and special effects are all simply amazing.I heard today that the movie is now ""out of the red"" and making money through DVD sales. I have purchased the Firefly series for friends and will do the same with Serenity. The more people know about it, the more will get hooked and perhaps our influence can sway Universal to do another movie before the cast is old and grey. I heard NBC bought the rights to a 3 movie deal. That would be smart if they actually do it. It would be smarter yet to re-instate the original Firefly series. If they really want to show their IQ's, they will advertise it WELL. Firefly/Serenity beats Star Trek hands down, my condolences to Gene Roddenbury, but this is better. Never thought I'd say that. The big companies have a cult hit on their hands that could make them money for the next 40 years if they play it right. How they have handled it so far is a travesty.Buy Serenity ! Buy Firefly ! Send the only message the networks and movie companies understand...money. This show is worth it. You will not be disappointed ! Let's show them we want Firefly/Serenity back in any format !

Considering the budget (I read somewhere it wss made quick and underfunded) I was pretty impressed with the finished product. Can't imagine what they would have done if they'd had a big budget.

It is not only a fantastic show in its own right, but it makes a highly satisfying wrap-up to the short-lived Firefly series. The entire original cast made the transformation from small to large screen and their chemistry has only gotten better over time. We find out the secrets of River's past, meet the dreaded Reavers, and uncover their mysterious history as well. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays one of the best ""bad guys"" ever filmed, an Alliance operative who's not truly evil, just overly dedicated and willing to do anything for his cause. The special effects truly complement the story line yet don't steal the show as they do in many sci-fi productions. Everything from the costumes, sets, props, and effects blend together seamlessly to make this future verse believable.The only shortcoming is the bonus material, which is far to short and adds little to the viewing experience. The deleted scenes don't add a lot to the story line, though the outtakes are funny. Re-igniting the Firefly is the best segment of the extra stuff. Be that as it may, the movie is well written, brilliantly acted, and thoroughly enjoyable.

951419,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BW7QWW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 16]","If you were thinking that Joss Whedon wrote and directed ""Serenity"" to be the first in a series of movies based on the crew of his late and lamented television series ""Firefly,"" think again. Whedon knows this might be his only bite of the cinematic apple for his creations, so fans will see this being more like the series finales of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel."" In other words, not everybody is going to be around for the final credits.To get everybody on the same page Whedon begins with Simon (Sean Maher) breaking his sister River (Summer Glau) out of the Alliance laboratory where they are busy playing with her brain. River is both a psychic and a living weapon, and it turns out that it is the former that is of the biggest concern to the Alliance because she knows something she should not know. That knowledge, rattling around in her head, is part of the reason that River is mentally unstable, and so the Alliance has sent an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has neither a name nor an official position, to bring her back. Then we jump to Serenity and a tracking shot in which the boat's captain, Mal (Nathan Fillion) starts in the cock pit with Wash (Alan Tudyk), and then walks all the way through the crew deck and returns back through the cargo deck, meeting Zoe (Gina Torres), Jayne (Adam Baldwin), and Kaylee (Jewel Statie), along with Simon and River along the way. Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer aboard, but rest assured they will pop up. So, Mal has River and the Alliance wants her, so the Operative is coming to get her and he is coming ""sideways.""Mal Reynolds is in the reluctant hero Han Solo/Rick Blaine mold; he and Zoe fought against the Alliance in the war and now his entire world is Serenity. His crew is his top priority and the Alliance is making a big mistake in forcing him to care about larger issues. Besides, he has an ace, or at least a wild card, up his sleeve with River. So the character arc of the captain is certainly a familiar one. But one of Whedon's chief attributes is that he likes to play with established conventions. Every time you think that you are ahead of the characters and that Mal does not know what is about to happen next, you are wrong. So it is nice to play with expectations and Whedon does so, to provide not only humor but some pathos as well (Whedon likes to make you laugh and then give you a reason to suddenly stop laughing).Yes, those of us familiar with ""Firefly"" have an advantage in watching ""Serenity"" because we know the characters, not only in terms of their histories but also their temperaments. That is why we were expecting a lot more cursing in Chinese in this movie. We are also going to be more accepting of attempts to fast forward some of the interpersonal issues that afflict the crew of Serenity, as well as the attempt to suggest what is to come down the road. Whedon could get bogged down in trying to finally untangle the love-hate affair that Mal and Inara have been having, but he rightly keeps the focus on working out the River plotline. Most of the crewmembers of Serenity get their moments, but this film comes down to Mal and River, which is what both the television series and the prologue here have set up. I am perfectly willing to grant that such insider knowledge is worth at least a half-star in terms of rating this film, but that is just the way things break with this movie.Ultimately, I ended up rounding up on ""Serenity"" because in the sequences where River goes to town Whedon tries to do as much of the action as possible in one shot. I am so sick and tired of seeing fight sequences reduced to a rapid fire montage of cuts where I can never tell what is going on. It seems that you do not get to see what is really happening in a fight unless it is not really happening because you are using CGI for your fights (a prime example being Spider-man versus Doctor Octopus in ""Spider-man 2""). But when River takes her turn we get to see what she is doing and enjoy her whirling ballet of death and one of the joys here is watching Glau turn off the crazy little girl routine and show exactly what the Alliance has created. In other words, Whedon provides the payoff we were denied when ""Firefly"" was summarily cancelled after only eleven episodes had aired, which is exactly what the mission statement was this time around.",5,"Joss Whedon provides some closure to the ""Firefly"" saga,",1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,4378,"['were', 'thinking', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Serenity', 'be', 'first', 'series', 'movies', 'based', 'crew', 'late', 'lamented', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'think', 'again', 'Whedon', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'bite', 'cinematic', 'apple', 'creations', 'so', 'fans', 'will', 'see', 'being', 'more', 'series', 'finales', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'everybody', 'going', 'be', 'final', 'credits.To', 'get', 'everybody', 'same', 'page', 'Whedon', 'Simon', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'breaking', 'sister', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'Alliance', 'laboratory', 'where', 'are', 'busy', 'playing', 'brain', 'River', 'psychic', 'living', 'weapon', 'out', 'former', 'biggest', 'concern', 'Alliance', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'know', 'knowledge', 'rattling', 'around', 'head', 'part', 'reason', 'River', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'so', 'Alliance', 'sent', 'Operative', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'who', 'name', 'official', 'position', 'bring', 'back', 'Then', 'jump', 'Serenity', 'tracking', 'shot', 'boat', 'captain', 'Mal', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'cock', 'pit', 'Wash', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'then', 'walks', 'way', 'crew', 'deck', 'returns', 'back', 'cargo', 'deck', 'meeting', 'Zoe', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Jayne', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Kaylee', 'Jewel', 'Statie', 'Simon', 'River', 'way', 'Inara', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'Ron', 'Glass', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'aboard', 'rest', 'assured', 'will', 'pop', 'up', 'So', 'Mal', 'River', 'Alliance', 'Operative', 'coming', 'get', 'coming', 'sideways', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'Han', 'Solo/Rick', 'Blaine', 'mold', 'Zoe', 'fought', 'Alliance', 'war', 'now', 'entire', 'world', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'top', 'priority', 'Alliance', 'making', 'big', 'mistake', 'forcing', 'care', 'larger', 'issues', 'Besides', 'ace', 'least', 'wild', 'card', 'up', 'sleeve', 'River', 'character', 'arc', 'captain', 'certainly', 'familiar', 'one', 'one', 'Whedon', 'chief', 'attributes', 'play', 'established', 'conventions', 'time', 'think', 'are', 'ahead', 'characters', 'Mal', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'about', 'happen', 'next', 'are', 'wrong', 'nice', 'play', 'expectations', 'Whedon', 'so', 'provide', 'not', 'only', 'humor', 'pathos', 'as', 'well', 'Whedon', 'make', 'laugh', 'then', 'give', 'reason', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'laughing', '.Yes', 'familiar', 'Firefly', 'have', 'advantage', 'watching', 'Serenity', 'know', 'characters', 'not', 'only', 'terms', 'histories', 'also', 'temperaments', 'why', 'were', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'cursing', 'Chinese', 'movie', 'are', 'also', 'going', 'be', 'more', 'accepting', 'attempts', 'fast', 'forward', 'interpersonal', 'issues', 'afflict', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'as', 'well', 'attempt', 'suggest', 'what', 'come', 'down', 'road', 'Whedon', 'could', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'trying', 'finally', 'untangle', 'love-hate', 'affair', 'Mal', 'Inara', 'have', 'been', 'having', 'rightly', 'focus', 'working', 'out', 'River', 'plotline', 'Most', 'crewmembers', 'Serenity', 'get', 'moments', 'film', 'down', 'Mal', 'River', 'what', 'television', 'series', 'prologue', 'here', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'grant', 'such', 'insider', 'knowledge', 'worth', 'least', 'half-star', 'terms', 'rating', 'film', 'just', 'way', 'things', 'break', 'movie.Ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'Serenity', 'sequences', 'where', 'River', 'town', 'Whedon', 'tries', 'do', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'possible', 'one', 'shot', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'seeing', 'fight', 'sequences', 'reduced', 'rapid', 'fire', 'montage', 'cuts', 'where', 'can', 'never', 'tell', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'fight', 'not', 'really', 'happening', 'are', 'using', 'CGI', 'fights', 'prime', 'example', 'being', 'Spider-man', 'versus', 'Doctor', 'Octopus', 'Spider-man', '2', 'when', 'River', 'turn', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'doing', 'enjoy', 'whirling', 'ballet', 'death', 'one', 'joys', 'here', 'watching', 'Glau', 'turn', 'off', 'crazy', 'little', 'girl', 'routine', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'Alliance', 'created', 'other', 'words', 'Whedon', 'payoff', 'were', 'denied', 'when', 'Firefly', 'was', 'summarily', 'cancelled', 'only', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'had', 'aired', 'exactly', 'what', 'mission', 'statement', 'was', 'time', 'around']",N/A

951424,A2DSBRN6SGL6EC,B000BW7QWW,LeeHoFooks,"[1, 1]","Sadly, ""Firefly,"" by many accounts one of the greatest television shows ever created, was cancelled mid-way through its first season. Thousands of fans of the show (AKA ""Browncoats"") pressured Fox executives to continue the series, and in 2005, they got their wish. Sort of.""Serenity"" starts out not long after where ""Firefly"" left off, with Mal and the crew (minus Inara and the Shepherd, at first) just trying to survive and keep flying honorably (if not always legally). River (who is still crazy) gets the crew into more trouble than they've ever been in together, and it's up to Mal to lead them out of it. Characters go through some deeper development, loose ends are tied up, mysteries are explained, but of course (Joss Whedon being the cruel showman he is) the ending is left open and the audience craving far more.The film's not perfect. (This is understandable, of course, since it takes the place of what might have been a long, complicated series.) The ""Hands of Blue"" are never explained, and a hacker (""Mr. Universe"") is introduced as if he'd been a recurring character all along. Perhaps he was meant to be, but simply hadn't been introduced to the show yet? Either way, I also found Mr. Universe to be more than a little annoying and clich&eacute;.But aside from those couple of tiny nit-picks, ""Serenity"" is a great film. The action scenes are suspenseful but fun, the one-liners are as witty and hilarious as ever, and a newly-introduced antagonist (a shadowy, black ops type known only as ""The Operative"") is the perfect antithesis to Mal. (He's the sly ninja to Mal's noble cowboy, but I digress...) I think ""Serenity"" is probably a pretty good stand-alone film, but I'd certainly have to recommend watching ""Firefly"" first.No, ""Serenity"" isn't the several seasons worth of episodes the fans wanted (and the show truly deserved), but it's a very fitting end to a series that needed closure.So watch the gorram thing already.",5,"Burn the Land and Boil the Sea; At Least We Have ""Serenity""",1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,1945,"['Sadly', 'Firefly', 'many', 'accounts', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'shows', 'ever', 'created', 'was', 'cancelled', 'mid-way', 'first', 'season', 'Thousands', 'fans', 'show', 'AKA', 'Browncoats', 'pressured', 'Fox', 'executives', 'continue', 'series', '2005', 'got', 'wish', 'Sort', 'Serenity', 'out', 'not', 'long', 'where', 'Firefly', 'left', 'off', 'Mal', 'crew', 'Inara', 'Shepherd', 'first', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'keep', 'flying', 'honorably', 'not', 'always', 'legally', 'River', 'who', 'still', 'crazy', 'crew', 'more', 'trouble', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'together', 'up', 'Mal', 'lead', 'Characters', 'go', 'deeper', 'development', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'mysteries', 'are', 'explained', 'course', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'being', 'cruel', 'showman', 'ending', 'left', 'open', 'audience', 'craving', 'far', 'more.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'understandable', 'course', 'place', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'complicated', 'series', 'Hands', 'Blue', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'hacker', 'Mr.', 'Universe', 'introduced', ""'d"", 'been', 'recurring', 'character', 'along', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'simply', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'introduced', 'show', 'yet', 'way', 'also', 'found', 'Mr.', 'Universe', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'annoying', 'clich', 'eacute', 'aside', 'couple', 'tiny', 'nit-picks', 'Serenity', 'great', 'film', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'fun', 'one-liners', 'are', 'witty', 'hilarious', 'ever', 'newly-introduced', 'antagonist', 'shadowy', 'black', 'ops', 'type', 'known', 'only', 'Operative', 'perfect', 'antithesis', 'Mal', 'sly', 'ninja', 'Mal', 'noble', 'cowboy', 'digress', 'think', 'Serenity', 'probably', 'pretty', 'good', 'stand-alone', 'film', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'have', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Firefly', 'first.No', 'Serenity', ""n't"", 'several', 'seasons', 'episodes', 'fans', 'wanted', 'show', 'truly', 'deserved', 'very', 'fitting', 'end', 'series', 'needed', 'closure.So', 'watch', 'gorram', 'thing', 'already']",N/A
951425,A19RAJY6R7USN0,B000BW7QWW,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[4, 6]","I'd seen the Firefly television series that this is based on, I'd seen the Serenity movie trailer, I'd read the Serenity official movie magazine and I'd also read the screenplay which is found in the Serenity Visual Companion, so suffice it to say I was prepped and ready to watch.Despite Serenity being released 3 years after Firefly, it is set a mere few months after the television series. In this movie we continue the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his on-board crew. Returning are all the leads from the series including first officer Zoe, her husband the pilot Wash, always looking for a fight Jayne, engineer Kaylie who has a crush on the Doctor- Simon, and Simon's psychic sister River who carries a terrible secret which the Alliance will do anything to keep secret. Also returning are companion Inara and preacher Book who have both left the ship Serenity during the few months between the tv show and the film.So here I was, finally watching this movie that due to its original release date being delayed, I'd felt like I'd waited ages to see, and for the most part it delivered. There was plenty of action, humor, fun and excitement. It was also easy for newcomers to not only follow, but enjoy- something which the Star Trek movies had problems accomplishing. Creator/Writer/Director Joss Whedon though has succeeded on this issue very well.So why did I feel that little bit disappointed?Well, you see the thing is, I've been a fan of Joss Whedon's work for a long time. He has done amazing work on tv shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel. Also, it was in 1992 that he'd written the movie version of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and the director had taken the film in a direction Joss Whedon did not want it to go- now with Serenity he had an opportunity to direct a movie the way he intended and I believe Serenity to be a representation of what Joss Whedon wanted the film to be. Unfortunately, the big screen limits how far you can take the characters because since the movie is on the big screen, the main plot has to take priority over everything else. Thus themes and emotions can get lost. For example, one of the main themes in Serenity is that you should believe no matter what- well I am used to Joss addressing a theme and then taking it further- he didn't take it very far here, and in fact he addressed the same issue in-depth in the Season 5 Premiere of Angel- Conviction. As for emotions- I remember great emotional moments in Buffy and Angel where Buffy killed Angel, Buffy died for the second time and Fred died. All big emotional points that I knew were going to happen long before I actually saw them on screen, yet when I did finally see them, they did affect me. With Serenity I knew the two characters that were going to die because I'd read the screenplay, yet I was barely affected at all because the main plot was the priority at the time in the film. And even when we did finally catch-up to the loss in the funeral scene at the end, I still felt empty. In contrast, whenever I see Spock die in Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan I can still feel the hurt, despite knowing he'll be back in the third Star Trek movie. I get this sense that no matter how many times I watch Serenity, I won't feel the emotion of losing the two characters that died. The family atmosphere established in the series doesn't appear to be as strong either. And the person to blame for that I'm afraid to say is the man himself- Joss Whedon. Granted, I'm sure he made various concessions for the big screen but it's a shame certain opportunities were missed. I actually wanted River to make me cry but she didn't- makes me cry that she didn't make me cry.So in summary, this is a fun movie that should convert newcomers to the Joss Whedon universe and entertain those already loyal to his work, but it doesn't show the true greatness of Joss that I'd hoped for. I only give it 5 stars in this review, because I've already given 4 stars to a lot less. Still, despite any nitpicky flaws, a sequel would be welcome. We may get one we may not. And if we don't, Serenity serves as a somehow appropriate ending to the Firefly and Serenity saga.",5,Criticizing Joss Whedon & Serenity,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,4162,"[""'d"", 'seen', 'Firefly', 'television', 'series', 'based', ""'d"", 'seen', 'Serenity', 'movie', 'trailer', ""'d"", 'read', 'Serenity', 'official', 'movie', 'magazine', ""'d"", 'also', 'read', 'screenplay', 'found', 'Serenity', 'Visual', 'Companion', 'so', 'suffice', 'say', 'was', 'prepped', 'ready', 'watch.Despite', 'Serenity', 'being', 'released', '3', 'years', 'Firefly', 'set', 'mere', 'few', 'months', 'television', 'series', 'movie', 'continue', 'adventures', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'on-board', 'crew', 'Returning', 'are', 'leads', 'series', 'including', 'first', 'officer', 'Zoe', 'husband', 'pilot', 'Wash', 'always', 'looking', 'fight', 'Jayne', 'engineer', 'Kaylie', 'who', 'crush', 'Doctor-', 'Simon', 'Simon', 'psychic', 'sister', 'River', 'who', 'terrible', 'secret', 'Alliance', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'keep', 'secret', 'Also', 'returning', 'are', 'companion', 'Inara', 'preacher', 'Book', 'who', 'have', 'left', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'few', 'months', 'tv', 'show', 'film.So', 'here', 'was', 'finally', 'watching', 'movie', 'due', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'being', 'delayed', ""'d"", 'felt', ""'d"", 'waited', 'ages', 'see', 'most', 'part', 'delivered', 'was', 'plenty', 'action', 'humor', 'fun', 'excitement', 'was', 'also', 'easy', 'newcomers', 'not', 'only', 'follow', 'enjoy-', 'something', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'had', 'problems', 'accomplishing', 'Creator/Writer/Director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'succeeded', 'issue', 'very', 'well.So', 'why', 'did', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Well', 'see', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'work', 'long', 'time', 'done', 'amazing', 'work', 'tv', 'shows', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Angel', 'Also', 'was', '1992', ""'d"", 'written', 'movie', 'version', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'director', 'had', 'taken', 'film', 'direction', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'go-', 'now', 'Serenity', 'had', 'opportunity', 'direct', 'movie', 'way', 'intended', 'believe', 'Serenity', 'be', 'representation', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'wanted', 'film', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'big', 'screen', 'how', 'far', 'can', 'take', 'characters', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'main', 'plot', 'take', 'priority', 'everything', 'else', 'Thus', 'themes', 'emotions', 'can', 'get', 'lost', 'example', 'one', 'main', 'themes', 'Serenity', 'should', 'believe', 'matter', 'what-', 'well', 'am', 'used', 'Joss', 'addressing', 'theme', 'then', 'taking', 'further-', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'far', 'here', 'fact', 'addressed', 'same', 'issue', 'in-depth', 'Season', '5', 'Premiere', 'Angel-', 'Conviction', 'emotions-', 'remember', 'great', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'where', 'Buffy', 'killed', 'Angel', 'Buffy', 'died', 'second', 'time', 'Fred', 'died', 'big', 'emotional', 'points', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'happen', 'long', 'actually', 'saw', 'screen', 'yet', 'when', 'did', 'finally', 'see', 'did', 'affect', 'Serenity', 'knew', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'going', 'die', ""'d"", 'read', 'screenplay', 'yet', 'was', 'barely', 'affected', 'main', 'plot', 'was', 'priority', 'time', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'did', 'finally', 'catch-up', 'loss', 'funeral', 'scene', 'end', 'still', 'felt', 'empty', 'contrast', 'whenever', 'see', 'Spock', 'die', 'Star', 'Trek', 'II', 'Wrath', 'Khan', 'can', 'still', 'feel', 'hurt', 'knowing', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'third', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'get', 'sense', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'Serenity', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'emotion', 'losing', 'two', 'characters', 'died', 'family', 'atmosphere', 'established', 'series', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'strong', 'person', 'blame', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'say', 'man', 'himself-', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Granted', ""'m"", 'sure', 'made', 'various', 'concessions', 'big', 'screen', 'shame', 'certain', 'opportunities', 'were', 'missed', 'actually', 'wanted', 'River', 'make', 'cry', ""didn't-"", 'cry', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'cry.So', 'summary', 'fun', 'movie', 'should', 'convert', 'newcomers', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'universe', 'entertain', 'already', 'loyal', 'work', ""n't"", 'show', 'true', 'greatness', 'Joss', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'only', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'review', ""'ve"", 'already', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'lot', 'less', 'Still', 'nitpicky', 'flaws', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'may', 'get', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'Serenity', 'somehow', 'appropriate', 'ending', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'saga']",N/A

951433,A3PUVLBMBHDNWT,B000BW7QWW,Lissa,"[8, 99]","Let me start by saying that I was very excited to see this movie. I was in high spirits when I went to see it in theatres, and I am very easily entertained by movies in general. And yes, I like sci-fi and have a soft spot for fantasy. The plot seemed to have everything going for it. In theory, the idea of a fantasy/sci-fi mixed with western elements sounds intriguing. Really, how could it go wrong? I'll tell you how: bad characterization, bad acting and bad writing. This movie seems to have failed in all those areas. I could barely sit through it. For probably the first time in years, my attention actually drifted in the theater. I was counting the little lights on the aisles because it was more entertaining than watching this mess. The biggest problem I had was with the characters themselves. They felt flat and one-dimensional, and I didn't buy them at all. More importantly, I found them unsympathetic -- especially River. I don't know if it's more a problem with the acting or the script, but I'm pretty sure it's a combination of both. The writing seemed immature to me and just... dull and cliched. The lines were equivalent to those you'd find in a mediocre made-for-TV sci-fi. And the progression of the story was sloppy and disjointed. I would point out the numerous examples, but that would mean watching the movie again, and I would rather watch a movie on UPN. I would advise not to come to this movie with high expectations.

It was definitely the right decision.There wasn't much Western in sight at all, in _Serenity_, (which was my problem with the original series); it was nearly pure sci-fi, which I truly enjoyed. Finally we have an answer to the problem of River, we see how Simon rescued her and what it is the Alliance is afraid she knows. We finally know where Reavers come from! That alone was pretty awesome.There were some good surprises thrown at us, things I never saw coming, and one that actually brought a tear to my eye, even when I really hadn't cared much about the characters in the series. The action is good, there's plenty of suspense and you really aren't sure, even in the end, if they're going to win or not.Granted, the wrap up of that felt a little...forced, to me, a bit on the dues ex machina end of things, but it was still satisfying. I don't think I would've preferred that they all go out in some sort of _Butch and Sundance_ sort of way. That wouldn't have felt right; I might not be a hundred percent comfortable with how this was resolved, but neither was it bad. Not completely believable, but not totally beyond the realms of belief, either. Not too bad of a mix.This movie does a pretty good job of wrapping up the series while still giving just a hint of leeway for a sequel, or even a second chance at another series. I don't see that happening, not with the networks having their heads stuck in places where sunlight is rare, but stranger things have happened and Joss has shown that he can pull off minor miracles before.",4,Better than the series,1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1703,"['having', 'sat', 'series', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'indifferent', 'towards', 'decided', 'had', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'got', 'copy', 'was', 'definitely', 'right', 'decision.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'Western', 'sight', '_Serenity_', 'was', 'problem', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'nearly', 'pure', 'sci-fi', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'Finally', 'have', 'answer', 'problem', 'River', 'see', 'how', 'Simon', 'rescued', 'what', 'Alliance', 'afraid', 'finally', 'know', 'where', 'Reavers', 'come', 'alone', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome.There', 'were', 'good', 'surprises', 'thrown', 'things', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'one', 'actually', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye', 'even', 'when', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'cared', 'much', 'characters', 'series', 'action', 'good', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'even', 'end', ""'re"", 'going', 'win', 'not.Granted', 'wrap', 'felt', 'little', 'forced', 'bit', 'dues', 'ex', 'machina', 'end', 'things', 'was', 'still', 'satisfying', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'go', 'out', 'sort', '_Butch', 'Sundance_', 'sort', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'felt', 'right', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'hundred', 'percent', 'comfortable', 'how', 'was', 'resolved', 'was', 'bad', 'Not', 'completely', 'believable', 'not', 'totally', 'realms', 'belief', 'either', 'Not', 'too', 'bad', 'mix.This', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'wrapping', 'up', 'series', 'still', 'giving', 'just', 'hint', 'leeway', 'sequel', 'even', 'second', 'chance', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'happening', 'not', 'networks', 'having', 'heads', 'stuck', 'places', 'where', 'sunlight', 'rare', 'stranger', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'Joss', 'shown', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'minor', 'miracles']",N/A

Just the simple fact of introducing that reality floored me.  I was intrigued.  The rest of the shows lived up to the high expectations that the pilot set.  Great storylines, pithy dialogue, no pandering to pre-teens with some Wesley Crusher type character.  What a shame that the network had to screw it up so badly and air episodes out of order, and then fail to pick it up for a second season.  Their ineptitude probably helped push the big screen version to the level of greatness it achieved though.Without any worry about what to do with a sequel or another season, Whedon came up with a plotline for Serenity that wasn't burdened by the necessity for a feel-good ending where everyone survives.  I thought it was incredible that not only did he choose to ""off"" a few of the major characters, bu that he did it in a believable way.And let's face it, we all were hoping for some further explanation of the Reavers, right?  They were a huge menacing force throughout the series that you never really did get a grip on.  I think his decision to tie that answer into the great chase plot that went on with the assassin after them from start to finish shows what a great touch Whedon has with a story.I can't help but wonder what the HD version of this one looks like.

951450,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B000BW7QWW,magellan,"[5, 17]","Unfortunately, I have to agree with several of the other writers here, like ""all seeing eye,"" in their comments. Although I enjoyed the action sequences and special effects of the movie, which were spectacular, the movie's strengths just about end there. I still enjoyed the movie despite it's many faults, but a lot things in the movie just don't make much sense or aren't explained. The main plot idea of a telepathic teenage girl, whose powers can be a devastating weapon, although a staple of the science fiction of past decades, is more than a bit shopworn today and hardly robust enough to anchor the entire plot. The idea is also very similar to that of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, with the government trying to create the ultimate human weapon, except for the telepathy element.Two things that were well done were the planetscapes at the beginning of the movie, which are beautiful. Whedon admits he was influenced by Star Wars, and you can see some of that influence here. The movie soundtrack is good and really adds atmosphere to the movie.In this future, as Whedon says in his commentary, not much has changed. The earth is pretty much the same as it always was--there's just more of it--more people, more pollution, more politics, more intrigue, more technology, and more advanced medicine. People have colonized other worlds and migrated off planet, looking for greener pastures. So far so good. This isn't that different from hundreds of other science fiction stories.But the evil secret that the powers that be want protected is when 30 million people die when a terraforming process on a new planet goes bad. I agree again with ""all seeing eye"" in his review that this doesn't explain River Tam's disturbed psychological state. The Pax drug that is diffused into the atmosphere of the planet is the reason that all the Reavers, who were normal humans once, have been transformed into homicidal cannibals. Pax is a tranquilizer but for some reason that's not explained, it has the exact opposite effect on a small percentage of the population, which just doesn't make sense.Tranquilizers can certainly have bad side effects, such as Thorazine causing tardive dyskinesia (a type of motor tremor), Elavil causing weight gain, and others, but there are dozens of these things on the market and not one has ever, as far as I know, caused people to become homicidal maniacs. Of course in the future they may have all sorts of things we don't have now, but you'd also think they'd bother to test a drug that's going to be deployed in such a fashion and find out if it has any bad side effects. Again, this just doesn't make much sense and takes an otherwise good movie and transforms it into more of a comic book fantasy with poorly thought out and hokey science.The Reavers band together and become marauding space pirates who attack and ravage unsuspecting ships, but they look like the ubiquitous ugly, deformed, humanoid creatures from 1950s science-fiction movies. In the big chase scene, which was great, these baddies are chasing our heroes in their ground flitter. At this point we haven't seen one of them on-screen, but you can also tell they're bad guys because their ship belches out huge clouds of black smoke--so they're polluters as well as bad guys. :-) I don't mean that as a criticism so much as that it turned out to be unintentionally funny.In an early fight scene, a government agent has some sort of stun or paralytic capability, and causes one guy to fall on his sword--that being how a warrior would pay for his failure in some cultures in past centuries, as he says. Although I suppose that's true, again, the whole idea is gratuitous when used in the context of a science-fiction movie. Why would a guy five centuries in the future care about such obsolete customs?  Furthermore, in this future, China and the U.S. have combined into a superpower, but the sword the agent uses is a Japanese design, similar to a short wakazashi. Maybe he was a fan of old 20th-century Kurosawa samurai movies. :-) Still, the fight scenes with the agent, and especially the one at the end between him and Captain Malcolm, are very well done and choreographed, and I say that as a long time martial arts instructor who has occasionally trained movie actors who specialize in martial arts roles.Actually, Whedon does explain it in the commentary on the DVD, but you have to watch that to understand it. Whedon explains that part of the fun of creating a future world is getting to pick out what history you want to include. But it was still hokey.The cast is diverse enough and talented enough so that they could have been standouts if they'd had strong enough material to work with. The cast tries valiantly to make the dialog and script work, though, but unfortunately they're struggling with pretty thin gruel here, but I give them credit for trying. I give the movie three stars for all the action and special effects, which were great, especially, as  Whedon says, the movie was made on a relatively modest budget. But despite the great special effects and action, the story line and the future world imagined here just doesn't quite work. More than anti-gravity would be needed to get this future world and flick off the ground.I did like the concept of the U.S. and China merging to create a great superpower, though. That part was at least interesting.I give the director some credit also for making a movie that does a lot to fill in the backstory for his previous Firefly series. And actually, the fact that the movie was made at all after the original series was cancelled is a great tribute to Whedon. I just wish it had turned out better.",3,Great action and special effects,1149897600,"06 10, 2006",2006,5672,"['Unfortunately', 'have', 'agree', 'several', 'other', 'writers', 'here', 'seeing', 'eye',

The plots and story lines are typical, as they have to be.  But the characters, regardless of their role in the passage they all take together, relate to and interact well with each other, each having their moments without anyone stepping on anyone's toes, contributing to the successful melding that is what makes the crew become more of a family, with characters, like most families, from strange to black sheep and near everything between, of which the viewer doesn't mind becoming a part, sharing the risks, joys, and sorrows, no matter that the circumstances of their existence are tongue-in-cheek.It's good, escapist fun that won't stress your mind, good to have around for those times, every couple of years, when you want to waste some.",4,"Han Solo, meet James West.",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2329,"['short-lived', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'series', 'motion-picture', 'successor', 'Serenity', 'are', 'not', 'science', 'fiction', 'Star', 'Trek', 'forgotten', 'forged', 'first', 'fan-recall', 'TV', 'sci-fi', 'are', 'also', 'fan-based', 're-born', 'fantasy', 'rather', 'vein', 'Star', 'Wars', 'crossed', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'James', 'West', 'where', 'getting', 'too', 'specific', 'rogues', 'banded', 'eccentrics', 'usually', 'shunning', 'fleet', 'ships', 'empire', 'operate', 'own', 'varietal', 'spaceships', 'including', 'Lockheed', 'SR-71', 'Blackbird', 'seen', 'streaking', 'sky', 'landing', 'sequence', 'steal', 'collectors', 'ray-type', 'gun', 'worlds', 'moons', 'environs', 'sci-fi', 'modernistic', 'dusty', 'frontier', 'ground', 'transport', 'horses', 'hovercraft', 'armed', 'weapons', 'ranging', 'modified', 'six-shooters', 'Winchester', '1860', 'carbines', 'including', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'sawed-off', 'large-looped', 'version', 'automatic', 'large-bore', 'weapons', 'today', 'armies', 'partially-effective', 'futuristic', 'sort', 'plasma', 'hand-held', 'device', 'battling', 'beginning', 'then', 'circumventing', 'victorious', 'controlling', 'empire', 'always-questionably-legal', 'quest', 'survive', 'other', 'ship', 'competition', 'clients', 'empire', 'murderous', 'sect', 'marauders', 'feared', 'extreme', 'violence', 'who', 'always', 'threaten', 'never', 'really', 'materialize', 'climactic', 'cleverly', 'also', 'stand-alone', 'crew', 'plots-on', 'keep', 'rickety', 'spaceship', 'named', 'Serenity', 'intact', 'supplied', 'when', 'conditions', 'are', 'seldom', 'ship', 'namesake', 'plots', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'typical', 'have', 'be', 'characters', 'regardless', 'role', 'passage', 'take', 'together', 'relate', 'interact', 'well', 'other', 'having', 'moments', 'anyone', 'stepping', 'anyone', 'toes', 'contributing', 'successful', 'melding', 'what', 'crew', 'become', 'more', 'family', 'characters', 'most', 'families', 'strange', 'black', 'sheep', 'everything', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'mind', 'becoming', 'part', 'sharing', 'risks', 'joys', 'sorrows', 'matter', 'circumstances', 'existence', 'are', 'tongue-in-cheek.It', 'good', 'escapist', 'fun', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stress', 'mind', 'good', 'have', 'around', 'times', 'couple', 'years', 'when', 'want', 'waste']",N/A

951459,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000BW7QWW,Mark Baker,"[15, 16]","Back in the fall of 2002, there was a little show on FOX called FIREFLY created by Joss Whedon.  It never did well in the ratings and was pulled about half way through the season.I'll admit I was a casual fan at best of the show, watching about two thirds of the episodes.  Ironically, I really got into it after the cancellation news came out.  My biggest disappointment was that several story arcs were left with big question marks.  What exactly was going on?  Thanks to exceptionally strong sales of the show on DVD, we finally got to find out with this movie.Set 400 years in the future and a few months after the TV series ends, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew aboard the Firefly class star ship Serenity are still outlaws.  They make their living by conducting raids, sometimes for hire, and delivering black market merchandise to far parts of the galaxy.Also on board the ship is River Tam (Summer Glau), a fugitive from the intergalactic Alliance.  She was being programmed for something before she was rescued by her brother (Sean Maher).  The process has left her a shell of her old self, often babbling for no apparent reason.Her presence on the ship also makes the Serenity a much hotter item for the police of the Alliance government then it already was.  This is even more true when one Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) begins a dedicated search to return River to the program.  With the stakes raised, Malcolm makes it his mission to find the truth about River.  What he learns will send shockwaves through the galaxy and potentially bring the Alliance government to its knees.  That is, if the crew can get the truth out there for others to see.As I said, I was only a casual fan of the show and hadn't seen it since it went off the air.  Fortunately, the movie does a good job of reminding us about this particular science fiction universe before jumping into the new action.  This recap is done in an entertaining enough way not to bore those who rewatched their DVD's in preparation for the movie and contains enough background to bring new comers up to speed.Once the new information comes, the movie moves forward quickly.  Action scenes in the beginning are followed by new information that ultimate leads us to a conclusion I didn't expect.  The actors do a good job through all of this, making us care about the outcome.The show had a couple trademarks, both of which are present in the film.  While the show was a science fiction, there were western elements as well, from the planets to the old style weapons characters used.  This allows for some beautiful scenery as the ship is flying over landscapes and through horses.  Additionally, the characters had a very deadpan sense of humor that carries over well to the big screen.My only disappointment with the film was with Joss Whedon's story choices.  As with BUFFY and ANGEL, he felt the need to end this franchise with an apocalyptic finale that all the characters don't pull through.  While this is probably realistic, it's not why I go to the movies.  Also, since both the shows mentioned ended that way, it had a been there, done that feel to it, not the original climax that he was probably hoping for.I often complain when a show I like is canceled without a chance to tie up loose ends, so I'm glad this movie was made.

He was on the losing side of an intersteller civil war against the Alliance, a buraucratic, oppressive government that seems to consists of people who believe quite fervently they know better than other people how they should live their lives. Captain Reynolds and his motley crew, including his former second in command from the war, her husband the pilot, an engineer who is as cute as she is sharp with the hyper drive, a muscle bound mercenary in a constant state of mutiny, a preacher, a courtesan, and a doctor and his troubled (to say the least!) sister eck out a thin living doing odd jobs out on the frontier, some of them not exactly legal. They bicker and at times almost come to blows. Especialy due to the fact that the doctor's sister is wanted by the Alliance government for having been ""enhanced"" and damaged by a top secret government labortory.Oddly enough, this crew might well save the human race among the stars.

Perhaps if the show had started off on the SciFi channel like Battlestar Galactica instead of Fox, it would have had room to grow and build a fan base, that ironically, has grown stronger since the series was released to DVD and shown on the SciFi channel.Because Firefly was never taken down the story lines that Joss Whedon obviously started laying the groundwork for in Season 1, Whedon uses Serenity to fill in the backstory and move forward with one of the more enigmatic characters, River.  Due to scientific experimentation by the Alliance, River is an emotional and mental wreck, which conflicts with her physical grace and overwhelming intelligence.  Her brother, Simon, has risked everything he has to save River and keep her hidden from the Alliance.  The rest of the crew of Serenity, against their better judgements but in tune with their underlying sense of morality, have sheltered both Simon and River.During the series, several situations occur where the entire crew face perils associated with the Alliance's attempts to recapture Simon and River.  The movie continues that storyline with a nameless Operative, who's only mission is to recover River for the Alliance at all costs.  He pursues Serenity across the galaxy, killing whomever and destroying whatever he needs to to accomplish his goal.  In the end, the crew of Serenity discover why the Alliance view River as a threat and again, against their cutthroat natures, make the moral choice of exposing that secret.  The final showdown between the Operative/Alliance, the crew of Serenity, and a dangerous third party is spectacular.If you havent' seen Firefly, I recommend picking it up first to get some backstories for the crew.  First time viewers maybe confused by the seemingly high-tech sci-fi background of the show being mixed in with the low-tech aspects of old westerns.  I can't explain it, but it works.  All I can say is that the Serenity and its crew operate on the edge of civilization and the western frontier feel helps convey the rough-around-the-edges way in which they live and survive.  The dialogue is humorous, especially from Captain Malcolm Reynolds, despite the serious nature of the show.

I'd say that apart from the cracking effects, design, score, acting and costume, the most remarkable element is absolutely the script.

I had my gripes about firefly (hated the whole glorified Whore/""Companion"" idea) but I really got into the characters themselves. Serenity takes off where the canceled Firefly ended. But if you are new to the whole world of Firefly/Serenity then it will definately take away about half the enjoyment of the movie. Why? Because Serenity is a ""Great"" 'continuation' of the series and a ""Good"" stand-alone movie. If you've never seen the Firefly series but watch Serenity, here are a few questions you probably will be asking after:1. How did Mal and the crew meet each other and how did they end up on Serenity?2. Who or what is a 'Sheperd' and why did he leave Serenity?3. When Jayne and Mal were arguing on the ship, what ""War"" was he talking about that made Mal and Zoe get so upset?4. Why did Inara leave Serenity?These are some of the questions new-comers will probably be asking after seeing Serenity. Now Firefly fans know that these questions are all answered in the series' episodes. If you check, most of the people who gave this movie 1-3 stars have admitted to never actually seeing firefly. But I think the movie felt short and they could have added more onto it to make it more fulfilling, like doing something more with the Mal and Inara relationship (hopefully to stop her from selling her body), or show some new flashback scenes from the war of 'Serenity Valley' to answer question number 3 and further grip fans.So why the 5 stars?

951482,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B000BW7QWW,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[18, 20]","For fans of the prematurely cancelled ""Firefly"" series, Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" will be an early Christmas present, full of delightful touches, references to the series, and hints about answers we have longed looked for.Unlike many television shows transferred to the big screen, however, ""Serenity"" is a movie that can stand on its own merit as a solid space opera, enjoyable for everyone, not just ""Firefly"" geeks. It also proves that a good movie doesn't require star-power; ""Serenity"" boasts no superstar names or big-time directors, but the performances are all heartfelt, with a quality of realness and depth frequently lacking in genre movies. Unlike the Star Wars prequels, we can believe the characters of ""Serenity"" are not only real, but are like us. Indeed, Whedon has a sense of classic space opera that Lucas should envy.Joss Whedon's vision of the future - once described to me as ""Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first"" - is possibly the most original I've encountered in movies of this kind, an amalgam of Westerns, science fiction, and classic fantasy, sprinkled liberally with Chinese culture. This is a world where characters dress like cowboys, fly spaceships, and curse in Mandarin. But despite this seemingly non sequitur mix, Whedon manages to blend it all into a cohesive, engaging whole.And how it does engage! The film opens with a lesson on the colonization of other worlds - in a process called ""terraforming,"" supposedly making other planets similarly inhabitable to ""Earth-that-was"" - and how the Alliance (a powerful and hyper-controlling government coalition) made war on the lesser colonists, the Independence movement (or ""Browncoats""). The Alliance won. Now the war is discussed in sterile classrooms, where the children don't understand why anyone would resist the ""progressive"" Alliance.Nobody except a young girl named River Tam, that is. She is precocious, sensitive, brilliant; we sense she is probably too smart for her own good. And this proves true as we are jolted from the bright white summer classroom to an unfriendly blue-lit lab, where an older River is being experimented on by the Alliance. Doctors have taken her natural intelligence and grace and made her a weapon, a deeply empathetic psychic with extraordinary gifts as a ""Reader"" and an assassin's knack for martial arts combat. The side-effects of this procedure have left River prone to psychotic episodes, a damaged and mentally fragile seventeen-year old who says things that even she doesn't understand.Her brother Simon, a talented doctor, rescues her from this (at the expense of his career and his fortune), and from this rescue the film's perspective shifts again, this time to a nameless Operative whose sole purpose is to capture River and bring her back. He is a ""believer,"" with a dangerous conviction that finding River is necessary to bring about the utopia he envisions as the future, and an unshakable belief that nothing is too great a sacrifice in his quest. He will find River and kill her, and if doing so means killing everyone in his way, then that is an acceptable sacrifice. Nothing, it seems, is more dangerous than belief.What he does not know is that River and Simon have been hiding on the spaceship Serenity. Serenity's crew are a strange mix: warrior woman Zoe, geeky pilot Wash, gentle and sweet mechanic Kaylee, and Jayne, a blunt, man's man type who loves his guns but has his tender moments too. Leading this ragtag crew is Captain Mal Reynolds, a man of great determination, who we sense is at heart a good man, but not without flaws. They speak in a blend of nineteenth-century Western, futuristic tech-talk,  and Whedon's trademark dry, wacky humor; ""Serenity"" may just have the most original dialogue this year. Most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes - there is not the time in a two-hour movie for ""Firefly""'s development-heavy style - but they engage our emotions in a surprisingly deep way; by the time bad things start happening to them, we care. Very much.And happen they do, often in ways we are not expecting. The plot is many-layered and complex; it will suffice to say that River, a psychic exposed to a roomful of government officials, knows terrible secrets that the Alliance wants contained at any cost. Keeping River from the Alliance Operative and trying to discover the truth about what horrific knowledge is eating at her brain provides the framework for the action, of which there is a great deal, forming a sort of highly-engrossing space chase that Lucas only dreams of.There are no aliens in ""Serenity."" The principal enemy is the Alliance and its nameless assassin, but there are other foes as well. The most horrific of these are the Reavers, a gruesome, nearly-mythological band of mutilated men. They were once human, we are told, but having gone to the furthest reaches of space despaired and forgot themselves, cutting on their own flesh and cannibalizing others. The truth, as we learn, is more simple and more harrowing.It is touches like these that make Whedon's world simultaneously so familiar and so foreign, and ultimately so fascinating to watch. ""Serenity"" succeeds not only as a space adventure, full of strange sights and stirring battles, but as a character-driven story that grabs us, pulls us in, and forces us to care about its people. It delivers on both counts with a gripping, homespun immediacy unlike anything else I've seen.A warning for devoted Browncoats: there are moments that will make you laugh, moments that will shock you, and moments that you will deny until the end. I haven't cried this much in a movie since ""Return of the King"" - and I am not one who routinely weeps at the movies. I also haven't laughed this much at the movies this year. ""Serenity"" has joy and sorrow, humor and pain, loss and sacrifice and gain. Whedon has succeeded in crafting an elegant, gripping story that fully captures our imaginations and our hearts. Here's hoping there are many more to come.",5,Space Adventure with a Story,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,6014,"['fans', 'prematurely', 'cancelled', 'Firefly', 'series', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Serenity',

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[3, 3]","After a short-lived (15-episode) sci-fi TV series named ""Firefly"" that aired between 2002 and 2003 was canceled, a large cult following had developed.  Series producer/creator Joss Whedon (who created & produced the 1997-2003 TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", as well as the 1999-2004 TV series ""Angel"") was able to direct and write the 2005 film ""Serenity"" based upon the ""Firefly"" TV series and let the cast of the TV series reprise their roles in the film.  Taking place some 500 years in the future, a former galactic war veteran named Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) is the captain of a transport ship named ""Serenity"".  His hired crew includes Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres), pilot Hoban 'Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk), former soldier Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) and engineer Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite).  With mankind having ravished the Earth, humans have colonized other planets and satellites, which are under the control of a totalitarian government called the Alliance.  Simon Tam (Sean Maher) helps to rescue his sister River (Summer Glau) from the Alliance, which has experimented on her brain, giving her strong telepathic powers.  Taking refuge aboard Serenity, Mal and his crew protect Simon & River, but also discover some horrible secrets about Alliance activities & cover-ups while a highly trained Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) hunts them down.With superb special effects, great cinematography, a gripping plot and very engaging characters, ""Serenity"" was a superb piece of science fiction and higly deserving of a 5 out of 5 star rating. Sadly, while the film received much attention & awards from various science fiction academies, it received no attention from the Academy Awards.  Other notable characters from the film include Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz) and Inara (Morena Baccarin).

951497,A3TUZOJZM9008Y,B000BW7QWW,"Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia""","[10, 14]","Writer/director Joss Whedon had a daunting task ahead of him when making ""Serenity"". He had to appeal to a hearty fan following, and bring in people who were new to the product. Did he succeed? We'll see when the box office numbers star rolling in. But here is my assessment.From the fan side of things, not only are you battling their desire to see more of their beloved ""Firefly."" But you are also at odds with the anticipation of the new episode. Anticipation can kill a movie before it gets started. How do you live up to three years of desire? On this, I was initially worried. The first scenes are a little slow moving, though important from an exposition standpoint. Ultimately though, from the fan perspective, I believe the movie is a roaring success. Even though some of the primary cast get little more than a scene or two.Captain Malcolm Reynolds - Mal is a much darker version of the character from the series. Rarely do we see the mischief. That gleam in his eyes. This time out, he's deadly serious. Credit Whedon and Nathan Fillion for taking that kind of a chance with their leading man.Wash - One of the great elements of the series was the occasional Wash wisecrack. Even if it was in Chinese. Alan Tudyk is given a couple of moments, but nothing memorable.Zoe - Aside from the usual, Zoe doesn't get a lot of play here either. Her one big moment comes off more like her one big half-moment.Kaylee - Curiously, our little Kaylee has taken to verbally slapping Mal around. Obviously less meek than in the series, she keeps turning the knife in his back in a way that was formally in playful jest.Jayne - The big, out for himself, lug has some fun lines. Almost all of which have been in the trailers. And he seems uncharacteristically heroic in the action scenes. Protecting others before worrying about himself. The rest of the time, he's Jayne.Simon Tam - The good doc gets more to do than some of his shipmates. He also seems to be the same person we knew from the series. Focused on helping his sister recover from what the government did to her.River Tam - Second only to Mal, this is her movie. Summer Glau acquits herself fairly well in the action sequences. She's a dancer, and Whedon took full advantage of that with the fight choreography.Inara - Morena Baccarin looks great on screen. No doubt about it. For the life of me, I can't remember if she actually has any lines in this movie.Shepherd Book - Gets a couple of nice little scenes with Mal. Not much else.Apparently, a number of scenes were shot which would appeal more to the fan base. But Whedon excised them in favor of making the film less in-joke and more accessible. While they may end up on the DVD, he's vowed against a ""Director's Cut"" of the film. Maybe we won't have to suffer the endless ""Really, Really Special Edition"" DVDs here.Trying to forget what I know about the show, I think the movie will play alright for the uninitiated.

Tresca ""Talien""","[11, 12]","I tried to walk away from this movie, but Serenity wouldn't let me.My wife rented Serenity after watching it at a science fiction convention, but the DVD skipped at a critical part.  She was so frustrated that she got up and left.  So she finally rented Serenity from Netflix and, on Mother's Day, brought it over to watch with my parents.  I had no intention of watching the movie.I was about to go upstairs and do something else.  But I forgot whatever it was I planned to do. I stood on the stairs, looking over my shoulder as the credits rolled.  And I stood there for five minutes, transfixed. A few minutes later, I sat down and watched the whole film.Serenity's that good.I could talk about the universe, or the characters, but what makes Serenity so fantastic is good old movie craftsmanship.  The cinematography is amazing, the CGI work appropriate, the acting on target, and the writing intentionally different, different enough to let us know that Joss Whedon is winking as he tells his story, the story he never got to finish on network television.  And that's ironic, because I am not a Firefly fan.I liked the concept: cowboys in space.  The Chinese slang, the idea that planets are new frontiers, good guys that look like bad guys and vice versa...it was all there.  It was like a retelling of Han Solo's life, without any reference to the Force.But the show?  Didn't do it for me.  I'm not a fan of Joss Whedon's dialogue.  His characters sometimes adopt a Tarantino-esque patter that's too perfect, such that I feel like I'm watching puppets on the screen instead of real characters.There's no trace of that problem in Serenity.  In the first five minutes, Whedon changes realities not once but twice, keeping you guessing about when the film's narrative will abruptly shift direction for a third time.  And once you're engrossed, Serenity never lets go.The cast is richly used, no small feat when there's so many: Zoe (Gina Torres) and her pilot-husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), Jayne the thug (Adam Baldwin), cute-as-a-button Kaylee (Jewel Statie), and two new stragglers: the handsome Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and her sister River (Summer Glau).River is the primary focus of the film.  She is an escaped test subject and a super weapon in her own right, but it's the knowledge locked in her head that is so dangerous to the oppressive Alliance.  Thus, we have the coolest villain in awhile--so cool he could be straight from Equilibrium, and that's saying something--The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  The Operative believes in old style honor and the value of a dream.  And because The Operative believes, he is the most dangerous kind of enemy.  He commits some atrocious crimes and tears up the universe looking for River. And in doing so, he causes a desperate captain (Nathan Fillion as Mal) to return to his warrior roots with a vengeance.Important characters die.  Desperate plots are hatched.  Characters faced with by-the-book dilemmas react to them in uncharacteristic ways, surprising the audience and themselves with the outcome.  And yet we still get space battles, fisticuffs, swordfights, romance, and plenty of humor.Serenity is Whedon's masterpiece, but make no mistake: it's because the director knows his medium and knows it well.  It's in this tightly produced film, rather than the series, that the cast and Whedon finally gel to make the best damn science fiction film in recent years.",5,"I tried to walk away, but Serenity wouldn't let me",1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,3419,"['tried', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'me.My', 'wife', 'rented', 'Serenity', 'watching', 'science', 'fiction', 'convention', 'DVD', 'skipped', 'critical', 'part', 'was', 'so', 'frustrated', 'got', 'up', 'left', 'finally', 'rented', 'Serenity', 'Netflix', 'Mother', 'Day', 'brought', 'over', 'watch', 'parents', 'had', 'intention', 'watching', 'movie.I', 'was', 'go', 'upstairs', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'forgot', 'was', 'planned', 'do', 'stood', 'stairs', 'looking', 'shoulder', 'credits', 'rolled', 'stood', 'five', 'minutes', 'transfixed', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'whole', 'film.Serenity', 'good.I', 'could', 'talk', 'universe', 'characters', 'what', 'Serenity', 'so', 'fantastic', 'good', 'old', 'movie', 'craftsmanship', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'CGI', 'work', 'appropriate', 'acting', 'target', 'writing', 'intentionally', 'different', 'different', 'enough', 'let', 'know', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'winking', 'story', 'story', 'never', 'got', 'finish', 'network', 'television', 'ironic', 'am', 'not', 'Firefly', 'fan.I', 'liked', 'concept', 'cowboys', 'space', 'Chinese', 'slang', 'idea', 'planets', 'are', 'new', 'frontiers', 'good', 'guys', 'look', 'bad', 'guys', 'vice', 'versa', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'retelling', 'Han', 'Solo', 'life', 'reference', 'Force.But', 'show', 'Did', ""n't"", 'do', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'adopt', 'Tarantino-esque', 'patter', 'too', 'perfect', 'such', 'feel', ""'m"", 'watching', 'puppets', 'screen', 'instead', 'real', 'trace', 'problem', 'Serenity', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'Whedon', 'changes', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'keeping', 'guessing', 'when', 'film', 'narrative', 'will', 'abruptly', 'shift', 'direction', 'third', 'time', 'once', ""'re"", 'engrossed', 'Serenity', 'never', 'go.The', 'cast', 'richly', 'used', 'small', 'feat', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'Zoe', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'pilot-husband', 'Wash', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Jayne', 'thug', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Kaylee', 'Jewel', 'Statie', 'two', 'new', 'stragglers', 'handsome', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'sister', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'primary', 'focus', 'film', 'escaped', 'test', 'subject', 'super', 'weapon', 'own', 'right', 'knowledge', 'locked', 'head', 'so', 'dangerous', 'oppressive', 'Alliance', 'Thus', 'have', 'coolest', 'villain', 'awhile', 'so', 'cool', 'could', 'be', 'straight', 'Equilibrium', 'saying', 'something', 'Operative', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'Operative', 'old', 'style', 'honor', 'value', 'dream', 'Operative', 'most', 'dangerous', 'kind', 'enemy', 'atrocious', 'crimes', 'up', 'universe', 'looking', 'River', 'doing', 'so', 'desperate', 'captain', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Mal', 'return', 'warrior', 'roots', 'vengeance.Important', 'characters', 'die', 'Desperate', 'plots', 'are', 'hatched', 'Characters', 'faced', 'by-the-book', 'dilemmas', 'react', 'uncharacteristic', 'ways', 'surprising', 'audience', 'outcome', 'yet', 'still', 'get', 'space', 'battles', 'fisticuffs', 'swordfights', 'romance', 'plenty', 'humor.Serenity', 'Whedon', 'masterpiece', 'make', 'mistake', 'director', 'medium', 'well', 'tightly', 'produced', 'film', 'rather', 'series', 'cast', 'Whedon', 'finally', 'make', 'best', 'damn', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'recent', 'years']",N/A

951507,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B000BW7QWW,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[12, 13]","Success is not without its fair share of pitfalls as perennial cult-favorite Joss Whedon knows all too well. Following the fruition of his horror/drama television series on the WB network, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and its eventual spin-off, Angel, Whedon set to work on a new drama for FOX entitled Firefly, a science-fiction series blended with a nostalgic western style to its storylines. The series however was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Although it did manage to successfully recruit a loyal fan base during its short run in the United States, a group which would more commonly be referred to later on as the Brown Coats, low ratings led executives at the FOX television network to cancel the show after only eleven episodes. Reasons for its early cancellation are attributed to its late-Friday evening timeslot, in which it was often preempted by sporting events, FOX's inability to properly promote the program as a character-based drama, and the airing of the series' episodes out of chronological order. Fans of the program quickly assembled the Firefly Immediate Assistance Campaign to revive the series, perhaps on another network, but were unable to do so. However, the remarkable profitability of the complete series' DVD sales prompted series creator Joss Whedon to team-up with Universal Pictures to spawn a full-length feature film based on the now-defunct series entitled Serenity in an effort to revive the once thought dead cult-classic.The story for Serenity is truly one of the most originative and flat-out awe-inspiring scripts to grace domestic movie theatres with its presence in the last few years, let alone this year. The dialogue is especially crisp and brilliantly crafted with each of the characters and their actions onscreen. At first glance the specific word usage would conceivably fall flat in regards to the demographic with which the feature film is aimed toward, this being young adults, but surprisingly it never once feels out of place or awkwardly constructed. Instead it flows genially throughout the picture. The one downside it has however is the amount of confusion the film may cause for those unfamiliar with the now-defunct television series, Firefly, which now appears in a DVD box set. This is not necessarily the fault of series creator Joss Whedon who took it upon himself to attempt the daunting task of having to balance within his own script - (a) a certain proportion of the viewing audience which needs to be brought up to date, at the very least minimally, on the individual character storylines and (b) appealing to the loyal following of Browncoats, the nickname given to fans of the short-lives series, without pissing off or demeaning either side off. That being said, it is not recommended that anyone unfamiliar with the series go into this film without at least some basic concept as to what the characters are all about. This would go so far as to suggest watching a few episodes of Firefly now playing on the Sci-Fi television network or renting the series on DVD and taking in a few episodes before viewing the movie.Many, if not all, of the recurring characters of the Firefly television series return to their respective role in the feature film adaptation. While their performances are pretty much the same as they were on the small screen, not a complaint in the least, each performer seems to take their role up a notch in the transition to the silver screen. Nathan Fillion is one of the major stars of the picture and the one likely to benefit the most from Serenity's critical acclaim. Comparisons to Star Wars' Han Solo are expected to be made toward Fillion's Captain Malcolm Reynolds whose `shoot first, ask questions later' attitude often gets him over his head. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the perfect adversary to Captain Malcolm Reynolds, an avowed atheist, in the role of The Operative simply because unlike Reynolds he believes adamantly in what he is fighting for. Surprisingly he is not the villain audiences might expect. He is perfectly admirable, relinquishing his `sword' so to speak at the end when the cause he has fought valiantly for has been defeated. It is only his cause that is immoral but because he believes in it, again, unlike Reynolds, we have to respect him for it. And Summer Glau is wonderful in the role of River Tam. There are moments, in particular a scene in which the crew returns from a heist and she delivers the line, ""I swallowed a bug"", where she is perfectly adorable. Then you have scenes, especially near the end of the film, in which she able to show off her action skills. Hopefully she will have more opportunities to work in feature films thanks to this film.Overall, Serenity, whether it is viewed by certified Brown Coats or green horns, is an innovative motion-picture event, a true rarity in a year overflowing with lifeless big-budget action flicks and extraneous sequels, with something for nearly everyone, from breathtaking special effects and solid performances to splashes of well-timed dark humor and inspiration religious message every audience member no matter what their religious affiliation can take to heart. Series creator and film director Joss Whedon, a man quite familiar with using theological subtexts within his works, designed Serenity specifically as a means in which to answer the question his now-defunct science-fiction series attempted to ask. The driving force behind the power of belief is that we as human beings conceptualize of a greater power in the universe, greater then ourselves, which controls every aspect of our lives down to our very actions. We however still retain the ability to decide for ourselves whether we should follow the right or the wrong path in life and the level at which we are willing, or unwilling, to give up a part of ourselves to a higher purpose in life will help us in making that decision. Serenity does not pull for one particular faith over another. Although Shepard Book is Christian, audiences would only know of this if they were to watch the television series. However, atheism, a concept to which Captain Malcolm Reynolds applies himself toward for a majority of the picture, is strongly condemned in the film. Mal has a moral code but because he does not belief in anything, let alone God, he can not comprehend what it fully means. This causes him to do stupid thing and risk the safety of his crew as he does. According to Serenity, it does not matter what religion we affiliate ourselves with as long as we believe in something. It may be a tad nave to say the least but, on the other hand, it isn't preachy with its message which is often hard to find, especially in Hollywood. The Joss Whedon helmed picture does have other things besides a motivating message going for it. As low-budget as this action adventure is, roughly thirty-nine million dollars according to studio estimates, the special effects, in particular the stunning aerial acrobatic chase sequence near the end of the film, are positively stunning. Furthermore, Serenity's musical score, a wonderful blending of nostalgic western ballads and mysterious futuristic accompaniments, is brilliantly composed by David Newman. Serenity benefits substantially from a brilliantly witty and charming script from series creator Joss Whedon.

Serenity takes the series up to a whole new level and it packs a wallop of a good time and come on, Joss Whedon knows how to please his fans of Firefly and of course Buffy and Angel. Simon Tam, played by Sean Maher rescues his sister River Tam, played by Summer Glau because their doing experiments on her, putting things in her head, images. Their picked up by Serenity, and the crew consists of Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, played by the always fantastic Nathan Fillion (Tv's Buffy, Water's Edge) and he is superb here, the pilot Wash, played by funny man Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, 28 Days) and his wife Zoey, played by Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Matrix Revolutions). Tough and Ready To Rumble Jayne, played by a kooky Adam Baldwin (Tv's Angel, Independence Day). Kaylee Frye, played by the adorable Jewel Staite who's an engineer and knows a lot about ships and how to fix them and who also is in love with Doctor Simon Tam. They rob a vault in one town on a planet and wind up being chased down by the Reavers, crazy as hell dudes who pillage and kill people just for the hell of it and their ships consist of human bones and blood. The Operative, played by a calm, cool and wicked Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Dirty Pretty Things), wants to kill River Tam because within her lies a secret they want to bury. The crew find out that River Tam can get a little bit on the violent side as she is triggered. Later, the gang find out the secret of the  world ""Miranda"", a small planet with Reavers inhabiting it's orbit and they find that everyone on the planet it dead because whoever it was wanted everyone to get along but it went array and some of the people turned mean, raged, hence why there are The Reavers. So, the gang go to Mr. Universe, played by David Krumholtz (Tv's Numbers) in an amusing role to try to spread the word on what the alliance did to Miranda and what the outcome came...that's if they make it in time, and alive. Fast, lean, awesome....even better then Firefly, filled with that great Joss Whedon touch of humor, action, romance and drama. One of the best movies of the year so far, by far greater then, yes I  am saying this and I mean it, Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith....so long George Lucas..who cares if your movie made millions of dollars at the box office, Serenity is here to stay and hopefully Joss Whedon gets to do more of this down the line..say and Angel movie or something or a new Buffy movie....the first one wasnt that great...let's hope. Whedon kills off two main characters from the series, Alan Tudyk's Wash and Ron Glass's Shepard Book.

My patience paid off.For someone like myself who is a Science Fiction fan, I was awestruck at how well made ""Serenity"" is!What I also liked is that Joss Whedon wrote the script so that seeing the T.V. show is not mandatory in order to see the movie.This flick certainly ranks up there with the Star Wars series in my book. Solid acting, good chemistry between the cast, great story line, excellent special effects and nail-biting action scenes.In this film, we get to see a little bit more about how and why River is the way she is and find out the origin of the Reavers.In a way, I was glad about what happened to the Operative but disappointed by what happened to 2 of the original Serenity crewmembers.The movie is so good, you will come to care about the Serenity crew, laugh and possibly cry at the situations they are in too. You pull for the Serenity crew throughout the entire film.These guys are the outcasts. The people others tend to ignore on the streets trying to make a living. This is their story showing the good and bad times I think we can all associate with.I plan on seeing this movie again, will buy it when it comes out on DVD and hope sequels are in the works.Well made movies like this deserve a second viewing.I hope the release of ""Serenity"" means that Hollywood will be releasing films emphasizing real stories and characters rather than every tired, warmed over sequel, remake, and hack television drivel that was released during the summer.

When I first saw this in the theater I had not watched the tv series, so it did not make as much sense and the moments that were supposed to have the emotional impact just did not have as much of one.  Most people reading this will likely have already seen the series, but for those who have not, it was originally a show on Fox, that the network totally screwed over by airing episodes out of order and changing when it was aired so it could never gain a foothold.  Then it was cancelled basically without warning.The movie basically wraps up the series to show us where the story would have ultimately gone.  We start by seeing River broken out of the facility she was in, and ultimately find out what she knew and what was causing her mental instability.  From the outset her character does a lot more than she had in the series up to that point, and Summer Glau does a great job with it.Like pretty much all of Joss Whedon's TV shows and movies, this blends action, comedy and drama.  There are funny moments within tense moments (that are even funnier if you have the background from the series), and the acting and writing are both top notch.  The movie on its own is very good, the movie after having watched the series in the order the series was meant to be seen is awesome. For what it was trying to do (tell the entire story of what could have been spread out over multiple TV seasons in two hours), the movie accomplished that very well.  It is unfortunate that this and the series are all we are ever likely to have of this story.  It will forever be relegated to cult classic status, but if you give it a chance you will be glad you did.",5,I aim to misbehave,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1732,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'Firefly', 'should', 'do', 'so', 'before', 'watching', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'tv', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'moments', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'emotional', 'impact', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'Most', 'people', 'reading', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'was', 'originally', 'show', 'Fox', 'network', 'totally', 'screwed', 'airing', 'episodes', 'order', 'changing', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'could', 'never', 'gain', 'foothold', 'Then', 'was', 'cancelled', 'basically', 'warning.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'up', 'series', 'show', 'where', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'ultimately', 'gone', 'start', 'seeing', 'River', 'broken', 'facility', 'was', 'ultimately', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'causing', 'mental', 'instability', 'outset', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'had', 'series', 'up', 'point', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'great', 'job', 'it.Like', 'pretty', 'much', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'action', 'comedy', 'drama', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'tense', 'moments', 'are', 'even', 'funnier', 'have', 'background', 'series', 'acting', 'writing', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'movie', 'own', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'having', 'watched', 'series', 'order', 'series', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'awesome', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spread', 'out', 'multiple', 'TV', 'seasons', 'two', 'hours', 'movie', 'accomplished', 'very', 'well', 'unfortunate', 'series', 'are', 'are', 'ever', 'likely', 'have', 'story', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'relegated', 'cult', 'classic', 'status', 'give', 'chance', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A
951512,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000BW7QWW,Miles D. Moore,"[0, 0]","Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is a worthy followup to the much-loved, short-lived series ""Firefly,"" as well as a valentine to the thousands of fans who refused to let the show die after the Fox Network canceled it in 2002. It is less a sequel than a continuation of the series, picking up the action several months after the events of the last episode. The crew of the Serenity finds itself in greater peril than ever, as an Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his storm troopers target River Tam (Summer Glau) for death.The main value of ""Serenity"" to fans--besides reuniting the cast and allowing a bigger budget for special effects--is in providing further crucial details about the story of River, what happened to her in Alliance custody, and why the Alliance wants her dead. Reviewers have reasonably debated whether ""Serenity"" works as a stand-alone movie; I don't think it does. You really need to know who these characters are, how they relate to each other, and the society in which they live to truly appreciate ""Serenity,"" which means you should probably have seen at least a few episodes of ""Firefly"" before you watch the movie.Whedon's writing is as sharp as ever, as are the performances of the ensemble cast. Whedon never shied away from sorrow and tragedy in ""Firefly,"" but ""Serenity"" frees him from the narritive necessities of a weekly series, allowing him (without giving away any plot points) to bring the tragedy closer to home. Personally, I wish he hadn't done that, though I salute his courage.The DVD includes a generous selection of deleted scenes and outtakes in the Bonus section, as well as Whedon's self-deprecating introduction to the movie and scenes from the appearance of Whedon and the ""Serenity"" cast at a ComicCon convention. It is touching and heartening to see them engulfed by the love of their fans.

951514,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,B000BW7QWW,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[20, 21]","""Serenity"" works on so many levels, and fails on so few, it's a shame the public didn't absolutely fall in love with Joss Whedon's wholly original yet comfortably derivative universe.Comparisons to ""Star Wars"" are valid, in that George Lucas took several, infinitely familiar themes, scenarios and characters, and combined them into a creation clearly his own.That's what you get here.The argument whether or not you need to see the TV series before is moot: if you haven't yet seen it, you will desperately want to after seeing this movie.The characters are simply a delight to watch interact with each other. Nathan Fillion, as the leader of the band, Mal Reynolds, is one of the great, recent heroes of filmdom. He's got the gravitas, the humor, the physicality...he's the real deal. The supporting cast is so good, you wish the movie was longer, but THAT'S why you'll go back to the DVD box of the TV show. You will love spending more time with these guys......yes, most of them (in this film) are carefully drawn with a few lines and scenes; they don't have the depth they displayed during the series...but they CAN'T in under two hours. Believe me...the actress playing Inora ""the companion"" (Morena Baccarin)is one of the most startlingly beautiful actresses I've ever seen. She's given a criminally small amount of screen time and should have been a bigger part of this film. Just because I wanted to see more of her. The brief scenes between her and Fillion just beg for more time...Much has been made about some of the tragedy being less significant if you haven't seen the preceding TV series. I wouldn't make too much about that point. Again, comparing this to ""Star Wars"", the death of Obi-Wan has more resonance now than it did when only the first film existed, but it still worked in that first film.But I'm being selfish...Whedon's film serves the story, and serves it well. He also tidies up many of the over-arching plot themes from the TV show, but not so much that he doesn't leave us begging for more. That's quite the high-wire, tightrope balancing act.The sinister Alliance, the impossibly nightmarish Reavers and that relentless, sword-carrying automaton combine to form a genuinely terrifying set of ""bad guys"".The action scenes are marvelous. There are fights and stunts that, by necessity, you've seen before (the cinematic Rolodex inside your head will start clicking off recollections of ""Aliens"", ""Raiders""...), and then they tweak them in ways you would have never imagined.The chase scenes in space are breathtaking. I loved the punctuating silences as opposed to the expected bombastic whooshes and crashes.The terrestrial hovercraft chase is a model of how things like this should be done.The ""airplane crash"" scene is a pleasant torture to sit through.There are small things, like Fillion's makeup near the end of the film. that add enormously to the movie. He looks like he got the crap beat out of him. Not because there were huge welts and dramatic bruises and blood-spattered clothing. It was all artful makeup and one disturbing contact lens. And of course, some phenomenal acting...There's one short scene, where one character says nothing but ""yes"" over and over again, and another character says ""no"" in response, as both are staring out a windshield. We as the audience do not have to see what's going on, to completely understand what exactly is happening out that window. It's a brilliant bit of writing and acting.A few pointers for those new to the Firefly Universe.Yes, they occasionally lapse into untranslated Chinese. English and Chinese are the two dominant languages in the future, and believe me, what they say needs no translation.Yes, they use a combination of old-fashioned weapons (six-guns) and sci-fi ""ray guns"", but it all works.Yes, a lot of this looks like the old West, but the frontier of a ""terraformed"" system of planets may look exactly like that.There's really not a weak moment in the film. This is the first film in a long time where I had an all-consuming desire to watch it again.

Lohrke,"[5, 6]","as a recent convert to the joss whedon world, i probably should've watched the 'firefly' series before jumping into 'serenity.'  i might have a better understanding of the core characters and backstory, but that in no way prevented me from thoroughly enjoying 'serenity.'comparisons to other 'sci-fi' flicks are inevitable.  while i don't normally like to compare films to other films (i think books, movies and films should generally be judged on their own merits, not for what they aren't or what they're similar to), i think in this case the comparisons to star wars are pretty justified.  i think it's safe to say that 'serenity' is a superior film than any of the star wars prequels and here's why: whedon uses actual physical locations when shooting.  where lucas relied on antiseptic, cgi worlds, whedon's worlds are organic and real, and it gives the movie a lot more credibility.  these are 'real' places--not a green screen. the movie absolutely benefits from it.whedon is also great at directing his actors.  i watched 'serenity' a second time with whedon's commentary (he's a joy to listen to, by the way. he's full of self-effacing humor, wit, and warmth), and he talked about how he'd often reshoot scenes dozens of times until he had the take he wanted. i doubt lucas ever did more than one or two takes. the actors, for their part, are great. they're fully-fleshed, multi-dimensional, flawed, and heroic.  nathan fillion's 'mal' is the ideal gang-leader with sometimes questionable morals, but he does what he believes it right, and more often than not he is.  the crew (i don't know all their names yet) are fantastic in his or her own way.  zoe and wash's marriage is sweet, kaylee's crush on simon is sincere, jayne's machismo is stereotypical but believable, and inara, well, she's just hot. you can tell the actors love what they're doing and it makes you pull for them all the more.  the secret weapon of the cast is summer glau's 'river tam.' she's one heckuva an actress.  she's 100% convincing as the troubled prodigy holding a terrible secret.  in her fight scenes she's nothing short of a revelation.  glau's training as a dancer obviously benefits the character.  her scenes with her brother, simon, are devastating.  in the commentary whedon comments on how summer was nervous her dramatic scenes, but she pulled them off so effectively that she had the crew behind the camera in tears by the time she was finished.  i was in tears, too.  she's that good.  she does a beautiful job of balancing the her role as a human weapon and the holder of terrible secrets.  where her performance anything less than it was, 'serenity' would have been a significantly inferior film. (and to learn that the bulk summer's fight scene against the reavers was done essentially done in one take is incredible).finally, whedon's dialogue is almost second-to-none.  he injects a lot of geniune warmth and humor--something totally lost in the star wars prequels. each character, it seems, has a foil--someone to banter with--and whedon fully takes advantage of it.  the banter is great, witty, and just plain fun.  whedon's characters are so fully fleshed that we're able to see their different facets through whedon's dialogue.in all, 'serenity' is a great film, one i wish i had seen on the big screen. it really *is* a sci-fi western.  and it's great. i'm off to netflix to rent the 'firefly' series.  it's too bad 'firefly' didn't have a longer life.  i don't think 'serenity' faired to well at the box office, either.  i don't think anymore sequels are likely, but it'd be nice to see one some day.  thanks, joss & co.(it makes me sad to wonder what star wars would've been

In Joss Whedon's film 'Serenity', he gives us such a moment, and it's the kind that inspires goosebumps, tingles, and lumps in the throat.Firefly fans already know the back stories, both that of the doomed TV series and that of the little band of smugglers aboard the flying chicken.  On paper, it all sounds like another science fiction franchise that should have faded into obscurity along with scores of others.  But Joss Whedon has a knack for storytelling, and if anyone could deliver a quality Sci-Fi product, he'd be your guy.  Some of the elements are right off the shelf (just reach in blindly and close your hand around a dozen or so), and the fugitive brother and sister hitching a ride with a smuggler on a goofy-looking space freighter and playing keep-away from an enormously powerful and evil intergalactic organization might sound a bit familiar, but the story is thoroughly engrossing.  Most of the characters seem quite aware that they're in a SciFi movie, but they make it fun instead of getting mired in the usual self-important drudgery.  Nathan Fillion and Jewel Staite, in particular, throw out the kind of cheeky, out-of-line humor that fans of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' will appreciate.  One area where science fiction has really succeeded over the years has been in giving us cool new villains, and here we get The Operative, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor as a gentleman with a Samurai sword and an icily pleasant demeanor, sort of the Miles Drentell of SciFi movie nemeses.  Summer Glau's work as River is emotionally devastating, miles from the wooden performances we've come to expect from the B-level talent often associated with science fiction.  She has helped create a haunting, original character who, understandably, has an adoring cult following.  Joss Whedon has a thing for female characters who seem fragile, seem to need the protection of those around them, then emerge as suprisingly strong and capable just when the others need, well, a hero.  When River's moment arrives, she is equal to the challenge.(All this is coming from someone who despises science fiction.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars; that's more closely aligned with how good I think it is.  Most SciFi movies and TV series make the mistake of going all the way into outer space and years into the future so that they can tell a story that could have been told better in another genre.  The trappings of SciFi, with the aliens, gadgetry, and other techno-nonsense, usually seem like childish, unnecessary distractions from underdeveloped human elements.  With 'Serenity', Joss Whedon has a story that cannot be told in any other way, and his film is a success because he makes creative and effective use of the genre to serve his needs.

However, you will benefit greatly from watching the 15 episodes of Firefly before watching this.  After all, the chances are you will be so hooked you will only want to go back and watch them anyway.For those who love Firefly, this is a fitting continuation ( I can't bring myself to say conclusion, as I can't bear the thought that it would end here) answering some of the threads left hanging when the series so rudely ended.Nathan Fillion is captain of a small Firefly class ship - he is a disillusioned ex soldier from the losing side of a civil war, and now leads a life of petty crime, but always upholding his own values.. think of a Hans Solo for today.. He and his motley crew are sheltering a woman and her brother from the Alliance.  However, the secrets the woman holds turn out to bring the entire crew to face ultimate sacrifices and choices as to what is important to them.Some of the character arcs are surprising, but once over the surprise / shock, they are all fitting.

951539,A1LE0N83C2XKMN,B000BW7QWW,Mystery Maven,"[2, 3]","This film is classic Joss Whedon and will leave you breathless at the end as if you were in on the action. Whedon doesn't disappoint fans with high expectations, but also gives enough background so that newcomers aren't totally lost. I think, however, there's much more depth for viewers of the series or who have seen the reruns on SciFi channel. There just isn't enough time to cover the relationships in a two hour movie. But the series is just that good--if you haven't seen it before the movie, I'll guarantee you will afterwards.One departure Whedon takes from other sci-fi shows is the ship and scenes are much more realistic and believable. Serenity is a cargo ship and looks like one. It's functional and not all shiny and clean like on Star Trek. The colonized towns look more like the old west, except for the hovercraft and six shooters that fire lasers. There's definitely a western feel to things with a little Asian thrown in. Frequently, the crew is given to swear in a Mandarin-sounding language which is a sweet way to keep the ratings and yet be believable. Some of the cities and even the Serenity sport Asian decor and writing.I find it interesting the Whedon is allegedly agnostic because he slips in a lot of religious themes. There's first and foremost Shepard Book, the preacher with the mysterious past, played wonderfully by Ron Glass in the series and who has way too short a role in the film. (Oldsters will remember that Glass played a detective in the comedy Barney Miller.) Inara, a companion, is a Buddhist. And Mr. Universe, a pirate broadcaster, has a Jewish wedding with his robot companion. (I, Robot anyone?) Even The Operative (played chillingly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) has his own twisted creed.Another theme of the movie (without giving anything away) is the harm done when the government mettles. In the series, two genius siblings become passengers. Simon, a doctor, smuggles his sister, River, who has been used as a guinea pig by the universal government known as the Alliance. She is a psychic and they have tried to tap into her brain. This has left her unstable and possibly dangerous even to her friends. Simon gave up his budding career to save her and now the Alliance wants her back so they put The Operative on Serenity's trail.Serenity is a roller coaster in a movie theater--it catapults you along.

951540,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B000BW7QWW,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[4, 6]","I have loved Joss Whedon for over a third of my life. Since the first episode of Buffy I was completely hooked on the guy and his genius and I have not turned back. I had extremely high expectations for his theatrical directorial debut, and I am very happy to say that ""Serenity"" more than exceeded all my expectations.At first I must admit that I was skeptical at certain points. I loved ""Firefly"" and was more than overjoyed when the ""Firefly"" DVDs were released years ago so that I could watch them over and over and over. But I was skeptical as to how successfully Joss could introduce the characters and their ""verse"" to first timers while adding something new and relevant to the story for those of us who have enjoyed the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew for years now. Of course I should never have worried. I have seen this film multiple times with many different people who had never watched a second of ""Firefly"" yet completely fell in love with the story and the characters. There is a feeling of unity that Joss establishes with his casts and characters that no other writer/director/producer can even attempt to establish. Joss's cast and characters have a comaraderie about them that is uniquely Joss and uniquely fun. He did it with Buffy, he did it again with Angel, he did if for a third (and possibly most successful) time with Firefly, and he continues it with his work on Marvel Comics comic book, ""Astonishing X-Men."" There is a familial warmth that is undeniable, and it is part of what makes the film ""Serenity"" so spectacular.This movie is the kind of movie that one can truly watch over and over and over again. Every time I've seen it I have heard new lines that made me laugh outloud that I didn't notice before because I was already laughing so loud at something a character has said. The witty quips and dialogue of this movie are unparalleled in every other movie ever, with the possible exception of ""Army of Darkness."" Whether the humor is from Mal's muscle-man, Jayne, obvious funnyman, Wash, Mal himself, or any of the other brilliant characters, this movie is hilarious. In a very intelligent and surprising way. The humor just adds to the plot which took my breath away with its intricacies and perfection. Honestly, I cannot say enough good about this movie.Whether you are a fan of sci-fi, westerns, comedy, action, romance, or whatever, this movie is for you. It's brilliant. This is the movie George Lucas should have made. It's like early, awesome Han Solo only 8,000,000 times cooler than that could ever be because Joss has something George never had: heart. His heart and his intelligence bleed all over this film, and I truly hope that the DVD sales are astronomical so hopefully, sometime in the near future, Joss can take us back to his brilliant Serenity on yet another amazing tale.Of course, if you buy the full screen version, something amazingly gorgeous will get cut.  The visuals in this epic film are on par with films that cost literally hundreds more millions of dollars to make (ie all three Star Wars Prequels) so I say go all out and get widescreen to take in all the gorgeous beauty that is ""Serenity.""

All of the characters are really strong, there's a perfect balance of the serious with the humorous, and one thing I absolutely love is that the special effects are there to support the story and not put in as a tribute to themselves.  ""Serenity"" is a truly balanced movie; it's a space opera with Western themes; it's a comedy about a bunch of different people all traveling on the same starship; it's worth watching over and over again.

951543,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000BW7QWW,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[7, 7]","I was never a rabid fan of the TV series, but there is no denying it was much more entertaining and clever and than most of what happens on television, with the exception (perhaps) of a few HBO series and especially the other two series by Joss Whedon himself: Buffy and Angel.  It was a shame it didn't last long enough to let the stories and characters ease into the kind of maturity that allowed some of the later episodes of Angel and Buffy to reach a seamless combination of familiarity and innovation.  As far as I'm concerned, they finally reached that level in this film, which ties in nicely with the series by providing backstory that is only sketched in the episodes without significantly overlapping the material of the episodes.  In that way, the film works even if you were never a fan of the series -- though you do probably have to be the type of person that gets a kick out of (at least one of ...)westerns, space movies or kung fu flicks, you don't have to be a Trekkie or Star Wars geek (not that there's anything wrong with either of those!).The pre-credit sequence is probably the most innovative in terms of storytelling -- the film packs several layers of information about the universe we are in and the nature of two central characters into just a few minutes, and it is both enjoyable and intriguing.  After that, while the story itself is clever, it begins to feel a bit more like a conventional episode from the TV series (which is still more inventive and fun than most movies and tv), until the last twenty minutes or so when the story explodes into something much bigger than a TV episode and becomes, well, very obviously a very good movie.

I expected an average sci-fi epic with less than average visuals. What I got was probably my favorite science fiction film in a number of years. What makes this such an enjoyable film is that it doesn't take itself overly seriously. It has the same sort of unbridled enthusiasm for its subject matter that the original STAR WARS trilogy did back in their day. The plot is good, the acting good to great, and the visuals are remarkable for a film with the budget size of this one.The plot revolves around the crew of the cargo/smuggler ship Serenity and their adventures while protecting a renegade girl psychic and her older brother. Fleeing the totalitarian government known as The Alliance who had been experimenting on River, the crew of the Serenity take on a new level of risk, and are forced to decide between continuing to assist River, or turning her over to the authorities. Intermixed with the main plot are encounters with Reevers, space faring cannibals that terrorize human colonies. Eventually it is revealed that the Reevers, River, and the Alliance's interest in River are interrelated. As River is able to remember more and more of her past and the experiments she was subjected to, the truth emerges and sends the crew of the Serenity to the strangely empty colony world of Miranda which holds the key to the Alliance's undoing.The acting is very well done, beginning with Serenity's captain, a loose-cannon, military veteran named Mal Reynolds, immediately likable in the same sort of way as Han Solo. Played by the TV staple Nathan Fillion (LOST, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING ALONG BLOG), he is a very well crafted character who is at times honorable, others ruthless, and always entertaining.River, the psychic girl, is also very well cast. Played by Summer Glau, a relative unknown at the time (now starring in THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES), she is equal parts coolly efficient assassin, teenager haunted by frightening memories, and world-wise cynic. She is believable as all three, and captivating to watch whether wielding ad-hock weaponry ala Jason Bourne, or throwing out cleverly cryptic insults like the pregnant girl from Juno. There is an animal intensity to the way she plays River that is thrilling to watch.The other major rolls are filled admirably with another interesting performance turned in by the film's main antagonist who goes simply by The Operative. He is clever and intelligent, defying stereotypical enforcers from totalitarian regimes. ""This is a good death,"" he tells the man responsible for River's escape as he takes his last few breaths impaled on a sword. ""There is no shame in this."" He is able to convey a sort of moral depth that gives his character a level of gravitas few cinema villains ever achieve.While clich&eacute; is present in the film, it is kept at a minimum through two very interesting methods. The first is the use of Americanized western-style dialogue that is free from the more painful bits of sci-fi jargon. This provides the film with a 'culture' that is distinct as well as entertaining. It's a joy listening to the dialogue, and makes the movie worth watching more than a few times since you pick up on new things you might have missed the first time through. The other thing that helps Serenity stay fresh throughout is the remarkable level of detail in the art direction. The sets in the film are just believable, be they the interior of the ship, the colony worlds where Serenity lands, or the surface of the mysterious world Miranda. There is a grittiness to the ship, the weapons, and even the hand tools that shatters any disbelief.As in just about any film, there are the inevitable plot holes and mistakes. However these are largely irrelevant to the main story which moves along briskly, with the exception of a possibly unnecessary love interest complication for Serenity's captain. While not the most original plot line ever conceived, it is more than adequate to let the best elements of the film shine: interesting, multifaceted characters, terrifically good writing, and beautiful art design.A fantastic sci-fi film well worth owning. 4/5 stars.",4,One of the best sci-fi films in that last 10 years,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,4249,"['watched', 'movie', 'seeing', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'being', 'huge', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'somehow', 'missed', 'expected', 'average', 'sci-fi', 'epic', 'less', 'average', 'visuals', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'probably', 'favorite', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'number', 'years', 'What', 'such', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'overly', 'seriously', 'same', 'sort', 'unbridled', 'enthusiasm', 'subject', 'matter', 'original', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'trilogy', 'did', 'back', 'day', 'plot', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'great', 'visuals', 'are', 'remarkable', 'film', 'budget', 'size', 'one.The', 'plot', 'crew', 'cargo/smuggler', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'adventures', 'protecting', 'renegade', 'girl', 'psychic', 'older', 'brother', 'Fleeing', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'known', 'Alliance', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'experimenting', 'River', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'take', 'new', 'level', 'risk', 'are', 'forced', 'decide', 'continuing', 'assist', 'River', 'turning', 'over', 'authorities', 'Intermixed', 'main', 'plot', 'are', 'encounters', 'Reevers', 'space', 'faring', 'cannibals', 'terrorize', 'human', 'colonies', 'Eventually', 'revealed', 'Reevers', 'River', 'Alliance', 'interest', 'River', 'are', 'interrelated', 'River', 'able', 'remember', 'more', 'more', 'past', 'experiments', 'was', 'subjected', 'truth', 'emerges', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'strangely', 'empty', 'colony', 'world', 'Miranda', 'key', 'Alliance', 'undoing.The', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'beginning', 'Serenity', 'captain', 'loose-cannon', 'military', 'veteran', 'named', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'immediately', 'likable', 'same', 'sort', 'way', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Played', 'TV', 'staple', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'LOST', 'DR.', 'HORRIBLE', 'SING', 'ALONG', 'BLOG', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'character', 'who', 'times', 'honorable', 'others', 'ruthless', 'always', 'entertaining.River', 'psychic', 'girl', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'cast', 'Played', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'relative', 'unknown', 'time', 'now', 'starring', 'THE', 'SARAH', 'CONNOR', 'CHRONICLES', 'equal', 'parts', 'coolly', 'efficient', 'assassin', 'teenager', 'haunted', 'frightening', 'memories', 'world-wise', 'cynic', 'believable', 'three', 'captivating', 'watch', 'wielding', 'ad-hock', 'weaponry', 'ala', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'throwing', 'out', 'cleverly', 'cryptic', 'insults', 'pregnant', 'girl', 'Juno', 'animal', 'intensity', 'way', 'River', 'thrilling', 'watch.The', 'other', 'major', 'rolls', 'are', 'filled', 'admirably', 'interesting', 'performance', 'turned', 'film', 'main', 'antagonist', 'who', 'simply', 'Operative', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'defying', 'stereotypical', 'enforcers', 'totalitarian', 'regimes', 'good', 'death', 'man', 'responsible', 'River', 'escape', 'last', 'few', 'breaths', 'impaled', 'sword', 'shame', 'able', 'convey', 'sort', 'moral', 'depth', 'character', 'level', 'gravitas', 'few', 'cinema', 'villains', 'ever', 'clich', 'eacute', 'present', 'film', 'kept', 'minimum', 'two', 'very', 'interesting', 'methods', 'first', 'use', 'Americanized', 'western-style', 'dialogue', 'free', 'more', 'painful', 'bits', 'sci-fi', 'jargon', 'film', ""'culture"", 'distinct', 'as', 'well', 'entertaining', 'joy', 'listening', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'watching', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'other', 'thing', 'Serenity', 'stay', 'fresh', 'remarkable', 'level', 'detail', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'believable', 'be', 'interior', 'ship', 'colony', 'worlds', 'where', 'Serenity', 'surface', 'mysterious', 'world', 'Miranda', 'grittiness', 'ship', 'weapons', 'even', 'hand', 'shatters', 'disbelief.As', 'just', 'film', 'are', 'inevitable', 'plot', 'holes', 'mistakes', 'However', 'are', 'largely', 'irrelevant', 'main', 'story', 'along', 'briskly', 'exception', 'possibly', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'complication', 'Serenity', 'captain', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'plot', 'line', 'ever', 'conceived', 'more', 'adequate', 'let', 'best', 'elements', 'film', 'shine', 'interesting', 'multifaceted', 'characters', 'terrifically', 'good', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'art', 'design.A', 'fantastic', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'well', 'owning', '4/5', 'stars']",N/A

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator has taken his much beloved, and all too shortly lived, series Firefly and made it into something truly special on the big screen.  Serenity, like Firefly before it, is everything that science fiction should be and then some: loaded with ideas and a sense of wonder and awe.  And because it's from the mind of Joss Whedon, you can expect Serenity to be everything something from Whedon should be: smart, loaded with snappy dialogue, intricately plotted, and full of memorable characters.  Picking up where the series left off, Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the crew of Serenity are soon on the run from the Alliance who are after the mysteriously deranged River (Summer Glau) because of what she knows.  And what she knows can, and will, change everything.  Everyone from the series is back, including Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Morena Baccarin, and the rest; as they all soon find themselves in over their heads.  The only downside of Serenity is that for a briskly paced film that's two full hours long, it's over all too quickly; but it ends with the hope that there's more in store for the crew of Serenity in the future (even though there have been reports from Whedon himself that no sequel or follow-ups have been planned at this time).  This new Collector's Edition DVD doesn't include the boat load of special features that one may think it might, but it offers some substancial material that die hard fans of the series and film will eat up regardless.  All in all, Serenity is an excellent film and one of the finest moments of sci-fi to appear in quite some time, and yes, it's so much better than anything lately to come out of a universe from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",5,"""You can't take the sky from me...""",1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,1797,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'hand', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'creator', 'taken', 'much', 'beloved', 'too', 'shortly', 'lived', 'series', 'Firefly', 'made', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'big', 'screen', 'Serenity', 'Firefly', 'everything', 'science', 'fiction', 'should', 'be', 'then', 'loaded', 'ideas', 'sense', 'wonder', 'awe', 'mind', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'can', 'expect', 'Serenity', 'be', 'everything', 'something', 'Whedon', 'should', 'be', 'smart', 'loaded', 'snappy', 'dialogue', 'intricately', 'plotted', 'full', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Picking', 'up', 'where', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'are', 'soon', 'run', 'Alliance', 'who', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'deranged', 'River', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'what', 'what', 'can', 'will', 'change', 'everything', 'Everyone', 'series', 'back', 'including', 'Gina', 'Torres', 'Alan', 'Tudyk', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'Morena', 'Baccarin', 'rest', 'soon', 'find', 'heads', 'only', 'downside', 'Serenity', 'briskly', 'paced', 'film', 'two', 'full', 'hours', 'long', 'too', 'quickly', 'hope', 'more', 'store', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'future', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'reports', 'Whedon', 'sequel', 'follow-ups', 'have', 'been', 'planned', 'time', 'new', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'include', 'boat', 'load', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'might', 'substancial', 'material', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'film', 'will', 'eat', 'up', 'regardless', 'Serenity', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', 'finest', 'moments', 'sci-fi', 'appear', 'quite', 'time', 'yes', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'anything', 'lately', 'come', 'universe', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'galaxy', 'far', 'far', 'away']",N/A
951547,AK9LN821QYQG9,B000BW7QWW,Neal J. Wertanen,"[10, 13]","""Serenity"" is at once a fitting ending AND a promising beginning.After creator Joss Whedon's beloved cult show (""Firefly"") was cancelled after an all too brief run in 2002, one had to wonder if this was yet another in a long line of GREAT shows that the Fox network didn't give a chance to, or quite understand (they played the episodes out of order because they felt the 2nd episode of the series was faster paced and more appealing) and cancelled far, far too early, while recycled crap remains on the network 7 nights a week.The network had to have realized a mistake had been made once the show came onto DVD and quickly became one of the better selling DVDs in history. However it happened, we can be glad Whedon was allowed his chance to (at the very least) wrap up no less than six dangling plot-lines at the shows cancellation.Fans spent years (or in my case four or five months after I bought the series on DVD after I saw the films first trailer and was blown away) waiting to see how things would turn out for fugitive/lab-rat River and her brother Simon who risked everything, including a successful and prominent life in medicine, to save River from the government who was hurting her.We wanted to know what was up with Inara leaving the crew, and why she and Captain Reynolds couldn't just admit they liked one another and get it on. What's with the Reavers? and how did they get that way? Would Jayne cause more problems and go back on his promise to Mal to remain loyal to him and the crew, or would he find another way to try and turn River and Simon in for cash? Why couldn't Simon return Kaylee's repeated advances?My only fear going into the film was that it would ignore the 14 episode series and play as a stand alone. I was thankfully dead wrong.The movie functions best to its target audience; the fans of ""Firefly"". A newcomer may still enjoy the movie very much, but would in all likely-hood be somewhat lost when the film takes time to wrap up the plot-lines I mentioned earlier. The best example is the small, but quite nice subplot in the movie that deals with Simon and Kaylee. It plays quite humorously and poignantly in and of itself, but has a bigger affect when you've earned that moment in the end when they end up together. In fact, I was somewhat surprised Kaylee ended up being the movie's most entertaining character.The biggest reason to see and enjoy the show before watching the movie is newcomers didn't seem to get why it mattered so much when certain people were killed off in the movie, and basically didn't care (I know this after a few friends and co-workers saw the movie, haven't not seen the series, and expressed as much to me afterward). So, as a result, a lot of the movie's final act is lost on them. I won't divulge which 2 major characters pass on during the movie, but I will say that the first was more or less expected because of the way the film was set up. However, the second death comes as a total shock.In the end, ""Serenity"" is a fantastic sci-fi film with great effects and action. The witty, yet smart dialogue of Whedon is again a trademark of the film like the series. Afterwards I felt like the movie had began a few weeks after the last episode of the show, and had wrapped up all the plotlines nicely. Basically, it was the kick-ass series finale the Fox network never allowed them to have. It also sets up some new dynamics within the crew, and leaves the door open for a promising film franchise.We can only hope, the studio is smarter than the network, and allows a sequel to occur.",5,Great end.

Would it be worth the price?  Would it be perfect if it was imposed and not chosen?

One of those sunday afternoon when nothing is showing in the cinema that you either haven't seen already or you have no interest in seeing. Anyhow...Serenity got rave reviews and as a science fiction writer/publisher and lifetime fan I had to see what everyone was talking about. NOTE: I'll admit that I abhor and detest ALL COMMERCIAL/NON-SCIENCE Soap Opera/Sci-Fi fiction entertainment like Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Stargate and almost every movie/sitcom/garbage that has been ejected from the SciFi channel. I enjoy psychological sci-fi like the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, etc... or hardcore Sci-fi like Space Odysey 2001, Aliens, Dark City, BladeRunner, 2046, I even enjoy comedies like the MST3000 series.But Serenity as a movie blew everything I'd seen before it away.This movie wedges a new genre into the sci-fi space opera type; Call it sci-fi western! It is well written, directed, acted and produced. If there is any gripes from the mindless masses is that the movie did not suffer from the guady overstaged over production of the StarWars sagas that movie goers today seem to suckle on as if poorly scripted battlefield scenes of non-developed characters and a go-nowhere plot is the sweet milk of artistic movie production.Serenity succeeds because it out does every recent Star Wars episode with far far far less.

I am going to go into greater detail and gush my brains out when I write my review of the box set of the TV series, but suffice to say: Every positive/gushing review you are reading here is dead-on. Went and saw the movie Friday night, after allowing myself the privilege of seeing the TV series in its entirety on DVD (I didn't want to watch the movie not knowing its beginnings.) The movie, to borrow a time-worn cliche', was all that and a bag of chips. When I went to look in the newspaper Friday afternoon to see if it was still showing here in the Kansas City area, it was at ONE THEATRE, at a location quite a distance from where I live. Very worth the drive and the $$. I want to go see it again. Will more than likely own both the TV series and the movie on DVD very soon.The humor in the movie is more pronounced than in the TV series, which is a good thing--humor added to plots that are serious, when well done, is always a welcome thing. In watching the ""extras"" included in the TV series DVD, it is mentioned somewhere that they could not have found better actors to play the roles, and anyone with a modicum of intelligence would agree. It was like these 9 wonderful people were born to play these parts...to hear Nathan state categorically that this is ""the best job he's EVER had"" and to hear Ron say that he still gets ""teary-eyed"" at the thought of the series being over is both gratifying and heart-wrenching. Unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool cynic or someone with a heart of stone, you can't help but love these characters and the stories they get plunged into. If this movie was Joss Whedon's way of saying thank you to his hordes of Fireflies, then I guess all we can say is you're welcome, Joss. Let's hope we see a sequel, and that certain unexpected turns of events in the movie are brought to happier conclusions.",5,Glad there's no 12-Step group for this.....,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,1892,"['.because', 'am', 'addicted', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'am', 'going', 'go', 'greater', 'detail', 'gush', 'brains', 'out', 'when', 'write', 'review', 'box', 'set', 'TV', 'series', 'suffice', 'say', 'positive/gushing', 'review', 'are', 'reading', 'here', 'dead-on', 'Went', 'saw', 'movie', 'Friday', 'night', 'allowing', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'TV', 'series', 'entirety', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'beginnings', 'movie', 'borrow', 'time-worn', 'cliche', 'was', 'bag', 'chips', 'When', 'went', 'look', 'newspaper', 'Friday', 'afternoon', 'see', 'was', 'still', 'showing', 'here', 'Kansas', 'City', 'area', 'was', 'ONE', 'THEATRE', 'location', 'quite', 'distance', 'where', 'live', 'Very', 'drive', 'want', 'go', 'see', 'again', 'Will', 'more', 'likely', 'own', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'DVD', 'very', 'soon.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'more', 'pronounced', 'TV', 'series', 'good', 'thing', 'humor', 'added', 'plots', 'are', 'serious', 'when', 'well', 'done', 'always', 'welcome', 'thing', 'watching', 'extras', 'included', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'somewhere', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'anyone', 'modicum', 'intelligence', 'would', 'agree', 'was', '9', 'wonderful', 'people', 'were', 'born', 'play', 'parts', 'hear', 'Nathan', 'state', 'categorically', 'best', 'job', 'EVER', 'had', 'hear', 'Ron', 'say', 'still', 'teary-eyed', 'thought', 'series', 'being', 'over', 'gratifying', 'heart-wrenching', ""'re"", 'dyed-in-the-wool', 'cynic', 'someone', 'heart', 'stone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'characters', 'stories', 'get', 'plunged', 'movie', 'was', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'way', 'saying', 'thank', 'hordes', 'Fireflies', 'then', 'guess', 'can', 'say', ""'re"", 'welcome', 'Joss', 'Let', 'hope', 'see', 'sequel', 'certain', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'events', 'movie', 'are', 'brought', 'happier', 'conclusions']",N/A

Highley ""the_projectron""","[0, 0]","My first encounter with Joss Whedon's amalgam of science fiction and the western genres came when a friend of mine channel surfed into the halfway point of this film and said, ""hey, let's watch this!"" Although he had not seen the film, he was already a fan of the ill-fated television series. I shrugged when I replied, ""Sure, why not?"" When the one character in particular met a particularly swift and unceremonious death my friend murmured, ""agh...now I know why some people didn't like this movie.""As someone who ONLY encountered the movie at that time, I thought the film pretty darn shiny. That said, there were so many storylines that Joss Whedon felt compelled to bring to some sort of resolution that I do wish this would have been approached as a trilogy rather than a one-off epic culmination of the television series. It's a shame the makers ofFirefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] basically got stabbed in the back by FOX, but the deaths of several of the key characters really painted this whole concept into a corner that it did not necessarily belong. If ever I could, I would resurrect this uniquely original concept into full-fledged trilogy that revisitsFirefly - The Complete Seriesin one definitive stroke!Again, I still really like the film and Nathan Fillion's portrayal of the reluctant hero who only wants to be left alone but is never, ever going to be left alone is one of the best of its ilk that I have ever seen. That the asset sought by the antagonist is not gold or silver, but the preservation of a terrible secret is equally compelling. And the very notion that no matter how much technology we invent, we must still tame the demons in each of our souls rings even more true with each subsequent technological advancement. Whedon came up with a damn good premise made even better by some shiny character development. If only there had been someone at FOX who understood the potential goldmine upon which they blindly sat!This is a film worthy of a good look on Blu-ray disc. The divide between fans who prefer the television series over the film is understandable considering the tone of the weekly show was very much space opera while the tone of the film is extremely tragic. It would be a little to odd to like one equally as the other, but I do recommend exploring both. While the video and audio quality of the Blu-ray disc of the film is impeccable, the series itself was filmed intentionally with a grainy look akin to a lot westerns. As such, you'll hit a point of diminishing returns with the Blu-ray of the series when those scenes appear.In the final analysis, I genuinely believe that the film is in every way superior to the short-lived, albeit brilliant, television series, but the film also establishes certain absolutes that I do wish could have been avoided.  If I had my way, I would write a trilogy that reconciles the best of the series into a worthy prequel to this film.  While the deaths of two my favorite members of the crew cast this work in a very tragic light, Whedon still tries to offer us a happy ending of sorts.  I would NOT have done that.  Once you take a walk down the dark side the way this film and something like Stanley Kubrick'sEyes Wide Shutdoes, there is no turning back.  A happy ending after that much tragedy is almost the worst thing you can do.  This is a great film for a lot of reasons, particularly when one considers the hurdles Whedon had to jump through just to make it happen, but after the horrible secret is revealed to all of mankind there are no consequences for that revelation.  Someone should have addressed that early on in the creative process, but it's a little late now.  Still, this is a very strong four star effort and one that I do recommend as much as the television series so long as all are aware of the tragic nature of this story.",4,"Given the Source Material, This Should Have Been a Trilogy",1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,3839,"['first', 'encounter', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'amalgam', 'science', 'fiction', 'western', 'genres', 'came', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'channel', 'surfed', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'said', 'hey', 'let', 'watch', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'fan', 'ill-fated', 'television', 'series', 'shrugged', 'when', 'replied', 'Sure', 'why', 'not', 'When', 'one', 'character', 'particular', 'met', 'particularly', 'swift', 'unceremonious', 'death', 'friend', 'murmured', 'agh', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'ONLY', 'encountered', 'movie', 'time', 'thought', 'film', 'pretty', 'darn', 'shiny', 'said', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'storylines', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'felt', 'compelled', 'bring', 'sort', 'resolution', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'approached', 'trilogy', 'rather', 'one-off', 'epic', 'culmination', 'television', 'series', 'shame', 'makers', 'ofFirefly', 'Complete', 'Series', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'basically', 'got', 'stabbed', 'back', 'FOX', 'deaths', 'several', 'key', 'characters', 'really', 'painted', 'whole', 'concept', 'corner', 'did', 'not', 'necessarily', 'belong', 'ever', 'could', 'would', 'resurrect', 'uniquely', 'original', 'concept', 'full-fledged', 'trilogy', 'Complete', 'Seriesin', 'one', 'definitive', 'stroke', 'Again', 'still', 'really', 'film', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'portrayal', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'who', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'never', 'ever', 'going', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'one', 'best', 'ilk', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'asset', 'sought', 'antagonist', 'not', 'gold', 'silver', 'preservation', 'terrible', 'secret', 'equally', 'compelling', 'very', 'notion', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'technology', 'invent', 'must', 'still', 'tame', 'demons', 'souls', 'rings', 'even', 'more', 'true', 'subsequent', 'technological', 'advancement', 'came', 'up', 'damn', 'good', 'premise', 'made', 'even', 'better', 'shiny', 'character', 'development', 'only', 'had', 'been', 'someone', 'FOX', 'who', 'understood', 'potential', 'goldmine', 'blindly', 'sat', 'film', 'worthy', 'good', 'look', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'divide', 'fans', 'who', 'prefer', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'understandable', 'considering', 'tone', 'weekly', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'space', 'opera', 'tone', 'film', 'extremely', 'tragic', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'odd', 'like', 'one', 'equally', 'other', 'do', 'recommend', 'exploring', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'film', 'impeccable', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'intentionally', 'grainy', 'look', 'akin', 'lot', 'such', ""'ll"", 'hit', 'point', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'Blu-ray', 'series', 'when', 'scenes', 'appear.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'genuinely', 'believe', 'film', 'way', 'superior', 'short-lived', 'albeit', 'brilliant', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'also', 'certain', 'absolutes', 'do', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'had', 'way', 'would', 'write', 'trilogy', 'best', 'series', 'worthy', 'prequel', 'film', 'deaths', 'two', 'favorite', 'members', 'crew', 'cast', 'work', 'very', 'tragic', 'light', 'Whedon', 'still', 'offer', 'happy', 'ending', 'sorts', 'would', 'NOT', 'have', 'done', 'Once', 'take', 'walk', 'dark', 'side', 'way', 'film', 'something', 'Stanley', ""Kubrick'sEyes"", 'Wide', 'Shutdoes', 'turning', 'back', 'happy', 'ending', 'much', 'tragedy', 'almost', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'great', 'film', 'lot', 'reasons', 'particularly', 'when', 'one', 'hurdles', 'Whedon', 'had', 'jump', 'through', 'just', 'make', 'happen', 'horrible', 'secret', 'revealed', 'mankind', 'are', 'consequences', 'revelation', 'Someone', 'should', 'have', 'addressed', 'early', 'creative', 'process', 'little', 'late', 'now', 'Still', 'very', 'strong', 'four', 'star', 'effort', 'one', 'do', 'recommend', 'as', 'much', 'television', 'series', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'aware', 'tragic', 'nature', 'story']",N/A

They should have passed and let it be picked up by another network, perhaps even the Sci-Fi (now SyFy) Channel, which ended up doing such a great job with ""Battlestar Galactica"".  Not content to be shoved aside by clueless network executives, the ""Firefly"" fans, nicknamed 'Browncoats' (after the apparel the rebellion wore in storyline pre-dating the tv series), fought long and hard, and succeeded in getting a full motion picture released, with all the main actors coming back to reprise their beloved characters.""Serenity"" takes place several months after the chronological conclusion of the television show.  Mal and his crew are still scrambling for any kind of smuggling jobs they can get to pay the bills, with work having become much more difficult since River Tam joined the crew, due to the Alliance fearing what she knows and putting pressure of Mal to turn her over.A smuggling job gets the crew dangerously close to the Reavers, a bastardized version of once-humans, who are this 'verse's version of zombies.  The events that follow put the crew (and River) back on the radar of the Alliance who send their vicious and merciless 'operative' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) on a mission to hunt down and capture River, while disposing of anyone who gets in his way.  Along the way, the secrets that Alliance has long struggled to keep hidden become known to Mal and his crew.  It is then a race against time (and the 'operative') to get that information out to the public.""Serenity"" shows what can be done with this this universe when given the proper production budget and resources.  Joss Whedon created a film that certainly ran neck and neck with other sci-fi films (like ""Revenge of the Sith""), in terms of action and intensity.It's a shame that it still did not get a big box-office return because that essentially negated a chance at any big-screen sequels.

One thing that made the series work was the well-rounded, interesting characters.Unlike some shows with huge overarching plot arcs, EVERY episode had a real plot, and not the Lost-style meandering where nothing actually happens.  But Whedon WAS building toward a conclusion of sorts, and his overall plans were truncated when the series was cancelled so quickly that they didn't even have funding to write a &#34;wrap-up&#34; episode.  Fans demanded more, and a movie got produced.  As a Firefly fan, I enjoyed seeing a certain percentage of the &#34;plot arcs&#34; come to a satisfactory conclusion.  You see Malcom, who had &#34;lost his religion&#34; before the second scene of Episode 1 regaining a sense of purpose that overrides all other concerns.  At least part of the conspiracy that has unhinged River is exposed.  And the other characters &#34;rise to the occassion,&#34; even the mercenary Jayne, who hesitates to admit that they're all in over their heads.Still, it's far more than JUST a wrap-up two-hour episode of the series.

951585,A2HH25XER1C280,B000BW7QWW,P. Gagliardi,"[6, 7]","Every philosophy student should watch this movie!!  The characters can be seen as dialectic interlocutors representing different shades of morality.  This film is definitely among the more unique in our time.  It is as exciting as Indiana Jones, but is layered with deep philosophical complexities and moral ambiguities that many modern art house films don't even get quite right.As most people know, this film grew out of a short-lived series called Firefly, which, admittedly, I didn't know about before this film but have since watched in its entirety.  It is set in the future, in a post-war Reconstruction-esque Era where several worlds are run by the Alliance, a Sino-American, culturally fused mega-government that is, after all, just trying to make a better world.  The numerous system of worlds governed by the Alliance have forced them to spread their presence thin, leaving wiggle room for fringe settlers to live by their own laws (or lack thereof), similar to the American frontier era.Malcolm Reynolds is captain of the Serenity, a firefly class space vessel that is as iconic as the Millennium Falcon or the Black Pearl.  He fought for the browncoats, a resistance group who fought against the Alliance in the Unification War.  I'd coin the term ""vicarious schizophrenic"" just for Mal.  He's that complicated a character!  For the crew with which Mal has surrounded himself, I would make the argument, are a complex of Mal's many manifested personalities:Zoe - the Spartan who never diverts from her sense of purpose.Wash - the light-hearted adventurous pirate, filled with wanderlust.Kaylee - the suppressed inner child, innocent but adaptable and capable.Jayne - the churlish brigand, always calculating his advantages in any situation.Simon Tam - a man of moral purpose with a deep hatred for the Alliance, who abandoned a potentially comfortable life to resist the Alliance, who victimized his sister.River Tam - an otherwise gifted individual, twisted into something dark by the Alliance.Shepherd Book - warrior/preacher searching for cosmic purpose, who explores a realm where Mal himself won't venture, but who comes to teach Mal that belief doesn't necessarily have to involve something spiritual.Inara - a high class courtesan and Mal's soul mate, whom he petulantly alienates (implying Mal's self-hatred).The dialogue in this movie rivals some of the best I've ever seen on film.  It delves so deeply into the fabric of humanity and all of its moral dilemmas.  Here are a few examples (disclaimers: I did my best to be exact.  I've only seen this movie three times, so please forgive any inaccuracies):(my personal favorite!)Mal: Half of writing history is hiding the truth.(while experiencing a rough landing)Mal: Just get us on the ground!Wash: That part will happen pretty definitely!(before the payroll robbery)Mal: I don't plan on any shooting taking place on this job.Jayne: Yeah, but what you plan and what takes place ain't exactly been similar.(Simon protesting River's involvement in the payroll robbery)Simon: Do you understand what I've gone through to protect River from the Alliance?Mal: I do.  It's a fact we here have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves.Simon: Are you threatening me?Mal: I look out for me and mine. That don't include you unless I conjure it does.  Now you stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw.  That tickles me a bit.  But it also means I have to step twice as fast to avoid them.  And that means turning down plenty of jobs.  Even honest ones.  Come a day there won't be room for naughty men like us to slip about at all.  This job goes south, there well may not be another.  So here is us, on the raggedy edge.  Don't push me, and I won't push you.(during the payroll robbery)Mal: I see a head rise, violence is going to ensue. Probably guessed we mean to be thieving here, but what we're after here is not yours. So, let's have no undue fuss.(after rescuing Inara from the Operative)Inara: This isn't a war, Mal.  You came to that training house looking for a fight.Mal: I came looking for you.Inara: I just want to know who I'm dealing with.  I've seen too many versions of you to be sure.Mal: I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.(after realizing the Alliance is hunting River Tam)Shepherd: You have a plan?Mal: What, hiding ain't a plan?(Later in that conversation)Mal: I could've left her there.  I had an out.  Hell, I had every reason in the `verse to haul anchor.Shepherd: it's not your way, Mal.Mal: I have a way?  Is that better than having a plan?(before the story's climax)Mal: You all got on this boat for different reasons, but you all come to the same place.  So now I'm asking more of you than I have before.  Sure as I know anything, I know this.  They will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.  A year from now.  Maybe ten.  They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people better.  And I do not hold to that.  So no more running.  I aim to misbehave.There are many, many more that I have omitted.  This story could be used as a study on human nature and a makeshift morality achieved through dialectic.  There is nobody here that is essentially good or essentially bad.  Instead evil is represented by the Alliance, which is really no more than a metaphor for how badly a seemingly benevolent ideology can be twisted.  A core belief held by the Alliance is that, as Mal stated, they can make people better, the opposing viewpoint being that humanity should be free from such intervention, no matter how bad it might get.  We have been seeing a similar struggle play out globally since the Cold War in the two forms of state governance that have dominated the world since then, and in our attempts to spread the ideals therein by force when deemed necessary.

It added an immeasurable degree of emotional depth to the story, and when when it was over I could finally see what all the fuss was about.Taken together, the series and film work nicely together to create what is perhaps the most compelling space opera in recent memory.

The final act of the movie is pure exhiliration.  Intense.  The underlying themes resonate.  Smart dialogue permeates. Conflicts abound.  There is a darkness and an adultness here.  Nary a cliche in sight.And fear not anyone who isn't familiar with the series.  Serenity wraps up the basics in the first two minutes of the film.  From there on in, it's prime Whedon.

Riffing off of the disastrous TV show ""Firefly"", Joss Whedon and the most unusual and persistent Cult in SciFi history ('the Browncoats') have kept the flame lit with superlative results: ""Serenity"". When Fox refused to let the TV show run it's episodes in sequence and terminated the show early in season one ""with extreme prejudice"", Joss stubbornly kept writing and kept the ensemble cast on call. The result is this beautiful piece of a SciFi movie that doesn't have one alien and no major star anywhere in it's universe.Ron ""Barney Miller"" Glass, Adam Baldwin, and David ""Numbers"" Krumholtz are the big names in this movie and they get less screen time than the others. As far as aliens are concerned, trust me, the Reavers, a carryover of really depraved nasty human guys from the TV show that strike fear in the hearts of anyone who hear their name, are enough evil badness for any Sci Fi Franchise. The Borg would flee from these guys! LOL. But Captain Mal and crew are also always fearful of the Alliance, the 'so-called' civilized central government. Packed with action, loaded with suspense, and with enough new characters to satisfy those of us who watched the TV show and bought the complete ""FireFly"" DVD set, this movie is a winner on many levels: originality, storyline, acting, cinematography, sound effects, and music. Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Strait, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass, Morena Baccarin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor scorch the screen as the principles in this 'cat and mouse' game with the surprise ending. Five HUGE Stars!!(Note: My original thought after the first weekend was that the FOX TV executives were laughing their heads off at the meek $15M boxoffice debut of ""Serenity"",  but Joss had already gotten over on them. They gave him all rights to the show and the ""Firefly"" DVD release soared to 500,000 sales. The movie kept going, thanks to the Browncoats and the new fans, until it 'broke even' at $39M. Joss then released the DVD of ""Serenity"" in time for Christmas sales, which will probably yield another 500,000 sales at least. Then there is the eventual release to HBO/Starz/etc, Network TV, and finally to TNT/ Sci Fi channel who will run it ""forever"". I can hear Joss modestly chuckling all the way out here in Texas.

Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) created an amazing cinematic vision with Serenity.  Probably one of the most endearing things about the Firefly/Serenity story is that it is a science fiction story that does not rely on the typical sci-fi gimmicks.  The main emphasis of the story is on the relationship of the characters and not alien races, technological gadgets, or flashy special effects.The story follows Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) on a quest of his convictions.  Meanwhile his crew consists of a wonderfully talented and colorful group of actors and characters.  Among these is River Tam (Summer Glau), a refugee of the Big Brother-ish Alliance.  Due to various experiments by the Alliance, River is left rather mentally unstable and is trying to sort out the origins of her cryptic and confusing visions and voices while trying to keep her fellow crew safe from her psychosis.  In the meantime, an Alliance Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) seeks to capture River dead or alive.Watching the television series beforehand is not vital to understanding the story, but it will give the viewer added insight, understanding, and appreciation for several details of the movie.  The very human characters and actors create an intense and amazing chemistry, and the energy is definitely bouncing between them.  My only complaint about the movie is that due to its time restrictions, and a full exploration of the different characters is not afforded.  Having said that, my only complaint of the DVD is that a cast commentary as a bonus feature would have been absolutely wonderful, especially considering the chemistry between actors.

Is it as good as the TV show?Trick question. TV allows for the episodic evolution of characters, and when you have nine so expertly sketched and acted as the cast of Firefly, that space is really key to the series. In a movie, you have 2 hrs -- give or more usually take -- which means hyper-compression, and a necessity to focus on only a very few arcs. But it also allows for some incredibly big thrills, chills, and explosions along the way.River and Mal are given center stage, along with the Reavers story, and creative mastermind Joss Whedon uses his trademark brilliant dialog, brutalizing emotional content, and jaw-dropping set pieces to full effect, every bit as funny, terrifying, and surprising as I've come to (happily) expect.The only caveat I would give is that people unfamiliar with the Firefly TV show should watch it. They don't have to do it first, but it will certainly magnify the weight of the movie if they do so at some point. Whether Serenity introduces them to Firefly or vice versa, its definitely a journey worth taking and characters worth experiencing.",5,Serene Excellence,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1206,"['was', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'axe-murdered', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'very', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'release', 'DVD', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'show', 'Trick', 'question', 'TV', 'episodic', 'evolution', 'characters', 'when', 'have', 'nine', 'so', 'expertly', 'sketched', 'acted', 'cast', 'Firefly', 'space', 'really', 'key', 'series', 'movie', 'have', '2', 'hrs', 'give', 'more', 'usually', 'take', 'hyper-compression', 'necessity', 'focus', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'arcs', 'also', 'incredibly', 'big', 'thrills', 'chills', 'explosions', 'way.River', 'Mal', 'are', 'given', 'center', 'stage', 'Reavers', 'story', 'creative', 'mastermind', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'trademark', 'brilliant', 'dialog', 'brutalizing', 'emotional', 'content', 'jaw-dropping', 'set', 'pieces', 'full', 'effect', 'bit', 'funny', 'terrifying', 'surprising', ""'ve"", 'come', 'happily', 'only', 'caveat', 'would', 'give', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'show', 'should', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'first', 'will', 'certainly', 'magnify', 'weight', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'point', 'Whether', 'Serenity', 'Firefly', 'vice', 'versa', 'definitely', 'journey', 'worth', 'taking', 'characters', 'worth', 'experiencing']",N/A

951618,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B000BW7QWW,Rex Macaroe,"[6, 8]","Serenity is the sci fi epic based on the show Firefly, a show which (in the words of its director) was ""immediately hailed as one of the most cancelled shows of the year."" But in its short run, it gained an incredibly strong cult following, and pressure from the show's fans and creators led to the creation of the film. In Joss Wheton's introduction to the film, he gives the fans equal credit with the film's creation, ""so if it sucks, it's your fault."" It didn't.Serenity is every sci fi fan's dream. Its special effects aren't really that special, but they're handled well enough that we believe them. Moreover, they're shown with style. Our first look at the ship Serenity isn't accompanied by a great ochestral score or the whir of a theremin, but by a banjo/violin duet which sings gently as the camera whooshes around the hull. Once inside, the captain calmly announces that the ship ""may experience some slight turbulence, then explode."" Earlier this year I praised Revenge of the Sith for its opening shot being a single long take, but Serenity does it one better with its Russian-Ark-esque steadicam shot of the crew planning a robbery after crash-landing.This all happens shortly after one of the most brilliant opening sequences I've ever seen. We're given a little background on how Earth colonized another solar system. As it turns out, it's a woman teaching a history class. As that turns out, the history class is the dream of a brainwash victim before her daring escape. As it turns out, the footage her daring escape was from a security feed being reviewed by the guy sent to catch her. It has more or less the same effect of someone dreaming about someone dreaming about someone dreaming and so on. I wondered if the whole film would continue in that sense. It didn't but I'm not complaining.Serenity might be a sci fi film, but it felt to me more like a western. That's not anything particularly original (Cowboy Bebop and Star Wars are notorious for drawing influence from western style), but Serenity almost seems doesn't know it's referencing the style. It never exploits it more than necessary. Come to think of it, there are also some samurai references, but likewise, the film only employs that style to drive its already intriguing story.I'm not sure it will work for everyone, but if you've ever watched a film on the Sci Fi Channel at one in the morning, or if you've ever attended Chillercon or similar conventions, or if you just like sci fi in general, Serenity is an experience that you will likely enjoy.",4,The ultimate sci-fi western samurai action comedy,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2539,"['Serenity', 'sci', 'fi', 'epic', 'based', 'show', 'Firefly', 'show', 'words', 'director', 'was', 'immediately', 'hailed', 'one', 'most', 'cancelled', 'shows', 'year', 'short', 'run', 'gained', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'cult', 'following', 'pressure', 'show', 'fans', 'creators', 'led', 'creation', 'film', 'Joss', 'Wheton', 'introduction', 'film', 'fans', 'equal', 'credit', 'film', 'creation', 'so', 'fault', ""didn't.Serenity"", 'sci', 'fan', 'dream', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'special', ""'re"", 'handled', 'well', 'enough', 'believe', 'Moreover', ""'re"", 'shown', 'style', 'first', 'look', 'ship', 'Serenity', ""n't"", 'accompanied', 'great', 'ochestral', 'score', 'whir', 'theremin', 'banjo/violin', 'duet', 'gently', 'camera', 'hull', 'Once', 'inside', 'captain', 'calmly', 'announces', 'ship', 'may', 'experience', 'slight', 'turbulence', 'then', 'explode', 'Earlier', 'year', 'praised', 'Revenge', 'Sith', 'opening', 'shot', 'being', 'single', 'long', 'take', 'Serenity', 'one', 'better', 'Russian-Ark-esque', 'steadicam', 'shot', 'crew', 'planning', 'robbery', 'crash-landing.This', 'shortly', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'opening', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'re"", 'given', 'little', 'background', 'how', 'Earth', 'colonized', 'solar', 'system', 'out', 'woman', 'teaching', 'history', 'class', 'out', 'history', 'class', 'dream', 'brainwash', 'victim', 'daring', 'escape', 'out', 'footage', 'daring', 'escape', 'was', 'security', 'feed', 'being', 'reviewed', 'guy', 'sent', 'catch', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'effect', 'someone', 'dreaming', 'someone', 'dreaming', 'someone', 'dreaming', 'so', 'wondered', 'whole', 'film', 'would', 'continue', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining.Serenity', 'might', 'be', 'sci', 'fi', 'film', 'felt', 'more', 'western', 'not', 'anything', 'particularly', 'original', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Star', 'Wars', 'are', 'notorious', 'drawing', 'influence', 'western', 'style', 'Serenity', 'almost', ""n't"", 'know', 'referencing', 'style', 'never', 'more', 'necessary', 'Come', 'think', 'are', 'also', 'samurai', 'references', 'likewise', 'film', 'only', 'style', 'drive', 'already', 'intriguing', 'story.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'work', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'film', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'one', 'morning', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'attended', 'Chillercon', 'similar', 'conventions', 'just', 'sci', 'fi', 'general', 'Serenity', 'experience', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy']",N/A

Based upon the short-lived TV series Firefly, the film is a science fiction actioner...fast-paced, with twists, and with a sense of humour.The cast of the TV show re-united for the film. It's a likeable, solid cast--all no-name character actors, which emphasizes the ensemble feel.While the film spends a few minutes introducing the ""Firefly universe"" at the start, for the most part the characters are introduced on the fly. The setting: some 500 years from now, Earth has been abandoned, with humanity setting out into the universe to re-settle, and a military conflict has recently concluded with the outcome of uniting all the settled worlds under a rather intrusive central government. The intro allows folks not familiar with the series to come up to speed pretty quickly.As for the story, it would appear to be the intended end of the series' first season. For those not in the know, the ""Serenity"" is the ship populated by most of the main characters, who are a band of smugglers and thieves who descended into this lifestyle following being on the losing side in the aforementioned military conflict, with a few stragglers (read: fugitives) picked up along the way. One of these fugitives is a character by the name of River, a psychic who has learned some nasty truths about the central government's actions in the past few years, and the government would rather she were dead, than walking about with those secrets. It is the discovery and unfurling of those secrets that is at the heart of the plot.It's an entertaining story. The characters, despite being on the bad side of the law, are flawed but good at heart, and they care for each other like family.All in all, it makes for an enjoyable film.It is a film with violence, and death, but older kids should be able to handle this quite well.",4,a shiny film,1129420800,"10 16, 2005",2005,1853,"['saw', 'film', 'Serenity', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Based', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'actioner', 'fast-paced', 'twists', 'sense', 'humour.The', 'cast', 'TV', 'show', 're-united', 'film', 'likeable', 'solid', 'cast', 'no-name', 'character', 'actors', 'ensemble', 'feel.While', 'film', 'few', 'minutes', 'introducing', 'Firefly', 'universe', 'start', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'fly', 'setting', '500', 'years', 'now', 'Earth', 'been', 'abandoned', 'humanity', 'setting', 'out', 'universe', 're-settle', 'military', 'conflict', 'recently', 'concluded', 'outcome', 'uniting', 'settled', 'worlds', 'rather', 'intrusive', 'central', 'government', 'intro', 'folks', 'not', 'familiar', 'series', 'come', 'up', 'speed', 'pretty', 'quickly.As', 'story', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'intended', 'end', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'know', 'Serenity', 'ship', 'populated', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'band', 'smugglers', 'thieves', 'who', 'descended', 'lifestyle', 'following', 'being', 'losing', 'side', 'aforementioned', 'military', 'conflict', 'few', 'stragglers', 'read', 'fugitives', 'picked', 'up', 'way', 'One', 'fugitives', 'character', 'name', 'River', 'psychic', 'who', 'learned', 'nasty', 'truths', 'central', 'government', 'actions', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'government', 'would', 'rather', 'were', 'dead', 'walking', 'secrets', 'discovery', 'unfurling', 'secrets', 'heart', 'plot.It', 'entertaining', 'story', 'characters', 'being', 'bad', 'side', 'law', 'are', 'flawed', 'good', 'heart', 'care', 'other', 'family.All', 'enjoyable', 'film.It', 'film', 'violence', 'death', 'older', 'kids', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'quite', 'well']",N/A

Serenity does in about two hours what the series should have/would have done over the life of the show had it been allowed to continue. In a way this is a bad thing for fans of the show because had the series went on the events of the movie would have played out over a much longer time building the tension further and giving the viewers more insight to the characters. Fortunatly, there came the movie to tie up the loose ends as to all the why's that fans did not know.Serenity delivers on all fronts. It gives the viewer action and adventure and allows the charactors to give out a little revenge of their own on the 'evil' forces out there looking to stop them. All the original charactors are back, though not all have as much time as they would have during the series. Even though the loose ends are tied up (at least with River) the ending leaves open the possiblity of another follow up movie. Best case scenario for fans of Firefly would be a new movie and an even better case scenario would be a series of TV movies on a cable channel.If you have never seen the series Firefly, rent or buy it on DVD to catch up before watching Serentiy (though the opening scenes do bring the viewer up to partial speed as to why the crew does what it does.Either way, Serenity is a good piece of old fashioned Sci-Fi action.",4,Reviewing the movie not the DVD,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,1463,"['Serenity', 'up', 'six', 'months', 'cancellation', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'see', 'what', 'become', 'crew', 'spaceship', 'Serenity', 'Serenity', 'about', 'two', 'hours', 'what', 'series', 'should', 'have/would', 'have', 'done', 'life', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'continue', 'way', 'bad', 'thing', 'fans', 'show', 'had', 'series', 'went', 'events', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'out', 'much', 'longer', 'time', 'building', 'tension', 'further', 'giving', 'viewers', 'more', 'insight', 'characters', 'Fortunatly', 'came', 'movie', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'why', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'know.Serenity', 'delivers', 'fronts', 'viewer', 'action', 'adventure', 'charactors', 'give', 'out', 'little', 'revenge', 'own', ""'evil"", 'forces', 'there', 'looking', 'stop', 'original', 'charactors', 'are', 'back', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'series', 'Even', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'least', 'River', 'ending', 'leaves', 'open', 'possiblity', 'follow', 'up', 'movie', 'Best', 'case', 'scenario', 'fans', 'Firefly', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'case', 'scenario', 'would', 'be', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'cable', 'channel.If', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'Firefly', 'rent', 'buy', 'DVD', 'catch', 'up', 'watching', 'Serentiy', 'opening', 'scenes', 'do', 'bring', 'viewer', 'partial', 'speed', 'why', 'crew', 'what', 'way', 'Serenity', 'good', 'piece', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Sci-Fi', 'action']",N/A

951644,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000BW7QWW,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","Serenity(released Aug/05)is a quite decent Sci-Fi flick that is descended from the TV series Firefly.I have never seen Firefly the TV series,but am aware of the serie's premature cancellation and the following it has developed.As a Star Trek original series fan I know all about such things.So this review is really kind of reverse engineering in a literary sense and a look at this film in situ.The movie begins aboard the spaceship Serenity captained by the less than loquacious Capt.Reynolds(Nathan Fillion).He was on the losing side of the Unification War against the Alliance(similarities abound in likening him to a soldier from the South during the Civil War)and during a maintenance stop at a space station the captain takes aboard two strangers,a brother and sister.The sister(River Tam) has obvious strong mental abilities and her brother is the only one that can keep her in check.She periodically refers to ""Miranda"" but no one including herself can understand what it means. They risk being tossed off the ship many times but the captain sees past the risk.However,not only does the government have a special agent following Tam,the Alliance is sending out special triggering signals to set her off,whenever possible.The captain contacts a friend called Mr Universe who discovers that these ""triggers""are for a special purpose.They also eventually learn that Miranda is an uninhabited planet that was devastated,supposedly,due to a terraforming accident years before.They decide to head for Miranda and  along the way they stop in at a familiar outpost and safe haven only to find all have been slaughtered,thanks to an Alliance agent who wants Tam back.After a running battle they escape the planet and head for their ultimate destination.However the way is blocked by Reavers,a savage half human race whose thirst for blood is only surpassed by their thirst for killing.Disguising themselves they get their ship past the blockade.On Miranda there is no one there alive,it is just full of corpses.They also discover what really happened on Miranda was not a simple terraforming accident.There was an agent put into the chemical used,to suppress aggression which killed most of the populace while turning the rest into Reavers.This disturbing information is sent to Mr Universe who is killed before he can transmit it broad band throughout the Alliance territories.Reynolds and crew head back to see Mr Universe but are followed by the Reavers.They discover a dead Mr Universe and have to hold off the Reavers until they can transmit a back up copy.Some of Reynolds crew dies but the attacking Reavers are repelled and the message is sent out.The Alliance operative after Tam finally realizes the extent of the Alliances crimes and backs off the hunt,but it doesn't mean more agents won't follow him and Tam,who now becomes one of Reynolds crew.It is an exciting plot throughout and holds ones interest all the way.I was pleasantly surprised to see some fine actors like Gina Torres,who goes by Gin Torres in the credits,better known for her roles in Hercules and Cleopatra 2020 among others,Adam Baldwin who I recall from X Files and old Ron Glass from Barney Miller.The entire cast gels beautifully and the glue is Fillion himself who does a wonderful job as the persnickety captain of the Serenity,who likes to run his ship HIS way.As I said this review is coming from someone who has never seen the show,so if I am suitably impressed by the movie and its world and what its creator Joss Whedon is presenting,then I think that is really saying something.It stands alone as just plain good Science Fiction.Technically speaking this DVD comes in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,is clear and crisp,and includes extras like a Whedon intro,commentary,a featurette on the Firefly phenom and 20 minutes of extra deleted scenes and outtakes.All in all Serenity is a wonderful stand alone film.For the fans of Firefly it's just a natural to get,but anyone interested in good Sci-Fi should be picking this up too.If you're like me it will probably lead you to pursue the short lived TV series to see just what the fuss is all about and maybe become a ""brown shirt"" along the way.Hmmm, a brown shirt Trekker...it could work!Highly recommended.",4,4-4 1/2 stars-Nice Sci Fi flick!,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,4238,"['Serenity', 'released', 'Aug/05',

951648,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000BW7QWW,Robert Moore,"[21, 22]","WARNING:  Multiple spoilers!I first discovered the world of FIREFLY upon the release of the DVD set and had been anxiously awaiting the release of the feature film since I first learned two years ago that it was going to be made, even suffering this past spring when they moved the release date from April to September.  I am ecstatic to report that it was worth the wait and I can't imagine even the most tepid fan of the series being at all disappointed with the filmAt the end of the series, which was cancelled without the initial story arcs being resolved, and which in most probability show up in the feature film, I was left with three main questions:  1) what would have happened with Mal and Inara, 2) just precisely what was the deal with River, and 3) what was the secret of Shepherd Book's background.  The film only deals with the second of the three questions in full and merely hints at the first.  As the series ended, Inara, after she and Mal had pretty much confessed that they had strong feelings for one another, indicated that she was going to leave Serenity.  The movie starts back up with her gone, but not back to the life of a companion, but to what Mal would call the Whore Academy, presumably as an instructress.  In watching the show, most of the romantic interest of the series focused on whether the two would hook up, and the film ends with Inara back on Serenity, obviously loathe to leave, though with her and Mal's status not at all defined.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any answers will ever be forthcoming about Book for reasons that are made obvious to anyone seeing the movie.The structure for FIREFLY was given, however, not by romance, but by the question of precisely who River Tam was, what the Alliance had done to her, and why they were so intent on recapturing her.  At the end of the series we knew only a little about her, that she possessed some kind of psychic ability, that she was physically agile, that she was a genius, and that she had been shattered by her experiences.  We had gotten glimpses of what she was capable of, such as memorably shooting three soldiers at a distance with a handgun with her eyes closed, or dispatching of a bounty hunter who had overcome all the other crew members in a way that suggested she found it a mildly diverting game.  Here we get the complete version, seeing everything she is capable of, going into a bar and battering everyone in it in a few seconds, including Jayne, who proved to be no match for the tiny girl.  But it leaves Mal and the others with the question of whether she was only a weapon or also a human being.  Summer Glau, whose first acting job came on ANGEL when Joss Whedon needed a professional ballerina for an episode, does a good job as River.  The role is more about movement and posture than anything and choosing a dancer for the part was a great decision.  Her ability to move is key to her success in the role and is crucial to her fight scenes being so believable.The film is much, much darker than the series, darker even than the way Mal was portrayed in the series premiere (not as broadcast but as it appears on the DVD set).  Jayne says before they hold up a bank, ""Let's go be bad guys,"" and in a way they do.  Of course, by the end of the film Mal's suppressed idealism comes back and the crew ends doing something rather heroic in the name of the truth.  The movie is also dark because of all the reavers.  Not only there lots of reavers, we learn the secret of their origin and how this is entangled with precisely why the Alliance is so desperate to find River.As fans of Joss Whedon know, he loves a good body count (I once counted a total of seventeen significant deaths on BUFFY and ANGEL) and SERENITY is not exception.  Not all the crew survives and indeed at one point it wasn't obvious that any would.All in all, this is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time.  I honestly can compare the fun to other experiences such as seeing STAR WARS for the first time or THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The plot was rich and fun and the action sequences were plentiful and delightful.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was absolutely splendid as The Agent, the man without a name or security number who sought the capture of River in order to create, as he imagines it, a better world.  Whedon loves to play with viewer's expectations in his various projects, and the way he handles The Agent is no exception.  The sets were marvelous throughout and frankly I liked the way the film made outer space look much better than George Lucas did in THE PHANTOM MENACE.  In the latter special effects were employed with something approaching baroque excess while in SERENITY they are used only so far as they are necessary to tell the story.  Also, the film was filled with the marvelous one-liners that seem to permeate the script.So what's next?  A renewal of the TV series is banned because of the 12-year TV ban that was part of the deal they struck with Universal in getting the film made.  The word is that the studio hoped to make a trilogy of films depending on how well the film does at the box office.  The first weekend the film has done well though not spectacularly.  Luckily, Whedon brought the film in under budget and under time, two considerations that are of major significance.  My own guess is that the film is going to do well enough for Universal to pick up the option for another film.  Just have DVD sales for the series has been astonishingly high, so I would expect the DVD sales to be superb.  With Whedon's productions far more popular in Europe and the UK than in the US, the film should do exceptionally well on the international box office.  I expect that in the end it will turn enough of a profit to demand a second film.  Besides, we need to see how things turn out between Mal and Inara.",5,Everything you want to know about River and Reavers,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,5851,"['WARNING', 'Multiple', 'spoilers',

I fell in love with these characters and the universe they inhabit, and watching each episode seeing how awesome the show was made me even more upset that Fox had treated the show and Joss Whedon so terribly, and it also made me more than happy as I eagerly anticipated the release of 'Serenity', in the hopes that the story would continue as a franchise of films much better than the Star Trek films or even the recent batch of Star Wars films.My fiancee and I went to see the film and we spent two glorious hours watching our favorite ensemble cast continuing their adventures, showing absolutely no signs that any time had passed, even though technically for them only a few months had passed, and for my fiancee and I only a day had passed since we had watched the entire series over the course of a few weeks leading up to the premiere of this movie.  and for many fans maybe a year or two had gone by, but anyway, seeing the film was a definite vindication for science fiction in general, because its not often that a series that barely lasted a full season gets turned into a major motion picture, but we can all be greatful that Universal has a much better appreciation for this show, these characters and the universe they inhabit than Fox did.The movie itself is fantastic, and I know it may be a bit biased since I'm already a fan, but even if I weren't a fan of the show I'd still think it's a brillaint movie, and if I wasn't already a fan of the series, this movie would prompt me to become a fan, that's how good it is.I can only hope that this movie will spark sequels or even a renewed television series, I don't know, stranger things have happened, but the one thing that's abundantly clear, the story of the crew of Serenity is far from over.

The story is recycled, its vision is narrow and simplistic, the actors shift into and out of their accents from scene to scene, the special effects are TV-movie quality, and the imagery is out of context (spaceships emerging from an ""ion cloud"" in space as if they were Lord Nelson's fleet emerging from a fog bank?  Please.)  So why 3.5 stars?

The characters are multi-dimensional (if also anachronistic -- if that's not a non sequitor, given the context), and the actors (forget the bad accents) actually try to inhabit their characters instead of mailing in their performances.  And they have imaginative dialog to work with.  Note to George Lucas: next time, skimp on a few of the droid effects so that you can pay an actual screenwriter.  The look River gives Simon when he asks, ""am I talking to Miranda now?"" is better than anything in the last three Star Wars installments.

951655,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BW7QWW,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 44]","**1/2""Serenity"" is writer/director Joss Whedon's theatrical film follow-up to his defunct TV series, ""Firefly.""  I have never seen the original show so I have no idea how a fan would be likely to react to this film.  As a newbie, however, I can only report that ""Serenity"" might have been a bit more fun if it didn't look and feel quite so much like a ""Star Wars"" wannabe.  Instead of the ""Empire,"" here we have the ""Alliance"" as the mega-force against which the rebel forces are fighting.  The twist in this case is that the rebels have been forced to give up their more noble aspirations of overthrowing a repressive regime and have turned to what amounts to inter-galactic bank robbery and payroll heists to put food on the table after suffering a defeat in the war with the Alliance.  Malcolm Reynolds' transport ship, Serenity, is the equivalent of Han Solo's Millennium Falcon, with its rogue passengers doing battle with the evil forces of not only the Alliance but some carnivorous creatures known as Reavers.The story begins with a 17-year old girl named River, who possesses psychic powers, being brainwashed at the hands of ruthless scientists working for the Alliance.  After her brother, Doc, rescues her from the laboratory, the two of them seek refuge on the Serenity, a ship whose crew is unaware of River's troublesome background.  Soon, the captain, Mal, and his cohorts are plunged into a battle with the Alliance forces who are attempting to destroy River at any and all costs.  Again, as in ""Star Wars,"" the ship and its crew engage in an intergalactic chase with a force much bigger and more powerful that they somehow must find a way to defeat.  There's even a scene so reminiscent of the Luke-I-Am-Your-Father encounter in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that I half expected the combatants to whip out their light sabers at any moment.Despite the feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that permeates the work, ""Serenity"" has a few fun moments involving the characters' interactions with one another.  The rebels aboard the Serenity are not always prime candidates for heroism, often acting as much out of fear and self-interest as righteousness and courage.  The acting is generally wooden, but the plotting is intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the movie.  The special effects are a mite below par for what one would expect to find in a sci-fi film today, but Whedon pushes the action along fast enough to keep us distracted from some of the weaknesses in the visuals.This is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to science fiction entertainment.  The dialogue ranges from the sharp to the cheesy, as does virtually everything else in the movie.  It makes for OK viewing, but, in all honesty, you'd be better off popping ""Star Wars"" into the DVD player and watching the real thing instead.",2,oK at times but too indebted to Star Wars,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2827,"['**1/2', 'Serenity', 'writer/director', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'theatrical', 'film', 'follow-up', 'defunct', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'show', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'react', 'film', 'newbie', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'report', 'Serenity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'feel', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'Star', 'Wars', 'wannabe', 'Instead', 'Empire', 'here', 'have', 'Alliance', 'mega-force', 'rebel', 'forces', 'are', 'fighting', 'twist', 'case', 'rebels', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'more', 'noble', 'aspirations', 'overthrowing', 'repressive', 'regime', 'have', 'turned', 'what', 'amounts', 'inter-galactic', 'bank', 'robbery', 'payroll', 'heists', 'put', 'food', 'table', 'suffering', 'defeat', 'war', 'Alliance', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'transport', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'equivalent', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Millennium', 'Falcon', 'rogue', 'passengers', 'doing', 'battle', 'evil', 'forces', 'not', 'only', 'Alliance', 'carnivorous', 'creatures', 'known', 'Reavers.The', 'story', '17-year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'River', 'who', 'psychic', 'powers', 'being', 'brainwashed', 'hands', 'ruthless', 'scientists', 'working', 'Alliance', 'brother', 'Doc', 'laboratory', 'two', 'seek', 'refuge', 'Serenity', 'ship', 'crew', 'unaware', 'River', 'troublesome', 'background', 'Soon', 'captain', 'Mal', 'cohorts', 'are', 'plunged', 'battle', 'Alliance', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'attempting', 'destroy', 'River', 'costs', 'Again', 'Star', 'Wars', 'ship', 'crew', 'engage', 'intergalactic', 'chase', 'force', 'much', 'bigger', 'more', 'powerful', 'somehow', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'even', 'scene', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'Luke-I-Am-Your-Father', 'encounter', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'half', 'expected', 'combatants', 'whip', 'out', 'light', 'sabers', 'feeling', 'd', 'eacute', 'agrave', 'vu', 'work', 'Serenity', 'few', 'fun', 'moments', 'involving', 'characters', 'interactions', 'one', 'rebels', 'Serenity', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'prime', 'candidates', 'heroism', 'often', 'acting', 'as', 'much', 'fear', 'self-interest', 'righteousness', 'courage', 'acting', 'generally', 'wooden', 'plotting', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest', 'most', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mite', 'par', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'today', 'Whedon', 'action', 'fast', 'enough', 'keep', 'distracted', 'weaknesses', 'visuals.This', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'bag', 'when', 'science', 'fiction', 'entertainment', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'cheesy', 'virtually', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'OK', 'viewing', 'honesty', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'popping', 'Star', 'Wars', 'DVD', 'player', 'watching', 'real', 'thing', 'instead']",N/A

But, before I actually sat through the movie at the theater, I considered myself to be a major believer in the pre-release hype. I love the television series because of it's sence of pure adventure. I, a black man, am not too fond of country music, but the theme song of this series was a catchy tune that I have never tried to forget. I was so looking foreword to this movie.The first slap to my face when the movie started was the absance of the theme music. UNFORGIVABLE! Second, the lack of the humor in the television show was jarring to me. Third, and most important,- Josh Wedon kills off the two characters that I identify with. That fact was a dagger through my goddamn heart. There is more but I will stop with these facts.The movie pulled in about 25 million at the box office. In order for Josh Whedon to have delivered a blockbuster he would have had to have  given movie goers a reason to attend the movie two or three times. He did not deliver. He turned what should have been an uplifting romp that forced viewers to repeated viewings into a depressing, letdown that forced viewers to ponder what they had just seen. The proof of this assertion is in the box office receipts.Josh Wedon has made his living producing quirky, screw-with-your-head product. SERENITY should have demanded more respect than Mr. Whedon held back.I mean, come on Josh Whedon, you kill off two main characters - characters who's back-stories had not even been remotely tapped into. But, and I do not understand this piece of bullcrap - YOU ALLOW THE BAD GUY, A SELF-PROFESSED MURDERER OF CHILDREN AND WOMEN, TO NOT ONLY LIVE BUT RUN OFF INTO THE SUNSET WITH A GODDAMN SMILE AND SMIRK ON HIS FACE. And I am suppose to want to see this mess again? And pay money for admittance? NO!Actually, I should have started this review with the question, 'What in the hell is wrong with Josh Whedon?'The DVD itself is a must have if you are a crazed fan of the director. It is full of the extras stuff you desire. Just remember, as you plunk down your hard earned money for this DVD, you were screwed this Summer by Josh Whedon.

951661,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000BW7QWW,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 6]","""Serenity"" refers to one of two things - it's the name of a run-down space-going freighter captained by Mal. Reynolds.  It was also the name of a valley where was fought the final battle against The Alliance for control of space.  In the distant future, with Earth being a vague memory, The Alliance is dominant.  Control of planets and interstellar travel is almost entirely within the Alliance's domain.  Serenity and her tight-knit crew spend much of their time in that realm of ""almost"".  The only other possible contender for domination of the stars is the ""Reavers"" - a mysterious group of monstrously violent humans who treat their victims with unspeakable brutality, sort of like a cross between Klingons and the Evil Dead.  outwardly, Reynolds seems dispassionate about interstellar freedom - with his crew, he takes on ""jobs"" that straddle (at best) the law, and he's not up to fighting another losing battle with the now all-powerful Alliance.  In this feature film, Reynolds must now take on The Alliance, forced to protect his passenger - River Tam - from them.  Augmented by Alliance technology, River is something of a super-being intended as some kind of weapon.  Rescued by her brother from an Alliance lab before the original series began, River is now the subject of this flick.  Pursued across by the Alliance, Reynolds's only hope is a mysterious world that the Alliance does not control - one deep inside Reaver territory.I really wanted to like this flick, which displays some pretty crisp dialog for a sci-fi flick, but never really comes together.  Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin rock the action better than they did in ""Alias"" and ""Chuck"" respectively, but ""Serenity"" doesn't suffer from a lack of ""rock"" - rather it's one of those flicks that people want to make, but never actually put together.  The story gives us a disarmingly sinister character called ""The Operative"" who's assigned to recover River Tam for The Alliance.  The problem is, we never get a sense (in the movie anyway) as to what The Alliance really stands for - we just sort of assume that they're some authoritarian outfit, the type seen in countless TV shows, films and video games.  Mal & the Operative share some interesting banter when they first meet, but the Operative is smart enough to recognize stalling-for-time when he hears it, and tactless enough to clue us in.  Their next face-to-face meeting is a fight, which debases the film into a kind of video game, an RPG where meetings result in either conversation or combat.The story's biggest weakness is that it seldom feels like it's going anywhere - a plot-thread about River becomes a thread about the Reavers, glued together by the angst of the crew and (ineffectually) by a shared fear or hatred of the Alliance.  These threads would have been best served by arcing plots on a running TV show (yeah, we know it WAS a show, and that it was cancelled while inferior and over-hyped shows and reality TV survived, but don't blame us - it's not our fault!!).  These same plot threads feel awkwardly compressed in a feature film, like an overstuffed suitcase.  Worst of all, the script bathes itself and its characters in a form of sentimentality that deservedly rewards fans of the show, but just confuses those like us who were hoping to discover it with this flick.  Most of the time, the characters have this fun and easygoing rappaport, (the best lines go to, are aimed at or are about Torres and Baldwin, natch), but then get serious and heroic, even though the script doesn't really establish why these guys care about anything or how they can embody such a range of morals and emotion.  In short, the flick appeaars to pick up where the series left off.

If you already have a copy, unless you can't get enough, this version doesn't offer much new.  Plus it's in cinema wide screen, so if you have a 4 X 3 aspect ratio TV, the picture is narrow.The ""Collector's Addition"" offers a second movie commentary, new promo-piece, an expanded production-piece (high on the ""love fest"" index) and a piece that shows River's deterioration at the ""academy.""  The second commentary is the major difference between the Standard and Collector's Addition.  It's very much dominated by Joss Whedon (writer & producer) and Nathan Fallion (Mal) (no surprise there) and is an utterly missed opportunity to explore characters and provide back story.  But in fairness to Nathan Fallion, he does ask others to comment.Ron Glass's (Book's) question about his character's background is not answered by Whedon.  Here's my take - Book was an officer (probably upper level) in an elite anti-crime or CIA like unit, something happened he didn't like, so he left to become a preacher; this was hypothesized from the TV series, which was the basis for the movie.  At one point Whedon describes Simon's devotion to his sister (River) as a fantasy, that this level of devotion couldn't exist.  Well I hope Josh gets to know more of Life; it does exist; and it's not even that uncommon among some groups.Also, if you were hoping to get to know Summer Glau (River) better, except for some stuff in the expanded production section, you may be disappointed.  She says very little throughout the 2 hour commentary.  Nevertheless, Serenity's premise makes for excellent SiFi, and it is a  fun movie.  The question that can't help but surface is, if Joss had such tremendous success with the series DVD sales, why did he abandon plot depth for flash?  The series really sold on substance, not flash.Again, Serenity is good SiFi and a fun ride.  If you can't get enough, then the Collector's Addition is a good idea; on the other hand, if you're not a die-hard fan with a ""regular"" TV,  I'd recommend getting the standard full-screen version.

But the FOX network being the pathetic clowns they are went and canceled a series that had already been building up a huge fallowing. I was crushed when they canceled Firefly but not surprised. The FOX network's landscape is full of creations canceled due to lower then wanted ratings. FOX has this thing, they will cancel a show even if millions are watching, just because they find joy in crushing people's sand Castles. Sometime later when the series DVD came out. The shows popularity went up even higher then before! I was lucky enough to buy the set the day of it's release, while others had to find stores with a current supply of the DVD's. I remember the set moving up into the fifth all around rating on Amazon.FOX, like others, now sees that rating are only a small part of the overall viewing audience. DVD's are literary Gold! Films like the very first (Blade) movie which did not do all that well in the threaters, made Gold on DVD sales.That being said, this movie is so much better then I was hoping it to be. I was hooked into the plot right from the opening scene. Seeing the FireFly transport ship called the Serenity flying towards a planet with the epic Modern/Western music playing in the background. It was like I found home again. I remember waiting for months and months for the show to hopefully come back. Then waiting more and more months for the DVD set. So seeing a full-pledged movie on the Firefly and her crew was so perfect for me.Now I am not going to post a review telling you anything about the plot, because I always hated those people that went way too far into the plot before you have even had a chance to see the movie. All I will say, is I cried at the end of this movie.I hope so mega much that there will be sequels to this movie. I will watch them until I die,  that is how much I love this story. If you loved the show, you will feel right at home. If you are new to the whole story, then you will find your way to being a fan.Please buy as many DVD's as you can!

There are no aliens, and in fact you could take the space out of the show and still have the dedication you see from its proponents.It's really about independence and being a small fish in a large pond being overseen by some much larger fish who just want to ""Make things better"" for you - regardless of whether your idea of better and theirs are similar at all.It's about going against the grain and bristling at the influence of a huge bureaucracy that is too mesmerized by its own vision of the common good to critically examine what it has become.None of this requires that you must be a geek to enjoy these stories. You don't have to be able to recite all the episodes of Star Trek or have an opinion on whether the old or new Battlestar Galactica is better (all true geeks know the new BG is WAY better). If you have just been the poor schmuck standing on line at the DMV, you ""get"" the premise of a system that seems to work for and against you all at the same time. Crank that feeling you get up a couple 100 percent and your getting what firefly and serenity have to offer.In short, it is all worth your time. Every non-geek I have um... well... encouraged (Like locking them in a room with the DVD playing)... has been surprised by what they saw and thanked me for making them watch it.Take a chance to make the time for this movie.

I was browsing online and saw some amazing reviews and my interest was piqued.At the heart of this film, are a crew of characters who are both full of bravery and pragmatism and an intriguing blend of idealism and cynicism.  The movie finds them after they have fought--and lost--a war for independence from a vast, intergalactic empire, which they rejected as tyrannical.  Their suspicions about the motivations and intentions of the ruling elite are borne out by the discovery of a terrible atrocity committed by the imperial government against its own citizens.  It was a crime borne out of a desire for harmony, but its results were ghastly and evil.The director of the film said about its characters, ""They are the people the Enterprise would have just flown by.""  It's an apt description of the type of people they are.  The fringes of the galaxy are their abode, and the ways of brigands and pirates are their methods.  In their souls, there lives a yearning for liberty tempered by the cruelty of war and a sense of justice they resist but in the end cannot ignore.Serenity is the best science-fiction film I've ever seen and will long be viewed by critics as one of the best action films of the decade.",5,"""She's tore, but she'll fly true . . .""",1160438400,"10 10, 2006",2006,1614,"['Serenity', 'film', 'will', 'entrance', 'film', 'buff', ""'re"", 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'not', 'stellar', 'acting', 'skilled', 'directing', 'riveting', 'mysterious', 'plot', 'grab', 'viewer', 'first', 'scene', 'nevet', 'let', 'go', 'finale.I', 'first', 'heard', 'film', 'last', 'summer', 'marketing', 'was', 'focused', 'fans', 'Firely', 'show', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'register', 'was', 'browsing', 'online', 'saw', 'amazing', 'reviews', 'interest', 'was', 'piqued.At', 'heart', 'film', 'are', 'crew', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'full', 'bravery', 'pragmatism', 'intriguing', 'blend', 'idealism', 'cynicism', 'movie', 'have', 'fought', 'lost', 'war', 'independence', 'vast', 'intergalactic', 'empire', 'rejected', 'tyrannical', 'suspicions', 'motivations', 'intentions', 'ruling', 'elite', 'are', 'borne', 'out', 'discovery', 'terrible', 'atrocity', 'committed', 'imperial', 'government', 'own', 'citizens', 'was', 'crime', 'borne', 'desire', 'harmony', 'results', 'were', 'ghastly', 'evil.The', 'director', 'film', 'said', 'characters', 'are', 'people', 'Enterprise', 'would', 'have', 'just', 'flown', 'apt', 'description', 'type', 'people', 'are', 'fringes', 'galaxy', 'are', 'abode', 'ways', 'brigands', 'pirates', 'are', 'methods', 'souls', 'yearning', 'liberty', 'tempered', 'cruelty', 'war', 'sense', 'justice', 'resist', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'ignore.Serenity', 'best', 'science-fiction', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'long', 'be', 'viewed', 'critics', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'decade']",N/A

I had not seen the television show and did not realize this movie was based on that show.When the movie began, I realized I was jumping into an already established story line yet never felt lost for one moment. I was instantly drawn into this strange new world of characters and their side stories. I have to say I tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities. The story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie.The CGI was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done.The movie motivated me to see the entire run of FireFly. I realized that, going back to the movie, there were many jokes or references I had missed the first time due to not seeing the series prior yet,  it did not detract from my film watching experience. I was saddened watching the movie then the television series.

951689,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000BW7QWW,Scott Schiefelbein,"[12, 13]","If you are already a fan of Joss Whedon's tragically-cancelled sci-fi TV series, ""Firefly,"" you don't need to read my review - you're probably already a devoted fan and know the movie and all TV episodes by heart.If you're not already a fan of the aforementioned works and are considering whether to check them out, a few words of caution.  Diving into the TV series ""Firefly"" and this motion picture ""continuation"" ""Serenity,"" presents some risks.  Frustrated significant others will complain that you aren't paying attention to them anymore.  Friends will gripe that you didn't show up at the bar on Friday night.  You will have some sleepy days in the office because you stayed up to watch ""just one more episode"" the night before.  You may even find yourself cursing in Chinese when frustrated.But these risks are worth the rewards of diving into Joss Whedon's futuristic universe.  ""Serenity"" builds on the foundation laid by the TV series, and while it's better if you've seen the series, it's by no means essential to understand ""Serenity.""River Tam is a young girl who is recognized as a prodigy at an early age.  So the sinister ""Alliance,"" who rules over the federation of planets that arose out of the world wars that wracked Earth, took her for nefariouis purposes.  Let's take one of God's great creations and make a weapon out of her!  Her brother, Simon, is destined to be a successful, brilliant wealthy surgeon, but he throws it all away to break River out of her government lab/prison.This has consequences, not least being that the Alliance has more than a few nasty assassins at its beck and call.  Why kill River?  Because she knows Secrets that can harm the Alliance if the truth gets out (the Alliance likes to keep its People docile, ignorant, and tranquil).Unfortunately for the Alliance, Simon and River are in need of transport, and the ship they find (a ""Firefly""-class ship called ""Serenity"" - get it?) is crewed by folks who cannot under any circumstances be described as docile, ignorant, or tranquil.Led by Capt. Mal Reynolds, the crew of ""Serenity"" is classic-Whedon:  lovable, sarcastic, witty, dangerous, and just-a-mite scruffy.  Reynolds is a survivor of the last band of rebels who took on the Alliance and lost, and let's just say he carries a grudge and a few chips on his shoulder.  The rest of the cast has its own sets of idiosyncrasies and lovable traits . . . this is a cast of fully-realized, three-dimensional characters.One of the disadvantages you have when a TV series is adapted to the Big Screen is scope.  While the budget is bigger, the special effects better, and the writing often amazing, you still just don't have the luxury of time that you do in a series.  You have to make hard choices -- what story are you going to tell, and which characters do and do not fit into that primary story?  As a result, some beloved characters from the series are relegated to more supporting roles -- they get their moments, to be sure, but little more.For a well-written story, this is not a bad thing, just unfortunate.  Fortunately, Whedon and his team are great writers, so even the little moments for the ""supporting"" characters are a riot.  But the story does focus primarily on two characters -- Mal and River.  In ""Serenity,"" Mal is a bit darker, a bit more scarred than he was in ""Firefly.""  Sure, he's got his trademark wit, but we explore his pain (and his unending capacity for it) a bit deeper here.  And that's wonderful, because Mal is a great character.We also see a lot more of River in the movie.  In the series, River's story was always hinted at, but you could see that her story was something the writers wanted to weave gradually throughout the series as it evolved.  So there were many episodes where we only got hints and snippets of River and her potential.  ""Serenity"" dives into her story with a belly flop, and believe me, it's one dark tale.Grittier, edgier, and more violent than the TV series, ""Serenity"" is an excellent adaptation to the big screen of one of the little screen's greatest triumphs and tragedies.  Check it out, but don't say I didn't warn you.",5,"""Serenity"" keeps the signal alive -- story focuses on Mal and River",1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,4134,"['are', 'already', 'fan', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'tragically-cancelled', 'sci-fi', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'read', 'review', ""'re"", 'probably', 'already', 'devoted', 'fan', 'know', 'movie', 'TV', 'episodes', 'heart.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'already', 'fan', 'aforementioned', 'works', 'are', 'considering', 'check', 'out', 'few', 'words', 'caution', 'Diving', 'TV', 'series', 'Firefly', 'motion', 'picture', 'continuation', 'Serenity', 'risks', 'Frustrated', 'significant', 'others', 'will', 'complain', 'are', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'anymore', 'Friends', 'will', 'gripe', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'bar', 'Friday', 'night', 'will', 'have', 'sleepy', 'days', 'office', 'stayed', 'up', 'watch', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'episode', 'night', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'cursing', 'Chinese', 'when', 'frustrated.But', 'risks', 'are', 'rewards', 'diving', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'futuristic', 'universe', 'Serenity', 'builds', 'foundation', 'laid', 'TV', 'series', 'better', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'means', 'essential', 'understand', 'Serenity', 'River', 'Tam', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'recognized', 'prodigy', 'early', 'age', 'sinister', 'Alliance', 'who', 'rules', 'federation', 'planets', 'arose', 'world', 'wracked', 'Earth', 'took', 'nefariouis', 'purposes', 'Let', 'take', 'one', 'God', 'great', 'creations', 'make', 'weapon', 'brother', 'Simon', 'destined', 'be', 'successful', 'brilliant', 'wealthy', 'surgeon', 'away', 'break', 'River', 'government', 'lab/prison.This', 'consequences', 'not', 'least', 'being', 'Alliance', 'more', 'few', 'nasty', 'assassins', 'beck', 'call', 'Why', 'kill', 'River', 'Secrets', 'can', 'harm', 'Alliance', 'truth', 'out', 'Alliance', 'likes', 'keep', 'People', 'docile', 'ignorant', 'tranquil', '.Unfortunately', 'Alliance', 'Simon', 'River', 'are', 'need', 'transport', 'ship', 'find', 'Firefly', '-class', 'ship', 'called', 'Serenity', 'get', 'crewed', 'folks', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'circumstances', 'be', 'described', 'docile', 'ignorant', 'tranquil.Led', 'Capt', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'classic-Whedon', 'lovable', 'sarcastic', 'witty', 'dangerous', 'just-a-mite', 'scruffy', 'Reynolds', 'survivor', 'last', 'band', 'rebels', 'who', 'took', 'Alliance', 'lost', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'grudge', 'few', 'chips', 'shoulder', 'rest', 'cast', 'own', 'sets', 'idiosyncrasies', 'lovable', 'traits', 'cast', 'fully-realized', 'three-dimensional', 'characters.One', 'disadvantages', 'have', 'when', 'TV', 'series', 'adapted', 'Big', 'Screen', 'scope', 'budget', 'bigger', 'special', 'effects', 'better', 'writing', 'often', 'amazing', 'still', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'time', 'do', 'series', 'have', 'make', 'hard', 'choices', 'what', 'story', 'are', 'going', 'tell', 'characters', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'primary', 'story', 'result', 'beloved', 'characters', 'series', 'are', 'relegated', 'more', 'supporting', 'roles', 'get', 'moments', 'be', 'sure', 'little', 'more.For', 'well-written', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'Fortunately', 'Whedon', 'team', 'are', 'great', 'writers', 'so', 'even', 'little', 'moments', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'riot', 'story', 'focus', 'primarily', 'two', 'characters', 'Mal', 'River', 'Serenity', 'Mal', 'bit', 'darker', 'bit', 'more', 'scarred', 'was', 'Firefly', 'Sure', 'got', 'trademark', 'wit', 'explore', 'pain', 'unending', 'capacity', 'bit', 'deeper', 'here', 'wonderful', 'Mal', 'great', 'character.We', 'also', 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'River', 'movie', 'series', 'River', 'story', 'was', 'always', 'hinted', 'could', 'see', 'story', 'was', 'something', 'writers', 'wanted', 'weave', 'gradually', 'series', 'evolved', 'So', 'were', 'many', 'episodes', 'where', 'only', 'got', 'hints', 'snippets', 'River', 'potential', 'Serenity', 'story', 'belly', 'flop', 'believe', 'one', 'dark', 'tale.Grittier', 'edgier', 'more', 'violent', 'TV', 'series', 'Serenity', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'little', 'screen', 'greatest', 'triumphs', 'tragedies', 'Check', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn']",N/A

951692,A3FNMXUTYOJEHX,B000BW7QWW,Sean Foushee,"[8, 10]","When Joss Whedon's Firefly aired on Fox in 2002 it was at a time in my life where work dominated everything and TV was a distant thought.  It wasn't until Christmas 2005 that a friend of mine told me about the series when I mentioned that I was interested in buying the DVD of the movie Serenity, that unfortunately had a theatrical run in the last month of my wife's pregnancy and 2 hours at the theatre was not the best use of my time.  At the time of Serenity's release I had no idea the series and movie were connected, and had it not been for my friend's suggestion I would have bought the DVD of Serenity and been left completely confused.Anyone considering watching Serenity should take the time and buy Firefly: The Complete Series here on Amazon (best $40 you'll spend on entertainment).  Think of the series DVDs as a 14 part prequel to Serenity, a chance to dip your toe in the vast 'verse Joss Whedon created and the backstory of some of the complex characters that call Serenity home.  Serenity begins shortly after the end of the series and while at first the interaction between some of the crew, Mel in particular, seem harsh and uncharacteristic (especially after watching the series) you begin to understand that the untold story between the series and the movie took a terrible toll on the crew of Serenity.  This story is told without any regard to someone who's never seen the original TV series so I again highly recommend buying the Firefly series before embarking on Serenity's feature voyage.As a newcomer to this 'verse I feel sad to know that the 14 episodes+1 movie that were some of the best storytelling and cinematography to ever grace the small or big screen might never have another chance on either venues.  The camera work in Firefly/Serenity remind me of the revisioned Battlestar Galactica series on the Sci-Fi network (the series is most likely where Ronald Moore and Co. got their 'documentary' ideas from) and really help put you into the story.  The movie is shot in such a way that you're drawn in, instead of the cold staged shots typical of big productions, Serenity is more organic which brings a sense of realism to the characters and their plight.Everyone who is a fan of sci-fi will love this movie and the Firefly series, but the real gem in Joss' storytelling is anyone, no matter what genre appeals to them, can find themselves at home aboard Serenity.",5,Best Show I Never Saw,1138924800,"02 3, 2006",2006,2403,"['When', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'aired', 'Fox', '2002', 'was', 'time', 'life', 'where', 'work', 'dominated', 'everything', 'TV', 'was', 'distant', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'Christmas', '2005', 'friend', 'mine', 'told', 'series', 'when', 'mentioned', 'was', 'interested', 'buying', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'theatrical', 'run', 'last', 'month', 'wife', 'pregnancy', '2', 'hours', 'theatre', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'use', 'time', 'time', 'Serenity', 'release', 'had', 'idea', 'series', 'movie', 'were', 'connected', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'friend', 'suggestion', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Serenity', 'been', 'left', 'completely', 'confused.Anyone', 'considering', 'watching', 'Serenity', 'should', 'take', 'time', 'buy', 'Firefly', 'Complete', 'Series', 'here', 'Amazon', 'best', '40', ""'ll"", 'spend', 'entertainment', 'Think', 'series', 'DVDs', '14', 'part', 'prequel', 'Serenity', 'chance', 'dip', 'toe', 'vast', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'created', 'backstory', 'complex', 'characters', 'call', 'Serenity', 'home', 'Serenity', 'shortly', 'end', 'series', 'first', 'interaction', 'crew', 'Mel', 'particular', 'seem', 'harsh', 'uncharacteristic', 'especially', 'watching', 'series', 'begin', 'understand', 'untold', 'story', 'series', 'movie', 'took', 'terrible', 'toll', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'story', 'told', 'regard', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'buying', 'Firefly', 'series', 'embarking', 'Serenity', 'feature', 'newcomer', ""'verse"", 'feel', 'sad', 'know', '14', 'episodes+1', 'movie', 'were', 'best', 'storytelling', 'cinematography', 'ever', 'grace', 'small', 'big', 'screen', 'might', 'never', 'have', 'chance', 'venues', 'camera', 'work', 'Firefly/Serenity', 'remind', 'revisioned', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'series', 'Sci-Fi', 'network', 'series', 'most', 'likely', 'where', 'Ronald', 'Moore', 'Co.', 'got', ""'documentary"", 'ideas', 'really', 'help', 'put', 'story', 'movie', 'shot', 'such', 'way', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'instead', 'cold', 'staged', 'shots', 'typical', 'big', 'productions', 'Serenity', 'more', 'organic', 'sense', 'realism', 'characters', 'plight.Everyone', 'who', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Firefly', 'series', 'real', 'gem', 'Joss', 'storytelling', 'anyone', 'matter', 'what', 'appeals', 'can', 'find', 'home', 'aboard', 'Serenity']",N/A

After getting around to watching the series, I couldn't see what all the hoopla was about--the premise was interesting but it was ""okay"" at best.  To me, the metaphor is way too literal--sure, the concept that 500 years in the future if people from Earth are on other planets not everything will be all bright and ""shiny"" (heh) is great, but the phony ""western"" accents and dusty towns where people wore cowboy hats and frilly dresses just grated on my nerves.  (Also, I had to watch the first half of the first episode I had TiVoed twice, finding that I had missed almost all of it because it didn't hold my attention.)  So on to the movie--I'd heard it was ""so"" funny and great, so I wanted to see it, thinking since it was released to the general public it would be more polished.  But while watching it, I began to realize it was just like watching a long episode of the televison show--it didn't really have a ""movie""-like plot at all.  To tell the truth, there were two episodes of the TV show that I enjoyed more than the movie--episode 12, ""Heart of Gold,"" and episode 10 (but the last episode filmed, as they were aired out of order), ""Objects in Space""--especially the latter.  ""Objects in Space,"" I presume, was made when they knew the show was being cancelled and therefore should be the jumping off point for the movie, yet River, more or less the focal point of the show and movie, I found much more impressive in ""Objects in Space"" than Serenity.  To me, Serenity seemed like it was a TV movie appeasing fans who wanted to see more of the show, rather than a big-screen movie released to the general public.  It's great for the fans who wanted to see more, but to me, it seems it would have been better for those who hadn't seen the show especially had they kept what fans saw as the charm of the show but given it a more cohesive plot too.  To conclude, my advice?  If you've seen Firefly and haven't seen Serenity, see it.  If you haven't seen either but want to see Serenity, well, see it.  If you've seen Serenity and now want to see Firefly, again, see it.  If you haven't seen either, but just want to see what I, personally, recommend, maybe catch episodes 10 and 12 when they play a Firefly marathon on SciFi.

In its unusual blend of sharp-shooting space cowboys and oriental mythology, it yokes together something proprietary to its fantastic world, something that has the electricity to make it all seem worthwhile.The scene is 500 years from now. A bunch of renegades fly around in space, spewing witty banter more than anything more productive -- but really, the dialogue is sharp throughout. Abroad this ship is a psychic girl, who for her dazzling powers had been apparently captured and trained by the 'Alliance' (those big bad unseen powers in charge of the universe, as usual) in a top secret program to manufacture human weapons, but has since been rescued by her brother and brought back to the ship.As you can probably tell, the Alliance must now spread its whiz-bang tentacles and repossess her. Which in turn sets us up for a lickety-split chase-athon of a flick, with all its twists and turns and bone-crunching bursts of martial art. Surprisingly, the actors are pretty confident in their parts, which is impressive considering that I had never seen any of them before. Particular praise for the captain of the ship, the psychic girl, and the lead operative of the Alliance who sports a British accent, but that's eminently forgivable.Strongly recommended if you are looking to snazz up a slow weekend and have had patience for Starwars type fare.",4,TOTAL RECALL MEETS STARWARS: EXPLOSIVE COWBOY RIDE THRU SPACE,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,1492,"['Little', 'surprise', 'see', 'wheedling', 'five-star', 'votes', 'gritty', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'breezy', 'glide', 'outer', 'world', 'unusual', 'blend', 'sharp-shooting', 'space', 'cowboys', 'oriental', 'mythology', 'together', 'something', 'proprietary', 'fantastic', 'world', 'something', 'electricity', 'make', 'seem', 'worthwhile.The', 'scene', '500', 'years', 'now', 'bunch', 'renegades', 'fly', 'around', 'space', 'spewing', 'witty', 'banter', 'more', 'anything', 'more', 'productive', 'really', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'Abroad', 'ship', 'psychic', 'girl', 'who', 'dazzling', 'powers', 'had', 'been', 'apparently', 'captured', 'trained', ""'Alliance"", 'big', 'bad', 'unseen', 'powers', 'charge', 'universe', 'usual', 'top', 'secret', 'program', 'manufacture', 'human', 'weapons', 'been', 'rescued', 'brother', 'brought', 'back', 'ship.As', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'Alliance', 'must', 'now', 'spread', 'whiz-bang', 'tentacles', 'repossess', 'Which', 'turn', 'sets', 'up', 'lickety-split', 'chase-athon', 'flick', 'twists', 'turns', 'bone-crunching', 'bursts', 'martial', 'art', 'Surprisingly', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'confident', 'parts', 'impressive', 'considering', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Particular', 'praise', 'captain', 'ship', 'psychic', 'girl', 'lead', 'operative', 'Alliance', 'who', 'sports', 'British', 'accent', 'eminently', 'forgivable.Strongly', 'recommended', 'are', 'looking', 'snazz', 'up', 'slow', 'weekend', 'have', 'had', 'patience', 'Starwars', 'type', 'fare']",N/A

I found the dvd set and I absolute loved the story line, characters and universe. It's a kind of western in space, focusing on the bad guys. Except that the bad guys lost a war, fly in a space ship, shoot six-guns and are on the outer fringe of a great society. It doesn't take long to get into this and Whedon (Buffy and Angel television shows) does a great job with the characters and the stories. The characters are unique and very human. Each has their own backstory and motivations yet they seem very much like ordinary people. This is due to their individual talents as actors and Whedon's own skill in using his actors.It's not at all necessary to watch the dvds to love the movie. There is just enough back story in the movie so that one can get caught up quickly and understand what drives the story. The movie still moves very fast and is a bit more complicated than all of the other big screen sci-fi movies that came out this year.If you're a fan of Firefly then this review won't be much more than a chorus of the praises you're already heard or sung yourself. If you haven't seen it, please do so. You'll see a greatly entertaining movie with a lot of action and humor and some sad bits, too.

951706,AI0KXH1O95X0H,B000BW7QWW,"Sir Robert ""Order of the Anglophiles""","[6, 6]","Simply put, Serenity is the movie version of the TV series ""Firefly."" It puts together all the loose ends that the series left dangling after only 14 episodes and nary a season (only 11 of these episodes were aired before being cut off.) In Serenity, we can see the arc of what ""Firefly"" could have been, and in my opinion, much more.Since Serenity is the movie and the culmination (?), it is only proper that it be given the cinematic touch. And yet, even on the big screen, its TV origin is still very apparent. The Firefly cargo ship Serenity is still as clunky as it was as shown in the tube. There's not much change in the costume, and even most of the sets still look like they've been picked up from the scrapyard. I am not saying this in disgust, but with affection because it is the characters that I have come to love after all. Come to think of it, there is something in Serenity that makes me think more of home than I would the Starship Enterprise. Perhaps this is one of the formulas that make the movie work. Like what I said in my review of ""Firefly,"" great science fiction doesn't have to be high-budgeted with wall to wall CGI (although it does help tremendously.)Most sci-fi films tend to take the genre into some mythical dimension. ""Battlestar Galactica"" is one such example of sci-fi that mixes myth and science in that it purports the human origin as having come from another planet (which is probably true.) ""Star Wars"" is another classic example in that it believes in a universal Force that is in all things, and that the right WILL triumph over the wrong. The Star Trek series, while primarily adventure-oriented, also sometimes have this tendency for the ethereal: note Spock's resurrection in the Star Trek film ""The Search for Spock,"" or even the Voyager satellite that achieved massive knowledge and became more than just a machine in Star Trek-The Motion Picture.""Firefly"" and ""Serenity,"" on the other hand, beg to be different. In the Whedon `verse, aliens are conspicuously absent, there are no blackholes that threaten ships, no exploding stars, no technobabble to make things more ""authentic,"" no warping here and there, and no extinct alien civilization that leaves us mystified as to what might have caused their demise (Babylon 5.) Instead of all the above, we are given the gritty Frontier life in the outer edges of known space where the long arm of the Central law is not yet fully established. Sounds familiar? Fans of ""Firefly"" know that this has strong parallels with the American Western frontiers from two centuries ago. The Frontier overtones are so strong that even our heroes still carry guns, instead of the usual lasers. The captain himself wears pants that look like they came from the old American Civil War days of the 1860s.Enough said. The plot: Simon and River Tam, brother and sister, are on the run from the Alliance, the central government of the planets five hundred years from now. River was part of a mad experiment by the higher echelons of power that turned her (and maybe even others) into a kickboxing and mind-reading assasin. The siblings are hiding under the wings of the titular ship Serenity. Their destination: as far out as they can go. The ship is captained by Malcom Reynolds (the good-looking and therefore popular-among-women Mr. Nathan Fillion,) an embittered sergeant from the Independent Faction that once fought the Alliance for, well, Independence. On their tail is a nameless Operative, a superior speciman of an assasin, out to take River back at all costs. Of course, there's much more than what I had just said. Into the storyline are thrown a mixture of interesting characters such as a Companion (a certified pleasure-giver in the sexual way,) a Christian priest, a universal hacker and the loyal Serenity crew. Plus, who can forget the Reavers, for what would the fringes of space be like without them?Perhaps the thing that makes ""Serenity"" exciting is the way Captain Reynolds outwitted the frighteningly cool but ultimately disgusting Operative (played to perfection by Mr. Chiwetel Ejiofor) not only once, but thrice. As a personal opinion, I like the fight scenes between these two the best. If romance can have electricity between two characters, so can a brawl between two fighters.As I have mentioned in my review of ""Firefly,"" the story of the Whedon `verse has much potential. I believe that many of you think that ""Serenity"" is a wrap-up of ""Firefly."" Excuse me for saying that I just don't think this is so. For starters, I find it very hard to believe that Mal's broadcast of the SIGNAL can even slightly affect the tight grip of the Alliance government. But the underground movement is bound to be moved for sure, and therein lies another branch of story in the Whedon `verse. And what of the Reavers? They deserve better spotlight for what they really are. If Reavers get killed all the time, why does it seem like they're not diminishing? As for River, what is the real purpose of the Alliance for her? Why the ghastly experiments to create more dangerous assasins when Operatives could have done very well? Questions, questions, and further questions......., that is the potential of the Whedon `verse that I am talking about.Overall, ""Serenity"" is the worthy movie of ""Firefly."" It should be for it is what Browncoats fans expect. For the Firefly-uninitiated, it will still pass as a very entertaining movie. Script is crisp and no nonsense. Jokes sometimes fall lame, but otherwise good-natured. Good story pacing and always commanding attention. Mr. Whedon's efforts to avoid plot cliches are very evident. Good CGI concept especially the scene where the Alliance and the Reavers spaceships come face to face beneath the ion cloud. The ""Leaf on the Wind"" sequence is also nicely done, and is one of the scenes that lift ""Serenity"" to a grander scale. But the Chinese they blurt out!! If Shakespeare were Chinese, he'd be turning in his grave right now!!Anyway, just sit back and enjoy this sci-fi flick. Sure, some people may not like it (a friend of mine didn't like ""Firefly"" but liked ""Serenity"",) because it really looks like a very B film. Plus, it doesn't have that mythical quality that most people yearn from the mysteries of space. But just for the film's adventure story and the love that Mr. Joss Whedon has put into it, makes the film highly watchable.",5,Highly Likeable Sci-Fi Flick That Is Highly Original In Its Own

This movie has a great deal of feedback from people on Amazon, who love it too...but why? I thought this movie sucked.I like Science Fiction and grew up reading Larry Niven, watching the original Star Wars trilogy, loving Aliens (perhaps best sci-fi movie ever), and playing a lot of ""Star Frontiers,"" which is D&D; in space (I played A LOT of normal AD&D; too).Now I have never seen Firefly, but this is a movie that should be at least good on it's own merits somewhat right? But it's not, it's really really bad. My gut even wants to give it one star, but that should be saved for really really bad movies, I could at least sit through this.First, it's a diluted, dilapidated version of Star Wars. I won't accuse it of being a rip-off or a copy (and I don't think it was intentionally-although others may know better) However, the captain was so much a crappy copy of Han Solo, even the clothes and the pistol belt and well, just about everything, it was painful to watch. Of course that role of the rouge (hidden idealist) captain is almost an archetype now, which makes it even more silly and what's even worse is the archetype big strong loud guy on the ship (name is not worth remembering) and the token black girl (wait, no, they're not worse, the captain is the worst offender). More than that, What's with the contemporary clothes, ESPECIALLY the Hawaiian shirt worn by the pilot, how silly is that?

It is not a stand-alone film that's easy or desirable for the general public to watch whether rented or purchased.I sure didn't enjoy it. It was all over the place jumping around, difficult to follow, with a kind of Han Solo/Indiana Jones space-cowboy lead character. Fans of the show clearly are not finding it hard to follow and are enjoying Serenity thoroughly. Fans are rejoicing to get the loose ends of the cancelled series tied up in this movie. But I picked up this movie thinking that the movie was a new sci-fi theatrical release with no prior TV history. My bad.Serenity is a movie for the disappointed fans (and apparently there are a lot of them) of what was perhaps a decent TV series. I wouldn't really know about that though because I never watched Firefly. There is a big diversion between fans and critics. Fans say it was unjustly and prematurely cancelled. But the other side of the coin is that the quality of the show was conspicuous by its cancellation.So fans, please don't be mad at me for this negative review...rather appreciate the warning for naive, impulse movie purchasers like myself: Viewers that were not Firefly fans should proceed with caution.",2,Looks Like Bad TV.

To make a living they take on all sorts of legal and illegal activities.  Enter ""River"" the strange twisted girl who has been trained to be psychic and a human weapon.  The plot revolves around the search for River by a smooth, evil operative of the Alliance and the flight of Captain Malcolm Reynolds, River, and the Serenity's rollicking crew of misfits.  It's a dark melancholy movie in many ways, but with lots of good dialogue and gritty, blood-soaked action. I was reminded a bit of ""Batman Begins"" because of its dark side.

The scripting and camera work is occasionally over the top - I'm sorry, you can't make something dramatic by focusing in on bare feet, walking on a floor. But the acting was ok and if you ignore the over the top premise, the movie moves along well.

There were some very funny lines. Decent late night popcorn-muncher.Addendum: Having now seen all of Firefly (GREAT series!), this movie looks better than it did.

Melvin,"[1, 1]","...falling to the eventual demise of poor decision making by large movie houses that fail to see a good thing when they have one.That, however, was to the benefit of all Firefly followers around the world, as it allowed Mr Joss Whedon to create and produce this very entertaining movie as a means of bringing the short lived series to a close.  The series, as many know, was cancelled by a particular production house, because viewership wasn't what they expected.  Really?  The tons of fans would beg to differ.  They allowed some fairly aweful stuff to stay on television during the same period and yet this series was canned.  Makes no sense......but alas, this is about the movie Serenity, not the overall issues with the franchise that singlehandedly killed it.  Serenity picks up where Firefly left off - sort of.  We finally learn about River's amazing skill set.  We see the &#34;man&#34; moving in to catch, return or kill her to prevent the secret from getting out - and we see human perseverance at its finest...or as it is well put in the film - &#34;can't stop the signal.&#34;That was the true beauty of this series/movie.  Not the sci-fi/western mix (which was an awesome concept btw), but the fact that this crew of &#34;outlaws&#34; did whatever it took to survive and did it without hurting innocent people.  Sure a few laws were broken, but when the laws are designed to make anything and everything you want to do illegal, then the people will revolt.  Besides, the characters, even the Companion, were all written and designed to be good people with morals, integrity, and conviction.  From all walks of life - preacher, companion, doctor, veteren, and gun nut - this movie had it all.And then, there is River - the main purpose behind this ragtag band of merry spacefarers travels through the universe (she's the girl on the cover art).  She is a young, gifted girl who was taken from her home by the corporation to exploit her mental capacity and refine her into a weapon - well, like all good weapons, sometimes they backfire, especially when mishandled.  And River puts that premise forward in some of the best possible ways during this movie.  Without spoiling anything - just wait for the final fight scene that she is in.Overall, this movie was a great conclusion to an excellent series that ended far, far too early.  The likelihood of this series coming back, especially with Joss Whedon's schedule (not to mention all the actors) is infinitesimally small, but that's all that most Browncoats (true fans of this series - and also the name of the resistance forces during the &#34;Great War&#34;) need to carry on...a little hope can go a long way.

The realm of science fiction being concerned with the future and improved technology normally carries a progressive message and constructs utopian societies in which people are 'better' than real-life people are today. In serenity there does exist such a society but it is counterbalanced with the relative anarchy and savagery of the outer worlds, this is a refreshingly realistic viewpoint in my opinion. The crew of the film come across as real people, not at all like the crew of a Star Trek vessel anyway, the captain is abrasive, ruthless and capable of immoral actions yet is also heroic.The film itself is concerned with this question of the scientific enhancement of our quality of life, the dangers of what might happen when authorities try to re-make humanity into a less violent form. The question of individual freedom versus Authoritarian benevolence. The film does a splendid job of bringing together many interesting characters (none more interesting than The Operative played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and locations and breathing life into this interesting world. The effects may look a little amateurish at times though the interplanatary scenes are beautifully rendered. The story is a real gripper, at the part were the Reaver fleet emerges from the nebula i found myself cheering out loud.

It's an extension of the series and has all the same feel and pacing that you would expect from the series. If you aren't familiar with Firefly it's is a space opera kind of science fiction (high adventure in space) that combines the classic cowboy show type elements into a really neat package. It may seem like a weird combination, but it works in a really nice way. It's best for you new folk to check out Firefly first, then come back to me about Serenity.Now Serenity, like I said before, is very much an extension of Firefly. You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story. This particular chapter starts off simple then opens up pretty big. One thing I notice though was it felt like an extended and well produced television show instead of a movie. The pacing and how the plot opens up has an episodic feel to it. But don't let that keep you from seeing Serenity. If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.While this movie only had a budget about $40 million you wouldn't know by looking at it. They put that money on some fantastic special effects. The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles. I'm talking about ship battles with more intensity than Star Wars Episode III. Even if the movie feel likes a TV show the audio is a major boost up and the added effects do stand out in a very good way. The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie. The music is also a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.This release is essentially a re-release of the Blu-Ray and DVD in one package with one extra never before offered: A digital copy disk. Finally you now can upload a legit copy of Serenity to your portable device, which a lot of people have been looking for. Here is a list of all of the features:Alliance Database - Includes dossiers on all of the Firefly crew, profiles on planets, various historical entries, vehicle references and details on the reavers.U Control - This is broken down into four sections: Mr. Universe Compendium, Digital Tour of Serenity, Picture in Picture and Visual Commentary. It appears these are all interactive features instead of simple menu items.BD Live: My Scenes Sharing - Additional content can be offered if you have an internet enabled BD player (and storage space).Feature Commentery with Writer and Director Joss Whedon - A lot of director-type information like lighting and what camera lenses they used, but mentions nothing in lines of background info on the story. Joss also self-depreciates himself a lot on the commentary. First it's entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.Feature Commentary with Joss Whedon & Cast Members Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass. They did a lot of cutting up in that one. Fun to listen to for a while.Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Director Joss Whedon - Nine total. Some of these scenes are nice and some are so-so. Would be nice if Joss made a director's cut and put some of these scenes back in.Future History: The Story of Earth That Was - Interview with Joss Whedon on how he got Firefly off the ground and so forth.What's In A Firefly - Essentially a featurette on the special effects of the movie.Re-Lighting The Firefly - Little documentary on the canceling of Firefly and how it came back to life in the form of this movie. Almost a tear-jerker for fans who experienced it firsthand.A Filmmaker's Journey - A more in-depth documentary on the creating the movie. Includes some nice details on the actor's and how well they work together.We'll Have A Fruity Oaty Good Time! - Mini-doc on the creation of the crazy commercial that River went nuts after watching. Comes with the complete commercial.Extended Scenes - Four scenes in the movie in their extended glory. don't expect anything massive. These extended scenes aren't longer by much. I have no idea why Joss doesn't just put these in the disk and call the movie the extended edition. Oh well...Take A Walk On Serenity - A snarky tour of the set with the director and actors.The Green Clan - Documentary on Jeff Green the cinematographer.Session 416 - All five web videos on River's final sessions at the academy they released prior to the movie.On top of all that you get 2.35:1 1080p video and lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. If you are a fan of Firefly and haven't gotten Serenity yet... well shame on you. If you have the DVD and are ready to make the jump to Blu-Ray... well the previous disk is a bit cheaper now. So this is for those fans who want the digital copy. If you don't know anything about Firefly I suggest seeing the show first. Netflix has it and the series is on DVD and Blu-Ray everywhere. It's best to experience the series and move to this movie as everything comes together much better.",5,Finally a Digital copy w/ Blu-Ray!!!,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,4997,"['love', 'Firefly',

Set in the future, Serenity picks up about where its predecessor (the short-lived, but much-loved, sci-fi/Western series Firefly) left off, weaving a tale that is rich and complex, bound to snare both fans and non-fans alike.  Written and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series creator Joss Whedon, Serenity brings back the entire cast of regulars from Firefly: Nathan Fillion as Capt. Mal Reynolds; Gina Torres as Zoe; Alan Tudyk as Zoe's husband, Wash; Morena Baccarin as Inara; Jewel Staite as ship's mechanic Kaylee; Sean Maher as doctor-turned-fugitive Simon Tam; Summer Glau as Simon's sister, River; Adam Baldwin as Jayne; and Barney Miller's Ron Glass as Shepherd Book.  I am pleased to know that all of the Firefly regulars chose to come back for Serenity; had they declined, the film would have been nowhere as good as the series, and I would have been even less inclined to watch it.All in all, I have to say that Joss did a wonderful job with Serenity.

951724,AGMW3I34INNYG,B000BW7QWW,Stephen Cannon,"[5, 6]","Serenity, based on the short lived TV series ""Firefly,"" is essentially a space western, or a cowboy sci-fi story, depending on your vantage point.  Although ""Firefly"" lived a shourt television life, it was released on DVD and found a new audience there.  Now, armed with the original cast, a bigger budget, and a good script, Joss Whedon, the mind behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" brings his trademark imagination and wit to his feature directing debut.In a future where space is still being discovered and colonized by humanity, Malcolm Reynolds and his ragtag crew aboard the Serenity are getting by as a crew of smugglers and thieves, doing odd jobs wherever they can.  When an assassin tracks them down, looking for the young girl River, questions arise as to River's shady past.  Is she a killing machine?  What does she know?  Colflicts arise among the crew; some of them want her to be gone, sparing them extra trouble, while her brother, the ship's doctor, insists that she can be saved and will not kill the ship's crew.The story takes many turns but stays interesting throughout.  The cast, all pretty much unknown, perform as a solid ensemble.  The effects are beautiful and virtually seamless.  This is a breath of fresh air.

951725,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B000BW7QWW,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[0, 0]","Not having seen the television show it's based on -- but well aware of its grand reputation among many sci-fi fans -- I watched ""Serenity"" with great expectations.  Perhaps too great.  The film is reasonably crafted but nothing groundbreaking, as pretty much all of the contemporary cliches are there: wisecracking crew, ramshackle spaceship, snarky interpersonal relationships, an oppressive galactic empire, rather slow and clumsy martial arts, and so on.  The film offers a few surprises, but even they seem borrowed from other projects.  Shades of the famous scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" the put-upon, Han Solo-esque captain, for instance, shoots his apparently unarmed adversary rather than get into a prolonged fight . . . the difference here is that it leads to a prolonged fight anyway.  The production is an ADHD combination of elements, something of a pastiche of ""Star Wars"" tossed with ""Blade Runner"" and an odd American western sensibility mixed with some troublng eastern subtexts.  (I asked someone about this and, apparently, Asians are the primary architects of this dypstopian future, which at least partially explains yet another nearly all Anglo spaceship crew.)Now, the more important issue:  Does it all work?  For the most part and taken for what it is, which is to say shoot-'em-up sci-fi, yes.  Though ""Serenity"" feels like a TV show, except for some requisite scenes of exposition in the middle, it moves at a fast enough pace for viewers to overlook its shortcomings.  The cast is competent if relatively unknown (I did recognize Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass), even if they look a bit like second-tier soap opera types or porn stars.  A standout is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who makes for a particularly icy villain.

951727,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000BW7QWW,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[34, 36]","By now you've no doubt read the full range of reviews from those who think Joss Whedon is God, to those who think this movie is the scum of existence.  (I'm puzzled how a simple movie can create such emotional responses, but I digress.I'll tell you this, I went into this movie having never seen any of the original FireFly TV series.  I went in expecting big Sci-Fi action - I came out thinking, ""That was not a Sci-Fi movie"" - and it's not.  It's a western - in space!  Yes, these people are in spaceships - and yes, they are on different planets - and yes, it is in the future.  But at this point, the Sci-Fi aspect has reached its zenith.  Every planet they land on could be earth, there are no ""strange alien worlds"" - in fact, there are no aliens at all!  And their guns do not fire lasers, they fire regular bullets.  And they don't beam down to the service, they fly down.  Basically, aside from the spaceships moving them from planet to planet, there is little Sci-Fi to this at all - well, the whole ""government turned my sister into a psychic super-weapon"" thing is Sci-Fi, but that's about it.  As for action - again, not a big budget blow-'em-up action type of movie.  There is a ""hovercraft to ship"" chase near the beginning, and a brief but major space battle near the end - but in between, it's mostly fisticuffs for the action.  So, in short, if you are looking for a STAR WARS style big-action movie, or a STAR TREK themed science fiction alien-fest, you will likely hate this movie!BUT - if you like your movies deep and intelligent, then buy this movie.  If you like your cast to have such a strong repore that you'd swear they've known each other from the cradle, buy this movie.  If you like witty dialogue that isn't purile and obscene, nor written on a 6th grade level, BUY THIS MOVIE!  If you like a movie that leaves you begging for just another half-hour to spend with the characters, BUY THIS MOVIE!!Yes, it wasn't what I expected - but it was so much more!  It was a movie with a purpose, a movie with a background, and a movie with a purpose beyond the titilation of violence, sex, explosions, and eye candy.  Joss Whedon, like George Lucas or J.R.R. Tolkein, has not only created a great cast and storyline, but has set them in a world that is so backed-up with sub-story, so possible as our future, and so realistically conveyed, that you end the movie just wanting to explore every aspect of this future world, yet only having just scratched the surface!  Like the best of stories, you leave with the sense that, though what you saw was good, what you didn't see was so much more interesting - and you hope to get a sequel just to delve deeper into that world!  That's why this film drew such comparisons to STAR WARS - not for it's budget, nor for it's mystical force-centric storyline - but for its ability to sell you on the Universe it has created.And let's not forget the actors - this was probably one of the best casts ever assembled (for both the TV series, and the movie).  Through great writing and skilled acting, you get a real sense that these are not actors spouting lines, but real characters who have been working on this ship for over a year now, and have developed a true bond.  Each actor convincingly fills their space with talent and believability.  None of the lines ever feel inserted for the sake of becoming a new catch-phrase - every line is believable and serves a purpose!  This is what TRULY makes this film (and the TV series it came from) so unique and worthy of another fully-budgeted shot at the big time!Unfortunately, everything this film has going for it is exactly what curses it to failure.  The mass audiences of today do not want a deep and well thought out storyline.  They want explosions, boobies, and potty-humor, or else they call it stupid.  Or, if it's set in space, it HAS TO follow the STAR TREK mold, or else it cannot possibly be any good.But, if nothing else, Joss Wheson did his fan base a HUGE favor by bringing the Firefly story arch to a satisfying closure, while still leaving an open door for future stories.  With this movie, one can enjoy the original 13 episodes, and then cap it off with this movie, and feel like they have a complete piece of work, should a sequel or revised TV series never take place.So, if you are tired of the insulting fare Hollywood has spewed onto us over the last few years, SERENITY may be for you.  If the new STAR WARS trilogy left you cold, this might be the movie for you.  If you can appreciate the poetic beauty of a true western set in space, this movie will appeal to you.But if you are simply going in for the misleading DVD cover and the promise of a big action spectacle, you may want to think again!  Even so, give this movie a chance to work it's magic!FINAL NOTE - to all you ""ONE STAR"" reviewers out there, I challenge you to provide an actual REASON why this movie sucks - merely saying, ""IT SUCKS - I'M GIVING IT ONE STAR.

This film is not just as good as the wrongly cancelled TV show, but even better. I loved ""Firefly"" and have no doubt it would have been an excellent show given the time to mature.

Even if you haven't seen the series, you will be able to follow ""Serenity"" (although I do recommend that you do watch the show before the movie to get the full effect). Joss Whedon makes you love his characters. And the situations he places them into in this movie makes them shine in ways they didn't in the show. The story is marvelous and the various themes Whedon explores are brilliant (themes also seen in Buffy and Angel). This is not just some cheap space sci-fi flick, this movie is EPIC! My wife, who ordinarily does not like these types of films, also loved the show-and was astounded by the movie.I just can't stop saying how good this movie really is; you must see it for yourself.

It is a unique vision of the future, and just enough grounded dialogue to keep the audience watching.This is, however, the final part of the saga.  The story hints that there is a little hope for future tales, but (SPOILERS) several crew members are dead. (END SPOILERS)  That shouldn't get your hopes up, though.  On the business end, it was amazing that Serenity was even made, much less a sequel after its lackluster theatrical showing.  Do not despair too much, though.  It's a good ending, and a lot of closure is there.Overall, I think you'll like the film, and you'll probably enjoy the TV show.  But let's not go nuts.

I remember liking it, but as things go, I lost track of it.Well, I tacked on a used Serenity DVD to one of my orders, just as a 'take a chance' type choice.  And I finally got around to watching it recently.Why did I wait so long!!  This is a 2 hour thrill ride that you will not notice is 2 hours in the least!!!  The chemistry between the actors is always noticable, and the humor shared is subtle, but still hits you, and does not lay flat at all!  The contrast between the villian and the anti-hero was also welcome, even if it was a bit western in feel.The story is a little conventional 'chase the truth' type movie.  Where the clues lead to somewhere they know is suicide to venture, but they do it anyway (don't want to give anything else away).  Most of it ties in well though, and only feels contrived at a couple points in the movie.  The dialogue is written oddly, again playing the to the western themes, but you get used to it within the first 30 minutes.The one complaint I have are the very darkly lit shots on the Firefly itself.  I figure this was intentional as there are starkly contrasting shots in other scenes for different 'feels' in the movie.  And a couple of shots were dark to leave you with that 'what just happened!?' feel... to good effect.  However, there were some shots on the Firefly that were just dialogue, and were dark for no good reason.  This group of actors seemed to work well together, so it was a shame to not clearly see all their nuances when interacting.Once you get past that, Serenity is a great movie, well worthy of multiple viewings.

The network pulled the show after only 11 episodes (obviously taking a cue from the Mensa candidates over at the SciFi network who cancelled FARSCAPE). But the show had already spawned a loyal fan base who called themselves ""Browncoats."" They recruited more devotees when the entire series was recently released on DVD and it was their passionate campaigning that helped get Joss Whedon a greenlight to bring his ragtag crew of space explorers to the big screen in SERENITY.I havn't yet seen a single episode of FIREFLY (although I have the DVD's sitting on my bookshelf) but I have to confess that I liked SERENITY better than all 3 of the most recent STAR WARS movies combined. Captain Mal Reynolds seems to be a combination of Captain Kirk, Han Solo, and that wisecracking pilot from your last Southwest flight. (Ya gotta love a captain who picks up the mic and announces, ""We may experience some slight turbulence...and explode"" and a crew member that whines back at him, ""But I don't WANT to explode!"")His crew members all had distinct personalities and you truly believed that they were as devoted to each other as they were to their battle-scarred ship. The movie had the best futuristic dialogue I've heard since MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME. The music worked for me, the visuals worked, and all of those thrilling episodes of derring do were deftly mixed with the wonderful touches of humor and humanity that are Joss Whedon's trademark as a writer.If you enjoy space opera, if you enjoy a good western, if you simply enjoy interesting characters doing interesting things while tossing off genuinely amusing wisecracks, then you should probably find some SERENITY now!(Orginally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros at [...]",5,SERENITY Now!,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,1909,"['probably', 'already', 'know', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'genius', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'did', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'space', 'western', 'called', 'FIREFLY', 'Fox', '2002', 'network', 'pulled', 'show', 'only', '11', 'episodes', 'obviously', 'taking', 'cue', 'Mensa', 'candidates', 'SciFi', 'network', 'who', 'cancelled', 'FARSCAPE', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'spawned', 'loyal', 'fan', 'base', 'who', 'called', 'Browncoats', 'recruited', 'more', 'devotees', 'when', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'passionate', 'campaigning', 'helped', 'get', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'greenlight', 'bring', 'ragtag', 'crew', 'space', 'explorers', 'big', 'screen', 'SERENITY.I', 'hav', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'FIREFLY', 'have', 'DVD', 'sitting', 'bookshelf', 'have', 'confess', 'liked', 'SERENITY', 'better', '3', 'most', 'recent', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'movies', 'combined', 'Captain', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'be', 'combination', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Han', 'Solo', 'wisecracking', 'pilot', 'last', 'Southwest', 'flight', 'Ya', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'captain', 'who', 'up', 'mic', 'announces', 'may', 'experience', 'slight', 'turbulence', 'explode', 'crew', 'member', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'WANT', 'explode', 'crew', 'members', 'had', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'truly', 'believed', 'were', 'as', 'devoted', 'other', 'were', 'battle-scarred', 'ship', 'movie', 'had', 'best', 'futuristic', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'MAD', 'MAX', 'BEYOND', 'THUNDERDOME', 'music', 'worked', 'visuals', 'worked', 'thrilling', 'episodes', 'derring', 'do', 'were', 'deftly', 'mixed', 'wonderful', 'touches', 'humor', 'humanity', 'are', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'trademark', 'writer.If', 'enjoy', 'space', 'opera', 'enjoy', 'good', 'western', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'interesting', 'characters', 'doing', 'interesting', 'things', 'tossing', 'off', 'genuinely', 'amusing', 'wisecracks', 'then', 'should', 'probably', 'find', 'SERENITY', 'now', 'Orginally', 'published', 'website', 'author', 'Teresa', 'Medeiros', '[', ']']",N/A

It felt as if I was watching a very long television episode3. The endingThe rest was unbelievable.  As in good, very good.  In my entire life there has only been two movies that I really like despite not knowing why.  This is one of them.  I am not a ""Browncoat"" nor a big sci-fi fan.  However I do enjoy the genre, despite being very cliche.  Serenity manages to avoid this by eliminating a fair number of them, and attempting to use science (still riddled with techno mumbo jumbo unfortunately) to explain the rest.  The only problems left is how the ship flies (it should blow up), something no series that I've seen has managed to explain, and having it be only 500 years in the future.  I do believe the technology could exist, but a multi-generational ship whould take time, plus the terra-forming decades, plus time for settlements, plus waiting until the US and China get along, plus figuring a way to make people psycic, plus the elevation of a prostitute like class, plus a population high enough to make colonizing another solar system worthwile.  I need about 800-1000 years minimum(of course I have yet to see the series) to fit it all in.The movie manage to be realistic enough to make the viewer think it possible, but fictional enough so they realizes it wouldn't.  Also, unlike other sci-fi I've seen there is refreshing simplicity to it.  The crew isn't fighting to save the 'verse.  Rather they merely want to get on with what they do. (that sounds kinda tacky.  It isn't.)  In the three days I had it (rental) I watched the entire thing three times, and every feature including the commentary, the surprisingly entertaining commentary.  I will buy it, making it as the first movie that I buy not as a gift.And above all This movie does not live up to the hype, but to those with an inklink in sci-fi Serenity offers a change from the typical fare.  To those who think sci-fi is a waste, try to borrow it, but don't get your hopes up.  Anime fans please be quiet and whatever you're currently mad about.*A note to this whose friends recommended Serenity: There is a section where Joss literally tells the fans to recommend it like crazy.

It wasn't until much later, when a co-worker was on a high about this movie, that I was told about the stupidity of Fox waiting to air the pilot for the series 'til the last few episodes.  Ah... now I understand why I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a war with all these people who made no sense.  So, having been given the DVD Series by my Browncoat friend for Xmas, I watched it in the order that it was meant to be seen and became a believer.The reason why I don't give this a 5 star rating is purely visceral.  Perhaps it's because I got to know the characters and story in less than a week, then ordered this DVD to find out about all the hanging issues and questions.  Not to give spoilers, let's just say that I hate it when Whedon does what he does - makes you love believable characters, then has believable things happen to them that you don't like.  I'm in mourning for a group of characters I fell in love with, then had the proverbial air kicked out of me in regards to one of my favorite married couple dynamics ever, and the great mystery behind a man that will never be known now.  I was not prepared to have these things happen to people who I'd only met in a marathon session a week earlier.I can't say how this movie will play to those who haven't watched the TV series.  The action, choreography, acting, writing, humor, horror, and so on were all there.  Whedon's slick translation of the idea of who each character is and the universe in general without making those who saw the series feel like, ""Yeah, yeah, already know that, get to the good part,"" was handled well.  Still, somebody not having seen the series probably won't feel the true depths of the pain and turmoil of the characters.  Had I not seen the series, I doubt I would have ended up as upset as I was.  What's more, those who are inspired to buy or rent the DVD series after having seen Serenity will likely have the ultimate fate of some characters hanging heavy over their heads, which would likely take away from enjoying the myriad character dynamics.

951766,AQS0FWGVAQ51C,B000BW7QWW,TigerNightmare,"[11, 11]","Over the years, I've become a huge Joss Whedon fan, for his thoughtfully and intelligently written shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, each filled with gut-busting humor, smart and clever dialogue, involving character development and careful, calculated plotting.  Simply put: the man is a master storyteller.To maximize your enjoyment of Serenity, it is best that you watchFireflyfirst.  Thanks to a brilliantly written introduction, this film is accessible to everyone, but everything is enhanced if you know more about the characters' background and motivation.  Take my advice: if you're thinking about dabbling in this universe, watch the pilot episode of Firefly first.  If you watch it all in order, you will be rewarded handsomely.  With that said, if this advice applies to you and you wish to follow it, please read no further.  The less you know, the better.Serenity takes place about three months after the final episode of Firefly.  Mal is still taking odd jobs, honest or not, in order to keep his crew fed and flying.  The Alliance Parliament desperately wishes to retrieve River once and for all, and so they send an Operative--a cold, intelligent and fearsome warrior, devout in his belief that killing River is the right thing to do.So many story elements meant to give us more time with each character and to flesh out the story more were cut out for the purpose of making a better movie that flowed more naturally.  This movie would've been far more entertaining had it been played out longer the way it was meant to: on TV.  But all that means is that the most entertaining movie of the year could've been better if it was 18 hours long.  A lot of scenes that were cut, you can watch on this edition as well as the previous single-disc DVD.This movie has something for everyone.  It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's unpredictable, it even has a little romance.  What I really love in a story is the ability to surprise me, catching me completely off guard; this movie has that too.  When I first saw it, this major reveal had my jaw on the theater floor when I realized what had happened.Universal should've released this 2-disc set originally instead of what was released before.  While the original DVD was fine and had plenty of extras and very insightful commentary by Joss Whedon, there was still a sense that there could've been more extras.  There isn't a lot of additional features in this set, so I would have to say this set isn't really warranted.  They should've packed on a little more and it gives me pause before giving the set the 5 stars it deserves.  Alone, it deserves it, but as a second set, it should lose one or two.The original features are entertaining to watch again.  The Fruity Oaty Bars bit has been upgraded from easter egg to regular extra.  I get the sense that not a lot of time was spent on producing this set.  They even reuse the same music and graphics for the menus.  The box is nice and shiny, though.  It looks more like it could hold four discs inside.  That would be very, very nice.  It's still a nice set at a reasonable price that fans will buy no matter what and is a good stocking stuffer for someoene who's been wanting to own Serenity.Someone else mentioned that the new features are also found on an Australian 2-disc edition.  What I know is not on that version is the new commentary recorded March 2007 featuring Joss, Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Ron Glass and Summer Glau.  Normally, a cast commentary leaves you with little other than a feeling that your friends are talking over a movie you like, but Joss keeps most of them grounded and there's plenty of laughs and interesting info.  Ron is mostly quiet and Summer is adorably shy, but put on the spot by Joss often enough to get her out of her shell.Here's a quick synopsis of the other new features:A Filmmaker's Journey - Lots of behind the scenes bits.The Green Clan - A short shout out to Jack Green, the brilliant cinematographer of the film, and the involvement of his sons and daughter with shooting and assisting.Extended Scenes - You get the feeling that, if you had the previous disc, you've seen these before.  When you watch them, though, you realize that they're all new.  They aren't stuffed back into the movie, but are a separate feature, as they should be.Take A Walk on Serenity - A cool short with Joss and the cast talking about the new Serenity set and the little differences between the film and the show.Sci-Fi Inside: Serenity - This is just a special that aired on Sci-Fi Channel to promote Serenity before its release in theaters.  The clip of the film at the end has the sound out of sync for some reason.Session 416 - Amazon says these were ""internet pieces"", but I've never seen them before.  They're pieced together and feel like a short film featuring Summer Glau.  Probably the best feature, showing River's sudden transformation from a bright young girl to what we know her as now.",5,Universal should have released only this DVD of the next chapter of

Joss Whedon does some lovely thing with the camerawork and filming to distinguish this from the television medium that he's been working in forever. Of course this movie is better than Star Wars (pick an episode any episode - yeah that's right, this is better than The Empire Strikes Back) if only on dialogue alone (ok, cheap shot, since really Joss Whedon's dialogue can go toe-to-toe with Oscar Wilde and Quentin Tarantino any day. George Lucas isn't even very good by Hollywood action movie standards.) and Yes, you need to see it immediately.Every year there are movies that fly under the radar, either because of poor distribution or audience expectations, yet they are wonderful and worth seeing. In 2003, the movies were 24 Hour Party People and The Believer. The Princess Bride, Heathers, Blade Runner, Office Space and Velvet Goldmine also needed rediscovery after shoddy box office showing. Serenity, bouyed and crippled by its relation to a failed television show, is one of the 2005 great movies that should have done better.(the other one is Mirrormask).The story is fairly simple. The Alliance is after the ship Serenity in order to retrieve River Tam, a modified psychic who knows more than she should, and sends a very sincere operative after the ship. Captain Malcolm Reynolds is torn between throwing her off the ship because of the danger she represents and discovering her secret. The complexity lies in the characters. Every character in the movie is fully realized and believable. Even the minor characters have their moments of interest.The battle sequences are exciting but they are never inserted to support a weak plot, instead they are integral to the storyline. The future world which is part American, part Chinese, mostly post-Civil War, opens up a vista of opportunities for storytelling that one movie can only hint at.Last word: The extras are mostly useless. Joss Whedon's commentary is full of ""ooh look at the pretty shot, isn't my camera guy cool"" moments. The 'making of' shorts are all about how the fans wanted the movie and how they did. However they repeat ""canceled TV show becomes movie, and that's never happened before"" so often that you want to scream ""STAR TREK"" at the screen. The deleted scenes are pretty good, but the outtakes are terrible (and really bloopers are usually only funny to the people in the show). The best extra is the Easter Egg (on the main menu screen, on the right side there's a button for it) with the Oatie Bar commercial complete with a making of and the commerical in toto - which is definitely the strangest commercial ever.",5,The best movie of 2005,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,2704,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'show', 'love', 'movie', 'No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bogged', 'down', 'details', 'Yes', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'lovely', 'thing', 'camerawork', 'filming', 'distinguish', 'television', 'medium', 'been', 'working', 'forever', 'course', 'movie', 'better', 'Star', 'Wars', 'pick', 'episode', 'episode', 'yeah', 'right', 'better', 'Empire', 'Strikes', 'Back', 'only', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'ok', 'cheap', 'shot', 'really', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'dialogue', 'can', 'go', 'toe-to-toe', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'day', 'George', 'Lucas', ""n't"", 'even', 'very', 'good', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movie', 'standards', 'Yes', 'need', 'see', 'immediately.Every', 'year', 'are', 'movies', 'fly', 'radar', 'either', 'poor', 'distribution', 'audience', 'expectations', 'yet', 'are', 'wonderful', 'worth', 'seeing', '2003', 'movies', 'were', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'Believer', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'Heathers', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Office', 'Space', 'Velvet', 'Goldmine', 'also', 'needed', 'rediscovery', 'shoddy', 'box', 'office', 'showing', 'Serenity', 'bouyed', 'crippled', 'relation', 'failed', 'television', 'show', 'one', '2005', 'great', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'one', 'Mirrormask', '.The', 'story', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Alliance', 'ship', 'Serenity', 'order', 'retrieve', 'River', 'Tam', 'modified', 'psychic', 'who', 'more', 'should', 'very', 'sincere', 'operative', 'ship', 'Captain', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'torn', 'throwing', 'ship', 'danger', 'discovering', 'secret', 'complexity', 'characters', 'character', 'movie', 'fully', 'realized', 'believable', 'Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'moments', 'interest.The', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'exciting', 'are', 'never', 'inserted', 'support', 'weak', 'plot', 'instead', 'are', 'integral', 'storyline', 'future', 'world', 'part', 'American', 'part', 'Chinese', 'mostly', 'post-Civil', 'War', 'up', 'vista', 'opportunities', 'storytelling', 'one', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'hint', 'at.Last', 'word', 'extras', 'are', 'mostly', 'useless', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'commentary', 'full', 'ooh', 'look', 'pretty', 'shot', ""n't"", 'camera', 'guy', 'cool', 'moments', ""'making"", 'shorts', 'are', 'how', 'fans', 'wanted', 'movie', 'how', 'did', 'However', 'repeat', 'canceled', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'never', 'happened', 'so', 'often', 'want', 'scream', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'screen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'outtakes', 'are', 'terrible', 'really', 'bloopers', 'are', 'usually', 'only', 'funny', 'people', 'show', 'best', 'extra', 'Easter', 'Egg', 'main', 'menu', 'screen', 'right', 'side', 'button', 'Oatie', 'Bar', 'commercial', 'complete', 'making', 'commerical', 'toto', 'definitely', 'strangest', 'commercial', 'ever']",N/A

Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[7, 8]","If there's anything I'd like to add to all the good things said about this flick, it's that I wish more people would feel as strongly about the basic evil of any attempts to 'improve' human beings as Joss Whedon does. I happen to share this belief 100%, and it made, for me at least, what might just have been a big-screen 2-hour TV episode into a movie that is worthy being called 'great'.Whedon, knowingly or not, may have ingested a hefty dose of R A Heinlein, or someone like him. I say this because the Firefly characters, and especially the ladies, could have jumped straight out of the pages of a Heinlein story. The actresses cast to represent them are gems, each an every one of them, each in their own way. Kick-ass ladies, each naturally possessed of a sharply-drawn and distinct character, who combine intelligence and strength with an edgy sweetness that's never vacuous. I hope the actresses never have the misfortune to become 'stars', for I get the impression that may be the worst thing that could happen to any actress. But I also hope that they will never have to struggle to find work, preferably in roles where they can enchant their audience as much as they have done in Firefly and Serenity.If Whedon has anything else important to say to us-and I have a notion that he isn't done talking by a long way yet-I hope he does it with another visit to the 'verse and in the company of a bunch of folks I really have come to like.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELDAINNA, and a lot more, soon to be published.",5,Serenely superb,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1554,"['anything', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'good', 'things', 'said', 'flick', 'wish', 'more', 'people', 'would', 'feel', 'strongly', 'basic', 'evil', 'attempts', ""'improve"", 'human', 'beings', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'happen', 'share', 'belief', '100', '%', 'made', 'least', 'what', 'might', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'big-screen', '2-hour', 'TV', 'episode', 'movie', 'worthy', 'being', 'called', ""'great'.Whedon"", 'knowingly', 'not', 'may', 'have', 'ingested', 'hefty', 'dose', 'R', 'A', 'Heinlein', 'someone', 'say', 'Firefly', 'characters', 'especially', 'ladies', 'could', 'have', 'jumped', 'straight', 'pages', 'Heinlein', 'story', 'actresses', 'cast', 'represent', 'are', 'gems', 'one', 'own', 'way', 'Kick-ass', 'ladies', 'naturally', 'possessed', 'sharply-drawn', 'distinct', 'character', 'who', 'combine', 'intelligence', 'strength', 'edgy', 'sweetness', 'never', 'vacuous', 'hope', 'actresses', 'never', 'have', 'misfortune', 'become', ""'stars"", 'get', 'impression', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'happen', 'actress', 'also', 'hope', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'struggle', 'find', 'work', 'preferably', 'roles', 'where', 'can', 'enchant', 'audience', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'done', 'Firefly', 'Serenity.If', 'Whedon', 'anything', 'else', 'important', 'say', 'us-and', 'have', 'notion', ""n't"", 'done', 'talking', 'long', 'way', 'yet-I', 'hope', 'visit', ""'verse"", 'company', 'bunch', 'folks', 'really', 'have', 'come', 'like.Till', 'Noever', 'owlglass.com', 'Author', 'KEAEN', 'CONTINUITY', 'SLIP', 'SELDAINNA', 'lot', 'more', 'soon', 'be', 'published']",N/A
951771,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B000BW7QWW,Tom Benton,"[8, 9]","Joss Whedon is one of the most extremely talented people working in the entertainment industry today.  His work on the brilliant television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased Whedon's versatility as both a writer and a director.  That show's spin-off, ANGEL, confirmed that Whedon was anything but a one-hit wonder.  His last series, FIREFLY, proved that he was capable of making most anything excellent.  Unfortunately, that show was cancelled after a mere two months, leading to a huge revolt by angry fans who blamed FOX for the cancellation - and rightly so.  FOX had no advertising campaign for the show, aired it on Fridays (a terrible night for television shows), and showed the episodes out of order.  Now those fans can rejoice: SERENITY, the feature film adaptation of FIREFLY, has arrived.Five hundred years into the future, most planets of the known universe have been colonized and are run by the Alliance, a government which has a strict set of rules intended to make the universe a better, happier place.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), a veteran of a harsh war against the Alliance, commandeers the spaceship ""Serenity"".  His crew consists of old war buddy Zoe (Gina Torres); her husband and the pilot of Serenity, Wash (Alan Tudyk); the ship's kind, lovable engineer Kaylee (Jewel Staite); and tough guy Jayne (Adam Baldwin). The job of Serenity's crew is smuggling, or more often thievery.  The crew gets more than they bargain for when they pick up rich doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his sister, River (Summer Glau).  You see, River is a psychic, and she's being hunted by the Alliance because of something she knows.  Having little luck finding River, the Alliance sends The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a top-notch assassin, to retrieve her.Though it's not essential for one to watch FIREFLY before watching SERENITY, I highly recommend that you do.  For those who decide against it, though, Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of explaining the backstory from the show.  SERENITY opens with a brief explanation of the state of the universe in the future, which Whedon then seamlessly weaves into the storyline.  The sequence in which the characters are introduced is even more brilliant.  Mal Reynolds walks through Serenity, and as he passes each character they engage in conversations just lengthy enough to give us a sense of what each character is like.  In about five minutes, we know and understand each of these characters.  Of course, one gets to know the characters far better while watching FIREFLY.  The fact that the ""companion"" (prostitute) Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer part of Serenity's crew will mean nothing to those who have not seen the show, however it may shock those who have.While FIREFLY was as much a western as it was a science fiction show, SERENITY belongs solely to the science fiction genre.  It's an old-fashioned sci-fi film, and yet it bears little resemblance to any of the genre's previous films.  You see, SERENITY, like all of Joss Whedon's other works, is entirely original.  There is not a cliche in this movie, nor - unlike STAR WARS - is there any clunky dialogue.  On the contrary, Whedon's script is laced with his trademark wit and originality.Another Whedon trademark is realistic characters, and the characters in SERENITY are certainly realistic.  They're heroes, but certainly not in the traditional sense.  This is particularly evident during a confrontation between Mal and The Operative.  ""I want to resolve this like civilized men,"" says The Operative.  ""I'm not threatening you.  I'm unarmed.""  Mal says, ""Good,"" and without a moment's hesitation draws his gun and shoots him.  Despite this, the crew of SERENITY are most definitely heroes.  They fight for what they believe in, no matter the cost.  They are also distinctly human.  In one scene, Mal and Jayne are arguing.  ""Do you wanna run this ship?"" Mal asks.  Jayne replies angrily, ""Yes!""  Mal hestiates, unsure how to reply.  Finally he pipes up and says, ""Well ... you can't!""As far as filmmaking goes, SERENITY is a very impressive piece of work.  The lighting is as realistic as could be.  David Newman's score is good, and at times its excellent, though it's a far cry from Greg Edmonson's popular score from FIREFLY.  Each member of the cast delivers a great performance.  Particularly delightful is Summer Glau, who makes River seem extremely amusing and wildly unpredictable while also making her someone to pity.  Nathan Fillion is also terrific as Mal Reynolds.  His performance is occasionally reminescent of Harrison Ford's in the original STAR WARS.  Mal is very likable, dedicated, and sometimes clever, but he's human just like everyone else.  Chiwetel Ejiofor turns The Operative into an interesting character who never quite comes across as being dislikable; after all, he's just fighting for what he believes in.  Also of note is Adam Baldwin, who is hilarious as the brutish Jayne.  The only real downside of the film is the editing.  Although for the most part it's very good, the editing at the start of the film seems a little choppy and disjointed.There is one moment in particular that I really loved.  The crew of Serenity has stopped at a bar to get the payoff for their last job.  River looks up a television and smiles.  Suddenly, everything turns blindlingly white and there's total silence.  The camera focuses on River as she whispers one word: ""Miranda"".  The camera then follows River's robe as it slides off her body and she walks away.  Then everything returns to normal and River begins kicking butt.SERENITY is Joss Whedon's big-screen directorial debut, and what an impressive one it is.  It's clear that Whedon has a grip on all the attributes of filmmaking.  SERENITY is an original, intelligent, old-fashioned, and just plain fun sci-fi film that will knock FIREFLY fans' socks off.  Non-fans may enjoy it as well, but it's clear that this was designed for those many people who helped turn the complete series set of FIREFLY into one of the best-selling DVD sets of all time.",5,"A

951772,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000BW7QWW,Tom Birkenstock,"[4, 5]","I'll preface this review with the fact that I was a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and over the summer a friend of mine introduced me to the boxed set of Firefly, so I wasn't going into this movie with a blank slate. I will also divulge that I'm a big Joss Whedon fan (except for Alien Resurrection, what the heck?). This review will of course be biased.I'll get through the problems with this film first (there aren't that many). The biggest hurdle that Whedon had in transferring his show into a movie was characterization, and he doesn't quite clear it. There are nine main characters in the show, and how are you going to juggle nine characters in a two hour span when you're used to having years of examining each of their intriguing facet? I have no clue, and apparently neither did Whedon. Whedon's able to differentiate everyone because he's a master of dialogue, but for the uninitiated I don't think the major points of drama in the film will resonate like it will with those who watched the TV show. For those who are familiar with the television show it's really a treat to find out how everything ends(?) (*dun-dunn-dunnn*).As for the rest of the film...it was great! (I was having trouble holding in the inner fanboy). Having a larger budget really allowed Whedon to show what he could do with a bigger brush. I must admit that I was worried Whedon might be too acclimated to television to handle the Big Screen. These worries were thankfully unfounded. Whedon knows how to use action without supplanting the story. There's some good choreography, and he's smart enough of a director to allow the viewers to follow the action instead of substituting quick cuts thinking he'll trick the audience into thinking they're excited. Towards the end the kind of action expands but I never felt I was lost in the spectacle of special effects.This was also a great film for Whedon to showcase his visual talents. With a relatively small budget (I think it was 40 million) he is able to immerse us into a believable and unique world. He is also smart enough to vary the landscape. The viewer is treated to a Hong Kong style city, the familiar border towns, and a place that looks like it came out of Frank Lloyd Wright's imagination.There is a very Whedon feel to this movie. As anyone who has watched Firefly or Buffy knows, when you're watching those shows you feel that not only are you getting to know the characters on screen but the creator behind those characters as well. One of Whedon's great abilities is to make sure the audience is never complacent. For example, the opening consists of a scene where River is being taught at school, but soon we find out that this is going on inside her head and we're really being treated to a scene where her brother Simon is breaking her out of a secret government facility, but wait, this turns out to be merely a surveillance video (hologram?) the villain is watching of their escape. It sounds very clumsy in print, but is used to great effect as the movie's opener. There are plenty of other surprises in the film, but I don't want to spoil anything more.In closing, Firefly fans will probably be more pleased than novices, but whoever you are I guarantee you'll be entertained. Oh, and there's an allusion to ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" and I can't tell you how long I've been waiting to hear that in a science fiction western originating on television.",5,For novices: good; for fans: excellent,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,3415,"[""'ll"", 'preface', 'review', 'fact', 'was', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'fan', 'summer', 'friend', 'mine', 'introduced', 'boxed', 'set', 'Firefly', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'movie', 'blank', 'slate', 'will', 'also', 'divulge', ""'m"", 'big', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fan', 'Alien', 'Resurrection', 'what', 'heck', 'review', 'will', 'course', 'be', 'biased.I', ""'ll"", 'get', 'problems', 'film', 'first', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'biggest', 'hurdle', 'Whedon', 'had', 'transferring', 'show', 'movie', 'was', 'characterization', ""n't"", 'quite', 'clear', 'are', 'nine', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'juggle', 'nine', 'characters', 'two', 'hour', 'span', 'when', ""'re"", 'used', 'having', 'years', 'examining', 'intriguing', 'facet', 'have', 'clue', 'apparently', 'did', 'Whedon', 'Whedon', 'able', 'differentiate', 'everyone', 'master', 'dialogue', 'uninitiated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'major', 'points', 'drama', 'film', 'will', 'resonate', 'will', 'who', 'watched', 'TV', 'show', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'television', 'show', 'really', 'treat', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'everything', '*dun-dunn-dunnn*', '.As', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'having', 'trouble', 'holding', 'inner', 'fanboy', 'Having', 'larger', 'budget', 'really', 'allowed', 'Whedon', 'show', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'bigger', 'brush', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'worried', 'Whedon', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'acclimated', 'television', 'handle', 'Big', 'Screen', 'worries', 'were', 'thankfully', 'unfounded', 'Whedon', 'how', 'use', 'action', 'supplanting', 'story', 'good', 'choreography', 'smart', 'enough', 'director', 'allow', 'viewers', 'follow', 'action', 'instead', 'substituting', 'quick', 'cuts', 'thinking', ""'ll"", 'trick', 'audience', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'excited', 'end', 'kind', 'action', 'expands', 'never', 'felt', 'was', 'lost', 'spectacle', 'special', 'effects.This', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'Whedon', 'showcase', 'visual', 'talents', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'think', 'was', '40', 'million', 'able', 'immerse', 'believable', 'unique', 'world', 'also', 'smart', 'enough', 'vary', 'landscape', 'viewer', 'treated', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'style', 'city', 'familiar', 'border', 'towns', 'place', 'came', 'Frank', 'Lloyd', 'Wright', 'imagination.There', 'very', 'Whedon', 'feel', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Firefly', 'Buffy', 'knows', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'shows', 'feel', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'screen', 'creator', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'Whedon', 'great', 'abilities', 'make', 'sure', 'audience', 'never', 'complacent', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'where', 'River', 'being', 'taught', 'school', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'going', 'head', ""'re"", 'really', 'being', 'treated', 'scene', 'where', 'brother', 'Simon', 'breaking', 'out', 'secret', 'government', 'facility', 'wait', 'out', 'be', 'merely', 'surveillance', 'video', 'hologram', 'villain', 'watching', 'escape', 'very', 'clumsy', 'print', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'movie', 'opener', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'surprises', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'more.In', 'closing', 'Firefly', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'novices', 'are', 'guarantee', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'Oh', 'allusion', 'Rime', 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'hear', 'science', 'fiction', 'western', 'originating', 'television']",N/A

951775,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000BW7QWW,trashcanman,"[345, 378]","If you're already aquainted with the greatness of Joss Whedon's cult television series ""Firefly"" then this is a no-brainer. ""Serenity"" is the best science fiction film since ""The Matrix"" and for true fans of the series, it is a literal dream come true.  Essentially, this film is not so much a stand-alone popcorn affair so much as it is the greatest series finale in history.  It's emotional, funny, action-packed, full of quirky characters both familiar and new, and just plain cool to boot.  There is also a deep philosophical argument explored as the costs of personal freedom and government control are contrasted in a brilliant manner.  Would you choose to live the life of a criminal if it was the only way you could be free?  Does a government have the right to take any step necesssary to keep it's citizens under control and happy?""Half of writing history is covering up the truth"" is just one of the memorable observations made by our heroes over the course of this journey.  The plot centers around insane genius River and her older brother, Simon, who rescued her from a mysterious government facility where she was being experimented on.  Part of the genius of the series (and this film) are the insane rantings of River, which begin to make sense if you pay attention.  ""Old men, covered in blood.  It never touched them but they're drowning in it"" may seem nonsensical to some, but it is a rather poetic yet eerily accurate representation of both the government officials in her universe, and in ours.  The events taking place in this future are vaguely familair as plot devices, but what makes them brilliant is the way they relate to what's happening in our society.  Anyhow, back to the plot: River and Simon joined the crew of Serenity, the ship captained by Malcolm Reynolds, a true hero who isn't afraid to break the rules if it means doing the right thing.  Serenity's crew includes an endearing assortment of contrasting characters that all get their moments to shine in the film: Jayne the hardcore mercenary, Kailee the loveable mechanic, Mal's old war buddy  Zoe, and her pilot/comedian husband Wash are all well represented.  Having left Serenity since the original series, Book the minister and Inara -Malcolm's love interest who happens to be a well-respected prostitute (not to mention unbelievably gorgeous)- turn up along the way as well.The style of the universe that our heroes inhabit is still a mix of all of the cultures of ""Earth-that-was"", primarily american and asian, with cursing in chinese being an amusing device for letting characters express their disapproval realistically and emphatically without getting an ""R"" rating in the process.  If you've never seen ""Firefly"", do not hesitate; go buy it this very moment and see what you've been missing out on, then I can guarantee that this film will blow you away.If you are just looking for a spectacle like ""Star Wars"", legendary action sequences like ""The Matrix"", or just some light sci-fi fare, you will be disappointed.  This movie is both epic and personal, hilarious and heart-breaking, deeply thoughtful yet fun. It represents the fulfillment of a promise from it's creator and is a miracle unto itself that came about simply because the fans refused to let his brilliant creation die just because of a bad decision by a biased television executive.  The story behind the film is almost as uplifting as the film itself and serves to justify those of us who support the things we love, even years after they've ""died"".Not fitting into any particular established pop culture mold -not unlike the characters themselves-, ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" may have flown in under the public's radar, but for those of us who know what great entertainment is capable of, this is the stuff we live for seeing and we're happy to keep it our little secret.",5,A criminally underrated conclusion to a criminally underrated series,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,3840,"[""'re"", 'already', 'aquainted', 'greatness', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'cult', 'television', 'series', 'Firefly', 'then', 'no-brainer', 'Serenity', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Matrix', 'true', 'fans', 'series', 'literal', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Essentially', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'stand-alone', 'popcorn', 'affair', 'so', 'much', 'greatest', 'series', 'finale', 'history', 'emotional', 'funny', 'action-packed', 'full', 'quirky', 'characters', 'familiar', 'new', 'just', 'plain', 'cool', 'boot', 'also', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'argument', 'explored', 'costs', 'personal', 'freedom', 'government', 'control', 'are', 'contrasted', 'brilliant', 'manner', 'Would', 'choose', 'live', 'life', 'criminal', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'be', 'free', 'government', 'have', 'right', 'take', 'step', 'necesssary', 'keep', 'citizens', 'control', 'happy', 'Half', 'writing', 'history', 'covering', 'up', 'truth', 'just', 'one', 'memorable', 'observations', 'made', 'heroes', 'course', 'journey', 'plot', 'centers', 'insane', 'genius', 'River', 'older', 'brother', 'Simon', 'who', 'rescued', 'mysterious', 'government', 'facility', 'where', 'was', 'being', 'experimented', 'Part', 'genius', 'series', 'film', 'are', 'insane', 'rantings', 'River', 'begin', 'make', 'sense', 'pay', 'attention', 'Old', 'men', 'covered', 'blood', 'never', 'touched', ""'re"", 'drowning', 'may', 'seem', 'nonsensical', 'rather', 'poetic', 'yet', 'eerily', 'accurate', 'representation', 'government', 'officials', 'universe', 'ours', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'future', 'are', 'vaguely', 'familair', 'plot', 'devices', 'what', 'brilliant', 'way', 'relate', 'what', 'happening', 'society', 'Anyhow', 'back', 'plot', 'River', 'Simon', 'joined', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'ship', 'captained', 'Malcolm', 'Reynolds', 'true', 'hero', 'who', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'break', 'rules', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Serenity', 'crew', 'endearing', 'assortment', 'contrasting', 'characters', 'get', 'moments', 'shine', 'film', 'Jayne', 'hardcore', 'mercenary', 'Kailee', 'loveable', 'mechanic', 'Mal', 'old', 'war', 'buddy', 'Zoe', 'pilot/comedian', 'husband', 'Wash', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'Having', 'left', 'Serenity', 'original', 'series', 'Book', 'minister', 'Inara', '-Malcolm', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'be', 'well-respected', 'prostitute', 'not', 'mention', 'unbelievably', 'gorgeous', 'turn', 'up', 'way', 'well.The', 'style', 'universe', 'heroes', 'inhabit', 'still', 'mix', 'cultures', 'Earth-that-was', 'primarily', 'american', 'asian', 'cursing', 'chinese', 'being', 'amusing', 'device', 'letting', 'characters', 'express', 'disapproval', 'realistically', 'emphatically', 'getting', 'R', 'rating', 'process', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Firefly', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'go', 'buy', 'very', 'moment', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'missing', 'out', 'then', 'can', 'guarantee', 'film', 'will', 'blow', 'are', 'just', 'looking', 'spectacle', 'Star', 'Wars', 'legendary', 'action', 'sequences', 'Matrix', 'just', 'light', 'sci-fi', 'fare', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'epic', 'personal', 'hilarious', 'heart-breaking', 'deeply', 'thoughtful', 'yet', 'fun', 'fulfillment', 'promise', 'creator', 'miracle', 'came', 'about', 'simply', 'fans', 'refused', 'let', 'brilliant', 'creation', 'die', 'just', 'bad', 'decision', 'biased', 'television', 'executive', 'story', 'film', 'almost', 'as', 'uplifting', 'film', 'justify', 'who', 'support', 'things', 'love', 'even', 'years', ""'ve"", 'died', '.Not', 'fitting', 'particular', 'established', 'pop', 'culture', 'mold', '-not', 'characters', 'themselves-', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'may', 'have', 'flown', 'public', 'radar', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'great', 'entertainment', 'capable', 'stuff', 'live', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'happy', 'keep', 'little', 'secret']",N/A

951777,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000BW7QWW,trebe,"[3, 3]","Created by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Dollhouse), Firefly was a series on FOX that was prematurely cancelled in 2002.  Although 14 episodes of the science fiction adventure were produced, only 11 were aired.  The tale that Whedon had only begun to tell, was not only left hanging, but tossed to the curb like unwanted trash.  If not for Whedon's determination, and the support of a tremendously loyal fan base, Firefly would have gone the way of countless other cancelled shows, appreciated by a few, but soon forgotten and swept into the gutter of TV history.  Thankfully, on the road to obscurity, something truly amazing and wonderful happened, as the series gained a new audience when released on DVD.  Whedon was always determined to finish telling his story, and with the support of Universal Studios, completed a screenplay for the film that would become Serenity.Released in 2005, Serenity is a triumphant return for the crew of the Firefly, and a magnificent achievement on almost all levels.  The film reunites the entire principal cast from the series, and takes quantum leaps forward in the scope of the story, the level of action, and the quality of the special effects.  Within the limits of a feature film, Whedon addresses most of the questions that were left hanging in the TV series.  The movie retains much of the same spirit, but has a darker more deadly serious tone.  Despite budgetary and time constraints, all the critical elements are raised to completely new levels.The focus of the TV series was mostly on the day to day adventures of the crew attempting find jobs and eek out a living.  Serenity however, is mostly about the Alliance's quest to recapture the mysterious River Tam (Summer Glau).  Once a passenger on the spaceship Serenity, the waifish River's importance is tremendously elevated, and her role expanded to include some impressive fight scenes.  Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) also has a larger role, as the crew of Serenity is basically at war with the Alliance, who have sent The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), to lead the attempt to recover River.  Veterans of the Unification War, Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Washburne (Gina Torres) return to a wartime mode, and put their fighting skills to use.  Fillion also has several extended fight sequences.  Pilot Hoban `Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk) shines in the battle sequences in space.  Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) remains a guy you can mostly count on in a fight, while ship's mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite) is still a wiz with gadgets and a spunky fighter.  Unfortunately many scenes between Reynolds and Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin) ended up being cut.  Shepherd Book's (Ron Glass) appearance is brief, but very touching.The backstory of the mysterious Reavers is revealed, when the Serenity arrives at the ghost planet Miranda.  The Reavers play a key role in the climactic finish that ends with a final battle at the headquarters of Mr. Universe (David Krumholtz).  After the Serenity crash lands, the crew prepares for a battle to the death with the Reavers.  The gentlemanly and overly polite Operative, has proven to be a ruthless persecutor, killing anyone that has ever been a friend to the Serenity.  The final act is a montage of mayhem that begins with a battle in space, then features the crew battling the zombie-like Reavers, and sustaining major injuries.  Down below in the generator room, Mal is tangling with The Operative, and manages to leave him speechless.  With most everyone injured, River engages the enemy alone, in a bloody ballet of death.The special effects heavy Serenity, looks absolutely fabulous on Blu-ray.  The special features are prodigious, with several exclusive to the 2008 Blu-ray.  Joss Whedon's presence is extensive, as he provides a solo commentary, and one with members of the cast recorded in 2007, that can also be viewed as inserted video onscreen.  Whedon discusses why the deleted scenes were cut, as well as many of the other decisions he made regarding the plot, and why not all the characters survive.With Whedon's focus clearly on telling a story galactic in scope, certain sacrifices had to be made, and Serenity is mostly a tale of war, with scant time for romance.  While the film may not totally satisfy the desires of all hardcore fans, it does a very good job of covering most of the high points, and winding up most of the loose ends, as Whedon was not counting on doing another sequel.  As over five years have passed, it seems that he made a wise choice.  Predictably, the cast are all fabulous, particularly Nathan Fillion (Castle) and Summer Glau (Terminator: The Sara Connor Chronicles).  Serenity is a straight ahead action/adventure where the nuances included for the fans, still allow for it to be enjoyed by those who have never seen Firefly.  It's science fiction that is done right, not dumbed down for the masses.",5,where are you hiding little girl?,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",2011,4893,"['Created', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Buffy', 'Dollhouse',

As if aware that this probably was a last shot deal, Joss Whedon manages to provide a genuinely satisfying finale to the dominant plot-thread of the series that leaves just enough of an opening for further adventures if the DVD sales pick up. But beyond that, he takes some surprising chances, particularly his willingness to kill off key cast members (one of the few areas where seeing the TV series actually is necessary: without their backstories it's unlikely their genuinely unexpected deaths would be quite so affecting), providing a sci-fi movie that's not just sassy and funny but also surprisingly touching as well. Certainly in the film's final moments you get a real sense that this has been made with real love for the characters and the setting rather than by focus groups and merchandizing arms, something long missing from sci-fi movies: the final lines could just as easily apply to the film's box-office rivals as they do to the Serenity.Some of the regular cast members do tend to get sidelined, it's true, but never to the extent that you feel cheated - not least because it avoids the Star Trek movies trap of adding redundant big scenes for each of the fan favorites to lure them back. And in Chiwetel  Ejiofor's Operative, very much a logical evolution of Richard Brook's calmly pathological bounty hunter in the Firefly episode Objects in Space, he creates an intriguing villain, a true believer with a coldly rational mind, regarding himself as a necessary and monstrous evil creating a world without sin in which he will have no place.The setpieces are both fun and ingenious (not least the way they manage to break through the bad guys' blockade) but not without consequences, and the big secret at the heart of the conspiracy actually makes sense. The only slight minus was the addition of sound effects to the space sequences, when their appropriately silent small screen equivalents seemed so much more novel and memorable.

I am a fan of sci-fi films, however, and I happened to notice many positive reviews about `Serenity,' so I gave it a try.It is a pleasant surprise because the film is so good. Characters are lively, the dialogues are snappy and occasionally funny, and the film's story is intriguing. The special effects are very good (though some still need improvement), but what is remarkable about the film is the wits of the creator Joss Whedon who manages to keep telling this good, old Western-like adventure tale without making it too serious or self-referential.In short, this is what a good action film should be, and you can enjoy watching it without knowing anything about the history of the production. The film is about the crew of one spaceship in the future, and one ruthless `Alliance Operative' (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Kinky Boots"") chases them, trying to retrieve a mysterious girl named River. The back story of the future world and the characters are cleverly explained in the opening, so you don't have to read long subtitles to understand them.Like many other TV series that are loved by us for generations, ""Serenity"" presents the credible relations between the flawed but likable characters through a series of slightly episodic actions, and those relations are what really matters. Unfortunately, 2 hours are not enough for full character development, and some of them need more time for that.

For me that comes in the form of Jewel Staite ;-) and the rest of the cast of 'Serenity'This is the film continuation of the sci-fi cult show 'Firefly' as it loosely picks up where the show left of and takes on an epic adventure. Joss Whedon obviously had something here as he gathered his cast of space cowboys back for one last ride. A ride that leads to secrets revealed, fan satisfactions given and a few unexpected and saddening twists all for the soul purpose of giving this original fan favorite epic the proper send off that it deserved.This is definitely up there for me among sci-fi cult classics like 'The Fifth Element' 'Tron' and 'Akira' a film that is rich in character development and story and keeps you entertained from beginning to end.

The cancellation of Firefly, an incredible series, was one of the most frustrating and cruel decisions ever made by network.  Fabulous acting, great stories, many questions unanswered - and then the rug pulled out before they were finished.But because the fans demanded it, eventually Whedon's miracle arrived, and a movie was made.  We could attribute this to the powers of love and belief, both explicit themes in the movie.A movie is not the same as a television series.  A movie needs more scope, so instead of the ragtag group of individuals trying to scavenge a living and survive without being detected, which was part of the charm of the series, we get to watch them fighting, essentially, two armies.  Devoted fans may also not need some of the exposition.Some little things that I love about both the series and the movie is the use of language.  The dialogue is fantastic: witty, funny, sometimes very apt.  Whedon, like Humpty-Dumpty, is a master of the words he uses, bending them to his will. There's ""shiny"" and ""companion"" and ""nethers"".  And perhaps, my favorite, the use of the word ""'verse"" to mean ""universe"" - but which of course also has the poetical meaning of the story.Not all the threads left hanging from the series are tied up, but many of them are.  We learn a lot more about River.  We resolve the relationship between Simon and Kaylee.  Mal recovers his belief system.  We have a more sensible explanation for Reavers.  We don't get the background on Inara or Shepherd Book, but at least with the latter he says he's not going to give his life story.The movie starts and ends with discussions of love.  We first learn the love that Simon has for his sister, recognized by, of all people, the movie's main antagonist, the nameless operative.  The nameless operative also understands the power of belief.  The operative is therefore in a better position than Mal at the movie's beginning.  However, the operative is too committed to unquestioning belief and because of this he does things that he admits make him a monster.  Mal, during the movie, also learns to believe again - but his commitment to this is based on a more thorough investigation.  There's a wonderful exchange, in which the nameless operative asks Mal if he is ready to die for his beliefs.  Mal says, ""Yes - but that ain't exactly Plan A.""I do have some quibbles.  Jewel Staite lost the 20 lbs that she gained for her original stint as Kaylee.  Perhaps she's more beautiful without the 20 lbs, but she no longer feels like Kaylee.  And although I can imagine Kaylee and Simon getting together - they're both good people - they really don't feel like a good match.  Also, there seems to be no resolution to Jayne's story.  He finally gets to be considered a genuine hero and perhaps that should have been acknowledged.Nevertheless a wonderful movie and a tribute to the faith of the fans and Firefly's creators.",5,The power of belief,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,3037,"['Have', 'ever', 'started', 'fabulous', 'book', 'engaging', 'well-written', 'then', 'have', 'disappear', 'could', 'finish', 'reading', 'cancellation', 'Firefly', 'incredible', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'frustrating', 'cruel', 'decisions', 'ever', 'made', 'network', 'Fabulous', 'acting', 'great', 'stories', 'many', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'then', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'were', 'finished.But', 'fans', 'demanded', 'eventually', 'Whedon', 'miracle', 'arrived', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'could', 'attribute', 'powers', 'love', 'belief', 'explicit', 'themes', 'movie.A', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'television', 'series', 'movie', 'more', 'scope', 'instead', 'ragtag', 'group', 'individuals', 'trying', 'scavenge', 'living', 'survive', 'being', 'detected', 'was', 'part', 'charm', 'series', 'get', 'watch', 'fighting', 'essentially', 'two', 'armies', 'Devoted', 'fans', 'may', 'also', 'not', 'need', 'exposition.Some', 'little', 'things', 'love', 'series', 'movie', 'use', 'language', 'dialogue', 'fantastic', 'witty', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'very', 'apt', 'Whedon', 'Humpty-Dumpty', 'master', 'words', 'bending', 'will', 'shiny', 'companion', 'nethers', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'use', 'word', ""'verse"", 'mean', 'universe', 'course', 'also', 'poetical', 'meaning', 'story.Not', 'threads', 'left', 'hanging', 'series', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'many', 'are', 'learn', 'lot', 'more', 'River', 'resolve', 'relationship', 'Simon', 'Kaylee', 'Mal', 'belief', 'system', 'have', 'more', 'sensible', 'explanation', 'Reavers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'background', 'Inara', 'Shepherd', 'Book', 'least', 'latter', 'not', 'going', 'give', 'life', 'story.The', 'movie', 'starts', 'discussions', 'love', 'first', 'learn', 'love', 'Simon', 'sister', 'recognized', 'people', 'movie', 'main', 'antagonist', 'nameless', 'operative', 'nameless', 'operative', 'also', 'power', 'belief', 'operative', 'therefore', 'better', 'position', 'Mal', 'movie', 'beginning', 'However', 'operative', 'too', 'committed', 'unquestioning', 'belief', 'things', 'make', 'monster', 'Mal', 'movie', 'also', 'believe', 'again', 'commitment', 'based', 'more', 'thorough', 'investigation', 'wonderful', 'exchange', 'nameless', 'operative', 'asks', 'Mal', 'ready', 'die', 'beliefs', 'Mal', 'Yes', 'ai', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Plan', 'A', 'do', 'have', 'quibbles', 'Jewel', 'Staite', 'lost', '20', 'lbs', 'gained', 'original', 'stint', 'Kaylee', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'beautiful', '20', 'lbs', 'no', 'longer', 'feels', 'Kaylee', 'can', 'imagine', 'Kaylee', 'Simon', 'getting', 'together', ""'re"", 'good', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'match', 'Also', 'be', 'resolution', 'Jayne', 'story', 'finally', 'be', 'considered', 'genuine', 'hero', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'acknowledged.Nevertheless', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'tribute', 'faith', 'fans', 'Firefly', 'creators']",N/A

951810,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000BW7QWW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[26, 29]","Translating a cult TV show to the big screen is often tricky business. Even with a heavyweight director like Robert Wise ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" did well at the box office critically the film became the Titanic with its long ponderous shots of V'Ger and the long lingering affectionate gaze at the Enterprise. Few TV properties truly make the jump to the big screen well so I was surprised and elated that ""Serenity"" Joss Whedon's (""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"") film extension of his TV show ""Firefly"" actually was very good. Fans of the show turned out in droves and critically it was a success but the theater seats were empty for most of its showings. That's too bad because Whedon does a nice job of giving a backstory to nonfans and still manages to capture the flavor of the TV show.Set centuries in the future the transport vessel Serenity commanded by Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion who comes the closest to channeling the spirit of Han Solo since Harrison Ford) is smuggling more than contraband-they're carrying a River Tam (Summer Glau) who has been altered by the government to become a brilliant killing machine and they want her back. Her brother Simon (Sean Maher) fakes his way into the facility where she's being kept and rescues her he spirits her off in the Serenity. The Alliance sends a nasty operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who will stop at nothing to obtain River including murdering anyone who stands in his way not just because of what she can do but also because of what she knows about illicit experiments the Alliance has been conducting since its formation. Mal bonded with Zoe (Gina Torres), her husband and pilot of the Serenity Walsh (Alan Tudyk), engineer Kaylee (Jewel Straite) and Jayne (Adam Baldwin) during the Brown Coat War for independence (Whedon was inspired to create the backstory for ""Firefly"" from the conflict during the Civil War and other incidents in U.S. history) Unfortunately, the pursuit of the Alliance puts the crew of Serenity at odds with River and Simon and they begin to wear out their welcome.Featuring a stellar cast, ""Serenity"" is a rarity in that it makes the transition to the big screen effortlessly and Whedon manages to clue in those who didn't follow the series with a breathtaking opening sequence that illustrates things fans were told had occurred during the first season but never saw. I suppose ""Firefly"" fans can satisfy themselves with the fact that they got their movie which essentially crams the story arc Whedon had planned for the second season into a two hour feature film. Sadly, the film stiffed at the box office despite a terrific campaign by Universal to attract both the hardcore Brown coat audience (so called because of the colors Mal's troops wore during the Civil War with the Alliance). It's unlikely we'll see another ""Firefly"" TV show or movie. Since Whedon wraps things up but also leaves the door open the film manages to work both ways for fans by providing closure to one of the main story points of the first season and opening up possibilities (which no doubt will continue in novels and comic books) for further adventures. ""Serenity"" manages to be that rare thing in science fiction films; a kick-ass adventure with some thought behind it. While some of the plot points that are revealed in ""Serenity"" are a bit predictable the film manages to combine the best elements of space opera and science fiction to create valentine for fans of the show.""Serenity"" looks extremely good on this DVD with the original theatrical presentation of the film well represented. The colors are vivid and bright where appropriate and the clarity of the image exceedingly good. The one area that this transfer could improve is to eliminate the edge enhancement that appears in some of the high contrast sequence action sequences shot for the film. The 5.1 Dolby Digital presentation of the film nicely captures the active soundtrack from the theatrical exhibit of the film. Dialogue comes across crisp and clear while action sequences don't have the compressed muddy sound that I've seen in some recent releases.While the film looks and sounds very good, the extras leave a lot to be desired which makes me suspect Universal will be re-releasing this in a double dip edition later next year. I don't have news but I suspect the sales of this set will determine if an enhanced edition comes out next year (or perhaps Universal is holding that for the Blu-Ray edition that is no doubt in preparation for next year). We get three featurettes on the series the best of which ""Future History: The Story of Earth That Was"" clocks in at around 5 minutes. Whedon talks to the camera here explaining how he came up with the concept for the show. ""What's in a Firefly"" focuses on the optical effects with Whedon and members of the visual effects team discussing how they conceived some of the best visual sequences. ""Relighting the Firefly"" is the longest of the three at about 10 minutes and covers the resurrection of the show from the graveyard of cancelled TV shows. ***CAUTION THERE IS A SPOILER AHEAD ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FILM AHEAD. SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM***While each featurette is of solid quality Universal should and could have done a separately disc of extras covering everything from what made it into the movie that was planned for the non-existent second season to Whedon's controversial decision to eliminate some of the major cast members for this film.Whedon's chatty commentary definitely ranks as the highlight of the extras included for me. The discussion of his thought process behind the film's plot and how he tied in various points from the series was refreshingly frank and fascinating to listen to. Whedon's impish sense of humor also gets a nice airing in his discussion on making the film.While the fact that this is truly the end of the ""Firefly"" saga will be a bitter pill for fans to swallow, Whedon delivers a truly stunning valentine with ""Serenity"" channeling the major plot points for a planned second season that never materialized. The image quality and transfer of ""Serenity"" is quite good but the extras a bit disappointing particularly compared to many lesser films that receive a DVD release. Whedon's commentary remains a highlight of this set. Definitely worth buying if you're a fan of the series although I'd suggest nonfans who haven't seen the TV show might want to rent some of the first season DVD boxed set to get a sense of the flavor of the show before buying.",5,"Closure for ""Firefly"" fans",1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,6537,"['Translating', 'cult', 'TV', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'often', 'tricky', 'business', 'Even',

951812,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000BW7QWW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[12, 12]","""Like Star Wars if everyone were Han Solo.""  That was how a friend of mine described Joss Whedon's Firefly and Serenity to me a couple months ago before loaning me the DVD's.  And his description was pretty accurate, but it comes nowhere near doing this classic slice of pop culture justice.  While it's well known by now that Firefly was cancelled before its time, Serenity translates the genre-bending comedic action-sci-fi-western hybrid of the show to the cinematic medium, and brilliantly at that.  Serenity is a great movie by virtually any standard, but it's precisely great movies like this one (and Bubba Ho-Tep, and Shaun of the Dead, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, etc.) that are generally denied the recognition they deserve.  It's not flashy or pandering enough for mainstream appeal, and not pretentious or self-important enough for the Oscar crowd.  However, while it's not AN IMPORTANT MOVIE like Million Dollar Baby or Brokeback Mountain (neither of which I've seen, and I intend to keep it that way), Serenity is a fast-paced, funny, and beautifully-filmed watch whose economical dialogue and plentiful action make its two-hour running time feel more like one.Serenity manages to both pick up where Firefly left off and fill in some more of the backstory, continuing to follow the crew of the Serenity--tough-guy captain and former rebel officer Mal Reynolds; the husband-and-wife combo of devil-may-care pilot Hoban Washburn and no-nonsense first mate Zoe; brutish, self-interested warrior Jayne Cobb; cute, tomboyish mechanic Kaylee Frye; smoking-hot companion (aka high-class call girl) Inara Serra; and trauma surgeon Simon Tam and his psychic sister River--around the outer reaches of known space as they try to find work while steering clear of the fascistic Alliance authorities and cannibalistic Reavers.  One might think there would be some compromises to be made in bringing a beloved cult show to the big screen, but with Whedon on board as both writer and director, that's not a problem here.  The conversion to the new format provides Serenity with the nifty effects and grandiosity befitting its status as a modern space opera, but without compromising any of the wit, intimacy, and heart that made Firefly a great show (one might be tempted to note in passing that it was precisely these qualities that George Lucas's mega-budgeted Star Wars prequels largely lacked, but I won't).  The movie is somewhat darker, more violent, and more plot-oriented than the show, but it's all for a good cause, as Serenity goes a long way toward resolving several of Firefly's main plot strands, most notably the origins of the Reavers and River's importance to the Alliance.While it was already well-established that River was a tormented psychic super-genius, the movie reveals the true extent of her abilities early on when she cuts a deadly swath through the patrons of a crowded bar with some martial-arts moves that would make Bruce Lee blush.  It's no surprise, then, when the crew of the Serenity finds itself pursued by a sword-wielding operative dispatched to hunt down River and eliminate anyone in his way.  In the only major role created solely for the movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor (cool name) is creepily effective as the nameless operative, whose ruthlessly calculating demeanor and considerable skills in the deadly arts are matched by his singleminded, unreflecting devotion to his cause.  Ironically enough, the movie also sees Mal's wartime idealism, previously submerged beneath the hardnosed, me-and-mine-first pragmatism necessitated by his postwar career, starting to reemerge as the extent of the Alliance's perfidies comes into clearer focus.  I'll readily admit that I'm a sucker for plots that pit the little guys against the forces of an oppressive, faceless government, but even so Serenity's conception of heroism and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds should resonate with pretty much anybody.Even better, Serenity ends on a rather open note, leaving plenty of room for another installment.  Granted, this movie didn't exactly set the box office on fire, but given the brisk DVD sales anything's possible.  I for one wouldn't mind seeing another western-themed comedic space opera from Whedon, but in any case Serenity's classic status is guaranteed.  I for one found this to be easily one of the most intelligent, original, and entertaining movies of the decade.  5 stars for sure.",5,"""If you can't do something smart, do something right.""",1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,4440,"['Star', 'Wars', 'everyone', 'were', 'Han', 'Solo', 'was', 'how', 'friend', 'mine', 'described', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'Firefly', 'Serenity', 'couple', 'months', 'loaning', 'DVD', 'description', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'nowhere', 'near', 'doing', 'classic', 'slice', 'pop', 'culture', 'justice', 'well', 'known', 'now', 'Firefly', 'was', 'cancelled', 'time', 'Serenity', 'genre-bending', 'comedic', 'action-sci-fi-western', 'hybrid', 'show', 'cinematic', 'medium', 'brilliantly', 'Serenity', 'great', 'movie', 'virtually', 'standard', 'precisely', 'great', 'movies', 'one', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'etc', 'are', 'generally', 'denied', 'recognition', 'deserve', 'not', 'flashy', 'pandering', 'enough', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'not', 'pretentious', 'self-important', 'enough', 'Oscar', 'crowd', 'However', 'not', 'AN', 'IMPORTANT', 'MOVIE', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'intend', 'keep', 'way', 'Serenity', 'fast-paced', 'funny', 'beautifully-filmed', 'watch', 'economical', 'dialogue', 'plentiful', 'action', 'make', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'feel', 'more', 'one.Serenity', 'manages', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'Firefly', 'left', 'off', 'fill', 'more', 'backstory', 'continuing', 'follow', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'tough-guy', 'captain', 'former', 'rebel', 'officer', 'Mal', 'Reynolds', 'husband-and-wife', 'combo', 'devil-may-care', 'pilot', 'Hoban', 'Washburn', 'no-nonsense', 'first', 'mate', 'Zoe', 'brutish', 'self-interested', 'warrior', 'Jayne', 'Cobb', 'cute', 'tomboyish', 'mechanic', 'Kaylee', 'Frye', 'smoking-hot', 'companion', 'aka', 'high-class', 'call', 'girl', 'Inara', 'Serra', 'trauma', 'surgeon', 'Simon', 'Tam', 'psychic', 'sister', 'River', 'outer', 'known', 'space', 'try', 'find', 'work', 'steering', 'clear', 'fascistic', 'Alliance', 'authorities', 'cannibalistic', 'Reavers', 'One', 'might', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'compromises', 'be', 'made', 'bringing', 'beloved', 'cult', 'show', 'big', 'screen', 'Whedon', 'board', 'writer', 'director', 'not', 'problem', 'here', 'conversion', 'new', 'format', 'Serenity', 'nifty', 'effects', 'grandiosity', 'befitting', 'status', 'modern', 'space', 'opera', 'compromising', 'wit', 'intimacy', 'heart', 'made', 'Firefly', 'great', 'show', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'note', 'passing', 'was', 'precisely', 'qualities', 'George', 'Lucas', 'mega-budgeted', 'Star', 'Wars', 'largely', 'lacked', 'wo', ""n't"", 'movie', 'somewhat', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'more', 'plot-oriented', 'show', 'good', 'cause', 'Serenity', 'long', 'way', 'resolving', 'several', 'Firefly', 'main', 'plot', 'strands', 'most', 'notably', 'origins', 'Reavers', 'River', 'importance', 'Alliance.While', 'was', 'already', 'well-established', 'River', 'was', 'tormented', 'psychic', 'super-genius', 'movie', 'true', 'extent', 'abilities', 'early', 'when', 'deadly', 'swath', 'patrons', 'crowded', 'bar', 'martial-arts', 'moves', 'would', 'make', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'blush', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'crew', 'Serenity', 'pursued', 'sword-wielding', 'operative', 'dispatched', 'hunt', 'down', 'River', 'eliminate', 'anyone', 'way', 'only', 'major', 'role', 'created', 'solely', 'movie', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'cool', 'name', 'creepily', 'effective', 'nameless', 'operative', 'ruthlessly', 'calculating', 'demeanor', 'considerable', 'skills', 'deadly', 'arts', 'are', 'matched', 'singleminded', 'unreflecting', 'devotion', 'cause', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'movie', 'also', 'Mal', 'wartime', 'idealism', 'previously', 'submerged', 'beneath', 'hardnosed', 'me-and-mine-first', 'pragmatism', 'necessitated', 'postwar', 'career', 'starting', 'reemerge', 'extent', 'Alliance', 'perfidies', 'clearer', 'focus', ""'ll"", 'readily', 'admit', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'plots', 'pit', 'little', 'guys', 'forces', 'oppressive', 'faceless', 'government', 'even', 'Serenity', 'conception', 'heroism', 'bravery', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'should', 'resonate', 'pretty', 'much', 'anybody.Even', 'better', 'Serenity', 'rather', 'open', 'note', 'leaving', 'plenty', 'room', 'installment', 'Granted', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'set', 'box', 'office', 'fire', 'given', 'brisk', 'DVD', 'sales', 'anything', 'possible', 'one', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'western-themed', 'comedic', 'space', 'opera', 'Whedon', 'case', 'Serenity', 'classic', 'status', 'guaranteed', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'original', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'decade', '5', 'stars', 'sure']",N/A

The buzz and sales of the DVD were good enough to get studio execs to not only listen but to let Whedon do the show his way.  Welcome to Serenity.Serenity is the name of the ship our heroes are gallivanting the galaxy in.  Heroes is almost too strong a word as we see that they are a bunch of outlaws.  Like most westerns though (that's right western), the good guys are in a shade of grey.  Self preservation and profit tops their priorities, but when the chips are down Mal, the captain, and his crew cannot help but to do the right thing.What makes this movie truly great is not the plot (although a very high point), but the characters.  You truly grow to love the characters and the relationships they have with each other.  The sexual tension between the characters, most fans of the series are already familiar with, is made apparent without flat out telling the audience that it is supposed to be there.  The characters fall back into their roles from the series effortlessly, and it is obvious that they have worked with each other a lot.  The characters are not one dimensional, they have complex reasons for what they do and you get to see them weighing their options on screen.  The crew reacts not as individuals, but as family.  Which is exactly what you would get with a small group of people in such proximity for such a long time.Now on to the plot.  The story centers around the character of River (Summer Glaus), a telepath that was made that way by the alliance, the governing body of the solar system.  Her brother, Simon, breaks her out of the hospital where the alliance is performing the experiments.  The TV show, Firefly started at this point.  The movie starts at a much later point after Simon and River have been on the ship for about a year.  The alliance is out to silence River and whatever government secrets she may know.The story was the easy part and could be redone in any number of action movies, but the relationship that the characters have with each other make this a marvel.  The dialogue is fresh and funny.  The graphics are clean and beautiful.  This movie has been deemed the new Star Wars and for good reasons.  This is the Movie that Lucas wanted episode III to be, this is the chemistry that was absent between Padme and Anakin.  Serenity is the torch bearer for all new science fiction.

951820,ASZEK2N0EYMXG,B000BW7QWW,"Willy Boy ""Willy Boy""","[4, 6]","Based on the incredible Amazon reviews I bought both the Firefly series (also 5 stars) and the Serenity movie.  I watched the movie first and then the series though it really doesn't matter in what order they are viewed.  As I stated in my comments for the Firefly Series DVD, I think the concept is great.  While it is a retread of the 'ole sci fi western (ala Star Wars), just because a story has been told before doesn't mean it isn't worth watching again.  The manner in which Mr. Whedon weaves his story is amazing and quite engaging.Having said that, I became very curious as to whether we have seen the last of Serenity/Firefly.  Here is where the bad news comes in.  In an interview of Mr. Whedon before the movie Serenity was resleased an insightful fan asked him if we would see more of this storyline after the movie (e.g., a reincarnation of the tv series, a mini-serieis or a sequal to the movie).  Mr. Whedon replied as follows ""Hard to say. The Movie has to be a hit before these questions become relevant.""I decided to do some research to see if the movie was a ""hit"".  According to rottentomateos.com:Serenity'sBox Office Total: $25,335,935Box Office Opening: $10,086,680No. of Weeks in Top 10: 2Highest Ranking: 2VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARYVHS Rentals Total: $5,320,000VHS Rentals Opening: $1,640,000Highest Ranking: 25This was described as ""modest"" and ""not quite meeting the expectations of the producers"" by other web sites.Not giving up hope, I decided to see what type of numbers warrants a sequal.  I chose Underworld since the sequal to that movie is opening soon.  Now, if you have not seen the original Underworld, let me just say ... it sucks.  Other than a hot lead actress and some interesting visuals, the plot stank and the acting was subpar.  Unless you are a horny 13 year old male the movie does not warrant more than a half star.Having said that the movie did well enough to warrant a sequal: Underworld 2 Evolution.  So I checked on the numbers for Underworld to see if we had any hope of a Serenity sequal.  According to rottentomatoes.com (which gave the movie a ""ROTTEN"" grade):BOX OFFICE SUMMARYBox Office Total: $51,483,949Box Office Opening: $21,753,759No. of Weeks at #1: 1No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3VHS RENTALS REVENUE SUMMARYVHS Rentals Total: $3,600,000VHS Rentals Opening: $1,340,000No. of Weeks in Top 10: 3Highest Ranking: 5What can I add?  The numbers speak for themselves.  A sequal to Serenity which deserves more attention will probably never happen, while I am anticipating an Underworld 3, 4, and 5 ... at least.

Halfway through the movie, I hit pause and logged on to Amazon to see if there was more...and there was. After seeing Serenity, I am now purchasing the whole Firefly series.Serenity is character driven sci-fi that is light (in a good way) on special effects, and heavy on story. A great aspect of the movie is that you never know what is going to happen next.The crew of Serenity is filled with real people, with flaws, but they are very lovable. There is a degree of bickering between the crew, but it is done is a very believable way. It comes off as the arguments you had as a child with your siblings: you disagreed, but at the end of the day you still cared for one another, and had each other's back.Something not often mentioned in these reviews is the fact that the show's cast is well put together. Not only do they work well together, but each has a very unique screen presence that only fortifies the story.My heart is saddened, as a new fan to the Firefly universe, that this is the end. This show should never have been cancelled.If you are a sci-fi fan, checking out Serenity is a must. But you have been warned: once you see the movie, be prepared to spend $50 on purchasing the Serenity and Firely series DVDs.Total Score (out of 100) = 8846 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

After renting and watching it, I promptly bought both it and the Firefly series. Yes, it's that good.The movie briefly recaps the most important aspects of the series' characters, and proceeds to a rather fantastic conclusion. The plot is unique, full of twists, and memorable. The characters are distinct and superbly acted- in my opinion, one of the best performances in sci-fi to date. You needn't have seen any of the series episodes to understand or appreciate the film, but watching them either before or after the movie does help. If you've seen the series, Serenity brings it to a pretty solid conclusion (there's a bit of room for continuation, but it does have the taste of a finale). If you haven't, this will likely convince you to do so (and you should, the series is also excellent). Visual effects are on par with current sci-fi films, and this looks like a movie theater quality production even though it wasn't shown at any to the best of my knowledge.The only regret I have about Serenity is that it was prematurely cut as a series. I'd never heard of Firefly before (and most everyone I've mentioned it to hasn't), so perhaps it was a result of bad marketing. Hopefully this movie will get someone to make more episodes of the series, since there's clearly a lot of leeway in terms of plot time between the first season finale and the movie. The universe Whedon created here is truly a feat of the imagination, and it would be a shame to leave it.",5,One of the better sci-fi films around,1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,1529,"['first', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Serenity', 'was', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'renting', 'watching', 'promptly', 'bought', 'Firefly', 'series', 'Yes', 'good.The', 'movie', 'briefly', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'series', 'characters', 'proceeds', 'rather', 'fantastic', 'conclusion', 'plot', 'unique', 'full', 'twists', 'memorable', 'characters', 'are', 'distinct', 'superbly', 'acted-', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'sci-fi', 'date', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'film', 'watching', 'movie', 'help', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'Serenity', 'pretty', 'solid', 'conclusion', 'bit', 'room', 'continuation', 'have', 'taste', 'finale', 'have', ""n't"", 'will', 'likely', 'convince', 'do', 'so', 'should', 'series', 'also', 'excellent', 'Visual', 'effects', 'are', 'par', 'current', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'movie', 'theater', 'quality', 'production', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'shown', 'best', 'knowledge.The', 'only', 'have', 'Serenity', 'was', 'prematurely', 'cut', 'series', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Firefly', 'most', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', ""n't"", 'so', 'perhaps', 'was', 'result', 'bad', 'marketing', 'Hopefully', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'someone', 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'series', 'clearly', 'lot', 'leeway', 'terms', 'plot', 'time', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'movie', 'universe', 'Whedon', 'created', 'here', 'truly', 'feat', 'imagination', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'leave']",N/A
951836,AP3B615GM191G,B000BW7QWW,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","While watching the ""Firefly"" TV series, I was only so-so about the show after the first couple episodes.  Then it started growing on me and by the end I was really drawn into the characters.  That is the same basic pattern, ironically enough, for this follow-up movie ""Serenity""...starting up slow but building momentum with every passing scene.For a basic plot summary, ""Serenity"" sees Mal (Nathan Fillion) and his crew ""still flying"".  The focus this time is on River Tam (Summer Glau), who is being pursued by an operative of the Alliance (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  Along the way, Mal & Co. have in a few rough scrapes, learn much more about the psychotic Revers, and ultimately make a decision that will define their overall mission.Half-way through ""Serenity"", I was thoroughly unimpressed and thinking a 2-star review would be in order.  The characters seemed different from where the TV show left off and I was having a difficult time meshing the two things together.  Of course, Joss Whedon was given a very difficult assignment here by having to introduce a new audience to already-established characters.  So, for more season ""Firefly"" viewers, the first hour seems a bit disjointed and strange.The last 45 minutes or so, though, are truly incredible and showcase everything that is good about the entire ""Firefly"" concept.  The characters come together and begin interacting as a team again, the humor is at the right pitch, and the gritty nature of the future is never more apparent.  What was very much a middling effort is turned into a great cinematic experience in the span of just under an hour.Though ""Firefly"" was never given a true send-off from FOX (instead being cancelled just when it seemed things were getting good), ""Serenity"" provides a very nice coda to such a well-written, well-imagined series.  The character ""re-development"" is a bit strange, but once things settle down this flick tells one of the better ""Firefly"" stories in the show's canon.",4,A Microcosm Of The Series Itself,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",2013,1970,"['watching', 'Firefly', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'so-so', 'show', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Then', 'started', 'growing', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'drawn', 'characters', 'same', 'basic', 'pattern', 'ironically', 'enough', 'follow-up', 'movie', 'Serenity', 'starting', 'up', 'slow', 'building', 'momentum', 'passing', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Serenity', 'sees', 'Mal', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'crew', 'still', 'flying', 'focus', 'time', 'River', 'Tam', 'Summer', 'Glau', 'who', 'being', 'pursued', 'operative', 'Alliance', 'Chiwetel', 'Ejiofor', 'way', 'Mal', 'Co.', 'have', 'few', 'rough', 'scrapes', 'learn', 'much', 'more', 'psychotic', 'Revers', 'ultimately', 'make', 'decision', 'will', 'define', 'overall', 'mission.Half-way', 'Serenity', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'unimpressed', 'thinking', '2-star', 'review', 'would', 'be', 'order', 'characters', 'seemed', 'different', 'where', 'TV', 'show', 'left', 'off', 'was', 'having', 'difficult', 'time', 'meshing', 'two', 'things', 'together', 'course', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'was', 'given', 'very', 'difficult', 'assignment', 'here', 'having', 'introduce', 'new', 'audience', 'already-established', 'characters', 'So', 'more', 'season', 'Firefly', 'viewers', 'first', 'hour', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'strange.The', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'truly', 'incredible', 'showcase', 'everything', 'good', 'entire', 'Firefly', 'concept', 'characters', 'come', 'together', 'begin', 'interacting', 'team', 'again', 'humor', 'right', 'pitch', 'gritty', 'nature', 'future', 'never', 'more', 'apparent', 'What', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'middling', 'effort', 'turned', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'span', 'just', 'hour.Though', 'Firefly', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'true', 'send-off', 'FOX', 'instead', 'being', 'cancelled', 'just', 'when', 'seemed', 'things', 'were', 'getting', 'good', 'Serenity', 'very', 'nice', 'coda', 'well-written', 'well-imagined', 'series', 'character', 're-development', 'bit', 'strange', 'once', 'things', 'settle', 'down', 'flick', 'one', 'better', 'Firefly', 'stories', 'show', 'canon']",N/A

Even before I'd seen the shows I found the movie very easy to follow. It's basically about a crew on a ship, in space. They have a girl on board with inhuman powers who knows way more information than she should and this gets them into a LOT of trouble. It would be difficult to write a spoiler about this movie because it has a lot in it. It was an awesome movie with a lot of action, lots of good laughs, a fast pace, some scary parts, a good amout of violence but not too much and a wonderful plot with chilling undertones which unfold throughout the film. The suspense was good and the characters seemed very real. It even has a little romance too. It's a well balanced story. Might be a little too scary for young kids but fine for older ones. I really found it refreshing that this movie went back to the roots of action and adventure and focused on a great plot and great acting rather than tons of expensive special effects. Overall, I would say this is a great movie and I can't think of anything bad to say about it.
