There are 4 stand alone episodes in which Morse solves intricate crimes, much to the annoyance and envy of his less qualified colleagues, and his  overbearing  captain. The only one who recognises his talent and tries to support him is Inspector Fred Friday, a seasoned detective and a fascinating character in It's own right. Roger Allam who plays Inspector Friday gives a fabulous performance, especially in the comical parts where he  &#34;scolds&#34; young Morse for being too bright for his own good, advising him to keep his head down and his insightful observation to himself and pretend to be just another mediocre block like the rest.What fascinated me most about this show is not the crime plots ( though they're pretty good) but the mystery and the questions surrounding Morse and the reasons which brought him to the police force. The atmosphere of of the show is somewhat melancholic, as we slowly reveal those reasons have something to do with a great loss and yearning for something unattainable. Shaun Evans portrays Morse as a young man by his years but already disillusioned with life and indifferent to his own fate like a much older man, with great sensitivity. I personally felt a need to give him a big hug, so gloomy and  removed from everyone else he always seems.Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, melancholic, and touching.",5,Intriguing,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,1605,"['have', 'never', 'watched', 'original', 'Morse', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'immensely', 'so', ""'re"", 'novice', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'just', 'jump', 'right', 'in.This', 'series', 'young', 'Morse', 'intelligent', 'somewhat', 'qualified', 'police', 'officer', '1960', 'Oxford', 'are', '4', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'Morse', 'intricate', 'crimes', 'much', 'annoyance', 'envy', 'less', 'qualified', 'colleagues', 'overbearing', 'captain', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'talent', 'tries', 'support', 'Inspector', 'Fred', 'Friday', 'seasoned', 'detective', 'fascinating', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'who', 'Inspector', 'Friday', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'especially', 'comical', 'parts', 'where', '34', 'scolds', '34', 'young', 'Morse', 'being', 'too', 'bright', 'own', 'good', 'advising', 'keep', 'head', 'down', 'insightful', 'observation', 'pretend', 'be', 'just', 'mediocre', 'block', 'rest.What', 'fascinated', 'most', 'show', 'not', 'crime', 'plots', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'good', 'mystery', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'Morse', 'reasons', 'brought', 'police', 'force', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'somewhat', 'melancholic', 'slowly', 'reveal', 'reasons', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'great', 'loss', 'yearning', 'something', 'unattainable', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'Morse', 'young', 'man', 'years', 'already', 'disillusioned', 'life', 'indifferent', 'own', 'fate', 'much', 'older', 'man', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'personally', 'felt', 'need', 'give', 'big', 'hug', 'gloomy', 'removed', 'everyone', 'else', 'always', 'seems.Cinematography', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'melancholic', 'touching']",N/A

Shaun Evans is adorable as Morse, a detective who lacks social skills, but is a brilliant detective.  He is a fine actor, very serious, which is what the character is about.  My favorite is DI Thursday (Roger Allam), his boss, he gives some comic relief to a serious show.  He is very entertaining!!The stories are a little drawn out and melodramatic, and it isn't as entertaining as Sherlock, which, to me sets the bar for Masterpiece Mystery, however it is an entertaining program with good acting and engaging stories.  The fun thing about the show is that it is done by good old fashioned police work- no DNA, no cell phones, no computers.  All &#34;old school&#34;.  The backdrop of Oxford is amazing, and the music in the show is wonderful too. Morse loves opera, he is an interesting multi-layered character.

It is wonderful. Can't wait for series two to come out.In case you are confused, let me give a bit of background. There was an Inspector Morse series that ran from the late 80's to the 90's more or less - Lewis was Morse's assistant in that series. Then the Inspector Lewis series followed, and I think it is still active - another great series. I watched the first episode of Inspector Morse last night, and liked it, though it seems a but dated now - in that series, Morse is a middle aged detective. In Endeavour - that's Morse's first name - Morse is a young detective in 1960's.All three programs are set in Oxford, England, and the university is somehow part of the story in each episode - at least in all the ones I've seen. Lots of murder and mayhem going on in and about the great university.Morse is on the cerebral side, but he works with more practical people all the time. They each have a contribution to make. It is interesting to watch them mesh together and get the cases solved. In Lewis, the assistant is the cerebral guy.Morse's immediate boss in Endeavour is named Thursday - he is a great character. Thursday respects Morse's intellect, but he has to work hard sometimes bringing Morse along in the real world of crime investigation. Strange is a uniform cop who plays an important role as well - it can be a little comical when he and Morse work together given how different they are, but they get along well.Thursday's boss, named Bright, seems anything but bright most of the time. An officious little jerk is more like it. It can be funny to watch Thursday deal with Bright.The plots are complex, but not overly so. Violence is there, but not overdone as in many American programs.The settings are great. Lots of opera and classical music and high brow references - but some low brow thrown in for balance now and then.This is British crime drama at its best.

Lewis on his return to Oxford.Morse is still known by his first name &#34;Endeavour,&#34; a virtue name given by his Quaker mother and his father, who was a fan of Captain James Cook whose ship was the HMS Endeavour, or by his nickname of Pagan given him during his student days at Oxford. He has returned to Oxford in 1965 as a Detective Constable to help investigate the case of a missing schoolgirl in the pilot. DI Thursday ( superb deep-voiced actor Roger Allam) recognizes Morse is a detective not a policeman and keeps him on and becomes his mentor. Another young constable named Strange is recognizable to Morse fans and a nicely done touch.All three series, of course, really star the beautiful, but not so perfect, city of Oxford and its unique place in British life.I suggest the episode &#34;Fugue&#34; is one of the best stories and dramas I remember seeing.

Unlike most American TV cop shows that move through time at breakneck speed; this series takes time to place the crime, clues and follow up in a methodical way.Morse (Code) is such an awkward character who takes his time to work out some rather mundane clues to the obvious annoyance of his superiors and he cares more about getting it right than pleasing his bosses.  Even more interesting is the time period in which the series takes place - it is late 50s - early 60s.  The cars, clothes and attitudes of that time are spot on.

1644214,A106016KSI0YQ,B00C888LOO,Jay Dickson,"[2, 2]","The genius of the Inspector Morse novels by Colin Dexter (and the famous TV series based on them) resided in two things. Forst, Oxford, with its dreaming spires, academic intrigues, enormous social mix and industrial developments, makes the perfect site for English murder mysteries. The other was the person of Inspector Endeavour Morse: intuitive, obsessive in his persnickety love of the finer things (opera, crossword puzzles, fancy cars), squeamish about blood, quick to fall for matters of the heart and even quicker to be bruised in them. The wonderfully charismatic John Thaw so perfectly realized the character on TV that when he died, Dexter killed off the character; eager to recapture his magic, British television tried to revive the series's original success by starring Morse's less intellectual and cultured compatriot, Sergeant Lewis, in his own mystery series--which succeeded so far as you could stand Sergeant Lewis. Here they try again with ""Endeavour,"" a series to appeal not just to fans of the oxford setting but of the Inspector Morse character himself, by starting at the beginning of his career in the mid-Sixties long before he met Lewis.Shaun Evans almost uncannily seems to connect with Thaw's later portrayal of Endeavour Morse: he has all the hesitations, the kindnesses, and the singular tastes, but none of the physical self-confidence Morse might have achieved in later years. In the final episode, ""Home,"" when Morse must interact with his dying, disappointed father, you get a sense of how truly fantastic Evans really is as an actor, The mid Sixties Oxford setting is terrifically and realistically realized here : very few of the women are in Mad Men bouffants but are in frumpier and more believable hairstyles that perfectly evoke the realities of the era. The mysteries are exceptionally difficult to solve (although always fairly laid out for the viewer beforehand). The only real drawback of the series is the strange variability of the plots: one of the stories, ""Fugue,"" seems more like Thomas Harris than Colin Dexter, and involves a ridiculously unlikely serial killer who spectacularly murders his victims according to the endings of operas. The much superior episodes include the pilot (involving a retired diva Morse adores); ""Rocket,"" a very Dexterish story involving Princess Margaret's visit to a munitions factory owned by a hateful wealthy family; and ""Home,"" which mixes mob involvement with local town-gown politics.",4,How he got that story,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2474,"['genius', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'novels', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'famous', 'TV', 'series', 'based', 'resided', 'two', 'things', 'Forst', 'Oxford', 'dreaming', 'spires', 'academic', 'intrigues', 'enormous', 'social', 'mix', 'industrial', 'developments', 'perfect', 'site', 'English', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'other', 'was', 'person', 'Inspector', 'Endeavour', 'Morse', 'intuitive', 'obsessive', 'persnickety', 'love', 'finer', 'things', 'opera', 'crossword', 'puzzles', 'fancy', 'cars', 'squeamish', 'blood', 'quick', 'fall', 'matters', 'heart', 'even', 'quicker', 'be', 'bruised', 'wonderfully', 'charismatic', 'John', 'Thaw', 'so', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'character', 'TV', 'when', 'died', 'Dexter', 'killed', 'off', 'character', 'eager', 'recapture', 'magic', 'British', 'television', 'tried', 'revive', 'series', 'original', 'success', 'starring', 'Morse', 'less', 'intellectual', 'cultured', 'compatriot', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'own', 'mystery', 'series', 'succeeded', 'so', 'far', 'could', 'stand', 'Sergeant', 'Lewis', 'Here', 'try', 'again', 'Endeavour', 'series', 'appeal', 'not', 'just', 'fans', 'oxford', 'setting', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'character', 'starting', 'beginning', 'career', 'mid-Sixties', 'long', 'met', 'Lewis.Shaun', 'Evans', 'almost', 'uncannily', 'connect', 'Thaw', 'later', 'portrayal', 'Endeavour', 'Morse', 'hesitations', 'kindnesses', 'singular', 'tastes', 'none', 'physical', 'self-confidence', 'Morse', 'might', 'have', 'achieved', 'later', 'years', 'final', 'episode', 'Home', 'when', 'Morse', 'must', 'interact', 'dying', 'disappointed', 'father', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'Evans', 'really', 'actor', 'mid', 'Sixties', 'Oxford', 'setting', 'terrifically', 'realistically', 'realized', 'here', 'very', 'few', 'women', 'are', 'Mad', 'Men', 'bouffants', 'are', 'frumpier', 'more', 'believable', 'hairstyles', 'perfectly', 'evoke', 'realities', 'era', 'mysteries', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'difficult', 'solve', 'always', 'fairly', 'laid', 'out', 'viewer', 'beforehand', 'only', 'real', 'drawback', 'series', 'strange', 'variability', 'plots', 'one', 'stories', 'Fugue', 'more', 'Thomas', 'Harris', 'Colin', 'Dexter', 'ridiculously', 'unlikely', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'murders', 'victims', 'according', 'endings', 'operas', 'much', 'superior', 'episodes', 'include', 'pilot', 'involving', 'retired', 'diva', 'Morse', 'Rocket', 'very', 'Dexterish', 'story', 'involving', 'Princess', 'Margaret', 'visit', 'munitions', 'factory', 'owned', 'hateful', 'wealthy', 'family', 'Home', 'mixes', 'mob', 'involvement', 'local', 'town-gown', 'politics']",N/A

1644230,A28YDMI499J1X9,B00C888LOO,J. Janssen,"[18, 18]","Following up on last year's premier are four new episodes featuring a young Endeavour Morse in his early days on the job, circa 1965.  While not  physically resembling the late John Thaw, the young actor Shaun Evans has obviously done his homework and mastered many of the mannerisms Thaw brought to the role.  Additionally, they've incorporated little details from the original series creating a tacit connection between the two productions.  These touchstones are so well done that viewers not familiar with ""Inspector Morse"" will likely assume them to be part of the narrative dialogue, while knowledgeable fans will readily spot the homage.  Besides establishing early relationships with pathologist Max de Bryn and future Chief Superintendent Jim Strange, they managed a couple sly references to one of Morse' romantic rivals, Sir Alex Reece, a future Master of fictional Beaumont College and significant character in ""The Last Enemy"".As in the premier an ongoing role has been created for Abby Thaw, the eldest of John Thaw's three daughters. This is a particularly nice touch and seems typical of the obvious care they've taken in producing a series worthy of the original production.  Likewise, veteran British actor Roger Allam reprises his role as Morse'  mentor, DI Fred Thursday.  Allam  played a major character in ""Death is Now My Neighbor"", an ""Inspector Morse"" film from the late 1990's.  Additionally, 83 year old Colin Dexter has a cameo in at least two of the episodes signifying his approval of this prequel to the eponymous novels.  Finally, Barrington Pheloung has again been commissioned to score the individual episodes and each opens and closes with the beautiful and evocative theme from the original series.  This is a top tier production and the writing, casting, and production values are as good as anything on television.So why not 5 stars?  Well, to be honest the premier and first four episodes merit a 5 star rating, but Masterpiece Mystery is a co-producer and has had a checkered history since it's debut as an investor and co-producer in  UK productions.  While the  Morse sequel, ""Inspector Lewis"", had a small but loyal following it never developed into a serious production rivaling it's predecessor.  Early on PBS tried to pawn off the badly edited television broadcasts in the Lewis DVD packages only to find many customers purchasing the full length UK version instead.  The episodes in the first two seasons were all 104 minutes to fit the 2 hour commercial UK time slot, but PBS tried to shoehorn them into their 90 minute commercial free window.  When you net out the additional Masterpiece content there's a lot of video left on the editing room floor.  The premier of ""Inspector Lewis"" was shown intact on the original PBS Mystery, a time flexible venue. But when the series was picked up two years later by newly created Masterpiece Mystery they adopted a 90 minute window which meant all the initial 104 minute episodes were trimmed pretty significantly.  This exposed PBS to all manner of criticism.  By Series 3 an exasperated PBS, having had enough of the carping, exercised their co-producer clout and demanded all the editions, including the UK master, be cut back approximately 10 minutes which left a more manageable core product for them to further edit for broadcast in the lucrative North American market.  They then disingenuously adopted the official UK edition* claim, but by this time the series had devolved into little more than a campus police procedural and suffered in quality compared to it's predecessor.  ""Endeavour"" is following a similar pattern as the premier ran 104 minutes, but the first 4 episodes just 93 minutes.  By comparison, all of the original Morse films were 104 minutes. When writers cut back screenplays they inevitably eliminate the quiet conversations and introspective moments that make great characters.  The problem is not that you have a shortened film, but that the film is fundamentally weakened.  It becomes less character driven and more reliant on plot alone which is the antithesis of the qualities so admired in the ""Inspector Morse"" series.  Thus far the Endeavour writers have been up to the task of crafting compelling dramas in the shortened format, but writers can leave and be replaced, particularly if interfering co-producers create problems, hence my concern.Additionally, I fear the scripts are going to rely too heavily on Endeavour's familiarity with the arts and academia as the premier and 2 of the first 4 episodes were only resolved with his knowledge of classical music.  A problem with the aforementioned ""Inspector Lewis"" was that the series fell into a thematic rut by having the majority of episodes focused on the colleges. By contrast the Morse scripts were varied and balanced between Oxford's infamous ""town and gown"" social tension.  A good half of the Morse films were situated outside of the town entirely, dealing with the greater Thames Valley and beyond. These had little, if any, connection to the academic community. With Lewis they seized on one small aspect of the successful Morse series and beat it into the ground. It's early days for ""Endeavour"", but the dramas thus far seem a little too centered around the title character's affinity for opera and choral music.  While the mature Morse did dabble in amateur choir and often purchased (and then misplaced) tickets to operatic performances, he was a Wagnerian at heart and, as any music lover knows, Wagner men rarely need protection from punctilious superintendents or envious sergeants as he has thus far been portrayed. I understand that they want to solidify his personality and establish the early struggle for acceptance, but a little goes a long way and even the best screen writers can have problems letting their characters mature and develop. This is particularly critical in a prequel where a knowledgable audience will likely want to see Endeavour progress into the Morse they know as quickly as possible. The risk is that the writers get stuck painting the character as a troubled introvert who's academic background is over emphasized.  John Thaw's Morse was neither troubled, introverted, nor overtly intellectual. He was a thoughtful criminal investigator who got it wrong almost as often as he got it right.  He just happened to have an elite education, a penchant for literary quotes and, upon occasion, a perverse streak that would compel him to  assume the most unlikely of motives, all of which could make police work more complex than he, or his colleagues, were comfortable with. The premier Morse film (adapted from Colin Dexter's fifth novel) set the stage where he mistakenly believed one of the Theban plays held the key to a woman's death. It was the first of many wild goose chases he and (then) DS Lewis would embark upon. Dexter wrote the character as being a little short on ""who did it"", but a master of ""why it was done"". In fact, Morse only rarely solved cases in the traditional sense as most played out with Shakespearian inevitability while he stood witness to the frailties of the human condition.  Unlike Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes, Morse became a legendary character, not because of any great skill in forensic detection, but because he could make sense of those frailties through the prism of his own life experience.  Not an easy task for a screen writer and young actor to replicate.A final word regarding the star rating; the discs include the same brand advertising for a cruise ship line and fashion designer that PBS ran on the TV broadcasts. They did the same thing with the final season of ""Inspector Lewis"".  This material could have easily been edited out and it makes one wonder if including it for additional compensation wasn't a bit crass. I don't have any problem with PBS adopting advertising as a revenue source, but it's beyond the pale to include it in the DVD sets customers pay for. It's one thing to have a distributor include trailers of other shows in their catalog, but actual paid advertising for third party commercial interests? This sort of thing only demeans PBS and all that it has stood for since it's inception as National Education Television in 1952.  If you were to purchase a season of a domestic network TV show and were subject to toothpaste and insurance commercials most people would be upset.  Including advertising in a home video product seems particularly bush league when you consider that PBS still clings to the illusion of being a commercial free network.  Be that as it may, the actual production has made all the right artistic moves and my hesitation to adopt full throated enthusiasm stems solely from the ongoing threat of PBS exercising more ill advised creative control over content.*  This set is annotated as the ""FULL UK-LENGTH EDITION"" rather than the ""ORIGINAL UK EDITION""  on the premier.",4,A stellar prequel to the Inspector Morse

The series focuses on Morse's early days in the police force, and shows how his character developed: his quirkiness, love of opera, weakness for women and spikiness. More than that, the story lines never take cliched  routes, and there is something wonderfully understated about the whole endeavor. Sean Evans is marvelous as the brilliant, hyper educated Morse, who always seems ill at ease in his sole suit of clothing, or is it his own skin, since he has no real sense of belonging, and knows it.

1644289,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00C888LOO,L. M. Keefer,"[65, 67]","If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years, you will be delighted to know that the series is being revived in a new form.John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?But now enters the new younger Morse in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. However, the author Colin Dexter, supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.Is this new endeavor worthy of the old series? I found it to be so. The younger Morse is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music, women witnesses, crossword puzzles, literature classics, stubbornness and tenacity is already in evidence. The production values I found to be superior to the old series. The sets for example--the police station, Morse's apartment rental, and even the car repair shop were amazing. The cinematography was original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera etc.The actors were stand-outs: Endeavor's boss and ""the governor"" or chief of police, the car dealer, the other police supervisors, the suspects, and an old friend of Endeavor's at Oxford. It was an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor--you could see a bit of her father's face in hers.The crime was appropriately complex, involving a professor at Oxford.

The mysteries are a tad complicated (and at times, convoluted), yet it is the characters that drive this beautifully filmed period piece. Shaun Evans is mesmerizing as the young Inspector Morse (long before he became an inspector, of course), and all eyes tend to be on him (that's not to say that his supporting cast aren't wonderful, too - because they certainly are). Beautifully filmed, each shot is framed to perfection, and the period details (those 'shabby-chic' British homes before they were 'chic', and still just 'shabby) are perfectly rendered, as are the period costumes.There are nuances here that might be lost on American audiences; chiefly, the little 'class struggle' between the posh and educated Morse and his immediate superior, an aspiring lower middle-class toady (the British police force is the domain of the working class/lower middle-class; this proves the source of much dramatic tension between Morse and many of his peers), and this is played out with subtle perfection in many of the scenes.Lacking the warmth of 'Foyle's War', one still ends up feeling a warmth towards the characters in Endeavour (most notably Morse's superior, Fred Thursday, as well as the adorable Sgt Strange), yet it is strong yet subtle performance by Shaun Evans that makes 'Endeavour' shine.If you are like me (and have run out of 'Foyle's War', 'Poirot', 'Marple', and even the (by comparison) a bit rubbish 'Inspector Linley'), you will find that 'Endeavour' fills a much needed gap! :)",5,"Dare I say...BETTER than ""Morse"" (?!)",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1620,"['dare', ""n't"", 'say', ""'better"", 'Morse', 'would', 'venture', 'wonderfully', ""'different"", 'own', 'entity', 'entirely', 'mysteries', 'are', 'tad', 'complicated', 'times', 'convoluted', 'characters', 'drive', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'period', 'piece', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'mesmerizing', 'young', 'Inspector', 'Morse', 'long', 'before', 'became', 'inspector', 'course', 'eyes', 'tend', 'be', 'not', 'say', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', ""n't"", 'wonderful', 'too', 'certainly', 'are', 'Beautifully', 'filmed', 'shot', 'framed', 'perfection', 'period', 'details', ""'shabby-chic"", 'British', 'homes', 'were', ""'chic"", 'still', 'just', ""'shabby"", 'are', 'perfectly', 'rendered', 'are', 'period', 'are', 'nuances', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'lost', 'American', 'audiences', 'chiefly', 'little', 'struggle', 'posh', 'educated', 'Morse', 'immediate', 'superior', 'aspiring', 'lower', 'middle-class', 'toady', 'British', 'police', 'force', 'domain', 'working', 'class/lower', 'middle-class', 'source', 'much', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Morse', 'many', 'peers', 'played', 'out', 'subtle', 'perfection', 'many', 'scenes.Lacking', 'warmth', ""'Foyle"", 'War', 'one', 'still', 'up', 'feeling', 'warmth', 'characters', 'Endeavour', 'most', 'notably', 'Morse', 'superior', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'as', 'well', 'adorable', 'Sgt', 'Strange', 'strong', 'yet', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'shine.If', 'are', 'have', 'run', ""'Foyle"", 'War', ""'Poirot"", 'even', 'comparison', 'bit', 'rubbish', ""'Inspector"", 'Linley', 'will', 'find', ""'Endeavour"", 'much', 'needed', 'gap']",N/A

Clearly, however,  the Colin Dexter novels of Inspector Morse rank among the very best.  Here, we see Inspector Morse begin his career as a police officer, falling in love with Jaguars and indulging his love of Opera and classical music (for the record,  the title Endeavor is Morse's first name, a fact not disclosed in either the original series of programs or in Dexter's books until very late; the explanation is that Morse's mother was a huge fan of the explorations of Captain Cook and his ship, the Endeavor).  This  is a great prequel series and Shaun Evans  makes a very good  Morse.  It's impossible to foresee  how long this series will run but it's probably better than the original John Thaw series.  Evans'  Morse is considerably more likeable, both brilliant and flawed.  The supporting cast is even better if that's possible.  Roger Allams plays Inspector Thursday, Morse's mentor and Anton Lesser brilliantly plays Morse's bureaucratic and political Chief Superintendent Bright, always scheming to undermine Morse's career.

1644326,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00C888LOO,mirasreviews,"[5, 8]","""Endeavour"" is back for its first full season with 4 new episodes featuring a young Endeavour Morse in his early days on the Oxford police force, before he became the iconic ""Inspector Morse."" The mysteries take place in 1965. The period details and photography are great. But the title character is made for 21st century tastes. Young Endeavour Morse doesn't resemble his older self of Colin Dexter's novels or of ITV's detective series in the 1990s. Inspector Morse was an introvert but a sensualist and a drinker. Endeavour Morse is a very serious young man who likes opera and cogitates like Sherlock Holmes. He's a geek in the mold of so many detective dramas of late -""Sherlock"", ""CSI"", ""Numb3rs""- transported to the 1960s. The writers are catering to a taste for, and fascination with, nerds in popular culture.One result is that Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans) is overshadowed by the stronger character of Detective Inspector Fred Thursday (Roger Allam). Allam steals the scenes that he is in. Series 1 introduces Chief Superintendent Bright (Anton Lesser), DI Thursday's old-fashioned and career-minded superior, who doesn't quite trust ambitious young DC Morse or his methods. Detective Sergeant Peter Jakes (Jack Laskey) is Morse's rival on the force, a man of conspicuously ordinary ambitions and ethics. PC Jim Strange (Sean Rigby) is a street cop who has taken a liking to, or developed a tolerance for, Morse's unorthodox ways. Dr. Max Debryn (James Bradshaw) is back as the nerdy pathologist, complete with thick-rimmed glasses and argyle vest. John Thaw's daughter Abigail Thaw plays a recurring minor character in Dorothea Frazil, a local journalist with her finger on the pulse of Oxford politics.As the Series opens, Detective Constable Morse is trying to rise above general duties with DI Thursday's support. He'll soon be taking his Sergent's Exam. The mysteries are generally good, though, as is common in television detective dramas, little attention is paid to plausibility or whether the solutions make sense. The filmmakers don't expect the audience to think it through. Shaun Evans is obviously too old for the role, but he plays it well enough, as long as we keep in mind that he is playing some kind of post-War nerd, not John Thaw's younger self. I really don't think this would succeed without Roger Allam as Thursday, and much credit is due the supporting actors who embody unlikable characters perfectly: Anton Lesser and Jack Laskey. They make scenes interesting that would be dull otherwise. All four episodes have one-word titles. They are:Morse has been promoted from general duties to detective duties, based on merit, which scandalizes the department somewhat, in ""Girl"", the first of the series. A 20-year-old secretarial student, Margaret Bell (Fiona Ryan), is found dead in her bed, apparently due to a heart condition, but Morse suspects that there may be more to it. Meanwhile, series' of violent postal hold-ups and gas meter robberies occupy the department with more mundane cases. But when a Dr. Cartwright (Dominic Taylor), the partner of Margaret's GP, is shot to death, it strengthens Morse's convictions that there is more to the case, leading him to the sordid affairs of Cartwright's widow's (Olivia Grant) family, who are connected to the University through Helen's father (Jonathan Hyde), a physics professor who has been receiving threatening letters. Keeping with the geek theme, there is cryptography in this one.In ""Fugue"", Morse is back to general duties at the insistence of Chief Superintendent Bright. He discovers words from Verdi's opera ""Othello"" written at the scene of a murder, where a woman was found strangled. When a widowed botanist is found poisoned by one of her plants, and another operatic inscription is found at the scene, it begins to appear that the culprit is playing a game with investigators. A psychiatrist named Dr. Croyn (Geoffrey Streatfeild) is brought in as a consultant. He specializes in a new type of murderer: the serial killer, which he believes are a coming trend. More bodies add to the pile of clues, each victim killed in a manner depicted in an opera. And onus is on Morse, in particular, to solve the riddle and track down the killer, as he is the only one who knows anything about opera. The killer seems to have singled Morse out for special attention.""Rocket"" finds the ""British Imperial Electric Company"" hosting a royal visit to its munitions factory in hopes of selling it's new, high-tech missile. Princess Margaret and a Jordanian Prince are in attendance, and the police are charged with providing extra security. Unfortunately, an unpopular worker named Percy Malleson (James Merry) is found stabbed to death shortly after the event. The union suspected that Malleson was a spy. The Broom family, who own the company, are in the midst of sensitive business negotiations and bickering amongst themselves. President Henry Bloom's (Martin Jarvis) personal assistant Alice (Maime McCoy) is an old acquaintance of Morse who carries a torch for him. Due to the royal visit, the case is politically sensitive, and Thursday is encouraged by Chief Superintendent Bright to wrap it up quickly even if that means cutting corners.Oxford don Alistair Coke Norris (Paul Venables) is found dead in the road, victim of an apparent hit-and-run in ""Home"". Among his effects are a matchbook from the Moonlight Room nightclub, with a phone number written inside. The Moonlight Room is owned by a London mobster named Vic Kaspar (Clive Wood), whom DI Thursday holds in deep contempt, as the two have a violent history. Kaspar claims he has retired and is now running a legitimate nightclub. It turns out that Professor Coke Norris was killed en route to a city council meeting where he was scheduled to speak against the sale of some college land, a parcel called Booth Hill, to a real estate developer. Both the college and the many investors stood to profit if the deal went through, but there has been talk of bribery and corruption. Meanwhile, Morse prepares for his sergeant's exam, and his father has fallen ill.",4,"Entertaining, but a Lot of Credit Is Due to Photography, Period Details, and Supporting Cast.",1375315200,"08 1,

He is young, vulnerable, kind, and sports a messy shaggy hair cut.  Its tempting to dismiss him as a lightweight, but as the stories develop we see that he actually has some depth and grit.  He is forthright and persistent.  He allows others to underestimate him and even bully him while he just plods along, doggedly pursuing his target.  Meanwhile his mentor (a much older detective) is equally tough and used to being the underdog, condescended to by his superiors.  We see that while he is their intellectual better, he never asserts himself, knowing that in doing so he may forfeit the chance to succeed in his hunt for the mark.  All the while, the young detective watches his example and carefully files away what he needs to know for the day when he has his own opportunity to shine.

'Endeavour' takes us back to his younger days in the 1960's, where he is a Detective Constable. This is the second year in this series. The first year was an introduction and was well received.Morse is played by Shaun Evans, and Detective Inspector Fred Thursday, played by Roger Allam, is his mentor. DI Thursday saw great promise in DC Morse, and a kindred spirit, of sorts. In this series we see DI Thursday at home with his wife and older children. DC Morse has breakfast with them at one point, and socially awkward is the name of the game.  We also get to see DC Morse visit his home in one episode. His father is very ill, and their relationship is almost non-existent. We meet his step mother who has no use for Endeavour, and we see Endeavour visit his mother's grave, and we understand that this is where his heart lies. Morse loves the Opera and sings in the local choir. He has no time for anything else but his work. Disheveled hair and suit, I wanted to give him a hug.The four episodes in this second series are well written with plenty of action, but it is DC Morse's intelligence that puts two and two together and solves most of the crimes. There is a new CS, played by Anton Lesser, who reminds me more of an old spinster, but who cracks the whip. He is not a fan of Morse, Morse is unusual and does not play the usual get ahead at work games, but the  CS does appreciate Morse's youth and intelligence.I enjoyed this second series, felt like I was finally getting to know my beloved Morse.  He is quick and endearing, and his mentor DI Thursday is the exact kind of man to help Morse further his career. We remember the older Morse, and his side-kick Det. Lewis, and have a better understanding of the mentor and their relationship.Highly Recommended. prisrob 07-31-13",5,We Are Finally Getting To Know Ye,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,1986,"['Endeavour', 'Morse', 'aka', ""'Inspector"", 'Morse', 'BBC', 'series', '1987-2000', 'younger', 'unsure', 'Morse', 'brilliant', 'not', 'socially', 'secure', 'might', 'be', 'known', 'having', 'Aspergers', 'day', 'age', 'back', 'younger', 'days', '1960', 'where', 'Detective', 'Constable', 'second', 'year', 'series', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'introduction', 'was', 'well', 'received.Morse', 'played', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'played', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'mentor', 'DI', 'Thursday', 'saw', 'great', 'promise', 'DC', 'Morse', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'sorts', 'series', 'see', 'DI', 'Thursday', 'home', 'wife', 'older', 'children', 'DC', 'Morse', 'breakfast', 'one', 'point', 'socially', 'awkward', 'name', 'game', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'DC', 'Morse', 'visit', 'home', 'one', 'episode', 'father', 'very', 'ill', 'relationship', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'meet', 'step', 'mother', 'who', 'use', 'Endeavour', 'see', 'Endeavour', 'mother', 'grave', 'understand', 'where', 'heart', 'Morse', 'Opera', 'sings', 'local', 'choir', 'time', 'anything', 'else', 'work', 'Disheveled', 'hair', 'suit', 'wanted', 'give', 'hug.The', 'four', 'episodes', 'second', 'series', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'plenty', 'action', 'DC', 'Morse', 'intelligence', 'two', 'two', 'together', 'most', 'crimes', 'new', 'CS', 'played', 'Anton', 'Lesser', 'who', 'more', 'old', 'spinster', 'who', 'whip', 'not', 'fan', 'Morse', 'Morse', 'unusual', 'not', 'play', 'usual', 'get', 'ahead', 'work', 'games', 'CS', 'appreciate', 'Morse', 'youth', 'intelligence.I', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'series', 'felt', 'was', 'finally', 'getting', 'know', 'beloved', 'Morse', 'quick', 'endearing', 'mentor', 'DI', 'Thursday', 'exact', 'kind', 'man', 'help', 'Morse', 'further', 'career', 'remember', 'older', 'Morse', 'side-kick', 'Det', 'Lewis', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'mentor', 'relationship.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '07-31-13']",N/A

While keeping traits of the character established by John Thaw, Evans does not mimic Thaw's performance but does give us a man in whom it is possible to see the older inspector to come.  It must be a tough job for any actor to establish his own interpretation of a character within the confines of another actor's performance.  Evans seems up to the task.  I enjoyed these first episodes, and in Series 2, Evans and a strong supporting cast of regulars do a good job of creating the unique ""world"" of Detective Constable Morse.

1644380,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00C888LOO,Richard B. Schwartz,"[10, 10]","These are simply wonderful.  I am a great Thaw fan, with the wooden-boxed Morse set, the Kavanagh QC set and other work.  I love the Lewis series and am exploring some of Kevin Whately's independent work.  In each Oxford series there is a strong relationship between the partners: Morse/Lewis, Lewis/Hathaway, so much so that the shows present us with virtual co-stars.  In the Endeavour series, a young Morse is guided by an older Detective Inspector, played by Roger Allam.  Except for an occasional sighting of Allam I had only seen him in a brilliant comic role on the London stage, in Tom Stoppard's Arcadia.  In Endeavour, he and Shaun Evans are truly exceptional.  As in the best of all British mystery/suspense, the personal relationships are at the core of the story and are key to its success.In my opinion, the Endeavour series is the best of the Morse/Lewis/Endeavour trilogy and that is a very difficult league in which to compete.  The series is, of course, a prequel, with Evans playing a young detective constable, learning from an older man, but displaying his unique gifts.  Each are hampered by a time-serving, risk-averse, chain-smoking supervisor.  Morse also intersects with a smarmy, difficult detective sergeant, who envies him, and a husky police constable named Strange who continually calls Morse `matey'.  He, of course, will eventually become the mature Morse's supervisor.The series is exceptional for the usual (though elusive) reasons.  The scripts are superb.  Both Morse and Lewis have a tendency, at times, to present convoluted stories.  The characters are excellent, of course, but at the end you have to think very hard to recapitulate what actually just happened and who did exactly what.  The Endeavour scripts are leaner and tighter and a bit more clear.  The performances are spectacular.  DI Fred Thursday (Allam) is a loving but strong mentor.  He has everything that Morse lacks: a wife, family and broad experience.  Morse, of course, has everything that Thursday lacks: technical knowledge, an Oxford education and a quirky, apparently non-linear but ultimately very-linear way of thinking.  Morse solves the cases without diminishing or upstaging Thursday and Thursday protects Morse within the bureaucracy and provides the wind beneath what are fast becoming broad wings.  Evans nails Morse's personality and gestures and captures the character's essential loneliness.We never quite know why Morse does what he does--an educated, opera-loving homicide detective.  The mysteries of his personality are part of his attractiveness.  He is no pasteboard figure.  We know that he will never achieve personal happiness because that is who he is and that is what makes him, in part, so successful in his professional role.  He will never have the love that he seeks and so we give it to him.The direction is superb: lean without being minamilist.  The pacing is slow but deliberate and intense, without resorting to gimmickry.  Costuming is excellent and we have a sense of the period without it becoming an intrusive distraction.  Roger Allam really knows how to smoke a pipe.  It is not a prop but a part of his personality.  Evans always looks comfortable in himself but simultaneously disheveled.  It is who he is.  He has all of the great Holmes traits--specialized knowledge, the powers of `deduction', a kind of otherworldliness, the absence of a true, personal life, and so on, without ever consciously evoking the Holmes character.Each time I watch an episode of Endeavour there is a sense of calm and completeness, that feeling that comes when you are in the presence of great art--the realization that you have just witnessed something done incomparably well.  You are moved emotionally but also moved by the sense that you have just experienced the work of master craftsmen.Highly recommended.",5,The Finest of the Morse/Lewis/Endeavour Series,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",2013,3847,"['are', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'am', 'great', 'Thaw', 'fan', 'wooden-boxed', 'Morse', 'set', 'Kavanagh', 'QC', 'set', 'other', 'work', 'love', 'Lewis', 'series', 'am', 'exploring', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'independent', 'work', 'Oxford', 'series', 'strong', 'relationship', 'partners', 'Morse/Lewis', 'Lewis/Hathaway', 'so', 'much', 'shows', 'present', 'virtual', 'co-stars', 'Endeavour', 'series', 'young', 'Morse', 'guided', 'older', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'played', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'Except', 'occasional', 'sighting', 'Allam', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'role', 'London', 'stage', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'Arcadia', 'Endeavour', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'are', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'best', 'British', 'mystery/suspense', 'personal', 'relationships', 'are', 'core', 'story', 'are', 'key', 'success.In', 'opinion', 'Endeavour', 'series', 'best', 'Morse/Lewis/Endeavour', 'trilogy', 'very', 'difficult', 'league', 'compete', 'series', 'course', 'prequel', 'Evans', 'playing', 'young', 'detective', 'constable', 'learning', 'older', 'man', 'displaying', 'unique', 'gifts', 'are', 'hampered', 'time-serving', 'risk-averse', 'chain-smoking', 'supervisor', 'Morse', 'also', 'smarmy', 'difficult', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'who', 'husky', 'police', 'constable', 'named', 'Strange', 'who', 'continually', 'Morse', 'matey', 'course', 'will', 'eventually', 'become', 'mature', 'Morse', 'supervisor.The', 'series', 'exceptional', 'usual', 'elusive', 'reasons', 'scripts', 'are', 'superb', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'have', 'tendency', 'times', 'present', 'convoluted', 'stories', 'characters', 'are', 'excellent', 'course', 'end', 'have', 'think', 'very', 'hard', 'recapitulate', 'what', 'actually', 'just', 'happened', 'who', 'did', 'exactly', 'what', 'Endeavour', 'scripts', 'are', 'leaner', 'tighter', 'bit', 'more', 'clear', 'performances', 'are', 'spectacular', 'DI', 'Fred', 'Thursday', 'Allam', 'loving', 'strong', 'mentor', 'everything', 'Morse', 'wife', 'family', 'broad', 'experience', 'Morse', 'course', 'everything', 'Thursday', 'technical', 'knowledge', 'Oxford', 'education', 'quirky', 'apparently', 'non-linear', 'ultimately', 'very-linear', 'way', 'thinking', 'Morse', 'cases', 'diminishing', 'upstaging', 'Thursday', 'Thursday', 'Morse', 'bureaucracy', 'wind', 'beneath', 'what', 'are', 'fast', 'becoming', 'broad', 'wings', 'Evans', 'nails', 'Morse', 'personality', 'gestures', 'character', 'essential', 'loneliness.We', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'why', 'Morse', 'what', 'educated', 'opera-loving', 'homicide', 'detective', 'mysteries', 'personality', 'are', 'part', 'attractiveness', 'pasteboard', 'figure', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'achieve', 'personal', 'happiness', 'who', 'what', 'part', 'so', 'successful', 'professional', 'role', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'love', 'so', 'give', 'him.The', 'direction', 'superb', 'lean', 'being', 'minamilist', 'pacing', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'intense', 'resorting', 'gimmickry', 'Costuming', 'excellent', 'have', 'sense', 'period', 'becoming', 'intrusive', 'distraction', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'really', 'how', 'smoke', 'pipe', 'not', 'prop', 'part', 'personality', 'Evans', 'always', 'comfortable', 'simultaneously', 'disheveled', 'who', 'great', 'Holmes', 'traits', 'specialized', 'knowledge', 'powers', 'deduction', 'kind', 'otherworldliness', 'absence', 'true', 'personal', 'life', 'so', 'ever', 'consciously', 'evoking', 'Holmes', 'character.Each', 'time', 'watch', 'episode', 'Endeavour', 'sense', 'calm', 'completeness', 'feeling', 'when', 'are', 'presence', 'great', 'art', 'realization', 'have', 'just', 'witnessed', 'something', 'done', 'incomparably', 'well', 'are', 'moved', 'emotionally', 'also', 'moved', 'sense', 'have', 'just', 'experienced', 'work', 'master', 'craftsmen.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

1644468,A3ICVJQMZAGQV5,B00C888LOO,wisdomstar,"[0, 0]","I am a big fan of MORSE and have watched all of that series, some of them several times. When LEWIS came out, I loved it as well, especially the relationship between Lewis and his sidekick. The relationships in MORSE and LEWIS are as interesting as the murder mysteries. One of the delights of MORSE was that he was usually wrong the first time and then worked to get it right by the end. ENDEAVOUR is a worthy addition to both of these series. Here we have the young Morse, who usually gets it wrong the first time and right by the end, plus his problems with choosing women who are wounded birds, the same theme music which works the Morse code for Morse into the underlying rhythm and the origin stories which explain how he came to be the adult version of himself. We even get the origin of Constable Strange and the pathologist and their relationships with Morse. Inspector Thursday I have come to admire. He is a good 'father figure' for Morse and his relationship with Morse is a delight to watch. Too bad that Morse couldn't become more like him; his life would have probably been happier. And of course, cameos of Colin Dexter, the author of the books. If you like a good murder mystery with a lot of suspects running around, a well-written plot and beautiful scenery of Oxford, you will like these series as much as I do. If I could give it a 10, I would.
