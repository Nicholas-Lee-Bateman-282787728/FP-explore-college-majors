I am a huge Yanni fan and have bought all of his CD's and DVD's, but this one was, well just boring.  I was expecting a full two hours of Susan Amato's type of singing renditions of Yanni songs, yes, I was prepared for vocals to the melodies, but it just left me empty.  It was formulaic and just predictable. I will keep it and put it in the library, but it is not something I am looking forward to watching again anytime soon.  It is too bad, I have been to his live concerts, and you leave walking on air, it is quite an experience, the DVD, historically, while not as moving as the live experience, are still good, this ... something is just missing.

1280787,A2SZRY5TFW27TR,B002O4J4E8,Gordon Ewasiuk,"[4, 4]","Ok, it has vocalists.  Not like those two lovely divas from Yanni Live.  This show has actual singers.  Now wait a minute.  Before you automatically dismiss this, hear me out.  Some of the vocalists are worthy of your ear.  Take Nathan, a powerful tenor, who completely owns the stage with 'Unico Amore' and 'Amare Di Nuovo'.  Words fail me to describe his voice.  It felt like a warm blanket wrapped around me.  His voice doesn't fail him during high or low notes.  His tone and pitch is spot on.  Watching him is like watching a young Andrea Bocelli.Before going on, I have to mention 'Our Days' by Leslie Mills & Chloe.  It is, quite possibly, the most erotic song in Yanni's vast inventory.  I say ""erotic"" in a good way.  Watching Chloe perform to the music was nothing short of breathtaking.  She has a dancer's body and displayed the flexibility that comes with it.  Her robotic, jerky movements were in time with the music -- which added to the allure.  Leslie comes out halfway through and her vocals are just tantalizing.  I found myself stuck staring at the TV unable to move.  Leslie captures the mood with her vocals as she stretches out on Yanni's piano.  The song is almost hypnotizing. Yanni even got into the act and appeared to be directing Chloe with his hand movements.  The entire song and act was nothing short of brilliant.Another highlight is the violin duels between Anne Marie Calhoun and Samuel Yervinian.  This is Ms. Calhoun's first appearance in a Yanni show but you couldn't tell that by her performance.  She brought a flourish to the performance that was missing from earlier Yanni shows.  When she unfurls her hair as she stands up to begin a dual, for example, riles up the audience.  When she is dueling with Samuel, you can see her smiling throughout her performance.  I swear she only looked at her violin maybe five time during the entire duel!  Samuel, as usual, didn't disappoint and even got into the stage antics by making faces at Anne Marie while he played.  During the second duel, he really let loose and was playing just crazy fast -- faster, I think, than he did during Yanni Live.A final highlight for me was the horn solo.  I didn't catch the horn player's name but the effort he put into the solo was astounding.  You could see the effort in his face due to several camera closeups.  He nailed every note and put on a memorable solo.Are there forgettable parts?  Sure.  It's a new format for Yanni so he's trying new things.  There is still enough great music here to make it worth the price.

I realize thatartists, composers, actors, all grow and improve with age.  But I'vesomehow missed the intrique about setting Yanni's beautiful music with lyrics.  Spanish lyrics at that, so non-Spanish speaking fans have NO idea what the singers are singing.  On the plus side, the four singers in concert have beautiful vocal instruments.
