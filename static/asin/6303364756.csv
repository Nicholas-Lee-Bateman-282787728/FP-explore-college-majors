370656,ATSWIYN2BJDVP,6303364756,Movie and Music lover!,"[29, 29]","I absolutely adore Susan Hayward, and she looked beautiful in this film. But then, Susan looked beautiful in every film she made.This story is a simple one... a country preacher marries a ""city girl"" and brings her to live with him in the hills of Georgia. A number of events occur over the next three years as people in the community become ill with an epidemic, and the preachers wife questions God and why some people die and others do not. It is the classic question of life... why does it appear as though there is injustice in the world, and why does God allow so much suffering? The movie deals aptly with those questions.Prior to watching this film, I was not familiar with William Lundigan. I think he did a great job. Wow, and what a handsome man he was!The scenery in this movie was breathtakingly beautiful!Anyway, if you like classic stories that deal with subjects like God and family, then you will enjoy this movie.",5,Such a heart-warming story.,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,931,"['absolutely', 'adore', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'film', 'then', 'Susan', 'looked', 'beautiful', 'film', 'made.This', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'country', 'preacher', 'city', 'girl', 'live', 'hills', 'Georgia', 'number', 'events', 'occur', 'next', 'three', 'years', 'people', 'community', 'become', 'ill', 'epidemic', 'preachers', 'wife', 'questions', 'God', 'why', 'people', 'die', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'classic', 'question', 'life', 'why', 'appear', 'injustice', 'world', 'why', 'God', 'allow', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'movie', 'deals', 'aptly', 'questions.Prior', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'William', 'Lundigan', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Wow', 'what', 'handsome', 'man', 'was', 'scenery', 'movie', 'was', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'Anyway', 'like', 'classic', 'stories', 'deal', 'subjects', 'God', 'family', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A
