For those that remember the 80s or see reruns on cable, there used be social drama called '30 Something', and for me this best sums the fusion between this film and the Apocalypse. This is American post-apocalyptic film telling the story of a couple who raise their daughter while living off the grid, until a disaster brings about radical changes in the life they have been living and the way they will view their friends. A film that is made up of series of vignettes as a group of friends intermingle and loosely try to figure out who may have caused the break down through a computer virus. Then add into the mix a biker gang and National Guard soldiers - both of which play out their stereo types.This is indie film with some rather good actors, but the story and the narrative seem to be out of phase with the premise of the movie. As an example - who would discuss property values in the middle of world melt down? The DVD cover is really poor thinking on the part of the marketing company that were given the job to put out the DVD, and is misleading at best.
