If you are a collector of DVD's such as myself this is a must have.Tyler Perry is making this DVD a movie, and it would be great to have the original classic before you run out and buy the Tyler Perry's movie,you will be able to relate to his movie/characters better. It would be like you read the book before you see the movie.",5,My opinion,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",2010,391,"['enjoyed', 'DVD', 'remembered', 'seeing', 'TV', 'child', 'are', 'collector', 'DVD', 'such', 'must', 'have.Tyler', 'Perry', 'making', 'DVD', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'have', 'original', 'classic', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'movie/characters', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie']",For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf

While scanning Amazon, much to my delight, I found the original PBS  version that I fell in love with. At the time, I had an old Akai (is that company even still around) VHS player that drug on significant parts of the play. But the power of Lynn Whitfield (my introduction) and Alfre Woodward's (also my introduction) performances are undeniable. I remember watching this play repeatedly and being swept by its sad emotive powers. There are so many budding actors that perform in this play version that if it is your first time, you will be impressed.The play is so strong it is hard to imagine that Tyler Perry really does as poor a job directing as early reviews from Variety and Hollywood Reporter are indicating.No one is disputing  the strong acting job in the forthcoming feature film so I am not sure what all the drama is about.But do yourself a favor and take in this version. I am sure it is as good if not better than the forthcoming feature film.",5,A Riveting PBS Re-enactment of a Riveting Play,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",2010,1048,"['Early', 'reviews', 'are', 'seeping', 'feature', 'film', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'version', 'great', 'play', 'scanning', 'Amazon', 'much', 'delight', 'found', 'original', 'PBS', 'version', 'fell', 'love', 'time', 'had', 'old', 'Akai', 'company', 'even', 'still', 'VHS', 'player', 'drug', 'significant', 'parts', 'play', 'power', 'Lynn', 'Whitfield', 'introduction', 'Alfre', 'Woodward', 'also', 'introduction', 'performances', 'are', 'undeniable', 'remember', 'watching', 'play', 'repeatedly', 'being', 'swept', 'sad', 'emotive', 'powers', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'budding', 'actors', 'perform', 'play', 'version', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'impressed.The', 'play', 'so', 'strong', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'really', 'poor', 'job', 'directing', 'early', 'reviews', 'Variety', 'Hollywood', 'Reporter', 'are', 'indicating.No', 'one', 'disputing', 'strong', 'acting', 'job', 'forthcoming', 'feature', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'drama', 'about.But', 'do', 'favor', 'take', 'version', 'am', 'sure', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'forthcoming', 'feature', 'film']",For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf
