475056,A9Y947FCJZPVL,6305733651,Arcadio Bolaos,"[2, 2]","""Be realistic, demand the impossible"". Why not? Sometimes being realistic means, indeed, to have no creative freedom and above all no real desire to escape ideological imprisonment.When Steven, a 16 year old student, starts frequenting public toilets hoping to hook up and have random sex with unknown men, he looks aloof and somehow emotionally unattached. His only confident is Linda, a girl somewhat ostracized because of her weight, and they come to a conclusion: no matter how hard they've tried, love has not been a part of their lives.One day, in one of those public toilets the British seem so keen on visiting, he runs into John, another student from his high school. Except that John is not just another student, he happens to be the Golden Boy, not only is he the best athlete and the most handsome boy, he is also rich and very popular. Of course, John neutralizes possible misunderstandings by explaining that he just happened to be there. When Steven, disappointed and embarrassed, decides to depart, John asks him if his parents are home.In Steven's home, the game commences, or rather, what was already there comes to the surface. When John makes fun of a teddy bear in Steven's room, that soon leads into physical contact as Steven tries to retrieve the object from John's hands. Then, after being on top of each other, breathing hard and unmistakably excited, John proceeds to unbutton Steve's trousers and when they're about to kiss things get interrupted.The interruption is a symptom of society's intervention, which in this case does not take the form of an angry mob but rather the moral constraints that are deeply rooted in John's mind. If the gaze of the other defines us completely, then what must we do to be successfully inserted in society? For traditional psychoanalysis homosexuality has been a perversion, a mental illness, a condition that could be remedied, but it has also been the abject, id est, the vilest, the very lowest of the human condition. I would like to believe that much time has passed since then, but it's undeniable that some people, perhaps more than I would care to admit, continue to think as if they had been raised in the Victorian age.On the contrary, Steven has come to terms with his sexuality since he was 11. He has no doubts, no regrets. He feels only angry at the prejudiced people surrounding him at home, at school and everywhere in between. As his relationship with John progresses, they thrive to keep the secrecy, but the clandestine rendezvous and the constant hiding takes a toll on Steven. As John explains to him, they can do anything they want as long as no one else knows about it.Although at first this is hardly a limitation, soon the nature of the relationship will demand openness. Steven wants John to feel proud of them, of their relationship, he demands John to acknowledge him in school, not only outside. How long can they go keeping the secret? And is it really impossible to declare their love to everyone else? Be realistic, sometimes the impossible simply cannot be demanded for the very reason that it shouldn't have been deemed impossible in the first place.As the impossibility of accepting homosexuality is firmly placed in John's head, things will not be easy. But when other school kids start making enquiries and deductions, the entire relationship could come apart. Does this couple have what it takes to surmount seemingly unconquerable obstacles or was this a doomed affair from the very beginning?",4,"""Be realistic, demand the impossible""",1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,3496,"['Be', 'realistic', 'demand', 'impossible', 'Why', 'not', 'Sometimes', 'being', 'realistic', 'means', 'indeed', 'have', 'creative', 'freedom', 'real', 'desire', 'escape', 'ideological', 'imprisonment.When', 'Steven', '16', 'year', 'old', 'student', 'frequenting', 'public', 'toilets', 'hoping', 'hook', 'up', 'have', 'random', 'sex', 'unknown', 'men', 'aloof', 'somehow', 'emotionally', 'unattached', 'only', 'confident', 'Linda', 'girl', 'somewhat', 'ostracized', 'weight', 'come', 'conclusion', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'love', 'not', 'been', 'part', 'lives.One', 'day', 'one', 'public', 'British', 'seem', 'so', 'keen', 'visiting', 'John', 'student', 'high', 'school', 'John', 'not', 'just', 'student', 'be', 'Golden', 'Boy', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'athlete', 'most', 'handsome', 'boy', 'also', 'rich', 'very', 'popular', 'course', 'John', 'possible', 'misunderstandings', 'explaining', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'there', 'When', 'Steven', 'disappointed', 'embarrassed', 'depart', 'John', 'parents', 'are', 'home.In', 'Steven', 'home', 'game', 'commences', 'rather', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'surface', 'When', 'John', 'fun', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Steven', 'room', 'soon', 'physical', 'contact', 'Steven', 'retrieve', 'object', 'John', 'hands', 'Then', 'being', 'top', 'other', 'breathing', 'hard', 'unmistakably', 'excited', 'John', 'unbutton', 'Steve', 'trousers', 'when', ""'re"", 'kiss', 'things', 'get', 'interrupted.The', 'interruption', 'symptom', 'society', 'intervention', 'case', 'not', 'take', 'form', 'angry', 'mob', 'rather', 'moral', 'constraints', 'are', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'John', 'mind', 'gaze', 'other', 'defines', 'completely', 'then', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'be', 'successfully', 'inserted', 'society', 'traditional', 'psychoanalysis', 'homosexuality', 'been', 'perversion', 'mental', 'illness', 'condition', 'could', 'be', 'remedied', 'also', 'been', 'abject', 'id', 'est', 'vilest', 'very', 'lowest', 'human', 'condition', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'then', 'undeniable', 'people', 'perhaps', 'more', 'would', 'care', 'admit', 'continue', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'Victorian', 'age.On', 'contrary', 'Steven', 'come', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'was', '11', 'doubts', 'regrets', 'only', 'angry', 'prejudiced', 'people', 'surrounding', 'home', 'school', 'everywhere', 'relationship', 'John', 'progresses', 'thrive', 'keep', 'secrecy', 'clandestine', 'rendezvous', 'constant', 'hiding', 'toll', 'Steven', 'John', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'want', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'else', 'it.Although', 'first', 'hardly', 'limitation', 'soon', 'nature', 'relationship', 'will', 'demand', 'openness', 'Steven', 'John', 'feel', 'proud', 'relationship', 'John', 'acknowledge', 'school', 'not', 'only', 'outside', 'How', 'long', 'can', 'go', 'keeping', 'secret', 'really', 'impossible', 'declare', 'love', 'everyone', 'else', 'Be', 'realistic', 'sometimes', 'impossible', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'demanded', 'very', 'reason', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'deemed', 'impossible', 'first', 'impossibility', 'accepting', 'homosexuality', 'firmly', 'placed', 'John', 'head', 'things', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'when', 'other', 'school', 'kids', 'start', 'making', 'enquiries', 'deductions', 'entire', 'relationship', 'could', 'come', 'apart', 'couple', 'have', 'what', 'surmount', 'seemingly', 'unconquerable', 'obstacles', 'was', 'doomed', 'affair', 'very', 'beginning']",Get Real VHS

It is a story of unrequited love with an impossible outcome becoming suddenly a reality with infinite possibilities.  Steven spends time in public toilets seeking gay encounters and he finds them...school uniform and all.  He gets more than he bargained for when John, the school hottie turns up...talk about awkward.  You could suspect a trap, gay bashing, gay outing...but no, John is emabarrassed and awkward.  The relationship starts and stops and stutters.  John wants to pusue Steven but he is the geek, the target of bullying by John's set of friends (the tossers, no that is not what they call themselve it is what they are).  Steven knows who he i (smart, gay, not into sports) , and so does his best friend Linda - played very well. She is the comic counterpoint for the deep and meaningful pathos of the lead characters.  The relationship between the boys develops in secret but it looks set to fizzle into obscurity.  However, the night of the school dance, when Steven has lost all hope John surprises him and the relationship, in all it's glory, begins.  It is a secret of course, only Linda knows, but Steven's mother is becoming aware of the difference and the signs, realising he is gay.  The relationship develops and Steven wants more, he wants equal billing with John's official girlfriend.  There is a cute scene where  John is holding Steven and says ""You need a shave"" and Steven replies ""I shaved last week""...cute, cute, cute.  Steven comes out in an article for the school paper, anonymously.  The article is banned.  Steven is caught smelling John's clothing by the tossers and John.  John deals with Steven by beating him, well so the tossers think.  In fact they are staging the beating...and almost end up kissing.  As the lips are about to lock the lead tosser comes in and catches them, so the beating becomes real so John can cover the love he feels.  Steven then turns up at school assembly, beaten and bloody and outs himself - he does this while accepting a prize in front of dignitaries, staff, parents and the whole school.  Shock, horror, acceptance and rejection ensue.  By outing himself he has severed the relationship with John because John cannot face the shame and say he is gay - his parents and friends and the world have expecations of their bright light and he doesn't have the courage to say ""That is not all there is to me, I am gay as well...not instead of, but as well"".  Steven did.  There is no happy ending between the boys.  John looking into the empty future without Steven, instead he has accolades and academia waiting...but not the love of a good boy...  And Steven goes off into a future where he looks strong and as though the weight has been lifted.  He is out and he is proud and he is who he is, no apologies.  I recommend this...whatever age you are.  It makes me smile...it reminds me of Beautiful Thing, I recommend you look at that too:-)Beautiful Thing",5,"Get This!

Guy one is gay and fine with it, guy two is a closeted athlete with uptight parents.  They have sex, guy one falls in love with guy two who can't commit because he's too uptight, got too much to lose, and therefore a jerk.  Guy one gets in trouble when word gets around his student body that he's gay, then he starts getting ostracized and everybody's just MEAN about it.  They have a &quot;tell-all&quot; climax, where guy one declares his love for guy two in front of the whole student body (kinda like that other really believable scene in &quot;In and Out.&quot;)  Guy two tries to get back together with guy one, but it's too late, guy one has regained his self-worth and isn't going back to hang with some guy who betrayed him.  I guess it's a milestone of some kind that this movie, which would have been really tedious and trite with straight characters, was made at all, but folks, if we're going to try to break new ground, couldn't we have a less predictable plot?

Steven is a somewhat precocious teenager who is braving the local ""lav"" (tearoom) to meet men. Naturally, society presents encouragement only for hetero- relationships so this appears to be the best Steven can do to meet somebody.  He does have an encounter with a man which he escalates (in his mind) as a wonderful new opportunity for romantic opportunity.  Unfortunately, life doesn't allow things to happen so easily for most people.  A bit later, Steven is ""trying anew,"" but this time, things are very different.  The story takes a very new and exciting course which I won't further elaborate except to say everything throughout this movie is extremely 'Real'-to-life. If you're not gay, you will get a much clearer understanding of the difficulties gay males, in particular, suffer due to a society that generally condones and/or encourages some, if not all of the discriminatory treatment you will witness here.  There is definitely some comedy, twists, turns and very tender moments as well.  Another great film of this genre is ""Beautiful Thing"" which I highly recommend.

It properly (to me) illustrated how teens think, what their lives are like to some small degree, and how they serve their own needs.Steve is a gay kid, closeted and non-suspected of being so, but nonetheless persecuted as a gay kid by the school jock/bullies.After classes at his school, Steve often cruises the local park bathroom for sexual encounters.  The typical 16yo, he interprets the encounters as being based on love and ends up hurting himself in the process...and building his despair.One day, chance would have him meet John, a school mate and star football (soccer for us yanks) player at the toilets.A friendship begins, with John finally trying to break out of his shell.

475071,AAT2JIIADQDUP,6305733651,"DJ McGovern ""Derek McGovern""","[12, 12]","This highly realistic movie is the kind of film-making that the Brits excel in. Presumably made on a showstring budget, there is, however, nothing undernourished about the performances, scriptwriting or direction of this genuine classic.Patrick Wilde has fashioned a hugely entertaining *and* thought-provoking screenplay from his play, What's Wrong With Angry? Yet to his credit, there is nothing stagey about this movie. Some of the kudos must go to first-time director Simon Shore, who has created a tightly paced (and often suspenseful) movie with one memorable scene after another. This is a film with real atmosphere - witness the way he lights the scenes in the swimming pool and the woods, with mood music to match.But what makes the movie a masterpiece of its genre is the performance of its central actor, Ben Silverstone. This 18-year-old is an acting genius. He walks such a tightrope of emotions (some likeable; others less so), yet carries the audience with him at every turn. It's impossible not be drawn into his plight as he struggles to maintain his sense of self in an overwhelmingly heterosexual (and, at times, hostile) society. He is amazing, and it will be fascinating to follow what should be an outstanding career. His co-star, Brad Gorton, is good (notwithstanding the occasional awkward moment) but Silverstone's worthiest co-star is the wonderful Charlotte Brittain, in the role of his cheerfully fat confidante. The rapport between the two is a joy to watch, and Wilde provides them with some of the sharpest dialogue you're likely to hear in a youth-oriented movie.The good that this movie will do for gay people struggling with self-acceptance is incalculable. Many have referred to Beautiful Thing as the superior film, but for my money Get Real has the script and magnetic performances to reach out to audiences both gay and straight in a way that no other film has achieved. It's simply the most accessible ""gay"" movie I've ever seen.Why Ben Silverstone was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me!",5,A coming-of-age classic,1000425600,"09 14, 2001",2001,2032,"['highly', 'realistic', 'movie', 'kind', 'film-making', 'Brits', 'excel', 'Presumably', 'made', 'showstring', 'budget', 'however', 'nothing', 'undernourished', 'performances', 'scriptwriting', 'direction', 'genuine', 'classic.Patrick', 'Wilde', 'fashioned', 'hugely', 'entertaining', '*and*', 'thought-provoking', 'screenplay', 'play', 'What', 'Wrong', 'Angry', 'credit', 'nothing', 'stagey', 'movie', 'kudos', 'must', 'go', 'first-time', 'director', 'Simon', 'Shore', 'who', 'created', 'tightly', 'paced', 'often', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'film', 'real', 'atmosphere', 'witness', 'way', 'scenes', 'swimming', 'pool', 'woods', 'mood', 'music', 'match.But', 'what', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'genre', 'performance', 'central', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Silverstone', '18-year-old', 'acting', 'genius', 'walks', 'tightrope', 'emotions', 'likeable', 'others', 'less', 'so', 'audience', 'turn', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'plight', 'maintain', 'sense', 'self', 'overwhelmingly', 'heterosexual', 'times', 'hostile', 'society', 'amazing', 'will', 'be', 'fascinating', 'follow', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'outstanding', 'career', 'co-star', 'Brad', 'Gorton', 'good', 'notwithstanding', 'occasional', 'awkward', 'moment', 'Silverstone', 'worthiest', 'co-star', 'wonderful', 'Charlotte', 'Brittain', 'role', 'cheerfully', 'fat', 'confidante', 'rapport', 'two', 'joy', 'watch', 'Wilde', 'sharpest', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'likely', 'hear', 'youth-oriented', 'movie.The', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'do', 'gay', 'people', 'struggling', 'self-acceptance', 'incalculable', 'Many', 'have', 'referred', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'superior', 'film', 'money', 'Get', 'Real', 'script', 'magnetic', 'performances', 'reach', 'out', 'audiences', 'gay', 'straight', 'way', 'other', 'film', 'achieved', 'simply', 'most', 'accessible', 'gay', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Why', 'Ben', 'Silverstone', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'Oscar']",Get Real VHS

Litton,"[4, 5]","In a decade full of straight-boy-meets-straight-girl comedies and dramas, where the two always end up living happily ever after, Simon Shore's  &quot;Get Real&quot; is a complete and utter sigh of relief. The film tells  the story of Steven Carter, a closeted high school student diving into the  world of sexual discovery with men he meets at public bathrooms (all  implied, no action, which can be good or bad, depending on who you are). Hs  stress over being closeted (Steven is only out to his friend, the hilarious  Linda), accompanied by his quest to find love, interferes with his  schoolwork and family life, though never raising too many suspicions by  outside parties. By chance, Steven happens to meet a fellow student at the  public bathroom, a soccer jock by the name of John Dixon, and the two of  them become uncomfortable around each other until a school dance, at which  they become locked in a glance. This begins the start of their  relationship, and while Steven would like to make known his newfound  happiness, John insists that they must keep it underwraps or it is off. The  fun and the fears of coming out and closeted life play out hilariously and  surprisingly touching in this charming, witty comedy about the ills and  thrills of gay adolescence. Patrick Wilde's screenplay is brilliantly  directedby Simon Shore, and beautifully acted by top-notch young Brit  actors. Ben Silverstone gives a stellar performance as Steven, playing out  each emotion and feeling to perfection. The story will touch all those, as  well as give people a lesson in tolerance and acceptance. &quot;Get  Real&quot; will open new windows in your mind as well as split your sides,  and should not be missed by anyone, especially gay youth.",5,"&quot;Get Real&quot; gets with the times, and does it right.",965779200,"08 9, 2000",2000,1744,"['decade', 'full', 'straight-boy-meets-straight-girl', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'where', 'two', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'happily', 'ever', 'Simon', 'Shore', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'complete', 'utter', 'sigh', 'relief', 'film', 'story', 'Steven', 'Carter', 'closeted', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'diving', 'world', 'sexual', 'discovery', 'men', 'public', 'bathrooms', 'implied', 'action', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'who', 'are', 'Hs', 'stress', 'being', 'closeted', 'Steven', 'only', 'out', 'friend', 'hilarious', 'Linda', 'accompanied', 'quest', 'find', 'love', 'schoolwork', 'family', 'life', 'though', 'never', 'raising', 'too', 'many', 'suspicions', 'outside', 'parties', 'chance', 'Steven', 'meet', 'fellow', 'student', 'public', 'bathroom', 'soccer', 'jock', 'name', 'John', 'Dixon', 'two', 'become', 'uncomfortable', 'other', 'school', 'dance', 'become', 'locked', 'glance', 'start', 'relationship', 'Steven', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'known', 'newfound', 'happiness', 'John', 'must', 'keep', 'underwraps', 'off', 'fun', 'fears', 'coming', 'out', 'closeted', 'life', 'play', 'hilariously', 'surprisingly', 'touching', 'charming', 'witty', 'comedy', 'ills', 'thrills', 'gay', 'adolescence', 'Patrick', 'Wilde', 'screenplay', 'brilliantly', 'directedby', 'Simon', 'Shore', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'top-notch', 'young', 'Brit', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Silverstone', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Steven', 'playing', 'out', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'perfection', 'story', 'will', 'touch', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'people', 'lesson', 'tolerance', 'acceptance', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'will', 'open', 'new', 'windows', 'mind', 'as', 'well', 'split', 'sides', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'especially', 'gay', 'youth']",Get Real VHS

Kinda' pitiful, but what can I say?The film is a coming-of-age tale about high school student Steven Carter (played by Ben Silverstone).  He is 16 and when the movie starts he can be found cruising of the neighborhood park bathrooms.  He has admitted to himself that he is gay, and I suppose ""any port in a storm,"" huh?  The only other person he has told his secret to is his best friend and neighbor, Linda (played by Charlotte Brittain).  Charlotte chides him for his indiscretions at the bathroom, but he urges her that he is ALWAYS safe.  Yes, we all know what kind of safe sex goes on in bathrooms.  Durinig one of his trysts, he accidentally hooks up with one of the high school jocks (played by Brad Gordon) who has managed up to this point to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to his jock friends bullying Steven.I really wanted to like this film.  I--and I'm sure many others who read this--went through a lot of what Steven's character goes through; however, I NEVER sought solace in a public bathroom.  After the initial tryst, the movie then settles into a very run of the mill visualization of scenes:  gay boy falls for jock, who is also gay but VERY closeted, they ""frolic,"" are caught in lies, outted by the school newspaper, jock then hits/leaves gay boy, gay boy makes speech at graduation, ZZZZzzzzzzzzz...The reason it was difficult for me to like this movie (and I do NOT recommend it) was because the actors--try as they might--could not deliver believable enough performances.  Silverstone's attempt albeit feeble at breaking down during his speech was just that--feeble--as was Brad Gordon's attempt to explain his feelings.  Both actors managed ""sobs"" but there were not tears.  Steven's coming out speech contained so many pointed questions, but they were not delivered with any real emotion.The movie is rated R for brief nudity, language, and sexual situations.  Run time is 1 hour and 50 minutes.

Giving the year, 1998, and the setting, UK, I'm not surprise the movie is not entirely ""happily ever after"", UK movies tend to be a little more realistic and not really light, but in any case Steven and John share their romantic high school romance and maybe for Steven it will be a nice love story he will sweetly remember when he will be older. On the contrary of many gay teen characters of other movies, at 16 years old Steven is sexually active and even if he is not able to find a boyfriend (living in a little town and being gay is not easy), he cruises the public park and the near woods: not really safe, but for sure a place where he can at least unload a bit of energy. Here he finds John, all-jock-beautiful-bod-wet-dream student at his same high school. Even if John seems older and more mature than Steven, he is instead still in that phase when he doesn't know how to address his sexual urges for his same sex. Steven will help John and at the same time he will realize his high school romance, but it's pretty clear that this cannot be a long-term relationship, at least not until John will be able to admit that what he is feeling for Steven is not a phase.

Based on the very well written &quot;What's Wrong with this Play?&quot;, there are too many monologues and unlikely elements to translate to a sceen version smoothly (one in particular where one of the characters relates his first almost sexual experience, which goes on so long that you just want to fast forward thru it). The story centers around Steve, a 16 year old thoroughly accepting of his own homesexuality and sort of a &quot;geek&quot;, and John, the &quot;sex on legs&quot; school track star. John has never had a real sexual experience with a man, and, though very uncomfortable with his sexuality, very confidently picks up Steve in a public toilet in the park famous for one-off gay sex(one of the unlikely elements). John freaks out, however, after kissing Steve in his bedroom (why a guy who is comfortable enough to cruise a toilet would, I don't know), and he and Steve never quite get anywhere during their first encounter. Steve has been having sex in the park with older (mostly married ) men for ages, but this is the first time he has met anyone he harbors real feelings for. The only one who is aware of Steve's proclivities is Linda, written as the quintessential fag-hag (fat, loud, and slightly over the top in fashion sense), who worries about his adventures in the park. John gets drunk one night at a party, follows Steve home, and the two develop things from there....This film may have been better for me had I not seen &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;, another teen-coming out story. Unlike &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot;, the characters in &quot;Get Real&quot; all seem written with heterosexual stereotypes of gay characters (and their friends) in mind. John, the &quot;sex on legs&quot; track star, Steve, the &quot;pervert&quot; who frequents toilets in the park, Linda, the stereotypical fag hag. As they are all charicatures, you don't really get too sympathetic for any of them, and therefore don't get engrossed in the story. Finally, the two monologues, one by John describing his first semi-sexual encounter with a man, and one by Steve in front of his school assembly, presumably the two scenes designed to have the greatest emotional impact, fall absolutely flat since the actors themselves don't seem to know how to emotionally handle their own parts.I strongly recommend that you see &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; instead, or at least see &quot;Get Real&quot; before you see the better of the two. While both deal with teen coming out issues, &quot;Get Real&quot; is a bit too clich&eacute;d, and might actually be more frightening than necessary, whereas &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; deals with the subject in an almost realistic fashion, with more sensitivity expressed by characters with more than just two dimensions.",3,"Good movie, but &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; is much better",974592000,"11 19, 2000",2000,2830,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'However', 'problems', 'Based', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'quot', 'What', 'Wrong', 'Play', 'quot', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'monologues', 'unlikely', 'elements', 'translate', 'sceen', 'version', 'smoothly', 'one', 'particular', 'where', 'one', 'characters', 'first', 'almost', 'sexual', 'experience', 'so', 'long', 'just', 'want', 'fast', 'forward', 'story', 'centers', 'Steve', '16', 'year', 'old', 'thoroughly', 'accepting', 'own', 'homesexuality', 'sort', 'quot', 'quot', 'John', 'quot', 'sex', 'legs', 'quot', 'school', 'track', 'star', 'John', 'never', 'had', 'real', 'sexual', 'experience', 'man', 'though', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'sexuality', 'very', 'confidently', 'up', 'Steve', 'public', 'toilet', 'park', 'famous', 'one-off', 'gay', 'sex', 'one', 'unlikely', 'elements', 'John', 'out', 'however', 'kissing', 'Steve', 'bedroom', 'why', 'guy', 'who', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'cruise', 'toilet', 'would', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Steve', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'anywhere', 'first', 'encounter', 'Steve', 'been', 'having', 'sex', 'park', 'older', 'mostly', 'married', 'men', 'ages', 'first', 'time', 'met', 'anyone', 'real', 'feelings', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'aware', 'Steve', 'proclivities', 'Linda', 'written', 'quintessential', 'fag-hag', 'fat', 'loud', 'slightly', 'top', 'fashion', 'sense', 'who', 'adventures', 'park', 'John', 'drunk', 'one', 'night', 'party', 'Steve', 'home', 'two', 'develop', 'things', '.This', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'quot', 'teen-coming', 'out', 'story', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'quot', 'characters', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'seem', 'written', 'heterosexual', 'stereotypes', 'gay', 'characters', 'friends', 'mind', 'John', 'quot', 'sex', 'legs', 'quot', 'star', 'Steve', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'toilets', 'park', 'Linda', 'stereotypical', 'fag', 'hag', 'are', 'charicatures', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'therefore', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'engrossed', 'story', 'Finally', 'two', 'monologues', 'one', 'John', 'describing', 'first', 'semi-sexual', 'encounter', 'man', 'one', 'Steve', 'front', 'school', 'assembly', 'presumably', 'two', 'scenes', 'designed', 'have', 'greatest', 'emotional', 'impact', 'fall', 'absolutely', 'flat', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'emotionally', 'handle', 'own', 'parts.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'see', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'quot', 'instead', 'least', 'see', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'see', 'better', 'two', 'deal', 'teen', 'coming', 'out', 'issues', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'bit', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'might', 'actually', 'be', 'more', 'frightening', 'necessary', 'whereas', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'Thing', 'quot', 'deals', 'subject', 'almost', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'more', 'sensitivity', 'expressed', 'characters', 'more', 'just', 'two', 'dimensions']",Get Real VHS

475084,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6305733651,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 0]","Extremely well acted with young actors that know their job: to make us believe the story is true, is what happens everyday now and then and from time to time more often than we think. Secondary schools of any type are big boxes where there are plenty of closets and they tie up and throw those they don't like in those closets for them to rot, to cry, to suffer, to be miserable. Don't believe one moment it is only a question of sexual orientation. It can be the way you dress, the music you listen to, or even for teachers the way you speak to the students or the way you may put your hand on the students' shoulders.This film is perfect and so British indeed. It touches the right points and it plucks the right strings. How can a 16 year old young man, or boy if you prefer, come out of the closet and just trust himself, trust his family, trust his school, trust the world even, and know he will be accepted the way he is and the way he feels happy? That's the worst part of it. Of course the parents know there is something bothering the boy, or the young man if you prefer. Of course the teachers feel it too and even know it. The other students just feel it, decide that it is what they feel it is, and most of them, at least most of those who will say anything, will condemn the young man, or the boy if you prefer. And don't even imagine it is not the same thing for girls, or young women if you prefer.But at the same time the only way to get out of the closet is to open the door with a bang and to let everyone know that from now on they better not walk on the boy's, or the young man's if you prefer, prick and even raise one single finger to block the way, otherwise their ""cubes"" as they say in CSI will be mashed to a pulp. It takes crazy courage for the first one. It takes courage for the one hundred next ones and when you reach one thousand you can finally start finding it nearly natural. But it will be natural only when you reach the million of out-of-the-closet-tall-walkers. And tall you need to walk.I regret that this simple question of the freedom to love who you want to love and who wants to love you back, no matter who that one is has become a religious question, a political question, a philosophical question, or whatever other label you can put on that. It is none of these and it is no other classification you may invent. It is only a question of sentiments, feelings, emotions, passions, empathy and liberty. It is a basic human right. Everyone has the right to love everyone else who accepts that love and loves them back.I have been dealing with men, or women, in the closet, no matter what closet it may be, all my life. Some of my university professor colleagues told me I was not supposed to know who is Jewish, who is Moslem, who is LGBT, or whatever, and that the students are not supposed to tell. Some professors are still living on the ""don't ask don't tell"" syndrome, you know that cowardly compromise Bill Clinton invented to make everyone forget what was happening at the time in the Oval Office.And now this DADT shameful legislation has been dropped all the fundamentalist brains in the world consider marriage is for sex and sex is for procreation, and that there is no other dimension in sex and in marriage. As you can see love has disappeared for these brains that are indeed no brains. You make love but you do not love. For them everyone on this planet, and sooner or later they are going to extend this silly ideology to the moon or to mars, has to wear the only penguin costume that is allowed by the necessity to make spermatozoa and eggs meet and fertilize each other. If you use a French letter, not to say a condom, a pill of any sort, a diaphragm or, horrible horror of horrors, vanity of vanities, an abortion you become a killer, a murderer, an assassin, some one who should be stoned on market day on the market square in every village or neighbourhood in the world.Yeah it is nothing but love and love is a passion, an emotion, a feeling, a sentiment, something that makes your mind rev up and then take off at cosmic speed and in that phenomenal power and force there might be for some a sexual dimension but there is no obligation for that dimension to exist and be experienced by all the people who are in love, who love one another. To make love is not even a plus. It is another dimension because then you lose your head, you loosen your mind and you blaze your soul tracks to let your hormones take over and your endocrine glands, you may chose the one you prefer, empty themselves.Actually it seems to be a syndrome that concerns the fundamentalists because for them love cannot exist outside the only sexual relation they accept - read my lips even if my mouth is full - and anything that is pricking outside and on the side of this square definition makes them retch: the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them, and I applaud all those who make them vomit proving that for them it is always a question of emptying the endocrine glands, but in their case the wrong ones and the wrong way.Dr Jacques COULARDEA",5,God has created us to love our

Of course, it DOES help if  the hunk of your dreams (Brad Gorton) is wildly attracted to and completely  in love with you.  But, when only your Aretha Franklin-loving, horribly  stuck in the 80s, desperate-to-drive, &quot;cuddly&quot; friend Linda  (Charlotte Brittain - the epitome of &quot;fag hag&quot;) knows about your  episodes pulling tricks with strangers in public toilets, it's hard to stay  quiet once you ARE in love.  You've got to hide it, keep it inside, even  though you're practically ready to shout it out to the world.  And that is  the predicament of young Stephen (Silverstone) in this amazing depiction of  falling in love and coming out as a gay youth in the 90s.  From being  worried about getting &quot;gay-bashed by squirrels&quot; to lamenting  about the &quot;sex on legs&quot; he thinks is SO inaccessible, and on to  averting the attention of female admirers away from him so he can focus on  what he truly wants, Stephen shows us the troublesome side of his secrets  but in a often humorous, and always heartwarming fashion.  His lover, John  Dixon (Gorton), gives us the side of fearing being out while still craving  a forbidden love in the worst way.  And, in the end, we may not be  completely happy with what we see, but we can only imagine what the future  holds for Stephen, John, and Linda.  All in all, this film is perfect.  Whether you're gay, bisexual, straight, or whatever, rent it a few times,  or buy it, and learn how beautiful falling in love can truly be.

Perhaps this makes me a little biased when reviewing 'Get Real', although I suspect those that watch will not be disappointed. The story is a little stayed, in that there is very little which we have not seen or heard before, but what makes this version so different is the lead actor Ben Silverstone. If there is a single reason for watching this movie, it is to see his enigmatic performance.For such a young actor in such a difficult genre, he has achieved what many senior actors spend life times trying to achieve. A single performance which echoes throughout ones acting career, and which elevates you regardless of how you perform thereafter.The cast in general is very good. Together they portray the innocence, endemic cruelty and frivolity of youth, without negating the importance of the story. The story in turn is a challenge to get real, and accept what one is despite what society would have you be. Unfortunately, as in many truths there are few courageous enough to stand against a sea of adversity, hypocritical judgment and societal norms.Brad may be the hero in the eyes of the school body, in that he fits the measure against which society makes such heroes. Good looking, sporty and in authority he is both coveted and admired. Steven is the exact opposite, and despite his inner strength, personal convictions and overwhelming courage, he is not considered for hero status. When Brad crumbles into the weak, deceptive person that he is, Steve emerges as the only person prepared to be real both to himself and the world.If only we would make heroes of those that deserve such title.",5,How sexy is Durham!,1277424000,"06 25, 2010",2010,1736,"['have', 'thing', 'County', 'Durham', 'find', 'people', 'calming', 'sexy', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'soothing', 'sweet', 'accent', 'Perhaps', 'little', 'biased', 'when', 'reviewing', ""'Get"", 'Real', 'suspect', 'watch', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'story', 'little', 'stayed', 'very', 'little', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'what', 'version', 'so', 'different', 'lead', 'actor', 'Ben', 'Silverstone', 'single', 'reason', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'enigmatic', 'performance.For', 'young', 'actor', 'such', 'difficult', 'genre', 'achieved', 'what', 'many', 'senior', 'actors', 'spend', 'life', 'times', 'trying', 'achieve', 'single', 'performance', 'ones', 'acting', 'career', 'regardless', 'how', 'perform', 'thereafter.The', 'cast', 'general', 'very', 'good', 'Together', 'portray', 'innocence', 'endemic', 'cruelty', 'frivolity', 'youth', 'negating', 'importance', 'story', 'story', 'turn', 'challenge', 'get', 'real', 'accept', 'what', 'one', 'what', 'society', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'truths', 'are', 'few', 'courageous', 'enough', 'stand', 'sea', 'adversity', 'hypocritical', 'judgment', 'societal', 'norms.Brad', 'may', 'be', 'hero', 'eyes', 'school', 'body', 'measure', 'society', 'such', 'heroes', 'Good', 'looking', 'sporty', 'authority', 'coveted', 'admired', 'Steven', 'exact', 'opposite', 'inner', 'strength', 'personal', 'convictions', 'overwhelming', 'courage', 'not', 'considered', 'hero', 'status', 'When', 'Brad', 'weak', 'deceptive', 'person', 'Steve', 'only', 'person', 'prepared', 'be', 'real', 'world.If', 'only', 'would', 'make', 'heroes', 'deserve', 'such', 'title']",Get Real VHS

475096,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6305733651,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[5, 6]","Simon Shore manages a smooth transition from television and documentary filmmaking to feature films with his debut, the captivating and engrossing gay teen comedy Get Real, based on Patrick Wilde's stage success, What's Wrong with Anger? Shore recounts an appealing tale of a teenaged schoolboy coming to grips with his emerging sexuality. Sixteen-year-old Steven is just another teenager: He listens to the latest music, plays computer games, hangs out with friends. But Steven has a secret: He's in love with the school's top athlete, the devastatingly handsome John Dixon, who reminds me of a young Christian Bale. Not surprisingly, Dixon is dating a model and is the object of every girl's attention. Steven certainly can't tell his parents, and none of his friends know he's gay; he can only confide in his best pal, the overweight, feisty Linda, who wants a romance of her own. As if this weren't complicated enough, Steven discovers that one of the girls at school has developed a crush on him. And then Dixon notices Steven's attention. Shore and his cast of youngsters do a wonderful job of capturing the secret lives of his teenage characters. He penetrates the hearts and minds of people trying to understand their complex sexual yearnings, while compensating for the expectations of parents, friends, and society. Fresh, youthful, and invigorating, Get Real establishes its moving tone from the beginning and doesn't let go; it takes an incisive voyage into the world of a gay teenager trying to tell the world that there's nothing wrong with being in love. This film was strongly recommended to me and I'm glad it was. It's an inspiring and insightful view into young gay life.

The story is gritty, witty, funny, touching, and true. It's about being in the closet (whether you're married or just in high  school), and the painful process of deciding to come out -- or not. Steve  (Ben Silverstone) knows he's gay but, isolated by his feelings, only has  secretive, anonymous sex. Johnny (Brad Gorton) is the handsome high-school  hero headed for Oxford. He is paralyzed by fear and loneliness, being so  deeply in the closet. They accidentally hook up in a public bathroom and,  despite Johnny's misgivings, eventually get together. Their moments of  private happiness -- understated, gentle, and sweet -- are among the  loveliest on screen. Affectionate and comfortable when they are alone, the  jock is also terrified that their 'secret' will come out, and he has a very  hard time dealing with Steve's gradual emergence from hiding. One hopes for  their union but can, at the same time, see the fall coming. Johnny is  ultimately a coward, his heroics on the sports field notwithstanding. The  straight men, in general, do not come off at all well. Steve's father is  withdrawn and unsupportive, though we are given to believe that he will  come around. The high school boys are, without exception, mindless jerks.  Certainly, Pre-Stonewall, Steve could never have 'come out' on film, much  less at his high school awards ceremony! But, that having been said, it is  apparently just as dangerous and terrifying for young people now -- in a  still-repressed, still-suppressed, and violently homophobic society -- as  it ever has been.

475102,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,6305733651,Michael J. Mazza,"[31, 32]","""Get Real"" is a great gay coming-of-age story. This British film has a screenplay by Patrick Wilde and is directed by Simon Shore. It stars Ben Silverstone as Steven Carter, a teenage schoolboy who's looking for gay love and sex. He's only out of the closet to his friend Linda (played by Charlotte Brittain), who feels like an outsider herself because of her large weight. The film follows Steven as he deals with the joys, pain, and frustration of being a gay youth.""Get Real"" certainly touches on some controversial issues, such as teenage sexual activity and public ""cruising"" for sex. But I believe the filmmakers handle these and other issues with intelligence and sensitivity. Stephen is a writer, so the role of the student press is also a factor in the story.Wilde's script has some really engrossing dialogue, and Shore directs his scenes with grace and skill. Classic songs are cleverly used throughout the film to underscore the characters' emotional states.It's the outstanding performances of ""Get Real"" that really make this film excellent. Silverstone shines in the title role; he brings a rich blend of strength, vulnerability, impishness, and sexual energy to his character. Much of the film rests on his shoulders, and he succeeds totally. Silverstone has great onscreen chemistry with gal pal Brittain, who brings a nice dash of spice to her character. Other strong performances are turned in by Brad Gorton (as the school jock who is the object of Steve's affection) and Jacquetta May (as Steve's mother).""Get Real"" is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film, but it is also a film which deals with serious sociological issues in a compelling and compassionate way. The film vividly explores the burdens faced by gay youth: homophobic harrassment from classmates, internalized homophobia, etc. But ultimately I found this to be an uplifting and hopeful film.

It's about some alternate-world Britain where Stonewall never happened, so there are no gay organizations, no gay publications, no gay pride festivals, nothing except anonymous encounters in public toilets. Ben Silverstone plays the only gay student in his large urban high school, an extremely feminine young man who plasters his bedroom with pictures of football jocks, yet is horrified by the idea that his parents might find out he is gay (surely any parent would have figured that out years ago).He begins a relationship with the local jock, who is so horrified by the idea of anybody ""finding out"" that he won't acknowledge Ben's presence in public, continues to date his old girlfriend, and even beats Ben up to prove to his high school cronies that he hates gay people. Of course, he does: he hates himself. But Ben is no model for gay pride either, since after all no gay pride exists in this weird alternate world, just furtive encounters and worries that someone might find out.In the U.S. and in Britain, there are gay-straight alliances in hundreds of high schools, chapters of PFLAG and MCC in even the tiniest of towns, hundreds of organizations for gay teenagers.

Funny & moving, the film deals with its subject and characters with thoughtful sensitivity. The tender scene when closeted/terrified school athlete John Dixon confesses his feelings & inner conflict to average but sweet Steven Carter is beautifully done. But soon after John & Steven become a couple, the anguish begins: secret rendevous, close calls with the law (and friends) and overlapping stories to cover their tracks gradually paint  them into a corner. The climactic scene is absolutely startling & emotionally powerful as Steven summons up the courage to come out to the entire school. Could you imagine doing THIS in front of your classmates & faculty? The filmmakers obviously took artistic license for maximum effect, but it's still a great scene. And the prom dance in which John & Steven slow dance with their own female partners but lock eyes wantingly with each other from across the room says it all.But that final scene which Steven walks away from the relationship is so heart rending, yet it's a move Steven MUST do in order to go on with his life. Although ""Get Real"" has a few cliches---the caring/savvy Mum, the lunkheaded Dad who's so focused on other things that he can't put two-and-two together on his son, and of course, the chubby but intelligent friend who strikes out on love but strikes with a sharp tongue---the film succeeds in telling its story anyway.Simply put, ""Get Real"" has a great cast, a great script, and great direction.If only more U.S. films could handle their content more deftly as this special British import does!",5,"""Get Real"" shows the pitfalls of  being a gay teen.",1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1623,"['film', 'top', 'heap', 'Gay', 'Movie', 'List', 'Funny', 'moving', 'film', 'deals', 'subject', 'characters', 'thoughtful', 'sensitivity', 'tender', 'scene', 'when', 'closeted/terrified', 'school', 'athlete', 'John', 'Dixon', 'feelings', 'inner', 'conflict', 'average', 'sweet', 'Steven', 'Carter', 'beautifully', 'done', 'soon', 'John', 'Steven', 'become', 'couple', 'anguish', 'begins', 'secret', 'rendevous', 'close', 'calls', 'law', 'friends', 'overlapping', 'stories', 'cover', 'tracks', 'gradually', 'paint', 'corner', 'climactic', 'scene', 'absolutely', 'startling', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'Steven', 'up', 'courage', 'come', 'out', 'entire', 'school', 'Could', 'imagine', 'doing', 'THIS', 'front', 'classmates', 'faculty', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'took', 'artistic', 'license', 'maximum', 'effect', 'still', 'great', 'scene', 'prom', 'dance', 'John', 'Steven', 'slow', 'dance', 'own', 'female', 'partners', 'lock', 'eyes', 'wantingly', 'other', 'room', 'final', 'scene', 'Steven', 'away', 'relationship', 'so', 'heart', 'rending', 'move', 'Steven', 'MUST', 'do', 'order', 'go', 'life', 'Get', 'Real', 'few', 'cliches', '-the', 'caring/savvy', 'Mum', 'lunkheaded', 'Dad', 'who', 'so', 'focused', 'other', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'two-and-two', 'together', 'son', 'course', 'chubby', 'intelligent', 'friend', 'who', 'out', 'love', 'strikes', 'sharp', 'tongue', '-the', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'anyway.Simply', 'put', 'Get', 'Real', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'direction.If', 'only', 'more', 'U.S.', 'films', 'could', 'handle', 'content', 'more', 'deftly', 'special', 'British', 'import']",Get Real VHS

This movie isn't about only sex, like &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, it's about true, innocent love, like &quot;Beautiful Thing.&quot; Except,  this film is 10 times better than &quot;Beautiful Thing.&quot;I loved  this film because I could relate to it on a small degree. Everything the  the characters do, I wish I had done with a perticular boy in high school.  But fear kept me from doing it. This film was my way to live out what I  didn't experience.My boyfriend, on the other hand, was able to live out  what he desired. When the film was over, he was very upset. The film was a  direct parallel to his life.

Alternately funny and sad,this bittersweet tale of a gay male teenager coming to terms with his own sexuality and all the potential minefields that he must tread through along the way is both heartwarming and thought provoking. Most of us,gay or straight,can identify with the perils that we all faced in our own adolescent years;peer pressure,being popular or trying to be,secret crushes and sexual awakening. Ben Silverstone catches all of the intricacy and insecurities,ambivalence and trepidation perfectly. We find ourselves caught up in his quest for love and acceptance and alternately cry and cheer him onward as he finally comes to realize that love is a complicated and precarious undertaking. At the end though,the character that he plays,Steven Carter,has become stronger and more secure by publicly proclaiming to one and all who is and no longer putting up the facade that has become tiresome.

This is a foreign, gay romantic movie with the depth that isn't found in Hollywood movies.There is subtly in all the underlying story currents...the overweight best friend...the parents...the anonymous meetings in the park.  The story isn't exaggerated as a Hollywood movie would be and the ending isn't as fairytale-like.But that is where this movie outshines most movies.  It is more down to earth, more real, and more life-like.  The slow development of Steven and John's relationship leads into those hot and heavy, desperate meetings on the sly.  John, the seemingly strong jock, is the one who constantly questions himself and his feelings, while sweet and not so innocent Steven has jumped right into the gay life.I suppose you could say the parents are stereotypically played out where the mother is already aware of and accepting of her son's homosexuality and the father is distinct and reluctant to the idea.
