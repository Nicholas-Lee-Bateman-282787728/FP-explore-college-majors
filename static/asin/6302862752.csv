341301,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,6302862752,A. Gammill,"[3, 3]","These days, 80's movies are much-maligned.  And watching movies like The Slugger's Wife, you gotta admit, a lot of stuff from back then is hard to watch.  But I think this one holds up reasonably well.  Movies based on Neil Simon plays were popular in the seventies, but were a bit hit-and-miss by 1985 (see also:Brighton Beach Memoirs,Biloxi Blues).  Anyway, the prime reason to catch this one--or at least it was the prime reason some two decades ago--is Rebecca DeMornay.  Although it would be a stretch call her a great actress, the title role her suits her talents.  And yes, that really is her singing (I'm a little ashamed to admit I have the soundtrack on cassette somewhere).  As someone else has pointed out, the keyboard-heavy soundtrack does hopelessly date the film.But if you long for a simpler time, when movies wanted nothing more than just ENTERTAIN you for a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than The Slugger's Wife.",3,Forgotten 80's romantic comedy is a guilty pleasure,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,943,"['days', '80', 'movies', 'are', 'much-maligned', 'watching', 'movies', 'Slugger', 'Wife', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'lot', 'stuff', 'back', 'then', 'hard', 'watch', 'think', 'one', 'reasonably', 'well', 'Movies', 'based', 'Neil', 'Simon', 'plays', 'were', 'popular', 'seventies', 'were', 'bit', 'hit-and-miss', '1985', 'see', 'also', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'Memoirs', 'Biloxi', 'Blues', 'Anyway', 'prime', 'reason', 'catch', 'one', 'least', 'was', 'prime', 'reason', 'two', 'decades', 'ago', 'Rebecca', 'DeMornay', 'would', 'be', 'stretch', 'call', 'great', 'actress', 'title', 'role', 'suits', 'talents', 'yes', 'really', 'singing', ""'m"", 'little', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'cassette', 'somewhere', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'keyboard-heavy', 'soundtrack', 'hopelessly', 'date', 'film.But', 'long', 'simpler', 'time', 'when', 'movies', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'just', 'ENTERTAIN', 'couple', 'hours', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Slugger', 'Wife']",N/A

While The Slugger's Wife wasn't a great classic romantic comedy to come out of the 80's, it was worth the two hours I spent watching it on cable.  I think this must have been one of Rebecca Demorney's earliest roles, possibly after Risky Business.  She plays a singer(well, err...she tries to be a singer) that performs covers of popular rock songs in cheezy/lounge singer mode.  I'm sure it was her own voice too.  That part of the film was a bit cheezy, but it was the 80's!  Michael O'Keefe plays a major league baseball player who falls instantly in love with her as he sees her perform at a club.  He doesn't win her right away, he actually almost &quot;strikes out&quot; completely.  Eventually they start dating and get married.  He wants her to be there for the games and not work, and she wants to continue with her lame singing career.  This was definitely not one of the best movies from the 80s, but it is worth a look at in my opinion.  It was kind of sweet.  The music however, was more of a cheeze factor than real music. I didn't feel my time had been wasted on this movie. I found it to be a cute little romantic comedy that seemed to be forgotten.",3,a cute movie,983404800,"03 1, 2001",2001,1245,"['am', 'going', 'have', 'completely', 'disagree', 'other', 'customer', 'review', 'here', 'Slugger', 'Wife', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'classic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'come', '80', 'was', 'worth', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching', 'cable', 'think', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'Rebecca', 'Demorney', 'earliest', 'roles', 'possibly', 'Risky', 'Business', 'singer', 'well', 'err', 'be', 'singer', 'covers', 'popular', 'rock', 'songs', 'cheezy/lounge', 'singer', 'mode', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'own', 'voice', 'too', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'cheezy', 'was', '80', 'Michael', ""O'Keefe"", 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'player', 'who', 'instantly', 'love', 'perform', 'club', ""n't"", 'win', 'right', 'away', 'actually', 'almost', 'quot', 'out', 'quot', 'completely', 'Eventually', 'start', 'dating', 'get', 'married', 'be', 'there', 'games', 'not', 'work', 'continue', 'lame', 'singing', 'career', 'was', 'definitely', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '80s', 'look', 'opinion', 'was', 'kind', 'sweet', 'music', 'however', 'was', 'more', 'cheeze', 'factor', 'real', 'music', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'time', 'had', 'been', 'wasted', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'cute', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'seemed', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A
