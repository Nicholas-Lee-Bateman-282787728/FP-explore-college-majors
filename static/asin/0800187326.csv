It is about a beautiful hit woman armed with a deadly combination of two pistols.  She is cold, clever and cool.  The black  costume looks admirable.  I  enjoyed watching this movie but I was a little disapointed that it lacked  character development.  For example, we do not get to know more about  assasin other than what  we can see on the surface.  Some may say - who  cares about character development.  It may not be important in this film,  but for my opinion it would be good to have a little depth in characters.  Overall I think that this movie was interesting and entertaining.",4,Great Idear but many things are lacking.,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,656,"['Killing', 'time', 'opinion', 'very', 'unique', 'story', 'structure', 'beautiful', 'hit', 'woman', 'armed', 'deadly', 'combination', 'two', 'pistols', 'cold', 'clever', 'cool', 'black', 'costume', 'admirable', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'disapointed', 'lacked', 'character', 'development', 'example', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'assasin', 'other', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'surface', 'may', 'say', 'who', 'character', 'development', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'important', 'film', 'opinion', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'have', 'little', 'depth', 'characters', 'Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'entertaining']",N/A
166729,A2LXZRXUZXV51P,0800187326,Jim Beam,"[5, 6]","A beautiful woman dressed in black, armed with two scary looking guns. How cheesy. How cliche. What a femme fatale wanna be. But I checked out this movie anyway, expecting a cheap action flick with a gorgeous woman, a combination which can be quite entertaining. I was wrong.Action sequences in this movie is not all that interesting, somewhat tacky at times. But action is definitely not the basis of this movie. It's about an assassin killing time (thus the title, I presume) before making a hit on her target. Sounds interesting? It gets better. On top of the beautiful assassin, we have a cop who hired her for revenge, thugs hired by the cop to kill the assassin because he has no money, and a target that assassin is supposed to kill. With this many trouble makers, you know there is going to be a rough ride. By the way, our gorgeous assassin loves to play William Tell to pass time, if you get my drift.With fascinating plot and great ending, one of the most memorable and stylish I might add, Killing Time has more going for it than its cover. But I have to admit, our heroine is a sight to behold and pleasure to watch. Especially the erotic imagery sequence accompanied by the song ""Sour Times"" by Portishead, it is one stylish spectacle. A great movie for killing time on weekends.",4,A very pleasant surprise...,945820800,"12 22, 1999",1999,1293,"['beautiful', 'woman', 'dressed', 'black', 'armed', 'two', 'scary', 'looking', 'guns', 'How', 'cheesy', 'How', 'cliche', 'What', 'femme', 'fatale', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'checked', 'out', 'movie', 'anyway', 'expecting', 'cheap', 'action', 'flick', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'combination', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'was', 'wrong.Action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'not', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'tacky', 'times', 'action', 'definitely', 'not', 'basis', 'movie', 'assassin', 'killing', 'time', 'thus', 'title', 'presume', 'making', 'hit', 'target', 'interesting', 'better', 'top', 'beautiful', 'assassin', 'have', 'cop', 'who', 'hired', 'revenge', 'thugs', 'hired', 'cop', 'kill', 'assassin', 'money', 'target', 'assassin', 'supposed', 'kill', 'many', 'trouble', 'makers', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'rough', 'ride', 'way', 'gorgeous', 'assassin', 'loves', 'play', 'William', 'Tell', 'pass', 'time', 'get', 'drift.With', 'fascinating', 'plot', 'great', 'ending', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'stylish', 'might', 'add', 'Killing', 'Time', 'more', 'going', 'cover', 'have', 'admit', 'heroine', 'sight', 'behold', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Especially', 'erotic', 'imagery', 'sequence', 'accompanied', 'song', 'Sour', 'Times', 'Portishead', 'one', 'stylish', 'spectacle', 'great', 'movie', 'killing', 'time', 'weekends']",N/A

Like the end credits say, &quot;All you need to make a movie is two guns and one girl.&quot; That's all it takes.  Everyone compares this film's style to Tarantino? WHY??? It is NOTHING like  Tarantino. More Raimi/Rodriguez/Woo-like. If anything, it's more like a  Robert Rodriguez film without the Spanish overtones. And like Rodriguez's  or Raimi's or Woo's films, all you need is the stylish visual photography  to keep you in it. That's all I needed. Kendra Torgan is both sexy and cool  as the curvaceous assassin known only as, &quot;Maria&quot;. Her stare is  constantly through a pair of sunglasses and when they are off, her eyes  resemble that of a hungry wolf, staring into the forest at a poor animal.  The rest of the cast are very likeable as they sit in a van, Killing Time,  trying to rub out Maria after she has done her job. This movie is good, not  great, but nonetheless, I think word should spread about this film. After  all, this is the man who is going to be directing the next Crow film. Very  underrated by those looking for plot in films like this one and  Godzilla(PLOT IN A GODZILLA MOVIE???

166731,A2887J6P8VPB5H,0800187326,Nichomachus,"[1, 7]","I really wanted to like this movie, but the script is awful, the acting is snooze-worthy, and the direction is half-baked. I guess this is an attempt to be a clever and droll British shoot-em-up flick, but it falls on its face through failing its too obvious aspirations. Bad pacing, inconsistent editing, and boring direction made a pretty flimsy plot look downright amateurish. It felt like some left-over film school obsession. We were laughing in all the wrong places. ""Reilly,"" the oh-so-evil bad guy, was extremely silly and fake in his literati posing. The assassin woman was a pleasure to watch, and since she didn't speak English she wasn't afforded the burden of trying to pass of stupidities as clever English banter. The cops and their dialogue were totally contrived. The goon-killers were just plain stupid in their bickering, hastening fast-forwarding. This film wants to be a Terantino/Guy Ritchie flick so badly it fails. It has to get by on slow-motion styling to make it at all interesting. It begins and ends ludicrously, by the final scene I was fast-forwarding with prejudice.",2,Boring and Pretentious,1036195200,"11 2, 2002",2002,1098,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'script', 'awful', 'acting', 'snooze-worthy', 'direction', 'half-baked', 'guess', 'attempt', 'be', 'clever', 'droll', 'British', 'shoot-em-up', 'flick', 'face', 'failing', 'too', 'obvious', 'aspirations', 'Bad', 'pacing', 'inconsistent', 'editing', 'boring', 'direction', 'made', 'pretty', 'flimsy', 'plot', 'look', 'downright', 'amateurish', 'felt', 'left-over', 'film', 'school', 'obsession', 'were', 'laughing', 'wrong', 'places', 'Reilly', 'oh-so-evil', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', 'extremely', 'silly', 'fake', 'literati', 'posing', 'assassin', 'woman', 'was', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'was', ""n't"", 'afforded', 'burden', 'trying', 'pass', 'stupidities', 'clever', 'English', 'banter', 'cops', 'dialogue', 'were', 'totally', 'contrived', 'goon-killers', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'bickering', 'hastening', 'fast-forwarding', 'film', 'be', 'Terantino/Guy', 'Ritchie', 'flick', 'so', 'badly', 'get', 'slow-motion', 'styling', 'make', 'interesting', 'ludicrously', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'fast-forwarding', 'prejudice']",N/A

The plan goes bad, when the cop can't afford the assassin, and the target is delayed on the train.It's a small film, but well shot and well acted (by actors you've seen, but can't quite put your finger on their identities). Violent, though, so not for little kids. The plot isn't terribly complicated, and is somewhat predictable, but if you're watching this movie this isn't likely a terribly big deal to you.And, that Italian assassin is damned efficient.
