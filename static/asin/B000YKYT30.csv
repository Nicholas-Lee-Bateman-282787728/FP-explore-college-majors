This one is somewhat more innovative, and the audience only applauds at the very end. Still, it makes me eager to find a copy of the DVD by the American Ballet.There is a story, I suppose, but you'd hardly know it from the dancing. Prince Siegfried falls in love with Odette, who is under a curse that turns her into a swan by day. She wears a white tutu.In Act Two, his mother (the queen) is trying to get him to choose a bride, I think. When Odile, who is apparently Odette's evil twin, shows up in her black tutu, we are supposed to understand that he mistakes her for Odile. Problem is, she is danced by the very same ballerina. Now it turns out that the prince can break the spell on Odette by pledging his love to her, but since he mistakes Odile for her and pledges his love to her, it seems Odette is doomed. But somehow he defeats the evil magician and love conquers all.I'd love to see Baryshnikov do it.",3,Very Traditional at the Bolshoi,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1140,"['one', 'Bolshoi', 'better', 'other', 'movies', 'Bolshoi', 'ballets', 'where', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'few', 'cameras', 'theater', 'film', 'live', 'performance', 'complete', 'audience', 'reactions', 'one', 'somewhat', 'more', 'innovative', 'audience', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'Still', 'eager', 'find', 'copy', 'DVD', 'American', 'Ballet.There', 'story', 'suppose', ""'d"", 'hardly', 'know', 'dancing', 'Prince', 'Siegfried', 'love', 'Odette', 'who', 'curse', 'swan', 'day', 'white', 'tutu.In', 'Act', 'Two', 'mother', 'queen', 'trying', 'get', 'choose', 'bride', 'think', 'When', 'Odile', 'who', 'apparently', 'Odette', 'evil', 'twin', 'up', 'black', 'tutu', 'are', 'supposed', 'understand', 'Odile', 'Problem', 'danced', 'very', 'same', 'ballerina', 'Now', 'out', 'prince', 'can', 'break', 'spell', 'Odette', 'pledging', 'love', 'Odile', 'love', 'Odette', 'doomed', 'somehow', 'evil', 'magician', 'love', 'conquers', 'all.I', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'Baryshnikov', 'do']",Swan Lake: The Bolshoi Theatre and the Company of the Bolshoi Ballet
1120233,A3FOSLM5G1BO63,B000YKYT30,"Eugene Tenenbaum ""reluctant reader""","[0, 0]","This 1984 staging by the Bolshoi has a controversial happy ending in contrast to the usual death of Odette and Siegfried, but otherwise it demonstrates the essence of ballet at its best in the tradition of Diaghilev and Balanchine.  Natalia Bessmertnova is still soft and lyrical in the dual role of Odette and Odile. Her eminently feminine quality makes her the ideal interpreter of this classic. The elegance and magnetism of Siegfried is masterfully portrayed by Alexander Bogatyrev.The cameras show the stage from appropriate distances allowing to see the dancers moving in space, i.e. not only the expression of their bodies and in correlation with each other, but also the dynamism of their stage crossings, which are somewhat neglected in the ballet-movies.  The facial expression and thus close-ups are secondary in the performance dance rendering the age and thus and the difference between the ages of the dancers irrelevant including 42 years of age of Bessmertnova versus only 25 of Bogatyrev.This Grigorovich's ""concept"", likethat of 1989 with outstanding Alla Mikhalchenkoas Odette-Odile, does not disappoint, as he was one of the world top choreographers, and the Bolshoi's non-leading dancers are superb.  The orchestra under Zhuraitis was maybe not as good as the Berlin Philharmonic, but still decent considering its secondary role. The lighting especially, but also the recording are less than perfect, though bearable especially considering the circumstance of the communist Soviet Union, in and by which it was produced.",4,Controversial happy ending from 1984,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,1541,"['1984', 'staging', 'Bolshoi', 'controversial', 'happy', 'ending', 'contrast', 'usual', 'death', 'Odette', 'Siegfried', 'otherwise', 'essence', 'ballet', 'best', 'tradition', 'Diaghilev', 'Balanchine', 'Natalia', 'Bessmertnova', 'still', 'soft', 'lyrical', 'dual', 'role', 'Odette', 'Odile', 'eminently', 'feminine', 'quality', 'ideal', 'interpreter', 'classic', 'elegance', 'magnetism', 'Siegfried', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'Alexander', 'Bogatyrev.The', 'cameras', 'show', 'stage', 'appropriate', 'distances', 'allowing', 'see', 'dancers', 'moving', 'space', 'i.e', 'not', 'only', 'expression', 'bodies', 'correlation', 'other', 'also', 'dynamism', 'stage', 'crossings', 'are', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'ballet-movies', 'facial', 'expression', 'thus', 'close-ups', 'are', 'secondary', 'performance', 'dance', 'rendering', 'age', 'thus', 'difference', 'ages', 'dancers', 'irrelevant', 'including', '42', 'years', 'age', 'Bessmertnova', 'versus', 'only', '25', 'Bogatyrev.This', 'Grigorovich', 'concept', '1989', 'outstanding', 'Alla', 'Mikhalchenkoas', 'Odette-Odile', 'not', 'disappoint', 'was', 'one', 'world', 'top', 'choreographers', 'Bolshoi', 'non-leading', 'dancers', 'are', 'superb', 'orchestra', 'Zhuraitis', 'was', 'maybe', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'still', 'decent', 'considering', 'secondary', 'role', 'lighting', 'especially', 'also', 'recording', 'are', 'less', 'perfect', 'bearable', 'especially', 'considering', 'circumstance', 'communist', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'produced']",Swan Lake: The Bolshoi Theatre and the Company of the Bolshoi Ballet

1120236,A3TIL1PC2ZE97B,B000YKYT30,J. M WILINSKY,"[35, 35]","This is a wonderful, classical version of Swan Lake.  It has all the elements and parts I want to see in this ballet: most of the dance segments and artistic excellence and balance. Right from the beginning we can tell this is going to be a great, energetic ballet as Prince Siegfried comes onto the stage in the very beginning and joins his tutor and jester in a lively pas de trois.  it is choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Natalia Bessmetnova's husband and the director of the Bolshoi Ballet at that time. He was a great choreographer and was especially gifted at staging the classics so that they fit the standards and requirements of today. The role of Odette and Odile is danced by Natalia Bessmertnova magnificently. She always danced with a combination of technical excellence and dignity. Another remarkable aspect of this performance is the uniform excellence of the dancing. Nowhere is there the slightest imperfection! Additionally, I was very impressed with the combination of youthful vigor and mature stature of all the dancing. All of the ethnic dances are included, and the Black Swan pas de deux follows the Petipa version. Rothbart is also given some great choreography here, something that is often neglected in other stagings. The sets and costumes are also at the highest standard--absolutely gorgeous. The image and sound are very good, as well, but keep in mind that this is a ballet movie on color film, so it has that special quality that film imparts. If you don't mind a Swan Lake on film, this is a fine Swan Lake to have in any collection.Sadly, on February 19, 2008 Natalia Bessmertnova died of a grave, protracted illness, just a few weeks after the release of this DVD. After her retirement from the stage, she had been teaching until her illness.",5,Outstanding Swan Lake!

Bessmertnava dances throughout the ballet miraculously conveying her immense skill and sensibility to both Odette(graceful and sensitive) and Odile( fierce and seducing).Only Bolshoi could afford to have small parts danced by first rate dancers which is the case.A most memorable Lake, though dated (costumes and scenery).
