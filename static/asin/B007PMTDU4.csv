You will do what SEEMS like easy small muscle work and ballet type moves...but those little moves will have you sore the next day! The instructor is simply the best!

1535798,A1FVXLTDPR7VOD,B007PMTDU4,C. White,"[20, 20]","What a fun, energizing workout!  I love Tracey and I do her BOOTY BARRE DVDs (Total Body and BB Plus) a couple of times a week.  I think this is a great workout to prepare you for Barre workouts.  The time flies by and before you know it, the hour is up.  The first half is a dance based workout.  She explains things clearly and goes over the steps with you so no worries if you have no dance experience.  The second workout is a floor barre routine.  So, basically moves that you would do at a ballet barre, but instead, on the floor.  This adds a different type of challenge vs if you were standing up.  So, think Pilates on the floor.  The second workout encompasses the whole body while the first workout is mostly cardio and legs/abs.

The entire workout is done barefoot, and you don't need any weights, just need a yoga mat for the second section.Part 1 is 25 minutes long, and it is a low-impact cardio workout that really fries the legs.  It's a nice low-intermediate-level workout.  I know that a lot of folks found the cardio portion of BB Total Body to be too intense for them, and the cardio in this section is much easier than it is in BB Total Body.  For this first section, I wished that the cueing was a bit better; there were several series of exercises where you were working from a downdog-type position, and so I couldn't see my TV.  The lack of in-depth cueing made it hard to figure out what to do, and I had to keep looking up to watch.Part 2 is 35 minutes long, and is a floor barre workout that focuses on the abs, booty, and legs.  The earlier part of this portion was really unique!  It wasn't traditional barre floorwork, but rather moves that replicated some of what you do at the barre.  (I'm having a hard time describing it, but, to give you a sample exercise, she had you do leg lifts in first position while stretching your legs forward.)  After that initial section, Tracey moved into some work on all fours, which I've always found to be really effective for my rear end and legs.  She doesn't endlessly rep you here (if you're familiar with Tracey Anderson's workouts or the Tonique On the Mat workout, it's not like those, but rather more like Brazil Butt Lift's High and Tight workout), but includes enough reps to make you feel the burn.Overall, this is a solid workout; I didn't find it to be as fun as the two other Booty Barre workouts I have, but it was still enjoyable and I know I'll reach for it quite often. Tracey is always a delight to work out with; her positive energy makes for a good workout that leaves you pleasantly tired afterwards.Since I wasn't sure how to combine these two new workouts, I asked Tracey on her Facebook page, and she said that it would be good to alternate them every other day with her other Booty Barre workouts.I haven't doneTracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Meltyet, but will write a review for it when I do so I can note the differences between these two Fuse Dance workouts.If you're looking for other barefoot workouts, Ellen Barrett also makes some really good ones, and she, like Tracey, is a super sweet, encouraging instructor.",5,Great for shaping the legs,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,2664,"[""Tracey'sTracey"", 'Mallett-The', 'Booty', 'Barre-Total', 'New', 'BodyandTracey', 'Mallett', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'Plus', 'Abs', 'Armsworkouts', 'are', 'two', 'favorite', 'workouts', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'put', 'out', 'two', 'new', 'Fuse', 'Dance', 'workouts.I', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'doing', 'one', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'workout', 'done', 'barefoot', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'weights', 'just', 'need', 'yoga', 'mat', 'second', 'section.Part', '1', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'low-impact', 'cardio', 'workout', 'really', 'legs', 'nice', 'low-intermediate-level', 'workout', 'know', 'lot', 'folks', 'found', 'cardio', 'portion', 'BB', 'Total', 'Body', 'be', 'too', 'intense', 'cardio', 'section', 'much', 'easier', 'BB', 'Total', 'Body', 'first', 'section', 'wished', 'cueing', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'several', 'series', 'exercises', 'where', 'were', 'working', 'downdog-type', 'position', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'TV', 'lack', 'in-depth', 'cueing', 'made', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'had', 'keep', 'looking', 'up', 'watch.Part', '2', '35', 'minutes', 'long', 'floor', 'barre', 'abs', 'booty', 'legs', 'earlier', 'part', 'portion', 'was', 'really', 'unique', 'was', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'barre', 'floorwork', 'rather', 'moves', 'replicated', 'what', 'do', 'barre', ""'m"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'describing', 'give', 'sample', 'exercise', 'had', 'do', 'leg', 'lifts', 'first', 'position', 'stretching', 'legs', 'forward', 'initial', 'section', 'Tracey', 'moved', 'work', 'fours', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'be', 'really', 'effective', 'rear', 'end', 'legs', ""n't"", 'endlessly', 'rep', 'here', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Tracey', 'Anderson', 'workouts', 'Tonique', 'Mat', 'workout', 'not', 'rather', 'more', 'Brazil', 'Butt', 'Lift', 'High', 'Tight', 'workout', 'enough', 'reps', 'make', 'feel', 'burn.Overall', 'solid', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'as', 'fun', 'two', 'other', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'have', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'know', ""'ll"", 'reach', 'quite', 'often', 'Tracey', 'always', 'delight', 'work', 'out', 'positive', 'energy', 'good', 'workout', 'pleasantly', 'tired', 'afterwards.Since', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'how', 'combine', 'two', 'new', 'workouts', 'asked', 'Tracey', 'Facebook', 'page', 'said', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'alternate', 'other', 'day', 'other', 'Booty', 'Barre', 'workouts.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'doneTracey', 'Mallett', 'FuseDance', 'Cardio', 'Meltyet', 'will', 'write', 'review', 'when', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'note', 'differences', 'two', 'Fuse', 'Dance', 'workouts.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'other', 'barefoot', 'workouts', 'Ellen', 'Barrett', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'ones', 'Tracey', 'super', 'sweet', 'encouraging', 'instructor']",Tracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Lean
