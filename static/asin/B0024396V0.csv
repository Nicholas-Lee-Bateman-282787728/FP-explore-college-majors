1249617,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0024396V0,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","The film PEDRO is a combination of documentary and cinematic drama, and as such it could have been an awkward pastiche, an attempt to honor the memory of a brave young man who courageously faced classrooms of children and many different public forums as a man living with HIV, offering the general public the opportunity to learn about the disease in hopes of preventing its spread.  Instead what happens is this film as written by Dustin Lance Black after a story by Paris Barclay and as directed with sensitive taste by Nick Oceano is a completely satisfying drama that just happens to add film clips form the well-known life of Pedro Zamora to enhance the dignity of this story.After a rather startling opening sequence the film begins in Cuba as families lined up to cross to America: among those families was the Zamora mother (Teresa Hern&aacute;ndez), father (Anibal O. Lleras) and only three of their children, including young Pedro and Mily.  They settle in Miami where Pedro grows up remembering his past in Cuba and concentrating on his world of fantasy with his beloved mother.  Pedro matures to a teenager (Alex Loynaz), a handsome and affable young lad whose sexual preference is men.  At the tender age of 17 he is found to be HIV positive and his sister Mily (Justina Machado) pledges to stay by his side through all of his trials.  Pedro is encouraged by various people to come out about his situation and indeed he does, flying to San Francisco to be on the Real World reality show. There he makes friends with his fellow 'roommates' (especially Judd/ Hale Appleman and Pam/ Jenn Liu).  On the show, in front of the public television audience he can be himself - a normal young guy who happens to have AIDS.  He meets Sean Sasser (DaJuan Johnson) and they eventually marry on the television series. Pedro becomes a very popular speaker and advocate for AIDS prevention. Once the series is over Pedro becomes ill and goes from a New York hospital to his home in Miami, diagnosed with an incurable manifestation of his disease.  The manner in which Pedro and his family cope with all aspects of Pedro's life closes the film.Alex Loynaz is excellent as Pedro, if not the magnetic personality of his true counterpart, and his scenes with Justina Machado are particularly profound and deeply touching.  The entire cast is well selected and offers different insights to the life of Pedro Zamora.  There won't be a dry eye after watching this tender film. It is well worth spending time getting to know another unsung hero.

1249618,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B0024396V0,James Hiller,"[11, 11]","This is a personal review. Back at the time the Real World: San Francisco premiered, I was just coming out. I was fascinated, absolutely fascinated, watching Pedro Zamora, a gay man living with AIDS, coping and educating others about his disease. It was nearly revolutionary. Here I sat, watching this man, who showed me there was absolutely nothing wrong with being gay. It's about time that for this wonderful movie, simply called ""Pedro"".Scribed by Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, ""Pedro"" tells the story of Zamora, both of his life and his involvement with MTV's Real World series. Cast in the third season as part of the San Francisco cast,  Zamora gave America a face of a person living with AIDS, and would begin to change the way the country dealt with the crisis. The bulk of the movie is really about Pedro's life, his coming to America from Cuba, his coming out, his acceptance of his HIV status, to his role as activist and educator.Alex Loynaz takes on the title role with sincerity and reverence. The opening scenes show Pedro's desire to get on the Real World to further advance his AIDS and HIV education. He's cast and thrown into the world of reality TV, which is set up immediately as more staged then one would think, pausing for tape reloads and setting up scenes of moving into the house. He befriends a ""bed wetting liberal"" Judd Winick (Hale Appleman), who's own personal struggle with Pedro's disease provides a way for everyone to grow along with him.Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell too much in the Real World house, thereby denying Puck taking control of the movie as he did the show. Before long, the taping ends, and Pedro decides to stay in San Francisco to further his relationship with Sean Sasser (DaJuan Johnson), which is given much, much wonderful airtime. Seeing the two together, especially as Pedro gets sicker, is apropos and touching.Deciding to return to Miami as his health worsens, we are able to jaunt back in time to learn about Pedro's early life.  With only some of his family leaving Cuba, Pedro must live in Miami with his mother, father, and sister. After his mother passes away from cancer, his sister steps up and becomes very close to him. Played by the highly missed and amazing actress Justina Machado (Six Feet Under), Mily struggles to accept his brother, and her support isn't always constant, but her love is.Much of the movie deals with Pedro's health decline, and possibly too much. Are we left to only remember Pedro as a victim or as an activist? What are his motivations from accepting his HIV status to AIDS educator? Black's screenplay nearly remains silent on the issue, other than a early blessing in his life saying he would be destined to be a voice in the world.Which he definitely is. I'll never forget the day that Pedro died. The country knew it was coming, watching his health decline on the show, even drawing comment from then president Bill Clinton about his work. The movie ""Pedro"" attempts to bring to the forefront his mission in life, to educate, to prevent. Has the United States listened? As Bill Clinton himself says in the introduction to the movie, HIV infections are back on the rise. It's time we, once again, listen to Pedro.",4,"Welcome back, Pedro",1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,3226,"['personal', 'review', 'time', 'Real', 'World', 'San', 'Francisco', 'premiered', 'was', 'just', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'fascinated', 'absolutely', 'fascinated', 'watching', 'Pedro', 'Zamora', 'gay', 'man', 'living', 'AIDS', 'coping', 'educating', 'others', 'disease', 'was', 'nearly', 'revolutionary', 'Here', 'sat', 'watching', 'man', 'who', 'showed', 'was', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'gay', 'time', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'simply', 'called', 'Pedro', '.Scribed', 'Milk', 'screenwriter', 'Dustin', 'Lance', 'Black', 'Pedro', 'story', 'Zamora', 'life', 'involvement', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'series', 'Cast', 'third', 'season', 'part', 'San', 'Francisco', 'cast', 'Zamora', 'gave', 'America', 'face', 'person', 'living', 'AIDS', 'would', 'begin', 'change', 'way', 'country', 'crisis', 'bulk', 'movie', 'really', 'Pedro', 'life', 'coming', 'America', 'Cuba', 'coming', 'out', 'acceptance', 'HIV', 'status', 'role', 'activist', 'educator.Alex', 'Loynaz', 'title', 'role', 'sincerity', 'reverence', 'opening', 'scenes', 'show', 'Pedro', 'desire', 'get', 'Real', 'World', 'further', 'advance', 'AIDS', 'HIV', 'education', 'cast', 'thrown', 'world', 'reality', 'TV', 'set', 'up', 'immediately', 'more', 'staged', 'then', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'pausing', 'tape', 'reloads', 'setting', 'up', 'scenes', 'moving', 'house', 'bed', 'wetting', 'liberal', 'Judd', 'Winick', 'Hale', 'Appleman', 'who', 'own', 'personal', 'struggle', 'Pedro', 'disease', 'way', 'everyone', 'grow', 'him.Fortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'Real', 'World', 'house', 'thereby', 'denying', 'Puck', 'taking', 'control', 'movie', 'did', 'show', 'long', 'taping', 'ends', 'Pedro', 'stay', 'San', 'Francisco', 'further', 'relationship', 'Sean', 'Sasser', 'DaJuan', 'Johnson', 'given', 'much', 'much', 'wonderful', 'airtime', 'Seeing', 'two', 'together', 'especially', 'Pedro', 'sicker', 'apropos', 'touching.Deciding', 'return', 'Miami', 'health', 'worsens', 'are', 'able', 'jaunt', 'back', 'time', 'learn', 'Pedro', 'early', 'life', 'only', 'family', 'leaving', 'Cuba', 'Pedro', 'must', 'live', 'Miami', 'mother', 'father', 'sister', 'mother', 'away', 'cancer', 'sister', 'up', 'becomes', 'very', 'close', 'Played', 'highly', 'missed', 'amazing', 'actress', 'Justina', 'Machado', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Mily', 'accept', 'brother', 'support', ""n't"", 'always', 'constant', 'love', 'is.Much', 'movie', 'deals', 'Pedro', 'health', 'decline', 'possibly', 'too', 'much', 'Are', 'left', 'only', 'remember', 'Pedro', 'victim', 'activist', 'What', 'are', 'motivations', 'accepting', 'HIV', 'status', 'AIDS', 'educator', 'Black', 'screenplay', 'nearly', 'silent', 'issue', 'other', 'early', 'blessing', 'life', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'destined', 'be', 'voice', 'world.Which', 'definitely', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'day', 'Pedro', 'died', 'country', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'watching', 'health', 'decline', 'show', 'even', 'drawing', 'comment', 'then', 'president', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'work', 'movie', 'Pedro', 'attempts', 'bring', 'forefront', 'mission', 'life', 'educate', 'prevent', 'United', 'States', 'listened', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'introduction', 'movie', 'HIV', 'infections', 'are', 'back', 'rise', 'time', 'once', 'again', 'listen', 'Pedro']",Pedro

Running Time: One Hour, 34 mins.Directed by Nick Oceano.DVD begins with a short introduction from President Bill Clinton.The movie begins on August 17, 1994 in New York City with Pedro Zamora (played by Alex Loynaz) trying to get his tie on and his sock on. He is slow this morning. The phone rings. He is not reacting to the phone ringing at first, but then picks up the receiver. It is Cheryl from MTV, she asks him if he is still there at the hotel. He is suppose to be at the CBS morning program for an interview. She tells him to take a taxi and he has 45 minutes. Pedro is sluggish and puts down the receiver before Cheryl can finish her sentence. Later, a security guard knocks on the hotel room door. There is no answer. The guard opens the door only to find Pedro collapsed on the floor.Then the movie takes us back nine months earlier when Pedro was making an audition videotape.Pedro Zamora was a cast member of MTV's Real World: San Francisco Season 3 in 1994. It was about seven young adult, strangers to each other, chosen to live together in a re-designed and re-decorated house for four months. Cameramen recorded them inside and outside. The cast members were Judd Winick, Rachel Campos, Mohammed Bilal, Pam Ling, Pedro Zamora, Cory Murphy, David ""Puck"" Rainey and later Joanna Rhodes.Only Judd knew at first he would be rooming with someone that was HIV-positive (HIV+). The rest of the cast did not know who it was yet. Pedro was openly gay and was an activist and speaker for AIDS.When production ended in June. Everyone moved out. Pedro's T-cells were down.  Pedro was beginning to become ill and weaker.The Real World: San Francisco was broadcast June 30-November 10, 1994 Just hours after the final episode was broadcast on MTV, Pedro Zamora passed away.The movie tells the true story of Pedro as a child, a teenager, his time in San Francisco and his return to Miami during his illness.This movie recreates The Real World with actors, however in the Bonus section, you will find 3 original episodes of The Real World: San Francisco (1994) shown in their entirety: Episodes 10, 11 and 19.Also included is the actual audition videotape of Pedro Zamora.Deleted scenes of this movie included.Also in the cast: Hale Appleman, Karolin Luna, Rafael Mondino, Jenn Liu, Amy Lewis, Matt Barr, Teresa Hernandez, Anibal O.

1249620,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0024396V0,Jeffery Mingo,"[5, 6]","This is not a rehash of the best season of ""The Real World.""  It's a made-for-TV movie, so it's not Oscar material.  Still, it has a lot of merit.  I would recommend this for multiple audiences.To me, what was best is the diversity.  How often do you see a white straight guy, his Asian girlfriend, a Black gay man, and an HIV-positive Latino on TV and treating each other as equals?  The two couples show both similarities and differences between gays and straights.  I wish more media works would be inclusive along race, gender, sexuality, and ability lines.Again, there's not much Puck or ""Real World"" here.  This focuses on the events before and after the series.  At one point, then President Clinton calls Pedro to thank him.  If that's what happened, then it's totally fair to include it.  I just wonder if GOP viewers would deem this ""liberal media bias.""How often does one get to see two gay men of color kissing on TV or DVD?  This work was revolutionary, just as the series was.  The series took place before all the new hysteria over ""the down low.""  This film proves that not all gay men of color are closeted.  There are gay men of color not ashamed to love men of color and not care if the majority disapproves.Viewers who have had family members come out or have cared for terminally ill relatives may truly relate to this.  The care that Pedro's sister gave to him was incredibly admirable.  Both the real woman and the actress playing her must be applauded.  The facts behind this work happened long before Massachusetts legalized gay marriage this decade.  At the time that Pedro and Sean were exchanging rings, they would have had real marriage rights nowhere.  Their commitment celebration took place in California, a state in which voters rejected gay marriage recently.  This film shows schisms between gay partners and their in-laws which touch upon why gay marriage is needed.The work concludes by saying Sean is still alive.  This contrasts to what internet sources state.  I don't know about the real Pedro, but the actor who played the role has a nice, delicious chest that the film highlights for maximum effect.",3,If you can't get enough of Pedro,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2142,"['not', 'rehash', 'best', 'season', 'Real', 'World', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'Still', 'lot', 'merit', 'would', 'recommend', 'multiple', 'audiences.To', 'what', 'was', 'best', 'diversity', 'How', 'often', 'do', 'see', 'white', 'straight', 'guy', 'Asian', 'girlfriend', 'Black', 'gay', 'man', 'HIV-positive', 'Latino', 'TV', 'treating', 'other', 'equals', 'two', 'couples', 'show', 'similarities', 'differences', 'gays', 'straights', 'wish', 'more', 'media', 'works', 'would', 'be', 'inclusive', 'race', 'gender', 'sexuality', 'ability', 'lines.Again', 'not', 'much', 'Puck', 'Real', 'World', 'here', 'events', 'series', 'one', 'point', 'then', 'President', 'Clinton', 'Pedro', 'thank', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'totally', 'fair', 'include', 'just', 'wonder', 'GOP', 'viewers', 'would', 'deem', 'liberal', 'media', 'bias', 'How', 'often', 'one', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'kissing', 'TV', 'DVD', 'work', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'just', 'series', 'was', 'series', 'took', 'place', 'new', 'hysteria', 'down', 'low', 'film', 'not', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'are', 'closeted', 'are', 'gay', 'men', 'color', 'not', 'ashamed', 'love', 'men', 'color', 'not', 'care', 'majority', 'disapproves.Viewers', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'family', 'members', 'come', 'out', 'have', 'cared', 'terminally', 'ill', 'relatives', 'may', 'truly', 'relate', 'care', 'Pedro', 'sister', 'gave', 'was', 'incredibly', 'admirable', 'real', 'woman', 'actress', 'playing', 'must', 'be', 'applauded', 'facts', 'work', 'happened', 'long', 'before', 'Massachusetts', 'legalized', 'gay', 'marriage', 'decade', 'time', 'Pedro', 'Sean', 'were', 'exchanging', 'rings', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'marriage', 'rights', 'nowhere', 'commitment', 'celebration', 'took', 'place', 'California', 'state', 'voters', 'rejected', 'gay', 'marriage', 'recently', 'film', 'schisms', 'gay', 'partners', 'in-laws', 'touch', 'why', 'gay', 'marriage', 'needed.The', 'work', 'concludes', 'saying', 'Sean', 'still', 'alive', 'what', 'internet', 'sources', 'state', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'Pedro', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'role', 'nice', 'delicious', 'chest', 'film', 'highlights', 'maximum', 'effect']",Pedro

This film, unfortunately, does not break much new ground - we get to know more about Pedro and his leaving Cuba and him dealing with AIDS and his treatments, but it leaves me wanting more. This is more of a Movie Of The Week than a film that celebrates Pedro's life and achievements.I am a big fan of The Real World and Pedro's season had more drama in it than this movie. The whole Puck arc on The Real World (and even the Rachel and Pedro one) had much more tension and emotion than this film does. It has been 15 years since Pedro passed away, couldn't we have gotten a better script given all the time that it could have been worked on? This film's message is still relevant today, but our relative enlightenment on homosexuality, STDs, sex education and safe sex makes the subject not as taboo as it was 15 years ago.For me, Alex Loynaz' portrayal of Pedro does not capture the strong life force and intensity that Pedro did have. I did appreciate the cameo that Judd, Pam and their kids had - I wish that all the cast members had participated with their comments in a documentary style instead of the actors who portrayed them.",1,I Expected More Than A Movie Of The Week,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,1244,"['Pedro', 'Zamora', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'HIV', 'positive', 'AIDS', 'activist', 'national', 'television', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'break', 'much', 'new', 'ground', 'get', 'know', 'more', 'Pedro', 'leaving', 'Cuba', 'dealing', 'AIDS', 'treatments', 'wanting', 'more', 'more', 'Movie', 'Week', 'film', 'Pedro', 'life', 'achievements.I', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Real', 'World', 'Pedro', 'season', 'had', 'more', 'drama', 'movie', 'whole', 'Puck', 'arc', 'Real', 'World', 'even', 'Rachel', 'Pedro', 'one', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'tension', 'emotion', 'film', 'been', '15', 'years', 'Pedro', 'passed', 'away', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'script', 'given', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'film', 'message', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'relative', 'enlightenment', 'homosexuality', 'STDs', 'sex', 'education', 'safe', 'sex', 'subject', 'not', 'as', 'taboo', 'was', '15', 'years', 'Alex', 'Loynaz', 'portrayal', 'Pedro', 'not', 'capture', 'strong', 'life', 'force', 'intensity', 'Pedro', 'did', 'have', 'did', 'appreciate', 'cameo', 'Judd', 'Pam', 'kids', 'had', 'wish', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'participated', 'comments', 'documentary', 'style', 'instead', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed']",Pedro

Justina Machado is terrific as his loving sister who nonetheless finds it difficult to accept her younger brother's sexual orientation.  The rest of the cast is fine as well.The film addresses the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States and around the world, among both the gay and straight communities, stressing the need for acceptance and support for those suffering from this scourge.  It manages to do so without ever becoming preachy.",5,A life well-lived,1311120000,"07 20, 2011",2011,930,"['Wonderful', 'biopic', 'AIDS', 'activist', 'Pedro', 'Zamora', 'once', 'intensely', 'moving', 'truly', 'inspirational.Tracing', 'life', 'childhood', 'Cuba', 'teenage', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'diagnosed', 'HIV-positive', 'stardom', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'untimely', 'death', 'age', '22', 'film', 'picture', 'life', 'well-lived', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'achieved', 'more', 'short', 'life', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'far', 'longer.Alex', 'Zoynaz', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Pedro', 'Justina', 'Machado', 'terrific', 'loving', 'sister', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'difficult', 'accept', 'younger', 'brother', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'rest', 'cast', 'fine', 'well.The', 'film', 'HIV/AIDS', 'epidemic', 'United', 'States', 'world', 'gay', 'straight', 'communities', 'stressing', 'need', 'acceptance', 'support', 'suffering', 'scourge', 'do', 'so', 'ever', 'becoming', 'preachy']",Pedro
