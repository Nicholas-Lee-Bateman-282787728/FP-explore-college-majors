1371095,A134MJZL7H493A,B003XTUAHS,Amazon Customer,"[0, 2]","This series, short lived as it was, takes ques from other animated series like the original X-men animated series and Exosquad, in that continuity and continuing story lines run rampart throughout these 26 episodes. The series takes liberties with the movies and the long history of the comics and meshes them together into a new world of familiar characters. I liked them all, with the exception of Toad, whom they either could have either made more competent, or less annoying, because entirely incompetent and entirely annoying just do not work. Cyclops pretty much goes without saying as being an annoying character just about all the time as well, but it seems to be inherent in his character no matter who writes him or portrays him.There are 9 episodes on the first and second disc, and the remaining 8 episodes on a third. This is great, as there aren't compression issues that bog down the animation. The voice talents range from good to great (with the exception of Toad), and there isn't an episode here that I would skip over on a second viewing.The limitations of this being a kid's show make most of the fights confounding (just stab them already, Wolverine!), but even so, they manage to make them fun in their own way. This is a show meant for kids, but even as an adult I enjoy it.This is great value for money, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some animated goodness that isn't anime.",5,A lot of fun,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1423,"['series', 'short', 'lived', 'was', 'ques', 'other', 'animated', 'series', 'original', 'X-men', 'animated', 'series', 'Exosquad', 'continuity', 'continuing', 'story', 'lines', 'run', 'rampart', '26', 'episodes', 'series', 'liberties', 'movies', 'long', 'history', 'comics', 'meshes', 'together', 'new', 'world', 'familiar', 'characters', 'liked', 'exception', 'Toad', 'whom', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'competent', 'less', 'annoying', 'entirely', 'incompetent', 'entirely', 'annoying', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'Cyclops', 'pretty', 'much', 'saying', 'being', 'annoying', 'character', 'just', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'inherent', 'character', 'matter', 'who', 'portrays', 'are', '9', 'episodes', 'first', 'second', 'disc', 'remaining', '8', 'episodes', 'third', 'great', 'are', ""n't"", 'compression', 'issues', 'bog', 'down', 'animation', 'voice', 'talents', 'range', 'good', 'great', 'exception', 'Toad', ""n't"", 'episode', 'here', 'would', 'skip', 'second', 'viewing.The', 'limitations', 'being', 'kid', 'show', 'make', 'most', 'fights', 'confounding', 'just', 'stab', 'already', 'Wolverine', 'even', 'so', 'manage', 'make', 'fun', 'own', 'way', 'show', 'meant', 'kids', 'even', 'adult', 'enjoy', 'it.This', 'great', 'value', 'money', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'animated', 'goodness', ""n't"", 'anime']",N/A

Why was the story reduced to only the bare plotline of Wolverine and Co. preventing the apocalyptic war between Humans and Mutants?

The actors who voice the characters are a joy to listen to.  However, Marvel ended the series when they couldn't see eye-to-eye with the show's distributor, so for now we can't know how Wolverine and Company dealt with Apocalypse or even if they were able to wrest the transformed Angel away from Sinistro so they could restore Angel to what he previously had been.

Looking back on it now, it could have used some work but the stories where solid and the animation kept getting better of the years so no complaints.  A few years ago there was X-men Evolution which was the X-men (most of them anyway) as children and teenagers growing into adulthood.  Now they are all adults (more or less) Professor X has mysteriously disappeared along with Jean Grey and the team is all but completely gone.  Then Logan comes back and I know at first I was skeptical because Logan's character is that of a follower, he's really not leader material, or he doesn't like to be.  Still, that was the point so say the people behind the series, it's new and it puts the characters in new and interesting position, forcing them to adapt to circumstances that are typically way outside their comfort zone.  It really does make for good TV.  The animation is solid the guest stars and little extra mutants and Marvel characters that show up are a bonus.

1371122,A3MBC0WNEAP7AS,B003XTUAHS,Leonard,"[5, 6]","The title says it all. Wolverine is one of the most popular characters in the Marvel universe. I like Wolverine but the earlier episodes are way too Wolverine-centric. Only in the last 4 episodes do they focus a little more on Cyclops. Another criticism of the series is that Wolverine is supposed to be an emotionally disturbed, anti-hero. In this series, however, he's almost like Bruce Wayne. He's a flawless hero, which is inconsistent with almost every incarnation of his character.The irony of the situation is that in this series, Cyclops acts like...Wolverine (read the spoiler below to find out why). I didn't like Cyclops's new uniform since it made him look like a bum. Rogue was useless in this series. I miss the sexy Rogue with Ms. Marvel's powers from the 1990's series. Storm and Beast didn't do much either. The only secondary character who was useful was Nightcrawler. (SPOILER) I liked the subplot with him and Scarlet Witch.Despite the many flaws of this series, it's still X-Men and it's still very interesting. It's the usual premise of the mutants being persecuted by the humans and Magneto wanting to prove that mutants are superior to humans.SPOILERThere was an explosion at the mansion caused by Phoenix (though at the time no one knew it was caused by Phoenix). Xavier and Jean Grey went missing. Cyclops went into a state of depression. After the MRD (Mutant Response Division) started rounding up mutants, the X-Men reunited. Cyclops was obsessed with finding Jean. He wasn't much of a team player (sounds familiar)?I'm sure everyone knows about how Magneto established Genosha as a sanctuary for mutants. Of course, he wasn't content with that. Quicksilver always sought his father's approval but never received it. Scarlet Witch was a daddy's little girl, but had a special place in her heart for Nightcrawler. There was another relatively new mutant who I thought was interesting-Domino.I wish there was a little more Sabretooth in this series. This series also featured another iconic X-Men villain, Mr. Sinister (""Sinister knows what your future holds""). Anyone who has watched the Justice League series recognized his voice.The X-Men were supposed to fight Apocalypse in season 2, but for some asinine reason, they cancelled this series. This was the last great comic book cartoon.

The movies were pretty good. The first two were excellent, though the third seemed to go too off track. It was still okay, in my opinion. I found X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: First Class quite nice, yet that's also from my point of view.

I do know that this particular series was very well written and the artwork is great! I admit that some episodes weren't as interesting as others, but in all it was a wonderful series.

Still, it was worth the wait:) I've owned this complete season for a good while now; however, I just hadn't gotten around to review it until now. Some people didn't like how Emma Frost was written off. I've read things online where they say that they made her too soft. Well, she was softer, but still herself.

1371130,A3FJ0PV51QQRZW,B003XTUAHS,mr.3D,"[0, 0]","Spoiler freeLike many life long X men fans,if you're anything like me you've probably read the comic books for years and have even been watching the cartoons since Marvel Action Universe in the late 80s. The animated series was great,along with X Men Evolution which put a great interpretation upon things. With Wolverine and the X Men I was skeptical if for nothing else than the name alone,yet am happy to say that while the series is heavy on everyone's favorite adamantium laced, claw wielding X Man,this series gives the whole cast a fair shake to boot. Theirs twist and turns in the series with a few surprises to boot.So you may be asking yourself,""Well that sound great and all but what does it really deliver that i haven't already seen in an X animated show already? Why watch an all new interpretation when I can read the comics?""Well for one if you're a die hard fan you're going to watch this regardless (even if you're a little late on the draw such as myself). The second,and most interesting reason to check this series out is because at the heart of Wolverine and The X Men you really get (in my own personal opinion) what X Men The Last Stand should have been and what a fourth X film had the potential to be. This series really could quiet easily(with a few exceptions) follow the first two films pretty well and does a darn good job at it if you pay attention. Theirs a great conspiracy/mystery that echoes through the entire series and despite being a children's cartoon,paints a rather bleak picture which really makes you feel the stakes are high and nothing is certain. For that alone this series gets a standing applause from me.The biggest complaint I have with this series is that towards the middle it tends to drag a bit. They throw in a few villains too fast without a proper followup but on the flip side it's really just to set up different X Men characters and push the main story arch along.

1371132,AHF97M45JFCB,B003XTUAHS,ONENEO,"[25, 26]","Depending on where you begin counting, Wolverine and the X-Men is the fourth or fifth time Marvel's flagship superhero group have come to small-screen animated life.  It gets ugly because the X-gang has made countless guest appearances in other Marvel properties but the important thing to remember is that it would end up being the final X-Men animated series produced by the late Boyd Kirkland.Further complicating the show's identity is its closeness to the X-Men franchise that preceded it; X-Men: Evolution (which was actually done by the same creative team).  Evolution took the X-Men to a decidedly high-school slant in effort to compete with some of the other teen-targeted superhero programs of the era; Teen Titans and Batman Beyond to mention a few.  Evolution ran from 2000-2003, spanning four seasons in the process and Wolverine and the X-Men came on the scene five years later (beginning in September of 2008 and running until November of 2009).The premise of Wolverine and the X-Men works off the adult-versions of the beloved characters and centers on a sudden explosion at the Xavier Institute.  Initially perceived among the X-Men to be an attack by an unknown assailant, targeted at telepaths, (particularly Professor Charles Xavier and Jean Grey) who consequently go missing in the immediate aftermath. The resulting trauma causes the X-Men to disband and go their separate ways.A year after the incident, an organization known as the Mutant Response Division (MRD) is formed for detainment and registration of mutants and begins capturing mutants around the nation. This course of action spurs Wolverine and Beast to rally and attempt to bring the defunct X-Men team back together once more to fight for mutant-freedoms.  Hence the title of the series is justified and our dear socially withdrawn Logan finds himself dropped into a leadership position.Perhaps most unique to this series is the idea that the comatose Xavier in the present is able to make psychic connection to his own self some 20-years in the future.  Essentially creating parallel story threads, the X-Men would be totally lost if not for the older Xavier's guidance.  When hope of using Cerebro to locate the missing mutants seems lost, the ever-charming Emma Frost arrives to offer her telepathic assistance to make the arduous task of tracking down the scattered members a bit more manageable.In all merely 26-episodes (comprising) one season were made of the show despite receiving impressive viewer numbers and critical acclaim.  Some argued that the story thread itself couldn't possibly endure for too long as it relied upon a serial format heavily driven by a need for resolve.  However, the true cancellation of the property is credited to financial difficulties behind the scenes.In my opinion, the show is pretty strong, especially considering that it was only given a single season to accomplish some pretty lofty ambitions.  The characters are at least portrayed accurately enough to really make the viewer wonder what could have been done if, like Evolution, they had four seasons to work with.The voice work is pretty darn spectacular, especially if you're fan of the movie trilogy's cast (Tom Kane's rendition of Magneto could have Ian McKellen wondering if he recorded for the show himself).Sadly, it's unlikely this particular telling the storied franchise's many incarnations will stand out over the years as the definitive animated series, it can't be faulted for its casuals (which are quite crisp and true to form) or the science fiction style story thread which, quite frankly, is more impressive than any of the live action movie plots to date.The biggest complaint by far will be the singular storyline, which feels like it should have been a multi-parter story arc amidst a larger series rather than the entire series itself.  However, since the show belongs to Lionsgate rather than Buena Vista like some of the other Marvel releases, a full series box set has been released for an MSRP not much higher than individual volume releases.  Keeping that in mind, diving into Wolverine and the X-Men is certainly worth the price of admission and quite a solid piece of storytelling to boot.",4,An Under-appreciated Entry in the X-Men Universe,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,4203,"['Depending', 'where', 'begin', 'counting', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'time', 'Marvel', 'flagship', 'superhero', 'group', 'have', 'come', 'small-screen', 'animated', 'life', 'ugly', 'X-gang', 'made', 'countless', 'guest', 'appearances', 'other', 'Marvel', 'properties', 'important', 'thing', 'remember', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'final', 'X-Men', 'animated', 'series', 'produced', 'late', 'Boyd', 'Kirkland.Further', 'complicating', 'show', 'identity', 'closeness', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'preceded', 'X-Men', 'Evolution', 'was', 'actually', 'done', 'same', 'creative', 'team', 'Evolution', 'took', 'X-Men', 'decidedly', 'high-school', 'slant', 'effort', 'compete', 'other', 'teen-targeted', 'superhero', 'programs', 'era', 'Teen', 'Titans', 'Batman', 'Beyond', 'mention', 'few', 'Evolution', 'ran', '2000-2003', 'spanning', 'four', 'seasons', 'process', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'came', 'scene', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'beginning', 'September', '2008', 'running', 'November', '2009', '.The', 'premise', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'works', 'adult-versions', 'beloved', 'characters', 'centers', 'sudden', 'explosion', 'Xavier', 'Institute', 'Initially', 'perceived', 'X-Men', 'be', 'attack', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'targeted', 'telepaths', 'particularly', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'who', 'consequently', 'go', 'missing', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'resulting', 'trauma', 'X-Men', 'disband', 'go', 'separate', 'ways.A', 'year', 'incident', 'organization', 'known', 'Mutant', 'Response', 'Division', 'MRD', 'formed', 'detainment', 'registration', 'mutants', 'capturing', 'mutants', 'nation', 'course', 'action', 'spurs', 'Wolverine', 'Beast', 'rally', 'attempt', 'bring', 'defunct', 'X-Men', 'team', 'back', 'together', 'once', 'more', 'fight', 'mutant-freedoms', 'Hence', 'title', 'series', 'justified', 'dear', 'socially', 'withdrawn', 'Logan', 'dropped', 'leadership', 'most', 'unique', 'series', 'idea', 'comatose', 'Xavier', 'present', 'able', 'make', 'psychic', 'connection', 'own', 'self', '20-years', 'future', 'Essentially', 'creating', 'parallel', 'story', 'threads', 'X-Men', 'would', 'be', 'totally', 'lost', 'not', 'older', 'Xavier', 'guidance', 'When', 'hope', 'using', 'Cerebro', 'locate', 'missing', 'mutants', 'lost', 'ever-charming', 'Emma', 'Frost', 'offer', 'telepathic', 'assistance', 'make', 'arduous', 'task', 'tracking', 'down', 'scattered', 'members', 'bit', 'more', 'manageable.In', 'merely', '26-episodes', 'comprising', 'one', 'season', 'were', 'made', 'show', 'receiving', 'impressive', 'viewer', 'numbers', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'argued', 'story', 'thread', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'endure', 'too', 'long', 'relied', 'serial', 'format', 'heavily', 'driven', 'need', 'resolve', 'However', 'true', 'cancellation', 'property', 'credited', 'financial', 'difficulties', 'scenes.In', 'opinion', 'show', 'pretty', 'strong', 'especially', 'considering', 'was', 'only', 'given', 'single', 'season', 'accomplish', 'pretty', 'lofty', 'ambitions', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'enough', 'really', 'make', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'Evolution', 'had', 'four', 'seasons', 'work', 'with.The', 'voice', 'work', 'pretty', 'darn', 'spectacular', 'especially', ""'re"", 'fan', 'movie', 'trilogy', 'cast', 'Tom', 'Kane', 'rendition', 'Magneto', 'could', 'have', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'wondering', 'recorded', 'show', '.Sadly', 'unlikely', 'particular', 'telling', 'storied', 'franchise', 'many', 'incarnations', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'years', 'definitive', 'animated', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'casuals', 'are', 'quite', 'crisp', 'true', 'form', 'science', 'fiction', 'style', 'story', 'thread', 'quite', 'frankly', 'more', 'impressive', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'plots', 'date.The', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'far', 'will', 'be', 'singular', 'storyline', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'multi-parter', 'story', 'arc', 'larger', 'series', 'rather', 'entire', 'series', 'However', 'show', 'Lionsgate', 'rather', 'Buena', 'Vista', 'other', 'Marvel', 'releases', 'full', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'been', 'released', 'MSRP', 'not', 'much', 'higher', 'individual', 'volume', 'releases', 'Keeping', 'mind', 'diving', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'certainly', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'quite', 'solid', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'boot']",N/A

I can't say enough about the sound quality, it's completely awesome, like nothing i've ever heard for a U.S. television cartoon series. I might even say theatre quality with its wide open feel and surround effects. and the animation is some of today's best. Many characters make an appearance - it was great to see the Blob in there, and again the storylines are respectibly handled, not kiddies stuff, though they will definitely enjoy it and there's nothing in there they shouldn't watch. It's a shame the best series to come out since Justice League has been cancelled.

1371146,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B003XTUAHS,Theo,"[1, 1]","I'll make it short and sweet:This was a good cartoon. It didn't deserve to get cancelled after one season.It wasn't exactly on the bleeding edge of the genre. In terms of real depth and pushing the boundaries of what a superhero cartoon can be, it wasn't in the same league as Bruce Timm's best work, or even the most recent version of Marvel's ownAvengers.But it was entertaining and engaging and fun to watch, with just the right amount of intrigue and suspense. It was also far and away the most visually sophisticated X-Men cartoon ever made - at least until we got to the anime X-Men. And even by comparison with that show, while this version was nowhere near as darkly atmospheric, in terms of achieving what it actually set out to achieve, it did hold its own. In fact, while not so heavy on atmosphere, the other side of that same coin is that the art in this show was more coolly reserved, even restrained, than that to be found in its anime counterpart.So much for the art. How about the story?Aside from the gimmick of putting Wolverine in charge of a fractured team, long time fans of the X-Men won't find a great deal that is new here. True, this series generally rearranges the usual roles that the characters play within the team, but that's about it. The reason why I personally stopped reading the comic books (more years ago now than I care to think) was that the X-Men comics, like most comic books, really only have two or three basic stories to tell. These same stories are told and retold over and over again, with endless minor variations on the perennial themes. This particular show tells the story where the X-Men have to stop a horribly dystopian future from coming to pass. If you are a fan of the comic books, and have been for more than a year or two, I'm sure you know the story I'm talking about.But while the actual plot is almost entirely devoid of originality, perhaps that's not the point. The stories in tragic and comic opera are every bit as formulaic. The point, if there is one at all, is in the artistry of the retelling. And taken on that level, ""Wolverine and The X-Men"" was, if nothing else, a good retelling.So yes, like I said in the beginning, this was a good cartoon. It didn't deserve to get canned after one season.I am genuinely sad that we'll never get to see what season two might've been.Theo.",4,Gone Too Soon,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,2348,"[""'ll"", 'make', 'short', 'sweet', 'was', 'good', 'cartoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'get', 'cancelled', 'one', 'season.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'bleeding', 'edge', 'genre', 'terms', 'real', 'depth', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'what', 'superhero', 'cartoon', 'can', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'best', 'work', 'even', 'most', 'recent', 'version', 'Marvel', 'ownAvengers.But', 'was', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'fun', 'watch', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'was', 'also', 'far', 'away', 'most', 'visually', 'sophisticated', 'X-Men', 'cartoon', 'ever', 'made', 'least', 'got', 'anime', 'X-Men', 'even', 'comparison', 'show', 'version', 'was', 'nowhere', 'near', 'darkly', 'atmospheric', 'terms', 'achieving', 'what', 'actually', 'set', 'out', 'achieve', 'did', 'hold', 'own', 'fact', 'not', 'so', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'other', 'side', 'same', 'coin', 'art', 'show', 'was', 'more', 'coolly', 'reserved', 'even', 'restrained', 'be', 'found', 'anime', 'counterpart.So', 'much', 'art', 'How', 'story', 'Aside', 'gimmick', 'putting', 'Wolverine', 'charge', 'fractured', 'team', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'X-Men', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'great', 'deal', 'new', 'here', 'True', 'series', 'generally', 'usual', 'roles', 'characters', 'play', 'team', 'reason', 'why', 'personally', 'stopped', 'reading', 'comic', 'books', 'more', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'care', 'think', 'was', 'X-Men', 'comics', 'most', 'comic', 'books', 'really', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'three', 'basic', 'stories', 'tell', 'same', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'retold', 'over', 'again', 'endless', 'minor', 'variations', 'perennial', 'themes', 'particular', 'show', 'story', 'where', 'X-Men', 'have', 'stop', 'horribly', 'dystopian', 'future', 'coming', 'pass', 'are', 'fan', 'comic', 'books', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'year', 'two', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'story', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.But', 'actual', 'plot', 'almost', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'originality', 'perhaps', 'not', 'point', 'stories', 'tragic', 'comic', 'opera', 'are', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'point', 'one', 'artistry', 'retelling', 'taken', 'level', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'good', 'retelling.So', 'yes', 'said', 'beginning', 'was', 'good', 'cartoon', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'get', 'canned', 'one', 'season.I', 'am', 'genuinely', 'sad', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'season', 'two', 'might', ""'ve"", 'been.Theo']",N/A

Loved the fight scenes and  the Sinister and the Archangel story is superb. The story tangling was done very well.

Which sadly is also how most of the other characters are with the exception of a Cyclops, Storm and Nightcrawler eipsode( Nightcrawler gets two episodes to shine ), since as mentioned in the commentaries this show assumes that you enough enough abuot the X-men mythos to know who's who and what's what which is both good and bad. This leads to some episodes being hit and miss( did we really need another Hulk/Wolverine episode? ) but when it does find it's groove on a episode it works great( the episode where they introduce Tildy from Joss Whedon'sAstonishing X-Men, Vol. 1 (v. 1).It's also refreshing getting a commentary track on every episode( the first trilogy episodes have two seperate tracks ) and for aspiring animators/writers or what have you it helps to hear what the brain trust for this show has to say, the audio was great and I have some other season sets on blu ray but I rank this set as one of the best of the best and as an added bonus it looks great to the other X-Men shows I have on dvd.",4,The benchmark for animated X-Men adaptions,1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,1658,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'X-Men', 'animated', 'incarnation', 'Pryde', 'X-Men', 'had', 'one', 'greatest', 'theme', 'songs', 'ever', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Wolverine', 'easily', 'best', 'animated', 'version', 'X-Men', 'date.The', 'shifting', 'dynamic', 'having', 'Wolverine', 'being', 'forced', 'leadership', 'role', 'odd', 'Storm', 'show', 'would', 'think', 'two', 'main', 'writers', 'show', 'who', 'write', 'comics', 'would', 'remember', 'once', 'time', 'led', 'team', 'Cyclops', 'basically', 'beomcing', 'brooding', 'loner', 'Wolverine', 'use', 'fill', 'was', 'great', 'Cyclops', 'first', 'two', 'apperences', 'idea', 'swept', 'rug', 'Which', 'sadly', 'also', 'how', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'exception', 'Cyclops', 'Storm', 'Nightcrawler', 'eipsode', 'Nightcrawler', 'two', 'episodes', 'shine', 'as', 'mentioned', 'commentaries', 'show', 'enough', 'enough', 'X-men', 'mythos', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'what', 'what', 'good', 'bad', 'episodes', 'being', 'hit', 'miss', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'Hulk/Wolverine', 'episode', 'when', 'find', 'groove', 'episode', 'great', 'episode', 'where', 'introduce', 'Tildy', 'Joss', ""Whedon'sAstonishing"", 'X-Men', 'Vol', '1', 'v.', '1', '.It', 'also', 'refreshing', 'getting', 'commentary', 'track', 'episode', 'first', 'trilogy', 'episodes', 'have', 'two', 'seperate', 'tracks', 'aspiring', 'animators/writers', 'what', 'have', 'hear', 'what', 'brain', 'trust', 'show', 'say', 'audio', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'other', 'season', 'sets', 'blu', 'ray', 'rank', 'set', 'one', 'best', 'best', 'added', 'bonus', 'great', 'other', 'X-Men', 'shows', 'have', 'dvd']",N/A

1371150,A3HP9JNRHOA5CW,B003XTUAHS,William James Taylor IV,"[45, 65]","PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: When a mysterious explosion destroys half the Institute and results in the disappearances of both Professor Charles Xavier and Jean Grey, the X-Men disband. Logan, AKA: Wolverine, he of the short temper to match his short stature & adamantium claws, then takes it upon himself to reunite the X-Men and resume fighting for Xavier's dream. Throw in mystery guest Emma Frost, a bad future, & the Phoenix, and you have season 1 of Wolvie & the X-Men.Calling the series terrible wouldn't be fair, but it is built on a flimsy premise - Wolverine becoming the leader of the X-Men. Let's be honest, Wolverine as the X-Men's leader is absurd, it is the stuff of fan fiction, which is what this series often feels like: an overzealous Wolverine fan's fan fiction brought to life, albeit with a soft spot for Nightcrawler. The inherent flimsiness of the show's premise is made all the more apparent by inconsistent, hit or miss writing. Some episodes work okay as empty headed actioners, while others flirt with interesting ideas (such as Xavier as an active player in the future), but on the whole many episodes feel hollow.Another flaw is Wolverine himself - his flaws are actually downplayed to the point of barely existing. Though the creative team behind this series (also the same team that handled X-Men: Evolution) went to great lengths in all the press material to say they were going to depict Wolverine as a flawed & unlikely leader, but not a single episode really shows this. His mistakes are usually minor, no one but Emma really points this out, and even when he borders on being a hypocrite he's still right in the end. Too bad, considering that he had a good voice actor in Steve Blum, who sounds pretty much the way you expect Wolverine to sound (at times Blum even sounds like Cathal ""Cal"" Dodd, who voiced Wolverine in the 90s series).Another problem is the balancing act of characters - while some characters such as villains Magneto & Mr. Sinister are used well (getting Clancy Brown to voice Mr. Sinister was a stroke of genius) along with Emma Frost in her big debut as a regular cast member, others are not. Of the X-Men only Nightcrawler emerged as a strong character in his own right, & Kurt's solo episodes are easily the best the series has to offer (Angel had potential but wasn't really utilized beyond a few episodes before he became Ark Angel). The team dynamic of the X-Men is not strongly established, since the others are often ignored or not fleshed out beyond their cipher roles, & for the most part they show very little genuine concern for each other (such as giving up on Angel when he turns into Ark Angel). Perhaps that was deliberate to show how disconnected they are under Wolverine's leadership, but I doubt it.This brings me to what may be the series biggest failure character wise: Cyclops/Scott Summers. I have always been a Cyclops fan, but there was nothing about this version of him that was particularly sympathetic. With better writing the idea of Cyclops & Wolverine swapping roles may have been moderately interesting, but it quickly becomes apparent that Cyclops doesn't work in the role of angry loner because he doesn't have the same luck Wolverine usually has in that role. While Wolverine's flaws can turn into strengths at the drop of a hat, Cyclops is made to look like a chump when he tries to do what Wolverine is known for, like going off on his own or not being a team player. Where the experiment truly fails is ""Breakdown"", a ham-fisted reworking of Scott's origin that incorrectly casts him as the laughingstock of the original 5, a hopelessly incompetent wimp who couldn't handle one basic training simulation & needed Jean to lead him by the hand & tell him what to do when facing off with Magneto, then years later an emotionally volatile man-brat who physically assaulted Wolverine when he thought the clawed one was trying to steal Jean from him, and then fell apart when Jean disappeared. They boiled Scott down to the stereotype that he is nothing without Jean, & gave him no positive qualities or growth to compensate. We never see him when he was at his best, which makes it difficult to swallow his fall from grace since he apparently had no grace period to fall from. Not once do we ever see anything resembling the hero from the comics, the efficient & fearless leader who fought for Xavier's Cause like a knight defending the Holy Grail. This version of Scott deserves sympathy from no one, & certainly doesn't deserve either Jean or Emma. Yeah, Scott had a crappy life, but so did Magneto. Though a fine actor, Nolan North can't save this walking shack of faults characterization.On the flip-side of Scott's poor characterization is the utter lack of characterization for Storm (saddled with a horrible character design), the real co-leader & 2nd in command when Scott isn't around. For the most part Storm is just there to fill up scenery & has little to contribute beyond an occasional thunderbolt. The writers didn't even try to offer a reason for why Storm didn't take over as leader, despite years of stories that show what a natural leader she is, which is all the more unfortunate considering that Wolverine got along better with Storm in charge than he did with Cyclops. Where Cyclops had to nearly twist Wolverine's arm to make him do anything he didn't want, Storm could get him to settle down & behave himself just through the sheer strength of her personality.Season 1 gets 5 out of 10 stars for certain characterizations (Nightcrawler, Emma Frost, etc.), occasionally interesting ideas & competent voice actors, but loses points for inconsistent writing & insincere handling of other characters.",3,An OK but overrated hit or miss adaptation,1295395200,"01 19, 2011",2011,5701,"['PLOT', 'IN', 'A', 'NUTSHELL', 'When', 'mysterious', 'explosion', 'Institute',
