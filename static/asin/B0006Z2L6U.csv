875438,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0006Z2L6U,Alfred Johnson,"[8, 11]","Back in the days of my personal `pre-history' the Reconstruction period directly after the American Civil War ended in 1865 was cast as the time of the scalawags, carpetbaggers, Black Codes and ultimately after a determined fight by the `right' people in the South `redemption'. In short a time of shame in the American experience and, at least implicitly, a racist slap at blacks and their supporters. Well so much for that nonsense.There certainly was plenty that went wrong during radical reconstruction in the South but the conventional high school history textbooks never got into the whole story. Nor did they want to. The whole story is that until fairly recently this radical reconstruction period was the most democratic period in the South in American history, for white and black alike. Previously, I have written some book reviews on this subject that led me to this documentary. This documentary goes a long way toward a better visual understanding of what went on in that period.The first part of the Radical Reconstruction era was dominated by three basic plans that are described here in some detail; the aborted Lincoln `soft' union indivisible efforts; the Johnson `soft' redemption plans; and, the radical Republican `scorched earth' policy toward the South. In the end none of these plans was pursued strongly enough to insure that enhanced black rights gained through legislation would lead to enlightened citizenship. The documentary presents detailed critiques of all these plans and some insights about the social and cultural mores of the country at the time that do not make for a pretty picture.The producers spend some time trying to demystify what the radical reconstruction governments did and did not do. This is done in the usual `even-handed' approach of PBS documentaries by the use of various individual life stories-a former slave, ex-Yankee officer and a woman plantation owner. That there were scandalous activities and more than enough corrupt politicians to go around goes without saying. However like most myths there is a snowball effect about how bad things really were that obliterates the very real advances for black (and some poor whites) like public education, improved roads and increased state facilities that were anathema to the planting class that formerly ruled the South.The second part of the documentary deals with the conservative counter-revolution in order to overthrow the radical governments culminating in the well-known Compromise of 1877. The actions of that Southern rabble, rich and poor whites alike, formed in militias and other para-military operations like the Klan is certainly not pretty. Moreover it took about a century and a `cold' civil war during the 1960's to even minimally right that situation (a battle that continues to this day). For those that need an in depth, definitive study of this subject you must turn to the master Eric Foner (who is also one of the `talking heads', another PBS standard practice, on screen) and his monumental Reconstruction, 1863-1877. However, if you want a shorter but nevertheless informative visual overview of Reconstruction this is your first stop.",4,Bottom Rail on Top,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,3166,"['Back', 'days', 'personal', 'pre-history', 'Reconstruction', 'period', 'directly', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'ended', '1865', 'was', 'cast', 'time', 'scalawags', 'carpetbaggers', 'Black', 'Codes', 'ultimately', 'determined', 'fight', 'right', 'people', 'South', 'redemption', 'short', 'time', 'shame', 'American', 'experience', 'least', 'implicitly', 'racist', 'slap', 'blacks', 'supporters', 'Well', 'so', 'much', 'certainly', 'was', 'plenty', 'went', 'wrong', 'radical', 'reconstruction', 'South', 'conventional', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'never', 'got', 'whole', 'story', 'did', 'want', 'whole', 'story', 'fairly', 'recently', 'radical', 'reconstruction', 'period', 'was', 'most', 'democratic', 'period', 'South', 'American', 'history', 'white', 'black', 'alike', 'Previously', 'have', 'written', 'book', 'subject', 'led', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'long', 'way', 'better', 'visual', 'understanding', 'what', 'went', 'period.The', 'first', 'part', 'Radical', 'Reconstruction', 'era', 'was', 'dominated', 'three', 'basic', 'plans', 'are', 'described', 'here', 'detail', 'aborted', 'Lincoln', 'soft', 'union', 'indivisible', 'efforts', 'Johnson', 'soft', 'redemption', 'plans', 'radical', 'Republican', 'scorched', 'earth', 'policy', 'South', 'end', 'none', 'plans', 'was', 'pursued', 'strongly', 'enough', 'insure', 'enhanced', 'black', 'rights', 'gained', 'legislation', 'would', 'lead', 'enlightened', 'citizenship', 'documentary', 'presents', 'detailed', 'critiques', 'plans', 'insights', 'social', 'cultural', 'mores', 'country', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'pretty', 'picture.The', 'producers', 'spend', 'time', 'trying', 'demystify', 'what', 'radical', 'reconstruction', 'governments', 'did', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'done', 'usual', 'even-handed', 'approach', 'PBS', 'documentaries', 'use', 'various', 'individual', 'life', 'stories-a', 'former', 'slave', 'ex-Yankee', 'officer', 'woman', 'plantation', 'owner', 'were', 'scandalous', 'activities', 'more', 'enough', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'go', 'around', 'saying', 'However', 'most', 'myths', 'snowball', 'effect', 'how', 'bad', 'things', 'really', 'were', 'very', 'real', 'advances', 'black', 'poor', 'whites', 'public', 'education', 'improved', 'roads', 'increased', 'state', 'facilities', 'were', 'anathema', 'planting', 'class', 'formerly', 'ruled', 'South.The', 'second', 'part', 'documentary', 'deals', 'conservative', 'counter-revolution', 'order', 'overthrow', 'radical', 'governments', 'culminating', 'well-known', 'Compromise', '1877', 'actions', 'Southern', 'rabble', 'rich', 'poor', 'whites', 'alike', 'formed', 'militias', 'other', 'para-military', 'operations', 'Klan', 'certainly', 'not', 'pretty', 'Moreover', 'took', 'about', 'century', 'cold', 'civil', 'war', '1960', 'even', 'minimally', 'right', 'situation', 'battle', 'day', 'need', 'depth', 'definitive', 'study', 'subject', 'must', 'turn', 'master', 'Eric', 'Foner', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'talking', 'heads', 'PBS', 'standard', 'practice', 'screen', 'monumental', 'Reconstruction', '1863-1877', 'However', 'want', 'shorter', 'nevertheless', 'informative', 'visual', 'overview', 'Reconstruction', 'first', 'stop']",N/A

This is so much quibbling.As a history teacher, I find myself perfectly capable of filling in the blanks in any film I present to my students, including this one.  NO documentary covers EVERY fact or point in great detail, either because of time constraints, or to maintain focus on the main point rather than digress into minutiae that is off the subject.  Speaking of such omissions, I find myself perfectly capable of discussing the Tenure of Office Act (which, with the Johnson impeachment, could be the subject of a film on its own) and the self-serving motives of some Radical Republicans of that era to give my students further context with which to understand this film, which I have done.The idea of showing a film without comment or discussion in the classroom is abhorrent, and to insinuate that this film would be presented to students in such a manner is equally so.  Additionally, viewers outside the classroom are most likely interested enough in the subject of Reconstruction to have done some reading beforehand, or some follow-up reading, since as I said above, no documentary film covers every point.This film is an excellent tool to augment any high school unit on Reconstruction after the Civil War, and one would do well to ignore the prejudices of reviewers who are more interested in taking potshots at liberals than in an honest review.",5,"Right-Wing Reviews ""Woefully Inadequate""",1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,1483,"['two', 'featured', 'paint', 'first-rate', 'documentary', 'inadequate', 'classroom', 'omitted', 'warts', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'teacher', 'find', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'filling', 'blanks', 'film', 'present', 'students', 'including', 'one', 'documentary', 'covers', 'EVERY', 'fact', 'point', 'great', 'detail', 'either', 'time', 'constraints', 'maintain', 'focus', 'main', 'point', 'rather', 'digress', 'minutiae', 'subject', 'Speaking', 'such', 'omissions', 'find', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'discussing', 'Tenure', 'Office', 'Act', 'Johnson', 'impeachment', 'could', 'be', 'subject', 'film', 'own', 'self-serving', 'motives', 'Radical', 'Republicans', 'era', 'give', 'students', 'further', 'context', 'understand', 'film', 'have', 'done.The', 'idea', 'showing', 'film', 'comment', 'discussion', 'classroom', 'abhorrent', 'insinuate', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'presented', 'students', 'such', 'manner', 'equally', 'so', 'Additionally', 'viewers', 'classroom', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'interested', 'enough', 'subject', 'Reconstruction', 'have', 'done', 'reading', 'beforehand', 'follow-up', 'reading', 'said', 'documentary', 'film', 'point.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'tool', 'augment', 'high', 'school', 'unit', 'Reconstruction', 'Civil', 'War', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'ignore', 'prejudices', 'reviewers', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'taking', 'potshots', 'liberals', 'honest', 'review']",N/A
875440,A2YXVFVKQ9SGGV,B0006Z2L6U,"B. Evans ""Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape""","[0, 0]","This was an outstanding film.  I was amazed to find that many of the reviewers knew very little about African-American history.  At the age of nine I rebuffed a statement by my fourth grade teacher who told me to shut up and sit down.  From that time on (1949) I realized I wasn't going to get much of an education in the New York public schools. I have been studying African-American and Third World History eversince -- which is about 64 years. I can only say that in most public schools, ignorance abounds. Anyone who can  with a straight face say that Lincoln really cared about the fate of the Negro, doesn't know his/her history.  Lincoln said that if he could preserve the Union without freeing the slaves, he would.  That is quite a statement for a man whose mother was a Melungeon (a free woman of color--black. Check out the DVD ""Hidden Colors"")  I am always tempted to burst out, either into tears or laughter when I see people standing beneath Lincoln's statue as if he cared what happened to slaves. The North/South fought each other to preserve their financial interests. To make matters worse, slavery continued after 1865 for another 80 years, using the penal system (it still does in some states)  Let's get real here.Any thinking person would buy this film, review it and also purchase the DVD, ""Slavery by Another name,"" and shake awake their neurons because they are obviously fast asleep. After 64 years of research, living abroad 30 of them, conducting observations and interviews with colonized people in the Third World (Africa, Australia and many other countries where there are indigenous people of color, I returned to America in 1993 and wondered when everyone had fallen asleep or whether there was something in the water.  In 1963 when I left, people were well aware of their history.  Today they all seem to be in 'fairy floss' land.

875443,APUHDIL2CEI3C,B0006Z2L6U,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[31, 87]","I will attempt to take a scholar's dispassionate view to critique this documentary.  However, with the time invested, and the fact that it is available to watch for FREE over the Internet, it demands a close scrutiny.First, one would hope that by 2004 such clear propaganda would be blatantaly suspect. The method used by Burns, at first captivating in the 1989 ""The Civil War"" weeklong docudrama, has become shopworn.  This method takes as ""representative"" the experiences and views of VERY few individuals--such as Vermonter Union Captian Twitchell, who attains a Freedman's Bureau commission to govern Bienville Pariesh in Northwest Louisiana, and that of Kay Stone, who returns from refuge in Texas to find her family plantation in ruins.  The ""stories"" of newly freed slaves who become politicians, and the tumultuous period of time running from Sherman's infamous Field Order 15 to the narrow vote on impeachment of Andrew Johnson, setting the stage for the election of U.S. Grant, Federal quelling of the riots accompanying the Constitutional Convention of Louisiana in New Orleans....are just that--stories--and dare anyone say ""representative"" of anything?Today the Congress faces possible spending of up to $500,000 per capita to ""rebuild"" New Orleans after hurricane Katrina.  The economic depression of the 1870s is blamed for the ""abandonment"" of Radical Reconstruction--which amounted to a continued War of Northern Oppression on Southern Society--dare one say to the ignorance of social stratification resulting from immigration to the large cities of the Northeast?This PBS documentary, funded by major corporations, is nothing short of an abomination.  It uses Burns' ""entertaining"" documentary method to do nothing short of incite further racism of which this country is surely weary.  You cannot have a meritocracy at the same time as modern politicians, deeply rooted in slaveocracy as a raison d'etre, propose ""reparations"" for deeds done long ago.Innuendo is not documentary scholarship.  A case in point--the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, where veterans of the Blue and Gray, just as at the 75th anniversary, at which FDR spoke, presumably were all white.  What is the basis for the innuendo?  I don't know.  However, Stephen D. Lee's 1896 admonition to the United Confederate Veterans, which became the Sons of Confederate Veteran's, to remember the values and sacrifices of one's ancestors, is not racist and many free blacks fought in the Confederate Army by choice, as did the Cherokee Nation.  It is well established that memory is selective and this documentary does no more than establish that selective memory in the form of ""scholarship"" or ""documentary"" work at least foments misperception and at worst possibly violence, if only in the distorted imagination.I would recommend that the reader spend time with Dinesh D'Sousa's ""What's So Great About America""  for INSPRIATION rather than spend 3 hours mired in a distorted account of ""Reconstruction"" and perpetuation of racist myths.  Another excellent read is ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History"" by Thomans E. Woods, Jr., Ph.D.  It is probably NOT accidental that a portrait of a Confederate General graces the cover of the dustjacket of this book.  Many Southerners are of the opinion that the War of Northern Aggression was also a second war of Independence from rule by a foreign power--which Mr. Lincoln put under Marshal Law and suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus.  The ""Civil War"" lasted at least twenty years--not four, and truly representative government still hangs in the balance.  Would anyone reasonably assert that the ""American Experiment"" is concluded?Postscript:  I find it altogether predictable that this ""documentary"" would produce some controversy.  The manner in which the Civil War and Reconstruction are presented to the public is a matter of considerable significance, even in 2006.  I think that all reviewers would agree on this.  Scanning my other reviews to attempt to create some ""political profile"" by which an ad hominem attack can be launched is somewhat disingenuous, however.  The bias evident in this film can be gleaned easily from the sources mentioned in my review, which are not political works per se.  They are historical.

875445,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006Z2L6U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[69, 76]","If there is a villain behind the curtain of the tragic story of Reconstruction, then that would have to be John Wilkes Booth. ""Reconstruction: The Second Civil War"" basically begins with Lincoln's assassination, but the harm that Booth unleashed on the South by removing the compassionate Lincoln from the political stage and empowering the Radical Republicans in Congress to appease their demands for Southern subjugation is a profound irony. Still, if there is a clear lesson from this ""American Experience"" documentary, it is that the South might have lost the Civil War but they managed to win Reconstruction.This two-part PBS documentary covers the momentous years 1863 to 1877. Part I, ""Revolution"" produced and directed by Llewellyn M. Smith, begins with Lincoln's warning that Reconstruction would be ""fraught with great difficulty,"" and ends in 1867 when Congress passed the Radical Republican's Reconstruction plan that divided the former Confederacy into five military districts, each commanded by a General with power to enforce law and administer justice. New southern governments would be created but were required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment and allow black men the right to vote, which saw former slaves running and be elected to public office. Part II, ""Retreat,"" produced and directed by Elizabeth Deane shows how the Democrats slowly but surely took power back in the Southern states and achieved ""redemption"" for white Southerners. A compelling case is made for the acquiescence of Northerners with the concern of Southern whites for keeping the blacks subordinate, and one of the more interesting episodes concerns the White League, which went after carpetbaggers the way the Ku Klux Klan was going after freedmen (I am surprised I had never heard of the Coushatta massacre before this). When President Grant sends federal troops to take the Louisiana legislature back from a takeover by the White League, it is an intervention that apparently offends Northerners as much as it did Southerners (but an armed mob taking over a state legislature is apparently okay). By the time you get to the end of this documentary you are convinced that the Civil War was a tragedy, but Reconstruction was a farce.While this documentary covers the history and politics of the period it also focuses on a series of key individuals to tell the story of Reconstruction, much as Ken Burns did in ""The Civil War."" Marshall Twitchell, a former Yankee officer from Vermont, became a successful ""Carpetbagger"" in Louisiana who had a violent neighbor in planter B. W. Marston (whose descendant tells his family's side of the story. Fan Butler tried to keep her family's Georgia plantations, which grew rice, afloat through sharecropping. John Roy Lynch was a freed slave who succeeded in politics because of Reconstruction, while Tunis Campbell tried to stop whites from controlling blacks in his county and measured his idealism with provocative efforts that made him a target for trying to give the Negro supremacy over the white man. You can make your own judgment as to how representative these choices are as focal characters, given that they represent both Southern and Northern as well as white and black Americans, but they do allow the history to be personalized as well as setting up the historians being interviewed to speak to the greater significance of their individual stories.With regards to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, I would contend that it does not necessarily need to be turned into a question of Reconstruction. Johnson's crime was not that he wanted to fire a member of his cabinet, but rather than he tried to fire a Radical Republican when, you have to remember, he was neither. Abraham Lincoln was not re-elected to the presidency as a Republican, but rather as a member of the ""Union"" party, with Johnson, a Democrat who was the only U.S. Senator from the South not to resign following secession, as his running mate. The first part of this documentary does a good job of trashing Johnson as racist who even betrayed his allegiance to poor whites over the planters because of his disregard for the freed slaves. By the time Grant takes over the White House from Johnson there is simply too much momentum behind Reconstruction for any chief executive to do anything about it. Even when the Congress passes civil rights legislation it is not enforced as the Democrats regain control of the South and eventually the laws are declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. It would take a century for those rights to be passed again and actually become the law of the land.",4,"The South loses the Civil War but wins Reconstruction,",1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,4608,"['villain', 'curtain', 'tragic', 'story', 'Reconstruction', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'Reconstruction', 'Second', 'Civil', 'War', 'basically', 'Lincoln', 'assassination', 'harm', 'Booth', 'unleashed', 'South', 'removing', 'compassionate', 'Lincoln', 'political', 'stage', 'empowering', 'Radical', 'Republicans', 'Congress', 'appease', 'demands', 'Southern', 'subjugation', 'profound', 'irony', 'Still', 'clear', 'lesson', 'American', 'Experience', 'documentary', 'South', 'might', 'have', 'lost', 'Civil', 'War', 'managed', 'win', 'Reconstruction.This', 'two-part', 'PBS', 'documentary', 'momentous', 'years', '1863', '1877', 'Part', 'Revolution', 'produced', 'directed', 'Llewellyn', 'M.', 'Smith', 'Lincoln', 'warning', 'Reconstruction', 'would', 'be', 'fraught', 'great', 'difficulty', '1867', 'when', 'Congress', 'passed', 'Radical', 'Republican', 'Reconstruction', 'plan', 'divided', 'former', 'Confederacy', 'five', 'military', 'districts', 'commanded', 'General', 'power', 'enforce', 'law', 'administer', 'justice', 'New', 'southern', 'governments', 'would', 'be', 'created', 'were', 'required', 'ratify', 'Fourteenth', 'Amendment', 'allow', 'black', 'men', 'right', 'vote', 'saw', 'former', 'slaves', 'running', 'be', 'elected', 'public', 'office', 'Part', 'II', 'Retreat', 'produced', 'directed', 'Elizabeth', 'Deane', 'how', 'Democrats', 'slowly', 'surely', 'took', 'power', 'back', 'Southern', 'states', 'achieved', 'redemption', 'white', 'Southerners', 'compelling', 'case', 'made', 'acquiescence', 'Northerners', 'concern', 'Southern', 'whites', 'keeping', 'blacks', 'subordinate', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'concerns', 'White', 'League', 'went', 'carpetbaggers', 'way', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'was', 'going', 'freedmen', 'am', 'surprised', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Coushatta', 'massacre', 'When', 'President', 'Grant', 'federal', 'troops', 'take', 'Louisiana', 'legislature', 'back', 'takeover', 'White', 'League', 'intervention', 'apparently', 'Northerners', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Southerners', 'armed', 'mob', 'taking', 'over', 'state', 'legislature', 'apparently', 'okay', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'documentary', 'are', 'convinced', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'tragedy', 'Reconstruction', 'was', 'farce.While', 'documentary', 'history', 'politics', 'period', 'also', 'series', 'key', 'individuals', 'tell', 'story', 'Reconstruction', 'much', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'did', 'Civil', 'War', 'Marshall', 'Twitchell', 'former', 'Yankee', 'officer', 'Vermont', 'became', 'successful', 'Carpetbagger', 'Louisiana', 'who', 'had', 'violent', 'neighbor', 'planter', 'B.', 'W.', 'Marston', 'descendant', 'family', 'side', 'story', 'Fan', 'Butler', 'tried', 'keep', 'family', 'Georgia', 'plantations', 'grew', 'rice', 'afloat', 'sharecropping', 'John', 'Roy', 'Lynch', 'was', 'freed', 'slave', 'who', 'succeeded', 'politics', 'Reconstruction', 'Tunis', 'Campbell', 'tried', 'stop', 'whites', 'controlling', 'blacks', 'county', 'measured', 'idealism', 'provocative', 'efforts', 'made', 'target', 'trying', 'give', 'Negro', 'supremacy', 'white', 'man', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'judgment', 'how', 'representative', 'choices', 'are', 'focal', 'characters', 'given', 'represent', 'Southern', 'Northern', 'as', 'well', 'white', 'black', 'Americans', 'do', 'allow', 'history', 'be', 'personalized', 'as', 'well', 'setting', 'up', 'historians', 'being', 'interviewed', 'speak', 'greater', 'significance', 'individual', 'stories.With', 'regards', 'impeachment', 'Andrew', 'Johnson', 'would', 'contend', 'not', 'necessarily', 'need', 'be', 'turned', 'question', 'Reconstruction', 'Johnson', 'crime', 'was', 'not', 'wanted', 'fire', 'member', 'cabinet', 'rather', 'tried', 'fire', 'Radical', 'Republican', 'when', 'have', 'remember', 'was', 'neither', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'not', 're-elected', 'presidency', 'Republican', 'rather', 'member', 'Union', 'party', 'Johnson', 'Democrat', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'South', 'not', 'resign', 'following', 'secession', 'running', 'mate', 'first', 'part', 'documentary', 'good', 'job', 'trashing', 'Johnson', 'racist', 'who', 'even', 'betrayed', 'allegiance', 'poor', 'whites', 'planters', 'disregard', 'freed', 'slaves', 'time', 'Grant', 'White', 'House', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'momentum', 'Reconstruction', 'chief', 'executive', 'do', 'anything', 'Even', 'when', 'Congress', 'civil', 'rights', 'legislation', 'not', 'enforced', 'Democrats', 'regain', 'control', 'South', 'eventually', 'laws', 'are', 'declared', 'unconstitutional', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'would', 'take', 'century', 'rights', 'be', 'passed', 'again', 'actually', 'become', 'law', 'land']",N/A

STORIES ARE TOLD FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF FOUR CHARACTERS:  A BLACK ACTIVIST, A BLACK LEGISLATOR, A WHITE WOMAN PLANTATION OWNER AND A YANKEE CARPETBAGGER.  WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL STORIES ARE COMPELLING, THE OVERALL DETAILS OF RECONSTRUCTION ARE IN MANY CASES GLOSSED OVER. SOUTHERN SCALAWAGS ARE NOT MENTIONED ONCE IN PART 2 NOR IS THERE A MENTION OF THE JIM CROW LAWS THAT FOLLOWED THE RESTORATION OF SOUTHERN SELF-RULE.  SHARECROPPING, A FORM OF ECONOMIC SLAVERY IS BARELY REFERRED TO.  THE RISE OF THE KKK IS MICROSCOPICLY APPROACHED, ALTHOUGH THE HATE GENERATED BY WHITE RACISTS IS WELL REVEALED.  AT 180 MINUTES IT IS WAY TOO LONG FOR USE IN A CLASSROOM, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS AND COULD BE EDITED.  AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL IT WAS ADEQUATE.  IT DID CONTAIN SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE ROLE OF PRESIDENT GRANT AND RECONSTRUCTION LARGELY NOT COVERED IN MOST U.S. HISTORY TEXTS, AND GLOSSES OVER THE COMPROMISE OF 1877, THAT ALLOWED SOUTHERNERS TO REASSERT RACISM IN PLACE OF SLAVERY AS THE METHOD OF MAINTAINING WHITE SUPREMACY IN THE SOUTH.",3,EXPECTED MORE!!!,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,1191,"['THIS', 'ENTRY', 'FROM', 'THE', 'AMERICAN', 'EXPERIENCE', 'SERIES', 'WAS', 'DONE', 'WELL', 'BUT', 'SLIGHLY', 'MISSED', 'THE', 'TARGET', 'IN', 'MY', 'OPINION', 'THE', 'VIDEO', 'LACKED', 'SWEEP', 'STORIES', 'ARE', 'TOLD', 'FROM', 'THE', 'VIEWPOINTS', 'FOUR', 'CHARACTERS', 'BLACK', 'ACTIVIST', 'A', 'BLACK', 'LEGISLATOR', 'A', 'WHITE', 'WOMAN', 'PLANTATION', 'OWNER', 'A', 'YANKEE', 'CARPETBAGGER', 'INDIVIDUAL', 'STORIES', 'ARE', 'COMPELLING', 'THE', 'OVERALL', 'DETAILS', 'RECONSTRUCTION', 'ARE', 'IN', 'MANY', 'CASES', 'GLOSSED', 'OVER', 'SOUTHERN', 'SCALAWAGS', 'ARE', 'NOT', 'MENTIONED', 'ONCE', 'IN', 'PART', '2', 'NOR', 'IS', 'THERE', 'A', 'MENTION', 'THE', 'JIM', 'CROW', 'LAWS', 'THAT', 'FOLLOWED', 'RESTORATION', 'OF', 'SOUTHERN', 'SELF-RULE', 'SHARECROPPING', 'FORM', 'OF', 'ECONOMIC', 'SLAVERY', 'IS', 'BARELY', 'REFERRED', 'TO', 'THE', 'RISE', 'THE', 'KKK', 'IS', 'MICROSCOPICLY', 'APPROACHED', 'ALTHOUGH', 'THE', 'HATE', 'GENERATED', 'BY', 'WHITE', 'RACISTS', 'IS', 'WELL', 'REVEALED', 'AT', '180', 'MINUTES', 'IT', 'IS', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'LONG', 'FOR', 'USE', 'IN', 'A', 'CLASSROOM', 'ALTHOUGH', 'IT', 'IS', 'DIVIDED', 'INTO', 'TWO', 'SECTIONS', 'AND', 'COULD', 'BE', 'EDITED', 'AN', 'EDUCATIONAL', 'TOOL', 'IT', 'WAS', 'ADEQUATE', 'IT', 'DID', 'CONTAIN', 'SOME', 'INFORMATION', 'THE', 'ROLE', 'OF', 'PRESIDENT', 'GRANT', 'AND', 'RECONSTRUCTION', 'LARGELY', 'NOT', 'COVERED', 'IN', 'MOST', 'U.S.', 'HISTORY', 'TEXTS', 'AND', 'GLOSSES', 'OVER', 'THE', 'COMPROMISE', 'OF', '1877', 'ALLOWED', 'SOUTHERNERS', 'TO', 'REASSERT', 'RACISM', 'IN', 'PLACE', 'OF', 'SLAVERY', 'THE', 'METHOD', 'OF', 'MAINTAINING', 'WHITE', 'SUPREMACY', 'IN', 'THE', 'SOUTH']",N/A
