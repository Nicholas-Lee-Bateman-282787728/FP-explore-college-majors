I'm sure most of you feel like I do, today's horror movies or movies in general are just remakes of movies we've seen a million times.However, I've never seen anything like this movie, there was no $50 Million budget or mind blowing CGI, just a great plot and an atmosphere that draws you in. Granted the idea of being stalked by a bunch of twisted, disfigured kids may need seem scary but in this regard it actually was. The directing in this movie was great, I actually felt as if I could relate to the main character and feel his pain, fear and sorrow.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a somewhat original movie, you'll like it and afterwards maybe even feel a little paranoid, LOL.GO INDEPENDENT FILMS !!!!!!",4,Hoorah for Independent Films,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,794,"['Independent', 'films', 'are', 'now', 'most', 'favorite', 'movies', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'feel', 'do', 'today', 'horror', 'movies', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'just', 'remakes', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'million', 'times.However', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', '50', 'Million', 'budget', 'mind', 'blowing', 'CGI', 'just', 'great', 'plot', 'atmosphere', 'Granted', 'idea', 'being', 'stalked', 'bunch', 'twisted', 'disfigured', 'kids', 'may', 'need', 'seem', 'scary', 'regard', 'actually', 'was', 'directing', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'actually', 'felt', 'could', 'relate', 'main', 'character', 'feel', 'pain', 'fear', 'sorrow.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'somewhat', 'original', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'like', 'afterwards', 'maybe', 'even', 'feel', 'little', 'paranoid', 'LOL.GO', 'INDEPENDENT', 'FILMS']",N/A

Why, every time you turn around, some production company is throwing good money into some low-budget, no-budget scare-fest, all to make a buck.  I welcome the additions to my film library only so long as these pictures still come assembled with a coherent story, reasonably intelligent characters (a tough find in horror), and modest quality writing.  No, horror movies don't have to be perfect.  They simply need establish a premise and then deliver on any promises made along the way.To that end, CITADEL settles comfortably into a middle-ground and goes nowhere fast.  Yes, it's atmospheric.  Sure, it's creepy.  Okay, it looks so dystopian.But is that all ya got?(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest  hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Tommy (played by Aneurin Barnard) enjoys a quiet existence with his pregnant wife in a massive apartment complex on the edge of town.  Little do they know, but their CITADEL is actually some hunting grounds for a pack of ravenous children.  A sudden attack leaves his wife permanently in a coma, and Tommy - left to raise their child on his own - is stricken with a case of agoraphobia.  Nine months later, the gang returns and takes the man's child.  Can he face his fears and join forces with an area priest (James Cosmo) to take back the child?  And what secret is the old man hiding?This is one of those times when I know I'll take a few on the chin from folks who disagree, but, if anything, I gotta be me; I found much of the CITADEL a disappointment.  I can appreciate some quality scares as much as the next person.  Where I differ (I believe) is that I want them delivered in a package that makes sense.  Otherwise, I find the story and their resulting scares to be less than authentic.  There were parts of the film that felt heavily truncated to me, such as why was Tommy so shaken up by his wife's attack that he developed agoraphobia?  He seemed perfectly normal before the attack - he gets on elevators, he goes indoors and outdoors by himself, he came across as perfectly well-adjusted as anyone could be in those few moments of peace - so his transformation (while an impressive bit of acting) just felt hollow.Furthermore, if (as we're told) these `creatures' are the result of some shenanigans done years ago by the resident member of the clergy, why did they take so long to prey on Tommy and his defenseless wife?  Where were they before?  What caused them to migrate to this particular building complex?  And why did they give Tommy nine months off?  I get that the place was, essentially, condemned and void of residents, but why did Tommy and his wife decide to stay in this urban wasteland entirely alone?  And, if they were truly entirely alone, why was Tommy crying out for help when he discovered his wife was attacked?  We were never shown any other person around - not in the building, not on the streets, etc. - so what WAS this place, really?And, as long as I'm in classic harp mode, just what ARE these hooded gang/children?  Clearly, they have some attachment to drugs (they're often seem with syringes), but, since the neighborhood is all but deserted, just who is selling to them?  Part man, part creature, part cannibal, part addict ... and part nonsense!  The audience is given some vague explanation of their origins by the Priest (actually, he gives two different versions, but I won't spoil it), yet Cosmo's line delivery is so awful I'll have to admit to listening to it three times and I still couldn't quite understand him.  As I've had to say in reviews before, I have no problem watching foreign films, but I'd sure appreciate that producers include English subtitles because, as an American, I'll admit that I'm occasionally confused by accents.  Cosmo delivers every speech as though he has a mouthful of Krispy Kremes, and this only adds to the confusion.Still, Barnard gets some solid marks for doing what he could with the lackluster script.  His struggle with an incapacitating agoraphobia is impressive.  In fact, that's the only plotline of the film that gets carried through with solid development, though I still don't quite get how he developed it so quickly as a consequence of his wife being attacked.  Color me nave.CITADEL is produced by Blinder Films, Irish Film Board, Flatiron Film Company, and Sigma Films.  DVD distribution is being handled through New Video.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks pretty solid - much of it is shot in dark settings and enclosed spaces (to enhance the agoraphobia) - but there were some issues with the sound - the opening is very sparse, but halfway through the levels suddenly jumped way up.  (This may've been the result of some post-production tinkering.)  The disk comes with a few special features - a `making of' short, cast and crew interviews, and some discarded B roll footage - nothing all that grand, but it's nice to have something.MILDLY RECOMMENDED.  It isn't that I disliked CITADEL because, in fairness, I didn't.  What I found curious was the fact that there was so little to it - so little explanation for the development of our lead's condition; so little scientific explanation for where these `creatures' came from; so little character information available on almost everyone in the story - that I found it hard to sink my teeth into, unlike these cannibal/children/druggie/half-breed children.  And, on that note, just what WERE they?  When you have a monster, is it too much to ask that its creation make a little sense?In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with an advance DVD screener of CITADEL for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2,Inspired Main Performance Not Enough To Save This CITADEL,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,6067,"['week', 'horror',

1600570,A5EEGUOAKPK9A,B009NP1ZPW,"Jeff Sekerak ""Vegan Fitness, Great Fiction, a...","[0, 0]","Yes, it truly IS a terrifying little film. A man, his wife, their baby are victimized by a group of SEEMINGLY human, youngsters. This, in a rather run-down, bleak-looking, grayish apartment complex, in Ireland; with the cold, dreary, by-the-looks-of-it, always cloudy weather, not helping matters any, in terms of 'cheeriness.''Spoilers,' ahead, by the way, I should mention. Here's one of them, to start: The wife doesn't make it. No, she is assaulted, quite early in the story, by a group of three young hooligans, while her husband, the protagonist, is in the apartment elevator. Looking through a window. Viewing his wife's imminent demise. A scary scene, to be sure, well filmed. She is, due to the assault, put into a coma, never to wake again.Yet her baby survives. And this is where the story essentially, 'takes off.' As her husband, now dwelling in a new apartment unit, cannot figure why the young 'monsters' who killed his wife, are still coming after him, and his baby. Staking about, outside his unit. Breaking windows. Generally scaring the he#@ out of both the protagonist, and us, the viewing audience. And attempting access to his apartment and apparently, to his child. The answer, in a rather vague way, is forthcoming.He garners emotional support, after his wife's funeral, from a nurse friend. She is of the opinion, that the attack on his family was a mere 'random occurrence.' And that the perpetrators are more than likely in need of love, rather than, say death, or imprisonment - as, she contends, far too many would have it. A faulty judgement on her part. Which we see played out, in a horrific scene in a tunnel, as the film progresses...It does not go well for her.The protagonist also receives help - yet in a different manner - from the priest who attended his wife's funeral. He, the priest, in contrast to the nurse, is of the opinion that the monstrous children in question, may not even be human. And that they certainly must be dealt with in a harsher manner - to put it mildly - than the nurse believed. In fact, he'd like to see the dilapidated building in which they dwell, burnt to the ground.This contrast between opinions on the nature of the creatures, is what constructs ONE of the two major themes presented in the film. The first being that, as we see played out before us, as the priest believes, evil truly DOES exist. And must be fought, battled against, as opposed to being dealt with, as the nurse contends, with love. The second theme? That fear is the root of evil; and must be faced and overcome, for that evil to be 'squashed.' That is the job of our protagonist. I'll leave you to watch, to find if he succeeds, or fails, in that job.And yes, I'd say it's worth viewing to find out. As the film is EXTREMELY well directed. Not too much, 'jerking of the camera', Blair-Witch style. Which, of course, has been one of the primary tools used in most low-budget horror films of late; particularly since the financial success of the Paranormal Activity films. A tool which, in my personal opinion is NOT 'edgy.' Not, engaging in any way. In fact, one which causes more dizzy spells and headaches in an audience, than alleged, 'fear.' And a tool which, if I had any input on the matter, I'd say, 'ought to be 'placed on the shelf,' of film-making history - permanently.'More on the direction: Yes, good, minimalistic, simple camera work. Also: Excellent use of a minimalistic soundtrack, to match. Not overbearing. Not 'bombastic' or cartoon-like, in any way. Generally subdued. So that when it IS used, it is effective. And it is used, in all the right places. Nonexistent, during scenes of the commonplace. Menacing, low, disturbing, discordant, in scenes featuring the stalking, predator children. Scenes which ARE truly well-done, I might add. With the 'little monsters' always seemingly just out of full view. Just visible out of the peripheral, 'corner of the eye.' Scary indeed. And the soundtrack is boosted, perceptibly, during the moments of final confrontation between protagonist and priest, and their adversaries, the 'monster children.'All in all? Great soundtrack. Great, minimalistic use of camera, to match theme, locale, and overall story-line. AND, excellent, convincing performances by protagonist, priest, nurse, and 'creatures themselves.'The one, perhaps, 'hole' in the film's construction? Well, I'd say it has to do with our knowing weather or not these creatures ARE truly inhuman, demonic, or weather they are simply victims of a society which has thrown them away; into 'gutters' like the falling-apart complex, the 'Citadel.' You see, if it's the latter, then these characters tend to garner, with me personally, anyway - and I believe, with most of Man - sympathy from us, the audience. Yet if it's the former? Well then: I'm with the priest. No ambiguity there. The creatures must be dealt with, in the harshest possible manner. 'Cut out like my own cancer' as he puts it, at one point, pointing to a growth on his forearm.And this is the problem: We, the audience, receive mixed signals as to the inherent, nature of the creatures. Are they demonic, and in need of destruction, by our priest character, and protagonist? Or are they, as the nurse suggests, simply victims of an inhuman, non-empathetic, society? In which case they might require, simply a bit of, 'remedial behavior modification.' The question is never satisfactorily answered. Either way however, the fact that we, the audience, are in question about the matter, dissipates the film's previously, rather palpable, well drawn, sense of fear. A fear which, though well-created by the writer/director, might be even more convincing, compelling, and less ambiguous, were the creatures CLEARLY inhuman; and NOT, perhaps, worthy of potential sympathy - by even the most empathetic members of our viewing audience.The good news? The question as to the nature of the villainous children here, does not alter the notion that the protagonist must learn to overcome his own fear, in dealing with them. And that is, I'd say, the primary theme of the film. The idea that one cannot move forward at all, without confronting, overcoming one's fear. The secondary theme being that evil, as the priest character reveals, DOES likely exist. And cannot be 'bargained' with, in any way.So. Overall? A VERY well-directed, terrifying in places, little film. Great performances, excellent work, by all involved. A piece of work which stays beautifully, within its means, and the confines of its plot. Doesn't go for cheap thrills, loud soundtrack,  digital alteration of any sort, or what I'd call 'obnoxious camera-work,' to create its well-drawn, disturbing little mood. Also, more than a few truly horrific moments. Particularly as the protagonist is stalked in his new abode, by the relentless, seemingly inhuman predators. I'll be VERY much looking forward to the next film by writer/director, C. Foy. And I do recommend this one, highly. A very good one. Just short of being, 'superlative.' And time well-spent. I'd suggest only an even clearer 'argument' as to the true nature of the villain. And, perhaps, that nature - that answer - CLEARLY being one, NOT potentially garnering sympathy...From anyone.",4,"A terrifying little film, with just one 'hole' in it...",1366588800,"04 22,

1600573,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009NP1ZPW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 14]","There are a lot of really great things going for the low-budget indie shocker ""Citadel.""  This Irish film starts out strong, boasts a solid lead performance, and paints a harrowing portrait of urban decay.  While the picture is very successful at creating a creepy vibe which it sustains throughout, I'm not sure that the mythology or storytelling is quite as strong as its atmosphere.  In the end, I enjoyed much of the movie without really ever buying into its premise fully.  And although the plot threads are deadly serious, I found some of the developments rather amusing as opposed to horrifying.  In the end, I think ""Citadel"" is worth a look but I wanted its payoff and its explanations to be better realized.  It's certainly not a bad movie, I just don't think it makes much sense in the grand scheme of things.As I said, I really invested into the opening of the film.  As a young couple is moving from a dilapidated building, a gang of street thugs happens upon the pregnant wife.  A seemingly random act of violence will forever change our protagonist's life.  Aneurin Barnard plays the husband and father haunted by this day.  As he withdrawals from the world, plagued by agoraphobia, he is continuously threatened by hooded kids just like the ones that attacked his family.  What do they want?  They seem to be fixated on his daughter.  But how do you protect your family when you are wracked by fear?  As a psychological horror story, ""Citadel"" is actually quite accomplished.  The arrival of the thugs is always spectacularly creepy and quite unpredictable.  It makes the entire experience unsettling, which is surely what was intended.  However, as the plot deepens, the more explanation that is given to what is happening--the less successful that I felt the story became.When it was hard to gauge what was reality and what might be the madness, paranoia, and fear of Barnard's character, I thought ""Citadel"" worked.  But as other characters are introduced, including a very unorthodox priest and a blind boy, the tale became much more convoluted.  They try to explain the unexplainable, and that's what left me wanting more.  And while the finale had some tense moments, this horror story is actually wrapped up pretty simply.  As the credits rolled, two friends looked over at me and said ""Well, that didn't make much sense!""  And truthfully, I had to agree.  I do think, however, that the filmmaker had a knack for putting together creepy scenes and that Barnard was fantastic.  As Bernard slowly unravels and then picks himself up again, it's a surprisingly deft transformation.  I'd would be interested to check out what both Bernard and writer/director Ciaran Foy have in store next.

A few days ago, I reviewed 6 SOULS, a dark movie that dealt with multiple personality disorders.  Today I offer you CITADEL, an extremely effective trip into terror that uses agoraphobia (basically, the fear of going outside) as its foundation.  Taut and disturbing, this film will take you to the edge of horror and then push you over.This movie kept me tense and on-edge throughout its entirety.  The aspect of Tommy's baby girl in danger along with him only made the movie more intense, and I actually had to stand up a couple of times while watching the film because I was so nervous.  This is exactly the kind of reaction a horror movie is supposed to give, and CITADEL offers plenty of reasons to give them.The film is shot well and the production value looks very high.  It is a collaboration between Ireland and UK film companies, and every facet of the film looks excellent onscreen.I am particularly impressed with the acting in CITADEL.  Aneurin Barnard portrays the main character, Tommy, and does a stunning job in the role.  His wide emotional range and vivid attention to detail are a sight to behold.  He doesn't just play Tommy, he is Tommy.  Also noteworthy is James Cosmo, the iconic actor who portrays the priest.  I enjoyed his work in GAME OF THRONES and SONS OF ANARCHY, so it is a joy to see him here.CITADEL is a huge win for me and I would wager any fan of horror and/or thrillers will enjoy it.  Be prepared for a heck of ride, though; this is not a film that you can sit idly through.

I clicked on various different lists and this movie was featured on nearly all of them. I looked at its IMDb rating and was disappointed with its low rating so I didn't really feel motivated to see it. But I was at Wal Mart and saw this movie there on sale and I just impulsively purchased it hoping the low rating was wrong. I am very glad I decided to buy this movie.-Spoilers-A young man is left widowed and damaged with agoraphobia after his pregnant wife is randomly attacked by a group of hooded kids. The baby is saved while the wife is left comatose for a few months until she finally passes. The young man is now raising the daughter alone in his panicked agoraphobic state. Then one day the hooded kids kidnap his daughter. With the help of a badmouthed priest and his son, he must rescue his daughter and learn the truth about these demonic hooded children.Don't be fooled by the clich&eacute;d plot. This movie is one of the more original horror films in the past 10 years. Its a shame it hasn't found a decent release in the US. I'm sure if this was given a theatrical release during the Halloween season it would've been a decent hit. This is the second best traditional horror movie released in 2012 behind Sinister in my opinion. There is something just eerie and unsettling about this film. The terror starts off within 5 minutes with a heart pumping intro. Then the more dramatic aspect takes place for about 20 minutes so that we can get to know the characters. The last half of the movie is just genius horror film making. Sure many things are questionable about this movie, but who cares? Its a great spooky film to watch in the dark alone or with a lover or friends. The cinematography is very well done for a first time director. The directing itself reminded me of Danny Boyles '28 Days Later' in some aspects. The acting is pretty good for a low budget film. There are many scenes that are just perfectly executed even though some of the characters decisions are typical Horror movie clich&eacute;s. There is a fantastically creeping scene on the bus that will surely stick with most viewers long after seeing this movie. The music is great like most horror films from Europe. The demonic hooded children are some of the scariest horror villains in a long time. Many old school horror fans will think of 'The Brood' when they see the evil kids in this film. But honestly these kids are more menacing and scary. The director is certainly someone to watch out for in the future.Though the movie is not popular yet among US viewers since it has only seen a DVD/Blu Ray release without any advertisement, I think it has potential to explode in popularity. I do hope that the horror fans that appreciate true good horror will spread the word on this movie and help it become the cult classic it is destined to be. Hopefully the rating goes up. Trust me, this movie is one of the good horror movies. There is only one criticism I have for the DVD.  There is no subtitle option, which is annoying at times since there are a few moments of dialogue that are hard to understand.  Either way it's honestly worth a purchase or at least a redbox rental.

A representation of many youngsters today as unemployment grows, creating a frustrated and isolated generation. The film is shot using a handheld camera, offering a close and suffocating atmosphere, especially when the camera is used to personify Tommy's fears.Most of the violence is narrated off-screen; instead the action is shown through shadows, reflections, and sounds. The shots are compiled well, a particular favourite set in the cemetery.Citadel is not as violent and shocking as its predecessors. Through the choice of a small cast, and limited sets, it offers a narrative focused on personalizing the story.
