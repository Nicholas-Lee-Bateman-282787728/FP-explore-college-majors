In a gentle manner the tale of a young couple falling in love is revealed in the opening sequences and then we meet that same couple decades later, after time, marriage to other people, family, and the world has smeared that tenuous prelude. The man learns his first love lives nearby, they meet, their love is renewed, and the woman must decide whether to follow her heart ( in her late sixties) or remain in a marriage without passion.  Simple story, the details are best left out as they might destroy the impact of this lovely film.  It is enough to say that the writer and director have presented a love story about people nearing seventy and have made that story as tender and erotic as if it were about youth.  The cycle of life, the consequences of choices, and the rare vision of the dignity of the beauty of aging are of more importance here.  In a time when the world population of Senior Citizens is rapidly expanding it is refreshing to come across a movie that makes aging not only OK, but actually a state to anticipate with a glow.",4,The beauties of aging,1042848000,"01 18, 2003",2003,1138,"['INNOCENCE', 'sonata', 'love', 'first', 'love', 'interrupted', 'love', 'lost', 'love', 'rekindled', 'love', 'gentle', 'manner', 'tale', 'young', 'couple', 'falling', 'love', 'revealed', 'opening', 'sequences', 'then', 'meet', 'same', 'couple', 'decades', 'later', 'time', 'marriage', 'other', 'people', 'family', 'world', 'smeared', 'tenuous', 'prelude', 'man', 'first', 'love', 'nearby', 'meet', 'love', 'renewed', 'woman', 'must', 'decide', 'follow', 'heart', 'late', 'sixties', 'remain', 'marriage', 'passion', 'Simple', 'story', 'details', 'are', 'best', 'left', 'out', 'might', 'destroy', 'impact', 'lovely', 'film', 'enough', 'say', 'writer', 'director', 'have', 'presented', 'love', 'story', 'people', 'nearing', 'seventy', 'have', 'made', 'story', 'tender', 'erotic', 'were', 'about', 'youth', 'cycle', 'life', 'consequences', 'choices', 'rare', 'vision', 'dignity', 'beauty', 'aging', 'are', 'more', 'importance', 'here', 'time', 'when', 'world', 'population', 'Senior', 'Citizens', 'rapidly', 'expanding', 'refreshing', 'come', 'movie', 'aging', 'not', 'only', 'OK', 'actually', 'state', 'anticipate', 'glow']",Innocence

Most poignant is the juxtaposition of the revived romance with images of Andreas and Claire's earlier passion, when their whole adult lives lay before them. Though Tingwell seems a bit rickety for Andreas, his performance still resonates, but Blake steals it as Claire, a woman facing unexpected joy- and pain- late in life.",5,Innocence,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,474,"['sweet', 'tender', 'December/December', 'romance', 'tricky', 'premise', 'finesse', 'feeling', 'thanks', 'sensitive', 'handling', 'director', 'Paul', 'Cox', 'Most', 'poignant', 'juxtaposition', 'revived', 'romance', 'images', 'Andreas', 'Claire', 'earlier', 'passion', 'when', 'whole', 'adult', 'lives', 'lay', 'Though', 'Tingwell', 'bit', 'rickety', 'Andreas', 'performance', 'still', 'Blake', 'steals', 'Claire', 'woman', 'facing', 'unexpected', 'joy-', 'pain-', 'late', 'life']",Innocence

And what if you're no longer young or even middle-age but in your senior years? These questions forms the foundation for this lovely, whimsical move...and I absolutely loved watching it. Not only was it a nice change of pace to see lovers who remain passionate in spite of their obvious signs of age - receding hairlines, spreading waistlines, dimming vision - but to see them take such absolute delight in rediscovering each other again.In the years since they parted, both lovers have been married, had children and changed in many ways. So when they take up with each other, friends and family are alarmed and the couple themselves have to wonder if they can make it work - or even if they want to try after all these years. There is a lot at stake, a lot to risk. But underneath it all is a firm and abiding love, a love they may not find with anyone else. If you're as tired as I am of watching movies full of people barely out of adolescence, try this one on for size. Finally, a movie that really IS for Mature Audiences.",5,Finding your first love and falling in love again - at 70!,1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,1118,"['What', 'when', 'find', 'first', 'love', 'try', 'make', 'work', 'second', 'time', 'what', ""'re"", 'longer', 'young', 'even', 'middle-age', 'senior', 'years', 'questions', 'forms', 'foundation', 'lovely', 'whimsical', 'move', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'watching', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'see', 'lovers', 'who', 'remain', 'passionate', 'spite', 'obvious', 'signs', 'age', 'receding', 'hairlines', 'spreading', 'waistlines', 'dimming', 'vision', 'see', 'take', 'such', 'absolute', 'delight', 'rediscovering', 'other', 'years', 'parted', 'lovers', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'had', 'children', 'changed', 'many', 'ways', 'So', 'when', 'take', 'up', 'other', 'friends', 'family', 'are', 'alarmed', 'couple', 'have', 'wonder', 'can', 'make', 'work', 'even', 'want', 'try', 'years', 'lot', 'stake', 'lot', 'risk', 'firm', 'abiding', 'love', 'love', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'anyone', 'else', ""'re"", 'as', 'tired', 'am', 'watching', 'movies', 'full', 'people', 'barely', 'adolescence', 'try', 'one', 'size', 'Finally', 'movie', 'really', 'Mature', 'Audiences']",Innocence

I think that the criticisms leveled by others regarding this film are generally deserved, I agree with most of them; however, as I am an aged, spavined, tattered and torn ex-Romeo myself, I gave it an extra star for its attempt at clarity. I really do think that you have to be older to appreciate what this movie - short on good writing and amateurishly acted by the lead male though it is - is about. It tends, at times, to be didactic, especially in some of the rather stilted conversations about God, but it does open to the screen an area of experience that is very close to the bone for those of us supposedly past our primes. Movies are always less and more than meets the eye, and this is no exception. For me this film, however weak in some areas it is, was touching and real. I was always aware of what it was lacking, but at the same time I was taken with its boldness in evaluating human love and sexuality in people over the age normally reserved for this kind of scrutiny. It's painfully lacking in humor (a huge and glaring deficit), and I think the writer and director took what they had to say much too seriously, but this ultimately does not detract from the truths it exposes. For all its faults, I do recommend it to those of us who have arrived at that moment when getting out of a chair has become a painful and tricky business.",3,Its heart's in the right placed; now if I could just  find where the other stuff is...,1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1412,"['are', 'age', '50', 'might', 'pass', 'movie', 'think', 'criticisms', 'leveled', 'others', 'regarding', 'film', 'are', 'generally', 'deserved', 'agree', 'most', 'however', 'am', 'aged', 'spavined', 'tattered', 'torn', 'ex-Romeo', 'myself', 'gave', 'extra', 'star', 'attempt', 'clarity', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'have', 'be', 'older', 'appreciate', 'what', 'movie', 'short', 'good', 'writing', 'amateurishly', 'acted', 'lead', 'male', 'times', 'be', 'didactic', 'especially', 'rather', 'stilted', 'conversations', 'God', 'open', 'screen', 'area', 'experience', 'very', 'close', 'bone', 'supposedly', 'past', 'primes', 'Movies', 'are', 'always', 'less', 'more', 'eye', 'exception', 'film', 'however', 'weak', 'areas', 'was', 'touching', 'real', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'what', 'was', 'lacking', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'taken', 'boldness', 'evaluating', 'human', 'love', 'sexuality', 'people', 'age', 'normally', 'reserved', 'kind', 'scrutiny', 'painfully', 'lacking', 'humor', 'huge', 'glaring', 'deficit', 'think', 'writer', 'director', 'took', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'much', 'too', 'seriously', 'ultimately', 'not', 'detract', 'truths', 'faults', 'do', 'recommend', 'who', 'have', 'arrived', 'moment', 'when', 'getting', 'out', 'chair', 'become', 'painful', 'tricky', 'business']",Innocence

Young lovers who separate, marry others, then come together in old age and fall in love all over again, to the consternation of the husband of one of the pair. And it's beautiful, sad, funny, touching, heartbreaking, thoughtful - well, I can find no fault with it on any level. Beautiful acting, and you feel deeply for every single character.The film occurs in the present as this charming elderly couple (in their 70s, we must assume) reunite and try to recast their previous love to conform to the truth they have just discovered: that the bond forged in their youth has only grown stronger with the passage of half a century. But to put the present into perspective, there are voiceless flashbacks to 50+ years in the past when they were young lovers - who, for some unexplained reason, chose to part and marry others.See it.

723101,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B00006SFJT,Russell Fanelli,"[9, 9]","Two young people are shown kissing on the cover of the jewel case for this fine DVD. However, this story is decidely not about young love, but the genuine passion and mature love people nearing seventy can experience in their lives.Anreas, played beautifully by Charles Tingwell, unexpectedly calls Claire, just as well performed by Julia Blake, after years spent apart in separate lives with their own respective families.  Adreas as a young man was an organist with an inportant future and his father discouraged his love for Claire.  The two young people had been intimate and were deeply in love when they were kept apart.  Even with more than thirty years separating them from their last meeting, they both remembered each other with love and affection.  When Andreas made the unexpected call to Claire, she agreed to meet him.Not long after their first meeting they become lovers again in one of the most extraordinary stories we are likely to see at the movies.  These are mature, thoughtful people who understand what they are doing and confront the expected opposition they know they will receive.  They attempt to be open and honest with everyone about their relationship and most importantly, open and honest with themselves.The story of Claire and Andreas is heartbreaking, particularly for Claire who spent much of her life in a conventional marriage which was comfortable, but not emotionally satisfying.  Andreas lost his own wife thirty years ago and now realizes how impoverished his life has been without his love for Claire. They both agree to live fully in the moment for as much time as they have left.This brief summary covers the first third or so of the movie and prepares the viewer for the joys and sorrows this couple will face as they begin their new life together.This film is quiet and thoughtful as it shows us the lives of two people we would like to know as they encounter one another after a long separation.  Claire and Andreas help us to think more deeply about our own lives and our relationship with the people who matter most to us. Few mature adults will fail to be moved by this heartfelt film.",5,Mature love beautifully realized in Innocence,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,2135,"['Two', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'shown', 'kissing', 'cover', 'jewel', 'case', 'fine', 'DVD', 'However', 'story', 'decidely', 'not', 'young', 'love', 'genuine', 'passion', 'mature', 'love', 'people', 'nearing', 'seventy', 'can', 'experience', 'lives.Anreas', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Charles', 'Tingwell', 'unexpectedly', 'Claire', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'performed', 'Julia', 'Blake', 'years', 'spent', 'apart', 'separate', 'lives', 'own', 'respective', 'families', 'Adreas', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'organist', 'inportant', 'future', 'father', 'discouraged', 'love', 'Claire', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'intimate', 'were', 'deeply', 'love', 'when', 'were', 'kept', 'apart', 'Even', 'more', 'thirty', 'years', 'separating', 'last', 'meeting', 'remembered', 'other', 'love', 'affection', 'When', 'Andreas', 'made', 'unexpected', 'call', 'Claire', 'agreed', 'meet', 'him.Not', 'long', 'first', 'meeting', 'become', 'lovers', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'stories', 'are', 'likely', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'mature', 'thoughtful', 'people', 'who', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'confront', 'expected', 'opposition', 'know', 'will', 'receive', 'attempt', 'be', 'open', 'honest', 'everyone', 'relationship', 'most', 'importantly', 'open', 'honest', 'themselves.The', 'story', 'Claire', 'Andreas', 'heartbreaking', 'particularly', 'Claire', 'who', 'spent', 'much', 'life', 'conventional', 'marriage', 'was', 'comfortable', 'not', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'lost', 'own', 'wife', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'how', 'impoverished', 'life', 'been', 'love', 'Claire', 'agree', 'live', 'fully', 'moment', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'have', 'left.This', 'brief', 'summary', 'covers', 'first', 'third', 'so', 'movie', 'viewer', 'joys', 'couple', 'will', 'face', 'begin', 'new', 'life', 'together.This', 'film', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'lives', 'two', 'people', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'encounter', 'one', 'long', 'separation', 'Claire', 'Andreas', 'help', 'think', 'more', 'deeply', 'own', 'lives', 'relationship', 'people', 'who', 'matter', 'most', 'Few', 'mature', 'adults', 'will', 'fail', 'be', 'moved', 'heartfelt', 'film']",Innocence
