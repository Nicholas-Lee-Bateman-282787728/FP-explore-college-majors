471136,A3CSRP3P4U9HI,6305613524,Alan R. Holyoak,"[54, 55]","Christopher Walken and Glenn Close headline the cast in this excellent series of three Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.In the first movie of the series, &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall,&quot; Walken plays a widowed Kansas farmer who desperately needs someone to help him rear his children while he tends to providing for the family via his farm in the early 1900s.  Glenn Close plays Sarah, a woman from Maine, who responds to Walken's newspaper ad search for a wife.  The rest of the story focuses on the developing relationships between Walken, Close, and the children.  An excellent story and great movie -- 5 stars all the way.In the second movie, &quot;Skylark&quot; (sequel to Sarah, Plain and Tall), the story of Walken and Close's life continues as they face a severe drought, possible failure of the farm, and stresses those things place upon the family.  Top-notch, equal in emotional impact and believability with &quot;Sarah, Plain and Tall&quot; -- definitely another 5-star movie.The third movie, &quot;Winter's End&quot; finds an unexpected guest in Walken and Close's home -- Walken's father, long absent from any family interactions.  In this movie, the children have grown considerably (I believe that all the members of the original cast are still together).  While an enjoyable movie, this one is not in the same class as the first two, and hovers someplace around 3.5 to 4 stars.I awarded the set 5 stars on the collective strength of the first  two movies.Just in case you hadn't noticed, Walken is often cast in somewhat quirky roles, but this is probably my favorite work of his.  He plays a devoted father dealing with a range of believable real-life issues.  These movies also underscore the incredible talent of Close, who can pull off roles as diverse as Sarah's and that of Disney's Cruella DeVil!Do yourself a favor...if you haven't watched these movies, watch them.  They are wonderful.Have a great day!Alan Holyoak",5,"A 5-star trilogy, well worth a look",977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,1939,"['Christopher', 'Walken', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'headline', 'cast', 'excellent', 'series', 'three', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'movies.In', 'first', 'movie', 'series', 'quot', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'quot', 'Walken', 'widowed', 'Kansas', 'farmer', 'who', 'desperately', 'someone', 'help', 'rear', 'children', 'providing', 'family', 'farm', 'early', '1900s', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'Sarah', 'woman', 'Maine', 'who', 'Walken', 'newspaper', 'ad', 'search', 'wife', 'rest', 'story', 'developing', 'relationships', 'Walken', 'Close', 'children', 'excellent', 'story', 'great', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'way.In', 'second', 'movie', 'quot', 'Skylark', 'quot', 'sequel', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'story', 'Walken', 'Close', 'life', 'face', 'severe', 'drought', 'possible', 'failure', 'farm', 'stresses', 'things', 'place', 'family', 'Top-notch', 'equal', 'emotional', 'impact', 'believability', 'quot', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'quot', 'definitely', '5-star', 'movie.The', 'third', 'movie', 'quot', 'Winter', 'End', 'quot', 'unexpected', 'guest', 'Walken', 'Close', 'home', 'Walken', 'father', 'long', 'absent', 'family', 'interactions', 'movie', 'children', 'have', 'grown', 'considerably', 'believe', 'members', 'original', 'cast', 'are', 'still', 'together', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'one', 'not', 'same', 'class', 'first', 'two', 'hovers', 'someplace', 'around', '3.5', '4', 'stars.I', 'awarded', 'set', '5', 'stars', 'collective', 'strength', 'first', 'two', 'movies.Just', 'case', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'Walken', 'often', 'cast', 'somewhat', 'quirky', 'roles', 'probably', 'favorite', 'work', 'devoted', 'father', 'dealing', 'range', 'believable', 'real-life', 'issues', 'movies', 'also', 'underscore', 'incredible', 'talent', 'Close', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'roles', 'as', 'diverse', 'Sarah', 'Disney', 'Cruella', 'DeVil', 'Do', 'favor', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'movies', 'watch', 'are', 'wonderful.Have', 'great', 'day', 'Alan', 'Holyoak']","Sarah Plain & Tall Trilogy:  Sarah, Plain and Tall / Skylark / Winter's End VHS"

471139,A12YVS06GZEFZE,6305613524,Barbara Farr Kelley,"[3, 4]","This trilogy is great viewing on television.  Sarah, Plain and Tall was the first, about a woman who comes from Maine to marry a man in Indiana (a mail-order type of thing).  When she arrives in Indiana she does not know  what to expect, but is pleasantly surprised that the man is quite  attractive.  She instantly gets along with the little boy, and the little  girl takes a little time to get used to her, but the entire family grows to  love Sarah, no matter how plain and tall she is.In Skylark, it was more  of the same, a continuance of Sarah, Plain and Tall and the trials and  tribulations of living in a land where so many bad things can happen:  drought, fire, and so on.  Sarah takes the children back to Maine with her  after the Indiana barn burns to the ground and the drought is so bad  because the creek is almost out of water.  The little boy, Caleb, puts a  glass outside before he leaves Indiana so that when it rains, he will have  a glass of water to remember it by.  In Maine, the children meet Sarah's  aunts, who are all characters in themselves.  One of them likes to skinny  dip in the moonlight, and Caleb says she looks like a great white fish.  It  is in this movie that Sarah finds out she is to have a baby.  And at the  end of the movie when Jacob comes to take Sarah and the children home,  because there has been rain in Indiana, Sarah tells Jacob that she wants  their child to be born in Indiana.  It is very touching, and made tears  come to my eyes.In the third, Winter's End, Sarah's little girl is  around 5 or 6 years old, and it rounds out the trilogy quite nicely.  I'm  just wondering what I've seen that little girl in before.I would  recommend this entire set of movies to anyone who likes watching historical  information, especially that which is based on true stories.",5,Glenn Close and Christopher Walken made in heaven!,961286400,"06 18, 2000",2000,1818,"['trilogy', 'great', 'viewing', 'television', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'was', 'first', 'woman', 'who', 'Maine', 'marry', 'man', 'Indiana', 'mail-order', 'type', 'thing', 'When', 'Indiana', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'man', 'quite', 'attractive', 'instantly', 'little', 'boy', 'little', 'girl', 'little', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'entire', 'family', 'love', 'Sarah', 'matter', 'how', 'plain', 'tall', 'is.In', 'Skylark', 'was', 'more', 'same', 'continuance', 'Sarah', 'Plain', 'Tall', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'living', 'land', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'things', 'can', 'happen', 'drought', 'fire', 'so', 'Sarah', 'children', 'back', 'Maine', 'Indiana', 'barn', 'burns', 'ground', 'drought', 'so', 'bad', 'creek', 'almost', 'water', 'little', 'boy', 'Caleb', 'glass', 'Indiana', 'so', 'when', 'will', 'have', 'glass', 'water', 'remember', 'Maine', 'children', 'meet', 'Sarah', 'aunts', 'who', 'are', 'characters', 'One', 'skinny', 'dip', 'moonlight', 'Caleb', 'great', 'white', 'fish', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'out', 'have', 'baby', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Jacob', 'take', 'Sarah', 'children', 'home', 'been', 'rain', 'Indiana', 'Sarah', 'Jacob', 'child', 'be', 'born', 'Indiana', 'very', 'touching', 'made', 'tears', 'come', 'eyes.In', 'third', 'Winter', 'End', 'Sarah', 'little', 'girl', 'around', '5', '6', 'years', 'old', 'out', 'trilogy', 'quite', 'nicely', ""'m"", 'just', 'wondering', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'little', 'girl', 'before.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'entire', 'set', 'movies', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'historical', 'information', 'especially', 'based', 'true', 'stories']","Sarah Plain & Tall Trilogy:  Sarah, Plain and Tall / Skylark / Winter's End VHS"

I have not seen the other two.I have not read Patricia MacLachlan's Sarah, Plain and Tall but this movie really makes me want to.Glenn Close gives a beautiful, sensitive portrayal of Sarah Wheaton, a strong, devoted woman who accepts a position as a housekeeper to Jacob Witting, a Kansas farmer. She brings a quiet, subtle strength to the role which makes her very endearing and was well-nominated (although she didn't win them) for a Best Leading Actress in a TV Mini-Series Golden Globe and Emmy.Her character reminds me a little of Maria in The Sound of Music. Even though their personalities are different (Maria is bubbly, flighty and outspoken and Sarah is more quiet and stoic) both women accomplish basically the same goal--the woman who helps the widower and his children appreciate the joys of family life again. Yes, the romance between her and Caleb is predictable but it develops so slowly and gradually that it feel real. They are both stubborn, strong-willed people but you can tell that deep down they admire and respect each other despite not always seeing eye to eye.The screenplay does an excellent job fleshing out the personalities of the two adults and children and contains plenty of dialogue crackling with wit and spark.I recommend this movie.

The Sarah, Plain and Tall trilogy is a beautiful collection of three films (Sarah, Plain and Tall; Skylark and Winter's End) about a woman, who answers a personal ad from a widower with two children in Kansas. She travels with her cat, Seal, from the lush greeness and crystal waters of Maine, to a wind blown, prairie farm in Kansas, after corresponding with him. The agreement is she will visit for a month and in that time all will see if there is basis to create a family unit that will work.  This film is epic in its story line- In Sarah, Plain and Tall we experience how the death of Jacob's first wife still haunts him; the young children, trying to retain their mother's memory and still have room and love for Sarah and Sarah trying to adjust to the harshness of Kansas in respect to the openess of Maine and the sea. The film moves on to two other chapters in their lives: Skylark and Winter's End. In each segment time has past and the children are grown by the third segment. Each film presents a realistic view of life and how old memories and aspects of the past shape the personalities of the characters and their abilities to cope with their daily joys and sorrows.

Jacob and Sarah's love withstood the test of time!Sarah a mail-order bride who lived by the sea, where there is always plenty of water, and green grass. Sarah answered Jacob's advertisement for a wife, to help him with his two children, and his farm.( I loved the hand written letters in these movies!) Jacob and his family lived in a dry place, with brown grass, and not much water, so it was a big change for Sarah, and also for Jacob, because Sarah was strong willed, and had a mind of her own, and Jacob was used to having things his own way!I highly recommend this movie collection! I saw it years ago and I loved it! My favorite ones of the collection was Sarah Plain and Tall, and Skylark! I loved the adorable barefooted treasures!

I loved them so much that I brought another set as a gift.I will not go into what the story line is about as many other reviews have done that already but what I will say is this.These movies are the best non Christian movies in my opinon ever made. Sarah Plain and Tall movies focus on the importance of family, forgiveness,healing,love....I could not praise these productions enough and if I could give more then 5 stars I would.If you are looking for clean wonderfully made productions to add to your collection that the whole family can enjoy both young and old.
