1020172,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000IFRT2O,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[2, 4]","'Monster House' is literally that.  Not just your typical dilapidated haunted house, 12-year old D.J.'s neighbor's home across the street is alive and kicking.  This is only discovered when its occupant, Nebbencracker (Steve Buscemi), nearly dies during a nasty confrontation with D.J.  He's just as mean as usual, but this time he pays for it.  D.J. and his best friend, Chowder, keep vigil from D.J.'s bedroom window with a telescope.  And no one believes them.  Not their babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhal), not the police, not even the local video game meister.  No one.  That is until the house comes to life and starts eating people, wrapping them with its carpet tongue and swallowing them whole.  The boys join forces with their babysitter's nemesis, Jenny, to muster up their courage and figure out a way to free the captives, including all the neighbors' toys.  We find out that even Nebbencracker is in some ways haunted--by a secret in his past.The whole adventure is unique.  It uses the computer animation to good use with scary special effects and the scenic autumn views.  While ""Pixar"" type animation has changed things considerably, the voices give some heart to the sometimes rubbery animated faces.  Some of the scenes are intense enough to keep most children interested, but some discretion should be used for the very youngest.

Colors are vibrant, depth is strong, and the animation is very life like.  Many of the visual effects, particularly towards the end, go straight to that part of the brain which first wanted to upgrade your TV to high definition.  But I do feel Monster House stops short of receiving a perfect score, not because of the transfer, but because of the artificial grain filter which the film makers applied.  It wasn't obtrusive but it did detract, ever so slightly, from the clarity of the image.

And anyone who thought MONSTER HOUSE had even a remote shot at winning this award must've been smoking crack. Up against HAPPY FEET and the awesomely entertaining CARS, Monster House was the lemon in the animation ranks. Even though the animation was good (actually these things are more a cartoonish CGI than animation), the story missed by a mile.More interesting than the story itself was the manner in which it was made. On the extra features of the DVD it shows how small, electronic balls were attached to actors as they read their lines and acted out the parts, allowing the CGI animators the ability to track every facial twitch and finger movement, thus making the animated characters move in a more life-like fashion.I don't usually mention the MPAA ratings of films, but here I'm going to make an exception because this supposedly kid-friendly film is rated PG, not G. My guess is that the violence and the one off-comment about female anatomy (""Oh. So it's a girl house."") forced this rating on the film (just something for those stickler parents to be aware of, although I'd be willing to bet your little kiddies get more information from the Victoria Secrets catalogue in your monthly mail and more bloody viewing on the nightly news).The story is about a dank house on a quiet street. This house is inhabited by a crazy old coot named Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) who guards his property with rabid ferocity. Any toys that end up on his lawn are immediately confiscated and never seen again. Across the street from Mr. Nebbercracker lives D.J. (Mitchel Musso). He's infatuated with the dark and dreary house, and spies on it via a telescope from his upstairs bedroom window. And when D.J.'s parents head out for the weekend and put a babysitter in charge of D.J., things start to get interesting. The babysitter's boyfriend vanishes, and D.J. instigates an argument with old man Nebbercracker, only to have the crotchety man fall over with an apparent heart attack. An ambulance takes Nebbercracker away and the house now sits vacant on the verge of Halloween eve.D.J.'s best friend, Chowder, comes over, too, and when D.J. tells Chowder about the strange goings on at the vacant house, Chowder doesn't believe him and decides to play doorbell ditch. But when he rings the bell, the house comes alive! The spirit of ...something lives in its walls.As the boys try and figure out what's going on, they also encounter an entrepreneurial young cookie sales-girl named Jenny whom both boys become somewhat enraptured with; Chowder and D.J. are, after all (so we're told), approaching puberty.Initially the boys and Jenny think that old man Nebbercracker is dead, but his unexpected return changes everything they once thought they knew about the old, scarey house.Although loaded with plenty of action, scarey scenes, and funny buddy dialogue, the story is simply not up to par. The fact that D.J. is approaching puberty has nothing to do with the story's end result and is given way too much emphasis throughout. The babysitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also has little to do with the story and appears more as filler than anything else.Even so, the animation is interesting and the action will keep most viewers watching.

This is something different when it comes to kids movies. There are no goofy hyper-active squirrels, singing lobsters, or joke busting Mr. Potatoes. In fact, there is very little comedy at all. MONSTER HOUSE is more along the lines of GOOSEBUMPS or, well, there actually aren't a whole lot of movies like it.MONSTER HOUSE is an excellent movie and it is unique. Like I said, it isn't your typical animated movie. There is a fine line when it comes to your children watching it. My six year-old daughter watched the movie and loved it, but at times, she did get a little scared. Although it was a fun scared. There is nothing in the movie that will tramatize your kid or anything.Any kid older than six gets traumatized, and you may want to check their wussiness factor.There is actually a great story to MONSTER HOUSE. If you can overlook the near complete absence of comedy and enjoy the family oriented ghost story, you may love it.

1020192,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000IFRT2O,Chris Pandolfi,"[6, 7]","""Monster House"" may be one of the most effective haunted house movies I've ever seen. The fact that it's a family oriented CGI film doesn't affect its credibility as an entertaining story. If anything, it made the idea even better because it didn't have to rely to adult oriented methods like sex, language, and gore to get the point across. Instead, it relies on a solid story, good characterizations, and an attention to detail. That's a rare combination in movies these days, most of which are nothing more than remakes. It was so nice to see an original story again, especially since it involved a house that could literally morph into a living, breathing eating machine. This is but one of many examples of the film's morbid yet intelligent sense of humor, a quality perfectly suited for a story with adolescent characters.It's also an incredibly fun movie, filled with moments of comedy, suspense, and action. Of course, the breathtaking animation helps a great deal, every shot being a stylistic reinterpretation of the real world. This film relies on the motion capture technique of animation, using real actors to perform the movements of the digital characters. It was the same technique used for ""The Polar Express,"" and in both cases, it gave the characters a distinct feel that I couldn't quite put my finger on; it was as if they were that much closer to being alive, despite their stylized physical appearances. For ""Monster House,"" the characters reminded me of old-fashioned hand drawings that have finally been released from the mechanical prison of traditional cel animation. They looked cartoonish but felt much more organic. I can only say that watching them was a fascinating experience.But just as fascinating was the new twist on the classic Don't Enter a Strange Place Alone fable that all children have instilled in their heads by the time they turn three. The owner of the haunted house is Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi); a seemingly mean spirited old man who goes into fits of rage whenever anyone steps on his lawn. We see this right at the beginning when a young girl accidentally gets stuck in the lawn while riding her tricycle. Nebbercracker runs out of the house and screams at the poor child, after which he breaks her tricycle and scares her off with even more screaming. The fable-like quality of that scene very obviously comes through; in real life, there always seems to be one house in the neighborhood that parents warn their children to stay away from.I find it really interesting that parents would say such things to their children, considering a child's belief in a fantastic or strange event is almost never taken seriously. The children of ""Monster House"" are almost like the Baudelaire siblings of the ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" books: they live in a world where adults are unable and/or unwilling to believe a word they say. DJ (Mitchel Musso), his best friend, Chowder (Sam Lerner), and Jenny (Spencer Locke) can't convince anyone of anything: not their parents, not the babysitter, and certainly not the police. And when Nebbercracker collapses in a seemingly dead heap and is soon thereafter wheeled away in an ambulance, it truly does become a game of Them Vs. The Rest of the World. That's because his absence prompts the house to come to life, distorting itself into a grotesque, splintery face whenever someone steps onto the property (the windows are the eyes, the front door is the mouth, and the porch railing make up the teeth). It uses images of wanted objects like toys as a lure, giving it ample opportunity to hungrily gobble innocent people up.The story takes place in October, specifically the day before and the night of Halloween. From a strictly entertainment-based point of view, that's the perfect time of year for a house to come to life and for a group of children to fight against it. But it also serves the plot reasonably well: keep in mind that Halloween is the one night when large groups of children wander the streets, knock on doors, and beg for candy. They'll be tempted to knock on Nebbercracker's door, despite not knowing that he's gone and that the house is alive. And because DJ, Chowder, and Jenny firmly believe that the spirit of a bitter old man is literally possessing the walls of his former house, they know they have to act quickly; a house with a ravenous appetite for people will almost certainly get its fill on Halloween, especially if it wants revenge against the children who pestered it for so many years.But when the heroic trio manages to enter the house (meant to be pulled off through an elaborate conglomeration of a vacuum cleaner and bottles of cold medicine), they discover many things about Nebbercracker no one had ever known before. They have to go about it carefully, though; the house, it seems, has the ability to fall asleep, and if it wakes up, the floor will act as a throat, the carpet will act as a tongue, and the feeding frenzy will begin. Searching as discreetly as they can, they see pictures of a woman named Constance (seen in flashback and voiced by Kathleen Turner). They also discover a basement filled with toys, presumably the ones Nebbercracker had been snatching away all these years. Most importantly, they find a cage with a heart-shaped lock. All of these discoveries connect and they eventually lead to a pretty stunning revelation, one that directly relates to a sad event in the old man's past.It's this sad event in particular that shows a much darker side to this story, a side some parents may not want their younger children to see. A couple of things about this movie are a little heavy-handed for anyone under the age of eight, including a mean boyfriend character (Jason Lee) that drinks a beer while angrily taunting Nebbercracker. But don't get the wrong impression; this is very much a family film, and it's filled with child-friendly characters. These include the babysitter, Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the nerdy videogame fanatic, Skull (Jon Heder), and the completely inept cops Lister (Nick Cannon) and Landers (Kevin James). They add appropriately humorous touches without taking anything away from the more serious undertones of the story. On top of everything, the film successfully mixes in important ideas about beliefs, friendship, and understanding. That was no small feat, considering the audience has to keep their attention fixed on the old, rickety, possessed house the entire time.I wouldn't go so far as to say that the story teaches the characters a valuable lesson. This is despite the fact that most of them are continuously learning throughout the film (whether or not they're aware of it). I will say that the sequences of events push the main characters into rethinking what they thought of as the truth. It's surprising that this method worked so well in a haunted house movie; in other films of that kind, I've found that it can detract from the main focus of the story. Sometimes it doesn't work at all, like in the case of the ""Thirteen Ghosts"" remake. It was so overburdened with special effects and spooky imagery that its story was completely lost in the process. Fortunately, ""Monster House"" is a pure haunted house movie, made with care, precision, and style. It was an imaginative, well-crafted film, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.",5,"If the House is Stalkin', Don't Come A-Knockin'",1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,7336,"['Monster', 'House',

Cars, while it did have its moments, was probably the least developed film they've done in terms of story and character. Like the guys in South Park say, Pixar is arguably the best at telling the stories that center only on specific characters but Cars felt like they ran out of things to do. So we come to Monster House which is one of those surprises since it's so good and it's one that adults will get into as well as teenagers but keep in mind, this isn't kid friendly.A house in a neighborhood belongs to a crickety old man named Mr. Nebbercracker who has a dislike for kids on his lawn, especially if the certain things happen to land on the lawn. One day, young DJ goes after his friend, Cheddar's, ball only to have it taken away and yelled at by the old man. Mr. Nebbercracker though suffers a heart attack and is taken away by the ambulance. As if that wasn't bad, the house seems to be alive and the 2 kids, along with treat salesgirl Jenny try to outwit the house and stop it from eating people from the neighborhood.One can blame the recent animated features solely on Shrek. Whereas the Pixar films emphasized story with funny moments, Shrek seems to have started the trend of rapid fire pop-culture references and non-stop gags in order to hide a weak story. In comes Monster House that finally treats its audience with intelligence. One can only laugh at a lame pun so often so it's great a film comes along that actually wants to tell the story. But scenes will probably be a little too scary for the little ones so kids ages 5-10 at least probably won't be able to handle it. This is basically a movie for the growing boy or girl and not a movie to babysit your kids with.The animation, while not of immense ""wow factor"", is pretty great and there's even some cinematic camera shots that were quite impressive instead of just simple moves. The house though really comes alive in its sound design as well as every creak, bend and movement gives it a foreboding quality. One thing that I kind of didn't like was the use of ""name"" actors such as Steve Buscemi, Catharine O'Hara, Fred Willard, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, Kevin James and Napoleon Dy...I mean Jon Heder show up. Whatever happened to just casting people who were right for the role? Luckily though no one seemed out of place.I would highly recommend you watch this first before letting your kids see it. I'll make things simple: if your child is between 5-9, then don't show it...unless you think they're macho and can handle it. Adults can handle it of course but kids might be crying at it.

For most kids, they know their own homes and the homes of the other kids they play with.  The adults in these families are also known.  But of course to younger children even thirty year old adults are ancient folks.  Their grandparents are so old that they must have seen the beginning of the world.  You know, fifty to seventy years ago.But the home down the block or across the street of that incomprehensibly old person who lived alone and who demanded that you stay off their lawn was also quite frightening.  This fear has been exploited in children's fiction to various effects for a long time.  Just one very famous example is in the first ""Home Alone"".  But the important point is that the fictional point is rooted in the reality of the lives of most kids.  This contrasts with the well-known rules of vampires and werewolves that every kid knows, but unlike the fearsome old person down the street, vampires and werewolves do not exist.This movie uses that fear of the strange and angry old person who hates kids on his lawn combined with a good Halloween monster film.  D.J. (Mitchel Musso) lives across the street from an absolutely frightening old man named Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) who lives in an even scarier than he is.  D. J. is so disturbed by the old man's behavior that he studies him through his telescope and takes pictures when he confiscates children's toys that end up on his lawn.Chowder is D.J.'s best friend and though he is more frightened of Nebbercracker, he is also less concerned and wants D.J. to come outside and play more.  D.J.'s parents are leaving town and have a babysitter, Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) coming over to watch him for a few days.  Of course, she has to have her idiot boyfriend, Bones (Jason Lee) come over to pass the time.  After Bones leaves because he can't gets irritated with Zee and ends up seeing something in the house that attracts him into investigating further.The next day is Halloween and Jenny (Spencer Locke) comes to the neighborhood to score some extra money selling last minute candy.  She attends a well regarded private school and is full of energy and smarts.  After she experiences something at the monster house she teams up with D. J. and Chowder and the rest of the movie ensues.Very fun, interesting twists, and has a good balance of being funny and scary for the kids.  Adults can tap into their childhood and their memories of whatever scary house was a part of that long ago time.The animation is quite good.  However, it does have some strange aspects like the little girl riding her tricycle.  We notice that she is missing her front teeth.  Now, a little girl who is old enough to ride her tricycle that fast alone in the neighborhood would have had all her teeth come in.  But if she is old enough to start losing them (six or seven), she is too old to be riding a tricycle.  This is where animators sometimes go after cute and simply end up with jarring.  However, this is a tiny little point in such a good story.And a lot of good fun.",5,Remember that scary old person and their mysterious house?,1162425600,"11 2, 2006",2006,3094,"['When', 'was', 'kid', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'world', 'most', 'kids', 'know', 'own', 'homes', 'homes', 'other', 'kids', 'play', 'adults', 'families', 'are', 'also', 'known', 'course', 'younger', 'children', 'even', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'adults', 'are', 'ancient', 'folks', 'grandparents', 'are', 'so', 'old', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'beginning', 'world', 'know', 'fifty', 'seventy', 'years', 'home', 'down', 'block', 'street', 'incomprehensibly', 'old', 'person', 'who', 'lived', 'alone', 'who', 'demanded', 'stay', 'lawn', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'frightening', 'fear', 'been', 'exploited', 'children', 'fiction', 'various', 'effects', 'long', 'time', 'Just', 'one', 'very', 'famous', 'example', 'first', 'Home', 'Alone', 'important', 'point', 'fictional', 'point', 'rooted', 'reality', 'lives', 'most', 'kids', 'well-known', 'rules', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'kid', 'fearsome', 'old', 'person', 'street', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'do', 'not', 'exist.This', 'movie', 'fear', 'strange', 'angry', 'old', 'person', 'who', 'kids', 'lawn', 'combined', 'good', 'Halloween', 'monster', 'film', 'D.J', 'Mitchel', 'Musso', 'street', 'absolutely', 'frightening', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Nebbercracker', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'who', 'even', 'scarier', 'D.', 'J.', 'so', 'disturbed', 'old', 'man', 'behavior', 'studies', 'telescope', 'pictures', 'when', 'children', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'lawn.Chowder', 'D.J', 'best', 'friend', 'more', 'frightened', 'Nebbercracker', 'also', 'less', 'concerned', 'D.J', 'come', 'outside', 'play', 'more', 'D.J', 'parents', 'are', 'leaving', 'town', 'have', 'babysitter', 'Zee', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'coming', 'watch', 'few', 'days', 'course', 'have', 'idiot', 'boyfriend', 'Bones', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'come', 'pass', 'time', 'Bones', 'leaves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'irritated', 'Zee', 'up', 'seeing', 'something', 'house', 'investigating', 'further.The', 'next', 'day', 'Halloween', 'Jenny', 'Spencer', 'Locke', 'neighborhood', 'score', 'extra', 'money', 'selling', 'last', 'minute', 'candy', 'well', 'regarded', 'private', 'school', 'full', 'energy', 'smarts', 'something', 'monster', 'house', 'up', 'D.', 'J.', 'Chowder', 'rest', 'movie', 'ensues.Very', 'fun', 'interesting', 'twists', 'good', 'balance', 'being', 'funny', 'scary', 'kids', 'Adults', 'can', 'tap', 'childhood', 'memories', 'scary', 'house', 'was', 'part', 'long', 'ago', 'time.The', 'animation', 'quite', 'good', 'However', 'have', 'strange', 'aspects', 'little', 'girl', 'riding', 'tricycle', 'notice', 'missing', 'front', 'teeth', 'Now', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'ride', 'tricycle', 'fast', 'alone', 'neighborhood', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'teeth', 'come', 'old', 'enough', 'start', 'losing', 'six', 'seven', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'riding', 'tricycle', 'where', 'animators', 'sometimes', 'go', 'cute', 'simply', 'end', 'up', 'jarring', 'However', 'tiny', 'little', 'point', 'such', 'good', 'story.And', 'lot', 'good', 'fun']",N/A

There's not a lot in this film I didn't like.  I got my money's worth with this movie.I did not see the 3-D version yet, but I do plan on going to see it in that format.Mitchel Musso does a great job as D.J., the star of the movie.  D.J. didn't want to become a hero, but he sure does come through in the end.  I liked watching his character evolve from a coming-of-age-reluctantly kid to a seriously confident teenager.Sam Lerner plays Chowder, and he lays down this role so well that I see Oscar written all over the Hollywood Marquee!  Lerner and his animated body make this movie so gosh dang user-friendly that I just can't put the fun into words.  That mean you just have to see the movie.  Chowder and D.J. need their own sitcom on NBC - Friday nights preferably.Spencer Locke lends her voice to the adorable Jenny, not to be confused with the Jenny from Forrest Gump.  Jenny is along for the ride she didn't ask to be a part of, but she is vital to the battle against the evil Monster House and the horror that waits inside.  Her toughness and sense of security being challenged by a situation out of control add to the movies delicious aroma.Watching Jenny try and deal with a scary situation and two boys with a crush on her at the same time is worth the price of admission.  The commentary between these three is great.Steve Buscemi nails the role of Nebbercracker perfectly because...well...because he's Steve Buscemi and he nails every role!  Seriously folks, this Nebbercracker guy is one scary kite-stealing dude.  At times, I just had to look away from this homeowner.  He was just too ghastly!Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the self-named Zee.  She's the babysitter, and she used to watch me when I was a kid.  I'm sure of it!  Zee is so lifelike I almost asked what time I had to go to bed during the movie.Jason Lee plays Bones, Zee's boyfriend.  Talk about creepy.  This guy makes Pauly Shore seem normal and handsome.  Not sure exactly what Zee sees in Bones, but whatever.Okay, I see this review is getting kind of long.  I want people to read it, not skip it, so I better cut it off here.See this movie!

1020203,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000IFRT2O,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","No matter where you grew up, there was almost surely a nearby house that gave you the spooks.  Maybe it was an abandoned, rotting hulk of a haunted house, or maybe it was the inhospitable dwelling of a scary old man you suspected of doing very bad things behind his dark walls.  Both scenarios apply to the Monster House.  Dare to even step foot on the lawn, and mean old Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) comes out of the front door like a banshee, yelling for you to go away if you don't want to be eaten.  It's easy to see why DJ (Mitchel Musso) and his friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) are so scared of the place.  From his window across the road, DJ has seen things no adult would ever believe.  When Chowder's brand new basketball rolls into the yard, though, DJ bravely sets out to claim it before the house does.  That leads to a confrontation with Nebbercracker, who keels over while shaking DJ around like a rag doll.  That is when things really get bad.  Nebbercracker may be gone, but the house is alive - and it's Halloween.Clearly, there's no way DJ and Chowder are going near the spooky old house again.  Then they spy a cute girl strolling toward its door, oblivious to the danger she is in.  Eager to impress Jenny (Spencer Locke), they decide that they have to do something before the house feasts on all of that night's trick-or-treaters.  Adults, such as DJ's babysitter and the local police, are no help at all.  The kids are going to have to do this on their own.  After seeking the sage advice of the local video game wizard, they devise a plan to stop the house by destroying its heart (and they have a good idea of just what and where that is).  Naturally, the plan goes awry, trapping the kids within the very mouth of the monster.  There, they learn the secret of the killer domicile (which they never saw coming), but will they live to tell anyone about it?  More importantly, will they be able to save Halloween for all the local children by ridding the neighborhood of this deadly menace?When you talk about this movie, you have to start with the animation.  It is truly something to behold; you might even be creeped out by how incredibly real everything and everyone looks - especially in terms of the facial expressions that communicate the characters' emotions (especially those of fright) incredibly well.  The house itself is a model of anthropomorphic CGI, particularly when it really comes to life and goes on the attack.  This is a PG movie, but young children might get the heebie-jeebies from some of the house's more frightful manifestations.  For the most part, though, Monster House is rollicking good fun, especially when subtlety is thrown out the window and the story becomes far too outrageous for even a wee little tyke to take seriously.Here's the bottom line: children should get a real kick out of this film.  Any possible frights should quickly be forgotten thanks to all of the humor built into the story.  I think most adults will enjoy the film, as well.  Monster House is certainly no Shrek, but it should prove pretty entertaining to one and all.",5,"A heck of a lot of fun to watch, and the animation is incredible",1168819200,"01 15, 2007",2007,3099,"['matter', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'was', 'almost', 'surely', 'nearby', 'house', 'gave', 'spooks', 'Maybe', 'was', 'abandoned', 'rotting', 'hulk', 'haunted', 'house', 'maybe', 'was', 'inhospitable', 'dwelling', 'scary', 'old', 'man', 'suspected', 'doing', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'dark', 'walls', 'scenarios', 'apply', 'Monster', 'House', 'Dare', 'even', 'step', 'foot', 'lawn', 'mean', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercracker', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'front', 'door', 'banshee', 'yelling', 'go', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'eaten', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'DJ', 'Mitchel', 'Musso', 'friend', 'Chowder', 'Sam', 'Lerner', 'are', 'so', 'scared', 'place', 'window', 'road', 'DJ', 'seen', 'things', 'adult', 'would', 'ever', 'believe', 'When', 'Chowder', 'brand', 'new', 'basketball', 'rolls', 'yard', 'though', 'DJ', 'bravely', 'out', 'claim', 'house', 'confrontation', 'Nebbercracker', 'who', 'shaking', 'DJ', 'rag', 'doll', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'bad', 'Nebbercracker', 'may', 'be', 'gone', 'house', 'alive', 'Halloween.Clearly', 'way', 'DJ', 'Chowder', 'are', 'going', 'spooky', 'old', 'house', 'again', 'Then', 'spy', 'cute', 'girl', 'strolling', 'door', 'oblivious', 'danger', 'Eager', 'impress', 'Jenny', 'Spencer', 'Locke', 'decide', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'house', 'night', 'trick-or-treaters', 'Adults', 'such', 'DJ', 'babysitter', 'local', 'police', 'are', 'help', 'kids', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'do', 'own', 'seeking', 'sage', 'advice', 'local', 'video', 'game', 'wizard', 'devise', 'plan', 'stop', 'house', 'destroying', 'heart', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'just', 'what', 'where', 'Naturally', 'plan', 'awry', 'trapping', 'kids', 'very', 'mouth', 'monster', 'learn', 'secret', 'killer', 'domicile', 'never', 'saw', 'coming', 'will', 'live', 'tell', 'anyone', 'More', 'importantly', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Halloween', 'local', 'children', 'ridding', 'neighborhood', 'deadly', 'menace', 'When', 'talk', 'movie', 'have', 'start', 'animation', 'truly', 'something', 'behold', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'creeped', 'out', 'how', 'incredibly', 'real', 'everything', 'everyone', 'especially', 'terms', 'facial', 'expressions', 'communicate', 'characters', 'emotions', 'especially', 'fright', 'incredibly', 'well', 'house', 'model', 'anthropomorphic', 'CGI', 'particularly', 'when', 'really', 'life', 'attack', 'PG', 'movie', 'young', 'children', 'might', 'get', 'heebie-jeebies', 'house', 'more', 'frightful', 'manifestations', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'Monster', 'House', 'rollicking', 'good', 'fun', 'especially', 'when', 'subtlety', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'outrageous', 'even', 'wee', 'little', 'tyke', 'take', 'seriously.Here', 'bottom', 'line', 'children', 'should', 'get', 'real', 'kick', 'film', 'possible', 'frights', 'should', 'quickly', 'be', 'forgotten', 'thanks', 'humor', 'built', 'story', 'think', 'most', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Monster', 'House', 'certainly', 'Shrek', 'should', 'prove', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'one']",N/A

The boyfriend stuff is crass and some families will be offended by it.The producer who put that in this movie is a bit out of touch in my opinion.  There is no enhancement from it and only offends people.That scene which several reviewers complain about is a minute or so in the whole movie.  On to the rest of the movie.  This movie is a horror flick that is animated.  So it's kind of like a scary cartoon.  The quality reminds me of a typical pixar movie.There are a few lines in the movie that are very predictable.  The plot has some surprises that make it fun for most kids and teens to watch.Overall I would say it is one of the better movies we have watched recently and so I'm giving it a four star.  I hope you enjoy it.,4,Kids really like this movie,1161993600,"10 28, 2006",2006,803,"['plot', 'unique', 'are', 'drawn', 'more', 'more', 'boyfriend', 'stuff', 'crass', 'families', 'will', 'be', 'offended', 'it.The', 'producer', 'who', 'put', 'movie', 'bit', 'touch', 'opinion', 'enhancement', 'only', 'scene', 'several', 'reviewers', 'complain', 'minute', 'so', 'whole', 'movie', 'rest', 'movie', 'movie', 'horror', 'flick', 'animated', 'kind', 'scary', 'cartoon', 'quality', 'typical', 'pixar', 'are', 'few', 'lines', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'predictable', 'plot', 'surprises', 'make', 'fun', 'most', 'kids', 'teens', 'watch.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'one', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'recently', 'so', ""'m"", 'giving', 'four', 'star', 'hope', 'enjoy']",N/A
1020210,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000IFRT2O,David Bower,"[2, 2]","We watched this movie last night in 3D and found it imaginative and filled with action. It may have some scary scenes for the very young but is not, I would think, too scary for most younger viewers.One is given the option of viewing it in 2D or 3D; even in 3D there are some scenes that appear fairly sharp and clear without the glasses. It seems as if the 3D effect is applied unevenly to the movie; other scenes have the familiar blurring without the glasses.The sound is very good in surround mode with lots of action from the surround speakers in the big scenes. Although it is primarily for younger audiences, it has sufficient interest for many adults to enjoy watching as well.We'll probably not watch it too often but I'm glad to have it in my small, but growing collection of 3D movies.",4,Entertaining But Not a 3D Demo Movie,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,796,"['watched', 'movie', 'last', 'night', '3D', 'found', 'imaginative', 'filled', 'action', 'may', 'have', 'scary', 'scenes', 'very', 'young', 'not', 'would', 'think', 'too', 'scary', 'most', 'younger', 'viewers.One', 'given', 'option', 'viewing', '2D', '3D', 'even', '3D', 'are', 'scenes', 'appear', 'fairly', 'sharp', 'clear', 'glasses', '3D', 'effect', 'applied', 'unevenly', 'movie', 'other', 'scenes', 'have', 'familiar', 'blurring', 'glasses.The', 'sound', 'very', 'good', 'surround', 'mode', 'lots', 'action', 'surround', 'speakers', 'big', 'scenes', 'primarily', 'younger', 'audiences', 'sufficient', 'interest', 'many', 'adults', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'well.We', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'not', 'watch', 'too', 'often', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'small', 'growing', 'collection', '3D', 'movies']",N/A

1020214,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000IFRT2O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 25]","For many fans of filmmaker Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis and the work they did with the ""Back to the Future"" films, the news that the two would collaborate on another project made fans highly anticipating their next film.The collaboration would bethe 1996 CG animated film ""Monster House"" as the two filmmakers would serve as executive producers and utilizing performance capturing that was used in Zemeckis' film ""The Polar Express"".  Directing the film would be Gil Kenan (""City of Ember"") and feature a screenplay by Dan Harmon (""Community"", ""The Sarah Silverman Program"", ""Channel 101""), Rob Schrab (""The Sarah Silverman Program"", ""Channel 101"") and Pamela Pettler (""Corpse Bride"", ""9"").The film would feature the voices of Steve Buscemi (""Armageddon"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""28 Days""), Maggie Gyllenhaal (""The Dark Knight"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Mona Lisa Smile""), Mitchel Musso (""Hannah Montana"", ""Phineas and Ferb""), Sam Lerner (""The Secret Saturdays"") and Spencer Locke (""Cougar Town"", ""Big Time Rush"", ""Twentysixmiles"").  As well, as other talents such as Kathleen Turner, Jon Heder, Nick Cannon, Kevin James, Jason Lee, Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara.""Monster House"" was created with a $75 million budget and grossed over $140 million in the box office.  The film was released on DVD and also one of the first animated films to be released on Blu-ray (2006) and will now be released on Blu-ray in 3D on Sept. 14th.  It's important to note that this Blu-ray release also features a new upgraded version of ""Monster House"" in HD as well.VIDEO:""Monster House in 3D"" has two versions of the film, 2D and 3D.  The 2D version is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1) and the 3D version is presented in MVC Encoded 3D - Full Resolution L/R Eye.""Monster House"" is a film that utilizes performance capture technology.  Black levels are nice and deep, there is a faux fine layer of grain, there is a good amount of detail on the clothing, especially how you can see the threading in DJ's sweater and for a film created in 2006, the film still holds up today.  It may not have the super detail of today's CG animated films but the film still holds up quite well but of course, it will look a bit dated since 3D technology is improving at a quick rate.But the biggest difference between this release is that the film is presented in AVC not MPEG-2.  Also, the previous release was utilizing the older BD-25 (which many films on Blu-ray were released on).But the real purpose for people wanting this release is the 3D.  With Sony Pictures Home Entertainment's awesome release of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in 3D"" earlier this year, this is the second 3D offering from the company.It's important to note that to play this 3D, you will need a TV that is 3D enabled and comes with its own 3D glasses (or purchase them separately in pack) and also a Blu-ray player that is 3D-enabled as well.With that being said, I do have personal opinions on 3D.  Films that were created and made for 3D such as ""Avatar"" (which was exceptionally done) and then there are films in 3D such as ""Toy Story 3' in which the animation was great but the 3D was good especially of how the backgrounds were utilized.  And these two films have something in common, they are newer films.With ""Monster House"" and possibly more older films in the near future, we are going to see these older films being given the 3D treatment.  So, here are my impressions on ""Monster House in 3D"".  Backgrounds are well utilized as we can see the characters pop from the original backgrounds.  We can see how the trees that are lined up on the side of Nebbercracker's home really do stick out in 3D.  Another good example of 3D usage is something as basic as the steps of Nebbercracker's home looking very good, especially the blades of grass which looks very good in 3D.  The more action driven scenes especially as the kids try to destroy the house is well done but once again, it's mostly how objects stand out.  It's well done but for me, it's not the 3D I prefer.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Monster House in 3D"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and also Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The previous release was presented in LPCM 5.1 (and English, French and Korean Dolby Digital 5.1).  ""Monster House in 3D"" features an impressive soundtrack as you can hear the creaks and cracks when the monster house begins to expand and swallow things around it.  You can hear the leaves and fire and ambiance through the surround channels, while hearing LFE during the more action-driven scenes.Dialogue is crisp and clear as well as the music from composer Douglas Pipes.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Monster House in 3D"" comes with the following special features:* Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3D Sneak Peek - For those with a 3D enabled TV and the 3D glasses that came with the television and a 3D enabled Blu-ray player can watch a sneak peek of the 3D version of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 3D"" (which is currently available from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment).* Open House 3D Sneak Peek - For those with a 3D enabled TV and the 3D glasses that came with the television and a 3D enabled Blu-ray player can watch a sneak peek of the 3D version of ""Open House 3D"" (which is currently available from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment).* Filmmakers Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by director Gil Kenan and a few others who worked on the film.  Unfortunately, aside from the director, the other people don't identify themselves in the beginning of the commentary.  But overall, a very informative commentary which goes into detail on the characters, the scenes in the film and more.* Inside Monster House - (24:40) Featuring the following featurettes (in standard definition): Imaginary Heroes, Beginners Luck, The Best of Friends, Lots of Dots, Black Box Theater, Making It Real and Did You Hear That?* Evolution of a Scene: Eliza vs. Nebbercracker - (20:00) Featuring the following opening scene of little Eliza and Nebbercracker and how this scene went through various formats before its finalization.  Director Gil Kenan and artists discuss what they were trying to achieve.  Featuring the featurette, story reel animatic, performance capture, layout stage, animation, final film and composite.  Presented in standard definition.* The Art of Monster House - Using your remote, you can view conceptual art, character designs with the people of the animated film, places and things and more.JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love ""Monster House"" and love the characters, especially how the creators were able to work in the facial expressions for DJ, Chowder, Jenny and Zee.  Loved the more darker, scarier storyline.  It's a bit macabre when you think of who is possessing the house and how it happened, especially how Nebbercracker was created.  The voice acting also made the film much more enjoyable as there is a considerable amount of talent who worked on this film.Although the film has children as the main leads, this is a PG film and I can tell you right now that I've tried to show this too my child (seven year old) and he was scared and refused to watch more than 15 minutes of it, suffice to say, Nebbercracker freaked him out.  So, I wouldn't be surprised if other parents experienced the same situation with their children.But what many people will want to know about ""Monster House in 3D"" is how the overall 3D experience is and as mentioned earlier, I have my opinions when it comes to how 3D is being utilized with today's films.In my opinion, for me, there are two types of films in 3D and it depends on what kind of the 3D you like.  As mentioned, ""Avatar"" or even ""Captain EO"" which I watched in Disneyland many times which features creatures and things flying up to you.  That is the 3D I love.  But with 3D in which characters and objects look in 3D and things stand out (like ""Toy Story 3'), I'm not as impressed.  If anything, what I do like about this release is that you are getting both films in 3D and 2D and giving viewers that extra incentive.  Especially giving them that extra incentive to watch the movie again and making them wanting to buy the film.""Monster House in 3D"" is a film that I really enjoy watching and even watching it once again, I still haven't grown tired of it.  I did enjoy seeing how things look in 3D but once again, it's not the type of 3D that I was hoping for but it does work.  Also, it is important to remind people that ""Monster House"" is an older animated film (2006) and not like ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" which was released this year.  The way 3D was used for that film especially how many things are falling everywhere, was well done.""Monster House"" unfortunately, was not originally created with 3D in mind but yet, the 3D does work.  Not magnificently, but it's good enough to watch and see how 3D was implemented throughout the film.  But I'm more of the type who wants to see things moving around and I feel like I can put my hand up and feel like about to touch it.I also feel that 3D is best appreciated for those who have bigger viewing areas.  At a movie theater, you have a much larger screen to work with and I feel that 3D works much better in theater setting but once again, that is my opinion.But I do feel that ""Monster House in 3D"" is a fantastic release.  For one, it's a very good upgrade from the older original release (in fact, I feel that any Blu-ray disc released in 2006-2007 will probably need to be re-released as the format was not exactly properly well-utilized in the beginning) and two, you get the original 2D and 3D versions of the film.  Special features are still the same and I still have a beef with the audio commentary as we don't know who the heck is talking as the people commenting, didn't even announce themselves at the beginning of the audio commentary (with the exception of director Gil Kenan).Overall, I feel that ""Monster House in 3D"" was an enjoyable release and for those who purchased the original Blu-ray will definitely want this version for the upgrade (and for those who didn't purchase the Blu-ray earlier and have enjoyed the movie) and by then, you can always go back to it as 3D TV's and 3D enabled Blu-ray players will become a standard.  If you enjoyed the film for the first time and still don't own it, then this Blu-ray release is definitely worth considering.",4,Blu-ray: Monster House 3D is a solid release!  Not the best 3D release available but still very good!,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,10460,"['many', 'fans', 'filmmaker', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'work', 'did', 'Back', 'Future',

You see, we have a 4 and 8 year old who were not scared of the movie.  But, at this point, my wife and I were.-Said FRENCH KISSER also guzzles a BEER and GROPES the baby sitter in a DRUNKEN stupor.-PUBERTY is a prominent theme of the story.  Nothing wrong with that, but hardly a subject for young kids movies.Why the ""sexual"" aspects of the film are even there, I don't know.  They contributed little (or Nothing) to the plot.  If taken out, the story becomes no less complete or understandable.Now, I'm sure all of this sure sounds like freeked-out ""Moral Policing"".  However, what it actually is, is concerned parrenting.  Had I been given those little details mentioned above, I may have passed on taking my kids to this film.  So I write this review to fill that void which other reviewer failed to do.Personally, I thought this was such a great film on so many levels.  Excellent character development, interesting story, very cool animation.  I think some of the negative reviewers here completely don't get this film.My kids left the film happy and satisfied.  They were scared at parts (they're supposed to be) but thoroughly enjoyed it.  They actually slept like babies through the night (which rarely happens when we don't see a ""scary"" movie).But, to say it is targeted towards kids is not 100% true.Hope this helps other parents out there.UPDATEI received the DVD as a Christmas gift and watched it with my kids (the first part of this review is from the thaeatrical release).  I strategically skipped the scene with the boy friend french kissing the toy and groping the babysitter.  No one noticed.  this reinforced my point that it was useless character development time and contributed nothing to the story.  After a second viewing I'd still say this is a really good movie.  My 4 year old does not like it though.  Too scary.  He goes and plays in his room.Extras are good.  Nice to see the voice actors and how the film was executed.  Just remember, when the boyfriend picks up the stuffed bunny, hit the ""skip forward"" button.  Then your kids can watch a good, scary movie without sexual content.Update #2:My 4 year old is now 5.

It's very ""creepy"" to him, and what's worse it the old man living inside.  Everytime anything lands on the lawn, the man taks it as his own, usually after yelling at a child who touched the lawn.DJ's friend Chowder bought a new basket ball, but Chowder isn't to good.  As luck would have it,the ball lands on the lawn.  DJ and Chowder try to recover it, but the old man catches them and attack DJ.  As he does so, he throws his back and breaks his arm, and is sent to the hospital.That's when Dj and Chowder, accompanied by Jenny, realize the house is alive.  Thus, their exploration inside of it begins.MY OPINIONThat's it.  That's the plot.  It's pretty simple, and seems hard to drain a good movie out of it, and to tell the truth, it is.However!  The creators of Monster House made the plot effective, and actually pretty good!  It's not scary, but can startle anybody, and isn't recommended for children below 6.This movie was funny as well as frightning at sometimes, but mainly because of the 3D effects.  This movie should only be seen in 3D!  It's good because the movie doesn't try to ad things being thrown at you or falling on you.  Its in natural harmony with the 3d.I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie.  It's a bit childish, but that shouldn't stop you from viewing it.  If you want to watch a movie, this is your best bet!

Not the creators of this film.  As in their first filmThe Polar Express, they made innovative use of ""performance capture"" to accurately translate live performances into all-digital characters.  The problem was that a lot of people found the results an eerie and not-quite-lifelike distraction from what was intended to be a warm-hearted Christmas family classic, but this turns out to be exactly the right feeling for your characters to evoke in a scary film.The result?  The best Halloween movie ever made for children!Every neighborhood had one: the house whose lawn you didn't dare cut across, whose owner got some special kick out of screaming at children and stealing their toys.  In D.J. Walter's case it is Mr. Nebbercracker's house right across the street, and we and D.J. see Mr. Nebbercracker take (and break) young Eliza's trike in the shocking opening scene that sets the tone for what follows.  It seems D.J. has been spying upon and documenting Mr. Nebbercracker's activities for some time, but his clueless parents, hysterically portrayed by Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara, refuse to listen.  However, when his best friend Chowder loses his brand new basketball in Nebbercracker's lawn without drawing any immediate response, D.J. offers to make a run for it.  The resulting confrontation sees Mr. Nebbercracker taken away in an ambulance with no siren, and his house seemingly come to life.  Now, thanks to disbelieving adults, it will be up to D.J., Chowder, and Jenny, a girl the boys manage to rescue from the House's attack, to save the upcoming Halloween night's trick-or-treaters from a horrible fate.Thanks to a cast full of marvelous performances (Steve Buscemi's particularly stands out, along with that of the three children, Maggie Gyllenhaal as the world's worst babysitter, Jon Heder as the comic book/video game fanatic whose specialized knowledge points the way, and Kathleen Turner as the long lost Constance) plus the unsettlingly creepy motion capture animation, this movie nicely walks the knife edge of almost but never quite too scary for children.  Be sure and watch the credits to learn the fate of the fallen.The DVD contains a number of ""making of"" featurettes, of which the most interesting will likely be those showing the motion capture process.

Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!One such movie is ""Monster House"", a title that was largely overlooked upon its release, and seems to have been more or less forgotten in the sea of animated films that has been released over the past ten years. Although the animation of ""Monster House"" cannot compete with the top tier efforts of studios like Pixar, it's still quite good. More importantly, it's a fun story aimed at kids, with characters that are well drawn and likable. The neighborhood of the main characters is picturesque suburbia, bringing to mind those areas that kids so often like to ransack for candy during Halloween. And when they begin to suspect that all is not as it should be at their creepy neighbor's house, these three friends unite for a spooktacular adventure that is perfect for young ones on the Halloween holiday.",4,"Fun, lighthearted fare for the Halloween season",1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,1425,"['mid', 'October', 'rolls', 'around', 'brisk', 'winds', 'sweep', 'crisp', 'autumn', 'air', 'jack', ""o'lanterns"", 'decorate', 'steps', 'porches', 'scent', 'wood', 'smoke', 'wood', 'stoves', 'leaves', 'are', 'peak', 'season', 'color', 'October', 'magnificent', 'month', 'celebration', 'annual', 'visit', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'review', 'few', 'great', 'flicks', 'Halloween', 'season', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'review', 'are', 'alternative', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'not', 'classics', 'generally', 'spring', 'mind', 'fun', 'movies', 'elements', 'supernatural', 'Just', 'good', 'lighthearted', 'stuff', 'here', 'nothing', 'gory', 'scary', 'least', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'One', 'such', 'movie', 'Monster', 'House', 'title', 'was', 'largely', 'overlooked', 'release', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'forgotten', 'sea', 'animated', 'films', 'been', 'released', 'past', 'ten', 'years', 'animation', 'Monster', 'House', 'can', 'not', 'compete', 'top', 'tier', 'efforts', 'studios', 'Pixar', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'More', 'importantly', 'fun', 'story', 'aimed', 'kids', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'likable', 'neighborhood', 'main', 'characters', 'picturesque', 'suburbia', 'bringing', 'mind', 'areas', 'kids', 'so', 'often', 'ransack', 'candy', 'Halloween', 'when', 'begin', 'suspect', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'creepy', 'neighbor', 'house', 'three', 'friends', 'unite', 'spooktacular', 'adventure', 'perfect', 'young', 'ones', 'Halloween', 'holiday']",N/A

to release several animated films in a year that you almost cannot keep track anymore.  some of them, sadly, became mere exercises in digital graphics, mostly marketing the film through the famous hollywood actors who record the characters' voices.  i've stopped looking forward to new animated flicks of late, including monster house that i passed up when it was shown in theaters.but unlike other animated films (mostly with talking animals) that even failed to capture my attention when shown on the small screen, monster house was unlike anything i've seen before.the plot is typical - three prepubescent youngsters try to ""kill"" an evil house from eating halloween trick-or-treaters.  but the typical ends there.  the movie is filled with witty dialog and three-dimensional characters in a setting that has both its light and dark moments.  there are no cookie-cutter characters here - well, maybe the protagonists were cut off from the same mold as your average middle class suburban kids, but they were portrayed so naturally as far as movie tweeners go, bringing in an added sprinkling of spice in them.  the frontline bad guy nebbercracker was the typical grumpy recluse who drives away kids from his front lawn, but later in the film reveals a rich story that centers on the plot.everyone else in between was there to bring in the token comic relief - the goth babysitter, her rocker boyfriend, the video game dork, the police officers - all in a naturally amusing manner that was never contrived.i was aghast learning from imdb.com that ours is the only country where this movie had a G rating.  for instance, there was a minor scene where rocker boyfriend attempted to make out with babysitter on the sofa.  and while the main characters seemed generally well-adjusted, the story behind the house seemed too dark for young kids.  the house looked really scary, for one.  even scarier than the creatures in jumanji, which had a PG rating.  the film also explores adult issues, complicated grey areas like what to do if your loved one became an evil vengeful spirit, or moral questions such as ""does this movie unintentionally portray obese people as evil/scary?"" that can get ingrained on impressionable minds.  while the themes of unconditional love, devotion and letting go can be for all ages, it was shown so poignantly in the movie with adult sensibilities.well, i don't know.  i watched this movie as an adult and enjoyed it very much.  it lacked the air of happy-ever-after that most children's flicks are known for, but at least for the kids, the movie ended up happily.  that is, for the neighborhood, not exactly for nebbercracker who, though seemingly happy himself for his newfound freedom, would naturally have to deal with his grief and maybe regret not being able to live his life for 40 years (plus, where would he live now?).  to balance off these complications, the last part where all the toys were returned and all the people who were eaten up managed to climb out of the pit was a nice touch.  definitely for the young ones' benefit.memorable quote from the supporting character skull (the videogame enthusiast), attempting to impart some words of wisdom:""In my travels to video game and comic book conventions, I've seen many strange and wondrous things"".",5,that which restored my faith in animated

It's not a full-blown comedy which your kids will romp at, first of all, so if you're thinking this is like CARS or OVER THE HEDGE, you couldn't be more wrong. MONSTER HOUSE is more like a straight-up supernatural film but catered to those over 7 years old - those younger than 7 years will doubtless have recurring nightmares about certain scary sequences in this film. The story, involving three kids who face off against a monstrous, haunted house, is quite straightforward in its plot and stands out as being something darker than your normal animated endeavor. It does have its light touches and moments of the funny (I got a mild kick out of the little girl at the start humming the theme to AMAZING STORIES), but, for the most part, I'm not sure how well the comedy worked, especially since most of it is instigated by the irksome, chubby sidekick, Chowder. The computer graphics are pretty neat and certainly up to par with the other, technically sound, animated stuff being put out there. But the story left me a little cold, and I think a part of the reason why is because the protagonists weren't really that engaging. In fact, my favorite character turned out to be the enterprising cookie-selling girl Jenny. The lead kid, D.J., sorry to say, was very bland.I give kudos to Executive Producers Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg for eschewing the usual U.S. animated film formula and going a different route. So I'm laying down three stars for this one. MONSTER HOUSE is an expertly crafted effort, with great production values, including competent voice acting. But I didn't feel anything for the characters; ergo, I wasn't invested in whatever happened to them. The big reveal, when we find out the secret of the spooky house, turns out to be uninspired and anti-climactic. And, while I realize that things have to be kept at a PG rating, I was hoping that the folks swallowed by the house would stay swallowed, but, as I feared, by the end credits, they were back safe and sound. But, listen, I'm not saying it's a bad movie. Fans of R.L Stine's GOOSEBUMPS series and of John Bellair's Lewis Barnavelt books will certainly find much here to cling to. I just thought there'd be more to it.

I will say, though, that the plot is fresh and the story is engrossing! However, I'll tell you some of my impressions of the movie:1. This film is close to being PG-13. We were going to take our 8 year old son to see this movie but didn't get around to it. I'm glad we didn't! We asked him if he wanted to watch it with us now that we had the DVD, but he said ""No, too scary!"" He must be psychic like his Mom! Seriously, though, there's some pretty adult humor in this movie, as well as a scene with a gun (a cop says 'I'll shoot you!'). For example, DJ (the young boy who is a central character) refers to his stuffed animal as a ""she"". The babysitter's boyfriend says ""Oh yeah?""--and begins to lick the stuffed animal on the face (in an obviously sexual way). Another incident: DJ's friend, Chowder, tries to impress the prep girl and pretends to say to his Dad on the phone ""Oh yeah?! Kiss my hairy butt!"". He hangs up, turns to DJ and asks ""You gotta beer?"" And the babysitter's boyfriend leaves the house WITH a beer bottle, which ends up on the lawn of the Monster House (and is a central ""object"" for awhile). There's also some disgusting adolescent stuff like ""Skull"" saying he'd rather ""puke in tinfoil and eat it"". So while I don't mind this kind of thing, I sure don't want my 8 year old watching it! This flick should have been PG-13 for this kind of stuff alone, let alone the scariness!2. The ""camera angles"" in Monster House are brilliant. We, the audience, are exposed to new ways of seeing the world--not to mention getting some colorful and amazing animation! From the bright orange autumn leaves to the babysitter's goth-colored blue/black hair, to the window's glowing eyes to the eerie green glow and whirring planks of it's gaping maw--this is one solid dose of eye candy!3. The voice acting is perfect. As soon as I hear Mr. Nebbercrackers speak, I KNEW it was Steve Buscemi! He's one of my favorite actors and is absolutely perfect for the role. From watching the Special Features, it was interesting to find out that the writer (or director?) had a wish list of actors. He was told ""You'll never get them all...know one does."" Guess what? All his top picks accepted the parts to be in the movie!4. The plot is not easily guessible, in my opinion. This makes for a GREAT film. I felt like I was watching a movie that wasn't done before--which is refreshing.The Special Features include:*Filmmaker Commentary*7 Featurettes including: Imaginary Heroes, Beginner's Luck, The Best of Friends, Lots of Dots, Black Box Theater, Making It Real, Did You Hear That?*Evolution of a scene: Eliza vs. Nebbercracker*The Art of Monster House (Photo Gallery)*DVD-ROM (I didn't access this one)It was neat to discover that they actually placed microphones in a house that was being torn down to capture accurate sounds for the movie. It was also interesting to find out that the movie was done in motion-capture animation, with the characters acting out the story with those wired ""dots"" on the heads/body (think Andy Serkis playing Golem).While I don't feel this movie is good for the younger set, it's an EXCELLENT scary tale that's great for Halloween--or any time!",4,Great Scary Movie (But Not for Kids),1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,3357,"['husband', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Monster', 'House', 'DVD', 'was', 'time', 'well', 'spent', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 're-hash', 'plot', 'already', 'printed', 'Amazon', 'Editorial', 'Reviews', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'plot', 'fresh', 'story', 'engrossing', 'However', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'impressions', 'movie:1', 'film', 'close', 'being', 'PG-13', 'were', 'going', 'take', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'see', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'asked', 'wanted', 'watch', 'now', 'had', 'DVD', 'said', 'No', 'too', 'scary', 'must', 'be', 'psychic', 'Mom', 'Seriously', 'though', 'pretty', 'adult', 'humor', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'gun', 'cop', ""'ll"", 'shoot', 'example', 'DJ', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'central', 'character', 'refers', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'babysitter', 'boyfriend', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'lick', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'face', 'obviously', 'sexual', 'way', 'incident', 'DJ', 'friend', 'Chowder', 'impress', 'prep', 'girl', 'say', 'Dad', 'phone', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'Kiss', 'hairy', 'butt', 'up', 'DJ', 'got', 'ta', 'beer', 'babysitter', 'boyfriend', 'house', 'WITH', 'beer', 'bottle', 'up', 'lawn', 'Monster', 'House', 'central', 'object', 'awhile', 'also', 'disgusting', 'adolescent', 'stuff', 'Skull', 'saying', ""'d"", 'rather', 'puke', 'tinfoil', 'eat', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'kind', 'thing', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', '8', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'flick', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'PG-13', 'kind', 'stuff', 'alone', 'let', 'alone', 'scariness', '2', 'camera', 'angles', 'Monster', 'House', 'are', 'brilliant', 'audience', 'are', 'exposed', 'new', 'ways', 'seeing', 'world', 'not', 'mention', 'getting', 'colorful', 'amazing', 'animation', 'bright', 'orange', 'autumn', 'babysitter', 'goth-colored', 'blue/black', 'hair', 'window', 'glowing', 'eyes', 'eerie', 'green', 'glow', 'whirring', 'planks', 'gaping', 'maw', 'one', 'solid', 'dose', 'eye', 'candy', '3', 'voice', 'acting', 'perfect', 'As', 'soon', 'hear', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercrackers', 'speak', 'KNEW', 'was', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'role', 'watching', 'Special', 'Features', 'was', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'writer', 'director', 'had', 'wish', 'list', 'actors', 'was', 'told', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'Guess', 'what', 'top', 'picks', 'accepted', 'parts', 'be', 'movie', '4', 'plot', 'not', 'easily', 'guessible', 'opinion', 'GREAT', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'before', 'refreshing.The', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', '*Filmmaker', 'Commentary*7', 'Featurettes', 'including', 'Imaginary', 'Heroes', 'Beginner', 'Luck', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Lots', 'Dots', 'Black', 'Box', 'Theater', 'Making', 'Real', 'Did', 'Hear', '*Evolution', 'scene', 'Eliza', 'Nebbercracker*The', 'Art', 'Monster', 'House', 'Photo', 'Gallery', '*DVD-ROM', 'did', ""n't"", 'access', 'one', 'was', 'neat', 'discover', 'actually', 'placed', 'microphones', 'house', 'was', 'being', 'torn', 'capture', 'accurate', 'sounds', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'motion-capture', 'animation', 'characters', 'acting', 'out', 'story', 'wired', 'dots', 'heads/body', 'think', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'playing', 'Golem', '.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'good', 'younger', 'set', 'EXCELLENT', 'scary', 'tale', 'great', 'Halloween', 'time']",N/A

The 3-D animation is not gimmicky like in an old Friday the 13th or Amnityville Horror film.  The ""3-Dness"" just adds depth and beauty.  Smoke curls around characters seems to come out into the audience. Ordinary items seem to come alive.  Don't be mistaken however, this IS a horror movie.  It has most of the essential elements: absent parents, hot babysitters, creepy old people, alcohol, ghosts,ominous dreams,and carnival freaks.  We saw lots of kids and parents leaving the theater.

This animated movie has some pretty scary moments in it that might be too scary for younger children.As for the story itself, DJ's parents have just went away for a few days, leaving DJ in the care of Elizabeth, or ""Z"" as she prefers to be called.  Z is not your typical teenage girl; she's into the Goth scene and has a boyfriend named Bones.  But these are the least of DJ's problems.  He's more concerned about the strange man across the street who lives in a dilapidated old house.  Objects are mysteriously disappearing from the front yard, and old man Nebbercracker is constantly warning kids to stay away.  DJ's best friend Chowder even loses his new basketball on the lawn.  What can be causing all of these strange occurances?The answer is soon revealed as Jenny, a young girl selling candy, knocks on DJ's door.  After being turned down by DJ, she goes across the street to Nebbercracker's house.  But the house itself mysteriously comes to life and tries to suck Jenny in.  Jenny soon joins up with DJ and Chowder to try to discover what's going on in the house.  However, the police foil their attempt to get inside.  They are placed in the police car to be taken away when the house comes alive and sucks the car with the children inside.  Now that they have managed to get inside, will they be able to get back out again?I found this movie to be somewhat scarier than I expected.  Even though the film is animated, there are some genuinely scary parts that may not be suitable for young children.  Also, there are some questionable scenes, such as Bones and Z making out a little on the sofa, and Chowder talking about drinking beer.  Finally, there's the classic pee in the soda bottle scene.Overall, I did find this movie to be pretty good.  I liked the storyline of the house coming to life, and the animation is very good.  However, I would just caution parents with young children to make sure that they view the movie together.  My five-year-old daughter was very scared for most of the movie, and she watched it with us plus her older brother and sister.  So, watch this movie with care if there are young children present.",4,Scarier Than it Looks,1223251200,"10 6, 2008",2008,2199,"['Beware', 'innocent-looking', 'cover', 'DVD', 'case', 'animated', 'movie', 'pretty', 'scary', 'moments', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'younger', 'children.As', 'story', 'DJ', 'parents', 'have', 'just', 'went', 'away', 'few', 'days', 'leaving', 'DJ', 'care', 'Elizabeth', 'Z', 'be', 'called', 'Z', 'not', 'typical', 'teenage', 'girl', 'Goth', 'scene', 'boyfriend', 'named', 'Bones', 'are', 'least', 'DJ', 'problems', 'more', 'concerned', 'strange', 'man', 'street', 'who', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'house', 'Objects', 'are', 'mysteriously', 'disappearing', 'front', 'yard', 'old', 'man', 'Nebbercracker', 'constantly', 'warning', 'kids', 'stay', 'away', 'DJ', 'best', 'friend', 'Chowder', 'even', 'new', 'basketball', 'lawn', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'causing', 'strange', 'occurances', 'answer', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Jenny', 'young', 'girl', 'selling', 'candy', 'knocks', 'DJ', 'door', 'being', 'turned', 'down', 'DJ', 'street', 'Nebbercracker', 'house', 'house', 'mysteriously', 'life', 'tries', 'suck', 'Jenny', 'Jenny', 'soon', 'up', 'DJ', 'Chowder', 'try', 'discover', 'what', 'going', 'house', 'However', 'police', 'foil', 'attempt', 'get', 'inside', 'are', 'placed', 'police', 'car', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'when', 'house', 'alive', 'car', 'children', 'Now', 'have', 'managed', 'get', 'inside', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'out', 'again', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'somewhat', 'scarier', 'expected', 'Even', 'film', 'animated', 'are', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'parts', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'Also', 'are', 'questionable', 'scenes', 'such', 'Bones', 'Z', 'making', 'out', 'little', 'sofa', 'Chowder', 'talking', 'drinking', 'beer', 'Finally', 'classic', 'pee', 'soda', 'bottle', 'scene.Overall', 'did', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'liked', 'storyline', 'house', 'coming', 'life', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'However', 'would', 'just', 'caution', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'make', 'sure', 'view', 'movie', 'together', 'five-year-old', 'daughter', 'was', 'very', 'scared', 'most', 'movie', 'watched', 'older', 'brother', 'sister', 'So', 'watch', 'movie', 'care', 'are', 'young', 'children', 'present']",N/A

After viewing this I thought it was good and frightening for the event. My kids were mesmerize buy it while my husband on the other hand was frighten by it (Just kidding). ""Monster House"" is defiantly good and cool for kids (7 years and up), yet certain to be a hit with grown-ups but defiantly not for the younger tot's. It manages to strike a chord with children by inhabiting the world they live in, full of creepy old men living in haunted houses, while at the same time, offering up enough scares and laughs to keep any 30 year old kid at heart thoroughly entertained.The animation is nothing short of inspired, as the motion capture technology truly breathes life into the CGI animation. Facial expressions, ""camera angles"" and ""tracking shots"" are planned with painstaking detail; it's truly a sight to behold. You'll forget you're watching a 'cartoon' right from the fluttering leaf of the opening credits.Not content to stop there, the filmmakers have added to the superb animation with equally superb writing and a cast to deliver those lines. Familiar voices (see the above credits) fill the adult characters with a lot of humor, even though each adult is given only about 5 minutes of screen time. Each actor does a lot with their 5 minutes, completely deserving of their pay check. The clever casting of Jon Heder makes this the first film to get full dynamite for his cameo, as he fits in perfectly as an arcade legend.Still, with all this going for it, ""Monster House"" would have failed if its child roles didn't measure up. Fortunately, the three leads steal the show, aptly performing voice work that stretches from childhood tomfoolery to ghastly terror to puppy love, all within the same scene. Their honest approach to the scripts' clever and accurate depiction of children almost too old for trick or treating, yet not quite old enough to forget the bogeyman makes this a film that will certainly become a perennial Halloween favorite under the kids listing.",4,Great movie Destined to Become an Annual Halloween Favorite.,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,2118,"['was', ""n't"", 'able', 'catch', 'theater', 'was', 'able', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'watch', 'entire', 'family', 'Halloween', 'night', 'viewing', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'frightening', 'event', 'kids', 'were', 'mesmerize', 'buy', 'husband', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'frighten', 'Just', 'kidding', 'Monster', 'House', 'defiantly', 'good', 'cool', 'kids', '7', 'years', 'up', 'yet', 'certain', 'be', 'hit', 'grown-ups', 'defiantly', 'not', 'younger', 'tot', 'strike', 'chord', 'children', 'inhabiting', 'world', 'live', 'full', 'creepy', 'old', 'men', 'living', 'haunted', 'houses', 'same', 'time', 'offering', 'up', 'enough', 'scares', 'keep', '30', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'heart', 'thoroughly', 'entertained.The', 'animation', 'nothing', 'short', 'inspired', 'motion', 'capture', 'technology', 'truly', 'breathes', 'life', 'CGI', 'animation', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'camera', 'angles', 'tracking', 'shots', 'are', 'planned', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'truly', 'sight', 'behold', ""'ll"", 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'cartoon"", 'right', 'fluttering', 'leaf', 'opening', 'credits.Not', 'content', 'stop', 'there', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'added', 'superb', 'animation', 'equally', 'superb', 'writing', 'cast', 'deliver', 'lines', 'Familiar', 'voices', 'see', 'above', 'credits', 'fill', 'adult', 'characters', 'lot', 'humor', 'even', 'adult', 'given', 'only', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'actor', 'lot', '5', 'minutes', 'completely', 'deserving', 'pay', 'check', 'clever', 'casting', 'Jon', 'Heder', 'first', 'film', 'get', 'full', 'dynamite', 'cameo', 'perfectly', 'arcade', 'legend.Still', 'going', 'Monster', 'House', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'child', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Fortunately', 'three', 'leads', 'steal', 'show', 'aptly', 'performing', 'voice', 'work', 'childhood', 'tomfoolery', 'ghastly', 'terror', 'puppy', 'love', 'same', 'scene', 'honest', 'approach', 'scripts', 'clever', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'children', 'almost', 'too', 'old', 'trick', 'treating', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'old', 'enough', 'forget', 'bogeyman', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'become', 'perennial', 'Halloween', 'favorite', 'kids', 'listing']",N/A

In the old man's absense him and his friend soon realize that the house is actually alive. It's not only alive but it's not a nice house house either and attempts to eat whatever goes near it.

This time around, the whole context of the movie will appeal to a wider audience so this is a great opportunity to display the possibilities that this all digital technology offers.Beyond the technical achievement, Monsterhouse is an excellent surprise for its family-oriented audience. Unlike Dreamworks and their Shrek-ish, below-the-belt, cynically adult-oriented features, this movie aims at both the kids and grown-ups in a way that tends to unite them around its subject, rather than addressing the two categories separately and alternatively.To kids, this will be their first experience of an actual horror flick: the house IS seriously haunted and this is definitly no Casper-like curse. Lives are at stake here and the line between good and evil is not so strictly defined.Some aspects of the plot have a very macabre touch, still a bittersweet feeling comes in balance towards the end.A real implication is required from the kids, especially because a few thrills awaits them once the house has awaken.On the parents' side, besides the fact that for those like me who grew up with the Amblin productions of the eighties (The Goonies, The Gremlins and co), you are in for a great back-to-the-future nostalgic trip. Not only because the action takes place in the 80's (various hints lead to believe it)but because the whole atmosphere, the characters, the humour will either make you wish you could still be 5 to 10 years old to fully dive into this nightmarish story, or simply will make you forget you've grown older and make you actually feel like you're a kid again.So thank you Mr Zemeckis and Mr Spielberg for producing this little gem, which, though it draws its inspiration from a classic tradition of haunted mansion archetypes, never fails to find its own identity and energy.In a nutshell: great style and screenplay, technically impressive and very concerned about offering a satisfying show to the audience.",4,good tricks for kids and a treat for their parents,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2041,"['Monster', 'House', 'same', 'motion-capture', 'technology', 'Zemeckis', 'Polar', 'Express', 'next', 'level', 'time', 'around', 'whole', 'context', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'wider', 'audience', 'so', 'great', 'opportunity', 'display', 'possibilities', 'digital', 'technology', 'technical', 'achievement', 'Monsterhouse', 'excellent', 'surprise', 'family-oriented', 'audience', 'Dreamworks', 'Shrek-ish', 'below-the-belt', 'cynically', 'adult-oriented', 'features', 'movie', 'kids', 'grown-ups', 'way', 'unite', 'around', 'subject', 'rather', 'addressing', 'two', 'categories', 'separately', 'alternatively.To', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'experience', 'actual', 'horror', 'flick', 'house', 'seriously', 'haunted', 'definitly', 'Casper-like', 'curse', 'Lives', 'are', 'stake', 'here', 'line', 'good', 'evil', 'not', 'so', 'strictly', 'defined.Some', 'aspects', 'plot', 'have', 'very', 'macabre', 'touch', 'still', 'bittersweet', 'feeling', 'balance', 'end.A', 'real', 'implication', 'required', 'kids', 'especially', 'few', 'thrills', 'once', 'house', 'awaken.On', 'parents', 'side', 'fact', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Amblin', 'productions', 'eighties', 'Goonies', 'Gremlins', 'co', 'are', 'great', 'back-to-the-future', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'Not', 'only', 'action', 'place', '80', 'various', 'hints', 'lead', 'believe', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'characters', 'humour', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'wish', 'could', 'still', 'be', '5', '10', 'years', 'old', 'fully', 'dive', 'nightmarish', 'story', 'simply', 'will', 'make', 'forget', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'older', 'make', 'actually', 'feel', ""'re"", 'kid', 'again.So', 'thank', 'Mr', 'Zemeckis', 'Mr', 'Spielberg', 'producing', 'little', 'gem', 'inspiration', 'classic', 'tradition', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'archetypes', 'never', 'find', 'own', 'identity', 'energy.In', 'nutshell', 'great', 'style', 'screenplay', 'technically', 'impressive', 'very', 'concerned', 'offering', 'satisfying', 'show', 'audience']",N/A

He's been watching his neighbor Mr. Nebbercracker for a while and noticed that this old man is hiding something and it doesn't DJ long to find out what it is.While playing basketball with his friend Chowder their ball gets away from them and lands on Mr. Nebbercracker's lawn. Dj tries to get it back and before he can get it Nebbercracker pops up and grabs DJ and lifts him up to really scare him. Nebbercracker quickly turns pale and falls on top of DJ. Of course DJ now thinks that he killed Nebbercracker and feels awful but while paramedics are carrying him away he drops a key, DJ notices it and picks it up. After Nebbercracker is taken away strange things start to happen, the house starts to move and make sounds. That night the house eats DJ's babysitters' boyfriend by luring him with a kite Nebbercracker took from him years before. The next day the house ate a dog and tried to eat a girl scout that DJ and Chowder are quite fond of. They quickly save the girl and before you know it the three team up on an adventure to destroy the house before it does anymore harm.Monster House is one weird but super cool movie that I'm sure not just kids but families period will enjoy. It has an ability to keep the interest of even the most energetic kid and a very original story that is exciting. It's action packed and suspenseful, when kids see these three heroes fight the man-eating house they'll go crazy. It has great characters in DJ, Chowder, and Jenny and they're all very funny especially Chowder. The voice acting is great, when I heard Officer Lander talk I knew right off it was Kevin James and Nick Cannon was good too. Monster House is great for everybody, it has funny characters, great story, perfect animation, and the ending is action packed, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.",5,There Were Monster Houses When I Was Growing Up,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,2243,"['Monster', 'House', 'one', 'cool', 'flick', 'especially', 'so', 'many', 'new', 'things', 'table', 'Monster', 'House', 'mean', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercracker', 'who', 'constantly', 'shouting', 'kids', 'keep', 'away', 'house', 'automatically', 'get', 'realize', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', 'movie', 'deeper', 'actually', 'not', 'case', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'when', 'boy', 'named', 'DJ', 'something', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'been', 'watching', 'neighbor', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercracker', 'while', 'noticed', 'old', 'man', 'hiding', 'something', ""n't"", 'DJ', 'long', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'is.While', 'playing', 'basketball', 'friend', 'Chowder', 'ball', 'away', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercracker', 'lawn', 'Dj', 'get', 'back', 'can', 'get', 'Nebbercracker', 'up', 'grabs', 'DJ', 'lifts', 'up', 'really', 'scare', 'Nebbercracker', 'quickly', 'pale', 'top', 'DJ', 'course', 'DJ', 'now', 'killed', 'Nebbercracker', 'feels', 'awful', 'paramedics', 'are', 'carrying', 'away', 'key', 'DJ', 'up', 'Nebbercracker', 'taken', 'away', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'house', 'move', 'make', 'sounds', 'night', 'house', 'DJ', 'babysitters', 'boyfriend', 'luring', 'kite', 'Nebbercracker', 'took', 'years', 'next', 'day', 'house', 'ate', 'dog', 'tried', 'eat', 'girl', 'scout', 'DJ', 'Chowder', 'are', 'quite', 'fond', 'quickly', 'save', 'girl', 'know', 'three', 'team', 'up', 'adventure', 'destroy', 'house', 'anymore', 'harm.Monster', 'House', 'one', 'weird', 'super', 'cool', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'not', 'just', 'kids', 'families', 'period', 'will', 'enjoy', 'ability', 'keep', 'interest', 'even', 'most', 'energetic', 'kid', 'very', 'original', 'story', 'exciting', 'action', 'packed', 'suspenseful', 'when', 'kids', 'see', 'three', 'heroes', 'fight', 'man-eating', 'house', ""'ll"", 'go', 'crazy', 'great', 'characters', 'DJ', 'Chowder', 'Jenny', ""'re"", 'very', 'funny', 'especially', 'Chowder', 'voice', 'acting', 'great', 'when', 'heard', 'Officer', 'Lander', 'talk', 'knew', 'right', 'was', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'Monster', 'House', 'great', 'everybody', 'funny', 'characters', 'great', 'story', 'perfect', 'animation', 'ending', 'action', 'packed', 'definitely', 'movie', 'seeing']",N/A
1020251,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,B000IFRT2O,Kendal B. Hunter,"[1, 2]","To begin: If you have seen one Spielberg movie, you've seen them all. Somewhere Spielberg developed a templette of characters, situations, and jokes that are constantly reshuffled and  reused in all of his films.  Call in sick one Friday, and spend the entire weekend watching Goonies, Gremlins I and II, E.T.,  * batteries not included, Twilight Zone: The Movie and any six episodes of Amazing Stories.  If you have seen these, then you have seen this film.Although the plot, theme, characterization, and setting are shopworn, Spielberg excels with his style.  His framing, pans, and trademark sweeps are all there, and make all of his above mentioned films pure eye-eye candy.  Two examples of his framing involve the Monster House being framed within the upstairs window of DJ's room.  In one shot you get both the Children's reaction, and the ever-present, ever-looming, ever-threatening Monster House.  The second has to do when the children approach the house.  We see the children through an upper-story window (window, BTW, is from old Norse ""wind-eye""), looking down on the Lilliputian invaders.  The point-of-view is from this evil house, and adds to the eeriness.  For a brief second, we become the house, reinforcing the feeling that we are dealing with a sentient (and malevolent) entity.This feeling of evil brings us to a sad point: Spielberg can do Orson Welles, but cannot do Rod Serling.  He has the artistry of the camera, but does not have the philosophy to handle evil.  Spielberg has a soft spot for a happy ending, and this limits his ability to do say anything meaningful about evil.  His antagonists are merely brutal. Thus, there is none of the brooding and intelligent malevolence that you see in Serling's work (such as Billy Mumy in ""It's a Good Life""), or in ""Lord of the Rings.""  His films are not scary--just brutish and disgusting.Consequently the Film's ""Happy Ending"" seems appended--or merely squeezed in-between  the climax and the end credits.  It certainly does not grow out of the fabric of the movie.  So is Mrs. Nebbercracker evil--which is how she is portrayed for 97% of the move--or is she just a misunderstood hausgeist who has low self esteem?  The parting kiss made no sense, since she was so brutal to so many people for such along time.The ""killed"" people, also come back to life, using a similar gimmick that I first saw in"" Ghostbusters.""  It brought a chuckle, and tempered the tone of the movie.There are smaller criticisms of the film, mostly dealing with it's logic:  Why are the parents leaving on Halloween? Who has ""other plans"" or schedules a business conference on Halloween? Why would Jenny be so trusting of these strangers?  Where are her parents?  Where are the parents in general?  How come only these children see the house, but no adults? (Like Buffy's high school paper having an obituary column)Additional criticisms have to do with the predictable humor: Rocky Mountain Wee Water, the kissing up to Jenny, the Uvula (I saw that coming a mile away).  What was most disturbing was the depiction of the black cop.  Holy Cain was raised over Jar-Jar being a Steppin' Fetchit, but when we get the same gollywog templette in this movie, not a peep.So maybe I should just watch Spielberg's film with the sound down.  The good news is if I did this, nothing would be lost.",3,"Somewhere between ""Ghostbusters"" and ""The Black Cauldron"".",1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,3335,"['begin', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'Spielberg', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Somewhere', 'Spielberg', 'developed', 'templette', 'characters', 'situations', 'jokes', 'are', 'constantly', 'reshuffled', 'reused', 'films', 'Call', 'sick', 'one', 'Friday', 'spend', 'entire', 'weekend', 'watching', 'Goonies', 'Gremlins', 'II', 'E.T.', '*', 'not', 'included', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Movie', 'six', 'episodes', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'have', 'seen', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'plot', 'theme', 'characterization', 'setting', 'are', 'shopworn', 'Spielberg', 'style', 'framing', 'pans', 'trademark', 'sweeps', 'are', 'there', 'make', 'above', 'mentioned', 'films', 'pure', 'eye-eye', 'candy', 'Two', 'examples', 'framing', 'involve', 'Monster', 'House', 'being', 'framed', 'upstairs', 'window', 'DJ', 'room', 'one', 'shot', 'get', 'Children', 'reaction', 'ever-present', 'ever-looming', 'ever-threatening', 'Monster', 'House', 'second', 'do', 'when', 'children', 'approach', 'house', 'see', 'children', 'upper-story', 'window', 'window', 'BTW', 'old', 'Norse', 'wind-eye', 'looking', 'down', 'Lilliputian', 'invaders', 'point-of-view', 'evil', 'house', 'eeriness', 'brief', 'second', 'become', 'house', 'reinforcing', 'feeling', 'are', 'dealing', 'sentient', 'malevolent', 'feeling', 'evil', 'brings', 'sad', 'point', 'Spielberg', 'can', 'do', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'artistry', 'camera', 'not', 'have', 'philosophy', 'handle', 'evil', 'Spielberg', 'soft', 'spot', 'happy', 'ending', 'ability', 'do', 'say', 'anything', 'meaningful', 'evil', 'antagonists', 'are', 'merely', 'brutal', 'Thus', 'none', 'brooding', 'intelligent', 'malevolence', 'see', 'Serling', 'work', 'such', 'Billy', 'Mumy', 'Good', 'Life', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'scary', 'just', 'brutish', 'disgusting.Consequently', 'Film', 'Happy', 'Ending', 'appended', 'merely', 'squeezed', 'in-between', 'climax', 'end', 'certainly', 'not', 'grow', 'fabric', 'movie', 'So', 'Mrs.', 'Nebbercracker', 'evil', 'how', 'portrayed', '97', '%', 'move', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'hausgeist', 'who', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'parting', 'kiss', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'so', 'brutal', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'such', 'time.The', 'killed', 'people', 'also', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'using', 'similar', 'gimmick', 'first', 'saw', 'Ghostbusters', 'brought', 'chuckle', 'tempered', 'tone', 'movie.There', 'are', 'smaller', 'criticisms', 'film', 'mostly', 'dealing', 'logic', 'Why', 'are', 'parents', 'leaving', 'Halloween', 'Who', 'other', 'plans', 'business', 'conference', 'Halloween', 'Why', 'would', 'Jenny', 'be', 'so', 'trusting', 'strangers', 'Where', 'are', 'parents', 'Where', 'are', 'parents', 'general', 'How', 'come', 'only', 'children', 'see', 'house', 'adults', 'Buffy', 'high', 'school', 'paper', 'having', 'obituary', 'column', 'Additional', 'criticisms', 'have', 'do', 'predictable', 'humor', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'Wee', 'Water', 'kissing', 'up', 'Jenny', 'Uvula', 'saw', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'What', 'was', 'most', 'disturbing', 'was', 'depiction', 'black', 'cop', 'Holy', 'Cain', 'was', 'raised', 'Jar-Jar', 'being', 'Steppin', 'Fetchit', 'when', 'get', 'same', 'gollywog', 'templette', 'movie', 'not', 'peep.So', 'maybe', 'should', 'just', 'watch', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'sound', 'down', 'good', 'news', 'did', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'lost']",N/A
1020252,A3OJJ7NEM84WAD,B000IFRT2O,"Kenneth Mark Hoover ""opinionated book worm""","[0, 0]","Horror, more than any other genre, has the ability to manifest its power in many different forms. This stems first and foremost from the fact horror is primarily an emotional and visceral genre, whereas science fiction, say, might have more of a cerebral background.Because this is true for horror we often find stories that work on many different levels: poignant, evocative, and fundamentally human.  When these stories find their way to film, and when everything clicks from characterization to script, we have a real gem on our hands.Monster House is such a movie.  In fact this is one damned cute movie.  The script is not only well-written, it's highly intelligent and at no time condescends to the viewer.  That's something we don't see everyday from the formulaic schlock normally churned out from Tinseltown.I mean, come on, let's face it.  With dialog like this from a little girl: ""If that's its teeth, and the carpet is its tongue, then that (a chandelier) is its uvula.""With the riposte from the little boy: ""Oh, you mean it's a girl house....!""And other gems like semi-precious stones: ""Good luck with puberty!"" and, ""I'm sorry about your house.  I mean your wife.  I mean, your housewife.""The characters, especially the three computer generated children, are fantastically drawn and lovingly created. These are true three-dimensional characters in every sense of the word.  Like I said, everything clicks in this movie and it's a real treat.  From the beginning we believe these children are alive.  What's more, we are willing to risk an emotional investment in their spooky escapades...and we are not disappointed in the outcome.Horror doesn't always work.  When it misses the mark it's achingly bad to watch (or read).  But when it does work, especially in an intelligent and unforgettable movie like this one -- chock full of delicious in-jokes -- it can't be dismissed.If you ever get a chance, please, give this worthwhile movie a peek.

1020253,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000IFRT2O,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[3, 6]","There's been so much animation released this year, that it's almost been hard to keep track it all. We've gotten cartoons about monkey's, cars, and teenagers who drift in mountains in Tokyo (oh wait). Keeping track of them can be a bit of a chore, and I had no reason to be really excited about ""Monster House"" in any way. I mean, the story seems simple enough: Old man across the street lives in a house that is secretly haunted and READY TO EAT YOU IF YOU STEP ON THE LAWN!!!!!! Yeah, okay, that sounds pretty lame. Oh, and this movie is being made from a guy who has never made a movie before and just got out of college? Gee, this all sounds so...fun. I'm sorry, but when I can sum up the storyline in one sentence, it gets hard to get into the idea behind the movie.But I am here to tell you, I was wrong in my assumptions. Dead wrong. From the way the movies looked, this looked like a movie for little kids prying on their fears that old houses will eat you while spitting on you, or something like that. But ""Monster House"" not only ends up being far more complicated and deep then the previews suggest, it actually ends up being scary. The story revolves around a twelve year old boy named D.J. D.J. is growing up, his voice is starting to crack, and he's starting to notice girls. When his best friend, a boy with the strange name of Chowder, comes over to inquire about Trick or Treating on Halloween the next day, D.J. says that he doesn't intend to Trick or Treat, as that sort of thing is beginning to feel very silly to him as he gets older.The only possibly reason D.J. would have to going Trick or Treating would be if the babysitter he was being stuck with all weekend got on his nerves to a certain extent (when we meet her, we find that she might be all the motivation he needs to go out). But while the two boys are playing basketball, their balls falls on old man Nebbercrackers lawn, who died the previous day of a heart attack. When D.J. goes to retrieve the ball, the windows become eyes, the door becomes a mouth, and the trees become hands, and the house comes alive as he attacks young D.J. in a sudden and surprising attack sequence. The boys report the house to the police and the babysitter, but no one believes their story. Well, two people do. A pizza delivery boy named Skull believes them because of things he's seen between his journeys to his comic book conventions, and a girl named Jenny (who believes them mainly because the house tries to eat her).When the house actually attacks and manages to eat someone, the kids realize they must do what they can to destroy the house before Halloween night comes, and tons of kids are put into danger. From this point on, we get a complicated film where secrets about the house are discovered, characters feelings are dived into, and some surprisingly scary moments lurk around every corner. This is one of the few animated features to actually set a mood and aura to create suspense and fear, instead of just making things jump out of shadows, which results more in cheap jumps then actual fear. One sequence where the kids launch in a plan gone wrong in particular gets very intense, very scary, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.In fact, the whole movie does an extremely good job of balanced these terrifying, scary, excellent action sequences with these slow, somber, and intelligent scenes of dialog and character interaction. There is some humor spread out that feels like it was tacked on so that kids have something to laugh about (and I can't say they won't need these moments), but overall this is a thriller crossed with a character drama. Of course, you wouldn't know any of this is you watched the previews, but that's okay. This is what reviews are for. Reviews are also helpful because there might be a good movie that you wouldn't really know was good unless you read a good review. One of these movies if ""Monster House."" From the people I've talked to, no one has really been interested in this movie.Either the story from the previews sound lame and boring. Maybe people are having a hard time keeping track of all the animated films out there. The biggest star in this movie is Jon Hedar, and he less then fifteen lines of dialog. The biggest reason though, from what I hear, is that it sounded like a kiddie film. Trust me folks, this is NOT a kiddie film! In fact, I'm going to venture to say that this film is scary enough, that I think kids under the age of ten are going to be scared by this film, as it really does become quite trippy (if you know what I mean). I also have to admit, this film gets quite sad near the end of the movie, to the point where I was on the verge of tears (of course, I'm a sucker for sad stories).In fact, if it weren't for the fact that ""A Scanner Darkly"" came out this year, I would say that ""Monster House"" would have been the front runner for Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards. If ""A Scanner Darkly"" doesn't win though, I'm sure this wonderful film will win. ""Monster House"" took me completely by surprise, as I wasn't expecting anything more then a simple kids movie. Instead, I got one of the most scary, action packed, emotional animated films I've seen since 2002's ""Spirited Away."" Here's hoping people take the time and take a chance on this wonderful film. Just leave all kids under ten at home, because this film is scary. I can't stress that enough, if you have kids under the age of ten, LEAVE THEM AT HOME!!!!Side Note: Some theaters are showing this movie in 3D using the Real Cinema 3D process. Having seen the movie in 3D, I can testify that the 3D adds to the whole experience, and if the option to see it in 3D is available to you, then take it.",4,A Scary Good Time,1153958400,"07 27,

Above that age group, though, this is still a wonderful tale with just enough creeps and spooks to keep older children and adults interested in the story.It starts out with an adorable little girl triking through the neighborhood.  She's sweetly saying hello to the leaves, the fence, and pretty much everything she crosses paths with.  When her trike accidentally lands on the lawn of creepy Mr. Nebbercracker, however, the story takes a very dark turn and keeps that atmosphere until the climax of the film.  D.J. knows that something is not quite right with the house, and his diligent spying finally lands him the answer that he is after when he and his pal, Chowder, go after their basketball when it lands on the Nebbercracker lawn.His parents don't believe him, his babysitter doesn't care, and even the police think D.J. is nothing more than a very imaginative little boy.  In short, D.J. and Chowder are on their own when they decide to get to the bottom of the strange goings on at the old house.  They pick up a new friend in cookies salesgirl, Jenny, who has her own run-in with the house.  Together they set out to solve the mystery of the home, it's owner, and one of its former residents.  It's a great mystery/thriller that has a far-fetched, adventurous, ending and is just plain fun for the whole family.As stated before, children under five may find this flick to be too scary.  People and animals ""die"" early and often in this film.  The house can be downright terrifying at times for younger audiences as well.  However, if you're kids can handle most of the scares from films like ""Haunted Mansion,"" they can handle this flick.  Rest assured that the ending (it's important to watch through the first half of the credits) isn't as bad as you might think, and the body count isn't as terrible as it would seem.  In fact, you'll find that there's quite a bit of heart in this film once the culprit behind all of the hauntings is revealed.The DVD is wonderful.  It has a nice selection of documentaries on the making of the film that are actually very interesting to watch.  There are the obligatory ""pats on the back"" by the crew involved, but most of them seem more excited to be allowed to make a film like this than to be bragging about their accomplishments.  Voices include Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Lee, and Nick Cannon.  Also providing voice talents are the instantly recognizable Kathleen Turner and the very funny duo of Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard.  The kids include Mitchel Musso, Sam Lerner, and Spencer Locke.Overall, a wonderful Halloween flick for the entire family.Highly recommended.",4,Wonderful Halloween Fun For The Entire Family,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,2849,"['Monster', 'House', 'pretty', 'scary', 'film', ""'re"", 'ages', 'five', 'ten', 'age', 'demographic', ""'d"", 'stick', 'Mickey', 'House', 'Villains', 'Pooh', 'Heffalump', 'Halloween', 'Movie', 'age', 'group', 'though', 'still', 'wonderful', 'tale', 'just', 'enough', 'creeps', 'spooks', 'keep', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'interested', 'story.It', 'out', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'triking', 'neighborhood', 'sweetly', 'saying', 'hello', 'leaves', 'fence', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'paths', 'When', 'trike', 'accidentally', 'lawn', 'creepy', 'Mr.', 'Nebbercracker', 'however', 'story', 'very', 'dark', 'turn', 'atmosphere', 'climax', 'film', 'D.J', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'house', 'diligent', 'spying', 'finally', 'answer', 'when', 'pal', 'Chowder', 'go', 'basketball', 'when', 'Nebbercracker', 'lawn.His', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'babysitter', ""n't"", 'care', 'even', 'police', 'think', 'D.J', 'nothing', 'more', 'very', 'imaginative', 'little', 'boy', 'short', 'D.J', 'Chowder', 'are', 'own', 'when', 'decide', 'get', 'bottom', 'strange', 'goings', 'old', 'house', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'friend', 'cookies', 'salesgirl', 'Jenny', 'who', 'own', 'run-in', 'house', 'Together', 'set', 'out', 'solve', 'mystery', 'home', 'owner', 'one', 'former', 'residents', 'great', 'mystery/thriller', 'far-fetched', 'adventurous', 'ending', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'whole', 'family.As', 'stated', 'children', 'five', 'may', 'find', 'flick', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'People', 'animals', 'die', 'early', 'often', 'film', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'downright', 'terrifying', 'times', 'younger', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'However', ""'re"", 'kids', 'can', 'handle', 'most', 'scares', 'films', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', 'can', 'handle', 'flick', 'Rest', 'assured', 'ending', 'important', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'credits', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'think', 'body', 'count', ""n't"", 'as', 'terrible', 'would', 'seem', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'find', 'quite', 'bit', 'heart', 'film', 'once', 'culprit', 'hauntings', 'revealed.The', 'DVD', 'wonderful', 'nice', 'selection', 'documentaries', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'are', 'obligatory', 'pats', 'back', 'crew', 'involved', 'most', 'seem', 'more', 'excited', 'be', 'allowed', 'make', 'film', 'be', 'bragging', 'accomplishments', 'Voices', 'include', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'Also', 'providing', 'voice', 'talents', 'are', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'very', 'funny', 'duo', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'Fred', 'Willard', 'kids', 'include', 'Mitchel', 'Musso', 'Sam', 'Lerner', 'Spencer', 'Locke.Overall', 'wonderful', 'Halloween', 'flick', 'entire', 'family.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Pierson,"[4, 9]","I can't tell you how much involvement the creative team behind the Back to the Future trilogy (Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis) had with their new collaboration, Monster House, but something seemed to be missing.The story follows the adventures of three kids out to battle a possessed house on Halloween.  The feel of the film resembled another Spielberg vehicle, The Goonies.  The main characters from both films appeared quite similar and at least one key scene was stolen directly from The Goonies script.I was afraid that children would be too frightened by the images and content, but the kids in the sold-out audience were having a ball.  Instead of shrieking in fear, they were laughing in most cases.  In fact, only one person shouted out, and that was an adult.Monster House is a great movie for little kids who are too young for horror movies, but too old for Winnie the Pooh.  There's nothing in the film that is any scarier than a Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean film.  The only difference is that a parent may not be as entertained with Monster House.I saw the 2D version of the film, but I understand that the 3D version is much more impressive and that the quality of the three dimension presentation is greater than a typical ""does this look 3D to you"" film.The competition in theaters is hotter than ever.

It has been done before just read a few of the other posts and you will get an idea of whether or not you want to watch this with your kids or by yourself.  For adults it wasn't scary at all.  I was looking forward to the ""big old scary movie"" that I had been warned about, however, all I watched was a boring dumb movie about a possessed unhappy house.  The house taking on its own personality is far from scary and I doubt any child would be sent to bed scared out of their minds enough to have nightmares.  Of course I am sure there are those of you who will tell me I am wrong.  The house is more comical and over-the-top than anything.  The scary scenes are taken too far, to where they are just completely unbelievable for even a child.  So I give this movie 1 STAR because it just wasn't a great movie.

In this version, her hair is blonde, although the pigtails are the same, she's not nearly as cute, and she's not chewing bubble gum. She is not even singing/humming the same melodies!

It is slightly run down and the owner is a weirdo that drives everyone away from the property.In this particular neighborhood, that house is across the street from DJ (voice of Mitchel Musso) and is owned by Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi).  He's convinced that something strange is happening there, but he can never get any adults to believe him.One day, his friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) loses his ball on the lawn.  While trying to get it back, the two friends upset Nebbercracker.  When the conflict sends Nebbercracker to the hospital, the boys think they have their chance to find out what is really happening.

I was sorry to be proved correct.The story looks like it is aimed at kids, but it really isn't.  The story features a baby sitter who has a heavy make out session with her stoner boyfriend who won't stop making out when asked, a main character who thinks he's killed an adult, and plenty of shocking and horrifying scenes.  Kids under 10 or 12 will get nightmares.  The movie should have been rated PG-13.Unfortunately, this movie doesn't work for adults, either.  The characters are very shallow and we don't really come to care for any of them.

But the animation and audio portions of MONSTER HOUSE are the best I've seen.  Watching MONSTER HOUSE was entertaining on some levels just because I knew what kind of ride I was on, and it was entertaining to see how the scriptwriters and animation people made the experience all new again.The downside of the movie is that it's really too scary for the young audience and is more in line for pre-teens or more knowledgeable toddlers.MONSTER HOUSE is a good film for family nights, providing just enough honest chills and belly-laughs to keep an audience's attention (child and adult) all the way through.

But Monster House is quite an exception.  Released by neither Dreamworks nor Disney/Pixar, this cartoon features a cast of lesser known stars in a story about a haunted house on a typical suburban street.  The house is occupied by an old grouch, Mr. Nebbercracker, who does whatever he can to keep anyone and everyone of the house and its lawn.  One Halloween, Nebbercracker has a heart attack and is wheeled away.  The house proceeds to come alive and eat everything that encroaches upon it.  DJ, who lives across the street, his friend Chowder, and the love of their lives, Jenny, decide to investigate.  They come to believe that the house is actually inhabited by the spirit of the deceased Nebbercracker.But then the story takes an unsuspected turn as Nebbercracker returns, and informs them that the house is actually inhabited by the spirit of his deceased wife, Constance, who died in a rage-induced accident during the house's construction.  This revelation comes too late, for the house comes alive in a fury, and the kids must destroy it upon the urging of Nebbercracker.  This they do, freeing Constance's spirit, and Nebbercracker's life.The story itself is quite original and interesting.  The artwork is impressive and quite realistic.  The movie itself is rated PG, but there are numerous scary scenes that I would not take anyone under 10 to watch.

1020284,AHF97M45JFCB,B000IFRT2O,ONENEO,"[3, 3]","When it comes to the current crop of computer animated feature films, some of the biggest surprises in the industry come from pretty unlikely sources.  Nope, you won't find the words Disney or Pixar anywhere on this one nor will you find DreamWorks famous kid fishing off the half-moon.  You may discover that Sony Imageworks was involved in the production, Columbia Pictures handles the distribution oh and perhaps you're familiar with the two executive producers: Steven Spielberg & Robert Zemeckis?Rest assured, this is a title that actually manages to live up to the precedent these two gentleman established back in the 1980s with a whole class of films that captured the simple joys of youth, the sense of adventure within our own imaginations and the fear and terror of those things all kids worry about but don't talk about at the school lunch table for fear of ridicule.Monster House follows the exploits of early-teen DJ who finds himself smack dab in the ugly transitional phase from boy to man when the responsibilities of being adult blend annoyingly with the rules of being a kid.DJ has developed a slight obsession with observing the goings-on across the street with old man Nebbercracker (who flips out when children trespass on his lawn) and the creaky old house in which he resides.When DJ's parents travel to a dental seminar on Halloween eve and leave DJ with a babysitter not much older than he is, he calls upon his clumsy best friend Chowder to begin investigating the phenomenon taking place a few feet away from his house. When the house nearly swallows the cute door-to-door candy salesgirl Jenny, the trio of paranormal investigators is born on the spot.Adults don't want to hear it, the police think the kids are being pranksters; the babysitter is more concerned with her boyfriend and with Halloween approaching rapidly and with it hordes of innocent trick-or-treaters, the mystery of the Monster House has to be solved before it can claim countless costumed victims just looking for some candy.I knew this one was something special right in the first lines of dialog.  The humor is spot-on! And rather than simple animate the whole film using figments of a team of animators' imaginations, Monster House uses the motion capture method of animation made famous by films like the Polar Express and Robert Zemeckis' version of the ancient legend Beowulf.The technique works here and establishes a very atypical suburbia with just enough hints of fall in the air to add to the magical feel that time of year naturally inspires.It's the acting however that elevates this film to the top tier of the modern CG animation film.  The young actors are just brilliant in their deliveries from beginning to end and couple this to a script that had a room full of adults laughing out loud nearly continually and you realize that this is no ordinary ""kid's movie"".About my only complaint about this entire film is that, as many others have noted, this really isn't ideal for younger viewers or even overly jumpy adults.  A few moments are a bit intense although never is the film graphic, overly violent, nor does it contain a single cuss.  It's simply guilty of classic-filmmaking suspense whereby what you hear and don't see on screen can be far more terrifying than even the most graphic costume, prop or computer-generated monster.And like the empire on which Steven Spielberg's empire has been built, the ending actually reveals what turns out to be a story of love and compassion at its core.In all, I came away from Monster House absolutely enamored with the plot, pacing, flow, visuals, and perhaps most of all, genuine humor.  Truly this film harkens back to a more innocent time of visual story telling and is an absolute delight to behold as a result.",5,A Modern Day Classic in Every Sense of the Term,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,3779,"['When', 'current', 'crop', 'computer', 'animated', 'feature', 'films', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'industry', 'come', 'pretty', 'unlikely', 'sources', 'Nope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'words', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'anywhere', 'one', 'will', 'find', 'DreamWorks', 'famous', 'kid', 'fishing', 'off', 'half-moon', 'may', 'discover', 'Sony', 'Imageworks', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'distribution', 'oh', 'perhaps', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'two', 'executive', 'producers', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Rest', 'assured', 'title', 'actually', 'live', 'up', 'precedent', 'two', 'gentleman', 'established', 'back', '1980s', 'whole', 'class', 'films', 'captured', 'simple', 'joys', 'youth', 'sense', 'adventure', 'own', 'imaginations', 'fear', 'terror', 'things', 'kids', 'worry', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'school', 'lunch', 'table', 'fear', 'ridicule.Monster', 'House', 'exploits', 'early-teen', 'DJ', 'who', 'smack', 'dab', 'ugly', 'transitional', 'phase', 'boy', 'man', 'when', 'responsibilities', 'being', 'adult', 'blend', 'annoyingly', 'rules', 'being', 'kid.DJ', 'developed', 'slight', 'obsession', 'observing', 'goings-on', 'street', 'old', 'man', 'Nebbercracker', 'who', 'out', 'when', 'children', 'trespass', 'lawn', 'creaky', 'old', 'house', 'DJ', 'parents', 'travel', 'dental', 'seminar', 'Halloween', 'eve', 'leave', 'DJ', 'babysitter', 'not', 'much', 'older', 'clumsy', 'best', 'friend', 'Chowder', 'begin', 'investigating', 'phenomenon', 'taking', 'place', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'house', 'When', 'house', 'nearly', 'cute', 'door-to-door', 'candy', 'salesgirl', 'Jenny', 'trio', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'born', 'spot.Adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'police', 'think', 'kids', 'are', 'being', 'pranksters', 'babysitter', 'more', 'concerned', 'boyfriend', 'Halloween', 'approaching', 'rapidly', 'innocent', 'trick-or-treaters', 'mystery', 'Monster', 'House', 'be', 'solved', 'can', 'claim', 'countless', 'costumed', 'victims', 'just', 'looking', 'candy.I', 'knew', 'one', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'right', 'first', 'lines', 'dialog', 'humor', 'spot-on', 'rather', 'simple', 'animate', 'whole', 'film', 'using', 'figments', 'team', 'animators', 'imaginations', 'Monster', 'House', 'motion', 'capture', 'method', 'animation', 'made', 'famous', 'films', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'version', 'ancient', 'legend', 'Beowulf.The', 'technique', 'here', 'very', 'atypical', 'suburbia', 'just', 'enough', 'hints', 'fall', 'air', 'add', 'magical', 'feel', 'time', 'year', 'naturally', 'inspires.It', 'acting', 'however', 'film', 'top', 'tier', 'modern', 'CG', 'animation', 'film', 'young', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'brilliant', 'deliveries', 'beginning', 'end', 'couple', 'script', 'had', 'room', 'full', 'adults', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'nearly', 'continually', 'realize', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'movie', 'only', 'complaint', 'entire', 'film', 'that', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'really', ""n't"", 'ideal', 'younger', 'viewers', 'even', 'overly', 'jumpy', 'adults', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'bit', 'intense', 'never', 'film', 'graphic', 'overly', 'violent', 'contain', 'single', 'cuss', 'simply', 'guilty', 'classic-filmmaking', 'suspense', 'whereby', 'what', 'hear', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'screen', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'terrifying', 'even', 'most', 'graphic', 'costume', 'prop', 'computer-generated', 'monster.And', 'empire', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'empire', 'been', 'built', 'ending', 'actually', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'story', 'love', 'compassion', 'core.In', 'came', 'away', 'Monster', 'House', 'absolutely', 'enamored', 'plot', 'pacing', 'flow', 'visuals', 'perhaps', 'most', 'genuine', 'humor', 'Truly', 'film', 'back', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'visual', 'story', 'telling', 'absolute', 'delight', 'behold', 'result']",N/A

The house isn't afraid of cops and sucks whole cars into it's teeth. The movie is also hysterical and the humor is clean and original.

1020298,A3AKPY4LXIC24O,B000IFRT2O,Ryan Costantino,"[59, 68]","I just saw this film today (after missing out on a sold out sneak preview last weekend) and the increased level of expectation was met with one of the most rewarding moviegoing experiences I've had in the last five years.  Monster House gives us one doozy of a spooky antagonist, a decrepit domicile of living malice that gobbles errant toys and passerby with equal ingenuity and viciousness.The house is plain old MEAN, and for really small children perhaps a little too scary to take in a gigantic room filled with strangers and darkness.  But for those of us who are too grown up for a nighlight this is perfect, creepy entertainment.The same motion capture technology used to create The Polar Express (a film which I have still yet to see) is a very interesting and appropriate choice for this film, where the only truly fantastic element is the demented house that will not suffer trespassers.  It works so well because the eerie realism that depicts the characters is so starkly contrasted with the insanity that ultimately drives the Monster House to be, well, so monstrous.Now I fully expected to be entertained by the antics of the house, but I didn't expect there to be much of a story.  Again I was pleasantly surprised by what I think is a script that I believe is just as worthy of an Oscar nomination as the script for The Incredibles was.

A tale of love, retribution, acceptance, forgiveness, and ultimately letting go.Monster House is, beyond a doubt, one of the coolest Horror movies for kids ever made.

I did not see the film in the cinema ( I did want to) however, since I have 5.1, it really delivers on that side. The sound design is clearly first class.The DVD  pack has a very neat turning wheel, which changes the scenario on the front, and on in the inside of the ( special edition?) slip case.Anyways, the DVD is a first class Package.Much of the specials are aimed at the Adults, and for me at least, are akin to revealing the tricks of the magician behind the curtain.I think that the younger ones will get little out of the commentary, waffly at times, and a commentary which either goes too much into the technical or too much into the ""Back Story""; Why did they not, for instance, talk about how liberally the direction has borrowed from Zemeckis  films?? The leaf falling down and starting the story... ripped from FOREST GUMP ?? Anyways, it's a good little start. The commentary is not exactly designed to entertain, unfortunately. But the web link to the games is VERY cool. With buddy icons, Wallpaper, and screensavers, as well as extremely fun games ( no doubt similar in some form to the ones for sale) is a great flip side for kids fun.The film is great for all ages, the rest of the extras are more adult oriented, the web links are more fun for kids, and maybe they might put some more thought into the extras.

Let's just say that their Dad is a big fan of the ""scary"" genre, and they've enjoyed some movies that a conservative parent might suggest I be committed for letting them watch. Oh, nothing too graphic...don't worry (can you say, ""Ahl be bock!"").But the first 30 minutes of Monster House are good and scary! I even had a chill or two myself. My preschooler was clutching me so tight in some parts that it left marks on my skin, and my two grade schoolers abandoned their perches to cuddle up with me. Not the type of movie that I was expecting entirely.For whatever reason, with my kids, ghosts = scary; Arnold and aliens = awesome. None of my kids are afraid of the dark. But Monster House left them a bit tentative when it was time to turn out the lights. Showing this right before bedtime was a mistake; I'm sure that their tentative disposition would have evaporated by bedtime had I shown this right after school.But if you're looking for a good ghost story of sorts, Monster House satisfies. A semi-unique spin on the haunted house tale. Good Halloween movie.While you'll hear the voice talents of the likes of Steve Buscemi, Kathleen Turner and other popular actors, it's the kids that are the stars and have the big roles in Monster House. For example, Spencer Locke voices Jenny.

The graphics aren't very good, with todays technology, you would think the people's hair would move, like in computerized cartoons, like ""Barbie and the Nutcracker"", but it doesn't. The hair on the characters are like wax, and doesn't budge, even when the blonde little girl is zooming down the sidewalk on her trike. It reminded me of the old claymation movies with stiff hair. Anyway, if you can get past that, then  it was a good kids movie. I would not recommend this movie to the lighthearted, or skiddish type of kid. It is scarey for small children. The end is happy in which the three main characters destroy the house, therefore, saving the neighborhood. I won't get into details, but this is a must see for Halloween.

1020307,A9HB18W9DAC1V,B000IFRT2O,Toby J Martin,"[0, 0]","Usually, I try to preface my reviews with a little introduction paragraph that ties into the movie, but there's only one really easy way to start this one.Monster House is the first (and only) ""horror"" kids animated film.There's a lot of subtle versions of horror cliche's in this film, toned down for the age group this film is for, and because of this, it makes for one entertaining CG movie.The film starts off with friends DJ (Mitchel Musso) and Chowder (Sam Lerner) playing a friendly game of street hoops while DJ's parents are getting ready to go away for Halloween weekend. After the parents leave, the boys take a bad shot at the hoop, and the basketball rolls across the street into the crazy neighbors yard (Nebbercracker, voiced by Steve Buscemi). Nebbercracker comes running out of the house, and starts screaming at the boys to get away, grabbing DJ and getting in his face to tell him how to behave properly. While yelling, Nebbercracker has a heart attack, and falls on top of DJ dead. The kids freak, the ambulance comes, and as the ambulance leaves, the house comes to life and starts terrorizing any kid who comes within the stretches of the property.The artistic quality of this movie is fantastic, especially when compared to the rest of the films like this that came out in 2006 along side it. Columbia Pictures did a great job in finding an animation team that kept up with Pixar and Dreamworks in that time, and even today the movie looks amazing. There's tons of little details in the scenery that catches your eyes, whether it's little details in the construction of the house, or of the characters themselves. The voice-work is all spot on as well, with Columbia once again doing an amazing job in casting the proper voice talent for the characters. Steve Buscemi's showing is perhaps the strongest (as he's a little creepy in real life), so playing a voice for a crazy old man probably wasn't a huge stretch.One of the best parts about this film, along with the amazing quality of the CG, is the fact that it's actually a creepy/horror-esque animated film. While it's definitely a children's film, there's also a lot of things that adults would laugh at, as well as some adult jokes. The scenes where they show why the house is a ""monster house"" are pretty screwed up in relation to what movies like these are usually about, so it's a nice change of pace. Just so everyone can get an idea of what kind of jokes are in this film, I present the following:(While the kids are in the house)Jenny: There![waves flashlight at chandelier]Jenny: Well, if those are the teeth, and that's the tongue, then that must be the uvula!Chowder: Oh, so it's a *girl* house...(After Nebbercracker falling on DJ)DJ: I've just... murdered a guy!Chowder: Naw... when it's an accident, it's called manslaughter.Overall this movie is a great watch for any age. There's a lot of really funny moments for any age bracket, and there's a story in it that's pretty entertaining and engrossing. I realize it sounds silly to think of a kids movie as engrossing, but the story flows nicely throughout the film, and I think due to the pacing being what it is, it really helped make this a solid showing.",4,Review,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,3198,"['Usually', 'try', 'preface', 'reviews', 'little', 'introduction', 'paragraph', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'easy', 'way', 'start', 'one.Monster', 'House', 'first', 'only', 'horror', 'kids', 'animated', 'lot', 'subtle', 'versions', 'horror', 'cliche', 'film', 'toned', 'down', 'age', 'group', 'film', 'one', 'entertaining', 'CG', 'movie.The', 'film', 'friends', 'DJ', 'Mitchel', 'Musso', 'Chowder', 'Sam', 'Lerner', 'playing', 'friendly', 'game', 'street', 'hoops', 'DJ', 'parents', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'away', 'Halloween', 'weekend', 'parents', 'leave', 'boys', 'take', 'bad', 'shot', 'hoop', 'basketball', 'street', 'crazy', 'neighbors', 'yard', 'Nebbercracker', 'voiced', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Nebbercracker', 'running', 'house', 'screaming', 'boys', 'get', 'away', 'grabbing', 'DJ', 'getting', 'face', 'tell', 'how', 'behave', 'properly', 'yelling', 'Nebbercracker', 'heart', 'attack', 'top', 'DJ', 'dead', 'kids', 'freak', 'ambulance', 'ambulance', 'house', 'life', 'terrorizing', 'kid', 'who', 'stretches', 'property.The', 'artistic', 'quality', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'rest', 'films', 'came', 'out', '2006', 'side', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'finding', 'animation', 'team', 'kept', 'up', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'time', 'even', 'today', 'movie', 'amazing', 'tons', 'little', 'details', 'scenery', 'eyes', 'little', 'details', 'construction', 'house', 'characters', 'voice-work', 'spot', 'as', 'well', 'Columbia', 'once', 'again', 'doing', 'amazing', 'job', 'casting', 'proper', 'voice', 'talent', 'characters', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'showing', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'little', 'creepy', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'playing', 'voice', 'crazy', 'old', 'man', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'stretch.One', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'amazing', 'quality', 'CG', 'fact', 'actually', 'creepy/horror-esque', 'animated', 'film', 'definitely', 'children', 'film', 'also', 'lot', 'things', 'adults', 'would', 'laugh', 'as', 'well', 'adult', 'jokes', 'scenes', 'where', 'show', 'why', 'house', 'monster', 'house', 'are', 'pretty', 'screwed', 'up', 'relation', 'what', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'about', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'Just', 'everyone', 'can', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'kind', 'jokes', 'are', 'film', 'present', 'following', 'kids', 'are', 'house', 'Jenny', '[', 'waves', 'flashlight', 'chandelier', ']', 'Jenny', 'Well', 'are', 'teeth', 'tongue', 'then', 'must', 'be', 'uvula', 'Chowder', 'Oh', '*girl*', 'house', 'Nebbercracker', 'falling', 'DJ', 'DJ', ""'ve"", 'just', 'murdered', 'guy', 'Chowder', 'Naw', 'when', 'accident', 'called', 'manslaughter.Overall', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'age', 'lot', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'age', 'bracket', 'story', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'engrossing', 'realize', 'silly', 'think', 'kids', 'movie', 'engrossing', 'story', 'nicely', 'film', 'think', 'due', 'pacing', 'being', 'what', 'really', 'helped', 'make', 'solid', 'showing']",N/A

Good news is that the movements of the characters have become more natural and smooth than that of Tom Hanks who sometimes looked like frozen in `The Polar Express.'The simple story about three kids living in suburbia and a spooky house which literally eats unheeding trespassers is effectively told in the first half of the film, where the film successfully builds up the creepy tension of the haunted house. The film is often scary, and the scare is blended with a healthy dose of humor.But from a certain point the film's story begins to look stretched, getting thinner and thinner as it goes on. The second half relies too much on the familiar action sequences of chasing and explosion, and the voice cast is not particularly impressive. Most disappointing thing for me is the three protagonists that are only stock characters. The three kids look like the shadows of Harry, Ron and HermioneThe facial expressions of the characters in `Monster House' look still weird at times, and I mean weird not in a charming or appealing way. The filmmakers still need more imagination in how to use motion capture device to create more interesting or original animation world.

1020317,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,B000IFRT2O,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[3, 5]","This review is based on the widescreen DVD version of the movie, I have not seen it in 3-D in the theater.  However, I am an aficionado of computer animated movies, so was very much looking forward to seeing this one.  Monster House is really a hybrid animated movie using a technique called motion capture to map movements made by live actors into the digital realm of the computer animated movie.  The actors actually say their lines and act out their scenes in outfits with detectable buttons glued all over them (including 72 on the face and head).  They are surrounded by cameras and the computers map their character's skin to the three dimensional space defined by the actors body.This has some good points, the first is that some of the animation is downright remarkable because of it.  A good example would be of Chowder dribbling his basketball around on DJ's driveway at the beginning of the movie.  My jaw dropped when I saw that, because no animator, no matter how good would ever get those complex motions down so perfectly.  However, it still doesn't handle faces very well.  One of the big problems in computer animation today, is that faces are extremely difficult to get right.  Even in the best animated movies, human faces appear somewhat wooden and stiff.  And even though the motion capture technology allows complex motions to be accurately animated it still falls short when it comes to faces.  Even though the actors had to get an appalling number of buttons glued to their faces every morning, it still wasn't enough to fully capture the nuances of human facial expression.  And part of the problem is that the fundamental nature of animation is it's ability to exaggerate reality, so trying to be more realistic in an animated movie in a sense conflicts with the very nature of animation.Anyway, enough of talking about the motion capture techniques, this is at its heart an animated film, and the animation of the Monster House is where this movie really shines.  The Monster House just motionless still looks evil, and when it comes to life, you really believe it's alive.  This is animation at it's finest, the house is just glorious, with it's two window shaded eyes, it's front porch-shaped lips, it's door shaped mouth, and it's entry carpeted tongue.  Even in 2D the effect of the house coming to life is overwhelming, I can't imagine how fantastic it would look in 3D.  The rapport and dialog between the actors paying the kids, Mitchell Musso as DJ, Sam Lerner as Chowder, and Spencer Locke as Jenny is excellent.  Maggie Gyllenhall as the babysitter Zee, Steve Buscemi as Nebbercracker and Jon Heder as Skull are also quite good.Some of the camera angles and shots in this film were very inventive and probably done for the 3D ""wow"" affect, but I enjoyed seeing them anyway.  Directors sometimes forget that in a computer graphic animated film the camera can be anywhere and can do anything.  There is a shot in Monster House where the camera is located exactly where DJ's head is.  The view is DJ's view of himself reflected in the back window of the ambulance.  As the ambulance pulls away the camera, as it were, stays attached to the ambulance and you see the reflection of DJ receding in the distance.  That would be an impossible shot in real life.  And I give the team that made Monster House a lot of credit for stretching the filmaking envelope in creating shots like this.All in all, this was a fun movie to watch.  The animation is totally cool, the kids are believable, the plot is interesting and has some twists and turns to keep you guessing, and the dialog is downright funny at times.  This movie really should be a Halloween classic, one of those DVD's you pull out every Halloween to scare the youngsters.
