1279371,A2V5AGMDQ7A5XM,B002N5N5PM,adamKS,"[6, 7]","finally, i have a reason again to watch tv on thursday nights. ever since the beginning of season 6, the office has been running out of steam and as much as the show ""tries"" to be funny, it just isn't anymore. it's over, and they need to wrap up the franchise this season when steve carell/michael scott leaves, but from what i've heard they are going to continue on which i believe is a BIG mistake. the writers act like they don't know where the show is going and they don't know how they want the characters to come across thus the show's characters do not act like themselves anymore and makes you ponder the question, ""would their character really say or do that""?? michael scott is having the biggest identity crisis of them all starting in season 6 to present. michael gary scott use to have substance and depth to his character and even though he was incompetent, oblivious jerk he was a likeable underdog who you want to root for because at the end of the day he is a human being struggling to find love and trying too hard to make friendships and to keep his family (coworkers) afloat in troubling times. now, his character comes across as shallow, childish, and selfish with no humility. i just don't know where the show went wrong. seasons 1-5 were/are something to be cherished because all 5 seasons are classics and are best at what television comedy has to offer. i've came to the point to where i really don't care about the characters or the show and who's dating who in the office and the messy storylines. i'm even embarrassed to say that i'm a ""fan"" of the show anymore, because frankly i am not a fan of season 6 & 7, and people don't understand when you try to explain to them that ""well, i was a huge fan in seasons 1-5 when the show and humor was still quality and the characters still acted like themselves"". so i don't even talk about the office anymore to avoid this confusion and long explanation. how sad is that? sorry for that rant but as you can tell, i'm still a little bitter about the situation.the other comedies on thursday night (30 rock, community) are really good comedies but are not ""have to watch"" shows that i want to watch religously every thursday night. i'm glad to say that parks and recreation has taken the place of the ""love"" and ""excitement"" for television comedy that i use to have for the office in seasons 1-5.i remember the season being terrific as i watched it on tv but rewatching the episodes on dvd i have realized that this season is brilliant and even rivals some of the office's best seasons. yeah, it's that good. this proves that creators/writers greg daniels and michael schurr know what their doing and can make a great comedy series. i still wonder why they stopped writing for the office? the office's quality dropped significantly at the very end of season 5 and that was the same time parks and rec started to air. it's very obvious that the office's drop in quality and direction started when greg and michael had less input into the episodes.anyways, this season is just fantastic. everything you can want in a great, hilarious, intelligent comedy: good writing, character development, interesting and surprising storylines, intelligent/quick-wit humor, and the main ingredient/key that the office is currently missing but use to strive at in previous seasons, ""heart"".not to mention, the great cast of characters and actors. amy poehler as (leslie knope) is kind of like a version of the office's michael scott but this season we find her growing more confident, competent, and her character is very likeable with lots of quirks and heart. rashida jones plays (ann perkins) who is the gorgeous, level-headed nurse who is one of the less quirky and more straight-forward characters on the show and she compliments leslie's character very well. then you have the deadpan and mustache raises of nick offerman who plays (ron swanson) and his character's greatness and abrashed honesty is equivalent to dwight schrute on the office. comedian aziz ansari plays (tom haverford) and is definitely the funniest character on the show as he brings some of his skills from his stand-up to the screen. aubrey plaza plays the apathetic and sarcastic intern (april ludgate) who reminds me of a mix between ryan howard and jim halpert from the office. then you have one of my favorite actors paul schneider playing the clever-witted, charming nice guy (mark brandanowitz) and his character is instantly relatable with lots of heart and humility. finally, you have the goofy and lovable (andy) who is played by chris pratt. he has become a regular character on the show in the second season and rightfully so. his character seems to add a lot of quirkiness to the show to help level out the seriousness and dryness of the humor. the rest of the minor characters are just OK and will say that i don't really care for the (jerry) character. also, this season we saw a lot of guest appearances including andy samberg, rob lowe, fred armistan, adam scott, justin theoraux, and the comedian Louis CK who plays the small-town, literal cop and leslie boyfriend for several episodes in the first half of the season. i thought his character was flat-out hilarious and his interactions with leslie and the camera were just brilliant and hilarious!! definitely would love to see him back on the show in the future seasons.so if you are a fan of ""the office"" (mainly earlier seasons) or the classic short-lived, genius ""arrested development"", or the family-oriented ""modern family"", then you have no reason not to watch and love this show. most say that ""modern family"" is the funniest show on tv right now. this is partially true, i think parks and recreation is tied in that category and when season 3 starts in mid january 2011, i think it has the capabilities to take the comedy reign and sit on the throne. let's just all hope that parks and recreation can keep going for at least 2 or 3 more seasons and hit that milestone of 100 episodes and that greg daniels and michael schurr stay put and keep making this one of the funniest and quality shows on television",5,Pawnee is the new Scranton. . .,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,6112,"['finally', 'i', 'have', 'reason', 'again', 'watch', 'tv', 'thursday',

1279381,A2EMCAIBSGNH0S,B002N5N5PM,BurningKerosene,"[2, 2]","I hated Parks and Recs the first few times I watched it, mostly because I compared it to The Office (which is my all-time favorite). How can you not though? They initially setup Leslie Knope as the female Michael Scott, also used the mockumentary format, and they even have a ""Toby"" with Jerry (who instead of only Michael hating him for no reason, everyone in the office hates him for no reason). Once you get past the fact that it's a different show, you start to enjoy it. In the Office, it was about a contrast of normal people to the weird office people. You laughed at how the normal people dealt with the other personalities, the awkwardness that comes with it, and you related to it because you've probably been there. Parks doesn't really have that, and that was the biggest reason I didn't find it funny at first...I kept waiting for that style of comedy, or the characters I was supposed to identify with. It's just not there, but it's funny in a different way. What Parks does have that the Office also had is great character development, interesting storylines that playout well over a whole season, and very subtle humor that you can only appreciate the more you watch.The one thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is Leslie Knope (the lead) isn't the strongest character on the show (like a lead should be). Ron, April, Tom, and Andy are all better and more consistent characters in my opinion. From the beginning, I got what those characters were about and the writers remained consistent in developing them. When I watched Leslie, i couldn't figure out if they were trying to make her to be a complete idiot or just a little strange. One episode she was strange and quirky, the next she was a total moron and acting way to similar to Michael Scott (a character that should not be recreated.) I noticed as the season went on, this got better, and they got more consistent with her. Another character I don't get is Ann...she just doesn't seem to have a purpose and nothing about her is funny or interesting to me. Plus I don't understand her relationship with Leslie. She's always looking at the camera like Leslie's a weirdo, but then talks about how much she likes her. I don't know...maybe I'll understand it more as time goes on.All and all, a good show, that while similar to The Office, is different, and has many unique traits that make it appealing.PS - I know I said Jerry is a slight ripoff of Toby, but I have to say it's one of the funniest clones ever. I just love how they all hate and make fun of him as a group for no apparent reason. It creates nice bonding moments for characters that seem to not really have that much in common aside from that. None of them ever really agree, but they all bond when it comes to mocking him.

1279384,A35AFXBYZ4WK2O,B002N5N5PM,C. D. White,"[6, 6]","The way I see it, the more 5 star reviews for this show the better. And since the DVD release date has recently been announced (Nov. 30) I thought that was a good enough reason to add a review as any.After a solid but not spectacular start in season 1, Parks & Recreation has improved by leaps and bounds in the 2nd season. Starting with ""Pawnee Zoo"" (the first episode) all the way to ""Freddy Spaghetti"" (the last episode) there hasn't been a lull in quality or a lapse in developing the various stories that this season covers. Part of what makes this show so great is that no matter how despicable, repulsive or pathetic the characters are the show's writers write stories that let you root for these characters. Whether it's Leslie Knope (a well meaning but bumbling and somewhat ineffective bureaucrat), Tom Haverford (a sleazy but harmless flirt who does very little of an actual job), Ron Swanson (an authoritarian who hates government programs but admires Leslie's spirit and effort [especially in this season]) or Ann Perkins (a good hearted nurse who through circumstance is tied to the Parks and Recreation department) all the major characters are multi-faceted who have a lot of depth and heart once you get to know them. The same is true for the  minor characters like Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle but especially April Ludgate and Andy Dwyer who also have their quirks and flaws but in this season these two characters in particular have a developing relationship that is the heart of the show. They aren't the only characters involved relationships; Leslie, Ron, Tom, Ann and Mark each have their romantic lives explored as well but more importantly each relationship covered is compelling. These aren't cliched relationships that are fodder for the show's writers meant to cheaply manipulate your emotions (or to get cheap laughs). No, these are believeable complex relationships that whether they are used for comedic purposes or not at the end of it each relationship is heart-warming/heartbreaking depending on the relationship in question. It's these relationships that ground the show.However, if that was all this show was about it would be pretty one dimensional and not worthy of being called the best show of the 20009/2010 season (which it definitely is/was). Because mixed within the heart-warming/heartbreaking moments is some absolutely hilarious stuff. Funnier than anything on TV last year. From gay pet marriages (Pawnee Zoo) to accidental shootings (Hunting Trip) among other things, this show is full of original comedic moments that will have you laughing so much it hurts. Not to mention interesting plot twists/developments in characters that will keep you guessing and smiling.Luckily after this season this show isn't finished. NBC has announced that it will be a mid-season replacement this year. However, this isn't all good news obviously. The sad fact is that P&R;'s ratings last year were abyssmal and without a marked improvement it's very likely the next season will be it's last. So if you are new to this show and curious about it I recommend you check it out not only because it was the best last year but because  I selfishly want more. If you see what I and others see in this show I urge you to tell everyone about it. This show deserves more than three seasons(and two are/will be shortened ones at that)! Because from a creative standpoint Parks And Recreation is on a roll and it would be a shame if the show's writers weren't allowed to tell the compelling stories that are currently being told right now to a fitting conclusion at least. Here's hoping all P&R; fans are enjoying season 4 in a couple of years...",5,Adding to the 5 star parade,1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,3669,"['way', 'see', 'more', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'show', 'better', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'recently', 'been', 'announced', 'Nov.', '30', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'add', 'review', 'any.After', 'solid', 'not', 'spectacular', 'start', 'season', '1', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'improved', 'leaps', 'bounds', '2nd', 'season', 'Starting', 'Pawnee', 'Zoo', 'first', 'episode', 'way', 'Freddy', 'Spaghetti', 'last', 'episode', 'there', ""n't"", 'been', 'lull', 'quality', 'lapse', 'developing', 'various', 'stories', 'season', 'Part', 'what', 'show', 'so', 'great', 'matter', 'how', 'despicable', 'repulsive', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'are', 'show', 'writers', 'write', 'stories', 'let', 'root', 'characters', 'Leslie', 'Knope', 'well', 'meaning', 'bumbling', 'somewhat', 'ineffective', 'bureaucrat', 'Tom', 'Haverford', 'sleazy', 'harmless', 'flirt', 'who', 'very', 'little', 'actual', 'job', 'Ron', 'Swanson', 'authoritarian', 'who', 'government', 'programs', 'Leslie', 'spirit', 'effort', '[', 'especially', 'season', ']', 'Ann', 'Perkins', 'good', 'hearted', 'nurse', 'who', 'circumstance', 'tied', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'department', 'major', 'characters', 'are', 'multi-faceted', 'who', 'have', 'lot', 'depth', 'heart', 'once', 'get', 'know', 'same', 'true', 'minor', 'characters', 'Jerry', 'Gergich', 'Donna', 'Meagle', 'especially', 'April', 'Ludgate', 'Andy', 'Dwyer', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'quirks', 'flaws', 'season', 'two', 'characters', 'particular', 'have', 'developing', 'relationship', 'heart', 'show', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'characters', 'involved', 'relationships', 'Leslie', 'Ron', 'Tom', 'Ann', 'Mark', 'have', 'romantic', 'lives', 'explored', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'importantly', 'relationship', 'covered', 'compelling', 'are', ""n't"", 'cliched', 'relationships', 'are', 'fodder', 'show', 'writers', 'meant', 'cheaply', 'manipulate', 'emotions', 'get', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'No', 'are', 'believeable', 'complex', 'relationships', 'are', 'used', 'comedic', 'purposes', 'not', 'end', 'relationship', 'heart-warming/heartbreaking', 'depending', 'relationship', 'question', 'relationships', 'ground', 'show.However', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'one', 'dimensional', 'not', 'worthy', 'being', 'called', 'best', 'show', '20009/2010', 'season', 'definitely', 'mixed', 'heart-warming/heartbreaking', 'moments', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'stuff', 'Funnier', 'anything', 'TV', 'last', 'year', 'gay', 'pet', 'marriages', 'Pawnee', 'Zoo', 'accidental', 'shootings', 'Hunting', 'Trip', 'other', 'things', 'show', 'full', 'original', 'comedic', 'moments', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'Not', 'mention', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists/developments', 'characters', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'smiling.Luckily', 'season', 'show', ""n't"", 'finished', 'NBC', 'announced', 'will', 'be', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'year', 'However', ""n't"", 'all', 'good', 'news', 'obviously', 'sad', 'fact', 'P', 'R', 'ratings', 'last', 'year', 'were', 'abyssmal', 'marked', 'improvement', 'very', 'likely', 'next', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'So', 'are', 'new', 'show', 'curious', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'best', 'last', 'year', 'selfishly', 'want', 'more', 'see', 'what', 'others', 'see', 'show', 'urge', 'tell', 'everyone', 'show', 'more', 'three', 'seasons', 'two', 'are/will', 'be', 'shortened', 'ones', 'creative', 'standpoint', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'roll', 'would', 'be', 'shame', 'show', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'tell', 'compelling', 'stories', 'are', 'currently', 'being', 'told', 'right', 'now', 'fitting', 'conclusion', 'least', 'Here', 'hoping', 'P', 'R', 'fans', 'are', 'enjoying', 'season', '4', 'couple', 'years']",N/A

But unlike this show's spiritual cousin - NBC's ""The Office,"" which also utilized the faux-documentary format - the humor here hasn't yet gotten stale, in large part because the writers seem to genuinely love all of their characters.  (""The Office's"" writers seem to look down on their characters.)  Sure, the writers here poke a little good natured fun at the ""Parks & Rec"" denizens, and they occasionally imbue them with over-the-top traits, but those moments usually work within the show's nominally realistic context.And though they are a sitcom ensemble, the cast always manages to imbue its characters with moments of surprising depth.  (For example, there is a moment in the final seconds of Season 2's last episode, just after a conversation between Amy Poehler and Paul Schneider, where Poehler's face registers a range of subtle emotion that is almost unthinkable for any character on ""The Office."")

Amy Poehler's character, Leslie cares so much about her job and advancing her career but her boss Ron doesn't which is hilarious. Tom Haverford is her assistant hes basically always trying to be cool and he messes with Leslie, I think Aziz does some improv as well because some of the things he says seems like stuff he would write. The beautiful Rashida Jones is also in this show her character is more of the normal one surrounded by idiots. Ron Swanson is the best his blunt, dry sarcasm and to the point of what he is trying to say makes it funny. His character doesn't really care what people think of him. Andy shines shoes at the city hall he gets in on a lot of their activities, he kind of has ADHD or something to that extend kinda says whatever he is thinking before actually thinking about saying it.

What is it with this shaky cam fetish?  Is it supposed to be cool or artsy?  How about just telling me the story of the gay penguins without all the shaky-cam stuff?  Is that too much to ask?

I""m not sure if anyone watching the episode ""Park Safety""  will be able to get past the scene (without rolling on the floor in an uncontrollable fit of laughter) where Jerry bends down during his video presentation, splits his pants open and farts. Andy Samberg guest stars.Tom Haverford experiences an epiphany of sorts, when he looks at an abstract painting and carries on, to no end; about the shapes -  absolutely hilarious in ""The Camel"". Ron Swanson having unbridled sex with his hated ex-wife, Tammy (Megan Mullally) in ""Ron And Tammy."" Andy Dwyer, the no-clue doofus, shoe-shine boy; tackling a possum, who bit the Mayor's dog on the golf range (The Possum).  Also, Ron Swanson experiencing a ""toe-gasm"" while Andy is shining one of his shoes; emitting an animal-like sound in the process (The Camel). Just a few of the insane scenes that occur in this set.Oh, and you're going to love the annoying, obnoxious, self-absorbed character of Jean-Ralphio; Tom Haverford's friend and co-investor in The Snakehole Lounge. He appears in ""The Setup,""  ""Woman Of The Year"" (outtakes are priceless) and ""The Master Plan""  The very pretty Rashida Jones plays Leslie's close friend and confidant, Ann Perkins.I don't care what anyone says - This show is funnier, and has a more versatile cast than ""The Office.""  Aziz Ansari, as Tom Haverford; is ten times funnier than Dwight or Andy from The Office. And Amy Poehler's Leslie Knope isn't an incompetent, half-wit buffoon of a boss; like Michael Scott.Boo-la!
