A death and torture cult compound was raided in the Sixties and the leaders supposedly escaped and are still at large.  This really has nothing to do with the characters in this movie (unfortunately) but it is an interest premise.The story centers on a Jock and a Nerd, on a road trip to Vagas.  They take a side trip at the behest of the Nerd to partake of an experience that is supposted to ""change"" people.  During this process, they meet a slick female with an agenda of her own.Most of the scary stuff is shown in peyote hallucinations, that seem to be influenced by some evil force.They is murder, assorted blood shed, and sex; all linked together with an overweight Mexican family.",4,Desert Weirdness!!!!,1207267200,"04 4, 2008",2008,966,"['pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'peyote', 'supernatural', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'face', 'who', ""n't"", 'main', 'idea', 'move', 'something', 'evil', 'people', 'venture', 'Zzyzx', 'Road', 'middle', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'Southern', 'California', 'death', 'torture', 'cult', 'compound', 'was', 'raided', 'Sixties', 'leaders', 'supposedly', 'escaped', 'are', 'still', 'large', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'characters', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'interest', 'premise.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Jock', 'Nerd', 'road', 'trip', 'Vagas', 'take', 'side', 'trip', 'behest', 'Nerd', 'partake', 'experience', 'supposted', 'change', 'people', 'process', 'meet', 'slick', 'female', 'agenda', 'own.Most', 'scary', 'stuff', 'shown', 'peyote', 'hallucinations', 'seem', 'be', 'influenced', 'evil', 'force.They', 'murder', 'assorted', 'blood', 'shed', 'sex', 'linked', 'together', 'overweight', 'Mexican', 'family']",Zzyzx

1057261,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000NJL4T4,P. Mann,"[19, 23]","The title may strike many as odd. Here's some background. If you drive to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, a trip of about 240 miles, you will probably take interstate 15. When you are about 98 miles from Las Vegas, you will see an exit sign for Zzyzx Road. As far as you can tell from the highway, Zzyzx Road simply crosses the highway and disappears into the desert on either side and eventually into the mountains. There are no visible businesses on the road; it just goes off into who knows what. (Actually, in one direction, it heads to a desert research center, but that's a long trip.) Now, about the movie...The film begins with a Mexican family that has stopped at the side of the highway to take a break from driving. Soon, it appears that the family has discovered a skeleton. The next thing we know, we are with Lou and Ryan, two guys on their way to Las Vegas who have apparently decided to see what lies on Zzyzx Road. (There is some mumbo-jumbo about a cult having been there at one point.) A man appears on the road, and the two hit and kill him accidentally. They put the body into the car and are about to make their escape when a woman appears wearing an ""I [heart] Manny"" T-shirt. Lou, demonstrating his sense of priorities, decides not to flee but to see what she wants because ""She's hot.""As it turns out, the woman (Robyn Cohen,The Life Aquatic,The Celestine Prophecy) is looking for her husband. Apparently, she and Manny, newlyweds from Las Vegas, decided to investigate Zzyzx, too, and now their motor home has broken down. At this point, the characters begin to act very strangely, making it clear that there is more going on here than meets the eye.""Zzyzx"" is a taut thriller with some intelligence. Only gradually does it reveal itself, sometimes through equivocal flashbacks, and the plot does not fully come together until the end of the film. I don't know that I'd call the ending a twist per se, but it is a satisfying resolution that ties up the questions that arise during the film without being obvious half an hour before the end. The actors do a solid job, and the direction is excellent. Really, it is unfortunate that film today relegates thoughtful scripts such as this one to the realm of independents films while studios remake or rip off films of the past. This is not to say that ""Zzyzx"" is the best film ever made, but it is far better than most of the big-budget junk and definitely worth a view.

1057262,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000NJL4T4,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 4]","Made on a nine day shooting schedule, ""Zzyzx"" (also known as ""Burned"") is a genuinely creepy movie made on a low budget and with very limited sets and props (in fact most of it takes place in a claustrophobic trailer.) The film opens with a statement about the mystical properties of Zzyzx Road somewhere outside of Las Vegas, claiming that the FBI uncovered an evil pair of cultists there in 1965, but they escaped to never be heard from again. Action shifts to an immigrant family taking a break near the road and making a gruesome discovery in a bit of amateur archeology that isn't resolved until the end. At first I thought it was an unfocused and unnecessary plotpoint, but its resolution was handled very nicely by director Richard Halpern, who explains that action is secondary to character in this film. He's certainly correct, and that focus was a good decision on his part.While I don't want to give away the plot development, the main characters are introduced in short order. The chief antagonist is Lou (Kenny Johnson,) an Army vet with flashbacks to the war in Iraq. I found this tidbit of background unnecessary and annoyingly formulaic.  Lou is the dominant partner in a pair of guys on their way to Vegas for a good time. His mousey sidekick, Ryan (Ryan Fox, who made me laugh out loud in the extras with his comment that ""I'm like the Brad Pitt of Albania,"")  wears an annoying headset, and generally is Lou's punching bag. Through many puzzling turns of fate and poor planning, they hit a man with their car and kill him. They decide to put the body in the back seat under a blanket, and then realize that a woman, Candice (Robyn Cohen,) has seen them and is looking for a ride. They agree to give her a ride (!) back to her camper: clearly Lou doesn't want any witnesses, and Ryan is powerless to stand up for sensibility. When they get back to the camper Lou persuades everyone to do some shrooms, and fantasy and reality get quickly and seriously mangled. When Halpern said this was a character-driven film, he wasn't kidding: all three leads are excellent in their roles, and are responsible for the positive review. The plot has several twists that are skillfully executed (and I won't spoil them,) but this is all about three people in the desert playing mental and physical games with other. The film is violent and scary, and nothing goes as anyone plans. The conclusion ties everything together nicely, and the final twist is a brilliantly done.The film is not without its flaws. Some of the audio is of very poor quality (especially early in the film,) and the use of flashbacks gets trying after a while. I understand the centrality of Ryan's headphones to the plot, but this device also wears thin. Likewise there are some gaping plot holes (e.g. with all the cellphone chatter, maybe calling the police would have been a good idea, though for different people at different times.) Some of the dialogue in the trailer is ponderous, and gives a few moments of implausibility, though in general writer Art D'Alessandro did an outstanding job with the material.""Zzyzx"" has loads of special features for a DVD in this price range (my understanding is that the DVD titled ""Burned"" does not have these, though I have not seen that pressing myself.) The commentary with Halpern and D'Alessandro is entertaining and enlightening, and added to my appreciation of the film. There are also deleted scenes and cast interviews, which vary in quality. I didn't grasp why Johnson was interviewed in the setting they chose (you'll see what I mean,) but the interview of Fox came off well and was generally hilarious.""Zzyzx"" is a very good low budget psychological thriller which is innovative from the very cool opening credits to the exceptionally twisted conclusion. If you can take the mental angst that the film dishes out (which is abundant,) this woefully unrecognized little slice of terror is a good choice.",4,A Trippy Low Budget Thriller,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,3931,"['Made', 'nine', 'day', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'Zzyzx', 'also', 'known', 'Burned', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'movie', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'very', 'limited', 'sets', 'props', 'fact', 'most', 'place', 'claustrophobic', 'trailer', 'film', 'statement', 'mystical', 'properties', 'Zzyzx', 'Road', 'somewhere', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'claiming', 'FBI', 'uncovered', 'evil', 'pair', 'cultists', 'there', '1965', 'escaped', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'Action', 'shifts', 'immigrant', 'family', 'taking', 'break', 'road', 'making', 'gruesome', 'discovery', 'bit', 'amateur', 'archeology', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'end', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'unfocused', 'unnecessary', 'plotpoint', 'resolution', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'nicely', 'director', 'Richard', 'Halpern', 'who', 'action', 'secondary', 'character', 'film', 'certainly', 'correct', 'focus', 'was', 'good', 'decision', 'part.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'development', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'short', 'order', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'Lou', 'Kenny', 'Johnson', 'Army', 'vet', 'flashbacks', 'war', 'Iraq', 'found', 'tidbit', 'background', 'unnecessary', 'annoyingly', 'formulaic', 'Lou', 'dominant', 'partner', 'pair', 'guys', 'way', 'Vegas', 'good', 'time', 'mousey', 'sidekick', 'Ryan', 'Ryan', 'Fox', 'who', 'made', 'out', 'loud', 'extras', 'comment', ""'m"", 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Albania', 'annoying', 'headset', 'generally', 'Lou', 'punching', 'bag', 'many', 'puzzling', 'turns', 'fate', 'poor', 'planning', 'hit', 'man', 'car', 'kill', 'decide', 'put', 'body', 'back', 'seat', 'blanket', 'then', 'realize', 'woman', 'Candice', 'Robyn', 'Cohen', 'seen', 'looking', 'ride', 'agree', 'give', 'ride', 'back', 'camper', 'clearly', 'Lou', ""n't"", 'want', 'witnesses', 'Ryan', 'powerless', 'stand', 'up', 'sensibility', 'When', 'get', 'back', 'camper', 'Lou', 'everyone', 'do', 'shrooms', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'get', 'quickly', 'seriously', 'mangled', 'When', 'Halpern', 'said', 'was', 'character-driven', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'are', 'responsible', 'positive', 'review', 'plot', 'several', 'twists', 'are', 'skillfully', 'executed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'three', 'people', 'desert', 'playing', 'mental', 'physical', 'games', 'other', 'film', 'violent', 'scary', 'nothing', 'anyone', 'plans', 'conclusion', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'nicely', 'final', 'twist', 'brilliantly', 'done.The', 'film', 'not', 'flaws', 'audio', 'very', 'poor', 'quality', 'especially', 'early', 'film', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'trying', 'while', 'understand', 'centrality', 'Ryan', 'headphones', 'plot', 'device', 'also', 'thin', 'Likewise', 'are', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'e.g', 'cellphone', 'chatter', 'maybe', 'calling', 'police', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'times', 'dialogue', 'trailer', 'ponderous', 'few', 'moments', 'implausibility', 'though', 'general', 'writer', 'Art', ""D'Alessandro"", 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'material', 'Zzyzx', 'loads', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'price', 'range', 'understanding', 'DVD', 'titled', 'Burned', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'pressing', 'commentary', 'Halpern', ""D'Alessandro"", 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'added', 'appreciation', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'cast', 'interviews', 'vary', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'why', 'Johnson', 'was', 'interviewed', 'setting', 'chose', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'interview', 'Fox', 'came', 'off', 'well', 'was', 'generally', 'hilarious', 'Zzyzx', 'very', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'innovative', 'very', 'cool', 'opening', 'credits', 'exceptionally', 'twisted', 'conclusion', 'can', 'take', 'mental', 'angst', 'film', 'out', 'abundant', 'woefully', 'unrecognized', 'little', 'slice', 'terror', 'good', 'choice']",Zzyzx
1057263,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B000NJL4T4,The Jaundiced Eye,"[11, 14]","I rented this DVD with no prior knowledge of its story line, primarily due to Kenny Johnson's presence, and must admit that for the first ten minutes or so, thought I had made a major mistake. The opening scenes were jerky and confusing, typical of a low-budget flick, but everything changed the moment that the Candice (played by Robyn Cohen) character appears. She exudes a sweet, innocent, natural charm that is absolutely necessary for the incredible plot twists to work.Other reviewers have commented on the irony of the claustrophobic atmosphere within the RV compared to the huge, open desert in the background. This atmosphere is as dramatic and oppressive as any I have experienced in any movie, including many with huge budgets, and it adds immeasurably to the suspense and horror of the proceedings. You are constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for the worst to happen, and (without revealing too much) it does. Indeed, I was completely duped by the plot twist. It is perfectly set up and (to me) completely unpredictable, despite the small clues that are sprinkled throughout the first hour or so. You slowly become aware that something is not right....but are not quite sure what it is. This haunting uncertaintly is a key feature in making this an above-average viewing experience.Rent, buy, borrow or steal this DVD, and after viewing the movie, be sure to listen to the director's commentary version to get a really thorough overview of what you have just witnessed, how it was accomplished, and what you probably missed.This is an excellent low-budget movie.

1057264,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000NJL4T4,trebe,"[1, 1]","Director Richard Halpern's Zzyzx (2006), is an offbeat adventure/mystery, where the tension slowly builds up to an unexpected violent conclusion.  Buddies Lou (Kenny Johnson) and Ryan (Ryan Fox) are cruising down Zzyzx Road in the Mohave Desert, when they accidentally hit a man who runs in front of their car.  Placing the body in the back seat, the pair head down the road, where they encounter a woman named Candice (Robyn Cohen).  She is looking for her husband Manny (Kayo Zepeda), who it turns out is the man that the friends just killed.  The two men take Candice back to her stranded mobile home.  Mixing drugs with beer, things start to get a little weird.  As Lou tries to figure a way out the situation, events take an unexpected and deadly turn.The omnipresent desert setting is almost like another character, in a screenplay that features just three major players.  Circumstances may lead you in one direction, but several twists and turns along the way, help make Zzyzx a pretty effective and bloody little thriller.  What happens may not be very plausible, as things seem to fall together way too smoothly, as the trio quickly gets pretty cozy.  The performances are quirky and offbeat, often with a feeling of improvisation.  Ryan Fox is frenetic and weird, and Robyn Cohen stands out for the range and intensity of her performance.  The escalation of violence is a shock, though the finish is somewhat weak.The DVD has decent set of extras, including a commentary track with director Richard Halpern and writer Art D'Alessandro, which has lots of information about this bizarre, low budget, indie production.",3,strange happenings along a deserted desert road...,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",2010,1625,"['Director', 'Richard', 'Halpern', 'Zzyzx', '2006', 'offbeat', 'adventure/mystery', 'where', 'tension', 'slowly', 'up', 'unexpected', 'violent', 'conclusion', 'Buddies', 'Lou', 'Kenny', 'Johnson', 'Ryan', 'Ryan', 'Fox', 'are', 'cruising', 'down', 'Zzyzx', 'Road', 'Mohave', 'Desert', 'when', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'front', 'car', 'Placing', 'body', 'back', 'seat', 'pair', 'head', 'road', 'where', 'encounter', 'woman', 'named', 'Candice', 'Robyn', 'Cohen', 'looking', 'husband', 'Manny', 'Kayo', 'Zepeda', 'who', 'out', 'man', 'friends', 'just', 'killed', 'two', 'men', 'take', 'Candice', 'back', 'stranded', 'mobile', 'home', 'Mixing', 'drugs', 'beer', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'little', 'weird', 'Lou', 'figure', 'way', 'situation', 'events', 'take', 'unexpected', 'deadly', 'turn.The', 'omnipresent', 'desert', 'setting', 'almost', 'character', 'screenplay', 'just', 'three', 'major', 'players', 'Circumstances', 'may', 'lead', 'one', 'direction', 'several', 'twists', 'along', 'way', 'help', 'make', 'Zzyzx', 'pretty', 'effective', 'bloody', 'little', 'thriller', 'What', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'plausible', 'things', 'seem', 'fall', 'together', 'way', 'too', 'smoothly', 'trio', 'quickly', 'pretty', 'cozy', 'performances', 'are', 'quirky', 'offbeat', 'often', 'feeling', 'improvisation', 'Ryan', 'Fox', 'frenetic', 'weird', 'Robyn', 'Cohen', 'out', 'range', 'intensity', 'performance', 'escalation', 'violence', 'shock', 'finish', 'somewhat', 'weak.The', 'DVD', 'decent', 'set', 'extras', 'including', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Richard', 'Halpern', 'writer', 'Art', ""D'Alessandro"", 'lots', 'information', 'bizarre', 'low', 'budget', 'indie', 'production']",Zzyzx
