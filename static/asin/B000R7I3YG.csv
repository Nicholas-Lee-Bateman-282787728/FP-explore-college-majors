The obvious reason for looking back on it now is to see Tom Hanks ""back in the day"" before he hit the big screen. After all, he was the only actor besides Spencer Tracy to ever win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars. Wouldn't you be curious if we had 40 or so half-hour episodes of Spence as a young man parading around in a dress in a situation comedy? I know I would. Besides Tom Hanks, the other castmembers were terrific, and most had pretty good careers. Peter Scolari (Henry Desmond) had a long run on ""Newhart"" in the 80's, Donna Dixon (Sonny Lumet) was adequate enough as Hank's love interest on the show, the late Wendy Jo Sperber (Amy Cassidy) was very good as the overweight girl who hoped against hope that Scolari's character would come to love her, and then there's the early appearance of Telma Hopkins (Isabelle Hammond) who had other comedic roles on ""Gimme A Break"" and then ""Family Matters"". Holland Taylor as Ruth Dunbar rounds out the cast as Kip and Henry's boss in the first season and partner in the second one. She's part foil and part friend to the leading duo at a time (the early 80's) before the boomers had aged to the point where they would admit that there was such a thing as a beautiful older woman, which she was.The show lost some of its appeal when the women found out that Buffy and Hildy were really Kip and Henry, but then the ruse couldn't have gone on for another entire season without the show losing even more appeal. Things were kept pretty interesting in the second season though by changing scenery - Kip and Henry buy their own ad agency - and by Kip blowing it in the worst way by cheating on Sonny. Sonny's response to finding out is not what Kip expected - she's OK with it for all the wrong reasons. It turns out she was never that sure of their relationship and she felt her lack of a reaction just proved she wasn't ready for an exclusive arrangement after all. The show lasted for only about 40 episodes, so it never really got a chance to really wear out its welcome. I'd recommend it for its inventive light comedy and all of the careers that it unexpectedly launched.",4,One of the funnier comedies of the late 70's - early 80's era,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2215,"['Sure', 'storyline', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'Hot', 'really', 'loved', 'show', 'obvious', 'reason', 'looking', 'back', 'now', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'back', 'day', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'only', 'actor', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'ever', 'win', 'back-to-back', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscars', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'curious', 'had', '40', 'so', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'Spence', 'young', 'man', 'parading', 'around', 'dress', 'situation', 'comedy', 'know', 'would', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'other', 'castmembers', 'were', 'terrific', 'most', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'careers', 'Peter', 'Scolari', 'Henry', 'Desmond', 'had', 'long', 'run', 'Newhart', '80', 'Donna', 'Dixon', 'Sonny', 'Lumet', 'was', 'adequate', 'enough', 'Hank', 'love', 'interest', 'show', 'late', 'Wendy', 'Jo', 'Sperber', 'Amy', 'Cassidy', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'overweight', 'girl', 'who', 'hoped', 'hope', 'Scolari', 'character', 'would', 'come', 'love', 'then', 'early', 'appearance', 'Telma', 'Hopkins', 'Isabelle', 'Hammond', 'who', 'had', 'other', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Gim', 'Break', 'then', 'Family', 'Matters', 'Holland', 'Taylor', 'Ruth', 'Dunbar', 'out', 'cast', 'Kip', 'Henry', 'boss', 'first', 'season', 'partner', 'second', 'one', 'part', 'foil', 'part', 'friend', 'leading', 'duo', 'time', 'early', '80', 'boomers', 'had', 'aged', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'admit', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'beautiful', 'older', 'woman', 'was.The', 'show', 'lost', 'appeal', 'when', 'women', 'found', 'out', 'Buffy', 'Hildy', 'were', 'really', 'Kip', 'Henry', 'then', 'ruse', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'gone', 'entire', 'season', 'show', 'losing', 'even', 'more', 'appeal', 'Things', 'were', 'kept', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'second', 'season', 'changing', 'scenery', 'Kip', 'Henry', 'buy', 'own', 'ad', 'agency', 'Kip', 'blowing', 'worst', 'way', 'cheating', 'Sonny', 'Sonny', 'response', 'finding', 'out', 'not', 'what', 'Kip', 'expected', 'OK', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'out', 'was', 'never', 'sure', 'relationship', 'felt', 'lack', 'reaction', 'just', 'proved', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'exclusive', 'arrangement', 'show', 'lasted', 'only', '40', 'episodes', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'chance', 'really', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'inventive', 'light', 'comedy', 'careers', 'unexpectedly', 'launched']",Bosom Buddies - The Complete Series

The kooky cast included their snarky ad exec boss RUTH DUNBAR (HOLLAND TAYLOR), statuesque blonde/object of KIP's affections SONNY, played by DONNA DIXON, sassy former TONY ORLANDO & DAWN singer TELMA HOPKINS as ISABELLE and the wonderful WENDY JO SPERBER as plus-sized, HENRY-hungry AMY CASSIDY. Forced to assume their sibling alter egos BUFFY and HILDEGARD in order to live in the Susan B. Anthony hotel for women, KIP and HENRY were like LAVERNE & SHIRLEY and LENNY & SQUIGGY all rolled up into one. Reveling in endless pop culture references, groan-worthy puns, inevitable wardrobe malfunctions and genuinely funny slapstick on behalf of the two immensely likable stars, BOSOM BUDDIES virtually defined ""must-see TV"" in the early eighties.RATING: FOUR ""WHO IS IT?""'S",4,WHAT A DRAG!,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,1046,"['BOSOM', 'BUDDIES', 'Woefully', 'short', 'lived', 'only', '37', 'episodes', 'underappreciated', 'fast', 'paced', 'sitcom', 'starred', 'future', 'film', 'superstar', 'TOM', 'HANKS', 'future', 'NEWHART', 'regular', 'PETER', 'SCOLARI', 'who', 'played', 'KIP', 'WILSON', 'HENRY', 'DESMOND', 'Mutt', 'Jeff', 'team', 'highest', 'comedic', 'order', 'kooky', 'cast', 'included', 'snarky', 'ad', 'exec', 'RUTH', 'DUNBAR', 'HOLLAND', 'TAYLOR', 'statuesque', 'blonde/object', 'KIP', 'affections', 'SONNY', 'played', 'DONNA', 'DIXON', 'sassy', 'former', 'TONY', 'ORLANDO', 'DAWN', 'singer', 'TELMA', 'HOPKINS', 'ISABELLE', 'wonderful', 'WENDY', 'JO', 'SPERBER', 'plus-sized', 'HENRY-hungry', 'AMY', 'CASSIDY', 'Forced', 'assume', 'sibling', 'alter', 'egos', 'BUFFY', 'HILDEGARD', 'order', 'live', 'Susan', 'B.', 'Anthony', 'hotel', 'women', 'KIP', 'HENRY', 'were', 'LAVERNE', 'SHIRLEY', 'LENNY', 'SQUIGGY', 'rolled', 'up', 'one', 'Reveling', 'endless', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'groan-worthy', 'puns', 'inevitable', 'wardrobe', 'malfunctions', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'behalf', 'two', 'immensely', 'likable', 'stars', 'BOSOM', 'BUDDIES', 'virtually', 'defined', 'must-see', 'TV', 'early', 'eighties.RATING', 'FOUR', 'WHO', 'IT']",Bosom Buddies - The Complete Series
