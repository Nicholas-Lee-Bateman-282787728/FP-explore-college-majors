1696548,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00JDCOI54,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","This thriller makes it clear very early that there is a homicidal maniac present in the area where the estranged brother of Sung-soo lives. The building is a shabby place with many unoccupied apartments and is so run down that it is scheduled for demolition in the immediate future. There are repeated hints that Sung-soo falsely accused his brother of a major crime (this is not completely explained) and that his brother suffers from mental illness. Sung-soo has a beautiful wife, a nice home, two children, and some significant wealth, as well as some delusional problems of his own.As the movie progresses, several people are introduced and for the first hour, all significant hints point strongly in one direction and implicitly in another. Approximately an hour into the movie the true killer is revealed and then it becomes a battle between the evil force and the innocents. At this point the movie has become an action/terror film where the battle between the protagonists is to the death, with one side getting the upper hand and then having their relative positions flipped.It is an old adage that sometimes the best hiding place is in plain sight and that applies here. The villain is a strong one that you will immediately hate, once you are aware that they are in fact the villain. You will be kept on the edge of your seat as the person acting out the villain really plays the part of the homicidal maniac very well. There is a subtle clue as to the identity of the villain early on but it is most unlikely that you will spot it until you see the entire movie and then go back and look at some of the scenes again.",5,A mystery followed by an extended battle to the death with a homicidal maniac,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,1628,"['thriller', 'clear', 'very', 'early', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'present', 'area', 'where', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Sung-soo', 'lives', 'building', 'shabby', 'place', 'many', 'unoccupied', 'apartments', 'so', 'run', 'down', 'scheduled', 'demolition', 'immediate', 'future', 'are', 'repeated', 'hints', 'Sung-soo', 'falsely', 'accused', 'brother', 'major', 'crime', 'not', 'completely', 'explained', 'brother', 'suffers', 'mental', 'illness', 'Sung-soo', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'nice', 'home', 'two', 'children', 'significant', 'wealth', 'as', 'well', 'delusional', 'problems', 'own.As', 'movie', 'several', 'people', 'are', 'introduced', 'first', 'hour', 'significant', 'hints', 'point', 'strongly', 'one', 'direction', 'implicitly', 'Approximately', 'hour', 'movie', 'true', 'killer', 'revealed', 'then', 'battle', 'evil', 'force', 'innocents', 'point', 'movie', 'become', 'action/terror', 'film', 'where', 'battle', 'protagonists', 'death', 'one', 'side', 'getting', 'upper', 'hand', 'then', 'having', 'relative', 'positions', 'flipped.It', 'old', 'adage', 'best', 'hiding', 'place', 'plain', 'sight', 'applies', 'here', 'villain', 'strong', 'one', 'will', 'immediately', 'hate', 'once', 'are', 'aware', 'are', 'fact', 'villain', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'person', 'acting', 'out', 'villain', 'really', 'part', 'homicidal', 'maniac', 'very', 'well', 'subtle', 'clue', 'identity', 'villain', 'early', 'most', 'unlikely', 'will', 'spot', 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'scenes', 'again']",N/A

It is a well-sculpted movie and surprisingly is more understated than the usual fare from these films.Seong-soo (Hyeon-ju Son), a successful businessman who lives with the perfect family in a luxury apartment, has secrets and mysophobia (pathological fear of contamination and germs) about his one and only brother. One day, he goes to see his brother after a phone call about him being missing and sees weird symbols all over the house and he meets Joo-hee (Jung-Hee Moon) who knows his brother. ""Please tell him to stop looking at my daughter. Joo-hee lives alone with her daughter but lives in fear of someone watching them. Seong-soo looks around carefully at the old apartment and realizes the symbols mean gender and numbers of people.

1696550,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B00JDCOI54,John D. Cofield,"[1, 1]","This Korean film with English subtitles seems specially designed to push our buttons by hitting established horror film themes: the creepy house or apartment; the mysterious stranger; the inexplicable slide from normality to brutal menace. Beyond that, however, Hide and Seek has a special menace, partly because it is set in a foreign land, and partly because the premise seems so weirdly possible.The main protagonist is Sung-soo, a comfortable middle class executive with a lovely wife and two small children.  He has a spacious apartment and a nice car but apparently suffers from a mild obsessive compulsive disorder, which is controlled with medication and plenty of patience.  Unfortunately, Sung-soo has an adopted brother who has much more serious problems.  When he gets a phone call from his brother's landlord reporting him missing, Sung-soo goes to the apartment complex looking for more information.  There he finds far more questions than answers, and he begins his own descent into darkness. What happens in the end is somewhat equivocal, and in true horror film fashion we are left with questions as to what, precisely, has been going on.This is a gritty film set in one of the most unpleasant slum areas that can be imagined.  In keeping with the established rules of the genre the over all mood is dark and brooding.  Still, Hide and Seek is an intriguing film which pursues fear and horror through inference and suggestion rather than violence.",4,Extraordinarily Creepy,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1464,"['Korean', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'specially', 'designed', 'push', 'buttons', 'hitting', 'established', 'horror', 'film', 'themes', 'creepy', 'house', 'apartment', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'inexplicable', 'slide', 'normality', 'brutal', 'menace', 'Beyond', 'however', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'special', 'menace', 'partly', 'set', 'foreign', 'land', 'partly', 'premise', 'so', 'weirdly', 'possible.The', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Sung-soo', 'comfortable', 'middle', 'class', 'executive', 'lovely', 'wife', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'spacious', 'apartment', 'nice', 'car', 'apparently', 'suffers', 'mild', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'controlled', 'medication', 'plenty', 'patience', 'Unfortunately', 'Sung-soo', 'adopted', 'brother', 'who', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'problems', 'When', 'phone', 'call', 'brother', 'landlord', 'reporting', 'missing', 'Sung-soo', 'apartment', 'complex', 'looking', 'more', 'information', 'far', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'own', 'descent', 'darkness', 'What', 'end', 'somewhat', 'equivocal', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'fashion', 'are', 'left', 'questions', 'what', 'precisely', 'been', 'going', 'on.This', 'gritty', 'film', 'set', 'one', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'slum', 'areas', 'can', 'be', 'imagined', 'keeping', 'established', 'rules', 'genre', 'mood', 'dark', 'brooding', 'Still', 'Hide', 'Seek', 'intriguing', 'film', 'fear', 'horror', 'inference', 'suggestion', 'rather', 'violence']",N/A
1696551,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00JDCOI54,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[2, 2]","The South Korean hit ""Hide and Seek"" is a remarkably effective first time feature by writer/director Huh Jung.  In the realm of International cinema, South Korea continues to provide some of the grittiest and most unpleasant thrillers imaginable.  While this might sound like dubious praise, I mean it as the highest compliment.  So many films from the American studio system fail to take significant chances and, therefore, leave me rather uninspired.  I like when a thriller (or any film, for that matter), isn't afraid to push buttons and take you to the edge of reason.  Among some of my favorites from South Korea, I'd include Oldboy, The Chaser, and I Saw The Devil, but I could list dozens of recent imports similarly worth your time and effort (I'm also an absolute nut for the comedy/horror monster mash-up The Host, but that's another genre entirely).  While I don't necessarily feel that ""Hide and Seek"" is a new classic at the level of these examples, it does provide the requisite chills to make it worthy of viewing.  It starts as a supremely creepy mystery, but then morphs into a rather preposterous (but well done) battle for survival.  It isn't the most original plot, to be sure, but the genuine dread and uncertainty conveyed in the film's first half sets a really strong tone.The movie narration begins with a nod to an urban legend where certain city dwellers secretly inhabit the homes of other families, existing completely in the shadows of normal society.  From this, we witness a rather brutal attack in a semi-abandoned apartment complex.  The opening is both unsettling and well executed, and we're left off-guard as the primary story starts to unfold.  We meet family man Sung-Soo, his lovely wife from America, and their two children.  Sung-Soo is a rather fastidious fellow who seems haunted by dreams of an era gone by and familial secrets that weigh heavily on his psyche.  When he receives word that his long lost adopted brother has gone missing, it sets a series of events in motion that can't be undone.  It seems that his brother lived in the complex where we first witnessed the attack.  And when Sung-Soo and his reluctant family pay that decrepit complex a visit, it opens up all sorts of questions.  Sung-Soo's wife, for example, never even had an idea that a sibling existed!Is the brother really missing?  In danger?  Or perhaps the perpetrator of great evil?  And is the mystery tied to Sung-Soo's troubled past?  I quite enjoyed the enigmatic set-up of ""Hide and Seek"" and really looked forward to the answers to these questions.  Whatever is happening at this residence (mysterious marks at every door map out the inhabitants) follows Sung-Soo back to his more upscale apartment.  And what begins as a supremely clever puzzler soon finds itself on more pedestrian territory.  The final answers aren't as satisfying as I might have hoped, but the narrative picks up a non-stop momentum that has everyone battling for their very survival.  In the end, Huh Jung demonstrates a lot of finesse as a director.  He generates considerable expense by taking his time setting the final act in motion.  ""Hide and Seek"" is a successful example of psychological terror as paranoia and uncertainty pull the central family apart at the seams.  The actors do very well in helping to establish this tone.  In the end, I didn't think the resolution was a strong as the set-up but I still found a number of genuine thrills in ""Hide and Seek.""

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","The prologue of &#34;Sum-bakk-og-jil&#34; (&#34;Hide and Seek&#34;) offers a woman who is creeped out by the guy who lives next door in their squalid little apartment complex, especially since he has showed up wearing a motorcycle helmet that makes him an ominous figure in black.  As is usually the case in horror movie prologues, the woman is dead by the time we get to the title of the movie, but then we are treated to a voice over by a young girl who says, &#34;There's a weird rumor going around in my neighborhood.  It's about squatters hiding in others people's homes and secretly living there.&#34;  That seems to run counter to what we have just seen, but we know that by the time the credits role this 2013 South Korean film from writer-director Huh Jung is going to connect the dots, because this one plays up the mystery element way more than most horror films.When we get to the main part of the film we are introduced to Sung-soo (Son Hyun-joo), a successful businessman who lives with his wife Min-ji (Jeon Mi-seon) and their son and daughter in a luxury apartment.  There are some odd people in the neighborhood, some of whom are uncomfortably interested in Sung-soo's children, but then he gets a strange phone call telling him his brother is missing.  It turns out Sung-soo is estranged from his brother and we have another dot to connect.  Then there is Joo-hee (Moon Jung-hee) and her daughter Pyeong-hwa (Kim Ji-yeong), who are worried that his missing brother has been watching them.  Then there are all those weird symbols carved by the doors in the apartment building.  This is not going to be a simple slasher flick.Apparently this was an unexpected hit in South Korean, a low-budget film that topped the box office, more on the strength of the mystery element than the horror.  This is very much an atmospheric film, relatively sparse on the dialogue and making ample use of Jo Yeong-wook's score (which clearly samples Massive Attack's &#34;Angel&#34; at times).  Huh Jung also likes to have characters on their cell phones when one of them is in danger while the other has to listen helplessly.  &#34;Sum-bakk-og-jil&#34; creeps you out a couple of times and the payoff comes way more in terms of the revelation of who than in terms of blood or gore.  Huh Jung even goes back and shows us what we had missed from a key scene early on, once we know who is the villain.Sung-soo is a rather bland hero, with a limited emotional range, neither too scared or too angry at any point , although when we find out the why and wherefore for his estrangement from his brother, you have to stop and rethink everything in light of that new information.  That being said, the three actresses listed above provide the most interesting performances, with Kim Ji-Yeong doing her level best to enter the pantheon of creepy kids.  Sung-soo's kids come across as actually normal kids, but they also have some nice moments of being terrified when things go from bad to worse and a step beyond.&#34;Sum-bakk-og-jil&#34; stands in marked contrast to all those Japanese ghost story horror movies that have made their way across the Pacific to our shores.  It took me a while to key in that this was more of a mystery than a horror movie, so I think that will make a difference to your enjoyment of the movie if you are thinking more along those lines from the start.  My only real complaint is that this is another movie where the good guys keep making the mistakes of letting their children out of their sight and, even more objectionable, of trying to take out the bad guys with a single blow.  That never works.

It was one of the highest grossing film in South Korea in 2013.Okay, I admit it - I love a good scary movie. Sometimes I love it from behind a pillow but still...Hide and Seek opens with mysterious person in a motorcycle helmet, simply standing and staring. This person appears throughout the film. I gotta tell you, that inaction is just as frightening as overt violence - it's the anticipation that something might happen that builds tension.Our main character is Sung-soo. He has a beautiful wife and children, gorgeous home and plenty of 'things'. But he's also unsettled, suffering from insomnia and OCD. When he gets word that his estranged brother has gone missing, he goes to his apartment. And sets off a chain of events with that visit. Those symbols he sees by the doorbells of his brother's building? They're now appearing in his own building...What great settings there were in this movie. The brother's apartment is in an industrial, crowded and ready to be demolished building. In contrast, Sung-soo lives in a luxurious, clean building with security. (I just have to mention that I've never seen a cleaner, brighter parking garage.)Hide and Seek starts off with many lovely, creepy scenes, setting the tone. Outright violence is only introduced in the last half hour of the film. And even then, it's not over the top or gratuitous.The acting, although a little overdone in places was good, with the villain being played particularly well. (don't want to provide spoilers) And as in any good thriller, there are those...&#34;Why would you.... go back in, don't turn your back, leave the children alone...moments.In watching the interviews with the director and actors, I learned that the premise for this film had its' roots in reality.
