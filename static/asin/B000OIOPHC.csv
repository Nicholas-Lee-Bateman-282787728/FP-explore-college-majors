1064491,A1283U3MDPV7B4,B000OIOPHC,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I have all eight seasons on DVD. I was only a little disappointed with the lack of extras on this last DVD. I was hoping for more. (I also own all of Buffy and Angel and they have a lot of extras). WARNING: DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE EASTER EGGS ARE!!! I did find all three eggs. It was fun searching for them. Here they are...On the Season 8; Disc 6 DVD there are three easter eggs. #1: On the Main Menu, from the words 'Bonus Features' hit the down arrow, there should appear a purple triquatra on Phoebe's arm. Press play. #2: In the Episode Selection section, from the words 'Main Menu' hit the left button, there should appear a purple triquatra on Phoebe's arm. Press Play. #3: In the Bonus Features section, from the words 'Main Menu', hit the left button, there should appear a purple triquatra on Billie's wrist. Press Play.I did like the way the story wrapped up at the end. I did not get to watch this show when it originally aired on T.V. (long story). So I was only, finally, able to get caught up when I sat down this week and watched the DVDs. By the end, I was bawling like a baby. There are lots of things I hated about season 8, but after listening to the commentaries on the episodes that had them, some of the things I hated made sense.I don't ever think we will have more shows like Buffy and Charmed, with strong positive female roles models, that aren't cookie cutter-cheerleader-straightlaced-tight wad robots. And that is what made these shows good. Even though the Sisters wanted a regular life, it was always on their terms, not on the terms or ideals of what someone else thought was right. And they were always willing to fight for who and what they loved. I don't see anything on T.V. currently filling that void, for all the females out there. (and don't say Desperate Housewives, yuck, suburbia). The Sisters were strong in spirit and body. They were also just odd enough, that those of us out here who are just a little odd could relate. That is a big part of what made this show a huge success, (same with Buffy), the oddballs felt like maybe they had someone to relate to finally. And those of us that believe in alternative faiths had a show that had some references to them.But the thing that saddens me the most, is that the talks of spin-offs didn't go anywhere. It would have been wonderful to see Drew Fuller and Wes Ramsey do a spin-off that showed the boys taking over the fight. These two finally got to interact in a positive way in that last episode and looked like they would have made a great pair for their own show. That would have at least kept some part of the Charmed Ones around for a while longer.Oh Well, maybe some day in the future there will be movies or something to ease the pain of losing friends that feel almost like sisters.IN THE MEANTIME, I CAN ALWAYS PLAY THE DVDS.",5,"Charmed, gone but not forgotten!",1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,2865,"['have', 'eight', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'extras', 'last', 'DVD', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'also', 'own', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'have', 'lot', 'extras', 'WARNING', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'READ', 'ANY', 'FURTHER', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WANT', 'TO', 'KNOW', 'WHERE', 'THE', 'EASTER', 'EGGS', 'ARE', 'did', 'find', 'three', 'eggs', 'was', 'fun', 'searching', 'Here', 'are', 'Season', '8', 'Disc', '6', 'DVD', 'are', 'three', 'easter', 'eggs', '1', 'Main', 'Menu', 'words', 'Features', 'hit', 'down', 'arrow', 'should', 'appear', 'purple', 'triquatra', 'Phoebe', 'arm', 'Press', 'play', '2', 'Episode', 'Selection', 'section', 'words', 'Menu', 'hit', 'left', 'button', 'should', 'appear', 'purple', 'triquatra', 'Phoebe', 'arm', 'Press', 'Play', '3', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'section', 'words', 'Menu', 'hit', 'left', 'button', 'should', 'appear', 'purple', 'triquatra', 'Billie', 'wrist', 'Press', 'Play.I', 'did', 'way', 'story', 'wrapped', 'up', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'T.V', 'long', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'finally', 'able', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'week', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'end', 'was', 'bawling', 'baby', 'are', 'lots', 'things', 'hated', 'season', '8', 'listening', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'had', 'things', 'hated', 'made', 'sense.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'shows', 'Buffy', 'Charmed', 'strong', 'positive', 'female', 'roles', 'models', 'are', ""n't"", 'cookie', 'cutter-cheerleader-straightlaced-tight', 'wad', 'robots', 'what', 'made', 'shows', 'good', 'Even', 'Sisters', 'wanted', 'regular', 'life', 'was', 'always', 'terms', 'not', 'terms', 'ideals', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'were', 'always', 'willing', 'fight', 'who', 'what', 'loved', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'T.V', 'currently', 'filling', 'void', 'females', 'out', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'yuck', 'suburbia', 'Sisters', 'were', 'strong', 'spirit', 'body', 'were', 'also', 'just', 'odd', 'enough', 'here', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'little', 'odd', 'could', 'relate', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'huge', 'success', 'same', 'Buffy', 'oddballs', 'felt', 'maybe', 'had', 'someone', 'relate', 'finally', 'believe', 'alternative', 'faiths', 'had', 'show', 'had', 'references', 'them.But', 'thing', 'most', 'talks', 'spin-offs', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'Wes', 'Ramsey', 'do', 'spin-off', 'showed', 'boys', 'taking', 'fight', 'two', 'finally', 'got', 'interact', 'positive', 'way', 'last', 'episode', 'looked', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'pair', 'own', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'kept', 'part', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'while', 'longer.Oh', 'Well', 'maybe', 'day', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'movies', 'something', 'ease', 'pain', 'losing', 'friends', 'feel', 'almost', 'sisters.IN', 'MEANTIME', 'CAN', 'ALWAYS', 'PLAY', 'DVDS']",Charmed: The Final Season

1064494,A20F0VHBQ48NFF,B000OIOPHC,Andromeda,"[10, 15]","Worse season of Charmed and even more tragic since it was the last season and it all comes down to two people Billie and Christy. I don't care about them I don't want to care about them I have not spent seven years watching Charmed to watch sisters who were not the Halliwells. I hated every moment that was filled with Billie and Christy and not Piper, Phoebe and Paige. I hated all of the time it took away from Piper, Phoebe and Paige's storylines.I liked the sisters trying to lead normal lives with the world thinking they were died. There were a couple very interesting stories from Paige's difficulty to find a life outside magic or Piper's new look being exactly like a woman wanted for murder. I also liked how they came to decide to take their lives back it was very good.I didn't like the enemy being the Tirade which we all know Cole vanquished in season three. Did they really expect us to believe there just happened to be another tirade out there? There was no way I was going to believe that.I also found it Phoebe's marriage to Coop and Paige's to Henry to be too forced. I didn't feel any of the love or chemistry that I did when Piper married Leo. Neither men were particularly interesting or had much of a personality.I liked the seeing Grams again this season and Patty, Chris and almost the entire Hallwell family in Forever Charmed.  I also liked  when we got to see the sisters going on with their lives, their children, Old Piper and Old Leo and their granddaughter. It was very nice to see how their lives turned out and I liked how they showed it to use with each sister writing the Book of Shadows and narriating their lives. The pictures on the walls replaced with all new family pictures.

I watched this when it originally aired on TV 6 years ago, and then one more time now, and I can honestly say that the next time I rewatch the series, I'm ending it on the season 7 finale, which is by far the more superior ender to the series.There isn't a bad word to be said about Holly Marie Combs, who once again is the shining actress on the show who constantly performs, even with crappy scripts and ludicrous plot twists.

I still consider myself a huge fan, but for me the show really ended when Shannen Doherty departed. Yes I am a HUGE Shannen Doherty fan but her leaving wasn't the only reason I stopped watching this show. Yes that was part of it, because I never stopped missing Prue, and her absence was always noticeable in the episodes, but I did actually enjoy season four, and even warmed up to Rose Mcgowans character ""Paige"" I was quite happy that they chose to make a new sister instead of just choosing a new actress to play Prue. And the season four episodes were actually quite good and well done.But then in season 5 they just started getting extremely lame and I stopped watching the show. Every once in a while I would tune in to an episode just out of curiousity, if only to see what the Halliwells were up to, but every episode was a disappointment.Which brings me to this season...season 8. I've probably seen a total of 2 episodes from this season, so it may seem unfair of me to be reviewing it...but seriously, this is Charmed at its worst. Just from seeing a few episodes, it felt as if it was an entirely different show.I didn't follow this season while it was still airing, but did decide to tune into the series finale, and was HUGELY disappointed. Granted, I obviously knew that there was no chance of Shannen Doherty making a guest appearance, but I still feel that they could have given more of a tribute to her character Prue. Its true that it may seem that Paige was a bigger part of the show, seeing as how Rose Mcgowan was part of the show for 5 seasons, while Shannen was only on for 3 seasons, but still. Prue was part of the orginal power of 3, so I feel her character should have been given more credit.And aside from that, the series finale just wasn't good. I've imagined a million different ways that the show could have ended, and each idea was way better than what the actual result was.If you've never seen this show, please do not base your opinion on this season, or any of the later seasons, as I feel that they don't do the show justice. Atleast start with season one, and go from there.I'd only advise you to buy this season if you are a die-hard Charmed fan, and feel the need to have the entire series on DVD.As for me, I will settle for having the first four seasons on DVD, and to occassionally tuning into the re-runs of the later seasons on TNT.",1,the shannen doherty seasons were the best,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2515,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Charmed', 'began', 'watching', 'mid-season', 'two', 'faithfully', 'followed', 'show', 'mid-season', 'five', 'still', 'consider', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'really', 'ended', 'when', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'departed', 'Yes', 'am', 'HUGE', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'fan', 'leaving', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'reason', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'Yes', 'was', 'part', 'never', 'stopped', 'missing', 'Prue', 'absence', 'was', 'always', 'noticeable', 'episodes', 'did', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'season', 'four', 'even', 'warmed', 'up', 'Rose', 'Mcgowans', 'character', 'Paige', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'chose', 'make', 'new', 'sister', 'instead', 'just', 'choosing', 'new', 'actress', 'play', 'Prue', 'season', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'well', 'done.But', 'then', 'season', '5', 'just', 'started', 'getting', 'extremely', 'lame', 'stopped', 'watching', 'show', 'once', 'while', 'would', 'tune', 'episode', 'just', 'curiousity', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'Halliwells', 'were', 'up', 'episode', 'was', 'disappointment.Which', 'season', 'season', '8', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'total', '2', 'episodes', 'season', 'may', 'seem', 'unfair', 'be', 'reviewing', 'seriously', 'Charmed', 'worst', 'Just', 'seeing', 'few', 'episodes', 'felt', 'was', 'entirely', 'different', 'show.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'airing', 'did', 'decide', 'tune', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'HUGELY', 'disappointed', 'Granted', 'obviously', 'knew', 'was', 'chance', 'Shannen', 'Doherty', 'making', 'guest', 'appearance', 'still', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'more', 'tribute', 'character', 'Prue', 'true', 'may', 'seem', 'Paige', 'was', 'bigger', 'part', 'show', 'seeing', 'how', 'Rose', 'Mcgowan', 'was', 'part', 'show', '5', 'seasons', 'Shannen', 'was', 'only', '3', 'seasons', 'still', 'Prue', 'was', 'part', 'orginal', 'power', '3', 'so', 'feel', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'credit.And', 'aside', 'series', 'finale', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', ""'ve"", 'imagined', 'million', 'different', 'ways', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'idea', 'was', 'way', 'better', 'what', 'actual', 'result', 'was.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'base', 'opinion', 'season', 'later', 'seasons', 'feel', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'show', 'justice', 'Atleast', 'start', 'season', 'one', 'go', 'there.I', ""'d"", 'only', 'advise', 'buy', 'season', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Charmed', 'fan', 'feel', 'need', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD.As', 'will', 'settle', 'having', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'occassionally', 'tuning', 're-runs', 'later', 'seasons', 'TNT']",Charmed: The Final Season

First of all, budget cuts that resulted in less use of the sister's magical powers.  I would have loved to have seen Phoebe get all her active powers back (I guess you just have to assume she does).  The second victim of budget cuts was Brian Krause (who was axed from episodes 11-20); this was a huge mistake.  My third gripe: the Triad/Kristy/Billie thing.  I do like that Billie and Kristy were the big bad (and that the Triad plucked Kristy so they could turn them to their side).  Why did the Triad look different in season eight (more human) than in season three?  Was there not enough in the budget for the make-up?  Also, Paige's wedding was totally overlooked.  If they were going to resurrect Sam at all, it should have been in that episode.Having said all that, the writing this season was top-notch.  The sisterly bond was tested as Phoebe and Paige moved out of the Manor (again).  Piper struggled as a single parent.  Each sister struggled with their careers.  I feel that Alyssa, Holly Marie, and Rose performed above and beyond in this final season.  The character of Billie was often a tad annoying, and entirely too much screen time was given to her whining.

The show brought back all the favorites and gave fans some closure by showing us the future world of the Charmed ones. There characters were so well portrayed by the actresses (Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano) that they made the characters their own, gave them identifiable funny quirks and great personalities.The eight season does not disappoint. With the addition of a new character. At the end ofCharmed - The Complete Seventh Season, the Charmed ones faked their death. Now they must deal with the guilt of not fighting s well as with the responsibility of training a new witch, Billie (played by Kaley Cuoco), who is also Paige's new charge. The season progresses as the Charmed ones reveal they are alive, deal with the repercussions of faking their deaths and settle their personal and work lives.Although I don't think that the ""Ultimate Power"" was very convincing (they did fight the source of all evil!!!! how can 2 girls and an already defeated Triad win over them?!), the plot was pretty well developed.The character of Billie is very interesting. She may be a combination of many characters all rolled into one. She shares Prue's power of telekinesis (and possibly a variation of Prue's astral projection), and Wyatt's power of projection. She is pretty powerful indeed. Yet, she is a bit gullible and believed her sister Christy when she accused the Charmed ones.

However, I felt the show went downhill a bit, particularly after season six. Season seven was a decent season, especially with Charisma Carpenter guest-starring. But season eight?? Completely unnecessary!Season eight introduces Billie Jenkins, a blonde, young witch who the Charmed Ones take under their wing. I liked Billie a bit but when her sister, Christy was introduced, my hatred for both of them soared. Why would some long-lost sister be able to persuade Billie to kill the Charmed Ones? Unless Billie is some gullable twit with no mind of her own, which she was.Anyway, season eight had no real direction except bringing Leo back after defeating the Ultimate Power (Brian Krause was cut for financial reasons). That's another thing. Are we, the audience, really supposed to believe some new witch (Billie) is the Ultimate Power? Highly unlikely.The series finale was the only saving grace. It felt rushed but was still 'good.' Actually, I only liked the ending. Billie crying was not something I wanted to see.Overall, a useless season of ""Charmed.""

1064536,A1PNH6WOANE0SD,B000OIOPHC,"S. Christensen ""reveuse""","[3, 3]","While I love Charmed, Season 8 wasn't exactly a highlight of the show for me.By the time Season 8 comes around, the Halliwell sisters have outright abandoned their identities and their magical role. As far as Piper, Phoebe and Paige are concerned, they've done their time policing the magical world and that hasn't changed, even as they come to realize that their old lives weren't all that bad and take back their identities. Enter Billie Jenkins, an overeager young witch who conveniently offers to handle the demons and give the sisters the ""me-time"" they wanted in exchange for tutoring. But when Billie finally recovers her long-lost sister, held captive by demons for fifteen years, events are set in motion that willThere are some good moments. I actually liked Paige's romance with parole officer Henry Mitchell, even if I think the show rushed it and didn't do much more than a surface job. An over-the-top obsessive magical suitor for Paige nonetheless cracked me up. Piper's competition with another pre-school mom in Desperate Housewitches was hilarious. I enjoyed the episode Vaya Con Leos and Wyatt's subsequent reaction. I did love seeing some beloved characters again--older Wyatt, older Chris, Grams, Patty, Victor, the Angel of Death, just to name a few. There are some fun call-backs to prior seasons.I also had my quibbles. I was sad that Leo was cut out of a large chunk of the season. Whatever bad blood may have led to Shannon Doherty's separation from the show, surely everyone involved could have buried the hatchet enough to give a satisfactory acknowledgment to the role of Prue in the show. Many of the episodes or situations had been done before, even multiple times, so the lead actresses (and particularly the writers) often didn't seem as engaged as they might have been. Plot holes and inconsistencies with prior cannon were rampant. (Piper freezing Billie, time-travel shenanigans, Power of Three potions, etc.) The Phoebe-finding-love plot line was highly unsatisfactory. Coop never engaged me in the least as a character or potential love interest for Phoebe, and their interaction didn't have a smidgen of depth from what I could see. Not to mention that I was sick and tired of Phoebe going through guys right and left and was pretty exasperated when the show blamed that all on her Charmed responsibilities instead of acknowledging the considerable role her attitudes and behavior played. Maybe her marriage would have been meaningful to me if I'd been able to see Phoebe learning and growing beyond her old patterns and if her groom had been a more interesting character. And the less said about Phoebe's baby craze and the sisters' feelings of entitlement to whatever life they want, the better. Further, while it is understandable for the sisters to want out and the issue of selfishness and duty had potential and has been part of the show from the start, the 8th season really dropped the ball at the end. It never forced the sisters to, once-and-for all, face up to whether they're willing to make peace with their legacy and the sacrifices and hardships it imposes or whether they're going to continue to neglect their responsibilities and pawn them off on others and reap the results of that approach. I was very much disturbed by the coldness of the sisters in their later dealings with Billie and Christy; whether the Halliwell sisters like it or not, Billie and Christy are human and you'd think the ""good guys"" wouldn't be quite so gung ho about killing them when they know Billie is deluded and Christy has been manipulated and brainwashed by demons for years. Most of all, the Billie and Christy stuff grated on my nerves. Ultimate Power my foot; I was tempted to excuse vanquishing them just on the grounds that that much credulity and naivete combined with magic is just a nuclear disaster waiting to happen. If you can stomach the idea that a pair of vacuous, foolish novice witches can go up against the Charmed Ones and win to begin with, of course. (After some reflection, I've concluded that Billie may not be as dumb as I initially considered her, but that doesn't necessarily mean she uses the brains she was born with.) The characters were flat; Christie less so, but still utterly shallow in the end, and the conflict between the Jenkins sisters and the Halliwell sisters was (literally) utterly contrived and senseless.Still, there's a reason this show survived this long. I just wished its final season had been more satisfying.",3,Tired...,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,4494,"['love', 'Charmed', 'Season', '8', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'highlight', 'show', 'me.By', 'time', 'Season', '8', 'around', 'Halliwell', 'sisters', 'have', 'outright', 'abandoned', 'identities', 'magical', 'role', 'As', 'far', 'Piper', 'Phoebe', 'Paige', 'are', 'concerned', ""'ve"", 'done', 'time', 'policing', 'magical', 'world', ""n't"", 'changed', 'even', 'come', 'realize', 'old', 'lives', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'take', 'back', 'identities', 'Enter', 'Billie', 'Jenkins', 'overeager', 'young', 'witch', 'who', 'offers', 'handle', 'demons', 'give', 'sisters', 'me-time', 'wanted', 'exchange', 'tutoring', 'when', 'Billie', 'finally', 'long-lost', 'sister', 'held', 'captive', 'demons', 'fifteen', 'years', 'events', 'are', 'set', 'motion', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'actually', 'liked', 'Paige', 'romance', 'parole', 'officer', 'Henry', 'Mitchell', 'even', 'think', 'show', 'rushed', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'more', 'surface', 'job', 'over-the-top', 'obsessive', 'magical', 'suitor', 'Paige', 'nonetheless', 'cracked', 'up', 'Piper', 'competition', 'pre-school', 'mom', 'Desperate', 'Housewitches', 'was', 'hilarious', 'enjoyed', 'episode', 'Vaya', 'Con', 'Leos', 'Wyatt', 'subsequent', 'reaction', 'did', 'love', 'seeing', 'beloved', 'characters', 'again', 'older', 'Wyatt', 'older', 'Chris', 'Grams', 'Patty', 'Victor', 'Angel', 'Death', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'are', 'fun', 'call-backs', 'prior', 'seasons.I', 'also', 'had', 'quibbles', 'was', 'sad', 'Leo', 'was', 'cut', 'large', 'chunk', 'season', 'bad', 'blood', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'Shannon', 'Doherty', 'separation', 'show', 'surely', 'everyone', 'involved', 'could', 'have', 'buried', 'hatchet', 'enough', 'give', 'satisfactory', 'acknowledgment', 'role', 'Prue', 'show', 'Many', 'episodes', 'situations', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'even', 'multiple', 'times', 'lead', 'actresses', 'particularly', 'writers', 'often', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'engaged', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Plot', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'prior', 'cannon', 'were', 'rampant', 'Piper', 'freezing', 'Billie', 'time-travel', 'shenanigans', 'Power', 'Three', 'potions', 'etc', 'Phoebe-finding-love', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'highly', 'unsatisfactory', 'Coop', 'never', 'engaged', 'least', 'character', 'potential', 'love', 'interest', 'Phoebe', 'interaction', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'smidgen', 'depth', 'what', 'could', 'see', 'Not', 'mention', 'was', 'sick', 'tired', 'Phoebe', 'going', 'guys', 'right', 'left', 'was', 'pretty', 'exasperated', 'when', 'show', 'blamed', 'Charmed', 'responsibilities', 'instead', 'acknowledging', 'considerable', 'role', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'played', 'Maybe', 'marriage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'meaningful', ""'d"", 'been', 'able', 'see', 'Phoebe', 'learning', 'growing', 'old', 'patterns', 'groom', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'character', 'less', 'said', 'Phoebe', 'baby', 'craze', 'sisters', 'feelings', 'entitlement', 'life', 'want', 'better', 'Further', 'understandable', 'sisters', 'want', 'out', 'issue', 'selfishness', 'duty', 'had', 'potential', 'been', 'part', 'show', 'start', '8th', 'season', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'end', 'never', 'forced', 'sisters', 'once-and-for', 'face', 'up', ""'re"", 'willing', 'make', 'peace', 'legacy', 'sacrifices', 'hardships', ""'re"", 'going', 'continue', 'neglect', 'responsibilities', 'pawn', 'off', 'others', 'reap', 'results', 'approach', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'disturbed', 'coldness', 'sisters', 'later', 'dealings', 'Billie', 'Christy', 'Halliwell', 'sisters', 'not', 'Billie', 'Christy', 'are', 'human', ""'d"", 'think', 'good', 'guys', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'gung', 'ho', 'killing', 'when', 'know', 'Billie', 'deluded', 'Christy', 'been', 'manipulated', 'brainwashed', 'demons', 'years', 'Most', 'Billie', 'Christy', 'stuff', 'grated', 'nerves', 'Ultimate', 'Power', 'foot', 'was', 'tempted', 'excuse', 'vanquishing', 'just', 'grounds', 'much', 'credulity', 'naivete', 'combined', 'magic', 'just', 'nuclear', 'disaster', 'waiting', 'happen', 'can', 'stomach', 'idea', 'pair', 'vacuous', 'foolish', 'novice', 'witches', 'can', 'go', 'up', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'win', 'begin', 'course', 'reflection', ""'ve"", 'concluded', 'Billie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'dumb', 'initially', 'considered', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'brains', 'was', 'born', 'characters', 'were', 'flat', 'Christie', 'less', 'so', 'still', 'utterly', 'shallow', 'end', 'conflict', 'Jenkins', 'sisters', 'Halliwell', 'sisters', 'was', 'literally', 'utterly', 'contrived', 'senseless.Still', 'reason', 'show', 'survived', 'long', 'just', 'wished', 'final', 'season', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'satisfying']",Charmed: The Final Season

It had the heart-tugging moments (i.e. Vaya Con Leos) and it also had the fun light-hearted moments (i.e. Desperate Housewitches).  Each of the main three women brought their A-game to the final season of this series.  Adding in Billie also made it nice because it reflected back to when the series began and the girls were learning about their powers.  Also, the build up to the final showdown was a great progression through out the series.  Highlights in this season are Piper and Leo saying bye to each other in 'Vaya Con Leos,' Paige and Henry's relationship, Phoebe meeting Coop, Phoebe saying goodbye to Piper when she moves out of the manor and into her own place, and the big showdown between the Charmed Ones and Billie and Christie.The biggest reward to the fans of Charmed has to be the final minutes of the series finale where each of the main girls reflects on their lives and we pass a wall of pictures of the Halliwell family, and with the final shutting of the door we end on what was a great 8 year ride.",5,Final season went back to basics,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,1123,"['Season', '8', 'was', 'great', 'final', 'season', 'Charmed', 'had', 'elements', 'made', 'Charmed', 'so', 'great', 'had', 'heart-tugging', 'moments', 'i.e', 'Vaya', 'Con', 'Leos', 'also', 'had', 'fun', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'i.e', 'Desperate', 'Housewitches', 'main', 'three', 'women', 'brought', 'A-game', 'final', 'season', 'series', 'Adding', 'Billie', 'also', 'made', 'nice', 'reflected', 'back', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'girls', 'were', 'learning', 'powers', 'Also', 'build', 'up', 'final', 'showdown', 'was', 'great', 'progression', 'series', 'Highlights', 'season', 'are', 'Piper', 'Leo', 'saying', 'bye', 'other', ""'Vaya"", 'Con', 'Leos', 'Paige', 'Henry', 'relationship', 'Phoebe', 'meeting', 'Coop', 'Phoebe', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Piper', 'when', 'manor', 'own', 'place', 'big', 'showdown', 'Charmed', 'Ones', 'Billie', 'Christie.The', 'biggest', 'reward', 'fans', 'Charmed', 'be', 'final', 'minutes', 'series', 'finale', 'where', 'main', 'girls', 'lives', 'pass', 'wall', 'pictures', 'Halliwell', 'family', 'final', 'shutting', 'door', 'end', 'was', 'great', '8', 'year', 'ride']",Charmed: The Final Season
