Sure, she has a swimsuit on under the wetsuit, but I find that more interesting anyway. Lets one use one's imagination, I say.

Sure, there's lots of gunplay and a redundant catfight. That said, the dialogue here avoids the tongue-and-cheek quality that was evident in ""Coffy"" and ""Foxy Brown"" and the villains here are more realistic and not as cartoonish.  The underlying theme here are the underworld elements that threaten legitimate black entrepreneurs.  Because the film deals with the threat more seriously the message becomes more potent.  Even in this low-budget effort Grier just commands the screen like any of her contemporaries and would give a run for the money for today's top actresses.  She was definitely ahead of her time.

565903,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000053VBD,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 6]","If I had to describe `Sheba Baby,' the best I can come up with is Pam Grier Light with some really bad mellow drama. I really tried, but this movie just didn't work for me. The action scenes were dull, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were TOO stereotypical to even be funny.This Pam Grier film is incredibly tame. It's nowhere near as violent as some of her earlier films. Gone are the over-the-top images of Pam placing a small revolver or razor blades in her afro. Pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can't hold a candle to some of the real villains Pam faced in her previous movies. It's strictly by-the-numbers and almost has a made-for-TV feel. As for the bad acting, the baddies that Pam faces off with are as unnatural sounding in their delivery as I've seen. As a result, characters like Pilot don't come across as threatening as they should or need to for the movie to work.That's not to say there aren't moments or elements in `Sheba Baby' that I didn't enjoy  it's just that when compared with Pam's other films like `Coffy,' `Foxy Brown,' and even `Friday Foster' that the movie fails. It is not one of her best performances, though. Her ""avenging angel"" persona has been soften quite a bit, so she is forced to rely mostly on her natural charm. Still, I had fun with this film.

Taken by itself, SHEBA BABY is still an enjoyable and entertaining Pam Grier movie.  Here she plays a no-nonsense Chicago-based private investigator who returns to Louisville to protect her father from mob forces muscling in on his loan business.  The story plays out like many cop/detective shows from the 70s, but despite the PG rating there's plenty of action here and Pam always gets her man (her confrontation with the hustler in the car wash is a riot!).  Of course the PG rating means virtually no nudity (Pam stays between the sheets for her only ""nude"" scene), but she still looks great and (quite nicely!) dons a wetsuit for much of the last third of the film.  The film also boasts a funky 70s soundtrack, including vocals by Barbara Mason.  Unfortunately the soundtrack LP is long out of print and quite rare, however I would certainly welcome a CD reissue.  The DVD also features a trailer for the film that's quite fun (""Slammin' Pam... giving the gun brothers the frizzies and their boss man the tizzies!"").
