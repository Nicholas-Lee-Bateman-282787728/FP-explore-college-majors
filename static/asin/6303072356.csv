354363,A1KR00LVURBZTA,6303072356,D. A. Donahue,"[0, 0]","When you think of movies with talking animals in them, most individuals would not look back as far as the series of movies starring Donald O'Connor and Francis the Talking Mule.  The movies were full of humor and also were used to build moral in the services during an extended war time period.  Who could believe that a mule could talk?  That was the premise behind the shows and each time that the question was raised, the poor protagonist (Donald O'Connor) had to stand tall and take ridicule when he did tell his story of the talking mule.  The fun began at the start of each movie and did not let up till the last second.  There were many supporting actors and some of them ended up becoming big name actors, like Tony Curtis who was shown for a brief few minutes in Francis the Talking Mule.  I recommend these movies for anyone who likes to look back at old shows and see good clean humor.  I wish that Amazon will eventually obtain the rest of the movies in this series and release them for purchase via Instant Video.  I have already placed them under the Watchlist for the time that Amazon does obtain the rights.",5,Oldie Goldie: Francis The Talking Mule,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,1123,"['When', 'think', 'movies', 'talking', 'animals', 'most', 'individuals', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'series', 'movies', 'starring', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Francis', 'Talking', 'Mule', 'movies', 'were', 'full', 'humor', 'also', 'were', 'used', 'build', 'moral', 'services', 'extended', 'war', 'time', 'period', 'Who', 'could', 'believe', 'mule', 'could', 'talk', 'was', 'premise', 'shows', 'time', 'question', 'was', 'raised', 'poor', 'protagonist', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'had', 'stand', 'tall', 'take', 'ridicule', 'when', 'did', 'tell', 'story', 'talking', 'mule', 'fun', 'began', 'start', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'let', 'up', 'till', 'last', 'second', 'were', 'many', 'supporting', 'actors', 'ended', 'up', 'becoming', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Tony', 'Curtis', 'who', 'was', 'shown', 'brief', 'few', 'minutes', 'Francis', 'Talking', 'Mule', 'recommend', 'movies', 'anyone', 'who', 'look', 'back', 'old', 'shows', 'see', 'good', 'clean', 'humor', 'wish', 'Amazon', 'will', 'eventually', 'obtain', 'rest', 'movies', 'series', 'release', 'purchase', 'Instant', 'Video', 'have', 'already', 'placed', 'Watchlist', 'time', 'Amazon', 'obtain', 'rights']",Francis the Talking Mule VHS

Looking back on it now, however, after nine years of television&#8217;s &#8216;Mister Ed&#8217; and the current plethora of talking cartoon animals, it seems a bit dated.  Even so, it&#8217;s still a fun film to watch, especially if you like Donald O&#8217;Connor.  And, if you watch it closely you&#8217;ll likely see quite a few other familiar faces, many whom were relatively unknown at the time but went on to enjoy long and successful careers in films and on television.  In any event, I enjoyed this film once again, but it still puzzles me: Why didn&#8217;t I ever wonder why Francis was always standing around, all by himself, in the Japanese infested jungle?

354369,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,6303072356,Scott MacGillivray,"[19, 20]","Although these films were made five years apart, the later one is loaded with references to the earlier one, making this a fine double bill. FRANCIS has soldier Donald O'Connor vainly trying to convince his superior officers that he knows a mule that talks. The gimmick is a good one (the director later worked on TV's &quot;Mister Ed&quot;), and it's an enjoyable movie. FRANCIS JOINS THE WACS is even funnier, with O'Connor recalled to duty but in the Women's Army Corps. O'Connor plays the mule's pal more broadly this time, and the script gives him plenty of room for clowning (in one scene O'Connor has to masquerade as a WAC nurse while Francis hilariously heckles everybody). Very well done technically; you'll be amazed at how well the dialogue is fitted to Francis's facial movements. Both films have good supporting casts, especialy Ray Collins and John McIntire in the first film, Lynn Bari and Julia Adams in the second, and Chill Wills and ZaSu Pitts in both.
