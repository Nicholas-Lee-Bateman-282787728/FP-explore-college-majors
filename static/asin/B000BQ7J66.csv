Afterwards i took it back to the place i bought it at and exchanged it for another used dvd.Seemed to start out like a pretty descent movie then somewhere along the way, whoever was writing the script put the last half of it in a screader. Then someone else wrote the rest of it...There is one scene in the middle that has no point at all being in it but to really disgust you. It did and i would of throwed it away if they hadn't exchanged it for another movie. Which i chose ""UNDEAD"" a far superior horror movie!!It's a shame this movie was even filmed. Afterwards i wanted the hour and thirty minutes back of my life that i spent watching it. If you are into disgusting horror scenes the middle of the film will probally be the only thing of interest.To me it just made me hate it more. Makes you wonder what they can get away with in a horror movie. I wouldn't sit through the movie again if you paid me.If you plan on renting it or watching it in the horror section and you seen ""HEEBIE JEEBIES"" or ""UNDEAD"" chose the later. I'd of given it ""NO"" stars if that would of been possible.CMH",1,"This Movie Sucks, Really Bad!!",1165622400,"12 9, 2006",2006,1217,"['Earlier', 'year', 'was', 'misfortune', 'sit', 'really', 'stupid', 'movie', 'even', 'made', 'mistake', 'buying', 'DVD', 'Afterwards', 'i', 'took', 'back', 'place', 'i', 'bought', 'exchanged', 'used', 'dvd.Seemed', 'start', 'out', 'pretty', 'descent', 'movie', 'then', 'somewhere', 'way', 'was', 'writing', 'script', 'put', 'last', 'half', 'screader', 'Then', 'someone', 'else', 'wrote', 'rest', 'one', 'scene', 'middle', 'point', 'being', 'really', 'disgust', 'did', 'i', 'would', 'throwed', 'away', 'had', ""n't"", 'exchanged', 'movie', 'Which', 'i', 'chose', 'UNDEAD', 'far', 'superior', 'horror', 'movie', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'filmed', 'Afterwards', 'i', 'wanted', 'hour', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'back', 'life', 'i', 'spent', 'watching', 'are', 'disgusting', 'horror', 'middle', 'film', 'will', 'probally', 'be', 'only', 'thing', 'interest.To', 'just', 'made', 'hate', 'more', 'Makes', 'wonder', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'sit', 'movie', 'again', 'paid', 'me.If', 'plan', 'renting', 'watching', 'horror', 'section', 'seen', 'HEEBIE', 'JEEBIES', 'UNDEAD', 'chose', 'later', ""'d"", 'given', 'NO', 'would', 'been', 'possible.CMH']",Heebie Jeebies
947964,A2XWU6Y8PF8L17,B000BQ7J66,"CreepyT ""CreepyTendencies""","[5, 5]","When a young girl dreams of her mother's death, and then it actually occurs, she no longer takes her dreams for granted.  When she later dreams of the deaths of her former classmates, she is determined to keep her dreams from becoming a reality.  Cassandra invites her friends to an abandoned house for a few days with the intention of keeping them from seeing their supposed fate.  Fate, however, is not always so kind.The premise, aside from being rather akin to that of the Final Destination films, is a somewhat intriguing one that could have been explored in great depth, as well as entertained it's viewers with some killer scares along the way.  However, this film does not manage to do that.  Rather than attempt to push some boundaries, Heebie Jeebies dishes out extremely predictable slasher cheese.Furthermore, there is one dream interlude that adds absolutely nothing to the plot.  In fact, I had to fast forward and then rewind the film just to make sure this sequence was indeed a part of the same film and not some factory defect with the DVD.  I spent the remainder of the film trying to figure out just how this sequence was going to tie in with the rest of the plot, and it never did!  Sure, it was funny and amusing, but the film would have been much better off without it.Aside from the aforementioned completely pointless dream sequence, Heebie Jeebies was very mediocre straight-to-video horror fare.  The acting and make-up were passably decent, and the effects were fairly well done for a low budget film.  Had I not felt robbed of twenty minutes in the middle of the film due to an entirely random interlude, I would probably have rated this film a tad higher.Rent this if you must, but it is certainly not worth the cost of the purchase.",2,Could have been much better,1137369600,"01 16, 2006",2006,1763,"['When', 'young', 'girl', 'dreams', 'mother', 'death', 'then', 'actually', 'no', 'longer', 'dreams', 'granted', 'When', 'later', 'dreams', 'deaths', 'former', 'classmates', 'determined', 'keep', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'reality', 'Cassandra', 'friends', 'abandoned', 'house', 'few', 'days', 'intention', 'keeping', 'seeing', 'supposed', 'fate', 'Fate', 'however', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'kind.The', 'premise', 'aside', 'being', 'rather', 'akin', 'Final', 'Destination', 'films', 'somewhat', 'intriguing', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'explored', 'great', 'depth', 'as', 'well', 'entertained', 'viewers', 'killer', 'scares', 'way', 'However', 'film', 'not', 'manage', 'do', 'Rather', 'attempt', 'push', 'boundaries', 'Heebie', 'Jeebies', 'out', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'slasher', 'cheese.Furthermore', 'one', 'dream', 'interlude', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'plot', 'fact', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'then', 'rewind', 'film', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'sequence', 'was', 'indeed', 'part', 'same', 'film', 'not', 'factory', 'defect', 'DVD', 'spent', 'remainder', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'sequence', 'was', 'going', 'tie', 'rest', 'plot', 'never', 'did', 'Sure', 'was', 'funny', 'amusing', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'it.Aside', 'aforementioned', 'completely', 'pointless', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Heebie', 'Jeebies', 'was', 'very', 'mediocre', 'straight-to-video', 'horror', 'fare', 'acting', 'make-up', 'were', 'passably', 'decent', 'effects', 'were', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Had', 'not', 'felt', 'robbed', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'middle', 'film', 'due', 'entirely', 'random', 'interlude', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'rated', 'film', 'tad', 'higher.Rent', 'must', 'certainly', 'not', 'cost', 'purchase']",Heebie Jeebies
947965,A3QUUVOQ9EBYPK,B000BQ7J66,Gary Young,"[0, 0]","Dan O'Bannon(writer of Alien, director of Return of the Living Dead) is quoted as saying this low budget effort is ""a cut above the competition"".  Well, I'll admit that it's slightly better than some of the direct to video junk out there(Near Death & The Horror Within spring directly to mind), but not by much.The basic plot of Heebie Jeebies actually has potential.  A young woman who predicted her mother's death in a dream is now having similar dreams about some of her former high school classmates.  To keep them safe she invites them to a dilapidated house in the middle of the woods.  Why couldn't she have just invited them to IHOP?  Seems that would be a much safer place.  That's just the beginning of this film's problems.Waaaayyyyy too much time is spent on reenactments of the main character's deadly dreams.  They completely take us out of the main story and just add to the viewer's frustration.  The one dream sequence about the killer statues(yep, you read that right) seems to go on forever.Oh, another problem comes when the killer is revealed.  If an explanation was given for the motive, I must have missed it.Perhaps I'm being generous for giving this 2 stars.  The film did try to be different.  The acting was okay,  nothing special.  Like I said earlier, the storyline had potential.  Maybe with a better script and director this could have been something special.",2,Heebie Cheapies is More Like It!,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,1390,"['Dan', ""O'Bannon"", 'writer', 'Alien', 'director', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'quoted', 'saying', 'low', 'budget', 'effort', 'cut', 'competition', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'slightly', 'better', 'direct', 'video', 'junk', 'there', 'Near', 'Death', 'Horror', 'Within', 'spring', 'directly', 'mind', 'not', 'much.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'Heebie', 'Jeebies', 'actually', 'potential', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'predicted', 'mother', 'death', 'dream', 'now', 'having', 'similar', 'dreams', 'former', 'high', 'school', 'classmates', 'keep', 'safe', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'middle', 'woods', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'invited', 'IHOP', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'safer', 'place', 'just', 'beginning', 'film', 'problems.Waaaayyyyy', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'reenactments', 'main', 'character', 'deadly', 'dreams', 'completely', 'take', 'main', 'story', 'just', 'add', 'viewer', 'frustration', 'one', 'dream', 'sequence', 'killer', 'statues', 'yep', 'read', 'right', 'go', 'forever.Oh', 'problem', 'when', 'killer', 'revealed', 'explanation', 'was', 'given', 'motive', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'it.Perhaps', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'giving', '2', 'stars', 'film', 'did', 'try', 'be', 'different', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'special', 'said', 'earlier', 'storyline', 'had', 'potential', 'Maybe', 'better', 'script', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'special']",Heebie Jeebies

947969,A2UYKOS1ZYK1OU,B000BQ7J66,"See about me ""firin mah lazar""","[2, 2]","One day, I was in my local video rental place with a friend. We were of course looking for campy popcorn movies to make fun of. He told me of ""Heebie Jeebies."" which he promised was the best movie ever made, because it was [paradoxically] the worst movie ever made. I agreed, ingested a ton of caffeine, and painfully trudged through this ""thinking man's slasher film."" (Which the back of the DVD case assures with all the conviction of a used car salesman.) What I saw was the most dull, digressive horror movie ever with a predictable, telegraphed ending that literally inflicts physical pain on fans of good movies.The premise is a bunch of kids in some cabin/slaughterhouse/haunted house/can't remember. There's a killer, of course. She eats hair. Yes, she eats hair. I guess all the ""spooky masks"" were taken, so they needed a gimmick. The plot is essentially some autistic girl telling her dumb friends who are all for some reason still hanging around in the house her irrelevant dreams-- All of which are examined in 20 minute dream sequences. The trick the director tried to play is that none of the dreams have anything to do with the plot, but, *gasp* someone from the final dream hits the surviving girl in a car. But as I said earlier, it was telegraphed to the point it was predictable as a ""like that one time..."" sequence in a Family Guy episode.There are no positive points to this film. It's so bad, it logically shouldn't exist. It should collapse in on itself, and be sucked into a singularity of sophomoric crap. Even the gore is pathetic. There's this one scene involving a massive meat grinder. But Heebie Jeebies, always quick to smash my dreams, made the meat grinder spit out a thin stream of mud or chocolate syrup when it went to work on someone.
