1001950,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B000GDH7PM,C. Long,"[5, 6]","I have some VERY SERIOUS misgivings about this movie. However, it can have value if viewed in the proper context and with proper follow-up discussion/critical thinking.The Christianity portrayed is a VERY watered-down Christianity (Jesus I don't think is even mentioned) - it seems a very ""religious"" Christianity rather than a ""relationship"" Christianity - the main character seems to be ""committed"" to God in a religious sense since she made a commitment to Him and wants to keep that commitment, but she doesn't seem particularly close to Him at all and indeed seems to be very frustrated at Him because of all He has allowed in her life.Which brings me to my really big beef with this movie:This movie portrays God as someone distant up there that basically is just out to cause us pain. Through the main character's brushes with several tragedies, lots of questions about God's goodness are raised, but are never resolved in the movie. Basically you can easily come away with a view that God is a God that really doesn't care about our hurts - and almost that he ""delights"" in causing us pain to ""test us"" so we will trust Him more. That is NOT the God I know.There is hurt and death in this world, but God is not out to kill everyone close to me just so He can ""test my faith"". Who wants to follow a God like that? Not me. And in the movie, you get the clear indication that the main character really doesn't either, but she is just forcing herself to persevere out of duty because of a religious commitment she made early in her life where she decided she wouldn't ""turn back"" from her decision to follow.In reality, the deaths and tragic situations in the movie are merely a reflection of life in a fallen world, including our choices. For instance, the death of parents just happens because people do not live forever here - there is a time for us all. Yet, in the movie, the deaths don't come across this way as just something that happens, but rather comes across more that God ""has it out"" for the main character.Another tragic situation that occurs centers around a relationship that gets jilted because (slight spoiler) one of the characters (a pastor) believes God is calling him to leave the main character (woman) and go overseas to war - this results in all sorts of hurt and pain and a terrible mix-up that has lifelong consequences. God gets blamed for this too. Yet, as I was watching this unfold, all I could think was it would be far more likely that the guy misheard God and his own choices caused this hurt. It's hard for me to envision God calling this pastor to do such a thing given what we've seen building before that with this woman. Again, it just doesn't mesh with the God I know, and indeed the result of what happens seems to prove that out. If it had really been God, it would have been a whole different outcome because God isn't out just to ""do us in"" and take away all our joy and any chance at happiness. It seems like the man's choices as a flawed human cause a cascading series of events that hurts all sorts of people (including himself) - and yet, God gets the blame.And that's the problem. The net result is you walk away from this movie with the following message:""There is a God. He does what He wants to do. He causes hurt and pain and kills people close to us to test us. We just need to keep persevering and trust Him anyway and do good for others.""Which is really quite depressing and is why I have a very hard time recommending this movie. God is most definitely NOT portrayed as a God of love in this movie and indeed any real relationship with our God of love seems absent.However, this movie is a very vivid portrayal of a life, with all its twists and turns, and yet a commitment to God remains. And we do see how God works with the events and choices that occur and does still ultimately work things out ""for the good"" in the main character's life. It's a ""case study"" of sorts of a life in motion and because this portrayal can be enlightening and cause consideration of how our choices affect others, I do feel there is some value in this movie and it can ultimately be an ""uplift"" if processed correctly. But I do believe it definitely requires ""processing"" - it warrants some very strong consideration and follow-up after-the-fact to make sure that you aren't wrongly internalizing the problematic messages stated above.After you watch this movie, you want to go back and make sure that you go confess how Jesus loves you and is for you, NOT against you! A read of Romans 8 might be in order - even singing ""Jesus Loves Me"" might help... :)I strongly suggest that you *NOT* watch this with children of any age or with new-in-the-faith believers. This is a movie more for spiritually-mature adults in the Lord that can appropriately strip out the problematic messages.The acting and production quality of this film were just fine and the story is interesting and engaging (FYI: you WILL cry in this movie).

If you like romantic films you will probably enjoy it as love is the main thread in the storyline which is slightly lacking otherwise. The main theme though is that life is not easy even for Christians.  We need to keep following God despite our difficulties and He will help us along the way.  The lyrics from the song, ""I Have Decided to Follow Jesus"" are quoted as encouragement for Elizabeth, the main character.This story is also about a woman's love for two men and their love for her.  Her handsome childhood friend Will, has been secretly in love with her, but she thinks of him as just a brotherly type friend.  When the young and handsome pastor arrives and Elizabeth starts to fall in love with him, Will proposes.  However, the love between her and pastor Ben Phillips continues to grow. Their happiness is complicated by the Korean War and Ben's call to the ministry.  Will on the other hand continues to stand by Elizabeth through some very difficult times and tragedies.Criticisms of the film: Unfortunately the make-up for the characters was very over done which I found distracting.  Also, aging Cheryl Ladd did not come across well on screen.  The older characters in the movie were the age of my parents and I thought they were trying to make her look way too old.  Instead they should have hired a different actress to play the part of the aging Elizabeth and had Ms. Ladd continue to play her as a middle aged woman as she did in the film as well.  Also, I was puzzled about the ring she took off being too big for her...again that was distracting. I don't know how close this is to the book as I've never read it and I've heard conflicting reports.The two men in the film present a different type of support to Elizabeth.  My preference is for Will whose love is completely unconditional and he stands by her no matter what happens.  Ben is an encouragement to her in terms of her faith and what God is calling both of them to do.  The romantic scenes are very touching and rather heartbreaking at the same time.  Both men want only what's best for Elizabeth and truly love her which makes for a complicated love triangle!  The acting, particularly by David Noro&ntilde;a and Brad Rowe, was excellent and both are believable suitors for Elizabeth.I'd recommend this film as I think it has a good message and it emphasizes the things that are important in life, but it does contain some imperfections that you need to overlook to fully enjoy it.  However, the idea of holding onto your faith through all the trials in life is a very good message.",4,A Good Movie with Imperfections,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,2688,"['thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'times', 'rather', 'sombre', 'due', 'heartbreak', 'characters', 'experience', 'like', 'romantic', 'films', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'love', 'main', 'thread', 'storyline', 'slightly', 'lacking', 'otherwise', 'main', 'theme', 'though', 'life', 'not', 'easy', 'even', 'Christians', 'need', 'keep', 'following', 'God', 'difficulties', 'will', 'help', 'way', 'lyrics', 'song', 'Have', 'Decided', 'Follow', 'Jesus', 'are', 'quoted', 'encouragement', 'Elizabeth', 'main', 'character.This', 'story', 'also', 'woman', 'love', 'two', 'men', 'love', 'handsome', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Will', 'been', 'secretly', 'love', 'as', 'just', 'brotherly', 'type', 'friend', 'When', 'young', 'handsome', 'pastor', 'arrives', 'Elizabeth', 'fall', 'love', 'Will', 'However', 'love', 'pastor', 'Ben', 'Phillips', 'grow', 'happiness', 'complicated', 'Korean', 'War', 'Ben', 'call', 'ministry', 'Will', 'other', 'hand', 'stand', 'Elizabeth', 'very', 'difficult', 'times', 'tragedies.Criticisms', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'make-up', 'characters', 'was', 'very', 'done', 'found', 'distracting', 'Also', 'aging', 'Cheryl', 'Ladd', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'across', 'well', 'screen', 'older', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'age', 'parents', 'thought', 'were', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'Instead', 'should', 'have', 'hired', 'different', 'actress', 'play', 'part', 'aging', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'Ms.', 'Ladd', 'continue', 'play', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'did', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Also', 'was', 'puzzled', 'ring', 'took', 'off', 'being', 'too', 'big', 'again', 'was', 'distracting', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'close', 'book', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'conflicting', 'reports.The', 'two', 'men', 'film', 'present', 'different', 'type', 'support', 'Elizabeth', 'preference', 'Will', 'love', 'completely', 'unconditional', 'matter', 'what', 'Ben', 'encouragement', 'terms', 'faith', 'what', 'God', 'calling', 'do', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'rather', 'heartbreaking', 'same', 'time', 'men', 'want', 'only', 'what', 'best', 'Elizabeth', 'truly', 'love', 'complicated', 'love', 'triangle', 'acting', 'particularly', 'David', 'Noro', 'ntilde', 'Brad', 'Rowe', 'was', 'excellent', 'are', 'believable', 'suitors', 'Elizabeth.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'think', 'good', 'message', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'life', 'contain', 'imperfections', 'need', 'overlook', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'However', 'idea', 'holding', 'faith', 'trials', 'life', 'very', 'good', 'message']",N/A

The main character had her faith tested many times and she always chose to do right.A secondary theme is faithfulness and fidelity in marriage.  This is in complete contradiction to modern Hollywood sensibilities about ""love"".  Very powerful message.From a conservative Evangelical Christian viewpoint, however, the content of faith (salvation is in Christ alone) is absent--just the general non-offensive sense of God.  Christianity, according to the film, is not about the gospel and making disciples, but about social causes.  Furthermore, the faith and morals of the main characters were not passed on to their child and grandchild, who is in rebellion and running off (and presumably living with) a man who is not her husband.  This is disappointing, but all too frequent in second, third, and fourth generation Christianity.From a cinematic standpoint, the acting isn't always the greatest and the granddaughter's interest and then lack of interest in her grandmother's tale doesn't seem realistic.Again, the message is extremely powerful--well worth the time.",4,Faithfulness Exalted,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,1214,"['film', 'be', 'commended', 'message', 'matter', 'what', 'God', 'lives', 'are', 'faithfully', 'follow', 'trust', 'sovereignty', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'faith', 'tested', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'chose', 'do', 'right.A', 'secondary', 'theme', 'faithfulness', 'fidelity', 'marriage', 'complete', 'contradiction', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'sensibilities', 'love', 'Very', 'powerful', 'conservative', 'Evangelical', 'Christian', 'viewpoint', 'however', 'content', 'faith', 'salvation', 'Christ', 'alone', 'absent', 'just', 'general', 'non-offensive', 'sense', 'God', 'Christianity', 'according', 'film', 'not', 'gospel', 'making', 'disciples', 'social', 'causes', 'Furthermore', 'faith', 'morals', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'passed', 'child', 'grandchild', 'who', 'rebellion', 'running', 'off', 'presumably', 'living', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'husband', 'disappointing', 'too', 'frequent', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'generation', 'Christianity.From', 'cinematic', 'standpoint', 'acting', ""n't"", 'always', 'greatest', 'granddaughter', 'interest', 'then', 'lack', 'interest', 'grandmother', 'tale', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic.Again', 'message', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'well', 'time']",N/A

In addition, the book was based, very realistically in Three Rivers, Michigan...a small town of about 7800, where I've resided for more than sixty years. Of course, the movie doesn't mention the state (not that I heard anyway), and I suppose that was omitted to increase appeal for the general public. In any case, it definitely wasn't filmed here, and as a long time resident, I found that part sadly lacking. However, had I not read the book first, nor had any knowledge that the story was based in Three Rivers, Michigan, I would have given it five stars.
