196109,A2839AXA72UHAU,5559921017,"Edward C. Dennis ""Mr Ed""","[2, 2]","This movie is about a woman who gets a rare opportunity in life! She get's to know when she's gonna die! The exact day and time! Now, the Bible says that it is appointed unto man, once, to die..And after this, the Judgement!But the woman in this movie toys with the thought of accepting Christ as her Saviour, even though she's told when she'll die! Personally, I think it's a great witnessing tool to lead the lost to Salvation! I really enjoyed the movie, though I think the movie is quite short!But I enjoyed it anyway...God Bless..Ed Dennis (MrEd)",5,Get Right With God,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,551,"['movie', 'woman', 'who', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'life', 'get', 'know', 'when', 'gon', 'die', 'exact', 'day', 'time', 'Now', 'Bible', 'appointed', 'unto', 'man', 'once', 'die..And', 'Judgement', 'woman', 'movie', 'thought', 'accepting', 'Christ', 'Saviour', 'even', 'told', 'when', ""'ll"", 'die', 'Personally', 'think', 'great', 'witnessing', 'tool', 'lead', 'lost', 'Salvation', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'short', 'enjoyed', 'anyway', 'God', 'Bless..Ed', 'Dennis', 'MrEd']",N/A

Rich Christiano was already an experienced hand at directing this genre and I followed his direction to a tee. It isn't a movie for everyone, however. There's some mysticism involved and a bit of suspense, to go along with the many messages of faith. Something to think about. That's how I looked at it. The experience with Christiano gave me tools to work with in other, more diverse types of video projects that followed.",5,An experience.,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",2014,515,"['was', 'primarily', 'stage', 'actor', 'was', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'learning', 'experience', 'Rich', 'Christiano', 'was', 'already', 'experienced', 'hand', 'directing', 'genre', 'followed', 'direction', 'tee', ""n't"", 'movie', 'everyone', 'however', 'mysticism', 'involved', 'bit', 'suspense', 'go', 'along', 'many', 'messages', 'faith', 'Something', 'think', 'how', 'looked', 'experience', 'Christiano', 'gave', 'tools', 'work', 'other', 'more', 'diverse', 'types', 'video', 'projects', 'followed']",N/A

You will not walk away the same! i made sure i prayed after i saw this before i went to bed! Very nice and original idea!

196114,A3J3XO9BNTVTRS,5559921017,YhwhKhai,"[42, 42]","Just imagine a man coming to your place of employment and stating, ""(fill in your name here), I have a message for you.  It's from the Lord.  In eight days, on September 19th at 6:05 P.M. YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!""  What would you do?  Would you think it's a hoax? Or would you go along with life as if you never heard it?Although this DVD is pretty short 39 minutes, I found it to be an excellent evangelistic tool.  There's nothing scary about it at all.  Just realistic!The woman that the angel appeared to told her that she was privy to informaton or revelation that others don't normally receive.  Death is certain and no one knows when their time will come.  He also told her that the answers were found in the Bible.  Did she read the Bible for the answers or did she continue to ignore his warnings?I cannot say that the angel's warning was far-fetched at all.  Many patriochs in the Bible knew that they had finished their course and prepared their households or blessed their successors to continue where they left off.My son and I enjoyed this one. What an eye-opener.  To the Christian this DVD is a reminder to continue running the race with diligence.  For the unsaved, it's a reminder to give your life to Jesus Christ because you don't know when your time will come.  You may not get a warning when your time comes!The ending completely caught both of us off guard.  You will have to watch it to see what I'm talking about.",4,The Appointment,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,1435,"['Just', 'imagine', 'man', 'coming', 'place', 'employment', 'stating', 'fill', 'name', 'here', 'have', 'message', 'Lord', 'eight', 'days', 'September', '19th', '6:05', 'P.M.', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'GOING', 'TO', 'DIE', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Would', 'think', 'hoax', 'would', 'go', 'life', 'never', 'heard', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'short', '39', 'minutes', 'found', 'be', 'excellent', 'evangelistic', 'tool', 'nothing', 'scary', 'Just', 'realistic', 'woman', 'angel', 'appeared', 'told', 'was', 'privy', 'informaton', 'revelation', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'receive', 'Death', 'certain', 'one', 'when', 'time', 'will', 'come', 'also', 'told', 'answers', 'were', 'found', 'Bible', 'Did', 'read', 'Bible', 'answers', 'did', 'continue', 'ignore', 'warnings', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'angel', 'warning', 'was', 'far-fetched', 'Many', 'patriochs', 'Bible', 'knew', 'had', 'finished', 'course', 'prepared', 'households', 'blessed', 'successors', 'continue', 'where', 'left', 'off.My', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'What', 'eye-opener', 'Christian', 'DVD', 'reminder', 'continue', 'running', 'race', 'diligence', 'unsaved', 'reminder', 'give', 'life', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'time', 'will', 'come', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'warning', 'when', 'time', 'ending', 'completely', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking']",N/A
