905618,A2YCG57S65QXUU,B0009HLBQQ,"Henry West ""I Love Movies""","[2, 2]","Phil of the Future: Gadgets and Gizmos is a 2005 Disney DVD compilation of four episodes of the classic Disney Channel Saturday morning sitcom. Phil Diffy is a teenager from the year 2121 who accidentally traveled to 2005 with his mom, dad, and his mean little sister Pim. While in the present, Phil made friends with Keely Teslow, a teenaged girl who only knows the Diffy family's secret. The fun only gets better with Curtis, a caveman who lives with the Diffys who always get in trouble. The special features includes audio commentary by Ricky Ullmann(Phil Diffy)as well as a 2121 cyber-catalogue and sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like That's So Raven, Lady and The Tramp and Valiant.

Maybe at some point they will release it by season or release the complete series onto dvd.And why did the show get canceled so soon?  It was a great show.Maybe they will still make a movie.Here's an idea for one:A few years later for both Phil and Keely in their respective times (the show has been off the year a few years). Phil comes back to be with Keely.  Maybe the future has been messed up since they got back because by going back to the future they changed it.  Because Phil and Keely were supposed to get married and have a bunch of kids and do other stuff that no longer happened cause Phil left.  Maybe it took a few years to escape the future and return to Keely.  Maybe Phil has to win her back cause she's dating someone else by then.",4,Maybe they'll make a movie,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,825,"['would', 'have', 'more', 'episodes', 'least', 'something', 'Maybe', 'point', 'will', 'release', 'season', 'release', 'complete', 'series', 'dvd.And', 'why', 'did', 'show', 'get', 'canceled', 'so', 'soon', 'was', 'great', 'show.Maybe', 'will', 'still', 'make', 'movie.Here', 'idea', 'one', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Phil', 'Keely', 'respective', 'times', 'show', 'been', 'off', 'year', 'few', 'years', 'Phil', 'back', 'be', 'Keely', 'Maybe', 'future', 'been', 'messed', 'up', 'got', 'back', 'going', 'back', 'future', 'changed', 'Phil', 'Keely', 'were', 'supposed', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'bunch', 'kids', 'do', 'other', 'stuff', 'longer', 'happened', 'cause', 'Phil', 'left', 'Maybe', 'took', 'few', 'years', 'escape', 'future', 'return', 'Keely', 'Maybe', 'Phil', 'win', 'back', 'cause', 'dating', 'someone', 'else', 'then']",Phil of the Future - Gadgets & Gizmos

Phil is one of my favorite shows ever...it's hilarious!  Phil now shows from Monday-Friday at 6:30 PM/5:30 central.  This is definitely a good collection of funny, good episodes plus a brand-new bonus episode.  I disagree with the voter below that people aren't tuning in to see Curtis the Caveman.  Curtis is hilarious, and he's what makes the show really unique.  (I do MAINLY tune in to watch Phil and Keely though.)  Bloopers would be something good to add, because they always help viewers to get a good laugh.  Other than that, this is a great collection of episodes, and Phil of the Future is a great show worth watching at least occasionally.",5,I love this show!,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",2005,754,"['love', 'show', 'Phil', 'Future', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'Phil', 'one', 'favorite', 'ever', 'hilarious', 'Phil', 'now', 'Monday-Friday', '6:30', 'PM/5:30', 'central', 'definitely', 'good', 'collection', 'funny', 'good', 'episodes', 'brand-new', 'bonus', 'episode', 'disagree', 'voter', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'tuning', 'see', 'Curtis', 'Caveman', 'Curtis', 'hilarious', 'what', 'show', 'really', 'unique', 'do', 'MAINLY', 'tune', 'watch', 'Phil', 'Keely', 'Bloopers', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'good', 'add', 'always', 'help', 'viewers', 'get', 'good', 'laugh', 'Other', 'great', 'collection', 'episodes', 'Phil', 'Future', 'great', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'occasionally']",Phil of the Future - Gadgets & Gizmos
