Like someone else said the movie is full of clich&eacute;s but that do not make it bad. Clich&eacute;s have become so well used that they have become clich&eacute;s for a reason, they work.The plot of the movie is nice, not a masterwork but nice, it is about a young man that after collapsing get diagnosed with an extreme form of ADHD and get smarter and smarter, soon he begin to become almost psychic and begin to see demons. But are they real or just in his mind?There is not that much gore in this movie, but the gore that is that is gory, but the movie relay more on a good story than on gore.

It seems that a young genius named Alex has somehow opened a gate to this alternate dimension, causing it to bleed into our reality. This would be fine if not for the murderous demonoids that have crossed over! Alex must find out what is happening and try to stop it. Of course, no one believes him, and the trans-dimensional creatures kill everyone Alex touches! HEADSPACE has a heavy, grim atmosphere of utter doom throughout. I love it! I also enjoyed watching horror legends Dee Wallace-Stone (The Hills Have Eyes, Cujo, The Howling) and Olivia Hussey (Black Christmas) as a doctor and a therapist.

964563,AWN6ZMWWMUWLX,B000E0OE76,J. Friday,"[1, 2]","I can understand why some didn't like this movie. People are too used to typical storylines in horror that something innovative is actually jarring. The vast majority of horror movies involve surburban teens or college-aged kids who unsuspectingly become victims for some horrible monster/slasher. Either that or it involves some lone, cute chick.This flick is different: it involves a male; there isn't a romance subplot; it is slow-paced; it takes place in an urban area; and the movie actually tries to give good characterization. As a result, it actually tries to make the viewer think. The typical horror moviegoer is used to the cliched elements I mentioned above that include cardboard characters. I'm sure the average horror moviegoer thought consciously or subconsciously, ""Whoa. I'm used to horror movies that have paper-thin characterization and recycled storylines and cliches. This is a horror movie that tries to make me think. I don't know if I'm able to do that for a horror movie."" I'm not trying to say the average horror movie fan is dumb. I'm saying that he's so used to mindless horror that he's unable to wrap his head around horror that tries to engage his brain.It's kind of like those people I know who only use their phone for texting. When I call to have a phone conversation they are so used to texting that they do not know how to speak over the phone. Example:Friend: ""Hu waddawawa"" (Hey, what do you want?)Me: ""I want to talk to you.""Friend: ""Wai innid yew teth me?"" (Why didn't you text me?)Me: ""Because I wanna hear your voice.""Friend: ""Ai kaina bessie. Cunnyu juss teth me?"" (I'm kind of busy. Can you just text me?)Me: ""You're not busy. This is your day off. You're probably just sitting home watching reruns.""Friend: ""Sewwa eff yaiyam? Wai own yew juss teth me or twidda me?"" (So what if I am? Why don't you just text me or twitter me?)Me: ""Forget it."" *hangs up*I should stop taking shots at the typical horror moviegoer and just review the movie. But I just wanted to talk about the context in which this movie should be viewed. I was able to get into this movie from the beginning because I've been waiting to see a horror movie with a different storyline. I'm glad this isn't the typical unsuspecting teens getting killed off one by one horror movie. I always give thumbs up to recent horror movies for trying something different.By the way, this isn't just different in storyline; it's also different in mood. This movie has a brooding atmosphere that is present throughout. This is created by slow pacing, dark scenes, and the mystery aspect (it's interesting how so many horror movies lack any kind of mystery or suspense).Of course, there are some cliches: the main character is seeing visions and others think he's crazy; characters who have little or nothing to do with the story getting killed; main character seeks the help of outcasts to tell him about the monsters; etc. Those cliches caused the loss of a star from my review. I also felt the characterizations were sometimes forced.All in all, I recommend this movie to horror fans seeking something different than the regular ""unsuspecting young people (or young woman) being terrorized by a monster or slasher"" storyline. Be aware that this is a slow-paced movie with noticeable flaws. But if you find it at a reasonable price, give it a shot.",4,Good and interesting,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,3346,"['can', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'People', 'are', 'too', 'used', 'typical', 'storylines', 'horror', 'something', 'innovative', 'actually', 'jarring', 'vast', 'majority', 'horror', 'movies', 'involve', 'surburban', 'teens', 'college-aged', 'kids', 'who', 'unsuspectingly', 'become', 'victims', 'horrible', 'monster/slasher', 'lone', 'cute', 'chick.This', 'flick', 'different', 'male', ""n't"", 'romance', 'subplot', 'slow-paced', 'place', 'urban', 'area', 'movie', 'actually', 'give', 'good', 'characterization', 'result', 'actually', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'typical', 'horror', 'moviegoer', 'used', 'cliched', 'elements', 'mentioned', 'include', 'cardboard', 'characters', ""'m"", 'sure', 'average', 'horror', 'moviegoer', 'thought', 'consciously', 'subconsciously', 'Whoa', ""'m"", 'used', 'horror', 'movies', 'have', 'paper-thin', 'characterization', 'recycled', 'storylines', 'cliches', 'horror', 'movie', 'make', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'able', 'do', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'say', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'dumb', ""'m"", 'saying', 'so', 'used', 'mindless', 'horror', 'unable', 'wrap', 'head', 'horror', 'engage', 'brain.It', 'kind', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'only', 'use', 'phone', 'texting', 'When', 'call', 'have', 'phone', 'conversation', 'are', 'so', 'used', 'texting', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'speak', 'phone', 'Example', 'Friend', 'Hu', 'waddawawa', 'Hey', 'what', 'do', 'want', 'Me', 'want', 'talk', 'Friend', 'Wai', 'innid', 'yew', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'text', 'Me', 'wan', 'na', 'hear', 'voice', 'Friend', 'Ai', 'kaina', 'bessie', 'Cunnyu', 'juss', ""'m"", 'kind', 'busy', 'Can', 'just', 'text', 'Me', ""'re"", 'not', 'busy', 'day', 'off', ""'re"", 'probably', 'just', 'sitting', 'home', 'watching', 'reruns', 'Friend', 'Sewwa', 'eff', 'yaiyam', 'Wai', 'own', 'yew', 'juss', 'twidda', 'what', 'am', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'text', 'twitter', 'Me', 'Forget', '*hangs', 'up*I', 'should', 'stop', 'taking', 'shots', 'typical', 'horror', 'moviegoer', 'just', 'review', 'movie', 'just', 'wanted', 'talk', 'context', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'movie', 'beginning', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'horror', 'movie', 'different', 'storyline', ""'m"", 'glad', ""n't"", 'typical', 'unsuspecting', 'teens', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'horror', 'movie', 'always', 'give', 'thumbs', 'up', 'recent', 'horror', 'movies', 'trying', 'something', 'different.By', 'way', ""n't"", 'just', 'different', 'storyline', 'also', 'different', 'mood', 'movie', 'brooding', 'atmosphere', 'present', 'created', 'slow', 'pacing', 'dark', 'scenes', 'mystery', 'aspect', 'interesting', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'lack', 'kind', 'mystery', 'suspense', '.Of', 'course', 'are', 'cliches', 'main', 'character', 'seeing', 'visions', 'others', 'think', 'crazy', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'nothing', 'do', 'story', 'getting', 'killed', 'main', 'character', 'help', 'outcasts', 'tell', 'monsters', 'etc', 'cliches', 'caused', 'loss', 'star', 'review', 'also', 'felt', 'characterizations', 'were', 'sometimes', 'forced.All', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'fans', 'seeking', 'something', 'different', 'regular', 'unsuspecting', 'young', 'people', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'terrorized', 'monster', 'slasher', 'storyline', 'Be', 'aware', 'slow-paced', 'movie', 'noticeable', 'flaws', 'find', 'reasonable', 'price', 'give', 'shot']",N/A
964564,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B000E0OE76,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 8]","For a film that boasts ""gore and beasties and gratuitous nudity"" and revealing that ""the scariest place on earth is between our own ears,"" ""Headspace"" falls short of its proclamations.  It attempts to be an intelligent thriller that relies more on the ""what if?"" factor than anything else.  Sure, there are a couple of reasonably gory moments in the film, but nothing worthy of the praises or awards it features on its DVD case.  The gratuitous nudity is late night Cinemax-worthy, but nothing to write home about.The story involves the splitting of two young brothers by a seemingly uncaring father after the violent death of their mother.  One boy has become super intelligent and is the focus of this tale, while the other is slowly revealed through flashbacks in the smart brother's mind.  Our hero begins to have vicious headaches and horrible nightmares that eventually put him in the hospital.  Unable to diagnose him, his doctor releases him into the care of a psychiatrist who attempts to figure out what's going on in his head.  As the days go by, however, the body count grows.  Eventually, the boy figures out what's really happening in his mind and attempts to struggle with his demons both inside and outside of his brain.The story does have a nice twist to it involving a key character in the story, but I don't want to give away any more information.  Had a little more time been spent on this tale, and less emphasis on tauting the gore, this could have been a wonderful, suspenseful tale.  Instead, we get a movie that attempts to be both intelligent and gory at the same time and fails at both.The acting is pretty good, but the bulk of the cast is towed along by former scream queen Dee Wallace Stone, ex-Juliet Olivia Hussey, the capable William Atherton, and the still lovely Sean Young.  The rest of the cast is made up of newcomers.The creatures in this feature are okay, but they do look somewhat like a cross between a pig and the vampire bat that Gary Oldman turns into in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula.""In short, I'd consider this flick a one-time rental.

This particular horror movie also delivers an intricate, winding plot that leaves you thinking even after the movie is over. Headspace lives up to its hype as one of the best independent horror movies of the year.Christopher Denham bursts from the unknown to deliver an interesting performance as Alex, a `real genius' type with something horribly dark fueling his sudden intellect. His back story and present are peppered with fascinating characters portrayed by a remarkable array of actors -everyone from Sean Young to Udo Kier.  The real star of this movie, however, is the plot, which winds just enough to keep you hanging on, wanting more, without winding so much that you're thrown off. At the end, you're left with a smile on your lips and a mind full of questions (but which questions I can't say without spoiling the movie!)As for major pros and cons, if you want something with really cool monsters, this isn't your horror movie. The monster make-up isn't anything that will leave chills down your spine (when people get killed the make-up is spot on, so don't worry about that).

964569,A5KJVGJ43ZDC9,B000E0OE76,Ronald Battista,"[0, 1]","I can see why Stuart Gordon liked this alot.While bordering on cliche, it's hard to discount some facts. This is a low budget film, with a first time young director and a very competent gore crew. With that in mind, you can appreciate some of the craft.The flick begins with its most ingenious splatter scene. Sean Young gets a double barreled shotgun blast to the head, and we get to see through the head from the back, and then they cut to her still-functioning jaw and tongue among the gore as she hits the ground. I have to appreciate how much time and energy was probably spent on this FX for about ten seconds of footage. The story is predicated on the myth that we only use 10% of our brains, and then posits that the gate to ultimate knowledge is also literally the gate to hell. I'm not too keen on the obvious biblical overtone to this line of thinking, but there wouldn't be much of a horror genre if creators couldn't use these archetypes. You just have to suspend your disbelief.Anyway, Udo Kier makes an appearance as a priest, then gets his face ripped off, and that's the end of Udo. Last time I saw Udo, he was in a short horror anthology where he feeds his intestines into a movie projector. Hard to top that, but this is worth a rental.

964570,AGDD9T5BOHAOA,B000E0OE76,"Ruggero Deodato ""Where Has HORROR GONE""","[1, 2]","THIS IS A VERY GOOD INDIE HORROR MOVIE. GREAT GORE, ACTING AND A WONDERFUL STORYLINE. THIS IS A GREAT WATCH. THE OVER ALL FEEL TO THE MOVIE LOOKED INDIE BUT HELD A PUNCH WITH MAKE UP AND BLOOD AND VIOLENT CONTENT.THIS STORY STARTS OUT WITH A MOTHER GOING NUTS. TWO CHILDREN ARE THEN PUT INTO FOSTER CARE. YEARS LATER THE YOUNGEST SEEMS TO BE GOING THROUGH AN ORDEAL THAT HE AND THE MEDICAL FIELD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. HE IS ABLE TO LEARN AND READ BOOKS AND KNOW THINGS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO. IN SECONDS HE READS A BOOK. HE IS ABLE TO READ MINDS AND SEE IN THE PAST AND ALSO THE FUTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND HIM.HE IS HAUNTED AND CHASED DOWN BY DEMONS IN THE DARKNESS. PEOPLE AROUND HIM START TO DIE, CLAWED AND CHEWED AND DESTROYED BY THE CREATURES ONLY HE CAN SEE. HIS SPIRAL DOWN FALL IS CLOUDING HIS JUDGEMENT OF THINKING STRIGHT AS HIS HEAD SEEMS TO WANT TO EXPLODE.THIS MOVIE ITSELF IS DIRECTED VERY WELL AND THE OVER ALL HORROR FEEL AND WONDERFUL GORE AND BLOOD WORKS IN GREAT CAPTURED DETAIL. THE ONE FLAW I HAVE WITH THIS MOVIE IS THE CREATURE. I THINK WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS NEVER SHOW YOU IT, BECAUSE THE COSTUME WAS NOT THAT GOOD AND THAT IS WHY I HAD TO TAKE SOME POINTS AWAY FROM IT.  I WAS SO HAPPY WITH THIS LITTLE HORROR MOVIE UNTIL THAT MOMENT OF THE REVEAL WHICH LET ME DOWN.THE FIRST HOUR AND 20 MINS WORKED PERFECT, GREAT ACTING, GORE AND STORY BUT THE DOWN FALL TO THIS MOVIE WAS THE LAST 15 MIN'S WITH THE IMAGE OF THE CREATURE. TAKING THOSE FEW SHOTS OF THE CREATURE OUT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS MOVIE A 7 OUT OF 10 BUT BECAUSE OF THAT MAJOR LET DOWN I HAD TO RATE IT FARE.GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT STORY BUT FAILED IN THE END TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.5 OUT OF 10",2,SO GOOD YET FAILED,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,1697,"['THIS', 'VERY', 'GOOD', 'INDIE', 'HORROR', 'MOVIE', 'GREAT', 'GORE', 'ACTING', 'A', 'WONDERFUL', 'STORYLINE', 'THIS', 'GREAT', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'OVER', 'ALL', 'FEEL', 'TO', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'LOOKED', 'INDIE', 'BUT', 'HELD', 'A', 'PUNCH', 'WITH', 'MAKE', 'UP', 'AND', 'BLOOD', 'AND', 'VIOLENT', 'CONTENT.THIS', 'STORY', 'STARTS', 'OUT', 'WITH', 'A', 'MOTHER', 'GOING', 'NUTS', 'TWO', 'CHILDREN', 'ARE', 'THEN', 'PUT', 'INTO', 'FOSTER', 'CARE', 'LATER', 'THE', 'YOUNGEST', 'SEEMS', 'TO', 'BE', 'GOING', 'AN', 'ORDEAL', 'HE', 'THE', 'MEDICAL', 'FIELD', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'UNDERSTAND', 'HE', 'ABLE', 'TO', 'LEARN', 'AND', 'READ', 'BOOKS', 'AND', 'KNOW', 'THINGS', 'HE', 'SHOULD', 'NOT', 'BE', 'ABLE', 'TO', 'IN', 'SECONDS', 'HE', 'READS', 'A', 'BOOK', 'HE', 'ABLE', 'TO', 'READ', 'MINDS', 'AND', 'SEE', 'IN', 'THE', 'PAST', 'AND', 'ALSO', 'THE', 'FUTURE', 'OF', 'WHAT', 'IS', 'HAPPENING', 'AROUND', 'HIM.HE', 'IS', 'HAUNTED', 'AND', 'CHASED', 'DOWN', 'BY', 'DEMONS', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARKNESS', 'PEOPLE', 'AROUND', 'HIM', 'START', 'TO', 'DIE', 'CLAWED', 'AND', 'CHEWED', 'AND', 'DESTROYED', 'BY', 'THE', 'CREATURES', 'ONLY', 'HE', 'CAN', 'SEE', 'HIS', 'SPIRAL', 'DOWN', 'FALL', 'CLOUDING', 'HIS', 'JUDGEMENT', 'OF', 'THINKING', 'STRIGHT', 'HIS', 'HEAD', 'SEEMS', 'TO', 'WANT', 'TO', 'EXPLODE.THIS', 'MOVIE', 'ITSELF', 'IS', 'DIRECTED', 'VERY', 'WELL', 'THE', 'OVER', 'ALL', 'HORROR', 'FEEL', 'AND', 'WONDERFUL', 'GORE', 'AND', 'BLOOD', 'WORKS', 'IN', 'GREAT', 'CAPTURED', 'DETAIL', 'THE', 'ONE', 'FLAW', 'HAVE', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'CREATURE', 'THINK', 'WHAT', 'THEY', 'SHOULD', 'HAVE', 'DONE', 'WAS', 'NEVER', 'SHOW', 'IT', 'THE', 'COSTUME', 'WAS', 'NOT', 'THAT', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'THAT', 'WHY', 'HAD', 'TO', 'TAKE', 'SOME', 'POINTS', 'AWAY', 'IT', 'WAS', 'SO', 'HAPPY', 'WITH', 'THIS', 'LITTLE', 'HORROR', 'MOVIE', 'UNTIL', 'THAT', 'MOMENT', 'THE', 'REVEAL', 'WHICH', 'LET', 'ME', 'DOWN.THE', 'FIRST', 'HOUR', '20', 'MINS', 'WORKED', 'PERFECT', 'GREAT', 'ACTING', 'GORE', 'AND', 'STORY', 'BUT', 'THE', 'DOWN', 'FALL', 'TO', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'WAS', 'THE', 'LAST', '15', 'MIN', 'WITH', 'THE', 'IMAGE', 'THE', 'CREATURE', 'TAKING', 'THOSE', 'FEW', 'SHOTS', 'THE', 'CREATURE', 'OUT', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'GIVEN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'A', '7', 'OUT', '10', 'BUT', 'BECAUSE', 'THAT', 'MAJOR', 'LET', 'DOWN', 'HAD', 'TO', 'RATE', 'IT', 'FARE.GREAT', 'MOVIE', 'AND', 'GREAT', 'STORY', 'BUT', 'FAILED', 'IN', 'THE', 'END', 'TO', 'HOLD', 'IT', 'TOGETHER.5', 'OUT', '10']",N/A
