The Russians are awakened to wreak all sorts of havoc.ICE SOLDIERS seems promising at first, beginning with a very brief back-story-- which is actually much better than the front-story--to 1963, when tensions between America and Russia were at an all-time high. The filming is expertly done: This is not one of those super-amateurish Indies made on a $500 budget, nor is it--thank God!--another ""found footage"" affair. Though a little staid, over-rehearsed, and reminiscent of many 80s/90s thrillers, the acting, directions, and script are all pretty decent. The problem is that nothing particularly interesting happens here, mostly just a lot on the Americans/Canadians fighting it out with the renegade Russians, a bunch of tromping around in the snow, etc. Boorish and predictable for most of its length, ICE SOLDIERS degenerates to just plain silly and unintentionally (?) funny during its last 20-30 minutes.",2,"Pass the corn and pass the cheese, please",1394755200,"03 14, 2014",2014,1086,"['D+/68', '%', 'A', 'scientist', 'discovers', 'three', 'identical', 'blonde', 'Ivan', 'Drago-like', 'Russian', 'super-soldier', 'mutations', 'buried', 'state', 'cryogenic', 'slumber', 'snow', 'Canadian', 'north', 'Russians', 'are', 'awakened', 'wreak', 'sorts', 'havoc.ICE', 'SOLDIERS', 'promising', 'first', 'beginning', 'very', 'brief', 'back-story', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'front-story', '1963', 'when', 'tensions', 'America', 'Russia', 'were', 'all-time', 'high', 'filming', 'expertly', 'done', 'not', 'one', 'super-amateurish', 'Indies', 'made', '500', 'budget', 'thank', 'God', 'found', 'footage', 'affair', 'little', 'staid', 'over-rehearsed', 'reminiscent', 'many', '80s/90s', 'thrillers', 'acting', 'directions', 'script', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'problem', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'happens', 'here', 'mostly', 'just', 'lot', 'Americans/Canadians', 'fighting', 'renegade', 'Russians', 'bunch', 'tromping', 'around', 'snow', 'etc', 'Boorish', 'predictable', 'most', 'length', 'ICE', 'SOLDIERS', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'last', '20-30', 'minutes']",Ice Soldiers

I have to admit I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this going in. The beginning &#34;back-story&#34; part of the movie was both interesting and cheesy. The Russians send a group of genetically modified soldiers over here in order to win the Cold War during the Cuban Missile Crises.
