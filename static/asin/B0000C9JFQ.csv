774249,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000C9JFQ,A Customer,"[7, 14]","Summary:'Married With Children' was a hit comedy on Fox beginning in the late 1980s.  The series is about the incredibly dysfunctional Bundy family, Al (Ed O'Neill), Peggy (Katey Sagal), Kelly (Christina Applegate), and Bud (David Faustino), who, despite typifying everything marriage pundits claim is wrong with families today, somehow make things work.The first season does a good job of introducing the Bundys, as well as their neighbors, the D'Arcys, Marcy (Amanda Bearse) and Jefferson (Ted McGinley), and Al's womanizing co-worker, Steve (David Garrison).  I'd like to say the season advances some over-arching storyline, but that just wouldn't be accurate.  Not unlike many sitcoms that have followed in its wake, Married With Children has no pretense of an over-arching story.  This is just about the Bundy family's daily life, which, in itself, is funny enough to watch again and again.My Comments:I remember watching this show when I was in my teens and thinking it very funny then.  But watching it now, in my mid-twenties, with a little more life experience under my belt and after having been married for 4 years, I have to admit I find the series much funnier.  The only humor I really got when I first watched this episode came from Kelly and Bud, who really develop their humor in later seasons.  But with my new perspectives, Al and Peggy are really the best part of the show.  I also had no idea there were so many sexual innuendos; boy was I naive!As far as the acting goes, in this first season, Christina Applegate and David Faustino aren't very good.  Admittedly they were very young at the beginning; the numerous years spent working on the show is probably what helped them improve over time.  Also not very good in these first episodes was Amanda Bearse.  I'm inclined to think she improved over the course of the series as well.  Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal are pretty good.  I think they also improved, but they definitely started out several notches above everyone else.  Of course, part of me being impressed with them probably has to do with the fact I understand more of their jokes now than I used to, but even so, I was impressed.The only real problem I have with this DVD is the very poor picture quality.  Whoever made the decision to put all 13 episodes (at 23+ minutes a piece, that's well over 120 minutes per disc) on 2 discs must not have taken into consideration that this would mean compressing the footage quite extensively.  The result is a blocky picture - compression artifacts galore!  Also, there is no attempt to improve the sound quality as the series is only in Dolby Digital 2.0.  And, there are zero special features.Even with the picture and sound problems and no special features, this isn't a bad package because of the content.  It would have been nice to have remastered footage and sound and some commentaries or other extras, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.",3,Hilarious; poor picture quality; no extras,1071532800,"12 16, 2003",2003,2919,"['Summary', ""'Married"", 'Children', 'was', 'hit', 'comedy', 'Fox', 'beginning', 'late', '1980s', 'series', 'incredibly', 'dysfunctional', 'Bundy', 'family', 'Al', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Peggy', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'who', 'typifying', 'everything', 'marriage', 'pundits', 'claim', 'wrong', 'families', 'today', 'somehow', 'make', 'things', 'work.The', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'job', 'introducing', 'Bundys', 'as', 'well', 'neighbors', ""D'Arcys"", 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Jefferson', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'Al', 'womanizing', 'co-worker', 'Steve', 'David', 'Garrison', ""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'season', 'over-arching', 'storyline', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'accurate', 'Not', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'have', 'followed', 'wake', 'Married', 'Children', 'pretense', 'over-arching', 'story', 'just', 'Bundy', 'family', 'daily', 'life', 'funny', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'again.My', 'Comments', 'remember', 'watching', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'teens', 'thinking', 'very', 'funny', 'then', 'watching', 'now', 'mid-twenties', 'little', 'more', 'life', 'experience', 'belt', 'having', 'been', 'married', '4', 'years', 'have', 'admit', 'find', 'series', 'much', 'funnier', 'only', 'humor', 'really', 'got', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'episode', 'came', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'who', 'really', 'develop', 'humor', 'later', 'seasons', 'new', 'perspectives', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'are', 'really', 'best', 'part', 'show', 'also', 'had', 'idea', 'there', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'boy', 'was', 'naive', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'first', 'season', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'David', 'Faustino', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Admittedly', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'beginning', 'numerous', 'years', 'spent', 'working', 'show', 'probably', 'what', 'helped', 'improve', 'time', 'Also', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'first', 'episodes', 'was', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'think', 'improved', 'course', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'think', 'also', 'improved', 'definitely', 'started', 'out', 'several', 'notches', 'everyone', 'else', 'course', 'part', 'being', 'impressed', 'probably', 'do', 'fact', 'understand', 'more', 'jokes', 'now', 'used', 'even', 'so', 'was', 'impressed.The', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'have', 'DVD', 'very', 'poor', 'picture', 'quality', 'made', 'decision', 'put', '13', 'episodes', '23+', 'minutes', 'piece', 'well', '120', 'minutes', 'disc', '2', 'discs', 'must', 'not', 'have', 'taken', 'consideration', 'would', 'mean', 'compressing', 'footage', 'quite', 'extensively', 'result', 'blocky', 'picture', 'compression', 'galore', 'Also', 'attempt', 'improve', 'sound', 'quality', 'series', 'only', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '2.0', 'are', 'zero', 'special', 'features.Even', 'picture', 'sound', 'problems', 'special', 'features', ""n't"", 'bad', 'package', 'content', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'remastered', 'footage', 'sound', 'commentaries', 'other', 'extras', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be']",N/A

But lately I discovered the complete first season on a DVD, and I decided to have just only this one! I thought, that since that was a beginning in a series of spectacular seasons, then it should have been definitely one of the best. Because lots of energies and efforts were given both by actors and the authors to make this new show popular so that it could win its audience in the late 80th. I bought this DVD and I am very happy about it. I enjoyed each single scene, each phrase and each pulled face. And I laughed a lot! This season is packed with 100% smart and witty jokes that worth to remember and cite!Quality of the picture is just alright for 1987. I am glad it was not digitally re-mastered, otherwise it would lose the touch and the charm of the late 80th. Besides, re-mastering of a 302-minute show would make this DVD cost a fortune!On the other hand, the quality of DVD's sound, which is Stereo Dolby Digital, is superb. First time I watched this show on TV dubbed in Russian and I couldn't really assess sound quality of original dialogues. But now, after I bought this DVD, I can tell you - sound is just great.

On April 5,1987,the Fox network was born and this megahit sitcom premiered. Not only that,the first 3 episodes of ""Married...With Children"" aired. The first three episodes of ""The Tracey Ullman Show"",which premiered the same night,followed each MWC episode one by one. Ed O'Neill and Katey Sagal are Al and Peg Bundy with two children named Kelly and Bud(Christina Applegate and David Faustino). The Bundys are nothing like the Bunkers,the Bradys,the Huxtables or even the Conners. Al is a shoe salesman in a shopping mall and Peg is a housewife with on-and-off employment. Kelly is a fifteen-year-old attractive high-schooler who is dyslexic and incredibly dumb. Thirteen-year-old Bud still has not lost his boyish vocals. Kelly and Bud are often vocally at war with each other and Bud often teases Kelly. The Bundys' neighbors are newlyweds Steve and Marcy Rhoades(David Garrison and Amanda Bearse). They occasionally frown upon Al just like Peggy,Kelly and Bud. This ... family became so popular they delighted viewers for another 10 years. Garrison left MWC in 1990 and was replaced by Ted McGinley of ""Happy Days"" fame. When McGinley joined,Steve and Marcy were divorced and Marcy would later marry McGinley's character,Jefferson D'Arcy,who stuck with her through the series' demise. This series was created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt who also created NBC's short-lived ""It's Your Move"",which Garrison was also on.",5,Love & Marriage,1080000000,"03 23, 2004",2004,1550,"['Love', 'marriage', 'go', 'together', 'horse', 'carriage', 'sang', 'late', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', '1955', 'hit', 'song', 'LOVE', 'MARRIAGE', 'April', '5,1987', 'Fox', 'network', 'was', 'born', 'megahit', 'sitcom', 'premiered', 'Not', 'only', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'Married', 'Children', 'aired', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Show', 'premiered', 'same', 'night', 'followed', 'MWC', 'episode', 'one', 'one', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'are', 'Al', 'Peg', 'Bundy', 'two', 'children', 'named', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'David', 'Faustino', 'Bundys', 'are', 'nothing', 'Bunkers', 'Bradys', 'Huxtables', 'even', 'Conners', 'Al', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'shopping', 'mall', 'Peg', 'housewife', 'on-and-off', 'employment', 'Kelly', 'fifteen-year-old', 'attractive', 'high-schooler', 'who', 'dyslexic', 'incredibly', 'dumb', 'Thirteen-year-old', 'Bud', 'still', 'not', 'lost', 'boyish', 'vocals', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'are', 'often', 'vocally', 'war', 'other', 'Bud', 'often', 'Kelly', 'Bundys', 'neighbors', 'are', 'newlyweds', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'Rhoades', 'David', 'Garrison', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'occasionally', 'frown', 'upon', 'Al', 'just', 'Peggy', 'Kelly', 'Bud', 'family', 'became', 'so', 'popular', 'delighted', 'viewers', '10', 'years', 'Garrison', 'left', 'MWC', '1990', 'was', 'replaced', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'Happy', 'Days', 'fame', 'When', 'McGinley', 'joined', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'were', 'divorced', 'Marcy', 'would', 'later', 'marry', 'McGinley', 'character', 'Jefferson', ""D'Arcy"", 'who', 'stuck', 'series', 'demise', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'Michael', 'G.', 'Moye', 'Ron', 'Leavitt', 'who', 'also', 'created', 'NBC', 'short-lived', 'Your', 'Move', 'Garrison', 'was', 'also']",N/A
774254,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000C9JFQ,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[4, 4]","The date was April 5, 1987. The day that TV and the way we see TV families was changed. At this point, we had 35 years or so of family comedies that showed us parents who had good jobs, always had a word of advice, upstanding kids, a nice car, a nice house, and had good neighbors in a nice neighborhood. Not that that is bad, 'cause I love some of those myself, but viewers were in need of a change. A show called ""Married With Children"" came along and showed us how the other half lived. The head of the household was dad Al, who was played by Ed'O'Neill. Alwas a schlumpy loser in life who has a dead end job working in a women's shoe store. Spent his time daydreaming of his glory back in his youth. Wife Peg(Katey Sagal)consisted of big red hair, spandex, bon bons, and an addiction to Oprah and the couch. The kids were Kelly(Christina Applegate), a blonde airhead who flunked lunch and gave out her special kind of love all over the town. Son Bud(David Faustino)was the closest to normal of the bunch. Smart, did well in school, but was sly and sneaky and a loser in love. The neighbors were Steve And Marcy(David Garrison and Amanda Bearse), uppity ups who both worked in banks. And thus, the show was set in motion. This collection has the 13 episodes from the show's first season, which was a mid season replacement kind of thing. The pilot is basically a set up of The Bundy's meeting the new neighbors(and by the way, Garrison left during the 4th season after getting a role in a stage play), and displaying the show's nasty brand of humor. There were a lot of great moments in season one, but it was the first season, and you can tell they were trying to find their feet and their way. ""Thinnergy"" sees Peg going on a diet and her trying to get the rest of the family to join in. ""But I Didn't Shoot The Deputy"", one of the best first season eps, sees The Bundy's and The Rhoades getting a gun and a dog after a series of break ins, which leads to an unfortunate accident. ""Whose Room Is It Anyway?"" is a forgetful episode about Al and Peg picking what room they want Steve and Marcy to add onto their house. ""Have You Driven A Ford Lately?"" has Al and Steve restoring a 1965 Mustang, and ignoring the wives in the process. Al and Peg celebrate their anniversary in ""Sixteen Years And What Do You Get"", and leave the kids with Steve and Marcy(uh oh) in the season one stand out ep, ""Married...Without Children"". A good one. ""The Poker Game"", ""Peggy Sue Got Work"", and ""Al Loses His Cherry"", all fine episodes, but nothing earth shattering. Another season one classic is ""Nightmare On Al's Street"", which finds Marcy having sexual fantasies about Al while Steve is out of town. ""Where's The Boss"" is a file and forget it episode about Al's never seen boss, and the season ends with the episode, ""Johnny Be Gone"", a one long scene episode dealing with Al and Peg trying to get to their favorite food joint before it closes forever, but the kids' problems keep getting in the way and stalling them. The show did a lot of things really well and they never got some of the credit they deserved. Ed 'O'Neill was a fine comedic actor, and he did some nice character work with Al over the years. However, you can easily tell from the start of this season that Al was a tad different. 'O'Neill spoke in the first episode or two like Al was some tough guy from the Bronx. Sagal was a teriffic comedic actress as well. Same goes for Applegate and Faustino. The Bundy's were a family that never held anything in. I think that was one of the founding reasons the world embraced them. They spoke and acted in ways that maybe we have thought of doing ourselves but never did. It was a great show to watch to get away from the world and watch characters who let it all out and didn't care. They may of been a little too extreme at times to be like any real family, but they addressed people all over the world who didn't have the perfect family and the greatest of upbringings. The show, throughout the years, always stayed on top of the times and made it seem like it could last forever. Anyways, season one is a wonderful beginner's guide to the world of The Bundy clan from Chicago. The special features are dysmal and kind of ruin what really is a great collection. You get the reunion special that they had a year or so ago and that's about it. This collection still gets the full five stars because I'm reviewing the show. Great show with good to great episodes and is truly wonderful. The full five stars there, but one and a half stars for the special features.",5,The Bundy Bunch,1071619200,"12 17, 2003",2003,4566,"['date', 'was', 'April', '5', '1987', 'day', 'TV', 'way', 'see', 'TV', 'families', 'was', 'changed', 'point', 'had', '35', 'years', 'so', 'family', 'comedies', 'showed', 'parents', 'who', 'had', 'good', 'jobs', 'always', 'had', 'word', 'advice', 'upstanding', 'kids', 'nice', 'car', 'nice', 'house', 'had', 'good', 'neighbors', 'nice', 'neighborhood', 'Not', 'bad', 'love', 'viewers', 'were', 'need', 'change', 'show', 'called', 'Married', 'Children', 'came', 'along', 'showed', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'lived', 'head', 'household', 'was', 'dad', 'Al', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Alwas', 'schlumpy', 'loser', 'life', 'who', 'dead', 'end', 'job', 'working', 'women', 'shoe', 'store', 'Spent', 'time', 'daydreaming', 'glory', 'back', 'youth', 'Wife', 'Peg', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'consisted', 'big', 'red', 'hair', 'spandex', 'bon', 'bons', 'addiction', 'Oprah', 'couch', 'kids', 'were', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'blonde', 'airhead', 'who', 'flunked', 'lunch', 'gave', 'out', 'special', 'kind', 'love', 'town', 'Son', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'was', 'closest', 'normal', 'bunch', 'Smart', 'did', 'well', 'school', 'was', 'sly', 'sneaky', 'loser', 'love', 'neighbors', 'were', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'David', 'Garrison', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'uppity', 'ups', 'who', 'worked', 'banks', 'thus', 'show', 'was', 'set', 'motion', 'collection', '13', 'episodes', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'mid', 'season', 'replacement', 'kind', 'thing', 'pilot', 'basically', 'set', 'Bundy', 'meeting', 'new', 'neighbors', 'way', 'Garrison', 'left', '4th', 'season', 'getting', 'role', 'stage', 'play', 'displaying', 'show', 'nasty', 'brand', 'humor', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'moments', 'season', 'one', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'feet', 'way', 'Thinnergy', 'Peg', 'going', 'diet', 'trying', 'get', 'rest', 'family', 'join', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Shoot', 'Deputy', 'one', 'best', 'first', 'season', 'eps', 'Bundy', 'Rhoades', 'getting', 'gun', 'dog', 'series', 'break', 'ins', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'Whose', 'Room', 'Anyway', 'forgetful', 'episode', 'Al', 'Peg', 'picking', 'what', 'room', 'want', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'add', 'house', 'Have', 'Driven', 'Ford', 'Lately', 'Al', 'Steve', 'restoring', '1965', 'Mustang', 'ignoring', 'wives', 'process', 'Al', 'Peg', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'Sixteen', 'Years', 'What', 'Do', 'Get', 'leave', 'kids', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'uh', 'oh', 'season', 'one', 'stand', 'ep', 'Married', 'Children', 'good', 'one', 'Poker', 'Game', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Work', 'Al', 'Cherry', 'fine', 'episodes', 'nothing', 'earth', 'shattering', 'season', 'one', 'classic', 'Nightmare', 'Al', 'Street', 'Marcy', 'having', 'sexual', 'fantasies', 'Al', 'Steve', 'town', 'Where', 'Boss', 'file', 'forget', 'episode', 'Al', 'never', 'seen', 'boss', 'season', 'episode', 'Johnny', 'Be', 'Gone', 'one', 'long', 'scene', 'episode', 'dealing', 'Al', 'Peg', 'trying', 'get', 'favorite', 'food', 'joint', 'forever', 'kids', 'problems', 'keep', 'getting', 'way', 'stalling', 'show', 'did', 'lot', 'things', 'really', 'well', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'deserved', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'was', 'fine', 'comedic', 'actor', 'did', 'nice', 'character', 'work', 'Al', 'years', 'However', 'can', 'easily', 'tell', 'start', 'season', 'Al', 'was', 'tad', 'different', ""O'Neill"", 'spoke', 'first', 'episode', 'two', 'Al', 'was', 'tough', 'guy', 'Bronx', 'Sagal', 'was', 'teriffic', 'comedic', 'actress', 'as', 'well', 'Same', 'Applegate', 'Faustino', 'Bundy', 'were', 'family', 'never', 'held', 'anything', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'founding', 'reasons', 'world', 'embraced', 'spoke', 'acted', 'ways', 'maybe', 'have', 'thought', 'doing', 'ourselves', 'never', 'did', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'watch', 'get', 'away', 'world', 'watch', 'characters', 'who', 'let', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'may', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'extreme', 'times', 'be', 'real', 'family', 'addressed', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'perfect', 'family', 'greatest', 'upbringings', 'show', 'years', 'always', 'stayed', 'top', 'times', 'made', 'seem', 'could', 'last', 'forever', 'Anyways', 'season', 'one', 'wonderful', 'beginner', 'guide', 'world', 'Bundy', 'clan', 'Chicago', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'dysmal', 'kind', 'ruin', 'what', 'really', 'great', 'collection', 'get', 'reunion', 'special', 'had', 'year', 'so', 'ago', 'collection', 'still', 'full', 'five', 'stars', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'show', 'Great', 'show', 'good', 'great', 'episodes', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'there', 'one', 'half', 'stars', 'special', 'features']",N/A
774255,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B0000C9JFQ,Ben Rowland,"[6, 7]","Being a child of the 80's, it was hard to miss all the wonderful sitcoms on television. I still vividly remember watching ""Married...With Children"" every Sunday night, and I feverishly looked forward to each new episode. In the years since then, I have seen all the episodes many times in reruns, and I am now glad to own them (at least the first season) on DVD. It is one of the few shows I have never gotten tired of.The first season is rarely the strongest in the series, but the first season of ""Married..."" has quite a few gems. The second episode, ""Thinnergy"", has Peggy putting the family on a crash diet, with Al obviously disapproving. The dinner scene always cracked me up, especially Al's sarcasm when he tosses out the salad. Another excellent episode was ""Where's The Boss"", where Al threatens to quit his job at the shoe store unless his boss meets him and commends him on his work. It has the first of the classic ""fat woman"" jokes (""Madame, when Shamu needs a mate...you'll be there!""). But my favorite episode is the season finale, ""Johnny B. Gone"", where the kid's problems prevent Al and Peggy from going to the closing of their favorite restaurant. Seeing Marcy in a towel and Al making fun of her (""Here's a mystery...what's holding that towel up?"") never dulls.The first season contained 13 episodes, which you'll go through pretty quickly. My hope is that the second and third seasons find their way onto DVD soon.The DVD package is light on the extras (most TV show DVD sets are), but there is one main attraction. The much-lauded ""Reunion"" special in 2003 is included here, which is a must have for fans. While is provides nothing of real substance, it is fun to see the cast out of their element, reminiscing about their experiences on the show. The only drawback to this is that very little is touched upon about the show's cultural impact in the 80's, which was not inconsiderable for the series. It is just a fun reunion of the cast, nothing more. Sadly, they did not include the E! True Hollywood Story that was done on the show. It would have been a prize addition to the set.While better episodes were to come in later seasons, the first season is still very solid, and should satisfy fans of the series waiting for a proper release. And with the addition of the Reunion Special, it is a must have for fans of the series.

774256,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000C9JFQ,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 4]","First premiering in April 1987, Married With Children became a staple of the growing Fox Network's original prime time programming, paving the way for further original creations such as The Simpsons. The total opposite of what a TV family should be, the original working title for the show was Not The Cosbys (a reference to the perfect family atmosphere of the popular 80's sitcom The Cosby Show). Paving the way for ABC's Roseanne, Married With Children more than lived up to its working title, chronicling the pathetic life of a Chicago shoe salesman and his equally dysfunctional family...Married With Children follows the exploits of the Bundy family, a dysfunctional trailer-park trash family living in American suburbia. The family is headed by Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), a shoe salesman who's lewd, crude, sarcastic, and completely dissatisfied with his life as a loser. Al's wife Peg (Katey Sagal) spends her days watching Oprah and spending what little money Al brings home (she's also Al's greatest source of annoyance). Al and Peg's lives are complicated by their children, Kelly (Christina Applegate), a beautiful yet stupid teenager, and Bud (David Faustino), a sex-starved adolescent. With neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse), and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) dropping in on a regular basis, Al's dreams of a normal family life or a spare moment to relax are continually interrupted by the tortuous reality of his mediocre existence...The Married With Children (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series pilot in which Peg and Al, worried because they have no friends of their own, meet the new neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhoades. Steve and Marcy have the perfect marriage, but the bad influences of the Bundys conspire to turn them against each other... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Whose Room is It Anyway?"" in which Steve and Marcy decide to add a new room onto their house while Peg and Al pit the couple against each other in order to serve their own selfish interests, and ""Peggy Sue Got Work"" in which Al's refusal to buy Peg the VCR she wants prompts her to get a job in a local department store...Below is a list of episodes included on the Married With Children (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (Thinnergy)Episode 3 (But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy)Episode 4 (Whose Room is it Anyway?)Episode 5 (Have You Driven a Ford Lately)Episode 6 (Sixteen Years and What Do You Get)Episode 7 (Married... Without Children)Episode 8 (The Poker Game)Episode 9 (Peggy Sue Got Work)Episode 10 (Al Loses His Cherry)Episode 11 (Nightmare on Al's Street)Episode 12 (Where's the Boss)Episode 13 (Johnny Be Gone)The DVD Report",5,The definition of dysfunctional family...,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,2699,"['First', 'premiering', 'April', '1987', 'Married', 'Children', 'became', 'staple', 'growing', 'Fox', 'Network', 'original', 'prime', 'time', 'programming', 'paving', 'way', 'further', 'original', 'creations', 'such', 'Simpsons', 'total', 'opposite', 'what', 'TV', 'family', 'should', 'be', 'original', 'working', 'title', 'show', 'was', 'Not', 'Cosbys', 'reference', 'perfect', 'family', 'atmosphere', 'popular', '80', 'sitcom', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Paving', 'way', 'ABC', 'Roseanne', 'Married', 'Children', 'more', 'lived', 'up', 'working', 'title', 'chronicling', 'pathetic', 'life', 'Chicago', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'equally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Married', 'Children', 'exploits', 'Bundy', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'trailer-park', 'trash', 'family', 'living', 'American', 'suburbia', 'family', 'headed', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'shoe', 'salesman', 'who', 'lewd', 'crude', 'sarcastic', 'completely', 'dissatisfied', 'life', 'loser', 'Al', 'wife', 'Peg', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'days', 'watching', 'Oprah', 'spending', 'what', 'little', 'money', 'Al', 'home', 'also', 'Al', 'greatest', 'source', 'annoyance', 'Al', 'Peg', 'lives', 'are', 'complicated', 'children', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'stupid', 'teenager', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'sex-starved', 'adolescent', 'neighbors', 'Steve', 'David', 'Garrison', 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Jefferson', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'dropping', 'regular', 'basis', 'Al', 'dreams', 'normal', 'family', 'life', 'spare', 'moment', 'relax', 'are', 'continually', 'interrupted', 'tortuous', 'reality', 'mediocre', 'existence', 'Married', 'Children', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'series', 'pilot', 'Peg', 'Al', 'worried', 'have', 'friends', 'own', 'meet', 'new', 'neighbors', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'Rhoades', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'have', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'bad', 'influences', 'Bundys', 'conspire', 'turn', 'other', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Whose', 'Room', 'Anyway', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'decide', 'add', 'new', 'room', 'house', 'Peg', 'Al', 'pit', 'couple', 'other', 'order', 'serve', 'own', 'selfish', 'interests', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Work', 'Al', 'refusal', 'buy', 'Peg', 'VCR', 'prompts', 'get', 'job', 'local', 'department', 'store', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Married', 'Children', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Pilot', 'Episode', '2', 'Thinnergy', 'Episode', '3', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Shoot', 'Deputy', 'Episode', '4', 'Whose', 'Room', 'Anyway', 'Episode', '5', 'Have', 'Driven', 'Ford', 'Lately', 'Episode', '6', 'Sixteen', 'Years', 'What', 'Do', 'Get', 'Episode', '7', 'Married', 'Children', 'Episode', '8', 'Poker', 'Game', 'Episode', '9', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Work', 'Episode', '10', 'Al', 'Cherry', 'Episode', '11', 'Nightmare', 'Al', 'Street', 'Episode', '12', 'Where', 'Boss', 'Episode', '13', 'Johnny', 'Be', 'Gone', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

One of my favorite moments from the first season is when Al shoots Marcy and Steve's new dog and Steve has to describe how he knows the dog is dead. Hear Al shout ""Freeze creep!"" is hilarious on its own.What makes this season so interesting is that it has a different take on their daughter Kelly. She isn't as dumb as she eventually becomes, and is more like a spoiled brat. It being only 13 episodes is the only downside about this DVD.

My rating of this first season DVD is not of the show itself by any means, it is of the poor overall DVD package.  We fans deserve better than what those who owned the rights to this show have delivered.  They rely on the fact that this show has a huge fan base and that we will buy this DVD regardless of the fact that it comes with no commentaries or any special features except for the Married With Children Reunion Special which was filmed a substantial number of years before this was put on DVD I might add.  We also only get half of that special anyway, David Garrison (who played Steve) tells us we'll be right back after the break only that is when it ends, they don't come back at all.  You can't help but feel a little bit, well a lot ripped off!How hard of expensive would it have been to grab at least one of the actors for each episode to commentate with some behind the scenes person as well? I don't think I've even watched a DVD with a TV show's pilot that doesn't at least have commentary for that episode. It would not have cost or taken much time but those who owned the rights couldn't be bothered.  For shame! Viewers might as well have taped these when they aired on TV and watch them on your old video player as there's no advantage to owning the DVD.Season one aired with 13 episodes and even though most classic Bundy moments come from later seasons, season one is certainly worth watching.  In season one most of the on air time revolved around Al and Peggy and to a lesser degree their newly wed neighbours Steve and Marcy.  Bud and Kelly are of course here but obviously being younger child actors they didn't appear much so there characters aren't as well developed as they will be in later seasons.  Bud even has friends in this season and is certainly a lot cooler than he will be as he gets older and even Kelly isn't as bimboish as she will later become.  Other aspects of the Bundy life that will change in future seasons are that the Bundys have food in the house, Al is not interested in sleeping with other women when given the opportunity and there are also other staff at the shoe store who will change in future seasons.  There are classic lines such as in the pilot Al telling Steve if I wanted people to know what I was thinking, I'd be talking to them"".Hopefully with future seasons those who own the rights give a bit more respect to the show which boldly turned TV on its head in an era of the what did we learn today family shows. It pioneered the way for later dysfunctional family shows such as The Simpsons, Roseanne, Malcolm in the Middle and My Name is Earl and much more respect should given to this great important in TV history show when putting it on DVD!",3,Disappointing Respect and Appreciation Shown for Fans With Lack of Special Features,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,2820,"['Married', 'Children', 'was', 'favourite', 'show', 'kid', 'today', 'would', 'still', 'rate', 'top', 'five', 'time', 'rating', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'not', 'show', 'means', 'poor', 'overall', 'DVD', 'package', 'fans', 'deserve', 'better', 'what', 'who', 'owned', 'rights', 'show', 'have', 'delivered', 'rely', 'fact', 'show', 'huge', 'fan', 'base', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'regardless', 'fact', 'commentaries', 'special', 'features', 'Married', 'Children', 'Reunion', 'Special', 'was', 'filmed', 'substantial', 'number', 'years', 'was', 'put', 'DVD', 'might', 'add', 'also', 'only', 'get', 'half', 'special', 'anyway', 'David', 'Garrison', 'who', 'played', 'Steve', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', 'break', 'only', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'well', 'lot', 'ripped', 'off', 'How', 'hard', 'expensive', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'grab', 'least', 'one', 'actors', 'episode', 'commentate', 'scenes', 'person', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'even', 'watched', 'DVD', 'TV', 'show', 'pilot', ""n't"", 'least', 'have', 'commentary', 'episode', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'cost', 'taken', 'much', 'time', 'who', 'owned', 'rights', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'shame', 'Viewers', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'taped', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'watch', 'old', 'video', 'player', 'advantage', 'owning', 'DVD.Season', 'one', 'aired', '13', 'episodes', 'even', 'most', 'classic', 'Bundy', 'moments', 'come', 'later', 'seasons', 'season', 'one', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching', 'season', 'one', 'most', 'air', 'time', 'revolved', 'Al', 'Peggy', 'lesser', 'degree', 'newly', 'wed', 'neighbours', 'Steve', 'Marcy', 'Bud', 'Kelly', 'are', 'course', 'here', 'obviously', 'being', 'younger', 'child', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'well', 'developed', 'will', 'be', 'later', 'seasons', 'Bud', 'even', 'friends', 'season', 'certainly', 'lot', 'cooler', 'will', 'be', 'older', 'even', 'Kelly', ""n't"", 'as', 'bimboish', 'will', 'later', 'become', 'Other', 'aspects', 'Bundy', 'life', 'will', 'change', 'future', 'seasons', 'are', 'Bundys', 'have', 'food', 'house', 'Al', 'not', 'interested', 'sleeping', 'other', 'women', 'when', 'given', 'opportunity', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'staff', 'shoe', 'store', 'who', 'will', 'change', 'future', 'seasons', 'are', 'classic', 'lines', 'such', 'pilot', 'Al', 'telling', 'Steve', 'wanted', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'be', 'talking', '.Hopefully', 'future', 'seasons', 'who', 'own', 'rights', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'respect', 'show', 'boldly', 'turned', 'TV', 'head', 'era', 'what', 'did', 'learn', 'today', 'family', 'pioneered', 'way', 'later', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'shows', 'such', 'Simpsons', 'Roseanne', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'My', 'Name', 'Earl', 'much', 'more', 'respect', 'should', 'given', 'great', 'important', 'TV', 'history', 'show', 'when', 'putting', 'DVD']",N/A

Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill)-Father, shoe salesmen, who despises his wife, his kids, and his life.2. Peg Bundy (Katey Segal)-Mother, unemployed. Despises her husband, loves her T.V.3. Kelly Bundy (Christina Applegate)-Daughter, alleged slut. Really stupid and hates her family.4. Bud Bundy (David Faustino)-Son. Smartest member of family.And their next door neighbors Marcy (Amanda Bearse) and Steve (David Garrison) who hate the family...The feelings mutual. Chances are you know all that stuff by now. Anyway, this first season is first rate. The episodes itself, I'm not referring to the bonus features. All episodes are great (some are better than others though), the picture and sound quality is great...Any fan of Married With Children should be quite pleased. Here's the episodes and some comments:1. Pilot-The pilot episode is great. It introduces the Bundy  family and the neighbors Marcie and Steve nicely. It's hilarious.2. Thinergy-Another great episode, although they're still spending time on character development.3. Sixteen Years and What Do You Get-Has some great one-liners, but it's not one of my favorite episodes.4. But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy-Very funny. Al accidentally shoots Marcie's dog. Priceless episode.5. Have You Driven a Ford Lately?-Saying this is funny is pointless. They're all funny. This one, however, is hysterical.6. Whose Room is it Anyway?-Another great episode involving Marcie and Steve's plans to build an extra room and Al & Peg trying to sway each of them to what kind of room it shall be.7. Al Loses His Cherry-Totally cool episode, don't mistake the innuendo in the title for what you're no doubt thinking.8. Peggy Sue Got Work-Peg gets a job. This is one of the funniest episodes. Although, they're all funny.9. Married...Without Children-I think it ended to abruptly, but other than that...This episode is great.10. The Poker Game-I can't say anything about this episode, I didn't say about the others. It's absolutely hilarious!11. Where's the Boss-This episode has some of the best (and highest number of) one-liners. The stupid security guard is classic.12. Nightmare on Al's Street-One of the greatest lines in MWC history. ""I'm horny Al, what are you going to do about it?""13. Johnny B. Gone-This episode is not one of the best on here.GRADE: A",5,Married...With Children,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,2530,"['One', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'T.V', 'history', 'Married', 'Children', 'DVD', 'releases', '5th', 'Season', 'most', 'recent', 'releases', 'Here', 'have', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'introduced', 'infamous', 'Bundy', 'clan.They', 'are:1', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", '-Father', 'shoe', 'salesmen', 'who', 'wife', 'kids', 'life.2', 'Peg', 'Bundy', 'Katey', 'Segal', '-Mother', 'unemployed', 'husband', 'T.V.3', 'Kelly', 'Bundy', 'Christina', 'Applegate', '-Daughter', 'alleged', 'slut', 'Really', 'stupid', 'family.4', 'Bud', 'Bundy', 'David', 'Faustino', '-Son', 'Smartest', 'member', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'Marcy', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'Steve', 'David', 'Garrison', 'who', 'hate', 'family', 'feelings', 'mutual', 'Chances', 'are', 'know', 'stuff', 'now', 'Anyway', 'first', 'season', 'first', 'rate', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'not', 'referring', 'bonus', 'features', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'great', 'fan', 'Married', 'Children', 'should', 'be', 'quite', 'pleased', 'Here', 'episodes', 'comments:1', 'Pilot-The', 'pilot', 'episode', 'great', 'Bundy', 'family', 'neighbors', 'Marcie', 'Steve', 'nicely', 'hilarious.2', 'Thinergy-Another', 'great', 'episode', ""'re"", 'still', 'spending', 'time', 'character', 'development.3', 'Sixteen', 'Years', 'What', 'Do', 'Get-Has', 'great', 'one-liners', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes.4', 'Did', ""n't"", 'Shoot', 'Deputy-Very', 'funny', 'Al', 'accidentally', 'Marcie', 'dog', 'Priceless', 'episode.5', 'Have', 'Driven', 'Ford', 'Lately', '-Saying', 'funny', 'pointless', ""'re"", 'funny', 'one', 'however', 'hysterical.6', 'Whose', 'Room', 'Anyway', '-Another', 'great', 'episode', 'involving', 'Marcie', 'Steve', 'plans', 'build', 'extra', 'room', 'Al', 'Peg', 'trying', 'sway', 'what', 'kind', 'room', 'shall', 'be.7', 'Al', 'Cherry-Totally', 'cool', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'innuendo', 'title', 'what', ""'re"", 'doubt', 'thinking.8', 'Peggy', 'Sue', 'Got', 'Work-Peg', 'job', 'one', 'funniest', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'funny.9', 'Married', 'Children-I', 'think', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'other', 'episode', 'great.10', 'Poker', 'Game-I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'others', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', '11', 'Where', 'Boss-This', 'episode', 'best', 'highest', 'number', 'one-liners', 'stupid', 'security', 'guard', 'classic.12', 'Nightmare', 'Al', 'Street-One', 'greatest', 'lines', 'MWC', 'history', ""'m"", 'horny', 'Al', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'do', '13', 'Johnny', 'B.', 'Gone-This', 'episode', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'here.GRADE']",N/A

Considered one of the raunchiest and most vulgar shows in its time, these 13 glorious episodes are here for your viewing pleasure for the very first time on DVD.  These guys ain't the Cosbys, that's for sure.The show revolves around a shoe-salesman, Al Bundy, and his lovely (lovely??) family.  His wife is always on his case about money and refuses to clean or cook the house.  The kids are always driving him up the wall with their constant bickering and getting into trouble.  The only sane one in the family appears to be sane is the dog (although he doesn't really do much).  Yep, it's ""Home, Sweet Hell"" for Al Bundy all day, every day.  You can just feel the love.I forgot how funny the first season was.  I don't think a second went by where I wasn't laughing hysterically at the Bundy hijinx that was occurring in each episode.  Personally, I think Al Bundy has some of the funniest lines ever.  All 13 episodes are some of the funniest TV you'll ever see.  It's nice to finally see them earn a home in the DVD world.Here are the 13 episodes that are included in this set:""Pilot,"" ""Thinergy,"" ""Sixteen Years and What Do You Get,"" ""But I Didn't Shoot the Deputy,"" ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately,"" ""Whose Room is it Anyway,"" ""Al Loses his Cherry,"" ""Peggy Sue Got Work,"" ""Married&#65533; Without Children,"" ""The Poker Game,"" ""Where's the Boss,"" ""Nightmare on Al's Street,"" and ""Johnny B. Gone.""This 2-disk DVD set also includes extra features like bonus trailers and the ""Married with Children Reunion Special"" that aired on FOX awhile back.

I was dissapointed with those previous releases as I felt there were much better episodes, but that is okay. The first season was hit or miss on a few episodes, but has some of the best episodes as well. Yes, the picture quality isn't enhanced but so what? its still the show, and it is better than a vhs dub that you make off of fx or whatever channel has it in syndication. I hope that these releases are successful, because seasons 3,4, and 5 are also chalk full of classics. The best on these disc's has to be the one where Al and Peggy are trying to go to the closing of Al's favorite burger joint. The part where Al is helping Bud fix his remote control car is classic!

And the episodes where Al tried to help Steve re-discover his manhood were the best.  Episodes like where Al and Steve played poker in a bank vault, when Al and Steve worked to restore a Mustang car, or the classic ""period"" episode where all 3 women on the show had their times of the month at the same time and made life for the men miserable on a camping trip.I quit watching the show a couple of years after David Garrison left the show because the episodes had lost their dark humor.  Jefferson D'Arcy was too much of a pretty boy and a whiner.  The one really good episode featuring Jefferson was the one where the Bundys and the D'Arcys competed in a supermarket shopping spree.It's good to see that Married With Children is finally coming to home video.
