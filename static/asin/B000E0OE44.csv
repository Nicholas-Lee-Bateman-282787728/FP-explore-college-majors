964474,A3GPL5JEP3G1VS,B000E0OE44,,"[0, 2]","""Paradise Now"" is a wonderful foreign film about two Palestinian men who hesitate on carrying out a terrorist attack in Israel. The story is pretty well thought out, the scenery is lovely, and the ending is definitely an interesting one. And while it does imply violent situations, you do not actually see any on the screen. This movie should be seen by any fan of foreign movies.A few reviewers criticized the movie because they thought the movie promoted terrorism. While everyone has a right to feel however they would like, I personally didn't think the makers of the film wanted to encourage people to engage in suicide bombings to fight for what they believe in. There are hundreds of movies out there about drugs, rapes, and underground criminal activity, but I don't think any of them actually promotes its viewers to go out and mimic the characters' bad behaviors. You can even tell the main character, Said, was having second thoughts about going through with the bombing, because he saw an innocent, young child on the bus and realized it would be morally wrong to kill him. Furthermore, if the movie was pro-terrorism, the character Suha wouldn't have urged the men to abort the mission, reasoning that if they carry out the attack, it will just give Israel more reason to keep Palestinians under their thumb. I identified with Suha's character, and this movie didn't justify terrorist attacks to me.What this movie did do was make me think critically about the issue, and hopefully it will do the same for you. If the men had more economic opportunities, for instance, cost-benefit analysis would have stopped them from planning to blow themselves up. If the Palestinians had their own army, underground operations like those would be much less common.I think the movie could have done a better job showing more examples of the injustice the men were fighting against, but otherwise it was a great movie.",5,"Doesn't promote terrorism, but does promote critical thinking",1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,1917,"['Paradise', 'Now', 'wonderful', 'foreign', 'film', 'two', 'Palestinian', 'men', 'who', 'hesitate', 'carrying', 'out', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Israel', 'story', 'pretty', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'ending', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'one', 'imply', 'violent', 'situations', 'do', 'not', 'actually', 'see', 'screen', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'fan', 'foreign', 'movies.A', 'few', 'reviewers', 'criticized', 'movie', 'thought', 'movie', 'promoted', 'terrorism', 'everyone', 'right', 'feel', 'however', 'would', 'like', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'makers', 'film', 'wanted', 'encourage', 'people', 'engage', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'fight', 'what', 'believe', 'are', 'hundreds', 'movies', 'there', 'drugs', 'rapes', 'underground', 'criminal', 'activity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actually', 'viewers', 'go', 'out', 'mimic', 'characters', 'bad', 'behaviors', 'can', 'even', 'tell', 'main', 'character', 'Said', 'was', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'going', 'bombing', 'saw', 'innocent', 'young', 'child', 'bus', 'realized', 'would', 'be', 'morally', 'wrong', 'kill', 'Furthermore', 'movie', 'was', 'pro-terrorism', 'character', 'Suha', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'urged', 'men', 'abort', 'mission', 'reasoning', 'carry', 'out', 'attack', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'Israel', 'more', 'reason', 'keep', 'Palestinians', 'thumb', 'identified', 'Suha', 'character', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'justify', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'me.What', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'was', 'make', 'think', 'critically', 'issue', 'hopefully', 'will', 'do', 'same', 'men', 'had', 'more', 'economic', 'opportunities', 'instance', 'cost-benefit', 'analysis', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'planning', 'blow', 'up', 'Palestinians', 'had', 'own', 'army', 'underground', 'operations', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'common.I', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'more', 'examples', 'injustice', 'men', 'were', 'fighting', 'otherwise', 'was', 'great', 'movie']",Paradise Now

It's a sad account of two sad young men who have been brainwashed into thinking martyrdom will aid the cause of the cowards who decide their fate. When push comes to shove, they both have second thoughts, and the outcome is left to the imagination of the viewer; regardless, it's upsetting and usettling. The preciousness of life--ALL life--is examined, and the futility of it all is quite well addressed. ""Paradise Now"" is an excellent film on many levels. Aside from its profound subject matter and the fine direction, the acting from all is excellent, especially from our two lead characters,Sad (Kais Nashif) and Khaled (Ali Suliman). Filmed on location in the West Bank, production values are above average for an Indie film; generous close-ups are frequent, adding a very personal tone to the film. Though it's a small faction of Muslim unrest, one cannot deny that the suicide idea is to be dealt with, though I'm sure it will never be understood. I, personally, choose to praise a God who holds life as precious, not to randomly destroy it; to think of this world not as it is, but as it ought to be.",5,"""The paradise in my head is better than this hell I'm living""",1300233600,"03 16, 2011",2011,1280,"['not', 'enough', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'insane', 'motivations', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'Hany', 'Abu-Assad', 'powerful', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'closest', 'have', 'seen', 'point', 'sad', 'account', 'two', 'sad', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'brainwashed', 'thinking', 'martyrdom', 'will', 'aid', 'cause', 'cowards', 'who', 'decide', 'fate', 'When', 'push', 'shove', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'outcome', 'left', 'imagination', 'viewer', 'regardless', 'upsetting', 'usettling', 'preciousness', 'life', 'life', 'examined', 'futility', 'quite', 'well', 'addressed', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'excellent', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'Aside', 'profound', 'subject', 'matter', 'fine', 'direction', 'acting', 'excellent', 'especially', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Sad', 'Kais', 'Nashif', 'Khaled', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'Filmed', 'location', 'West', 'Bank', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'Indie', 'film', 'generous', 'close-ups', 'are', 'frequent', 'adding', 'very', 'personal', 'tone', 'film', 'small', 'faction', 'Muslim', 'unrest', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'suicide', 'idea', 'be', 'dealt', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'understood', 'personally', 'choose', 'praise', 'God', 'who', 'life', 'precious', 'not', 'randomly', 'destroy', 'think', 'world', 'not', 'ought', 'be']",Paradise Now
964477,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000E0OE44,,"[3, 6]","I found this film to be excellent, well made and insightful. I found it had three strengths.First, it has the qualities of a really good thriller. Two young Palestinian men, Said and Khaled, agree to be human bombs and travel to Tel-Aviv to wreck havoc.  However, things go wrong and plot becomes complex as the two men are separated and separately decide whether or not to move forward with the mission. The men franticallylook for each other, for their Palestinian contacts, and for a way to remove the bombs tied to their waists. As the two men search for each other as well as the Palestinian underground leadership, the film becomes tense and full of plot twists.Second, the film does a very good job of character divelopment. Of course Said and Khaled move from being junk yard mechanics to terrorists, but we see their character develop quickly when when the planned terrorist attack gets aborted. We see angry and nieve Khaled mve toward maturity and reflection. We see reflective and pensive Said move toward resolution and commitment to his task as an end point in the cycle of shame he has experienced since his father was executed/killed as a consprirator with the Isralis. In the character of Said we see why a young man would sacrifice his life for such a cause.Third, the film presents a fair and balanced representation of the issues faced by the Palestinians. Suha, the grand-daughter of a Palestinian leader, provides us with the voice of peace and negotiation. We hear arguments from both sides of the Palestinian community. There are those that would seek reconciliation and peace and neotiation and then there are those who think the conditions have gone far beyond discussion and communication. The Palestinian terrorist leadership is revealed to be constantly on the run, always looking over their shoulders, and thus highly nervous when Said and Khaled fail at their mission on the first attempt. We see a decayed and poverty stricken Palestinian village compared to the brigh beaches and shopping malls of Tel-Aviv.Despite the fact that this was a well balanced, thoughtful, and fair depiction of the dynamics in Palestinian villages, I still think a non-violent approach is the only way Palestinians will eventually gain the esteem and sympathy of the world.  Terrorists and their acts continue to bring about violent reactions from Israel, thus setting up a cycle of violence and retribution.The film is thought provoking, giving much more insight into the minds of poor Palestinians. It is well made and careful in presenting its message - thus making it all the more powerful.",5,"Excellent, thoughtful, well balanced film that is great entertainment.",1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,2605,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'excellent', 'well', 'made', 'insightful', 'found', 'had', 'three', 'strengths.First', 'qualities', 'really', 'good', 'thriller', 'Two', 'young', 'Palestinian', 'men', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'agree', 'be', 'human', 'bombs', 'travel', 'Tel-Aviv', 'wreck', 'havoc', 'However', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'plot', 'becomes', 'complex', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'separated', 'separately', 'decide', 'not', 'move', 'forward', 'mission', 'men', 'franticallylook', 'other', 'Palestinian', 'contacts', 'way', 'remove', 'bombs', 'tied', 'waists', 'two', 'men', 'search', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'Palestinian', 'underground', 'leadership', 'film', 'tense', 'full', 'plot', 'twists.Second', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'character', 'divelopment', 'course', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'move', 'being', 'junk', 'yard', 'mechanics', 'terrorists', 'see', 'character', 'develop', 'quickly', 'when', 'when', 'planned', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'aborted', 'see', 'angry', 'nieve', 'Khaled', 'mve', 'maturity', 'reflection', 'see', 'reflective', 'pensive', 'Said', 'move', 'resolution', 'commitment', 'task', 'end', 'point', 'cycle', 'shame', 'experienced', 'father', 'was', 'executed/killed', 'consprirator', 'Isralis', 'character', 'Said', 'see', 'why', 'young', 'man', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'life', 'such', 'cause.Third', 'film', 'fair', 'balanced', 'representation', 'issues', 'faced', 'Palestinians', 'Suha', 'grand-daughter', 'Palestinian', 'leader', 'voice', 'peace', 'negotiation', 'hear', 'arguments', 'sides', 'Palestinian', 'community', 'are', 'would', 'seek', 'reconciliation', 'peace', 'neotiation', 'then', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'conditions', 'have', 'gone', 'far', 'discussion', 'communication', 'Palestinian', 'terrorist', 'leadership', 'revealed', 'be', 'constantly', 'run', 'always', 'looking', 'over', 'shoulders', 'thus', 'highly', 'nervous', 'when', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'fail', 'mission', 'first', 'attempt', 'see', 'decayed', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'Palestinian', 'village', 'compared', 'brigh', 'beaches', 'shopping', 'malls', 'Tel-Aviv.Despite', 'fact', 'was', 'well', 'balanced', 'thoughtful', 'fair', 'depiction', 'dynamics', 'Palestinian', 'villages', 'still', 'think', 'non-violent', 'approach', 'only', 'way', 'Palestinians', 'will', 'eventually', 'gain', 'esteem', 'sympathy', 'world', 'Terrorists', 'acts', 'continue', 'bring', 'about', 'violent', 'reactions', 'Israel', 'thus', 'setting', 'up', 'cycle', 'violence', 'retribution.The', 'film', 'thought', 'provoking', 'giving', 'much', 'more', 'insight', 'minds', 'poor', 'Palestinians', 'well', 'made', 'careful', 'presenting', 'message', 'thus', 'making', 'more', 'powerful']",Paradise Now

It is of course a powerful movie that makes one think of what it must be like for a person to be so desperate as to accept suicide operations as an only choice. There is plenty of commentary about the circumstances Palestinians find themselves in, be it the shame of having a family member cooperate with the Israelis, the shame of having had the Israelis invade one's house, the lack of fresh water, the difficulty in finding good jobs, the inability to move freely from place to place or the many other little things that affect the daily lives of people in the West Bank. American audiences might recognize two of the main actors from the Hollywood film, The Kingdom here. That's sort of typical of Palestinian-Israeli films. The pool of actors is somewhat small and the same ones show up in many movies.The plot of this movie follows approximately two days in the lives of a couple of young Palestinian men who are friends. It begins with one of them losing his job and proceeds to cover the twists and turns of planning for a suicide mission that becomes available. Some of the ups and downs have to do with circumstances beyond the characters' control and some involve emotional stress that comes up as the mission progresses. After a false start, things fall into place and we see the two characters on their way to Tel Aviv. The ending of the movie is left intentionally ambiguous and may seem to some as a cop-out, but it is really the best ending that could have been chosen. It does not detract from the meaningful emotional buildup. Many Palestinian movies have this kind of ending and in a way it's appropriate because the types of trials and tribulations that Palestinians often face do not resolve themselves in real life. Things just keep going on the same way they always have. I'm not sure how realistic the actual story is, but I think most of the elements of the movie speak to basic realities these people face.",4,Interesting look at Palestinian life.,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,2075,"['Aside', 'obvious', 'political', 'messages', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'movie', 'glimpses', 'life', 'West', 'Bank', 'course', 'powerful', 'movie', 'one', 'think', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'person', 'be', 'so', 'desperate', 'accept', 'suicide', 'operations', 'only', 'choice', 'plenty', 'commentary', 'circumstances', 'Palestinians', 'find', 'be', 'shame', 'having', 'family', 'member', 'cooperate', 'Israelis', 'shame', 'having', 'had', 'Israelis', 'invade', 'one', 'house', 'lack', 'fresh', 'water', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'good', 'jobs', 'inability', 'move', 'freely', 'place', 'place', 'many', 'other', 'little', 'things', 'affect', 'daily', 'lives', 'people', 'West', 'Bank', 'American', 'audiences', 'might', 'recognize', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'Kingdom', 'here', 'sort', 'typical', 'Palestinian-Israeli', 'films', 'pool', 'actors', 'somewhat', 'small', 'same', 'ones', 'show', 'up', 'many', 'movies.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'approximately', 'two', 'days', 'lives', 'couple', 'young', 'Palestinian', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'friends', 'one', 'losing', 'job', 'proceeds', 'cover', 'twists', 'turns', 'planning', 'suicide', 'mission', 'available', 'ups', 'downs', 'have', 'do', 'circumstances', 'characters', 'control', 'involve', 'emotional', 'stress', 'up', 'mission', 'false', 'start', 'things', 'fall', 'place', 'see', 'two', 'characters', 'way', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'ending', 'movie', 'left', 'intentionally', 'ambiguous', 'may', 'seem', 'cop-out', 'really', 'best', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'chosen', 'not', 'detract', 'meaningful', 'emotional', 'buildup', 'Many', 'Palestinian', 'movies', 'have', 'kind', 'ending', 'way', 'appropriate', 'types', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Palestinians', 'often', 'face', 'do', 'not', 'resolve', 'real', 'life', 'Things', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'same', 'way', 'always', 'have', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'realistic', 'actual', 'story', 'think', 'most', 'elements', 'movie', 'speak', 'basic', 'realities', 'people', 'face']",Paradise Now
964481,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000E0OE44,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 3]","I remember the 2005 Oscar race.  It was one of the first `awards seasons' that I actually watched closely and so when it came time for the awards to be handed out I actually had a pretty good handle on who the eventual winners were going to be (I even predicted the `Crash' upset in Best Picture, despite most prognosticators saying that the `buzz' was merely media trying to insert some tension into a sewn up race).  With foreign film, it really looked like `Paradise Now' was going to walk away with the prize.  It had good word of mouth, decent reviews and the themes were very relevant and of social discussion.  All indicators pointed North and yet, with this particular category there is really never a sure thing (if that were the case then `The White Ribbon', `Pan's Labyrinth' and `Amelie' would all have won).  Yes, if there is EVER a true surprise at the Oscars, it comes here.So, in like fashion, `Paradise Now' lost to `Tsotsi'.While I am most certainly not a great advocate for this particular film (which I'll get into in a moment), I must say that it is leaps and bounds better than `Tsotsi', which is one of the WORST film of the aughts.  Honestly, the foreign film category is often a misleading indicator of the quality of the films made overseas in that year because the rules restrict a lot of films from even being nominated.  The cream of the crop is often ineligible (in 2005 `Cache' was probably the best film of that given year, and it was ruled ineligible for a nomination) or isn't even nominated.  I mean, 2005 had greats like the aforementioned `Cache' as well as the powerful `Le'Enfant' and `2046'.None of them were even nominated.Alas, we aren't really here to discuss this; it was just a thought I had at the moment.  The film, `Paradise Now', discusses the controversial subject of suicide bombers.  This is done in a more direct and realistic tone than the recent `Four Lions', which is (for the sake of discussion) a far better film than this one.  With all its seriousness, `Paradise Now' fails to feel truly connected to its core.  I think the main issue comes from the direction, which gives the film a very `made for television' feel.  It lacks the gritty earthiness needed to convey a theme so rich with subtext.  Instead, the film feels dry and merely surface; not deep-rooted.  Even when the finale comes and the audience is supposed to drop their jaws it doesn't come as an impactful surprise.  It feels predictably clich&eacute;.  The ending is a minor saving grace, considering that the bulk of the film feels generically manipulative.  Even the circumstances surrounding the `doubts' flooding into the newly appointed martyrs feel staged and unrealistic; or, even if they are realistic they feel uninspired and predictable.The film isn't all bad though.  There is some tension clearly present, even if it is manipulated, and the performances (debut at that) by the two stars are very well done.  I wish I had more to praise though.  The film isn't `bad', it's just mediocre; and mediocre shouldn't win awards.",3,Paradise lost...,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,3058,"['remember', '2005', 'Oscar', 'race', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'awards', 'seasons', 'actually', 'watched', 'closely', 'so', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'awards', 'be', 'handed', 'out', 'actually', 'had', 'pretty', 'good', 'handle', 'who', 'eventual', 'winners', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'predicted', 'Crash', 'upset', 'Best', 'Picture', 'most', 'prognosticators', 'saying', 'buzz', 'was', 'merely', 'media', 'trying', 'insert', 'tension', 'sewn', 'up', 'race', 'foreign', 'film', 'really', 'looked', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'was', 'going', 'walk', 'away', 'prize', 'had', 'good', 'word', 'mouth', 'decent', 'reviews', 'themes', 'were', 'very', 'relevant', 'social', 'discussion', 'indicators', 'pointed', 'North', 'yet', 'particular', 'category', 'really', 'never', 'sure', 'thing', 'were', 'case', 'then', 'White', 'Ribbon', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'Amelie', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'Yes', 'EVER', 'true', 'surprise', 'Oscars', 'here.So', 'like', 'fashion', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'lost', ""Tsotsi'.While"", 'am', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'advocate', 'particular', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'moment', 'must', 'say', 'leaps', 'better', 'Tsotsi', 'one', 'WORST', 'film', 'aughts', 'Honestly', 'foreign', 'film', 'category', 'often', 'misleading', 'indicator', 'quality', 'films', 'made', 'overseas', 'year', 'rules', 'restrict', 'lot', 'films', 'even', 'being', 'nominated', 'cream', 'crop', 'often', 'ineligible', '2005', 'Cache', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'film', 'given', 'year', 'was', 'ruled', 'ineligible', 'nomination', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'mean', '2005', 'had', 'greats', 'aforementioned', 'Cache', 'as', 'well', 'powerful', ""Le'Enfant"", ""2046'.None"", 'were', 'even', 'nominated.Alas', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'here', 'discuss', 'was', 'just', 'thought', 'had', 'moment', 'film', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'controversial', 'subject', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'done', 'more', 'direct', 'realistic', 'tone', 'recent', 'Four', 'Lions', 'sake', 'discussion', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'one', 'seriousness', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'fails', 'feel', 'truly', 'connected', 'core', 'think', 'main', 'issue', 'direction', 'film', 'very', 'made', 'television', 'feel', 'gritty', 'earthiness', 'needed', 'convey', 'theme', 'so', 'rich', 'subtext', 'Instead', 'film', 'feels', 'dry', 'merely', 'surface', 'not', 'deep-rooted', 'Even', 'when', 'finale', 'audience', 'supposed', 'drop', 'jaws', ""n't"", 'come', 'impactful', 'surprise', 'predictably', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ending', 'minor', 'saving', 'grace', 'considering', 'bulk', 'film', 'feels', 'generically', 'manipulative', 'Even', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'doubts', 'flooding', 'newly', 'appointed', 'martyrs', 'feel', 'staged', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'are', 'realistic', 'feel', 'uninspired', 'predictable.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'tension', 'clearly', 'present', 'even', 'manipulated', 'performances', 'debut', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'praise', 'though', 'film', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'mediocre', 'mediocre', 'should', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards']",Paradise Now

I have friends who are on both sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict and I try equally hard to see both their views. But the things I could never get over were the constant incursions of the Israeli's into Palestine, and the Palestinian radicalists who strap bombs to themselves and detonate their deadly selves in the middle of women and children. Regardless of my political standpoint, both of these things just felt ...well ...inhuman.""Paradise Now"" is refreshing in that it doesn't ask the audience to take sides. We're just along for the ride with two good friends, Said and Khaled, Palestinians who are given the task of strapping on bombs and destroying as many Israeli's as they can (it's noteworthy to mention that this ""reaction"" is in response to the death of a Palestinian). Politics takes a backseat here as we witness these two men turn from automobile mechanics to walking time-bombs; they don't have a personal agenda, so to speak. They are out to do what is demanded ""by God"". But once armed and led into Israeli territory, things quickly go awry: an Israeli tank appears and threatens the mission. Said and Khaled get separated and the Palestinian militants who sent them on this mission begin to question their loyalties. Indeed, even Said and Khaled begin to question themselves. Why are they doing this? What will be gained? These are incredibly tough questions that the film plops into the audiences lap. And we get to see these things through the eyes of the two friends. The issue isn't forced upon us in some docu-drama fashion. This is fiction but with a splash of personal and modern morality.Hany Abu-Assad (director) deserves quite a bit of praise for his telling of this story. His gentle handling of this volatile subject matter held the perfect pitch: not forcing a message upon us yet getting a message across nonetheless. And that message? It's more about friendship, loyalty, love and loss than political extremism. Oh sure, the politics are tucked into the background but it's not (thank goodness) the focus.And it's no small wonder this movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year.",4,Step Inside The Minds Of Ticking Time-Bombs Who Question Themselves,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2274,"['bomber', 'terrorist', 'be.Getting', 'inside', 'scoop', 'tough', 'thing', 'do', 'fictional', 'tale', 'delicate', 'subject', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'sides', 'Palestinian/Israeli', 'conflict', 'try', 'equally', 'hard', 'see', 'views', 'things', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'were', 'constant', 'incursions', 'Israeli', 'Palestine', 'Palestinian', 'radicalists', 'who', 'strap', 'bombs', 'detonate', 'deadly', 'selves', 'middle', 'women', 'children', 'Regardless', 'political', 'standpoint', 'things', 'just', 'felt', 'well', 'inhuman', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'refreshing', ""n't"", 'ask', 'audience', 'take', 'sides', ""'re"", 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'two', 'good', 'friends', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'Palestinians', 'who', 'are', 'given', 'task', 'strapping', 'bombs', 'destroying', 'many', 'Israeli', 'can', 'noteworthy', 'mention', 'reaction', 'response', 'death', 'Palestinian', 'Politics', 'backseat', 'here', 'witness', 'two', 'men', 'turn', 'automobile', 'mechanics', 'walking', 'time-bombs', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'personal', 'agenda', 'so', 'speak', 'are', 'do', 'what', 'demanded', 'God', 'once', 'armed', 'led', 'Israeli', 'territory', 'things', 'quickly', 'go', 'awry', 'Israeli', 'tank', 'mission', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'get', 'separated', 'Palestinian', 'militants', 'who', 'sent', 'mission', 'begin', 'question', 'loyalties', 'Indeed', 'even', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'begin', 'question', 'Why', 'are', 'doing', 'What', 'will', 'be', 'gained', 'are', 'incredibly', 'tough', 'questions', 'film', 'audiences', 'lap', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'eyes', 'two', 'friends', 'issue', ""n't"", 'forced', 'docu-drama', 'fashion', 'fiction', 'splash', 'personal', 'modern', 'morality.Hany', 'Abu-Assad', 'director', 'quite', 'bit', 'praise', 'telling', 'story', 'gentle', 'handling', 'volatile', 'subject', 'matter', 'held', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'not', 'forcing', 'message', 'yet', 'getting', 'message', 'nonetheless', 'message', 'more', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'loss', 'political', 'extremism', 'Oh', 'sure', 'politics', 'are', 'tucked', 'background', 'not', 'thank', 'goodness', 'focus.And', 'small', 'wonder', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'Oscars', 'year']",Paradise Now

The long-suffering Palestinian people in fact had a territory, prior to the Balfour Agreement, and contrary to the terms of that agreement, which stipulated a land equally divided between Zionists and Palestinians, they were deposed of territory, property and independence.  Their homes were confiscated and they were sent into refugee camps.  After long negotiations and several wars they were granted provisional rights of habitation, but parts of their land were then given over to illegal settlements, and the rest was occupied by Israel.  Any protest was punished with torture, imprisonment or worse.  And while Israel grew and prospered, the Palestinian territories gradually fell into decay, a condition made worse by persistent bulldozing of homes, disruption of services and uprooting of entire sectors of the population.  Suicide bombings are only a pathetic, and certainly misguided, display of desperation, in response to decades of injustice.  That is what the film is really about.

Simply looking at the stark contrast between the landscape of infrastructure in Israel and the West Bank is educational as to what is really going on here.  Israel receives more foreign aid from the U.S. than all other foreign aid recipients combined!  Can these people not find a way to live together?  Is it not our responsibility to help? The burden here is not all on Israel.  However, as the film makes clear: the random bombings are felt to be justified by the continued violence which is perpetrated and perpetuated by the occupation.But the question runs deeper that the war between Israel and Palestine.  Regardless of who is found to be at fault by whom, 'haves' must find a way to accommodate their brother and sister 'have-nots' in this world, which now is delimited by a nuclear option.This challenge is raised here.  The suicide bomber is humanized. The film performs the admirable service of showing us that we are all human, Semitic, Caucasian - whoever.  And we are searching for our humanity.  If we do not find it now, in this generation, all, very likely, is lost.  The desperation of that search is mirrored in the desperation of the suicide bomber.The film puts a human face on radical Islam and gives the reasons why it does.  The human face of the perpetration of violence must be seen.  Rage emerges from the witness of injustice.

Director Hany Abu-Assad creates suspense enough to make you feel like you're watching a thriller, but at its heart this is a stirring document of the lives of two young men of occupied Palestine.Filmed on location in Nablus, the story opens with Khaled and Said being notified that their suicide mission is to take place within the next 24 hours.  As the clock winds down, we watch their handlers lead them through their last rites, first in a series of religious ceremonies meant to sooth their consciences, and later in a last filmed statement to fan their simmering hate.At first it feels like you're being set up for a James Bond type movie - all flash and sizzle with no substance. But when the mission goes awry and the bombers get split up, their fear, their doubt, their shame - the things that make them human - begin to seep out around the edges of their hate and resignation and at last you begin to see what it is that motivates Khaled and Said, young men who would otherwise be chasing girls and racing cars, to strap on a girdle of explosives.  Credit goes as much to the actors as to the director/writer for allowing these characters to shine and to step out of the shadow of stereotype.The film does not glorify or excuse the bombers.  In fact, the point of view character, the Western educated Suha, condemns them while pleading for a new course, a new way of thinking and resisting that does not require random violence.

964489,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000E0OE44,Dennis Littrell,"[9, 11]","For those viewers who are wondering whether this is a pro suicide bomber movie or not, I can say that it may depend upon who's doing the viewing.  Director Hany Abu-Assad, who is a Muslim was born in Nazareth, which is a largely Christian city in Palestine.  He moved to the Netherlands when he was a young man and currently lives in Los Angeles.  He believes the film presents ""an artistic point of view of...[a] political issue.""I tend to agree.  The proof perhaps is in the fact that some Palestinians feel the film wasn't fair to their situation while some Israelis feel that the film glorified suicide bombers.  Both sides can find evidence in the film to support their point of view, and the arguments can become heated.Personally I find suicide bombings abhorrent and counterproductive.  My belief has long been that the Palestinians would further their cause through a non-violent approach similar to methods used by Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.  Using your children to kill other people's children while committing suicide is not only morally wrong, but not likely to win the hearts and minds of people who can help you.  Furthermore the idea (expressed in the film by the suicide bombers and those who exploit them) that some people are superior because they are not afraid to die demonstrates a limited understanding of human nature and ignores history.  The Japanese used suicide bombers in World War II for example to no good effect.  And those men were not the ""humiliated"" and ""oppressed"" uneducated youths typical of suicide bombers in the Middle East.  Instead some of them were the cream of the young manhood of a growing nation.  Understand also that if the United States had the need it would have no trouble persuading countless Americans to commit suicide for God and country.  Some of the combat missions in the Pacific Theater amounted to something close to suicide.  No single people have a monopoly on tribalism.What Hany Abu-Assad shows in the film is that the justification for suicide bombing is at best suspect and at worse without any merit at all.  ""What happens afterward?"" one of the bombers asks, and is told, ""Two angels come and pick you up.""  This is not merely satire, it is a burlesque of the ""Paradise Now"" reasoning.  Indeed the title of the film is itself satirical and ironic.  Young men seeing this film will notice that it is THEY who are being used as suicide bombers, not the political leaders and the imams.  Also the scene in which the suicide bombers make the obligatory video saying goodbye to family and friends and ""I did it for God"" with automatic rifle held on high, was played as farce, revealing the empty promise behind being used.The fact that most of the anti-suicide rhetoric in the film comes from Suha (Lubna Azabal) who is the daughter of a privileged Arab and onetime opposition hero is seen as significant by some because in Arab/Muslim countries the political opinion of women is of scant value, and therefore Suha is seen as expressing a minority or discredited opinion.  However, since her expression is so very well articulated and persuasive, it can be seen from the opposite point of view, as expressing reason and moral truth.Hany Abu-Assad of course had more than an artistic intent in making this film.  Clearly he wanted to put the tragedy of the Palestinians upon the silver screen (and DVD) for all the world to see.  To be effective he realized that he could not poison the waters of his expression with subjectivity and one-sidedness.  He had to work hard to be as objective as possible and to present both sides of the argument.  That way his film would be viewed and discussed, and some sympathy and understanding might develop.  He had to show suicide bombers as living, breathing human beings.  Notice that the two depicted are relatively intelligent young men, not mindless robots.I share with Abu-Assad the belief that if all the facts about what is happening in the Middle East become widely known and understood (in so far as it is possible to understand the lives of people living in different cultures thousands of miles away) this knowledge and understanding would help to bring about positive change.  Ignorance is our only real enemy.In short, Paradise Now is a work of art and an excellent film that clearly deserved its Golden Globe Award as the Best Foreign Film and its nomination for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film.  Kais Nashif who plays Said, one of the bombers, and Ali Suliman, who plays the other, both do an outstanding job, particularly Nashif who manages to combine the look and feel of a disadvantaged youth with the strength of character of a young man who is determined to follow what he ultimately determines is his fate.  His motivation goes beyond the ignorant and indoctrinated suicide bomber who is hoping to be rewarded with virgins in heaven.  He has personal reasons for becoming a suicide bomber.  He is the son of a man who collaborated with the Israelis, and consequently he feels that his fate is to compensate for what his father did.The film was shot in Nablus and Nazareth and captures some of the atmosphere.  The editing is crisp and the story unfolds clearly with a nice tension.  The sense that the bomb around the bomber's waist could go off at any moment is one of the devices in the film that maintains that tension in a unique way.All in all this a film very much worth seeing regardless of how you feel about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.",5,Very much worth seeing regardless of your POV,1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,5480,"['viewers', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'pro',

He is even audacious enough to include some unexpected comedy elements to emphasize the mood of desperation in the country. Written by Abu-Assad with Bero Beyer and Pierre Hodgson, the tightly wound plot focuses on two young Palestinian men, who as low-end auto mechanics about to be fired, don't think twice about being martyrs for the cause.Naturally they are a study in opposites - Said is grimly serious to the point of obsession because he is the son of an executed Israeli collaborator, while Khaled is swept up in the spirit of the cause and likely nave about his impending death and subsequent entry into heaven. Most of the movie is about their preparation for a meticulously planned strike in Tel Aviv, and their outward appearances change dramatically so they can fit in among the Israelis (referred to as ""settlers"" by the Palestinians). Training them is Jamal, as he emptily spouts extremist rhetoric under the leadership of Abu-Karem, who runs the underground political organization responsible for the bombing. Complicating matters further is the romantic relationship developing between Said and Suha, the daughter of a revered Palestinian leader and whose pacifist views provide a direct counterpoint to the two men's actions.Running only ninety minutes, the film is quickly paced, and the last twenty minutes are pulse-racing in the way that effective American crime thrillers are. The acting is strong, especially among the three principals - Kais Nashef as embattled Said, Lubna Azabal as conscientious Suha, and in particular, Ali Suliman as increasingly manic Khaled. In a surprise about-face from his comic turn in 2004's ""The Syrian Bride"", Ashraf Barhom gets quite serious as Abu-Karem. Particularly impressive is the crisp, sun-drenched cinematography by Antoine H&eacute;berl&eacute;. Abu-Assad has taken great pains to present a dispassionate political perspective while heightening the personal drama. For the most part, he succeeds even if the script turns to polemics toward the climax. Regardless, this is a provocative, deeply cinematic work.

Are there ever to be answers or solutions to the crises? For this viewer watching and absorbing PARADISE NOW is illuminating in that it removes the expected political preaching to focus on the minds of the people living under the daily stress of life at its most difficult. Taking us there, making ideas into people with all the convictions and rebelliousness and fragility, writer/director Hany Abu-Assad (with Bero Beyer) offers invaluable insights and in the end we are left with a story about humanity and the consequences of decisions, and the desperate need for peace.Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are childhood friends in Palestine who have been elected to be suicide bombers in an attack on Tel Aviv. Their election to be martyrs for the destruction of the 'invaders' is considered an honor: their deaths will bring glory to their country, their families, and guarantee them instant entry into heaven. We see the two men as citizens living in the dusty hovels, facing barricades and checkpoints that make their lives ones of constant stress. Martyrdom will bring them peace and eternal rest. The entire process of preparing the elected martyrs, from making farewell videotapes for their parents, to having their hair cut short, to having the bombs strapped to their bodies, to dressing them in black suits for the 'wedding' they are instructed to claim to attend in Tel Aviv, to sending them off at the designated spot is relentlessly filmed. Said and Khaled accept their roles although with varying degrees of emotional commitment. At the point where the lads are to begin their martyrdom venture they are separated and the story is how each continues living, each now alone.The families and the perpetrators of the scheme are well drawn by a strong cast, with one female role Suha (Lubna Azabal) as a voice of reason and peace standing out particularly strongly. The sensitivity of the actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman keeps this drama from sinking into politicism and instead allows us to understand the inner turmoil of the two men they portray as they cope with their duties and their lives.This is a powerful document that serves as a plea for peace wherever terrorism is a factor - and now that is global. If more of us could watch and absorb films such as PARADISE NOW perhaps the itinerant boundaries separating mankind by misunderstanding could be reduced without the need for war. Highly Recommended.

Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are a pair of Palestinians living in the West Bank.  They work together at a garage and are best friends.  In response to an Israeli attack, the Palestinian organization to which they belong has decided to retaliate and set up their first mission in two years.  Said and Khaled will be sent to Tel Aviv as suicide bombers, using the technique that we have become familiar with from the news: the first bomb will go off and when the rescuers arrive to deal with the dead and dying the second bomb will detonate.Said and Khaled spend a last night with their families, who do not have any idea what will be happening the next day.  The two men are shaved, given haircuts and new suits, so that they can blend in with their intended victims.  But when they film their final statements of martyrdom there are problems with the video camera.  What follows is not really a comedy of errors, because there is nothing funny about suicide bombers, but director Hany Abu-Assad (""Al Qods Fee Yom Akhar"") has a definite sense of irony.  The last statements of martyrs are not expected to include shopping tips (to be clear, this is not a funny moment, but rather one that recognizes what strange thoughts go through the mind of someone who is about to go out into the world and blow himself up).The problems with the videotape are a harbinger of what is to come, as the detailed plan gets off track.  Said and Khaled become separated, and the plan that has been put into place is not exactly full of contingencies.  However, the extra time gives both men a chance to have second thoughts, each going in a decidedly different direction.  This gives the film, co-written by Abu-Assad and his partner Bero Beyer, and opportunity to present different points of views on why a group engages in suicide bombings and why the practice will not result in the desired changes.  Jamal (Amer Hiehel) is the brains behind the operation, while Suha (Lubna Azabal) represents what we would think of as being the voice of reason in the film.  But there are reasons on both sides and a reasonable assumption is that viewers have already made their minds up on this issue before they even sit down and watch ""Paradise Now.""When things go wrong with the plan there is a sense in which this 2005 film starts to become a thriller.  Granted, one of the questions is clearly whether or not these human bombs are going to go off.  But ""Paradise Now"" is not trying to be a thriller.  Instead it is finding space between the decision and the act to reconsider both.  I have been thinking over whether the fade from the final shot of the film is a poetic touch by Abu-Assad or an effort at ambiguity.  At this point I am inclined to go with the former, especially since I have little doubt that viewers will impose their own ideology when deciding to solve the apparent ambiguity.  This is not a movie that is trying to change the minds of its viewers, just one that is trying to get them to see things from a different perspective.  Ultimately, that is what may well prove more disquieting than the thought of seeing bombs going off.",5,A pair of Palestenians are sent as suicide bombers into Tel Aviv,1143676800,"03 30, 2006",2006,3411,"['mother', 'would', 'certainly', 'debate', 'point', 'acknowledging', 'political', 'view', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'endorsing', 'So', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'finding', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'be', 'provocative', 'compelling', 'constitutes', 'political', 'position', 'be', 'articulated', 'defended', 'Said', 'Kais', 'Nashef', 'Khaled', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'are', 'pair', 'Palestinians', 'living', 'West', 'Bank', 'work', 'together', 'garage', 'are', 'best', 'friends', 'response', 'Israeli', 'attack', 'Palestinian', 'organization', 'belong', 'decided', 'retaliate', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'mission', 'two', 'years', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'using', 'technique', 'have', 'become', 'familiar', 'news', 'first', 'bomb', 'will', 'go', 'off', 'when', 'rescuers', 'arrive', 'deal', 'dead', 'dying', 'second', 'bomb', 'will', 'detonate.Said', 'Khaled', 'spend', 'last', 'night', 'families', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'happening', 'next', 'day', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'shaved', 'given', 'haircuts', 'new', 'suits', 'can', 'blend', 'intended', 'victims', 'when', 'film', 'final', 'statements', 'martyrdom', 'are', 'problems', 'video', 'camera', 'What', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'errors', 'nothing', 'funny', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'director', 'Hany', 'Abu-Assad', 'Al', 'Qods', 'Fee', 'Yom', 'Akhar', 'definite', 'sense', 'irony', 'last', 'statements', 'martyrs', 'are', 'not', 'expected', 'include', 'shopping', 'tips', 'be', 'clear', 'not', 'funny', 'moment', 'rather', 'one', 'what', 'strange', 'thoughts', 'go', 'mind', 'someone', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'world', 'blow', 'up', '.The', 'problems', 'videotape', 'are', 'harbinger', 'what', 'come', 'detailed', 'plan', 'off', 'track', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'become', 'separated', 'plan', 'been', 'put', 'place', 'not', 'exactly', 'full', 'contingencies', 'However', 'extra', 'time', 'men', 'chance', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'going', 'decidedly', 'different', 'direction', 'film', 'co-written', 'Abu-Assad', 'partner', 'Bero', 'Beyer', 'opportunity', 'present', 'different', 'points', 'views', 'why', 'group', 'suicide', 'bombings', 'why', 'practice', 'will', 'not', 'result', 'desired', 'changes', 'Jamal', 'Amer', 'Hiehel', 'brains', 'operation', 'Suha', 'Lubna', 'Azabal', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'being', 'voice', 'reason', 'film', 'are', 'reasons', 'sides', 'reasonable', 'assumption', 'viewers', 'have', 'already', 'made', 'minds', 'up', 'issue', 'even', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'plan', 'sense', '2005', 'film', 'become', 'thriller', 'Granted', 'one', 'questions', 'clearly', 'not', 'human', 'bombs', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'off', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'thriller', 'Instead', 'finding', 'space', 'decision', 'act', 'reconsider', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'fade', 'final', 'shot', 'film', 'poetic', 'touch', 'Abu-Assad', 'effort', 'ambiguity', 'point', 'am', 'inclined', 'go', 'former', 'especially', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'viewers', 'will', 'impose', 'own', 'ideology', 'when', 'deciding', 'solve', 'apparent', 'ambiguity', 'not', 'movie', 'trying', 'change', 'minds', 'viewers', 'just', 'one', 'trying', 'get', 'see', 'things', 'different', 'perspective', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'may', 'well', 'prove', 'more', 'disquieting', 'thought', 'seeing', 'bombs', 'going', 'off']",Paradise Now

From the bombers' perspective, the main themes are Israel as ""occupier"", Palestinians as humiliated, ""occupation"" as perpetuating ""resistance"", and the human body as the only weapon left to Palestinians.  These are bleak themes, wrapped in the poverty and squalor of decimated Palestinian urban landscapes.Each of the two would-be bombers expresses doubts about their mission, showing they're reflective, thinking beings, not one-dimensional automatons.  Frighteningly though, neither is distinct in any meaningful way, suggesting any of a thousand men (or women) could replace them.There are many poignant moments in this film, but the most striking for me is when Suha, a well-educated intellectual woman, asks one of the bombers ""what will happen to the rest of us left behind?""

Even there are other features, drama or documentary, they are less well known if not unheard of. The film is written in a controversial manner from beginning to the end. If you think or expect it to be simply pro or anti terrorism, you should watch it again.The film starts with two good friends being invited to do a suicide bombing and things went wrong during the first attempt and the occurring in between force them to think about nature of the matter before they decide to commit themselves to the second one.Terrorists are portrayed in a satirical way and pacifists are portrayed as idealists if not nave. If you cut out the bombing part, it is about the daily life of people living there in ""National Geographic"" style.

During their scary journey of decision they express their emotional struggle when contemplating the possibility of killing innocent whilst remembering their oppressed past and hopeless future.The brain washing used to recruit young men that plays on their pain and beliefs, like bacteria on an open wound, are shown through many discussions like what the recruiter said:"" What can you do when there is no justice or freedom? Then there's the individual that is forced to fight for it. If we give in to the law that says, the strong devour the weak, then we become the animals. That's intolerable. Death is better than inferiority. That means whoever fights for freedom, can also die for it.""The two friends strike a friendship with one of the guys love interest who is an open minded and educated woman. Dialog is the main tool in the movie to describe how difficult it is to get humans to let go of their hatred. The erudite young lady argues with them: ""That's no sacrifice. That's revenge. If you kill, there's no difference between victim and occupier.""The dialog again shows how young men face the decision of killing themselves and others as Said puts it: ""Even worse, they've convinced the world and themselves that they are the victims. How can that be? How can the occupier be the victim? If they take on the role of oppressor and victim then I have no other choice but to also be a victim and a murderer as well. I don't know how you'll decide, but I will not return to the refugee camp.""Eventually, the conversations become simply cold lectures, but some credit should be given to the honesty and truthfulness while exploring the problem of suicide attacks.

We are accustomed to read about the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the news but seldom do we see it from Palestinian's perspective.  The story premise is simple enough about two childhood friends who decide to become martyrs.  They make it clear that since they cannot be regarded as equals with Israel in life, they may just as well regard themselves as equals with Israel in death by killing as many Israeli soldiers as possible through suicide bombing.  Here, there's this lady by the name of Suha whose father is hailed as a hero (suicide bomber) and yet, she belongs to a human rights group.  She believes that violence doesn't resolve the conflict and the best way to win is by reasoning through morality.  Said, one of the suicide bomber partakes in the scheme because he yearns to be ridden of his father's label as a collaborator.  His best friend eventually comes to realisation that their action would achieve nothing.  I guess that it's hard to reason sensibly when your living environment is oppressed and that Palestinians are humiliated and treated as occupied prisoners when not too far away, Tel Aviv leads a rather comfortable lifestyle.  Many of suicide bombers opt for the Paradise after life but should they not create their Paradise now on earth?  I think what Mahatma Ghandi says is true: be the change that you wish for in this world.  If you choose to do nice things, we would create a nice cycle and if we opt otherwise, we would create vicious cycle.  So, where do we stand?

I thought this film would be a piece of obvious propaganda but it definitely wasn't.  It was evident that this film tried to be truthful and also recognized the madness inherent in suicide-bombing.  Contrary to PARADISE NOW, I found Spielberg's film to be a piece of pro-Palestinian terrorist propaganda.  Go figure; I didn't see that one coming.  I found this film riveting.  The characters were fascinating and got more so as the story progressed.  The script was excellent and the acting exceptional.  It showed slices of Palestinian life and thinking.  It was sympathetic to the Palestinian ""cause"" but that was seemingly incidental.  I felt this film was about people trapped in a bad situation economically, spiritually, and morally.  About people usually denied the opportunity to make choices but when they had to make them, the options were few and often very extreme with extreme consequences.  And those consequences were not just to themselves.  I learned a lot through this film.  Those little background facts that help you better understand why a people politically act the way they do.  How do some people become suicide bombers, why and what are the rules.  It was fascinating.

964513,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000E0OE44,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","The thing that's most striking about ""Paradise Now"" - an Award-winning Palestinian film about two young men recruited to be suicide bombers - is the remarkably matter-of-fact way in which it approaches its subject.  Without a trace of jingoism or a hint of sensationalism, the film tells the story of Said and Khaled, two long time friends who are called upon to sacrifice their lives for what they believe to be the good of the Palestinian people.  As the film starts, Said and Khaled receive word that they are to travel to Tel Aviv, where they are to blow themselves up, taking as many Israeli soldiers with them as they can.  However, the plan hits some unforeseen snags, causing the men to become separated and giving each the chance to rethink his commitment to the act.Directed by Hany Abu-Assad, ""Paradise Now"" was a highly controversial film from the moment it was released in 2005.  (It was also a production fraught with a great deal of danger and peril for the individuals making it, as the crew fell victim to exploding land mines, helicopter gunfire and even the kidnapping of the location manager during the filming).  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is so messy, complex and entangled an affair that it is virtually impossible for any film to please all the various individuals with a stake in the issue.  There is always bound to be someone who thinks any movie on this subject will go too far or not far enough in siding with one or the other of the parties involved (just look at the brouhaha aroused by Spielberg's ""Munich"" last year).  And, certainly, ""Paradise Now,"" remaining true to its characters, provides perhaps a slightly more sympathetic view of the Palestinian cause.  However, the filmmakers make it abundantly clear that terrorism and violence are not the answer to the problems facing the region and that such acts are tragic and ultimately counterproductive for both the individuals and the nations involved.What's most remarkable about ""Paradise Now"" is that, given the extreme volatility of its subject matter, it still manages to remain so cool-headed and even-handed in its tone.  Through the compelling performances of newcomers Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman, the film becomes, first and foremost, a human drama about two young men caught in a mindset that seems positively inscrutable to those of us living in the more peaceful, secular West.  We come to know them as individuals, but we are never asked to approve of their actions.  If anything, we are made acutely aware of the waste of life and potential that would result from such an action.  For the movie makes it quite clear that men like Said and Khaled can accomplish much more in the way of peace and equality if they are alive and actively engaged in the cause than if they are dead.  That is a message we cannot hear too often in these perilous times in which we live.  And that we can hear it coming from individuals so close to the actual heart of things is what makes ""Paradise Now"" such an indispensable addition to the cause of world peace.",4,"subtle, thoughtful study of terrorism",1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,3048,"['thing', 'most', 'striking', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'Award-winning', 'Palestinian', 'film', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'recruited', 'be', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'remarkably', 'matter-of-fact', 'way', 'subject', 'trace', 'jingoism', 'hint', 'sensationalism', 'film', 'story', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'two', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'called', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'good', 'Palestinian', 'people', 'film', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'receive', 'word', 'are', 'travel', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'where', 'are', 'blow', 'up', 'taking', 'many', 'Israeli', 'soldiers', 'can', 'However', 'plan', 'unforeseen', 'snags', 'causing', 'men', 'become', 'separated', 'giving', 'chance', 'rethink', 'commitment', 'act.Directed', 'Hany', 'Abu-Assad', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'was', 'highly', 'controversial', 'film', 'moment', 'was', 'released', '2005', 'was', 'also', 'production', 'fraught', 'great', 'deal', 'danger', 'peril', 'individuals', 'making', 'crew', 'fell', 'victim', 'exploding', 'land', 'mines', 'helicopter', 'gunfire', 'even', 'kidnapping', 'location', 'manager', 'filming', 'Israeli-Palestinian', 'conflict', 'so', 'messy', 'complex', 'entangled', 'affair', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'film', 'please', 'various', 'individuals', 'stake', 'issue', 'always', 'bound', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'movie', 'subject', 'will', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'not', 'far', 'enough', 'siding', 'one', 'other', 'parties', 'involved', 'just', 'look', 'brouhaha', 'aroused', 'Spielberg', 'Munich', 'last', 'year', 'certainly', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'remaining', 'true', 'characters', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'Palestinian', 'cause', 'However', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'terrorism', 'violence', 'are', 'not', 'answer', 'problems', 'facing', 'region', 'such', 'acts', 'are', 'tragic', 'ultimately', 'counterproductive', 'individuals', 'nations', 'involved.What', 'most', 'remarkable', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'given', 'extreme', 'volatility', 'subject', 'matter', 'still', 'remain', 'so', 'cool-headed', 'even-handed', 'tone', 'compelling', 'performances', 'newcomers', 'Kais', 'Nashef', 'Ali', 'Suliman', 'film', 'becomes', 'first', 'foremost', 'human', 'drama', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'caught', 'mindset', 'positively', 'inscrutable', 'living', 'more', 'peaceful', 'secular', 'West', 'come', 'know', 'individuals', 'are', 'never', 'asked', 'approve', 'actions', 'anything', 'are', 'made', 'acutely', 'aware', 'waste', 'life', 'potential', 'would', 'result', 'such', 'action', 'movie', 'quite', 'clear', 'men', 'Said', 'Khaled', 'can', 'accomplish', 'much', 'more', 'way', 'peace', 'equality', 'are', 'alive', 'actively', 'engaged', 'cause', 'are', 'dead', 'message', 'can', 'not', 'hear', 'too', 'often', 'perilous', 'times', 'live', 'can', 'hear', 'coming', 'individuals', 'so', 'close', 'actual', 'heart', 'things', 'what', 'Paradise', 'Now', 'such', 'indispensable', 'addition', 'cause', 'world', 'peace']",Paradise Now
964514,A387BD735MI50R,B000E0OE44,R. Schultz,"[8, 9]","This is the story of two young Palestinian men recruited to bomb West Bank Israeli targets. The movie isn't a documentary, but it has the ride-along, realistic feel of one.In a way, it sticks almost too much to unfolding in real time. It doesn't give us quite enough back-story to make us feel we know these men. But we do come to see them, not as bizarre fanatics, but as anyone's sons, as the boys next door. Although one of them is fired from his job at an auto repair shop/junkyard - for the most part these men are relatively well off and come from loving, close-knit families. One is even in a position to enjoy a budding romance with the lovely, free-thinking daughter of a revered Palestinian martyr.However, the film is amazingly accurate and prescient in what insights it does provide about the bombers' motives. Just recently, studies have come out that reveal most suicide bombers are NOT motivated by a desire to enforce their religious views on the world. Rather they are chafing at the humiliations they feel they and their people have been made to suffer at the hands of various occupying forces. This is true for militant groups everywhere around the world, whether it be in Africa, Indonesia, or in the Middle East. And that's exactly what this film gets across about its two young men.In spite of actually having a lot to live for, the young men feel honored to be selected to strap bombs to their waists and to walk across the checkpoint to ""take out as many Israelis as possible."" Religion is not their reason per se. They see themselves as freedom fighters, as liberators. Their faith in Allah's absolute Truth is only their means - the foundation of the strength they feel they have to muster to accomplish their goals.One of the most riveting scenes in the movie shows these men videotaping their farewell speeches. They stand aggressively in front of the camera, machine guns akimbo, and deliver their mission statements. These are combinations of grandiosity and of the touchingly mundane. One bomber trails off with advice to his mother on where she can get the best buy on milk, information she'll need when he's no longer physically present to help her with the shopping.Then these two men, with their bombs locked onto them, are driven close to the West Bank boundary they will have to negotiate. However their plans go immediately awry. One of the men returns to home base. The other becomes literally a loose cannon. He's the one who perhaps doesn't quite have the simplistic trust that his companion has always had in everyone's reassurances about the two angels who will carry them to Heaven after they have detonated themselves. He is also the one who just may not be absolutely sure about the justice of his cause. He pauses - as he looks into the eyes of the Israeli children who would be included as his targets.This is an engrossing film. It's one that government officials should view before making policy decisions. But it can provide some better understanding to all of us. It is a rare opportunity to see the living conditions of average Palestinian Muslims on the West Bank. Its female lead is not veiled. She speaks her mind freely, intelligently to men - and is more comfortable with herself than most American women are. She's the kind of woman one barely guessed existed in these parts of the Muslim world.But the really gripping aspect of this movie is the way it will put you in the shoes of a young Muslim with a mission - as he faces an almost unimaginable decision.

The acting and direction are expert. The film is an interesting presentation of Palestinian culture for those curious. The film is not at all successful in explaining and indeed does not even address the Moslem obsession with death.It is generally anti-Jewish though since it IS from the Palestinian viewpoint that is not necessarily bad form. The film comes dangerously close to being pro-terrorist but pulls back at the last moment. The only fumbles are 1) All the Palestinian whining about being oppressed and living in hell is defeated by the simple fact that the West Bank does not look all that different from parts of Queens or Brooklyn and the residents are shown being able to rent or purchase snuff videos for their home entertainment so what is the big problem?? B) The film keeps insisting that the Homicide bombers are only targeting Israeli soldiers when obviously the reality--aka civilians, women and children--puts the lie to that. And one was amused to see one of the terrorists(who is portrayed as being a nice terrorist who would never blow up children) somehow managing to get on a public bus occupied mostly by soldiers. Uh.Uh. And finally C) the film cheats by ending at the point of detonation and not showing the results of this barbaric war crime.An Israeli film dramatizing the other side needs to be made. One wonders if it HAS been and simply has been prevented from being shown in this country by those great defenders of free speech who tried to censor PATH TO 9/11.

964518,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000E0OE44,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[12, 14]","""Paradise Now"", the new Palestinian film recently released on DVD, is an engrossing look at what life is like in a part of the world many of us will never get to see. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2005.Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are two young men who have lived in the West Bank for their entire lives. They, like most of their friends and family, have long since learned to live with the constant presence of Israel in their lives. They don't give checkpoints a second glance, they barely duck when a bombing happens nearby, they have learned to live without many of the things we take for granted; variety of food, movies, freedom of movement. One day, Jamal (Amer Hlehel) tells them their time has come; they have been chosen to perform a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, in retaliation for the murder of Suha's (Lubna Azabal) father. When Suha, a friend of the two young men, finds out about their plan, she tries to stop them, believing that the violence will only lead to more violence.""Paradise Now"", written and directed by Hany Abu-Assad, is a surprisingly moving film. Shot in the West Bank, the film thrusts us into daily life in this very remote part of the world. I say remote because I think I can safely say many of us will never see this very different part of the world. It depicts the lives of the two young men, showing us their difficult struggles, in an effort to convince us why they would be so eager to participate in such a heinous act, why such a thing would make them `heroes'. And ""Paradise"" does a remarkably good job of convincing us. Their life is very difficult, but it isn't difficult because of the Palestinians or the Israelis. It is difficult because of a long standing history between the two groups. They have spent so many years hating each other, trying to eradicate each other; it is difficult to wonder if they will ever reach peace.After the two men are chosen, we watch their indoctrination and training.The process of any change they experience is a gradual one. They each share a last evening with their families, never revealing the journey they will take on the next day. These scenes are very emotional, yet low key. They can't reveal what will happen, to keep their parents safe from the news and the effects. Yet, they also have to maintain a sense of normalcy. They can't cry or get emotional or bid a long farewell. Perhaps it is this lack of a proper good-bye which helps to begin the journey of change. They are groomed, heads shaven, clothes changed, to make them appear more Israeli, so they can blend in. They receive detailed instructions. One of them should set off their bomb first, allowing the police and authorities to come to the scene and then the second should set off their bomb, to inflict more casualties. Then they receive the instructions about how to get into Tel Aviv and where to go.But Said and Khaled go through with it, leaving for Tel Aviv. Complications arise.Abu-Assad does a very good job of showing the conflicting emotions in his main characters. They have been trained, programmed, all of their lives to believe Israel is the enemy, and now they have the chance to become martyrs for the cause, to become heroes. Yet, they begin to question if this is the way to obtain their goals. After they arrive in Israel, they blend in, receiving only cursory glances. What really makes this film powerful is that it pretty evenly presents both sides of the story. It clearly wants to show peace is the way, but it has to give us an idea of what they have lived with all of their lives. To present only one point of view would not do the film justice. We need to see both, to make the right way seem all the more correct and powerful.Kais Nashef is very good as Said, the more unemotional of the two, steely, reserved and determined to carry out his mission. Ali Suliman's Khaled is the more emotional one. He is more excited about his calling and also more scared when the effects of the mission become clear.Suha proves to be the level headed member of the group. She is quite smitten with Said, but he doesn't seem able to reciprocate. When he learns of his fate, he becomes even more withdrawn, afraid to get her hopes up. As soon as she learns of their plans, she raises many good points, debating with them the need for their journey. She believes that the only way to end this current problem is through peaceful negotiations. Violence will only lead to more violence, as it has in their culture for years, for decades.Shot in Nablas, the film depicts the town and life in it with an unflinching eye. Covered in dirt, debris and decades of war, Nablas is not an attractive place. To us, it looks uninhabitable. To these people, this is all they know, so they live with it. They have to, they have no choice. It is difficult for them to leave and obtain anything else, to improve their lives, because of the history of this place.""Paradise Now"" is all the more powerful because of it's ending. The ending is a little ambiguous, leaving it open to interpretation. The filmmaker's leave this to our imagination and it is all the more powerful for that reason. Our mind can make up a much more horrifying ending than they could ever film.",4,Powerful Look At Two Men In the West Bank,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,5268,"['Paradise', 'Now', 'new', 'Palestinian',

Williams ""world traveller""","[5, 9]","Although I can't embrace some of the conclusions to which this film hopes to lead its audience, ""Paradise Now"" succeeds as a film because it is a well-crafted story.While Spielberg's ""Munich"" deals with similar territory - the futility of violence to quell the tide of violence - this film does not stumble on its way to resolution. Where Spielberg tried to foist the idea of moral equivalncy on both sides of the conflict, ""Paradise Now"" is content to tell a story -and tell ti well - with its own unique voice.Granted, it offers a variation of ideas - and once or twice slips into political rhetoric - but it does not patronize the viewers by pretending to present the Israeli viewpoint. Nor does it coddle the viewer with a false ""all-things-being-equal"" morality. It is exactly what it presents itself as being: the story of two men tapped to be suicide bombers. It is content in that. An opposing viewpoint need not be self-censored. If you want ""balance,"" go look elsewhere.The triumph of the film is measured in the way it involves its audience in the drama. Even though I abhored some of their beliefs, I still cared about these characters.

964520,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B000E0OE44,Utah Blaine,"[5, 8]","This is an outstanding movie that explores the motivations of Palestinian suicide bombers.  The conventional wisdom in the US is that they are either religious fanatics, rabid anti-Semites, and/or political extremists who want simply to murder Israelis and push their country into the sea.  This film tries to examine some of the moral complexities of the occupation and the suicide bombers, and to explain (and in part justify) their motives.  If the director wanted to create a more sympathetic, nuanced image of the Palestinian resistance, I think he has succeeded.  In this story, two young Palestinians who are close friends are called upon to carry out an operation against Israel.  We follow the characters as they examine the reasons for volunteering for this mission, their uncertainties, and their motivations as they question whether or not they can really go through with the operation. Through them, we learn about the diversity of viewpoints among the Palestinians regarding the occupation and suicide bombing.  We also see the suffering of the Palestinian people, and view up close what the Israeli occupation means to the daily life of the Palestinians.  After watching this film, it is pretty easy to understand why the Palestinians are pissed.  The only thing that I disliked about this movie was that the director completely avoided the difficult moral dilemma of the Palestinian suicide bombers attacking civilians by making the bomber's target a bus (mostly) full of Israeli soldiers.  I suspect that the audience's reaction would be somewhat different if the bus were filled with women and children. This is really a minor complaint though, why should Palestinian films address all the moral complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when there are literally hundreds of pro-Israel propaganda films that completely ignore the effects of the creation of the Israeli state and the occupation on the indigenous Palestinians?  This is a timely film that I think most viewers will find extremely compelling.

But it also does not come down on the side of the suicide bombers portrayed.  They come to be convinced that they are martyrs, but at the same time, they also realize that they are murderers.  If I could have spoken to them, I would have told them just two things:1.  You can't bring on peace by committing violent acts; and2.  If you truly want to help your family, stick around and stay alive for them.The actors are excellent here, the photography is nicely done, and the director wisely chooses not to be too graphic in the depictions of what these men set out to do.  It's better to imply than to be explicit in this case.There is also an interesting twist regarding one man who decides to back out of the plan.",4,"One-sided, yes, but doesn't take a side",1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,798,"['film', 'not', 'documentary', 'not', 'cover', 'sides', 'conflict', 'also', 'not', 'come', 'down', 'side', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'portrayed', 'come', 'be', 'convinced', 'are', 'martyrs', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'realize', 'are', 'murderers', 'could', 'have', 'spoken', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'just', 'two', 'things:1', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'peace', 'committing', 'violent', 'acts', 'and2', 'truly', 'want', 'help', 'family', 'stick', 'around', 'stay', 'alive', 'them.The', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'here', 'photography', 'nicely', 'done', 'director', 'wisely', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'graphic', 'depictions', 'what', 'men', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'better', 'imply', 'be', 'explicit', 'case.There', 'also', 'interesting', 'twist', 'regarding', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'back', 'plan']",Paradise Now

Arabs and Muslims seem to profess brotherly love and cohesion among themselves, and then totally dismiss each other in reality.  The Iraqis are suspicious of Turkey and Iran (not Arabs but still Muslim), the Turks distrust the Kurds, the Kurds seem to trust no one but themselves, the Saudis live in their own insular world supported by oil money and imported labor, and I firmly believe if it weren't for their conflict with Israel, the Palestinians would be mostly marginalized and/or ignored by their Arab/Muslim cousins.  I also don't believe in ""historical rights"" to land.  Given any spot of land on this planet, all you have to do is choose a certain century, and a different people occupied that chunk of land.  So, based on that, I have little sympathy for Israeli or Palestinian  ""historical"" claims to middle eastern land.  Heck, the ""holy land"" was occupied by Rome at some time, so Italy should even be able to claim something based on that faulty logic.  Alexander conquered it as well...maybe Greece should lay dibs on the middle east too.BUT, back to the movie.  Very well done! Palestinians are people.  Regardless of what some of them are capable of doing, it's ignorant and stupid not to try to understand what's motivating their actions.  Though there may not be good reasons for blowing yourself up (very few good reason for that in my book), there are obviously reasons why it happens (flimsy reasons or not).  This movie doesn't offer any concrete answers, but takes a very human look at the possible motivations and environments that shape and influence people into even considering such actions.  The main characters are loosely defined, given a bit of history, and then we simply see who they are at this moment in time in their lives.The cinematography is great, the acting solid, and the topic quite timely.  Unfortunately too many people out there won't think enough about this.  They'll just ""react"".  They bomb, shoot, blow-up, rant, rave, dis the Amazon reviews in favor of this movie, and discount anything that doesn't agree with their view.  Way to ignore the one tool that would best help the world solve problems like this...your intellect.My biggest complaint is it would have been good to see the Israeli side of this story a bit.  I have one American Jewish friend who said once, ""Were they nuts?  Why the hell did they build a Jewish nation in the middle of the middle east surrounded by millions of Arabs who HATE them?  Didn't we have some extra land in Montana to offer up or something?""And the real reason for these reviews...will you like the movie?  Hmmm...depends.  Bottom line is if you're open minded about race and religious relations in the world, then ""yes"", you'll definitely get something out of this.

964523,A6060VY7A6CF4,B000E0OE44,Zev Toledano,"[22, 32]","Being from Israel, this movie is bound to affect me in different ways. Hearing that this was about the Palestinian point of view, I mostly expected bias, but I simply had to watch this out of an intense curiosity to understand. I very much needed to get some insight regarding the people that are trying to kill me every day.The movie's prime objective is to put a human face on the suicide bombers and to explain why they feel this is necessary. This is a good thing. I WANT to see these people as human beings and I want to understand them.Two aspiring martyrs and one more peaceful-minded Arab girl influenced by Westerners are the protagonists. Their daily lives are explored, the constant tension and presence of the barriers and Israeli soldiers is shown, they play, work, discuss their existence and humiliations, and disagree on how to achieve freedom. Palestinian society is shown to glorify the bombers and decry collaborators as the ultimate humiliation, with home-made movies containing their last words being sold as populist entertainment (both martyrs and collaborators).When it's time for our protagonist to make his own impassioned video, the camera breaks down, then he inserts a reminder for his mother about water filters. The procedure to convert this human who is just like us into a killer is shown to be a well-oiled machine run by professionals who are seen as legendary heroes of society. They are trained on everything from the mindset they need, to the technicalities of the bomb, to the technical fact that two angels will pick them up and take them to heaven as soon as they die. One bombing attempt goes wrong, the bombers suffer plenty of second thoughts and moral questions, they are affected by the sight of children, and finally, they go after paradise because they are driven into a corner, desperate and frustrated and want to go to heaven.And now comes the discussion: Is the movie objective? Are the anti-Israel speeches made by the protagonist or by the director? Many reviewers claim this movie is objective and presents two sides; but the only two sides are on differing ways to fight the occupation of Israel.The occupation is presented as an absolute evil, and the Israelis are claimed to have no morals by both 'sides'. The Israelis are after ethnic cleansing and the humiliation and control of Palestinians, but, claims the peace-loving girl, by bombing them up 'we are merely giving them an excuse to continue killing and humiliating us'. How on earth is this objective? It's a trick. By presenting a relatively moderate point of view, it gives the feeling of balance.Here are some objective and verifiable facts to balance out the propaganda in this film: When the land was split into two nations, the first thing Palestinians did was attack. They lost (just barely), and Egypt and Jordan occupied their land for 20 years. When Palestinians attacked Jordan, they were killed and driven out by Jordanians and promptly went to make a bigger mess in Lebanon. When Egypt and Jordan attacked Israel, Israel took the Palestinian land from them. When Israel offered land for peace, they refused to talk and attacked again a few years later. Israel continues to occupy land that has been repeatedly used for aggression and murder, and every time peace talks are initiated, the Palestinians increase their attacks. When Israel forces out settlers to give them Gaza, instead of bulding a nation, they use it to attack Israel even harder.And then we have the official Palestinian government's (Hamas) charter that says Israel does not have a right to exist, it must be destroyed, and that all talks with Israel are useless and bad. This is in writing and can be verified by anyone and yet the majority of Palestinians voted for Hamas and support suicide bombing. Even the word 'Palestine' is a symbol of occupation forced by Romans over the Jews. There were Jewish 'Palestinians' in this land continously for thousands of years way before the Muslims even existed, and yet we are occupiers? We have no right to exist? The only reason there were fewer Jews than Arabs here is because they were repeatedly thrown out or killed, and weren't allowed back in.One serious mistake Israel made was to allow settlements on this land before the issues and partitions were settled. But if the Arabs had negotiated for peace back in the 1970s, the settlements wouldn't have had a chance to spread. And when push came to shove, Sharon uprooted settlements for the Palestinians in Gaza.I and most other Israelis want the 'Palestinians' to have their land and freedom. I want to respect them, to treat them as neighbours, to trade with them. But every time we turn to them for peace, we get bombed. Yes, the barriers, curfews, and occupations are evil. But without them we get bombed every day. History has proven this over and over again. Every time we pull out they launch another attack. Every time we give them something, they use it against us to kill us. When they do get land they show no interest in building an economy and a nation, only to attack. So we have no choice but to keep 'humiliating' them. Otherwise we'd be dead. It's their official policy to kill us when we turn to them for peace. This is a fact, in writing, supported by a majority of their citizens, AND proven a dozen times over by history.So going back to the movie: If what the movie shows is truly what Palestinians feel and think, and all they see is the occupation and Israeli soldiers ruining their lives and taking away their freedom, then it is an amazing phenomenon of blind rage that doesn't know when to quit or when to try alternatives. I agree that we are humiliating and killing them, but have they given us a choice?I watched this movie to understand them, and now, unfortunately, I do. For this reason, I recommend this movie. But, as opposed to what another reviewer said, to understand is not to forgive.I hope one day the Palestinians will understand our point of view. That we are willing to give them their own state and freedom as long as they don't want us dead and that they make us believe that over 60 years of continuous blind rage and religious hate are over. You want your own state? Then next time we come to you to talk peace for the umpteenth time, call a cease-fire, recognize us as potential neighbours and stop killing our children. It's that simple.",2,Watch and Understand,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,6384,"['Being', 'Israel', 'movie', 'bound', 'affect', 'different', 'ways', 'Hearing', 'was', 'Palestinian', 'point', 'view',
