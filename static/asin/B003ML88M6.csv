1354369,A13XZMQMQQQ5SA,B003ML88M6,Craig,"[2, 3]","I sat through two and a half episodes of this show.  I thought the first episode was terrible, but decided to give them another chance.  The second show was almost as bad as the first.  By the third show, I had to shut it off half way through.  Even though Amazon Prime gives this show away for FREE, I just can't stomach it.  What is so appealing about two annoying overweight brothers with LOUD Texas accents, a pickup truck and a trailer full of giant television sets from Costco?  Even the bleach blonde sidekick looks like she's been around the block a few too many times.  They take the simplest, most obvious and quite frankly, BORING, aspects of Ghost Hunters and Ghost Adventures and try to put a southern spin on it.  The end result is that it falls flat on its face.  This show is as entertaining as an infomercial.  The only voice I can stand to listen to is Mike Rowe, who must be under some kind of unholy contractual commitment with the Discovery Channel to do schlep like this.  Please, Discovery Channel, cancel this show and replace it with something about people who have 30 kids who all wear tiaras; it'd be less damaging to our brains.",1,"Even though it's free with Prime, I don't want to watch it.",1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,1156,"['sat', 'two', 'half', 'episodes', 'show', 'thought', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'terrible', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'second', 'show', 'was', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'first', 'third', 'show', 'had', 'shut', 'off', 'half', 'way', 'Even', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'show', 'away', 'FREE', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'What', 'so', 'appealing', 'two', 'annoying', 'overweight', 'brothers', 'LOUD', 'Texas', 'accents', 'pickup', 'truck', 'trailer', 'full', 'giant', 'television', 'sets', 'Costco', 'Even', 'bleach', 'blonde', 'sidekick', 'looks', 'been', 'block', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'take', 'simplest', 'most', 'obvious', 'quite', 'frankly', 'BORING', 'aspects', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Ghost', 'Adventures', 'try', 'put', 'southern', 'spin', 'end', 'result', 'flat', 'face', 'show', 'as', 'entertaining', 'infomercial', 'only', 'voice', 'can', 'stand', 'listen', 'Mike', 'Rowe', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'kind', 'unholy', 'contractual', 'commitment', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'do', 'schlep', 'Please', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'cancel', 'show', 'replace', 'something', 'people', 'who', 'have', '30', 'kids', 'who', 'wear', 'tiaras', ""'d"", 'be', 'less', 'damaging', 'brains']",N/A
