I'm hit or miss when it comes to Damon as an actor, but I'm also hesitant about action series and spy suspense action flicks, when there have been so man attempts out there, so done right, and so many done wrong.  Bourne, though, was a nice surprise.Damon's performance throughout the films is very consistent, and mostly believable.  I think the supporting cast generally takes the spotlight when they're on sometimes, but the casting was very well done on that level, too.  The ancillary characters bring a lot of flavor to the overall dish, but without completely stealing the show or overpowering the main plot.  I especially enjoyed Chris Cooper and Franka Potente in Identity, Joan Allen in both Supremacy and Ultimatum, and Julia Stiles in all three (what little we see of her).

1105918,A3SP6GHL4UVUMZ,B000W07EKW,C. Holmes,"[1, 1]","This series is really well done and the Blu-Ray only adds to the quality of the films.(1) The first film is very understated in its action sequences.  Only 1 explosion, completely justified, and a chase scene that rivals any in film history.  To get an idea of the accuracy just watch the sequence when the police officer on the motorbike flips over the car and smacks his helmet.  Every sound is authentic and really adds to the overall product.  I will say that the greatest disappointment in the films is the female lead played by German actress Franka Potente.  Being of German decent and speaking German quite well I can say that she over acted many scenes and was never really a well-developed character.  She just whines throughout the whole movie being surprised by the same issues over and over again and saying schei&szlig;e every two seconds.(2) The second film is where it gets a little fuzzy on cinematography, but the story is so sound that you don't mind the seizure inducing camera movements.  Again the action is understated and all reactions seem appropriate.  The opening scene of Bourne and Marie crossing the bridge being chased by a sniper is still my favorite seen (see above for reference).  The new director I think takes the 'sense of action' idea a bit too far, but again the Blu-Ray captures everything in the scenes and the sounds perfectly.(3) The third and final Matt Damon Bourne movie is a nice combination of the first two films.  The scenes are well thought out and the plot is quite deep and comes to a solid conclusion as to why and how he became the way he is.  You will get a little bit of the blur 'sense of action' junk from the second film but it is much reduced and returns to the actual story.Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of spy movies.  While Bourne and James Bond are really nothing alike, because of the series success they are constantly compared.  If you like big explosions, gadgets, and amazing vehicles and women keep watching the Bond films I certainly do (Skyfall is Amazing!).  If you like deeper characters, realism, and amazing hand to hand combat then Bourne is for you.  I like them both, but they should be held as exclusive from one another.  I think the Blu-Ray, like most films, is really only needed for cinephiles or audiophiles.

Loosely based on three novels by Robert Ludlum, this trilogy focuses on amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne, on the run from mysterious enemies and looking for the key to his missing past.  Matt Damon is absolutely superb in what has become an intensely physical but emotionally understated signature role as Jason Bourne.""The Bourne Identity"" introduces Jason Bourne as a wounded man found floating in the Mediterranean.  Rescued by a fishing boat, the amnesiac young man is sent on to a bank in Zurich, based on an account number found implanted in a capsule under his skin.  Along the way to Zurich, Bourne discovers he has lethal fighting skills, which become essential to his survival when his appearance at the bank triggers a manhunt by the CIA.  Bourne will have to run for his life, accompanied by an attractive German drifter played by Franka Potente.In ""The Bourne Supremacy"", Jason Bourne is hiding in India with his girlfriend from the first movie.  He struggles with unclear memories of his life as an assassin.  When Bourne is framed for a murder in Berlin, the CIA and a mysterious Russian oil magnate take up lethal pursuit.  Bourne must return to Europe for a fateful confrontation with his pursuers and with his past.""The Bourne Ultimatum"" picks up Jason Bourne where the last movie left him, wounded, on the run in Russia, and suffering flashbacks of his indoctrination as an assassin.  A journalist provides a clue to the program that created him and Bourne will race the CIA to his starting point in New York, hounded by fellow CIA assassins.Joan Allen has a recurring role as a sympathetic CIA official who is a sometime ally in Bourne's quest for his identity.  Julia Styles also has a recurring role as a CIA logistician who figured in Bourne's original assignment.  Top notch casts fill out each of the three stories.  The movies themselves were filmed in a jagged, sometimes grainy, and always fast-moving cinematic style, full of stunts and carried by Jason Bourne's uncanny instincts for coping with any situation.  If the respective plots have a few logic holes, the action moves fast enough through a series of exotic locations to more than distract the viewer.""The Bourne Trilogy"" is very highly recommended as first rate entertainment for modern fans of the spy genre.",5,First Rate Entertainment...,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,2435,"['Bourne', 'Trilogy', 'three', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'action', 'thrillers', 'one', 'package', 'full', 'first', 'rate', 'action', 'entertainment', 'Loosely', 'based', 'three', 'novels', 'Robert', 'Ludlum', 'trilogy', 'amnesiac', 'CIA', 'assassin', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'run', 'mysterious', 'enemies', 'looking', 'key', 'missing', 'past', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'what', 'become', 'intensely', 'physical', 'emotionally', 'understated', 'signature', 'role', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'introduces', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'wounded', 'man', 'found', 'floating', 'Mediterranean', 'Rescued', 'fishing', 'boat', 'amnesiac', 'young', 'man', 'sent', 'bank', 'Zurich', 'based', 'account', 'number', 'found', 'implanted', 'capsule', 'skin', 'way', 'Zurich', 'Bourne', 'lethal', 'fighting', 'skills', 'become', 'essential', 'survival', 'when', 'appearance', 'bank', 'manhunt', 'CIA', 'Bourne', 'will', 'have', 'run', 'life', 'accompanied', 'attractive', 'German', 'drifter', 'played', 'Franka', 'Potente.In', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'hiding', 'India', 'girlfriend', 'first', 'movie', 'unclear', 'memories', 'life', 'assassin', 'When', 'Bourne', 'framed', 'murder', 'Berlin', 'CIA', 'mysterious', 'Russian', 'oil', 'magnate', 'take', 'up', 'lethal', 'pursuit', 'Bourne', 'must', 'return', 'Europe', 'fateful', 'confrontation', 'pursuers', 'past', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'up', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'where', 'last', 'movie', 'left', 'wounded', 'run', 'Russia', 'suffering', 'flashbacks', 'indoctrination', 'assassin', 'journalist', 'clue', 'program', 'created', 'Bourne', 'will', 'race', 'CIA', 'starting', 'point', 'New', 'York', 'hounded', 'fellow', 'CIA', 'assassins.Joan', 'Allen', 'recurring', 'role', 'sympathetic', 'CIA', 'official', 'who', 'sometime', 'ally', 'Bourne', 'quest', 'identity', 'Julia', 'Styles', 'also', 'recurring', 'role', 'CIA', 'logistician', 'who', 'figured', 'Bourne', 'original', 'assignment', 'Top', 'notch', 'casts', 'fill', 'out', 'three', 'stories', 'movies', 'were', 'filmed', 'jagged', 'sometimes', 'grainy', 'always', 'fast-moving', 'cinematic', 'style', 'full', 'stunts', 'carried', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'uncanny', 'instincts', 'coping', 'situation', 'respective', 'plots', 'have', 'few', 'logic', 'holes', 'action', 'fast', 'enough', 'series', 'exotic', 'locations', 'more', 'distract', 'viewer', 'Bourne', 'Trilogy', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'first', 'rate', 'entertainment', 'modern', 'fans', 'spy', 'genre']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

1105974,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B000W07EKW,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 1]","Being a fan of Ludlum's ""Bourne"" books, I was eagerly anticipating the first film of the series to see how exactly Doug Liman and writer Tony Gilroy were going to adapt the anti-hero to a more modern setting. Taking it from the jungles of Vietnam and the pursuit of Carlos the Jackal, and making it into a high-speed, high-intensity techno-thriller that is quite literally about identity was no small feat. And also making it a really intelligent, extremely well-acted actioner was a task that Liman, Gilroy, and Damon were able to pull off quite well. THE BOURNE IDENTITY set us up for everything that was to come: a very independent attitude brought to the Hollywood style of filmmaking; a great cast of indie players, like Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, Brian Cox and Clive Owen; a refreshing approach to the immediacy and improvisation of hand-to-hand combat; it's a near-perfect modernization of the tale of Jason Bourne.THE BOURNE SUPREMACY took that even further. With director Paul Greengrass coming in, who, instead of opting for Liman's more distanced approach to the action which is more appropriate for a Hollywood film, took us directly into the action. With fast cuts, shaky camera shots, and use of sound so that we no longer seem like we're watching the combat, but actually a participant in it, Greengrass (and returning writer Gilroy) sets a slightly different tone, and heightens the intensity that much more. And with the additions of Joan Allen and Karl Urban and Martin Csokas, and keeping Cox, Stiles, Potente and Cooper, Greengrass knows how to do it right. This is most certainly not a film for purists of the Bourne books because this film perhaps has more deviations than the other films from the book's plot points, but it keeps with the main plot, which is the Bourne impostor designed to bring Bourne out in the open. Also Greengrass seems to have more of a handle on bringing a more intense and more personal tale out of the character of Jason Bourne than Liman did, but that also may be a luxury of doing a sequel as well.THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM is the ultimate icing on the cake of this series, and is quite simply the best film of the series. Greengrass comes back onboard, with Gilroy in tow as well, and they bring actors like Paddy Considine, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney and the always-great David Strathairn to round it out. The film is ingenious in many ways, most specifically how it ties this film to SUPREMACY, because scenes that we saw in the previous film reappear in this one in very, very suprising ways. But Greengrass ups the ante once again, and brings Bourne full circle to where it all began. And again, Greengrass never lets up on the viewer for a second once the intrigue and the action and the suspense begin. He lets those moments build to a full boil, and just when you think you can't take it anymore, he goes for the kill.It's obvious the mark that the BOURNE films have left on the contemporary spy thriller. If you watch the Bond film QUANTUM OF SOLACE, it seems like there are literally entire scenes stolen from the BOURNE films. Unfortunately that didn't help that film. But fortunately, if it can help to reshape the genre of the spy thriller and bring it in a new and more vital direction, with less emphasis on gadgetry and more on character while keeping the globe-trotting action and suspense, then it makes the BOURNE TRILOGY all that much better.",5,The only film trilogy I've ever seen where the films got progressively better!,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,3426,"['Being', 'fan', 'Ludlum', 'Bourne', 'books', 'was', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'see', 'how', 'exactly', 'Doug', 'Liman', 'writer', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'were', 'going', 'adapt', 'anti-hero', 'more', 'modern', 'setting', 'Taking', 'jungles', 'Vietnam', 'pursuit', 'Carlos', 'Jackal', 'making', 'high-speed', 'high-intensity', 'techno-thriller', 'quite', 'literally', 'identity', 'was', 'small', 'feat', 'also', 'making', 'really', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'well-acted', 'actioner', 'was', 'task', 'Liman', 'Gilroy', 'Damon', 'were', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'BOURNE', 'IDENTITY', 'set', 'up', 'everything', 'was', 'come', 'very', 'independent', 'attitude', 'brought', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'great', 'cast', 'indie', 'players', 'Chris', 'Cooper', 'Franka', 'Potente', 'Julia', 'Stiles', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'refreshing', 'approach', 'immediacy', 'improvisation', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'near-perfect', 'modernization', 'tale', 'Jason', 'Bourne.THE', 'BOURNE', 'SUPREMACY', 'took', 'even', 'further', 'director', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'coming', 'who', 'instead', 'opting', 'Liman', 'more', 'distanced', 'approach', 'action', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'took', 'directly', 'action', 'fast', 'cuts', 'shaky', 'camera', 'shots', 'use', 'sound', 'longer', 'seem', ""'re"", 'watching', 'combat', 'actually', 'participant', 'Greengrass', 'returning', 'writer', 'Gilroy', 'slightly', 'different', 'tone', 'intensity', 'much', 'more', 'additions', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Martin', 'Csokas', 'keeping', 'Cox', 'Stiles', 'Potente', 'Cooper', 'Greengrass', 'how', 'do', 'right', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'purists', 'Bourne', 'books', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'deviations', 'other', 'films', 'book', 'plot', 'points', 'main', 'plot', 'Bourne', 'impostor', 'designed', 'bring', 'Bourne', 'out', 'open', 'Also', 'Greengrass', 'have', 'more', 'handle', 'bringing', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'personal', 'tale', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'Liman', 'did', 'also', 'may', 'be', 'luxury', 'doing', 'sequel', 'well.THE', 'BOURNE', 'ULTIMATUM', 'ultimate', 'icing', 'cake', 'series', 'quite', 'simply', 'best', 'film', 'series', 'Greengrass', 'back', 'onboard', 'Gilroy', 'tow', 'as', 'well', 'bring', 'actors', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'always-great', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'round', 'out', 'film', 'ingenious', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'specifically', 'how', 'film', 'SUPREMACY', 'scenes', 'saw', 'previous', 'film', 'reappear', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'suprising', 'ways', 'Greengrass', 'ups', 'ante', 'once', 'again', 'Bourne', 'full', 'circle', 'where', 'began', 'again', 'Greengrass', 'never', 'up', 'viewer', 'second', 'once', 'intrigue', 'action', 'suspense', 'begin', 'moments', 'build', 'full', 'boil', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'kill.It', 'obvious', 'mark', 'BOURNE', 'films', 'have', 'left', 'contemporary', 'spy', 'thriller', 'watch', 'Bond', 'film', 'QUANTUM', 'OF', 'SOLACE', 'are', 'literally', 'entire', 'scenes', 'stolen', 'BOURNE', 'films', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'fortunately', 'can', 'help', 'reshape', 'genre', 'spy', 'thriller', 'bring', 'new', 'more', 'vital', 'direction', 'less', 'emphasis', 'gadgetry', 'more', 'character', 'keeping', 'globe-trotting', 'action', 'suspense', 'then', 'BOURNE', 'TRILOGY', 'that', 'much', 'better']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

The movies have an over arching storyline, with the exception of the first because it can stand on it own or with the rest of the series. Now on to a review of each movie.The Bourne Identity is about a man who wakes up with amnesia and discovers he's a government assassin who failed to pull the trigger. Soon after said government finds out he's alive wants to tie off loose ends and by tie off I mean kill both Bourne and his ally Marie an American traveler who helps in his evasion. The film ends on a happy note with Bourne reuniting with Marie in Greece.The Bourne Supremacy takes off where the first left off Bourne is with Marie in India and is being hunted by the CIA for a bombing he is framed for. Marie is shot and Bourne is on a quest for revenge and eventually clears his name and the film ends with Bourne going on a crusade to apologize to the families on the people he assassinated.The Bourne Ultimatum is Bourne trying to find his true identity and still being pursued by the CIA.Nothing else to say except these movies are nothing more than a thrill ride with an engaging story that should be watched if you even have a passing interest in the genre.",4,A Truly Great Trilogy,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,1520,"['series', 'When', 'first', 'watched', 'series', 'hated', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'jarring', 'transitions', 'then', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'more', 'as', 'do', 'most', 'people', 'movies', 'are', 'what', 'call', 'true', 'sequels', 'taking', 'place', 'moments', 'film', 'e.g', 'Back', 'Future', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'movies', 'have', 'arching', 'storyline', 'exception', 'first', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'rest', 'series', 'Now', 'review', 'movie.The', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'amnesia', 'government', 'assassin', 'who', 'failed', 'pull', 'trigger', 'Soon', 'said', 'government', 'out', 'alive', 'tie', 'off', 'loose', 'ends', 'tie', 'mean', 'kill', 'Bourne', 'ally', 'Marie', 'American', 'traveler', 'who', 'evasion', 'film', 'happy', 'note', 'Bourne', 'reuniting', 'Marie', 'Greece.The', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'Bourne', 'Marie', 'India', 'being', 'hunted', 'CIA', 'bombing', 'framed', 'Marie', 'shot', 'Bourne', 'quest', 'revenge', 'eventually', 'name', 'film', 'Bourne', 'going', 'crusade', 'apologize', 'families', 'people', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Bourne', 'trying', 'find', 'true', 'identity', 'still', 'being', 'pursued', 'CIA.Nothing', 'else', 'say', 'movies', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'thrill', 'ride', 'engaging', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'even', 'have', 'passing', 'interest', 'genre']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

In which Bourne really blames eevryone for what he becomes *SPOILER* ultimately Bourne must find.. he has to blame himself. *SPOILER*BUT.. the big thing really is.. that Bourne was from the beginning like most action heroes.. a reluctant one.. and still is.. unlike Rambo who would lay down the mantle for piece.. but be roused back into it. Bourne would have been content trying to piece himself together and stay a quiet anonymous existence living in India.. or wherever he wants.. without the gunplay and the killing.. these were never something that felt missing from him.. unlike Rambo who would never truly be himself without being through some.. torture or fight. Granted in some of the films.. we see some depth to Rambo, mostly through his end monologues (although there is a fantastic quiet scene in part II on a river boat, I am sure most Rambo fans know it). Bourne, on the other hand.. isn't that. He's very reluctant.. and sorrowful. Realizing what he was.. and.. trying for a quiet moment to atone for the wrong he has done.This is what has really made Bourne something very different, unique and special in the action field. Granted.. he's part MacGyver.. and unstoppable when he wants to be.. but he's also one who can fight tooth and nail.. and then feel the depth of the wrongs he's done.Ultimatum is a very odd film.. technically a PREQUEL (yeah it threw me off as well going in) AND a sequel rolled into one. Bourne finally discovers what he was.. and who he is. a very satisfying wrapup to the series.. unlike a previous reviewer, I can only say the Bourne series has gotten BETTER with each successive installment. And if there'a a fourth, I hope its great.. but if there isn't.. then that's ok too.. this is an END.. and a good one at that.",4,More than mindless action..,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,2777,"['will', 'start', 'saying', 'HATED', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'theater..', 'when', 'watched', 'second', 'timr..', 'realized..', 'was', 'bit', 'not', 'much', 'bit', 'bit', 'more', 'it..', 'whole', 'Justin', 'Long', 'character', 'being', 'lens', 'see', 'chaos', 'world', 'thrown', 'in..NOW..', 'relating', 'Bourne', 'were', 'long', 'sequences', 'action..', 'car', 'crashes', 'chases..', 'seemed', 'inexplicable', 'almost..', 'BUT', 'comparing', 'mindless', 'action', 'flick', 'Die', 'Hard', '4', 'example..', 'where', 'good', 'guy', 'been', 'shot..', 'bleeding', 'now', 'driving', 'trailor', 'tractor', 'rig', 'being', 'shot', 'out', 'missiles', 'F-35', 'bridge', 'exploding', 'RIGHT', 'behind', 'him..', 'bright', 'RIGHT', 'OK..', 'Bourne', 'always', 'been', 'action..', 'true..', 'far', 'ACTION', 'film', 'BUT', 'also', 'agree', 'previous', 'poster', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'stuck', 'Bourne..', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'WHO', 'is..', 'three', 'films', 'ending', 'almost', 'CRUSHING', 'revelation', 'third', 'film..', 'Bourne', 'really', 'eevryone', 'what', '*SPOILER*', 'ultimately', 'Bourne', 'must', 'find..', 'blame', '*SPOILER*BUT..', 'big', 'thing', 'really', 'Bourne', 'was', 'beginning', 'most', 'action', 'heroes..', 'reluctant', 'one..', 'still', 'is..', 'Rambo', 'who', 'would', 'lay', 'down', 'mantle', 'piece..', 'be', 'roused', 'back', 'Bourne', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'content', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'stay', 'quiet', 'anonymous', 'existence', 'living', 'India..', 'wherever', 'gunplay', 'killing..', 'were', 'never', 'something', 'felt', 'missing', 'him..', 'Rambo', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'being', 'some..', 'torture', 'fight', 'Granted', 'films..', 'see', 'depth', 'Rambo', 'mostly', 'end', 'monologues', 'fantastic', 'quiet', 'scene', 'part', 'II', 'river', 'boat', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'Rambo', 'fans', 'know', 'Bourne', 'other', 'hand..', ""n't"", 'that', 'very', 'reluctant..', 'sorrowful', 'Realizing', 'what', 'was..', 'and..', 'trying', 'quiet', 'moment', 'atone', 'wrong', 'done.This', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'Bourne', 'something', 'very', 'different', 'unique', 'special', 'action', 'field', 'Granted..', 'part', 'MacGyver..', 'unstoppable', 'when', 'be..', 'also', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'fight', 'nail..', 'then', 'feel', 'depth', 'wrongs', 'done.Ultimatum', 'very', 'odd', 'film..', 'technically', 'PREQUEL', 'yeah', 'threw', 'off', 'as', 'well', 'going', 'sequel', 'rolled', 'one', 'Bourne', 'finally', 'what', 'was..', 'who', 'very', 'satisfying', 'wrapup', 'series..', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Bourne', 'series', 'gotten', 'BETTER', 'successive', 'installment', 'fourth', 'hope', 'great..', ""isn't.."", 'then', 'ok', 'too..', 'END..', 'good', 'one']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

1106008,A3LOXOMPX3ZPRK,B000W07EKW,"Lawrence Brown ""Larry Brown""","[8, 88]","My review mostly relates to the 3rd installment, ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" I rate that movie only one star. However, because this set includes the much better ""Bourne Supremacy,"" I'll average the rating out to three stars.Bourne Ultimatum (movie #3) is similar to Bourne Identity (movie #1) in that it exists simply for the sake of the action. There's hardly any literary content at all. It's just a straightforward plot that moves the action along. It's like so many other action movies. Sure the production is impressive with explosions, stunts, car chases, fighting, etc, but as far as dialog, motivations, characters, plot twists, or anything else clever, that's all been carefully stripped out. That doesn't cut it for me and I rate this movie low. I like the Bourne Supremacy (movie #2) the best. That one has more story.Other reviewers here agree with me on the above points, but I disagree with them on the excellence of the action. I don't think it's all that great as I'll explain below along with my low opinions on the lack of story. I agree with another reviewer here that my review on the literary merit of the movie is a waste of time. The movie is about action and that's it. Critiquing its literary merits is like critiquing the safeness of a motorcycle. It's simply not about that.Anyway....The girl in this movie hardly speaks at all. She just walks around looking dumb and worried. If the girl was paid by the line, they paid her about $50 for her ""role."" Her close-ups become comical because repeatedly they cut to her, she looks worriedly into the camera, and then doesn't speak.As many others have pointed out, the shaky camera work is annoying/nauseating/amateurish direction. I really hated it and it really did make me sick.The story has a long, straightforward build up to an ultra-lame, straightforward conclusion, which makes me feel like I wasted my time. What's the big deal about his training anyway...you just need to train him as a sniper, which is no big deal, and then you're done. What Jason does is not that different than any other soldier, especially a sniper. Much more interesting was Bridget Fonda in ""Point of No Return"" and her cycle of training, initiation, and wanting out.Again in the ""unintentionally funny"" department, we get comedy/spoof/""so bad it's funny"" like running commentary:""He's looking right at her!""""He drove off the roof!""As if we, the audience, couldn't see that he just drove off the roof. Actually this comedy material was some of the best fun this movie has to offer.Jason takes the unneeded/indefensible risk of calling the CIA security down on him before he even cracks the safe. No trained burglar would do that. He just needed to hang up the phone as soon as the guy answered and said his name. And if cracking the safe was that easy the CIA wouldn't be using that safe. How did Jason know that the spook used his name as the safe voice password? He could have used any phrase. Ludicrous.During the chase where the assassin chases the girl, Jason repeatedly jumps through the windows. Once is enough, twice is repetitious, thrice is an eye roll. He did it, like, six times. Severe lack of imagination on the part of the movie makers. Plus, that assassin must be a super blood hound to be able to track the girl from the street as she runs around on the rooftops.Grade (for Bourne Ultimatum): Waste of time.",3,All action and  no story make for a dull movie.,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,3375,"['review', 'mostly', '3rd', 'installment', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'rate', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'However', 'set', 'much', 'better', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', ""'ll"", 'average', 'rating', 'out', 'three', 'stars.Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'movie', '3', 'similar', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'movie', '1', 'simply', 'sake', 'action', 'hardly', 'literary', 'content', 'just', 'straightforward', 'plot', 'action', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'action', 'movies', 'Sure', 'production', 'impressive', 'explosions', 'stunts', 'car', 'chases', 'fighting', 'etc', 'as', 'far', 'dialog', 'motivations', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'anything', 'else', 'clever', 'been', 'carefully', 'stripped', 'out', ""n't"", 'cut', 'rate', 'movie', 'low', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'movie', '2', 'best', 'one', 'more', 'story.Other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'agree', 'above', 'points', 'disagree', 'excellence', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'that', 'great', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'along', 'low', 'opinions', 'lack', 'story', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'here', 'review', 'literary', 'merit', 'movie', 'waste', 'time', 'movie', 'action', 'Critiquing', 'literary', 'merits', 'critiquing', 'safeness', 'motorcycle', 'simply', 'not', 'that.Anyway', '.The', 'girl', 'movie', 'hardly', 'just', 'walks', 'around', 'looking', 'dumb', 'worried', 'girl', 'was', 'paid', 'line', 'paid', '50', 'role', 'close-ups', 'become', 'comical', 'repeatedly', 'cut', 'worriedly', 'camera', 'then', ""n't"", 'speak.As', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'annoying/nauseating/amateurish', 'direction', 'really', 'hated', 'really', 'did', 'make', 'sick.The', 'story', 'long', 'straightforward', 'build', 'up', 'ultra-lame', 'straightforward', 'conclusion', 'feel', 'wasted', 'time', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'training', 'anyway', 'just', 'need', 'train', 'sniper', 'big', 'deal', 'then', ""'re"", 'done', 'What', 'Jason', 'not', 'different', 'other', 'soldier', 'especially', 'sniper', 'Much', 'more', 'interesting', 'was', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Point', 'No', 'Return', 'cycle', 'training', 'initiation', 'wanting', 'out.Again', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'department', 'get', 'comedy/spoof/', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'running', 'commentary', 'looking', 'right', 'drove', 'off', 'roof', 'audience', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'just', 'drove', 'off', 'roof', 'Actually', 'comedy', 'material', 'was', 'best', 'fun', 'movie', 'offer.Jason', 'unneeded/indefensible', 'risk', 'calling', 'CIA', 'security', 'down', 'even', 'safe', 'trained', 'burglar', 'would', 'do', 'just', 'needed', 'hang', 'up', 'phone', 'as', 'soon', 'guy', 'answered', 'said', 'name', 'cracking', 'safe', 'was', 'easy', 'CIA', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'using', 'safe', 'How', 'did', 'Jason', 'know', 'spook', 'used', 'name', 'safe', 'voice', 'password', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'phrase', 'Ludicrous.During', 'chase', 'where', 'assassin', 'girl', 'Jason', 'repeatedly', 'windows', 'Once', 'enough', 'twice', 'repetitious', 'eye', 'roll', 'did', 'six', 'times', 'Severe', 'lack', 'imagination', 'part', 'movie', 'makers', 'assassin', 'must', 'be', 'super', 'blood', 'hound', 'be', 'able', 'track', 'girl', 'street', 'around', 'rooftops.Grade', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'Waste', 'time']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

1106012,A226HIHIVFUPLL,B000W07EKW,Lev Raphael,"[50, 69]","I am a fan of serious literate movies and also a fan of action flicks (a mystery writer and also a writer of serious literary fiction as you can see from my web site [...]) and the Bourne series is a canny, sometimes brilliant hybrid of genres.  Yes, there's exciting, breathtaking action all the way through, but there's a great deal more.  The movies start with a man who's lost his identity, and the loss goes much deeper than he realizes.  He seeks both knowledge and revenge once the depth of his damage becomes clearer, and learning who he really is and what he's done, and what the cost has been to others, is a terrible but thrilling burden (for us, anyway).  What the reviewer below completely missed is the subtle, touching performance by Matt Damon who does a great deal with not a lot of dialogue--though the reviewer below exaggerates about the script.  Damon is remarkable.  The other cast members along the way, like the wonderful Franka Potente from ""Run Lola Run"" and of course the inimitable Joan Allen add depth, humor, passion, darkness.  At a time when government policies are so controversial, the trilogy is a powerful condemnation of victory at any cost thanks to Matt Damon's layered, sophisticated performance.

As he tried to find himself, he fell in love and ended with the woman of his non-existent dreams.In 2004, Bourne returned and his love was killed before his eyes. It seems someone framed him for a theft and the CIA is out to get him once and for all. Having warned them he would retaliate, he fulfills his promise.Now it's 2007 and there is more to the story of Jason Bourne, aka David Webb. Bourne is on the trail of the CIA still, hoping to find out more about his past and why he can't remember a thing.When Bourne resurfaces and contacts a news reporter who may have information for him, the reporter is killed and the hunt for Bourne begins anew. But one thing that these CIA officials seem to never learn is that just who is hunting who is a question that should have been asked long ago.The head of the CIA (Scott Glenn) brings in NSA member Noah Vossen (David Strathairn) and Pam Landy (Joan Allen) to use the full resources on hand to find Bourne. At the same time, they are trying to track down the link that contacted the reporter. An attempt to tie up what they consider loose ends results in more death and more reason for Bourne to tie up loose ends of his own. A solution needs to be found and Bourne will find it.Damon does an awesome job of making the difficult seem easy. The fight sequences are top of the line, fast moving and totally believable. His acting comes through as well, never resorting to action and nothing else. You believe that his is a troubled mind that will pull out all the stops to solve the mystery.Now, for fans of the series of films there is a must have on sale. THE JASON BOURNE COLLECTION is a box set with perks galore. Not only that, they've gone creative on the packaging, making the box look like a security box from a bank, a crucial element to the story.All three films are included in the set, all done to look as sharp and clear as possible. As well as the films and their own special features, there is another disc packaged in what appears to be a passport. This disc contains features about author Robert Ludlum, the creation of the Bourne character, a look at the success of the series and original trailers for all three films.For thriller fans, for spy fans, for Ludlum fans and especially for Bourne fans, this is the set that they'll want to see under their Christmas tree.

Each film looks absolutely fantastic, the sound is spot on, and the films themselves are masterpieces by thriller standards. Bourne has become iconic; the Bond of the new generation. Matt Damon's all-american good looks, intensity, and acting skills give the films a credibility that many movies search for but never find.There are so many reasons to buy this collection. The transfer quality is nearly perfect in my opinion, but I am not the type to watch the films with a magnifying glass and look for any tiny mistakes. The surround sound is simply unreal. John Powell's score really comes to life and the depth of the sound effects are fantastic. The scene in Ultimatum that takes place in Waterloo Train Station is epic and should go down in cinema history as one of the best cat-and-mouse chase scenes ever made. The storyline is well constructed, believable, and leaves you hungry for more.Thankfully, there is a fourth Bourne movie in the works, with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass returning to make sure it is done right. I can't wait.There are few movies I will watch again and again, and these make that very short list. The best trilogy since the GODFATHER movies (sorry STAR WARS fans), these are a no brainer for any movie fan. 5/5 stars.*****UPDATE*****02/10/2010*****As a commenter has noted, it is not anything close to a sure thing that Greengrass and Damon will both be back for a 4th Bourne movie.

Action, adventure, thrills and twists, character development, and in moments when Bourne is taking a ""rest"" after a heavy chase (For example, when he gets on the train in Supremacy after the hectic chase), you will feel sympathy for him.** SPOILER ** When Bourne confronts the daughter of his earlier assignments, the mother and father, and tells her that he was the one who killed them (It was believed to be a murder-suicide and the general public believed it), this was and still is the most dramatic scene I will never forget! ** END SPOILER **The cinematography is well put also.

1106069,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000W07EKW,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","I have seen a lot of spy films.  For suspense, mystery, complexity that the viewer must unravel, and that strange quality that allows you to suspend your disbelief, this is undoubtedly the best trilogy of spydom I have ever seen.You start with Bourne waking with amnesia, struggling to remember who he is, but with his calculating mind and deadly skills wired into his DNA.  He is in danger and meets a wonderful girl, who is kind of a lost soul with great potential, that life force that one finds in sudden, true love.  She becomes his guide to the search for - or effort to reconstruct - his personality.Due to politics and a murderous bureaucracy, Bourne functioned as a kind of ultimate assassin.  (""I don't send you to kill...I send you to be invisible because you don't exist."")  Over the course of 3 films, we learn details of what he was made to be, and how.  At the end, we see that he hated what he had become, which in combination with his ""conditioning"", was the source of his amnesia.  It was psychological - wanting to find his earlier identity, which was taken from him in spite of his protests - as much as physical.His new life, of course, is tragic.  This makes it psychologically real, combined with the greatest acting that I have ever been found in a spy series.  In my view, Damon is one of the greatest actors alive, and he gives life to this role in a way I have never seen in a spy film.  The most interesting things is that each film in the series adds to the others, deepening the themes while offering heart-pounding suspense and sufficient realism and detail to enter the imagination.  Yet not everything is explained, so that many of the biggest conclusions lie under the surface.If I could give this series 6 stars I would.  I have watched each film numerous times and am never disappointed - it just gets richer.

So it was then that I decided to sit down with all three for my first look at each.The Bourne Identity,The Bourne SupremacyandThe Bourne Ultimatumall tie together nicely. Is it necessary to view them chronologically to comprehend what's going on? Probably not. Does it help? Most definitely. So this collection is perfect for anyone like me that has never seen the first two of the three films.Writer Tony Gilroy adapted all three films to the screen from three Robert Ludlum novels of the same name. Identity has a different (little known) director than the (little known) director of Supremacy and Ultimatum...but you'd never know it; all three are as hectically paced with fight and chase scenes that will blow viewers out of their chairs. So kudos to Gilroy for putting together 3 scripts that each director could easily translate onto film.Getting chased is the story of Jason Bourne's life. Fighting those who dare to chase him is Jason Bourne's game. Bourne is a government agent with an 'identity' crisis. And if there was ever a guy who could say, ""the world is out to get me,"" and mean it, it's him.

1106087,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B000W07EKW,Steve Douglas,"[3, 3]","All 3 films are pretty sitting on the edge of your seat exciting but most folk already know the story lines.  The first of the 3 films, The Bourne Identity has both excellent video and very discreet channel tracking in the audio.  The sound mixers did an excellent job of using all the surround channels and did not allow the soundtrack to hide the various foley effects in any of the front or rear channels.  Of course, in all the excitement, your subwoofer will get a fine workout.  The video transfer is quite good with no video noise, aliasing or artifacts.  This movie started the whole franchise and it was a super start.  My only question was how Bourne getting shot in the back brought out his amnesia in the first place.  That was never really answered as amnesia would generally come about from a serious head trauma and not from 2 bullets in the back.The Bourne Supremacy, the second film of the trilogy, made far greater use of the hand held camera, and while it didn't bother me, I recall a friend, and professional photographer, mentioning that it got him seasick.  The video transfer on Blu ray was excellent in all respects, but I also noticed a great deal less of directional audio use.  Rather than put money into more discreet sound editing the producers boosted up the sound track which pretty much enveloped the entire sound stage, front and rear.  It's not that the soundtrack did not fit the film, it certainly does, and creates the ambience of excitement the Bourne film requires, but a greater focus on the 5.1 sound stage for foley effects would have been nice.The last of the Trilogy, the  Bourne Ultimatum, completes the package with equal strength in the video transfer.  I saw no weaknesses in any of the video transfers for the 3 films, but once again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, you would think that with all the excitement going on, that  usage of the front sides and rear surrounds would be more prominent.  I was disappointed that, like the Bourne Supremacy, they simply upped the audio levels of the soundtrack which would overshadow any foley effects.I'm not saying there is no use of the discreets in either of the last two films, but no where as much as what could have been or as was used in the first Bourne Identity.  To save $ they just boost the soundtrack level and that is a shame.  During the fight scene there are things being thrown, glass breaking, and all sorts of mayhem that easily could have been steered to the left or right, front or back.  Thus, on that score, I was disappointed.Never the less, this is a great collection to have and the excitement and pacing of the 3 films is just excellent.  There are plenty of deleted scenes and other 'making of' shorts as well as commentary with no wasted space for previews and ads for other movies. Well worth the cost.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Bourne Trilogy on Blu Ray,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,3158,"['3', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'exciting', 'most', 'folk', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'lines', 'first', '3', 'films', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'excellent', 'video', 'very', 'discreet', 'channel', 'tracking', 'audio', 'sound', 'mixers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'using', 'surround', 'channels', 'did', 'not', 'allow', 'soundtrack', 'hide', 'various', 'foley', 'effects', 'front', 'rear', 'channels', 'course', 'excitement', 'subwoofer', 'will', 'get', 'fine', 'workout', 'video', 'transfer', 'quite', 'good', 'video', 'noise', 'aliasing', 'artifacts', 'movie', 'started', 'whole', 'franchise', 'was', 'super', 'start', 'only', 'question', 'was', 'how', 'Bourne', 'getting', 'shot', 'back', 'brought', 'out', 'amnesia', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'answered', 'amnesia', 'would', 'generally', 'come', 'serious', 'head', 'trauma', 'not', '2', 'bullets', 'back.The', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'second', 'film', 'trilogy', 'made', 'far', 'greater', 'use', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'recall', 'friend', 'professional', 'photographer', 'mentioning', 'got', 'seasick', 'video', 'transfer', 'Blu', 'ray', 'was', 'excellent', 'respects', 'also', 'noticed', 'great', 'deal', 'less', 'directional', 'audio', 'use', 'put', 'money', 'more', 'discreet', 'sound', 'editing', 'producers', 'boosted', 'up', 'sound', 'track', 'pretty', 'much', 'enveloped', 'entire', 'sound', 'stage', 'front', 'rear', 'not', 'soundtrack', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'film', 'certainly', 'ambience', 'excitement', 'Bourne', 'film', 'greater', 'focus', '5.1', 'sound', 'stage', 'foley', 'effects', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.The', 'last', 'Trilogy', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'package', 'equal', 'strength', 'video', 'transfer', 'saw', 'weaknesses', 'video', 'transfers', '3', 'films', 'once', 'again', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'would', 'think', 'excitement', 'going', 'usage', 'front', 'sides', 'rear', 'surrounds', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'prominent', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Bourne', 'Supremacy', 'simply', 'upped', 'audio', 'levels', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'overshadow', 'foley', 'effects.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'use', 'discreets', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'where', 'as', 'much', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'used', 'first', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'save', 'just', 'boost', 'soundtrack', 'level', 'shame', 'fight', 'scene', 'are', 'things', 'being', 'thrown', 'glass', 'breaking', 'sorts', 'mayhem', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'steered', 'left', 'right', 'front', 'back', 'Thus', 'score', 'was', 'disappointed.Never', 'less', 'great', 'collection', 'have', 'excitement', 'pacing', '3', 'films', 'just', 'excellent', 'are', 'plenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', ""'making"", 'shorts', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'wasted', 'space', 'previews', 'ads', 'other', 'movies', 'Well', 'cost.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

1106091,A2JFDCLA9PZGQ0,B000W07EKW,Teemacs,"[0, 0]","The Bourne films suffer from the same problem as do the recent Bond offerings - the world has fundamentally changed. The old adversary, the Soviet Union, has gone, and so has the master terrorist Carlos ""the Jackal"", Bourne's protagonist. Therefore, any updating unavoidably means major changes in plot. However, I think the updating has gone rather well, certainly better than the Daniel Craig Bonds.In cartoons, the characters are completely indestructible. Think of Wil-E-Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons. Jason Bourne is the equivalent of an entire Roadrunner cartoon, in that he has Wil-E-Coyote's apparently bottomless pit of ingenuity and finance and his ability to survive complete disaster, combined with Roadrunner's perpetual success in outwitting Wil-E (meep-beep!).So, given the complete impossibility of the whole enterprise, what makes these films so entertaining? Much of the credit lies with the excellent Matt Damon, who somehow makes into a living, breathing creature the character of Jason Bourne, the killing machine with no past, and, if various nefarious Washington types can help it, no future either. In addition, the one-man-against-the-system drama, especially a system gone bad with a fearsome apparatus and that apparently holds all the cards, is always a good story line - one tends to root fiercely for the little guy. If you want spectacular chases and fight scenes, forget James Bond, this is where it's all at - Bourne's ability to (almost literally) leap tall buildings with a single bound and demolish half-a-dozen armed assailants equipped only with a toothpick (okay, okay, I made that last bit up) is wonderful to behold. The last of the three films is especially good, as a particularly nasty CIA director is constantly outwitted by the ever-versatile and ingenious Bourne, and finally receives his come-uppance.As I say, all of this is as inherently absurd and cartoonish as Bond or Bauer, but I find it much more entertaining, and I hope that the proposed (and currently stalled) fourth Bourne film goes ahead.",4,Great fun,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2053,"['Bourne', 'films', 'suffer', 'same', 'problem', 'do', 'recent', 'Bond', 'offerings', 'world', 'fundamentally', 'changed', 'old', 'adversary', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'gone', 'so', 'master', 'terrorist', 'Carlos', 'Jackal', 'Bourne', 'protagonist', 'Therefore', 'updating', 'unavoidably', 'major', 'changes', 'plot', 'However', 'think', 'updating', 'gone', 'rather', 'well', 'certainly', 'better', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Bonds.In', 'cartoons', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'indestructible', 'Think', 'Wil-E-Coyote', 'Roadrunner', 'cartoons', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'equivalent', 'entire', 'Roadrunner', 'cartoon', 'Wil-E-Coyote', 'apparently', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'ingenuity', 'finance', 'ability', 'survive', 'complete', 'disaster', 'combined', 'Roadrunner', 'perpetual', 'success', 'outwitting', 'Wil-E', 'meep-beep', '.So', 'given', 'complete', 'impossibility', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'what', 'films', 'so', 'entertaining', 'Much', 'credit', 'excellent', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'who', 'somehow', 'living', 'breathing', 'creature', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'killing', 'machine', 'past', 'various', 'nefarious', 'Washington', 'types', 'can', 'help', 'future', 'either', 'addition', 'one-man-against-the-system', 'drama', 'especially', 'system', 'gone', 'bad', 'fearsome', 'apparatus', 'apparently', 'cards', 'always', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'one', 'root', 'fiercely', 'little', 'guy', 'want', 'spectacular', 'chases', 'fight', 'scenes', 'forget', 'James', 'Bond', 'where', 'Bourne', 'ability', 'almost', 'literally', 'leap', 'tall', 'buildings', 'single', 'bound', 'demolish', 'half-a-dozen', 'armed', 'assailants', 'equipped', 'only', 'toothpick', 'okay', 'okay', 'made', 'last', 'bit', 'up', 'wonderful', 'behold', 'last', 'three', 'films', 'especially', 'good', 'particularly', 'nasty', 'CIA', 'director', 'constantly', 'outwitted', 'ever-versatile', 'ingenious', 'Bourne', 'finally', 'come-uppance.As', 'say', 'as', 'inherently', 'absurd', 'cartoonish', 'Bond', 'Bauer', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'hope', 'proposed', 'currently', 'stalled', 'fourth', 'Bourne', 'film', 'ahead']",The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)

While he has forgotten who he is, he does remember how to stunt drive a car, shoot all kinds of weapons and knows a heap about technology and is perhaps the only fictional non-super hero who could whoop Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. He is Rambo with an IQ. And like all fictional heroes he is the only person in the world who can kill with one shot, while no one else can shoot straight.What is nice about the trilogy is that the movies mesh very well and get better as they go along.

The 1988 TV miniseries with Richard Chamberlain was pretty good, but then came these 3 films, and now, for me, Matt Damon simply *is* Jason Bourne. This package has all 3 Bourne movies+extras in a ""Swiss bank account"" box, complete with a cool mock-passport that has a special extra inside--a 4th disc with a nice bio of Robert Ludlum. And the silver box looks great on my DVD shelf. I'm 50+, but I feel like a kid again.As for the 3 movies themselves, what can I say that hasn't already been said? They're great. Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass are fine directors, and they seem to be inventing a new way to film action thrillers. The cast is first-rate, and the action sequences are among the best ever staged. The scripts have cleverly updated the original novels to reflect current events, and there's just the right somber, serious tone to them, especially regarding the central character's search for answers about his former life. There's been a lot of argument about the lightning-paced editing and the naturalistic lighting and the hand-held cameras, but I think these elements give the films their sharp edge and constant sense of immediacy. And Damon's portrait of the tormented hero is one for the books. Any way you look at it, the Bourne trilogy is incredibly intelligent, entertaining, state-of-the-art filmmaking.

But in exchange, I hope this review seems more in-depth now).(Note: Since I can't fit all 3 individual reviews into one entry, I've essentially condensed it down to a general overview of the plot, A/V specs and presentation, and only a list of the special features for each. The numbers you see don't necessarily equate to technical perfection, but those are the average numbers based on each movie and rounded up to the nearest whole or half number. To read the individual reviews, use the links below).http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y9M58QPFCXE/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permhttp://www.amazon.com/review/RFJDO2K5251W2/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permhttp://www.amazon.com/review/R1BYXHJU8KPQFN/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permMovie - 5.0The first time I ever saw this film series was from a total blind-buy. Previously, I never even wanted to touch it because I had this stupid, unexplainable bias against Matt Damon. To this day, I still can't remember why I had such feelings, but I'm glad I got over it, because The Bourne Trilogy is a masterfully-executed story that has changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. The Bourne Identity starts with the discovery of a man found overboard. He has two gunshot wounds in his back, a Swiss bank account in his hip, and no immediate recollection of who he is. Coincidentally, upon reaching the mainland it seems that he's a master in firearms and fisticuffs when he instinctively disables a couple of poor police officers that just happened to mess with the wrong guy. When he gets to the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport and his name: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). But to his surprise, there's a slew of other passports with the same picture and different names, in addition to lots of cash and even a handgun. Upon setting out to Paris, he meets a woman named Marie (Franka Potente), and the two of them would go on to face assassins and conspiracies while uncovering answers to who he is.In The Bourne Supremacy, we find the two in Goa living a life of peace after managing to escape pursuit. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. When Kirill attempts to find Bourne and assassinate him, Marie is killed in his stead. And in a rage of anger, Bourne decides to aspire vengeance on all those who had been chasing him. But in the process, he would discover a few more things about his past that would change him for the better.And in The Bourne Ultimatum, after a British reporter named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) discovers a new Treadstone replacement agency called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), Bourne figures to find the source of Ross' information so he can finally get the answers he'd been searching for, as well as putting an end to these agencies. Upon Ross' assassination, Bourne instills the aid of former Treadstone handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and receives the benefit of the doubt from Pamela Landy as he makes his way back home to New York and discovers the truth to everything he had forgotten.The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance as even more memories started to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but to many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken).Video - 5.0- Video codec: VC-1- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1, 2.35:1- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1The video quality of the series is pretty much perfect aside from the first one. In my initial review a few years ago, I said I wasn't pleased with Identity, but did a pretty crappy job explaining it. After reading up on the technicalities of film-making since then, I've gotten a much better grasp on how to explain and describe these things. That being said, Identity looks very good in terms of black levels, colors, and sharpness. Looking at a lot of the outdoor shots, especially, and a few indoor, the picture retains enough detail that it makes for a pleasant image for the trilogy's initial entry in HD. However, it does suffer from low contrast, giving it a somewhat murky look, and there are several occasions when dirt and a couple of scratches from print damage pop up. It's not terribly distracting, but it is noticeable.Supremacy, on the other hand, is a major step up. With the changing of director in Paul Greengrass, he gave the image a much more vibrant look that better accentuates all of the aforementioned qualities. Blacks are darker, colors are much more vivid, contrast is better-balanced, and the sharpness is even sharper. Just looking at the beginning scenes in Goa, there's a tremendous amount of color that really adds more life, and the rest of the movie follows accordingly. Some people say the saturation is a little too high, but I'm in the belief that it was intentional since Grengrass is such a visualist. And there's also a good amount of film grain as well, which again, I believe is intentional. So unless you don't like the color timing or are a grain-hater, then those are about the only problems you might have. Finally, Ultimatum has the same kind of photography, only with a difference of intensity. Supremacy ran a little hot in terms of color, but I feel it added to the overall tone of the film itself (Bourne getting hot and angry for revenge, hence the hot look to the picture). However, Ultimatum is essentially where things come full circle and the adventure ends. Because of that, this is probably about as ""normal"" of a color level as you'll get. So there you have it. Aside from the first movie, there's not much else to complain about.Audio - 5.0Languages- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1- French: DTS 5.1- Spanish: DTS 5.1Subtitles- English SDH, French, SpanishAgain, aside from Identity, the audio is just about perfect. All three movies use the DTS-HD MA codec, and all of them sound fantastic. The only problem with Identity isn't so much the quality, but the quantity. As in the film itself just isn't as heavily-mixed as the others. In his commentary, Doug Liman stressed how he wanted to make Identity a drama first and an action movie second. Because of this, I think it reflects in the sound mix. The actual depth and quality to the track itself is pretty buoyant in terms of separation and directionality and gets especially aggressive during the fight with the first Treadstone agent. Rear speaker activity also gets a really good workout during the car chase sequence when cars start turning the corners. And dynamic range is excellent in the scene where Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character outside the farmhouse.Additionally, when Greengrass takes over as director for the sequels, the audio gets a tremendous upgrade, just as the video did. Even for as low-key as the opening scenes are in Supremacy, the dynamic depth alone is noticeably louder and more precise. Action sequences offer up even more aggressive mixing such as the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. This scene in particular displays a very exact design that has no music and does a great job isolating its sound effects into the confines of that small, compact area, adding an extra layer of ferocity and tension to it. And the car chase in Moscow towards the end is brimming with activity as the vehicles skid, crash, and break all over the place. But even still, Ultimatum manages to top that. Immersion is outstanding from the crowd noise for the scene at Waterloo Station, isolation is more intense in the fight between Bourne and Desh, and the car chase in New York is a sonic masterpiece of mayhem and music. By the way, John Powell's score is another big factor to the overall sound of these films. His string and percussion works really help to compliment the storytelling that even exudes a subtle amount of LFEs through his awesome drum pieces. Outside from the one minor issue with Identity, all of these films sound superb.Extras - 4.0There are quite a bit of extras, but if I were to highlight just one feature from each movie, I'd say at the very least(!) give the audio commentaries a listen. And if you like technical stuff, the U-Control Picture in Picture for Supremacy is well-worth a watch as well.The Bourne Identity:- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)- Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)- Moby ""Extreme Ways"" Music Video (SD; 3:38)- U-ControlThe Bourne Supremacy:- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)- Blowing Things Up (SD; 4:00)- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)- Anatomy of a Scene: The Explosive Bridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)- U-ControlThe Bourne Ultimatum:- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)- Deleted Scenes (SD; 12:22)- Be Bourne Spy Training- Man on the Move: Jason Bourne (SD; 23:58 altogether)- Roof Pursuit (SD; 5:39)- Planning the Punches (SD; 4:59)- Driving School (SD; 3:23)- New York Chase (SD; 10:46)- U-ControlOverall - 5.0So there you have it. If you've read my individual reviews for these movies, there's not much else I can say. The Bourne Trilogy is one of the best in its genre, and I'm really thankful for its influence in a lot of other recent entries (the Daniel Craig Bond movies and Liam Neeson's roles in both Taken and Unknown). It refreshed the genre with a mix of mystery, grit, and emotional depth that has really raised the standard. This box set is a very good deal, and I'm glad I made that blind-buy when I did.
