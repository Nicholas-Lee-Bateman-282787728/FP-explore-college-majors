1646914,A3MDA891A1EPT8,B00CHMBQCU,"Chris Winchester ""mikeystoyz""","[6, 7]","Just finished watching this and I was pretty happy.  This is a solid zombie movie.  I saw it as a zombie comedy and it does pretty well at keeping on task.  It is a story about a bunch of kids that get sent to detention right before a zombie outbreak and shows how the try to survive.  There are of course the typical people there - The jock, nerd, cheerleader, goth chick, skater dude and military guy.  They follow all of the zombie rules and try to survive.  There are a bunch of in jokes in the thing so if you are into the zombie thing you should be able to catch them.  The acting is decent.  You begin to follow the characters and while there isn't enough time to really care about them you do like them.  There is very little cgi and most of the zombie effects are good old fashion makeup.  The effects all around are decent and are good enough to suspend your disbelief for the time you watch it.  There are of course some places where the makeup is obvious but they are few and far between.  The soundtrack is where this movie shines.  It is really good and goes great with the film.  It is actually good enough that I might have to buy it.  This movie is good, it isnt great but it is good.  You could do a lot worse then sit down and watch this.  It is definitely a renter and if you are hardcore it is a keeper.",4,Solid addition to the zombie collection,1369785600,"05 29, 2013",2013,1324,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'was', 'pretty', 'happy', 'solid', 'zombie', 'movie', 'saw', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'pretty', 'well', 'keeping', 'task', 'story', 'bunch', 'kids', 'get', 'sent', 'detention', 'right', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'how', 'try', 'survive', 'are', 'course', 'typical', 'people', 'jock', 'nerd', 'cheerleader', 'chick', 'skater', 'dude', 'military', 'guy', 'follow', 'zombie', 'rules', 'try', 'survive', 'are', 'bunch', 'jokes', 'thing', 'so', 'are', 'zombie', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'catch', 'acting', 'decent', 'begin', 'follow', 'characters', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'really', 'care', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'cgi', 'most', 'zombie', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'makeup', 'effects', 'around', 'are', 'decent', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'time', 'watch', 'are', 'course', 'places', 'where', 'makeup', 'obvious', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'soundtrack', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'good', 'great', 'film', 'actually', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'buy', 'movie', 'good', 'great', 'good', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'then', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'definitely', 'renter', 'are', 'hardcore', 'keeper']",Detention Of The Dead

1646916,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00CHMBQCU,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 1]","Do you remember all the typical garbage you had to deal with in high school? You had to wear the right clothes, hang out with the right crowd, and get all your homework done so you could pass. All those seem hard enough to handle. Now add to your laundry list of things to do ""Escape from my fellow students who have turned into zombies."" High School was bad enough before. Imagine having to attend ""Detention of the Dead.""A nerd, a jock, a cheerleader, a bully, a goth, and a stoner are stuck together in detention. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? It's just a typical afternoon in high school until ravenous zombies overtake the hallways. Now the motley crew of teens must put aside their differences in order to survive a terrifying night of the walking dead.""Detention of the Dead"" is exactly what it looks and sounds like. It's ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" blended together. It's impressive how well Director/Co-Writer Alex Craig Mann takes a zombie apocalypse and uses it for the backdrop of a film about six high schoolers from different walks of life. Not only are they struggling to fight the stereotypes, but now they have to save themselves from being devoured by masses of teenage walking dead.There are several ways ""Detention of the Dead"" pays homage to ""The Breakfast Club."" Each of the characters here are basically updates of the ones in John Hughes' legendary film. At one point, the kids climb through the air ducts, just like Judd Nelson's character did in the classic 1980's film. No matter how tough Nelson's character was, he would have freaked out and ran in the other direction if he came face-to-face with these flesh-eaters.It's nice to see a movie where practical effects take front and center. Every scene of zombie carnage uses real props, giving the film a classic flavor sorely missing these days. The makeup for the living dead is good for the most part, with only a few missteps here and there when it comes to detail. This minor fault can be overlooked if you take into account how many people had to have makeup applied. Add to that the fact this is a low-budget flick shot in a small time frame.The cast of ""Detention of the Dead"" is an impressive mix of television and movie stars. Christa B. Allen of ""Revenge"" plays the cheerleader. ""Greek's"" Jacob Zachar portrays the nerd. Alexa Nikolas of ""Zoey 101"" and ""The Walking Dead"" takes on the role of the goth girl. Jayson Blair from ""The Hard Times of RJ Berger"" and ""The New Normal"" is the bully. ""The Twilight Saga's"" Justin Chon plays the stoner. Max Adler of ""Glee"" portrays the jock.""Detention of the Dead"" is unrated, but if put before the MPAA would be given an R. There's plenty of gore and bloody violence to satisfy bloodhounds. The language is what you would expect from a movie set in a high school. There's no nudity, but plenty of adult situations and sexual humor.The special features for ""Detention of the Dead"" will satisfy consumers. There's a 42-minute Behind The Scenes feature which includes interviews with the cast and crew as well as plenty of footage from the making of the movie. Audio commentary is provided by Executive Producer/Writer/Director Alex Craig Mann.Zombie films are a dime a dozen these days, and they're all preaching some type of serious social commentary. ""Detention of the Dead"" rises above the multitudes of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Walking Dead"" impersonators by injecting a dose of comedy and relatable characters to the recipe. Everybody went to high school and they all fell into one of the social circles represented in the movie. The only difference here is that viewers probably didn't have run-ins with zombies stumbling through the hallways. Okay, I'm not counting the potheads or druggies shuffling by as you ran to class before the tardy bell rings.",4,"""Detention of the Dead"" Mashes Together ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Breakfast Club""",1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,3822,"['Do', 'remember', 'typical', 'garbage', 'had', 'deal', 'high', 'school', 'had', 'wear', 'right', 'clothes', 'hang', 'out', 'right', 'crowd', 'get', 'homework', 'done', 'so', 'could', 'pass', 'seem', 'hard', 'enough', 'handle', 'Now', 'add', 'laundry', 'list', 'things', 'do', 'Escape', 'fellow', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'turned', 'zombies', 'High', 'School', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'Imagine', 'having', 'attend', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'nerd', 'jock', 'cheerleader', 'bully', 'goth', 'stoner', 'are', 'stuck', 'together', 'detention', 'familiar', ""n't"", 'just', 'typical', 'afternoon', 'high', 'school', 'ravenous', 'zombies', 'overtake', 'hallways', 'Now', 'motley', 'crew', 'teens', 'must', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'order', 'survive', 'terrifying', 'night', 'walking', 'dead', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'exactly', 'what', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'blended', 'together', 'impressive', 'how', 'well', 'Director/Co-Writer', 'Alex', 'Craig', 'Mann', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'backdrop', 'film', 'six', 'high', 'schoolers', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'struggling', 'fight', 'stereotypes', 'now', 'have', 'save', 'being', 'devoured', 'masses', 'teenage', 'walking', 'dead.There', 'are', 'several', 'ways', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'homage', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'basically', 'updates', 'ones', 'John', 'Hughes', 'legendary', 'film', 'one', 'point', 'kids', 'climb', 'air', 'just', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'character', 'did', 'classic', '1980', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'tough', 'Nelson', 'character', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'freaked', 'out', 'ran', 'other', 'direction', 'came', 'face-to-face', 'flesh-eaters.It', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'practical', 'effects', 'take', 'front', 'center', 'scene', 'zombie', 'carnage', 'real', 'props', 'giving', 'film', 'classic', 'flavor', 'sorely', 'missing', 'days', 'makeup', 'living', 'dead', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'few', 'missteps', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'detail', 'minor', 'fault', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'take', 'account', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'have', 'makeup', 'applied', 'Add', 'fact', 'low-budget', 'flick', 'shot', 'small', 'time', 'frame.The', 'cast', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'impressive', 'mix', 'television', 'movie', 'stars', 'Christa', 'B.', 'Allen', 'Revenge', 'cheerleader', 'Greek', 'Jacob', 'Zachar', 'nerd', 'Alexa', 'Nikolas', 'Zoey', '101', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'role', 'goth', 'girl', 'Jayson', 'Blair', 'Hard', 'Times', 'RJ', 'Berger', 'New', 'Normal', 'bully', 'Twilight', 'Saga', 'Justin', 'Chon', 'stoner', 'Max', 'Adler', 'Glee', 'jock', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'unrated', 'put', 'MPAA', 'would', 'be', 'given', 'R.', 'plenty', 'gore', 'bloody', 'violence', 'satisfy', 'bloodhounds', 'language', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'movie', 'set', 'high', 'school', 'nudity', 'plenty', 'adult', 'situations', 'sexual', 'humor.The', 'special', 'features', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'will', 'satisfy', 'consumers', '42-minute', 'Scenes', 'feature', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'as', 'well', 'plenty', 'footage', 'making', 'movie', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Executive', 'Producer/Writer/Director', 'Alex', 'Craig', 'Mann.Zombie', 'films', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'days', ""'re"", 'preaching', 'type', 'serious', 'social', 'commentary', 'Detention', 'Dead', 'multitudes', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'impersonators', 'injecting', 'dose', 'comedy', 'relatable', 'characters', 'recipe', 'Everybody', 'went', 'high', 'school', 'fell', 'one', 'social', 'circles', 'represented', 'movie', 'only', 'difference', 'here', 'viewers', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'run-ins', 'zombies', 'stumbling', 'hallways', 'Okay', ""'m"", 'not', 'counting', 'potheads', 'druggies', 'shuffling', 'ran', 'class', 'tardy', 'bell', 'rings']",Detention Of The Dead
1646917,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00CHMBQCU,Joe Smart,"[0, 1]","Attempt to cross the zombie genre with a John Hughes film is painfully unfunny--plus this territory was already covered by the similarly titled but far superior Dance of the Dead.  The actors are likable enough and most will likely be familiar to television viewers, although you might need to consult the IMDB to check where you've seen that face before.  Alexa Nikolas who plays a cutie-pie goth girl is easily the standout.  Everyone in the movie seems to be having a good time, including many of the actors playing zombies, but that seems kind of inappropriate since people's lives are supposed to be at stake.  But the biggest problem with Detention of the Dead is that it's probably the least funny zombie comedy ever made--and considering how many zombie comedies there are that's really saying something.

1646918,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,B00CHMBQCU,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","This fairly low-budget film was produced and distributed with the help of Starz and Anchor Bay.  All of the lead actors (4 male, 2 female) seem mostly to have appeared on TV until now (the rest of the cast are all undead extras).  On the Internet Movie Database this is rated 4.5 out of 10, and trending downward :-(  If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10,  I guess I'd rate it...&#34;I want 30 of those 87 minutes back!.&#34;  Yes it's intentionally an homage both to &#34;Breakfast Club&#34; and George Romero's movies at the least.  [What do you get when you cross them?  Breakfast?]  Although the DVD is not rated, I don't think it would rate an &#34;R&#34;; perhaps NR-17 at worst.  The brief magazine nudity is so brief and low-profile you'd have to freeze-frame the playback to get much of a look, and as for the characters, there is nothing beyond some kissing, bare lower thighs, brief squeezes, discussion about sex and periodic swearwords.  In short, the movie is probably tamer than going to high school.  Except for the zombies.  There's nothing really new about the zombies, nor does the movie make an effort to actually scare the audience; it seems closer to Breakfast Club than to Night of the Living Dead.  Apart from some clever staging that I overlooked (like all the pencils stuck in the ceiling by bored students) the most interesting part of the film for me was the incipient love stories: relationships possibly in the process of breakup; relationships fantasized; relationships possibly just beginning, and whether (or which) students do or do not transcend the boundaries of their stereotypes and work together, when there's nobody else they can turn to (except for breakfast).  The movie leaves room for a sequel though it's not clear yet whether it will earn enough profit to generate one.  Oh and for the guys (the bulk of the audience for this kind of movie) I have to admit Christa Allen is easy on the eyes (one could only wish the movie had made it into &#34;R&#34; territory and/or a stronger love scene) and I'm sure Alexa Nikolas also could look far hotter without the semi-Goth makeup and clothing...",3,If you don't like what you see...Lower Your Expectations!,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,2140,"['fairly', 'low-budget', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'distributed', 'help', 'Starz', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'lead', 'actors', '4', 'male', '2', 'female', 'seem', 'mostly', 'have', 'appeared', 'TV', 'now', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'undead', 'extras', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'rated', '4.5', '10', 'trending', 'downward', 'had', 'rate', 'scale', '1', '10', 'guess', ""'d"", 'rate', '34', 'want', '30', '87', 'minutes', 'back', '34', 'intentionally', 'homage', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Club', '34', 'George', 'Romero', 'movies', 'least', '[', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'cross', 'Breakfast', 'DVD', 'not', 'rated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'rate', '34', 'R', '34', 'perhaps', 'NR-17', 'worst', 'brief', 'magazine', 'nudity', 'so', 'brief', 'low-profile', ""'d"", 'have', 'freeze-frame', 'playback', 'get', 'much', 'look', 'characters', 'nothing', 'kissing', 'bare', 'lower', 'thighs', 'brief', 'squeezes', 'discussion', 'sex', 'periodic', 'swearwords', 'short', 'movie', 'probably', 'tamer', 'going', 'high', 'school', 'zombies', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'zombies', 'movie', 'make', 'effort', 'actually', 'scare', 'audience', 'closer', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Apart', 'clever', 'staging', 'overlooked', 'pencils', 'stuck', 'ceiling', 'bored', 'students', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'incipient', 'love', 'stories', 'relationships', 'possibly', 'process', 'breakup', 'relationships', 'fantasized', 'relationships', 'possibly', 'just', 'beginning', 'students', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'transcend', 'boundaries', 'stereotypes', 'work', 'together', 'when', 'nobody', 'else', 'can', 'turn', 'breakfast', 'movie', 'room', 'sequel', 'not', 'clear', 'yet', 'will', 'earn', 'enough', 'profit', 'generate', 'one', 'Oh', 'guys', 'bulk', 'audience', 'kind', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'Christa', 'Allen', 'easy', 'eyes', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'wish', 'movie', 'had', 'made', '34', 'R', '34', 'territory', 'stronger', 'love', 'scene', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Alexa', 'Nikolas', 'also', 'could', 'look', 'far', 'hotter', 'semi-Goth', 'makeup', 'clothing']",Detention Of The Dead

1646920,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00CHMBQCU,Matthew Scott Baker,"[0, 0]","*I received a screener copy of this film for review; I am in no way compensated for my reviews.Growing up, one of my favorite non-horror 80s movies was THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  Like many others of my generation, even back then I recognized the high school caste system that was in place and the ridiculousness of it; John Hughes simply brought this out in the open, for the less-knowing masses to see.  Anchor Bay's latest release DETENTION OF THE DEAD takes this high school hierarchy a step further and brings zombies into the mix.  The result is a hilarious horror romp that entertains on several levels.I am impressed with this film for several reasons.  This could have been a disaster, given the somewhat cheesy premise, but director Alex Craig Mann makes sure the movie never takes itself too seriously and keeps the action flowing at a nice pace.  The film looks great, the actors are top notch, and the production value appears high overall.  In short, this is a damn good zombie flick.One major reason for DETENTION OF THE DEAD's success is the acting.  Each actor skillfully portrays their stereotyped character with great ease.  From the arrogant, bullying jock, to the self-centered cheerleader, to the dorky, big-hearted geek...every level of high school society is represented here in a monumental way.Another reason is the special effects.  The zombies look great and the gore is fantastic.  I am particularly impressed with the carnage, as I don't believe any good living dead flick should be without some gore.  And the production team doesn't spare much expense.  There's even a horrific zombie rat!!DETENTION OF THE DEAD is a major win for me and I think every zombie fan should check it out.  It is a film that knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be anything but funny and horrifying.  If you like SHAUN OF THE DEAD, I will wager you will like this one.

1646921,A2DKARU8OOUDJV,B00CHMBQCU,"M. Bartel ""FAIZ""","[0, 0]","Being an older fan of both Zombie movies and John Hughes films, i was fairly pleased with this film.  Though i was not instantly drawn in the first few minutes, by the time the teens got to the library the movie really starts kicking in and flowing.  So, if anything i felt the beginning was a tad rough... maybe due to my age, it is after all a modern take on John Hughes' Breakfast Club so musically and style-wise the beginning may suit today's younger audience.I am not saying the beginning sucked, just that it took a bit for me to be drawn to the characters and if anything may have been the one thing this ""did not"" have in common with John Hughes style films since it seemed that all of his movies had my attention even during his strong beginning credits and character set-up.It is a nice blend of Romero and Hughes and certainly deserves a place in any zombie movie collection, there is plenty of zombie knowledge behind it and certainly nods to John Hughes even beyond the obvious Breakfast Club detention concept... it more blends Breakfast Club and bits of Some Kind of Wonderful.This film is certainly very good, it may not have as much comedy or gore that some may want in a horror or comedy but with the direction they took with the film it certainly is understandable as it would have killed the John Hughes vibe.  If i could give this 4.5 stars i would, but this being Zombie Horror Comedy Coming of Age John Hughes Style film - it may not please everyone, but it does a very good job at trying to achieve so much in one little film and deliver some gut munching, solid funny moments, some drama and even some ""warm-n-fuzzy"" moments.",4,Solid Zombie Movie worth checking,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1651,"['Being', 'older', 'fan', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'John', 'Hughes', 'films', 'i', 'was', 'fairly', 'pleased', 'film', 'i', 'was', 'not', 'instantly', 'drawn', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'time', 'teens', 'got', 'library', 'movie', 'really', 'kicking', 'flowing', 'So', 'anything', 'i', 'felt', 'beginning', 'was', 'tad', 'rough', 'maybe', 'due', 'age', 'modern', 'take', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'so', 'musically', 'style-wise', 'beginning', 'may', 'suit', 'today', 'younger', 'audience.I', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'beginning', 'sucked', 'just', 'took', 'bit', 'be', 'drawn', 'characters', 'anything', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'common', 'John', 'Hughes', 'style', 'films', 'seemed', 'movies', 'had', 'attention', 'even', 'strong', 'beginning', 'credits', 'character', 'set-up.It', 'nice', 'blend', 'Romero', 'Hughes', 'certainly', 'place', 'zombie', 'movie', 'collection', 'plenty', 'zombie', 'knowledge', 'certainly', 'nods', 'John', 'Hughes', 'even', 'obvious', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'detention', 'concept', 'more', 'blends', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'bits', 'Kind', 'Wonderful.This', 'film', 'certainly', 'very', 'good', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'gore', 'may', 'want', 'horror', 'comedy', 'direction', 'took', 'film', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'would', 'have', 'killed', 'John', 'Hughes', 'vibe', 'i', 'could', 'give', '4.5', 'stars', 'i', 'would', 'being', 'Zombie', 'Horror', 'Comedy', 'Coming', 'Age', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Style', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'please', 'everyone', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'trying', 'achieve', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'little', 'film', 'deliver', 'gut', 'munching', 'solid', 'funny', 'moments', 'drama', 'even', 'warm-n-fuzzy', 'moments']",Detention Of The Dead

It has a bunch of stereotypical high schoolers trapped in a high school and surrounded by zombies.  The effects are ok, the zombies can run ,but mostly they just act like a zombie would . slow and plodding.  The stereotypes in this movie do in fact exist even to this day though.  The stoner is as worthless as you would expect and selfish too.  The jock is a idiot, not all jocks are that way. but who cares. This is a very low budget film and at least the actors weren't as bad as some low budgeters seem to be. The effects are decent in a  very low budget way too. This however is not a c- movie those are so badly made that  you know a group of friends made it.  This seems to have professional production values. Is it a good movie? well if you like zomedies. then you may like this one. This however is not near as good as 'dance of the dead' another high school zombie flick.

So it's on for a battle of survival and finding places to hide as the halls become infested with the walking dead wanting to devour the living. Wait, I just said that... then re-worded it... I guess that's it, you've seen this plot before. But how does this movie come off in the end?It's ok, not really worth a second viewing. The leading man is a dork, he has a crush on the cheerleader bimbo, of coarse her jock boyfriend has to tag along, and then there is the stoner, another jock and a cute goth girl. Overall, the film has a bit of blood and gore, and can be humerus at times, but what it needed was either go all out with the blood and make it funny because it is so gory, or have more jokes and make it funnier. It mostly just sits in limbo, and is expected to be passed off as a bloody comedy, but it almost tries to take itself too seriously in some parts, or they just forgot to comb down the drama and play it less straight faced.It's a fun movie, worthy of seeing once, it's not one you will want to turn off because it's so lame, least I don't think so.

The plot is very basic: a group of oddball high school stereotypes - the nerd, the cheerleader, the jock, the stoner, the goth girl, the big stupid bully - all find themselves trapped in their high school when, while they're all stuck in detention late one afternoon, a zombie attack turns their classmates and teachers who were left behind into the brain-eating living dead.  The film basically concerns itself with how they will get out/survive, and definitely has its moments of both being funny and some decent zombie/gore scenes for sure ...But whereas 'The Breakfast Club' achieved its brilliance by allowing us to see beyond the stereotypes - to truly end up caring about the characters - 'Detention of the Dead' has characters that never stray from their labels (even the goth girl showing her vulnerable side, in the end, has become stereotypical), therefore making it hard to give that much of a hang about what happens to them (with one exception, and he was one of the biggest reasons I wanted to see the film: Justin Chon, who seems to be having a ball here as the Asian stoner who has more than a little fun with a zombie teachers head, after cutting it off).  The zombie action is cool, the actors (including Christa B. Allen from ""Revenge"", playing the vain blonde head cheerleader) make the most of their material ... but if you want a truly great, truly bloody but also damned funny teen/high school zombie movie, the brilliant 'Dance of the Dead' provides both more thrills and more laughs.

O'Sullivan,"[0, 0]","I think the first thing you need to know about going into DETENTION OF THE DEAD is that it is based on a play - this I did not know when I watched it (although the pacing, settings and dialogue heavy scenes are a major clue) and upon learning of this fact at the end of the film it helped me to understand why pretty much nothing happens in this movie expect for long, drawn out conversations about teen identity, popularity, bullying, the student teacher relationship gap (rules vs. doing as you please) and how we truly don't understand (or trust each other) much outside the roles we often play in high school...in short, it's pretty much THE BREAKFAST CLUB (even down to the library confession scene which sits heavily in the center of the film slowing...everything...down...).I enjoyed the set up and the idea behind it - but, little else.  The actors are fixed in their roles based on their wardrobe and despite the actions they take, very little of them make any real changes as the film progresses (outside the stock character change all high school films are supposed to make - jock to coward, cheerleader to cheerless, nerd to hero, Goth to girl next door, drug pusher to guru) but they work very hard over extended blocks of dialogue to make you think progress is happening...but it's not.The zombie outbreak is quick and mainly kept off screen save for a few key scenes and even then they are clearly ""stage zombies"" - slow moving, background hanging zombies that don't do much but fill the scene.  The zombies play no part outside keeping out cast locked inside rooms to talk...and talk...and talk...or try to whenever the soundtrack does not talk over them.  The songs were so bland and so brain dead I had to turn on the subtitles to see the lyrics for myself - terrible - but oddly amusing how earnest they were, imagine a lovesick eight year old in love with his gym teacher and you get the idea.Overall what could have been a solid take on high school, enemies and the undead could have had some real bite (pun), but, in the end it's too much in its own head and dead to its own words - the film is all tone, one long unbroken hum of mediocre.",2,MY KINGDOM FOR A CHARLEY HORSE,1402272000,"06 9, 2014",2014,2161,"['think', 'first', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'going', 'DETENTION', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'based', 'play', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'watched', 'pacing', 'settings', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'scenes', 'are', 'major', 'clue', 'learning', 'fact', 'end', 'film', 'helped', 'understand', 'why', 'pretty', 'much', 'nothing', 'movie', 'expect', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'conversations', 'teen', 'identity', 'popularity', 'bullying', 'student', 'teacher', 'relationship', 'gap', 'rules', 'vs.', 'doing', 'please', 'how', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'trust', 'other', 'much', 'roles', 'often', 'play', 'high', 'school', 'short', 'pretty', 'much', 'THE', 'BREAKFAST', 'CLUB', 'even', 'down', 'library', 'confession', 'scene', 'heavily', 'center', 'film', 'slowing', 'everything', 'down', '.I', 'enjoyed', 'set', 'up', 'idea', 'little', 'else', 'actors', 'are', 'fixed', 'roles', 'based', 'wardrobe', 'actions', 'take', 'very', 'little', 'make', 'real', 'changes', 'film', 'stock', 'character', 'change', 'high', 'school', 'films', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'jock', 'coward', 'cheerleader', 'cheerless', 'nerd', 'hero', 'Goth', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'drug', 'pusher', 'guru', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'extended', 'blocks', 'dialogue', 'make', 'think', 'progress', 'happening', 'not.The', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'quick', 'mainly', 'kept', 'off', 'screen', 'save', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'clearly', 'stage', 'zombies', 'slow', 'moving', 'hanging', 'zombies', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'fill', 'scene', 'zombies', 'play', 'part', 'keeping', 'out', 'cast', 'locked', 'inside', 'rooms', 'talk', 'talk', 'talk', 'try', 'whenever', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'talk', 'songs', 'were', 'so', 'bland', 'so', 'brain', 'dead', 'had', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'see', 'lyrics', 'terrible', 'oddly', 'amusing', 'how', 'earnest', 'were', 'imagine', 'lovesick', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'love', 'gym', 'teacher', 'get', 'idea.Overall', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'solid', 'take', 'high', 'school', 'enemies', 'undead', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'real', 'bite', 'pun', 'end', 'too', 'much', 'own', 'head', 'dead', 'own', 'words', 'film', 'tone', 'one', 'long', 'unbroken', 'hum', 'mediocre']",Detention Of The Dead
