In the book, there's two distinct personalities : Janie as she's growing and Janie as Narrator.  It's the sheer presence of the narrator in the book that makes it.  It's Janie looking back at her life and explaining the inner dialogue and why she did what she did, and what she learned from it.  That's distinctly missing from the movie.  They tried to blend the two and take out the narration for the majority of the story, and that was the mistake.It's.... okay.  It's not great.  If you haven't read the book, you'll probably like the movie.  If you've read the book, well, you'll see what I mean.

927339,A2DY7QNWMO7D25,B000AJJNMM,Beverly,"[11, 14]","Oprah is responsible for the filming of this classic and it is a triumph indeed. It is based on the book Their Eyes Were Watching God by Harlem Renaissance novelist, Zora Neale Hurston.  The reknown Miss Hurston drew colorful depictions of of her community. She used colorful characterizations that illuminated the spitit of the black America.Halle Berry plays heroine, ""Janie"", who is African American but actually looks white. Janie Crawford is raised by a strict grandmother she calls ""Nanny."" Nanny is determined to stamp out Janie's fire by marrying her off early. In my opinion, Berry shines in this role and pulls off Janie's sex appeal and beauty  as described in Hurston's book.Janie's marriage to the elderly first husband ends when she leaves him and walks off with husband number 2, Joe Starks, who promised to ""show her the world."" Hurston's descriptions of Janie's meticulous second husband is worth noting. We peer into their disagreements about how Janie should appear before the public as the mayor's wife and listen in on the gossip that follows as the townspeople marvel at her transformation into a lady.Hurston's great dialogue captures the ongoing gossip of the townspeople who are quick to notice when things turn sour in Janie's house-hold. They wonder what she will do with herself when her husband dies, leaving her all his money.You will champion Janie's strong will to be who she wanted to be and cheer her on as she sheds her mourning clothes and trades them in for pretty dresses, letting her proverbial hair down again!When a gorgeous drifter by the name of Tea Cake comes to town, you sense what Janie will do once he catches her eye! Janie leaves her home, her business and memories of two stiffling marriages behind to run off with Tea Cake, played brilliantly by Michael Ealy. He and Halle definitely have chemistry on screen!Of course he can't support Janie so they live off of her money until it runs out. She feels that Tea Cake's love ""gave her the world everyday."" Things take a turn for the worse when they both get caught in a hurricane and Tea Cake gets bitten by a rabid dog. Janie ends up putting him out of his misery and goes back home to relive her memories, never regretting the decision to live the way she wanted during her brief time with her man.Rent this DVD and experience Janie's joie de vie in the sensual Juke joints dancing and laughing it up.

When Halle Berry was announced as 'Best Lead Actress' I almost leaped off the couch in pure satisfaction only to turn off the television in a rage after Russell Crowe lost his MUCH DESERVED Oscar to Denzell.  Since then my love for Berry's win has been tarnished by what the media turned her win into (claiming it all up to the Academy's embrace of African American actors instead of calling it what it was...really freaking good acting), and then again, after watching her tragic portrayal time and time again, while I would have went a different route (Naomi Watts who was unjustly snubbed) I am still very happy for her.  That said...she bores me here.I'm also, as all my friends know, a huge fan of Oprah, as is my wife, and so when she announced that she would be producing this film with Halle in the lead I thought ""this is gonna be good"".  The story, adapted from Zora Neale Hurston's 1937 novel, follows Janie Crawford (Berry) as she suffers through failed marriage after failed marriage in the south only to fall in love with a younger man and end up in a doomed relationship.  Yes, the ending is heartbreaking, but getting there takes a lot of patience.  The rest of this cast is dull as well, Michael Ealy who plays Janie's younger man being the only one in the cast who struck me.  I'm sorry but I just don't get the whole Terrance Howard thing...to me he's just really annoying.The film has its good points but they are few and far in between.  Berry just isn't her usual impressive self, nothing close to her brilliance in 'Monster's Ball'.  I was just left wanting, knowing that this could have and should have been so much better.

927349,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000AJJNMM,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[17, 19]","THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD, is a remarkable story based on the best-selling book by Zora Neale Hurston. Halle Berry stars as the beautiful Janie Crawford, who embarks on an emotional and dramatic journey of self-discovery.Set in Florida in the 1930's, Janie struggles to satisfy first her grandmother, and then the men in her life. As a half-black, half-white woman, Janie's life was one of new rules and boundaries, new borders and bridges. She is half black and therefore destined to live the life of a black, but she was also half white and she deserved the life of a white. But neither appealed to Janie Her sense of freedom and adventure shaped who she was and who she would become. Throughout this book Janie never gave up her search for love and happiness. And throughout her three marriages she gained a lot of positive experiences.Her first marriage was to a man named Logan Killicks, and she gained many positive experiences from that marriage. She learned the valuable lesson ""that marriage did not make love. Shortly after that she left Logan. She then married a man named Joe ""Jody"" Starks and she learned a lot from that marriage as well. She learned, for example, that money doesn't equal happiness. Also in that marriage Janie learned to ""talk some and leave some."" Some things were important enough to fight with Jodie over and some, well most, weren't. He always won the fights so only the most unique matters could or would be quarreled over. Her third marriage was to Teacake, and she learned a lot of positive things from that marriage too. What she learned was the greatest lesson of them all. She learned Love. How to give it, how to receive it and how to express it. She loved him so much that ""her soul crawled out from its hiding place,""  and she was able to begin her dreams once more. She learned how to express her feelings without fear of what would follow them. All of the good, bad, and worse in Janie's life were worth something because she learned from it. She became who she was because of it. Without the hurt and the pain and the heartbreak, she would not have been strong, and had she not been strong, she would have died along side Teacake. But she didn't, she lived on, and though it is not seen that she loved again it was not shown that she didn't keep learning.This movie has touched me all around and I am happy that I had purchased this DVD. This is a timeless story of passion, romance, and the spirit of love I highly recommend this film.",4,"THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD, is one remarkable story",1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,2487,"['EYES', 'WATCHING', 'GOD', 'remarkable', 'story', 'based', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Zora', 'Neale', 'Hurston', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'beautiful', 'Janie', 'Crawford', 'who', 'emotional', 'dramatic', 'journey', 'self-discovery.Set', 'Florida', '1930', 'Janie', 'satisfy', 'first', 'grandmother', 'then', 'men', 'life', 'half-black', 'half-white', 'woman', 'Janie', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'new', 'rules', 'boundaries', 'new', 'borders', 'bridges', 'half', 'black', 'therefore', 'destined', 'live', 'life', 'black', 'was', 'also', 'half', 'white', 'deserved', 'life', 'white', 'appealed', 'Janie', 'Her', 'sense', 'freedom', 'adventure', 'shaped', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'would', 'become', 'book', 'Janie', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'search', 'love', 'happiness', 'three', 'marriages', 'gained', 'lot', 'positive', 'experiences.Her', 'first', 'marriage', 'was', 'man', 'named', 'Logan', 'Killicks', 'gained', 'many', 'positive', 'experiences', 'marriage', 'learned', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'marriage', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'love', 'Shortly', 'left', 'Logan', 'then', 'married', 'man', 'named', 'Joe', 'Jody', 'Starks', 'learned', 'lot', 'marriage', 'as', 'well', 'learned', 'example', 'money', ""n't"", 'equal', 'happiness', 'Also', 'marriage', 'Janie', 'learned', 'talk', 'leave', 'things', 'were', 'important', 'enough', 'fight', 'Jodie', 'well', 'most', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'won', 'fights', 'only', 'most', 'unique', 'matters', 'could', 'would', 'be', 'quarreled', 'third', 'marriage', 'was', 'Teacake', 'learned', 'lot', 'positive', 'things', 'marriage', 'too', 'What', 'learned', 'was', 'greatest', 'lesson', 'learned', 'Love', 'How', 'give', 'how', 'receive', 'how', 'express', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'soul', 'crawled', 'out', 'hiding', 'place', 'was', 'able', 'begin', 'dreams', 'once', 'more', 'learned', 'how', 'express', 'feelings', 'fear', 'what', 'would', 'follow', 'good', 'bad', 'worse', 'Janie', 'life', 'were', 'worth', 'something', 'learned', 'became', 'who', 'was', 'hurt', 'pain', 'heartbreak', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'strong', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'strong', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'side', 'Teacake', 'did', ""n't"", 'lived', 'not', 'seen', 'loved', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'learning.This', 'movie', 'touched', 'am', 'happy', 'had', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'timeless', 'story', 'passion', 'romance', 'spirit', 'love', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
927350,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B000AJJNMM,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[0, 0]","I watched the DVD after having enjoyed the immersive experience of hearing Ruby Dee read the book in the audio CD series. Coincidentally, Ruby Dee had a small part in the movie as Nanny, Janie's grandmother. Though Halle Berry is too pretty and light-skinned to be completely believable as a black woman of the 1930's, she captures the spirit and strength of Janie in a memorable way.Janie is quickly married off to an older farmer when her grandmother senses that she has come of age and needs to be wed before she gets herself into trouble. Logan, the old farmer with 60 acres, mainly sees her as another farm tool, and she labors alongside him day and night on their farm with little to look forward to except more hard work. Realizing that Logan doesn't really love her, she is swept off her feet by Jody when he promises to build a nearby town and buy her pretty things. But he has ideas about how the mayor's wife should dress and behave, and she chafes at the role he has thrust upon her. Nevertheless, that marriage lasts for 20 years, until he dies and leaves her the general store and a modest amount of money.She seems content to live the single life in her little town until handsome young Teacake woos her; though she is 12 years older than him, he brings out her girlish side and she is able to laugh and have fun for the first time in many years. She is caught up in a consuming and smoldering love affair. She leaves town to find adventure and a new life with Teacake and they end up in ""The Muck"", a community of itinerant laborers near Lake Okeechobee in Florida. She finally feels that she has found her true self and real love.Gradually Janie achieves a strong sense of self and comes to appreciate her independence. But her journey toward enlightenment is not undertaken alone. Janie believes that fulfilling relationships must be reciprocal and based on mutual respect, a far cry from what she achieved in her first 2 marriages.

If the film producer and director spent as much time exploring some of the more interesting aspects of the novel's plot as they did staging flattering camera shots for Halle Berry, I'm sure there would have been a huge improvement in the end result.  Instead, the viewer is cheated.  The movie is reduced to a very one-dimensional love story which involes a very superficial, impetuous protagonist. Zora Neale Hurston's novel is rich in detail and wonderful metaphor use as she masterfully draws a portrait of a mature but naive woman, grappling to understand love and life. While romance is a huge component in Janie's life with Tea Cake, their relationship was far more complex than the movie would lead you to believe it was. The various soft-porn shots of Janie and Tea Cake writhing around do little to advance the storyline and manage to convince the viewer than the attraction between the two was purely physical, which in fact, it was not.Maybe the real problem with this movie is Halle Berry. She is pretty to look at but her ""acting abilities"" really fall short.  The role of Janie is no small undertaking; she is a complicated character and Berry plays most of the scenes in the film as if she is instead posing for one of her Revlon cosmetic commercials.

But after reading some of the reviews and finding out that so many readers didn't like the movie versus the book, I see that I never want to read the book.  I was so content with that movie...and I don't want to let anything damper my satisfaction with it.This movie is about a wonderful story of a curious woman who is on a search to find someone who meets her level physically, mentally, and spiritually.  One man is so old that he does nothing for her physically, mentally, or spiritually. The second man tries to hide her physically behind a statue of servitude and submissiveness.  And the third...*grinning* the third one was a compliment to them all.It was interesting to watch her hang around for the three men's less than perfect ways and see how she handled them all.  Many things she did were things I would not do, probably due to my generation's attitude of leaving when the going gets too tough...but I respected her decisions nonetheless. If you watch the movie for nothing else, just get to the part where Michael Ealy comes into the picture. I understand why Oprah says a woman being kissed like that would die a happy woman...but the kiss she was talking about had nothing on the lemon kiss or the harmonica kiss.  I've never seen a man look so dirty and still be so sexy.  Halle is absolutely gorgeous as well.  One great-looking couple doing a fantastic job in a superb movie.Note: When I rented this movie at Blockbuster, the sales clerk said her husband gets mad at her for watching it all the time.

Now I'm really rolling my eyes because this book didn't have a THING on the movie.  Tea Cake was a liar, a jerk, ridiculously macho, and he hit her...I wasn't feeling that at all.  Even worse, Janie was a complete idiot in the book.  Everything she did had to be approved by a man and she kept telling people she couldn't think well because she wasn't too smart.

927366,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B000AJJNMM,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[21, 33]","The Oprah Winfrey Presents adaptation of the Zora Neale Hurston novel Their Eyes Were Watching God is a major disappointment. Winfrey's shallow adaptation barely skims the surface details of Hurston's novel and does not capture the spirit of the great book it is based on. Winfrey says the late Ms. Hurston would be proud of her movie; I don't think she should be so eager to speak for the dead. I doubt any author would want to see their work butchered the way Winfrey has done this novel onscreen.Oprah Winfrey's adaptation of Hurston's work strips it of its unique identity by removing all the references to African-American culture of the time. Instead of telling a story that detailed the role of Black women in the 30's, detailed the light skinned/dark skinned intraracial issues, sexism, the dozens, symbolism, and utilized the wonderful Southern dialect that made the characters come alive, we get a pasteurized movie that boils away the black culture away like it was an impurity. Without that culture to show us what life was like in Janie's time the movie lacks a true heart and soul. This makes the characters lifeless and one-dimensional. Stripped of her soul, Janie Crawford in this movie becomes a totally different person than depicted in the novel. Because I never got to see the childhood that would have defined the characters' independent free thinking ways, I saw Janie as a slut when she kissed the boy. When Nanny says, ""black women are the mule of the world"" the words have no meaning. Her marriage to the old man comes off as a way to preserve Janie's morality not stifle her independent way of thinking.Because Winfrey decided to remove all instances of domestic violence from her movie Janie has no motivation for leaving her first husband. In the book she left the old man because he beat her. Onscreen she comes off as lazy and irresponsible when she hates doing the work on the farm. When she meets Joe Starks it looked to me like she was a gold-digger wanting to live the high life.When Janie gets married to Joe Starks the movie turns into a bad romance novel. He wants to possess her; she regrets letting him objectify her. He only gets angry when Amos is coveting her. The confrontation Joe and Janie had was supposed to build into a humiliating argument that destroyed him as a man. Onscreen the fight comes on the porch has no bite because Winfrey removed the dozens game and most of the violence from the movie. When Joe dies the film treats his death with a sense of relief. I really started hating this movie because Janie onscreen seemed downright cruel. She barely worked a day in her life and was more anxious to spend her husband's money than grieve his loss.The relationship with Tea Cake in the book is not as loving as depicted onscreen. Winfrey subjectively decided to leave out of her movie all those scenes in the book where Tea Cake beat Janie in an attempt to make him a big hero. After a flat courtship, they leave town to go on the road spending money and engaging in some lukewarm love scenes. Winfrey makes Tea Cakes' abuse of Janie seem like it's honorable. When he steals Janie's money to go gambling it's depicted as noble. Janie just forgives him for gambling away their money and car and they go off to live in a village full of hippies. The climatic hurricane sequence has no feeling of drama at all. The scenes where rabid Tea Cake and Janie face off before killing him have no tension and no suspense. Arbitrarily Oprah leaves out the funeral scene in the novel where Janie grieves the loss of her true love. What's really important are those frames showing that Janie is still wealthy in spite of her tragedies.Upon returning to town in the end Janie shows absolutely no sense of remorse about killing Tea Cake, the great love of her life. She goes fishing and frolicking as if nothing tragic has happened in her life swimming in the lake she says smiling that she's watching God. That final shot of her made my stomach turn. The Janie Crawford in this movie doesn't make me believe she comes to the conclusion that she loves herself. I see her as a loose gold digging ruthless woman who takes no responsibility for her actions. The men in her life were just fodder to give her nice things. Inheriting Joe Starks' wealth made her someone. Nice message Oprah.Oscar winner Halle Berry is uninspired in the role of Janie. She makes no effort on her own to add dimension to the character, sleepwalking through her part reading her lines as if she were on autopilot. She has no chemistry with Reuben Santiago-Hudson or Michael Ealy at all. Having watched all of Berry's performances since 1989, I can truly say this is the worst performance of her career. She actually put more effort performing in the terrible B.A.P.S than working on this movie. Rueben Santiago-Hudson is passable as Joe Starks. He does his best with the role but there's no script here for him to work with. Terrence Howard's portrayal of Amos rises above the heartless screenplay. He adds dimension to his role making you see the sleazy man coveting Janie from afar. Michael Ealy is a very stale Tea Cake. He's just here to be the baby oil splashed boy toy showing off his abs, pecs and smiling for the camera. Ruby Dee is strong in her small part as Nanny. I believe if they gave her more to do she would have stolen the movie.If you haven't read the book, please do so. Avoid watching this twisted movie adaptation that perverts everything the late Ms. Hurston wrote about. The values promoted by this movie totally betray the message in the book.",1,Oprah's adaptation does not capture the spirit of Hurston's novel,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,5579,"['Oprah', 'Winfrey',
