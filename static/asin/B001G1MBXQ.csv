Unfortunetaly he was not his usual goofy self.But to my surprise it was very good and the Hanson Brothers made me laugh again. The romance was very cute. A few cameos were a little cheesy but they aren't actors anyway.  Overall, I thought it was very good and similar to the Mighty Ducks movie.",4,A Surprise,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,428,"['2nd', 'one', 'was', 'awful', 'so', 'imagined', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'worse', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'picking', 'up', 'seeing', 'Leslie', 'Neilson', 'dvd', 'cover', 'was', 'not', 'usual', 'goofy', 'self.But', 'surprise', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Hanson', 'Brothers', 'made', 'laugh', 'again', 'romance', 'was', 'very', 'cute', 'few', 'cameos', 'were', 'little', 'cheesy', 'are', ""n't"", 'actors', 'anyway', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'similar', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'movie']",Slap Shot 3: The Junior League

1193218,A3JA2E81HWE0N3,B001G1MBXQ,Claudette Adler,"[0, 0]","This movie, I also, did not know existed until 2 weeks ago. This one is actually better than Slap Shot 2. Which is weird to say. This one has zilch to do with the original, other than alluding to the original team and name.One of the best parts of the movie is having 2 ex-NHL players in it. Mark Messier may have a really small part, but if you watch the kid clutching his arm in the announcers booth and the see the look on his face it is priceless and worth the $3.75 I paid for this one. The goalie on the opposing team called the Ice Hounds, you know is going to get his spoiled ass kicked and sure enough he does and that is satisfying in itself. Whoever is behind the mask is actually a very talented goalie, and the kid playing the part does a good job of being a total creep who lacks any humbleness of a real hockey player. Oh and the Hanson brothers are back and this time they each have a kid whom they have taught their ways. They do a pretty good job of being bruisers like their dads were. The Ice Hounds, also, recruit players that belong being locked up, just like the original movie and that is about it for resembling a Slap Shot movie. If you can get this for what I paid or less and have 90 minutes to kill this one okay and better than Slap Shot 2. That said nothing is better than the original, of course.",3,Okay,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1328,"['movie', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'existed', '2', 'weeks', 'ago', 'one', 'actually', 'better', 'Slap', 'Shot', '2', 'Which', 'weird', 'say', 'one', 'zilch', 'do', 'original', 'other', 'alluding', 'original', 'team', 'name.One', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'having', '2', 'ex-NHL', 'players', 'Mark', 'Messier', 'may', 'have', 'really', 'small', 'part', 'watch', 'kid', 'clutching', 'arm', 'announcers', 'see', 'look', 'face', 'priceless', '3.75', 'paid', 'one', 'goalie', 'opposing', 'team', 'called', 'Ice', 'Hounds', 'know', 'going', 'get', 'spoiled', 'ass', 'kicked', 'sure', 'enough', 'satisfying', 'Whoever', 'mask', 'actually', 'very', 'talented', 'goalie', 'kid', 'playing', 'part', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'total', 'creep', 'who', 'humbleness', 'real', 'hockey', 'player', 'Oh', 'Hanson', 'brothers', 'are', 'back', 'time', 'have', 'kid', 'whom', 'have', 'taught', 'ways', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'bruisers', 'dads', 'were', 'Ice', 'Hounds', 'also', 'recruit', 'players', 'belong', 'being', 'locked', 'up', 'just', 'original', 'movie', 'resembling', 'Slap', 'Shot', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'paid', 'less', 'have', '90', 'minutes', 'kill', 'one', 'okay', 'better', 'Slap', 'Shot', '2', 'said', 'nothing', 'better', 'original', 'course']",Slap Shot 3: The Junior League

The Hanson Bros. try their best to teach kids about hockey and about life.  Their abilities are tested when one two of the kids on the team are caught putting on the foils...on their things and have an impromptu sword fight in tale of curiosity.Well, the bad boy of the team, sort of like a little 0gie 0gglethorpe catches them and ridicules them.  He is soon traded and blabs about what he saw to the rest of the league as kids would do, thus making the Lil' Chiefs the laughing stock of the league.Well despite the humiliation, the Hansons try to comfort the kids that it's ok to ''explore'' and that what they did was not wrong.  But you know with kids, in one orafice and out the other.Normally this would divide the team, instead it brings them closer together.  The Lil' Chiefs start winning games and go through the playoffs until guess who they have to play in the finals?  You got it.  Lil' 0gie.  They proceed to hit the Chiefs with elbows and insults.  Finally in sudden death overtime, our two little musketeers set up the winning goal, thus good triumphing over evil.This film is nothing to shake a stick at...or a ''sword'' for that matter.",1,En Guard!!!,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,1449,"['lf', 'thought', 'Slap', 'Shot', '2', 'was', 'slap', 'face', 'celluloid', 'legend', 'then', 'Slap', 'Shot', '3', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'shame', 'more', '2', 'minutes.The', 'Charlestown', 'Chiefs', 'now', 'kiddie', 'league', 'three', 'favorite', 'hockey', 'goons', 'are', 'now', 'coaches', 'pubescent', 'Hanson', 'Brother', 'wannabees', 'Hanson', 'Bros.', 'try', 'best', 'teach', 'kids', 'hockey', 'life', 'abilities', 'are', 'tested', 'when', 'one', 'two', 'kids', 'team', 'are', 'caught', 'putting', 'foils', 'things', 'have', 'impromptu', 'sword', 'fight', 'tale', 'curiosity.Well', 'bad', 'boy', 'team', 'sort', 'little', '0gie', '0gglethorpe', 'catches', 'ridicules', 'soon', 'traded', 'blabs', 'what', 'saw', 'rest', 'league', 'kids', 'would', 'do', 'thus', 'making', 'Lil', 'Chiefs', 'laughing', 'stock', 'league.Well', 'humiliation', 'Hansons', 'try', 'comfort', 'kids', 'ok', 'explore', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'not', 'wrong', 'know', 'kids', 'one', 'orafice', 'other.Normally', 'would', 'divide', 'team', 'instead', 'closer', 'together', 'Lil', 'Chiefs', 'start', 'winning', 'games', 'go', 'playoffs', 'guess', 'who', 'have', 'play', 'finals', 'got', 'Lil', '0gie', 'proceed', 'hit', 'Chiefs', 'elbows', 'insults', 'Finally', 'sudden', 'death', 'overtime', 'two', 'little', 'musketeers', 'set', 'up', 'winning', 'goal', 'thus', 'good', 'triumphing', 'evil.This', 'film', 'nothing', 'shake', 'stick', 'sword', 'matter']",Slap Shot 3: The Junior League
