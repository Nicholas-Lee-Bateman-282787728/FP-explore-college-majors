Eventually, we broke down and ordered the VHS.Good call.  While quality of the video was dreadful (gives one an appreciation of how far technology has advanced in the 20 years since this release), the quality of the film was not.  It's a wonderful story, an artful balance of comedy and pathos, played just right by the talented and adorable Juliet Stevenson and the always superb Alan Rickman.  That this is the first big screen film directed by the late Anthony Minghella makes 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' a piece of cinematic history and cultural artifact worthy of preservation.  Let's get that DVD release back into production!",5,The first big screen film directed by the late Anthony Minghella is a piece of cinematic history,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,757,"['waited', 'waited', 'find', 'copy', 'out-of-print', 'DVD', 'acceptable', 'price', 'What', ""n't"", 'production', 'mystery', 'Eventually', 'broke', 'down', 'ordered', 'VHS.Good', 'call', 'quality', 'video', 'was', 'dreadful', 'one', 'appreciation', 'how', 'far', 'technology', 'advanced', '20', 'years', 'release', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'wonderful', 'story', 'artful', 'balance', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'talented', 'adorable', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'always', 'superb', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'first', 'big', 'screen', 'film', 'directed', 'late', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', ""'Truly"", 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'history', 'cultural', 'artifact', 'worthy', 'preservation', 'Let', 'get', 'DVD', 'release', 'back', 'production']",N/A

Is a great movie about loss and love that isn't dreary or heavy, but lighter than air.It's funny, tender, moving, and intelligent.  If I had to name a personal favorite, although I have thousands in my ""top 100 list"" this movie would be it. Minghella just wrote something delicate and funny, human, compassionate, and that exudes not only a love for people in all their differences, but that also just as wonderfully exudes a love of music and of literature.Telling the story of Nina, a woman coping with a devastating loss, the script is whimsical and lighter than air and yet about some incredibly big, deep stuff. Juliet Stevenson is hilarous, klutzy, befuddled, and lovable as Nina -- sweetly goofy in some scenes, and then absolutely wrenching in others. And it's great to see Alan Rickman in a rare (and very charming) romantic leading role as Jamie (who knew he could sing?). Michael Maloney's role is tougher in some ways, but he has a touching and quite charismatic opening scene, as well as one of the funniest first-date-scenes I've ever seen.Ultimately, Truly Madly Deeply is a lovely, resonant story about grownups who don't talk like they're in a movie. The performances are fantastic, the romantic triangle is unique and likeable, and every character is a memorable and believable person you're happy to have met, from the romantic Polish handyman, to Nina's prickly yet big-hearted Scottish boss (a fabulous Bill Paterson), to the philosophical rat exterminator (who's pretty sure rats can talk to each other), to Nina's best friend, a very pregnant Spanish filmmaker who manages to keep a cheery attitude even when forced to clean houses for a living. Everyone we meet in the movie is smart, individual, and delightful (even the ghosts, who spend most of their afterlife watching movies on borrowed VCRs).The DVD itself looks great, with a few notable informational tidbits and features. My favorite special feature is the smart, funny, and fascinating DVD commentary from director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella (better known for ""The English Patient"") -- Minghella's commentary is as rich and interesting as the movie itself, like having him over to dinner to discuss life, death, love, and film.Ultimately, Truly Madly Deeply is a wonderful experience. It's also a great reminder in these sometimes difficult post-9-11 times, that -- for anyone who's ever lost a loved one, the sun does keep shining (even when the feet want to march elsewhere).",5,"Intelligent, Hilarious, and Deeply Moving (with great DVD Extras)",1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2475,"['great', 'movie', 'loss', 'love', ""n't"", 'dreary', 'heavy', 'lighter', 'air.It', 'funny', 'tender', 'moving', 'intelligent', 'had', 'name', 'personal', 'favorite', 'have', 'thousands', 'top', '100', 'list', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Minghella', 'just', 'wrote', 'something', 'delicate', 'funny', 'human', 'compassionate', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'people', 'differences', 'also', 'just', 'wonderfully', 'love', 'music', 'literature.Telling', 'story', 'Nina', 'woman', 'coping', 'devastating', 'loss', 'script', 'whimsical', 'lighter', 'air', 'yet', 'incredibly', 'big', 'deep', 'stuff', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'hilarous', 'klutzy', 'befuddled', 'lovable', 'Nina', 'sweetly', 'goofy', 'scenes', 'then', 'absolutely', 'wrenching', 'others', 'great', 'see', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'rare', 'very', 'charming', 'romantic', 'leading', 'role', 'Jamie', 'who', 'knew', 'could', 'sing', 'Michael', 'Maloney', 'role', 'tougher', 'ways', 'touching', 'quite', 'charismatic', 'opening', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'funniest', 'first-date-scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Ultimately', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'lovely', 'resonant', 'story', 'grownups', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', ""'re"", 'movie', 'performances', 'are', 'fantastic', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'unique', 'likeable', 'character', 'memorable', 'believable', 'person', ""'re"", 'happy', 'have', 'met', 'romantic', 'Polish', 'handyman', 'Nina', 'prickly', 'yet', 'big-hearted', 'Scottish', 'boss', 'fabulous', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'philosophical', 'rat', 'exterminator', 'who', 'pretty', 'sure', 'rats', 'can', 'talk', 'other', 'Nina', 'best', 'friend', 'very', 'pregnant', 'Spanish', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'keep', 'cheery', 'attitude', 'even', 'when', 'forced', 'clean', 'houses', 'living', 'Everyone', 'meet', 'movie', 'smart', 'individual', 'delightful', 'even', 'ghosts', 'who', 'spend', 'most', 'afterlife', 'watching', 'movies', 'borrowed', 'VCRs', '.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'few', 'notable', 'informational', 'tidbits', 'features', 'favorite', 'special', 'feature', 'smart', 'funny', 'fascinating', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'better', 'known', 'English', 'Patient', 'Minghella', 'commentary', 'rich', 'interesting', 'movie', 'having', 'dinner', 'discuss', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'film.Ultimately', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'also', 'great', 'reminder', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'post-9-11', 'times', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'sun', 'keep', 'shining', 'even', 'when', 'feet', 'want', 'march', 'elsewhere']",N/A

Seems  he died of complications from a sore throat, a definite wink for Rickman, known in the Biz as The Voice (even before Dogma), for obvious reasons...It seems Nina cannot get on with her life without Jamie.  The man soothed her with CELLO MUSIC, for heaven's sake.  He SANG to her...THEY sang duets and she played the piano and danced, ala Isadora Duncan.  They delighted in mutually warped senses of humor...  We're talking dream relationship here...and then...suddenly he's dead and - devastated -- Nina cannot face life without him.Ultimately, Nina's grieving and pain brings Jaime back...in a corporal form.  Two drawbacks; he is ALWAYS cold, and some of his afterlife buddies have moved in along with him...video-watching ghosts from beyond, who take over Nina's little flat, making themselves at home in front of the telly watching old movies until all hours.At first, Nina is in heaven.  Shutting herself up in her flat to glory in the return of the admittedly delicious Jamie, she effectively eliminates everything else in her world.  But reality must enter the picture (this being Hollywood and all), and soon Jamie's annoying little habits begin to get under Nina's skin (think lying back in a warm tub, a cleansing mask on your face, and opening your eyes only see to a plastic fish - wearing glasses -- ""swimming"" at your face...or...being awakened with Rickman's soft baritone voice crooning ""It's Raining in My Heart"" in your ear as a cold glass of water is systematically drizzled on your head.)  Jamie is also into totally rearranging Nina's apartment, something she has endeavored to make uniquely her own.The birth of a friend's baby and finding a new male acquaintance, are the catalysts that finally make Nina choose life over death. In a five-hankie scene, Jamie has Nina translate a beautiful poem - about a lover choosing to go on and not follow the dead love to the grave -- as he recites it in (poor) Spanish.If you are a Rickman fan, this is a MUST SEE.  He is delightful as the moody, persnickety, musical Jamie...and it is an added treat to hear his rendition of ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Any More"".  He has a not-half-bad singing voice, and it's obvious he was having a hoot doing it.If you view Rickman as merely ""the cool guy who plays Severus Snape in the Harry Potter flicks"", you ALSO must secure this movie!  If you have enjoyed the man in other movies, but have never seen this one (it's novel...one of the few I can think of where he leaves ALL his clothes on -- including an overcoat -- and still remains the sensuous Alan Rickman we know and drool over) you SIMPLY MUST!Five enthusiastic stars for Rickman at his most divinely delicious!",5,Rickman Fans...Delight!,1060819200,"08 14, 2003",2003,3052,"['Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'not', 'new', 'release', 'very', 'much', 'purchasing', 'like', 'music', 'romance', 'course', 'enjoy', 'Alan', 'Rickman.TMD', 'woman', 'Nina', '/Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'lost', 'boyfriend/lover', 'Jamie', '/Alan', 'Rickman', 'love', 'life', 'reason', 'living', 'know', 'passionate', 'everlasting', 'stuff', 'died', 'complications', 'sore', 'throat', 'definite', 'wink', 'Rickman', 'known', 'Biz', 'Voice', 'even', 'Dogma', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Nina', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'life', 'Jamie', 'man', 'soothed', 'CELLO', 'MUSIC', 'heaven', 'sake', 'SANG', 'THEY', 'sang', 'duets', 'played', 'piano', 'danced', 'ala', 'Isadora', 'Duncan', 'delighted', 'mutually', 'warped', 'senses', 'humor', ""'re"", 'talking', 'dream', 'relationship', 'here', 'then', 'suddenly', 'dead', 'devastated', 'Nina', 'can', 'not', 'face', 'life', 'him.Ultimately', 'Nina', 'grieving', 'pain', 'brings', 'Jaime', 'back', 'corporal', 'form', 'Two', 'drawbacks', 'ALWAYS', 'cold', 'afterlife', 'buddies', 'have', 'moved', 'along', 'video-watching', 'ghosts', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'Nina', 'little', 'flat', 'making', 'home', 'front', 'telly', 'watching', 'old', 'movies', 'hours.At', 'first', 'Nina', 'heaven', 'Shutting', 'up', 'flat', 'glory', 'return', 'admittedly', 'delicious', 'Jamie', 'effectively', 'everything', 'else', 'world', 'reality', 'must', 'enter', 'picture', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'soon', 'Jamie', 'annoying', 'little', 'habits', 'begin', 'get', 'Nina', 'skin', 'think', 'lying', 'back', 'warm', 'tub', 'cleansing', 'mask', 'face', 'opening', 'eyes', 'only', 'see', 'plastic', 'fish', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'swimming', 'face', 'being', 'awakened', 'Rickman', 'soft', 'baritone', 'voice', 'crooning', 'Raining', 'My', 'Heart', 'ear', 'cold', 'glass', 'water', 'systematically', 'drizzled', 'head', 'Jamie', 'also', 'totally', 'rearranging', 'Nina', 'apartment', 'something', 'endeavored', 'make', 'uniquely', 'own.The', 'birth', 'friend', 'baby', 'finding', 'new', 'male', 'acquaintance', 'are', 'catalysts', 'finally', 'make', 'Nina', 'choose', 'life', 'death', 'five-hankie', 'scene', 'Jamie', 'Nina', 'translate', 'beautiful', 'poem', 'lover', 'choosing', 'go', 'not', 'follow', 'dead', 'love', 'grave', 'poor', 'Spanish.If', 'are', 'Rickman', 'fan', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'delightful', 'moody', 'persnickety', 'musical', 'Jamie', 'added', 'treat', 'hear', 'rendition', 'Sun', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Gon', 'Shine', 'More', 'not-half-bad', 'singing', 'voice', 'obvious', 'was', 'having', 'hoot', 'doing', 'it.If', 'view', 'Rickman', 'merely', 'cool', 'guy', 'who', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'flicks', 'ALSO', 'must', 'secure', 'movie', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'man', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'novel', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'clothes', 'including', 'overcoat', 'still', 'sensuous', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'know', 'drool', 'SIMPLY', 'MUST', 'Five', 'enthusiastic', 'stars', 'Rickman', 'most', 'divinely', 'delicious']",N/A

I was truly expecting a lot more from this movie, and as I think about it, the beginning was great.

She is obviously hurt and angry, yet putting on a pleasant mask to cover up at the start. Sometimes she hears his voice.  Then in a moving scene, he reappears.

Alan Rickman stars as a ghost who returns to his newly widowed, deeply mourning wife -- a wife who is completely possessed by her loss -- and proceeds to fill her with all the joys she felt with him while he was alive.  But ultimately she must make a choice between the opportunity for a budding romance with a living man and her memories of a man who, as a ghost, is slowly but surely becoming a pain.  And so, this nagging question:  did the ghost deliberately return, planning to become a pain, so as to spur her to appreciate the life that is around her?  There is a beautiful scene where Rickman's character tells of parents in a park given new reasons to closely hug their children...  This movie is completely beautiful.

It is deceptive, I think, to call it a ""thinking man's Ghost,"" because, while it is entertaining, and even funny, at times, it is essentially a study of a woman's journey through intense grief.  The first half of the film is a real tear jerker as Nina struggles with her grief.  Her joy at the arrival (apparently truly in the flesh) of her dead lover's Ghost does little to mitigate the intensity of the sorrow we feel on Nina's behalf.  From reviews I have read of this movie, it appears many men are uncomfortable with the intensity of this movie.  Perhaps this is best seen as a ""woman's movie.""  It is one of my favorites, if, for no other reason than Stevenson's acting, which is among the very best I've ever seen on screen.

310677,A3INMIZIYJ9BQ4,6302409772,"Judi Fryer ""Judi,  Entertainment-glutton""","[9, 10]","The commentary of Anthony Minghella was extremely interesting.  In addition to the usual insider tidbits about the film, Minghella gave us a great deal of information about how little he knew about film making when he directed the film, how short the shooting schedule was (28 days), and what a small budget they had ($650,000).  He pointed out every directorial mistake he made; things that he `would never do now' because he would be embarrassed by them.  Being the writer as well as the director, he also shared with the viewers that he thought he was writing a comedy. Only later upon seeing the reaction of audiences did he come to realize what strong emotions the film could evoke and how viewers perceived the message as being about how to handle grief, so much so that it has become a tool used by professionals to help the bereaved handle their loss.Given how much more personal this film is than `The English Patient', the viewer might infer that directors can often be more effective when they don't know so much about their craft and they are not trying so hard to manipulate their audience with camera angles, wide shots, pans, etc. etc.  What the viewer might more clearly discern is that this film is so successful, so entertaining, and so powerful almost solely due to the cast.  The writer actually meant to say something else, the director was uneducated in his craft, but the actors more than made up for all those shortcomings.  The cast, particularly the three main characters, transcended all the flaws, found meaning the writer didn't write, and turned in top notch, grade-A, 100% flawless performances.This film encompasses more than a lesson in grief management.  It is an education in all we can learn about love, true love.  Showing what it truly means to love totally and completely, so much so that we will do absolutely anything for the welfare of those we love, including helping them get over their love for us if necessary.  Alan Rickman, according to the director, played his role with almost no emotion because it was what the role required.  Rickman is superb enough at his craft to appear to be superficial, irritating, and insensitive and still manage to exude more heartfelt emotion than most actors can display when they are giving their best effort.  Using only his arms and hands in a loving embrace, Rickman conveys more to the viewer than 20 pages of a script would reveal.  Juliet Stevenson displayed every possible emotion one can experience when dealing with both grief and with love, with the sorrow of the mingling of the two, and the happiness of discovering the latter.  The supporting cast, comprised of a group of well-known, highly regarded English actors and a variety of friends and relatives of the writer/director, fulfilled their roles admirably.When watching a film primarily for the purposes of seeing Alan Rickman's performance, his presence is often the best thing about the film.  Not so with `Truly, Madly, Deeply'.  Alan and Juliet together make the film all that it is, and that is wonderfully entertaining and deeply touching.  This movie makes `Ghost' seem as lightweight as a wisp of wind and a waif of smoke.  `Truly, Madly, Deeply' is the `real thing'.  The film touches your heart and stirs a multitude of human emotions.  Alan and Juliet alternately, or sometimes simultaneously, bring tears to your eyes, laughter to your lips, and ample amounts of pain and joy to your heart.  Speaking of `tears to your eyes', don't even attempt to watch this film without a box of tissues handy.  You will definitely need them.  You will be entertained and touched, and you will be glad you made the decision to watch this movie, not just for the first time either.",5,"Absolutely wonderful film, not  to be missed!",1061078400,"08 17, 2003",2003,3726,"['commentary', 'Anthony', 'Minghella', 'was', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'addition', 'usual', 'insider', 'tidbits', 'film', 'Minghella', 'gave', 'great', 'deal', 'information', 'how', 'little', 'knew', 'film', 'making', 'when', 'directed', 'film', 'how', 'short', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'was', '28', 'days', 'what', 'small', 'budget', 'had', '650,000', 'pointed', 'out', 'directorial', 'mistake', 'made', 'things', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'Being', 'writer', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'also', 'shared', 'viewers', 'thought', 'was', 'writing', 'comedy', 'Only', 'later', 'seeing', 'reaction', 'audiences', 'did', 'come', 'realize', 'what', 'strong', 'film', 'could', 'evoke', 'how', 'viewers', 'perceived', 'message', 'being', 'how', 'handle', 'grief', 'so', 'much', 'become', 'tool', 'used', 'professionals', 'help', 'bereaved', 'handle', 'loss.Given', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'personal', 'film', 'English', 'Patient', 'viewer', 'might', 'infer', 'directors', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'so', 'much', 'craft', 'are', 'not', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'camera', 'angles', 'wide', 'shots', 'pans', 'etc', 'etc', 'What', 'viewer', 'might', 'more', 'clearly', 'discern', 'film', 'so', 'successful', 'so', 'entertaining', 'so', 'powerful', 'almost', 'solely', 'due', 'cast', 'writer', 'actually', 'meant', 'say', 'something', 'else', 'director', 'was', 'uneducated', 'craft', 'actors', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'shortcomings', 'cast', 'particularly', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'transcended', 'flaws', 'found', 'meaning', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'turned', 'top', 'notch', 'grade-A', '100', '%', 'flawless', 'performances.This', 'film', 'more', 'lesson', 'grief', 'management', 'education', 'can', 'learn', 'love', 'true', 'love', 'Showing', 'what', 'truly', 'love', 'totally', 'completely', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'do', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'welfare', 'love', 'including', 'helping', 'get', 'love', 'necessary', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'according', 'director', 'played', 'role', 'almost', 'emotion', 'was', 'what', 'role', 'required', 'Rickman', 'superb', 'enough', 'craft', 'appear', 'be', 'superficial', 'irritating', 'insensitive', 'still', 'manage', 'exude', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'display', 'when', 'are', 'giving', 'best', 'effort', 'Using', 'only', 'arms', 'hands', 'loving', 'embrace', 'Rickman', 'more', 'viewer', '20', 'pages', 'script', 'would', 'reveal', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'displayed', 'possible', 'emotion', 'one', 'can', 'experience', 'when', 'dealing', 'grief', 'love', 'sorrow', 'mingling', 'two', 'happiness', 'discovering', 'latter', 'supporting', 'cast', 'comprised', 'group', 'well-known', 'highly', 'regarded', 'English', 'actors', 'variety', 'friends', 'relatives', 'writer/director', 'fulfilled', 'roles', 'admirably.When', 'watching', 'film', 'primarily', 'purposes', 'seeing', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'performance', 'presence', 'often', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Not', 'so', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'Alan', 'Juliet', 'together', 'make', 'film', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'deeply', 'touching', 'movie', 'Ghost', 'seem', 'as', 'lightweight', 'wisp', 'wind', 'waif', 'smoke', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'real', 'thing', 'film', 'touches', 'heart', 'multitude', 'human', 'emotions', 'Alan', 'Juliet', 'alternately', 'sometimes', 'simultaneously', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'laughter', 'lips', 'ample', 'amounts', 'pain', 'joy', 'heart', 'Speaking', 'tears', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'watch', 'film', 'box', 'tissues', 'handy', 'will', 'definitely', 'need', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'touched', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'made', 'decision', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'first', 'time']",N/A

It is a genre bending film that is a romantic fantasy with both comedic and dramatic layers. Original and unusual, it is at times drolly funny. At other times, it is profoundly sad and poignant.The plot revolves around Nina (Juliet Stevenson), a thirty something English woman who has lost Jamie (Alan Rickman), the love of her life, to a totally unexpected death. She is profoundly in despair and her grief is bottomless, piercing, palpable, and all encompassing. Living in a rat infested flat, Nina seems unable to cope with life without her Jamie, for whom she incessantly longs. When it seems that she can no longer bear the pain of his loss, he suddenly comes back from the dead, no figment of her imagination.Initially overjoyed, transformed by her sheer happiness at having Jamie back, she becomes her old self. Of course, it is too good to be true. He starts having all his dead friends crash at the flat with him, invading her space and privacy, redoing her flat, and complaining. Those little annoying things about Jamie that she had forgotten come bubbling to the surface. Having romanticized their relationship in her overwhelming sense of loss, this reminder of how he really was helps to ground her grief.When she meets a sensitive and attractive man, Mark (Michael Maloney), who is attracted to her, she finds herself torn between the memories of her love for her dead Jamie and the possibility of love with the very much alive Mark. Nina has a decision to make that will determine her future. Moreover, the viewer has to wonder whether Jamie's return and subsequent behavior was part of a concerted effort prompted by his love for Nina and his own profound sadness at seeing her unable to go on with a life without him. They surely loved each other truly, madly, deeply.Juliet Stevenson gives a bravura performance as the haunted Nina. The scene in which she unburdens her grief to her therapist is heartbreaking in scope and will render the viewer to a sobbing, gibbering jelly. Alan Rickman's performance as the beloved Jamie is both romantic and droll. The viewer can understand how it was that Nina and Jamie loved each other so much. Michael Maloney is likewise engaging as the sensitive and whimsical Mark. The viewer knows the instant Mark appears on screen that, if any man can woo Nina away from her memories and spectral lover, it is he.All in all, this has got to be one of the most definitive films on love, overwhelming grief, and closure. Bravo!The DVD provides a crystal clear picture as well an excellent audio. While it has some bonus features, it is limited to an audio commentary with the director, as well as a brief interview with him.

He had always been careful about not getting a cold and suddenly he dies one day after getting a sore throat. A silly way to leave, so it's not a wonder, that Nina can't help being angry and lost. His apartment is a mess, infested with rats. And she can't get a grip of life, although she has wonderful friends around her. Excellent acting by all them, by the way, real British quality work. She keeps hearing Jamie's voice (everyone who's lost a loved one knows, what it is...) and finally, when she is really down, she suddenly hears his cello - and Jamie stands behind her in flesh. The way Jamie (Rickman) holds her is more like dancing than acting, really beautiful and moving.Very lightly the movie avoids sentimentality and lets Stevenson and Rickman be both touching and comical. One minute Rickman is talking about the wonderful capacity of human beings to love and wondering where it disappears - and then: &quot;I blame the government. I hate the bastards.&quot; Wonderful work. So is their singing, though they sound quite terrible at times. Funny thing is, that Rickman speaks in a very musical way, almost singing - but sings like he's afraid of hearing his voice for real. Anyway, Jamie is suddenly happy again, which is no wonder, Rickman couldn't be a more lovable ghost even if he shaved that silly moustache. But he's always chilly - and he brings along friends, who like watching old movies. Although the ghosts are very nice and polite and helpful and keep the rats out and play beautiful music, too (I wouldn't mind them living with me), Nina notices slowly, that it isn't exactly what she wanted. And another man steps into her life, a funny man, who is alive...Again I'd like to give 4,5 stars if possible. This is a very nice movie, touching without being unbelievably sentimental and funny without falling into cheap comedy, the actors are great, real personalities, and the change in Nina's flat depicts interestingly, how her life and state of mind changes with the return of Jamie and the help of his dead friends - though Nina hardly sees it as helping. It's hard to say, what I missed, so that I couldn't give 5 stars. Maybe a bit sharper work in directing and manuscript.

I have never had a film pull at the heart strings the way that this film did, and I am not a person to be made emotional with a film easily.  The acting was wonderful, and Alan Rickman, as always, was stellar. I had a slightly different take of this film than a few of the reviews that I read. *Warning! Spoilers* The way that I took Jamie's fussiness and moments of agitation to Nina (Stevenson's character), was that he was trying to make her remember that he wasn't perfect. In the beginning of the movie, she is remembering all of his wonderful qualities.  This is evident in that when he first returned, he was the Jamie that she had been missing, but then his quirks began to emerge.  Again, I did not take these to be flaws in Jamie's character, but rather that he was ""over emphasizing"" the things he used to do that drove her crazy.  He had returned to help her heal, and she would never do that as long as she was holding on to a sanctified version of him.  The whole motive of his actions were centered around getting her to the point that she must say out loud, literally, that she ""would go on living.""  And he gets her to that point...poetically.  Its beautiful.  I have to say the most heart wrenching scene for me was when Jamie was standing in the window of the flat watching her leave.  The film wasn't just about her saying goodbye, but it was a goodbye for him as well - for he had to let her go too, so that she could live.This film will touch on all the emotions in the human spectrum. You will laugh, and cry, or in my case, weep.  It will certainly leave you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled.  Its one of the most touching films I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend it  to anyone who enjoys British films, and British humor.  I loved this movie because the characters were so real.

And for a while she's overjoyed.  But then she starts to remember why Jamie often made her crazy, remembers that he wasn't a saint or an angel, but a man.  And losing him was a tragedy, but not one she can't ever recover from.  She's alive and she wants a life.  She can't have that with Jamie, and finally she gets the closure she needs to say good-bye to him, and move on.So many comparisons were made between TMD and Ghost, but comparisons do justice to neither film.  Taken on its own merits, I'd have to say that TMD is one of the sweetest love stories I've ever seen because it's one of the most real.  Nina is a real woman who gets blotchy when she cries, has second thoughts, says and does foolish things and loves deeply.  She has needs and desires which she puts on hold out of grief, but when she gets a good, solid nudge from the ghost of her lover, she recognizes how much of life is ahead of her and she accepts, finally, that loss is a part of that life.I'm not sure why this film means so much to me.  At a guess I'd say that it transcends my love for Alan Rickman by miles.

He is a true gem and a ridiculously underatted actor. It is such a shame for there is no one that can compare to him.Truly, Madly, Deeply is, for some reason, labeled as a comedy. While there are cute, funny moments- 99% of which occur when Alan Rickman is onscreen-this is, without a doubt, a heartbreaking romantic drama. It leaves you feeling achy and depressed throughout the whole film and you can't but help feeling for Juliet Stevenson's character. You can feel her despair, her justified anger at being left so alone, so suddenly. Really, really great acting there.And then Alan enters like a ray of beautiful sunshine, and you feel that everything will be alright. For how can it not be? It's very clear the two characters are meant to be together, forever.To be honest, the movie itself feels a tad on the outdated side and could have been a bit more interesting in certain parts, but it really is all about the relationship between the two central characters, and in that regard, the film works.Like I said, the movie has wit, charm and the perfect splash of humour, but for the love of God, remember your hanky...",4,A very bittersweet film,1227225600,"11 21, 2008",2008,1206,"['are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'words', 'dictionary', 'adequately', 'describe', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'true', 'gem', 'ridiculously', 'underatted', 'actor', 'such', 'shame', 'one', 'can', 'compare', 'him.Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'reason', 'labeled', 'comedy', 'are', 'cute', 'funny', 'moments-', '99', '%', 'occur', 'when', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'onscreen-this', 'doubt', 'heartbreaking', 'romantic', 'drama', 'feeling', 'achy', 'depressed', 'whole', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'character', 'can', 'feel', 'despair', 'justified', 'anger', 'being', 'left', 'so', 'alone', 'suddenly', 'Really', 'really', 'great', 'acting', 'there.And', 'then', 'Alan', 'enters', 'ray', 'beautiful', 'sunshine', 'feel', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'alright', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'together', 'forever.To', 'be', 'honest', 'movie', 'tad', 'outdated', 'side', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'certain', 'parts', 'really', 'relationship', 'two', 'central', 'characters', 'regard', 'film', 'works.Like', 'said', 'movie', 'wit', 'charm', 'perfect', 'splash', 'humour', 'love', 'God', 'remember', 'hanky']",N/A

There's really no reason to compare Ghost to Truly Madly Deeply but if you find yourself wanting to watch a movie about bereaved woman who's lover has died only to have said lover return to her in ghost-form and you've got to choose, well... Truly Madly Deeply is a far superior choice.The plot is simple enough. Nina (Juliet Stevenson) is plagued by grief over the death of her lover Jamie (Alan Rickman). When the grief becomes unbearable, he returns to her in ghost-form. She's ecstatic and they're still as in love as they ever were, but when Jamie starts bringing his ghost buddies over to the house to watch video tapes and play orchestra at all hours of the day and night, she realises that things can never be the same again.It almost sounds ridiculous but Truly Madly Deeply is an incredibly touching film about love and letting go. The premise could easily turn this movie into a joke, but a clever script and stellar cast (it's nice to see Alan Rickman play off roles and Juliet Stevenson is particularly effective as a woman in mourning) gives it completely solid support- it knows exactly where it is at all times. While the subject matter is a bit depressing it is expertly alleviated by incredibly funny and moving moments scattered throughtout. If you're a romantic at heart you'll enjoy this movie but expect to shed quite a few tears. I would consider that the only negative aspect of the movie to share with you here- while it's a rich story chalk full of warmth and laughter, it is definitley sad and may require a certain type of mood. I consider it to be a perfect movie to curl up with on a rainy day.",4,"Put ""Ghost"" back on the shelf",1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,1768,"['words', 'More', 'romantic', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Ghost', 'are', 'written', 'copy', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'have', 'admit', ""'re"", 'right', 'really', 'reason', 'compare', 'Ghost', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', 'movie', 'bereaved', 'woman', 'who', 'lover', 'died', 'only', 'have', 'said', 'lover', 'return', 'ghost-form', ""'ve"", 'got', 'choose', 'well', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'far', 'superior', 'choice.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'Nina', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'plagued', 'grief', 'death', 'lover', 'Jamie', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'When', 'grief', 'unbearable', 'ghost-form', 'ecstatic', ""'re"", 'still', 'love', 'ever', 'were', 'when', 'Jamie', 'bringing', 'ghost', 'buddies', 'house', 'watch', 'video', 'tapes', 'play', 'orchestra', 'hours', 'day', 'night', 'things', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again.It', 'almost', 'ridiculous', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'film', 'love', 'letting', 'go', 'premise', 'could', 'easily', 'turn', 'movie', 'joke', 'clever', 'script', 'stellar', 'cast', 'nice', 'see', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'play', 'off', 'roles', 'Juliet', 'Stevenson', 'particularly', 'effective', 'woman', 'mourning', 'completely', 'solid', 'support-', 'exactly', 'where', 'times', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'depressing', 'expertly', 'alleviated', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'moving', 'moments', 'scattered', 'throughtout', ""'re"", 'romantic', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'expect', 'shed', 'quite', 'few', 'tears', 'would', 'consider', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'movie', 'share', 'here-', 'rich', 'story', 'chalk', 'full', 'warmth', 'laughter', 'definitley', 'sad', 'may', 'require', 'certain', 'type', 'mood', 'consider', 'be', 'perfect', 'movie', 'curl', 'up', 'rainy', 'day']",N/A
