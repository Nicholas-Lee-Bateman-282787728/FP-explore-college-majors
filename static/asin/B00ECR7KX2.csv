1666693,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B00ECR7KX2,A. Gammill,"[6, 8]","First of all, if you can't past the idea of using the original William Shakespeare text in modern times, nothing will probably make you like this film.  I personally think it was a bold choice.  The works of ""The Bard"" have endured for centuries for a reason.  There are MANY examples of films adapting Shakespeare, many of them great (Forbidden Planet, 10 Things I Hate About You, Gnomeo & Juliet, just off the top of my head).  Whedon seems to be saying, let's let the words speak for themselves.  He then chose to put the words into the mouths of what Joss Whedon fans will recognize as a ""Dream Cast.""  I've been saying for many years that Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof (as bickering lovers Beatrice and Benedick) should be bigger stars.  And while Whedon's film didn't exactly make them household names, it does put the pair front and center where they belong.  And who doesn't love ""Avengers"" and ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" actor Clark Gregg?  He makes acting look effortless, even in the strange tongue used here.  Add Nathan Fillion and ""Buffy""'s Tom Lenk for some great comedy and ""Firefly""'s Sean Maher in a rare villain role, and you've really got something.In the (22 min.) documentary, Whedon offers his justification for the choices he made--shooting in black & white, casting and location.  I think my favorite part is when Nathan Fillion gushes about Gregg: ""I just watched him in that scene and I thought, 'So THAT's how it's done.'""  There are also commentary tracks with the director and cast, but I haven't watched them (as much as I love learning about how films are made, I usually get bored quickly with those).Like I said above, if you can accept the ancient dialects, it's really a very good adaptation.  The themes of the film--the joys and absurdities of love--are universal.  I don't consider myself well-read on Shakespeare, but the story was easy to follow.  Certainly, if you're a fan of Whedon and his cast, this is a must-see.",4,"Certainly not for everyone, but very well-done",1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1956,"['First', 'all', 'ca', ""n't"", 'past', 'idea', 'using', 'original', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'text', 'modern', 'times', 'nothing', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'film', 'personally', 'think', 'was', 'bold', 'choice', 'works', 'Bard', 'have', 'endured', 'centuries', 'reason', 'are', 'MANY', 'examples', 'films', 'adapting', 'Shakespeare', 'many', 'great', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'Gnomeo', 'Juliet', 'just', 'top', 'head', 'be', 'saying', 'let', 'let', 'words', 'speak', 'then', 'chose', 'put', 'words', 'mouths', 'what', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'Dream', 'Cast', ""'ve"", 'been', 'saying', 'many', 'years', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'bickering', 'lovers', 'Beatrice', 'Benedick', 'should', 'be', 'bigger', 'stars', 'Whedon', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'household', 'names', 'put', 'pair', 'front', 'center', 'where', 'belong', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Avengers', 'Agents', 'S.H.I.E.L.D', 'actor', 'Clark', 'Gregg', 'acting', 'look', 'effortless', 'even', 'strange', 'tongue', 'used', 'here', 'Add', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Buffy', 'Tom', 'Lenk', 'great', 'comedy', 'Firefly', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'rare', 'villain', 'role', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', '22', 'min', 'documentary', 'Whedon', 'justification', 'choices', 'made', 'shooting', 'black', 'white', 'casting', 'location', 'think', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'gushes', 'Gregg', 'just', 'watched', 'scene', 'thought', 'THAT', 'how', 'done', 'are', 'also', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'director', 'cast', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'learning', 'how', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'usually', 'get', 'bored', 'quickly', '.Like', 'said', 'can', 'accept', 'ancient', 'dialects', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'adaptation', 'themes', 'film', 'joys', 'absurdities', 'love', 'are', 'universal', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'well-read', 'Shakespeare', 'story', 'was', 'easy', 'follow', 'Certainly', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Whedon', 'cast', 'must-see']",N/A

It misses in that the visual is neither striking nor pleasant. The characters seem to be always drinking. It reminds me, alas, of a party that started on Friday, and then the guests keep having to stave off hangovers by continuing to drink right through the weekend, never tidying after themselves. The hairstyles and clothing of the ladies are often limp, suggesting that they slept in their hair and did not bother to comb it. For two days. Saddest of all, a lesser male role of henchman is played by a woman dressed as a hooker, and when she is called &#34;Sirrah,&#34; one must simply cringe.Face it. Much Ado is a difficult play to dazzle with. It needs zing and pepper between the two antagonistic lovers.

1666698,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00ECR7KX2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 5]","I have to admit, I just don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a fan of this story much.  I rather hated the 1993 version starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, but at least with that version it felt authentic and fluid.  There is a lot missing from Joss Whedon&#8217;s adaptation, and all of the things that I thought would make me connect to this film wound up taking me even further out of the story and forcing me to hate it even more.It is very pretty though.Modernizing Shakespeare is nothing new.  We saw it done in 1996 with &#8216;Romeo + Juliet&#8217; and then again in 2000 with &#8216;Hamlet&#8217;.  Both of those versions, much like Whedon&#8217;s film, kept the original dialog and Old English dialect intact.  I&#8217;m not ashamed to say that I consider Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s &#8216;Romeo + Juliet&#8217; to be a masterpiece of modern cinema and a bench march for Shakespearian adaptations.  It&#8217;s just perfect.  While many took issue with the use of Old English, I found that the natural performances really heightened the experience, taking the dialog and making it feel fresh, authentic and appropriate.  It is tricky when you take these particular &#8216;words&#8217; and update the setting.It&#8217;s a slippery slope.Others have attempted updating Shakespeare and completely rewriting his dialog and situations to make it work.  We saw this in 1999&#8217;s &#8217;10 Things I Hate About You&#8217;.  It worked really, really well.  Shakespeare is a gamble, but it is a risk that many filmmakers and actors have attempted and will continue to attempt because his work is so important and universally beloved.So, what exactly is the problem with Whedon&#8217;s &#8216;Much Ado About Nothing&#8217;?  Well, for starters, the acting is a serious sore point.  I will admit, I never followed Whedon&#8217;s television career and I am not familiar with these actors at all.  I do understand that he has a following and that these actors are regulars (mostly) for his work and that his fans were delighted to see them get roles here.  This was a passion project for Whedon as well, which I admire.  He filmed the whole thing at his own home.  I think that is also a major issue with me, for the nature of this film felt very &#8216;drama student rehearsing&#8217;.  The whole feel of the film was very amateur to me.  The line readings were awkward and while the majority of the staging and even the modern adapting of scenarios was intriguing and definitely eye catching, the delivery felt off kilter.Alexis Denisof is especially unfortunate, and he has a major role here.Despite being beautifully filmed, I found that my attention was never held by this film.  Like I mentioned on the outset, I&#8217;m just not a fan of the story much, but I had higher hopes for this.  The convoluted plot can be scattered, cluttered and ridiculous, but where I initially thought the silly nature of the 1993 version was a detractor, I&#8217;m beginning to think it was a saving grace.  This film loses all of the whimsy nature of the story and replaces it with slow burn that feels void of any real spark or energy.  It almost emphasizes the story&#8217;s ridiculousness because it isn&#8217;t masked over by the film&#8217;s tone.Sadly, the film has no tone.",2,"Well, this was a bore...",1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,3260,"['have', 'admit', 'just', 'don', '8217', 'think', '8217', 'fan', 'story', 'much', 'rather', 'hated', '1993', 'version', 'starring', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'least', 'version', 'felt', 'authentic', 'fluid', 'lot', 'missing', 'Joss', 'Whedon', '8217', 'adaptation', 'things', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'connect', 'film', 'wound', 'up', 'taking', 'even', 'further', 'story', 'forcing', 'hate', 'even', 'more.It', 'very', 'pretty', 'though.Modernizing', 'Shakespeare', 'nothing', 'new', 'saw', 'done', '1996', '8216', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', '8217', 'then', 'again', '2000', '8216', 'Hamlet', '8217', 'versions', 'much', 'Whedon', '8217', 'film', 'kept', 'original', 'dialog', 'Old', 'English', 'dialect', 'intact', '8217', 'not', 'ashamed', 'say', 'consider', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', '8217', '8216', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', '8217', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'modern', 'cinema', 'bench', 'march', 'Shakespearian', 'adaptations', '8217', 's', 'just', 'perfect', 'many', 'took', 'issue', 'use', 'Old', 'English', 'found', 'natural', 'performances', 'really', 'heightened', 'experience', 'taking', 'dialog', 'making', 'feel', 'fresh', 'authentic', 'appropriate', 'tricky', 'when', 'take', 'particular', '8216', 'words', '8217', 'update', 'setting.It', '8217', 's', 'slippery', 'slope.Others', 'have', 'attempted', 'updating', 'Shakespeare', 'completely', 'rewriting', 'dialog', 'situations', 'make', 'work', 'saw', '1999', '8217', '8217', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', '8217', 'worked', 'really', 'really', 'well', 'Shakespeare', 'gamble', 'risk', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'have', 'attempted', 'will', 'continue', 'attempt', 'work', 'so', 'important', 'universally', 'beloved.So', 'what', 'exactly', 'problem', 'Whedon', '8217', '8216', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', '8217', 'Well', 'starters', 'acting', 'serious', 'sore', 'point', 'will', 'admit', 'never', 'followed', 'Whedon', '8217', 'television', 'career', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'actors', 'do', 'understand', 'following', 'actors', 'are', 'regulars', 'mostly', 'work', 'fans', 'were', 'delighted', 'see', 'get', 'roles', 'here', 'was', 'passion', 'project', 'Whedon', 'as', 'well', 'admire', 'filmed', 'whole', 'thing', 'own', 'home', 'think', 'also', 'major', 'issue', 'nature', 'film', 'felt', 'very', '8216', 'student', 'rehearsing', '8217', 'whole', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'amateur', 'line', 'readings', 'were', 'awkward', 'majority', 'staging', 'even', 'modern', 'adapting', 'scenarios', 'was', 'intriguing', 'definitely', 'eye', 'catching', 'delivery', 'felt', 'off', 'kilter.Alexis', 'Denisof', 'especially', 'unfortunate', 'major', 'role', 'here.Despite', 'being', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'found', 'attention', 'was', 'never', 'held', 'film', 'mentioned', 'outset', '8217', 'm', 'just', 'not', 'fan', 'story', 'much', 'had', 'higher', 'hopes', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'scattered', 'cluttered', 'ridiculous', 'where', 'initially', 'thought', 'silly', 'nature', '1993', 'version', 'was', 'detractor', '8217', 'beginning', 'think', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'whimsy', 'nature', 'story', 'replaces', 'slow', 'burn', 'void', 'real', 'spark', 'energy', 'almost', 'story', '8217', 'ridiculousness', '8217', 'masked', 'film', '8217', 'tone.Sadly', 'film', 'tone']",N/A

1666703,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00ECR7KX2,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 2]","This production, with virtually no seasoned Shakespeareans among the cast and crew, is the opposite of the Kenneth Branagh 1993 film in virtually every way possible, beginning with the fact that several of the Branagh cast were expert at playing Shakespeare. Branagh's version is in color, this is in black and white. Branagh is done as a period piece, this is done as if it were yesterday. Joss Whedon 's cast is composed of mostly actors who had major roles in his earlier projects. The two leads were costars in Whedon's &#34;Angel&#34; series. Nathan Fillion was the star of Whedon's &#34;Firefly&#34; and &#34;Serendipity&#34; projects. What this generally means is that the leads in this production were weaker than in Branagh's production, which paired Branagh as Benedick with Emma Thompson as Beatrice, an incomparable  match which Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker cannot equal. Reed Diamond, however, is a fair match to Denzel Washington as Don Pedro, especially since he fits so well into the latter day &#34;Mad Men&#34; atmosphere of Whedon's film. Sean Maher outshines Keanu Reeves, because Reeves simply blows his part.The performance I was really anticipating was Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. I was not really unhappy with Michael  Keaton's performance, but his slapstick interpretation simply did not fit into Whedon's time and place. As is true of much of this treatment, Fillion goes in exactly the opposite direction, and underplays the comic part, with almost deadpan delivery.Judging by a performance photographed on the stage of the Globe Theater in London, Whedon stays much closer to Shakespeare's lines, although I did detect some speeches left out, such as the song sung early in Act 1 by the messenger.Shakespeare's language and plots are always so rich that you hardly feel you are missing something if you watch two or three versions of his plays.

Much Ado is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and I've loved everything Joss Whedon has ever written or directed, so it surprised no one that I loved this film. I was a little surprised at how MUCH I loved it though. Even with my high expectations, this movie managed to surpass them. According to the commentaries, several cast members had never done Shakespeare before. It doesn't show, at all. The performances are great. Nathan Fillion supposedly tried to back out, twice, because he was so nervous about his ability to play Shakespeare, but his Dogberry is one of the highlights of the movie. I was shocked when I looked Jillian Morgese (who plays Hero) up on IMDB and discovered her only other credit was as an extra in The Avengers. She certainly doesn't seem like she's new to acting or to film. Whedon's adaptation does a fantastic job of going beyond the text without changing it. Silent moments, sight gags, little bits of facial expression and physicality add new twists and dimensions, or clarify character motivations that are not inherent to the dialogue. For people who have trouble with understanding the language, this is an exceptionally accessible version. I know several people who were hesitant to watch it because of the language and they were able to follow the story and get the jokes without a problem. I've seen a lot of people complain about the black & white, the modern dress, etc. These things were largely budgetary concerns. Personally, I find the obviously low budget nature of the film adds to its charm. The fact that the entire thing was shot in 12 days at Joss Whedon's own house is nothing short of impressive. I also recommend the commentary tracks on the blu ray. One is Joss Whedon, alone, and it's very interesting and informative. In the other, Joss is joined by most of the cast, and that one is harder to follow, with so many people talking and laughing at once, but it's also very funny. It's unlikely, but I dearly hope that Whedon and company produce more cheap Shakespeare adaptations, because this is one of the best movies I've seen in years.",5,Phenomenal,1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,2183,"[""'ll"", 'say', 'up', 'front', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'chance', 'would', ""n't"", 'love', 'movie', 'Much', 'Ado', 'one', 'favorite', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'everything', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'ever', 'written', 'directed', 'surprised', 'one', 'loved', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'how', 'MUCH', 'loved', 'Even', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'managed', 'surpass', 'According', 'commentaries', 'several', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'Shakespeare', ""n't"", 'show', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'supposedly', 'tried', 'back', 'out', 'twice', 'was', 'so', 'nervous', 'ability', 'play', 'Shakespeare', 'Dogberry', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'looked', 'Jillian', 'Morgese', 'who', 'Hero', 'up', 'IMDB', 'discovered', 'only', 'other', 'credit', 'was', 'extra', 'Avengers', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'seem', 'new', 'acting', 'film', 'Whedon', 'adaptation', 'fantastic', 'job', 'going', 'text', 'changing', 'Silent', 'moments', 'sight', 'gags', 'little', 'bits', 'facial', 'expression', 'physicality', 'add', 'new', 'twists', 'dimensions', 'clarify', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'inherent', 'dialogue', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'language', 'exceptionally', 'accessible', 'version', 'know', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'hesitant', 'watch', 'language', 'were', 'able', 'follow', 'story', 'get', 'jokes', 'problem', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'people', 'complain', 'black', 'white', 'modern', 'dress', 'etc', 'things', 'were', 'largely', 'budgetary', 'concerns', 'Personally', 'find', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'nature', 'film', 'charm', 'fact', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'shot', '12', 'days', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'own', 'house', 'nothing', 'short', 'impressive', 'also', 'recommend', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'blu', 'ray', 'One', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'alone', 'very', 'interesting', 'informative', 'other', 'Joss', 'joined', 'most', 'cast', 'one', 'harder', 'follow', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'talking', 'laughing', 'once', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'unlikely', 'dearly', 'hope', 'Whedon', 'company', 'produce', 'more', 'cheap', 'Shakespeare', 'adaptations', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years']",N/A

Nathan Fillion.How could this film NOT be awesome?For those that don't know, Whedon is not only the king of all things geeky (BUFFY, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DOLLHOUSE, SERENITY, CABIN IN THE WOODS and a little film called THE AVENGERS), but he's a tremendous Shakespeare buff. Stories have circulated for years about how he would have cast members of his various shows come to his Santa Monica home, sit around, have dinner and drinks and recite some of Shakespeare's plays. Now, he has essentially brought that idea to film in a ""micro-budgeted"" self-produced digitally-shot black-and-white adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most famous comedies, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. Whedon, not one to shy away from working with his friends, made this film with many of his former cast members of his various shows and films, and it's shot entirely in and around that same Santa Monica home.For those that don't know the play, it is a love story of two couples: there's the love-at-first-sight coupling of Claudio (Kranz, as excellent as he was in both DOLLHOUSE and CABIN IN THE WOODS) and Hero (Jillian Morgese, a talented and beautiful newcomer), and there's the epic battle-of-the-sexes coupling of Benedick (Denisof) and Beatrice (Acker). Much romance and comedy ensues, but the jealous plotting of Don John (Maher) threatens to undo everything. But soon to the rescue comes Dogberry (Fillion), the constable of these parts, who is, as should be noted, an ass.Kenneth Branagh, who has spent most of his directorial career adapting Shakespeare for the screen (HENRY V, HAMLET), did a film adaptation of this back in the early 1990's with something of an all-star cast. There are several similarites but even more differences between Whedon's and Branagh's adaptations, and it's the differences that make or break the film. While the Branagh version had Hollywood heavyweights such as Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton and Branagh himself, this is filled with people who may be popular to their fans but are hardly box-office draws, and there's where this film is, in part, more successful. Whedon casts each actor to their strength as opposed to going for bigger names, and the performances are more robust, more natural, and more absorbing. Whedon's version also forgoes the period trappings, and does everything against a modern backdrop. This is not an unusual method for adapting Shakespeare, but it works better in some ways than Branagh's more sweeping and elegant period piece. Also, this film does some slight gender-swapping for at least one character (turning a male character of Conrade, Don John's co-conspirator and lover, into a female one). This, to me, is a hinderance, mostly because of my personal interpretation of the character of Don John, but it ends with personal opinion.Ultimately, both films are pretty great, but if I had to say which one I enjoyed watching more, it's this one. And while Branagh and Thompson, who played Benedick and Beatrice in their version, are acting gods, I could watch Denisof (perhaps the most underrated actors of the Whedonverse) and Acker (whose character actor status has grown exponentially since her days on ANGEL) play these roles every single day and twice on Sunday. They are an absolute joy to watch together, particularly after their work together on ANGEL, and especially how their characters played out on that program. I don't want to spoil too much for those who haven't yet tasted the amazing show that ANGEL was (my favorite of the Whedonverse programs), but let's just say things could have been better for Denisof and Acker on that show. In fact, every actor brings their A-game. Shining particularly brightly (other than Denisof and Acker) are Gregg as the wise and jovial Leonato, Diamond (another veteran of DOLLHOUSE) as the strong and clever Don Pedro, and Fillion as the blundering and exhuberant Dogberry.This film has more moments of great comedy than most of the other comedies released recently, with maybe the exception of Wright and Pegg's THE WORLD'S END, but the only real minus against this film is Whedon's lack of visual flair. He's always been much more of an actor's director, and with his confident work on SERENITY and THE AVENGERS, it seems like he took more of a point-and-shoot style to this film, but in the end, that's more than enough, because Shakespeare's work is more often about the actors than the director, which might be why it does lack a more substanitive style as to not over-shadow the performances, which range from pretty great to astonishingly great.Whedon's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING may not stand in the same circles as Olivier's HAMLET, or Branagh's HENRY V, or Polanski's (or Welles') MACBETH, but I

He is the host for this weekend in the country that starts the ball rolling.* Nathan Fillion (""Castle"" and ""Firefly"") is Dogberry, Mister Malaprop, ego at full sail, with his adoring assistant echoing his every move.* Sean Maher (""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"") is Don John, the villain of the piece.The 2013 Seattle International Film Festival opening night audience obviously knew their Shakespeare and they REALLY knew their Whedon!

Watch the little responses on each actor's face...even the ones who are just supporting roles in a given scene. They are delightful and add so much to the mood and the meaning.The filming is also wonderful. The camera angles do much to add to the absurdity of some scenes, but I also enjoyed that. This is one of Shakespeare's comedies, after all.In truth, I never have read Much Ado About Nothing before. Perhaps those reviewers who thought this rendition sacreledge knew and loved the original story too well to appreciate a modernized rendition. Granted, there are a number of plot twists that seem rather absurd when set in the modern world. For instance, why in the world is everyone ok to just forgive Claudio? Why would Hero still want to be with a guy who dumped her with such humiliation at the alter without talking things over with her first? I'm unconvinced that in Shakespeare's time such a story twist would have made more sense. However, Shakespearean comedies are all about the farce, and that comes through remarkably well in this movie. It forces you to see how Shakespearean drama would have played in scenes and settings that feel like one's own time, and I loved imagining all the non-elites standing on the floor of the Globe Theater laughing at the silliness of these lords and ladies.One last comment about the language: there are many words fired in rapid succession. I don't think I realized earlier quite how banal and slow-paced most movie/tv dialogue has become. One's wit is hardly challenged or expanded through listening to our entertainment choices today. While this movie may be a challenge for many, it really was worth the effort. I am sure I missed many of the quips, but after awhile, one starts to grasp the meaning without trying to...kind of the way people start to hear past a strong accent after a while and comprehend the meaning.Give this movie a shot, because it is a great example of what entertainment can be when it is also art.",5,Both Entertainment and Art,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,2031,"['was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'masterfully', 'acted', 'Watch', 'little', 'responses', 'actor', 'face', 'even', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'supporting', 'roles', 'given', 'scene', 'are', 'delightful', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'mood', 'meaning.The', 'filming', 'also', 'wonderful', 'camera', 'do', 'much', 'add', 'absurdity', 'scenes', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'comedies', 'all.In', 'truth', 'never', 'have', 'read', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'before', 'Perhaps', 'reviewers', 'who', 'thought', 'rendition', 'sacreledge', 'knew', 'loved', 'original', 'story', 'too', 'well', 'appreciate', 'modernized', 'rendition', 'Granted', 'are', 'number', 'plot', 'twists', 'seem', 'rather', 'absurd', 'when', 'set', 'modern', 'world', 'instance', 'why', 'world', 'everyone', 'ok', 'just', 'forgive', 'Claudio', 'Why', 'would', 'Hero', 'still', 'want', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'dumped', 'such', 'humiliation', 'alter', 'talking', 'things', 'first', ""'m"", 'unconvinced', 'Shakespeare', 'time', 'such', 'story', 'twist', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'However', 'Shakespearean', 'comedies', 'are', 'farce', 'through', 'remarkably', 'well', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'Shakespearean', 'drama', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'scenes', 'settings', 'feel', 'one', 'own', 'time', 'loved', 'imagining', 'non-elites', 'standing', 'floor', 'Globe', 'Theater', 'laughing', 'silliness', 'lords', 'ladies.One', 'last', 'comment', 'language', 'are', 'many', 'words', 'fired', 'rapid', 'succession', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'realized', 'earlier', 'quite', 'how', 'banal', 'slow-paced', 'most', 'movie/tv', 'dialogue', 'become', 'One', 'wit', 'hardly', 'challenged', 'expanded', 'listening', 'entertainment', 'choices', 'today', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'challenge', 'many', 'really', 'was', 'worth', 'effort', 'am', 'sure', 'missed', 'many', 'quips', 'awhile', 'one', 'grasp', 'meaning', 'trying', 'kind', 'way', 'people', 'start', 'hear', 'strong', 'accent', 'while', 'comprehend', 'meaning.Give', 'movie', 'shot', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'entertainment', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'also', 'art']",N/A

1666765,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B00ECR7KX2,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","One of the most popular and most absurd plays written by William Shakespeare is Much Ado About Nothing. The story is whimsical and the characters do quite ridiculous things. Audiences love it because it is full of joy, almost exploding with joy. It's easy to forgive the contrivances of the plot because the humor and the romance is so wonderful. The story follows a troop of men who return from battle to the home of Leonato where love is in the air. Claudio wants to marry Leonato's daughter Hero while Benedick and Beatrice have a &#34;merry war of words&#34; inspires their friends to make them fall in love too. Madcap hilarity ensues with occasional moment of dramatic intensity.Joss Whedon made this film during a two-week break in the middle of making The Avengers. The actors are his friends, mostly from his previous TV shows. The set is his house and backyard. He'd been having friends over for Shakespeare readings for years and years, so it is not such a surprise that they could put something together quickly and still do a good job.The actors are good if not always outstanding. Alexis Denisof (Benedict here; Wesley from Buffy and Angel) might be a little too buffonish at points but nails it in others; Amy Acker (Beatrice; Fred from Angel) does a great job and has natural chemist with Denisof; Nathan Fillion (Dogberry; Mal from Firefly) steals the show. As a fan of Whedon's previous work, it was a little distracting seeing all the different actors popping up. But I got used to it after a while, just like people get used to the Shakespearean language.The black and white photography works well, giving it a style appropriate to the timelessness of the story. The story is ultimately relevant to generation after generation because it touches on truths and experiences that happen all the time because people are, in fact, people.

1666766,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00ECR7KX2,J. Richardson,"[2, 4]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.There's no denying that Shakespeare's influence is slowly fading year after year. For most, his work is simply too difficult to comprehend when majority of readers read for pleasure. However, there are others, like Joss Whedon, who continuously try to keep the legendary poet relevant. I'll admit, before sitting down to watch Much Ado About Nothing, I was unfamiliar with the play. You see, I too find Shakespeare's writing a chore to get through, but I still find myself constantly drawn to his work. His stories always manage to be both grand and unbelievably simple at the same time, which is probably why I have this irrefutable attraction to his plays.As one would guess, Much Ado About Nothing is very similar in that regard. Taking place in Messina, Sicily, the story follows a group of individuals who are surrounded by love, lies, and deception. Claudio (Fran Kranz) and Hero (Jillian Morgese) may seem like the main couple in the beginning, but as the story progresses, a greater emphasis is put on Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice (Amy Acker). Now, as with any Shakespeare story, there are a lot of characters and most, if not all, are important in their own, individual way. Also, there are multiple stories that intertwine to form a much larger narrative. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of absent information which leaves a lot of room for confusion.Therein lies my biggest complaint: Much Ado About Nothing seems tailored to the familiar. Those uninitiated are left to fend for themselves in hopes of gaining the slightest understanding of the story being told. The plot is always advancing, but the viewer is left without any back-story or explanation as to why these things are happening. As if adjusting to the Shakespearean language wasn't difficult enough, I now had to put together the pieces of a puzzle with just a few lines here and there of what ""might"" have happened. Most of my understanding came from assumption and it wasn't until I researched after-the-fact that I actually grasped the story in its entirety.With that said, though, it's hard for me to be too negative because it's just so damn enjoyable. Maybe it's the fact that it was filmed in black and white or maybe it's because of its overwhelming simplicity, but it's such a joy to watch. Even when I only had a minimal understanding of what was going on, I was having the time of my life. The characters, the world they inhabit, and the story that surrounds them is so grounded that you would think you were taking a peak over a neighbor's wall watching these events unfold.It should be noted, though, that I wasn't a fan of Whedon's choice to modernize the setting. The language, mannerisms, and cultural traditions present in the story didn't always mesh well in this modern, suburban area. Another thing I noticed was that these modernizations weren't always consistent. For example, in what I can only assume was a police station, they had these ancient looking surveillance monitors, but they had nice, flat screen computer monitors. Then the interrogation ""room"" wasn't closed off by any walls or two-way mirrors. It was just open space for anyone and everyone to see and hear what was going on. An argument could be made that the setting is a few decades old, but there were two or three iPhone sightings so that couldn't be true. It was really odd.Finally, as a whole I felt the casting was solid. There's a pretty lengthy cast -- and more than a few familiar faces -- so I won't break them down one by one. I will say, though, that they were all consistently good. However, at times, I found that the delivery of their lines sounded a bit sarcastic. Almost to the point where it sounded like they were mocking the source material. Also, there were a handful of instances where a scene felt very... fabricated. Most of these were found in the more emotional sections of the story, so it doesn't wind up bringing the film down too much, but it did break the engagement that was built up from previous scenes.Overall Score: 8.2/10 - While it may have its faults, Much Ado About Nothing is truly a wonderful film. Not only does it tell an engaging story, but it does so in a way that really sticks with you. While I can't comment on how well it relates to the original play, I can say that is a blast to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in Shakespeare.",4,"8.2/10 - Lovely film, but it caters to the familiar.",1381795200,"10 15, 2013",2013,4442,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.There', 'denying', 'Shakespeare', 'influence', 'slowly', 'fading', 'year', 'year', 'most', 'work', 'simply', 'too', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'when', 'majority', 'readers', 'read', 'pleasure', 'However', 'are', 'others', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'who', 'continuously', 'try', 'keep', 'legendary', 'poet', 'relevant', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'sitting', 'down', 'watch', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'play', 'see', 'too', 'find', 'Shakespeare', 'writing', 'chore', 'get', 'still', 'find', 'constantly', 'work', 'stories', 'always', 'manage', 'be', 'grand', 'unbelievably', 'simple', 'same', 'time', 'probably', 'why', 'have', 'irrefutable', 'attraction', 'plays.As', 'one', 'would', 'guess', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'very', 'similar', 'regard', 'Taking', 'place', 'Messina', 'Sicily', 'story', 'group', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'surrounded', 'love', 'deception', 'Claudio', 'Fran', 'Kranz', 'Hero', 'Jillian', 'Morgese', 'may', 'seem', 'main', 'couple', 'beginning', 'story', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'put', 'Benedick', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'Beatrice', 'Amy', 'Acker', 'Now', 'Shakespeare', 'story', 'are', 'lot', 'characters', 'most', 'not', 'are', 'important', 'own', 'individual', 'way', 'Also', 'are', 'multiple', 'stories', 'intertwine', 'form', 'much', 'larger', 'narrative', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'lot', 'absent', 'information', 'lot', 'room', 'confusion.Therein', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'tailored', 'familiar', 'uninitiated', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'hopes', 'gaining', 'slightest', 'understanding', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'plot', 'always', 'advancing', 'viewer', 'left', 'back-story', 'explanation', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'adjusting', 'Shakespearean', 'language', 'was', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'enough', 'now', 'had', 'put', 'together', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'just', 'few', 'lines', 'here', 'there', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'Most', 'understanding', 'came', 'assumption', 'was', ""n't"", 'researched', 'after-the-fact', 'actually', 'grasped', 'story', 'entirety.With', 'said', 'hard', 'be', 'too', 'negative', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'enjoyable', 'Maybe', 'fact', 'was', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'maybe', 'overwhelming', 'simplicity', 'such', 'joy', 'watch', 'Even', 'when', 'only', 'had', 'minimal', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'characters', 'world', 'inhabit', 'story', 'so', 'grounded', 'would', 'think', 'were', 'taking', 'peak', 'neighbor', 'wall', 'watching', 'events', 'unfold.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'though', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Whedon', 'choice', 'modernize', 'setting', 'language', 'mannerisms', 'cultural', 'traditions', 'present', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'mesh', 'well', 'modern', 'suburban', 'area', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'modernizations', 'were', ""n't"", 'always', 'consistent', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'police', 'station', 'had', 'ancient', 'looking', 'surveillance', 'monitors', 'had', 'nice', 'flat', 'screen', 'computer', 'monitors', 'Then', 'interrogation', 'room', 'was', ""n't"", 'closed', 'off', 'walls', 'two-way', 'mirrors', 'was', 'just', 'open', 'space', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'see', 'hear', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'argument', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'setting', 'few', 'decades', 'old', 'were', 'two', 'three', 'iPhone', 'sightings', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'true', 'was', 'really', 'odd.Finally', 'whole', 'felt', 'casting', 'was', 'solid', 'pretty', 'lengthy', 'cast', 'more', 'few', 'familiar', 'wo', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'one', 'one', 'will', 'say', 'though', 'were', 'consistently', 'good', 'However', 'times', 'found', 'delivery', 'lines', 'sounded', 'bit', 'sarcastic', 'Almost', 'point', 'where', 'sounded', 'were', 'mocking', 'source', 'material', 'Also', 'were', 'handful', 'instances', 'where', 'scene', 'felt', 'very', 'fabricated', 'Most', 'were', 'found', 'more', 'emotional', 'sections', 'story', ""n't"", 'wind', 'up', 'bringing', 'film', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'did', 'break', 'engagement', 'was', 'built', 'up', 'previous', 'scenes.Overall', 'Score', '8.2/10', 'may', 'have', 'faults', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'tell', 'engaging', 'story', 'so', 'way', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'how', 'well', 'original', 'play', 'can', 'say', 'blast', 'watch', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'Shakespeare']",N/A

Hewins,"[30, 63]","I enjoyed this well enough and don't regret having seen it - However, I would not recommend this for a home purchase - it will not stand up to repeated viewings. Other reviewers are quick to point out why you should forgive its shortcomings (i.e. it was filmed in 12 days, the actors didn't have time to memorize their lines, etc.) and I'm a little perplexed as to why as a viewer I should be inclined to forgive any film's shortcomings.There are a lot of Whedon apologists who want to see Whedon's attempt at Shakespeare as a validation of him as a serious artist. If you like his work, like it, no excuses required. Personal taste is personal taste and doesn't require outside validation or authorization.Whedon excels at creating a sense of camaraderie between the casts on his shows. That sense of congregation is so strong that it extends itself to the viewer who feels psychologically bonded to the characters he creates. And when his televisions shows have long runs, it is eventually used to keep viewers coming back long after the writers have run out of fresh ideas. Which is why his shows always carry the status of ""cult"" TV shows. The cast on Much Ado About Nothing is like a ""Who's Who"" of Joss Whedon productions and he relies heavily on the bond forged through OTHER shows to pull viewers in. And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I would be most curious to see how someone entirely unfamiliar with his past work reacted to the film.The movie drags for the first third. All the actors are awkward and their dialog is often lame, affected and ineffectual. Then midway the cast hits its stride and the middle of the film chugs along very quickly and becomes mightily entertaining. Nonetheless, the final third bogs down and can't pick itself up. The dramatic movement of Hero ""dying"" of shock and heartbreak simply does not work in this production, and I blame the modern dress - it pulls us too far into a modern world where such an event is simply absurd.I really admired his choice to gender reboot the character of Conrad - it was a brave and effectual choice. Riki Lindhome gave one of the best performances in the assemble. With just a few minor tweaks such as these, most of the striking differences Whedon applies are in the white space of the play. He does a great job of sticking to authentic dialog - where he changes things are within the imagery of the scenes. Some choices were really fun and lively, such as Benedict and Claudio finding themselves as houseguests in a little girl's room - Benedict's dialog sitting next to a doll house with Ken and Barbie was hysterical, or Fillion as Dogberry locking himself out of his car, etc.  However, some of it is unnecessary and by interjection assumes the viewer isn't very smart. Inter splicing Beatrice's explanation of her and Benedict's discord with scenes of some distant time when they had made love was, in my opinion, going too far.As long as the play was updated with modern dress, cell phones, and Ipods, I found the entire lack of racial diversity among the main cast to be in especially poor taste. Not to mention the complete lack of any mature female actors. But that is no real departure for Whedon's Eurocentric misogynistic tendencies in casting.  The actresses who portrayed Margaret and Ursula looked so similar that I wasn't sure who was who in which scene. And especially in the final third of the film there was a great deal of confusion as to what was going on. Anyone unfamiliar with the play would not be able to suss it out.While not always successful, it's a worthy attempt and worth viewing as far as film versions of the play go, but no where near as successful or brilliantly rendered as Branagh's 1993 version:Much Ado About Nothing(free streaming on amazon prime at the time of this review) or any actual performance at your local theater.",3,To One Thing Constant Never,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,3856,"['enjoyed', 'well', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'seen', 'However', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'home', 'purchase', 'will', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'are', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'why', 'should', 'forgive', 'shortcomings', 'i.e', 'was', 'filmed', '12', 'days', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'memorize', 'lines', 'etc', ""'m"", 'little', 'perplexed', 'why', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'inclined', 'forgive', 'film', 'are', 'lot', 'Whedon', 'apologists', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'Whedon', 'attempt', 'Shakespeare', 'validation', 'serious', 'artist', 'work', 'excuses', 'required', 'Personal', 'taste', 'personal', 'taste', ""n't"", 'require', 'outside', 'validation', 'authorization.Whedon', 'excels', 'creating', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'casts', 'shows', 'sense', 'congregation', 'so', 'strong', 'viewer', 'who', 'psychologically', 'bonded', 'characters', 'when', 'televisions', 'shows', 'have', 'long', 'runs', 'eventually', 'used', 'keep', 'viewers', 'coming', 'back', 'long', 'writers', 'have', 'run', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'Which', 'why', 'shows', 'always', 'carry', 'status', 'cult', 'TV', 'shows', 'cast', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'Who', 'Who', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'productions', 'heavily', 'bond', 'forged', 'OTHER', 'shows', 'pull', 'viewers', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'most', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'entirely', 'unfamiliar', 'past', 'work', 'reacted', 'film.The', 'movie', 'drags', 'first', 'third', 'actors', 'are', 'awkward', 'dialog', 'often', 'lame', 'affected', 'ineffectual', 'Then', 'cast', 'stride', 'middle', 'film', 'chugs', 'very', 'quickly', 'mightily', 'entertaining', 'Nonetheless', 'final', 'third', 'bogs', 'down', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'dramatic', 'movement', 'Hero', 'dying', 'shock', 'heartbreak', 'simply', 'not', 'work', 'production', 'blame', 'modern', 'dress', 'too', 'far', 'modern', 'world', 'where', 'event', 'simply', 'absurd.I', 'really', 'admired', 'choice', 'gender', 'reboot', 'character', 'Conrad', 'was', 'brave', 'effectual', 'choice', 'Riki', 'Lindhome', 'gave', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'assemble', 'just', 'few', 'minor', 'tweaks', 'such', 'most', 'striking', 'differences', 'Whedon', 'applies', 'are', 'white', 'space', 'play', 'great', 'job', 'sticking', 'authentic', 'dialog', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'imagery', 'scenes', 'choices', 'were', 'really', 'fun', 'lively', 'such', 'Benedict', 'Claudio', 'finding', 'houseguests', 'little', 'girl', 'room', 'Benedict', 'dialog', 'sitting', 'next', 'doll', 'house', 'Ken', 'Barbie', 'was', 'hysterical', 'Fillion', 'Dogberry', 'locking', 'car', 'etc', 'However', 'unnecessary', 'interjection', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'very', 'smart', 'Inter', 'splicing', 'Beatrice', 'explanation', 'Benedict', 'discord', 'scenes', 'distant', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'made', 'love', 'was', 'opinion', 'going', 'too', 'far.As', 'long', 'play', 'was', 'updated', 'modern', 'dress', 'cell', 'phones', 'Ipods', 'found', 'entire', 'lack', 'racial', 'diversity', 'main', 'cast', 'be', 'especially', 'poor', 'taste', 'Not', 'mention', 'complete', 'lack', 'mature', 'female', 'actors', 'real', 'departure', 'Whedon', 'Eurocentric', 'misogynistic', 'tendencies', 'casting', 'actresses', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Margaret', 'Ursula', 'looked', 'so', 'similar', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'who', 'was', 'who', 'scene', 'especially', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'confusion', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'play', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'suss', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'worthy', 'attempt', 'worth', 'viewing', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'versions', 'play', 'go', 'where', 'near', 'successful', 'brilliantly', 'rendered', 'Branagh', '1993', 'version', 'Much', 'Ado', 'Nothing', 'free', 'streaming', 'amazon', 'prime', 'time', 'review', 'actual', 'performance', 'local', 'theater']",N/A

While it was novel to see many Whedonverse actors in this production, many of them came across as though they were simply reciting lines and had little to no idea what they were saying.  Clark Gregg as Leonato was impressive, but too many of the others were flat and monotone.  I was excited to see Amy Acker cast as Beatrice only to be disappointed by a listless performance.  She came to life briefly during her ""were I a man"" speech, but was otherwise dull and lifeless.  I was surprised at the lack of chemistry between Acker and Denisof (seriously, how could Wesley and Fred have NO chemistry?), but there was nary a spark between the two.  Sean Maher (who I normally adore) does not seem to realize that playing a villain requires more than grimacing while reciting his lines.  Fillion, though amusing for the most part, seemed stiff and uncomfortable.  Too many members of the cast reminded me of my students reading their lines in class when we study Shakespeare.I had no problem with the modern setting.  I recently viewed a production of Much Ado staged in a modern setting, using original Shakespearean text starring David Tennant and Catherine Tate as Benedick and Beatrice that was wildly entertaining.  This play could be performed on an empty stage with minimal props and be wonderful if the actors are comfortable with their roles and the dialog.  Unfortunately, that was not the case here.  The Whedon's have a lovely home, but it did not make up for the obvious discomfort of the cast with the text.I applaud Whedon for his love of Shakespeare and the fact that he gathers friends and family together to read and workshop various works of the Bard.

Branagh's version, to be sure, may have Roger Lanser's glorious color cinematography of a sumptuous Tuscan villa, as well as magnificent performances by Emma Thompson and Branagh as Beatrice and Benedick. But Whedon's version, though slightly claustrophobic, feels more unified than Branagh's, and Whedon's ensemble cast is more consistently excellent than Branagh's.Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof may not be as golden-throated in speaking the Bard's verse as Thompson and Branagh, but they are just as adept in portraying Beatrice and Benedick's emotions, and they are the superior physical comedians. In fact, Whedon's cast is wonderful straight down the line: Reed Diamond as Don Pedro, Clark Gregg ss Leonato, and especially Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Fillion's masterful underplaying, taking full advantage of every malaprop, is better than Michael Keaton's heavily Beetlejuiced portrayal in Branagh's film. Also, Sean Maher is incomparably better as the treacherous Don John than Keanu Reeves, who looked perfect but sounded like he was coming out of anesthesia.The B&W; photography in Whedon's film creates its own cool, jazz-tinged magic, an enormous contrast to the occasionally forced hilarity in Branagh's version.

Part of what makes Shakespeare difficult is that to perform it you must have a keen understanding of it, and many actors struggle to really inhabit the meaning rather than simply recite the lines. To inhabit while mastering a complicated comedic timing and beat-for-beat sparring match with the other actors? I have nothing but respect for anyone able to play Beatrice and Benedick well.On that note, Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof have phenomenal chemistry. The black and white lends the film a noir-ish feel that matches the cagey humor, and Nathan Fillion and Tom Lenk are crazy-cool as the cops that get it right by accident. The girl who plays Hero has a beautiful dignity that made me want to cry during the (first) wedding scene. Amy Acker's performance of the &#34;If I were a man&#34; speech is heart-rending, and for a play supposedly about nothing, the combined weight of a woman's honor and a man's pride have a very real presence throughout.

Director Joss Whedon taking a 12 day break from the still to be concluded ""The Avengers,"" gathers some of his old gang and sets up shop in his house to deliver this popular romantic comedy.For those new to this language, it will definitely seem odd and take a while to get used to.  Especially when adapted to current times.  Shot in beautiful black and white, the story centers around a couple love stories.  One of the oddities in the play is that people fall in love quickly and want to get married even quicker.  Single parent Leonato (Clark Gregg) has only a virginal daughter, Hero (Jillian Morgese) but also acts as a father figure for his niece Beatrice (Amy Acker) who has certainly seen her share of amorous activity.  Both attractive ladies would seem to be prime marriage material for family and friends of nobleman Don Pedro (Reed Diamond).Kinsman Claudio (Fran Kranz) quickly falls for Hero.  Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice bicker at each other constantly, but underneath there is an obvious attraction.  The houseguests and the occupants play some trickery to get the couples together.  It works.  Hero and Claudio are set to be married the next day.Throwing a monkey wrench into the plans, is Don Pedro's disgraced brother, Don John who is in tow with a couple of his friends.  Don John decides to play an evil trick on everyone by having one of his buddies have sex with one of the maids who would be disguised as Hero.  He would then lure Claudio and Don Pedro outside to view the couple copulating by an exposed window.An inept constable, Dogberry (Nathan Fillion) and a pair of bumbling deputies come to the rescue having overheard the plot after it took place.  The film's pacing is quick enough to make you forget the disconnect between the centuries of origin and present day.

1666805,A3MR82ZDTWBIAM,B00ECR7KX2,Mostly Shakespeare,"[11, 13]","David Bevington has noted that the three great romantic comedies of 1599, Much Ado, What You Will(or Twelfth Night) and As You Like It, all have titles which suggest a certain off-handedness. In his greatest comedies as nowhere else Shakespeare seems to enjoy his gifts and declines to take himself too seriously. Accordingly it was very much in the spirit of things when Whedon decided to gather with friends and frequent collaborators to shoot a film of Much Ado in his home, in two weeks for as little money as possible. The result is an airy, charming, whisp of a film which gives pleasure every second it occipies the screen.Taking place in Whedon's modern home, where characters gather over wine in the kitchen or in the garden, proceedings take on a domestic feeling in which even the larger scenes feel relatively intimate. The masque, for instance, becomes a kind of casual dinner party which fashionable people might attend. The Duke's visit feels like a meeting between friends, nothing to do with affairs of state. In Whedon's hands Shakespeare's nobles become leisured bourgoisie and the more political aspects of the play are often downplayed while the focus goes to the personal relationships between the characters. The lighting and black and white cinematography are understated and excellent.The leads are uniformly strong but there are no revelations. Whedon has encouraged broad, physical acting, with a good deal of physical comedy. Often he keeps his actors moving; Benedick jogs athrough the garden or chases Beatrice down the stairs; Beatrice shuffles accross the room on hands and feet to escape detection as she eavesdrops. In this way Whedon maintains a certain rhythm and level of energy but it at times overwhelmes the text. The actors manage the verse well but with relatively few insights into the lines. Whedon's boldest and most successful decision was to change Conrad's gender. She and Don John engage in uncommitted and meaningless sexsuality which colors their scheme to ruin the pure love of Claudio and Hero. For Whedon they stand with many other of Shakespeare's characters (notably Iago and Lucio) who jealously wish to drag those around them into their own degraded view of love and sex. This dynamic proves incredibly compelling and insightful. Just as successful is Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Overstuffed into a badly fitted suit and obnoxiously proud of his modest authority, he will become that security gaurd you hated at that building you worked-at/lived-in while at the same time remaining likable through his obvious earnestness. His brilliant understatemnt and timing find every laugh.While the cast and director do not find depths of the barely averted tragedy or the lyrical hights of the characters unearned forgiveness and reconcilement, it remains full of good feeling and some genuine insight. Given the dearth of adaptatons of Shakespeare's comedies, this is more than enough reason to treasure it.",4,A very charming adaptation,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2957,"['David', 'Bevington', 'noted', 'three', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedies', '1599', 'Much', 'Ado', 'What', 'Will', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'have', 'titles', 'suggest', 'certain', 'off-handedness', 'greatest', 'comedies', 'nowhere', 'else', 'Shakespeare', 'enjoy', 'gifts', 'declines', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'Accordingly', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'spirit', 'things', 'when', 'Whedon', 'decided', 'gather', 'friends', 'frequent', 'collaborators', 'shoot', 'film', 'Much', 'Ado', 'home', 'two', 'weeks', 'as', 'little', 'money', 'possible', 'result', 'airy', 'charming', 'whisp', 'film', 'pleasure', 'second', 'screen.Taking', 'place', 'Whedon', 'modern', 'home', 'where', 'characters', 'gather', 'wine', 'kitchen', 'garden', 'proceedings', 'take', 'domestic', 'feeling', 'even', 'larger', 'scenes', 'feel', 'relatively', 'intimate', 'masque', 'instance', 'kind', 'casual', 'dinner', 'party', 'fashionable', 'people', 'might', 'attend', 'Duke', 'visit', 'feels', 'meeting', 'friends', 'nothing', 'do', 'affairs', 'state', 'Whedon', 'hands', 'Shakespeare', 'nobles', 'become', 'leisured', 'bourgoisie', 'more', 'political', 'aspects', 'play', 'are', 'often', 'downplayed', 'focus', 'personal', 'relationships', 'characters', 'lighting', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'are', 'understated', 'excellent.The', 'leads', 'are', 'uniformly', 'strong', 'are', 'revelations', 'Whedon', 'encouraged', 'broad', 'physical', 'acting', 'good', 'deal', 'physical', 'comedy', 'actors', 'moving', 'Benedick', 'jogs', 'garden', 'Beatrice', 'down', 'stairs', 'Beatrice', 'room', 'hands', 'feet', 'escape', 'detection', 'way', 'Whedon', 'certain', 'rhythm', 'level', 'energy', 'times', 'overwhelmes', 'text', 'actors', 'manage', 'verse', 'well', 'relatively', 'few', 'insights', 'lines', 'Whedon', 'boldest', 'most', 'successful', 'decision', 'was', 'change', 'Conrad', 'gender', 'Don', 'John', 'engage', 'uncommitted', 'meaningless', 'sexsuality', 'colors', 'scheme', 'ruin', 'pure', 'love', 'Claudio', 'Hero', 'Whedon', 'stand', 'many', 'other', 'Shakespeare', 'characters', 'notably', 'Iago', 'Lucio', 'who', 'jealously', 'wish', 'drag', 'own', 'degraded', 'view', 'love', 'sex', 'dynamic', 'incredibly', 'compelling', 'insightful', 'Just', 'successful', 'Nathan', 'Fillion', 'Dogberry', 'Overstuffed', 'badly', 'fitted', 'suit', 'obnoxiously', 'proud', 'modest', 'authority', 'will', 'become', 'security', 'gaurd', 'hated', 'building', 'worked-at/lived-in', 'same', 'time', 'remaining', 'likable', 'obvious', 'earnestness', 'brilliant', 'understatemnt', 'timing', 'find', 'laugh.While', 'cast', 'director', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'depths', 'barely', 'averted', 'tragedy', 'lyrical', 'hights', 'characters', 'unearned', 'forgiveness', 'reconcilement', 'full', 'good', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'insight', 'Given', 'dearth', 'adaptatons', 'Shakespeare', 'comedies', 'more', 'enough', 'reason', 'treasure']",N/A

It does not matter how well it is done and how well performed, Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8220;magic&#8221; is gone. It does not mean that the movie is not interesting, enjoyable, or entertaining.Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were structured in such a way, that they apply to our current situations, and they do not need to be adapted. In their original set-ups their &#8220;magic&#8221; is more adequate to our present situations than it was at the time of their original releases. Our thinking patterns have changed and our understanding has been enlarged. Now our minds are capable of digesting evolutionary concepts that were too abstract to be comprehended some 400 years ago. These various concepts are encompassed within the plays&#8217; inner content. But the plays lose their inner dimension when the original set-ups are not respected. The same applies to filling-in seemingly gaps in the plays&#8217; plots. The gaps are intentionally introduced to force our mind to look for answers. But to find the answers, one has to break away from ordinary, i.e., linear thinking pattern. This is why, for example, having Beatrice and Benedick in bed prior to the opening scene of &#8220;Much Ado About Nothing&#8221; trivializes their relationship and the entire play. Shakespeare left several clues that allow the audience to figure out the true nature of Beatrice&#8217;s and Benedick&#8217;s previous encounter. The same applies to cutting off Dogdberry&#8217;s crucial line in his briefing of the watchmen.

Really . . . it's not a huge problem any more, provided the language is naturally spoken.  Joss Whedon's cast does it very well, and this version of the play is as funny as and maybe even more moving than the famous Branagh version.  It's superior in two regards: Sean Maher is a much better Don John than Keanu Reeves, and the whole Dogberry part of the action is simply hilariously done and very economically integrated with the action, with Nathan Fillion outstanding.  In fact, the narrative drive all through is absolutely clear.  The decision to shoot in black and white indeed captures the ""noir"" undertone of the story and looks beautiful too.  And the house in which the action was filmed in twelve days turns out to be wonderfully apt in something of the same way as Branagh's Tuscan villa, with its arches, hiding places, and passages.These actors were not known to me -- I understand that they are quite well known for TV work and from some of Whedon's other films.  They are splendid, and they seemed to be having a great time doing this play.

1666829,A9CDIRPQQ8HN,B00ECR7KX2,Stephen J. Dent,"[7, 8]","This rendition of &#34;Much Ado&#34; seems to be hastily thrown together with very ado to some pretty basic elements to the story.  ***Warning, some spoilers***The play is set in Joss Whedon's house and it doesn't really deviate at all from this locale.  Whedon was able to get the place on the cheap...it being his... and only had the minor setback of having the police called on him one day of shooting when the block was cordoned off so that we wouldn't see cars going by.  Added to the extreme headaches of the filming, Whedon also explained in the screenplay book that I purchased that construction was going on in the house next door.  This also caused some issues with when they filmed.Sigh.One of the basic elements of &#34;Much Ado&#34; is that it is funny.  Tremendously so.  It is one of my favorite Shakespearean plays.  This rendition is not funny at all.  I am hard pressed to really find much to laugh at throughout the play.  Even the hilarious scene with Dogberry and Verges is slapped with a wet noodle.  Those parts are written so well, however, that I had to smile at the lines...albeit the performances that fell flat.  For me, Nathan Fillion's Dogberry is the highlight of an otherwise dim attempt at Shakespeare.Hardly a Shakespeare traditionalist snob, I will say that overall, I am never too enamored with modern day interpretations.  But this one simply makes no sense.  The modern day here is essentially that the men walk around in suits and ties throughout the play.  They decide to stay for a month at this suburban house with Leonato...for who knows what reason.  They are all packing pistols.  For who knows what reason.  They came back from...war?  Doesn't really say that.  They are the finest dressed soldiers one has ever seen and none of them seem to be so worn from battle fatigue that they would need a month to hole up in some suburban chalet, but I digress.The modern day element of showing up in a car with guns and suits makes a number of lines problematic:&#34;I wish my horse had the speed of your tongue&#34; - no horse.&#34;By my sword Beatrice, I love thee&#34; - no sword, he has a glockThe opening scene of the play is a feeble and failed attempt by Joss Whedon to &#34;modernize&#34; the play.  He shows a couple in bed.  The man arises and puts on his clothes and goes to the door.  The naked woman lies on her side, awake but playing as if she is still asleep.  An overly dramatic pause at the door, a look and the &#34;gentleman&#34; leaves...thus leading me and the audience to horrifyingly discover that this would be Benedick and Beatrice.  Whedon argues that this modern day interpretation seems &#34;entirely valid&#34;.  He as going for the tone of intimacy between the two that they were &#34;meaningful&#34; and &#34;intimate&#34; and &#34;open about their relationship&#34;.  Complete and utter crap in my opinion.  The modern day interpretation is that it is a one night stand and that Benedick is slinking out to get away because he doesn't WANT intimacy!  In the play, the idea is that these two kindred spirits really did love one another but could not commit because they were so much alike.  They were at odds with each other because Beatrice is a strong woman who will never back down to a fight.  The idea that she would simply play possum and fake being asleep whilst her love left forever is ridiculous.Later Whedon, admittedly, casts Riki Lindhome as Conrad, Don John's attendant.  Don John is feeling up Conrad in a make out scene, which just confuses the hell out of me.  Later, when being examined, Joss forgot to take out several lines where Dogberry examines Borrachio and Conrad and he refers to them as &#34;sirs&#34; and to Conrad specifically as &#34;sir&#34;.  Her breasts bely the obvious mistake and it doesn't serve as any kind of comical element in that perhaps Dogberry is such the fool that he can't recognize that she is a female.  Whedon, ever the artist, said that he thought that he liked the idea of getting more women into the play and that, quote, &#34;it's a way to have more sex&#34;.  A modern day genius.This is not a play to be compared to the Kenneth Branagh version of &#34;Much Ado&#34; in any realm other than to serve as a counterpoint to how Shakespeare CAN be done well and how it can be butchered, ruined and slapped on a spit.  To see one after the other is to provide the viewer with the most extreme examples of any two films based on the same script.  It hardly seems fair.  So many actors in Branagh's rendition gave amazing and memorable performances: Emma Thompson as Beatrice was phenomenal.  Michale Keaton as Dogberry was a scream.  Even Denzel Washington acquitted himself quite well, while Branagh was simply amazing.  The only actor noticeably out of place was Keanu Reeves...but even that seemed plausible because he was playing the prince's bastard brother and was shunned by the fleet for this fact....Today we do not begrudge those born out of wedlock.  So this tidbit in Whedon's &#34;Much Ado&#34; is yet another foible in this modern day comedy of errors",1,Lukewarm,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,5084,"['rendition', '34', 'Much', 'Ado', '34', 'be',

His past works I have watched (Buffy, Angel, The Avengers, Dr. Horrible's, Serenity, Firefly) I enjoyed ever so much, and really looked forward to this movie, too.  I have seen modernized renditions of Shakespeare in movies and plays in the past, some wonderful, some just okay, but this, to me, is an embarrassment.  I felt like I was watching a group of actors recite lines and drink excessively throughout!  I am beyond disappointed!  There's no reason this movie should be this bad with such a cast of actors and such a director.  I really like Alexis Denisof and I love Amy Acker.  Denisof's acting in this movie is so bad - his delivery of lines, lack of inflection - it's like he wasn't even trying!  And Acker wasn't much better.  They play the main characters in this movie, and yet, there is absolutely NO chemistry between them!  How is that possible?  They played characters very much in love on the TV series Angel, and there was bookoos of chemistry between them on there!  I can't in all fairness blame the actors, though.  Generally bad acting is a result of bad directing, and it is rampant in this movie!  Honestly, I've never seen such a bad rendition of a Shakespeare play in my life!!  My daughter and I watched this together and were both deeply disappointed!  The next morning, we had to watch Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" to wipe the memory of this travesty from our minds.  If you want to see a really great version of this play, then Branagh's version is it.  In fact, Branagh's version is as close to perfection as one can get!

Why,update him and show how relevant he is.So examples we've seen like Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,McKellen's Richard III,Fiennes's Coriolanus,Branagh's Henry V have shown us what can be done.Are we aiming for `realism'? No.We can get to imaginative truth,say by shooting in black and white.Whedon has got an enviable experience of moulding a company of actors in his Firefly or Buffy TV productions.He's rehearsed with them many times.He filmed MAAN in his home estate,with the great help of his wife's production.Shakespeare `was not for an age,but for all time',but maybe he never wrote as if for eternity,he wrote living dramas to be performed for 1 or 2 years only before he moved onto the next one.If it doesn't live in the present it doesn't live at all.We never fully understand Shakespeare,but we get closer to him by performing his rich tapestries of language, freighted with human emotion.The language is only archaic if its not spoken;familiarity is what we need.Whedon started filming this a week after finishing The Avengers Assemble.Directed on a low budget with a cast of friends and colleagues whom he'd got round to his house for regular readings of Shakespeare.They rehearsed this first.This romance involves a cruel con-trick and a startling murder sub-plot.MAAN anticipates the shift of tone and genre of modern cinema.This modern LA version is set in a gated community of the sparring between Beatrice and Benedict,who hate each other until he's tricked into believing she loves him,she overhears Hero and her maid discussing his love for her.The play is a template for the modern rom-com:hate,followed by shenaningans,then falling in love.Whedon has kept the original verse.Everything is perfectly comprehensible and still funny.We could be watching a US-sitcom.It's refreshing,you can understand all the jokes here.There is a sudden change of mood,when Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio,after her outrage at his treatment of Hero,to prove Benedict's love for her. Magically, Whedon's approach is effortless.He's not in awe of the text,he's known for his wit and wordplay(cf.Buffy).The film is not perfect: we're not really sure what they're doing there;you're never sure of the soldiery/war context(are they corporate bosses/mafia hitmen?).Don John is the villain and fits in with a tale of deception/double-cross in a comedy-noir in this b/w film. He is exposed by the fumbling and incompetent constable, Dogberry(Fillion,great).We don't get a sense of the whole plot as in Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,but this doesn't need to suck up to youth as that did.This is for the 30+ audience.Whedon is good with female characters and crafts a fluent,contemporary story in the large Spanish-style house good for visual twists and physical play with many corners and stairs.Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof are incredible as the barbed pair.Music by Whedon",4,A farewell to arms,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,3336,"['modern', 'world', 'Shakespeare', 'only', 'fit', 'best', 'what', 'there', 'need', 'cut', 'away', 'great', 'seas', 'rhetoric', 'go', 'flow.Get', 'ensemble', 'working', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'ease', 'other', 'working', 'unison', 'productions', 'different', 'material', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'here', 'just', 'film', '10', 'days', 'one', 'setting.What', 'Shakespeare', 'need', 'be', 'realized', 'now', 'be', 'seen', 'mass', 'audience', 'youth', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'otherwise', 'see', 'Why', 'update', 'show', 'how', 'relevant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Luhrmann', 'Romeo+Juliet', 'McKellen', 'Richard', 'III', 'Fiennes', 'Coriolanus', 'Branagh', 'Henry', 'V', 'have', 'shown', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done.Are', 'aiming', 'realism', 'No.We', 'can', 'get', 'imaginative', 'truth', 'say', 'shooting', 'black', 'white.Whedon', 'got', 'enviable', 'experience', 'moulding', 'company', 'actors', 'Firefly', 'Buffy', 'TV', 'productions.He', 'rehearsed', 'many', 'times.He', 'filmed', 'MAAN', 'home', 'estate', 'great', 'help', 'wife', 'production.Shakespeare', 'was', 'not', 'age', 'time', 'maybe', 'never', 'wrote', 'eternity', 'wrote', 'living', 'dramas', 'be', 'performed', '1', '2', 'years', 'only', 'moved', 'next', 'one.If', ""n't"", 'live', 'present', ""n't"", 'live', 'all.We', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'Shakespeare', 'get', 'closer', 'performing', 'rich', 'tapestries', 'language', 'freighted', 'human', 'emotion.The', 'language', 'only', 'archaic', 'not', 'spoken', 'familiarity', 'what', 'need.Whedon', 'started', 'filming', 'week', 'finishing', 'Avengers', 'Assemble.Directed', 'low', 'budget', 'cast', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'whom', ""'d"", 'got', 'round', 'house', 'regular', 'readings', 'Shakespeare.They', 'rehearsed', 'first.This', 'romance', 'cruel', 'con-trick', 'startling', 'murder', 'sub-plot.MAAN', 'shift', 'tone', 'genre', 'modern', 'cinema.This', 'modern', 'LA', 'version', 'set', 'gated', 'community', 'sparring', 'Beatrice', 'Benedict', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'tricked', 'believing', 'Hero', 'maid', 'discussing', 'love', 'her.The', 'play', 'template', 'modern', 'rom-com', 'hate', 'followed', 'shenaningans', 'then', 'falling', 'love.Whedon', 'kept', 'original', 'verse.Everything', 'perfectly', 'comprehensible', 'still', 'funny.We', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'US-sitcom.It', 'refreshing', 'can', 'understand', 'jokes', 'sudden', 'change', 'mood', 'when', 'Beatrice', 'Benedict', 'kill', 'Claudio', 'outrage', 'treatment', 'Hero', 'prove', 'Benedict', 'love', 'Magically', 'Whedon', 'approach', 'not', 'awe', 'text', 'known', 'wit', 'wordplay', 'cf.Buffy', '.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'there', ""'re"", 'never', 'sure', 'soldiery/war', 'context', 'are', 'corporate', 'bosses/mafia', 'hitmen', '.Don', 'John', 'villain', 'fits', 'tale', 'deception/double-cross', 'comedy-noir', 'b/w', 'film', 'exposed', 'fumbling', 'incompetent', 'constable', 'Dogberry', 'Fillion', 'great', '.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'whole', 'plot', 'Luhrmann', 'Romeo+Juliet', ""n't"", 'need', 'suck', 'up', 'youth', 'did.This', '30+', 'audience.Whedon', 'good', 'female', 'characters', 'crafts', 'fluent', 'contemporary', 'story', 'large', 'Spanish-style', 'house', 'good', 'visual', 'twists', 'physical', 'play', 'many', 'corners', 'stairs.Amy', 'Acker', 'Alexis', 'Denisof', 'are', 'incredible', 'barbed', 'pair.Music', 'Whedon']",N/A

True, Buffy did buy him quite the trophy hacienda in Santa Monica--I'm guessing easily way north of $10 mil. Then there's no disputing the extra-brilliant tax write-off to make it a legitimate work expense as the location for his movie. Sure beats the home office deduction.  That Joss, always thinking!It is terribly hospitable of him to show us the kids' bedrooms and theArchitectural Digest-worthy kitchen, the infinity pool, and all, yet the reality remains that none of the flawlessly tasteful decor tells us anything new about Shakespeare's play. If anything, it's just sorta weird when too many of The Bard's lines fall flat and just lie there in the surreal disconnect with the contemporary setting and fashionable wardrobe. All the men's suits, btw, are exceptionally well-tailored.I'm sure Joss had fine intentions and felt really good about making the movie, I mean proving not only how much smarter and better educated he and his pals are than the TV audiences that made him so much money, but also that no mere Hollywood TV hack, he is as serious an artist as, say, any of those snooty Euro auteurs shooting Dogma-style with available light and making the actors do their own make-up. Plus you just can't argue with Shakespeare when it comes to establishing ""real theatre"" credibility and prestige.No doubt Joss & friends all had a perfectly splendid time, the caterers on set served only all organic meals, they had good wine at lunch just like the French and Italians always do on location, etc., etc., but one suspects that you really had to be there to fully appreciate that private party.Ah!

Instead of seventeenth century trappings,this is entirely contemporary - with solemn bodyguards, papparazza-on-staff, and a booziness that brings the Gatsby era to mind.A few details work in surprising ways. A woman takes the role of Conrad, and completely reworks the character in the process. Fillion's Dogberry approaches the level set by Michael Keaton inBranagh'sstar-studded version. And, in touchstone moments, the conversations that Benedick and especially Beatrice ""overhear"" have all the comic quality of any rendering I've seen, and better than many.

The Claudio-Hero story is hopelessly dated, but Beatrice and Benedick are timeless.  Frankly, I never imagined this play in black and white but in the end, this about the chemistry between the leads as they try to transition from rivals to lovers/rivals.  In the end they both surrender to love (with great wit).  It isn't the surrender but the fight along the way that is of interest.An interesting aspect of the film is the director's insertion of two flashback scenes which show an earlier encounter between Beatrice and Benedick.  This reference alludes to a line in the play where Beatrice states that she once lent Benedick her heart and it didn't turn out well.  This was always something left to audience to interpret.  In this version the two scenes, no dialogue, appear to be the pieces of a one night stand, with plenty of drinks and the morning after than a matter of the heart. This places matters which follow as set in bitterness for Beatrice than anything else. Additionally, encounters between Beatrice and Benedick are all about the spoken word.  This aspect of the film doesn't work for me but could for others.  It say much about the durability of the work and the need for it to be redone every so often.The fact that this film was shot in 12 days isn't really remarkable given that the director started with a great script.  Most films do not have this advantage in this day and age.  There is some difficulty in overcoming the American spoken by the leads.I personally prefer the 1993 version, but this version is enjoyable.  The point though is that Shakespeare is very durable. It is worth the time to see more than one version and view it more than once.
