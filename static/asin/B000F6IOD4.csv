983960,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000F6IOD4,A Customer,"[14, 20]","Annapolis is supposed to be a story of the underdog, who rises above the fray to achieve glory, but the movie is riddled with so many clich&eacute;s and rip-offs and features such an absolutely astounding lack of imagination on behalf of the director Justin Lin, that it becomes almost impossible to take any of it seriously. It doesn't help that for much of the time, Annapolis just can't figure out what it wants to be - a picture about boxing or a hard-edged military drama. I rented it for the beefcake  - so go figure.This competently made but rather bland take on An Officer and A Gentleman and Rocky stars James Franco as the melancholy Jake Huard. Jake is a working-class kid who works with his father (Brian Goodman) on the Annapolis shipyards, drinks beers with his buddies at night, but in reality harbors dreams of attending the Naval Academy across the bay.Jake is also an amateur boxer, and his undeniable talent in the ring gets the attention of an officer from the Academy. Soon he's admitted into Annapolis and becomes the nemesis of Tyrese Gibson's ex-Marine midshipman Lt. Cole, the film's titular villain but really just a nice guy at heart. Lt. Cole seems determined to undermine Jake as well as prove he's the superior force in the real life Brigade Championships.The poor Jake - and his ""plebe"" mates - are forced to undergo all kinds of humiliations in order to toughen them up for officer material, he encounters merciless rules, the dogged and resolute brotherhood, and the unsparing superior Lt. Cole, and the film does do a good job of portraying some of the rigors of training. But all too often the film falls into sadistic stereotyping and much of what we see doesn't always come across as true.The eye-catching Jordana Brewster drops in and out of the story as a spunky upperclassman and romantic interest that is attracted to Jake's rugged good looks and rough manners, but likewise, her character isn't that realistic.James Franco is suitably sullen and earnest as Jake, he's reserved and inscrutable at the start, but there's something un-charismatic about him and we never really root for him like we should.Annapolis starts off quite well. There's a gritty, edgy quality to the proceedings and the dynamic between Jake and his father is generally well done. If the movie had concentrated much more on the motivations of their uneasy relationship - his father doesn't believe he will ever make it - the film as a whole would probably have been much more interesting.Lin does inject a little tension into the forcefully integrated cast - particularly during the training sessions and there's some real frenetic energy infused into the fight scenes - there's also lots of muscled eye candy - but the film never manages to find a single surprise in the script or rise above the ordinary. Most viewers will probably end up telegraphing each plot turn as it comes.

983964,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000F6IOD4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","It's like `An Officer and a Gentleman' meets `Antwone Fisher' meets `Rocky', but nowhere near as good as the first two (yes, we all know that I think `Rocky' is an overrated mediocre film).  Yes, there isn't much new to `Annapolis', and sadly it doesn't really handle anything in a way to create anything remotely memorable.  It's a clich&eacute; ridden rip-off film that has a few selected moments that make it enjoyable, but there is nothing here that would warrant any deep-seated affection.The performances run the gamut from poor (Tyrese Gibson) to decent (James Franco) to pretty darn good (Vicellous Reon Shannon), and then you have the barely there performances, like that from the gorgeous (Demi Moore/Jennifer Connelly love child) Jordana Brewster.The film tells of Jake Huard, a young man who dreams of the Navy.  When he finally gets his chance he finds that his stubborn and aggressive nature makes it difficult for him to adapt to life in the academy.  With the help of a beautiful woman, a caring Lieutenant and his own determination, Jake is able to...box?  Yes, that's right; he boxes.  There is a boxing competition open to everyone in the academy, which give Jake the opportunity to exact some pain on Cole, his nemesis and resident jerk.Littered with clich&eacute;s that come one right after the other, `Annapolis' never finds its own footing.  It borrows far too much from far too many other films.  It plays out like a poor mans `An Officer and a Gentleman', with no one able to step up to the plate and deliver something noteworthy.  Vicellous Reon Shannon was my favorite part of the film, even if his character was the biggest clich&eacute; the film had to offer (SPOILER:  the overweight African American who is mistreated, rises above, gets shot back down and attempts to take his own life).  Shannon played the role flawlessly, and I believed in him, connected to him, and absolutely adored him.But aside from that, I'm left empty handed.I will say that the films pacing was brisk and the visuals were a nice touch (especially the fight sequences).  It's a `pretty' movie.With Tyrese playing just another variation of Louis Gossett Jr.'s Oscar winning role (which wasn't deserving of an Oscar in the first place) and James Franco trying to be charming while keeping an edge (which he only manages to accomplish SOME of the time), `Annapolis' falls in the middle.It's not bad but it feels very `been there done that'.",3,A middle of the road clich&eacute; that is easily enjoyed and easily forgotten...,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,2444,"['Officer', 'Gentleman', 'meets', 'Antwone', 'Fisher', 'meets', 'Rocky', 'nowhere', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'yes', 'know', 'think', 'Rocky', 'overrated', 'mediocre', 'film', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'much', 'new', 'Annapolis', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'really', 'handle', 'anything', 'way', 'create', 'anything', 'remotely', 'memorable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ridden', 'rip-off', 'film', 'few', 'selected', 'moments', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'nothing', 'here', 'would', 'warrant', 'deep-seated', 'affection.The', 'performances', 'run', 'gamut', 'poor', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'decent', 'James', 'Franco', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'then', 'have', 'barely', 'performances', 'gorgeous', 'Demi', 'Moore/Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'love', 'child', 'Jordana', 'Brewster.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Jake', 'Huard', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Navy', 'When', 'finally', 'chance', 'stubborn', 'aggressive', 'nature', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'life', 'academy', 'help', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'caring', 'Lieutenant', 'own', 'determination', 'Jake', 'able', 'box', 'Yes', 'right', 'boxing', 'competition', 'open', 'everyone', 'academy', 'give', 'Jake', 'opportunity', 'exact', 'pain', 'Cole', 'nemesis', 'resident', 'jerk.Littered', 'clich', 'eacute', 'come', 'one', 'right', 'other', 'Annapolis', 'never', 'own', 'footing', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'out', 'poor', 'mans', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'one', 'able', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'deliver', 'something', 'noteworthy', 'Vicellous', 'Reon', 'Shannon', 'was', 'favorite', 'part', 'film', 'even', 'character', 'was', 'biggest', 'clich', 'eacute', 'film', 'had', 'offer', 'SPOILER', 'overweight', 'African', 'American', 'who', 'mistreated', 'shot', 'back', 'down', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'Shannon', 'played', 'role', 'flawlessly', 'believed', 'connected', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'him.But', 'aside', ""'m"", 'left', 'empty', 'handed.I', 'will', 'say', 'films', 'pacing', 'was', 'brisk', 'visuals', 'were', 'nice', 'touch', 'especially', 'fight', 'sequences', 'pretty', 'movie.With', 'Tyrese', 'playing', 'just', 'variation', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'deserving', 'Oscar', 'first', 'place', 'James', 'Franco', 'trying', 'be', 'charming', 'keeping', 'edge', 'only', 'accomplish', 'SOME', 'time', 'Annapolis', 'falls', 'middle.It', 'not', 'bad', 'very', 'been', 'there', 'done']",N/A

We learn later that he is recruited largely for his boxing ability...or so it seems.When he arrives he is assigned to a dorm room with three other cadets, and they, of course, each have their own unique personalities and even racial backgrounds.

The problem with Justin Lin's first major studio outing is that the viewer gets a strange sense of deja vu as he or she watches the film.Annapolis is a hybrid crossing of An Officer and a Gentleman meets Rocky. Jake Huard (James Franco)is a blue collar worker who wants to shoe the world that he can make it as a Naval officer by attending Annapolis and breaking free of his shipyard bound friends. Given this chance he tries to do it alone and begins to fall deeper and deeper into failure. With the help of a fellow student and potential love interest(Jordana Brewster) he beins to train for the Brigades the annual boxing tournament. The boxing ring is also Huard's chance to deal with a grudge bearing senior officer.The film tries its best to be completely politically correct and this plus every sports movie cliche in the book tends to hurt the overall film.

First of all it's highly unlikely that they would know how to fight like that and also both the Sergeant and the Officer candidate would be kicked out of the school for hurting each other like that.  In this film, there is fighting but it's believable in that it's in the boxing ring.  When fighting does happen outside of the ring however there are consequences.  Another thing is that people in leadership roles in the military (particularly for special units and schools) will almost never put pressure on a candidate to give up.  If the candidate can't meet the high standards, it's only a matter of time before he will drop out or be dropped.  In this film Tyrese Gibson's character (the company comander) is at odds with James Franco the plebe, but he doesn't go great lengths to try to get him to quit like is done ""An Officer and a Gentleman"".

Unfortunately, this is based on a small, twice-told story rendered in what appears to be a Frankenscript made up from parts of other scripts from feature films superior to it. It's a superficial story at that. It's also obvious that the neither writer nor director served in either the US Navy or the USN Marines Division, nor apparently bothered to hire a knowledgeable consultant for it lacks authenticity and is marred by technical errors. For example, there's a line where Midshipman Cole (well played by the striking Tyrese Gibson) a former Marine that we later learn will return to the Marines after graduating Annapolis refers to himself as a ""soldier."" This is a rather grinding mistake because no Sailor or Marine ever refers to himself as a soldier even while intoxicated and spouting philosophic euphemisms. It just never happens.Perhaps the most glaring error is the entire writing of the ""Twins"" character (once again very well played by Vicellous Reon Shannon) who is an overweight, physically unqualified plebe. In truth the entry examination for Annapolis is done in two parts and one part covers an entire day on physical qualifications that all candidates must pass. Physically unqualified students are never found at the Naval Academy. The part should simply have never been written as it is. The idea itself obviously comes from any number of old boot camp films where it not only happens but where this characterization has long ago become trite.At this writing I do not know why the picture was not made at Annapolis itself but this fact encompasses an entire basket of missed opportunities. If one were to entitle a film ANNAPOLIS the story might have been told similarly to John Ford's THE LONG GRAY LINE (1955) where through the experience of one man we get the emotional impact and historicity of West Point. USNA Annapolis is one of the greatest institutions of the United States, having been officially created in 1850. Its grounds and buildings are stunning when one sees the parades of midshipmen pass in review. There is nothing in this film that comes close to illustrating or in any way demonstrating the glory of the Academy. Boxing, which is the highlight of this unfortunate film is but a small aspect of life there. Yet, the activity eats up the entire conclusion of this film. Better to have named it, ""Rocky's Younger, Midshipman Brother.""There is one small plus side; however, the cast is always engaging and talented so what little is there is salvaged by their performances. If you want see a strong melodrama about the trails and tribulations of a young man's aspirations to become a naval officer, see the original movie.

Most of these movies wind up going Direct-to-DVD, but there are a few that make it to theaters, though not with much box office success. Most of these films are not too well received by movie audiences or critics, but every once in a while one of these run-of-the-mill movies sneaks through and actually offers a few new ideas or perspectives on some old ones that makes the movie rise above average and win over some audiences and maybe even a few critics along the way. One instance of an average movie rising above its Direct-to-DVD destiny would be the military/sports themed movie ""Annapolis"".""Annapolis"" tells the story of Jake Huard (James Franco), a hot-headed shipbuilder's son whose dream is to fulfill his late mother's belief that he could make it in the navy. After gaining acceptance into Annapolis, Jake soon discovers that achieving his goals is going to be much harder than he initially thought, thanks in no small part to his tough-as-nails commanding officer Lt. Coal (Tyrese Gibson), a marine assigned to the school as a new instructor. As Jake struggles to keep his anger against Lt. Coal in check, he soon realizes that the only way to prove to Coal, and all other's who didn't believe in him along the way, is to settle their differences in the ring while participating in the annual boxing matches known as 'The Brigades'.As I said earlier, ""Annapolis"" is a movie where pretty much everything has been done before, but there are a few surprises in the story along the way. As clich&eacute;d as the movie may be, it is still a fairly enjoyable movie, that presents your standard underdog story in a different way by combining a sports movie with a military themed movie. This concept worked very well for the movie, and is a big part of why ""Annapolis"" was better than expected. Sure, I could see where the story was going to end up by the end of the movie, who couldn't; but the way the story was broken up between the standard Naval training and the boxing training, gave a nice mix of drama and action that managed to keep me entertained.The performances in the movie were all fairly solid with some unevenness, a few moments felt strange or out of place, but these were few and far between. James Franco's (""Spiderman 3"") performance seemed the most flat, he didn't really show many emotions, and his facial expressions and voice remained fairly even so determining what his character was feeling proved to not always be easy. When he did choose to show emotion on his face and in his vocal inflections, I thought they seemed a bit forced, a good example of this would be when he yells at his Dad out of nowhere about not being supportive. I generally think James Franco is a solid actor, and he played the part of the stoic hero well, though he should have shown more emotions and varied the tone of his voice, this was definitely not his best work. On the other hand, Tyrese Gibson (""Transformers"") is an actor who was perfect for his role, and his delivery though very even as well, was dead-on for his character. You may be asking why Tyrese's, some would say wooden, performance was accepted and not Franco's. The difference is that Tyrese's character isn't really experiencing an emotional journey, whereas James' character Jake is enduring what to him is a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. In that respect Tyrese nailed the part, where I felt Franco dropped the ball. The supporting cast led by Donnie Wahlberg (""Saw 2""), Chi McBride (""I, Robot""), and Jordana Brewster (""The Fast and the Furious"") were all well suited for their respective characters. Although, I personally felt that Wahlberg's character was underutilized, he just seems to pop-up every once in a while, but when he does he essentially steals the scenes with great ease. Brewster as a trainer and future love interest for Jake was a good choice for showing both the military's acceptance of women in positions of authority, and as the only obvious outlet to squeeze some unneeded love story element into the movie, not to mention the men needed some eye candy to behold. Lastly, Chi McBride had probably the least to do in this movie, even less than Donnie Wahlberg, but he managed to make the best use of his time on the screen.Even though ""Annapolis"" is as by the book of a movie as you can get, it still managed to do a good job of entertaining me, and even educating me in some instances, and that's never a bad thing.

983992,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000F6IOD4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[6, 8]","OK, I had heard ""Annapolis"" was a pale imitation of ""An Officer and a Gentleman""--but I still went into it with an open mind.  Just because a film shares similar plot points or qualities with another film doesn't mean it isn't worthy of a look.  There are only so many plots to go around--take romantic comedies, for example.  If you got rid of those that copied other movies, we'd be left with about six total in the history of cinema.  If something is done well, it can defy its limitations and seem fresh.  Heck, it isn't even as if ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was a novel or new story--it played by fairly conventional storytelling rules, it just did so exceedingly well.So, trying as hard as possible to offer a different perspective--I, too, feel that ""Annapolis"" borrows heavily from ""Officer.""  It's all here.  Boy from wrong side of the tracks makes good in the service--check.  Cadet who can't complete obstacle course helped by hero--check.  Cadet who doesn't succeed attempts suicide--check.  Hero's tension with superior leads up to big fight--check.  Mutual respect, triumph over adversity--check, check, CHECK already.  By jettisoning the romance at the heart of ""Officer,"" ""Annapolis"" is left with only the cliche'--becoming a good person through military service.But even that pales in comparison.  James Franco is a good actor, but he is becoming increasingly expressionless.  It's as if he thinks a dour expression equals seriousness.  Richard Gere (in ""Officer""), meanwhile, ran a real emotional gamut--rage, passion, heartbreak.  He made a very typical story moving and powerful.  But, of course, he had Louis Gossett, in an Oscar winning performance, to play off of.  Let's just say that Tyrese Gibson isn't in that league.  As the female lead, we've got Jordana Brewster.  She is appealing and likable, if not particularly believable in this role.One of my main issues with ""Annapolis"" is its sloppy character development.  Franco is regarded as the worst cadet in the unit, and as such is really ridden by his superiors.  He is a loner, doesn't ask for help--so you know a valuable life lesson will need to be learned.  Gere, in ""Officer,"" was just such a recruit.  But the moment he is broken, the moment of his realization--it is a brilliant and emotionally devastating scene played to perfection.  In ""Annapolis,"" though, blink and you'll miss it--there's no catharsis here.  One night he just decides to be a great recruit.  He then studies all night to improve his scores, trains for boxing all day and night for a big tournament, and helps his roommate on the obstacle course all day.  I don't know when he sleeps or does any real ""soldiering.""""Annapolis"" is, essentially at heart, a chaste and glossy remake.  But lacking the dynamic performances and the realness, it just falls short as entertainment.  No deeper than a typical music video, it's all surface--pretty to look at, but ultimately forgettable.

983993,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000F6IOD4,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[2, 3]","Annapolis takes elements from all of the truly excellent military movies of our time and uses them to create this new and exciting military drama.  James Falco stars as Jake Huard, the hometown boy who boxes, works as a ship builder, and has always dreamed of a life in the navy.  Before his mother died, she made him promise he would attend the naval academy.  Huard spends years trying to make sure that he keeps this promise.  His character has many of the same elements that made us love Richard Gere in An Officer and a Gentleman and Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket. Throughout the film he strives to make the transformation from a guy who dreams of being in the navy to an actual officer through and through. To this end, he attempts to prove himself by trying to win the Naval Academy Brigade boxing competition and proving that he really is good enough to be there.Before his first day at the academy he meets a cute girl (Jordana Brewster) at a bar who turns out to be one of his superior officers at the academy.  Brewster's character supports Jake throughout his attempts to fit in and helps him train for the Naval Academy Brigade boxing matches.  She's got hints of Debra Winger from An Officer and A Gentleman and all the best moves from Demi Moore in A Few Good Men.  Then there's the tragic character who you know is just there to let you know how hard it really is to try to fit in.  Much like Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket, Huard's friend is overweight and works twice as hard as everyone else while constantly being berated about his size by his superior officers.  Tyrese Gibson stars as the Louis Gossett Jr.-like superior officer who grills Huard constantly and wants to make sure that he's the best officer he can be.  And Donnie Wahlberg rounds out the supporting cast as the lieutenant who knew from the start that Huard had greatness in him.This movie steals elements from the best, but doesn't do so as outright copying and instead makes it fit its own elements.  The boxing competition is at the forefront of the film, but it's got enough of the military element to make it a nice mixture for anyone who likes movies like Rocky, Full Metal Jacket and An Officer and a Gentleman.  It's not nearly as good as any of those films, but it's a fun film to watch with plenty of action and excitement.",3,"Steal from the best, and make it your own",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,2336,"['Annapolis', 'elements', 'truly', 'excellent', 'military', 'movies', 'time', 'create', 'new', 'exciting', 'military', 'drama', 'James', 'Falco', 'Jake', 'Huard', 'hometown', 'boy', 'who', 'ship', 'builder', 'always', 'dreamed', 'life', 'navy', 'mother', 'died', 'made', 'promise', 'would', 'attend', 'naval', 'academy', 'Huard', 'years', 'trying', 'make', 'sure', 'promise', 'character', 'many', 'same', 'elements', 'made', 'love', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'Matthew', 'Modine', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'film', 'make', 'transformation', 'guy', 'who', 'being', 'navy', 'actual', 'officer', 'end', 'prove', 'trying', 'win', 'Naval', 'Academy', 'Brigade', 'boxing', 'competition', 'proving', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'there.Before', 'first', 'day', 'academy', 'cute', 'girl', 'Jordana', 'Brewster', 'bar', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'superior', 'officers', 'academy', 'Brewster', 'character', 'supports', 'Jake', 'attempts', 'fit', 'train', 'Naval', 'Academy', 'Brigade', 'boxing', 'matches', 'got', 'hints', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'Officer', 'A', 'Gentleman', 'best', 'moves', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'Then', 'tragic', 'character', 'who', 'know', 'just', 'there', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'really', 'try', 'fit', 'Much', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Huard', 'friend', 'overweight', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'everyone', 'else', 'constantly', 'being', 'berated', 'size', 'superior', 'officers', 'Tyrese', 'Gibson', 'stars', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr.-like', 'superior', 'officer', 'who', 'Huard', 'constantly', 'make', 'sure', 'best', 'officer', 'can', 'be', 'Donnie', 'Wahlberg', 'out', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'knew', 'start', 'Huard', 'had', 'greatness', 'him.This', 'movie', 'steals', 'elements', 'best', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'outright', 'copying', 'instead', 'fit', 'own', 'elements', 'boxing', 'competition', 'forefront', 'film', 'got', 'enough', 'military', 'element', 'make', 'nice', 'mixture', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'Rocky', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'plenty', 'action', 'excitement']",N/A

Annapolis revolves around Jake (James Franco), a ship builder's son with big dreams of being a naval officer.  Naturally, he's the underdog who seeks to come out on top, with Tyrese Gibson providing his superior officer and rival who lets him know that he ""won't make it"".  Throw in an annual boxing tournament and everyone involved, and Annapolis transforms into Rocky in the Navy; only the real loser of the bout turns out being the viewer.  Franco and Gibson are stiff and wooden, the screenplay is cliche ridden, predictable, goes out of it's way to be politically correct and inoffensive, and sometimes just non-sensical (apparently eating candy bars wrapped in Wonder Bread can help one achieve a chisled physique) while the inevitable outcome will surprise no one at all.  Jordana Brewster is here for looks and not much else, and poor Donnie Wahlberg and Chi McBride are two of the very few bright spots in this otherwise boring crowd pleaser.

984007,A16GM9G38VTJMV,B000F6IOD4,RedConOne,"[1, 1]","I was given this movie a while ago. Finally got around to watching it, mainly because Gibson is one of my favorite male actors. I have got to say Gibson nails the roll of the no exceptions Marine who wont take any crap and who sticks to the rules even when over something as small as someone being 4 seconds over a run that determined if they stay or are separated from the Navy.In fact Gibson deserves his own paragraph. His character is truly fantastic and in my opinion is one of those characters who really makes the film. Without his character I'm not sure it would be as good of a film. In the film Cole hints to the fact that he served in combat however never really comes out and says it. Using this as a reason to be a toughest meanest character in the film. Often reminding Huard and the rest of the Company that their mistakes will cost others their lives. Many may consider his character over the top and excessively mean. For example (also referenced above) when Nance couldn't complete the O Course he works all year and at the final test him and the rest who hadn't completed it were told 5min and no retests. Nance's character goes from a guy who couldn't even complete to course to someone who did however his time was 5min 4 seconds, a mere 4 seconds over the time limit and a failure. While Huard (Franco) attempts to talk Cole (Gibson) into overlooking the 4 seconds his pleas are met with deaf ears. That is what sealed Gibson's character for me as a good character while i did like Nance, Cole sticking to the standards and not overlooking it certainly finished off his appearance as no crap Marine and gave me a proud feeling of his character while at the same time a sad feeling for Nance who was walking off alone in clear sadness and shame.At a running time of 117min i thought the movie could've been a little longer. Also i felt that they should've spent more time focusing on the classes and workouts along with the relationships between the characters. However i suppose most would've considered that a dull movie but i felt that the film focused a little too much on boxing and not enough on the other aspects. But i realize that boxing did indeed add suspense to the story (if Huard would defeat Cole).They did do a really good job showing the strong attraction between Huard and Ali there were points where i found myself thinking ""Make a move already"" knowing full well that if he had made a move during his 1st year he would've been kicked out. Then at the end feeling relief that he did in fact get the girl.Overall this is a decent film, yes they focused a little too much on the boxing, yes it could've been a little bit longer, yes they could've developed the relationships among the class better, and yes i felt it was lacking much of what one would assume this film would be about..the training and classes and transition for them from civilians to Officers in the U.S. Navy. So i give it 4/5 stars it does have its clear and present flaws but what earned the film 4 and not 3 stars was Gibson's portrayal of a Marine who demands the best and the relationship between Huard and Ali and how they were able to really make me feel the attraction. Along with how the film made me feel for both sides, to understand why Cole did what he did and at the same time feel bad for Nance who failed.Its a good film, not a great film but its good.

984009,A3KUGUD8Y98CPC,B000F6IOD4,"Robert A. Williams ""political ethnographer""","[23, 29]","Younger fans of Hollywood films will no doubt give this movie the thumbs up.  But for those Hollywood film fans old enough to remember the 1982 film ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" starring Richard Gere, ""Annapolis"" is a poor imitation. ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" told the melodramatic story of Zack Mayo, played by Richard Gere,  whose self-absorption came into harsh conflict with the communitarian values of his drill instructor Emil Foley played by Lou Gossett Jr . The extra-curricular affair between Zack and a local girl served to illuminate his self-interested attitude in which the interests of others were held in little regard.  Only after Mayo's best friend Sid Worley commited suicide over an unhappy romance did Zack come out of his culturally-programmed adolescence and then mature into adulthood.That said, younger audiences will like the melodramatic plot of ""Annapolis"".  James Franco plays Jake Huard, an amateur boxer and shipyard worker who wants to climb the class ladder to become a midshipman.  And this is where Jake Huard parts company with his predecessor Zack Mayo.  Zack Mayo was always officer material, just pre-absorbed with getting ahead and not taking notice that others were trying to get ahead also.  Jake Huard, however, is in search of his estranged father's approval and determines to suffer whatever it takes to become an officer.  Whereas Mayo matured into an officer, Huard remains a self-absorbed boxer in a Navy uniform - although less self-absorbed because he is able to get the monkey off his back and win his father's approval.In a style reminiscent of ""Boom Boom"" Mancini, Huard battered his Congressperson with requests for over 30 days straight in order to secure a letter of recommendation to Annapolis.  Once there, he bunks with the loser Estrada played by Wilmer Calderon, the methodical Loo played by Roger Fan, and the misfit Twins masterfully played by Vicellous Reon Shannon.  Twins and Huard are scorned and ridiculed by the other cadets who view them as misfits.  The resulting chemistry between these two characters is superb, reinforced by Shannon's excellent acting in his portrayal of Twins. Huard continues to break rules and grate nerves until his opportunity for redemption arrives - a boxing showdown with the cadet menace Cole, played by Tyrese Gibson.  The film quickly transforms itself into Rocky versus the Naval Dictator.  Despite the canned character scripts and sea of clich&eacute;s complained of by previous reviewers, the melodrama never sinks with the ship.The so-called romance or lust attraction that develops between Huard and the officer Ali played by Jordana Brewster is pretty far-fetched.  It is true that, in real American life, sometimes -rarely - American teachers fall for students. It happens.

The plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache.  James Franco has good screen presence and he can act, although he is limited.  Tyrese Gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as Franco's antagonist (and blatantly trying to copy the great Louis Gossett Jr.'s Oscar-winning role inAn Officer and a Gentleman).  He simply always looks like he's acting the entire time.  It isn't all his fault either as his character isn't even defined well and his reasons for going after Franco's character lacks sincerity and believability unlike Gossett's role.The direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that isn't sure what it wanted to be, so it tries very hard to be everything.  It wants to be a basic training kind of film a laG.I. Janewhile also trying to be a sports film with its boxing storyline.  It wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built.

By hard work work and a break he gets into the Naval Academy where he is considered an outsider because of his attitude and lack of desire to ask for help, Yes, of course there is a woman, there is always a woman!!!!!!! The Film however is fun. The film does have one shortcoming when he and the company commander do not see eye to eye and the LT always states that he knows what a real officer is and what makes them good! Yet, I don't see that he does. An officer doesn't make it personal and he wouldn;'t allow those who are overweight to stay so. He also doesn't think he is better then every other officer either. Despite this the fiklem is fun, well acted and it was nice to see the personal growth of the cadet and how the uperclasss chief handles her feelings for him and his for her for a year. I have left some out but overall it is a nice romantic, peresonal growth and is realistic in that we do have guys like this in the service alot. I enjoyed it and gave a 5 star",5,In the Navy!!!!,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,1170,"['typical', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'South', 'Philly', 'father', 'job', 'shipyatd', 'where', 'Father', 'Foreman', 'attitude', 'yet', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'hard', 'work', 'work', 'break', 'Naval', 'Academy', 'where', 'considered', 'outsider', 'attitude', 'lack', 'desire', 'ask', 'help', 'Yes', 'course', 'woman', 'always', 'woman', 'Film', 'however', 'fun', 'film', 'have', 'one', 'shortcoming', 'when', 'company', 'commander', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'eye', 'eye', 'LT', 'always', 'what', 'real', 'officer', 'what', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'officer', ""n't"", 'make', 'personal', 'wouldn', 'allow', 'who', 'are', 'overweight', 'stay', 'so', 'also', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'then', 'other', 'officer', 'fiklem', 'fun', 'well', 'acted', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'personal', 'growth', 'cadet', 'how', 'uperclasss', 'chief', 'feelings', 'year', 'have', 'left', 'out', 'overall', 'nice', 'romantic', 'peresonal', 'growth', 'realistic', 'do', 'have', 'guys', 'service', 'alot', 'enjoyed', 'gave', '5', 'star']",N/A
