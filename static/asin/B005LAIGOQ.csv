The main character in these types of stories does some research, finds a body, and gives it a proper burial, only to have the spirit remain at unrest.  Remind you of any other movies???The movie was very slow and featured things moving in front of the camera followed by a loud noise.  No chances taken and very few interesting story elements make this movie run-of-the mill.  The settings were amazing, but don't seem to be fully utilized to make this a really thought-provoking film.Overall, it's just the same thing we've seen before and offers nothing new or exciting.

1464603,A3VAAX926BOJC6,B005LAIGOQ,"Aisling D'Art ""artist and author""","[1, 1]","I hadn't read the book before watching this movie.As an author, I wanted to see how this subject was handled. I was interested in the pacing, the plot twists, the setting, and so on.As a fan of Daniel Radcliffe, I wanted to see how he handled this kind of role.In general, the pacing was slow, exactly as you'd expect from a classic gothic tale. The setting was a visual delight, and I recommend watching the movie with the commentary turned on (after seeing it, start to finish, without the commentary) to get the most from the way the movie was designed and produced.Radcliffe's performance was remarkable.  Large portions of the movie focus on him, alone, in a mundane (but creepy) setting.  He has no dialogue in many (perhaps most) scenes.  Despite that, he's able to convey the emotions of the character, and maintain interest.  Frankly, his performance is so compelling, it's almost hypnotic.Unfortunately, the movie isn't completely worthy of Radcliffe's efforts.One major problem was: the movie didn't convey a solid enough &#34;character in his normal world&#34; foundation at the start of the film.  We're too quickly thrown into his grief. Almost from the start, Radcliffe's character is a haunted man. (No pun intended. ) We see him living his life in the shallow, by-the-numbers manner that many grieving people adopt while they recover from a stunning loss.This film also falters due to some frankly cheesy visual elements.  I won't spoil the movie with details, because I think this IS a movie well worth watching, and owning for the special features included in the DVD.  However, the very last scene was such a cliche, it spoiled much of what had come before.  I couldn't help laughing when I saw it.I feel that the director tried to be all things to all moviegoers.  If he'd remained more faithful to the book, or to a classic &#34;hero's journey&#34; plot, or committed to making this a date-night horror flick, the movie would have been more successful.  Instead, it's part art film, part horror, and it's not full satisfying on either count.I'm reminded of the movie, &#34;The Haunting,&#34; based on Shirley Jackson's novel.  The 1963 version was a classic -- now a little dated -- and inspired Disney's &#34;Haunted Mansion&#34; attraction. However, the 1999 remake tried to be an updated, more socially relevant tale, and it failed badly. Like &#34;The Woman in Black,&#34; it lapsed into cliches at the end.After seeing the movie, &#34;The Woman in Black,&#34; I read the book by Susan Hill. It's a modern classic and follows the well-worn traditions of gothic horror novels.  The tale is slow paced and reflective. The book is also very different from the movie, from start to finish.All in all, I think devoted fans of gothic-style horror will enjoy this film enough to want to own a copy.  Just be sure it includes the special features.And, for authors, this film is a good study of pacing, plotting, and what can make a story compelling, despite other shortcomings.  While part of that is a credit to the director and screenwriter, as well as the movie's visual design, I'd give most of the credit to Daniel Radcliffe. He portrays a man numbed by grief, with surges of frustration and plunges into apathy. It's never a one-note or two-note performance, though it easily could have been.If the producers had committed to making this an artistic, classic gothic tale, and incorporated more of the &#34;hero's journey&#34; structure, this could have become an enduring, five-star, must-see movie.Fans of Daniel Radcliffe will be impressed with the subtleties of his performance. And, it's still a good movie, if you're a fan of gothic tales or horror films.  But, it falls short of being a success for either audience.Get the DVD and make sure to see the movie with the commentary on, to get the most from this. The special features on the DVD make a world of difference. If I were to see just the film itself, this would have been a three-star review, at best.",4,"Not the book, and not perfect, but compelling",1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,3988,"['had', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'watching', 'movie.As', 'author', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'subject', 'was', 'handled', 'was', 'interested', 'pacing', 'plot', 'twists', 'setting', 'so', 'on.As', 'fan', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'handled', 'kind', 'role.In', 'general', 'pacing', 'was', 'slow', 'exactly', ""'d"", 'expect', 'classic', 'gothic', 'tale', 'setting', 'was', 'visual', 'delight', 'recommend', 'watching', 'movie', 'commentary', 'turned', 'seeing', 'start', 'finish', 'commentary', 'get', 'most', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'produced.Radcliffe', 'performance', 'was', 'remarkable', 'Large', 'portions', 'movie', 'focus', 'alone', 'mundane', 'creepy', 'setting', 'dialogue', 'many', 'perhaps', 'most', 'scenes', 'able', 'convey', 'emotions', 'character', 'maintain', 'interest', 'Frankly', 'performance', 'so', 'compelling', 'almost', 'hypnotic.Unfortunately', 'movie', ""n't"", 'completely', 'worthy', 'Radcliffe', 'efforts.One', 'major', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'convey', 'solid', 'enough', '34', 'character', 'normal', 'world', '34', 'foundation', 'start', 'film', ""'re"", 'too', 'quickly', 'thrown', 'grief', 'start', 'Radcliffe', 'character', 'haunted', 'man', 'pun', 'intended', 'see', 'living', 'life', 'shallow', 'by-the-numbers', 'manner', 'many', 'grieving', 'people', 'adopt', 'recover', 'stunning', 'loss.This', 'film', 'also', 'falters', 'due', 'frankly', 'cheesy', 'visual', 'elements', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'details', 'think', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'However', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'such', 'cliche', 'spoiled', 'much', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laughing', 'when', 'saw', 'it.I', 'feel', 'director', 'tried', 'be', 'things', 'moviegoers', ""'d"", 'remained', 'more', 'faithful', 'book', 'classic', '34', 'hero', 'journey', '34', 'plot', 'committed', 'making', 'date-night', 'horror', 'flick', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'successful', 'Instead', 'part', 'art', 'film', 'part', 'horror', 'not', 'full', 'satisfying', 'count.I', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'movie', '34', 'Haunting', '34', 'based', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'novel', '1963', 'version', 'was', 'classic', 'now', 'little', 'dated', 'inspired', 'Disney', '34', 'Haunted', 'Mansion', '34', 'attraction', 'However', '1999', 'remake', 'tried', 'be', 'updated', 'more', 'socially', 'relevant', 'tale', 'failed', 'badly', '34', 'Woman', 'Black', '34', 'lapsed', 'cliches', 'end.After', 'seeing', 'movie', '34', 'Woman', 'Black', '34', 'read', 'book', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'modern', 'classic', 'well-worn', 'traditions', 'gothic', 'horror', 'novels', 'tale', 'slow', 'paced', 'reflective', 'book', 'also', 'very', 'different', 'movie', 'start', 'finish.All', 'think', 'devoted', 'fans', 'gothic-style', 'horror', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'enough', 'want', 'own', 'copy', 'Just', 'be', 'sure', 'special', 'features.And', 'authors', 'film', 'good', 'study', 'pacing', 'plotting', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'story', 'compelling', 'other', 'shortcomings', 'part', 'credit', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'visual', 'design', ""'d"", 'give', 'most', 'credit', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'man', 'numbed', 'grief', 'surges', 'frustration', 'plunges', 'apathy', 'never', 'one-note', 'two-note', 'performance', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'been.If', 'producers', 'had', 'committed', 'making', 'artistic', 'classic', 'gothic', 'tale', 'incorporated', 'more', '34', 'hero', 'journey', '34', 'structure', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'enduring', 'five-star', 'must-see', 'movie.Fans', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'subtleties', 'performance', 'still', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'gothic', 'tales', 'horror', 'films', 'short', 'being', 'success', 'DVD', 'make', 'sure', 'see', 'movie', 'commentary', 'get', 'most', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'make', 'world', 'difference', 'were', 'see', 'just', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'three-star', 'review', 'best']",The Woman in Black
1464604,A1R8LZYZR3377O,B005LAIGOQ,ajsteele,"[1, 3]","A was blindsided with brilliance as I watched The Woman In Black. The cover art and title lent itself to a run of the mill ghost story that may be tolerable. And guess what? It is a fairly typical ghost story, but the film is presented with such rich grounding atmosphere and tight acting that the old fashioned haunted house story is revived without loss.The blu- ray disc is solid and takes the viewer into the perfectly replicated misty past of the Old English countryside. I had no problem getting past any Harry Potter shortcomings that viewers may have unfairly dwelled on. This man can act, and he pulled out all the necessary emotions especially holding to an often sullen demeanor.The film digs deep into haunted house history with creaky doors, spooky structures and amplifies it with modern film-making to create the epitome of the traditional haunted house. The ghostly figure of a female evil spirit lurks and she delivers real spine tinglers. Quietness becomes the enemy as the house has a creep fest around every corner.Great evoking of British mannerisms and phraseology abound. The film stresses aura inducing scenery while you wait for the outcome to unfold. It looks like good old Hammer films are making a comeback as the films opening provides the said logo. It's great to see a ghost story, that really is a ghost story.

1464605,A1VBWYIOZQQIDQ,B005LAIGOQ,"Alan Montgomery ""Opera lover""","[34, 42]","Daniel Radcliffe is on screen most of the time in this movie.  He is alone much of the time, too.  The haunted house in question is the quintessentially spooky house that is inaccessable parts of the day or night due to the tide washing over a swamp.  The eerie atmosphere is well kept and Daniel's really good in the film.  As one review said above, how many ways can this kind of scary movie tell the same story?  For those who expect decapitations and lots of gratuitous blood, I'm sorry, but this movie isn't that kind of movie.  Some of the thrill moments are standard, but if, like the other reviewer above, the only thing you're doing is counting the number of them, then you obviously should not be reviewing this movie. The brief glimpses of shadows moving or figures moving past a mirror get to you almost at once. NOthing is scarier than shadows that move.Being indelicate, Daniel Radcliffe's not a tall person, and in this movie that doesn't matter at all.  Still he didn't have to have a love scene with a taller woman or have to out-yell someone who is a foot taller.  It was a wise choice, because now we can just concentrate on the good job he does.  (There are long moments when there is no dialogue, and they don't drag - not for me, anyway.)Is it perfect? No. But it certainly is preferable to me over those slasher movies (in which I lost interest years ago.)  It isn't quite as surprising as ""Sixth Sense"", but the ending was not expected.  My real complaint, not addressed by any others, is that the dialogue in some places is slightly muffled.  I have some hearing problems, but this wasn't in that category.  The dialogue was simply not clear in places, notably Daniel Radcliffe's first conversations with his boss and with the man who eventually helps him (whose son has also died.)  Dan was fine, but the others were muffled, relying on the British mumble to get through.I'm glad I went, and my reservations are minor.

1464622,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B005LAIGOQ,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","London, the turn of the century. Widowed lawyer Arthur Kipps is sent by his office to deal with the legal affairs of Eel Marsh House, whose owners wish to sell it. He finds the local village folk uncooperative and fearful of the house, apart from rich landowner Samuel Daily (who owns the only motorcar in the village). As Kipps investigates the mystery of Eel Marsh House, he learns of a spate of unusual deaths amongst the local children and starts seeing a woman dressed in black watching his activities.The Woman in Black is an adaptation of Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name. It was produced by the resurgent British company Hammer Film Productions, who in an earlier incarnation produced numerous horror films in the 1950s and 1960s. Unlike most of those films, which were noted for their use of blood and gore, The Woman in Black is a taut, claustrophobic piece which relies on tension and things glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.The film's casting is superb, with a post-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe starring as Arthur Kipps (coincidentally, a role previously played by his on-screen father Adrian Rawlins in a 1989 TV movie based on the book). Radcliffe arguably risks more typecasting than any actor in film history, but his canny choice of stage and screen roles has seen him so far avoid that fate. In The Woman in Black he convinces in the role of the world-weary, grief-stricken father whose career as a lawyer is in doubt due to his growing disillusionment with the world. The only other major character is Samuel Daily, played with conviction by the always-excellent Ciaran Hinds.The director, James Watkins, handles the material well. His depictions of a village consumed by fear, the huge and rambling Eel Marsh House and of lonely and windswept marshlands are all excellent, giving the film a real sense of place. Knocking in at just 95 minutes, the film also doesn't outstay its welcome.Unfortunately, the movie shows its hand a little too early. Upon arriving in the village, Kipps is immediately greeted by fear, suspicion and terror, letting the audience know that All is Not Well. It's not long before just about every time we get a close-up on Kipps we also get some sinister stuff going on in the background, or every other time he turns around we get a shot of the Woman in Black hanging about for a moment. The first few times this happens, it's unsettling. Somewhere around the twentieth, it loses its power. Viewers will soon find themselves predicting when something 'scary' is about to happen and will, by and large, be right. The film does succeed in achieving a few genuine shocks despite this issue, the movie's second half is overall weakened by this predictability. Given writer Jane Goldman's solid form (Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class), it's surprising that she doesn't put more genuine twists into the script, especially given its deviations from the source material.The Woman in Black (***) is well-made, excellently-acted, concise, focused and well-directed. The film is let down by its script, which relies a little too much on a single scare tactic and overplays it to the point of boredom. In this manner, The Woman in Black is the film equivalent of the computer game Doom 3: well-made, great in short bursts, but a little dull over the long haul. It is redeemed somewhat by a startling ending, however, and is certainly worth watching.",3,"Excellently made, but the scares become way too predictable.",1344211200,"08 6, 2012",2012,3403,"['London', 'turn', 'century', 'Widowed', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'sent', 'office', 'deal', 'legal', 'affairs', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'owners', 'wish', 'sell', 'local', 'village', 'folk', 'uncooperative', 'fearful', 'house', 'apart', 'rich', 'landowner', 'Samuel', 'Daily', 'who', 'only', 'motorcar', 'village', 'Kipps', 'mystery', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'spate', 'unusual', 'deaths', 'local', 'children', 'seeing', 'woman', 'dressed', 'black', 'watching', 'activities.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'adaptation', 'Susan', 'Hill', '1983', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'produced', 'resurgent', 'British', 'company', 'Hammer', 'Film', 'Productions', 'who', 'earlier', 'incarnation', 'produced', 'numerous', 'horror', 'films', '1950s', '1960s', 'most', 'films', 'were', 'noted', 'use', 'blood', 'gore', 'Woman', 'Black', 'taut', 'claustrophobic', 'piece', 'tension', 'things', 'glimpsed', 'corner', 'eye.The', 'film', 'casting', 'superb', 'post-Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'starring', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'coincidentally', 'role', 'previously', 'played', 'on-screen', 'father', 'Adrian', 'Rawlins', '1989', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Radcliffe', 'arguably', 'more', 'typecasting', 'actor', 'film', 'history', 'canny', 'choice', 'stage', 'screen', 'roles', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'avoid', 'fate', 'Woman', 'Black', 'role', 'world-weary', 'grief-stricken', 'father', 'career', 'lawyer', 'doubt', 'due', 'growing', 'disillusionment', 'world', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'character', 'Samuel', 'Daily', 'played', 'conviction', 'always-excellent', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds.The', 'director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'material', 'well', 'depictions', 'village', 'consumed', 'fear', 'huge', 'rambling', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'lonely', 'windswept', 'marshlands', 'are', 'excellent', 'giving', 'film', 'real', 'sense', 'place', 'Knocking', 'just', '95', 'minutes', 'film', 'also', ""n't"", 'outstay', 'welcome.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'hand', 'little', 'too', 'early', 'arriving', 'village', 'Kipps', 'immediately', 'greeted', 'fear', 'suspicion', 'terror', 'letting', 'audience', 'know', 'Not', 'Well', 'not', 'long', 'before', 'just', 'time', 'get', 'close-up', 'Kipps', 'also', 'get', 'sinister', 'stuff', 'going', 'background', 'other', 'time', 'get', 'shot', 'Woman', 'Black', 'hanging', 'about', 'moment', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'unsettling', 'Somewhere', 'twentieth', 'power', 'Viewers', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'predicting', 'when', 'something', ""'scary"", 'happen', 'will', 'large', 'be', 'right', 'film', 'succeed', 'achieving', 'few', 'genuine', 'shocks', 'issue', 'movie', 'second', 'half', 'overall', 'weakened', 'predictability', 'Given', 'writer', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'solid', 'form', 'Stardust', 'Kick-Ass', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'surprising', ""n't"", 'put', 'more', 'genuine', 'twists', 'script', 'especially', 'given', 'deviations', 'source', 'material.The', 'Woman', 'Black', '***', 'well-made', 'excellently-acted', 'concise', 'focused', 'well-directed', 'film', 'let', 'down', 'script', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'single', 'scare', 'tactic', 'point', 'boredom', 'manner', 'Woman', 'Black', 'film', 'equivalent', 'computer', 'game', 'Doom', '3', 'well-made', 'great', 'short', 'bursts', 'little', 'dull', 'long', 'haul', 'redeemed', 'somewhat', 'startling', 'ending', 'however', 'certainly', 'worth', 'watching']",The Woman in Black

1464626,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005LAIGOQ,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Woman In Black is a disappointing horror/mystery film mainly for reasons that surround the confusing storyline.Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame stars as a man who visits a castle out in the countryside for a few days.  The first thing that surprises me is how much older he's gotten.  Yes he's definitely reached the age appropriate to be a father now, rather shockingly.  Seems just like yesterday Sorcerer's Stone came out and I was enjoying it after high school graduation.Anyway the biggest problem is that, well a combination of two things- weak, overblown writing that makes the entire movie seem artificial and too Hollywood, and despite a solid 15 minutes of actual hauntings *finally* taking place 50 minutes into the movie, overall the Woman in Black just isn't scary or interesting enough.Perhaps Daniel himself starring in a movie like this is the Woman In Black's biggest downfall.  Most of us are familiar with the Harry Potter films and know what kind of magical creativity was used to make those films so rewarding and provide an unbelievable amount of eye candy using all the special effects you can imagine, but here... well, it's almost like it *tries* to recapture the same concept using horror elements but never succeeding in the same way so the movie ends up looking more like a weak imitation.  Also, a storyline that never really gets off the ground until it's too late pretty much holds down all the potential this movie could have had.Had to laugh when Harry walked into a room frightened and jumps when mud comes squirting out of a nearby bathtub.  Come on Harry, you just seen horrific otherworldly monsters- a little bit of mud during uneasy atmospheric conditions shouldn't hold YOU of all people back from proceeding!Oh, about those 15 minutes I mention above that is actually *good*.  This is when Harry, er, Daniel Radcliffe sees a rocking chair rocking by itself, apparitions walking down the hallways, apparitions roaming outside the castle, figures appearing in reflections and mirrors, shadows darting across the room, children lighting themselves on fire, toys making noises by themselves, etc.  This is REALLY excellent stuff however it all goes away due to the movie trying to tell a story involving the death of three children that jump out the window under mysterious circumstances.  I spent more time confused than I did satisfied.The Woman in Black is clearly more appropriate for Harry Potter fans instead of horror lovers.  With that said, it's not bad by any means.  Basically the first half is disappointing and the second half improves in the atmosphere and horror categories, but fails in the storyline for the most part.  I like the ending involving a fast moving train, though.  I know what you're thinking- no, Daniel does *not* fly a car into the world of wizardry with Ron Weasley. :)",3,"oh harry, not your cup of tea",1372291200,"06 27, 2013",2013,2849,"['Woman', 'Black', 'disappointing', 'horror/mystery', 'film', 'mainly', 'reasons', 'surround', 'confusing', 'storyline.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fame', 'man', 'who', 'castle', 'out', 'countryside', 'few', 'days', 'first', 'thing', 'how', 'much', 'older', 'gotten', 'definitely', 'reached', 'age', 'appropriate', 'be', 'father', 'now', 'rather', 'shockingly', 'Seems', 'just', 'yesterday', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'came', 'was', 'enjoying', 'high', 'school', 'graduation.Anyway', 'biggest', 'problem', 'well', 'combination', 'two', 'things-', 'weak', 'overblown', 'writing', 'entire', 'movie', 'seem', 'artificial', 'too', 'Hollywood', 'solid', '15', 'minutes', 'actual', 'hauntings', '*finally*', 'taking', 'place', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Woman', 'Black', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'interesting', 'enough.Perhaps', 'Daniel', 'starring', 'movie', 'Woman', 'Black', 'biggest', 'downfall', 'Most', 'are', 'familiar', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'magical', 'creativity', 'was', 'used', 'make', 'films', 'so', 'rewarding', 'provide', 'unbelievable', 'amount', 'eye', 'candy', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'can', 'imagine', 'here', 'well', 'almost', 'recapture', 'same', 'concept', 'using', 'horror', 'elements', 'never', 'succeeding', 'same', 'way', 'movie', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'weak', 'imitation', 'Also', 'storyline', 'never', 'really', 'ground', 'too', 'late', 'pretty', 'much', 'down', 'potential', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had.Had', 'laugh', 'when', 'Harry', 'walked', 'room', 'frightened', 'jumps', 'when', 'mud', 'squirting', 'nearby', 'bathtub', 'Come', 'Harry', 'just', 'seen', 'horrific', 'otherworldly', 'monsters-', 'little', 'bit', 'mud', 'uneasy', 'atmospheric', 'conditions', 'should', ""n't"", 'hold', 'YOU', 'people', 'back', 'proceeding', 'Oh', '15', 'minutes', 'mention', 'actually', '*good*', 'when', 'Harry', 'er', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'rocking', 'chair', 'rocking', 'apparitions', 'walking', 'down', 'hallways', 'apparitions', 'roaming', 'castle', 'figures', 'appearing', 'reflections', 'mirrors', 'darting', 'room', 'children', 'lighting', 'fire', 'making', 'noises', 'etc', 'REALLY', 'excellent', 'stuff', 'however', 'away', 'due', 'movie', 'trying', 'tell', 'story', 'involving', 'death', 'three', 'children', 'jump', 'out', 'window', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'confused', 'did', 'satisfied.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'clearly', 'more', 'appropriate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'instead', 'horror', 'lovers', 'said', 'not', 'bad', 'means', 'Basically', 'first', 'half', 'disappointing', 'second', 'half', 'atmosphere', 'horror', 'categories', 'storyline', 'most', 'part', 'ending', 'involving', 'fast', 'moving', 'train', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking-', 'Daniel', '*not*', 'fly', 'car', 'world', 'wizardry', 'Ron', 'Weasley']",The Woman in Black
1464627,A1Z98R6UK5T00L,B005LAIGOQ,Ben.W,"[0, 0]","`The Woman in Black' is pretty much a classic ghost story; lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is tasked with travelling to a small, tight-knit community to handle the estate of a wealthy woman who is now deceased. But while it's obvious his presence isn't welcomed, Kipps makes for the woman's isolated house and finds he has to deal with something a lot more sinister than paperwork, and in order to stop anymore innocent lives from being taken - and, perhaps, to save his remaining clean underwear - he needs to face a dark secret that the town is hiding.It maybe a familiar set-up, but `The Woman in Black' is still a well-shot, spooky ride. Director James Watkins pulls out old tricks to scare us, but it works brilliantly as he keeps the whole film in a slow, tense, unnerving atmosphere.

1464631,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B005LAIGOQ,Bitter Bunny,"[3, 4]","When reading my movie review, I'd like you to please consider the perspective of an individual who has seen many films in his life - most especially the horror genre has always fascinated me since I was 7-8 years old. There is nothing like the exhilarating feeling of a good scare whether you are watching a serial killer storyline unfold or a supernatural narrative take place. Having had the rare pleasure, but more often the discontentment, of having viewed many a Horror movie, I have instinctively learned to anticipate the plot of a story or predict the scenes. It isn't only that I've seen so many films with a similar scheme, but rather that there a lot of film studios that are only interested in making a profit and fail to make a good effort at hiring decent screenwriters, cinematographers, directors and so on. After all, it is a business and financing films for a profit is worthy of concern.I'll end this involuntary history lesson by briefly acknowledging the return of Hammer films as producers of The Woman In Black - since the 1930's, Hammer has come to be known as a well-respected institution. Imitation being the highest compliment possible, other film studios began adopting a `Hammer formula' and churned out films like there was no tomorrow, unconsciously causing Hammer to collapse and shut down amidst the sea of Hammer ""wanna be's"". Marking Hammer's return to film from its deep slumber is the gothic supernatural thriller The Woman In Black.I would like to echo what has been already stated about the film - disturbingly moody, palpable environment, eerie soundtrack, etc. but also offer a comparison between The Woman In Black and The Changeling. No, not the Angelina Jolie movie, but the George C. Scott film from 1980. The most striking aspect of these 2 films is the obvious fact that both Radcliffe and Scott play widowers males still grieving over the loss of a loved one. What follows is the collapse of rational thinking through a fractured emotional state of being into the belief of an afterlife and everything that comes with that notion. Both films allow the suspense and scares to build to a crescendo instead of implementing scenes of gore or devices of carnage. Both characters become infatuated, almost to the point of being spellbound, by the mysterious goings-on respectively but whereas Scott is adept at allowing the physical and emotional out pour to connect visually, Radcliffe is only capable at portraying a sense of melancholy. Even at the end of the film, he seems slightly impassive and misses an optimal opportunity to come about full circle with the destiny of his life via his actions.Bottom Line: There is plenty to like about The Woman In Black and if you go into it armed with patience (the action unfolds slow but deliberate), the firm awareness that Radcliffe will not be portraying his trademark wizard boy alter ego, and a firm acceptance that horror can be defined in many varied ways (that includes Justin Bieber's music), then you will be handsomely rewarded with a clever, well fashioned film. Radcliffe has done well and I'm confident he will find his footing in the world before too long, but special note that bears mentioning is Ciar&aacute;n Hinds who is in great form as Radcliffe's new friend in town.",3,Great Scott!!!,1339113600,"06 8, 2012",2012,3278,"['When', 'reading', 'movie', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'please', 'consider', 'perspective', 'individual', 'who', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'life', 'most', 'especially', 'horror', 'genre', 'always', 'fascinated', 'was', '7-8', 'years', 'old', 'nothing', 'exhilarating', 'feeling', 'good', 'scare', 'are', 'watching', 'serial', 'killer', 'storyline', 'unfold', 'supernatural', 'narrative', 'take', 'place', 'Having', 'had', 'rare', 'pleasure', 'more', 'often', 'discontentment', 'having', 'viewed', 'many', 'Horror', 'movie', 'have', 'instinctively', 'learned', 'anticipate', 'plot', 'story', 'predict', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'only', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'similar', 'scheme', 'rather', 'lot', 'film', 'studios', 'are', 'only', 'interested', 'making', 'profit', 'fail', 'make', 'good', 'effort', 'hiring', 'decent', 'screenwriters', 'cinematographers', 'directors', 'so', 'business', 'financing', 'films', 'profit', 'worthy', 'concern.I', ""'ll"", 'end', 'involuntary', 'history', 'lesson', 'briefly', 'acknowledging', 'return', 'Hammer', 'films', 'producers', 'Woman', 'Black', '1930', 'Hammer', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'well-respected', 'institution', 'Imitation', 'being', 'highest', 'compliment', 'possible', 'other', 'film', 'studios', 'began', 'adopting', 'Hammer', 'formula', 'churned', 'out', 'films', 'was', 'tomorrow', 'unconsciously', 'causing', 'Hammer', 'collapse', 'shut', 'down', 'amidst', 'sea', 'Hammer', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'Marking', 'Hammer', 'return', 'film', 'deep', 'slumber', 'gothic', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'Woman', 'Black.I', 'would', 'like', 'echo', 'what', 'been', 'already', 'stated', 'film', 'disturbingly', 'moody', 'palpable', 'environment', 'eerie', 'soundtrack', 'etc', 'also', 'offer', 'comparison', 'Woman', 'Black', 'Changeling', 'No', 'not', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'movie', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'film', '1980', 'most', 'striking', 'aspect', '2', 'films', 'obvious', 'fact', 'Radcliffe', 'Scott', 'play', 'widowers', 'males', 'still', 'grieving', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'What', 'collapse', 'rational', 'thinking', 'fractured', 'emotional', 'state', 'being', 'belief', 'afterlife', 'everything', 'notion', 'films', 'allow', 'suspense', 'scares', 'build', 'crescendo', 'instead', 'implementing', 'scenes', 'gore', 'devices', 'carnage', 'characters', 'become', 'infatuated', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'spellbound', 'mysterious', 'goings-on', 'respectively', 'whereas', 'Scott', 'adept', 'allowing', 'physical', 'emotional', 'out', 'pour', 'connect', 'visually', 'Radcliffe', 'only', 'capable', 'portraying', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'Even', 'end', 'film', 'slightly', 'impassive', 'optimal', 'opportunity', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'destiny', 'life', 'actions.Bottom', 'Line', 'plenty', 'like', 'Woman', 'Black', 'go', 'armed', 'patience', 'action', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'firm', 'awareness', 'Radcliffe', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'portraying', 'trademark', 'wizard', 'boy', 'alter', 'ego', 'firm', 'acceptance', 'horror', 'can', 'be', 'defined', 'many', 'varied', 'ways', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'music', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'handsomely', 'rewarded', 'clever', 'well', 'fashioned', 'film', 'Radcliffe', 'done', 'well', ""'m"", 'confident', 'will', 'find', 'footing', 'world', 'too', 'long', 'special', 'note', 'mentioning', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'who', 'great', 'form', 'Radcliffe', 'new', 'friend', 'town']",The Woman in Black

A lowly young lawyer is sent to prepare the sale of a grand old estate, the Eel Marsh House, but unbeknownst to him, the house carries with it an ominous curse that has been plaguing the children of the small town for years. After settling in, Arthur begins experiencing horrific visions as the ghosts of the past return to haunt him! THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an excellent revival of the Gothic tradition that echoes the works of Jack Clayton and Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar in their retellings of the classic novella, The Turn of the Screw. A constant sense of dread befalls the viewer as we are drowned in mists and shadows. Director James Watkins takes a timely approach to storytelling of his own which pays off entirely, and allows for many long, drawn out sequences to incrementally heighten the tension and suspense as we await the final shock in the end. THE WOMAN IN BLACK also focuses heavily on eerie effects which can be achieved in frame rather than destroying the fantasy through computerized scares. Daniel Radcliffe is amply equipped for the role as the grieving lawyer Arthur Kipps, and plays perfectly in to the Edwardian setting. One can only hope that this will continue to spark more ghostly haunts in the terrifying tradition of the Hammer House of Horror.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",5,The Woman in Black,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1418,"['Hammer', 'Horror', 'returns', 'full', 'force', '2012', 'film', 'adaptation', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'starring', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'A', 'lowly', 'young', 'lawyer', 'sent', 'prepare', 'sale', 'grand', 'old', 'estate', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'unbeknownst', 'house', 'ominous', 'curse', 'been', 'plaguing', 'children', 'small', 'town', 'years', 'settling', 'Arthur', 'experiencing', 'horrific', 'visions', 'ghosts', 'past', 'return', 'haunt', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'excellent', 'revival', 'Gothic', 'tradition', 'works', 'Jack', 'Clayton', 'Alejandro', 'Amen', 'aacute', 'bar', 'retellings', 'classic', 'novella', 'Turn', 'Screw', 'A', 'constant', 'sense', 'dread', 'viewer', 'are', 'drowned', 'mists', 'shadows', 'Director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'timely', 'approach', 'storytelling', 'own', 'entirely', 'many', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'sequences', 'incrementally', 'heighten', 'tension', 'suspense', 'await', 'final', 'shock', 'end', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'also', 'heavily', 'eerie', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'achieved', 'frame', 'rather', 'destroying', 'fantasy', 'computerized', 'scares', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'amply', 'equipped', 'role', 'grieving', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'perfectly', 'Edwardian', 'setting', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'will', 'continue', 'spark', 'more', 'ghostly', 'haunts', 'terrifying', 'tradition', 'Hammer', 'House', 'Horror.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",The Woman in Black

I haven't seen the stage play of it.  This work thus exists in many, many forms and is very popular in almost all of them.This time the movie had a very lavish budget and starred Daniel Radcliffe as the lead. As a solicitor, he is called in to visit a distant village in order to settle an estate.  There he sees a ghost of a woman wearing funereal black. She is furious at everyone because her son drowned on the marsh and no one even bothered to dig up his body.  They are scared to death of her because certain disaster looms every time she makes an appearance. Sure enough disasters start to take place with the first one being a young girl who falls into his arms at the police station because she just drank lye.There is a bit of a rewrite on this version of the film towards the end. It resolves the ghost story more than it has been resolved in any other incarnation.  I am not sure that this is needed or necessary.  It does not ruin it though.It is a very good ghost movie.  It is scary.  The visual effects are great. However, I can't give it the 5 stars I gave the 1989 version.  That version, with a fraction of the budget, scared me so much that I was turning on lights, keeping my dog nearby and such whenever I was alone in the house. This version does not have that kind of horror punch, It seems the scariest movies often are made on a small budget.  Perhaps the lavish special effects make us too aware that it is a movie.Radcliffe does a fine job.  He is a fine young actor but then again he has been since he was a small boy. I think he will do fine now that the Potter films are over and he is no longer Harry Potter to us.

I'd purchased it before the movie came out, but held off because I knew how much of a literary purist I am when it comes to book to film adaptations. So here's a warning: I'm not sure how true this is to the book, but I know enough about the book to know that they did change things here and there. OK, now with that disclaimer, on with the review.I loved this movie, but it helped that I saw it with a good audience. (Sometimes screaming teenagers can really help bring the tension up.) Radcliffe does a pretty good job in this movie. I was a little afraid that I'd spend much of the movie unable to distance him from the character of Harry Potter and also unable to see him as someone who had a kid, but he did pretty well in this and was able to carry the film. (Which he'd have to since a huge bulk of the movie is Radcliffe by himself.)The real gem to the movie are the costumes and surroundings. I hate to say that I was more enchanted with the house and ""island"" that the Woman in Black haunted as well as with the excellent costumes. Someone put a lot of time and thought into these and it shows. Everyone looks fantastic here. If you're a costume or setting fan, you'll undoubtedly love this movie.If you're a horror fan? Well, you'll probably enjoy the film for the gothic atmosphere and the jump scares (ie, the scenes where a ghost jumps out at someone). It's not the greatest gothic horror film ever made, but it's still good enough to where you'll probably walk out of the theater loving it and wanting to see it again at some point in time. The only thing that disappointed me is that I just got the feeling that there could have been a little more to it and that it relied a little overly much on the jump scares to push the tension along. Even the screaming teenagers eventually got a little quiet after a while. They were drawn into the movie but after a while they, just like everyone else in the theater, got somewhat used to the Woman In Black jumping out at people.Overall though, this movie does what it set out to do: entertain. It's incredibly entertaining and I have no doubt that it'll end up getting various fan awards because of it. It's also just enough to push Radcliffe out of his Harry Potter box to where it'll make it more likely that people can see him as someone other than ""that Potter kid"".

Put me in the former category for I love a good ghost story and there are way too few of them these days especially in the movies. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does exactly what it sets out to do, give Daniel Radcliffe an adult post-HARRY POTTER role and craft (that word is key to the proceedings) an old school Victorian style ghost story in the tradition of M. R. James (if you don't know the name, Google him. It will explain a lot).I have never read Susan Hill's book nor been able to jet over to London to see the long running play but I do have the 1989 TV-Movie that was adapted by Nigel Kneale (of QUATERMASS fame) on VHS. That version stars Adrian Rawlings who, ironically, would play Harry Potter's father James in the HP movies. I liked that version very much but have read elsewhere that the author didn't care for it. Apparently there are wholesale changes in that version including giving the characters different names. It was well done for a TV film with one very effective jump-out-of-your-skin moment.Back to this newest incarnation which is a co-production of the recently revived Hammer Films whose earler efforts (THE RESIDENT, WAKE WOOD, LET ME IN) have met with limited success. This WOMAN IN BLACK restores the characters' names and is apparently closer to what the author intended as she has given this version her blessing. However it too has its own share of differences including changing the central character into a widower with a young son and beefing up a character (Janet McTeer) who somehow has a link to the beyond.For those of you unfamiliar with the plot of the film, here it is. Young solicitor Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), whose wife died giving birth, is sent to a remote English village to tidy up the affairs of a recently deceased woman. Once there he is greeted with hostility by the locals and is befriended by the local squire (Ciarin Hinds). Staying in the decaying house that was her home, he is subject to strange sounds and visions that include a woman in mourning and a number of dead children. These are the children of the villagers who are systematically being driven to kill themselves by this woman. After arriving at a solution Kipps hopes to implement it and stop the strange goings on.Director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman have carefully crafted an old school ghost story with all the classic elements. There are sudden sounds, quick cuts, and an effective music score that help to deliver some genuine shocks. There is even a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that runs for half an hour without any dialogue which will either have you on the edge of your seat or will put you to sleep depending on how you respond to it. After you have watched the film, watch it again with Watkins' and Goldman's bonus commentary and you can see exactly how well crafted the film is. The performances by all concerned, not just the principals, are all first rate and this only adds to the overall impact.The one sequence of the film that I didn't like is the ending. I won't give it away but it forgoes the central element of the Victorian ghost story and that is the power of redemption. Once the wrong has been righted, the results should have been different. It is possible to interpret the ending as a thank you gift of sorts but in the commentary the filmmakers state what they intended and it is that which I disagree with. Nevertheless I found THE WOMAN IN BLACK to be top drawer entertainment and I plan to return to it on several occasions. It can take its place along with THE HAUNTING (1963), THE CHANGELING (1979 - George C. Scott not Angelina), and THE OTHERS (2001) as one of the handful of great cinematic ghost story adaptations.",4,WIB Is An Old School Ghost Story Not A Modern Horror Film,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,3861,"['Read', 'various', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', ""'ll"", 'find', 'most', 'part', 'people', 'were', 'either', 'very', 'impressed', 'incredibly', 'bored', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'Put', 'former', 'category', 'love', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'few', 'days', 'especially', 'movies', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'exactly', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'give', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'adult', 'post-HARRY', 'POTTER', 'role', 'craft', 'word', 'key', 'proceedings', 'old', 'school', 'Victorian', 'style', 'ghost', 'story', 'tradition', 'M.', 'R.', 'James', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'Google', 'will', 'explain', 'lot', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'book', 'been', 'able', 'jet', 'London', 'see', 'long', 'running', 'play', 'do', 'have', '1989', 'TV-Movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'Nigel', 'Kneale', 'QUATERMASS', 'fame', 'VHS', 'version', 'Adrian', 'Rawlings', 'who', 'ironically', 'would', 'play', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'father', 'James', 'HP', 'movies', 'liked', 'version', 'very', 'much', 'have', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'author', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Apparently', 'are', 'wholesale', 'changes', 'version', 'including', 'giving', 'characters', 'different', 'names', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'TV', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'effective', 'jump-out-of-your-skin', 'moment.Back', 'newest', 'incarnation', 'co-production', 'recently', 'revived', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'earler', 'efforts', 'RESIDENT', 'WAKE', 'WOOD', 'LET', 'ME', 'IN', 'have', 'met', 'limited', 'success', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'characters', 'names', 'apparently', 'closer', 'what', 'author', 'intended', 'given', 'version', 'blessing', 'However', 'too', 'own', 'share', 'differences', 'including', 'changing', 'central', 'character', 'widower', 'young', 'son', 'beefing', 'up', 'character', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'who', 'somehow', 'link', 'beyond.For', 'unfamiliar', 'plot', 'film', 'here', 'Young', 'solicitor', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'Radcliffe', 'wife', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'sent', 'remote', 'English', 'village', 'tidy', 'up', 'affairs', 'recently', 'deceased', 'woman', 'Once', 'greeted', 'hostility', 'locals', 'befriended', 'local', 'squire', 'Ciarin', 'Hinds', 'Staying', 'decaying', 'house', 'was', 'home', 'subject', 'strange', 'sounds', 'visions', 'include', 'woman', 'mourning', 'number', 'dead', 'children', 'are', 'children', 'villagers', 'who', 'are', 'systematically', 'being', 'driven', 'kill', 'woman', 'arriving', 'solution', 'Kipps', 'implement', 'stop', 'strange', 'goings', 'on.Director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'screenwriter', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'have', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'old', 'school', 'ghost', 'story', 'classic', 'elements', 'are', 'sudden', 'sounds', 'quick', 'cuts', 'effective', 'music', 'score', 'help', 'deliver', 'genuine', 'shocks', 'even', 'lengthy', 'sequence', 'middle', 'film', 'hour', 'dialogue', 'will', 'either', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'will', 'put', 'sleep', 'depending', 'how', 'respond', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'Watkins', 'Goldman', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'can', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'performances', 'concerned', 'not', 'just', 'principals', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'only', 'overall', 'impact.The', 'one', 'sequence', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'central', 'element', 'Victorian', 'ghost', 'story', 'power', 'redemption', 'wrong', 'been', 'righted', 'results', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'possible', 'interpret', 'ending', 'thank', 'gift', 'sorts', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'state', 'what', 'intended', 'disagree', 'Nevertheless', 'found', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'be', 'top', 'drawer', 'entertainment', 'plan', 'return', 'several', 'occasions', 'can', 'take', 'place', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', '1963', 'THE', 'CHANGELING', '1979', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'not', 'Angelina', 'THE', 'OTHERS', '2001', 'one', 'handful', 'great', 'cinematic', 'ghost', 'story', 'adaptations']",The Woman in Black
1464657,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIGOQ,Chris Kennison,"[5, 7]","In ""The Woman in Black"" Daniel Radcliffe, otherwise immortalized as Harry Potter, plays Arthur Kipps, a struggling lawyer, on his last ditch assignment from his law firm to settle the estate of a friendless old widow. He leaves his 4-year old son behind for four days to travel to a remote village called Crythin Gifford, UK. Once there, he finds himself unknowingly walking into a legend and a legacy of tragedy and unexplained events that have had a stranglehold on the village for decades.The first thing to be said about ""The Woman in Black"" and its star, Daniel Radcliffe, is that this was a brilliant move by him as an actor to do something so quickly after the Harry Potter series came to a close, and something so different as well. Never once while watching this movie did I think about Harry Potter. Radcliffe may be one of the few actors who has become so well known for one character that will be able to make the transition into other things.""The Woman in Black"" is a remake of a successful television movie that came out in 1989. It is a ghost story, pure and simple, although, it is not simply described as a ghost story, because there is so much more to it than that. It isn't for the viewer looking for gratuitous violence. Maybe its greatest asset as a movie is its ability to turn ghost story in to mystery, slowly walking you through a haunting situation and revealing the secrets behind the strange happenings a little as a time, just as Arthur Kipps is discovering them.The villagers are opposed to Arthur Kipps visiting the mysterious house across the vast marshlands and Kipps soon finds out why. He is quickly greeted to a mystery and a story that holds the audience in place and never lets up. The movie is never slow and always interesting. Yet at times, some of the things that move the story along can be considered a little hokey, but that placed aside, the mood and delivery are effective.""The Woman in Black"" is a campfire tale and a campfire tale at its finest. It is a successful leap for Radcliffe who is trying to separate himself from being Harry Potter, and it is certainly a movie that will keep your eyes wide open because the things that haunt the mysterious house are not shy.",4,A Nice Ghost Story,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,2218,"['Woman', 'Black', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'otherwise', 'immortalized', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'struggling', 'lawyer', 'last', 'ditch', 'assignment', 'law', 'firm', 'settle', 'estate', 'friendless', 'old', 'widow', '4-year', 'old', 'son', 'four', 'days', 'travel', 'remote', 'village', 'called', 'Crythin', 'Gifford', 'UK', 'Once', 'there', 'unknowingly', 'walking', 'legend', 'legacy', 'tragedy', 'unexplained', 'events', 'have', 'had', 'stranglehold', 'village', 'decades.The', 'first', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'Woman', 'Black', 'star', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'brilliant', 'move', 'actor', 'do', 'something', 'so', 'quickly', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'came', 'close', 'something', 'so', 'different', 'well', 'Never', 'once', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', 'think', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Radcliffe', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'become', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'one', 'character', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'transition', 'other', 'things', 'Woman', 'Black', 'remake', 'successful', 'television', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '1989', 'ghost', 'story', 'pure', 'simple', 'not', 'simply', 'described', 'ghost', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'more', ""n't"", 'viewer', 'looking', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'greatest', 'asset', 'movie', 'ability', 'turn', 'ghost', 'story', 'mystery', 'slowly', 'walking', 'haunting', 'situation', 'revealing', 'secrets', 'strange', 'happenings', 'little', 'time', 'just', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'discovering', 'them.The', 'villagers', 'are', 'opposed', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'visiting', 'mysterious', 'house', 'vast', 'marshlands', 'Kipps', 'soon', 'out', 'why', 'quickly', 'greeted', 'mystery', 'story', 'audience', 'place', 'never', 'up', 'movie', 'never', 'slow', 'always', 'interesting', 'times', 'things', 'move', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'little', 'hokey', 'placed', 'aside', 'mood', 'delivery', 'are', 'effective', 'Woman', 'Black', 'campfire', 'tale', 'campfire', 'tale', 'finest', 'successful', 'leap', 'Radcliffe', 'who', 'trying', 'separate', 'being', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'certainly', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'things', 'haunt', 'mysterious', 'house', 'are', 'not', 'shy']",The Woman in Black

1464662,A18D0R137EYS6C,B005LAIGOQ,Clinton Enlow,"[4, 6]","Forget all the nonsense surrounding this being Daniel Radcliffe's first film outside of the mega franchise that is Harry Potter. Yes Radcliffe is in the movie and does a serviceable job in the role of Arthur Kipps but everything to me exists out of Radcliffe and to speak of him does disservice to the best component of the movie, that being James Watkins the director who creates and excellent amount of suspense over trying to use musical stings or jump scares to hit his audience. This isn't a classic haunted house film like Robert Wise's The Haunting or The Shining but its a fun little film with a flaw holding it back from greatness.I mention Radcliffe only in saying that every actor in the film outside of acting talent which they have seems more to have been cast for their faces. Its odd seeing Radcliffe playing a father sure, but Kipps isn't a character like Jack Torrance. Radcliffe main use in the film is to either appear haunted or scared which He does well. He's joined by the excellent Ciaran Hinds playing a local landowner who doesn't believe all this woman in black nonsense despite having a mentally unstable wife played by Janet Mcteer.The Woman in Black herself is a beautiful creation, a ethereal image that plays like English Freddy Krueger, a vengeful spirit who causes the death of children when she's seen in the town of Crythin Gifford, gathering the spirits of her victims around her as sort of a haunting troupe.As I said the real star of the film is James Watkins not to take anything from the work of the cinematographer or production designer. Watkins does pepper the film with jump scares from the Woman's screech to a bird in a chimney but He also tries the approach of John Carpenter in Halloween with hidden glimpses of the woman over the shoulder of a character or moments of an agitated dog to signal her coming. The film does use sound to create more measured bits of suspense included a bit lifted Susan Hill's novel involving a rocking chair behind a locked room and it works well. Then there's the house on Eel Marsh itself is a beautiful creation in keeping with the period setting of the film, a reclusive decaying mansion surrounded by marshes and a tide that cuts it off from town in order to strand Radcliffe.It all adds up to a really good horror film, one with a dark edge to its action and one worth seeing in theatres to get the experience from the sights and sounds created to drive the suspense. There's just one true negative for me and that's the ending of the movie perhaps put in the film for Radcliffe's star power, or perhaps the result of negative testing. Hopefully not spoiling the end at one point the movie seems to go for a dark ending only to have some bit of happy schmaltz that tries to lighten the mood and doesn't work at all. Watkins previous film Eden Lake contained a twisted bit of glumness in its finale so it feels like something to fit with the fact that the movie has Harry Potter in the lead. Thankfully though for me one minute of blandness didn't kill a great ninety minutes that preceded it.The disc from Sony Pictures doesn't have much in the way of great extras for fans of the film relying on an EPK making of and a bit about Daniel Radcliffe. Susan Hill pops up for a bit in the making of but the best bit bonus is a commentary from Watkins and Jane Goldman. What the disc has going for it is a superb audio visual package that works for the film. As I've said this beautiful looking ghost film where most of what drives the film are the images and the sound. Sure you could make a game out of all the scary sounds that are trotted out but there are other moments like a scene in a bog covered in fog that work well.For fans of gothic horror films and ghost stories this is a recommended disc an excellent highlight for the format.",4,The Woman in Black,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,3821,"['Forget', 'nonsense', 'surrounding', 'being', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'first', 'film', 'mega', 'franchise', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Yes', 'Radcliffe', 'movie', 'serviceable', 'job', 'role', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'everything', 'Radcliffe', 'speak', 'disservice', 'best', 'component', 'movie', 'being', 'James', 'director', 'who', 'excellent', 'amount', 'suspense', 'trying', 'use', 'musical', 'stings', 'jump', 'scares', 'hit', 'audience', ""n't"", 'classic', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'Haunting', 'Shining', 'fun', 'little', 'film', 'flaw', 'holding', 'back', 'greatness.I', 'mention', 'Radcliffe', 'only', 'saying', 'actor', 'film', 'acting', 'talent', 'have', 'more', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'odd', 'seeing', 'Radcliffe', 'playing', 'father', 'sure', 'Kipps', ""n't"", 'character', 'Jack', 'Torrance', 'Radcliffe', 'main', 'use', 'film', 'appear', 'haunted', 'scared', 'well', 'joined', 'excellent', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'playing', 'local', 'landowner', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'woman', 'black', 'nonsense', 'having', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'wife', 'played', 'Janet', 'Mcteer.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'beautiful', 'creation', 'ethereal', 'image', 'English', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'who', 'death', 'children', 'when', 'seen', 'town', 'Crythin', 'Gifford', 'gathering', 'spirits', 'victims', 'around', 'sort', 'haunting', 'troupe.As', 'said', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'James', 'Watkins', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'work', 'cinematographer', 'production', 'designer', 'film', 'jump', 'scares', 'Woman', 'screech', 'bird', 'chimney', 'also', 'approach', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', 'hidden', 'glimpses', 'woman', 'shoulder', 'character', 'moments', 'agitated', 'dog', 'signal', 'coming', 'film', 'use', 'sound', 'create', 'more', 'measured', 'bits', 'suspense', 'included', 'bit', 'lifted', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'novel', 'involving', 'rocking', 'chair', 'locked', 'room', 'well', 'Then', 'house', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'beautiful', 'creation', 'keeping', 'period', 'setting', 'film', 'reclusive', 'decaying', 'mansion', 'surrounded', 'marshes', 'tide', 'off', 'town', 'order', 'strand', 'Radcliffe.It', 'up', 'really', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'dark', 'edge', 'action', 'one', 'worth', 'seeing', 'theatres', 'get', 'experience', 'sights', 'sounds', 'created', 'drive', 'suspense', 'just', 'one', 'true', 'negative', 'ending', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'put', 'film', 'Radcliffe', 'star', 'power', 'perhaps', 'result', 'negative', 'testing', 'Hopefully', 'not', 'spoiling', 'end', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'go', 'dark', 'ending', 'only', 'have', 'bit', 'happy', 'schmaltz', 'lighten', 'mood', ""n't"", 'work', 'previous', 'film', 'Eden', 'Lake', 'contained', 'twisted', 'bit', 'glumness', 'finale', 'something', 'fit', 'fact', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'lead', 'Thankfully', 'one', 'minute', 'blandness', 'did', ""n't"", 'kill', 'great', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'preceded', 'it.The', 'disc', 'Sony', 'Pictures', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'great', 'extras', 'fans', 'film', 'relying', 'EPK', 'making', 'bit', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'up', 'bit', 'making', 'best', 'bit', 'bonus', 'commentary', 'Watkins', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'What', 'disc', 'going', 'superb', 'audio', 'visual', 'package', 'film', ""'ve"", 'said', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'ghost', 'film', 'where', 'most', 'what', 'film', 'are', 'images', 'sound', 'Sure', 'could', 'make', 'game', 'scary', 'sounds', 'are', 'trotted', 'out', 'are', 'other', 'moments', 'scene', 'bog', 'covered', 'fog', 'work', 'well.For', 'fans', 'gothic', 'horror', 'films', 'ghost', 'stories', 'recommended', 'disc', 'excellent', 'highlight', 'format']",The Woman in Black
1464663,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B005LAIGOQ,CryWolf854,"[0, 0]","There's a legend around the seaside town of Crythin Gifford of a woman all dressed in black hiding her face beneath a long black veil.  Whenever someone sees her, somewhere in town, a child dies.When troubled estate attorney Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe of the Harry Potter fame) comes to town to settle the estate of an eccentric client, he has no idea of the hostility the town throws his way.  No one will speak to him except to tell him that it would be wise to leave.  But he is determined to get the job done or else risk losing his job.  While staying at his former client's decrepit mansion cut of from the rest of the world by a marsh, Kipps begins seeing a mysterious woman in black and soon enough, a young girl dies in his arms.  As the sightings of this woman increases, the number of dead children begins to rise and Kipps finds himself in the center of a mystery that has haunted the town over the last forty years; a mystery involving the accidental drowning of a young boy tragically witnessed by the boy's mother whom the townspeople had successfully taken the child from due to their strict moral code simply because he was born out of wedlock.  His mother died in the midst of her grief and that grief turned to revenge.  Now Kipps has three days to uncover the truth behind the legend and bring about a close to the town's curse before his own son becomes the next target for The Woman In Black.The movie itself was energetic enough to keep you interested and really harken back to the late Brittish horror movies of the 60s and 70s.  The score by Marco Beltrami was creepy and helped added some much needed tension that the movie lacked visually.  But there are a fair amount of problems here.  The jump scares are numerous.  And while Radcliffe is a really good actor, I thought he was miscast.  He looked really to young for the part.  In fact, he looked like he was 18 with badly grown facial hair.  I also loved how the boy in the marsh body was never recovered, yet Kipps was not only able to locate it in record time, the carriage he died in looked as if it had just rolled in yesterday instead of rotting under the water and muck for the last forty years.  But the biggest complaint lies in the ending.  For a movie this grim, I found it a little too happy, a little too Hollywood. It seemed out of place and that pretty much killed it for me.

1464664,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIGOQ,C. Sawin,"[10, 19]","At the tail end of the 19th century, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) still feels like the wound is still fresh when it comes to his wife who died four years ago after giving birth to their son. Arthur is drowning in a depressive state that even his son notices. As a lawyer, Arthur is forced to travel to a secluded town to take care of the work of the now deceased Alice Drablow as a last ditch effort to save his job. Arthur is expecting to be buried in paperwork until the weekend, but the odd occurrences that transpire are a bit out of left field. Everyone in town practically begs for Arthur to return to London immediately as children continue to die gruesome deaths left and right. Ignoring their pleas, Arthur decides to confront the problem head on and stay at the Drablow's menacing house where his constant run-ins with the supernatural eventually take its toll on him.The Woman in Black is a horror film that I wanted to be good. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first movie outside of the Harry Potter franchise and he's been pretty enthusiastic about it in interviews, but every bit of promotional material seemed to point at the movie being your everyday, generic, run of the mill, ""scary"" movie. The Woman in Black does provoke your interest at first. The strange opening is a little hokey, but kind of intrigues you at the same time. The atmosphere the movie tries to setup is its strongest asset though. The heavy use of fog and old fashioned feel of the town does make the town feel like it existed in the late 1800s and the ominous score does its best to try and bring you to the edge of your seat. The Drablow house is the key to that atmosphere as it's absolutely gorgeous in this hideously grotesque kind of way. Everything is so dusty and creepy while the Victorian design only adds to that uneasy feeling the movie tries to stir up in the pit of your stomach.In the meantime though, everything else in the movie is working against it. It's extremely uneventful. Daniel Radcliffe reads papers, walks through a house, holds a candle, and gets a little dirty. That's the entire movie in one sentence. The Woman in Black also resorts to relying on nothing more than jump scares to try and scare its audience. There are four in the first twenty minutes; two from the same sequence and there are at least ten throughout the entire movie. Jump scares can be fantastic in small portions, but come off as incredibly weak when you can see them coming a mile away and are strung together haphazardly for a cheap effect. There isn't much dialogue while Arthur is in the Drablow house either, which is practically the entire movie. This was probably done to try and make the audience more absorbed with what was taking place on screen, but seems like a bit of a copout overall. Radcliffe has proven that he is an extremely talented actor, but he's pretty bland here. He mostly wanders around in a daze with a frazzled look on his face the entire time. His hosting gig on Saturday Night Live was more impressive in comparison.The Woman in Black will still be a very successful film as nearly everyone who was or still is a Harry Potter fan will be lining up around every street corner just to be able to see this movie, but the fact of the matter is that it just isn't a great movie. Its representation of the late 19th century is pretty good, but the writing, the ""scares,"" and (most of all) the entire conclusion are all just extremely disappointing. The Woman in Black is a watered down version of last year's Insidious that will more than likely gain a lot of praise it doesn't deserve.",2,Another spoke in the wheel...,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,3593,"['tail', 'end', '19th', 'century', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'still', 'wound', 'still', 'fresh', 'when', 'wife', 'who', 'died', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'giving', 'birth', 'son', 'Arthur', 'drowning', 'depressive', 'state', 'even', 'son', 'notices', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', 'forced', 'travel', 'secluded', 'town', 'take', 'care', 'work', 'now', 'deceased', 'Alice', 'Drablow', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'save', 'job', 'Arthur', 'expecting', 'be', 'buried', 'paperwork', 'weekend', 'odd', 'occurrences', 'transpire', 'are', 'bit', 'left', 'field', 'Everyone', 'town', 'practically', 'Arthur', 'return', 'London', 'immediately', 'children', 'continue', 'die', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'left', 'right', 'Ignoring', 'pleas', 'Arthur', 'confront', 'problem', 'head', 'stay', 'Drablow', 'menacing', 'house', 'where', 'constant', 'run-ins', 'supernatural', 'eventually', 'take', 'toll', 'him.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'horror', 'film', 'wanted', 'be', 'good', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'first', 'movie', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'been', 'pretty', 'enthusiastic', 'interviews', 'bit', 'promotional', 'material', 'seemed', 'point', 'movie', 'being', 'everyday', 'generic', 'run', 'mill', 'scary', 'movie', 'Woman', 'Black', 'provoke', 'interest', 'first', 'strange', 'opening', 'little', 'hokey', 'kind', 'intrigues', 'same', 'time', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'setup', 'strongest', 'asset', 'heavy', 'use', 'fog', 'old', 'fashioned', 'feel', 'town', 'make', 'town', 'feel', 'existed', 'late', '1800s', 'ominous', 'score', 'best', 'try', 'bring', 'edge', 'seat', 'Drablow', 'house', 'key', 'atmosphere', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'hideously', 'grotesque', 'kind', 'way', 'Everything', 'so', 'dusty', 'creepy', 'Victorian', 'design', 'only', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'movie', 'stir', 'up', 'pit', 'stomach.In', 'meantime', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'working', 'extremely', 'uneventful', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'papers', 'walks', 'house', 'candle', 'little', 'dirty', 'entire', 'movie', 'one', 'sentence', 'Woman', 'Black', 'also', 'relying', 'nothing', 'more', 'jump', 'scares', 'try', 'scare', 'audience', 'are', 'four', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'two', 'same', 'sequence', 'are', 'least', 'ten', 'entire', 'movie', 'Jump', 'scares', 'can', 'be', 'fantastic', 'small', 'portions', 'come', 'off', 'incredibly', 'weak', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'are', 'strung', 'together', 'haphazardly', 'cheap', 'effect', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'Arthur', 'Drablow', 'house', 'either', 'practically', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'try', 'make', 'audience', 'more', 'absorbed', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'screen', 'bit', 'copout', 'overall', 'Radcliffe', 'proven', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actor', 'pretty', 'bland', 'here', 'mostly', 'around', 'daze', 'frazzled', 'look', 'face', 'entire', 'time', 'hosting', 'gig', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'more', 'impressive', 'comparison.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'successful', 'film', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'will', 'be', 'lining', 'up', 'street', 'corner', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'fact', 'matter', 'just', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'representation', 'late', '19th', 'century', 'pretty', 'good', 'writing', 'scares', 'most', 'entire', 'conclusion', 'are', 'just', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'Woman', 'Black', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'last', 'year', 'Insidious', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'gain', 'lot', 'praise', ""n't"", 'deserve']",The Woman in Black

1464676,A31A9GENAJYD64,B005LAIGOQ,David M. Rossi,"[1, 2]","Is there another movie genre as maligned as horor? I don't think so. From gratuitous gore fests, silly slasher cesspools and remakes that rarely live up to the originals, Hollywood and even indie film directors have had their way with horror and they all too frequently don't deliver. Some directors even try REALLY hard, and offer up plot twists to make up for other shortcomings, and while I do enjoy a surprising plot element I didn't see coming, having seen so many horror films, I usually am not surprised as the filmmakers intended.Enter The Woman In Black. Right from the first moment, you know that this isn't going to be your run of the mill, disappointing, predictable scare vehicle. In fact, if you DO go into this one trying to find some evidence that you're about to discover some crazy secret as a plot twist, you will be disappointed. Radcliffe's character isn't one of the boys the woman did away with, back for some purpose or any other devious possible surprise. No, the filmmakers decided that a simple, straight up story about a ghost imposing vengeance to the rest of the town's children after losing her boy was just the right amount of motivation they needed to inspire enough scares from the creepy old gothic house and surrounding area.There are similarities to other ghost type stories such as the point when in order to hopefully put the woman to rest, he goes into a swamp/marsh to retrieve her boy's body to put with the woman in her coffin, highly reminiscent of 'The Ring' well sequence, but ultimately, similarities don't matter. There are enough genuine bone chilling moments to fluff the hair on the back of your neck for two movies, and the acting from all actors is far above the norm usually seen for horror films. As for Radcliffe and whether he's got the acting chops to move past Harry Potter and into more adult roles, rest assured he can. He himself is left to carry much of the weight of the movie on his shoulders for long periods of time alone, save for the woman and some of the ghosts of her victims keeping him company, and he does it brilliantly and believably.I also particularly like that the filmmakers were not afraid to rebel against tying everything up into a neat little package where everyone is ok at the end, and they also left it without a real 'hey there's gonna be a sequel' moment as well. Oh sure, they could do another one, but the way the film ends, it can more than stand alone on its' own merit, and I for one hope it does.

1464679,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B005LAIGOQ,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","The Arthur Kipps with whom I was hitherto more familiar is the English character by H.G. Wells, who later inspired the musical, ""Half a Sixpence"".This one, played by a haunted yet stoic Daniel Radcliffe with relatively few lines and whose large, photogenic blue eyes are as wide as they were in the first ""Harry Potter"" film, is the creation of novelist Susan Hill, and also English.Performing in this 95-minute horror flick, which in some ways is not too much of a stretch for him, the former child star, rocking a pair of sideburns along with his short but athletic build, plays an Edwardian era  widower with a small son(Radcliffe's  sweet little real-life godson, Mischa Handley), and sometimes seems eager, at times overly eager, to proclaim his maturity to the world. The short, pert chin of that still adorably pinchable boyish face, which once buttressed baby-fat-filled cheeks as it lifted in awe to inspect a golden snitch is now stubble ridden as it inspects grimmer haunted surroundings. Certain camera shots seem to echo and overly emphasize the message, ""I'm an adult now, and I have the body hair to prove it!""The tale begins with the inexplicable demise of the three Fisher Sisters(Emma Shorey, Molly Harmon,and Ellisa Walker-Reid), who suddenly, under mysterious possession, leave off from playing Tea Party with their dolls and jump to their deaths from the attic windows of their parents' inn amid the audible screams of their mother.Meanwhile in London, Kipps, a struggling  young attorney is sent to the costal area by train to settle a deceased client's estate, called Eel Marsh House where a vengeful veiled spirit haunts him  as it does the villagers, whose children also become possessed and engage in suicidal acts despite Kipps' frequent and futile attempts to save them. It is of some significance that his four-year-old has  drawn for him, a little calendar, marking the days leading to their scheduled Friday reunion.His most relevant acquaintance at this time is the prominent citizen, Sam Daily(Ciaran Hinds, who appeared with Radcliffe in the last two ""Harry Potter"" films), and his disturbed wife, Elizabeth(Janet McTeer)who still grieves the loss of their son, Nicholas(Sidney Johnston), who would have been the same age as Kipps had he lived.As the story continues, the young lawyer experiences a mounting level of social  castigation from the locals and is also haunted by a beautiful and benevolent woman in white, namely the spirit of his late wife(Sophie Stuckey) who died in childbirth.Scenes of him sifting through the correspondence that help him investigate the case with the malevolent spirit lurking about reminded me of  part of the following poem, ""Antigonish"" by William Hughes Mearns:""Yesterday, upon the stair, I saw a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away.""The apparition of this woman( Liz White) who won't go away is later joined by the phantoms of her many young victims. But after gaining in-depth knowledge of the situation, Arthur, with Mr. Daily's help, literally gets down and dirty to bring resolution to the previously unsolved matter. But the spirit remains unforgiving, and she will restore everything Arthur holds dear to him in her own cruel way, creating a very poignant ending.I can't say I found this horror flick to be too scary at all, really. But Radcliffe's personal charm carries the story, and Director James Watkins provides another showcase for its young star's fabulous talent.",3,A Friday Reunion and An Evil Reward for Redemption,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,3496,"['Arthur', 'Kipps', 'whom', 'was', 'hitherto', 'more', 'familiar', 'English', 'character', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'who', 'later', 'inspired', 'musical', 'Sixpence', 'one', 'played', 'haunted', 'yet', 'stoic', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'relatively', 'few', 'lines', 'large', 'photogenic', 'blue', 'eyes', 'are', 'as', 'wide', 'were', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'creation', 'novelist', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'also', 'English.Performing', '95-minute', 'horror', 'flick', 'ways', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'stretch', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'rocking', 'pair', 'sideburns', 'short', 'athletic', 'build', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'widower', 'small', 'son', 'Radcliffe', 'sweet', 'little', 'real-life', 'godson', 'Mischa', 'Handley', 'sometimes', 'eager', 'times', 'overly', 'eager', 'proclaim', 'maturity', 'world', 'short', 'pert', 'chin', 'still', 'adorably', 'pinchable', 'boyish', 'face', 'once', 'buttressed', 'baby-fat-filled', 'cheeks', 'lifted', 'awe', 'inspect', 'golden', 'snitch', 'now', 'stubble', 'ridden', 'grimmer', 'haunted', 'surroundings', 'Certain', 'camera', 'shots', 'seem', 'echo', 'overly', 'emphasize', 'message', ""'m"", 'adult', 'now', 'have', 'body', 'hair', 'prove', 'tale', 'inexplicable', 'demise', 'three', 'Fisher', 'Sisters', 'Emma', 'Shorey', 'Molly', 'Harmon', 'Ellisa', 'Walker-Reid', 'who', 'suddenly', 'mysterious', 'possession', 'leave', 'off', 'playing', 'Tea', 'Party', 'dolls', 'jump', 'deaths', 'attic', 'windows', 'parents', 'inn', 'audible', 'screams', 'mother.Meanwhile', 'London', 'Kipps', 'struggling', 'young', 'attorney', 'sent', 'costal', 'area', 'train', 'settle', 'deceased', 'client', 'estate', 'called', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'where', 'vengeful', 'veiled', 'spirit', 'villagers', 'children', 'also', 'become', 'possessed', 'engage', 'suicidal', 'acts', 'Kipps', 'frequent', 'futile', 'attempts', 'save', 'significance', 'four-year-old', 'drawn', 'little', 'calendar', 'marking', 'days', 'leading', 'scheduled', 'Friday', 'most', 'relevant', 'acquaintance', 'time', 'prominent', 'citizen', 'Sam', 'Daily', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'who', 'appeared', 'Radcliffe', 'last', 'two', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'disturbed', 'wife', 'Elizabeth', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'who', 'still', 'loss', 'son', 'Nicholas', 'Sidney', 'Johnston', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'age', 'Kipps', 'had', 'story', 'young', 'lawyer', 'mounting', 'level', 'social', 'castigation', 'locals', 'also', 'haunted', 'beautiful', 'benevolent', 'woman', 'white', 'namely', 'spirit', 'late', 'wife', 'Sophie', 'Stuckey', 'who', 'died', 'childbirth.Scenes', 'sifting', 'correspondence', 'help', 'investigate', 'case', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'lurking', 'reminded', 'part', 'following', 'poem', 'Antigonish', 'William', 'Hughes', 'Mearns', 'Yesterday', 'stair', 'saw', 'man', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'again', 'today', 'wish', 'wish', ""'d"", 'go', 'away', 'apparition', 'woman', 'Liz', 'White', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'later', 'joined', 'phantoms', 'many', 'young', 'victims', 'gaining', 'in-depth', 'knowledge', 'situation', 'Arthur', 'Mr.', 'Daily', 'help', 'literally', 'down', 'dirty', 'bring', 'resolution', 'previously', 'unsolved', 'matter', 'spirit', 'unforgiving', 'will', 'restore', 'everything', 'Arthur', 'dear', 'own', 'cruel', 'way', 'creating', 'very', 'poignant', 'ending.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'found', 'horror', 'flick', 'be', 'too', 'scary', 'really', 'Radcliffe', 'personal', 'charm', 'story', 'Director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'showcase', 'young', 'star', 'fabulous', 'talent']",The Woman in Black

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[48, 53]","I love gothic horror -- big cobwebbed houses, squawking ravens, rolling mists and mysterious sinister figures that are only glimpsed. ""The Woman in Black"" has all of those. In fact, this slow, haunting movie loads on the Edwardian ghost-story atmosphere so thick that it practically chokes you -- and while it tends to move slowly, it's beautifully creepy.Young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has a life in tatters -- his career is in jeopardy, and he's still in mourning over the loss of his wife four years ago. He's sent to sort through the personal effects of Alice Drablow, who left behind a decayed mansion set in the misty marshes -- and when visiting the house, he sees a veiled woman in black.The locals are also desperate to get rid of him, even blaming him for the death of a child who drank lye. And soon Kipps begins to understand why, as he unravels the secrets of the Drablow family, and the madwoman who lost her child long ago. With the help of his new friend Sam Daily (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds),  Kipps will set out to stop the Woman in Black before she claims what's dearest to him.I haven't been too impressed with the output of the revitalized Hammer Films company. ""The Woman in Black"" is probably the best horror movie they've produced -- it feels like a modern version of their shadowy, gothic old movies. It's also not very scary, although director James Watkins tosses in a few jump scares (a raven, a faucet, etc).Instead, the movie just makes you uneasy. We're constantly aware that SOMETHING is hovering over this town. But for most of the movie, we only see fleeting glimpses of the Woman and her power.The biggest problem is that the movie moves rather slowly, especially in the first half. But for me, it's compensated for by Watkins inserting some truly unnerving scenes, like a hysterical Mrs. Daily carving into the table. And the gothic atmosphere is so heavy and dark that it practically drips from the screen -- vast mildewed houses, foggy marshes, half-forgotten letters and old photos, and a grey rainy light that seems to wash the colors from the world.There's not a trace of Harry Potter in Daniel Radcliffe's performance here. His Arthur Kipps is a haunted, broken figure who seems strangely detached from the world around him, except when it comes to endangered children. The only problem is that Radcliffe looks a little young for the role -- whenever Arthur is with his little son, he looks more like the kid's big brother.""The Woman in Black"" is rather slow at times, but the gothic atmosphere and a strong performance from Radcliffe almost make up for that.

1464694,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B005LAIGOQ,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE WOMAN IN BLACK (2012, 95 minutes) may only be hailed as one of the retooled Hammer Studios' 'horror-light' flicks (it's rated PG-13), it may be remembered only for its very beautiful presentation of a very hot adult Daniel Radcliffe. However, I think it will also be remembered for its excellent presentation of the modern paranormal-obsessed ideas about haunted houses.Not to be confused withWoman in Black [HD].In this sense it is a bit rife with anachronistic speech. Radcliffe is a young attorney who travels to a weird lady's estate to personally sort through her papers. When he begins catching glimpses of her (there's your ""lady in black"") and village children start killing themselves - well! - all I can say is I wonder how they balanced this to keep the PG-13 rating. But they did. I must say, they got some of the tension at perfect pitch, but the problem is it rarely pays. The tension in horror movies must pay off, otherwise it only hurts your muscles.Radcliffe is adequate in this, his most boring work to date. The majority of this film consists of Radcliffe (who makes Edwardian suits look extremely sexy), wandering about the giant, spooky mansion and looking gravely concerned. In a way, for me it is a treat because it is a return to the old Hammer days, complete with a tiny bit of that trademark ""Hammer Blood"" and Hammer's wonderful treatment of making scary horror into a rather bright, colorful Victorian riot. I love that when there's no senseless gore.What I do not like is the manipulation of children. Here it is used sparingly but it is used nonetheless. I hate that. Children should be off limits for anything adult. Have we not learned that yet?! Otherwise, it is a typical silly low-key British horror film and one cannot blame them for stretching an entire film to fit a rather small metaphysical issue. Perhaps the best of this film is really Radcliffe. The camera loves this boy as I do, and it manages to study almost every inch of him, from his coiffed black hair to his flat Tiffany-blue eyes, from his alabaster skin to his very fine form.I drool for Radcliffe and don't care who knows it! So does this film, and it offers him quite a few close-ups that I wonder whether he deserves or not. It isn't that he can't act because he is most capable; it's that nothing is actually happening and he gets these startling close-ups which I love and audiences love. But otherwise why do it? It borders on treating Radcliffe like a piece of meat. That is something I do not appreciate.One interesting thing this film shows is how relatively healthy Radcliffe really is. Emotional stability and an overall relatively clean bill of health is always written all over a star's face and body. When playing Harry Potter, there were times when Radcliffe was drunk, which he says fans can spot by catching the scenes where he's ""dead behind the eyes"". I'd guess it was because of his condition, dyspraxia - but Radcliffe stopped drinking some time ago and it really shows. He's 25 and he has a truly stellar career ahead of him, if he works instead of playing to any crowd.Luckily, that is just what Radcliffe does.With the talents of Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Shaun Dooley and Roger Allam.",4,Hammer knocks one home again ... sort of ...,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,3212,"['WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', '2012', '95', 'minutes', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'hailed', 'one', 'retooled', 'Hammer', 'Studios', ""'horror-light"", 'flicks', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'may', 'be', 'remembered', 'only', 'very', 'beautiful', 'presentation', 'very', 'hot', 'adult', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'However', 'think', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'remembered', 'excellent', 'presentation', 'modern', 'paranormal-obsessed', 'ideas', 'haunted', 'houses.Not', 'be', 'confused', 'withWoman', 'Black', '[', 'HD', ']', '.In', 'sense', 'bit', 'rife', 'anachronistic', 'speech', 'Radcliffe', 'young', 'attorney', 'who', 'weird', 'lady', 'estate', 'personally', 'sort', 'papers', 'When', 'catching', 'glimpses', 'lady', 'black', 'village', 'children', 'start', 'killing', 'well', 'can', 'say', 'wonder', 'how', 'balanced', 'keep', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'did', 'must', 'say', 'got', 'tension', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'problem', 'rarely', 'tension', 'horror', 'movies', 'must', 'pay', 'off', 'otherwise', 'only', 'muscles.Radcliffe', 'adequate', 'most', 'boring', 'work', 'date', 'majority', 'film', 'Radcliffe', 'who', 'Edwardian', 'suits', 'look', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'wandering', 'giant', 'spooky', 'mansion', 'looking', 'gravely', 'concerned', 'way', 'treat', 'return', 'old', 'Hammer', 'days', 'complete', 'tiny', 'bit', 'trademark', 'Hammer', 'Blood', 'Hammer', 'wonderful', 'treatment', 'making', 'scary', 'horror', 'rather', 'bright', 'colorful', 'Victorian', 'riot', 'love', 'when', 'senseless', 'gore.What', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'manipulation', 'children', 'Here', 'used', 'sparingly', 'used', 'nonetheless', 'hate', 'Children', 'should', 'be', 'off', 'limits', 'anything', 'adult', 'Have', 'not', 'learned', 'yet', 'Otherwise', 'typical', 'silly', 'low-key', 'British', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'blame', 'stretching', 'entire', 'film', 'fit', 'rather', 'small', 'metaphysical', 'issue', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'film', 'really', 'Radcliffe', 'camera', 'boy', 'do', 'study', 'almost', 'inch', 'coiffed', 'black', 'hair', 'flat', 'Tiffany-blue', 'eyes', 'alabaster', 'skin', 'very', 'fine', 'form.I', 'drool', 'Radcliffe', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'So', 'film', 'quite', 'few', 'close-ups', 'wonder', 'not', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'most', 'capable', 'nothing', 'actually', 'happening', 'startling', 'close-ups', 'love', 'audiences', 'love', 'otherwise', 'why', 'do', 'treating', 'Radcliffe', 'piece', 'meat', 'something', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate.One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'film', 'how', 'relatively', 'healthy', 'Radcliffe', 'really', 'Emotional', 'stability', 'overall', 'relatively', 'clean', 'bill', 'health', 'always', 'written', 'star', 'face', 'body', 'When', 'playing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'were', 'times', 'when', 'Radcliffe', 'was', 'drunk', 'fans', 'can', 'spot', 'catching', 'scenes', 'where', 'dead', 'eyes', ""'d"", 'guess', 'was', 'condition', 'dyspraxia', 'Radcliffe', 'stopped', 'drinking', 'time', 'ago', 'really', '25', 'truly', 'stellar', 'career', 'ahead', 'instead', 'playing', 'crowd.Luckily', 'just', 'what', 'Radcliffe', 'does.With', 'talents', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'Shaun', 'Dooley', 'Roger', 'Allam']",The Woman in Black

Indeed at one point I found myself wondering where his glasses were, before realizing he didn't have any.

And it moves at an old fashioned pace that may not be to everyone's tastes. I loved the slow build up though.There are a lot of ghost story tropes here. Faces in windows; dogs barking; unwelcoming villagers. Some may say it's unoriginal I suppose. I think of it more as using the familiar elements to build suspense and fear.

He needs to go to an old, dilapidated house in some town and straighten out the paperwork after its final owner has passed. Weird stuff starts to happen and kids start to die. He gets sidetracked and needs to get to the bottom of things.This is all so old. The creepy looking dolls, the creepy wind-up toys. The cob-webs and gloominess. Things half seen. Clues behind wallpaper. I can't believe they're still using this stuff. There are a couple of jump scares which, as any film maker should know, no longer cut it. The music score was too obvious. It underscored the on-screen happenings with a thick, black magic marker. There were a couple of genuinely creepy scenes in the third act but, by that time, it was too late.On the production side, they DID try. The sets, though old news, were done well. The costuming was decent and good attention was paid to period detail. The acting was decent enough, though I found Radcliffe to be rather stiff. And I liked the way they ended the story.

The biggest problem in the film is that everything is obvious, blatant and upfront, given to us in the initial stages of the film on a silver platter so we know what to expect. There's little in the way of true build up to give any heightened suspense; they just kind of rush Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe) to the house as soon as possible, and then the residents and locals try to rush him out of the house. Another problem is simply that we don't quite get into the head of Kipps as much in the film. Seeing things from his perspective as he sees them--as he slowly realizes the history of the house and the woman-- makes the novel much more effectively atmospheric, something not accomplished as well in this film. There are a few scares scattered a few places, and the story does come into focus aptly in the second part, especially as he finds out the woman's history, but mainly this film just felt too rushed and lacks any subtlety.I think you are better off checking out the other version of The Woman in Black,Woman in Black.

Normally, scary movies don't bother me, but this one actually spooked me a bit.  It can be slow at times, but I think the slow pace actually lets the creepiness of the scenes get inside you.A lawyer is sent off to a run-down house on the edge of a marsh in order to go through the papers left there, leaving his young son at home.  This is his last shot at working out at the firm, due to his clear depression over the death of his wife in childbirth years ago.  Once he gets there, the townsfolk try desperately to send him right back to London and warn him not to go out to Eel Marsh House.  But, of course, he does...The Woman in Black turns out to be a ghost with murderous tendencies and Daniel Radcliffe's character tries desperately to deal with fulfilling his charge as well as figuring out why she is haunting the place, and attacking the children of the village.  It was hard at first to see past ""Harry Potter,"" but as the movie continued, the acting won me over.The house itself, filled with Victorian oddities and old paintings, and the lonely marsh its set in provide a spooky landscape for the story.

The young lawyer arrives, but wasn't welcomed with open arms. It was quite obvious that the people in town didn't want him there, but worse yet, there was much more to worry about than just feeling unwanted in the forbidden village. I highly recommend this classic goth story to all thriller and mystery lovers, who enjoy intense suspense throughout with fear and dread instilled from beginning to end. This dark mystery with its silent screams, ghosts and faces in windows will have you biting your nails right up until a shocking ending! The flickering candlelight mood with slamming doors and fog outside will give you that same eerie feeling as if you were viewing 'CAPE FEAR.'

1464708,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005LAIGOQ,Grady Harp,"[4, 5]","This is the second cinematic adaptation of Susan Hill's novel of the same name (the last was made in 1989), this one written for the screen by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. As with many British ghost stories (termed Horror, Drama, Thriller by the press) the themes remain the same - just the locales and the names of the characters change. Not that that is a bad thing, but it is nothing novel and if such stories are your cup of tea - shadowy images in darkened house windows, incidental dead children, a suspicious group of townspeople, a lots of candles flickering out because of mysterious doors opening and closing at will - then this incarnation will please. There is very little dialogue and very little character development, but the locations are magnificent, the cinematography is glorious (Tim Maurice Jones) and the musical score (Marco Beltrami) is chilling. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an elegantly creepy, atmospheric, British period style ghost story.When a friendless old widow dies in the seaside town of Crythin, young solicitor Arthur Krips (Daniel Radcliffe), who lives with his four-year old son Joseph (Misha Handley) - Arthur's wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth) - and Joseph's Nanny (Jessica Raine), is sent by his firm to settle the estate. Arthur finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about or go near the woman's dreary home and no one will explain or even acknowledge the fact that he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. Ignoring the towns-people's cryptic warnings (they are trying to conceal a deadly secret), he goes to the house where he discovers its horrible history and becomes ensnared in its even more horrible legacy.Along the way Arthur is befriended by Dailey (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and his strange insane wife (Janet McTeer) and Dailey is the only man willing to transport Arthur across the tide covered marshes to the haunted estate. The story is basically dealing with life after death - in the person of ghosts who stay around to wreck vengeance for their deaths - and the many events that suggest that indeed there is a place after death is borne out by story's strange ending.Daniel Radcliffe manages to carry his role well (the designers keep him with a fashionable 5 o'clock shadow to prove he has outgrown Harry Potter) and the subordinate cast is strong in the miniscule parts they are given. This is a mood piece, a ghost story of the old-fashioned sort, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. You either like these films or you don't.

1464710,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B005LAIGOQ,Graves,"[1, 1]","Badly advertised in the US, Daniel Radcliffe's ""The Woman in Black"" was made to look like some sort of Heathcliffe character living in a doomed old house. In fact the film was so much better.Set around the turn of the 20th century Radcliffe plays an attorney who is sent out by a London firm to sort out and secure the estate of a wealthy client.""Go through all her documents to make sure we have the LAST will and testament"" he is told.  The firm has a man on the ground there but they don't trust him.Radcliffe arrives to find the town to be closed to the point of paranoia and no one will give him a straight answer. They don't want him around and things like rooms reserved at the local inn not being available seem determined to drive him off. But Radcliff, having been told this is his last chance with the firm to get his act together since the death of his wife, is determined to see it through and if need be will stay in the house over night to get the job done rather than run the gauntlet of locals staring at him.The house is haunted of course, no surprise there, and as the night wears on the creep factor mounts. In an era of horror films full of gore, this one uses suggestion for more of its fright factor setting up scenes and letting the viewer's imagination do the work.There are a few flaws that are a little obvious. The whole thing is very ""grey"" to look at. Even the outdoor scenes are dismal and grey and the trick gets a little wearing on the eye. I counted two scenes with bright day light and they stand out. There are also a couple of very bad continuity slips. For example there is a scene where he hears a noise behind a door and tries to investigate. The hall way is lit with candles but no idea why? Did he do it? That is never raised. Or is the fact that when he returns to try and force the door, the candles around the door that were lit in the last shot are now out and he must take a candle from a holder with him. Not something you'd notice in most films but when this goes so far to set the creepy mood, these elements jump out at you.In the end this was so much better than the adverts made it appear and Radcliffe is well enough done that at no point do you think ""It's Harry Potter.""

1464715,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIGOQ,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","The Harry Potter franchise has left such lasting impact that, throughout the viewing of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, I half-expected Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to apparate and lend a hand to their beleaguered old mate. A Hammer Films joint, THE WOMAN IN BLACK makes for elegant British gothic horror. It tells a dark tale of numbing loss and unholy vengeance. It's Daniel Radcliffe's first venture into cinema, post-Potter. And yet he's still dabbling in the supernatural.Susan Hill's eerie 1983 bestseller had already been adapted as a television mini-series in the 1980s and as a stage play, but the rejuvenated Hammer Film Productions thumbed it up for a go on the silver screen anyway. Daniel Radcliffe, all of 21 years old during the filming, plays widower Arthur Kipps who after four years still grieves for his wife's passing. His inertness has adversely affected his career at a London law firm to the extent that he's a hair's breadth away from getting sacked.Arthur Kipps gets one last chance to make good. He's dispatched to northeast England, to a remote village in which outskirts looms the creaky Eel Marsh House. In this ruined mansion, ringed by treacherous marshland and accessible only by a causeway, Arthur is to sort out a deceased woman's estate. But since this isn't an episode of SUITS, the spooky very soon emerges.A curse holds the nearby village in thrall, or not a curse but rather a vindictive spirit. Arthur's arrival is met with instant suspicion from the inhospitable townspeople, most of whom fear what Arthur's meddling may further stir up. Faced with brusqueness at every turn, Arthur Kipps presses on. And while he's so emotionally closed off that he rarely exhibits a reaction to the alarming stuff going on around him, the film does a very good job of jangling our nerves. The scares are of the make-you-jump variety, cheap but very effective and more restrained than garish. THE WOMAN IN BLACK does well in establishing its ghost story ground rules. We find out that the menacing figure that fleetingly graces your peripheral vision - a veiled woman clad in black mourning garb - is targeting children, is forcing them to engage in gruesome self-extermination. So, right there, a measure of tension is lifted. We know Radcliffe's character is moderately safe. And there isn't a child prominently featured in the film for whom we have a rooting investment. Arthur's young boy Joseph (played by 4-year-old Misha Handley, Radcliffe's godson in real life) is barely in it.Set in the Edwardian era (thus placing this story somewhen between 1901 - 1910), the film's biggest ace is the marvelously ominous set design of the Eel Marsh House. It's one of the spookiest haunted houses seen onscreen in recent years. As ever, in the auspices of a ghost story, children's toys very much become these creepy artifacts. I thought Radcliffe does okay. He plays a repressed widower and you may wonder why he doesn't panic more or just plain clear out when that empty rocking chair starts rocking or disembodied footsteps are heard or that distant window pane reveals a spectral woman gazing out. I think Arthur Kipps sees these unsettling events in another way, sees them as evidence of an afterlife in which he can reunite with his dead wife. One gets the sense that he deliberately seeks out the unrestful spirit. It's up to you whether this undertone exists and if it's communicated by Radcliffe's rather reserved performance. Also, with high tide closing off the causeway, where was he gonna go?THE WOMAN IN BLACK is rich in atmosphere and broodingly gothic. It's a restrained but effective chiller. Certain moments made me clutch the armrest. Perhaps one knock is that while it does maintain a thread of steady suspense, I think it fails in delivering that big payoff. It falls short of that epic grand guignol. It's touted as the most successful British horror picture in two decades, and so were you at all startled when Hammer Films announced a sequel, the story set to take place during World War II?The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio commentary with director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman- ""Inside the Perfect Thriller: Making THE WOMAN IN BLACK"" (00:09:32 minutes)- ""No Fear: Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps"" (00:04:05 minutes)",4,"""Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur.""",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",2012,4267,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'left', 'such', 'lasting', 'impact', 'viewing', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'half-expected', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'apparate', 'lend', 'hand', 'beleaguered', 'old', 'mate', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'joint', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'elegant', 'British', 'gothic', 'horror', 'dark', 'tale', 'numbing', 'loss', 'unholy', 'vengeance', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'first', 'venture', 'cinema', 'post-Potter', 'yet', 'still', 'dabbling', 'supernatural.Susan', 'Hill', 'eerie', '1983', 'bestseller', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'adapted', 'television', 'mini-series', '1980s', 'stage', 'play', 'rejuvenated', 'Hammer', 'Film', 'Productions', 'thumbed', 'up', 'go', 'silver', 'screen', 'anyway', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', '21', 'years', 'old', 'filming', 'widower', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'who', 'four', 'years', 'still', 'wife', 'passing', 'inertness', 'adversely', 'affected', 'career', 'London', 'law', 'firm', 'extent', 'hair', 'breadth', 'away', 'getting', 'sacked.Arthur', 'Kipps', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'make', 'good', 'dispatched', 'England', 'remote', 'village', 'creaky', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'ruined', 'mansion', 'ringed', 'treacherous', 'marshland', 'accessible', 'only', 'causeway', 'Arthur', 'sort', 'out', 'deceased', 'woman', 'estate', ""n't"", 'episode', 'SUITS', 'spooky', 'very', 'soon', 'emerges.A', 'curse', 'nearby', 'village', 'thrall', 'not', 'curse', 'rather', 'vindictive', 'spirit', 'Arthur', 'arrival', 'met', 'instant', 'suspicion', 'inhospitable', 'townspeople', 'most', 'whom', 'fear', 'what', 'Arthur', 'meddling', 'may', 'further', 'stir', 'up', 'Faced', 'brusqueness', 'turn', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'so', 'emotionally', 'closed', 'off', 'rarely', 'reaction', 'alarming', 'stuff', 'going', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'jangling', 'nerves', 'scares', 'are', 'make-you-jump', 'variety', 'cheap', 'very', 'effective', 'more', 'restrained', 'garish', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'well', 'establishing', 'ghost', 'story', 'ground', 'rules', 'find', 'out', 'menacing', 'figure', 'fleetingly', 'peripheral', 'vision', 'veiled', 'woman', 'clad', 'black', 'mourning', 'garb', 'targeting', 'children', 'forcing', 'engage', 'gruesome', 'self-extermination', 'So', 'right', 'there', 'measure', 'tension', 'lifted', 'know', 'Radcliffe', 'character', 'moderately', 'safe', ""n't"", 'child', 'prominently', 'featured', 'film', 'whom', 'have', 'rooting', 'investment', 'Arthur', 'young', 'boy', 'Joseph', 'played', '4-year-old', 'Misha', 'Handley', 'Radcliffe', 'godson', 'real', 'life', 'barely', 'it.Set', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'thus', 'placing', 'story', 'somewhen', '1901', '1910', 'film', 'biggest', 'ace', 'marvelously', 'ominous', 'set', 'design', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'one', 'spookiest', 'haunted', 'houses', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'recent', 'years', 'ever', 'auspices', 'ghost', 'story', 'children', 'toys', 'very', 'much', 'creepy', 'artifacts', 'thought', 'Radcliffe', 'okay', 'repressed', 'widower', 'may', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'panic', 'more', 'just', 'plain', 'clear', 'out', 'when', 'empty', 'rocking', 'chair', 'rocking', 'disembodied', 'footsteps', 'are', 'heard', 'distant', 'window', 'pane', 'spectral', 'woman', 'gazing', 'out', 'think', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'unsettling', 'events', 'way', 'evidence', 'afterlife', 'can', 'reunite', 'dead', 'wife', 'One', 'sense', 'deliberately', 'out', 'unrestful', 'spirit', 'up', 'undertone', 'communicated', 'Radcliffe', 'rather', 'reserved', 'performance', 'Also', 'high', 'closing', 'off', 'causeway', 'where', 'was', 'gon', 'go', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'rich', 'atmosphere', 'broodingly', 'gothic', 'restrained', 'effective', 'chiller', 'Certain', 'moments', 'made', 'clutch', 'armrest', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'knock', 'maintain', 'thread', 'steady', 'suspense', 'think', 'delivering', 'big', 'payoff', 'short', 'epic', 'grand', 'guignol', 'touted', 'most', 'successful', 'British', 'horror', 'picture', 'two', 'decades', 'so', 'were', 'startled', 'when', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'announced', 'sequel', 'story', 'set', 'take', 'place', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'stuff', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'screenwriter', 'Jane', 'Goldman-', 'Perfect', 'Thriller', 'Making', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', '00:09:32', 'minutes', 'Fear', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', '00:04:05', 'minutes']",The Woman in Black

A very mature Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, an attorney hired to go through paperwork at a dark, gothic, lonely mansion, with its own cemetery, out in the swamplands of England.  The only road to this home is flooded regularly, so Arthur is at the mercy of the  tides.  The time is the early 1900s, and the only means of lighting are candles & oil lamps which help set the mood.  The movie sets your nerves on edge with perfectly filmed movements behind Arthur who is completely focused on his job.  It is frightening when the fur on the back of the dog's neck raises and he begins to growl at movement down the hall.

1464721,ANPE9R0D2G8AO,B005LAIGOQ,Inanna Arthen,"[2, 3]","I was hoping that I would like this movie more, but I found it almost unwatchable. Only Daniel Radcliffe would have gotten me past the first fifteen minutes.I'm not a big horror fan, which may be part of the problem; I'm probably out of synch with what horror fans like. But I always feel that well-done horror has some kind of point beyond nihilistic unpleasantness. Often it's a very moralistic point, which you could argue is the case here, with the evil ghost being a ""wronged woman."" But the victims of her wrath are wholly blameless of any complicity, past or present, in her sufferings, and there's never any resolution to her pain or theirs.On top of this, the events of the film are less horrific than merely sadistic. I don't like stories that exploit the suffering of children or animals and the people who grieve for them. That's just cheap manipulation and disturbing on a whole other level--writers and filmmakers who do this seem more pathological themselves than their characters.The movie works very, very hard to be ""scary"" and it's so obvious about it, the artifice shows. The scary old house is a really, *really* scary old house...but why was it so decrepit when its owner had died so recently that her papers were still in probate and being sorted out by lawyers? Just how long had that house been empty? Then, not only is the house already scary, it's out on a sort of point which turns into an island at high tide. Why would anyone build a big expensive mansion in such a location, and why didn't it just sink, since it's surrounded by quicksand? There are lots of scary bits with ghosts (or visions, at least) suddenly appearing or sneaking up behind, but it's like a carnival funhouse. The ghosts literally ""leap out and yell boo,"" and even as you're jumping out of your seat, you have this annoyed sense that you're just the butt of a practical joke. Since this is a movie about dead children, of course we have lots of Scary Toys, too. The contrivances are just too apparent.I didn't read the book on which this is based, so I don't know how much the scriptwriters are to blame. You could extract a psychological mystery out of this; the protagonist, Arthur Kipps, lost his young wife when she died giving birth to their first child. Four years later, he is still so consumed by grief that his son draws pictures of him wearing black and crying because ""daddy always looks like that,"" and his bosses are fed up with him and about to fire him if he doesn't get over himself. But if Kipps has conflicted feelings toward his son, which might cause him to unconsciously hate children, the movie never implies this, so the sudden uptick in child deaths after his arrival in the village has no explanation. I won't spoil the ending, but let's just say it's a head-scratcher, and ultimately frustrating. You also see it coming from miles away.I only watched this movie because Radcliffe is in it, and unlike some reviewers, I think he does a great job. If he seems a little monochromatic, it's the fault of the script, not his performance. He works hard but he's given nothing to do except be grief-stricken, scared or desperate. He's choosing unusual roles post-Harry-Potter, and while that can be a good thing for an actor, he needs to allow himself more range than *The Woman in Black* allows him to display. There are some other fine performers in this movie, especially Janet McTeer and Ciaran Hinds, and all the cast does a good job, but most of them feel wasted. The movie is so grim, pratically the only emotion anyone is allowed to show is grief.This movie is one of the new offerings from the revived Hammer Films Productions, and it reminded me of a few of its earlier, sadder movies, in particular *Blood on Satan's Claw.* It's also very reminiscent of *The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series).* But unless you're suffering from crippling happiness and euphoria and need to bring yourself down (and this one will do it), I can't recommend *The Woman in Black.*",2,"If you need an antidote for a good mood, this one's for you",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,3998,"['was', 'hoping', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'more', 'found', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Only', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'horror', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'problem', ""'m"", 'probably', 'synch', 'what', 'horror', 'fans', 'always', 'feel', 'well-done', 'horror', 'kind', 'point', 'nihilistic', 'unpleasantness', 'Often', 'very', 'moralistic', 'point', 'could', 'argue', 'case', 'here', 'evil', 'ghost', 'being', 'wronged', 'woman', 'victims', 'wrath', 'are', 'wholly', 'blameless', 'complicity', 'past', 'present', 'sufferings', 'never', 'resolution', 'pain', 'theirs.On', 'top', 'events', 'film', 'are', 'less', 'horrific', 'merely', 'sadistic', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'stories', 'exploit', 'suffering', 'children', 'animals', 'people', 'who', 'grieve', 'just', 'cheap', 'manipulation', 'disturbing', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'do', 'seem', 'more', 'pathological', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'be', 'scary', 'so', 'obvious', 'artifice', 'shows', 'scary', 'old', 'house', 'really', '*really*', 'scary', 'old', 'house', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'decrepit', 'when', 'owner', 'had', 'died', 'so', 'recently', 'papers', 'were', 'still', 'probate', 'being', 'sorted', 'out', 'lawyers', 'Just', 'how', 'long', 'had', 'house', 'been', 'empty', 'Then', 'not', 'only', 'house', 'already', 'scary', 'out', 'sort', 'point', 'island', 'high', 'tide', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'build', 'big', 'expensive', 'mansion', 'such', 'location', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'sink', 'surrounded', 'quicksand', 'are', 'lots', 'scary', 'bits', 'ghosts', 'visions', 'least', 'suddenly', 'appearing', 'sneaking', 'up', 'carnival', 'funhouse', 'ghosts', 'literally', 'leap', 'out', 'yell', 'boo', 'even', ""'re"", 'jumping', 'seat', 'have', 'annoyed', 'sense', ""'re"", 'just', 'butt', 'practical', 'joke', 'movie', 'dead', 'children', 'course', 'have', 'lots', 'Scary', 'Toys', 'too', 'contrivances', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'apparent.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'scriptwriters', 'are', 'blame', 'could', 'extract', 'psychological', 'mystery', 'protagonist', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'lost', 'young', 'wife', 'when', 'died', 'giving', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'Four', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'so', 'consumed', 'grief', 'son', 'pictures', 'wearing', 'black', 'crying', 'daddy', 'always', 'bosses', 'are', 'fed', 'up', 'fire', ""n't"", 'get', 'Kipps', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'son', 'might', 'cause', 'unconsciously', 'hate', 'children', 'movie', 'never', 'sudden', 'uptick', 'child', 'deaths', 'arrival', 'village', 'explanation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'ending', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'head-scratcher', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'also', 'see', 'coming', 'miles', 'away.I', 'only', 'watched', 'movie', 'Radcliffe', 'reviewers', 'think', 'great', 'job', 'little', 'monochromatic', 'fault', 'script', 'not', 'performance', 'hard', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'be', 'grief-stricken', 'scared', 'desperate', 'choosing', 'unusual', 'roles', 'post-Harry-Potter', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'actor', 'allow', 'more', 'range', '*The', 'Woman', 'Black*', 'display', 'are', 'other', 'fine', 'performers', 'movie', 'especially', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'most', 'feel', 'wasted', 'movie', 'so', 'grim', 'pratically', 'only', 'emotion', 'anyone', 'allowed', 'show', 'grief.This', 'movie', 'one', 'new', 'offerings', 'revived', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'Productions', 'reminded', 'few', 'earlier', 'sadder', 'movies', 'particular', '*Blood', 'Satan', 'Claw', '*', 'also', 'very', 'reminiscent', '*The', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', '*', ""'re"", 'suffering', 'crippling', 'happiness', 'euphoria', 'need', 'bring', 'down', 'one', 'will', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', '*The', 'Woman', 'Black', '*']",The Woman in Black

1464724,A2D0ASQY7PAJAG,B005LAIGOQ,"Jacob A. Davis ""Writer, Artist, and Theologian""","[1, 1]","With the film The Woman in Black, Hammer Studios returns to their glory days of supernatural storytelling, invoking the Victorian-type ghost story in superb style. Easily one of the most stylish, most chilling horror films of the last couple of decades, this one also has a heart (as the best always do).The story plays on both the cards of the heartbroken young widower in grief over his wife's death as well as the both sad and frightening vengeful ghost whose mystery plays out and creating a truly terrifying build-up.For his part, Daniel Radcliffe shows he can work as a reliable adult lead, supported by a highly experienced ensemble cast led by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds. The film itself glories in its dark, broken beauty and makes one reminisce about haunted house classics like The Innocents (1961). There are also fairly potent visual reminders of other classic films such as The Phantom Carriage (1921) and Hammer's own Night Creatures (1962). The colors, though by no means absent, are mostly muted (making a great contrast in the few instances where they exist as striking). The music is minimal, unlike most American horror films that overwhelm with score from beginning to end.The story, adapted directly from the Susan Hill novel of the same name (itself also the source of one of the most iconic, longest-running English plays) features all of the classic elements of a haunted house story: the large, imposing mansion, the foggy, stormy atmosphere, a background in tragedy... it's all there. The tragedy compels us to listen to the story and to open our minds to it. We each experience tragedy and loss in our lives, and that seeking to connect with what (and who) we've lost can lead us down a path of desperation, but we don't know what doors and to what horrors that desperation can lead to. That is one of the great appeals of the gothic ghost story, and it plays out in excellence here.

1464727,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B005LAIGOQ,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[15, 17]","The Woman in Black is a pretty traditional haunted house story that focuses on atmosphere and the lingering feeling of dread instead of CGI gore and horror. If you've read the book, you'll be familiar with the unsettling nature of the story - a general sense that translated well to the stage play and here to the film. The filming locations capture the remoteness of a house cut off by tide and tragedy and the general production design makes great use of a set to spring some fairly major jumps.Daniel Radcliffe is well cast in bringing an innocence to a pretty dire situation where children keep dying every time the woman in black shows up, and he's clearly going to keep going beyond Harry Potter. The rest of the cast do well to portray the town that doesn't want Radcliffe there too. All of the tension and surprises rise from the situation and some clever camera shots and even the most hardened horror fan should get quite a few scares.It's all a fairly solid production until the ending. Susan Hill's book transcended the genre with the end of her story (which has since been copied many times) but this movie doesn't stay faithful to the original material in an attempt to spare the audience the downer. Considering the whole tale is about multiple violent child deaths, I think the filmmakers underestimated the audience here.",4,"A good, traditional haunted house story",1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,1338,"['Woman', 'Black', 'pretty', 'traditional', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'atmosphere', 'lingering', 'feeling', 'dread', 'instead', 'CGI', 'gore', 'horror', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', ""'ll"", 'be', 'familiar', 'unsettling', 'nature', 'story', 'general', 'sense', 'translated', 'well', 'stage', 'play', 'here', 'film', 'filming', 'locations', 'capture', 'remoteness', 'house', 'cut', 'off', 'tide', 'tragedy', 'general', 'production', 'design', 'great', 'use', 'set', 'spring', 'fairly', 'major', 'jumps.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'well', 'cast', 'bringing', 'innocence', 'pretty', 'dire', 'situation', 'where', 'children', 'keep', 'dying', 'time', 'woman', 'black', 'shows', 'up', 'clearly', 'going', 'keep', 'going', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'well', 'portray', 'town', ""n't"", 'want', 'Radcliffe', 'there', 'too', 'tension', 'surprises', 'rise', 'situation', 'clever', 'camera', 'shots', 'even', 'most', 'hardened', 'horror', 'fan', 'should', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'scares.It', 'fairly', 'solid', 'production', 'ending', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'book', 'transcended', 'genre', 'end', 'story', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'times', 'movie', ""n't"", 'stay', 'faithful', 'original', 'material', 'attempt', 'spare', 'audience', 'downer', 'Considering', 'whole', 'tale', 'multiple', 'violent', 'child', 'deaths', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'underestimated', 'audience', 'here']",The Woman in Black
1464728,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIGOQ,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","It's nice to have Hammer Studios back making horror films. This was the stuff I grew up on watching creature-features on Saturday afternoons with actors like Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt in their stable of stars, and a low-budget sensibility with a particular affinity for day-for-night shooting, busty ladies in tight corsets and pea-soup-thick atmosphere.However, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is not quite a horror film as it is a supernatural mystery. And it sadly doesn't have the tightly-corseted ladies, but as far as atmosphere, the cup runneth over. Endless mist, sunless days, torrential rain, candlelit hallways and always something lurking in the back of the frame.The plot of the film is very standard for a turn-of-the-20th-century haunted village story. A young widower (Radcliffe in a very mature performance) is sent on behalf of his law firm to clear up the estate of a wealthy recluse in a remote British town. The villagers in the town want him gone for unknown reasons, but he goes to the old mansion called Eel Marsh (sounds like a nice place, doesn't it?) and uncovers an unearthly presence and a mystery that has been taking the lives of children there for years. With his own child coming to visit him, he endeavors, with the help of a kindly man (the always great Ciaran Hinds) and his troubled wife (Janet McTeer, great in a small role), to give the ghost what he believes it needs to end its reign of terror.I'm always a little leery of ghost films because the cause of the haunting is usually far too mundane and that always leaves me wishing that it's not such a mystery as to why it's happening, and rather just have it HAPPEN. It lends a greater mystery and discomfort to the viewer and leaves us to ask questions after the film ends. That was my biggest problem with Robert Zemeckis' WHAT LIES BENEATH. That's also a bit of a problem here, but because of a nicely twisted ending, we find that their solution to the mystery isn't enough.Radcliffe really leaves Harry Potter behind in this film, and it's wonderful to see him really embrace this role. He's someone who is very wounded deep within his soul, and it makes sense that he would be more willing to explore the world of the unknown searching for answers. Hinds is once again great at a supporting role as the only man in the village who seems to be unafraid of what Radcliffe's character is doing, but there's a deeper weariness to Hinds as is revealed later. McTeer is wonderfully manic but not over-the-top loony as the still-grieving mother to a child long dead.This film embraces mood and atmosphere in favor of blood and shock, keeping with the tradition of Hammer Studios well. There are three or four really cheap but effective jump scares in the first act, and this is honestly the first film in years that I actually did feel my heart skip at some of those moments. Once that calms down, the cheap scares make way for a sense of genuine dread, which is something director James Watkins handles pretty deftly. Most of the film is very quiet, which makes the frightening noises that come out of that quiet much more effective. He also is adept at framing his shots. Many of the moments of the film look as though they could be gothic-era paintings.Sadly, the film becomes pretty sluggish in the third act as they feel they've found the solution to the desires of the spectre and do what they can to sate those desires. If the film had more of an adult appeal, I feel that this would have been more of a character study rather than a film of actions and consequences, but since it's Daniel Radcliffe, they had to make it more teen-friendly. I don't feel that those roles are far off at all for Radcliffe, having done a play like the extremely dark EQUUS, and they suit his seemingly perennial five-o'clock shadow and his intense and piercing eyes.Radcliffe is a young man who, even if he hadn't been in one of the most successful franchises of all time, would still have eventually become a star, and THE WOMAN IN BLACK is decidedly good evidence of that.",4,Good hopes for Radcliffe in a post-POTTER world.,1340150400,"06 20, 2012",2012,4059,"['nice', 'have', 'Hammer', 'Studios', 'back', 'making', 'horror', 'films', 'was', 'stuff', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'creature-features', 'Saturday', 'afternoons', 'actors', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'Ingrid', 'Pitt', 'stable', 'stars', 'low-budget', 'sensibility', 'particular', 'affinity', 'day-for-night', 'shooting', 'busty', 'ladies', 'tight', 'corsets', 'pea-soup-thick', 'atmosphere.However', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'not', 'quite', 'horror', 'film', 'supernatural', 'mystery', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'have', 'tightly-corseted', 'ladies', 'as', 'far', 'atmosphere', 'cup', 'runneth', 'Endless', 'mist', 'sunless', 'days', 'torrential', 'rain', 'candlelit', 'hallways', 'always', 'something', 'lurking', 'back', 'frame.The', 'plot', 'film', 'very', 'standard', 'turn-of-the-20th-century', 'haunted', 'village', 'story', 'young', 'widower', 'Radcliffe', 'very', 'mature', 'performance', 'sent', 'behalf', 'law', 'firm', 'clear', 'up', 'estate', 'wealthy', 'recluse', 'remote', 'British', 'town', 'villagers', 'town', 'want', 'gone', 'unknown', 'reasons', 'old', 'mansion', 'called', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'nice', 'place', ""n't"", 'uncovers', 'unearthly', 'presence', 'mystery', 'been', 'taking', 'lives', 'children', 'years', 'own', 'child', 'coming', 'visit', 'help', 'kindly', 'man', 'always', 'great', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'troubled', 'wife', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'great', 'small', 'role', 'give', 'ghost', 'what', 'end', 'reign', 'terror.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'little', 'leery', 'ghost', 'films', 'cause', 'haunting', 'usually', 'far', 'too', 'mundane', 'always', 'wishing', 'not', 'such', 'mystery', 'why', 'happening', 'rather', 'just', 'have', 'HAPPEN', 'greater', 'mystery', 'discomfort', 'viewer', 'ask', 'questions', 'film', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'WHAT', 'LIES', 'BENEATH', 'also', 'bit', 'problem', 'here', 'nicely', 'twisted', 'ending', 'find', 'solution', 'mystery', ""n't"", 'enough.Radcliffe', 'really', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'wonderful', 'see', 'really', 'embrace', 'role', 'someone', 'who', 'very', 'wounded', 'deep', 'soul', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'willing', 'explore', 'world', 'unknown', 'searching', 'answers', 'Hinds', 'once', 'again', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'only', 'man', 'village', 'who', 'be', 'unafraid', 'what', 'Radcliffe', 'character', 'doing', 'deeper', 'weariness', 'Hinds', 'revealed', 'later', 'McTeer', 'wonderfully', 'manic', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'loony', 'still-grieving', 'mother', 'child', 'long', 'dead.This', 'film', 'embraces', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'favor', 'blood', 'shock', 'keeping', 'tradition', 'Hammer', 'Studios', 'well', 'are', 'three', 'four', 'really', 'cheap', 'effective', 'jump', 'scares', 'first', 'act', 'honestly', 'first', 'film', 'years', 'actually', 'did', 'feel', 'heart', 'skip', 'moments', 'Once', 'calms', 'down', 'cheap', 'scares', 'make', 'way', 'sense', 'genuine', 'dread', 'something', 'director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'pretty', 'deftly', 'Most', 'film', 'very', 'quiet', 'frightening', 'noises', 'come', 'quiet', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'also', 'adept', 'framing', 'shots', 'Many', 'moments', 'film', 'look', 'could', 'be', 'gothic-era', 'paintings.Sadly', 'film', 'pretty', 'sluggish', 'third', 'act', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'found', 'solution', 'desires', 'spectre', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'sate', 'desires', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'adult', 'appeal', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'rather', 'film', 'actions', 'consequences', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'had', 'make', 'more', 'teen-friendly', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'roles', 'are', 'far', 'off', 'Radcliffe', 'having', 'done', 'play', 'extremely', 'dark', 'EQUUS', 'suit', 'seemingly', 'perennial', ""five-o'clock"", 'shadow', 'intense', 'piercing', 'eyes.Radcliffe', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'franchises', 'time', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'eventually', 'become', 'star', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'decidedly', 'good', 'evidence']",The Woman in Black

Take, for instance, the children. Out of all the suspicious behavior, it's the children who suffer the most (sounds Old Testament to me, whatwith how it says anything bad happens in society, no matter what, the children get it before anyone else), the easiest to influence to committ suicide. Extremely dark for a PG-13 flick, especially when some of it is implied and only one is overtly seen and is not so subtle. Why would a spirit committ children to do unspeakable tragedies upon themselves? Watch and find out, if you can handle creepy vibes, cliched jump tricks done effectively (several were predictable yet still got me), and a fervent characterization in Daniel Radcliffe's character with his interaction with everyone (especially the one villager to actually try to help him out rather than try to scare him off).Though, it's not only the jumps and spirits that can cause uneasy creeps. There's also the local surroundings. And not just the paranoid stares of everyone who lays eyes on Radcliffe, there's also the structure of the mansion itself, which is downright jarring with the antiques, wallpaper, displace lighting, etc. The mansion itself is like a character that adds subtle unease and has secrets of its own.And the history behind the woman in black herself?

1464736,AI1VD7QWKM0V1,B005LAIGOQ,Jessica Winney,"[1, 1]","For years I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of the 1989 made-for-TV version of The Woman in Black, which is both very expensive and very difficult to find on DVD, so when I heard that they were making another film version, I was initially excited to finally have the opportunity to see a version of The Woman in Black on film.  I was, however, also concerned that there would be changes to the plot and deviations from the original novel that would serve to ""Hollywoodify"" the story.  After watching this new version with Daniel Radcliffe, I can say that my fears were confirmed.  There were numerous changes to the story that took it in some wildly different directions than what the author Susan Hill probably intended, and these changes did not improve the story.  One of the best things about the novel is its restraint.  It is heavy on atmosphere and psychological tension and light on the stuff of typical horror stories, i.e. dead bodies, blood and guts, psycho behavior, possessed people, etc.  While this film does retain the spooky and ominous atmosphere present in the novel, there were so many changes to story that I often thought I was seeing a completely different story.The novel begins with Arthur Kipps as an older, remarried man recounting the story of his dealings with the Woman in Black and how they led to the deaths of his first wife and young son when he was a young man working at a law firm.  His first encounter with the Woman in Black occurs at Alice Drablow's funeral.  He is sent there as a representative of the law firm and initially thinks the Woman in Black is a mourner.  I was really hoping to see this scene dramatized, but the film completely alters the novel's structure.  The two biggest changes that I absolutely could not get past were the scenes where Arthur Kipps and Samuel Daily manage to pull the sunken carriage containing the body of Jennet Humfrye's son out of the marshes (like they would really be able to do this), then take the child's corpse back to Eel Marsh house in an attempt to reunite Jennet Humfrye and her son (this never happens in the book and is completely unbelievable), and of course the corny ending where Arthur Kipps and his son are killed by an oncoming train after the son is lured onto the tracks by the Woman in Black, then they are both reunited with Arthur Kipps' dead wife at the very end.  This was the Hollywood shocker ending that I was afraid this film would receive.  In the novel, Arthur Kipps' wife and son are killed by the Woman in Black, but Arthur remains alive, and their deaths do not involve a train.  The ending is shocking, but there is no reuniting with anybody in the afterlife.  My mother and I both watched this film together and when it was over, my mother said to me, ""It could have been so much more than it was.""

1464737,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B005LAIGOQ,J from NY,"[2, 2]","James Watkins' ""The Woman In Black"" is a superb, bone-chilling return to the freezy tradition of Hammer Studios.  Daniel Radcliffe (of ""Harry Potter"" fame) turns in a fine performance as London lawyer Arthur Kipps.  An impoverished father haunted by the loss of his wife during childbirth, his employer gives him a make-or-break assignment by sending him to the remote village of Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow.Mrs. Drawblow was a disturbed woman.  Her child was lost tragically, not unlike the protagonists', by drowning in a marsh.  The locals are particularly unreceptive to Mr. Kipps' presence and he is shunned by all but one man, determined to help him see the job through.The pacing and atmosphere of this movie are damn near perfect.  Reminiscent of much of Hammer's later work (From Beyond the Grave), the cobwebs and impoverished area add to the suspense.  What really clinched it for me were the scenes in which Kipps is alone in Mrs. Drablow's house and reads her letters, the scary voice overdubbing and the creepy puppets moving all at the same time.  One thinks of a malevolent Emily Dickinson or something, it's just really fantastic.The only problem I had was with the ending.  While I won't spoil it for anyone, they should have let it happen raw without the fluffernutter.

I reviewed that movie last July and gave it 4 stars.  This remake is actually better than the original, a rare feat.  From my experience, usually remakes of horror movies are nowhere near as good as the original.  This is an exception.The things that this movie have going for it are the dark, chilling, spooky atmosphere and the genuine creepiness of the haunted house from the Victorian era.  You'll see classic components of a haunted house - cobwebs, paintings hanging on the walls, lit candles, a rocking chair rocking by itself, creepy looking dolls, music box melodies, and of course ghosts.  Throw in the thunderstorm and the movie feels complete.  This is definitely one of the creepiest and best ghost story movies I've ever seen.  There are a lot of sudden scares that might make you jump out of your seat.  There is an occasional dose of comic relief sprinkled throughout the movie.  The musical score by Marco Beltrami is decent.This movie was my introduction to Daniel Radcliffe (I've never seen the Harry Potter movies).  He does a commendable job acting.

1464746,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005LAIGOQ,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","Ghost stories are quite popular in England, probably because the weather and the winters give an optimal spooky atmosphere. The Woman in Black is just such a ghost story. It was first a novel, then made into a TV movie, a stage play, and two radio dramas before the release of this cinema version (which I saw on DVD).The story follows Arthur Kipps (played by Daniel Radcliffe), a young, widowed lawyer who has a four-year old son. He is still troubled by the loss of his wife. That has affected his work. The law firm sends him off to the North to settle the estate of Alice Drablow. She lived in Eel Marsh House at the end of Nine Lives Causeway. The causeway is only navigable at low tide. The house is full of paperwork that needs sorting to ensure the law firm's copy of her will is indeed the current one. This is Kipps last chance to prove he is serious about working for the firm. If he does not do well, he will be fired.He takes a train up to the town of Crynith Gifford. He meets a local man, Samuel Daily, who is quite rich (he owns the only car for miles and miles) and is friendly enough. The rest of the town is not so friendly because of the house's bad history and the local legend of the Woman in Black. She is mostly seen either by the house or on the causeway, but occasionally in town. Whenever she is seen, soon thereafter a child dies. Typically the death is a quite horrible one. Naturally the townfolk don't want anyone around the house. Kipps insists on going (to keep his job). As he researches through the papers, he uncovers information about the Woman in Black. Oh yeah, and strange noises and apparitions start happening too. And his son is supposed to come up on the weekend for a holiday!The movie centers on Kipps. It follows his investigation of the paperwork just enough to reveal the identity and motives of the Woman in Black. His character is well developed. His motives for staying are sensible enough and he is likeable enough that the viewer actually cares what happens to him. Developing an intelligent, sympathetic main character is critical in this type of movie. Radcliffe gives a great performance, subtle and nuanced without hysterics. He makes it more chilling.Much of the film shows him wandering through the house trying to look around corners for what just made that noise or what he just saw out of the corner of his eye. Plenty of cobwebs, dark corners, and creepy children's toys are made even more ominous by the low-key but highly evocative score. The atmosphere is great and delivers plenty of goosebumps. The story is interesting enough and the various twists are only occasionally predictable and always effective.The Woman in Black is a classic example of a haunted house movie, ranking with the best in that genre (The Uninvited, The Haunting, and The Changeling being the best).",5,Great Haunted House Chiller,1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,2841,"['Ghost', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'popular', 'England', 'probably', 'weather', 'winters', 'give', 'optimal', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'Woman', 'Black', 'just', 'such', 'ghost', 'story', 'was', 'first', 'novel', 'then', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'stage', 'play', 'two', 'radio', 'dramas', 'release', 'cinema', 'version', 'saw', 'DVD', '.The', 'story', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'played', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'young', 'widowed', 'lawyer', 'who', 'four-year', 'old', 'son', 'still', 'troubled', 'loss', 'wife', 'affected', 'work', 'law', 'firm', 'off', 'North', 'settle', 'estate', 'Alice', 'Drablow', 'lived', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'end', 'Nine', 'Causeway', 'causeway', 'only', 'navigable', 'low', 'tide', 'house', 'full', 'paperwork', 'sorting', 'ensure', 'law', 'firm', 'copy', 'will', 'indeed', 'current', 'one', 'Kipps', 'last', 'chance', 'prove', 'serious', 'working', 'firm', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'fired.He', 'train', 'up', 'town', 'Crynith', 'Gifford', 'local', 'man', 'Samuel', 'Daily', 'who', 'quite', 'rich', 'only', 'car', 'miles', 'miles', 'friendly', 'enough', 'rest', 'town', 'not', 'so', 'friendly', 'house', 'bad', 'history', 'local', 'legend', 'Woman', 'Black', 'mostly', 'seen', 'house', 'causeway', 'occasionally', 'town', 'Whenever', 'seen', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'child', 'Typically', 'death', 'quite', 'horrible', 'one', 'Naturally', 'townfolk', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'house', 'Kipps', 'going', 'keep', 'job', 'papers', 'information', 'Woman', 'Black', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'strange', 'noises', 'apparitions', 'start', 'happening', 'too', 'son', 'supposed', 'come', 'up', 'weekend', 'holiday', 'movie', 'centers', 'Kipps', 'investigation', 'paperwork', 'just', 'enough', 'reveal', 'identity', 'motives', 'Woman', 'Black', 'character', 'well', 'developed', 'motives', 'staying', 'are', 'sensible', 'enough', 'likeable', 'enough', 'viewer', 'actually', 'what', 'Developing', 'intelligent', 'sympathetic', 'main', 'character', 'critical', 'type', 'movie', 'Radcliffe', 'great', 'performance', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'hysterics', 'more', 'chilling.Much', 'film', 'wandering', 'house', 'trying', 'look', 'around', 'corners', 'what', 'just', 'made', 'noise', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'corner', 'eye', 'Plenty', 'cobwebs', 'dark', 'corners', 'children', 'toys', 'are', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'ominous', 'low-key', 'highly', 'evocative', 'score', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'delivers', 'plenty', 'goosebumps', 'story', 'interesting', 'enough', 'various', 'twists', 'are', 'only', 'occasionally', 'predictable', 'always', 'effective.The', 'Woman', 'Black', 'classic', 'example', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'ranking', 'best', 'genre', 'Uninvited', 'Haunting', 'Changeling', 'being', 'best']",The Woman in Black

1464749,A18XJHKGIPRDNU,B005LAIGOQ,"Juan Roman ""jroma""","[5, 13]","Having read the book twice, and seen the BBC 1989 movie version several times,I was entertaining high hopes with this new version of one of my favorite Gothic-horror stories.I was hoping that a more generous budget would do full honors to this little jewel of  the Gothic-horror genre. Although the 1989 version proved that intelligent choices in directing can overcome many obstacles, including a low budget. On the other hand I also was a little fearful about this movie falling prey to today's curse on horror movies:succumbing to the temptation of drowning the story in computerized, cheap special effects, resulting in tons of cheap-gore and gallons of blood, and Disney-like ghouls and monsters.As it has been mentioned here by other critics, changing the story a little is not a crucial problem when the essential elements are kept,and respected.The 1989 film version did a few changes, but the story plot was there, and it could be followed at a real pace.The script was intelligent and it worked.But this is another story...I went to see this new movie at a classic movie house from the 50s,restored and with a big screen.I wanted to do full honors to this new version.But,as the movie progressed,the horrific truth was evident, my worst fears were materializing in front of my eyes.There was no real story-plot to follow.I was in for a Blackberry generation version of The Woman in Black. It was to fast-paced to be nothing but a video-game,the scenes kept moving forward,as if slashed with a machete,unable to create a story line.And finally, when I was confronted with the exaggerated and ridiculous ""house on the marsh"" of this version, I knew I was watching a pathetic blend of 'The Adam's Family meets Stephen King' for the blackberry generation.From there on it was downhill, a movie predictably drowned in unnecessary and exaggerated special effects such as the bleeding-bed, and a woman in black so unsubstantial that it looked more like a Japanese-anime figure running amok the Adam's family house.The end was not only too much of a travesty,but a corny and childish idea,unworthy of Susan Hill's work.For those unfamiliar with good literature, or a good reading, this 'video-game' version might do.But for those who are familiar with real stories and good scripts, my recommendation is:AVOID this waste of money and time like you would the plague.For me this was THE WASTE OF A GOOD CHANCE...If you want your intelligence to be respected, stick to the 1989 BBC version.It might be too slow for those whose attention span can not survive anything beyond 60-seconds bytes,or nothing deeper than a video-game plot,but for those able to enjoy true suspense and a good literary build-up of the plot, the story IS THERE,and its good!If you like classic Gothic horror stories, with well written scripts and literary style, I recommend movies like:The Changeling,Haunted!The Reincarnation of Peter Proud,The Uninvited,and even The House Where Evil Dwells. And the wonderful literary ghost stories of Japanese films like KWAIDAN and Ugetsu,",1,the waste of a good chance,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,3051,"['Having', 'read', 'book', 'twice', 'seen', 'BBC', '1989', 'movie', 'version', 'several', 'times', 'was', 'entertaining', 'high', 'hopes', 'new', 'version', 'one', 'favorite', 'Gothic-horror', 'stories.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'generous', 'budget', 'would', 'do', 'full', 'honors', 'little', 'jewel', 'Gothic-horror', 'genre', '1989', 'version', 'proved', 'intelligent', 'choices', 'directing', 'can', 'overcome', 'many', 'obstacles', 'including', 'low', 'budget', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'was', 'little', 'fearful', 'movie', 'falling', 'prey', 'today', 'curse', 'horror', 'movies', 'succumbing', 'temptation', 'drowning', 'story', 'computerized', 'cheap', 'special', 'effects', 'resulting', 'tons', 'cheap-gore', 'gallons', 'blood', 'Disney-like', 'ghouls', 'monsters.As', 'been', 'mentioned', 'here', 'other', 'critics', 'changing', 'story', 'little', 'not', 'crucial', 'problem', 'when', 'essential', 'elements', 'are', 'kept', 'respected.The', '1989', 'film', 'version', 'did', 'few', 'changes', 'story', 'plot', 'was', 'there', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'real', 'pace.The', 'script', 'was', 'intelligent', 'story', 'went', 'see', 'new', 'movie', 'classic', 'movie', 'house', '50s', 'restored', 'big', 'screen.I', 'wanted', 'do', 'full', 'honors', 'new', 'version.But', 'movie', 'progressed', 'horrific', 'truth', 'was', 'evident', 'worst', 'fears', 'were', 'materializing', 'front', 'eyes.There', 'was', 'real', 'story-plot', 'follow.I', 'was', 'Blackberry', 'generation', 'version', 'Woman', 'Black', 'was', 'fast-paced', 'be', 'nothing', 'video-game', 'scenes', 'kept', 'moving', 'forward', 'slashed', 'machete', 'unable', 'create', 'story', 'line.And', 'finally', 'when', 'was', 'confronted', 'exaggerated', 'ridiculous', 'house', 'marsh', 'version', 'knew', 'was', 'watching', 'pathetic', 'blend', ""'The"", 'Adam', 'Family', 'Stephen', 'King', 'blackberry', 'generation.From', 'there', 'was', 'downhill', 'movie', 'predictably', 'drowned', 'unnecessary', 'exaggerated', 'special', 'effects', 'such', 'bleeding-bed', 'woman', 'black', 'so', 'unsubstantial', 'looked', 'more', 'Japanese-anime', 'figure', 'running', 'Adam', 'family', 'house.The', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'too', 'much', 'travesty', 'corny', 'childish', 'idea', 'unworthy', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'work.For', 'unfamiliar', 'good', 'literature', 'good', 'reading', ""'video-game"", 'version', 'might', 'do.But', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'real', 'stories', 'good', 'scripts', 'recommendation', 'AVOID', 'waste', 'money', 'time', 'would', 'plague.For', 'was', 'WASTE', 'A', 'GOOD', 'CHANCE', 'want', 'intelligence', 'be', 'respected', 'stick', '1989', 'BBC', 'version.It', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'slow', 'attention', 'span', 'can', 'not', 'survive', 'anything', '60-seconds', 'bytes', 'nothing', 'deeper', 'video-game', 'plot', 'able', 'enjoy', 'true', 'suspense', 'good', 'literary', 'build-up', 'plot', 'story', 'IS', 'THERE', 'good', 'like', 'classic', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'stories', 'well', 'written', 'scripts', 'literary', 'style', 'recommend', 'movies', 'Changeling', 'Haunted', 'Reincarnation', 'Peter', 'Proud', 'Uninvited', 'even', 'House', 'Where', 'Evil', 'Dwells', 'wonderful', 'literary', 'ghost', 'stories', 'Japanese', 'films', 'KWAIDAN', 'Ugetsu']",The Woman in Black

He finds the villagers oddly hostile, but sets about his work in the woman's creepy, old house. There, he begins to unravel the story of a mysterious woman believed to haunt the place.If you're looking for a scary movie, look no further. There are scares every few minutes once Arthur starts (stupidly) exploring the house, endlessly going from dark room to dark room while the eerie music and sound effects build to get-ready-to-shriek-levels. The movie has little dialogue, with Arthur alone most of the time just looking for the ghost.This kind of alone-in-the-house part is usually played by a beautiful, helpless, young woman but Radcliffe does a good job, coming off as serious, mature, and fairly brave. If you saw the movie without sound, it wouldn't be nearly as frightening, so a great deal of credit must go to the music and sound effects. Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is good in a rather undemanding, supporting role. The titular character disappointingly resembles a mannequin in a high school haunted house.The movie makes the most out of people' primal fear of the dark and genuine shocks come on a regular (one might say, predictable) basis. I found the movie just a bit unsatisfying, though, because Arthur's character is so wooden and stoic and the story is unrelentingly unpleasant. 3.5 stars.",4,Spooky,1328572800,"02 7, 2012",2012,1455,"['early', '1900s', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'sent', 'remote', 'village', 'go', 'papers', 'recently', 'deceased', 'old', 'woman', 'villagers', 'oddly', 'hostile', 'sets', 'work', 'woman', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'unravel', 'story', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'believed', 'haunt', 'place.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'scary', 'movie', 'look', 'further', 'are', 'scares', 'few', 'minutes', 'once', 'Arthur', 'starts', 'stupidly', 'exploring', 'house', 'endlessly', 'going', 'dark', 'room', 'dark', 'room', 'eerie', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'build', 'get-ready-to-shriek-levels', 'movie', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Arthur', 'alone', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'looking', 'ghost.This', 'kind', 'alone-in-the-house', 'part', 'usually', 'played', 'beautiful', 'helpless', 'young', 'woman', 'Radcliffe', 'good', 'job', 'coming', 'off', 'serious', 'mature', 'fairly', 'brave', 'saw', 'movie', 'sound', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'frightening', 'great', 'deal', 'credit', 'must', 'go', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'good', 'rather', 'undemanding', 'supporting', 'role', 'titular', 'character', 'disappointingly', 'mannequin', 'high', 'school', 'haunted', 'house.The', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'primal', 'fear', 'dark', 'genuine', 'shocks', 'come', 'regular', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'predictable', 'basis', 'found', 'movie', 'just', 'bit', 'unsatisfying', 'though', 'Arthur', 'character', 'so', 'wooden', 'stoic', 'story', 'unrelentingly', 'unpleasant', '3.5', 'stars']",The Woman in Black

Yes things will jump out at you but not so often that you want to stop watching.The Woman in Black is a supernatural thriller in all the right ways.

He is to investigate the estate of a woman who died who apparently had quite a bit of paperwork in her mansion located a few miles out of town. The people of the town are uneasy and unwelcoming when Kipps arrives, they try to make him leave before his work is complete. It appears to be some sort of conspiracy until more is revealed about the town's residents. They have all lost children to an unknown force which is somehow associated with the mansion left behind by the dead woman. Kipps presence in the town awakens the horror inflicted on the town by the woman in black.I've watched this movie a few times since I first saw it and it still hasn't lost its appeal.

Daniel Radcliffe is struggling not to be typecast, to establish himself as an adult actor, not an easy accomplishment for any child star. Radcliffe does a creditable job in this movie. A classic, gothic horror story, it contains scary elements without resorting to the gory, shlocky slasher stuff of recent decades. As Arthur Kipps, the young lawyer devastated by his wife's childbed death, he has little to do other than to act wary and frightened, and appear foolhardy enough to go where no sane person ever would. This film has many strengths, among them the perfect dark, eerie sets, the cinematography that lends a sense of black and white to what is actually a color production, and enough of a mystery to make the viewer wonder what's going on in the forbidding town to which Arthur is sent to work. Along with him, we figure out, step by step, exactly what motivates the black veiled apparition, and along with him, we trust that he'll be able to put her to rest.But there are weaknesses as well. It becomes a bit tiresome to follow Arthur through the dismal corridors of the haunted mansion, armed as he is with only a candle and an axe. Too much reliance is placed upon the sudden shocking revelation, which the audience learns to anticipate. The most effective scene takes place outside the estate, at a family crypt where Arthur encounters the distraught mother of a dead child. Most of the supporting actors have little to do other than to look forbidding and threatening, but Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer are superb in there roles as the grieving couple who, alone amongst their neighbors, offer some support to Arthur. The ending is a true shocker.As is typical, the screenplay is substantially different from the novel upon which it is based, so watch the movie as a separate entity. It's worth a look.

There are long hallway shots in the haunted mansion that mimic Kubrick's corridors in that mammoth hotel in The Shining, shots that should build even more dread and anticipation than they do. The rooms are filled with so many oddities and antiques (someone really had a thing about monkeys, perhaps a homage to those flying terrors from the ""Wizard of Oz"") that these inanimate curiosities stole the scenes from the actors.The actors---chiefly the male leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds---all seem to be walking through the sets as though they had been dropped into a carnival fun house and left to improvise reactions and lines. The ghostly woman in black startles more than she frightens, and most of the remaining characters seem stricken with dread and grief, making one wonder why they did not leave this dreadful place.The plot trajectory, alas, moved in a straightforward, if slow, line to the inevitable conclusion, which suggests that the studio was more interested in potential sequels than telling a good story the first time out.",2,Seems more about setting the stage for sequels than telling a good story,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,1460,"['atmosphere', 'infusing', 'scene', 'setting', 'Woman', 'Black', 'so', 'heavy', 'unrelenting', 'smothering', 'hard', 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'delve', 'story', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'unrelentingly', 'audience', 'intention', 'thick', 'slathering', 'motif', 'artifice', 'lighting', 'gloom.Yes', 'ghost', 'story', 'horror', 'tale', 'should', 'be', 'frightening', 'are', 'long', 'hallway', 'shots', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'mimic', 'Kubrick', 'corridors', 'mammoth', 'hotel', 'Shining', 'shots', 'should', 'build', 'even', 'more', 'dread', 'anticipation', 'do', 'rooms', 'are', 'filled', 'so', 'many', 'oddities', 'antiques', 'someone', 'really', 'had', 'thing', 'monkeys', 'perhaps', 'homage', 'flying', 'terrors', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'inanimate', 'curiosities', 'stole', 'scenes', 'actors.The', 'actors', '-chiefly', 'male', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', '-all', 'seem', 'be', 'walking', 'sets', 'had', 'been', 'dropped', 'carnival', 'fun', 'house', 'left', 'improvise', 'reactions', 'lines', 'ghostly', 'woman', 'black', 'startles', 'more', 'most', 'remaining', 'characters', 'seem', 'stricken', 'dread', 'grief', 'making', 'one', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'dreadful', 'place.The', 'plot', 'trajectory', 'alas', 'moved', 'straightforward', 'slow', 'line', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'studio', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'potential', 'sequels', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'out']",The Woman in Black

Can Daniel Radcliffe break from the Harry Potter characterhe has portrayed for so long? Ladies and Gentleman after viewing the Woman inBlack I can safely say............Yes.The effects in this movie are simple and practical; there wasn't much, ifany, CG that I could see and I am very open to that. The effects work and theydo their job in combination with the atmosphere of the movie to scare thefreaking pants of you. The movie does not go for jump scares, also known as the""OMG CAT"" scares, or if you are me, jump startles, but instead slowlybuilds it up and relying heavily on the atmosphere to scare you when the ghostdoes show its face. Part of the beauty is you never know for sure when thescares are coming.I seriously cannot think of a single complaint I have with this movie.People looking for a high body count and gore for the sake of gore, you knowlike Saw, will not find it here. the movie relies on suspense to create fear inhis audience. It scares you and creates a knot in your stomach that doesn'thave to do with making you sick or disturbed from the amount of blood onscreen.

1464781,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIGOQ,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","If you're like me you grew up watching horror films made by Hammer Studios. These were not your run of the mill horror films but classily made films that featured some of the classic horror icons like Dracula and Frankenstein but in more of a gothic location. This was a world of castles and mansions, of men dressed in fine clothing and women in low cut laced gowns. The horror films made by Hammer had style and class and a certain amount of eeriness to them instead of gore. The studio fell on hard times but is in the midst of a return and their first major entry is a grand one called THE WOMAN IN BLACK.It's the turn of the century and Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is at his wits end. A solicitor by trade Kipps has fallen on hard times, having great difficulty in dealing with the death of his wife several years earlier during childbirth. His son has grown but Kipps' melancholia remains these years later. So much so that he's fallen on hard times. The firm he works for gives Kipps a last chance to redeem himself by sending him to the small town of Cryphin Gifford to the Eel Marsh House where the estate of Mrs. Drablow, a recently deceased woman, must be settled. Kipps heads out hoping to reunite with his son and his nanny on the weekend.On his train ride to the town Kipps meets a gentleman by the name of Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds). Sam is also en route to the same location and offers Kipps a ride to the local inn. But what greets Kipps when he enters is not what he expected: a cold shoulder from all but the inn keeper's wife who offers him a small room in the attic. He receives more of the same when he contacts the local solicitor who's been handling the affairs of the estate. Given the brush off and a carriage to take him to the train station, he pays the man to take him to the estate itself.If the creepy factor weren't already oozing off the screen it does so in spades as Kipps makes his way to the estate. The mansion is located on a small island with a causeway that twists and turns up to it. All along nothing but the marsh can be seen, a gooey water trap if ever there was one, with plenty of sea beyond. The tides rise and close off the causeway throughout the day and the carriage driver agrees to return later to take Kipps to Sam's house for a dinner invitation.Walking on to the house Kipps is greeted by the best of gothic sights, a mansion in disrepair covered with vines on the outside and cobwebs within. He lights some candles and gathers what paperwork he finds and begins working. But noises within the house cause him to stop and seek what is creating the sounds. As Kipps passes from one room to another, we have the chance to see the woman in black as her spectral image lingers over Kipps without allowing him to see her. She's everywhere yet nowhere in this house and the director of the film does a fine job in creating the atmosphere of her presence without seeing her at all times.Kipps eventually goes to dinner at Sam's and meet's his wife. She begins to tell him things that will lead him to discover the truth behind the town's fright and the reason they want him gone. Her tale and other clues lead Kipps to find out about the sister of the Mrs. Drablow who was sent away while her son was adopted by Drablow and her husband. On a trip home one night, their carriage slid into the marsh and the boy was drowned, his body never recovered. Now when the woman in black is seen a child in the town dies.Kipps continues his work, dealing with both the house and its foreboding inhabitant and continuing to deal with the loss of his wife. The intrusion of the woman in black in his business as well as the lives of others becomes too much and he seeks a way to appease her and put her soul to rest. This becomes all the more important as he has no way of reaching his son en route to the town to possibly be her next victim.The movie does a wonderful job of offering us teasing scares that never go over the top. The chilling moments are found from start to finish, the locale's offering the feelings that something bad is going to happen and the acting complements the storytelling that delivers chills rather than one jump scene after another (though there are those). Best of all is seeing Radcliffe in a role other than Harry Potter, proving that there is a chance of his becoming an actor that can handle more than the namesake that brought him to attention.The movie is one of the old time scare films that doesn't rely on gore, doesn't rely on a hatchet wielding menace or a nightmare creation that sucks out your soul as you sleep. This is good old fashioned ghost story that makes your skin crawl while you wait for the next scare and that's a good thing to see.

This lushly filmed ghost story, set in a remote English village in Edwardian times, does precisely what it sets out to do, which is to provide a steady stream of gasp-inducing thrills to its audience. Daniel Radcliffe is a few years too young to play Arthur Kipps--grieving widower, failing lawyer and father to a four-year-old son--who goes to sort out the tangled estate at creepy Eel Marsh House in a last-ditch attempt to save his career. But Radcliffe gives a solid and convincing performance nonetheless, as do Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as a local couple who know more than they're saying about the mysterious title character, who appears in the cemetery next to the house at unexpected moments. The thrills, when they start coming, come pretty much nonstop, and Watkins & Co. deserve credit for remembering a cinematic truth too often forgotten these days: what you don't see is scarier than what you do.As good as the new ""Woman in Black"" is, however, I still prefer the old TV version directed twenty-odd years ago by Herbert Wise. The basic story of the two versions is the same, but the details are somewhat different. In particular, the older version is bleaker, more hypnotic, and ultimately more tragic than the newer. The story in the older version builds more slowly, and the shocks are fewer, which many viewers undoubtedly wouldn't like. But the slower buildup allows the story's horror to creep more firmly into your bones, and the shocks--when they come--are the most powerful I can think of in any horror movie.Unfortunately, the studio that made the new version has withdrawn the old one from distribution, so that it cannot be exhibited or sold anywhere. The old DVDs, when you can find them, fetch $100 or more apiece. Fans, however, are still willing to pay that. It may be that many viewers, seeing both versions, would still prefer the newer. All I hope is that soon the studio will re-release the old version and allow viewers to judge for themselves.",4,"A perfectly decent ghost movie, but...",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,2082,"['Most', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'see', 'James', 'Watkins', 'Woman', 'Black', 'will', 'be', 'perfectly', 'satisfied', 'lushly', 'filmed', 'ghost', 'story', 'set', 'remote', 'English', 'village', 'Edwardian', 'times', 'precisely', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'provide', 'steady', 'stream', 'gasp-inducing', 'thrills', 'audience', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'few', 'years', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'grieving', 'widower', 'failing', 'lawyer', 'father', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'who', 'sort', 'out', 'tangled', 'estate', 'creepy', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'last-ditch', 'attempt', 'save', 'career', 'Radcliffe', 'solid', 'convincing', 'performance', 'nonetheless', 'do', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Janet', 'McTeer', 'local', 'couple', 'who', 'more', ""'re"", 'saying', 'mysterious', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'cemetery', 'house', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'thrills', 'when', 'start', 'coming', 'come', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonstop', 'Watkins', 'Co.', 'deserve', 'credit', 'remembering', 'cinematic', 'truth', 'too', 'often', 'forgotten', 'days', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'scarier', 'what', 'do.As', 'good', 'new', 'Woman', 'Black', 'however', 'still', 'prefer', 'old', 'TV', 'version', 'directed', 'twenty-odd', 'years', 'ago', 'Herbert', 'Wise', 'basic', 'story', 'two', 'versions', 'same', 'details', 'are', 'somewhat', 'different', 'particular', 'older', 'version', 'bleaker', 'more', 'hypnotic', 'ultimately', 'more', 'tragic', 'newer', 'story', 'older', 'version', 'more', 'slowly', 'shocks', 'are', 'fewer', 'many', 'viewers', 'undoubtedly', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'slower', 'buildup', 'story', 'horror', 'creep', 'more', 'firmly', 'bones', 'shocks', 'when', 'come', 'are', 'most', 'powerful', 'can', 'think', 'horror', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'studio', 'made', 'new', 'version', 'withdrawn', 'old', 'one', 'distribution', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'exhibited', 'sold', 'anywhere', 'old', 'DVDs', 'when', 'can', 'find', 'fetch', '100', 'more', 'apiece', 'Fans', 'however', 'are', 'still', 'willing', 'pay', 'may', 'be', 'many', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'versions', 'would', 'still', 'prefer', 'newer', 'hope', 'soon', 'studio', 'will', 're-release', 'old', 'version', 'allow', 'viewers', 'judge']",The Woman in Black

1464808,AMX4202M7D7HV,B005LAIGOQ,"M. Secaur ""Meredith Secaur""","[4, 6]","To tell the truth, I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, excluding the classic Universal monster films from the 20's and 30'; but especially not modern horror, with people being tortured and slashed to ribbons and all that (why so many people seem to love that stuff is beyond me). That being said, I found ""The Woman in Black"" to be a masterpiece of Gothic horror, simply overflowing with psychological terror and creepiness; in short, an old-fashioned ghost story for the 21st century.Susan Hill's wonderfully atmospheric novel is what sold me on the idea of this film in the first place. Before that, I could have easily passed this off as just another disgusting horror movie under the guise of a ghost story. The film's production company, Hammer, was best known throughout the 50's and 60's for producing genuinely scary horror films with lots of gore and blood. With the company's decline in the 1980's, it seemed that they, like so many other studios, would just go out of business, but in 2008, they were revived. ""The Woman in Black"" is the first ghost story that they have ever produced, and for their first supernatural outing, they didn't do too shabby.Moody and foreboding from the very first scene, the story concerns Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer from London who is sent by his firm to the rural Yorkshire town of Crythin Gifford with the purpose of settling the estate of a recently deceased client, Mrs. Alice Drablow. From the first moment he arrives there is a sense that something sinister is going to happen: The village is separated from the mainland by a causeway which floods over at high tide, and the house itself, Eel Marsh house, is surrounded by a mysterious bog that holds many secrets, some darker than others. As he catches his first glimpses of the woman in black herself, children in the village begin dying violent and unexpected deaths, caused by apparent suicide. Arthur's job suddenly takes a more serious turn as he begins to uncover the secret behind the mysterious hauntings and the true identity of the one woman who seems to be behind it all.While I found several additions by screenwriter Jane Goldman to be a little wanton (Zombie children wandering the marshes, two very graphic death scenes, a ghostly reenactment of a suicide, some very creepy Victorian wind-up toys, and a rather mad Mrs. Daily who rears her two pet Chihuahuas like children and claims to channel the spirit of her dead son), the film stays very true to the Hill's book and faithfully brings that same unsettling, suspenseful atmosphere to the big screen. There is no doubt for fans of the novel that this is the definitive adaptation, far surpassing the 1989 BBC version.Perfectly evoking the flavor of the old dark house pictures from glory days of cinematic horror, it's a great example of what all good ghost stories should have: things that bump, creak and rock for no apparent reason, flitting shadows, flickering candles, bone-chilling shrieks, and enough thrills and jump-scares to keep you leaping from you seat whether you want to or not. As the film progresses, the scares keep building, so that by the time you get to the real chills, you're so worked up from anticipating what's coming that you are, to put it mildly, scared right out of your wits.  A handful of scenes aside, this film is wonderfully old-fashioned in its simplicity, psychological effectiveness, and lack of gore. The real scares are built on our fears of the unknown and the fact that what you can't see or don't know is oftentimes scarier than what you can. Sure, there are some really creepy things that you'd have to be blind as a bat to miss, but I find that the moments of almost oppressive silence are the most nerve-wracking of all, a good example being early on in the film when Arthur is exploring the house, alone -- no dialogue, no screams -- just the nail-biting experience of not knowing what's going to be around the next corner. The fact that this is so frightening is even more amazing when you realize that most of this sequence takes place in broad daylight!Shot in a predominantly monochrome color palette of dusty greys and dreary blacks, visually, it is one of the most stunning films I have seen in a long time. The colors, or lack of them, go a long way into creating a bleak and brooding atmosphere to stage the story and perfectly enhance the inherent creepiness of the film itself. Even the style in which it was filmed, most noticeable in the scene described above, is quite scary: It puts you right into the character's shoes, and makes for a very visceral and haunting theatrical experience.Being a relatively low-budget film, director James Watkins chose to rely mainly on ""in-camera"" effects rather than touching up scenes with massive amounts of CGI, which aside from being costly also looks phony if thrown in too often. I'd have to guess that about 80% of what you see on-screen was what was actually filmed then and there, not added in later with a computer. This decision definitely adds realism, something not usually found in horror movies, and doesn't cause you to keep drawing yourself out of the film to think ""Oh, they did that with special effects,"".One thing that sets ""Woman"" apart from just about every other scary movie I've seen is that it is incredibly character driven. It isn't just about the scares; it's about the people, too. I find that when you truly care about those involved, you subconsciously invest a lot more in them emotionally, so that whenever tragedies befall them, it hits you that much harder because of it. I guess you could say there is an equal measure of horror and heart, something that doesn't pop up very often in this particular genre.While I've been impressed by Daniel Radcliffe's acting abilities in the past, here, he proves that he is well able to emerge from Harry Potter's shadow and handle other, quite different roles. He's not known for taking on easy parts, and for his first post-Potter film, this is about as difficult as you could manage. A 24-year-old widower with a young child, grieving to the point of obsession over his wife who died in childbirth and who is about to lose his job if he fails to make good on his current case is a daunting enough task for an older, more experienced actor, let alone someone who is only 21! There is no one else I could picture playing Arthur Kipps half so well, managing expertly to portray the sober, almost haunted quality of a man suffering unbearable pain and carrying responsibilities far beyond his years through mostly facial expressions and gestures.The supporting cast is all very well chosen, especially Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Samuel Daily, Liz White as the Woman in Black, and Daniel Radcliffe's real-life godson Misha Handley as Arthur's son, Joseph.The ending, which is different from both the book and the TV adaptation, has a twist that even I didn't foresee, and is either good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I personally feel that it was the only way they could have given the film closure, seeing as how they altered Arthur's back-story from the original novel. The only thing that I really found fault with was the new twist concerning Nathaniel Drablow and Eel Marsh House, which totally puts at odds the idea of the Woman in Black and her vengeful curse in the first place.Overall, after viewing ""The Woman in Black"", I'm still not a fan of horror, but I enjoyed this film because of the strong emotional core and non-stop thriller aspect. I'll certainly be purchasing the DVD to watch around Halloween, when settling down for a night of fright is far more appropriate!",4,A genuinely terrifying film; Daniel Radcliffe is brilliant as

It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very strong and satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls that seem to come to life in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago.Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.",5,Shivery Victorian thriller gives Radcliffe a strong central role...,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,2054,"['have', 'be', 'mood', 'good', 'authentically', 'creepy', 'ghost', 'story', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'quiet', 'chills', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'only', 'story', 'ended', 'realized', ""'d"", 'been', 'taken', 'something', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'beginning', 'rate', 'ending', 'did', 'come', 'twist', 'view', 'preceding', 'events', 'was', 'indeed', 'foreshadowed', 'information', 'given', 'title', 'character.Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'carry', 'weight', 'most', 'film', 'own', 'shoulders', 'very', 'strong', 'satisfying', 'job', 'young', 'lawyer', 'firm', 'mission', 'remote', 'village', 'accessible', 'only', 'when', 'tide', 'low', 'enough', 'permit', 'horse', 'carriage', 'enter', 'story', 'musty', 'atmosphere', 'decaying', 'mansion', 'full', 'shopworn', 'dolls', 'seem', 'come', 'life', 'nursery', 'where', 'three', 'girls', 'met', 'fate', 'years', 'ago.Radcliffe', 'only', 'friendly', 'neighbor', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'who', 'get', 'root', 'troubled', 'village', 'death', 'numerous', 'young', 'children', 'extremes', 'Radcliffe', 'willing', 'go', 'marsh', 'scene', 'where', 'dead', 'boy', 'body', 'are', 'improbable', 'say', 'least', 'so', 'graphically', 'enacted', 'have', 'believe', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'story', 'Radcliffe', 'willing', 'recover', 'corpse', 'give', 'proper', 'burial', 'next', 'mother', 'spirit', 'evidently', 'haunting', 'old', 'mansion.The', 'surprise', 'ending', 'story', 'came', 'quite', 'shock', 'hindsight', 'can', 'see', 'was', 'preparation', 'paid', 'close', 'attention', 'script.For', 'lovers', 'Gothic', 'tales', 'full', 'mist', 'suspicion', 'brooding', 'townspeople', 'dangerous', 'marshlands', 'THE', 'WOMAN', 'IN', 'BLACK', 'ticket', 'Good', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'abundant', 'evidence', 'Hammer', 'certainly', 'making', 'good', 'comeback', 'horror', 'genre', 'delicious', 'ghost', 'story', 'Fine', 'cinematography', 'big', 'asset.Radcliffe', 'expressive', 'use', 'penetrating', 'blue', 'eyes', 'framed', 'bushy', 'brows', 'confirm', 'qualification', 'more', 'adult', 'roles', 'future']",The Woman in Black

1464822,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B005LAIGOQ,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[4, 6]","What a cheering prospect: two great institutions of British supernatural cinema making a good show of not being stone dead after all.Latterly consensus had it that Hammer Film Productions, having introduced the post war generation to spanky gothic horror, was a long time deceased, wiped off the map thirty years ago by the Americans and their ghastly slasher franchises (Halloween,Friday the 13th,Nightmare On Elm Street), which left nothing to the imagination, and nary a haunted cupboard for poor old Hammer to hide in.Hammer's was always a distinctly British pleasure: campy gothic mansions, busty English virgins floundering wantonly at the hands of glowering gentlemen vampires and tension ratcheted by a heady collection of instantly recognisable tropes: bumps in the night, creaking staircases, candlesticks, quavering gas lamps and pale, cassocked children with faraway stares wandering menacingly in and out of the frame, all girdled with a patina of sauciness.An increasingly thick patina as the years wore on: Just as Freddy Kruger was firing up the chainsaws and breaking out the hockey mask, Hammer was tipping into Carry-On territory. I don't think Syd James appeared in a Hammer horror, but he convincingly spoofed one, and you fancy he might have turned in a memorably lecherous Van Helsing had the dice rolled differently. Not long afterward, Hammer folded.All the same, Hammer remains a grand if not exactly solemn pilaster on the frontage of Britain's cinema history. There's an argument (which I may have just invented) that evenStar Warsowes a debt to Hammer: Princess Leia, Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin are archetypes which may as well have been lifted straight out of the Hammer playbook. David Prowse, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were longstanding Hammer alumni.Thirty years or so later, it seems, like its own ghoulish progeny, that Hammer cannot die. Indeed, it seems in rude health, if its new production The Woman In Black is anything to go by.The film delivers all the old Hammer features in spades. And candles, self-rocking chairs, overgrown moonlit graveyards and macabre clockwork dolls. If I had to point up a reservation, I would say it was short a fruity Susannah York in a rippable bodice - but otherwise it nails the Hammer idiom for the twenty-first century.Effective and (mostly) discrete employment of CGI bestows the Woman in Black a gorgeous, stylish look, and the production design is magnificent, from the dark panelled offices from which struggling articled clerk Arthur Kipps is dispatched to the provinces, Jonathan Harker-style, to sort out the papers of a deceased lady's estate, to the majestic tidal sweep out to her mansion perched on a rock resembling St. Michael's Mount and as joyously gothic as any haunted house you'll ever see.Now I mentioned the continued prosperity of two great British cinematic institutions: the other, of course, is the beloved boy wizard Daniel Radcliffe, played to such memorable effect in the eponymous film franchise by young Harry Potter.Few film fans haven't fretted about Potter's chances of escaping the Radcliffe typecast. It is a weighty burden indeed to have played such a definitive character so early in one's career. These first post-Radcliffe films are a make or break for Potter's prospects of cinematic longevity.In that regard, The Woman In Black is both a good and a bad choice.Bad in that, being set in an up-country Gothic pile and having a supernatural context, it is hard not to read in some of the Hogwarts idiom: that Arthur Kipps reaches it aboard a steam train from King's Cross seems almost intentionally referential.Good, though, in that the Hammer style relies for its impact mostly on its direction, staging, lighting, editing, sound and production design: almost anything but acting. The film requires little of its lead: if anything, more is asked of the supporting characters. They must (and, thanks to nicely understated performances from Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Shaun Dooley and Roger Allam, do) project a discomfiting weirdness on proceedings. The unwilling hero, Arthur Kipps, must instead be a blank canvas. We are expected to project ourselves on to Kipps: that's how we become caught up in the suspense. Potter's admirably colourless performance is pitch-perfect in this regard - faint praise, I dare say - but if he is to lose the Radcliffe tag, this is the way to do it. In fairness to the young wizard, for large parts of the screenplay he is the only character on screen: there are only so many acting chops you can show off by creeping along an empty corridor.There is, of course, one character trait Kipps must have that his audience lacks: a complete lack of judgment upon encountering eerie phenomena.Say you're alone, marooned by tidal mudflats, in the grounds of a deserted Gothic mansion and armed with only a box of matches and a cocker spaniel. Dusk is falling, and from nowhere a vigorous clanking starts up in the upper part of the house. Popping outside to investigate, you catch a ghostly face at a top floor window out of the corner of your eye. You must not, as would a prudent audience member after the merest moment's consideration, make at once to the shore and start swimming for your life. You must instead take your box of matches and investigate, to the accompaniment of loud, discordant incidental music, even though you ought to know your matches will surely fail. The idiom requires it.This makes for a superbly thrilling visual experience. No matter how transparent the director's intention, it is impossible not to be caught up. There were, at my preview screening, professional film critics watching through their fingers. If there had been sofas they would have been leapt behind. A boy of 14, who had been a bit cocky as the film opened, migrated to his father's knee and buried his face in the man's neck.Kipps approaches a peephole and looks in. The entire theatre knows exactly what is coming next: a ghoulish face will flash close-up and an explosive scream will jolt the theatre. But when it comes you still jump out of your skin. This is fully exhilarating. The tension and release is orchestrated expertly by director: it is a very, very, good piece of film making.The ending is unusual and, I thought, a little flat, but on reflection I thought it deftly handled, though exactly how I don't feel able to say.So how to grade The Woman In Black, then? It is expertly edited, framed, lit and directed. It is fully cognisant of its own pedigree, of which it sees the funny side. It does feel short a vulnerable fruity maiden or two. But by comparison with Rebecca Hall and Dominic West's recent The Awakening]] - in concept a very similar film - it is vastly superior. It is no Citizen Kane, but nor is it trying to be. That is not a sensible standard to hold it against. And it represents a sure first step in the emancipation of Harold Potter.Reason enough for a full slate.Go see.Olly Buxton",5,A first step in the emancipation of Harold Potter,1328486400,"02 6,

1464835,A1L7LE6ARE47DW,B005LAIGOQ,pleasedie1979,"[1, 1]","A strong 4 to 4 and 1/2 star movie. Not the scariest, not the most original, but a fine addition into the horror/thriller genre.The Woman In Black is a very dark, atmospheric horror. Beautiful settings are used to great effect in creating an unsettling mood throughout the picture. The acting is good (but might require some subtitles at times for some deep British accents) and the special effects are also well done. The lighting was also appropriate for each individual scene. It was dark enough to create an uneasy mood, but light enough to see what was actually happening. Lighting is one of my pet peeves, but this movie pulled it off.So I have to mention the flaws..... The story is good, but is mostly recycled ideas taken from other previous titles. I don't take away that many points for that though as it is rather difficult to scribe a completely original story in this day and age. It also changes these ideas up just enough to make the story its own. The only other knock against this film I could think of would be that it is rather slow at times.

Seriously, it had brilliant pacing, to tell you the truth, I didn't feel like watching the movie right away, but it was a fun way to start off my morning, in fact I felt like turning it off on account of me being tired but another superb thing about this movie is that it gets into the story right away!Plot: Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliff) has already lost his wife and feels her presence everyday even when she is absent. 4 years after her death he is assigned to a house that is practically cut off from the remote town that sits next to it, in fear. There he will do some paper work and mumbo jumbo but, on his first day he soon realizes that something is wrong. It turns out that a spirit (a woman dressed in black) Is haunting the premises of the haunted house. Can Daniel Radcliff stop the terror or will he become another victim in the woman in black's scheme!Review: I never heard of the original until I saw the first trailer back in late 2011 and unfortunately I haven't had the time to watch it but I hear it is chilling and scary as all hell! This movie was intense, but I do wish we saw more of the woman in black but when we did, let me tell ya... she wasn't pretty. In fact I am so sick and tired of witches that are pretty, we need a movie with an ugly witch, but we aren't technically talking about a witch, we are talking about a woman, a woman in black that just so happens to be a ghost! This film was never tame and one thing that it did have that paranormal activity also had was that feeling to look in back of whom ever you should be focusing on but instead your attention is drawn to the background and I feel that it is hard to do, especially when it is not shot entirely on a hand held camera!Acting: It was just wonderful to see Daniel Radcliff in something besides an over-hyped wizard movie (and you know what I am talking about). His acting was pretty awesome but I just couldn't shake the feeling of him playing a father.... damnit, I've watched to much Harry Potter! The other actors were above average as well.... let's just say I was pleasantly surprised!Gore: Some blood coughing and blood on a sheet is all we get here and I do wish it had more atmosphere like the first trailer gave off, but what we got was good enough!Bottom Line: I believe that I have said everything that I wanted to about this movie. It was over decent but I still do adore insidious more because it is more of my taste!Warning This Film is Rated: Rated PG-13 for thematic material and violence/disturbing imagesIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 4",4,A movie that is immensely scarier than any of the Paranormal Activity movies!,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2786,"['reason', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'parts', '1', '3', 'relies', 'jump', 'scares', 'four', 'things', 'suspense', 'creepiness', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'good', 'pacing', 'Seriously', 'had', 'brilliant', 'pacing', 'tell', 'truth', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'watching', 'movie', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'fun', 'way', 'start', 'off', 'morning', 'fact', 'felt', 'turning', 'off', 'account', 'being', 'tired', 'superb', 'thing', 'movie', 'story', 'right', 'away', 'Plot', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'already', 'lost', 'wife', 'presence', 'everyday', 'even', 'when', 'absent', '4', 'years', 'death', 'assigned', 'house', 'practically', 'cut', 'off', 'remote', 'town', 'next', 'fear', 'will', 'do', 'paper', 'work', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'first', 'day', 'soon', 'something', 'wrong', 'out', 'spirit', 'woman', 'dressed', 'black', 'haunting', 'premises', 'haunted', 'house', 'Can', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'stop', 'terror', 'will', 'become', 'victim', 'woman', 'black', 'scheme', 'Review', 'never', 'heard', 'original', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'back', 'late', '2011', 'unfortunately', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'hear', 'chilling', 'scary', 'hell', 'movie', 'was', 'intense', 'do', 'wish', 'saw', 'more', 'woman', 'black', 'when', 'did', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'fact', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'witches', 'are', 'pretty', 'need', 'movie', 'ugly', 'witch', 'are', ""n't"", 'technically', 'talking', 'witch', 'are', 'talking', 'woman', 'woman', 'black', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'ghost', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'tame', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'have', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'also', 'had', 'was', 'feeling', 'look', 'back', 'whom', 'ever', 'should', 'be', 'focusing', 'instead', 'attention', 'drawn', 'background', 'feel', 'hard', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'not', 'shot', 'entirely', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'Acting', 'was', 'just', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Radcliff', 'something', 'over-hyped', 'wizard', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'playing', 'father', 'damnit', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'much', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'above', 'average', 'as', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Gore', 'blood', 'coughing', 'blood', 'sheet', 'get', 'here', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'trailer', 'gave', 'off', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'believe', 'have', 'said', 'everything', 'wanted', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'still', 'do', 'adore', 'insidious', 'more', 'more', 'taste', 'Warning', 'Film', 'Rated', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'thematic', 'material', 'violence/disturbing', 'imagesIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '4']",The Woman in Black

Daniel Redcliff plays a young attorney Arthur, a widower for several years after his wife dies giving birth to their first child Joseph.  His love for his wife was so strong that even time does not seem to be able to erase his memory of her.  It is as if the more time passes by, the more he misses her.  It is the young boy that keeps him going.Arthur's employer is loosing patience with Arthur's melancholy mood that shows so well on screen with Redcliffe's dark hair and his pale, pale skin.  It is as if young attorney's sorrow is bad for business and only if young Arthur can close sale on the house of the recently deceased client, he can resurrect his career.  So the story begins.  Arthur finds himself in a remote village where everyone seems less than thrilled to see him.  With his arrival to the village, children die mysteriously in the most gruesome deaths unbecoming of their innocent lives.  Arthur is deeply affected with the experiences since he has a child himself.  So the story turns the ghost story of horror of sort.  A deceased mother separted from her child who also died (but without a proper burial) is reliesing her vengeance.

There isn't an over abundance of special effects, so the imagery is actually scary.

The only draw back I see with this movie is that the story is not so engrossing that I'd want to watch it again. The interest rests more on suspense than any actual character development. It manages to be well acted while delivering a very superficial level of depth to any character, preventing any real emotional investment in what happens to them.

As is evident by Susan Hill's book, and M R James' stories, the British  skill of the things at the periphery of one's vision is amazing. I would not recommend reading the book before seeing the film, however, that being said, if you have, it will not destroy your enjoyment of the film if you do. Daniel Radcliffe delivers a stellar on camera performance, and the very well chosen cast makes this story a delivered work on a brilliant level. Even the lower level scares make for some great fun in the ghost story.The commentary is well worth listening to, just as the features show a lot more of the extras. I would guess that most people will mist some of the sights out of direct vision. The locations are very well chosen, and some of these are revealed in the commentary, but so long as you go along for the ride, this is a brilliant work. I watched the film in the theatre and on one ""cheap"" scare a young woman just about pierced my ear drums, but strangely enough on the more surreal elements, she was not scared ( I can only assume she was in shock). Excellent film, great in all respects.Regarding the Ultraviolet copy: Don't bother. The inconvenience of setting up two accounts, and the lack of certainty first of all of any sort of availability is a problem, and the limit of Ultraviolet access beyond a few years is farcical. Insist on actual digital copies for your portable device because the cloud is an issue that will haunt your personal details, and if they do not fix security and infrastructure, Ultraviolet is another cloud idea that is a pipe dream.

The kind of scary I like and can't often find. It's not gory, and it only has a couple of cheap-ish, jump-out-of-your-seat scares.  And it's a really good story to which I hope they make a sequel.  (UPDATE: They're making a sequel for 2014!)My husband and I rented this expecting it to be bad, to be quite honest. We hadn't heard much about it and figured it was because Daniel Radcliffe hadn't been able to pull out of Harry Potter-mode. In the very beginning, he actually is very Harry-ish when interacting with his character's son, and I almost wrote the movie off right then. But after that, he made me forget that he was Potter and I was glued to the TV.  The atmosphere is great (anything with possessed Victorian wind-up dolls creeps me right out), the acting is great (after those first few bumps), and it made for a believably scary story that entertained my socks off (which is a feat, considering how much I love wearing socks.)

Hammer studios, if you do know, were a British film company that in the 40's and 50's specialized in film noir, science fiction and other modest genre pictures, but there great success and ultimate legacy would be built upon there gothic horror tales that they made in the late 50's through the mid-70's. Helping to cement the careers of stars such as Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Oliver Reed, Herbert Lom, Michael Gough, Hazel Court, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Shelley, and directors Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis. Like the revived Eailing studios (droll British comedy) and Amicus films (anthology horror movies), the names alone have returned in an attempt to reclaim some of the past glories by using a signature still half heartily remembered by fans of movies of yesteryear, happily Hammer is still leading the way in quality fright films.The Woman in Black is the most overt return to their gothic roots, telling a ghost story that lives in the morbid tell tale hearts and fractured minds of misguided youths from days of ole. In other words, this is my terrain, these are the scary stories we are told around camp fires or experience on a Saturday matinee television show, before we would find the more graphic shockers of late night. It's a return to innocence, while letting the goose flesh crawl up on our arms.Set in the Edwardian era and starring former Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe, here making a fine transition to more mature roles, and Irish character actor Ciaran Hinds, in parts that could easily have been played by Reed and Cushing a few decades back.  Based on Susan Hill's novel, previously filmed for British TV in 1989, with a sequel already in the works. I missed this one in theaters last February, but am grateful that I caught up with it now that it is out on DVD, other than an unnecessary sappy ending, this is good old fashion scary material. Just after seeing the pathetic Apartment 143, here's a scream fest to worm the cockles of my still beating heart.Thanks to no undue gore or torture here, but there are a few good jolts and a nicely scary atmosphere, plus one of the creepiest, but simple final shots in quiet a long time.

1464875,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B005LAIGOQ,S. Schell,"[3, 5]","*A Brief Note to Readers: If you find this review ""not helpful"", please take a moment to tell me why in the comment section. Thank you.*Stories about vengeful spirits never fail to fascinate, and during one of the bleakest months of the year, the release of ""The Woman In Black"" is welcome entertainment for a bored and mostly housebound populace.  Adapted from a horror fiction novel originally published in 1983, author Susan Hill's tale comes to life on screen, raising hairs on the backs of audiences' necks in new and disturbing ways.Arthur Kipps is a sad man.  Even his four-year old son Joseph draws pictures of him with frowns.  His melancholy stems from the loss of his wife Stella, the joy of their son's birth forever marred by her death after a difficult labor and delivery.  So when the law firm under which he is employed assigns him to the estate of one Alice Drablow, it is a convenient distraction and a solution to recent financial troubles.  Surmising he can put her affairs in order in just a few days time, he surpasses his deadline after encountering horrendous piles of disorganized papers as well as strange sounds and voices within Eel Marsh House, Drablow's former home.  Things quickly go from bad to worse when Arthur begins seeing a woman in a black dress in the house and on the grounds, the deaths of several children coinciding with her appearances. Faced with angry, superstitious townspeople and an unraveling mystery, Arthur's problems, once inconsequential, become the stuff of nightmares.""The Woman In Black"" is, in a word, creepy, director James Watkins achieving the tale's ubiquitous gloom in many ways.  The archaic town that Arthur visits is comprised of dank and mossy stone structures populated by frowning denizens.  Costumes are simple and drab, moors are perpetually misty, the marshland is black and oily, and the film is punctuated by lots of beauteous stills of a roiling gray sea.  Porcelain dolls and tattered antique toys are always good for upping the creep factor and Watkins utilizes them to full effect, their wide glassy eyes engulfing the camera lens, unsettling the viewer with their unblinking and penetrating stares.  The foreboding of Eel Marsh House comes to life, its creaky floorboards, dirty and faded wallpaper, and cobwebs adorning every picture, chandelier and wall sconce sure to thrill fans of Susan Hill's novel.  What will make the biggest impression, of course, is the incarnation of the restless and vengeful spirit of the movie's title, one that slinks through the shadows in the background, whose raspy breaths reverberate through the hallways and rafters, and whose dark silhouette comes skulking (sometimes shrieking) out of the darkness time and time again.With the exception of its star player and fellow Harry Potter alumnus Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, the movie is cast with actors largely unknown to American audiences.  Radcliffe, in his first role since the conclusion of the Harry Potter series, could have been judged on his potential as a leading man but the role of Arthur Kipps doesn't allow him to exhibit his range.  He is instead restricted to long somber gazes and a handful of moments of wide-eyed terror, a performance in favor with the film's ambiance and tempo.  The supporting players are on par with their A-list co-star, Hinds the biggest standout for his affecting portrayal of Sam Daily, a man whose life has been torn apart in more ways than one after the untimely death of his young son Nicolas.As with most films of its ilk, ""The Woman In Black"" has its share of scares, the amalgam of music, sound effects, and on-screen action creating moments that make the audience jump out of their seats in fright.  Thankfully Watkins doesn't overdo it, his translation of Hill's tale doing most of the hair-raising work.  It is an admirable adaptation, though I'm sure some readers will take issue with the changes that have been made, the finale in particular.  If you haven't read Hill's novel (I didn't) and love a good ghost story, it's recommended.  If you have read the book and you often find that adaptations of books you've read don't meet your expectations, you're better off passing this one up or at least waiting until it's available on home video.",4,In A Word: Creepy,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,4252,"['*A', 'Brief', 'Note', 'Readers', 'find', 'review', 'not', 'helpful', 'please', 'take', 'moment', 'tell', 'why', 'comment', 'section', 'Thank', '*Stories', 'vengeful', 'spirits', 'never', 'fail', 'fascinate', 'one', 'bleakest', 'months', 'year', 'release', 'Woman', 'Black', 'welcome', 'entertainment', 'bored', 'mostly', 'housebound', 'populace', 'Adapted', 'horror', 'fiction', 'novel', 'originally', 'published', '1983', 'author', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'tale', 'life', 'screen', 'raising', 'hairs', 'backs', 'audiences', 'necks', 'new', 'disturbing', 'ways.Arthur', 'Kipps', 'sad', 'man', 'Even', 'four-year', 'old', 'son', 'Joseph', 'pictures', 'frowns', 'melancholy', 'stems', 'loss', 'wife', 'Stella', 'joy', 'son', 'birth', 'forever', 'marred', 'death', 'difficult', 'labor', 'delivery', 'So', 'when', 'law', 'firm', 'employed', 'assigns', 'estate', 'one', 'Alice', 'Drablow', 'convenient', 'distraction', 'solution', 'recent', 'financial', 'troubles', 'Surmising', 'can', 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'time', 'deadline', 'encountering', 'horrendous', 'piles', 'disorganized', 'papers', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'sounds', 'voices', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'Drablow', 'former', 'home', 'Things', 'quickly', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'when', 'Arthur', 'seeing', 'woman', 'black', 'dress', 'house', 'grounds', 'deaths', 'several', 'children', 'coinciding', 'appearances', 'Faced', 'angry', 'superstitious', 'townspeople', 'unraveling', 'mystery', 'Arthur', 'problems', 'once', 'inconsequential', 'become', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'Woman', 'Black', 'word', 'creepy', 'director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'achieving', 'tale', 'ubiquitous', 'gloom', 'many', 'ways', 'archaic', 'town', 'Arthur', 'comprised', 'dank', 'mossy', 'stone', 'structures', 'populated', 'frowning', 'denizens', 'Costumes', 'are', 'simple', 'drab', 'moors', 'are', 'perpetually', 'misty', 'marshland', 'black', 'oily', 'film', 'punctuated', 'lots', 'beauteous', 'stills', 'roiling', 'gray', 'sea', 'Porcelain', 'dolls', 'tattered', 'antique', 'toys', 'are', 'always', 'good', 'upping', 'creep', 'factor', 'Watkins', 'full', 'effect', 'wide', 'glassy', 'eyes', 'engulfing', 'camera', 'unsettling', 'viewer', 'unblinking', 'penetrating', 'stares', 'foreboding', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'life', 'creaky', 'floorboards', 'dirty', 'faded', 'wallpaper', 'cobwebs', 'adorning', 'picture', 'chandelier', 'wall', 'sconce', 'sure', 'thrill', 'fans', 'Susan', 'Hill', 'novel', 'What', 'will', 'make', 'biggest', 'impression', 'course', 'incarnation', 'restless', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'movie', 'title', 'one', 'shadows', 'background', 'raspy', 'breaths', 'reverberate', 'hallways', 'rafters', 'dark', 'silhouette', 'skulking', 'sometimes', 'shrieking', 'darkness', 'time', 'time', 'again.With', 'exception', 'star', 'player', 'fellow', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'alumnus', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'movie', 'cast', 'actors', 'largely', 'unknown', 'American', 'audiences', 'Radcliffe', 'first', 'role', 'conclusion', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'judged', 'potential', 'leading', 'man', 'role', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', ""n't"", 'allow', 'exhibit', 'range', 'instead', 'restricted', 'long', 'somber', 'gazes', 'handful', 'moments', 'wide-eyed', 'terror', 'performance', 'favor', 'film', 'ambiance', 'tempo', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'par', 'A-list', 'co-star', 'biggest', 'standout', 'affecting', 'portrayal', 'Sam', 'Daily', 'man', 'life', 'been', 'torn', 'apart', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'untimely', 'death', 'young', 'son', 'Nicolas.As', 'most', 'films', 'ilk', 'Woman', 'Black', 'share', 'scares', 'amalgam', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'on-screen', 'action', 'creating', 'moments', 'make', 'audience', 'jump', 'seats', 'fright', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'translation', 'Hill', 'tale', 'doing', 'most', 'hair-raising', 'work', 'admirable', 'adaptation', ""'m"", 'sure', 'readers', 'will', 'take', 'issue', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'finale', 'particular', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Hill', 'novel', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'recommended', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'often', 'find', 'adaptations', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'expectations', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'passing', 'one', 'up', 'least', 'waiting', 'available', 'home', 'video']",The Woman in Black

1464881,A2A2SUY3IOQKY1,B005LAIGOQ,TawnTawn,"[1, 1]","Arthur Kipps is a lawyer in London whose wife has died in childbirth.  He has a four year old son and a nanny for him. However, he is in danger of losing his job at his law firm because apparently he has done nothing but mope around for the last four years. He is given one last chance to redeem himself, to go to a remote village and Eel Marsh House, where the owner has died, and sort out her many papers.He meets a man, Samuel Daily, on the train on the way there, and despite Arthur's very rarely opening his mouth to speak (ever), Samuel becomes his one ally in the town.  Arthur goes to Eel Marsh house to look for, and at the papers of this woman, and get them in order and locate her will.  How he is expected to do this, I do not understand, because even in the daylight, with candles, that place is dark as a cave.The important papers (birth and death certificates, adoption papers) are placed conveniently on top so that Arthur finds out what he needs to know right away - about the ghost, The Woman In Black (what wearing black has to do with anything they don't say). Every time he goes to the house, there is always a lot of unexplained sights and sounds, which never faze Arthur in the least. He's still just so stunned from losing his wife four years ago.The ghost, Jennet, really does seem to be taking her anger out on the wrong people. After so many deaths, you'd think they'd move away or hire an exorcist or something. As is usual in these movies, what the living person thinks/hopes/believes/is sure will appease the out of control ghost does not work. I didn't really care about any of these silly characters, and watching Arthur go from being covered in mud/dirt/or soaking wet to being dry and spotless wearing the same clothes, was irritating.Something that perturbed me: on the adoption papers those involved are referred to as Mr., Mrs., and Ms. (the unmarried ghost). But from all the period British novels I've read, there was no use of ""Ms."" back then and periods after honorifics such as Mr, Mrs or Dr were not used, and still are not. Jennet should have been referred to as ""Miss"" on the adoption paper.Janet McTeer was wasted, but I guess it's a paycheck.",2,"The Crazy, Irate Woman in Black",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,2189,"['Arthur', 'Kipps', 'lawyer', 'London', 'wife', 'died', 'childbirth', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'nanny', 'However', 'danger', 'losing', 'job', 'law', 'firm', 'apparently', 'done', 'nothing', 'mope', 'last', 'four', 'years', 'given', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'redeem', 'go', 'remote', 'village', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'House', 'where', 'owner', 'died', 'sort', 'out', 'many', 'papers.He', 'meets', 'man', 'Samuel', 'Daily', 'train', 'way', 'there', 'Arthur', 'very', 'rarely', 'opening', 'mouth', 'speak', 'ever', 'Samuel', 'one', 'ally', 'town', 'Arthur', 'Eel', 'Marsh', 'house', 'look', 'papers', 'woman', 'get', 'order', 'locate', 'will', 'How', 'expected', 'do', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'even', 'daylight', 'candles', 'place', 'dark', 'cave.The', 'important', 'papers', 'birth', 'death', 'certificates', 'adoption', 'papers', 'are', 'placed', 'conveniently', 'top', 'Arthur', 'out', 'what', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'ghost', 'Woman', 'Black', 'what', 'wearing', 'black', 'do', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'time', 'house', 'always', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'sights', 'sounds', 'never', 'faze', 'Arthur', 'least', 'still', 'just', 'so', 'stunned', 'losing', 'wife', 'four', 'years', 'ago.The', 'ghost', 'Jennet', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'taking', 'anger', 'wrong', 'people', 'so', 'many', 'deaths', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'move', 'away', 'hire', 'exorcist', 'something', 'usual', 'movies', 'what', 'living', 'person', 'thinks/hopes/believes/is', 'sure', 'will', 'appease', 'out', 'control', 'ghost', 'not', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'silly', 'characters', 'watching', 'Arthur', 'go', 'being', 'covered', 'mud/dirt/or', 'soaking', 'wet', 'being', 'dry', 'spotless', 'wearing', 'same', 'clothes', 'was', 'irritating.Something', 'perturbed', 'adoption', 'papers', 'involved', 'are', 'referred', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Ms.', 'unmarried', 'ghost', 'period', 'British', 'novels', ""'ve"", 'read', 'was', 'use', 'Ms.', 'back', 'then', 'periods', 'honorifics', 'such', 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Dr', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'still', 'are', 'not', 'Jennet', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'referred', 'Miss', 'adoption', 'paper.Janet', 'McTeer', 'was', 'wasted', 'guess', 'paycheck']",The Woman in Black

1464886,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005LAIGOQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","The movie hits on all the classic stereotypes of a ghost story. There is a haunted mansion in an isolated marsh thick with fog. There is a past of a haunted suicide and a recent will. The village has a secret. The house has ghostly images, squeaks, creaks, whispers, things that move on their own, and a raven that enters it.Our main character has a wife who has died in child birth and for some undisclosed reason this is his ""last chance"" with his firm so he just can't walk away. In the beginning, Radcliffe wears his hair down over his forehead leading me to suspect he really does have a permanent mark in the shape of a lightning bolt.There is a mystery that is supposed to draw you in, but having seen so many clich&eacute;s you wonder if this film will offer you anything new.As the poorly developed Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe) sorts through the papers in the house he uncovers letters which sheds some light unto the situation, and we get to see his bolt free forehead. Radcliffe was neither an asset nor a liability. His agent did him well, but I thought he mustered more fear and terror as that Potter guy in the late sequels than he did in this film. He seems to have trouble with convincing facial expressions.The strength of the film is in how well it utilizes all those haunted mansion clich&eacute;s, the lighting...or lack of it, and the detailing of the era. Arthur is played as a rather dull character. There are things that happen to him which would have made me leap out of skin and run out the house, yet he does very little. Also Arthur is quiet as he encounters the unknown, perhaps done to build up the scare factor, but I wonder how that would have worked with a character who talks to the ghost while searching about, maybe with a comical line or two taken from ""Hold That Ghost"" or someone like Joe Pesci swearing obscenities at it.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

1464887,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B005LAIGOQ,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[62, 64]","There are two kinds of horror films.  The first depends for its scares on graphic gore, unrestrained violence, and blood -- lots of it.  The second relies more on mood and an escalating sense of terror than gruesome images to get under the skin.  ""The Woman in Black"" falls into the second category.  It's a film rich in atmosphere that takes its time getting underway but, once it kicks in, never lets go.In pre-World War I England, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), a young London lawyer with a small son, is grieving over his dead wife.  His employer is fed up with Arthur's dour attitude and sends him to Yorkshire to handle the sale of an estate.  Arthur is warned that this will be his last chance to distinguish himself for the firm.Arriving after a long journey, Arthur is met and befriended by a local squire, Daily (Ciaran Hinds), though the other townsfolk are not thrilled with the visit of an outsider.  Arthur is brought to the house of the deceased, which lies quite a distance from town.  It is the textbook example of the House of Gloom -- grey, run down, surrounded by overgrown shrubbery, broken gates marking its entrance -- a place that immediately foreshadows bad things to come.For much of the movie, Arthur is alone in the house -- or is he?  Many of the trappings of a traditional ghost story are here -- the rainstorm, shadowy corridors, a dog barking at something not seen, an endless number of rooms, each with creepy and unsettling contents.  And then there are the sightings: a darkly attired female figure, a face at a window, a fresh handprint on a window, a corpse rising from a muddy grave.  Whether these are real or only figments of Arthur's imagination is left to speculation -- at least for a while.""The Woman in Black"" is from Hammer Studios, famous for a series of highly profitable Technicolor horror films made between 1957 and the early 70's.  Those features always had great production values and good actors, giving them far more style than their competitors.  ""The Woman in Black"" is true to that tradition.  Instead of a collection of young and pretty 20-somethings who will be disposed of in messy ways, it boasts a first-rate cast.Mr. Radcliffe's character is the focus of the movie and he is totally convincing as the lawyer hoping to make good while under a cloud of depression over the loss of his beloved wife.  He infuses his performance with a sad determination, as if he is running a track meet with his feet encased in cement blocks.  He forges on, knowing his livelihood depends on successfully delving through a myriad of papers, settling the estate, and seeing to the sale of the house.  Yet he misses his wife and the life they had together.  His Arthur Kipps is as far removed from Harry Potter as Hamlet is from the Nutty Professor.Mr. Hinds's Squire Daily is on hand mostly to provide balance to the inhospitable townsfolk, who would be equally at home carrying torches up a hill in a Frankenstein movie.  He prides himself on not being superstitious and refuses to believe the many deaths of children in town are anything more than unfortunate coincidence.  He also provides some exposition, filling us in on what happened in that gloomy house and why Arthur will undoubtedly fail to find a local buyer.  Hinds has a patrician look and never smiles. He suggests a careworn aristocrat who has seen much and prefers to trust his senses to belief in the otherworldly.Janet McTeer appears briefly, but unforgettably, as Mrs. Daily, a woman who is either an amusing eccentric or a looney, depending on how you interpret her actions.  Ms. McTeer adds bizarre contrast to a film in which the expression of choice appears to be glumness.  Dressed in frills and smiling pleasantly, she enjoys hosting Arthur for dinner.  It's not until we see some of her odd habits that we realize she may have a few cards missing from her deck.Director James Watkins has fashioned an entertaining horror film.  It's the kind of movie those who are turned off by bloody mayhem can embrace, since it's more about dread and terror than horror.  We experience the house and its history through the eyes of Arthur Kipps.  Watkins knows how to use sound and silence to enhance mood.  Long stretches of silence will precede a loud noise that will make us jump, but those stretches of silence are filled with suspense and anticipation.  We know that something -- anything -- might happen unexpectedly.Ample credit must be given to those responsible for the film's creepy milieu.  Art director Paul Ghirardani, production designer Kave Quinn, and set decorator Niamh Coulter have decorated every nook and cranny of the old manor house with Victorian furnishings, faded paintings, large carved cabinets, countless  candles, cobwebs, and eerie old wind-up toys.  One can almost smell the mustiness.Rated PG-13, ""The Woman in Black"" takes itself seriously and never resorts to self-deprecation.  The characters behave intelligently and have actual motivations.  It is in the league of Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"" or Robert Wise's creaky-old-house melodrama, ""The Haunting.""  Like those earlier films, it shows what happens when a person is confronted with the supernatural and reality seems to spin wildly out of control.",5,Period Ghost Story Gets It Right,1337212800,"05

I really just think that more could have been done with it. Some parts of the movie are very intense and keep you watching while others seem to drag and slow the movie down.

1464893,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGOQ,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[1, 4]","Of all the Harry Potter alumni, Daniel Radcliffe is probably in the most tenuous position now that the blockbuster franchise has ended it's decade long run. He's dabbled in other projects outside of the boy wizard's adventures before, and has generally shown to be a talented and more than capable actor. But he's also most likely to be pigeonholed, with people unable to accept him as anything other than a kid with a magic wand and pet owl. Even so, he's still in a better position than poor Rupert Grint. So what's the best decision Radcliffe can make? To star in another film that has him dealing with big houses and supernatural forces. Probably not the wisest move, and his Harry Potter fans who follow him into the tedious The Woman in Black may start wishing for someone to cast a spell and speed up time.Based on a Susan Collin's dreary but effective novel, the deliberate pacing is one that plays out better on the printed page than on screen. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a gloomy lawyer struggling to cope with the death of his wife, who passed tragically years earlier after giving birth to their son. Arthur apparently hasn't smiled since, so much so that his son draws depressing pictures of his Dad(to comical effect). His demeanor is so bleak that Arthur is on the verge of losing his job. Nobody wants a stick in the mud as a colleague. Given one last shot to redeem himself, he's sent to the depressing village of Yorkshire to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman.Upon arriving, it's pretty clear nobody wants him there, and the reason has to do with the woman's creaky old home, which as you probably suspected is plagued by an evil spirit. Aren't they all? In this case it's of a woman, wronged in life and separated forever from her dead son. As retribution, her malevolence has plagued the entire village's children, and the streets are littered with the ghosts of her victims who stare blankly out of windows and hang around the woods like creepy stalkers. The town itself is little more than a mudpit with a bit of smog surrounding it, but it's like heaven compared to the house itself, which is full of every horror cliche in the book. Creepy marionettes that look extra spooky in the dark, the type no parent would ever buy their child. Every corner is a blind hazard, every step another rickety shriek of worn out wood, and behind every door lies the possibility of a vengeful poltergeist. Shutters flap, people knock on the door at the most fearful moments. Let's just say that Arthur doesn't get a lot of work done.Radcliffe may seem like an odd choice to play a grieving widower, but he proves to be the film's greatest asset. His youthful features appear appropriately hardened by years of overwhelming grief, and you can tell his every action is labored by life's meaninglessness. But when faced with immediate danger, some of the old Harry Potter spirit comes through. In contrast to the rest of the cast, including veteran actor Ciaran Hinds, Radcliffe is the only one who seems to be bringing everything he has to what is a very understated role.It's just unfortunate that so much of the film is completely conventional. Despite director James Watkins' skillful depiction of smog and soot filled Victorian England, the script by the usually reliable Jane Goldman doesn't take us anywhere we haven't been. Atmosphere can only get you so far, and some of the film's old school horror charms wear thin from overuse. How many times are we expected to leap from our seats at a close-up of a toy monkey? Without genuine scares, the glacial pace becomes an even bigger problem. Watching both chapters of Deathly Hallows feels more brisk than this film's plodding 90 minutes.",3,"Radcliffe is the best thing about this slow moving, familiar horror",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,3722,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'alumni', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'probably', 'most', 'tenuous', 'position', 'now', 'blockbuster', 'franchise', 'ended', 'decade', 'long', 'run', 'dabbled', 'other', 'projects', 'boy', 'wizard', 'adventures', 'generally', 'shown', 'be', 'talented', 'more', 'capable', 'actor', 'also', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'pigeonholed', 'people', 'unable', 'accept', 'anything', 'other', 'kid', 'magic', 'wand', 'pet', 'owl', 'Even', 'so', 'still', 'better', 'position', 'poor', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'So', 'what', 'best', 'decision', 'Radcliffe', 'can', 'make', 'star', 'film', 'dealing', 'big', 'houses', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'Probably', 'not', 'wisest', 'move', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fans', 'who', 'follow', 'tedious', 'Woman', 'Black', 'may', 'start', 'wishing', 'someone', 'cast', 'spell', 'speed', 'up', 'time.Based', 'Susan', 'Collin', 'dreary', 'effective', 'novel', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'one', 'out', 'better', 'printed', 'page', 'screen', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Arthur', 'Kipps', 'gloomy', 'lawyer', 'struggling', 'cope', 'death', 'wife', 'who', 'passed', 'tragically', 'years', 'earlier', 'giving', 'birth', 'son', 'Arthur', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'smiled', 'so', 'much', 'son', 'depressing', 'pictures', 'Dad', 'comical', 'effect', 'demeanor', 'so', 'bleak', 'Arthur', 'verge', 'losing', 'job', 'Nobody', 'stick', 'mud', 'colleague', 'Given', 'one', 'last', 'shot', 'redeem', 'sent', 'depressing', 'village', 'Yorkshire', 'settle', 'affairs', 'recently', 'deceased', 'woman.Upon', 'arriving', 'pretty', 'clear', 'nobody', 'there', 'reason', 'do', 'woman', 'creaky', 'old', 'home', 'probably', 'suspected', 'plagued', 'evil', 'spirit', 'Are', ""n't"", 'case', 'woman', 'wronged', 'life', 'separated', 'forever', 'dead', 'son', 'retribution', 'malevolence', 'plagued', 'entire', 'village', 'children', 'streets', 'are', 'littered', 'ghosts', 'victims', 'who', 'stare', 'blankly', 'windows', 'hang', 'woods', 'creepy', 'stalkers', 'town', 'little', 'more', 'mudpit', 'bit', 'smog', 'surrounding', 'heaven', 'compared', 'house', 'full', 'horror', 'cliche', 'book', 'Creepy', 'look', 'extra', 'spooky', 'dark', 'type', 'parent', 'would', 'ever', 'buy', 'child', 'corner', 'blind', 'hazard', 'step', 'rickety', 'shriek', 'worn', 'out', 'wood', 'behind', 'door', 'possibility', 'vengeful', 'poltergeist', 'Shutters', 'flap', 'people', 'knock', 'door', 'most', 'fearful', 'moments', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Arthur', ""n't"", 'get', 'lot', 'work', 'done.Radcliffe', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', 'play', 'grieving', 'widower', 'be', 'film', 'greatest', 'asset', 'youthful', 'features', 'appear', 'appropriately', 'hardened', 'years', 'overwhelming', 'grief', 'can', 'tell', 'action', 'labored', 'life', 'meaninglessness', 'when', 'faced', 'immediate', 'danger', 'old', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'spirit', 'through', 'contrast', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Radcliffe', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'be', 'bringing', 'everything', 'what', 'very', 'understated', 'role.It', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'completely', 'conventional', 'director', 'James', 'Watkins', 'skillful', 'depiction', 'smog', 'soot', 'filled', 'Victorian', 'England', 'script', 'usually', 'reliable', 'Jane', 'Goldman', ""n't"", 'take', 'anywhere', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'Atmosphere', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'charms', 'wear', 'thin', 'overuse', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'expected', 'leap', 'seats', 'close-up', 'toy', 'monkey', 'genuine', 'scares', 'glacial', 'pace', 'even', 'bigger', 'problem', 'Watching', 'chapters', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'more', 'brisk', 'film', 'plodding', '90', 'minutes']",The Woman in Black

1464895,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIGOQ,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Set in the Edwardian-era England, ""The Woman in Black"" is an old-fashioned horror movie that reminds us of Victorian ghost stories. This is not surprising, as the film (based on a Susan Hill novel) is produced by the newly revived Hammer studio, once known for its ""Dracula"" franchise starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer on the verge of losing his position in the firm. As a final chance to keep his job, he is sent to a small British town, where he has to find a certain document at the Eel Marsh House on an estate that is cut off from the outside world. The people there obviously do not want him in their town, however. The local lawyer is not cooperative. Soon Arthur is to learn the reason - some terrifying things about ""The Woman in Black.""The 2012 film version of ""The Woman in Black"" (the original book was made into a TV movie starring Adrian Rawlins as Arthur Kipps in 1989) benefits from the atmospheric photography and the production designs of the desolate Eel Marsh House that alone is worth watching. Daniel Radcliffe turns in effective performance a widowed father, still mourning his wife's death, though he looks a little too young for the role of a father, if not a lawyer.What the film doesn't have is any new ideas to scare us. As to the film's scares, the best part is probably the ""Ju-On""-inspired opening, which is creepy enough, but the film itself nds to depend on the hackneyed techniques like sudden big sound. Some of them are so predictable that you can see them coming from miles away.Perhaps we have seen so many similar-themed thrillers since the original book was published, ""The Orphanage"" for example, films with more inventive and creative ways to surprise and scare us.

1464906,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B005LAIGOQ,William Amazzini,"[3, 3]","Eureka!!!  Finally a modern day Horror film which discards CGI as an overwhelming crutch and goes for the jugular as Director James Watkins updates Writer Susan Hill's chilling ghost story 'THE WOMAN IN BLACK' and shows how true Horror films have been sorely missed over the past few decades.  The gothic Horror tale has long since been left in the dust by the supposed chillers of hacks such as Wes Craven , M. Night Shayamalan, Rob Zombie , to name but a few. With cheap tricks, gore effects,and screenplays which seem to succeed with modern audiences , none have even touched the terrifying sequences within this film.  Yes, they have their fans and supporters but they wouldn't know true Horror if it bit them where the sun don't shine.  Mr. Watkins, however, has done his homework by creating a beautifully chilling nightmare with such incredible atmosphere, you can feel the mist and fog come right through the monitor.  Daniel Radcliffe, who was criticized as being too young for the role, is excellent and Ciaran Hinds lends great support as Director Watkins glides his camera through an absolutely terrifying encounter with a haunted mansion. With a bone chilling score by Marco Beltrami and superior cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones, this is a film that truly lives up to the cliche, 'Don't watch it alone'.  I happened to view this film with at least four other Horror fans who have seen countless ghost films over the years and I counted no fewer than 8 times that they jumped right out of their skins, something modern day Horror tries to emulate but never succeed.  The film is released by Hammer Films of England who were responsible for a literal Horror renaissance beginning in the mid fifties and lasting to the early seventies but not even those photoplays have the class of this true Horror masterpiece.  If you love the films of Val Lewton and think that the champion of all ghost stories, Director Robert Wise's 'THE HAUNTING'- 1963 is the definitive haunted house thriller , you will be surprised. If ever a film was perfect for the Blu-Ray format, this is it as Sony releases it in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with jaw dropping 5.1 DTS sound.
