1191714,A2M4R8R6SU049A,B001FES0JI,"Amazon Customer ""too many books, too little time""","[4, 4]","This film is perfect for a quiet family night.  It is the story of a sad and angry man, Henry Poole, who wants to live in the one place where he was happy -- his childhood home.  He can't buy it, so he buys one nearby.  There, the neighbors at first seem eccentric, but as he comes to know them, and they begin to know him we, the viewers, are charmed by everyone.The crux of the story involves a stain on his stucco.  In this stain, people begin to see the face of Christ (Henry can't see it) and claim miraculous cures.  Given some crucial facts about Henry (and I don't want to create a spoiler), this makes him even more bitter.But his gentle neighbors take him as he is, and this film comes to a denouement that is truly transformational.After the film finished, it led to some wonderful conversations among my family members.  If miracles exist, do they matter?  Does faith require miracles?  What constitutes adequate loving kindness when our neighbors act wacky?  What would WE do in this situation?

It's somewhere in between.  Luke Wilson does a good job of being serious in this movie.  The acting is genuinely great in this movie.  The only thing that detracted from the movie for me was how slow moving it was at the beginning.Being from L.A., this movie is very genuine in its depiction of the Southern California lifestyle--the one that most people don't see.  I think most people think L.A. is either like Compton or like Beverly Hills.  But, most of it is really somewhere in between--like it is in this movie.I'd recommend this movie.

1191716,A32T2H8150OJLU,B001FES0JI,ARH,"[1, 2]","What would I have wanted to know before purchasing this product.OK, first of all, this is NOT a romantic comedy.  It's not any kind of comedy (even though Luke Wilson is in it).Second, do not expect big budget special effects and the standard Hollywood-ized storyline.Third, expect to wonder what is going on with the main character, and some of the other characters as well, for most of the movie.Fourth, the whole story revolves around the main withdrawn character and a water stain that some people believe looks like the face of Christ that appears on the side of his newly purchased home.Why I liked it:- Luke Wilson did a great job of portraying a man with no hope, and no future...a man that just wanted to be left alone in his misery.- I liked the other supporting cast, especially the (nosey?) neighbor and the girl that worked at the grocery store...as they tried in their own ways to reach out to the withdrawn main character.- I liked the expressions of faith by various characters- I have to admit that I liked some aspects of the ending...you'll have to watch to find out why.Why I didn't like it:- There was only adequate character development of most of the supporting roles (you just didn't learn enough about enough of the characters to make for a completely developed story).- I wanted to know exactly wnat Henry Poole's specific problem was- The character of the little girl next door was, well, part of the time, kind of spooky- I have to admit that I didn't like the end...the part that was too predictable...you'll have to watch to find out why.So my final summary is that this is a closely split vote between likes and dislikes.  On the one hand I'm glad I saw it, but on the other hand I'm not likely to recommend it to a friend.So while this is, at least in my mind a 2.5 star movie, Luke Wilson's performance, at least, moves it up to 3 stars.I hope this was helpful.P.S. I just watched this film again, and if I could I'd add another star.  I found that the 2nd time through that the characters seemed to grow within themselves, and that the story seemed more full and satisfying.

Henry is unlucky enough to be surrounded by nosy people--an older hispanic neighbor, a little girl neighbor, and a pushy real estate agent.  When the older hispanic neighbor discovers a water stain on the side of the house that she believes is an image of Christ, she share it with the community, much to Henry's chagrin.  Will Henry make peace with his neighbors and come to believe in the power of the mark, or will he remain standoffish, hard-hearted Henry Poole?This was an okay movie.  It moved kind of slow, and the dialogue was pretty rough at times.

All we see is that he is willing to pay list price for a new home that the realtor insists she can get for a lower price. He says it doesn't matter because he is going to be living there very long. It's quite apparent that Henry (Luke Wilson) doesn't want to be bothered. But his neighbor Esperanza can't help but be nice him. Henry's life of solitude is ruined when Esperanza insists she sees the face of God in a water stain on his stucco-sided house.Esperanza brings over her priest (George Lopez) and many of her friends. Soon, Henry's back yard is a circus, with everyone wanting to get a glimpse of and touch the face of Christ. Henry refuses to believe the image is anything but a water stain and does everything he can to clean the stain off his house. Henry begins to get close to the young woman next door, Dawn (Radha Mitchell) and her cute daughter Lilly. Lilly hasn't spoken in over a year, when her father left the family. Henry also develops a friendship with a young cashier at the grocery store. All these people begin to care about Henry even though he doesn't want them to.I enjoyed this movie about faith, but realize it probably isn't for every one. This isn't a comedy, it's a drama that deals with faith and hope amisdt bad circumstances. The movie's power for me comes from the knowledge that director Mark Pellington's wife died recently and that this movie in some way tackles the very issues that he dealt with.This movie has a positive message, which can be rare in Hollywood. While it deals with an image of Christ and miracles, the movie certainly isn't overly religious. The movie had good actors in it, but none of their performances stood out.

With a dynamite soundtrack, this little known film is not to be missed. It was in limited release and got little to no publicity which when I saw it surprised me as Luke Wilson is wonderful in it, as always, and when isn't George Lopez a treat?The film is a drama/comedy that is a touching and inspiring about a man who has just about given up hope but you don't find out why until much later in the story. He wants to be alone and buys a suburban house in need of repairs but tells everyone it doesn't matter, as he won't be in it for long.His desire to be alone is squelched starting with a nosy neighbor who won't leave him alone and another neighbor who is lovely and has a precious, but mute, daughter. Luke becomes quite taken with the child and soon the mother as well. These two lead the way to bring Luke out of his obvious depression.The hilarity starts when the nosy neighbor, Esperanza, played by Adriana Barraza, sees a face in a water stain on Henry's house. The more she looks she realizes it is the face of Jesus Christ and being a religious woman, lets her priest and church friends know about it. Soon, crowds of people come to ask for miracles to which, of course, Luke is upset and annoyed by. Gone is his chance to be left alone. As unexplained things begin to happen, however, Luke begins to change and the movie shows that he really doesn't want to be left alone and rather learns to cherish his life.The soundtrack is excellent and the special features add so much to the film so don't forget to watch them as these are well worth the time. Luke Wilson gives a fine performance and so I put this film in the category of one of those little known gems that once people see it, it will get out how very entertaining and well done it is.Submitted by K.

1191722,AYC3Y4QX7GATV,B001FES0JI,"Bob Dog ""My Thoughts""","[1, 2]","Roger Ebert's opinion is a very good barometer for me.  I usually like what he likes, dislike what he dislikes, and usually for the same reasons.  ""Henry Poole is Here"" was highly recommended by Roger, and I can see why.  But you knew what was going to happen before it happened, and you knew how it would end.  Unfortunately, you also knew several non-formulatic things that should have happened, but this rather shallow screenplay wasn't capable of delivering on those other, more interesting scenerios.The things to like about this film are the sweet tiny things.  For example, Luke Wilson's and Adriana Esperanza's understated humor (they are marvelous together), the tape recorded dialogue by the little girl, the little girl's secret hide out, the dinner date in the back yard, the conversations with the check-out clerk, the old ladies, George Lopez's playing a priest, and the likeable main character triumphing in the end, etc.  This kind of tenderness Roger and I both like very much.  The lack of character development which was intended, I assume, to maintain the suspense, really hurt the impact of ""Henry Poole is Here.""  If there had been some value maintaining the suspense it might have been worth it, but everyone knew what was coming.  This is a film about caring, belief, and hope.  All these things can't be fully developed without understanding the characters better.We never really come to understand Henry's illnes and why he took the diagnosis of one physician to conclude he was dying, or how he came to reconcile his own apparent miracle with the face of christ on the wall.  This would have been interesting to explore, but the movie seemed to go from his hospital bed to the ending credits very quickly.  And we never understood why the woman next door comes to love and trust him so quickly, and it was strange why everyone kept giving Henry the benefit of all kinds of doubt.  He only shaved and showered once in the entire movie.  He looked pretty scary to me (and he probably smelled a little rank, too)!Mark Pellington also directed ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" a low budget monster movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Based on these two films alone I would want to watch his next project.  On his next one, I hope there is more character development and a less conventional plot.  It seemed to me like ""Henry Poole Was Here"" took the handoff, ran most of the way down the field, and then fumbled at the ten yard line.  Besides the issue of hope and trust, unlike many reviewers who thought the movie was too religious, I thought the religion or faith plot lines could have been carried alot further.If you are a fan of Luke Wilson and or Adriana Barraza (she was the babysitter in ""Babel,"" a dramatic role), and you like happy endings, KEEP THE FAITH!

1191726,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001FES0JI,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","I've been grappling with how I feel about ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" mostly because I don't know what audience it was made for. Is it for those who believe in God, or is it for those who don't? Is its message aimed at those who are already convinced, or is it sending a message to convince others of what it believes? I wish I knew; this movie gives so many mixed signals that it's impossible for me to say what its intentions are. It's a fascinating film, but it's also maddening, teetering back and forth between the concrete and the vague. I'm not even sure what it's trying to tell the audience: Is it advocating the Christian belief that God and Jesus Christ are real and can perform miracles, or is it trying to tell us about belief in and of itself? You may know the answers to these questions. You may also feel that I've completely missed the point of this movie. You're probably right. This could end up being one of the year's most divisive films, caught in a tug-of-war between the faithful and the skeptical.The plot: Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) moves back to his Southern California childhood neighborhood, apparently to die after being diagnosed with a terminal illness not specifically named. Detached, antisocial, boozy, and unkempt, he wallows in his barely furnished house. Not long after he moves in, his nosey neighbor, Esperanza (Adriana Barraza), makes a startling discovery; the Stucco on the backyard wall of his house displays a water stain that resembles the face of Jesus Christ, the face with an ever-present tear of blood oozing from one eye. Henry, having lost his faith, believes it's nothing more than a stain. Esperanza, a woman of deep faith, believes the image to be genuine, and she wastes no time in encouraging her friends and neighbors to come and see. This includes Father Salazar (George Lopez), a soft-spoken man who seemingly understands Henry's reluctance to believe in anything. Soon, the faithful from all over the city descend on Henry's house. They believe that if they touch the wall, miraculous things will happen to them.Indeed, miraculous things do happen. Example: a supermarket checkout girl named Patience (Rachel Seiferth) was once saddled with coke-bottle thick glasses; now she has perfect twenty-twenty vision. As someone who's seen Henry falling further and further into despair, she explains that matters of faith can't be explained through reason. She also explains that she was healed because she chose to believe. This makes perfect sense--we can only transcend our limitations if we allow ourselves to, and the only way this can happen is to believe. Here's where the idea gets a little fuzzy: Is she saying we have to believe in ourselves, or that we have to believe in God? The implication is that Henry must be guided back into believing in something greater than himself, which can obviously be interpreted in a literal religious context. But can't it also be interpreted figuratively? Isn't it possible that restoring your faith isn't about surrendering to God, but about reclaiming your power as a human being?One of the most elusive characters of the film is Millie Stupek (Morgan Lily), Henry's six-year-old next-door neighbor. Having not spoken since her father left, she's become fascinated with general conversation, going so far as to secretly record them onto a portable cassette player. One night, she touches the image on Henry's wall, and lo and behold, she's compelled to speak again. What I want to know is: Why are conversations so important to her? What is it about people talking that makes her want to keep their words on tape? I have a hard time believing it had anything to do with not speaking to anyone--choosing to remain silent is the same as choosing to be closed off from other people, so what they say to one another makes no difference. Millie's mother, Dawn (Radha Mitchell) doesn't seem to care about that; understandably, she only cares about the fact that her daughter is speaking once again. She also begins to care for Henry, who's having a hard time denying the fact that miracles are happening. From his downtrodden point of view, hope and faith are completely useless.But again, I'm unable to figure out what kind of faith he's referring to. It could be faith in God, but it could also be faith in one's own self. Henry is certainly lacking in that regard; coming from a household of screaming and fighting, he would often retreat to a secluded area under a bridge, essentially hiding from the rest of the world. How much can he believe in himself if he couldn't even turn to other people for comfort? There's no denying Henry Poole is an intriguing character, and I'd be lying if I said that the general story can't touch you at a deep level. But whom is it trying to touch? I was convinced I'd be able to figure that out by the time the film ended, but I was mistaken; the final revelation reverses half of what I thought I knew about the title character's situation, and not in a way that indicates a miracle or even a lack of one. ""Henry Poole Is Here"" is by no means a boring movie, but it most certainly leaves you with more questions than answers. Yes, I get that there are no clear answers in matters of faith. But when a film can't decide which audience to address, indecisiveness is the real issue, not faith.",3,"Are You There, God?

The synopsis and other reviews of this film made really want to dislike this film, sappy saccharine religious redemption films. Fortunately Henry Poole Is Here is a much better film that those preachy religiously bent films. The religious thread is not overbearing.The story is fairly simple and works pretty well. Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) moves into a neighborhood after he's found out he has a fatal disease. He meets a lovely blonde neighbor Dawn (Radha Mitchell) and her daughter Millie (Morgan Lily). The chemistry between these three is excellent. Henry is down on his luck and falls in love with his neighbors. In fact, to me, the entire film centered around these three characters. The others, the priest (George Lopez) and Esperanza were extraneous characters.There are two ways to interpret this film. One is from the Henry Poole perspective, there is no such thing as a miracle, only happenstance. The other is that miracles exist. In the end, both intrepretations make this film an enjoyable and perfectly watchable film.The outstanding part of this film, the soundtrack,Henry Poole Is Here. The Eels, (Souljacker [Bonus Disc]), play Love of the Loveless - deep bluesy Morphine like (Cure for Pain) song during the opening credits. The Blur plays Song 2. Bob Dylan, Not Dark Yet. Ben Harper, Morning Yearning. James Grundler (an unknown to me) plays All Roads Lead Home - this song is included in the sparse bonus features. There was apparently some kind of contest for the title song, Henry Poole is Here, written and sung by Ron Irizarry - also included in the bonus features (one of the weakest songs of the film). The filler music is just that, nothing special, and frequently is overly dramatic.With a great soundtrack you would expect great sound recording. Well in this film you would be wrong. Surround Sound is never used, the sound focuses almost exclusively on the front three channels. Dialog is clear, but the rest is just flat soundspace.Bonus features on the dvd, two music videos, a making of featurette, and trailers - nothing at all special, or really worth watching.Three stars, just about sums up this film. It's a nice somewhat charming film. Shot well, with some minorly creative shooting angles and editing, in focus, and properly exposed. Luke Wilson and Radha Mitchell are excellent. It's the whole supporting cast and story line that brings this film down two stars.

A mysterious stain on the wall of his house becomes the catalyst for several unexplainable events, among them Henry's reconnection to the world.I really had no idea what this movie was about going in.  It's a quiet, gentle film with appealing characters whose message of faith creeps in rather subtly.  Being a nonbeliever, I might not have gone to this film if I had known about the Christian, specifically Catholic, subtext, but I'm glad I did.

1191731,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001FES0JI,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[4, 5]","A heartwarming and uplifting film directed by Mark Pellington (""The Mothman Prophecies"", ""U2 3D"") and starring Luke Wilson as Henry Poole who is looking to buy  a home and is escorted by his real estate agent (played by Cheryl Hines, ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"").For Poole, he wants the home across the street for some reason but since the home that is available on that street is an unkept home that is being sold for a lot more money than it's worth, Poole tells the agent that he wants the home.  The agent says that she wants to fix the home but Poole tells her it doesn't matter since he won't be living there that long.  When she asks what he means by that, he shrugs it off.Henry wants to get away from everything and live at the home with no hassles or distractions.  But unfortunately, things are not going as smooth as he would like.He hears his voice and his realtor's voice and realizes a young girl next door is recording conversations.  Henry tries to talk to her but she runs off.Unfortunately, things don't work his way when his neighbor Esperanza goes to his home and finds a stain in the wall that looks like Jesus.  Henry is not a man who wants to think about faith at the moment and doesn't want anyone coming to his home without permission.  But next thing you know Esperanza gets her priest Father Salazar involved and next thing you know, friends and believers start leaving candles and start showing up at Henry Poole's home unannounced.But something is going on with that stain in the wall, there is some red drips coming out and Esperanza tells him that it's holy blood but he can't believe in that.Meanwhile, the young girl next door is by the stain and Henry tries to stop and talk to her and she drops her recorder.  He returns it next door and meets the girl's mother, Dawn (played by Radha Mitchell).  It appears that since her ex-husband left them, her daughter Millie has not said a word for nearly a year.  She's been depressed and her mother worries about her.One early morning, as Dawn tries to look for her daughter, she finds her touching the stain on Henry's home.  All of a sudden, she starts talking again.  Henry hears the commotion and realizes that she's talked but doesn't believe it's a miracle but that it's just a stain on his home's wall.But another miracle happens when a nosy shopping clerk goes to Poole's home to touch the stain and her eyesight is cured.Henry still refuses to believe in the stain, refuses to believe in miracles and it is revealed that the reason why he is always sad and angry is because he is dying.  The only reason why he wanted to move back in that neighborhood was to live in his old home, where he remembers fond memories of being happy.But meeting Dawn and Millie has changed his life but he feels it's unfair for him to get close to a woman and her daughter since he is dying.VIDEO & AUDIO:The video quality of ""HENRY POOLE IS HERE"" was nice and colorful.  A lot of footage was filmed during sunny Southern California weather and a lot of the footage is filmed outdoors.  The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen (2:40:1).As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Surround 5.1.  The film is primarily all dialogue and no special effects in terms of audio being utilized.  If anything, the dialogue is clear and understandable and the film tends to use music quite a bit and the music comes out loud and clear as well.SPECIAL FEATURES:The special features featured on ""HENRY POOLE IS HERE"" are:* Audio Commentary with Director Mark Pellington and Writer Albert Torres - The two discuss the filming of ""HENRY POOL IS HERE"" and working with the talent to develop the story.  Especially to make Radha Mitchell's role more important in the film.* The Making of Hery Pool is Here - a 15+ minute featurette on the making of the film and interviews with the main talent and the director and writer.  Wilson talks about how the community were so supportive of the film crew shooting a film in their neighborhood and getting to meet the locals.  And much more about the film behind-the-scenes.* ""All Roads Lead Home"" Music Video* ""Henry Poole is Here"" Music Video directed by Mark Pellington and performed by myspace.co theme song contest winner Ron Irizarry.* Theatrical TrailerOverall, I felt that ""HENRY POOL IS HERE"" was a touching and heartwarming film.  I felt the concept of a film based around a stain that looked like Jesus was an interesting story because you see these happen in the headlines.  In fact, my family are the type that would probably travel that far to put candles and statues near the site.  So, I pretty much can understand how people would go so far and want to ask a stain to grant them a miracle.Luke Wilson as Henry Poole does a good job as portraying a character that is sad and angry but eventually through the people he meets, he starts to open up.  But knowing the situation of his health, he tries to push himself away from any happiness.Radha Mitchell as Dawn does a good job as trying to be that support for Poole and Adriana Barraza as Esperanza does a great job of being that neighbor who is quite persistent and always believing that the stain is a miracle.But nevertheless, the film is heartwarming and touching.  By no means does this film become preachy in no sort of way.  Definitely give it a chance.",4,A heartwarming film that is worth giving a chance!,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,5325,"['heartwarming', 'uplifting', 'film', 'directed', 'Mark', 'Pellington',

He buys a house at full market price, despite the fact that it badly needs painting and landscaping. Henry tells his real-estate agent (Cheryl Hinds) and a priest (George Lopez) not to worry about the house because he ""won't be here for very long."" Patience, (Rachel Seiferth) the local grocery store check-out girl, wonders if Henry is ""angry, sad, or both."" Henry's neighbor Esperonza (Adriana Barraza) is convinced she sees the face of Jesus Christ on the  outside back wall of Henry's house. Henry insists it is merely a water stain from a bad paint job. The ""face"" won't disappear, and soon a blood stain appears next to it. Esperonza is certain it is ""Christ's Blood.""Henry's other neighbor is the beautiful Dawn (Radha Mitchell). Dawn's daughter Millie (Morgan Lily) hasn't spoken in a year since her father left. She does wander about tape-recording other people's conversations, however. After both Patience and Lily experience ""miracles"" after touching the ""face"" on the wall, Henry's house becomes the neighborhood hot-spot for those seeking divine intervention. When Henry spots of group of old ladies praying in the driveway, he yells, ""Hey, Holy Shoulders!"" Henry, being diagnosed with a ""terminal illness"", needs a ""miracle"" too. Will doubtful Henry reach out and touch ""the face"" on the wall? If so, will he receive a miracle from God or a miracle only made in the movies?The biggest question is not ""what will Henry do?"", but what kind of movie does ""Henry Poole Is Here"" want to be? I'd classify it as a ""quirky dramedy"" (half drama-half comedy). Several of the characters and performances, particularly Barraza and Seiferth, are quirky. Luke Wilson, full of quiet sorrow, desperation, and honest skeptisism, manages to keep the movie rooted in reality. The movie may be ""inspirational"" to some (perhaps many). But there are large amounts of contrivances in Albert Torres' script. As the contrivances and sentimentalities  piled up, I felt more emotionally manipulated than  earnestly and honestly inspired. I scatched my head and wondered, ""Why didn't Henry just go to another Doctor for a second opinion long ago?"" In the battle of inspiration VS. skeptisism and manipulation, ""Henry Poole Is Here"" ends in a draw.DVD Special Features include: Audio Commentary with director Mark Pellington, ""Making Of"" Feature, music videos, theatrical trailer.

That being said, I thought he was absolutely fantastic in this movie.  Here, he inhabits a character that embodies his strenghts as an actor.  Henry Poole is an angry and depressed individual who knows that his time on this earth is short and Wilson really shines in this role.  Being agnostic, I was wary that this film would try to push the agenda of religion upon me, yet I felt that this is the kind of movie that can appeal to believers and non-believers alike.  Instead, it's about what one believes.  The character of Esperanza believes that there is the face of Jesus on Henry's wall.  Henry sticks to his guns and thinks it's a bad stucco job.  Never does the movie try to sway you in either direction which was quite refreshing.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Sometimes miracles don't have to be big or obvious to happen -- they can just be a nudge in the right direction.That seems to be the message of ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" a bittersweet little dramedy about a lonely, embittered man who refuses to believe in miracles, until the source of them starts to change his own life. While the semi-religious content isn't overwhelming, the story drags out too long with too many lingering shots of Luke Wilson looking sad.Diagnosed with a rare, fatal disease, Henry Poole (Wilson) moves into a house in his old neighborhood, saying that he ""won't be here long."" But then his neighbor Esperanza (Adriana Barraza) sees a stain on his wall, and proclaims that it's the face of Christ. She even calls in her local priest (George Lopez), who is optimistically skeptical.Henry is insistent that miracles ""just don't happen in real life,"" especially since he's now dying. But after a recurring spot of blood keeps appearing on the wall, a child starts talking again and a girl suddenly sees clearly. And Henry starts to form a connection with the pretty divorcee next door (Radha Mitchell), before he gets a surprise of his own.For a dramedy, ""Henry Poole Is Here"" isn't very amusing or comedic -- it's pretty earnest in its pro-inspiration message, and has quite a few poignant moments (such as Espereranza's reminiscences about her boyfriend). And through the entire story, we follow Henry's transformation from a lonely, sarcastic, embittered man into a guy who might actually be willing to trust that things can turn out right.I'll admit it, I don't see any shape in the wall stain. But hey, the miraclecentric  storyline thankfully doesn't slather on the religious content too thickly -- rather it's about the openness to believe, and the willingness to live life happily.As pleasant as this is, the movie does have some flaws. The big one is that it moves verrrrrrryyy slooowwwwllly. About half the movie seems to be long lingering shots of Wilson sunbathing, sleeping, wandering around, running through canals, staring off into space, et cetera. It seems to have been filmed that way to fill up space in the rather shortish storyline.Wilson is doing his best James Stewart here -- gravel-voiced, quiet, and yet able to conjure up deep-rooted bitterness and sadness (such as when Esperanza takes him on a tour of his old home). Mitchell is quite good as well, and Barraza does a lovely job with a complex, hopeful character who could have easily become a parody of the religious.""Henry Poole is Here"" is a little film with a big heart, but not much meat on its bones.

His portrayal of a loner so depressed because he has a terminal illness that he has nothing to live for was very convincing, and his character really made you feel empathetic.""Henry Poole is Here"" doesn't hammer you with religious jargon, but the themes presented are merely a reminder that everybody should have something to live for and that no matter the circumstances, faith should never be lost.

How, we wondered, did this fly under the box office radar? Why was the public subjected to ""Transformers II"" instead?Luke Wilson gives one of his best performances here, playing the part of Henry Poole, a man who buys a house in his old southern Cal neighborhood, then closes up the windows and drinks himself into a stupor. Soon, his depressive ways are interrupted by a friendly, yet nosy, neighbor. Esperanza has past ties to the house, and in her desire to maintain some link, she believes she finds the face of Christ visible in stucco water stains. Poole gets impatient when Esperanza calls in the Catholic Church to verify her ""find,"" and also calls in the local biddies to light candles and pay homage at the back wall of his home.What starts as a straightforward story of skepticism versus belief turns into a deeper story about faith, hope, and love. There are humorous moments, including some sublime scenes between Poole and a grocery checker named Patience. The acting is great--particularly with Poole, Dawn, and Esperanza's parts--and there are some nice bits of dialogue. A scene in which Poole picks up an ax also broods with potential power. However, the slow pace and music sometimes gave us the sense we were being squeezed for emotion.This film shows that Hollywood is not all glitz and ditziness (refer back to ""Transformers II""), but can actually search for deeper meaning. For me, however, this Poole was not as deep as I hoped. The lack of details regarding Poole's terminal condition and the obvious tweaks for an emotional reaction left me still struggling to believe.

1191741,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B001FES0JI,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[1, 2]","""Henry Poole is here"" is an introspective movie about the power of hope, faith, and positive thinking. We see a man who was successful, had a great job and relationship walk into a doctor's office to be told that his life will soon be over.Broken hearted, Henry Poole loses his impetus to live and tries to buy the house where he grew up but it is not for sale. He buys within blocks of his parental home and while the house requires lots of work and improvements, he has no desire because ""he will not be around for long.""Henry is looking for solitude but he soon begins to experience visits by neighbors, starting with a lady by the name of Esperanza [Hope in English] who lives up to her name and wants the young man to liven up. Esperanza brings Henry a welcome dish and tries to engage him in conversation, but she gets the door closed in her face.Masterfully played by Adriana Barraza, Esperanza is the local gossiper, the person in charge of keeping the neighborhood aware of each other's stories. One day, Henry notices Esperanza outside his window and walks outside to tell her that his property is private and that she can not simply walk into his yard as she pleases but he finds a transfigured Esperanza staring at the freshly painted but yet stained wall on the side of his house.Esperanza believes that the stain is the image of Jesus Christ and that it is a miracle, so she asks the local priest to confirm her findings and brings people to place flowers and pray by Henry's wall.This behavior infuriates Henry who finds that his dream of introspective solitude is disappearing fast. A six year old girl who lives next door, tenderly played by Morgan Lily, is withdrawn, sad and spends her time taping the conversations of others as she lives in a world of silence, has not said a word since her father abandoned her. She tapes Henry's voice and he is captivated by this child whose mother, Dawn, played by Radha Mitchell, soon becomes his confidant and once she learns the truth about Henry's outlook on life, she enters into a relationship with him.The story develops into a rather poignant story of self discovery and the power of hope, faith, and relationships.

1191744,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B001FES0JI,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[2, 3]","You've got to give a lot of credit to the talents behind HENRY POOLE IS HERE for attempting the extreeeeeemely difficult goal of an inspirational story where God and miracles are the issue for the widest audience possible. Their goal seemed not to proselytize but to combine the thoughts behind writer Albert Torres' story ""The Stain"" and director Mark Pellington's personal experience in the loss of his wife (check out the inside flyer for his essay).But like musicals, movies like this tend to polarize people because it addresses subjects so deep-seeded and personal. For this reason, the filmmakers clearly went out of their way NOT to make a religious movie, so the overall effect is not to commit to any definite statement except that we, as humans, need to believe. Whether taking a more definitive stand would have been better or worse is immaterial -- from the other reviews I can see that the very issues in this movie raise hackles big time. But it must be noted that even films with a more pronounced attitude still polarize because they may have done it too much or not enough to satisfy everyone. Even the Veggie Tales films do not please everyone!So let's focus on the performances, since they are all outstanding. Luke Wilson should be a much bigger star and has all the right qualifications. Perhaps he prefers smaller, more personal films and more power to him. In less capable hands, the character of Henry could very well be hard to take. Interestingly, on the audio commentary, Pellington and Torres mention Jim Carrey often as previously associated with the project and made some contributions before it went to Wilson.  Maybe he or his ""people"" were concerned with that polarizing effect and wanted a bigger film.The commentary is particularly interesting for students of film because Pellington mentions several ""truths"" about the movie making process, including the difference between a movie project as it is written, as it is shot and as it is edited. There are also some deleted scenes mentioned that do not appear on the standard DVD version.To me, the Adriana Barraza walks off with the film. Like Wilson, she makes a character that could be obnoxious very real and endearing whether you agree with her or not. In a way, the viewer responds to her character the way Henry does -- a nice lady who cares deeply and believes deeply. George Lopez also turns in a wonderful, restrained performance as a priest that isn't a cartoon of piety.Apparently this film was many years in the making and was likely a difficult sell in Hollywood. It is to the credit of those who wanted to see it completed, and an award winner too, that their vision, such as it is, was finally brought to fruition. It certainly is moving, doesn't hammer in a heavy message for those who don't want to deal with that and doesn't make fun of  those who do believe. A tough task indeed.PARENT'S NOTE: The movie has some language, including the lead character saying ""holy s---.""

To suggest that diagnosis of terminal illness is commonly mistaken or to suggest that God sends miracles to a chosen few is an affront to all who deal with life ending illness.Second, to suggest that the vehicle by which God sends miracles is through a few drops of something on a building (or any other artifact) does a disservice to the core values and essence of any religion.Third, on the positive side the movie does do a respectable job of portraying rational thought in conflict with irrational belief.",2,Poorly Researched,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,883,"['three', 'main', 'points', 'sustain', 'movie.First', 'am', 'familiar', 'terminal', 'illness', 'how', 'diagnosed', 'medical', 'setting', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'dishonest', 'view', 'patient', 'diagnosis', 'subsequent', 'treatment', 'potential', 'end', 'life', 'illness', 'specifics', 'testing', 'procedures', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'shown', 'movie', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'thorough', 'suggest', 'diagnosis', 'terminal', 'illness', 'commonly', 'mistaken', 'suggest', 'God', 'miracles', 'chosen', 'few', 'affront', 'who', 'deal', 'life', 'ending', 'illness.Second', 'suggest', 'vehicle', 'God', 'miracles', 'few', 'drops', 'something', 'building', 'other', 'artifact', 'disservice', 'core', 'values', 'essence', 'religion.Third', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'do', 'respectable', 'job', 'portraying', 'rational', 'thought', 'conflict', 'irrational', 'belief']",N/A

Unfortunately, the poor reclusive slob's dreams of peaceful solitude are soon shattered by his nosey, Gladys Kravitz-type neighbor, Esperanza, who insists that a water stain on his stucco resembles the face of Christ.  In no time at all, the whole town is lined up in Henry's backyard to stare at the wall while questioning the new homeowner as to why he's in a perpetual bad mood.  Unfortunately for viewers, the exact cause of Henry Poole's depression is never really explained in enough detail to make his actions plausible.  Fleeting flashbacks and music montages may tug at the heartstrings, but the whole scenario still doesn't make a lot of sense.  You'd think Mr. Poole would've at least asked a few questions before just buying a house and taking up alcoholism.The Henry Poole DVD includes both a widescreen and a full frame transfer, plus a couple of music videos and a commentary with the writer and the director.  This film is worth a rental, but I wouldn't recommend buying it since it's probably not something you'll want to watch multiple times.  Unlike most of today's movies, Henry Poole is very family friendly (only a couple of cuss words), and -- even more amazing -- it portrays religion in a positive light.

The story's emotional ride resembles a pulled train more than a rocket, snaking around the characterization and details necessary to escalate the narrative.Based on a script by Albert Torres, the movie serves as catharsis for Director Mark Pellington, who four years earlier lost his young wife to complications from a ruptured spleen. Pellington's direction here is noticeably lighter than in eitherThe Mothman PropheciesandArlington Road.Luke Wilson stars as Henry Poole, a man with a rare, terminal disease (we never learn the name) who moves back to his old neighborhood for solitude and a quiet death. He solemnly executes his plan until a water stain on his house attracts his neighbor's attention (Adriana Barraza as Esperanza). She sees the healing image of Jesus.Others soon come to see the miraculous image. Henry is drawn into their lives against his wishes for privacy.I forgave the story's inclusion of a cute child, a sexy (and single) neighbor and the quirky yet wise observer. However, the pop music montages were overkill. Better suited for stage direction - scene closes, cue song, close curtains - the emotional soundtrack (including Bob Dylan's ""Not Dark Yet"") wore me down. After the third montage, I expected Pellington to employ the one-word cue card routine from Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues music video, featured on hisDon't Look Back 1965 Tour Documentary.Despite some minor sins, ""Henry Poole is Here"" is a satisfying indie drama that should appeal to believers and atheists alike.",4,Satisfying indie drama appeals to believers and atheists alike,1232582400,"01 22, 2009",2009,1717,"['modest', 'fable', 'faith', 'hope', 'aims', 'move', 'audience', 'occasionally', 'succeeding', 'indie', 'film', 'also', 'clich', 'eacute', 'contrived', 'plot', 'devices', 'common', 'genre', 'story', 'emotional', 'ride', 'pulled', 'train', 'more', 'rocket', 'snaking', 'characterization', 'details', 'necessary', 'escalate', 'narrative.Based', 'script', 'Albert', 'Torres', 'movie', 'catharsis', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'who', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'lost', 'young', 'wife', 'complications', 'ruptured', 'spleen', 'Pellington', 'direction', 'here', 'noticeably', 'lighter', 'eitherThe', 'Mothman', 'PropheciesandArlington', 'Road.Luke', 'Wilson', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'man', 'rare', 'terminal', 'disease', 'never', 'learn', 'name', 'who', 'back', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'solitude', 'quiet', 'death', 'solemnly', 'plan', 'water', 'stain', 'house', 'neighbor', 'attention', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'Esperanza', 'healing', 'image', 'Jesus.Others', 'soon', 'come', 'see', 'miraculous', 'image', 'Henry', 'drawn', 'lives', 'wishes', 'privacy.I', 'forgave', 'story', 'inclusion', 'cute', 'child', 'sexy', 'single', 'neighbor', 'quirky', 'yet', 'wise', 'observer', 'However', 'pop', 'music', 'montages', 'were', 'overkill', 'Better', 'suited', 'stage', 'direction', 'scene', 'closes', 'cue', 'song', 'close', 'curtains', 'emotional', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Not', 'Dark', 'Yet', 'down', 'third', 'montage', 'expected', 'Pellington', 'employ', 'one-word', 'cue', 'card', 'routine', 'Dylan', 'Subterranean', 'Homesick', 'Blues', 'music', 'video', 'featured', 'hisDo', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', '1965', 'Tour', 'Documentary.Despite', 'minor', 'sins', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'Here', 'satisfying', 'indie', 'drama', 'should', 'appeal', 'believers', 'atheists', 'alike']",N/A

This warmhearted, emotionally uplifting film should be enjoyed by the entire family.This film touched my heart for several reasons.  First of all, I have a dear friend, Andrea, who is dying from a rare form of aggressive cancer.  Imagine having a tumor the size of a basketball growing inside your stomach.  Andrea continues to hold onto her faith despite the odds against her.  I told her, ""As long as you're alive, there is always hope.""I myself have experienced miraculous healings because I had faith that the Lord would heal me.  For example, I suffered a ruptured disc in my lower back that caused me excruciating pain.  Fortunately, I was healed without surgery.  Five years after my accident, I feel great.""Henry Poole is Here"" is a story about having faith that miracles do happen.  Most of all, it's about having faith in yourself.  The portrait of Jesus on the stucco wall is a catalyst for increasing the faith of Henry's neighbors.  Was it a stain or the actual image of Jesus?  That is inconsequential.  You can see God's miracles by simply looking around.  An ugly, wrinkled seed growing into a beautiful flower is a miracle.  A bird hatching from a small egg is a miracle.The image on the wall looked like anyone.  After all, we were all made in God's image.  Like God, we can bring miracles into existence simply by having faith.The moral of this beautiful, well crafted film is:  We must learn to live in the present.  We must live now, in the moment.  None of us are guaranteed another day.  We are all like Henry Poole.This film is an excellent account of how one man is able to learn to live again.  He must let go of the painful past and learn to find love in the present.""Henry Poole is Here"" is very romantic.  Luke Wilson and Radha Mitchell have great chemistry.  They make a cute couple.  The supporting cast is outstanding.""Henry Poole is Here"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy poignant, emotional dramas that lift your spirits.  ""The Visitor"" (another superb DVD release from Anchor Bay) is another such film.  It teaches us not to judge others who are different but to look at the world through their eyes.

The central plot was too muddled, is Henry Poole really suffering from a terminal illness? Supposedly not, as the crucial scene showing the nurse looking confused over the blood vials, and apparently getting the labels wrong, was cut. In the deleted scene the director commentary assumed that her confused look remained and that was sufficient to inform the audience without the label swap. He didn't seem aware that the entire segment was cut! So the central idea of the entire movie was missed, and I just assumed that this was a preachy, religious movie where miracles save all deserving believers.

One reviewer mentioned the extreme number of introspective Luke Wilson shots and I have to agree. However, there are much worse faces to stare at.Henry Poole is looking for something, so he plants himself where it all began in a desperate  attempt to find it. He sums up his search when touring his old home, ""This is the last place I remember being happy."" But happiness and peace elude him as he discovers that you can't go back, especially when you are still haunted by ghosts from the past. Henry is also tormented by fears of future and the resulting loneliness of battling the spirits of past, present and future.The matriarch of his neighborhood discovers a miracle in Henry's back yard. And it becomes even harder for Henry to find happiness and peace in the midst of a crowd.Fast-paced this film is not. Family friendly, as good as it gets, I think there were a total of three S-words and a few random assorted tamer words. However, most kids will not want to sit through it. There are some religious/faith elements but they are pretty open-ended. More along the lines of faith is good, whatever that looks like, than pushy.

I decided some time ago, completely ignoring how much I likedIdiocracy, Luke Wilson (and his brother too, for that matter) is an actor to be avoided at all costs. Yet, I must reluctantly admit Henry Poole isn't a bad movie.The titular character has constituted his personal purgatory, in the neighborhood where he grew up, close to his childhood home, the one he so wanted to purchase but was unable to wrest from the current owner. He aspires to be sequestered to wait out his demise, brought on by a terminal illness revealed to him by his rather Calvinist physician (played Richard Benjamin is his typically dry manner). All would be copacetic if not for initially, his busybody next neighbor Esperanza (Adriana Barraza of Babel) played in the fashion of a latino Gladys Kravitz, who discovers what she considers to be the visage of Jesus in what I believe most of us would only determine to be a water stain on the stuccoed outer wall of the morose Mr. Poole's  deteriorating abode.  Subsequently, he finds discovers an affinity with the curiously reticent and reclusive (and requisitely) adorable young girl who lives in the other house next door, bringing forth an entirely separate set of life challenges.From that point on, the film becomes an examination of faith/determinism and the possibilities of reawakening, hopefulness and enlightenment. I have to acknowledge this vein of investigation is not my customary ball of yarn and when I do choose to unravel it, I would prefer a bit more objectivity as I thought there was at least one juncture late in the film where there was a perfect opportunity to circumvent the perfunctory happy ending without significant alteration to what I saw to be the underlying message and symbolism.Yet for viewers seeking a story of positivity on a marginally predictable journey to catharsis, this movie has some value.",3,The World doesn't have to stop but I am getting off.,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",2009,2023,"['found', 'film', 'unsettling', 'not', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'acting', 'eventual', 'resolution', 'rather', 'had', 'review', 'pre-written', 'hate', 'recant', 'decided', 'time', 'ago', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'how', 'much', 'likedIdiocracy', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'too', 'matter', 'actor', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'must', 'reluctantly', 'admit', 'Henry', 'Poole', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie.The', 'titular', 'character', 'constituted', 'personal', 'purgatory', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'close', 'childhood', 'home', 'one', 'so', 'wanted', 'purchase', 'was', 'unable', 'wrest', 'current', 'owner', 'be', 'sequestered', 'wait', 'out', 'demise', 'brought', 'terminal', 'illness', 'revealed', 'rather', 'Calvinist', 'physician', 'played', 'Richard', 'Benjamin', 'typically', 'dry', 'manner', 'would', 'be', 'copacetic', 'not', 'initially', 'busybody', 'next', 'neighbor', 'Esperanza', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'Babel', 'played', 'fashion', 'latino', 'Gladys', 'Kravitz', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'visage', 'Jesus', 'what', 'believe', 'most', 'would', 'only', 'determine', 'be', 'water', 'stain', 'stuccoed', 'outer', 'wall', 'morose', 'Mr.', 'Poole', 'deteriorating', 'abode', 'Subsequently', 'discovers', 'affinity', 'curiously', 'reticent', 'reclusive', 'requisitely', 'adorable', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'other', 'house', 'next', 'door', 'bringing', 'forth', 'entirely', 'separate', 'set', 'life', 'challenges.From', 'point', 'film', 'examination', 'faith/determinism', 'possibilities', 'reawakening', 'hopefulness', 'enlightenment', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'vein', 'investigation', 'not', 'customary', 'ball', 'yarn', 'when', 'do', 'choose', 'unravel', 'would', 'prefer', 'bit', 'more', 'objectivity', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'least', 'one', 'juncture', 'late', 'film', 'where', 'was', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'circumvent', 'perfunctory', 'happy', 'ending', 'significant', 'alteration', 'what', 'saw', 'be', 'underlying', 'message', 'symbolism.Yet', 'viewers', 'seeking', 'story', 'positivity', 'marginally', 'predictable', 'journey', 'catharsis', 'movie', 'value']",N/A

Some just give up, and let someone else do the work, if they have anyone to do the work for them.  Henry Poole is introduced to us as a mysterious man with a secret, that he'd rather not share, but in reality knows that he should.  Played by the often under-appreciated actor, Luke Wilson, in a very well cast role.  His life is changing in a direction he did not plan or hope, and he has embraced the change by choosing loneliness.  We don't understand his situation, and can only assume along the way.  All we know at the beginning is that we feel sorry for him, and it's exactly how he wants you to feel.Henry's mysterious life changing event brings him to a neighborhood familiar to most anyone, where every house is made of ticky tacky.  However, he is determined to live in this specific neighborhood, and desires a specific house ... but it's not for sale.  He tries his best to buy the house at any cost, but the owners refuse.  He settles for the closest property near the house, and buys it at full price, without any care of negotiation or renovation.  He simply moves the bare necessities in which include a mattress, a reclining lawn chair with plenty of junk food and bottled beverages. Let just say the beverages become his only spirit.You can curb your enthusiasm about Cheryl Hines being in the film as she is in and out at the start of the film.  Cheryl plays the Realtor of the home, and it's clearly the easiest sale she ever had. Though Henry says he'll take it at the asking price, she still tries to lessen her commission with guilt, as the home needs some work.  She urges Henry to at least accept her offer to fix the exterior of the home.  He refuses, but, she had the work done regardless of his wishes.  This is where the story begins.We soon meet various neighbors, and one exceptionally friendly (i.e. nosey gossiper) woman offering a plate of welcome tamales and her name.  Henry takes the plate and offers her only the door.  But that does not seem to deter her persistence in an ongoing effort to learn more about the mysterious Mr. Poole.  Her name is Esperanza, and she is the fuel of the movie.  Played by Adriana Barraza, a major star of Mexican entertainment and movies, and most notably in America for her Oscar nominated role as Amelia in the Brad Pitt film , ""Babel"".  She brings the much needed comedic breaks in the film and works well against the brief appearances of her Priest, played by comedian, George Lopez.  But with her comedy comes drama, and she has a connection to the house he chose, as he has a connection to the house he would prefer.  Soon after meeting Esperanza, she becomes obsessed with a water stain on the newly applied stucco to Henry's exterior wall in his backyard.  He cannot keep her out of his yard, and soon many make their way to his yard against his wishes.  He soon becomes hostile with the defiance of his simple demand to be left alone, and for people to stay off his property.Enter mysterious little girl, lonely mother, insecure checkout girl concerned with Henry's beverage and food choices, and Jesus... if you choose to believe.A beautiful film and visually intriguing.  You feel boxed in and wonder what is outside the box, and never get out of it until the end.  The confinement is very affective and necessary.  Directed by Mark Pellington most known for some great music videos by some of my favorite artists including Keane, The Fray and even Leonard Cohen, along with major names such as Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam etc.  A few notable feature films under his belt includeThe Mothman Prophecies,Arlington Roadand U2 3D to name a few.TheHenry Poole Is Heresoundtrack is quite inspired with songs that oddly work well together.  I love Vince Clark's ""Only You"" sung by Joshua Radin and Eels, along with some great indie acts are quite welcomed doing obscure covers of Ben Harper, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and more. There was a MySpace contest that apparently was looking for a song that would appear in the movie and a music video would be directed by Pellington.  The music video is included, and was great, the song is called ""Henry Poole is Here"" by Ron Irizzary.  A nice song, but it has the feeling that the title replaced an original title.  But, it's ok, it works.Look for some brief appearances from familiar faces of favorite character actors such as one of those faces you know once you see her, Beth Grant from well over 100 films and TV shows. Most surprisingly, Richard Benjamin from some great obscure favorites of mine likeWestworldwith Yul Brynner, the short-live sci-fi TV seriesQuark - The Complete Series(Buy this boxed set, it's so cheap!), and probably his most expected work directing the remake ofNeil Simon's The Goodbye Girl (2004 TV Movie), not to mention a great run of films from the 70's and 80's.  It was great to see his random face here, albeit briefly, but key to the plot. ... Sorry, I get a bit respectful with unsung names of Hollywood.What transpires in the film are several lives with many secrets, varied hopes, determined beliefs, but all need the power to continue their hope.  Henry changes several lives without knowing it, which soon will change his.  The result is truly inspirational, and possibly unexpected, depending on how you choose to watch the film.Will he live in the past?Will he live in the future?Or will he simply live for the moment?It's

1191764,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B001FES0JI,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","Henry Poole is a mysterious stranger when he moves into a quaint, California neighborhood. He is quiet, keeps to himself, and seems to do nothing but lay around all day long. It's clear to his concerned new neighbors that something is very wrong; that Henry is sad and angry for some unknown reason. But nothing Henry is able to do or say will keep the locals at bay when a water stain appears on an outside wall of his new home with the likeness of Jesus Christ. The ensuing crowd of believers are exactly the opposite of what Henry is in the mood for right now, and his growing connection to the woman next door and her small daughter only serve to confuse Henry more. Will Henry's dark mood ever change? What's his big secret, and will he soften to the ideas of faith and hope present all around him, despite the darkness he is haunted by?""Henry Poole is Here"" is a tale of one man's struggle to deal with personal tragedy, loss, and fear in his own defeatist way, while those around him do their best to bring him out of the darkness with faith, hope, and love. If it sounds like a very saccharine story, it kind of is when all is said and done. I like this film, I really do, because there is some very sincere acting and Luke Wilson is always enjoyable (a very underrated and underused actor, in my opinion), and the film's message to never give up hope that things will be okay in the end is a good one most of the time. However, in some scenarios of bleakness, it's a bit much to think there will be a light at the end of the tunnel, and such is the case with Henry Poole. How his trouble is resolved in the end is just so unlikely that it's hard to absorb the film's heartwarming lesson. Then again, maybe I am just jaded from personal experiences, but like Henry, I have lost my faith in everything in recent years, and if that serves to put this movie to the test, I can only say that I found it to be an enjoyable film, but not one that uplifted me on a personal level. The odds against Henry's happy ending are just far too high, making it seem too much like a fairytale to be faith-restoring film for me. In fact, people in general aren't even this friendly in real-life. If a cute check-out girl was ever as nice to me as the one in this film is to Henry, it would lift my spirits no matter what my mood or situation, but cute girls are just not that nice in reality. Henry Poole is a delightful film, but unless you believe miracles are going to be around to help you when you have serious problems (a belief that has failed countless multitudes), I doubt it will lift the spirits of someone feeling very low about their situation, but I guess that depends on the person. So, basically, I like it. The cast is great and I'd like to see Luke Wilson get more lead roles, because I think he's excellent. The movie successfully made me cry quite a few times. However, while the filmmakers wanted very much for this film to not come off religious but just ""inspirational"", I have to say it didn't work for me so much in that way. It has some wonderful moments, but in the end, it is hard to get the lessons of faith and hope since the easy out Henry gets from his ""problem"" is just so unlikely. Of course, the alternative would have been too tragic for a film like this. But, if you really are looking for something to slam hard the lesson of ""never giving up"" into someone, I greatly recommend the film ""The Mist"". Granted, in that film's case, the bleak situation itself is something many folks might not be willing to take seriously, but the lesson in the end, that same lesson to never give up hope, is far more powerful.So, view this one as a cute, fairytale-like drama story with some fine performances.

1191766,A1ZM846Y7AUYD,B001FES0JI,M. Pickering,"[0, 3]","Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) is a man convinced that his future is bleak and soon to end.  He buys a simple house in a low-key suburban neighborhood, and tries to avoid any sort of interaction with other people.  He is extremely depressed and seems to just be biding his time and awaiting the end.  But his newly purchased home suddenly attracts the attention of a neighbor, who sees the image of Jesus in a water stain on one of the stucco walls.  Henry pays this little attention, as he continues to drink and sleep all day.  When the neighbor starts calling others to come and look at the wall, Henry becomes increasingly angry.  Over time more and more people visit Henry's home, uninvited, to see the miraculous vision of The Christ on his wall.Not wanting to give away too many details of this movie I will refrain from telling more of the story.  I can say that Like Wilson plays his role in an extremely believable fashion.  I found myself feeling sorry for him while also being annoyed with his incredible self pity and rudeness to others.  Even when miracles appear to occur all around him he becomes more and more agitated with the strong faith that others in his neighborhood seem to have in God.  After all, given Henry's unfortunate circumstances he could not have faith in a God that could let this sort of thing happen to him.The film tends to move quite slowly at times (most times), with a few poor attempts at humor, a violent outburst or two, and the typical inclusion of a touching and growing romance.  Still, the movie was interesting enough to keep my attention, and I am glad to have watched it.  It is cute and I enjoyed the struggle between life's hopeless elements and faith in a higher power that has the potential to change everything.  Although I am glad I took the opportunity to watch this film, I doubt I will ever watch it again.  The depression of the main character tends to make a great deal of the story a real downer.  The religious tones in the movie may end up rubbing many viewers the wrong way.  Non-believers may just find the religious elements annoying, while believers may not appreciate the manner in which these religious references are carried out.  Overall the subject matter is potentially controversial and I just didn't find the movie entertaining enough to pop the disk in my DVD player again.

He just wants to be left alone, but his neighbors insists upon interpreting a water stain on his wall as an image of God, a miracle.What I kept thinking throughout the film was that this isLeaving Las Vegaswith a religious twist.  While Nic Cage's character wants to be left alone to drink himself to death, and goes to the place where he can be most anonymous, Luke Wilson's character (Henry Poole) goes to his old neighborhood to drink, eat and be depressed about the circumstances of his life beyond his control.  The trouble is that everybody wants to  be nice, wonders what's wrong with him, or wants to become his friend, or wants to worship at his wall.  The film screams out that this is a man who needs to, even wants, to be ""saved"" but is unwilling or unable to accept the possibility that life could have happiness in store for him - but beneath his gruff and sad and angry exterior, he does go out of his way a bit more than I'd expect: to reach out, to spend time with the meddlesome Esperanza, to befriend (and romance) a pretty neighbor and her withdrawn, silent, and shy daughter, who has a habit of tape recording Henry's conversations and playing them back later so he gets a chance to hear himself from outside.The overall message of the film didn't resonate all that much with me, but, I should say, it was clearly and simply told.  The acting was solid enough for the parts as written, and the characters ended up feeling more plausible and real than I initially thought they'd be.  Films cover the range of human experience, and I have to admire a film that would be willing to try and convey what it is like to be a ""true believer"" (just as much as I'd admire films that aim to clarify other unique ways of thinking and seeing).  I appreciated at first the fact that the film didn't insist in the reality of miracles, merely attempted to show the possibility of interpreting events as miracles, and that that mindset could make a difference.  It got a bit more heavy handed with the message as the film progressed, moving from the idea that events can be interpreted either from the standpoint of faith or the standpoint of disbelief to the idea that ""nonbelievers"" are ultimately denying what in their hearts they know to be true.  To the extent this happened I was a bit turned off. The music (""Love of the Loveless"" from the Eels, ""Promises"" from Badly Drawn Boy, ""All Roads Lead Home"" from Golden State, ...), depending on your read of the themes of the film, can be said either to support the theme nicely, or to lay it on thick, that redemption is a real possibility and all it takes is to believe.  Of course, since this is a Hollywood film: part of the heroes' redemption is meeting the beautiful girl next door and being on the way to living happily ever after.",2,"Ultimately unconvincing, but sincere attempt to portray what it's like to believe in miracles",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,2979,"['Unable', 'move', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'house', 'nearby', 'unconcerned', 'overpriced', 'poor', 'condition', ""n't"", 'plan', 'be', 'there', 'long', 'just', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'neighbors', 'interpreting', 'water', 'stain', 'wall', 'image', 'God', 'miracle.What', 'kept', 'thinking', 'film', 'was', 'isLeaving', 'Las', 'Vegaswith', 'religious', 'twist', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'character', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'drink', 'death', 'place', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'anonymous', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'character', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'drink', 'eat', 'be', 'depressed', 'circumstances', 'life', 'control', 'trouble', 'everybody', 'be', 'nice', 'what', 'wrong', 'become', 'friend', 'worship', 'wall', 'film', 'out', 'man', 'who', 'even', 'be', 'saved', 'unwilling', 'unable', 'accept', 'possibility', 'life', 'could', 'have', 'happiness', 'store', 'gruff', 'sad', 'angry', 'exterior', 'go', 'way', 'bit', 'more', ""'d"", 'expect', 'reach', 'out', 'spend', 'time', 'meddlesome', 'Esperanza', 'befriend', 'romance', 'pretty', 'neighbor', 'withdrawn', 'silent', 'shy', 'daughter', 'who', 'habit', 'tape', 'recording', 'Henry', 'conversations', 'playing', 'back', 'later', 'chance', 'hear', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'resonate', 'much', 'should', 'say', 'was', 'clearly', 'simply', 'told', 'acting', 'was', 'solid', 'enough', 'parts', 'written', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'feeling', 'more', 'plausible', 'real', 'initially', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'Films', 'cover', 'range', 'human', 'experience', 'have', 'admire', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'try', 'convey', 'what', 'be', 'true', 'believer', 'just', 'as', 'much', ""'d"", 'admire', 'films', 'aim', 'clarify', 'other', 'unique', 'ways', 'thinking', 'seeing', 'appreciated', 'first', 'fact', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'insist', 'reality', 'miracles', 'merely', 'attempted', 'show', 'possibility', 'interpreting', 'events', 'miracles', 'mindset', 'could', 'make', 'difference', 'got', 'bit', 'more', 'heavy', 'handed', 'message', 'film', 'progressed', 'moving', 'idea', 'events', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'either', 'standpoint', 'faith', 'standpoint', 'disbelief', 'idea', 'nonbelievers', 'are', 'ultimately', 'denying', 'what', 'hearts', 'know', 'be', 'true', 'extent', 'happened', 'was', 'bit', 'turned', 'off', 'music', 'Love', 'Loveless', 'Eels', 'Promises', 'Badly', 'Drawn', 'Boy', 'Roads', 'Lead', 'Home', 'Golden', 'State', 'depending', 'read', 'themes', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'support', 'theme', 'nicely', 'lay', 'thick', 'redemption', 'real', 'possibility', 'believe', 'course', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'part', 'heroes', 'redemption', 'meeting', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'being', 'way', 'living', 'happily', 'ever']",N/A

There couldn't have been a better song to describe the main character of this movie - Henry Poole. He is shown as a lonely and depressed character who has just moved in to a new house in a new neighborhood. He wants to avoid his neighbors although they keep running into each other. In the meantime something miraculous happens (which I won't reveal) that starts changing the lives of the people around him. But Henry won't believe in it, nor is he pleased. To know more about the character Henry and to experience the miracle, you got to watch the movie.It is surprising how good movies like this one don't get any publicity while average/bad movies rule at the box office. Not only does it give you hopes and restore your faith on the good things, it also has a nice spiritual message. It has a happy ending, yet it's not sugar-coated.

1191775,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B001FES0JI,Poor Napoleon,"[1, 1]","At the surface, Henry Poole is Here seems like pic chock full of religious propaganda.  Luke Wilson plays the hopeless title character, moving into the neighborhood where he grew up to live out the remainder of his life and be left alone.  He can't be left alone, however, when a stain appears on his house that looks like Jesus, and neighbors believe it to be a miracle.The filmakers could've taken a very predictable route with this and been very preachy.  But rest assured.  This is no Kirk Cameron relgious propaganda. It's well acted, fairly well written, and doesn't suffer from the over sentimentality that it could in other hands.  The key is Wilson and his character.  Luke Wilson (a better actor than the more successful Wilson brother, plays Poole as very pitiable.  At the same time, his character is very realistic in the sense that he's not easy to convince of a probable miracle outside his door and is clearly focused on his own demise.The film has a message about faith that can easily be digested by both the religious and secular viewers of this film.  It helps that we have a good script and an incredibly talented cast.  My only complaint is that the talented George Lopez has little to do in the time he has on screen (which is sadly, very little).  That tiny problem aside, this film is a pleasant surprise and will hopefully give Luke Wilson some well deserved notice for his acting abilities.",4,You gotta have faith,1234051200,"02 8, 2009",2009,1417,"['surface', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'Here', 'pic', 'chock', 'full', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'hopeless', 'title', 'character', 'moving', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'grew', 'up', 'live', 'out', 'remainder', 'life', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'however', 'when', 'stain', 'house', 'Jesus', 'neighbors', 'believe', 'be', 'miracle.The', 'filmakers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'very', 'predictable', 'route', 'been', 'very', 'preachy', 'rest', 'assured', 'Kirk', 'Cameron', 'relgious', 'propaganda', 'well', 'acted', 'fairly', 'well', 'written', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'over', 'sentimentality', 'could', 'other', 'hands', 'key', 'Wilson', 'character', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'better', 'actor', 'more', 'successful', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'Poole', 'very', 'pitiable', 'same', 'time', 'character', 'very', 'realistic', 'sense', 'not', 'easy', 'convince', 'probable', 'miracle', 'door', 'clearly', 'focused', 'own', 'demise.The', 'film', 'message', 'faith', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'digested', 'religious', 'secular', 'viewers', 'film', 'have', 'good', 'script', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'cast', 'only', 'complaint', 'talented', 'George', 'Lopez', 'little', 'do', 'time', 'screen', 'sadly', 'very', 'little', 'tiny', 'problem', 'aside', 'film', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'will', 'hopefully', 'give', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'well', 'deserved', 'notice', 'acting', 'abilities']",N/A

It is extremely well-crafted and avoids being overly sentimental or saccharine.Poole, played by Luke Wilson, unexpectedly finds he has a rapidly spreading incurable disease.  He chooses to move back to his childhood home, where he had last known happiness, but ends up in another house nearby.  Desperately unhappy, he eschews all neighborly contact and isolates himself.Before he moves into the house, the realtor, trying to do him a favor, has it re-painted and re-stuccoed, leaving an unsightly stain.  It is this stain that becomes the focal point of the picture.  Is it really the face of God or merely water gone awry?  A neighbor calls the church to investigate the phenomenon, especially after the face seems to produce a substance that appears to be blood.While Poole refuses to believe the stain is anything but water, his house becomes a place of pilgrimage.  Others, believing in the face, come to pray and touch the ""miracle"".  What happens to them and Poole is the heart of the story.

He cannot buy his old home because it's occupied, so instead buys a fixer-upper needing paint and stucco.The realtor tells Poole he can get the house fixed up if he pays the full price, but Poole doesn't want that. ""I'm not going to be around very long,"" he tells her.Still, when he moves in, the realtor has gotten the house painted and the outside stucco redone.  It's not a good job.  Poole notes a stain.  Esperanza (Adriana Barraza) his neighbor sees the face of the Christ and believes the stain is a miracle.And, thus the pilgrims begin arriving. First, a young woman from the grocery store gets her sight.  Esperanza keeps sneaking people into the yard when Poole is gone, even tries to certify the home as a holy place with the Catholic Church.Still, Poole himself does not believe. It takes the little mute girl next door, Milly (Morgan Lily) to shake his faith. When she touches the spot, she can speak for the first time since her father left them.But, are all the miracles enough to make Poole believe and give him a chance at a miracle of his own?

Luke Wilson is fine as the lead character and I became a fan of his after the movie ""Idiocracy"", which is a much better film. Ok, so the movie has a positive message and good things happen in the film, still the film was overall slow and uneventful. I thought the little girl who lived next door was simply wonderful. I don't know when I have seen such an adorable little girl. I wish she had a much larger role in the movie. Esperanza, on the other hand, the Spanish neighbor, didn't move me at all. Her message moved me but her character was simply a stereotype. That ""Lopez"" guy as a priest also didn't work so well. With ""Lopez"" all I could do was concentrate on his horrendous and pitted facial complextion and his bad haircut. The lady next door was was characterized pretty well and the lady is fairly attractive.Overall I like the message of having FAITH and MIRACLES can actually happen, even though they might not come from God. I liked when Henry destoyed the image of Christ and only because it was effective and thought and emotion provoking drama. And then the irony that Henry was never ill worked quite well. I liked the message of how the miracle was only suppossed to last as long as it did. I also LOVED the girl who worked at the supermarket. I thought she too seemed quite adorable.I have seen a very similar movie setting in the movie ""187"". In that movie there is one of those large concrete canals behind the house and there is a whole lot of concrete in the yard and in the backyard and the neighborhood seemed very depleted of nature, bleak, and simply full of a lot of concrete.The movie also must have suffered from the low budget. All in all this movie has a very nice message but overall it pretty BORING, even though I liked two of the characters a lot and I thought Luke Wilson acted well enough.And lastly, I have a friend at work who I recently loaned two ""Christian"" movies.

1191781,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001FES0JI,RMurray847,"[1, 2]","HENRY POOLE IS HERE wants to be an uplifting, heart-warming movie.  But its pace is so slow that it succeeds mostly in being pleasant.  Pleasant is a terrible thing, but it doesn't inspire devotion, either.POOLE is an odd little movie with an odd cast.  It's a quirky enough cast to bring a smile to your face when you see it, although some of the ""stars"" are literally only in two scenes each.  Luke Wilson, however, is in every scene, because he plays Henry Poole, a despondent man who buys a house down the street from his childhood home (THAT home is not for sale) and promptly settles into his sparsely furnished place to drink and grow a partial beard and drink and look depressed and drink.Poole has a secret burden he's carrying, one that we're only let in on a fair way into the film, so I won't reveal it here either, although it isn't too hard to guess.  He is withdrawing, deliberately, from mankind, so he's particularly annoyed when his next door neighbor Esperanza shows up at his door with housewarming tamales and an insatiable curiosity about her new neighbor.  Esperanza (Adriana Barazza) is a gossipy but genuinely friendly older woman whose boyfriend Leo tied in the house Henry now occupies.  So she is drawn to the house, and to Henry.  So is little Millie, the young girl who lives on the other side of his house.  She likes to tape-record conversations Henry has in his backyard, and then play them back.  It is slightly creepy behavior, made more acceptable when Henry meets Millie's mother, Dawn (Radha Mitchell) an attractive, age-appropriate divorcee.Things start to get really crazy for Henry when Esperanza decides that the stain on Henry's new stucco job in his backyard is really the image of Christ.  She calls over her local priest and her friends to witness this miracle...much to Henry's privacy-seeking dismay.  Heck, even his grocery store clerk Patience (Rachel Seiferth, in a surprisingly touching and open-hearted performance) knows about it and asks him about it.Henry, not surprisingly, is completely resistant to the idea that his stain could be a miracle.  But his isn't resistant to the quiet charms of his other neighbor, Dawn, and the two embark on a quiet, low-key courtship.  There are no crazy dates or grand romantic gestures or montages of their relationship.  It feels surprisingly convincing...romance has come to these characters at a time when they are both suffering and yet smart enough to resist diving in head-first for fear of making a mistake.The movie wants to be a combination of whimsy and a real drama.  A magical realism for the LA suburbs.  Yet the tone it achieves is one of low-key, slow going character study with a couple of bursts of unexpected zaniness.Luke Wilson, who often these days seems to give lazy performances, does manage to muster up some dramatic depth.  I wouldn't say the character was written for him, but as an actor, he actually does naturally present a persona that has some whimsy mixed with some melancholia.  Radha Mitchell (who I still remember fondly from PITCH BLACK) is quite nice as Dawn, a lovely woman who nonetheless is carrying around quite a weight of sadness.  On the other hand, Barazza is responsible for handling the ""whimsy"" load and her portrayal sometimes lapses into caricature.And what about the ""odd"" casting I mentioned.  Well, the DVD artwork shows Cheryl Hinds & George Lopez quite prominently, yet each is literally only in two scenes apiece.  Hinds, in particular, is utterly wasted as Poole's real estate agent, a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  In addition, Richard Benjamin turns up (in two scenes) as a doctor...and is as nondescript as any movie doctor could possibly be.HENRY POOLE IS HERE is a pleasant enough movie.  It is PG (although there are about 4 or 5 strong curse words thrown out) and certainly wants to be suitable for the whole family.  Its messages about faith, hope & love are all quite worthy and all the characters have strong cores of decency and kindness that is very nice to see.  It doesn't talk down to these simple people.

Henry is embittered by his fate, and is not a man of faith anyway.  However, an image of Jesus on his stucco wall causes miracles to abound among his neighbors.  Eventually, Henry's resistance must succumb to the avalanche of proof of (Catholic) miracles around him.Ah, if life were like that, we wouldn't need this film, would we?  At times, it seems that people of faith and secularists stare at each other, dumbfounded by each others' stubbornness.

1191786,A1K94LXX833JTT,B001FES0JI,Sanpete,"[1, 2]","This fundamentally upbeat film is about choosing love and life over fear, choosing to be present, and  the miracle of the everyday.  It has religious themes, some left open-ended, but it doesn't treat religion in a pious way (there are even a couple swear words used in that connection).  It's gentle and quiet, with much low-key humor and a sometimes-quirky sensibility, complemented with indy-style music.The action centers on a stain on the outer wall of Henry's house that may be a miracle.The acting talent is a big plus, making for appealing characters.  Title character Owen Wilson is suffering and acting strangely for reasons we don't learn right away.  He somewhat believably straddles a line between self-absorbed pessimist and nice guy.  As the movie's tag line says, ""changing his attitude will take a miracle.""  Adriana Barraza is a warm and energetic busybody neighbor allegorically named Esperanza (hope).  Radha Mitchell is the almost-too-beautiful-to-be-true single mother next door, allegorically named Dawn; Morgan Lily is her even more dawn-faced six-year-old girl who is a pivot point of Henry's development.  Rachel Seiferth has a memorable turn as a supermarket checker who ""sees,"" named Patience.  Comedian George Lopez plays it straight as a friendly, reasonable Catholic priest.  And Cheryl Hines gets things off to a good start in a minor but entertaining role.On the less positive side, the film swings from effectively showing the drama, with an off-center point of view, to didactic bursts of expository dialogue, which are less fun, less inspiring, and less interesting.  It also hits a lot of conventional points like clockwork, sometimes in a pedestrian way, as when Henry keeps accidentally hinting at what's behind his strange behavior but stops himself each time.  These aren't fatal flaws, though, at least not for me.I'm not a believer, but the religious aspects don't bother me as they do some others.  The goal was to make ""a spiritual film but not a religious film,"" ""beyond dogma,"" as the director put it.  There are a couple apparent religious miracles presented without any alternative explanations in sight, which is odd when the more central miracles are more ambiguously presented.  There are some obvious gestures towards religious symbolism in regard to blood.  And the allegorical names mentioned above are also there, but the characters are fuller than the names would suggest.The audio commentary by director Mark Pellington (Arlington Road, The Mothman Prophecies) and first-time writer Albert Torres is most useful and interesting if you want to know exactly what they were thinking.  They don't hold back; they're thoughtful and open and make a good pairing.  There's also a well-packed 15-minute making-of piece with good participation by the stars.  The other special features are two music videos and a trailer.  One of the videos is the winner of an open contest for a theme to the movie by a new artist, selected in part by popular online vote.Good for those seeking off-beat inspiration, but not too off-beat, who don't mind some religious themes mixed in.",4,Peculiar cross between quirky independent and square church inspirational,1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,3118,"['fundamentally', 'upbeat', 'film', 'choosing', 'love', 'life', 'fear', 'choosing', 'be', 'present', 'miracle', 'everyday', 'religious', 'themes', 'left', 'open-ended', ""n't"", 'treat', 'religion', 'pious', 'way', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'swear', 'words', 'used', 'connection', 'gentle', 'quiet', 'much', 'low-key', 'humor', 'sometimes-quirky', 'sensibility', 'complemented', 'indy-style', 'music.The', 'action', 'centers', 'stain', 'outer', 'wall', 'Henry', 'house', 'may', 'be', 'miracle.The', 'acting', 'talent', 'big', 'plus', 'making', 'appealing', 'characters', 'Title', 'character', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'suffering', 'acting', 'strangely', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'right', 'away', 'somewhat', 'believably', 'straddles', 'line', 'self-absorbed', 'pessimist', 'nice', 'guy', 'movie', 'tag', 'line', 'changing', 'attitude', 'will', 'take', 'miracle', 'Adriana', 'Barraza', 'warm', 'energetic', 'busybody', 'neighbor', 'allegorically', 'named', 'Esperanza', 'hope', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'almost-too-beautiful-to-be-true', 'single', 'mother', 'next', 'door', 'allegorically', 'named', 'Dawn', 'Morgan', 'Lily', 'even', 'more', 'dawn-faced', 'six-year-old', 'girl', 'who', 'pivot', 'point', 'Henry', 'development', 'Rachel', 'Seiferth', 'memorable', 'turn', 'supermarket', 'checker', 'who', 'sees', 'named', 'Patience', 'Comedian', 'George', 'Lopez', 'straight', 'friendly', 'reasonable', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'things', 'good', 'start', 'minor', 'entertaining', 'role.On', 'less', 'positive', 'side', 'film', 'swings', 'effectively', 'showing', 'drama', 'off-center', 'point', 'view', 'didactic', 'bursts', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'are', 'less', 'fun', 'less', 'inspiring', 'less', 'interesting', 'also', 'lot', 'conventional', 'points', 'clockwork', 'sometimes', 'pedestrian', 'way', 'when', 'Henry', 'accidentally', 'hinting', 'what', 'strange', 'behavior', 'time', 'are', ""n't"", 'fatal', 'flaws', 'though', 'least', 'not', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'believer', 'religious', 'aspects', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'do', 'others', 'goal', 'was', 'make', 'spiritual', 'film', 'not', 'religious', 'film', 'dogma', 'director', 'put', 'are', 'couple', 'apparent', 'religious', 'miracles', 'presented', 'alternative', 'explanations', 'sight', 'odd', 'when', 'more', 'central', 'miracles', 'are', 'more', 'ambiguously', 'presented', 'are', 'obvious', 'gestures', 'towards', 'religious', 'symbolism', 'regard', 'blood', 'allegorical', 'names', 'mentioned', 'are', 'also', 'there', 'characters', 'are', 'fuller', 'names', 'would', 'suggest.The', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'first-time', 'writer', 'Albert', 'Torres', 'most', 'useful', 'interesting', 'want', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'were', 'thinking', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', ""'re"", 'thoughtful', 'open', 'make', 'good', 'pairing', 'also', 'well-packed', '15-minute', 'making-of', 'piece', 'good', 'participation', 'stars', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'trailer', 'One', 'videos', 'winner', 'open', 'contest', 'theme', 'movie', 'new', 'artist', 'selected', 'part', 'popular', 'online', 'vote.Good', 'seeking', 'off-beat', 'inspiration', 'not', 'too', 'off-beat', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'religious', 'themes', 'mixed']",N/A

Whilst I am not a fan of Radha Mitchell, she performs well, and is well chosen as someone with a boundary between her and Henry. George Lopez is brilliant in that he brings the visual baggage of his humour performance, but manages to pull off a wonderfully sustained and restrained Father/Priestfigure.Through-out the development of the man with the mysterious illness( The metaphorical stain on his soul?), who somehow has his stucco house visited by a divine stain on his house( Metaphorical connexion??), and  the definite humour of the absurd situations, the dark comedy somehow sheds light on many situations. I must admit I enjoyed the film, although I was left expecting more especially when the commentary talked about more extra material that is just not there. The Director Mark Pellington is most definitely passionate about this low budget piece that somehow comes off with more power than similar films, thanks to some deft casting, good editing, and clever , hands off performances that sustained a good , droll wit about the entire performance.THE DVD: The Making of Henry Poole has some interest, but not much.

I don't give out 5-star ratings very often, but this film earned it for being funny, touching, and thought-provoking without being a ""chick flick.""Had they given this movie a more clever title, or did some better marketing, it might have gotten the attention it deserved.  Actors/actresses are very believable, and it was easy to ""get into"" the story because they played their parts well. It was thought provoking, echoing the common question many people have; ""Is God real?""There was some language I would deem inappropriate, and for that I would have rated this somewhere between PG and PG-13, like, ""PG-10"" if there were such a thing.This story had a few unexpected twists.  It was interesting and funny, despite its ""low key"" or ""slow"" pace.  The main character's disdain for other people was hilarious at times, and wrought with loneliness and emotion at other times.  It made for a good, interesting mix.  No shoot-em-up action scenes here.  You'll have to go elsewhere for explosions and high-budget chase scenes.  That said, this movie is not too ""girly"" either.

He buys a home in his childhood neighborhood, without any plans to make plans, when a mark appears on the side of his house which neighbors believe is the face of Jesus. Of course Henry is the last person who wants to deal with this sudden hindrance, attempting to ignore it along with his friendly neighbors and household repairs. When miracles begin to happen, Henry still cannot find a way to make himself believe and in return only pushes the world further away.Though indeed, there are christian undertones in this film, which may put-off some, they are not preachy or forced, and I view it more of an experience on finding faith in life and in ones own self, more then just a question of religion.

I was surprised that this film received no advertising for being a Luke Wilson film (no poster placement, strange pricing structures, limited release, etc.).I have been playing it in the store for a couple days now and it truly captivated the crowds. The film contains a nice mix of suburban visuals with an excellent soundtrack that repeatedly catches the attention of those that might only be listening. It has become one of those films that sells itself but in a good way.The story revolves around a man that is obviously extremely depressed that wants to skip human interaction by buying an empty suburban house. Instead he encounters several neighbors that end up changing his life and in the end, helping those that helped him. Regardless of the large volumes of hate one can find about this film out there (and I do mean a lot) I did not categorize this as a religious film, or an agenda film, I just saw a good emotional film filled with believers and non believers, love and incredible events.The BD quality is excellent, and was very appropriate for this film with the amount of landscapes and overhead shots. The music sounded wonderful in the TrueHD (lots of music) and special features were worth the time. The production docu is informative, as was the commentary. The selling point though is the deleted scenes. They removed over 30 minutes from the film. A great deal of the questions I have read about this film (and was asking myself while watching) were answered here. Even after listening as to why the director removed them, I strongly disagreed and felt they should have been in the movie (hence I rated it one star lower). The scenes would have made the film a great deal more believable and would not have been lagging with all of these questions about why this whole event was happening.Some nice performances, a solid BD, and a worthwhile film make the BD price here on Amazon a steal.",4,A sincere film that looked great on BD,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,1985,"['director', 'said', 'best', 'BD', 'docu', 'hopeless', 'man', 'hope', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'received', 'advertising', 'being', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'film', 'poster', 'placement', 'strange', 'pricing', 'structures', 'limited', 'release', 'etc', 'have', 'been', 'playing', 'store', 'couple', 'days', 'now', 'truly', 'captivated', 'crowds', 'film', 'nice', 'mix', 'suburban', 'visuals', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'repeatedly', 'attention', 'might', 'only', 'be', 'listening', 'become', 'one', 'films', 'good', 'way.The', 'story', 'around', 'man', 'obviously', 'extremely', 'depressed', 'skip', 'human', 'interaction', 'buying', 'empty', 'suburban', 'house', 'Instead', 'several', 'neighbors', 'end', 'up', 'changing', 'life', 'end', 'helping', 'helped', 'Regardless', 'large', 'volumes', 'hate', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'there', 'do', 'mean', 'lot', 'did', 'not', 'categorize', 'religious', 'film', 'agenda', 'film', 'just', 'saw', 'good', 'emotional', 'film', 'filled', 'believers', 'non', 'believers', 'love', 'incredible', 'events.The', 'BD', 'quality', 'excellent', 'was', 'very', 'appropriate', 'film', 'amount', 'landscapes', 'overhead', 'shots', 'music', 'sounded', 'wonderful', 'TrueHD', 'lots', 'music', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'time', 'production', 'docu', 'informative', 'was', 'commentary', 'selling', 'point', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'removed', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'questions', 'have', 'read', 'film', 'was', 'asking', 'watching', 'were', 'answered', 'here', 'Even', 'listening', 'why', 'director', 'removed', 'strongly', 'disagreed', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'hence', 'rated', 'one', 'star', 'lower', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'believable', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'lagging', 'questions', 'why', 'whole', 'event', 'was', 'happening.Some', 'nice', 'performances', 'solid', 'BD', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'make', 'BD', 'price', 'here', 'Amazon', 'steal']",N/A

1191795,A359IT81FBX64Y,B001FES0JI,Steven Mason,"[1, 1]","Acheiropoieta is the miraculous creation of an iconic image of Jesus or the Virgin Mary. The more general term is ""pareidolia,"" or the perception of images where none exist (such as seeing objects in clouds or stars). This movie is about an image of Jesus appearing on Henry Poole's stucco house. Any of you who have read Richard Price's ""Lush Life"" might recall that an image of the Virgin Mary appeared on the glass door of a freezer in a convenience store. In that book the image was presented in a cynical fashion. In this movie it is presented seriously and earnestly, though the main character is, for most of the story, a very cynical person. Or, rather, as some of the other characters describe him, sad and angry. Henry has got his reasons for being cynical, sad, and angry, and by and by you find out what they are.I won't go into detail about the plot. I'll cut to the chase and suggest that the kind of people who might enjoy this movie are Christians who believe in miracles. I think this movie was made for such an audience. If you aren't Christian or if you aren't religious, it's likely you won't enjoy this movie. If it weren't so earnest, if it at least had some humor in it, non-Christians and atheists might enjoy it. Don't get me wrong - I'm not putting this movie down. It's just meant for a specific audience.Well, actually I do have a couple of criticisms. First, we learn virtually nothing about Henry's adult life, and so we have nothing to go on to put him in context. The only thing we learn about Henry is that his parents argued a lot and this was painful for the young Henry. In fact, I could say the same thing about all of the characters: We know absolutely nothing about their backgrounds. I don't know if I've ever watched a movie that was as focused on the present moment as this one. Not ""knowing"" the characters made it that much harder for me to connect to this story. Second, if I were in Henry's situation - and I can't say what that situation is without spoiling it for you - I would not act in the way he did. Indeed, he acted in the opposite way that I would, and for me, this made him rather unlikable, unsympathetic, and even harder for me to connect with.",2,Acheiropoieta,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,2202,"['Acheiropoieta', 'miraculous', 'creation', 'iconic', 'image', 'Jesus', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'more', 'general', 'term', 'pareidolia', 'perception', 'images', 'where', 'none', 'exist', 'such', 'seeing', 'objects', 'clouds', 'stars', 'movie', 'image', 'Jesus', 'appearing', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'stucco', 'house', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'Richard', 'Price', 'Lush', 'Life', 'might', 'recall', 'image', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'appeared', 'glass', 'door', 'freezer', 'convenience', 'store', 'book', 'image', 'was', 'presented', 'cynical', 'fashion', 'movie', 'presented', 'seriously', 'earnestly', 'main', 'character', 'most', 'story', 'very', 'cynical', 'person', 'rather', 'other', 'characters', 'describe', 'sad', 'angry', 'Henry', 'got', 'reasons', 'being', 'cynical', 'sad', 'angry', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'are.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'chase', 'suggest', 'kind', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'are', 'Christians', 'who', 'believe', 'miracles', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'audience', 'are', ""n't"", 'Christian', 'are', ""n't"", 'religious', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'earnest', 'least', 'had', 'humor', 'non-Christians', 'atheists', 'might', 'enjoy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'putting', 'movie', 'down', 'just', 'meant', 'specific', 'audience.Well', 'actually', 'do', 'have', 'couple', 'criticisms', 'First', 'learn', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'Henry', 'adult', 'life', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'go', 'put', 'context', 'only', 'thing', 'learn', 'Henry', 'parents', 'argued', 'lot', 'was', 'painful', 'young', 'Henry', 'fact', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'characters', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'backgrounds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'focused', 'present', 'moment', 'one', 'Not', 'knowing', 'characters', 'made', 'much', 'harder', 'connect', 'story', 'Second', 'were', 'Henry', 'situation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', 'situation', 'spoiling', 'would', 'not', 'act', 'way', 'did', 'Indeed', 'acted', 'opposite', 'way', 'would', 'made', 'rather', 'unlikable', 'unsympathetic', 'even', 'harder', 'connect']",N/A

Wilsonky previewed Henry Poole Is Here and left me intrigued about what the film was really going to deliver.The Editorial Review that Amazon has listed from Tom Keogh does a fairly decent job of covering the film, and almost leaves nothing to add, though as you read here, I'm going to try and add a few words that will hopefully convince you to give this very well done film a chance.Henry Poole Is Here is not a special effects laden explosives and pyrotechnics showcase.  It is a well thought out and deliberately (though not dragging or slow) pieced together film.  Luke Wilson delivers a performance that is perfect for his character, and the other actors and actresses offer similarly powerful performances.Humor, anger, sadness, joy, fear, and a range of other emotions come into play for the various characters as they interact with the titular Henry Poole and/or become involved with what could very well be a genuine miracle.The Blu-ray delivers very nice, though not necessarily impressive video.  Given that a lot of the film takes place indoors, or in the back yard of Henry Poole's home, and also given that this film is about people and not about special effects and video that has to be the star of the show, the quality is just fine.  Note, I'm not saying that the quality is lackluster, or unimpressive, more that this isn't the kind of movie that you'd be noticing the scenery in nearly as much as you should be mesmerized by the story and the characters within.The same could be said of the audio quality.  The audio is primarily character dialogue.  Part of the story involves the audio heavily and it's important that viewers don't need to reach for their remote controls to raise or lower the volume in order to hear the dialogue that is taking place.  Thankfully the levels are well balanced so it's easy to hear everything throughout.Henry Poole Is Here is a very, very well done film and deserves to be seen.  It may be a bit too creative and lack the action and thrills that the masses would normally be looking for, but given a chance I think most viewers would come out of the experience pleased.  At a minimum it would be good Unbox material.",4,Delivers with characters and emotions rather than effects,1232755200,"01 24, 2009",2009,2284,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'film', 'HDNet', 'show', 'Ultimate', 'Trailer', 'Show', 'critic', 'Robert', 'Wilonsky', 'Wilsonky', 'previewed', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'Here', 'left', 'intrigued', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'deliver.The', 'Editorial', 'Review', 'Amazon', 'listed', 'Tom', 'Keogh', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'covering', 'film', 'almost', 'nothing', 'add', 'read', 'here', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'add', 'few', 'words', 'will', 'hopefully', 'convince', 'give', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'chance.Henry', 'Poole', 'Is', 'Here', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'laden', 'explosives', 'pyrotechnics', 'showcase', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'deliberately', 'not', 'dragging', 'slow', 'pieced', 'together', 'film', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'performance', 'perfect', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'offer', 'similarly', 'powerful', 'performances.Humor', 'anger', 'sadness', 'joy', 'fear', 'range', 'other', 'emotions', 'come', 'play', 'various', 'characters', 'interact', 'titular', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'become', 'involved', 'what', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'genuine', 'miracle.The', 'Blu-ray', 'delivers', 'very', 'nice', 'not', 'necessarily', 'impressive', 'video', 'Given', 'lot', 'film', 'place', 'indoors', 'back', 'yard', 'Henry', 'Poole', 'home', 'also', 'given', 'film', 'people', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'video', 'be', 'star', 'show', 'quality', 'just', 'fine', 'Note', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'quality', 'lackluster', 'unimpressive', 'more', ""n't"", 'kind', 'movie', ""'d"", 'be', 'noticing', 'scenery', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'mesmerized', 'story', 'characters', 'within.The', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'audio', 'quality', 'audio', 'primarily', 'character', 'dialogue', 'Part', 'story', 'audio', 'heavily', 'important', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'reach', 'remote', 'controls', 'raise', 'lower', 'volume', 'order', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'taking', 'place', 'Thankfully', 'levels', 'are', 'well', 'balanced', 'easy', 'hear', 'everything', 'throughout.Henry', 'Poole', 'Is', 'Here', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'creative', 'lack', 'action', 'thrills', 'masses', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'looking', 'given', 'chance', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'come', 'experience', 'pleased', 'minimum', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Unbox', 'material']",N/A
1191797,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001FES0JI,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","""Henry Poole Is Here"" succeeds largely because of Luke Wilson, who portrays the title character as a guy who just wants to left alone with his booze.  When a water stain appears on the stucco on Henry's house, a rough image of the face of Christ is seen by neighbors, making Henry and his ""shrine"" the focus of enormous attention.  The movie is filled with eccentric characters -- the kind one usually encounters in quirky films like this.  Adriana Barrazza (from ""Babel"") is the busybody neighbor whose observation on Henry's wall initiates Henry's attempt to return to life. Other characters include Patience, a teenage bagger at the local supermarket (Rachel Seiferth), Father Salazar (George Lopez), the pretty next-door mom (Radha Mitchell), and her saucer-eyed daughter Millie (Morgan Lily).  Director Mark Pellington has created a sort of modern fable about a guy who, seeking solitude and isolation, finds himself in the midst of a human circus. The movie also raises interesting questions of faith, though they are not hammered in obvious ways.  ""Henry Poole Is Here"" is not your ordinary film.

When a water stain on his exterior wall reminds a Catholic neighbor (Adriana Barraza) of the face of Christ, she brings in the local Catholic priest (George Lopez) and others to pray at the spot, leading to one or two dubious alleged miracles. Radha Mitchell plays another neighbor with a young daughter who also gets involved with Wilson's character. Despite some offbeat and potentially hokey plot moments, the film is surprisingly poignant, coming across as more meaningful than it probably has a right to be.

1191801,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001FES0JI,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 3]","We have seen quite a few films that serve up certain opinions about Faith, Hope and Redemption. Quite frankly, these type of films have the very dangerous potential to be exceedingly melodramatic, with its themes taken too solemnly. Director Mark Pennington's ""HENRY POOLE IS HERE"" does a lot of things right with Albert Torres' script, as the director goes into neutral territory with its execution and approaches with a serious tone rather than a somber one. It cleverly sidesteps the trappings of other films of this genre.Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) is a depressed man whose life has been shattered beyond his control, moves into a small suburban home located in his childhood neighborhood to isolate himself and to drink himself to death. His self-imposed exile is disturbed when his next door neighbor Esperanza (played by academy award nominee Adriana Barazza, Babel) discovers a mysterious water stain on Henry's stucco wall claiming that it bears the image of God. What makes it more strange is the fact that miraculous things begin to occur. With the help of a beautiful young divorcee, (played by Radha Mitchell, Finding Neverland) and her daughter Millie (Morgan Lily), Henry finds himself gradually drawn back towards life and hope. His decision to live out his days in quiet desperation is going to be much harder than he imagined.The film is a thematic affair, it has strong touches of Faith, Hope and happiness. The script fortunately stays grounded enough for me to make a connection with its characters since its approach feels very sincere but never cynical--not at all sentimental and very clever. Pennington and Torres executes the screenplay with more facts than silly sentimentality. There are also romantic elements and some scenes are quite comedic, but the script manages to stay solid even though certain aspects were a little predictable. The director manages to misdirect our expectations while giving its final act strong credibility. The third act is actually the film's strongest point, as it does prove quite gripping and even a little suspenseful; I was left wondering as to how everything was going to play out.The acting is quite good. I thought Luke Wilson did an excellent portrayal. If you look into his eyes, you can't help but see his character's sadness and hopelessness. Quite a change since I'm so used to seeing him in comedies such as ""Old School"". I guess it is true when they say that a comedian can easily pull off a dramatic role, since it is harder to make people laugh than to shed a tear--Wilson displays raw versatility. Radha Mitchell is definitely one hot single mother and she definitely has magnetic appeal. Furthermore, her daughter played by Morgan Lily is so cute and charming that you can't help but like her character and generate genuine sympathy. George Lopez is a little underused as the kindly father Salazar, but his character proved an interesting plot device to get everything moving. Adrianna Barazza almost steals the show, this actress can charm, convince and just full of that nosy, but sweet and warm charisma.The direction by Pennington is quite impressive and perfectly complements the script. The way the director composed his shots were very distinct with its visual flair. Sure the film's shots is kept simple, however, Pennington wisely utilizes close ups, and shadows to portray the film's many emotions and mood. The filmmakers' best success is the fact that they managed to keep the film very real, and avoids the potential trappings with the silliness of its main premise--a stain on a wall is rather difficult to build a story around. It involves a lot of commitment and careful open-mindedness to fulfill all its possibilities with the proper approach.Still the film does have its flaws, some scenes were a little trite, and there are some limited plot distractions as well some faux pas in style, but the film proved quite compelling and daring enough to hold my attention. The film portrays its story on faith and miracles with a very non-cynical approach, avoids satirical trappings and religious polemic that results in a film truly motivating and thoughtful with its warm sincerity. The film is worth watching for those on the trodden path.Highly Recommended! [4+ Stars]Video/Audio: 2.40 ratio anamorphic widescreen and 1.33 Full Frame. I went for the widescreen version, that displays a crisp attractive picture. There are some compression artifacts but not really distracting. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is very nice and has quite a lot of bass that definitely enhances this dialogue heavy film.Extras: Commentaries by Torres and Pennington/ Making of feature/ music videos
