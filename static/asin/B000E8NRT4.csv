The interview segments are really good and they cover just about everything you would want to know except maybe why they changed drummers in 2001/2002.  They cover everything from joining Atlantic records on the verge of Epitaph's exploding success with The Offspring in the early 90's to why guitarist co-founder Brett Guirweitz(sp) left the band in the mid-90's and rejoined for 'The Process of Belief' CD.  You even get to see their parents get interviewed...to me, that's so unhip it's COOL.  Be different, and they always have been with thier lyrics in particular.  The live show is great, although I was let down slightly that they totally ignored some great albums.  They played nothing from 'The New America' or 'No Substance' and played a lot of old stuff I was not familiar with(I started listening to the band with '93's Recipe for Hate CD onwards).  I would've really liked them to play the incredibly melodic 'Portrait of Authority', 'Marked', 'Shades of Truth' and 'A Whisper in Time'... too poppy I guess which Greg Graffin hints out in the interviews.  There are some funny moments too when Greg changes microphones while on stage and Chad is doing a drumroll for 'dramatic' effect and then he says 'eat your heart out Metallica'... The biggest surprise of the entire DVD is seeing Greg Graffin sitting at a piano and doing a solo rendition of The Gray Race's ""Cease""... very impressive.  Other highlights are ""10 in 2010"", ""American Jesus"", ""Infected"", ""Sinister Rouge"" and the sligtly poppy ""Sorrow"".  A must buy for any BR fan.  I always wondered, however, how the smartest dude in punk rock(Graffin) continues to write incredible lyrics when his brain can do so much more(like his recent thesis on evolution).  The best punk band EVER.  Period.  If you listen to Sum 41, Good Charlotte and the like, you really need to listen to a REAL punk rock band.  'nuff said.  Buy it.  Steal it.  Burn it.  Borrow it.  Just get the thing.",5,When the hills of Los Angeles are Rocking...,1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,2217,"['instead', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Burning', 'rocking', 'DVD', 'point', 'cheap', 'seats', 'dramatically', 'Greg', 'Graffin', 'Having', 'virutally', 'never', 'read', 'seen', 'interviews', 'members', 'Bad', 'Religion', '13', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'listening', 'had', 'get', 'interview', 'segments', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'cover', 'just', 'everything', 'would', 'want', 'know', 'maybe', 'why', 'changed', 'drummers', '2001/2002', 'cover', 'everything', 'joining', 'Atlantic', 'records', 'verge', 'Epitaph', 'exploding', 'success', 'Offspring', 'early', '90', 'why', 'guitarist', 'co-founder', 'Brett', 'Guirweitz', 'sp', 'left', 'band', 'mid-90', 'rejoined', ""'The"", 'Process', 'Belief', 'CD', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'parents', 'get', 'interviewed', 'so', 'unhip', 'COOL', 'Be', 'different', 'always', 'have', 'been', 'thier', 'lyrics', 'particular', 'live', 'show', 'great', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'slightly', 'totally', 'ignored', 'great', 'albums', 'played', 'nothing', ""'The"", 'New', 'America', ""'No"", 'Substance', 'played', 'lot', 'old', 'stuff', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'started', 'listening', 'band', ""'93"", 'Recipe', 'Hate', 'CD', 'onwards', 'would', ""'ve"", 'really', 'liked', 'play', 'incredibly', 'melodic', ""'Portrait"", 'Authority', ""'Marked"", ""'Shades"", 'Truth', 'Whisper', 'Time', 'too', 'poppy', 'guess', 'Greg', 'Graffin', 'out', 'interviews', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'too', 'when', 'Greg', 'changes', 'microphones', 'stage', 'Chad', 'doing', 'drumroll', ""'dramatic"", 'effect', 'then', ""'eat"", 'heart', 'Metallica', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'entire', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'Greg', 'Graffin', 'sitting', 'piano', 'doing', 'solo', 'rendition', 'Gray', 'Race', 'Cease', 'very', 'impressive', 'Other', 'highlights', 'are', '10', '2010', 'American', 'Jesus', 'Infected', 'Sinister', 'Rouge', 'sligtly', 'poppy', 'Sorrow', 'must', 'buy', 'BR', 'fan', 'always', 'wondered', 'however', 'how', 'smartest', 'dude', 'punk', 'rock', 'Graffin', 'write', 'incredible', 'lyrics', 'when', 'brain', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'recent', 'thesis', 'evolution', 'best', 'punk', 'band', 'EVER', 'Period', 'listen', 'Sum', '41', 'Good', 'Charlotte', 'like', 'really', 'need', 'listen', 'REAL', 'punk', 'rock', 'band', ""'nuff"", 'said', 'Buy', 'Steal', 'Burn', 'Borrow', 'Just', 'get', 'thing']",N/A
970521,A3FX4ENXBQV54R,B000E8NRT4,"Dennis Stephens ""seberg99""","[0, 0]","This is a great DVD. I am surprised that no one seems to have mentioned the MAJOR continuity errors on the video. If you watch closely, you will see Brett seems to wear glasses for parts of the songs, then suddenly doesn't, all within the framework of the same song. It is obvious that they are putting in cuts from both performances. Once you concentrate on watching Brett, you become aware of many other cuts where guitars don't match up to video, Graffin's vocals are a bit off, etc. This is a common but annoying practice that really distracts me. I would have much preferred that they use the whole performance of the song rather than worry about getting the best shot. Longer and more sustained shots would be better as well. Maybe I'm just old, but I have an attention span of more than 3-5 seconds.This minor griping aside, the music on this is fantastic. I had not really warmed up to the new cd THE EMPIRE STRIKES FIRST until I heard the songs live and went back and revisited it. It's a great cross section of their entire career. Yeah, there are songs that I would have liked to see in there, but with every live performance you can't please anyone. The selections at the end of the performance, ""Do What You Want"" and ""We're Only Gonna Die"" are blistering.The personalities in the band come across well, and I love watching Brian Baker and Brett Hetson, as both are manic at times and very good players. The energy of the performances is pretty intense, and these guys deliver.",5,I Didn't Know You Could Put Glasses On And Off So Fast!,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,1490,"['great', 'DVD', 'am', 'surprised', 'one', 'have', 'mentioned', 'MAJOR', 'continuity', 'errors', 'video', 'watch', 'closely', 'will', 'see', 'Brett', 'wear', 'glasses', 'parts', 'songs', 'then', 'suddenly', ""n't"", 'framework', 'same', 'song', 'obvious', 'are', 'putting', 'cuts', 'performances', 'Once', 'concentrate', 'watching', 'Brett', 'become', 'aware', 'many', 'other', 'cuts', 'where', 'guitars', 'do', ""n't"", 'match', 'up', 'video', 'Graffin', 'vocals', 'are', 'bit', 'off', 'etc', 'common', 'annoying', 'practice', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'use', 'whole', 'performance', 'song', 'rather', 'worry', 'getting', 'best', 'shot', 'Longer', 'more', 'sustained', 'shots', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'old', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'more', '3-5', 'seconds.This', 'minor', 'griping', 'aside', 'music', 'fantastic', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'warmed', 'up', 'new', 'cd', 'THE', 'EMPIRE', 'STRIKES', 'FIRST', 'heard', 'songs', 'live', 'went', 'back', 'revisited', 'great', 'cross', 'section', 'entire', 'career', 'Yeah', 'are', 'songs', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'there', 'live', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'please', 'anyone', 'selections', 'end', 'performance', 'Do', 'What', 'Want', ""'re"", 'Only', 'Gon', 'Die', 'are', 'blistering.The', 'personalities', 'band', 'come', 'across', 'well', 'love', 'watching', 'Brian', 'Baker', 'Brett', 'Hetson', 'are', 'manic', 'times', 'very', 'good', 'players', 'energy', 'performances', 'pretty', 'intense', 'guys', 'deliver']",N/A

(small gripe: since they shot with so many camera angles, it would have been nice to include viewer changable camera angles on the dvd.) the sound is really good (i'd say an 8/10). at times the mix is fairly 'eh'... generally in the guitar department.the interviews and band history is pretty interesting but i feel like they could have done more. they either gloss over things quickly or don't talk about them at all (the loss of their drummers, brett returning to the band). also, there's just something about graffin that really rubbed me the wrong way... maybe it's toward the end when he's talking about being so distanced from punk rock today or how he can't really relate to the fans.the song selection is ok, but tends to stear towards the newer stuff. i understand this was shot during the tour for 'the empire strikes first', but considering this is the band's first ever north american dvd, you'd have thought they would have dug a little deeper in to their catalog. oh well.the bonuses are pretty good, though a bunch of videos are missing which is kind of a bummer. the old live footage is really cool and surprisingly good quality.this dvd is a best bet for any bad religion fan.",4,live in your living room,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,1378,"['lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'dissapointed', 'well.the', 'concert', 'footage', 'beautiful', 'very', 'clear', 'expense', 'was', 'spared', 'shooting', 'thing', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'small', 'gripe', 'shot', 'so', 'many', 'camera', 'angles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'include', 'viewer', 'changable', 'camera', 'angles', 'dvd', 'sound', 'really', 'good', 'i', ""'d"", 'say', '8/10', 'times', 'mix', 'fairly', ""'eh"", 'generally', 'guitar', 'department.the', 'interviews', 'band', 'history', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'i', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'gloss', 'things', 'quickly', 'do', ""n't"", 'talk', 'loss', 'drummers', 'brett', 'returning', 'band', 'also', 'just', 'something', 'graffin', 'really', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'end', 'when', 'talking', 'being', 'so', 'distanced', 'punk', 'rock', 'today', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate', 'fans.the', 'song', 'selection', 'ok', 'stear', 'newer', 'stuff', 'i', 'understand', 'was', 'shot', 'tour', ""'the"", 'empire', 'strikes', 'first', 'considering', 'band', 'first', 'ever', 'north', 'american', 'dvd', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'dug', 'little', 'deeper', 'catalog', 'oh', 'well.the', 'bonuses', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'bunch', 'videos', 'are', 'missing', 'kind', 'bummer', 'old', 'live', 'footage', 'really', 'cool', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'quality.this', 'dvd', 'best', 'bet', 'bad', 'religion', 'fan']",N/A

Like your labelmate's Dropkick Murphys did with Live At St. Patrick's (CD) and On The Road With Dropklck Murphys (DVD). Some of the songs here, were better than studio versions, in particularly Stranger Than Fiction and Along The Way. I liked Rise Against's singer's guest appearance as well. He didn't butcher the verse. Now, personally, I have a big hatred for barriers at punk shows, and thousands of bodyguards stopping kids from dancing/moshing, whatever. But that certainly doesn't affect the quality of the music, or the production. This is, without a doubt, the best DVD in my rather small, humble collection. Better than my DK DVD's, Sex Pistols, Dropkick Murphys, The Clash, my other BR DVD. None of them come close to this. A must have for any Bad Religion fan. And, once again I'd like to reiterate my point, release this as an audio disc Bad Religion. Seriously.
