Hoosiers was a wonderful movie that inspired me.Hoosiers is about a small town basketball high school team in Indiana. This basketball team just hired a new coach, and his name is Norman Dale. Dale had a troubled past, and his fiery temper was one factor that got him in serious trouble. He had punched a player of his. That was a long time ago, though, more than 10 years before he decided to take on this new job. He didn't coach basketball for many years, and he was doubted by the local community in the small Indiana town where he would coach.The coach quickly establishes himself as the boss of team, and his dogmatic attitude demands respect. He coaches his players hard, and he says &quot;I don't make my practices for your enjoyment.&quot; He dismisses a rude player during the first practice (who was talking while he was) and tells the old coach that he's out. The old coach tells him that he hopes that Dale fails as a coach. In the first game of the season there are only 6 boys on the team. This first game provides a very memorable moment. One of the players doesn't listen to the coach and wants to shoot before passing. So the coach takes him out. Then another player gets injured, and the player who was out just walks back in. The coach tells him, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; The player is forced to sit back down, and the coach plays with only 4 guys on the court.This movie is an inspirational classic. When one former basketball sharp shooter doesn't want to play because his old coach died, Dale says he won't pursue him. This basketball player is the best one, and rarely misses his shots. He decides to come back though at a pivotal moment in the movie, when Dale's career is in jeopardy. After that, the team takes off. The rest of the movie show's how one team's heart and determination brought out the best of them. Hoosiers about an unlikely victory by a tiny school with an enrollment of less than 100 over a large high school with over 1500 students. It's an amazing story, and this sports movie is the greatest one I've ever. Hoosiers is a must-see classic for all basketball fans.",5,"Hoosiers is spectacular, motivational, and exciting",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,2213,"['hearing', 'reading', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'decided', 'had', 'watch', 'Hoosiers', 'was', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'inspired', 'me.Hoosiers', 'small', 'town', 'basketball', 'high', 'school', 'team', 'Indiana', 'basketball', 'team', 'just', 'hired', 'new', 'coach', 'name', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'Dale', 'had', 'troubled', 'past', 'fiery', 'temper', 'was', 'one', 'factor', 'got', 'serious', 'trouble', 'had', 'punched', 'player', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'though', 'more', '10', 'years', 'decided', 'take', 'new', 'job', 'did', ""n't"", 'coach', 'basketball', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'doubted', 'local', 'community', 'small', 'Indiana', 'town', 'where', 'would', 'coach.The', 'coach', 'quickly', 'boss', 'team', 'dogmatic', 'attitude', 'demands', 'respect', 'players', 'hard', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'practices', 'enjoyment.', 'quot', 'rude', 'player', 'first', 'practice', 'who', 'was', 'talking', 'was', 'old', 'coach', 'out', 'old', 'coach', 'Dale', 'coach', 'first', 'game', 'season', 'are', 'only', '6', 'boys', 'team', 'first', 'game', 'very', 'memorable', 'moment', 'One', 'players', ""n't"", 'listen', 'coach', 'shoot', 'passing', 'coach', 'out', 'Then', 'player', 'injured', 'player', 'who', 'was', 'out', 'just', 'walks', 'back', 'coach', 'quot', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'quot', 'player', 'forced', 'sit', 'back', 'down', 'coach', 'only', '4', 'guys', 'court.This', 'movie', 'inspirational', 'classic', 'When', 'one', 'former', 'basketball', 'sharp', 'shooter', ""n't"", 'want', 'play', 'old', 'coach', 'died', 'Dale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pursue', 'basketball', 'player', 'best', 'one', 'rarely', 'shots', 'come', 'back', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'movie', 'when', 'Dale', 'career', 'jeopardy', 'team', 'off', 'rest', 'movie', 'show', 'how', 'one', 'team', 'heart', 'determination', 'brought', 'out', 'best', 'Hoosiers', 'unlikely', 'victory', 'tiny', 'school', 'enrollment', 'less', '100', 'large', 'high', 'school', '1500', 'students', 'amazing', 'story', 'sports', 'movie', 'greatest', 'one', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'Hoosiers', 'must-see', 'classic', 'basketball', 'fans']",N/A

Hoosiers characters are a collection of beaten down and worn out souls who have been dealt a lifetime of seemingly hopelessness and mediocrity. Individually they will remain destined to this fate for eternity. As a group they can rise beyond all hope and make a statement from which their lives will become enriched from what they are able to accomplish given that initial spark and making the commitment to give it their all.  Composer Jerry Goldsmith must have seen greatness at the core of this film because he gave us one of the most inspiring scores ever composed for a film.

149548,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792843592,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","I often lament about the fact that sports movies in general are repetitive and clich&eacute;d and that there are rarely any truly inspirational and or original attempts at the genre.  In fact, aside from `Friday Night Lights' I have yet to be truly impressed with a sports movie really.  That was all until I saw `Hoosiers' last night, a film that I had avoided because of the whole `sports movie' stigmata and just really felt it was going to be yet another sappy true story with all the same dynamics as every other sappy true story.I was wrong.Yes, `Hoosiers' follows a familiar formula when it comes to telling the story of the Hickory Huskers, and Indiana high school basketball team that rises to greatness under the wing of their new coach Norman Dale.  What sets the film apart though are the wonderfully fleshed out characters that add weight and depth to the film.  It flows the same as most sports films do, but this film has heart whereas most sports movies do not.  The brilliant performances also aid in this regard, adding layers of emotional attachment to the people involved and causing the audience to invest themselves fully into the film.Norman Dale is an ex-college basketball coach who has spent that last ten years in the navy after being fired for punching a player in the face.  This single mistake has plagued Dale for years and it still hangs over his head as he attempts to move forward and coach this high school team.  The problem is that the town of Hickory is a very emotionally invested town, each and every individual taking a special interest in the basketball team, and so the insertion of new blood sends the town in a frenzy.  They immediately attack Dale for his unconventional coaching techniques, and when the team doesn't perform too well on the court the town tries to get Dale fired.  Still, Dale presses forward, trying his best to move his team in the right direction, and he soon begins to make friends out of a few influential townsfolk, most importantly Jimmy, the towns basketball star who refused to play after his previous coach died.The film, like almost every other sports themed drama, makes a point to be an inspirational and moving film about overcoming obstacles to attain greatness, and in that respect it works much grander than most other films thanks to the wonderful performances by the cast.  Gene Hackman (one of our greatest working actors) is a joy as Norman Dale, giving his character so much warmth and undeniable charm.  He is the outcast, he is the rebel but he is so comfortable and charismatic that you want to rally beside him every step of the way.  Barbara Hershey is also wonderful as Myra Fleener, the young teacher who is initially turned off by Dale but soon falls for him.  She does a beautiful job of fleshing out her characters real drive and motivations.The real star here is Dennis Hopper, who thankfully earned an Oscar nomination for his performance.  He really sinks deep into his character, giving him such a believable arch.  As Shooter, the town drunk, Hopper plays on our sympathies, but never leaves us without reason to sympathize.  He isn't lazy with his portrayal but really works at building layers around this man.So, if you are a sports fan, or a fan of sports films, then no doubt you've already seen this film.  If you are not a fan of either (like myself) then I urge you to consider this one, because it is far from your average clich&eacute;.  This movie really has heart and soul, and it really raises the bar for all other sports related dramas to try and reach.",5,The king of all sports movies...,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,3568,"['often', 'lament', 'fact', 'sports', 'movies', 'general', 'are', 'repetitive', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'are', 'rarely', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'original', 'attempts', 'genre', 'fact', 'aside', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'truly', 'impressed', 'sports', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'saw', 'Hoosiers', 'last', 'night', 'film', 'had', 'avoided', 'whole', 'sports', 'movie', 'stigmata', 'just', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'yet', 'sappy', 'true', 'story', 'same', 'dynamics', 'other', 'sappy', 'true', 'story.I', 'was', 'wrong.Yes', 'Hoosiers', 'familiar', 'formula', 'when', 'telling', 'story', 'Hickory', 'Huskers', 'Indiana', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'greatness', 'wing', 'new', 'coach', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'What', 'film', 'apart', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'characters', 'add', 'weight', 'depth', 'film', 'same', 'most', 'sports', 'films', 'do', 'film', 'heart', 'most', 'sports', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'also', 'aid', 'regard', 'adding', 'layers', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'people', 'involved', 'causing', 'audience', 'invest', 'fully', 'film.Norman', 'Dale', 'ex-college', 'basketball', 'coach', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'navy', 'being', 'fired', 'punching', 'player', 'face', 'single', 'mistake', 'plagued', 'Dale', 'years', 'still', 'head', 'move', 'forward', 'coach', 'high', 'school', 'team', 'problem', 'town', 'Hickory', 'very', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'town', 'individual', 'taking', 'special', 'interest', 'basketball', 'team', 'so', 'insertion', 'new', 'blood', 'town', 'frenzy', 'immediately', 'attack', 'Dale', 'unconventional', 'coaching', 'techniques', 'when', 'team', ""n't"", 'perform', 'too', 'well', 'court', 'town', 'tries', 'get', 'Dale', 'fired', 'Still', 'Dale', 'forward', 'trying', 'best', 'move', 'team', 'right', 'direction', 'soon', 'make', 'friends', 'few', 'influential', 'townsfolk', 'most', 'importantly', 'Jimmy', 'towns', 'basketball', 'star', 'who', 'refused', 'play', 'previous', 'coach', 'died.The', 'film', 'almost', 'other', 'sports', 'themed', 'drama', 'point', 'be', 'inspirational', 'moving', 'film', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'attain', 'greatness', 'respect', 'much', 'grander', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'thanks', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'cast', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'one', 'greatest', 'working', 'actors', 'joy', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'giving', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'warmth', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'outcast', 'rebel', 'so', 'comfortable', 'charismatic', 'want', 'rally', 'beside', 'step', 'way', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Myra', 'Fleener', 'young', 'teacher', 'who', 'initially', 'turned', 'off', 'Dale', 'soon', 'falls', 'beautiful', 'job', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'real', 'drive', 'motivations.The', 'real', 'star', 'here', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'thankfully', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'really', 'deep', 'character', 'giving', 'such', 'believable', 'arch', 'Shooter', 'town', 'drunk', 'Hopper', 'sympathies', 'never', 'reason', 'sympathize', ""n't"", 'lazy', 'portrayal', 'really', 'building', 'layers', 'man.So', 'are', 'sports', 'fan', 'fan', 'sports', 'films', 'then', 'doubt', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'then', 'urge', 'consider', 'one', 'far', 'average', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie', 'really', 'heart', 'soul', 'really', 'bar', 'other', 'sports', 'related', 'dramas', 'try', 'reach']",N/A

The casting is perfect and the direction flawless.""Hoosiers"" is set in a town in Indiana which is famous for its love of basketball.  Gene Hackman plays coach Norman Dale who comes to Hickory, Indiana to get a struggling high school team back on its feet. He is met with anger and suspicion on the part of the townspeople and apathy and suspicion on that part of the players.What ensues is a lesson in character and fortitude that extends its reach far beyond the game of basketball.  Dennis Hopper plays the father of one of the team members who has seen far better days.  As a bitter, unrepentent alcoholic, he proceeds to make things harder for his son and the team. Barbara Hershey plays a sarcastic high school principal who resents not only the new coach, but the sport and the town.  But as the movie progresses, we see a metamorphosis on the part of all as lives begin changing around the game of basketball.You can look at this movie as being about basketball.  And it obviously is.  However, it transcends that and, to me, is a story of redemption, and triumph.  In fact, it might take two viewings to really get the subtle nuances this movie delivers.Set against the backdrop of Indiana scenery, and filmed beautifully, you will find yourself getting caught up in the magic of this story.

149552,A30TQET02FLSUX,0792843592,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[2, 2]","Every now and then, a small 'David vs. Goliath' film touches the hearts and souls of an entire generation of people. Hoosiers (1986) was that film for me and the rest of my Gen-X brethren. I remember going to a packed movie theater in the Fall of 1986, when I was 13 years old, and falling completely in love with Gene Hackman, Dennis Hopper and Barbara Hershey as actors. Coach Norman Dale, as played by Hackman, left me feeling completely inspired to conquer my own sport of swimming with my newly found belief that 'anything' was possible if I could dream it up and work hard enough for it. Hoosiers is a feel good family film that always delivers emotionally...and I never tire of watching it again and feeling those same emotions I felt as a 13-year old boy. My 14-year old cousin Drew wanted to review the film, and it was so great to see that nearly 25 years later, the film is still finding its audience.When Hoosiers came out, I had seen Gene Hackman in Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), but he played a wacky and comedic villain in those movies. It was Hoosiers that sparked Hackman's dramatic acting career back into mainstream Hollywood as well as into my psyche as a serious actor. Same with Dennis Hopper.  I've followed all of Hackman's movies ever since Hoosiers and he remains to this day one of my favorite actors. He stars in no less than seven of my Top 100 movies of all time, including: Hoosiers (1986), Mississippi Burning (1998), Class Action (1991), Unforgiven (1992), The Firm (1993), Crimson Tide (1995), and Enemy of the State (1998). I'm not sure if any other actor can match that! If I had to pick a single movie to represent Hackman as an actor, it would have to be Hoosiers. His role as Coach Norman Dale has an enormous range of emotions and detailed character traits, from subtle to violent. And I think that's what grabbed me the most in Hoosiers, because you fall in love with Coach Dale regardless of which emotion he is expressing. You love him for the flawed man that he is, much like Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Coach Dale cares deeply about the sport of basketball, his team, the players, his family, his friends, and all of the people he comes across in his life. And Gene Hackman brings Coach Dale to life like no one else could.For those who would argue that Rudy (1993) is the best sports movie of all time, you're in luck, because director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo crafted both of these inspiring sports films. Hoosiers is about basketball, the importance of working as a team, and redemption, i.e. second chances like Coach Dale receives. Rudy is about football and the importance of the individual drive to succeed at something through hard work and perseverance.  Both movies are at the top of the sports movie genre. But I think Hoosiers is where Anspaugh and Pizzo originated their magic touch for inspiration through sport and where they present the best movie package. Hoosiers is a  Top 25 movie for me (4.5 stars out of 5) and Rudy is Top 100 (4 stars out of 5). Hoosiers is definitely an 80s indie film. You can see that the production budget was meager, but Anspaugh does a lot with very little to craft a classic film. He makes the entire film feel exactly like rural Indiana in 1951, the time period in which the movie takes place. Having grown up in the Midwest (Madison, Wisconsin), I understand the importance of sports in high school there. And I understand the mindset of the people. So many of the supporting characters in Hoosiers remind me of family members and make me think of the way they must have lived during that era.Coach Norman Dale is brought in as the new high school basketball coach for the tiny fictional town of Hickory, Indiana where basketball is EVERYTHING for the town and its people. He butts heads with many of the local townspeople as he builds his cinderella team from raw unrefined local talent. Along the way, Coach Dale wins over one person at a time, starting with one of the most highly regarded school teachers, played by Barbara Hershey, who is also his love interest. She eventually sees that while Coach Dale has a tough prickly exterior, he really does care about his players, the team, the school, and the town. He simply knows what needs to be done to win...and he has to break the players and towns people's old mindsets and habits to make it happen.Hoosiers is a movie that athletes and teams all over the world watch before they go into 'battle' to inspire them to believe that they too can win over odds stacked against them. It's a movie that dreams big and makes you dream big, even though its packaged in a very humble way. The film deserves a restoration and remastering for what I assume will be a 25th Anniversary Bluray and DVD release next year (2011). I've got the 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD as well as the original DVD. Both look fine and sound fine on TV when you watch them and escape into the story.

149559,A3JPFWKS83R49V,0792843592,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[1, 1]","Based on a true high school basketball Cinderella story that occurred in 1954 in Indiana, Hoosiers is a must- see film about a team of young men who are forced to adjust to a brand- new coach (played by Gene Hackman) who has been hired to lead the team following his own banishment from college basketball for physically hitting one of his players. The movie, set in rural Indiana in the early 1950's, starts out simply enough, with scenes of open fields and of Hackman driving into the small town and heading to the high school to meet with the principle and find out more about his new job.The plot of this film takes a few twists, but remains focused mostly on basketball. Hackman angers the basketball- crazy citizens of the town when he pulls some unusual coaching moves and loses the first two games of the season. He also raises some eyebrows when he hires the town drunk (played impeccably by Dennis Hopper, who received an Oscar nomination for his effort) as his assistant coach. Hackman makes this move to help Hopper gain confidence and get a new lease on life, but the locals think Hackman is too unorthodox for their tastes and they hold a town meeting to decide on whether or not to fire him from the job. Hackman survives and ultimately takes his team to the state finals and the championship game.Hoosiers features some great music and a heartwarming story line that will keep viewers rooting for the underdog team, Hackman's Hickory Hucksters, all the way to the end of the film. The movie works on just about every level, with great drama and chemistry between the characters. And the scenes on the basketball court keep the action moving at a fast pace, with an excellent score (Hoosiers was nominated for the Oscar for best music) that keeps you in suspense, even though you already know the outcome of the movie.The only thing I didn't care for in this movie was the love interest that develops between Hackman and one of the other co- stars, Barbara Hershey. It really doesn't have anything to do with the plot of the movie. I think the director included this to show some character development on the part of Hershey- a woman who is very skeptical and even a little insulting toward Hackman when he arrives at the school at the start of the movie. But the main theme of the film is basketball, and I think it would have been best if this ""love"" scene had been eliminated.As far as sports movies go, Hoosiers ranks among my favorites of all- time. I have viewed this movie dozens of times and it still never fails to satisfy. It's an excellent representation of the American dream: Hackman getting a new start in life and success following his ban from college coaching; Hopper getting a second chance in life to beat his problem with alcoholism; and the underdog Hickory Hucksters basketball team getting the chance of a lifetime to beat a much larger school. Hoosiers is one of those rare treats in modern cinema that works at most every level and holds your interest throughout, even when you know very well what is going to happen. It's great sports entertainment, and a must- see motion picture for fans of the game of basketball.",5,Great Sports Entertainment!,1080518400,"03 29, 2004",2004,3157,"['Based', 'true', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'occurred', '1954', 'Indiana', 'Hoosiers', 'must-', 'see', 'film', 'team', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'forced', 'adjust', 'brand-', 'new', 'coach', 'played', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'lead', 'team', 'following', 'own', 'banishment', 'college', 'basketball', 'physically', 'hitting', 'one', 'players', 'movie', 'set', 'rural', 'Indiana', 'early', '1950', 'out', 'simply', 'enough', 'scenes', 'open', 'fields', 'Hackman', 'driving', 'small', 'town', 'heading', 'high', 'school', 'meet', 'principle', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'new', 'job.The', 'plot', 'film', 'few', 'twists', 'focused', 'mostly', 'basketball', 'Hackman', 'basketball-', 'crazy', 'citizens', 'town', 'when', 'unusual', 'coaching', 'moves', 'first', 'two', 'games', 'season', 'also', 'eyebrows', 'when', 'town', 'drunk', 'played', 'impeccably', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'effort', 'assistant', 'coach', 'Hackman', 'move', 'help', 'Hopper', 'gain', 'confidence', 'get', 'new', 'lease', 'life', 'locals', 'think', 'Hackman', 'too', 'unorthodox', 'tastes', 'hold', 'town', 'meeting', 'decide', 'not', 'fire', 'job', 'Hackman', 'ultimately', 'team', 'state', 'finals', 'championship', 'game.Hoosiers', 'great', 'music', 'heartwarming', 'story', 'line', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'rooting', 'underdog', 'team', 'Hackman', 'Hickory', 'Hucksters', 'way', 'end', 'film', 'movie', 'just', 'level', 'great', 'drama', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'scenes', 'basketball', 'court', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'fast', 'pace', 'excellent', 'score', 'Hoosiers', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'best', 'music', 'suspense', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'movie.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'was', 'love', 'interest', 'Hackman', 'one', 'other', 'co-', 'stars', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'plot', 'movie', 'think', 'director', 'included', 'show', 'character', 'development', 'part', 'Hershey-', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'skeptical', 'even', 'little', 'insulting', 'Hackman', 'when', 'school', 'start', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'film', 'basketball', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'love', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'eliminated.As', 'far', 'sports', 'movies', 'go', 'Hoosiers', 'favorites', 'all-', 'time', 'have', 'viewed', 'movie', 'times', 'still', 'never', 'satisfy', 'excellent', 'representation', 'American', 'dream', 'Hackman', 'getting', 'new', 'start', 'life', 'success', 'following', 'ban', 'college', 'coaching', 'Hopper', 'getting', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'beat', 'problem', 'alcoholism', 'underdog', 'Hickory', 'Hucksters', 'basketball', 'team', 'getting', 'chance', 'lifetime', 'beat', 'much', 'larger', 'school', 'Hoosiers', 'one', 'rare', 'treats', 'modern', 'cinema', 'most', 'level', 'interest', 'even', 'when', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'great', 'sports', 'entertainment', 'must-', 'see', 'motion', 'picture', 'fans', 'game', 'basketball']",N/A

Gene Hackman is the new high school basketball coach in basketball crazy Hickory, Indiana in 1951. He is a man with a past, although it is not as dark as it initially appears. Hopper plays Shooter, the town drunk whose son is on the seven man team. Despite his sodden brain, Shooter has a superb understanding of the game and Hackman selects him to be his assistant coach. You know immediately that Shooter is going to sober up and become a real coach. The scenes where Hackman is thrown out of the game and Shooter must take over are forced and unrealistic; Hopper is unconvincing as a person stressed out over the combination of alcohol withdrawal and having to take charge.Even the scene when Hackman is attending a town meeting where the purpose is to decide whether he should be fired lacks a great deal of tension.

The town doesn't warm up to his training methods and belief in his players strict adherence to every word he says - and they even attempt to fire him. Only when the small town's star player threatens to sit it out for the season unless the coach stays does the town back down and let the new coach do things his way. And once the team starts listening, they start winning.An inspiring film about teamwork, optimism, and giving people a second chance, this is a movie the entire family will enjoy.

149568,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0792843592,Craig Connell,"[4, 5]","What makes this one of the most popular sports films of all time isn't just the sport, it's because it's such a human-interest film, such a wonderful story of giving people second chances in life. Add a true-life David beat Goliath story and you have an appealing film.It doesn't hurt that Gene Hackman is the star, either. He may not have that celebrity appeal or the looks of Clark Gable or Bratt Pitt, but this man can flat-out act! He makes a very believable high school basketball coach who is tough-but-fair on the outside and soft-and-compassionate on the inside.The story of an extremely tiny school defying the odds and becoming a state champion in dramatic form was so inspiring that this film has played thousands of times for 20 years now by high school coaches to their kids for motivation.But the key to the story is the coach getting a second chance in life to do what he loves and does best and he, in turn, giving others a second chance such as the alcoholic here played by Dennis Hopper. There are great lessons on teamwork, patience, tolerance and a whole bunch of other qualities. In one of the DVD documentaries, both Hackman and Hoppper comment on how many times people have approached them and THIS is the movie they mention that meant so much them. That says a lot since both men have made many famous movies. By the way, the  ACTUAL game that was played, which also is on this two-disc set, is boring....nothing like the film.An unsung hero of this movie is the cinematography. Man, this is beautifully filmed and the rural Midwest has never looked so pretty and appealing. The story takes place in Indiana but the movie was done in Illinois. Either way, it paints a beautiful picture of this part of the United States. It also paints a fond remembrance of the early 1950s. You get an honest-to-goodness feel of what it's like to be part of a basketball in this area during that time,Basketball meant an awful lot - and still does - to these folks. If you are sports fan in particularly, this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes. However, this story is for everyone who believes people deserve chances to overcome previous mistakes.

149570,A31LHED3SKLWVB,0792843592,Darren,"[0, 0]","They appear to have actually shot this thing on location:  that opening drive across the flatlands looks about as real as it gets.  Rarely -- almost never, really -- does a formulaic Hollywood product come across so authentically.  Small white wood churches.  One-lane farm roads.  Corn rows.  Falling leaves under gun-metal gray skies.  It's autumn in Indiana:  time for school, and basketball.The authenticity comes through in the characters, despite all the programmed searching for redemption built into almost everyone we meet:  the attractive spinster, the town drunk living off booze and memories of glory days, the kids on the team, the town itself.  But it's Gene Hackman's new-in-town basketball coach who comes across the most authentically.  After getting grilled by Hershey upon first acquaintance, and then getting ignored by the local young b-ball hero tossing free throws in the gym, Hackman immediately snaps to his new employer, ""Real friendly town you got here.""  The town men invite Hackman to a klatch in the local cafe, trying to get a bead on him.  The townsmen are shown huffing and puffing, theorizing, offering the new coach advice.  Brilliantly, the script sets all that up for this coup de grace:  ""Gentlemen,"" Hackman finally says, ""It's been nice chatting with you all.  Good night,"" and he walks out the door.  Sternly, he lectures the townspeople at the gym, not long before the team's first game, to ""respect these kids.  This is your team.""  We linger a moment in the uncomfortable silence in the bleachers, and then we move on.  When his job is threatened, he tells everyone evenly, ""I apologize for nothing.""  I love that the writers didn't make Hackman particularly likable, or even particularly unlikable.  We hear a backstory about an assault on one of his players years ago when he was a college b-ball coach, and we believe it.  Not because of Hackman's performance:  he never raises his voice except on the court to referees, and he never strikes anyone in the movie.  But Hackman's no-nonsense style makes it easy for us to conceive that he may have been violent before he got old enough to control himself.  The performance matches the character:  no flourishes, no camera-mugging, no grandstanding, no nonsense.The basketball action itself will be of antiquarian interest to basketball fans.  There appears to be no 3-point rule (I'm not an expert, I admit, but one kid keeps making these long-distance shots and the scoreboard only registers 2 points); there are no dunks, slammed or otherwise; there are no histrionics from the players to the crowd or to the cameras.  There are, in fact, no cameras:  it's 1951, and if you're not at the game, you're listening to it on the radio.  The game burned into your imagination even more deeply as a result.Those times are gone; this movie, for a space of two hours, brings them back.  4 out of 5.",4,Before the Dunk,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2886,"['appear', 'have', 'actually', 'shot', 'thing', 'location', 'opening', 'drive', 'flatlands', 'as', 'real', 'Rarely', 'almost', 'never', 'really', 'formulaic', 'Hollywood', 'product', 'come', 'so', 'authentically', 'Small', 'white', 'wood', 'churches', 'One-lane', 'farm', 'roads', 'Corn', 'Falling', 'leaves', 'gun-metal', 'gray', 'skies', 'autumn', 'Indiana', 'time', 'school', 'basketball.The', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'programmed', 'searching', 'redemption', 'built', 'almost', 'everyone', 'meet', 'attractive', 'spinster', 'town', 'drunk', 'living', 'off', 'booze', 'memories', 'glory', 'days', 'kids', 'team', 'town', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'new-in-town', 'basketball', 'coach', 'who', 'most', 'authentically', 'getting', 'grilled', 'Hershey', 'first', 'acquaintance', 'then', 'getting', 'ignored', 'local', 'young', 'b-ball', 'hero', 'tossing', 'free', 'throws', 'gym', 'Hackman', 'immediately', 'new', 'employer', 'Real', 'friendly', 'town', 'got', 'here', 'town', 'men', 'invite', 'Hackman', 'klatch', 'local', 'cafe', 'trying', 'get', 'bead', 'townsmen', 'are', 'shown', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'theorizing', 'offering', 'new', 'coach', 'advice', 'Brilliantly', 'script', 'up', 'coup', 'de', 'grace', 'Gentlemen', 'Hackman', 'finally', 'been', 'nice', 'chatting', 'Good', 'night', 'out', 'door', 'Sternly', 'townspeople', 'gym', 'not', 'long', 'team', 'first', 'game', 'respect', 'kids', 'team', 'linger', 'moment', 'uncomfortable', 'silence', 'bleachers', 'then', 'move', 'When', 'job', 'threatened', 'everyone', 'evenly', 'apologize', 'nothing', 'love', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Hackman', 'particularly', 'likable', 'even', 'particularly', 'unlikable', 'hear', 'backstory', 'assault', 'one', 'players', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'b-ball', 'coach', 'believe', 'Not', 'Hackman', 'performance', 'never', 'voice', 'court', 'referees', 'never', 'anyone', 'movie', 'Hackman', 'no-nonsense', 'style', 'easy', 'conceive', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'violent', 'got', 'old', 'enough', 'control', 'performance', 'character', 'flourishes', 'camera-mugging', 'grandstanding', 'nonsense.The', 'basketball', 'action', 'will', 'be', 'antiquarian', 'interest', 'basketball', 'fans', 'be', '3-point', 'rule', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'admit', 'one', 'kid', 'making', 'long-distance', 'shots', 'scoreboard', 'only', '2', 'points', 'are', 'dunks', 'slammed', 'otherwise', 'are', 'histrionics', 'players', 'crowd', 'cameras', 'are', 'fact', 'cameras', '1951', ""'re"", 'not', 'game', ""'re"", 'listening', 'radio', 'game', 'burned', 'imagination', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'result.Those', 'times', 'are', 'gone', 'movie', 'space', 'two', 'hours', 'back', '4', '5']",N/A

The disc is advertised as widescreen (1.85:1) or if you prefer, (16:9) in aspect ratio. This is what I wanted, and what Amazon implies.In fact, the two-sided disc has both the standard 4:3 format, which is fine, but the 16:9 format is a rip-off. Instead of filling the screen it runs in a smaller 4:3 box with letterbox bars top and bottom. In other words, both sides of the disc appear just as they would on an older 4:3 television. None of the other reviewers mentioned this and I wish they had. I won't bother returning the disc since it's too much bother, but I'm very disappointed that Amazon has not made this fact clear to it's customers. Anyone expecting a wide-screen presentation is in for a real letdown. Another thing worth mentioning is that the cover art does not match the photo shown. The artwork is actually very similar to that shown for the BluRay edition. Some people have commented on the poor quality of the DVD transfer. I'm sorry to say it's true. The picture quality is grainy.I cannot for the life of me imagine why they used a 4:3 mask for both presentations. I'm sure many of you have seen movies with both aspect ratios on a double-sided disc and with the widescreen format properly filling all of a 16:9 screen, so it's not a technical issue. I suspect that the guy who was  responsible for the transfer to DVD, simply used the same mask for his own convenience. There is also another idiosyncrasy. The 4:3 side of the disc has an unusually long black-screen start. I thought the disc had failed at first. It's almost a minute before anything whatsoever appears after selecting Play. Does anyone know if ANY of Amazon's DVD editions has the true 16:9 presentation?",3,Hoosiers DVD,1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,1820,"['bought', 'movie', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'back', ""'m"", 'frankly', 'disappointed', 'Amazon', 'blew', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'disc', 'advertised', 'widescreen', '1.85:1', 'prefer', '16:9', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'what', 'wanted', 'what', 'Amazon', 'implies.In', 'fact', 'two-sided', 'disc', 'standard', '4:3', 'format', 'fine', '16:9', 'format', 'rip-off', 'Instead', 'filling', 'screen', 'smaller', '4:3', 'box', 'letterbox', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'other', 'words', 'sides', 'disc', 'appear', 'just', 'would', 'older', '4:3', 'television', 'None', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'wish', 'had', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'returning', 'disc', 'too', 'much', 'bother', ""'m"", 'very', 'disappointed', 'Amazon', 'not', 'made', 'fact', 'clear', 'customers', 'Anyone', 'expecting', 'wide-screen', 'presentation', 'real', 'letdown', 'thing', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'cover', 'art', 'not', 'match', 'photo', 'shown', 'artwork', 'actually', 'very', 'similar', 'shown', 'BluRay', 'edition', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'poor', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'true', 'picture', 'quality', 'grainy.I', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'imagine', 'why', 'used', '4:3', 'mask', 'presentations', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'double-sided', 'disc', 'widescreen', 'format', 'properly', 'filling', '16:9', 'screen', 'not', 'technical', 'issue', 'suspect', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'simply', 'used', 'same', 'mask', 'own', 'convenience', 'also', 'idiosyncrasy', '4:3', 'side', 'disc', 'unusually', 'long', 'black-screen', 'start', 'thought', 'disc', 'had', 'failed', 'first', 'almost', 'minute', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'selecting', 'Play', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', 'ANY', 'Amazon', 'DVD', 'editions', 'true', '16:9', 'presentation']",N/A

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[75, 79]","From the opening scenes of this film--majestic shots of a car traveling the rural midwest on a crisp autumn morning--HOOSIERS serves notice to the viewer that he or she is in for a wonderful movie experience.  Set in a tiny Indiana town half a century ago, HOOSIERS captures the look and feel of rural Americana, of a hardworking people with a single commonality:  their love for basketball.  The pure innocence of this film, innocence long lost over the subsequent decades, is magical.Gene Hackman portrays Coach Norman Dale, an outsider who comes to basketball-crazy Hickory, Indiana, to coach the high school team.  Haunted by mistakes made in his past, Dale is eager for the second chance he has been given.  Immediately, his no-nonsense, stress-the-fundamentals coaching philosophy puts him at odds with the town, yet Dale refuses to compromise his principles.  He survives--barely--a petition for his ouster, and the rest of the movie warmly portrays the town of Hickory and its high school basketball team coming together, a team that makes a magical run through the Indiana State Tournament.Barbara Hershey as Myra Fleener, Hickory's assistant principal, and Sheb Wooley as superintendent/principal Cletus--the man who hires Dale--are solid.  Yet Dennis Hopper gives the best performance as Wilbur &quot;Shooter&quot; Flatch.  Shooter, a former great player himself and father of one of the boys on Coach Dale's team, is the town drunk; despite his alcoholism, his knowledge of the game is immense, and Dale enlists his aid.  The reformation of this character--the feeling and depth that Hopper gives this role--is exceptional.Director David Anspaugh gives us a sensational &quot;feel good&quot; movie, augmented by Jerry Goldsmith's powerful musical score.

The characters are great--Gene Hackman as the hard-headed, disciplined coach somewhat in the Bobby Knight mould.  Dennis Hopper as the town drunk who gets a second chance at respect. (Since Hopper was a contemporary of James Dean, I've often wondered if Dean would have starred in this film had he lived).  Barbara Hershey is great as the schoolteacher who gives Hackman the cold shoulder, while secretly admiring him inside and falling for him in the end.  ""Jimmy Chitwood"" is superb as the laconic basketball prodigy.""Hoosiers"" depicts small town life in Indiana pretty accurately.  What most Indiana towns lack in cosmopolitanism they make up for in friendly, hard-working, faithful, decent folk.  Except there's a part in the movie where Barbara Hershey says something like, ""part of small town life is that folks' private affairs stay pretty much their own.""  She's obviously never lived in a small town!Basketball is like a religion in Indiana, so it's no wonder this story made it to the big screen.

There wasn't much in the way of entertainment in Anamoose, except the town had a movie theater and a basketball gym where the High School Anamoose Royals played their games. An arena, it was not. The gym building itself didn't amount to much in that the walls were only about 10 feet from the edge of the basketball floor and most of the people sat up in the perimeter balcony to watch the games. Whatever it may have lacked in amenities, it made up for it with a really intense environment. I can state, without hesitation, that some of the most intense basketball games of my life took place in that little building. You betcha! All of this  came back to me last night while I watched ""Hoosiers"" starring Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper. It was a really wonderful movie.Hackman played a washed-up, middle-aged basketball coach who had one final chance in a tiny Indiana town. They may have had only 67 boys in the high school, but they took their basketball seriously, as did the entire town. It may have been small, but it was intense, that's for certain! Hackman got the job following the death of the former coach and with only two weeks of practice before the initial game. He felt the need to wipe the slate clean as far as the previous setup was concerned and do things he felt were correct. He adopted a volunteer assistant coach (Dennis Hopper). His assistant knew basketball, but he was also the father of one of the team's players, in addition to being a recovering alcoholic who was struggling. Of course, it offended a lot of people. He lost his star player and started the season with a squad of only six guys. From that humble beginning, he built the season into one in which they won their division state championship. Progress wasn't in a straight line, to say the least. The story was exceptionally well put together. No frills. The acting was superb, right across the board. The setting and the people made me feel as if I was back in a small-town Great Plains environment in the early 50s. Trust me on that. The movie totally captured the looks and feel of small-time rural high school basketball. I'm amazed! Kudos to whoever put this thing together. I can't come up with a single criticism. I'm surprised that the film didn't capture the Academy Award for Best Picture. I guess it got a couple nominations, but, man, this was a really well done and intense movie.

But what of it? I am feeling mighty sentimental today, just the right mood to be in when talking about HOOSIERS, my favorite basketball movie right up until WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP came along. HOOSIERS is one of those movies that, whenever it comes across the television set, I'm compelled to stop and watch the thing  There's a reason HOOSIERS placed fourth in the AFI's list of all-time best sports movies.The story is based on real life events, tweaked for better viewing consumption. Instead of 1954, the film is set in 1951 in the fictional town of Hickory, Indiana. If you're any sort of basketball enthusiast, then you're already clued in that Indiana absolutely reveres its basketball, treats it like religion. Somewhere in Indiana, there's probably an altar dedicated to Steve Alford. Gene Hackman has one of his most ferocious and best ever roles in the highly volatile former college basketball coach Normal Dale. Down to his last chance, Coach Dale drives up to basketball-mad Hickory in 1951 and right away shifts the status quo with his ornery ways (some say, big city ways). Hickory is a tiny town, the high school basketball team comprising only six players and so we immediately regard the Hickory Huskers as extreme long shots.Everything works with this movie, everything. The story is warm and humorous. The acting is marvelous from Hackman on down. Dennis Hopper as the town drunk who becomes the reluctant assistant coach gets nominated for an Oscar. In a slow burn romance, Barbara Hershey plays the frosty schoolteacher whom Hackman eventually charms (or wears down, anyway). Maris Valainis - who was never much heard from again after this - breathes life and even this mythical aura into Jimmy Chitwood, the boy with few words and the supremely sweet shot. HOOSIERS is a shot of nostalgia, and because it evokes a more innocent era, it could get away with the sentimental stuff. It's cliched now, but those shots of the town faithfully traveling on the road with the team, that was really good.And perhaps no one moment defines this underdog feel so much as that one which had Ollie, the littlest guy on the team, sinking those two charity shots or, as I like to call it, the Sasha Vujajic Game 7 moment. It's set in stone that the Hickory Huskers will somehow reach the championship game, no surprises there. But the movie is so good at manipulating you that you can't help but get revved up when it all comes down to that last shot for the win, but even before that when, in that tense time out huddle, Jimmy Chitwood looks at the coach and calmly tells him: ""I'll make it."" In the best tradition of classic feel-good movies, you realize that your strings are being pulled. But that doesn't matter.",5,The legend of Jimmy Chitwood,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,2874,"[""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'sappy', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'movie', 'Let', 'win', 'one', 'small', 'schools', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'get', 'here', 'what', 'am', 'feeling', 'mighty', 'sentimental', 'today', 'just', 'right', 'mood', 'be', 'when', 'talking', 'HOOSIERS', 'favorite', 'basketball', 'movie', 'right', 'up', 'WHITE', 'MEN', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'JUMP', 'came', 'along', 'one', 'movies', 'whenever', 'television', 'set', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'stop', 'watch', 'thing', 'reason', 'HOOSIERS', 'placed', 'fourth', 'AFI', 'list', 'all-time', 'best', 'sports', 'movies.The', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'tweaked', 'better', 'viewing', 'consumption', 'Instead', '1954', 'film', 'set', '1951', 'fictional', 'town', 'Hickory', 'Indiana', ""'re"", 'sort', 'basketball', 'enthusiast', 'then', ""'re"", 'already', 'clued', 'Indiana', 'absolutely', 'basketball', 'religion', 'Somewhere', 'Indiana', 'probably', 'altar', 'dedicated', 'Steve', 'Alford', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'one', 'most', 'ferocious', 'best', 'ever', 'highly', 'volatile', 'former', 'college', 'basketball', 'coach', 'Normal', 'Dale', 'Down', 'last', 'chance', 'Coach', 'Dale', 'up', 'basketball-mad', 'Hickory', '1951', 'right', 'away', 'shifts', 'status', 'quo', 'ornery', 'ways', 'say', 'big', 'city', 'ways', 'Hickory', 'tiny', 'town', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'comprising', 'only', 'six', 'players', 'so', 'immediately', 'regard', 'Hickory', 'Huskers', 'extreme', 'long', 'shots.Everything', 'works', 'movie', 'everything', 'story', 'warm', 'humorous', 'acting', 'marvelous', 'Hackman', 'down', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'town', 'drunk', 'who', 'reluctant', 'assistant', 'coach', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'slow', 'burn', 'romance', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'frosty', 'schoolteacher', 'whom', 'Hackman', 'eventually', 'down', 'anyway', 'Maris', 'Valainis', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'much', 'heard', 'again', 'breathes', 'life', 'even', 'mythical', 'aura', 'Jimmy', 'Chitwood', 'boy', 'few', 'words', 'supremely', 'sweet', 'shot', 'HOOSIERS', 'shot', 'nostalgia', 'more', 'innocent', 'era', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'sentimental', 'stuff', 'cliched', 'now', 'shots', 'town', 'faithfully', 'traveling', 'road', 'team', 'was', 'really', 'good.And', 'perhaps', 'one', 'moment', 'underdog', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'had', 'Ollie', 'littlest', 'guy', 'team', 'sinking', 'two', 'charity', 'shots', 'like', 'call', 'Sasha', 'Vujajic', 'Game', '7', 'moment', 'set', 'stone', 'Hickory', 'Huskers', 'will', 'somehow', 'reach', 'championship', 'game', 'surprises', 'there', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'manipulating', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'get', 'revved', 'up', 'when', 'down', 'last', 'shot', 'win', 'even', 'when', 'tense', 'time', 'huddle', 'Jimmy', 'Chitwood', 'coach', 'calmly', 'tells', ""'ll"", 'make', 'best', 'tradition', 'classic', 'feel-good', 'movies', 'realize', 'strings', 'are', 'being', 'pulled', ""n't"", 'matter']",N/A

149595,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,0792843592,Jason,"[0, 1]","Let's be honest here, Hoosiers is the best basketball ever made.  It is the sports movie by which all future sports movies are made.  It's the classic tale of a small team overcoming great odds to win it all.  What makes this story so compelling is that it's based upon a true story.The Hickory Hucksters are a 1950s high school basketball team of small-town, rural Indiana.  They represent the entire town in the stereotypical story where the entire town shuts down on game night.  Filmed in a perfect representation of midwestern America, the blue-collar innocence is beautiful.A new coach named Norm Dale (Hackman) was just hired to lead the town's boys to victory, but everyone doesn't agree with this methods.  He's a mystery, and outsider, and he plans on teaching the boys the fundamentals of basketball, and this doesn't sit well with the town.Everyone knows the rest.  The coach and team overcome great odds, Jimmy Chitwood helps to save coach Dale's job by swaying the town hall vote, Shooter (Dennis Hopper) is given a chance at redemption - to himself, his family, and his town - the team is embraced by the town, and Jimmy leads them to a state championship.  It's an incredible tale with great action, compelling characters, and a happy ending.  I have a problem, however, and it is with coach Dale.While he may look the part and sound the part, coach Dale is a horrible coach, and I'm not sure if he really understands basketball at all.  His insistence on four passes is meant to teach a lesson on teamwork and running an offense, but that insistence also stifles creativity.  It is not unbelievable to envision several opportunities in which the team would have passed up easy shots for a much more difficult opportunity.That's bad enough as a basketball strategy, and I'm quite sure the original Muncie team didn't follow that obtuse gameplan, but the most egregious problem with the movie is coach Dale's final choice during the state playoffs.  At that point, Jimmy Chitwood was roughly 67 for 68 throughout the playoffs, missing MAYBE one shot.  Why on earth would coach Dale attempt to set up Jimmy as a decoy when it's plainly obvious that Jimmy's the entire team and can't be stopped by anyone on the planet?!  It's simply absurd.Don't get me wrong, the movie is awesome.  It's one of my favorites, but the coaching is ridiculous.",5,"I love the movie, but Coach Dale was a fraud",1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,2354,"['Let', 'be', 'honest', 'here', 'Hoosiers', 'best', 'basketball', 'ever', 'made', 'sports', 'movie', 'future', 'sports', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'classic', 'tale', 'small', 'team', 'overcoming', 'great', 'odds', 'win', 'What', 'story', 'so', 'compelling', 'based', 'true', 'story.The', 'Hickory', 'Hucksters', 'are', '1950s', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'team', 'small-town', 'rural', 'Indiana', 'represent', 'entire', 'town', 'stereotypical', 'story', 'where', 'entire', 'town', 'shuts', 'down', 'game', 'night', 'Filmed', 'perfect', 'representation', 'midwestern', 'America', 'blue-collar', 'innocence', 'beautiful.A', 'new', 'coach', 'named', 'Norm', 'Dale', 'Hackman', 'was', 'just', 'hired', 'lead', 'town', 'boys', 'victory', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'agree', 'methods', 'mystery', 'outsider', 'teaching', 'boys', 'fundamentals', 'basketball', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'town.Everyone', 'rest', 'coach', 'team', 'overcome', 'great', 'odds', 'Jimmy', 'Chitwood', 'save', 'coach', 'Dale', 'job', 'swaying', 'town', 'hall', 'vote', 'Shooter', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'given', 'chance', 'redemption', 'family', 'town', 'team', 'embraced', 'town', 'Jimmy', 'state', 'championship', 'incredible', 'tale', 'great', 'action', 'compelling', 'characters', 'happy', 'ending', 'have', 'problem', 'however', 'coach', 'may', 'look', 'part', 'sound', 'part', 'coach', 'Dale', 'horrible', 'coach', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'basketball', 'insistence', 'four', 'passes', 'meant', 'teach', 'lesson', 'teamwork', 'running', 'offense', 'insistence', 'also', 'creativity', 'not', 'unbelievable', 'envision', 'several', 'opportunities', 'team', 'would', 'have', 'passed', 'up', 'easy', 'shots', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'opportunity.That', 'bad', 'enough', 'basketball', 'strategy', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'original', 'Muncie', 'team', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'obtuse', 'gameplan', 'most', 'egregious', 'problem', 'movie', 'coach', 'Dale', 'final', 'choice', 'state', 'playoffs', 'point', 'Jimmy', 'Chitwood', 'was', 'roughly', '67', '68', 'playoffs', 'missing', 'MAYBE', 'one', 'shot', 'Why', 'earth', 'would', 'coach', 'Dale', 'attempt', 'set', 'up', 'Jimmy', 'decoy', 'when', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'Jimmy', 'entire', 'team', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'stopped', 'anyone', 'planet', 'simply', 'absurd.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'awesome', 'one', 'favorites', 'coaching', 'ridiculous']",N/A

I saw the movie at a theater in 1986, loved it and went back the following day to see it again, bought a VHS tape when it was released, and later the DVD. Now, I've recently bought this collector's edition and the recently-released soundtrack CD. If you're a Hoosiers fan, the collector's edition is a must-have. The deleted scenes bring back the continuity of the film, and suddenly, Barbara Hershey's role is restored to what it was meant to be before the producer was forced to get the film under a two-hour length.But as super as it was to see the deleted scenes for the first time, the ""Hoosiers History: The Truth Behind the Legend"" may be the best feature of the collector's edition. It's a mesmerizing behind the scenes look at how the movie came to be, intermixed with the real story of the Milan, Indiana team winning the Indiana state basketball championship in 1954. There's a great discussion with David Anspaugh (director), Angelo Pizzo (writer), and Carter DeHaven (producer), with movie characters like Maris Valanis (""Jimmy Chitwood"") and the real people like Bobby Plump, who made the winning shot.

A movie that shows a team or character that beats the odds and comes out a winner is always great to see.  Even better is when it happened in real life.  This is what this movie is based on, a tiny farming town in 1950's Indiana that rose above the odds and became the state champion by between a high school powerhouse that was at least 6 or 7 times bigger in population than the little high school.Gene Hackman plays the coach of the team who has a mysterious background.  He reminds me a bit of how the famous Bobby Knight is, a hard disciplinarian who instills pride, respect and total commitment to being the best.  Barbara Hershey plays his protaganist at the beginning of the movie, but later becomes the love interest.  Dennis Hopper, plays the town drunk, but who is also the source of basketball strategy that the team rely's on.The high school basketball team players are unknown actors, but who cares?  They do a great job.It is also nice to see how the town really is supportive of the team, but that is how Indiana Basketball is in reality.  The &quot;innocence&quot; of the 1950's is also shown in the movie, when things were a bit simpler and people had alot of faith in religion.

The characters, the places, the fervor surrounding the local basketball team are instantly recognizable and dead-on. These are my people and my places and the filmmakers got it exactly right.The opening scenes showing Gene Hackman driving through the Indiana countryside probably don't mean much to folks from outside Indiana and the midwest, but they almost bring a tear to my eye.As a side note, there's a little white country church where Hackman pauses to get his bearings. It stood at a crossroads in Boone County just northwest of Indianapolis. It was one of several churches that went up in flames in the late 1990s at the hands of a church arsonist. It's part of the local lore.As far as the characters go, Hackman did a credible job, but the real star of this film is Dennis Hopper. Barbara Hershey's character is an unwanted digression from the plot line and adds nothing of value to the film.And how many people realize the heart attack-prone principal of Hickory High, Sheb Wooley, is the guy who had a hit in the late '50s with the novelty record ""One-Eyed, One-Horned, Flying Purple People Eater?""Also, for those with home theater sound systems, the Dolby Surround Sound on the DVD is spectacular.

Basically, he is with them, win or lose.Hackman plays Norman Dale, a last chance basketball coach who was a national title winner in his university coaching days, however, his career ended suddenly.  He was in the navy for the last few decades and here is his opportunity to get back into basketball.  He comes to the small town of Hickory Indiana with a high school population of 65 students to coach and teach at the school.  All the town ever thinks about is basketball.  Some are stuck in the failure they had in their youth.Dale has to face the challenge of a lack of respect from the kids, the parents and the whole town.  There are glimmers of hope as one kid who walked off the court is brought back by his dad and apologizes.  The story is, hey just let him coach.  Hickory has only 6 players at the beginning with the best player sitting out basketball for his own reasons.  Jimmy is the best player that people have seen in years.  Dale acts unimpressed and tells Jimmy that in a one way conversation.  His caretaker is played by Barbara Hershey, who is also a teacher in the school who is unfriendly toward Dale from the time he arrives.Dale sticks to his guns and his process of leading his team.  Eventually the team starts to get it, but the town has had it with his approach.  Just as you think the door is closing, things turn around and Dale gets to continue to lead his team with the best player and finally, the full contingent of players he needs.  Although a small school, they go on to beat teams much bigger then they getting them into the championship game.The story has a lot of elements to it, persistence, a clear desire of everyone to be a winner, difference of opinion on how to get there, compassion and even a little love story to broaden the appeal of the movie.",5,"""You Are All Winners in My Book""",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,1910,"['Gene', 'Hackman', 'boys', 'are', 'take', 'part', 'state', 'championship', 'game', 'Butler', 'stadium', 'Basically', 'win', 'lose.Hackman', 'plays', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'last', 'chance', 'basketball', 'coach', 'who', 'was', 'national', 'title', 'winner', 'university', 'coaching', 'days', 'however', 'career', 'ended', 'suddenly', 'was', 'navy', 'last', 'few', 'decades', 'here', 'opportunity', 'get', 'back', 'basketball', 'small', 'town', 'Hickory', 'Indiana', 'high', 'school', 'population', '65', 'students', 'coach', 'teach', 'school', 'town', 'ever', 'basketball', 'are', 'stuck', 'failure', 'had', 'youth.Dale', 'face', 'challenge', 'lack', 'respect', 'kids', 'parents', 'whole', 'town', 'are', 'glimmers', 'hope', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'walked', 'off', 'court', 'brought', 'back', 'dad', 'apologizes', 'story', 'hey', 'just', 'let', 'coach', 'Hickory', 'only', '6', 'players', 'beginning', 'best', 'player', 'sitting', 'out', 'basketball', 'own', 'reasons', 'Jimmy', 'best', 'player', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Dale', 'acts', 'unimpressed', 'tells', 'Jimmy', 'one', 'way', 'conversation', 'caretaker', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'who', 'also', 'teacher', 'school', 'who', 'unfriendly', 'Dale', 'time', 'sticks', 'guns', 'process', 'leading', 'team', 'Eventually', 'team', 'get', 'town', 'had', 'approach', 'Just', 'think', 'door', 'closing', 'things', 'turn', 'around', 'Dale', 'continue', 'lead', 'team', 'best', 'player', 'finally', 'full', 'contingent', 'players', 'small', 'school', 'go', 'beat', 'teams', 'much', 'bigger', 'then', 'getting', 'championship', 'game.The', 'story', 'lot', 'elements', 'persistence', 'clear', 'desire', 'everyone', 'be', 'winner', 'difference', 'opinion', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'compassion', 'even', 'little', 'love', 'story', 'broaden', 'appeal', 'movie']",N/A

It is a great American film about the quintessential American myth- David vs. Goliath. While there is precious little historical evidence that the little guy rarely ever really wins in this nation in the real world, we would all like to believe that it is true. Right can stand up to might. Team play, selflessness, generosity and courage will carry the day. We all wish they would, but reality is they don't. Usually the Big is just way too Big, and the the regular guy is too caught up in making it from week to week to even care about the bigger picture, much less fight against it. Yet we all know that occasionally the improbable happens. A team of American kids wins Olympic Gold in Hockey while going up against the imperious Russian team along the way. A team of misfits stumble into a Superbowl win. A small town school can rise up and become the greatest power in Basketball in a Basketball crazed state such as Indiana. At least for one season, anyway. While the facts, the characters, the years and the reasons are all changed to protect the integrity of the Myth being told, the results are true. And when this movie finishes taking you on it's wonderful ride, you will be glad you watched this little gem. The film has a wonderful and nostalgic take on American small town life. This overall affection that the film makers have for their characters and the locale of the movie is then combined with an achingly beautiful color pallette, a real ear for the dialogue of the place and time, and a cast of America's finest actors and actresses.

Patterson ""cormac""","[1, 1]","** Spoilers Ahead -- Beware **""Hoosiers"" portrays Indiana high school basketball as it was in the 1950s, perhaps the grandest age of Indiana high school basketball in the history of the state. The scenes of a line of headlights following the team bus to games through the fallow fields of Indiana are reminiscent of my memories certainly even though mine are from the 70s. There were changes underway in the 70s that would forever change Hoosier basketball except for in the smallest towns in rural surroundings that resisted ""school consolidation"" where the town's population of 2,000 and under forced a coach to use every resource he or she had in the most imaginative way possible. With a high school population of 200 or so and 100 of those let's say being boys, you get a pretty thin pick most years and many coaches even have to cajole some boys to play these days since most interests lay far more in less physical activities than basketball, etc. Spotting a capable boy in a phys ed class or hearing about a possibility through the grapevine is a recruiting tool most coaches in these areas use with fervor. And of course, players over 6'4' are a rarity rather than a standard as in high schools in large cities who can select from student bodies of five or six thousand (as evidenced when Hickory confronts South Bend, a big high school with a huge front-line for those days especially as they are listed as 6'4', 6'4', and 6'5').But basketball in the small rural towns that are steadily disappearing throughout the state is still rather similar to what is portrayed in this movie set during the 1951-52 season. Many fans will still follow the team bus (usually also followed by a ""fan bus"" or two filled with students so they have easy access to the game and can go along with their friends) and many of the gyms are ""cracker boxes"" as they are known with walls or bleachers leaving barely enough room for a big-footed player to stay out-of-bounds when passing the ball back in after a stoppage of play. Not to mention there is hardly enough room for a hard-driving player to stop before hitting the wall as a hard, thin gym mat is usually hung under the basket as ""protection"" though having gone near-full speed into these many a'time, there just ain't much use for the gym mat being there except perhaps to make a player's mother feel better about her boy flying into it time and again. But these gyms are real Hoosier gyms: they are hot, tight, and filled to the rafters with plenty of fans standing on the floor left open at the ends of each bleacher section to see as much of the game as one can from these obstructed-view seats. Some schools will even crank up the heat and with all the bodies packed in on game night, everyone is sweating nearly as much as the players as the coach and his cohorts will try anything for a bit more home-court advantage. The noise is deafening (though oddly enough I never heard the crowd when I played ... more of a vague, echoing sound chamber where I always heard the players easily ... I've spoken to other players a few who said the same believe it or not though most will say that they couldn't hear anything but the crowd). As a fan however you made as much noise as you could regardless of whether it ended up hurting or helping your team. If the opposing fans were loud, you tried to be louder, simple as that, despite the fact that it might hinder your team.But this film captures more than the feel of those long-past years: it captures the human complexities of many characters and does not just present cardboard Hollywood cutouts of characters we've seen time and time again ... especially of the head coach, Norman Dale (as always perfectly brought to silver-screen life by the legendary Gene Hackman who, for some reason passing all understanding received NO NOMINATIONS IN ANY OF THE BIG AWARDS GROUPS, such as the Oscar or Golden Globe, for his dead-on perfect job), who we find out through the course of the movie is a former, national championship-winning collegiate coach who was banned from college and from at least one state from coaching after punching one of his own players during a game. He later explains to his love interest Myra Fleener (again perfectly portrayed by Barbara Hershey, who was also shunned by the awards organizations) when she brings up the incident that ""He can't explain it"". The player was the best player he ever had, willfull, hard-nosed, etc., just like the coach when you hear and see him explaining it, but it happened and he spent the last twelve years prior to the new high school job at tiny (and fictional) Hickory High School as a Chief Petty Officer in the Navy. You can see his heart breaking as he talks about it as Hackman brings so much power and honesty to the role which, a born-and-raised Hoosier such as myself would have to think, was based or inspired in part by the tumultuous but brilliant Indiana University head coach, Bob Knight. Both win and turn out tough players many of whom would never have reached their level of skill without such a coach but also both coaches go ""over the line"" now and then and it is difficult even for the most erstwhile fans to turn a blind eye or ear to such events.The actor who did garner many awards nominations as ""Hoosiers"" served as a big-comeback film for his career was Dennis Hopper. Hopper portrays ""Shooter"", a local basketball hero from many years past and now the town drunk whose son also plays on the team. Dale takes it upon himself (once the school's principal Cletus -- we don't get his last name -- who served as Dale's assistant coach suffers a mild heart attack) to dry out Shooter and have him replace Cletus as the assistant coach. Shooter does so, for a time, and Dale gets himself kicked out of a game to put Shooter in the position to take the team down the stretch to win an important game. Shooter succeeds and the buildup from the character who is struck to silence by the situation initially to seeing he can do it and confidently calling the final play to win the game. It is quite a wonderful scene and is a real high-point for the movie as Shooter's son who has been embarrassed and even hateful toward his father as he has unsuccessfully tried to keep him dry for many years we assume, came over to his father following the win and says, ""You did good, Pop, real good"" as you can see it is the first time in a long, long time that the son and father have connected in any kind of positive way. The scene is not overdone or sappy in any way ... it is played out with restraint and careful dialogue since you have to know that the son is still wondering in the back of his mind just how long this sobriety will last.Well, not to spoil too much of the film as well as there being so many other fine reviews on the site, I'll just leave my review at that. Yes, Hopper certainly deserved the many nominations he received for his work in the film. The casting for the film was so well done and the recreation of 1950s Indiana on film is dead-on perfect. Few period-piece films of any period do as capable a job as this one in recapturing and presenting the past in an accurate manner.The snub of Hackman as well as Hershey is a mystery to me however. This is one of Hackman's finest films in a long, long line of excellent roles. I rarely miss a Hackman film since even if the film around him is poor, he is still worth the price of admission just to watch him work. He is truly one of the finest American actors ever produced and unfortunately is equally ignored by the Academy or its poorer cousin, the Golden Globes. Hackman always brings such depth to his roles and his skill as an actor in finding the key parts of a character are not surpassed by any other actor in my humble opinion. They might be equalled by a small group of American actors but none surpass him.So for those of you who still haven't seen this film or for those born-and-bred Hoosiers out there who might be relocated somewhere, this is a fine film that will bring many emotions to the surface as you travel along with the little Hickory team as they try and win the finest title in all of sports (imho lol).",5,"""Hoosiers"", at least old Hoosiers, will have a flood of memories with this",1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,8165,"['**', 'Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'Beware', '**', 'Hoosiers', 'Indiana', 'high',

I love hoop films, so I jumped at the opportunity to watch this one, having heard that it is a great film. Well for once, the word out on the street is on the money.This is a superlative film, beautifully directed by David Anspaugh, about a great basketball coach whose initial coaching career was derailed by his Achilles heel. It is a story about the effect that one can have on the lives of others. It is a story about being given a second chance. It is a story about hope. It is a story about redemption. It is a story about community. It is a story about overcoming all odds. Quite simply, it is a film that will not fail to capture the viewer, heart and soul.The setting for the film is the nineteen fifties and appears to be based upon a true story. Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) has a skeleton in his closet and is given a second chance at coaching. Buried deep in the cornfields of Indiana is the small town of Hickory, which has a very small high school with a basketball team called the Hickory Hucksters. Coach Dale takes this team and tries to ensure that the players are all grounded in the fundamentals of the game, as their idea of basketball had been just to point and shoot. He wants to make it a team of which all can be proud. His hardline approach meets some initial resistance that causes his best player to leave the team, but even he eventually returns to the fold. This is not, however, just a film about a basketball team's struggle to make it to the state championship.This being a small town, Coach Dale, as an outsider, runs into some small town politics that threaten to run him out of town. Cooler heads prevail, and he is given his chance to be all he can be. While what he does with the team is remarkable, it is his interaction with others in the town that is even more so. He begins a relationship with the high school's assistant principal, Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey), and brings some passion into her otherwise lackluster existence. He takes Wilbur 'Shooter' Flatch (Dennis Hopper), the town drunk and estranged father to one of the team's key players, under his wing and gives him a new lease on life. Along the way, Coach Dale even manages to give the town a basketball team of which it can be proud. He and the team put the town on the map. How they do it is the crux of the movie.Gene Hackman is simply sensational as the coach, a man who wants his life back and is given a second chance to grab for the brass ring. He infuses his character with a toughness and, simultaneously, a tenderness that makes him three dimensional. Dennis Hopper gives a truly remarkable performance as the drunk who finds his way out of the bottle long enough to take stock of himself. When Coach Hackman, seeing that he has a lot of knowledge of basketball, extends him a helping hand and affords him an opportunity to regain his self-respect and repair his relationship with his son, he responds in a way he had never thought possible. Hopper gives a performance of a lifetime, infusing his character with just the right amount of pathos, vulnerability, and hope. His is truly a bravura performance. Barbara Hershey, as always, gives an excellent performance, impressing upon the viewer the internal conflicts with which her character is struggling. The rest of the supporting cast contribute with fine performances, as well.This is a great film on many levels and one that is well worth having in one's personal collection.

149623,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,0792843592,Linda Linguvic,"[1, 1]","This 1986 film was on TV last night.  It sounded familiar to me but I had never seen it.  Even though I DVR'd it, I still had to wade through a whole bunch of commercials that appeared regularly at 15-minute intervals.  But it was worth it because Hoosiers is a really good film.The film is set in 1951 when life was simpler and towns were smaller.  And this rural Indiana town was so small that they could barely get enough high school students for the basketball team.  Gene Hackman is the new coach in town.  He's a little old for the job but he has a past that he wants to forget.  Barbara Hersey is a teacher who distrusts Hackman.  Eventually, though, they do fall in love.

149638,AYU9LBROYQBG6,0792843592,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[4, 5]","The film is not really based on the story of the 1954 Indiana state champions, Milan High School (pronounced /'ma'l'n/ MY-lun), but the term ""inspired by a true story"" may be more appropriate as there is little in the movie that coincides at all with Milan's 1953-54 season other than that both were small schools that won the State Championship in the 1950s. The winning shot in the movie was based on Bobby Plump's last second shot to win the 1954 Indiana State Basketball Championship. In most US states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. At the time, Indiana conducted a single state basketball championship for all of its high schools, and continued to do so until 1997.Some elements of the film do match closely with those of Milan's real story. Like the movie's Hickory High School, Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by two points: Hickory won 42-40, and Milan won 32-30. The final seconds of the Hoosiers state final hold fairly closely to the details of Milan's 1954 final; the final shot in the movie was taken from virtually the same spot on the floor as Bobby Plump's actual game-winner. The movie's final game was even shot in the same building that hosted the 1954 Indiana final, Butler University's Hinkle Fieldhouse (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in Indianapolis.The rostersIn the movie, Hickory begins its season without tryouts, Drew Igel wins the position over most of the other players. as only seven players are even concerned with playing basketball for Hickory. Two players quit the team on the first day of practice, though one returns the next day and the other also returns to the team later into the season. Jimmy Chitwood is also added halfway through the season, bringing its roster to seven plus Ollie, the manager, who sees some time on account of injuries. At Milan, 58 of the 73 boys enrolled at the school tried out for the team, and had a roster consisting of 10 players.Coaching controversy?The controversy surrounding the coach and his methods, an important element of the movie's story, was completely absent in Milan -- at least by 1954. Milan had fired its previous coach, Herman ""Snort"" Grinstead, after the 1951-52 season for ordering new uniforms against the superintendent's orders. Years later, Plump would tell an ESPN interviewer that Grinstead had been ""the most popular coach in Milan's history."" While Grinstead's successor, Marvin Wood, would initially make some waves in Milan, he was never the target of a town meeting to have him fired (unlike the movie). In his first season as coach in 1952-53, he would lead Milan to the state semifinals, defusing any remaining criticism.Town drunkThe town drunk character in the movie, Wilbur ""Shooter"" Flatch, is the father of one of the members of the team, and becomes one of the assistant coaches. He has no Milan counterpart.The previous coachIn the movie, Hickory's best player initially refuses to play, devastated by the sudden death of his previous coach. This has no parallel in the Milan story; as noted above, Milan's previous coach had been fired two years before their championship.The managerHickory's manager, Ollie MacFarlane, plays in one game when the Huskers have no other players left, and sinks two free throws to win a key game. Milan had a manager with a similar name, Oliver Jones, but he never played.The school songThe school song played twice in the Hickory/Linton game is not Milan's, but Manchester High School's located in North Manchester, Indiana. Filmakers wanted to use it because it was one of the few only original school songs in Indiana. The song was composed by former Manchester High School band and Manchester Civic Band director Harold Leckrone.[4]Underdog statusHickory is depicted as a massive underdog throughout the movie. Milan entered the 1953-54 season as one of the favorites to win the state title, as it returned four starters from the state semifinalists of 1952-53.Close tournament finishesIn the movie, Hickory wins each of its tournament games by two points or less. In 1954, Milan won seven of its eight tournament games leading up to the final by double-digit margins, and the other by 8 points.Head coachesWood, who died of bone cancer in 1999, could hardly have been more different from Hickory coach Norman Dale (the Gene Hackman character). Dale is a middle-aged former college coach with a shady past and a volatile temper, and had a romantic relationship with a fellow Hickory teacher. Wood was only 26, and married with two children, when Milan won the state title, and had coached the Indians to the 1953 state semifinals. By almost all reports, Wood was a soft-spoken man of high integrity who often practiced alongside his players.The championship game opponentIn the state championship scene, the movie portrays South Bend Central (chosen presumably because Milan had lost to South Bend Central in the 1953 state semifinals) as a predominantly black team. The real team was from Muncie Central High School, which had a predominantly white team with three black members. The movie probably borrowed from the actual history of the 1954 semistate final (state quarterfinals), in which Milan defeated the segregated Crispus Attucks High School in Indianapolis, led by all-time great Oscar Robertson, then a sophomore. In the movie, the South Bend Central coach is played by Ray Crowe, who coached Crispus Attucks in 1954 and would, the next year, lead the team to become the first all-black team in the United States to win a state championship playing against schools with white players. The Attucks team, with Crowe as coach and Robertson as floor leader, would repeat as state champions in 1956, becoming the first undefeated team in Indiana high school history.",5,THE KING OF ALL

149644,A3EOYN87MMNHL1,0792843592,Phoebe Stogstill,"[1, 1]","I find myself scratching my head and wondering why I NEVER SAW THIS MOVIE when it came out in 1986. ""Retro Phoebe"" is enthralled during opening scenes as she witnesses first one, then many classic automobiles cruising Indiana backroads.  The action is set in the early 1950s and sets and costuming are very good and authentic.  We are intrigued as Norm (Gene Hackman) comes to the small town of Hickory to take on a teaching and basketball coaching position at the high school. As he makes contact with the man who hired him (Sheb Wooley) we wonder about his mysterious past and why he has not been teaching or coaching in his recent history but has been a chief pettit officer in the Navy instead. There are many townspeople also curious about this and many including Myra (Barbara Hershey, assistant principal) are back-biting and rude to his face.  The good people of Hickory are steeped in tradition, isolated, suspicious of outsiders and stuck in the rut of ""our way or no way.""  They do not understand Norm's methods of tough love for his new team, nor do they see the wisdom of his psychological techniques: he kicks members off the team for insubordination and tells them not to come back until they are ready to play by his rules, he refuses to be bullied by town fathers and bars them from the locker room and gym, he does not actively recruit the dormant star player of past years, knowing that the young man must return on HIS OWN TERMS to be effective as a player, as he has gone through traumas and cannot be pushed. The team is so small that they don't even have enough players and one is very short, but effective as many short BB players can be by their ability to weave in and out of the larger players. Norm builds up a sense of pride in them and cooperation. He teaches them to play as a team instead of a bunch of individual independents.  We cringe as Norm is kicked out of game after game by a biased referee.  Enter ""Shooter."" Shooter is a basketball expert and father of one of the team members. He is a chronic alcoholic who lives in a shack in the woods, a source of constant embarassment to his son. Norm encourages him to clean himself up and be his ""right hand man."" Dennis Hopper plays this role in one of his most brilliant performances on screen.  The town of Hickory has had it by now, with Norm and tries to get him ousted as coach.This does not work and the team continues to improve and go on to tournament ball. Somehow they are able to make it to state. This reviewer is taking note of the tenseness of her own body, the tightening of muscles as she views the scenes of exciting basketball.  My own High School basketball team had this same experience and I attended all of the exciting games even the ones in the state capitol. This is a wonderful movie about perserverance and the role of NORM is played to perfection by Mr. Hackman. In the end we see how Norm has such a kind heart not only for his team members but in helping the town see the error of their ways in judging others, including Shooter. A marvelous movie, I might say.",5,It's Not Over 'Til It's Over!,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3075,"['find', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'why', 'NEVER', 'SAW', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1986', 'Retro', 'Phoebe', 'enthralled', 'opening', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'then', 'many', 'classic', 'automobiles', 'cruising', 'Indiana', 'backroads', 'action', 'set', 'early', '1950s', 'sets', 'costuming', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'authentic', 'are', 'intrigued', 'Norm', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'small', 'town', 'Hickory', 'take', 'teaching', 'basketball', 'coaching', 'position', 'high', 'school', 'contact', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'Sheb', 'Wooley', 'wonder', 'mysterious', 'past', 'why', 'not', 'been', 'teaching', 'coaching', 'recent', 'history', 'been', 'chief', 'pettit', 'officer', 'Navy', 'instead', 'are', 'many', 'townspeople', 'also', 'curious', 'many', 'including', 'Myra', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'assistant', 'principal', 'are', 'back-biting', 'rude', 'face', 'good', 'people', 'Hickory', 'are', 'steeped', 'tradition', 'isolated', 'suspicious', 'outsiders', 'stuck', 'rut', 'way', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'Norm', 'methods', 'tough', 'love', 'new', 'team', 'do', 'see', 'wisdom', 'psychological', 'techniques', 'members', 'team', 'insubordination', 'tells', 'not', 'come', 'back', 'are', 'ready', 'play', 'rules', 'be', 'bullied', 'town', 'fathers', 'bars', 'locker', 'room', 'gym', 'not', 'actively', 'recruit', 'dormant', 'star', 'player', 'past', 'years', 'knowing', 'young', 'man', 'must', 'return', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'TERMS', 'be', 'effective', 'player', 'gone', 'traumas', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pushed', 'team', 'so', 'small', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'enough', 'players', 'one', 'very', 'short', 'effective', 'many', 'short', 'BB', 'players', 'can', 'be', 'ability', 'weave', 'larger', 'players', 'Norm', 'up', 'sense', 'pride', 'cooperation', 'play', 'team', 'instead', 'bunch', 'individual', 'independents', 'cringe', 'Norm', 'kicked', 'game', 'game', 'biased', 'referee', 'Enter', 'Shooter', 'Shooter', 'basketball', 'expert', 'father', 'one', 'team', 'members', 'chronic', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'shack', 'woods', 'source', 'constant', 'embarassment', 'son', 'Norm', 'clean', 'up', 'be', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'screen', 'town', 'Hickory', 'had', 'now', 'Norm', 'tries', 'get', 'ousted', 'coach.This', 'not', 'work', 'team', 'improve', 'go', 'tournament', 'ball', 'Somehow', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'state', 'reviewer', 'taking', 'note', 'tenseness', 'own', 'body', 'tightening', 'muscles', 'scenes', 'exciting', 'basketball', 'own', 'High', 'School', 'basketball', 'team', 'had', 'same', 'experience', 'attended', 'exciting', 'games', 'even', 'ones', 'state', 'capitol', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'perserverance', 'role', 'NORM', 'played', 'perfection', 'Mr.', 'Hackman', 'end', 'see', 'how', 'Norm', 'kind', 'heart', 'not', 'only', 'team', 'members', 'helping', 'town', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'judging', 'others', 'including', 'Shooter', 'A', 'marvelous', 'movie', 'might', 'say']",N/A

149647,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,0792843592,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","""Hoosiers"" is an excellent movie based, as they say, on a true story.  I believe it was the small Indiana community of Milan that beat the big schools to win the Indiana state basketball championship back in the 1950's.  No doubt, they're still talking about that today back in the Hoosier State.  Someone got the excellent idea to make a movie about it and decided to take the time and do it right.  Doing it right meant getting an outstanding screenplay, excellent direction, terrific acting, as well as top-notch film editing.The movie could have been just a nice, feel-good movie that rah-rahhed its' way from start to finish.  It avoided that by creating conflict, uncertainty, and personal shortcomings in its' main characters.  We are never quite certain what will develop with the different relationships.  About the only character stereotype is the collective character of the know-it-all townsfolk who want to fire the coach for not doing things ""their way"".  There are times when this delving into character development comes close to losing the viewer.  The character, for example, played by Dennis Hopper, seems out of place at times.  Many of us never quite get used to what his role actually is.  However, Hopper gives an excellent performance and probably helps to keep us just confused enough so as not to know what comes next.  That's good because even the person who saw the movie without hearing how it turned out could probably guess that we weren't going through all of this just to see our team lose at the buzzer.  The thrill of victory is there but it is balanced with an appealing sense of comaradarie that assures us that this team would have lost with class had that been its' fate.It was just a year or so ago that the State of Indiana dropped its' one tier level of play in the state basketball tournament.  No more Milans, no more ""Hoosiers"", and probably a lot more opportunity for the little schools to bring home a state championship.  The one in a million long shot is exciting but it's only this exciting because the odds really are for real.  ""Hoosiers"" lets us feel the joy a whole state felt some 50 years ago.

149652,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0792843592,Robert Morris,"[23, 29]","How true-to-life is this immensely popular film? In an article written for ESPN Page 2, Jeff Merron notes a number of differences between the ""real"" story about a small Indiana high school which wins the state championship and the ""reel"" story which appears in the film directed by David Anspaugh, with Gene Hackman starring in a script written by Alvin Sargent. (The entire article can be accessed by visiting [...]) The significant differences noted by Merron include these:""In real life, Milan High School didn't come out of nowhere. The Indians had made the state semifinals the previous season. In reel life: The team that wins the championship is Hickory High. In real life: The team that won the championship is Milan High. There is no town of Hickory in Indiana. In reel life: Hickory wins the title in 1952. In real life: Milan won the title in 1954. In reel life: The previous coach dies, which is a crucial part of the plot -- the team's star player, Jimmy, doesn't play part of the season because he's so upset. In real life: The previous coach, Herman &quot;Snort&quot; Grinstead, who Bobby Plump (the real-life hero) said in an ESPN chat was &quot;the most popular coach in Milan's history,&quot; was fired for ordering new uniforms against the superintendent's orders.""In reel life: Coach Dale alienates just about everyone with his independence, and there is a town referendum on whether the school should keep Dale on as coach. In real life: Marvin Wood did face an uphill struggle, because he replaced Snort and changed both his offense and defense. But by the time the Milan Indians were playing their championship season, he had won the town over. In reel life: The assistant coach, &quot;Shooter,&quot; (played by Dennis Hopper in an Oscar-nomination performance), is the town drunk and the father of one of the players. In real life: There was no assistant coach.""These may be among the most significant differences between ""real"" and ""reel"" but invariably, certain liberties must be taken with historical material to increase and enhance the dramatic impact of a film based on (but not limited to) that material. In this instance, Anspaugh, screenwriters Pizzo and Sargent, Hackman, and their associates have a story to tell and they tell it very, very well. As always, Hackman is first-rate, as are Barbara Hershey in her role as the obligatory love interest (Myra Fleener) and Hopper as Shooter, a name so appropriate to the character that nothing more need be said. Yes, this is a ""feel good"" film among several (e.g. Rudy on which Anspaugh and Pizzo also collaborated later) which have been immensely popular. However, the film has crisp direction, an excellent cast, and a story line close enough to what really did happen in 1954. FYI, here are a few brief passages from the official Web site of Milan, Indiana:""Milan, Indiana, a quiet rural town in the southeastern part of the state, was the scene of one of the greatest basketball stories in history.The rise of the 1954 Milan basketball team actually started the preceding year.In 1953, the team went all the way to the final four only to be beaten in the semi-finals.Then the 1954 season arrived.""In a high school of 162 total students, 73 were boys. A young Marvin Wood was returning for his second year as coach, along with Marc Combs and Clarence Kelly. The core of the 1953 team also returned. From this came the David vs. Goliath championship story.""Although their accomplishments seem to have grown to almost mythical proportions as the story of the greatest underdog in sports' history throughout the years, there was a real team who lived a dream that came to life. Under the leadership of twenty-six year old coach Marvin Wood, the Indians began their rise to the top of the 751 teams entered in that year's tournament, with a record of 19-2. The mighty men of Milan then cruised through the state tournament relatively untested, until the final game against Muncie Central. The Indians were paced in scoring throughout the game by senior Ray Craft. However, Coach Wood's delay tactic game plan would place the ball in the trusty hands of another senior, Bobby Plump.""Bobby Gene Plump, who at-the-buzzer hit the shot that gave tiny Milan High School the 1954 state basketball championship over the Muncie Central Bearcats. Called `the most famous shot in Indiana hoops history,' the real-life event became the basis for the fictionalized movie, Hoosiers. Milan beat Giant Muncie Central 32-30 in the final seconds of the game.""Although Hoosiers may differ somewhat from what really happened in 1954, so what? Both the film's story and the Milan team's season affirm the same values which now seem so rare 50 years after Bobby Gene Plump's winning shot.Question: Why are no SPECIAL (rather than cheesy)  Features provided with the DVD version?

Gene Hackman was the best fit for the role as the coach.  He likes discipline and is honest and knows how to show people how to do things.  The movie has some of the most dramatic shots and the games that the Hoosiers played were exciting.  This is based on a real story which just makes a person want to buy it or see it even more.  There is one guy in this movie that is always drunk and is the father of one of the players on the team.  Gene helps him a litttle and makes him assistant coach and then in one of the games he gets thrown out of the game for arguing.  He does this so the drunk assistant can try to win the game by himself.  What a great idea for a scene in the movie.  The last game fininshes it off by one of the Hoosiers shooting the ball to win the game.  It goes in at the buzzard with no seconds left and they win the championship in dramatic fashion.  That was a huge shot.  Being a fan of basketball and playing it I really got inspiration from it.  It sure did take a while for it to come out with two discs.  oh well it's here now.

Even though I've heard a few fellow Hoosiers gripe about the film not being more true to the actual facts, to me, it's one of the top three or four movies I've ever seen, and captures perfectly the atmosphere of our state, circa 1950s.For instance, the scenes in the Hickory gym are just how it was in those crackerboxes where we had Hoosier Hysteria in those days. The screenplay captures the Hoosier way of talking well, too. Not the accents, so much, as the fact that people from Indiana tend to be a little laconic -- to not waste too many words. Our next door neighbors in Kentucky, on the other hand, are famous as gabbers and storytellers.Look at some of the family names, also: Fleenor, Chitwood, Butcher, and the like. I've known real Hoosiers by those names.The kids who portray the Huskers are the best basketball players I've ever seen acting in a movie. They've actually ""played the game"" before -- you can tell.Usually not mentioned, but a key element, is the musical score. It fits the theme so well -- especially at the end. Notice that after Coach Norman Dale says, ""OK, let's go,"" just before Chitwood's winning basket, the only spoken words for the rest of the movie come from the disembodied voice of Dale, much later, as a lone kid shoots hoops in the Hickory gym. As the camera shows the photo of the state championship Huskers, Dale can be heard repeating what he said in the locker room before the big game: ""I love you guys.""The music filled in on the sound track in place of dialogue during the last seconds before victory -- and it was perfect.",5,A true Indiana tale,1169856000,"01 27, 2007",2007,1735,"['based', '1954', 'Miracle', 'Milan', 'think', 'name', 'anything', 'do', 'Italy', 'Catholic', 'Church', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'not', 'Hoosier', 'Even', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'few', 'fellow', 'Hoosiers', 'gripe', 'film', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'true', 'actual', 'facts', 'one', 'top', 'three', 'four', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'perfectly', 'atmosphere', 'state', 'circa', '1950s.For', 'instance', 'scenes', 'Hickory', 'gym', 'are', 'just', 'how', 'was', 'crackerboxes', 'where', 'had', 'Hoosier', 'Hysteria', 'days', 'screenplay', 'Hoosier', 'way', 'talking', 'well', 'too', 'Not', 'accents', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'people', 'Indiana', 'tend', 'be', 'little', 'laconic', 'not', 'waste', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'next', 'door', 'neighbors', 'Kentucky', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'famous', 'gabbers', 'storytellers.Look', 'family', 'names', 'also', 'Fleenor', 'Chitwood', 'Butcher', 'like', ""'ve"", 'known', 'real', 'Hoosiers', 'names.The', 'kids', 'who', 'portray', 'Huskers', 'are', 'best', 'basketball', 'players', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'played', 'game', 'before', 'can', 'tell.Usually', 'not', 'mentioned', 'key', 'element', 'musical', 'score', 'theme', 'so', 'well', 'especially', 'end', 'Notice', 'Coach', 'Norman', 'Dale', 'OK', 'let', 'go', 'just', 'Chitwood', 'winning', 'basket', 'only', 'spoken', 'words', 'rest', 'movie', 'come', 'disembodied', 'voice', 'Dale', 'much', 'later', 'lone', 'kid', 'shoots', 'hoops', 'Hickory', 'gym', 'camera', 'photo', 'state', 'championship', 'Huskers', 'Dale', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'repeating', 'what', 'said', 'locker', 'room', 'big', 'game', 'love', 'guys', 'music', 'filled', 'sound', 'track', 'place', 'dialogue', 'last', 'seconds', 'victory', 'was', 'perfect']",N/A
