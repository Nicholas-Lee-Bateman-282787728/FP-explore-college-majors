498288,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00000F4EO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 8]","I have to admit that the name of John Wycliffe was no more than vaguely familiar to me before watching this film - this is unfortunate because here is a man who deserves to be honored in the hearts of all English-speaking Christians. Dubbed &quot;the morning star of the Reformation,&quot; Wycliffe attacked the corruption of the mother church with great courage and spiritual determination - and he did this in the 14th century, well over a century before Martin Luther and others ushered in the Protestant Reformation. The life of this religious scholar and champion of the common people is a truly inspiring one. Wycliffe, born in 1324, died in 1384 but his guiding spirit still lives and thrives today.The church feared and despised Wycliffe. From his academic post at Oxford University, Wycliffe penned a number of controversial books criticizing or condemning church doctrines, developed a set of scholars among his students and sent them out to spread the true word of God, and truly brought the word of God to the people. The church put him on trial on three different occasions for heresy (the third taking place while he was on his death bed), but important supporters such as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and the Queen Mother helped him maintain his position and continue his work in the critical years of his life and career.This was a dramatic period in history. The Black Plague was still a fresh memory across the land, the Hundred Years War was exhausting the country's resources (the English peasants saw their suffering increase year after year and staged a failed revolt in 1831 - the church saw the rebellion as a consequence of Wycliffe's dangerous teachings), a child sat on the throne of England, and - during Wycliffe's most productive years - the Catholic Church itself was split along geopolitical lines, with one pope in Rome and a rival pope in Avignon. This film basically starts out with the second of Wycliffe's trials, and the corruption and greed of the church is clearly shown in the words and deeds of Wycliffe's opponents. Wycliffe railed against such corrupt practices as the issuance of indulgences, insisting that salvation could not be bought. He criticized the church for hoarding its great wealth (it owned a third of the land in England) and ignoring the increasingly destitute lives of the people. His greatest heresy came later, however, when he felt God's call to translate the Bible into the English language and thus give the people access to God's Holy word. It seems unbelievable today, but the church regarded the translation of the Bible into the &quot;vulgar&quot; tongue and its presentation to the people as the greatest heresy of all. The Church zealously guarded the Bible as its own property, believing the ecclesiastical order alone capable of understanding the word of God. Despite the persecution he faced, Wycliffe and a number of his former students completed the translation and defied the church by taking it to the people. In short, Wycliffe's work did much to help set the stage for the Reformation of the 16th century, particularly in England.This is an excellent video, and Peter Howell gives an impassioned yet beautifully subtle performance as John Wycliffe. I am not sure how closely the movie follows the actual timeline of the great man's life, however, as the character in the film looks much older than the historical figure who lived only sixty years and the bulk of Wycliffe's achievements seems to be densely packed into a short period of time. Still, Wycliffe's greatness, commitment to God, and undaunted courage shine throughout the 75 minutes of the film. This is a marvelous, truly inspirational film, and Christians in particular will get something much more worthwhile than entertainment value out of it.",5,The inspirational story of a truly great man of God,1091145600,"07 30, 2004",2004,3795,"['have', 'admit', 'name', 'John', 'Wycliffe', 'was', 'more', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'watching', 'film', 'unfortunate', 'here', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'honored', 'hearts', 'English-speaking', 'Christians', 'Dubbed', 'quot', 'morning', 'star', 'Reformation', 'quot', 'Wycliffe', 'attacked', 'corruption', 'mother', 'church', 'great', 'courage', 'spiritual', 'determination', 'did', '14th', 'century', 'well', 'century', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'others', 'ushered', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'life', 'religious', 'scholar', 'champion', 'common', 'people', 'truly', 'inspiring', 'one', 'Wycliffe', 'born', '1324', 'died', '1384', 'guiding', 'spirit', 'still', 'today.The', 'church', 'feared', 'despised', 'Wycliffe', 'academic', 'post', 'Oxford', 'University', 'Wycliffe', 'penned', 'number', 'controversial', 'books', 'criticizing', 'condemning', 'church', 'doctrines', 'developed', 'set', 'scholars', 'students', 'sent', 'out', 'spread', 'true', 'word', 'God', 'truly', 'brought', 'word', 'God', 'people', 'church', 'put', 'trial', 'three', 'different', 'occasions', 'heresy', 'third', 'taking', 'place', 'was', 'death', 'bed', 'important', 'supporters', 'such', 'John', 'Gaunt', 'Duke', 'Lancaster', 'Queen', 'Mother', 'helped', 'maintain', 'position', 'continue', 'work', 'critical', 'years', 'life', 'career.This', 'was', 'dramatic', 'period', 'history', 'Black', 'Plague', 'was', 'still', 'fresh', 'memory', 'land', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'was', 'exhausting', 'country', 'resources', 'English', 'peasants', 'saw', 'suffering', 'increase', 'year', 'year', 'staged', 'failed', 'revolt', '1831', 'church', 'saw', 'rebellion', 'consequence', 'Wycliffe', 'dangerous', 'teachings', 'child', 'sat', 'throne', 'England', 'Wycliffe', 'most', 'productive', 'years', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'was', 'split', 'along', 'geopolitical', 'lines', 'one', 'pope', 'Rome', 'rival', 'pope', 'Avignon', 'film', 'basically', 'out', 'second', 'Wycliffe', 'trials', 'corruption', 'greed', 'church', 'clearly', 'shown', 'words', 'deeds', 'Wycliffe', 'opponents', 'Wycliffe', 'railed', 'such', 'corrupt', 'practices', 'issuance', 'indulgences', 'insisting', 'salvation', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bought', 'criticized', 'church', 'hoarding', 'great', 'wealth', 'owned', 'third', 'land', 'England', 'ignoring', 'increasingly', 'destitute', 'lives', 'people', 'greatest', 'heresy', 'came', 'later', 'however', 'when', 'felt', 'God', 'call', 'translate', 'Bible', 'English', 'language', 'thus', 'give', 'people', 'access', 'God', 'Holy', 'word', 'unbelievable', 'today', 'church', 'regarded', 'translation', 'Bible', 'quot', 'quot', 'tongue', 'presentation', 'people', 'greatest', 'heresy', 'Church', 'zealously', 'guarded', 'Bible', 'own', 'property', 'believing', 'ecclesiastical', 'order', 'alone', 'capable', 'understanding', 'word', 'God', 'persecution', 'faced', 'Wycliffe', 'number', 'former', 'students', 'completed', 'translation', 'defied', 'church', 'taking', 'people', 'short', 'Wycliffe', 'work', 'did', 'much', 'help', 'set', 'stage', 'Reformation', '16th', 'century', 'particularly', 'England.This', 'excellent', 'video', 'Peter', 'Howell', 'impassioned', 'yet', 'beautifully', 'subtle', 'performance', 'John', 'Wycliffe', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'actual', 'timeline', 'great', 'man', 'life', 'however', 'character', 'film', 'much', 'older', 'historical', 'figure', 'who', 'lived', 'only', 'sixty', 'years', 'bulk', 'Wycliffe', 'achievements', 'be', 'densely', 'packed', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'Still', 'Wycliffe', 'greatness', 'commitment', 'God', 'undaunted', 'courage', 'shine', '75', 'minutes', 'film', 'marvelous', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'film', 'Christians', 'particular', 'will', 'get', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'entertainment', 'value']",John Wycliffe: The Morning Star VHS

498291,A3P2ROVW7YWQGJ,B00000F4EO,Encompassed Runner,"[31, 32]","JOHN WYCLIFFE is the first in Vision Video's Reformation series that includes John Hus, The Radicals: The Anabaptists, Martin Luther, and God's Otlaw: William Tyndale.  The movie begins with written paragraphs of contextual background that scroll much too fast to read, but say that it's England in the 14th century, 1/3 of Europe's dead from the Black Death, resources are drained due to the 100 Year War, the suffering peasants are restless, and the powerful Church has departed from the Bible in both doctrine and practice.  Then the drama begins (and it is a drama, not a documentary), with Wyclif's bones being dug up for posthumous burning as a boy looks on with his father, John Purvey, through whom the Wyclif story is told in flashback as Purvey recounts Wyclif's life to his son.  (Purvey was a former student of Wyclif's at Oxford and later worked with Wyclif on the Bible translation, but under persecution recanted of his involvement.)Unlike other reformers who had to flee, Wyclif (or Wycliffe) remained in his home country, though exiled from Oxford, so this story doesn't have some of the dramatic adrenaline rush scenes that other Reformation movies have.  Rather, the movie's strength is in its historically faithful representation of a compassionate, bold and brilliant pioneer of the Reformation who challenged Church doctrine and practice some 130 years before Luther.  His influence spread beyond England as his return-to-the-Bible ideas were taken by followers to Bohemia inspiring John (Jan) Huss, who was martyred upon order of the Council of Constance meeting some 30 years after Wyclif's natural death and which also ordered Wyclif's bones dug up and burned.  His advocacy of an English Bible for the average person was foundational in motivating and setting the stage for the English Bible dramas that ensued in the next 2 centuries, with Tyndale's Bible smuggling and martyrdom, the Geneva Bible popularity, the KJV, etc.The movie's lead actor, Peter Howell, gives a fine, believable performance as Wyclif, and even resembles in appearance the woodcut prints of the reformer.  Another important movie character is a fancily-dressed man, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster who pops up repeatedly and was actually the son of King Edward III, and for this reason was influential in protecting Wyclif somewhat--at least until Wyclif moved from early criticisms of the Church to more specific and extreme calls for reform, such as stating that the doctrine of transubstantiation (that the eucharist is Christ) was a later unbiblical doctrine added by the Church.The movie emphasizes Wyclif's heart for the poor and his high view of both the authority and power of the Bible that led him and his followers to translate the Bible (from Latin into average man English)during Wyclif's blessing-in-disguise banishment from Oxford.  The Word was then disseminated through Wyclif's itinerant poor preachers.  The movie, educational and inspiring as it is, probably would be too long and boring for most children's attention spans, although there is a brief summary of Wyclif that is included as a Special Feature of the DVD.",4,"Historically Faithful Account of Scholar, Preacher, Defender of the Poor, and RADICAL!....",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,3139,"['JOHN', 'WYCLIFFE', 'first', 'Vision', 'Video', 'Reformation', 'series', 'John', 'Hus', 'Radicals', 'Anabaptists', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'God', 'Otlaw', 'William', 'Tyndale', 'movie', 'written', 'paragraphs', 'contextual', 'background', 'scroll', 'much', 'too', 'fast', 'read', 'say', 'England', '14th', 'century', '1/3', 'Europe', 'dead', 'Black', 'Death', 'resources', 'are', 'drained', 'due', '100', 'Year', 'War', 'suffering', 'peasants', 'are', 'restless', 'powerful', 'Church', 'departed', 'Bible', 'doctrine', 'practice', 'Then', 'drama', 'drama', 'not', 'documentary', 'Wyclif', 'bones', 'being', 'dug', 'up', 'posthumous', 'burning', 'boy', 'father', 'John', 'Purvey', 'whom', 'Wyclif', 'story', 'told', 'flashback', 'Purvey', 'Wyclif', 'life', 'son', 'Purvey', 'was', 'former', 'student', 'Wyclif', 'Oxford', 'later', 'worked', 'Wyclif', 'Bible', 'translation', 'persecution', 'recanted', 'involvement', 'other', 'reformers', 'who', 'had', 'flee', 'Wyclif', 'Wycliffe', 'remained', 'home', 'country', 'though', 'exiled', 'Oxford', 'story', ""n't"", 'have', 'dramatic', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'scenes', 'other', 'Reformation', 'movies', 'have', 'Rather', 'movie', 'strength', 'historically', 'faithful', 'representation', 'compassionate', 'bold', 'brilliant', 'pioneer', 'Reformation', 'who', 'challenged', 'Church', 'doctrine', 'practice', '130', 'years', 'Luther', 'influence', 'spread', 'England', 'return-to-the-Bible', 'ideas', 'were', 'taken', 'followers', 'Bohemia', 'inspiring', 'John', 'Jan', 'Huss', 'who', 'was', 'martyred', 'order', 'Council', 'Constance', 'meeting', '30', 'years', 'Wyclif', 'natural', 'death', 'also', 'ordered', 'Wyclif', 'bones', 'dug', 'up', 'burned', 'advocacy', 'English', 'Bible', 'average', 'person', 'was', 'foundational', 'motivating', 'setting', 'stage', 'English', 'Bible', 'dramas', 'ensued', 'next', '2', 'centuries', 'Tyndale', 'Bible', 'smuggling', 'martyrdom', 'Geneva', 'Bible', 'popularity', 'KJV', 'movie', 'lead', 'actor', 'Peter', 'Howell', 'fine', 'believable', 'performance', 'Wyclif', 'even', 'resembles', 'appearance', 'woodcut', 'prints', 'reformer', 'important', 'movie', 'character', 'fancily-dressed', 'man', 'John', 'Gaunt', 'Duke', 'Lancaster', 'who', 'up', 'repeatedly', 'was', 'actually', 'son', 'King', 'Edward', 'III', 'reason', 'was', 'influential', 'protecting', 'Wyclif', 'somewhat', 'least', 'Wyclif', 'moved', 'early', 'criticisms', 'Church', 'more', 'specific', 'extreme', 'calls', 'reform', 'such', 'stating', 'doctrine', 'transubstantiation', 'eucharist', 'Christ', 'was', 'later', 'unbiblical', 'doctrine', 'added', 'Church.The', 'movie', 'Wyclif', 'heart', 'poor', 'high', 'view', 'authority', 'power', 'Bible', 'led', 'followers', 'translate', 'Bible', 'Latin', 'average', 'man', 'English', 'Wyclif', 'blessing-in-disguise', 'banishment', 'Oxford', 'Word', 'was', 'then', 'disseminated', 'Wyclif', 'itinerant', 'poor', 'preachers', 'movie', 'educational', 'inspiring', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'boring', 'most', 'children', 'attention', 'spans', 'brief', 'summary', 'Wyclif', 'included', 'Special', 'Feature', 'DVD']",John Wycliffe: The Morning Star VHS

Each scene is well done, and there is a nice flow of sequence.  The acting is not overdone, but very good.
