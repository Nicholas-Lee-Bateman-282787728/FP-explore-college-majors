Not for the hardcore bodybuilder, obviously... But if you want to develop stamina, strength, tone up and lose those extra pounds, 8 minutes a day is the way to go.  Sure the video is dated 80's style ... but who cares, your working out right?One tip for those doing the exercises (especially the abs), it is easy to cheat, so if you doing the workout and you dont feel the burn, try harder to isolate the muscle  and go slower, then you'll surely feel it!!Best Wishes and Good Luck!!!",5,GREAT FOR TONING UP!!,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,580,"['have', 'been', 'using', 'videos', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'alway', 'had', 'great', 'results', 'Not', 'hardcore', 'bodybuilder', 'obviously', 'want', 'develop', 'stamina', 'strength', 'tone', 'up', 'lose', 'extra', 'pounds', '8', 'minutes', 'day', 'way', 'go', 'Sure', 'video', 'dated', '80', 'style', 'who', 'working', 'out', 'right', 'One', 'tip', 'doing', 'exercises', 'especially', 'abs', 'easy', 'cheat', 'so', 'doing', 'workout', 'dont', 'feel', 'burn', 'try', 'harder', 'isolate', 'muscle', 'go', 'slower', 'then', ""'ll"", 'surely', 'feel', 'Best', 'Wishes', 'Good', 'Luck']",8 Minute Fitness: (Abs / Buns / Arms / Legs)

738887,A19N6E6NFH4L9D,B00008DDTJ,"Mark Carter ""hawnyawk""","[4, 4]","I got this thinking it had extra programs (maybe even bloopers).  After all, most anniversary editions contain extra content, that's why the price is so high.  But no, this is just the same old DVD, and you still have to flip the DVD over to do all the workouts (there is really not alot of video here, so I don't know why they can't put it on one side). If you can find the original DVD, get that, it's the same thing.I gave this 3 stars because of the high price and no new content.  The workouts get 5 stars.  I did the buns workout as a joke, and when I was done I felt like I ran 10 miles (and sweated like it too), from then on I was hooked.  The arms workout is the best, get any fitness book and they will have you doing the same thing.  Of course, the famous abs workout is a killer, but when your done, you feel satisfied in completing something. The legs workout, well, not so great, it's difficult to work isometrics with the legs, since they are so strong.Overall, if this is the only DVD you can find, get it.  But look around first.",3,"Same as the old DVD, just different box.",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1047,"['got', 'thinking', 'had', 'extra', 'programs', 'maybe', 'even', 'bloopers', 'most', 'anniversary', 'editions', 'contain', 'extra', 'content', 'why', 'price', 'so', 'high', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'DVD', 'still', 'have', 'flip', 'DVD', 'do', 'workouts', 'really', 'not', 'alot', 'video', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'one', 'side', 'can', 'find', 'original', 'DVD', 'get', 'same', 'thing.I', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'high', 'price', 'new', 'content', 'workouts', 'get', '5', 'stars', 'did', 'buns', 'workout', 'joke', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'felt', 'ran', '10', 'miles', 'sweated', 'too', 'then', 'was', 'hooked', 'arms', 'workout', 'best', 'get', 'fitness', 'book', 'will', 'have', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'course', 'famous', 'abs', 'workout', 'killer', 'when', 'done', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'completing', 'something', 'legs', 'workout', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'difficult', 'work', 'isometrics', 'legs', 'are', 'so', 'strong.Overall', 'only', 'DVD', 'can', 'find', 'get', 'look', 'first']",8 Minute Fitness: (Abs / Buns / Arms / Legs)

Usually they're cheesy and after you watch them you realize you could have done the exercises on your own.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 8-Minute Fitness program was VERY instructional and REALLY gives you a good, intense yet brief workout.I actually bought this for my wife and daughter, but I ended up doing it and I enjoy it more than they do!  You will definitely work your body without devoting a lot of time.  Too early to see any results yet, but it sure FEELS like it's doing the trick.As in most workout videos, the leader is a little TOO perky and the program seems a little dated, but if you can overlook that, I would definitely recommend it.",4,Get Ready To Sweat!,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,728,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'am', 'NOT', 'fan', 'exercise', 'videos', 'Usually', ""'re"", 'cheesy', 'watch', 'realize', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'exercises', 'own', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', '8-Minute', 'Fitness', 'program', 'was', 'VERY', 'instructional', 'REALLY', 'good', 'intense', 'yet', 'brief', 'workout.I', 'actually', 'bought', 'wife', 'daughter', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'enjoy', 'more', 'do', 'will', 'definitely', 'work', 'body', 'devoting', 'lot', 'time', 'Too', 'early', 'see', 'results', 'yet', 'sure', 'FEELS', 'doing', 'trick.As', 'most', 'workout', 'videos', 'leader', 'little', 'TOO', 'perky', 'program', 'little', 'dated', 'can', 'overlook', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend']",8 Minute Fitness: (Abs / Buns / Arms / Legs)

Unfortunately, my little son scratched them and now I have to order more. They are hands down the best workouts out there each only 8 minutes long and each targeting different areas of the body. I can't say enough good about them. You'll definitely feel the burn. Used in conjunction with a cardio workout you won't need anything more (unless you want to body build). You can up the weights or use canned foods.
