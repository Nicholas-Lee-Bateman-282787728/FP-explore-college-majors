907733,A2UQKHJOTE0UW1,B0009KA7XG,MarsTwain,"[2, 3]","I hate to give any movie one star but this one deserves it. Even brief moments of real acting couldn't save it.Wow. With Jeremy Renner and Seamus Dever, this should've been fantastic.  It's not. The lead is a female character so shallow and stupid and melodramatic that I can't even tell if the actress was any good. She's utterly forgettable and completely insulting to women as a character. Seamus Dever's character is a cartoon as well and while he fares slightly better than Amy Stewart, maybe because Dever can invest thinly written characters with real life (see his work in Castle), it's still far less than an actual person. Because the people don't seem even faintly plausible, all the interaction is preposterous and not amusing or goofy enough to be engaging except for a scene between Renner and Dever where both display actual emotions and one scene with Amy Stewart and Renner where again, emotions seem real and as such, totally out of place in this film. Oh and there's one hot sex scene with Renner and Stewart that's very short and probably why people are renting this. The lead's plans and theories are annoying and selfish--I think it's meant to be funny and quirky but she's mostly just a reprehensible totally self-centered bitch. Everything she says sounds like it was written by a man, most especially the voice over which is supposed to let us inside her head. Um, guys? Women don't think like this. She has double standards, expects men to read her mind (okay some women are like that) and flip-flops so often and is so manipulative and self-serving, but without focus or pattern that she makes no sense as a human. All this is also set within a script that's trying so hard to be brainy and cute (and the lines get worse and worse as the movie goes on with the final denouement being the absolute worst melodramatic tripe I've heard in years) that it is nearly impossible to care about anyone, especially the lead, who is unlikeable and totally insensitive to everyone around her. The boys are written at a high school level despite the age of the actors, the video filming technique is steady and clean but very immediate and feels amateur because of it. The lead's motivations are slutty, self-serving, misguided and so artificial that even as a cartoon character it feels forced and the only chemistry is between the men as friends. It's a terrible waste of Dever and Renner, two excellent actors. I can't say about Amy Stewart because she had next to nothing good to do here. Overall, just a big hunk of soap-opera-colored,ultimately very stupid garbage. Too bad.Oh yeah--and the conclusion is broadcast so early on that there isn't any real interest in watching the plot spool out. I think the writers knew this because they tossed in a whole slew of random, ridiculous stuff using side characters toward the end. None of it had anything valid to say to the plot or characters and didn't help the overall film in the least.",1,Lead character is a disservice to women.,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2955,"['hate', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'one', 'Even', 'brief', 'moments', 'real', 'acting', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'it.Wow', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Seamus', 'Dever', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fantastic', 'not', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'so', 'shallow', 'stupid', 'melodramatic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'actress', 'was', 'good', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'completely', 'insulting', 'women', 'character', 'Seamus', 'Dever', 'character', 'cartoon', 'as', 'well', 'slightly', 'better', 'Amy', 'Stewart', 'maybe', 'Dever', 'can', 'invest', 'thinly', 'written', 'characters', 'real', 'life', 'see', 'work', 'Castle', 'still', 'far', 'less', 'actual', 'person', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'even', 'faintly', 'plausible', 'interaction', 'preposterous', 'not', 'amusing', 'goofy', 'enough', 'be', 'engaging', 'scene', 'Renner', 'Dever', 'where', 'display', 'actual', 'emotions', 'one', 'scene', 'Amy', 'Stewart', 'Renner', 'where', 'again', 'emotions', 'seem', 'real', 'such', 'totally', 'place', 'film', 'Oh', 'one', 'hot', 'sex', 'scene', 'Renner', 'Stewart', 'very', 'short', 'probably', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'renting', 'lead', 'plans', 'theories', 'are', 'annoying', 'selfish', 'think', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'quirky', 'mostly', 'just', 'reprehensible', 'totally', 'self-centered', 'bitch', 'Everything', 'sounds', 'was', 'written', 'man', 'most', 'especially', 'voice', 'supposed', 'let', 'inside', 'head', 'Um', 'guys', 'Women', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'double', 'standards', 'men', 'read', 'mind', 'women', 'are', 'flip-flops', 'so', 'often', 'so', 'manipulative', 'self-serving', 'focus', 'pattern', 'sense', 'human', 'also', 'set', 'script', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'brainy', 'cute', 'lines', 'get', 'worse', 'worse', 'movie', 'final', 'denouement', 'being', 'absolute', 'worst', 'melodramatic', 'tripe', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'care', 'anyone', 'especially', 'lead', 'who', 'unlikeable', 'totally', 'insensitive', 'everyone', 'boys', 'are', 'written', 'high', 'school', 'level', 'age', 'actors', 'video', 'filming', 'technique', 'steady', 'clean', 'very', 'immediate', 'feels', 'amateur', 'lead', 'motivations', 'are', 'slutty', 'self-serving', 'misguided', 'so', 'artificial', 'even', 'cartoon', 'character', 'forced', 'only', 'chemistry', 'men', 'friends', 'terrible', 'waste', 'Dever', 'Renner', 'two', 'excellent', 'actors', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Amy', 'Stewart', 'had', 'next', 'nothing', 'good', 'do', 'here', 'Overall', 'just', 'big', 'hunk', 'soap-opera-colored', 'ultimately', 'very', 'stupid', 'garbage', 'Too', 'bad.Oh', 'yeah', 'conclusion', 'broadcast', 'so', 'early', ""n't"", 'real', 'interest', 'watching', 'plot', 'spool', 'think', 'writers', 'knew', 'tossed', 'whole', 'slew', 'random', 'ridiculous', 'stuff', 'using', 'side', 'characters', 'end', 'None', 'had', 'anything', 'valid', 'say', 'plot', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'overall', 'film', 'least']",Monkey Love

907737,A2N8Y2OCAK8MR3,B0009KA7XG,Valerie Beiersdorfer,"[0, 0]","This was such a cute movie. It also was filmed like the way they film soap operas. It looked like you were really watching people in real time.  The movie is about 3 friends, two men and one woman, who have been friends since childhood. the woman thinks she's in a rut when it comes to meeting new men and trying to find a man who wants a serious relationship. Anyway, she thinks being friends with her two men pals is stopping her from finding real happiness. She decides since a lot of men dump women once they've slept with them, she decides to sleep with her two best pals and then break it off and say &#34;we can still be friends&#34;. This completes her life even more. Jeremy Renner is just so damn cute as her pal Dil, who's secretly been in love with her all his life. He is charming and sweet. Anyway, she sleeps with the other guy first, who falls in love with her, or so he thinks. Then she sleeps with Dil. Well, the sex is amazing and now Amy is in love with Dil. Anyway, what happens after that is funny and bittersweet. I love Jeremy Renner in all those action movies, but you can see he has a talent for funny and sweet love stories. I loved this movie and smiled a lot when I was watching it. I hated when it ended. It leaves you wanting more. I recommend it for all those romantics who know love isn't always a smooth ride, but in the end it's so worth it.",5,It also was filmed like the way they film soap operas,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,1376,"['was', 'such', 'cute', 'movie', 'also', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'film', 'soap', 'operas', 'looked', 'were', 'really', 'watching', 'people', 'real', 'time', 'movie', '3', 'friends', 'two', 'men', 'one', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'childhood', 'woman', 'rut', 'when', 'meeting', 'new', 'men', 'trying', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'serious', 'relationship', 'Anyway', 'being', 'friends', 'two', 'men', 'pals', 'stopping', 'finding', 'real', 'happiness', 'lot', 'men', 'dump', 'women', 'once', ""'ve"", 'slept', 'sleep', 'two', 'best', 'pals', 'then', 'break', 'off', 'say', '34', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'friends', '34', 'life', 'even', 'more', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'just', 'so', 'damn', 'cute', 'pal', 'Dil', 'who', 'secretly', 'been', 'love', 'life', 'charming', 'sweet', 'Anyway', 'other', 'guy', 'first', 'who', 'love', 'so', 'Then', 'Dil', 'Well', 'sex', 'amazing', 'now', 'Amy', 'love', 'Dil', 'Anyway', 'what', 'funny', 'bittersweet', 'love', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'action', 'movies', 'can', 'see', 'talent', 'funny', 'sweet', 'love', 'stories', 'loved', 'movie', 'smiled', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'hated', 'when', 'ended', 'wanting', 'more', 'recommend', 'romantics', 'who', 'know', 'love', ""n't"", 'always', 'smooth', 'ride', 'end', 'so', 'worth']",Monkey Love
