293454,A15G57AIKJ5PRQ,6302041406,"A. C. Walter ""awalter""","[64, 64]","This is minimalist filmed version of a play originally directed for the stage by Judi Dench.  In my opinion, it's also Kenneth Branagh's finest screen performance.  For a full two hours, he is Jimmy Porter, the man you  want to hate but can't help but love.  He's one of the educated lower  class, burdened by ego and unfulfilled potential.  He's an urban lion with  a huge heart and claws that constantly torture those around him, namely his  wife (Emma Thompson).These characters are so real, you'll dream about  them afterward, and if you give it a chance, this film will work its way  into your heart and teach you something about life.",5,"An exhausting, cathartic emotional experience.",947808000,"01 14, 2000",2000,640,"['minimalist', 'filmed', 'version', 'play', 'originally', 'directed', 'stage', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'opinion', 'also', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'finest', 'screen', 'performance', 'full', 'two', 'hours', 'Jimmy', 'Porter', 'man', 'want', 'hate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'one', 'educated', 'lower', 'class', 'burdened', 'ego', 'unfulfilled', 'potential', 'urban', 'lion', 'huge', 'heart', 'claws', 'constantly', 'torture', 'namely', 'wife', 'Emma', 'Thompson', '.These', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'real', ""'ll"", 'dream', 'afterward', 'give', 'chance', 'film', 'will', 'work', 'way', 'heart', 'teach', 'something', 'life']",N/A
293455,A2R60DUF9N2KKK,6302041406,Harry O,"[2, 2]","This is a fine production of John Osborne's ground-breaking play. One can only imagine the impact this play had on British audiences when it first opened in 1956. These were audiences used to the drawing room comedies of Noel Coward and the drawing room dramas of Terrence Rattigan, and now they were being confronted with emotional rawness and realism that had rarely before been seen on the stage. It is no exaggeration to say that this play revolutionized the British theater, and it is as important to evaluate the play in its historical context as it is in the context of how well it holds up 50 years later. I believe it succeeds on both counts. Kenneth Branagh is superb in the no-holds-barred lead role, the first of Britain's ""angry young men."" While the rest of the cast (including Emma Thompson) supports him well, Branagh is the whole show - the success of the production rests on how the viewer reacts to his performance.",4,Remake Of An  Important British Classic,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,934,"['fine', 'production', 'John', 'Osborne', 'ground-breaking', 'play', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'impact', 'play', 'had', 'British', 'audiences', 'when', 'first', 'opened', '1956', 'were', 'audiences', 'used', 'drawing', 'room', 'comedies', 'Noel', 'Coward', 'drawing', 'room', 'dramas', 'Terrence', 'Rattigan', 'now', 'were', 'being', 'confronted', 'emotional', 'rawness', 'realism', 'had', 'rarely', 'been', 'seen', 'stage', 'exaggeration', 'say', 'play', 'revolutionized', 'British', 'theater', 'as', 'important', 'evaluate', 'play', 'historical', 'context', 'context', 'how', 'well', '50', 'years', 'later', 'believe', 'counts', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'superb', 'no-holds-barred', 'lead', 'role', 'first', 'Britain', 'angry', 'young', 'men', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'well', 'Branagh', 'whole', 'show', 'success', 'production', 'how', 'viewer', 'performance']",N/A
293456,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,6302041406,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[7, 8]","This is tough to review. The problem is that the cast is far better than the material they are given. The question is does the quality of the performance fix the basic problems of the play. I don't think it does.John Osborne's play had some shock value in the 1950s. But the question, decades later, is if there is any deeper meaning than shock value which has gone cold. The core of the play is watching domestic abuse play out. We have a whining, self-pitying man taking out all his frustrations through abuse of his doormat wife.The play is often described as being about class, but the only class aspect to it is that the wife comes from a better family. But I kind of got the impression that whatever her background, Jimmy would have treated her the same. The class difference seems not much more than another means for Jimmy to abuse her and cut her off from former friends and family.Its difficult play to know what to do with. Because any political motives grafted on to Jimmy end up looking like the old excuses made for every loudmouth wifebeater. All Jimmy is missing is the alcoholism.Branagh and Thompson do well with what they are given. But by the nature of the role, Thompson is of ocurse underutilized. Branagh's natural charisma almost makes Jimmy somewhat likeable. But given who and what Jimmy is, I don't know that its a good thing. Gerard Horan is also good as Cliff. The acting overall is at a whole different level than the Richard Burton film version from years ago.The material is not really a film. Its like a filming of the stage play. Some people will like that, others may not.All-in-all, this is the finest version available of a terribly flawed play. The actors are far above the material but they still can't really save it from its basic flaws.",2,Good Actors in a bad play,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,1778,"['tough', 'review', 'problem', 'cast', 'far', 'better', 'material', 'are', 'given', 'question', 'quality', 'performance', 'fix', 'basic', 'problems', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Osborne', 'play', 'had', 'shock', 'value', '1950s', 'question', 'decades', 'later', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'shock', 'value', 'gone', 'cold', 'core', 'play', 'watching', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'play', 'out', 'have', 'whining', 'self-pitying', 'man', 'taking', 'out', 'frustrations', 'abuse', 'doormat', 'wife.The', 'play', 'often', 'described', 'being', 'class', 'only', 'class', 'aspect', 'wife', 'better', 'family', 'kind', 'got', 'impression', 'background', 'Jimmy', 'would', 'have', 'treated', 'same', 'class', 'difference', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'means', 'Jimmy', 'abuse', 'cut', 'off', 'former', 'friends', 'family.Its', 'difficult', 'play', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'political', 'motives', 'grafted', 'Jimmy', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'old', 'excuses', 'made', 'loudmouth', 'wifebeater', 'Jimmy', 'missing', 'alcoholism.Branagh', 'Thompson', 'do', 'well', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'nature', 'role', 'Thompson', 'ocurse', 'underutilized', 'Branagh', 'natural', 'charisma', 'almost', 'Jimmy', 'somewhat', 'likeable', 'given', 'who', 'what', 'Jimmy', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'Gerard', 'Horan', 'also', 'good', 'Cliff', 'acting', 'overall', 'whole', 'different', 'level', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'film', 'version', 'years', 'ago.The', 'material', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'filming', 'stage', 'play', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'others', 'may', 'not.All-in-all', 'finest', 'version', 'available', 'terribly', 'flawed', 'play', 'actors', 'are', 'far', 'material', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'save', 'basic', 'flaws']",N/A
293457,A2VK365XEVCYC8,6302041406,One More Option,"[20, 20]","This movie is for anyone who didn't handle their past relationships perfectly and who wants to understand they are not alone in the mistakes they made.I agree with another reviewer - this is my favorite Kenneth Brannagh performance.  I've enjoyed him in other things, but I usually find myself looking at the screen and thinking, ""Hey, there's charismatic Kenneth Branagh doing a charismatic acting performance.""  But his charisma is well placed in this part, playing Jimmy Porter, a man whose ideas are larger than his station, who is overwrought with the limitations of his era.Jimmy:  ""They all want to escape from the pain of being alive, and most of all from love . . . It's no good trying to fool yourself about love, you can't fall into it like a soft job without dirtying up your hands.  It takes muscle and guts.  And if you can't bare the thought of messing up your nice, clean soul . . . then you'd better . . . become a saint, because you'll never make it as a human being.  It's either this world or the next.""I don't know if the title of the play is ironic, sarcastic, tragic or literal - probably all four and more.Jimmy:  ""You made a good enemy, didn't you?  What they call a worthy opponent.""Alison:  ""I love you.""Alison:  ""You know, I keep looking back as far as I can remember, and I can't remember what it was to feel young . . . really young.""I titled this review ""This Just In"" because I feel kind of silly reviewing a movie that came out 17 years ago.  But I recommend it because Judy Dench's choice to film the movie like a stage play was exceptional.  A point of this play is to look at human relations in the confines of a small living space, small social circle, and British social constructs.  And watching the characters, we see how difficult each conversational reply is because everyone in the room knows so much about each other's past.  Their small space becomes even more difficult to move in, as they avoid the land mines, slip between the elephants, and struggle with eye contact.  Yet despite the constant hardship, love survives.Please comment, express feedback, or suggest related works or plays.",4,This Just In . . .,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2135,"['movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'handle', 'past', 'relationships', 'perfectly', 'who', 'understand', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'mistakes', 'made.I', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'favorite', 'Kenneth', 'Brannagh', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'other', 'things', 'usually', 'find', 'looking', 'screen', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'charismatic', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'doing', 'charismatic', 'acting', 'performance', 'charisma', 'well', 'placed', 'part', 'playing', 'Jimmy', 'Porter', 'man', 'ideas', 'are', 'larger', 'station', 'who', 'overwrought', 'limitations', 'era.Jimmy', 'want', 'escape', 'pain', 'being', 'alive', 'most', 'love', 'good', 'trying', 'fool', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fall', 'soft', 'job', 'dirtying', 'up', 'hands', 'muscle', 'guts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bare', 'thought', 'messing', 'up', 'nice', 'clean', 'soul', 'then', ""'d"", 'better', 'become', 'saint', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'human', 'being', 'world', 'next', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'title', 'play', 'ironic', 'sarcastic', 'tragic', 'literal', 'probably', 'four', 'more.Jimmy', 'made', 'good', 'enemy', 'did', ""n't"", 'What', 'call', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'Alison', 'love', 'Alison', 'know', 'keep', 'looking', 'back', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'feel', 'young', 'really', 'young', 'titled', 'review', 'Just', 'feel', 'kind', 'silly', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'came', 'out', '17', 'years', 'ago', 'recommend', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'choice', 'film', 'movie', 'stage', 'play', 'was', 'exceptional', 'point', 'play', 'look', 'human', 'relations', 'confines', 'small', 'living', 'space', 'small', 'social', 'circle', 'British', 'social', 'constructs', 'watching', 'characters', 'see', 'how', 'difficult', 'conversational', 'reply', 'everyone', 'room', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'past', 'small', 'space', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'move', 'avoid', 'land', 'mines', 'slip', 'elephants', 'struggle', 'eye', 'contact', 'constant', 'hardship', 'love', 'survives.Please', 'comment', 'express', 'feedback', 'suggest', 'related', 'works', 'plays']",N/A
