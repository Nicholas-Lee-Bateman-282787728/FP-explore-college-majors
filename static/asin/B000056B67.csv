A Slezak ""Incredulous Reader""","[1, 3]","This film was more of a documentary than it was a drama talking about the Trials at Nuremburg.First it started out with what they were trying to accomplish by having the trial.  The goals were set out that it wasn't just to seek revenge but was to hold people accountable for their actions.  The film tries to show some of the politics and adversaries among the allies during the trials.I felt the best part of the film was showing the dualality of the various personalities of the prisoners.  I wish it would have explained a little more in depth what each of these high profile Nazis had done to deserve their various fates.  For example I didn't understand why Rudolf Hess got so much time considering he was a prisoner of war most of the war and had not been involved in the final solution.  I'm sure he was part of their initial solution but I guess the time constraints of the film would not have allowed this.For a time in the film you are impressed by Gering until they show the films and you know what kind of a person this guy really was.The attraction between Baldwin and Hennessey was predictable, I guess to add more intrigue to the film.  You'll have to watch it to understand that part.In the end the psychologist tries to explain why these men had committed there various crimes and why it could have happened in Germany.

It was here that Hitler staged his magnificent rallies to inspire his ardent followers and convince everybody else to become ardent followers. It was in the city of Nuremberg that the first of many laws directed against Jews we issued.  It is most famous today as the city where the last drama of the third Reich was played out.  The triumphant allied powers chose this city for their trials of those nazi leaders who survived.  It was also the site of the executions for eleven of those leaders.I thought the book was forced to give short shrift to many of the topics the surround the trial. However for the ultimate in condensation the mini-series really barrels through too much too quickly. The movie spends far too much time on the `romantic' side story of Justice Jackson and his secretary (oh and the movie neglects to mention that Jackson's son was living in the house with him at this time).  I have no idea if such an affair took place, but I still think there was more than enough drama happening right out of the history to waste any time on such nonsense.The basic theme of the movie gets boiled down to the ""Jackson vs. Goring"" fight.  And that is too bad because in that case the good guys end up looking like ill-prepared schoolboys and the evil Nazi ends up looking like a peace-loving nationalist.  Also looking like a good guy is Speer, a man with loyalty no to no one but himself.I also thought it was a cop-out to have everybody speaking English in the courtroom, while this was a good deal easier on the viewer, it gave a vastly false impression of how `international' the international tribunal really was.  This might seem a minor point, but it isn't.  This was a ground breaking moment in the history of world diplomacy and jurisprudence and to gloss over the difficulties involved also causes the producers to gloss over the triumphs won.",3,Speed History.  tries to do too much !,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,1947,"['Nuremberg', 'city', 'Germany', 'past', 'intertwined', 'indelibly', 'Nazi', 'era', 'was', 'here', 'Hitler', 'staged', 'magnificent', 'rallies', 'inspire', 'ardent', 'followers', 'convince', 'everybody', 'else', 'become', 'ardent', 'followers', 'was', 'city', 'Nuremberg', 'first', 'many', 'laws', 'directed', 'Jews', 'issued', 'most', 'famous', 'today', 'city', 'where', 'last', 'drama', 'third', 'Reich', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'triumphant', 'allied', 'powers', 'chose', 'city', 'trials', 'nazi', 'leaders', 'who', 'survived', 'was', 'also', 'site', 'executions', 'eleven', 'leaders.I', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'forced', 'give', 'short', 'shrift', 'many', 'topics', 'surround', 'trial', 'However', 'ultimate', 'condensation', 'mini-series', 'really', 'barrels', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'romantic', 'side', 'story', 'Justice', 'Jackson', 'secretary', 'oh', 'movie', 'mention', 'Jackson', 'son', 'was', 'living', 'house', 'time', 'have', 'idea', 'such', 'affair', 'took', 'place', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'drama', 'happening', 'right', 'history', 'waste', 'time', 'such', 'nonsense.The', 'basic', 'theme', 'movie', 'boiled', 'down', 'Jackson', 'vs.', 'Goring', 'fight', 'too', 'bad', 'case', 'good', 'guys', 'end', 'up', 'looking', 'ill-prepared', 'schoolboys', 'evil', 'Nazi', 'up', 'looking', 'peace-loving', 'nationalist', 'Also', 'looking', 'good', 'guy', 'Speer', 'man', 'loyalty', 'one', 'himself.I', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'cop-out', 'have', 'everybody', 'speaking', 'English', 'courtroom', 'was', 'good', 'deal', 'easier', 'viewer', 'gave', 'vastly', 'false', 'impression', 'how', 'international', 'international', 'tribunal', 'really', 'was', 'might', 'seem', 'minor', 'point', ""n't"", 'was', 'ground', 'breaking', 'moment', 'history', 'world', 'diplomacy', 'jurisprudence', 'gloss', 'difficulties', 'involved', 'also', 'producers', 'gloss', 'triumphs', 'won']",N/A
568649,A2KSWHGL7NT5TW,B000056B67,Andrew D. Dixon Jr.,"[2, 2]","A great movie. I haven't seen the DVD yet, so this is more or less a review of the substance of the film. The most important thing in this movie is the portrayal of Herman Goring by Brian Cox. Many historians and documentaries (especially by the British) have attempted to make Goring out to be some sort of floundering Sgt. Schultz character like that of Hogan's Heros. Well the fact of the matter is the man was a cunning, shrewd and diabolical warrior and bureaucrat who should not have been underestimated. As mentioned in other reviews here, his twisted logic and mental gymnastics are impressive and, if not taken with care and analysis, almost believable. Frightening in its depth. I will be buying this DVD shortly. It's A portrait in the ultimate maxim of &quot;KNOW YOUR ENEMY.&quot; Many through the years have wondered how the people of Germany could have let these Nazis lead their nation down the path of destruction. The narcistic sociapathy portrayed in this film explains that better than most other WWII films. No special effects, no frills, sheer mental warfare. The portrayal of a concentration camp supervisor is also particularly chilling. Baldwin turns in one of his most intellectual performances of his career. This movie is on the level of &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; both the book by Albert Speer and the television mini-series featuring Derek Jacoby as Hitler. Nuremburg is a keeper and a critically important document in understanding the psychology of the managerial infrastructure of the Nazi regime.

568650,A79VTPK2N2KR3,B000056B67,Anthony,"[6, 6]","'Nuremberg', for a TV miniseries production, is a wonderful production. The movie recreates the court room setting and drama wonderfully, as well as the physical appearance of the defendants.However, I would like to make my observations concerning certain weaknesses of the film:-There is barely enough time of the film devoted to the actual court-room examinations and cross-examinations. Perhaps, this would have been feasible if there wasn't so much concentration on the inception, organisation and the buildup of the film.-What is the point of adding a hinted romance between the chief prosecutor and his assistant? Was it relevant in any way and did it help to keep our interest in the film? I think not.-Brian Cox plays the role of Goering absolutely wonderfully. The Nazi leader is not demonised, yet is shown for his aristocracy and great intellect, as well as his ability to sway his authority on other people. Watching the movie will surely help one understand why Goering became so influential and became Hitler's deputy.-There is too much concentration on the friendship developed between Lt. Tex Wheelis and Goering. There is still a looming conspiracy on the American Lieutenant's role partaking in Hitler's suicide, but there has been not one iota of evidence affirming his involvement, so why not-so-subtly imply it in the film?-The Russian staff were portrayed as seemingly ignorant, revengeful superficial characters, which is far from the truth. The movie managed not to stumble on older films' weaknesses; the demonization of the Nazis, yet does so with the Russians! The Cold War is over!-I understand that the development of all the defendants' cases would not have been feasible in a movie, yet some omissions are daunting! In the judges' rendering of sentences, they highlight the decision to acquit Hjalmar Schacht, certainly an important decisions with vast consequences. Yet, why was there no cross-examination of him throughout the movie, as he was described as the most eloquent of the defendants, surpassing even Albert Speer!-Language? Some of the defendants were known to speak English fluently throughout the trial, revealing often their aristocratic background (von Ribbentrop for example). Others did not, yet the distinction was not made at all in the movie, rather making the defendants speak English with very ludicrous accents.To conclude, 'Nuremberg' certainly is a great introduction to the trials themselves, but those with a bit more advanced knowledge on the issue, will remain unsatisfied.Overall, 'Judgment at Nuremberg' is the best movie available concerning the legal aspect of the trials, even though it does not touch upon the 'war criminals' but the Nazi judges.",3,A valiant effort,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2713,"[""'Nuremberg"", 'TV', 'miniseries', 'production', 'wonderful', 'production', 'movie', 'court', 'room', 'setting', 'drama', 'wonderfully', 'as', 'well', 'physical', 'appearance', 'defendants.However', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'observations', 'concerning', 'certain', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'barely', 'enough', 'time', 'film', 'devoted', 'actual', 'court-room', 'examinations', 'cross-examinations', 'Perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'feasible', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'concentration', 'inception', 'organisation', 'buildup', 'film.-What', 'point', 'adding', 'hinted', 'romance', 'chief', 'prosecutor', 'assistant', 'Was', 'relevant', 'way', 'did', 'help', 'keep', 'interest', 'film', 'think', 'not.-Brian', 'Cox', 'role', 'Goering', 'absolutely', 'wonderfully', 'Nazi', 'leader', 'not', 'demonised', 'shown', 'aristocracy', 'great', 'intellect', 'as', 'well', 'ability', 'sway', 'authority', 'other', 'people', 'Watching', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'help', 'one', 'understand', 'why', 'Goering', 'became', 'so', 'influential', 'became', 'Hitler', 'deputy.-There', 'too', 'much', 'concentration', 'friendship', 'developed', 'Lt.', 'Tex', 'Wheelis', 'Goering', 'still', 'looming', 'conspiracy', 'American', 'Lieutenant', 'role', 'partaking', 'Hitler', 'suicide', 'there', 'been', 'not', 'one', 'iota', 'evidence', 'affirming', 'involvement', 'so', 'why', 'not-so-subtly', 'imply', 'film', '-The', 'Russian', 'staff', 'were', 'portrayed', 'seemingly', 'ignorant', 'revengeful', 'superficial', 'characters', 'far', 'truth', 'movie', 'managed', 'not', 'stumble', 'older', 'films', 'weaknesses', 'demonization', 'Nazis', 'yet', 'so', 'Russians', 'Cold', 'War', '-I', 'understand', 'development', 'defendants', 'cases', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'feasible', 'movie', 'omissions', 'are', 'daunting', 'judges', 'rendering', 'sentences', 'highlight', 'decision', 'acquit', 'Hjalmar', 'Schacht', 'certainly', 'important', 'decisions', 'vast', 'consequences', 'why', 'was', 'cross-examination', 'movie', 'was', 'described', 'most', 'eloquent', 'defendants', 'surpassing', 'even', 'Albert', 'Speer', '-Language', 'defendants', 'were', 'known', 'speak', 'English', 'fluently', 'trial', 'revealing', 'often', 'aristocratic', 'background', 'von', 'Ribbentrop', 'example', 'Others', 'did', 'not', 'yet', 'distinction', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'movie', 'rather', 'making', 'defendants', 'speak', 'English', 'very', 'ludicrous', 'accents.To', 'conclude', ""'Nuremberg"", 'certainly', 'great', 'introduction', 'trials', 'bit', 'more', 'advanced', 'knowledge', 'issue', 'will', 'remain', 'unsatisfied.Overall', ""'Judgment"", 'Nuremberg', 'best', 'movie', 'available', 'concerning', 'legal', 'aspect', 'trials', 'even', 'not', 'touch', ""'war"", 'criminals', 'Nazi', 'judges']",N/A

The actual Nuremburg trials went on for much longer than three hours, however, so imagine how much had to be left out!Brian Cox is brilliant as Hermann Goering, portraying him as the vain and egotistical, yet clever and often easily likable person he could be, despite his history as one of the most horrible people of all time. Nuremburg goes beyond showing him as the faceless Nazi monster; as a proud soldier and pilot (he was head of the Luftwaffe during WW2, and in WW1, had been a decorated pilot himself), and a man capable of humor and kindness. Particularly powerful scenes include one towards the beginning when he entertains a group of GI's by playing the accordion and singing, and another towards the end, when his wife asks him if she can take home some of the food that had been provided for what would probably be his last meal, and he very ""normally"" says, ""I don't see why not,"" and looks for someone to ask. The last scene must be viewed to fully understand what I mean.The movie seems to have been made with historical correctness in mind. Small bits of fact that never would have been included in a big budget hollywood picture make it here, like the scene in which the defendants give their pleas, and Goering attempts to make a statement but is cut off by the judge. Also historically correct is the way in which Goering initially made the prosecutors, representing the allied forces, look like idiots, while he endeared himself to everyone in the room with his witty remarks.The friendship between Goering and the American soldier ""Tex"" is also completely true, and the movie insinuates one of the two most popular explanations for how Goering got the cyanide ampule into his cell, despite the fact that it and he were searched regularly. Nuremburg seems to say that Goering asked his friend to retrieve a bag of personal items for him to go through and give away. The other belief is that the American knowingly brought the ampule to Goering, rather than Goering tricking him. The reality will probably never be completely known.For history buffs, this is a must see.

With painstaking precision (and at extraordinary cost in terms of international arm-twisting and back-door deals), the proponents of a judicial proceeding designed to illustrate the manifest individual guilt of the various Nazi officials forged a result that still stands today as a model of a non-retributive effort in the face of extraordinary pressure. In this carefully reearched and terrifically presented movie depiction of the events, one comes to appreciate the problems facing the Allies in proceeding with the trials. And while one can hardly describe the Nuremberg trials as unflawed or perfect, they did prove to the world that the Allies were willing to subscribe to the existing canon of law to judge the actions of the Nazis.Doing so was anything but easy, Indeed, achieving a fair result that would literally convince the watching world of the guilt of the participants in the war was anything but easy, and moving toward that deliberate goal is a theme providing an interesting theme punctuating the pace of the book. Churchill wanted revenge by way of summary trials and quick retribution, while the Russians just wanted to string up the whole group in a mass hanging. Yet American Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson (Alex Baldwin) was able to resolve the differences well enough to proceed, although at times the viewer wonders if the trials will be anything like the fair-minded judicial event he has in mind.Indeed, the back-stabbing, personal ambitions, and petty jealousies of the various factions, trial officials, and individual defendants becomes a kind of political circus that sometimes resembles nothing so much as vaudevillian showboating.Still, the efforts at conducting a fair and open forum for the world to watch as the prosecution and defense teams clashed before the international tribunal prevailed, and the trials concluded with mixed results in terms of the results. Most of the defendants were found guilty, and many were hanged.Yet few observers doubted that the defendants had had their day in court along with and adequate opportunity to defend their actions to a watching world. Given how little justice and liberty they collectively allowed for their tens of millions of victims, it is remarkable just how civilized and dignified a proceeding the Nuremberg trials were, with all their theatrics and subterranean undercurrents.One marvels at the fact that after fifty years the world still stands in awe at the deliberate, careful, and methodical way in which the Allies achieved the result of a rational and fair trial of the defendants in history's most horrific modern nightmare, the terror of the Third Reich. This is an interesting and absorbing film presentation, and it is fascinating and entertaining to watch. It was also particularly interesting to me because it explores the lives of each of the defendants in looking at their individual guilt. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about these singular trials and their impact on history.",4,Absorbing Depiction of Trials Of Nazi ELite!,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",2002,3331,"['mind', 'many', 'historical', 'observers', 'nothing', 'so', 'striking', 'manifest', 'differences', 'horrific', 'nature', 'Third', 'Reich', 'more', 'rational', 'compassionate', 'constitutional', 'democracies', 'largely', 'comprised', 'Allies', 'way', 'defendants', 'trials', 'Nuremberg', 'were', 'handled', 'painstaking', 'precision', 'extraordinary', 'cost', 'terms', 'international', 'arm-twisting', 'back-door', 'deals', 'proponents', 'judicial', 'proceeding', 'designed', 'illustrate', 'manifest', 'individual', 'guilt', 'various', 'Nazi', 'officials', 'forged', 'result', 'still', 'today', 'model', 'non-retributive', 'effort', 'face', 'extraordinary', 'pressure', 'carefully', 'reearched', 'terrifically', 'presented', 'movie', 'depiction', 'events', 'one', 'appreciate', 'problems', 'facing', 'Allies', 'proceeding', 'trials', 'one', 'can', 'hardly', 'describe', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'unflawed', 'perfect', 'did', 'prove', 'world', 'Allies', 'were', 'willing', 'subscribe', 'existing', 'canon', 'law', 'judge', 'actions', 'Nazis.Doing', 'so', 'was', 'anything', 'easy', 'Indeed', 'achieving', 'fair', 'result', 'would', 'literally', 'convince', 'watching', 'world', 'guilt', 'participants', 'war', 'was', 'anything', 'easy', 'moving', 'deliberate', 'goal', 'theme', 'providing', 'interesting', 'theme', 'punctuating', 'pace', 'book', 'Churchill', 'wanted', 'revenge', 'way', 'summary', 'trials', 'quick', 'retribution', 'Russians', 'just', 'wanted', 'string', 'up', 'whole', 'group', 'mass', 'hanging', 'American', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Justice', 'Robert', 'Jackson', 'Alex', 'Baldwin', 'was', 'able', 'resolve', 'differences', 'well', 'enough', 'proceed', 'times', 'viewer', 'wonders', 'trials', 'will', 'be', 'anything', 'fair-minded', 'judicial', 'event', 'mind.Indeed', 'back-stabbing', 'personal', 'ambitions', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'various', 'factions', 'trial', 'officials', 'individual', 'defendants', 'kind', 'political', 'circus', 'resembles', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'vaudevillian', 'showboating.Still', 'efforts', 'conducting', 'fair', 'open', 'forum', 'world', 'watch', 'prosecution', 'defense', 'teams', 'clashed', 'international', 'tribunal', 'prevailed', 'trials', 'concluded', 'mixed', 'results', 'terms', 'results', 'Most', 'defendants', 'were', 'found', 'guilty', 'many', 'were', 'hanged.Yet', 'few', 'observers', 'doubted', 'defendants', 'had', 'had', 'day', 'court', 'adequate', 'opportunity', 'defend', 'actions', 'watching', 'world', 'Given', 'how', 'little', 'justice', 'liberty', 'collectively', 'allowed', 'tens', 'millions', 'victims', 'remarkable', 'just', 'how', 'civilized', 'dignified', 'proceeding', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'were', 'theatrics', 'subterranean', 'undercurrents.One', 'marvels', 'fact', 'fifty', 'years', 'world', 'still', 'awe', 'deliberate', 'careful', 'methodical', 'way', 'Allies', 'achieved', 'result', 'rational', 'fair', 'trial', 'defendants', 'history', 'most', 'horrific', 'modern', 'nightmare', 'terror', 'Third', 'Reich', 'interesting', 'absorbing', 'film', 'presentation', 'fascinating', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'was', 'also', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'lives', 'defendants', 'looking', 'individual', 'guilt', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'singular', 'trials', 'impact', 'history']",N/A

I find the opening scenes with real video of the Nazi's at Nuremberg very compelling. it begins with the preparation pertaining to who would be assigned what role in the trials to the conclusion in which those found guilty were hanged. There are so many actors who do such a fantastic job that at times, I forget I am watching actors not real indivuduals. For example, the psychologist gives insight into the thought processes of the Nazi's. Brian Cox does an excellent job of portraying Hermann Goering as Goering was arrogant during the real trial and is suspected of obtaining the cyanide from an American officer he manipulated. Michael Ironside also does an excellent  job of portraying  Colonel Burton Andrus who to his dying day, resented the fact that Goering had evaded the noose.  Alec Baldwin is portrays Justice Jackson and Christopher Plummber as always does an excellent portrayer as Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe.

But, that in itself is a problem with this film.The unadulterated racism of the Nazis isn't really expressed here.  For an historical document on that regime this is inexcusable.  What we get is a highly entertaining show on the villainy of the Nazi leaders on trial and the moral rightness of those who are judging them.  For a pursuit of the average viewer perhaps this is sufficient.  But, as a student of history I recognize that the problems don't boil down to such a simplicity.  There is no mention of just what made Hitler's rise to power actually happen.  Hitler himself is treated as unapproachable on every level.  Not that I am interested in his ideas, but seriously how does one have an indepth look at the true twist on humanity that Hitler was without a look into the actual substance of his beliefs?Moreover, how do we connect that with the Nuremberg trial?  You see, the greatest problem with this film is the inexcusable lack of connection with the regimes ultimate leader: Hitler himself.Instead we are left with Goering, separated from Hitler altogether.Perhaps the goal of this film should not have been to understand the tyrant, but I fail to understand how we can understand the minds of his followers here without a depth of the connection to the man himself.Ok, end of rant.On a basic level this film introduces us to some of Hitler's mightiest henchmen in their day of reckoning.  The timing, the setting, the symbolism all collide to overwhelm the Nazi concept.  The result is that the Nazis cannot have been anything but simply evil men in power who destroyed anyone they believed were ""undesirable.""There are some really good things about this film.  The pomposity of Goering is fully on display in actor Brian Cox.  With his script he performs superbly, finding a gift with his role that is lacking in most of the other major players.The depiction of war torn Nuremberg is also quite fascinating, giving a feel for the actual conditions of Germany post WWII.The problem I have, though, is one I will always have with anti-Nazi films.  They always defer reality and do not demonstrate the Nazi experience in such a way that it can be understood in reality by people.  Just why were they so perverted in their thoughts?  How did they become a nation of killers?  Hitler tapped into something more primal that simple nationalism.  He appealed to the worst instincts in a people who were already prejudiced against the ""subhuman.""So, a lot of important information about the Nazis must be presumed when going into this film, or ignored altogether.  The clash of morals is left without substance as a result.  And, that's why I give this film only 3 stars.  It is a powerful introduction to the history of the Nazis, and I recommend it for anyone over the age of 15.  But, it is far too light and far too removed from the actual realities of Nazi Germany to be a serious testament on that particular history.",3,A thinly disguised anti-Nazi film.,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3031,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'hold', 'Nazis', 'poorest', 'esteem', 'were', 'blight', 'humanity', 'problem', 'film.The', 'unadulterated', 'racism', 'Nazis', ""n't"", 'really', 'expressed', 'here', 'historical', 'document', 'regime', 'inexcusable', 'What', 'get', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'show', 'villainy', 'Nazi', 'leaders', 'trial', 'moral', 'rightness', 'who', 'are', 'judging', 'pursuit', 'average', 'viewer', 'perhaps', 'sufficient', 'student', 'history', 'recognize', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'boil', 'down', 'such', 'simplicity', 'mention', 'just', 'what', 'made', 'Hitler', 'rise', 'power', 'actually', 'happen', 'Hitler', 'treated', 'unapproachable', 'level', 'Not', 'am', 'interested', 'ideas', 'seriously', 'how', 'one', 'have', 'indepth', 'look', 'true', 'twist', 'humanity', 'Hitler', 'was', 'look', 'actual', 'substance', 'beliefs', 'Moreover', 'how', 'do', 'connect', 'Nuremberg', 'trial', 'see', 'greatest', 'problem', 'film', 'inexcusable', 'lack', 'connection', 'regimes', 'ultimate', 'leader', 'Hitler', 'himself.Instead', 'are', 'left', 'Goering', 'separated', 'Hitler', 'goal', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'understand', 'tyrant', 'fail', 'understand', 'how', 'can', 'understand', 'minds', 'followers', 'here', 'depth', 'connection', 'man', 'himself.Ok', 'end', 'rant.On', 'basic', 'level', 'film', 'Hitler', 'mightiest', 'henchmen', 'day', 'reckoning', 'timing', 'setting', 'symbolism', 'collide', 'overwhelm', 'Nazi', 'concept', 'result', 'Nazis', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'anything', 'simply', 'evil', 'men', 'power', 'who', 'destroyed', 'anyone', 'believed', 'were', 'undesirable', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'pomposity', 'Goering', 'fully', 'display', 'actor', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'script', 'superbly', 'finding', 'gift', 'role', 'lacking', 'most', 'other', 'major', 'players.The', 'depiction', 'war', 'torn', 'Nuremberg', 'also', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'giving', 'feel', 'actual', 'conditions', 'Germany', 'post', 'WWII.The', 'problem', 'have', 'though', 'one', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'anti-Nazi', 'films', 'always', 'defer', 'reality', 'do', 'not', 'demonstrate', 'Nazi', 'experience', 'such', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'understood', 'reality', 'people', 'Just', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'perverted', 'thoughts', 'How', 'did', 'become', 'nation', 'killers', 'Hitler', 'tapped', 'something', 'more', 'primal', 'simple', 'nationalism', 'appealed', 'worst', 'instincts', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'already', 'prejudiced', 'subhuman', 'So', 'lot', 'important', 'information', 'Nazis', 'must', 'be', 'presumed', 'when', 'going', 'film', 'ignored', 'altogether', 'clash', 'morals', 'left', 'substance', 'result', 'why', 'give', 'film', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'powerful', 'introduction', 'history', 'Nazis', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'age', '15', 'far', 'too', 'light', 'far', 'too', 'removed', 'actual', 'realities', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'be', 'serious', 'testament', 'particular', 'history']",N/A

The previous films could be enjoyed even by viewers possessing little knowledge about  that horrendous period.  The names of Robert Jackson, Herman Goering, Hans Frank, and Albert Speer are admittedly not widely recognizable.The Nuremberg trials were conducted by the Allied victors soon after the end of World War II.  It was the first international tribunal in the history of humankind  devoted to the criminal behavior of the losers. The challenge was to conduct a fair trial premised upon justice and not revenge.  Although the evidence was  overwhelming regarding the holocaust, large scale theft, and other transgressions, many of the defendants claimed that they merely followed orders.  This line of  defense may seem appalling in our day and age, but during that era it was widely accepted.  Judge Jackson (Baldwin) was picked by President Harry Truman to carry  out this most delicate task without alienating our Soviet Russian allies.  The irony of course is that the Soviets were also murderous thugs, but in this less than perfect  world compromise with evil is sometimes unavoidable.Brian Cox brilliantly portrays Reichmarshal Goering, the heroic German fighter pilot of the First World War who ultimately became Hitler's right hand man. Goering  possessed superb management skills, courage, a great sense of humor, cultural sophistication, and an ability to insightfully comment on the Nazi reign of terror.  He  also had a hard time comprehending the legitimate reasons why the civilized world considered him a diabolical monster.  Observing the brief discussions between  Goering and U.S. Army psychologist Captain Gustav Gilbert (Matt Craven) may do more to reveal the mindset of the Nazi hierarchy than reading numerous books.  Gilbert a Jewish American had the awkward responsibility of providing care and understanding to those who ruthlessly slaughtered his own people.  Captain Gilbert's  self discipline and maturity were constantly put to the test.Artistically speaking &quot;Nuremberg&quot; deserves only four stars, but that is not a valid excuse to keep you from seeing it.  The very last scene has Max von Sydow as Samuel Rosenman  uttering the hope that perhaps the Nuremberg trials will be the last of their kind.  Rosenman is not childishly naive, and knows that history will likely be repeated.  The  at least metaphorical reality of original sin regrettably makes this a virtual certainty.  We have the moral duty to learn how to increase the odds in our favor.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[5, 5]","A new precedent was set in the months following the conclusion of World War II:  the Nazis in charge of putting the holocaust into motion were to be tried as criminals.  This was new legal ground that needed to be conquered by attorneys operating under a brand new set of judicial rules.  The household name for the proceedings would come to be known as simply the Nuermberg trials.Given the fact that there were 20+ defendents, there were two ways the makers of this movie could have taken.  The first would be to do an in-depth re-creation of each & every Nazi's case.  Of course, the film would then end up being twice as long as I, CLAUDIUS.Or, they could focus on one major character and have the rest of the personages blend into the background.  This is what they did.  The primary Nazi whose career is examined in detail is the leader of the Luftwaffe:  Hermann Goering.  Meanwhile, the likes of Rudolph Hesse, Karl D&ouml;nitz and the rest play more-or-less an incidental role in the film.The direction and acting is exceptional in this rendition of one of the 20th century's darkest hours.  Christopher Plummer is excellent as the thoughtful yet fervent British legal representative.  Brian Cox plays a riveting Reichmarshal Goering and the usually stoic Alec Baldwin turns in one of the better performances of his career.This is a terrific (albeit depressing) movie about a pivotal moment, not just in the 20th century, but in all of human history.  Perhaps we have finally come to the point where we will no longer tacitly condone the despotism of madmen, or the insane paroxysms of the mob.  Never again can we think  of genocide as a ""solution"" to anything.  Rather, genocide itself is a problem that REQUIRES a solution.I recommend this film to everyone over the age of 18.

568665,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000056B67,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 4]","""Nuremburg"" is a chilling and disturbing look at the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war criminals after WWII.  The story is historically accurate and captures the political and psychological climate of the times.  It also serves as a distressing reminder to a young generation that has not experienced war in its lifetime of the horrors of which humanity is capable.The film examines a number of fascinating angles of the trial.  Instead of just focusing on the trial itself (of which there is plenty), it also offers a look at the political rivalry and infighting of the victorious nations, and a number of character studies of the prisoners.  The most prominently portrayed of these is Hermann G&ouml;ring (Brain Cox), Reich Marshall of the Third Reich and a member of Hitler's inner circle.  G&ouml;ring is portrayed as a cunning and charismatic adversary, who almost succeeds at making a sham of the entire trial.The haunting question that must pervade anyone's mind that ponders the atrocities that occurred in WWII Germany is verbalized in the film by Elsie Douglas (Jill Hennessey).  She says, ""How could civilized human beings ever do that to other civilized human beings?"", to which Justice Jackson (Alec Baldwin) replies, &quot;Maybe civilization is overrated.&quot;  This film provides some insight into the motivation of the German leaders, examining the warped perspective of the perpetrators who attempt to rationalize to themselves and to the court the horrors they committed .  They point to the German sense of duty and obedience that is ingrained into their culture.  After all, they were only following orders.  There is also the undercurrent of Hitler's ruthlessness in using the SS to eliminate all opposition.  In a particularly lucid moment, G&ouml;ring says that if you look up and down the cellblock all you see is ""yes men"" because all the ""no men"" are six feet underground.  G&ouml;ring also points out the hypocrisy of the criticism of German hatred of the Jews by a U.S. society that interred millions of Japanese citizens, and tolerates segregation and hate-crimes against blacks.Certainly, this is no justification for the systematic annihilation of 10 million of their own citizens, and as the film progresses a number of the prisoners begin to express deep remorse for their actions.  Still, it shows that this wasn't a group of sociopathic monsters in the conventional sense.  They were otherwise normal men who had accomplished the inconceivable by dehumanizing their victims to the point where the horrors they committed every day were no more disturbing to them than hunting deer to trim the herd.  This is the most frightening thought of all, because it portends the possibility that such unthinkable acts could happen again.  As long as we are able to believe that these men were a gaggle of homicidal maniacs, a freak societal aberration, we can reassure ourselves that this couldn't ever recur.  However, when it dawns on us that normal people are able to rationalize such behavior, we realize that under the right circumstances the potential for such inhumanity always exists.  Complacency is an inadvertent ally of oppression, and this film should shock even the most casual viewer out of it.  In this regard, it is instructive and enlightening.The direction by Yves Simoneau is excellent and rises well above his mostly TV credits.  The mood of the period is realistically rendered with a great deal of period accuracy.  The costumes and period props are excellent with an eye for detail.  He does an outstanding job creating background reaction shots, especially among the prisoners, that show their sarcastic disdain for their captors and display their smug superiority.  He brings great power to numerous scenes using various camera angles.  The holocaust footage used is some of the most disconcerting and inclusive I have ever seen.  If there is any criticism to be leveled against the crafting of this film, it is that it delved too deeply into minutia, especially the sexual undercurrents between Jackson and Elsie Douglas.  However, given the fact that it was produced as a TNT miniseries, the director was forced to fluff it up for the additional runtime.The acting is also outstanding.  Alec Baldwin gives a solid performance as Robert Jackson, a man obsessed with justice.  Baldwin has never been known for his passion, but he elevates his game in certain parts of this film.  Jill Hennessey is also excellent as Elsie, rendering her as a tough and smart woman who is a guiding force in the entire proceeding.  However, by far the best performance is delivered by Brain Cox as G&ouml;ring.  His is a brilliant and complex performance that brings the reprehensible and magnetic Nazi leader to life in a way that is both attractive and loathsome.  Colm Feore also gives a spine tingling performance as Rudolf H&ouml;ss, the Commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp, who cavalierly discusses the efficiency techniques of eliminating prisoners, with the cold precision of an industrial engineer.This terrific drama rises far above its TV roots.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is important viewing which reminds us that we cannot become complacent about tyranny, and we must be ever vigilant to guard against its recurrence.",5,Outstanding drama that servves as a chilling

In reality, everyone admitted that the Soviet role in the trial was basically fair and constructive, in spite of the fact that the Soviet judges were totally under the thumb of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who really was no better than Hitler and his Nazis whom they were supposed to be judging.(2)  Albert Speer is portrayed as a truly penitent Nazi technocrat.  Many people, including Airey Neave (the British officer who presented the indictments and who was tragically murdered by the Irish Republican Army in 1979) felt that it was unfair to execute Nazi Labor chief Sauckel and to let Speer off to become a prosperous, professional ""ex-Nazi"" when all Sauckel did was round up laborers for Speers armaments industries.  Speer does admit that he was always pressuring Sauckel for more laborers, but Neave and others feel that his remorse for what he did was mainly to get sympathy from the judges and that he never really confronted his own, direct personal responsibility for the horrors of the Nazi regime, rather than just the collective responsibility he accepted.(3) Although judge Francis Biddle is shown to be a rather petty man, the film doesn't make clear that both he and Justice Jackson were miscast in their roles in the trial, because Biddle had a career as a prosecutor but was chosen by President Truman to be a Judge in the trial, whereas Jackson was a Supreme Court Justice yet was chosen to be a prosecutor in the trial.(4)  The film, probably correctly, leaves the role of Goering's guard ""Tex"" as ambiguous in his enabling Goering to get ahold of the cynanide capsule in order to cheat the hangman.  It is not clear even today whether Tex really wanted to help Goering get the capsule, or whether it was just negligence and disobeyal of orders when he brought Goering the belongings he asked for.(5) Psychiatrist Capt Gustav Gilbert's great ""revelation"" in discovering that the reason the Nazis did such terrible things was ""a lack of empathy"" is certainly over-simplistic.  Although it is true that they were indifferent to the suffering they caused, this does not explain how they managed to set up an industrialized mass-murder machine and how they got much of Europe to at least passively accept the Holocaust.  Many people are indifferent to the suffering of others, but that doesn't mean they go out and deliberately cause suffering to their neighbors.Having said these things, I still think everyone should see this film to understand the greatest tragedy of the 20th century-the Second World War.",5,Some Comments,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,3175,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'importance', 'film', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'few', 'points', 'may', 'be', 'important', '1', 'so', 'many', 'Western', 'films', 'Russians', 'actually', 'Soviets', 'are', 'caricature-they', 'are', 'portrayed', 'uncouth', 'louts.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'scene', 'party', 'Jackson', 'house', 'where', 'German', 'butler', 'wife', 'refuse', 'serve', 'Russian', 'judge', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'Russian', 'front.Jackson', 'secretary', 'tries', 'calm', 'situation', 'showing', 'understanding', 'Russian', 'response', 'most', 'victims', 'Nazism', 'horrors', 'were', 'residents', 'USSR', 'simply', 'dismissing', 'politics', 'reality', 'everyone', 'admitted', 'Soviet', 'role', 'trial', 'was', 'basically', 'fair', 'constructive', 'spite', 'fact', 'Soviet', 'judges', 'were', 'totally', 'thumb', 'Soviet', 'dictator', 'Josef', 'Stalin', 'who', 'really', 'was', 'better', 'Hitler', 'Nazis', 'whom', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'judging', '2', 'Albert', 'Speer', 'portrayed', 'truly', 'penitent', 'Nazi', 'technocrat', 'Many', 'people', 'including', 'Airey', 'Neave', 'British', 'officer', 'who', 'presented', 'indictments', 'who', 'was', 'tragically', 'murdered', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', '1979', 'felt', 'was', 'unfair', 'execute', 'Nazi', 'Labor', 'chief', 'Sauckel', 'let', 'Speer', 'become', 'prosperous', 'professional', 'ex-Nazi', 'when', 'Sauckel', 'did', 'was', 'round', 'up', 'laborers', 'Speers', 'armaments', 'industries', 'Speer', 'admit', 'was', 'always', 'pressuring', 'Sauckel', 'more', 'laborers', 'Neave', 'others', 'feel', 'remorse', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'mainly', 'get', 'sympathy', 'judges', 'never', 'really', 'confronted', 'own', 'direct', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'horrors', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'rather', 'just', 'collective', 'responsibility', 'accepted', '3', 'judge', 'Francis', 'Biddle', 'shown', 'be', 'rather', 'petty', 'man', 'film', ""n't"", 'make', 'clear', 'Justice', 'Jackson', 'were', 'miscast', 'roles', 'trial', 'Biddle', 'had', 'career', 'prosecutor', 'was', 'chosen', 'President', 'Truman', 'be', 'Judge', 'trial', 'Jackson', 'was', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'Justice', 'yet', 'was', 'chosen', 'be', 'prosecutor', 'trial', '4', 'film', 'probably', 'correctly', 'role', 'Goering', 'guard', 'Tex', 'ambiguous', 'enabling', 'Goering', 'get', 'ahold', 'cynanide', 'capsule', 'order', 'cheat', 'hangman', 'not', 'clear', 'even', 'today', 'Tex', 'really', 'wanted', 'help', 'Goering', 'get', 'capsule', 'was', 'just', 'negligence', 'disobeyal', 'orders', 'when', 'brought', 'Goering', 'belongings', 'asked', '5', 'Psychiatrist', 'Capt', 'Gustav', 'Gilbert', 'great', 'revelation', 'discovering', 'reason', 'Nazis', 'did', 'such', 'terrible', 'things', 'was', 'lack', 'empathy', 'certainly', 'over-simplistic', 'true', 'were', 'indifferent', 'suffering', 'caused', 'not', 'explain', 'how', 'managed', 'set', 'up', 'industrialized', 'mass-murder', 'machine', 'how', 'got', 'much', 'Europe', 'least', 'passively', 'Holocaust', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'indifferent', 'suffering', 'others', ""n't"", 'mean', 'go', 'out', 'deliberately', 'cause', 'suffering', 'neighbors.Having', 'said', 'things', 'still', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'understand', 'greatest', 'tragedy', '20th', 'century-the', 'Second', 'World', 'War']",N/A

Alec Baldwin has not been a favorite and I doubted what he might do in portraying Justice Robert Jackson.  Nevertheless, Jackson was far from perfect himself, both personally and professionally, so maybe it's fit casting.  In 60 years, no one else has had the courage to take on this important story, so give Mr. Baldwin his due, both as leading actor and co-executive producer.Staging, costumes, and cinematography are outstanding in this made-for-TV production.  Views of the bombed-out city of Nuremberg seem genuine from beginning to end.  Reconstruction of the Palace of Justice is extremely well done.  As an old car buff, I enjoyed seeing vehicles from the 1940's and 50's so well maintained.  Big social gatherings are lavish and well-staged.  In summary, this is a big-budget production.In rating this movie I might have given it 5 stars except for the portrayal of the British prosecutors.  This  was understated quite a bit.  Sir David Maxwell-Fife, not Judge Jackson, was the one who unmasked Hermann Goering as the psychopathic monster that he truly was.  Moreover, fellow-Britisher, Sir Hartley Showcross, was given credit for the most moving summation, not Jackson.  No one was cast to play the Showcross part which is unfortunate given the outstanding British actors available.Another weakness was how the Soviets were depicted.  Comrades Rudenko, Nikitchenko, and others contributed a lot to what happened at Nuremberg in the real trial, despite constant kibbitzing from Moscow.  This was the only true International Tribunal on war crimes and all four prosecuting countries, the U. S., Great Britain, France, and USSR played their roles.As to casting in the movie, one inevitably compares to the 1961 landmark movie, ""Judgment at Nuremberg.""  That film had Spencer Tracy, Maxmillian Schell (who won the best actor Oscar that year), Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Montgomery Clift, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and several others of note.  These even included William Shatner in his first big-screen performance.  In no way does the 2000 production compare to the 1961 film in the depth of characterization and the sheer poetry of the screenplay by Abby Mann. And yet, because of the commanding presence of Spencer Tracy as American lead judge, Haywood, and the role of a lifetime for Maxmillian Schell, other performances have been overlooked.In my view, Burt Lancaster was eloquent as the chief German judge, Ernst Janning.  Several of his lines in the movie still haunt me, especially: ""Were we DEAF? DUMB? BLIND?""  Then, the rejoinder from Spencer Tracy at the end: ""But Herr Janning, it came to that the first time you sentenced a man to death you knew to be innocent.""  Finally, Marlene Dietrich was remarkable in her limited role.  Who can forget the scene of her sitting alone in the dark and letting the phone ring, as Judge Haywood was calling to say goodbye?Nevertheless, there are some important performances in the newer movie that must be acknowledged.Brian Cox is absolutely first-rate as Hermann Goering.  One minute he's the jovial family man; the next, a psychopathic killer and founder of the Gestapo.  I will no longer see Mr. Cox as just an exceptional narrator of World War II documentaries.  As others point out, Cox literally steals the show in ""Nuremberg.""Moreover, the German actor Herbert Knaup, who portrays Albert Speer, does a memorable job, as Goering's counterweight with the Nazi defendants.  Speer seems sincerely repentant for his part in the war crimes and this saves his life.  His final statement in court is worth watching and re-watching, as he warns mankind that the next major war could destroy the globe itself.Christopher Plummer is fine as David Maxwell-Fife, but the screenwriter only gave him one big scene.  That was where he described a Nazi mass execution in the Ukraine--a spine chilling moment to be sure.  In reality, Maxwell-Fife was the star of the prosecution team, as said above, and he deserves far more credit than he got in this movie.It's true, as critics point out, that the hanging of the condemned men did not proceed, one, two, three, as shown in this film.  Rather, some of the men took 20 minutes or more, to die.  Also, I agree with other reviewers who found fault with the love affair depicted between Jackson and his secretary.  We could have dispensed with that in favor of some other more weighty things, including defense of the two Nazi naval officers.  As it is, the movie runs 3 hours so not a great deal of time could be spent on the subject.  But the defense made by Capt. Kranzbuehler, saved the lives of Admirals Raeder and Doenitz.  Moreover, Kranzbuehler set precedents in international law with his defense.In comparing ""Nuremberg"" with other TV miniseries on the Third Reich, I'd say it's a notch below ""Hitler: The Rise of Evil"" (2003), starring Robert Carlyle and ""Inside the Third Reich"" (1982), with Rutger Hauer, John Gielgud, and Derek Jakobi. I see ""Nuremberg"" on a par, though, with ""The Bunker"" (1981), starring Anthony Hopkins.I would highly recommend the newer movie, ""Nuremberg,"" despite its flaws.  I got it on loan from a friend and plan to buy the DVD later for my collection. ""Nuremberg"" does not measure up to ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" but few films ever will.  The newer film tells a much different story and may take literary license along the way.  These points notwithstanding, it makes a contribution to our understanding the Third Reich, the world's foulest tyranny.  We must try to understand it, lest we repeat it.",4,Much better than expected,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,5610,"['Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'docu-drama', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'Alec',

568675,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B000056B67,Joseph Haschka,"[8, 11]","From late 1945 to early 1949, the Nazi assault on Europe was brought to closure with a spate of war crimes litigation, collectively known as the Nuremberg Trials. As an absolutely necessary vehicle for making the world comprehend the extent of Nazi barbarism, it was, in a sense, anticlimactic. After years of total war, with all its attendant death and destruction, the deliberations and speeches of judges and lawyers in a big room can hardly be considered otherwise. NUREMBERG, released as a U.S. television miniseries, depicts the first of twelve Nuremberg Trials, that one involving the legal prosecution and judgement of 21 members of the Nazi hierarchy: G&ouml;ring, Speer, Kaltenbrunner, Jodl, Frick, von Schirach, Raeder, Hess, von Papen, D&ouml;nitz, Frank, Keitel, Streicher, Schacht, von Ribbentrop, Seyss-Inquart, Funk, Sauckel, Rosenberg, von Neurath, and Fritzsche. Three others were indicted, but not in attendance: Bormann (not in custody), Ley (suicide), and Krupp (poor health).The cast is large, but the two principal players are Alec Baldwin as the U.S. Chief Prosecutor, Robert Jackson, and Brian Cox as Reichsmarschall G&ouml;ring. The former does his usual, inspired best to create a bland character. The latter does a wonderful job recreating the flamboyant Luftwaffe chief, although one wonders why the producers couldn't find someone who could do a credible German accent, much less any sort of accent whatsoever. (Perhaps that's one of the differences between a ""made-for-TV"" film and a big screen release.) Indeed, one of the film's best features is watching G&ouml;ring charm his way into the friendship of the Army lieutenant assigned as his personal minder, thus providing himself the avenue to cheat the hangman in the end.At one point in the storyline, Jackson's deputy prosecutors ask him who the Nazis' defense lawyers are to be. U.S. Army lawyers? German lawyers? Nazi lawyers? Jackson sidesteps the question, and the viewer never learns the answer, though it's obvious later on that Germans were assigned as defense counselors.  However, the defense's opening and/or closing statements were never re-created. This was a major omission, since some of the film's strongest moments came from the re-enactment of witness testimony and visual evidence presentation, as well as portions of the prosecution's opening and closing statements.NUREMBERG has a couple of totally needless subplots. Since the U.S. government denied its prosecuting staff the benefit of taking spouses along to Germany, Jackson was inordinately lucky to have along his winsome chief secretary, Elsie Douglas, played by Jill Hennessy.  While the two were waiting at the stateside airport for their ride to Europe, Elsie complains about having put a run in her nylons, and shows Jackson a bit of shapely leg to illustrate. At that point, I thought the trial depiction might degenerate into serving as the backdrop for some tawdry affair, but, mercifully, the director swerved away from that pothole in the nick of time. Then, there's the Army prison's Jewish psychologist, who spends his time trying to get a clue as to how the Reich's leadership could justify the genocide of his people. It isn't until he interviews the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, a witness for Kaltenbrunner, that he finally understands. Hoess asks the rhetorical question, ""Does the exterminator care about the rats he kills?"" (Actually, this was one of the film's strongest scenes, as Hoess is chillingly played.)For one with no prior knowledge of the Nuremberg trials, NUREMBERG will serve as a fine introduction. However, the good and bad aspects of the movie cancel each other out and result in a surprisingly spiritless piece.

The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that CIVILIZATION cannot tolerate their being ignored, because it CANNOT SURVIVE THEIR BEING REPEATED. That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason.""That lengthy quote, part of an even lengthier speech, is mouthed verbatim by Mr. Justice Jackson (Alec Baldwin).  What I love most about this film is its adherence to historical details about this first of thirteen trials in Nuremberg.  The 21 defendants to this trial, named the Major War Figures Trial, are seated precisely in the order they were in during the original trial with Goering seated conspicuously in the corner.  The Nazi defendant Kaltenbrunner's character, who was the friend who introduced the Nazi party to the infamous Adolph Eichmann (executed in Jerusalem in 1961), has the height, (he was 6'6"") and scar on his left cheek.  Indeed, the 21 defendants' personalities, behaviors, looks, are all effectively recreated in the cast who play them.  Alec Baldwin is practically the only American on the cast.  Most of the rest are Canadian.  I believe Baldwin helped produce this TV miniseries which first appeared on TNT.  Brian Cox, as others have noted, was fab as Goehring, playing him as the clever, cunning, and charming Reichsmarschall he was, who entertains naive U.S. soldiers and whose seeming lightheartedness to the whole affair presents problems to the prosecutors and military in charge of him.  Eleven of the 21 defendants were sentenced to death, the rest given prison sentences.  Goehring, the day before their executions on October 16, 1946, swallowed cyanide smuggled in probably by his American military guard.  At first, I was disappointed with this film, I had seen Judgment at Nuremberg right before, yet watching it again and doing some net research, I must say that it is good, although somewhat inferior, yet worthy of five stars for content, its faithful reproduction of this trial.  I was most impressed by Matt Craven who plays the Army's psychologist, Captain Gilbert, in charge of the defendants.  His interrogations of and interactions with those men added a dimension that was lacking in the first film, revealing the thought processes of these most notorious criminals; some of them find out that he is jewish.  It was during this trial, the original War Criminals Trial, that the actual footage of concentration camp atrocities was shown; the film shown in this movie and Judgment at Nuremberg is that same film taken by allied soldiers liberating the camps.The movie is based on the book Nuremberg:Infamy on Trial by Joseph Persico.",5,"""A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY""-Justice Robert Jackson",1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,3026,"['Nuremberg', 'Trials', 'Major', 'War', 'Figures', 'Trial', 'November', '21', '1945', 'privilege', 'opening', 'first', 'trial', 'history', 'crimes', 'peace', 'world', 'grave', 'responsibility', 'wrongs', 'seek', 'condemn', 'punish', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'calculated', 'so', 'malignant', 'so', 'devastating', 'CIVILIZATION', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'being', 'ignored', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'SURVIVE', 'THEIR', 'BEING', 'REPEATED', 'four', 'great', 'nations', 'flushed', 'victory', 'stung', 'injury', 'stay', 'hand', 'vengeance', 'voluntarily', 'submit', 'captive', 'enemies', 'judgment', 'law', 'one', 'most', 'significant', 'tributes', 'Power', 'ever', 'paid', 'Reason', 'lengthy', 'quote', 'part', 'even', 'lengthier', 'speech', 'mouthed', 'verbatim', 'Mr.', 'Justice', 'Jackson', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'film', 'adherence', 'historical', 'details', 'first', 'thirteen', 'trials', 'Nuremberg', '21', 'defendants', 'trial', 'named', 'Major', 'War', 'Figures', 'Trial', 'are', 'seated', 'precisely', 'order', 'were', 'original', 'trial', 'Goering', 'seated', 'conspicuously', 'corner', 'Nazi', 'defendant', 'Kaltenbrunner', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'friend', 'who', 'introduced', 'Nazi', 'party', 'infamous', 'Adolph', 'Eichmann', 'executed', 'Jerusalem', '1961', 'height', 'was', '6', '6', 'scar', 'left', 'cheek', 'Indeed', '21', 'defendants', 'personalities', 'behaviors', 'looks', 'are', 'effectively', 'recreated', 'cast', 'who', 'play', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'practically', 'only', 'American', 'cast', 'Most', 'rest', 'are', 'Canadian', 'believe', 'Baldwin', 'helped', 'produce', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'first', 'appeared', 'TNT', 'Brian', 'Cox', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'was', 'fab', 'Goehring', 'playing', 'clever', 'cunning', 'charming', 'Reichsmarschall', 'was', 'who', 'naive', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'seeming', 'lightheartedness', 'whole', 'affair', 'presents', 'problems', 'prosecutors', 'military', 'charge', 'Eleven', '21', 'defendants', 'were', 'sentenced', 'death', 'rest', 'given', 'prison', 'sentences', 'Goehring', 'day', 'executions', 'October', '16', '1946', 'swallowed', 'cyanide', 'smuggled', 'probably', 'American', 'military', 'guard', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'right', 'yet', 'watching', 'again', 'doing', 'net', 'research', 'must', 'say', 'good', 'somewhat', 'inferior', 'yet', 'worthy', 'five', 'stars', 'content', 'faithful', 'reproduction', 'trial', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'who', 'Army', 'psychologist', 'Captain', 'Gilbert', 'charge', 'defendants', 'interrogations', 'interactions', 'men', 'added', 'dimension', 'was', 'lacking', 'first', 'film', 'revealing', 'thought', 'processes', 'most', 'notorious', 'criminals', 'find', 'out', 'jewish', 'was', 'trial', 'original', 'War', 'Criminals', 'Trial', 'actual', 'footage', 'concentration', 'camp', 'atrocities', 'was', 'shown', 'film', 'shown', 'movie', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'same', 'film', 'taken', 'allied', 'soldiers', 'liberating', 'camps.The', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'Nuremberg', 'Infamy', 'Trial', 'Joseph', 'Persico']",N/A

The images of Nuremberg reduced to rubble ring true. The courtroom inclusion of  actual concentration camp film footage provides a stark contrast to the sanitized depiction seen in such films as  &quot;Sophie's Choice,&quot; Schindler's List,&quot; and &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot; The sensibilities of the Russian allies are  respectfully addressed. The portrayal of an American sergeant as the vehicle for Hermann Goering's ultimate  escape is consistent with the historical record. Actual events are recounted skillfully throughout.Still, the film is fairly unengaging. Despite perfunctory references, the question of how civilized people (leaders,  soldiers, and citizens) could resort to such inhumanity is not explored. A group of German officers in the 1940's  who merely did as they were told does not make for a very satisfying, gripping, nor generalizable story. That  story ends neatly at the end of the noose. The bigger issues are left unexplored, aside from such banalities as  &quot;Evil is the lack of empathy.&quot;&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961) examines these more thorny human issues with far more success.

The most compelling aspect of the production is Brian Cox's Herman Goering, who goes far beyond the traditional &quot;fat Nazi bastard&quot; conception. The most dramatic and insightful scenes are those with Goering, particularly the schizm he creates between the repentant Nazis (such as Speer) and the fanatics.The problem is, though, that on the DVD I have, the critical scene is missing! I don't know, maybe I nodded off or went through a time warp, but the scene just doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps my version is some kind of trimmed version; it's presented as a single movie rather than as two episodes. I know that other similar productions lose scenes for movie &quot;conversion&quot; but surely some of the pointless love story would be a far better candidate than the crucial lunch room scene. Throughout the rest of the DVD, this scene is repeatedly referred to, and plays a significant part in the major sub-plot about the psychology of the Nazi regime and of Germany.This is disasterous omission and may prompt my first unhappy customer return ever! I'm going to go back and check the DVD again right now, just to make sure.By the way, I had considered the fact that I may have remembered the movie wrong and the scene was in fact part of another lunch room sequence.

Brain Cox played a good Herman Goering. The other actors also gave good performances in there roles (The actor who played Psychologist Gustav Gilbert was especially good).Nuremberg is however not problem proof. The hangings for example are not accurate. Several of the convicted slowly strangled to death instead of dying instantly, like in the film. Also, Streicher made a bigger performance in the gallows than simply saying `Heil Hitler' before he was hung.All of the Defendants are shown. But some star only briefly. Rudolph Hess, for example, spends most of the film quiet and pretending to be insane. He speaks for about 30 seconds total. That is about the total screen time Robert Ley has before committing suicide. Arthur Seyess-Inquart has only one major scene, and that is when he enters his plea.All in all, Nuremberg is a good movie, with good acting. A great beginners lesson on the trial.
