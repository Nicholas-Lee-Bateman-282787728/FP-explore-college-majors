835490,APPCEHS05VYYX,B0002ILKC2,Amazon Customer,"[8, 10]","I've done the Island Girl Hula Cardio workout three times now and the Abs and Buns workout twice.  I really like them both but so far have enjoyed the Cardio Hula section more simply because I felt the pace of the workout was better.  I purchased these workouts because I wanted something different after doing the 30 Day Shred and Biggest Loser workouts and this is certainly a nice change of pace.  The first time around, I stumbled my way through but not for lack of direction or spot on cuing from Kili-I just lack coordination.  I definitely felt the burn and was perspiring by the end of the dance.  The stretches in the cool down felt soooo good.  Just a few hours later my thighs and gluts were screaming! But I couldn't wait to do it again.  Currently I am sitting at my desk at work moving my hips as I try to mimic the fluid movement of Kili and her dancers.  A few things I will say are that you may not enjoy this if you like hardcore workouts.  I mean seriously this is hula dancing!  If you prefer a relaxing workout that focuses mainly on the abs and lower body and don't mind working out barefoot, then I say try this workout.  If you get easily frustrated or aren't that coordinated you may struggle with this.  Just relax and now it doesn't have to be perfect as you will get better and more fluid with each time through.  I still haven't done the whole dance without missing a couple of steps but I still enjoy the routine and the more I do it the more I sweat and the more I want to come back and do it again.  I've even noticed that I walk differently because my hips are looser from doing this workout and I slouch less as well.  Not too shabby after having done this for just a few days.  The DVD allows choose which section you want to do; warm up, the workout, the dance, or the cool down.  That's helpful if you want to combine both workouts, that way you don't have to go through the entire workout if you don't want to.",4,Great workout for a change of pace,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,1948,"[""'ve"", 'done', 'Island', 'Girl', 'Hula', 'Cardio', 'workout', 'three', 'times', 'now', 'Abs', 'Buns', 'twice', 'really', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Cardio', 'Hula', 'section', 'more', 'simply', 'felt', 'pace', 'workout', 'was', 'better', 'purchased', 'workouts', 'wanted', 'something', 'different', 'doing', '30', 'Day', 'Shred', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'workouts', 'certainly', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'first', 'time', 'stumbled', 'way', 'not', 'lack', 'direction', 'spot', 'cuing', 'Kili-I', 'just', 'lack', 'coordination', 'definitely', 'felt', 'burn', 'was', 'perspiring', 'end', 'dance', 'stretches', 'cool', 'down', 'felt', 'soooo', 'good', 'Just', 'few', 'hours', 'later', 'thighs', 'gluts', 'were', 'screaming', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'do', 'again', 'Currently', 'am', 'sitting', 'desk', 'work', 'moving', 'hips', 'try', 'mimic', 'fluid', 'movement', 'Kili', 'dancers', 'few', 'things', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'like', 'hardcore', 'workouts', 'mean', 'seriously', 'hula', 'dancing', 'prefer', 'relaxing', 'workout', 'mainly', 'abs', 'lower', 'body', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'working', 'barefoot', 'then', 'say', 'try', 'workout', 'get', 'easily', 'frustrated', 'are', ""n't"", 'coordinated', 'may', 'struggle', 'Just', 'relax', 'now', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'perfect', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'more', 'fluid', 'time', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'whole', 'dance', 'missing', 'couple', 'steps', 'still', 'enjoy', 'routine', 'more', 'do', 'more', 'sweat', 'more', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'again', ""'ve"", 'even', 'noticed', 'walk', 'differently', 'hips', 'are', 'looser', 'doing', 'workout', 'slouch', 'less', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'too', 'shabby', 'having', 'done', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'DVD', 'allows', 'choose', 'section', 'want', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'workout', 'dance', 'cool', 'down', 'helpful', 'want', 'combine', 'workouts', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'go', 'entire', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'want']",N/A
835491,A15CLB0OADMQKA,B0002ILKC2,Cali Girl,"[1, 1]","The instructor and her two dancers are incredibly graceful and it's easy to tell that they've been doing this for years.  Dancing is as natural to them as breathing.  In fact, they make it look so calm and simple, that it frustrated me when I realized ""Oh, yeah, I'm not them"".  But the routines are fairly easy, it will just take practice.  My main reason for wanting to try hula dancing is that it seemed a bit easier on the knees than my other dance workout DVDs. But if you have any knee or ankle strains already you may not be able to do this. With nearly every step you are putting a constant, steady pressure on your knees and legs.  So this is a great DVD and the scenery is gorgeous and the dance is fun, but it's a tough work out!",5,"Fun, but kinda hard",1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,740,"['instructor', 'two', 'dancers', 'are', 'incredibly', 'graceful', 'easy', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'years', 'Dancing', 'as', 'natural', 'breathing', 'fact', 'make', 'look', 'so', 'calm', 'simple', 'frustrated', 'when', 'realized', 'Oh', 'yeah', ""'m"", 'not', 'routines', 'are', 'fairly', 'easy', 'will', 'just', 'take', 'practice', 'main', 'reason', 'wanting', 'try', 'hula', 'dancing', 'seemed', 'bit', 'easier', 'knees', 'other', 'dance', 'DVDs', 'have', 'knee', 'ankle', 'strains', 'already', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'nearly', 'step', 'are', 'putting', 'constant', 'steady', 'pressure', 'knees', 'legs', 'great', 'DVD', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'dance', 'fun', 'tough', 'work', 'out']",N/A
835492,A846NR0T5U8GT,B0002ILKC2,Gia V.,"[4, 5]","A review that encompasses both hula and tahitian videos (I didn't want to post in four different places):OK! So I have to say I was a bit doubtful regarding the whole 'tahitian dance makes you fit' thing (I've seen some pretty chunky gals doing this dance, and granted, their hip flexibility is far superior than mine, but they are nonetheless, not in very great shape). Kili of course has abs that could probably knock you unconscious but, at the same time, they wouldn't choose someone who didn't have a 34 pack for a fitness dvd now would they? Anyway, I started off with abs & buns and moved on to Tahitian hip hop (not very hip-hoppish), one after the other. I got through abs and buns without much trouble, except I had done some exercising the day before so my legs were pretty sore (I haven't exercised in a while...) and I couldn't really do many of squatting repetitions because my legs would hurt like no ones business. Although I was able to continue on to the next video without there being much of an issue, I will say that I sweated like no ones business. I mean, I don't usually sweat, but I SWEATED BAD. It was kind of gross. I don't know if it's the fact that it's 100 degrees where I live or if it's the area where I did it, OR if it was the actual video, but like I said, it was gross. Anyway, it's actually a pretty fun set of videos. The whole hip thing is beyond me, though. Maybe once I keep doing it I'll notice some more extensive hip flexibility (hopefully because it looks REALLY cool), but for right now, I don't have much, so it's a little difficult to keep up with the gals, especially when they walk and sway (you want me to walk, move my arms and sway my hips all AT THE SAME TIME- WUT?). Like I said, hopefully, I'll get it down at least half-way to their hip flexibility because doing these moves is pretty awesome. You'll have a lot of fun, at least I did. It's not something that, say, an advanced, super ripped exerciser will find challenging (except the hip swaying), but for people who aren't anywhere near Kili's appearance, I'll say you'll sweat, your legs will be sore, and you'll have FUN! I did two and the time just flew by. Of course there were moments when I had to stop and wipe the sweat off (sorry, I can't walk, sway, move arms and wipe sweat off all at the same time) and at times they went a little too quickly but other than that, it was pretty decent, fun experience and I think it's worth the cheap price. It's a fun alternative if you're not feeling Jillian Michaels and her dead lifts. I'll let you know tomorrow if it kills my abs though... I know my legs will be dead, but the abs... I don't know... I'm really looking forward to doing the cardio hula and tahitian cardio on Sunday!",4,Pretty fun,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,2743,"['review', 'hula', 'tahitian', 'videos', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'post', 'four', 'different', 'places', 'OK', 'So', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'doubtful', 'regarding', 'whole', ""'tahitian"", 'dance', 'fit', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'pretty', 'chunky', 'gals', 'doing', 'dance', 'granted', 'hip', 'flexibility', 'far', 'superior', 'mine', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'not', 'very', 'great', 'shape', 'Kili', 'course', 'abs', 'could', 'probably', 'knock', 'unconscious', 'same', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'choose', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', '34', 'pack', 'fitness', 'dvd', 'now', 'would', 'Anyway', 'started', 'off', 'abs', 'buns', 'moved', 'Tahitian', 'hip', 'hop', 'not', 'very', 'hip-hoppish', 'one', 'other', 'got', 'abs', 'buns', 'much', 'trouble', 'had', 'done', 'exercising', 'day', 'legs', 'were', 'pretty', 'sore', 'have', ""n't"", 'exercised', 'while', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'many', 'squatting', 'repetitions', 'legs', 'would', 'hurt', 'ones', 'business', 'was', 'able', 'continue', 'next', 'video', 'there', 'being', 'much', 'issue', 'will', 'say', 'sweated', 'ones', 'business', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'sweat', 'SWEATED', 'BAD', 'was', 'kind', 'gross', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'fact', '100', 'degrees', 'where', 'live', 'area', 'where', 'did', 'was', 'actual', 'video', 'said', 'was', 'gross', 'Anyway', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fun', 'set', 'videos', 'whole', 'hip', 'thing', 'though', 'Maybe', 'once', 'keep', 'doing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'more', 'extensive', 'hip', 'flexibility', 'hopefully', 'REALLY', 'cool', 'right', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'little', 'difficult', 'keep', 'up', 'gals', 'especially', 'when', 'walk', 'sway', 'want', 'walk', 'move', 'arms', 'sway', 'hips', 'AT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'TIME-', 'WUT', 'said', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'down', 'least', 'half-way', 'hip', 'flexibility', 'doing', 'moves', 'pretty', 'awesome', ""'ll"", 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'least', 'did', 'not', 'something', 'say', 'advanced', 'super', 'ripped', 'exerciser', 'will', 'find', 'challenging', 'hip', 'swaying', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'Kili', 'appearance', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'ll"", 'sweat', 'legs', 'will', 'be', 'sore', ""'ll"", 'have', 'FUN', 'did', 'two', 'time', 'just', 'flew', 'course', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'had', 'stop', 'wipe', 'sweat', 'off', 'sorry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'walk', 'sway', 'move', 'arms', 'wipe', 'sweat', 'same', 'time', 'times', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'quickly', 'other', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'fun', 'experience', 'think', 'cheap', 'price', 'fun', 'alternative', ""'re"", 'not', 'feeling', 'Jillian', 'Michaels', 'dead', 'lifts', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'tomorrow', 'abs', 'know', 'legs', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'abs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'doing', 'cardio', 'hula', 'tahitian', 'cardio', 'Sunday']",N/A

IN the beginning, I was only able to do about 10 minutes of this program.  After about 3 months, I was able to do the entire program.  Now I use the DANCING WITH KILI chapter as a warm-up/cool-down for other programs that focus on lower/upper body strength-training.  Sometimes, in the afternoon, I do 10 minutes of hula with Kili simply for the sheer pleasure of moving my hips!  In spite of some of the negative reviews on Kili's other hula dvd's, I have purchased all of them! I love the diversity and the fact that I can adapt them to suit my personal needs once the hula 'motions' have been mastered.I have been doing yoga for 5 years and qigong for about 4 years.  I was amazed to discover that hula (as done by Kili)allows me to move QI as I dance!  I love this aspect of hula!  Also, my joints have loosened far more rapidly with hula than they ever did with yoga.
