Here's why I hate this film:Scary-----All of the dolphins in this film have sharp teeth and the camera tends to work in a frightening angle to show off the teeth. Although even the protagonist is a bit frightening, he's a happy elf compared to the demonicly wretched evil dolphin. He's dark, his ""brow"" is angled deeply and his teeth are always present.Bad Rendering-------------This looks like a single-pass pre-render. The water doesn't interact with the characters, the skies look like fake Bryce skies (Bryce is a 3D animation/picture-making tool used by amateursBryce 5).Bad Animation-------------The camera angles often look like they were accidentally placed. And the animation of the characters looks unnatural (except, for the most part, their swimming).Story Didn't Grab Me--------------------I admit, I only got 15 or 20 minutes in before I turned it off.

It drove me crazy.  If it drives you crazy, be less lazy than me and take your kid to a park.  She still watches and enjoys it on occassion at the age of 6.  But my friend, the 42 year old arthouse movie fan was disappointed by its total lack of family reunion dinner scenes set in Europe.  Be warned.Animation: Yes, not everyone has access to a $100 million plus budget like Pixar or Disney.  Who'd a thunk?  I grew up on Spiderman cartoons where static pictures were slid across the screen, and clips were reused repeatedly on every episode.  I think you could condense 13 episodes of that series into 3 if you edited them to show each piece of animation only once.  Did I care?  Heck, no.  And at least it wasn't that Eskimo cartoon where they use human lips instead of animation either. The animation in Dolphin is serviceable, and kids the age it is made for won't care.  Or if they do, they're way too cynical for their age.  Shame shame.  Frankly the weird animation sort of fits the weird storyline.Story: Remember those weird cartoons and kids shows you grew up on?  Puff the Magic Dragon?  That surreal Raggedy Anne and Andy cartoon with the floppy blue donkey?  The Magic Railroad?  Dr Snuggles?  Anything with the name Krofft attached?  Re-edited imported Japanese cartoons?  They were like bad trips half the time. And they never insulted your intelligence. Remember all the scary themes they had?  Well, to quote Maurice Sendak: &#34;I remember my own childhood vividly...I knew terrible things. But I knew I mustn't let adults know I knew. It would scare them&#34;  That's something sorely lacking with kids programming these days, much as I love Yo Gabba Gabba. Teletubbies, Night Garden, etc, are way too minimalist and cutesy to compare. Yes, this film has a scary barricuda in it.  It also has deep philosophical themes and positive messages.  And it doesn't always make the greatest sense.  But at least it isn't some shallow toy tie-in or a pre-teen soap opera or a quasi videogame.

It reminds me of Finding Nemo but from a dolphin's perspective.  Daniel Alexander Dolphin is a young dolphin who wants more from life than just working.  He is a dreamer as they say and he is the only one left with dreams.  Daniel's dream is to ride the best wave in the ocean, it seems dumb to me but for a dolphin it is probably a great dream.  So he leaves his community and goes on a search, meeting good and bad characters along the way.  About 30 minutes into it there is a scary fish thing, but my 2 and 3 year old thought it looked like an alligator and weren't scared.  Daniel learns to follow his dreams and heart, teamwork, friendship and more.  It is a cute movie, and great if you are looking for something different than the typical Disney films.  I do wish there was more interaction with other sea creatures but the movie does introduce a good selection of fish and sea life.  My boys liked it and wanted to watch it again right away!Oh and I read the 3 negative reviews and I don't get them.  The movie is not that bad, nor is the fish that scary.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 0]","Poor reviews of the animation and writing for this film are correct, although it is on par for most straight-to-DVD/online releases. Both the writing and animation lack the cleverness and depth of a typical big-budget theatrical release. However, my own twin 5-year olds didn't mind that a bit, and I appreciated the attempt at a spiritual/inspirational non-denominational film for kids.This film centers on Daniel Alexander the dolphin, who is a dreamer, and longs to escape from the lagoon that he and his pod live in, and that the pod leader forbids him from leaving, for reasons Daniel doesn't know. Daniel is called by the 'voice of the sea' (who appears as a beam of light) and a angel-like 'messenger' in the form of a manta ray. He decides to leave his pod and set out on his own quest for 'the perfect wave' to surf. Along the way he encounters many dangerous things, including an extremely scary monster from the deep (a bit too scary actually, for very young kids), and a misguided octopus aka false prophet. If all this sounds a bit like a spiritual/new-age cliche, it basically is, but again, my own kids loved it, and there are few spiritually-themed animated films around that aren't pushing a particular religion.

1388058,A2RHV42BTJSVON,B00475B0H6,"Liolania ""In2Jesus""","[0, 0]","The whole reason I ended up watching this film was because I read so many bad reviews on Netflix, and I am like ""I gotta see this.""  That and it was about a Dolphin who pursues his dreams against all odds.  :)The main problem with this film seemed to be the poor English dubs and a story that never quite pulls itself together.  I was able to get passed the poor dubbing, as I watch a lot of badly dubbed anime on Netflix, they have only just recently started posting subs for some animes instead of dubs, which is nice, but I can live with bad dubbing if I have to, so this did not bother, but I can definitely see it getting on other people's nerves as it had a lot of sub-par voice performances by almost everyone except maybe the voice of Daniel, he was decently voiced.  The story itself was very loose, it did often feel like a string of random events, it just never quite glues itself together, the only connecting piece is Daniel's dream and those he inspires along the way.Some people might call the animation poor, but for its $3,000,000 budget, I felt the animation was very well done, the Dolphins could have been rendered a little better, as at times they seems to clash with their surroundings, but the water looked great, especially the surface, it looked very realistic and I often felt I was looking at real water and waves.  Some of the characters looked very cartoony, and others not much, at times I think its major flaw was, it felt like there were two different animation styles fighting with each other, but most of the time, it wasn't bad enough that it hindered my enjoyment of the film.It is the message of pursuing one's dreams that drew me to the film.  I am a person just like Daniel, I have started pursuing my dreams, and in-turn have been showing my family that it IS possible to follow your dreams, and some of them are following in suit.  The passion of another person pursuing their dreams is what drives other people to follow their's, and this was the most successful element of the film, although the story was very loose, it stayed very consistent in showing that Daniel really did awaken other people to their dreams, everywhere he went he talked to others about what their dreams were, and if they didn't know, he pushed them to find a dream.  It seems clear by the end that purpose of him finding the wave was the journey and everyone he taught to dream with him along the way, which exactly what life is like, its not about the destination, but the journey.  By the end of the film, I can honestly say, it did inspire me even more to keep pursuing my dreams despite all opposition and to stay positive in the face of defeat!The message and heart of this film is what moves this up to 3 stars, the story telling problems, bad sight-gags (eating coins and breathing farts), sub-par dubbing, poor translation (some of the dialogue is laughably bad), all keep this from rising any higher.  But if you are like me, and you need an uplifting film to watch and the scary moments with the main villain wont bother you (children over 6yrs should be fine), then you might enjoy this film, just keep in mind its foreign roots and low budget and you should be fine.God Bless ~Amy",3,"Good Message, so-so Film.",1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,3210,"['whole', 'reason', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'reviews', 'Netflix', 'am', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'was', 'Dolphin', 'who', 'dreams', 'odds', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'poor', 'English', 'dubs', 'story', 'never', 'quite', 'together', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'passed', 'poor', 'dubbing', 'watch', 'lot', 'badly', 'dubbed', 'anime', 'Netflix', 'have', 'only', 'just', 'recently', 'started', 'posting', 'subs', 'animes', 'instead', 'dubs', 'nice', 'can', 'live', 'bad', 'dubbing', 'have', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'getting', 'other', 'people', 'nerves', 'had', 'lot', 'sub-par', 'voice', 'performances', 'almost', 'everyone', 'maybe', 'voice', 'Daniel', 'was', 'decently', 'voiced', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'loose', 'did', 'often', 'feel', 'string', 'random', 'events', 'just', 'never', 'quite', 'glues', 'together', 'only', 'connecting', 'piece', 'Daniel', 'dream', 'way.Some', 'people', 'might', 'call', 'animation', 'poor', '3,000,000', 'budget', 'felt', 'animation', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Dolphins', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rendered', 'little', 'better', 'times', 'clash', 'surroundings', 'water', 'looked', 'great', 'especially', 'surface', 'looked', 'very', 'realistic', 'often', 'felt', 'was', 'looking', 'real', 'water', 'waves', 'characters', 'looked', 'very', 'cartoony', 'others', 'not', 'much', 'times', 'think', 'major', 'flaw', 'was', 'felt', 'were', 'two', 'different', 'animation', 'styles', 'fighting', 'other', 'most', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'hindered', 'enjoyment', 'film.It', 'message', 'pursuing', 'one', 'dreams', 'drew', 'film', 'am', 'person', 'just', 'Daniel', 'have', 'started', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'in-turn', 'have', 'been', 'showing', 'family', 'possible', 'follow', 'dreams', 'are', 'following', 'suit', 'passion', 'person', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'follow', 'was', 'most', 'successful', 'element', 'film', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'loose', 'stayed', 'very', 'consistent', 'showing', 'Daniel', 'really', 'did', 'awaken', 'other', 'people', 'dreams', 'everywhere', 'went', 'talked', 'others', 'what', 'dreams', 'were', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'pushed', 'find', 'dream', 'clear', 'end', 'purpose', 'finding', 'wave', 'was', 'journey', 'everyone', 'taught', 'dream', 'way', 'exactly', 'what', 'life', 'not', 'destination', 'journey', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'did', 'inspire', 'even', 'more', 'keep', 'pursuing', 'dreams', 'opposition', 'stay', 'positive', 'face', 'defeat', 'message', 'heart', 'film', 'what', 'up', '3', 'stars', 'story', 'telling', 'problems', 'bad', 'sight-gags', 'eating', 'coins', 'breathing', 'farts', 'sub-par', 'dubbing', 'poor', 'translation', 'dialogue', 'laughably', 'bad', 'keep', 'rising', 'higher', 'are', 'need', 'uplifting', 'film', 'watch', 'scary', 'moments', 'main', 'villain', 'bother', 'children', '6yrs', 'should', 'be', 'fine', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'film', 'just', 'keep', 'mind', 'foreign', 'roots', 'low', 'budget', 'should', 'be', 'fine.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

1388060,AHF97M45JFCB,B00475B0H6,ONENEO,"[9, 10]","Dolphin The Story of a Dreamer is a tale of the value of following one's dream against impossible odds and in a way this is a metaphor for what 20th Century Fox was attempting to do with this film.  The dream in this case, of course, was to show Pixar and DreamWorks that investing hundreds of millions in creating original computer-generated feature films is a waste of time and money when all a company has to do is import a foreign CG work, slap a little English vocal track in, and collect the profits.  As such the end result here has more in common with nightmares than it does dreams; particularly for the consumer who dropped good money on this sinker.Based on Sergio Bambaren's 1996 children's novel, Dolphin is a story about a porpoise without a purpose: A young dolphin named Daniel Alexander Dolphin finds himself in a pod of oppressive non-dreamer lagoon dwelling dolphins.  Everything changes one day when a manta ray enters the lagoon to tell Daniel that he is destined for greatness.Ignoring this encounter, the ""voice of the sea"" is forced to intervene by actually telling Daniel that he will be the one to return dreams to all the creatures of the ocean.  How will he accomplish such a lofty ambition you ask? Well apparently he will ""surf the ultimate wave on the day the sun doesn't do what it normally does"".  If that sounds a bit suspect to you, rest assured that is a beautifully accurate summation of all that is this film.To cut to the chase, Daniel leaves his pod and safe life in the lagoon behind to... Find this ultimate wave?  It's never made clear what in the world he is trying to accomplish. And even when he finally does surf a big wave on the day of the eclipse, the correlation with how this helped all creatures far and wide to dream is about as abstract as say, his journeying into outer space may have helped a flea colony living on the back of a mangy coyote in New Mexico to solve complex mathematical equations.  Either way you'll find yourself saying ""huh?""Rather than give the viewer some semblance of a plot structure, Dolphin The Story of a Dreamer (DTSOAD) simply strings together an hour and a half's worth of scenes in the hope that a story will somehow reveal itself along the way.Clearly attempts to aid the mess along into coherence were made in the form of a narrator and dialog so painfully drawn out and simplistic that a young child could potentially find some enjoyment.  However even appealing to the younger set is flawed with this one as many of the chase sequences are simply too dark and terrifying for kids.Attempts at humor are absolutely disastrous throughout.  We are given just about every clich&eacute; in modern animation: young wide-eyed characters with annoying voices, flatulence jokes (laced with the un-child-friendly F-word to boot), and annoying sidekicks.  Adults will find themselves unable to even smirk at that gags contained within much less chuckle and children will be far too bored with the pacing to appreciate the hacky moments.Contrary to what you suspect, the visuals of DTSOAD are decent.  No Pixar doesn't need make plans to revisit Finding Nemo to try to compete, but the lighting effects are solid, the color pallet bright and thorough and the textures consistently passable.  The surface shots are especially noteworthy for their realistic waves/ frothy surf.  The animation itself isn't too shabby either, with aquatic animals moving accurately/ swimming with life-like propulsion throughout.  Espcially for a film with a modest $3-million budget, there is little to complain about in the audio/visual department.However, don't mistake a lack of audio complaints to be mistaken for commendable acting performances.  In fact, aside from one of the most meandering, nonsensical plots in the history of film, DTSOAD makes use of some of the most flat and lifeless vocal performances to match.  In the actors' defense, the script provides very little to work with here.  Couple substandard writing to the additional task of trying to sync English vocals to the original foreign-language mouth flaps of the animatics and it becomes clear that the acting was basically doomed from the get-go.The title character's vocal work is passable thanks to English ADR director Robbie Daymond's rendition but the awkward dialog itself more than undoes any real praise here.Judy Kellem is credited with having to perform the arduous task of developing the English screenplay and was surely aware of the fact that successful scenes in film rely heavily upon timing.  The trouble with taking a piece originally created in a foreign language is that even when you are able to match the mouth movement on a scene for scene basis, capturing proper timing is all but impossible in the translation.  As a result here scenes drag on ridiculously longer than what feels natural.While I really despise slamming any product in my critiques as there is untold toil and tears that goes along with taking any product to market, the sad reality is that DTSOAD will likely disappoint viewers of all ages (especially those who have come to expect great things in the CG animated feature film department from the likes of Disney/ Pixar, DreamWorks and so on).The formula of taking a foreign computer-generated film and adapting it to domestic viewers has failed many times in the past (reference Impy's Island, The Snurks, or Doogal for further proof of this phenomenon) and Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer, sadly, simply adds more evidence to this reality.  The fact that 20th Century Fox came on board to distribute this catastrophe (and just prior to the Holiday season no less) really speaks on behalf of the company's desperation in trying to secure a
