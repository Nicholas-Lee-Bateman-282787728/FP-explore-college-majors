272784,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,6301928679,Bold Consumer,"[2, 2]","This is a true story of a Jewish man who had been raised in Egypt and was recruited by Mossad to be a spy in Syria. He is given credit for some of the success Israel had in the Six-Day War, especially on the Golan Heights. He spoke at least 5 languages and had an extraordinary memory that he had used as a low-level accountant in the textile business.Anyone watching this movie has to be very interested in recent Israeli-Syrian relations. The quality of the movie is poor, although the acting is excellent. The movie is just old, and shows it. It's worth watching though if you are very interested in Israel, Syria, or history of the middle east in general.During one part of the movie the two main characters visited the Golan Heights. I was there last year and had an opportunity to go down into the bunkers. That's an amazing area where you can stand in one place and see Israel, Syria, and, if you squint a little, Lebanon. The view is breathtaking in its significance for warfare. In all the books, articles and videos I've gone through in my own studies,  I've never seen the Golan Heights portrayed the way they showed it in The Impossible Spy. I will never forget that part of the movie. I also appreciate the extra information provided by another reviewer about the tree planting in that same area, to indicate where the guns were. What an amazing story! Thank you to that reviewer for sharing that story.The movie seems to try to portray both sides fairly. It left me a little more informed about history and, of course, very sad about all the death and suffering.",5,"For Those Interested In The Modern History of Israel and Syria, and the Golan Heights In Particular",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,1576,"['true', 'story', 'Jewish', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'Egypt', 'was', 'recruited', 'Mossad', 'be', 'spy', 'Syria', 'given', 'credit', 'success', 'Israel', 'had', 'Six-Day', 'War', 'especially', 'Golan', 'Heights', 'spoke', 'least', '5', 'languages', 'had', 'extraordinary', 'memory', 'had', 'used', 'low-level', 'accountant', 'textile', 'business.Anyone', 'watching', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'interested', 'recent', 'Israeli-Syrian', 'relations', 'quality', 'movie', 'poor', 'acting', 'excellent', 'movie', 'just', 'old', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'very', 'interested', 'Israel', 'Syria', 'history', 'middle', 'east', 'general.During', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'visited', 'Golan', 'Heights', 'was', 'there', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'opportunity', 'go', 'down', 'bunkers', 'amazing', 'area', 'where', 'can', 'stand', 'one', 'place', 'see', 'Israel', 'Syria', 'squint', 'little', 'Lebanon', 'view', 'breathtaking', 'significance', 'warfare', 'books', 'articles', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'own', 'studies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Golan', 'Heights', 'portrayed', 'way', 'showed', 'Impossible', 'Spy', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'part', 'movie', 'also', 'appreciate', 'extra', 'information', 'provided', 'reviewer', 'tree', 'planting', 'same', 'area', 'indicate', 'where', 'guns', 'were', 'What', 'amazing', 'story', 'Thank', 'reviewer', 'sharing', 'story.The', 'movie', 'try', 'portray', 'sides', 'fairly', 'left', 'little', 'more', 'informed', 'history', 'course', 'very', 'sad', 'death', 'suffering']",Impossible Spy VHS

272789,A2RV78U1G3MGLH,6301928679,Fredrick L. Murphy,"[9, 11]","This video has somewhat B-rated quality, but it's very old (& says it was made for British TV or something)so you aren't going to get the greatest quality.  It starts out with hokey film-tactics, but then gets better.The generic content/story is very good....gives you some perspectives about how others work at their jobs & contribute to society around you and do things so that ""the rest of us can go on with life as normal as possible."" This is a pretty clean movie from what we noticed the first time watching it, safe for families & individuals in a general way.  This is not a religious theme movie at all, outside of the generic theme of Land being a homeland to the Israelite people.This is an enjoyable film, based on a true story, and helps you understand some of the pressures that countries & their defense departments/agents must go thru.  Also, the ""human side"" of a relationship between opposing sides is presented --the immovable difference between an Arab & an Israelite who are competing for the same piece of Land.  Men are seen developing ""mutual"" respect and certain feelings of ""friendship"" towards each other.  It's a sad thing that men must fight, indeed.My family enjoys historical films that show more and more puzzle pieces about the Land of Israel and the people of Israel.  This film focuses on the Syrian-Israeli conflict, through the life of a new spy.  The newly inducted spy incidentally makes choices that destroy his marriage due to ""practical abandonment"" you might say -without the wife having any inkling of this being the chosen path.  Personally i believe there's a difference between a man who joins the army, then gets married with his wife understanding the ups & downs of an army marriage beforehand ....VERSES a man who marries his wife and sneakily joins the army and sees her and their newborn only a handful of times in several years...which means the wife and child have been unnecessarily hurt.  ""Greater Good"" themes are toyed with in this marital struggle.Being a Bible believer, i'm reminded that until Israel's neighbors accept the role that Israel is meant to have within the Covenanted Land.....and until Israel walks in true Torah the majority of the time....& seeking to be a light to the nations, the opposing parties will never get along nor benefit each other.  May Moshiach Return quickly, even in our days.The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting."" We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people. You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible. As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth. So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film. There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others). We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

272802,A2A1XYSB692L6J,6301928679,"Patricia ""A Reader""","[2, 6]","This is a very well-done movie, about Eli Cohen, a happily married accountant, recruited by his country for spying activities, who, after some years as a very successful spy, is discovered.  Everyone -- from Eli Wallach, as Cohen's spy-boss, to Mical Bet-Adam as his wife, to Sasson Gabai as the Syrian General Haled, whom Cohen, as a spy, cons, to the two little girls who play Cohen's daughters -- are very good.  Unlike other Israeli films I have seen, this film takes less time for propaganda and ramming ideals down the viewer's mind, (the ""boy-loves-girl-loves-Israel"" scenario) -- than it does for scenes for real emotions, between individuals, to show through and shine.)The title, ""The Impossible Spy"", is somewhat of a misnomer.  Was he ""impossible"", as a willful child is said to be ""impossible""?  Obviously not.  Mr. Cohen answered the call of Knesset and Country, willingly and patriotically.  A better name for this movie, I think, would have been ""The Incredible Spy"" -- because the idea of a true story, about taking a civilian accountant, and turning him into a top-notch spy is, indeed just short of unbelievable.This movie is based upon a true story.  The producers and writers of this film deserve kudos in many areas, (a realistic, involving and moving script, great casting, scenery, directing, and a deeply moving, yet unobtrusive background score) -- but the two that shine most for me are 1) Mr. Cohen is played by John Shea, who -- to my knowledge, anyway -- is NOT Jewish.  The basic similarity of ALL human beings, (with their innate desire for freedom and dignity), is thus wonderfully displayed).  2) In one of the final scenes, it is revealed on the radio that many official and governmental agencies, world-wide, called for clemency in Cohen's case.  These included the Vatican (!), and Switzerland (!!).  As I've always suspected, the GOODNESS, (in MOST people), will totally overwhelm any prejudices they may have been taught as children, and so this mentioning of those who demanded Cohen's release, puts a nice lie to the idea some Jews have that ""there's an anti-semite behind every tree.""  Nope.  Seems those forests have all been turned into nice little theoretical villages, wherein Christians, Jews, Moslems, and others -- who view each other as fellow human beings, and not as ""enemies"".  The reaction to his former(?) friend's final moments, of Gabai, (General Haled), show that not all Arabs are monsters, either.  A wonderful, and insightful attitude for an Israel film -- one which I hope will be continued in the future.As it was Israel which, by all accounts, was first attacked during the Six-Day war, (which was fought two years after Cohen's death, but for which, Israel had obtained much vital information, through Cohen's spying), it is a sad state of affairs that Cohen -- a civilian accountant -- was executed for his spying activities.  But the question remains: is Israel ALWAYS right in it's dealings with its Arab neighbours?  Surely, crimes of inhumanity have been committed by both sides, and are continuing to be committed, even as I write this review.  One hopes, ultimately, for peace and understanding, (perhaps with only a two-state solution as the utimate ideal).  Let those who wish to live in the Middle East, stay there, and those who WISH to migrate, do so.  But the forcing of ""diaspora"" Arabs, and ""diaspora"" Jews, to move to an area, when and where they do not wish to, makes for unhappiness to all.  I have always felt that part of the strenght of the Jewish people IS that they do not all dwell in one place.  Suppose, (Heaven forbid), a bomb was dropped on Israel, destroying all people in that country.If ALL the Jews lived there, it would be the end of the Jewish people as well.  However, as things stand now, many Jews are happily living -- secularly, or religiously, as THEY choose -- in many areas that are NOT in Israel.  There is no need whatsoever, in my opinion, to dislodge innocent Arabs from their homes in Israel, to make room for Jews who do not want to move there!  I thought it was my own idea, that God had made so many different religions, to test Humanity see how we all got along with each other -- but recently, a Moslem neighbour has told me this very idea is actually in the Koran!If we leave emotionalism and hoary tradition aside, and just think about individuals, and honour EACH individual's desires to live their own lives, as they so choose, there will be far less -- if any wars, and sacrifices such as Eli Cohen's (and his family's), will not have to be made.  The words of PROFESSOR JAMES SHENTON, in his landmark, 1960's Public TV History of the United States series, describing the definition of democracy, come again and again to my mind.  ""The Definition of Democracy"", said Dr. Shenton, ""is this:  My Freedom To Swing My Arm Ends Where Your Nose Begins"".  Let people live were they individually wish to.  Respect each other's traditions and ways.  Realize that individal freedom is SO much more important than ethnic tribalism.  So that sacrifices like Eli Cohen's, (and his family's), need never be made again-- by anyone!",5,"T E N S E, .T R A G I C...S T O R Y...H O L D S...Y O U R....I N T E R E S T",1275177600,"05 30,

He successfully did so by befriending and subsidizing (with Israeli government money) the the then outlawed Baath Party of Syria.  He made his first contact with a Baath Party representative in Argentina.  When the Baath Party eventually came to power in Syria, Elie Cohen followed.  Being Syrian born, and raised in Egypt, this devout Jew, fluent in Arabic and at least four other languages, rose from a job as a lowly accountant at a grocery chain, to nearly become the deputy minister of defense in Syria.  Before being discovered, probably because of his false overconfidence in transmitting Morse code messages to Tel Aviv, he became, and still is, one of the most celebrated human intelligence figures in world history.
