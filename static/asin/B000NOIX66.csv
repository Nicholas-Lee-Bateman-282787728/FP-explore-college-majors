I bought season 1 of this fantasticshow and was so impressed with the loving care given to it'srestoration that I preordered season 2 immediately when it wasavailable. For a show that was originally recorded in mono theDolby digital 5.1 remix sounds impressive. Visually, I dareanyone to compare the picture quality with anything producedin the last 20 years. The colors are vibrant (damn, that Barbara Bainwas a sexy woman)and sharp. Compare this to the poor job FOXhas done with it's releases of classic older shows and you canappreciate the quality in Paramounts releases (they did a great job onseason 1 of Hawaii 5-0, too). St Elsewhere was probablythe finest medical drama ever produced for TV (certainly a damn sightbetter than crap like Gray's Anatomy) and Fox slapped it together withabsolutely no respect! The picture is fuzzy and the sound is muddy onmost of the episodes. M.I. is at least 15 years older than St. Elsewhereand there is absolutely no comparison to the quality. Whoevers runningthe TV/DVD division at FOX ought to be sent to purgatory for the disrespectshown to it's MTM collection alone. This was probably the greatest studio forquality tv in the 70's and 80's. I almost hate to open my box set of HillStreet Blues!Okay, getting back to the show. You could see Martin Landau's Talentemerging that would lead to his well deserved Oscar later in his career.Peter Graves would inherit the lead role (from an equally competant StevenHill) and be forever linked to baby boomer memories.

1058667,A8T93X5EEIFL,B000NOIX66,C. C. Black,"[9, 9]","With its second season (1967-68) Bruce Geller's ""Mission: Impossible"" hit its stride. This was the season in which ace writers William Read Woodfield and Allan Balter took the series' reins in hand and never let go (until, sadly, about eight episodes into the third season). With Woodfield and Balter creating scripts and editing all others, the classic ""M:I"" format was set: The Big Con, rigged by the ""Impossible Missions Force,"" in which the heaviest of heavies ended up undermining or eliminating one another. This is also the season in which Peter Graves first (and seamlessly) took over as team leader Jim Phelps, Martin Landau committed himself to the series as the indispensable cast member he was, and all five regulars--Graves, Landau (as Rollin Hand), Barbara Bain (Cinammon Carter), Greg Morris (Barney Collier), and Peter Lupus (Willy Armitidge)--came together in every episode as an inseparable team. This season also gave us some of the series' finest and most memorable episodes: ""The Seal"" (a ""Topkapi"" caper starring a trained tabby), ""The Council"" (a stellar two-parter, recut and released in Europe as a feature, ""Mission: Impossible vs. The Mob""), ""The Photographer"" (the IMF stages, for a traitorous audience of two, the end of the world by nuclear destruction), and ""The Killing"" (a ghost story done up in splendid ""Mission"" style). Emmy Nominations and Awards abounded.Two final notes: First, this is television that has to be watched and paid attention to. It is utterly entertaining and engrossing, but treats viewers as intelligent beings who can follow intricate plotting that is highly visual, with minimal exposition. Second: Forget the recent, self-indulgent Tom Cruise spectacles and return to the original. This, and this alone, is ""Mission: Impossible"" as Bruce Geller created it.

1058679,A2MNB9PF4QMK9P,B000NOIX66,"givbatam3 ""givbatam3""","[26, 30]","With this second season of Mission: Impossible we see Peter Gravesintroduced as head of the Impossible Missions Force, in the roleof Jim Phelps, replacing Steven Hill as Dan Briggs.  The Dan Briggscharacter is more cerebral, the Jim Phelps character is more physical.Both characters have their supporters, although I tend  to preferJim Phelps.  It is noteworthy that I don't believe there is anyother television series that could replace its lead actor and nothave it affect the shows quality or popularity. This is becauseMI is ""plot driven"" rather than ""character driven"". Indeed, two morecentral characters would leave after season 3 (Rollin and Cinammon) andyet the series would go on for several more seasons, indicatingthe outstanding quality of the plots, direction and production.In general, I feel the overall quality of the series improved in thesecond and third seasons.  There are episodes in the first season thatare as good as any ever produced (e.g. Operation Rogosz, The Carriers,The Frame as well as the pilot episode), but there were a good numberof weaker stories.  The second season sees an overall stronger effort.Whereas the first season still has some 1960's-staple car chases, shootouts and fist fights, these pretty much disappear in the second season and the emphasis is on outwitting the enemy with clever plots and ingenious gadgets.  Especially noteworthy is ""Trial By Fury"" which is an especially intensestory, masterfully directed by Leonard J Horn who also did the equally intense ""OperationRogosz"", ""The Photographer"" with a great performance by Anthony Zerbe who plays the son of a convicted atomic scientist out for revenge, and an unusual episode called ""The Town"" where Jim is drugged and held prisonerby an evil enemy agent played by the otherwise grandfatherly Will Geer.Seeing masterpiece television series like this made 40 years ago can only make us lament the dismal state of the art today.",5,Just Gets Better and Better,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,1933,"['second', 'season', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'see', 'Peter', 'Gravesintroduced', 'head', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'roleof', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'replacing', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'Dan', 'Briggs', 'Dan', 'Briggscharacter', 'more', 'cerebral', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'character', 'more', 'physical.Both', 'characters', 'have', 'supporters', 'tend', 'preferJim', 'Phelps', 'noteworthy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'television', 'series', 'could', 'replace', 'lead', 'actor', 'nothave', 'affect', 'shows', 'quality', 'popularity', 'becauseMI', 'plot', 'driven', 'rather', 'character', 'driven', 'Indeed', 'two', 'morecentral', 'characters', 'would', 'leave', 'season', '3', 'Rollin', 'Cinammon', 'andyet', 'series', 'would', 'go', 'several', 'more', 'seasons', 'indicatingthe', 'outstanding', 'quality', 'plots', 'direction', 'production.In', 'general', 'feel', 'overall', 'quality', 'series', 'improved', 'thesecond', 'third', 'seasons', 'are', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'thatare', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'produced', 'e.g', 'Operation', 'Rogosz', 'Carriers', 'Frame', 'as', 'well', 'pilot', 'episode', 'were', 'good', 'numberof', 'weaker', 'stories', 'second', 'season', 'overall', 'stronger', 'first', 'season', 'still', ""1960's-staple"", 'car', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'fist', 'fights', 'pretty', 'much', 'disappear', 'second', 'season', 'emphasis', 'outwitting', 'enemy', 'clever', 'plots', 'ingenious', 'gadgets', 'Especially', 'noteworthy', 'Trial', 'Fury', 'especially', 'intensestory', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'Leonard', 'J', 'Horn', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'equally', 'intense', 'OperationRogosz', 'Photographer', 'great', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'who', 'son', 'convicted', 'atomic', 'scientist', 'revenge', 'unusual', 'episode', 'called', 'Town', 'where', 'Jim', 'drugged', 'held', 'prisonerby', 'evil', 'enemy', 'agent', 'played', 'otherwise', 'grandfatherly', 'Will', 'Geer.Seeing', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'series', 'made', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'lament', 'dismal', 'state', 'art', 'today']",Mission: Impossible - The Second TV Season

It's humorous to watch them now if you remember watching them back in the day when they aired on prime time tv. Now, there's a refreshing quaintness - the vintage cars, the 60s fashions, phonograph records that are played on actual turntables, ribbon typewriters, payphone calls that cost only a dime, US currency still backed by gold safely guarded at Fort Knox, endless war against the international communist conspiracy, and the now-world-famous self-destructing reel-to-reel tapes ensconced in recondite places. These twenty-five shows on 7 CDs are a light-hearted romp.The only downside I remark is that our taste in programming has matured since the 60s, so while fun to watch I doubt these programs hold up to repeated viewing - (my standard acid test for quality programming). That said, the stories are plot-driven and character-driven rather than special effects-driven, which is another nostalgic breath of fresh air.As always, Mr Phelps' gazes down at the San Francisco skyline in deep thought beside his chess board. As always, pictures of the veteran operatives (Rollin Hand, Cinnamon Carter, Willy Armitage, Barney Collier) lay on the table beside him:""As always, if you or any member of your IMF team is caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

Although Mr. Hill did a fine job, I would venture to say that most of us who remember the series place Mr. Graves as the head of the MI force.For those of you who think of MI based on the Tom Cruise movies, this is entirely different (and much, much better). The television series is NOT comprised of a bunch of ""flash/bang"" scenes slapped together in a two-hour film clip designed to make a buck. The TV series was an intelligent attempt (which succeeded for the most part) in portraying a highly specialized and trained group of individuals working for a top secret government department who got missions which were otherwise; well, impossible. They would accomplish this through a meticulous and clever plan, which in most instances involved conning the enemy involved. There were few car chases or gun battles in these episodes (unless the MI force planned them in advance), yet each installment was captivating as we would watch the plot unwind and the bad guy get his just dues.Yes, we know that by the end of the hour the IM force is going to be successful in its mission each time - but what is so fascinating is how they do it (we are privy to only part of the plan each time at the beginning of the show). The plots often have more twists than a pretzel and are believable (with a couple of exceptions).Very few of the installments were ""losers"", which made the TV series well above average overall. The program lasted for seven seasons and outlasted all of the other ""spy programs"" (such as `The Man from U.N.C.L.E', `I Spy', `Get Smart', etc) during the 1960's spy program craze.If you haven't yet seen the original television program, do yourself a great favor and try one of the two sets soon available (Season One is available right now). Sit back in your favorite chair with your friends or family and prepare to be delighted. I'll bet you'll find the episodes are like Lays Potato Chips - can't watch just one.Highly Recommended~P~Episodes from Season Two include:Season 2, Episode 1: The WidowOriginal Air Date: 10 September

If this is the first time that you are watching these episodes, maybe you may become a little bored because you can't quite follow what they are doing to achieve their goal.  Don't let this discourage you.  What made ""Mission Impossible"" such a great show is when you watch that particular episode again.  When ""Mission Impossible"" started to be shown in syndication later in the seventies, it was great to see an episode that you already saw and know of it's successful conclusion.  These are the kinds of shows that you will enjoy watching over and over.  If you've already watched all of Season One of ""Mission Impossible"", wait a few months and start watching them again.  Start of with the episode that you enjoyed the most.  You'll see what I mean about watching it with a new perspective.  Watching it and knowing how it will end.  This show was just one of the best shows on television.Anyway....about the quality of this DVD release.  The picture quality is excellent for it's time and it's even mastered in 5.1 audio.  The opening theme never sounded so good.Has anyone noticed that Mission Impossible, and various other TV shows from the 1960's look and sound better than the TV shows put on DVD from the late seventies and the eighties?I have a theory.  I think sometime during the seventies, someone created a low cost film that Hollywood decided to use to save money.  The quality of the picture may have looked about the same, but perhaps that particular film quality has a much shorter shelf life and the quality of the finished film starts to deteriorate within just a few years.  Check it out for yourself.  If you collect television series DVD's, compare the picture qualities of your favorite sixties shows with your favorite shows of the eighties.  For instance, ""Mission Impossible"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", and ""Star Trek"" all look a lot better of DVD than ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", and even ""Married with Children"".  Even some of the later seasons of M*A*S*H got a little fuzzier then the first few seasons.You know, I could be wrong.  It's just a theory.  But check it out for yourself. I see a pattern of diminishing video quality as shows drift from the sixties up to and through the eighties.  Does anyone else see this?  Can anyone out there say that I'm right?",4,"Great high tech gadgetry, without all the embellishment of special effects.

But I had so much fun with the set that I immediately grabbed the second season when it came out.Season 2 introduces Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, and with his arrival we have what is arguably the show's best-known roster. Objectively I'm torn between Graves and Steven Hill, the first season leader; Graves has a warmer appeal, and he stayed with the show longer, but Hill had more of a special-ops toughness to him. Also debuting as a full cast member is Martin Landau, after spending season 1 under guest billing. Landau always steals the show, and his extensive prosthetics are the coolest element of any episode as well as what takes the most suspension of disbelief.Speaking of which, there's a tad more of that going on this season. Maybe it's a side-effect of watching so many episodes back-to-back, but you start to question how far ahead the IMF plan to manipulate the bad guy into a certain room, or have them pull a gun at that right moment. Some traps seem overly elaborate for a relatively mild objective, but that's half the fun. The budget this season also seems a little higher; there's less obvious set-redressing like that large room from season 1 that doubled as a lobby/casino/police station/prison/etc.So 7-discs in nice slim cases covering 25 remastered episodes, which look and sound great. The glaring lack of subtitles from the season 1 set has been fixed. A great value for any spy genre fan, and a great series for those who like classic television.",5,Expect the impossible yet again,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,1632,"['When', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'more', 'blind', 'buy', 'anything', 'based', 'fuzzy', 'childhood', 'memories', 'well-known', 'theme', 'song', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'set', 'immediately', 'grabbed', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'came', 'out.Season', '2', 'introduces', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'arrival', 'have', 'what', 'arguably', 'show', 'best-known', 'roster', 'Objectively', ""'m"", 'torn', 'Graves', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'first', 'season', 'leader', 'Graves', 'warmer', 'appeal', 'stayed', 'show', 'longer', 'Hill', 'had', 'more', 'special-ops', 'toughness', 'Also', 'debuting', 'full', 'cast', 'member', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'spending', 'season', '1', 'guest', 'billing', 'Landau', 'always', 'show', 'extensive', 'prosthetics', 'are', 'coolest', 'element', 'episode', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'most', 'suspension', 'disbelief.Speaking', 'tad', 'more', 'going', 'season', 'side-effect', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'back-to-back', 'start', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'ahead', 'IMF', 'plan', 'manipulate', 'bad', 'guy', 'certain', 'room', 'have', 'pull', 'gun', 'right', 'moment', 'traps', 'seem', 'overly', 'elaborate', 'relatively', 'mild', 'objective', 'fun', 'budget', 'season', 'also', 'little', 'higher', 'less', 'obvious', 'set-redressing', 'large', 'room', 'season', '1', 'doubled', 'lobby/casino/police', 'station/prison/etc.So', '7-discs', 'nice', 'slim', 'cases', 'covering', '25', 'remastered', 'episodes', 'look', 'sound', 'great', 'glaring', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'season', '1', 'set', 'been', 'fixed', 'great', 'value', 'spy', 'genre', 'fan', 'great', 'series', 'who', 'like', 'classic', 'television']",Mission: Impossible - The Second TV Season

1058710,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000NOIX66,trebe,"[2, 2]","Riding the popularity of the ""spy craze"" Mission Impossible had a successful debut on CBS in 1966.  Receiving their assignments via recorded messages, the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) executed devious and elaborately planned schemes, completing clandestine operations too difficult or sensitive for the US government to undertake.While Mission Impossible was a success, there were issues with actor Steven Hill who played IMF leader Dan Briggs, which led his being replaced.  In season two (1967-68) Peter Graves as Jim Phelps, assumed leadership of the IMF, without any explanation, or mention of Briggs.  Fortunately, Graves had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, and helped to stabilize a difficult situation.The IMF's core group remained the same, with master of disguise Rollin Hand (Martin Landau), cover girl Cinnamon Carter (Barbara Bain), electronics expert Barney Collier (Greg Morris), and strong man Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus).  Additional agents were brought in as was necessary.  With Jim Phelps, an active, attractive, charismatic, and totally committed leader, the IMF was at full strength, and prepared to take on the toughest assignments.Mission Impossible featured intriguing situations, complicated plots, exotic locations, ingenious inventions and devices, and bold impersonations, and disguises.  There were also many stereotypical characters, and occasional instances of overacting, and some terrible accents.  If anything, some of the stories in the first season were a little too outlandish, to the point of being almost absurd.  While still quite edgy and loaded with clich&eacute;s, the writing in the second season seems to be a reigned back a bit, and slightly more in touch with reality.  The impersonations and use of rubber masks, which was kind of overdone in the first season, is reduced, and there seem to be fewer abrupt cheesy endings.  No matter how outrageous the scheme may be, the IMF team always displays a serious attitude, working together like true professionals.  Since the viewer isn't clued in as to exactly what the plan is, there is usually a decent level of suspense.The series provided interesting roles, mostly for male guest stars, and season two features many familiar faces from the era, including Albert Paulsen, Joseph Ruskin, Eric Braden, Sid Haig, Brock Peters, Anthony Zerbe, William Windom, James Daly, Darrin McGavin, Paul Winfield, Joseph Campenella, Bradford Dillman, Fritz Weaver, Will Geer, Vincent Gardenia, Gerald S. O'Loughlin, Paul Stevens, and Pernell Roberts.  Women unfortunately were not so well represented, although Antoinette Bower, Hazel Court, Joan Staley, Marianna Hill, and Kate Woodville, are among those who appear.The image and sound quality of the episodes is generally very good.  There are some issues with focus in places, but this seems to be a conscious choice by the director.  Often set in fictional locations, the stories, which were always intended as entertainment, may not hold up that well, some forty years later.  Produced during the Cold War, and only very loosely based on reality, the program is generally an amusing and fun watch, while still serving as a reminder of those turbulent times.With a solid cast and generally improved stories, Mission Impossible built up momentum in season two, and would peak in popularity during its third season, the last with the husband and wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain.  Peter Graves, along with Greg Morris, and Peter Lupus, would become the heart of the show, remaining together until the series was cancelled in 1973.",4,Jim Phelps assumes leadership of the IMF...,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,3588,"['Riding', 'popularity', 'spy', 'craze', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'had', 'successful', 'debut', 'CBS', '1966', 'Receiving', 'assignments', 'recorded', 'messages', 'IMF', 'Impossible', 'Missions', 'Force', 'executed', 'devious', 'elaborately', 'planned', 'schemes', 'completing', 'clandestine', 'operations', 'too', 'difficult', 'sensitive', 'US', 'government', 'undertake.While', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'was', 'success', 'were', 'issues', 'actor', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'who', 'played', 'IMF', 'leader', 'Dan', 'Briggs', 'led', 'being', 'replaced', 'season', 'two', '1967-68', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'assumed', 'leadership', 'IMF', 'explanation', 'mention', 'Briggs', 'Fortunately', 'Graves', 'had', 'great', 'chemistry', 'rest', 'cast', 'helped', 'stabilize', 'difficult', 'situation.The', 'IMF', 'core', 'group', 'remained', 'same', 'master', 'disguise', 'Rollin', 'Hand', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'cover', 'girl', 'Cinnamon', 'Carter', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'electronics', 'expert', 'Barney', 'Collier', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'strong', 'man', 'Willy', 'Armitage', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'Additional', 'agents', 'were', 'brought', 'as', 'was', 'necessary', 'Jim', 'Phelps', 'active', 'attractive', 'charismatic', 'totally', 'committed', 'leader', 'IMF', 'was', 'full', 'strength', 'prepared', 'take', 'toughest', 'assignments.Mission', 'Impossible', 'featured', 'intriguing', 'situations', 'complicated', 'plots', 'exotic', 'locations', 'ingenious', 'inventions', 'devices', 'bold', 'impersonations', 'disguises', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'occasional', 'instances', 'overacting', 'terrible', 'accents', 'anything', 'stories', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'little', 'too', 'outlandish', 'point', 'being', 'almost', 'absurd', 'still', 'quite', 'edgy', 'loaded', 'clich', 'eacute', 'writing', 'second', 'season', 'be', 'reigned', 'back', 'bit', 'slightly', 'more', 'touch', 'reality', 'impersonations', 'use', 'rubber', 'masks', 'was', 'kind', 'overdone', 'first', 'season', 'reduced', 'there', 'seem', 'be', 'fewer', 'abrupt', 'cheesy', 'endings', 'matter', 'how', 'outrageous', 'scheme', 'may', 'be', 'IMF', 'team', 'always', 'serious', 'attitude', 'working', 'together', 'true', 'professionals', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'clued', 'exactly', 'what', 'plan', 'usually', 'decent', 'level', 'suspense.The', 'series', 'provided', 'interesting', 'roles', 'mostly', 'male', 'guest', 'stars', 'season', 'two', 'features', 'many', 'familiar', 'era', 'including', 'Albert', 'Paulsen', 'Joseph', 'Ruskin', 'Eric', 'Braden', 'Sid', 'Haig', 'Brock', 'Peters', 'Anthony', 'Zerbe', 'William', 'Windom', 'James', 'Daly', 'Darrin', 'McGavin', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'Joseph', 'Campenella', 'Bradford', 'Dillman', 'Fritz', 'Weaver', 'Will', 'Geer', 'Vincent', 'Gardenia', 'Gerald', 'S.', ""O'Loughlin"", 'Paul', 'Stevens', 'Pernell', 'Roberts', 'Women', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'represented', 'Antoinette', 'Bower', 'Hazel', 'Court', 'Joan', 'Staley', 'Marianna', 'Hill', 'Kate', 'Woodville', 'are', 'who', 'appear.The', 'image', 'sound', 'quality', 'episodes', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'issues', 'focus', 'places', 'be', 'conscious', 'choice', 'director', 'Often', 'set', 'fictional', 'locations', 'stories', 'were', 'always', 'intended', 'entertainment', 'may', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'Produced', 'Cold', 'War', 'only', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'reality', 'program', 'generally', 'amusing', 'fun', 'watch', 'still', 'serving', 'reminder', 'turbulent', 'times.With', 'solid', 'cast', 'generally', 'improved', 'stories', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'built', 'up', 'momentum', 'season', 'two', 'would', 'peak', 'popularity', 'third', 'season', 'last', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Barbara', 'Bain', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'Greg', 'Morris', 'Peter', 'Lupus', 'would', 'become', 'heart', 'show', 'remaining', 'together', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', '1973']",Mission: Impossible - The Second TV Season
1058711,A35JCTYQGSO6CT,B000NOIX66,"W. McRae ""woohooboy""","[11, 11]","In the fall of 1967, CBS television made the decision to renew ""Mission: Impossible"". From a ratings perspective, the series hadn't exactly broken records. What the show did have in it's favour was positive reviews from critics, not to mention acclaim - the series walked away with the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Series in it's first season. There were however changes.Steven Hill (who played Dan Briggs - head of the IMF team) during the first year was let go. According to backstage reports, Hill's behaviour and requests (which included leaving the set early on Friday nights to attend mass - Hill being an Orthodox Jew) were becoming increasingly difficult for the show's producers to accommodate. Moreover, there was pressure coming from the network for a more ""visible"" (ie: traditional) leading man who could anchor the series.Enter Peter Graves as the new leader of the IMF team, Jim Phelps. Graves was an ideal choice and remains to this day the most identifiable person connected with the series. Tall and commanding, Phelps was smart and heroic. He led the team with purpose and confidence as opposed to the ""blend-in-with-the-background"" persona favoured by his predecessor. Graves also proved to be a hit with viewers as well.Also returning were Martin Landau (having being bumped up to series regular) as Rollin Hand - man of a thousand faces. Barbara Bain as the sultry Cinnamon Carter. Greg Morris as gadget's wizard Barney Collier and Peter Lupus as the team's muscle Willy Armitage.This season would see the show's writers begin to bring the series into sharper focus. The stories themselves would contain the same level of tension and suspense whilst at the same time, increasing the stakes. From outwitting enemy agents (""The Survivors"", ""The Photographer"" & ""The Spy"") to bringing ruthless people to justice (""Sweet Charity"", ""The Counterfeiter"" & ""The Killing"") to helping resistance movements (""The Astrologer"" & ""Trial By Fury"") the IM team were indeed a force to be reckoned with. The series would even delve into personal territory when Jim stumbles onto an assassination plot by accident and the team are called in to save both him and foil the scheme in the episode ""The Town"".There is a sense of confidence at play here when watching the season season of ""Mission: Impossible"". The episodes are still smartly written, well acted and expertly produced. This measure of success also translates effectively for viewers to as the series began to outperform it's competition - ratings wise. Not surprisingly, by the end of the second season, the buzz factor had well and truly kicked in and the show established itself as tv's hottest spy series.For retro kicks, season two of ""Mission: Impossible"" is well worth checking out..
