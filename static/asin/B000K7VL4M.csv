There is a lot of airtime in these collections.  BUt, through it all, there are few laughs.  It was never that funny, but her star power kept the show on the air.  She was so much a part of Americana that hairdressers had a hairdo, including blond highlights, ready and waiting.  A lot of women signed up, including my mother.  Unfortunately, that contributed -0- to the show which ostensibly was a comedy.  The only thing on the show that was even microscopically interesting were the fashion shows she did once per year.  That was hardly enough to buy a full series, a full season, or even a small collection of shows on one disk.",2,What was I thinking?,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,754,"['Doris', 'Day', 'was', 'icon', 'Hollywood', 'screen', 'So', 'when', 'CBS', 'think', 'was', 'pitched', 'series', 'snapped', 'up', 'lot', 'airtime', 'collections', 'BUt', 'are', 'few', 'laughs', 'was', 'never', 'funny', 'star', 'power', 'kept', 'show', 'air', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Americana', 'hairdressers', 'had', 'hairdo', 'including', 'blond', 'highlights', 'ready', 'waiting', 'lot', 'women', 'signed', 'up', 'including', 'mother', 'Unfortunately', 'contributed', '-0-', 'show', 'ostensibly', 'was', 'comedy', 'only', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'even', 'microscopically', 'interesting', 'were', 'fashion', 'did', 'once', 'year', 'was', 'hardly', 'enough', 'buy', 'full', 'series', 'full', 'season', 'even', 'small', 'collection', 'shows', 'one', 'disk']",The Doris Day Show - Season 4

Faulkner,"[5, 5]","I love Doris Day - an inspiration to us all, and love her work with the Doris Day Animal League and Doris Day Animal Foundation - however, to me the first seasons of the series are the best.  I loved the farm, and the way the series started - hated it as cast members changed, and as Doris moved to the city.  In season 4, when the childen suddenly disappear without any excuse, the show floundered. This also disturbs me as I think many in the tv gig forget that to child actors, the series is like a real family to them - and very upsetting to suddenly be ""dumped"" - particulary when the series went on without them.  To me, the series is at its best for the first couple of years, making your heart yearn for a life like that - a simpler farm life, with a distinct sense of purpose and values as to what is really important.",4,Doris Day is always worth watching!,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,827,"['love', 'Doris', 'Day', 'inspiration', 'love', 'work', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Animal', 'League', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Animal', 'Foundation', 'however', 'first', 'seasons', 'series', 'are', 'best', 'loved', 'farm', 'way', 'series', 'started', 'hated', 'cast', 'members', 'changed', 'Doris', 'moved', 'city', 'season', '4', 'when', 'childen', 'suddenly', 'disappear', 'excuse', 'show', 'floundered', 'also', 'think', 'many', 'tv', 'gig', 'forget', 'child', 'actors', 'series', 'real', 'family', 'very', 'upsetting', 'suddenly', 'be', 'dumped', 'particulary', 'when', 'series', 'went', 'series', 'best', 'first', 'couple', 'years', 'making', 'heart', 'yearn', 'life', 'simpler', 'farm', 'life', 'distinct', 'sense', 'purpose', 'values', 'what', 'really', 'important']",The Doris Day Show - Season 4

Was it some terrible automobile accident or an earthquake? So, if you lose your father and children, you comfort yourself by having fashion shows. Doris Day herself said this series was ill conceived, and that she isn't proud of it. I agree, Doris. I give it 1 star, Doris Day wishes to forget she ever did it. One thing I will say, even at her age, she looked great in the expensive clothes. Although some looked like they should be on younger women, she still had a great figure.Let's face it, Doris Day is wonderful, but she was never able to adapt to television. She still thought she was doing a Hollywood premier, not a TV series.

1032766,A3BZSYJKZCRY03,B000K7VL4M,Retro Pixie,"[3, 4]","Season four of ""The Doris Day Show"" makes me feel like I'm watching science fiction, where characters get sucked into a black hole never to be seen again.I love Doris; I'm a big fan of her movies and I like the previous seasons of this show, but this one was weird for me.  Suddenly, her boys, Billy and Toby, are not there and there's no mention of them.  Maybe they're hidden away with Tiger from ""The Brady Bunch"" and Chuck, the oldest son from ""Happy Days.""  There's never a mention of what became of these beloved pets and, more shockingly, beloved family members.  Where DID they go??  Add to that, the magazine where she works has apparently cleaned house...Myrna, Mr. Harvey and Mr. Nicholson are gone.  I can only hope they're taking care of Billy and Toby in... THE TWILIGHT ZONE.The season starts with Doris Martin going about her life and work without any explanation whatsoever to the viewing audience as to why she's no longer a mother, or why Rose Marie as Myrna is no longer there as her best friend, or why she has no connection to her father or the farm or, well...the list goes on and on.  O.K., I know this show was never high art; it was always fluff, but it was fun & enjoyable fluff; better still, plausible fluff.  This season, the genius that is T.V. executives asked us to suspend all rational belief.  Doris Day deserved better and so did we.They did keep Billy DeWolfe as next-door neighbor Mr. Jarvis and Kaye Ballard as friend and restaurant owner, Angie Pallucci.  But Katie bar the door at Today's World Magazine...that place was like a sieve with employees being sifted out left and right.  Gone was the lovable McLean Stevenson as her boss and in was John Dehner as boss Cy Bennett.  Nothing at all against Dehner; I like him, but it's hard to like anyone in this situation.  He and Doris have an almost psychotically hostile relationship.  Jackie Joseph was brought in as his secretary, but given very little to do.  A very thin and shaggy-haired Peter Lawford was added as Doris' love interest.There are some preposterous plots; she travels to France and becomes part of a diamond heist, but wait...there's more:  Most unintentionally funny plot?  She is taken hostage by Middle Eastern rebels (stop laughing; it's true).  I don't know what was more unbelievable, the hostage situation or the acting by said rebels.  Most annoying plot?  The supposed Christmas episode.  Seasons two and three Christmas shows are charming.  But this debacle has Doris investigating someone dressed as Santa who committed a murder.  Most entertaining?  The ever-popular fashion show.  And most ridiculous?  Doris is required to be her doctor boyfriend's surgical nurse for an emergency operation at sea.There are 24 episodes.  Extras include:  interviews with Jackie Joseph and Kaye Ballard, an episode of ""Pet Set,"" hosted by Betty White with guests Doris Day and Billy DeWolfe and more.Some, like me, may want to get this season to complete their collection and enjoy the effervescence that is Doris, regardless of the material; others may want it for the weirdness that T.V. often brings...but remember - ""You are traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination.
