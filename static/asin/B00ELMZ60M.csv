The quality of my set is very good almost perfect so Iassume the quality sold here is from the same source. The showis Classic Garner with all his tough guy and comedy acting he usedin Support your local Sheriff/Gunfighter movies and Rockford files.It is a oddball quirky western and very well written and directed.This is one of those rare shows that should've been a big hit!It's ashame but finally the complete series is here! I was only10 when this was broadcast and I been waiting to see it again!I've watched 2 episodes so far and it's as good as I remember.I didn't pay the expensive price on these but I would haveif I had look on here first and it was worth every penny.This is for Garner fans or any Classic TV Collector like me!,5,Classic James Garner!,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,878,"['Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'quality', 'got', 'copy', 'anothersource', 'when', 'came', 'professional', 'artwork', 'checked', 'onamazon', 'quality', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'almost', 'perfect', 'so', 'Iassume', 'quality', 'sold', 'here', 'same', 'source', 'showis', 'Classic', 'Garner', 'tough', 'guy', 'comedy', 'acting', 'usedin', 'Support', 'local', 'Sheriff/Gunfighter', 'movies', 'Rockford', 'files.It', 'oddball', 'quirky', 'western', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed.This', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'hit', 'ashame', 'finally', 'complete', 'series', 'here', 'was', 'only10', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'again', ""'ve"", 'watched', '2', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'as', 'good', 'remember.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'expensive', 'price', 'would', 'haveif', 'had', 'look', 'here', 'first', 'was', 'worth', 'penny.This', 'Garner', 'fans', 'Classic', 'TV', 'Collector']",Nichols: The Complete Series
1667744,A1AJKRJT8VY208,B00ELMZ60M,DigitalMan,"[2, 2]","Excellent set -- James Garner has always claimed that this was his favorite series. I don't know if I would go that far (I'm very partial to ""The Rockford Files"") but this is still a great show.However, be warned of one minor error: Disc 1, Episode 4 is NOT ""Paper Badge"" as it is labled. Instead, it is ""Ketchum Power."" And Disc 3, Episode 1 which is labled as ""Ketchum Power"" is in fact, ""Paper Badge"" -- not a huge mistake, but as Warner Brothers owns the show, you would think that they would get it right. So if you do want to watch the series in its proper order, you're going to be making a few extra disc changes.That said, mine is one of the DVD-R sets. Maybe other sets have ""Paper Badge"" and ""Ketchum Power"" correctly labled? Just so you can make sure, the real ""Paper Badge"" episode features Joyce Van Patten as a guest star.",5,"Excellent series, great DVD set... but two of the episodes are mislabled.",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,837,"['Excellent', 'set', 'James', 'Garner', 'always', 'claimed', 'was', 'favorite', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'go', 'far', ""'m"", 'very', 'partial', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'still', 'great', 'show.However', 'be', 'warned', 'one', 'minor', 'error', 'Disc', '1', 'Episode', '4', 'NOT', 'Paper', 'Badge', 'labled', 'Instead', 'Ketchum', 'Power', 'Disc', '3', 'Episode', '1', 'labled', 'Ketchum', 'Power', 'fact', 'Paper', 'Badge', 'not', 'huge', 'mistake', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'show', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'get', 'right', 'So', 'do', 'want', 'watch', 'series', 'proper', 'order', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'making', 'few', 'extra', 'disc', 'changes.That', 'said', 'mine', 'one', 'DVD-R', 'sets', 'Maybe', 'other', 'sets', 'have', 'Paper', 'Badge', 'Ketchum', 'Power', 'correctly', 'labled', 'Just', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'real', 'Paper', 'Badge', 'episode', 'features', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'guest', 'star']",Nichols: The Complete Series

1667746,A366S12KCZ280V,B00ELMZ60M,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[11, 13]","When people think of the actor James Garner most likely they will think of ""The Rockford Files"" or possibly ""Maverick"". But in between those two TV series there was another show that starred Garner. It lasted only one season back in 1971-72. It was called ""Nichols"" and of all the TV series James Garner starred in that was my favorite show of his. The series was a western but not like any western you had ever seen. There were no weekly shoot outs or bar room brawls as would be expected in your normal western. As Nichols Garner did not carry a gun. Instead of the brawls and gun play there was dialog and character development with humor thrown in here and there. The story lines were easy to follow yet riveting to watch. It is one of the few shows I can remember watching where you cared about the characters the actors were playing on the show. And maybe that is why the show was canceled after only one season. Too unconventional for a western plus too much talk and not enough action to hold many of the viewers attention. It is just sad that the network didn't give the show enough of a chance to find an audience because I think it was out there. It is hard to build up an audience for a TV series when all you give it is one season to try. In an attempt to draw interest in the series and hopefully stop the cancelation notice the producers of the show ended the first season on a very unusual note that as far as I know had never happened on a TV series up to that point. I will not say what happened. If you remember and are a fan of the show you know what happened. If you hadn't seen the show before then I don't want to create any spoiler alerts and will say no more. All I will say is that it didn't work and ""Nichols"" was removed from the air.What I will say about ""Nichols"" is how disappointed in the show I am. This is a great show that deserves every one of the five stars I gave it so that is not the problem. I am disappointed and upset that this series is only available in DVD-R format. What! Really? For a long time I have been waiting and hoping that one day ""Nichols"" might be released on disc. And now it has but I will not buy this from Amazon or anywhere else apparently. Why? Because it can only be found on DVD-R. Yes when it first came out it was on DVD but they only printed so many copied in that format. But now with all the DVDs sold out you can only find ""Nichols"" on DVD-R. There is no way I am going to pay almost $50 for something, whether ""Nichols"" or any other show, that is recorded on DVD-R. For that kind of money I want the real deal not some copy.My reason then for writing this review is twofold. First I wanted to state my position what a great show ""Nichols"" was and how much I think the viewer will enjoy this series if they take the time to watch it. At the same time this review is a warning however that you are taking chances in ordering ""Nichols"" since most likely you will not be getting the show in DVD but rather as a burned copy on DVD-R.  If you are like me you want to get the best value for your dollar when you purchase something. Paying almost $50 for what is essentially a bootleg copy is to me no value at all.",5,This Should Be On DVD Not DVD-R,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,3180,"['When', 'people', 'think', 'actor', 'James', 'Garner', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'think', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'possibly', 'Maverick', 'two', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'show', 'starred', 'Garner', 'lasted', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'back', '1971-72', 'was', 'called', 'Nichols', 'TV', 'series', 'James', 'Garner', 'starred', 'was', 'favorite', 'show', 'series', 'was', 'western', 'not', 'western', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'were', 'weekly', 'shoot', 'outs', 'bar', 'room', 'brawls', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'normal', 'western', 'Nichols', 'Garner', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'gun', 'Instead', 'brawls', 'gun', 'play', 'there', 'was', 'dialog', 'character', 'development', 'humor', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'easy', 'follow', 'yet', 'riveting', 'watch', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'can', 'remember', 'watching', 'where', 'cared', 'characters', 'actors', 'were', 'playing', 'show', 'maybe', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'Too', 'unconventional', 'western', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'hold', 'many', 'viewers', 'attention', 'just', 'sad', 'network', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'show', 'enough', 'chance', 'find', 'audience', 'think', 'was', 'there', 'hard', 'build', 'up', 'audience', 'TV', 'series', 'when', 'give', 'one', 'season', 'try', 'attempt', 'draw', 'interest', 'series', 'hopefully', 'stop', 'cancelation', 'producers', 'show', 'ended', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'unusual', 'note', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'had', 'never', 'happened', 'TV', 'series', 'point', 'will', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'happened', 'remember', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'create', 'spoiler', 'alerts', 'will', 'say', 'more', 'will', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Nichols', 'was', 'removed', 'air.What', 'will', 'say', 'Nichols', 'how', 'disappointed', 'show', 'am', 'great', 'show', 'one', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'not', 'problem', 'am', 'disappointed', 'upset', 'series', 'only', 'available', 'DVD-R', 'format', 'What', 'Really', 'long', 'time', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'Nichols', 'might', 'be', 'released', 'disc', 'now', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'anywhere', 'else', 'apparently', 'Why', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'found', 'DVD-R', 'Yes', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'was', 'DVD', 'only', 'printed', 'so', 'many', 'copied', 'format', 'now', 'DVDs', 'sold', 'out', 'can', 'only', 'find', 'Nichols', 'DVD-R', 'way', 'am', 'going', 'pay', 'almost', '50', 'something', 'Nichols', 'other', 'show', 'recorded', 'DVD-R.', 'kind', 'money', 'want', 'real', 'deal', 'not', 'copy.My', 'reason', 'then', 'writing', 'review', 'twofold', 'First', 'wanted', 'state', 'position', 'what', 'great', 'show', 'Nichols', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'think', 'viewer', 'will', 'enjoy', 'series', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'review', 'warning', 'however', 'are', 'taking', 'chances', 'ordering', 'Nichols', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'getting', 'show', 'DVD', 'rather', 'burned', 'copy', 'DVD-R', 'are', 'want', 'get', 'best', 'value', 'dollar', 'when', 'purchase', 'something', 'Paying', 'almost', '50', 'what', 'essentially', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'value']",Nichols: The Complete Series

1667751,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00ELMZ60M,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[66, 70]","Cancelled after one season the humorous James Garner turn-of-the-century western focuses on the title character played by Garner who reluctantly agrees to become sheriff of the town named after his family. Nichols is an unconventional sheriff in a transitional titme; he refuses to carry a gun, rides a motorcycle and has something going on with Ruth (Margot Kidder)who owns the local saloon.The series had a unique final episode with the writers/producers and star deciding to retool the show because they believed ""Nichols"" might get a shot at a second season. It didn't happen but that won't stop fans who enjoy Garner's wry sense of humor and quirky TV shows from enjoying this forgotten series.Edit: I've confirmed that apparently the edition being sold by Amazon is DVD-R only while Warner Archive is (at the moment at least) selling pressed DVDs.There are no subtitles (an idiotic move given that the audience for a classic show like this would benefit from having them).The menu is static with no description of the various episodes or their original air dates.The show looks pretty good although there are some issues with color timing in the pilot (meaning it wasn't adjusted during the transfer when they noticed a shift) and the image quality goes from exceptionally good, to decent all within the same episode. During the pilot for example when Nichols first arrives in town the image quality degrades clearly pulled from an inferior dupe (probably due to damage to the film). Contrast varies within the same scenes from one shot to the next going from lighter to darker within the span of a few shots.Some episodes are better looking than others but Warner does a good job of not overcompressing the image quality limiting 4 episodes per dual layered disc.It looks to me that there was little restoration done here which isn't a surprise given that Warner Archive releases tend to look relatively clean (except for occasional speckles which are taken out during the restoration process)and uses the best source prints available.This just indicates that little was done to adjust the show during the transfer for DVD. Colors shift a bit as well due, again, to the age of the film and passage of time. This series is exceptional and most of the episodes look from decent to exceptional.I didn't note any glitches or issues with playing the show on my Blu-ray player or on my computer.Unfortunately we don't get any special features for this set (not a surprise) although an interview with Garner, Kidder (in one of her first major roles), John Beck or Stuart Margolin to discuss the production and how the producers tried to reboot it in an unusual (and daring) method at the time.An unconventional turn-of-the-century western, fans of ""Nichols"" will be happy that this is finally released. The series varies a bit in terms of image quality but, on the whole, the show looks pretty good. Unfortunately a cult classic like ""Nichols"" (not very well known unless you're a fan of Garner)isn't going to get the extensive restoration that I would have liked but the fact that we get it on DVD is a big plus.",5,Classic but forgotten turn of the century western-Editions ordered from Warner Archive (at least early ones) are DVD-Amazon DVDR,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,3113,"['Cancelled', 'one', 'season', 'humorous', 'James', 'Garner', 'turn-of-the-century', 'western', 'focuses', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Garner', 'who', 'reluctantly', 'become', 'sheriff', 'town', 'named', 'family', 'Nichols', 'unconventional', 'sheriff', 'transitional', 'titme', 'carry', 'gun', 'motorcycle', 'something', 'going', 'Ruth', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'who', 'local', 'saloon.The', 'series', 'had', 'unique', 'final', 'episode', 'writers/producers', 'star', 'deciding', 'retool', 'show', 'believed', 'Nichols', 'might', 'get', 'shot', 'second', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Garner', 'wry', 'sense', 'humor', 'quirky', 'TV', 'shows', 'enjoying', 'forgotten', 'series.Edit', ""'ve"", 'confirmed', 'apparently', 'edition', 'being', 'sold', 'Amazon', 'DVD-R', 'only', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'moment', 'least', 'selling', 'pressed', 'DVDs.There', 'are', 'subtitles', 'idiotic', 'move', 'given', 'audience', 'classic', 'show', 'would', 'benefit', 'having', '.The', 'menu', 'static', 'description', 'various', 'episodes', 'original', 'air', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'issues', 'color', 'timing', 'pilot', 'meaning', 'was', ""n't"", 'adjusted', 'transfer', 'when', 'noticed', 'shift', 'image', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'decent', 'same', 'episode', 'pilot', 'example', 'when', 'Nichols', 'first', 'town', 'image', 'quality', 'clearly', 'pulled', 'inferior', 'dupe', 'probably', 'due', 'damage', 'film', 'Contrast', 'varies', 'same', 'scenes', 'one', 'shot', 'next', 'going', 'lighter', 'darker', 'span', 'few', 'shots.Some', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'looking', 'others', 'Warner', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'overcompressing', 'image', 'quality', 'limiting', '4', 'episodes', 'dual', 'layered', 'disc.It', 'looks', 'was', 'little', 'restoration', 'done', 'here', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'given', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'releases', 'tend', 'look', 'relatively', 'clean', 'occasional', 'speckles', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'restoration', 'process', 'best', 'source', 'prints', 'available.This', 'just', 'little', 'was', 'done', 'adjust', 'show', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'Colors', 'shift', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'due', 'again', 'age', 'film', 'passage', 'time', 'series', 'exceptional', 'most', 'episodes', 'look', 'decent', 'exceptional.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'note', 'glitches', 'issues', 'playing', 'show', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'computer.Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'special', 'features', 'set', 'not', 'surprise', 'interview', 'Garner', 'Kidder', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'roles', 'John', 'Beck', 'Stuart', 'Margolin', 'discuss', 'production', 'how', 'producers', 'tried', 'reboot', 'unusual', 'daring', 'method', 'time.An', 'unconventional', 'turn-of-the-century', 'western', 'fans', 'Nichols', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'finally', 'released', 'series', 'bit', 'terms', 'image', 'quality', 'whole', 'show', 'pretty', 'good', 'Unfortunately', 'cult', 'classic', 'Nichols', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'known', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Garner', ""n't"", 'going', 'get', 'extensive', 'restoration', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'fact', 'get', 'DVD', 'big', 'plus']",Nichols: The Complete Series
