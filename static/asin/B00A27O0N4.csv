Doc Martin has aired between 2004 and 2011 and there have been a total of 37 episodes broadcast plus the Christmas Special in 2006 and the two movie length episodes which preceded the first series.Doctor Martin Ellingham or Doc Martin was formerly a highly successful surgeon in a London hospital, who was forced to leave this job due to a fear of blood. He takes the job of GP in the sleepy Cornish village of Portwenn and is soon finding it difficult to relate to the locals due to what he considers his businesslike approach, but which is interpreted by those on the receiving end as standoffishness and a total lack of empathy and bedside manner. This extends to his personal life and his difficult relationship with the long suffering Louisa since he has very little in the way of people skills and a total inability to express emotion.Portwenn is one of those places where nothing very significant seems to happen for a lot of the time, but which is inhabited by a gentle range of eccentric locals whom the stories are built around and the whole mix makes for very good and often quite amusing entertainment. Martin Clunes excels as Doc Martin and plays the part with a largely expressionless face except for the odd twinge of exasperation or irritation which occasionally crosses his brow. He has made this part his own and you really cannot imagine anyone else as Doc Martin. There is a very able supporting cast, but the principal characters have varied from series to series.Although this contains the 5 series of Doc Martin to date and the two prequels, purchasers should be aware that a sixth series is now confirmed for 2013. However, this will very likely be the final series. I would have thought that Doc Martin was one of those scenarios where it was possible to keep producing fresh scripts so personally I am certainly hoping for more!",5,Definitive Doc Martin Box Set.........So Far!,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,1976,"['definitive', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'collection', 'comprising', 'five', 'series', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'date', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'aired', '2004', '2011', 'have', 'been', 'total', '37', 'episodes', 'broadcast', 'Christmas', 'Special', '2006', 'two', 'movie', 'length', 'episodes', 'preceded', 'first', 'series.Doctor', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'was', 'formerly', 'highly', 'successful', 'surgeon', 'London', 'hospital', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'job', 'due', 'fear', 'blood', 'job', 'GP', 'sleepy', 'Cornish', 'village', 'Portwenn', 'soon', 'finding', 'difficult', 'relate', 'locals', 'due', 'what', 'businesslike', 'approach', 'interpreted', 'receiving', 'end', 'standoffishness', 'total', 'lack', 'empathy', 'bedside', 'manner', 'personal', 'life', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'long', 'suffering', 'Louisa', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'people', 'skills', 'total', 'inability', 'express', 'emotion.Portwenn', 'one', 'places', 'where', 'nothing', 'very', 'significant', 'happen', 'lot', 'time', 'inhabited', 'gentle', 'range', 'eccentric', 'locals', 'whom', 'stories', 'are', 'built', 'whole', 'mix', 'very', 'good', 'often', 'quite', 'amusing', 'entertainment', 'Martin', 'Clunes', 'excels', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'part', 'largely', 'expressionless', 'face', 'odd', 'twinge', 'exasperation', 'irritation', 'occasionally', 'brow', 'made', 'part', 'own', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'very', 'able', 'supporting', 'cast', 'principal', 'characters', 'have', 'varied', 'series', 'series.Although', '5', 'series', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'date', 'two', 'prequels', 'purchasers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'sixth', 'series', 'now', 'confirmed', '2013', 'However', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'be', 'final', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'was', 'one', 'scenarios', 'where', 'was', 'possible', 'keep', 'producing', 'fresh', 'scripts', 'personally', 'am', 'certainly', 'hoping', 'more']",N/A

In many ways this is an English Ballykissangel. The characters and stories are very different but they've created another quirky village as a pretext for a comedy of culture clash.  While BallyK was more of a comedic soap with the ensemble playing their expected roles, Doc Martin is a personality driven comedy about an uncompromising high achiever completely out of his element.  So far they've avoided the downward spiral Ballykissangel took after season 3, though a cast change in Series 5 has had a few detractors and I thought it the weakest of the 5 sets.Martin Clunes is in rare form as the cantankerous Dr. Martin Ellingham who is seemingly tormented on a daily basis by the odd assortment of village patients inhabiting picturesque Portwenn. Forced to give up his practice as a London surgeon due to a comedically ironic bout of haemophobia he's selected to replace the former GP in this Cornish fishing village.  A less suitable candidate could hardly be imagined. Martin's brusque manner and insulting intolerance to his patients' country ways set the stage as the episodes follow one hilarious plot after another.  Along the way he enters into an improbable romance  with the local school teacher (surely the most forgiving woman in all of Cornwall) and becomes an object of the local chemist's sexual obsession.  It's hard to explain just why this is so terribly funny when the core joke is that Martin is such a disagreeable person, but it is. As the series plays out you start to empathize with him as he slowly becomes an essential part of the community even while planning a return to his former life.The origin of the Doc Martin character dates back to the 2000 theatrical release ""Saving Grace"", but evolved significantly prior to this iteration.  In the film and TV movies, Clunes plays Dr. Martin Bamford whose demeanor is significantly different, as is his medical specialty, his personal life, and the circumstances that brought him to Port Isaac (renamed Portwenn in the series).  Apparently this singular role struck such a chord with Clunes that he hung on to it and has brought it to near perfection in this hilarious and oddly touching series.I rated this with 4 stars rather than 5  for a couple of reasons.  First, the package includes the two UK TV movies that are mildly entertaining but nowhere near the level of the series.  Secondly, I was a bit disappointed with Series 5.  I'm glad they made it, but I didn't feel it rose to the same level as the previous four.  So 5 stars for Series 1 thru 4 and a star off for a the more mundane movies and Series 5.  Included with the 38 episodes and two feature length TV movies is more than an hour of behind the scenes background video, so the current street price works out to a little more than $1 per hour of entertainment, a bargain by just about any standard.UPDATE;  GOOD NEWS FOR DOC MARTIN FANS:  THE FIRST EPISODE  OF SERIES 6 AIRED SEP 1 ON ITV.
