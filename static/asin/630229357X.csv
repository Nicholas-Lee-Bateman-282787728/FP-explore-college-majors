306197,A2WCY11WAGBXBX,630229357X,Aileen,"[62, 63]","I have seen all the Peanuts movies, and this is the Peanuts movie that really makes me cry no matter how many years I have been watching it for (since around 1979 or so, when I was 5 or 6).  It deals with the fact that Snoopy has gotten a letter from his former owner, a little girl named Lila.  She is sick in the hospital and asks him to come see her (how did she get Charlie's addresss?  Maybe the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm kept the Brown's address, and she asked them for it).  He goes to see her, and then comes back.  He then tells the rest of the gang (by typing out that he is leaving some of his worldly possessions to them, since he can't speak) that he must return to her.  Here's where the sad part comes in--the going away party, and one of the saddest songs you'll ever hear in your whole life.  It really hit me hard because my best friend at the time had moved away, and it always makes me think of that.  This movie to me deals with losing a best friend, and then them coming back to you, which is what happened with me in real life.  Also, you get to learn the story of how Charlie Brown got Snoopy in the first place (an incident on a playground resulted in Charlie's parents going to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm and picking out Snoopy a their dog).  But, as with all the Peanuts movies, there is a happy ending...I think that you could figure out what it is, because even I'm happy in the end after crying my eyes out :)!",5,The Saddest Peanuts Movie Ever!,1040860800,"12 26, 2002",2002,1435,"['have', 'seen', 'Peanuts', 'movies', 'Peanuts', 'movie', 'really', 'cry', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'watching', '1979', 'so', 'when', 'was', '5', '6', 'fact', 'Snoopy', 'gotten', 'letter', 'former', 'owner', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Lila', 'sick', 'hospital', 'come', 'see', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'Charlie', 'addresss', 'Maybe', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm', 'kept', 'Brown', 'address', 'asked', 'see', 'then', 'back', 'then', 'rest', 'gang', 'typing', 'out', 'leaving', 'worldly', 'possessions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'must', 'return', 'Here', 'where', 'sad', 'part', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'one', 'saddest', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'hear', 'whole', 'life', 'really', 'hit', 'hard', 'best', 'friend', 'time', 'had', 'moved', 'away', 'always', 'think', 'movie', 'deals', 'losing', 'best', 'friend', 'then', 'coming', 'back', 'what', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'Also', 'get', 'learn', 'story', 'how', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'got', 'Snoopy', 'first', 'place', 'incident', 'playground', 'resulted', 'Charlie', 'parents', 'going', 'Daisy', 'Hill', 'Puppy', 'Farm', 'picking', 'out', 'Snoopy', 'dog', 'Peanuts', 'movies', 'happy', 'ending', 'think', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'even', ""'m"", 'happy', 'end', 'crying', 'eyes']",Snoopy Come Home VHS

It's essentially the tale of Snoopy going buckwild until he learns that his original owner wants him back.

Let 'em watch New Zoo Revue). But my only complaint with this film is that the music is a bit on the sappy side, compared to Vince Guiraldi's usual peppy standard.

Schulz, creator of the Peanuts strip went through a divorce around 1972 when this film was released and I wonder how much it colored Schulz while making this dark little film.  Snoopy searches for greener pastures and leaves poor Charlie Brown and his gang for a former owner, Lila.  I cried buckets when I saw it in theaters in 1972 and it's not much easier to take now.  Few laughs and constructed more like a mystery, it can be hard to take if you are old enough to understand what is going on.  Even the songs have lyrics like, ""Why must we pay for hellos that we say?""

I recently got it on dvd and my youngest daughter was mesmerized (her first intro to Peanuts), my older daughter was thrilled to see it again, and even my husband stopped what he was doing and stood in the doorway for a bit before reluctantly sitting down to watch the rest.It is done so well, and it's such a good movie!It starts off with great scenes of Snoopy playing with the Peanuts gang (and Woodstock-- his first appearance anywhere).  Snoopy surfing, helping Peppermint Patty build a grand sand castle, just enjoying life as only Snoopy does!  But, then he finds himself excluded from the beach the next day as a ""No Dogs Allowed"" sign appears.  And then it seems there are ""No Dogs Allowed"" signs just about everywhere.  Charlie Brown gets angry at Snoopy and Snoopy is a bit unhappy.  Just about this time, we meet Lila-- a sweet lonely little girl in a far away hospital.  Remembering when Snoopy belonged to her, she writes Snoopy a letter.When Snoopy receives the letter, he becomes all teary eyed and, with Woodstock, begins the journey to visit Lila.Though Charlie Brown is sad to see Snoopy go, Snoopy must leave and he and Woodstock find the journey itself to be quite an adventure.  And, once he finds Lila, Snoopy has a difficult decision to make.  This one is a definite tear-jerker!Vince Guaraldi's music is absent here-- all the songs are written by Richard Sherman and Robert Sherman.  As I remember finding fault in this while watching it on videotape years ago, I was completely happy with the music now.

Unlike the first Peanuts movie which had many light moments augmented by the joyous and classic Vince Guaraldi jazz scores usually employed in Peanuts animation, this one is full of conflict and sadness, and uses an incredibly hokey score by the Sherman Brothers (who wrote pop hits back in the day).  My five year-old, who is pretty tough, broke down several times during this movie, worried about Snoopy getting KIDNAPPED at one point, and leaving Charlie Brown at another point (not to mention the brutality of Snoopy's lengthy boxing match with Lucy).  Schulz's Peanuts always had an adult tone to it, but the Peanuts specials managed to reach out to kids with many purely joyous moments.  Not so here.  The plot isn't even that well-executed and the resolution is not emotionally satisfying.  I don't recommend this to anyone.  The first Peanuts movie is great (A Boy Named Charlie Brown) by comparison.  No wonder this particular film was a big flop at the box office at the time.

306222,A2RD3RYAON46C2,630229357X,Nolagal,"[2, 5]","Neither my 11-year old son nor I liked this cartoon very much.  After being really excited about watching a Charlie Brown movie together -- he had even taken the time to search it out and DVR it -- he asked if we could stop watching halfway through. It's a long film...or maybe it just seemed long...a seemingly endless parade of sadness, anger, fighting and mistreatment.  A few chuckles were interspersed here and there, but most of all it seemed really heavy.I found myself wondering about Charles Schultz as I watched.  Could it be that he was really a mean & miserable man?  It sure looked like it.  This truly felt like a passive-aggressive revenge piece to me...revenge at some unknown person or circumstance.  Charlie Brown in this movie is an exaggerated case study of woe, unluckiness and helplesness.  He was not even endearingly unlucky as he is in other films.  Snoopy is mistreated and unappreciated, rather than celebrated.Peppermint Patty is the bossy, self-absorbed, female archetype. Charlie Brown's attempts to get away from her are a bit too obvious.  It was clearly a swipe at women.Snoopy falls in the hands of a temporary owner, again a bossy girl who mistreats him, tries to over-control him, and who Snoopy makes snide faces at and does nothing but run away from.  Some of the dialog sounds more like a marital spat than a doggie tale.Lucy is unusually mean and haggard looking in this film, especially during their boxing scene.Linus and Snoopy have a knock-down, drag-out fight over Linus' blanket.  I found myself thinking that Schultz was portraying himself in the characters of Snoopy and Charlie Brown, who were both antagonized and mistreated by everyone else.  Both of them display an unhealthy resignation and passive anger to the people around them.Charlie Brown's speech to Snoopy that ""everything you are is because of me"" really jumped out like a red hot poker.  I had the same thought as another reviewer; that either Schultz's wife had nagged him with this line, or that he was revealing a core issue of his own marriage.  Sure enough, the other reviewier researched it and discovered that Schultz had divorced the year before this film came out.To me, it was a study in depression, separation, helpessness and meanness -- really nothing redeeming at all.  Even the drawings seemed crude and hard compared to the more soft and pleasing art of later Charlie Brown movies.  Of course, it could be that they just hadn't found their artistic style yet.  But the drawings, music and tone of the movie were much harsher than the more popular Charlie Brown movies.The fighting seemed way too intense and graphic for a children's film, IMO.  I kept wondering what the producers must have thought of it once they saw the finished product.  I guess that once the film was done they had invested so much that they felt there was nothing to do but go ahead and release the film, despite its mean tone and inappropriateness for children.I would recommend that parents pre-view this cartoon to see if they feel it is appropriate and even desirable for their children before watching together.",3,Atypical Peanuts flick...not suitable for children?,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,3118,"['11-year', 'old', 'son', 'liked', 'cartoon', 'very', 'much', 'being', 'really', 'excited', 'watching', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'movie', 'together', 'had', 'even', 'taken', 'time', 'search', 'out', 'DVR', 'asked', 'could', 'stop', 'watching', 'halfway', 'long', 'film', 'maybe', 'just', 'seemed', 'long', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'parade', 'sadness', 'anger', 'fighting', 'mistreatment', 'few', 'chuckles', 'were', 'interspersed', 'here', 'there', 'most', 'seemed', 'really', 'heavy.I', 'found', 'wondering', 'Charles', 'Schultz', 'watched', 'Could', 'be', 'was', 'really', 'mean', 'miserable', 'man', 'sure', 'looked', 'truly', 'passive-aggressive', 'revenge', 'piece', 'revenge', 'unknown', 'person', 'circumstance', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'movie', 'exaggerated', 'case', 'study', 'woe', 'unluckiness', 'helplesness', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'endearingly', 'unlucky', 'other', 'films', 'Snoopy', 'mistreated', 'unappreciated', 'rather', 'celebrated.Peppermint', 'Patty', 'bossy', 'self-absorbed', 'female', 'archetype', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'attempts', 'get', 'away', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'obvious', 'was', 'clearly', 'swipe', 'women.Snoopy', 'falls', 'hands', 'temporary', 'owner', 'again', 'bossy', 'girl', 'who', 'tries', 'over-control', 'who', 'Snoopy', 'snide', 'nothing', 'run', 'away', 'dialog', 'more', 'marital', 'spat', 'doggie', 'tale.Lucy', 'unusually', 'mean', 'haggard', 'looking', 'film', 'especially', 'boxing', 'scene.Linus', 'Snoopy', 'have', 'knock-down', 'drag-out', 'fight', 'Linus', 'blanket', 'found', 'thinking', 'Schultz', 'was', 'portraying', 'characters', 'Snoopy', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'who', 'were', 'antagonized', 'mistreated', 'everyone', 'else', 'display', 'unhealthy', 'resignation', 'passive', 'anger', 'people', 'them.Charlie', 'Brown', 'speech', 'Snoopy', 'everything', 'are', 'really', 'jumped', 'out', 'red', 'hot', 'poker', 'had', 'same', 'thought', 'reviewer', 'Schultz', 'wife', 'had', 'nagged', 'line', 'was', 'revealing', 'core', 'issue', 'own', 'marriage', 'Sure', 'enough', 'other', 'reviewier', 'researched', 'discovered', 'Schultz', 'had', 'divorced', 'year', 'film', 'came', 'was', 'study', 'depression', 'separation', 'helpessness', 'meanness', 'really', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'Even', 'drawings', 'seemed', 'crude', 'hard', 'compared', 'more', 'soft', 'pleasing', 'art', 'later', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'movies', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'had', ""n't"", 'found', 'artistic', 'style', 'yet', 'drawings', 'music', 'tone', 'movie', 'were', 'much', 'harsher', 'more', 'popular', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'movies.The', 'fighting', 'seemed', 'way', 'too', 'intense', 'graphic', 'children', 'film', 'IMO', 'kept', 'wondering', 'what', 'producers', 'must', 'have', 'thought', 'saw', 'finished', 'product', 'guess', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'had', 'invested', 'so', 'much', 'felt', 'was', 'nothing', 'do', 'go', 'ahead', 'release', 'film', 'mean', 'tone', 'inappropriateness', 'children.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'parents', 'pre-view', 'cartoon', 'see', 'feel', 'appropriate', 'even', 'desirable', 'children', 'watching', 'together']",Snoopy Come Home VHS

On the downside, the Vince Guaraldi piano music so associated with the Peanuts specials is missing in action. In its place we get a parade of songs, one after another after another as though this was a really bad musical.Seriously, schlocky songs take over the whole special as though this was a showcase for the songwriters rather than for the Peanuts characters. Songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman are better known for some of their work with Disney but the choruses and arrangements that tend to these pieces are on the level of some of the DePatie-Freleng Dr. Seuss cartoons (e.g. Sneetches) or perhaps some TV commercials. You might recognize singer Shelby Flint, whose solo vocal is a respite from the group vocals that make up most of the soundtrack. She had some popularity in the sixties with ""Angel on My Shoulder"" and in Disney's ""The Rescuers"" with the Academy Award nominated song ""Someone's Waiting For You"".One viewing of this 1972 feature and you get a strong impression that this was written in the aftermath of either a death or divorce in Charles Schulz's family. So I looked it up and sure enough, Schulz's first marriage ended in 1972, which helps one understand the deep undercurrent of sadness throughout ""Snoopy Come Home"". This might be therapeutic for children who are struggling with their parents' divorce, or it may rub salt in their wounds with lines like, ""I wish everybody I love could be in one place at the same time"". Even the humor echoes the sadness of divorce:Lucy (playing Monopoly): BEEP.

But there is a few things that I don't like, one there are all these scenes of Snoopy/with or without Woodstock, getting throssed of of trains, bus, beach, hospital and the library, and then we hear ""no dogs allowed, and the only place that birds aren't allowed is in the hospital, but yet he is getting thrown off the same places that Snoopy goes in or on, expect for the beach and library. And there is another scene where a girl (Linda Ercoli) assumes that Snoopy and Woody are lost animals, and just adopts them, without checking any id, nor does she check on any lost posters, or even checks Snoopy's tag, and names him ""Rex"", and then all we pretty much hear is here Rex, here Rex, here Rex, and in which she goes in a song rotuine, which the only songs, that you see the character singing, and then the others were they are thinking, but you don't see there lips movie, and then tapes of other tunes, including when Snoppy and Woodstock are on the trip searching for the hospital. The movie opens, with some of the peanuts gang on the beach, we see Charlie Brown (Chad Webber), Linus Van Pelt (Stephen Shea), and Peppermint Patty (Chris De Faria), and Snoopy (Bill Melendez who also does the sounds of Woodstock) surfing on the beach, before he digs a tunnel around Patty's sandcastle, and haviong a great time with her, while Charlie Brown is at home, playing monopoly with the gang, along with Lucy Van Pelt (Robin Kohn) and Schroeder (David Carey), and Charlie Brown is wondering where is Snoopy, intil he comes hjome, and when he fixes Snoopy's supper, when he hurts his thumb while openning Snoopy's dog food. And then ww meet Lila, who we later learn that was Snoopy's orginal owner (Johanna Baer) who is sick in the hospital, writes to him, and then when he reads her letter, he packs his bag, and signals to Woodstock, and then they begin the journey, while leaving Charlie Brown confused of what is going on, and then keeps asking who is Lila, I bet he didn't even stop to think that she was Snoopy's orginal owner. There is another scene in which Charlie, Linus, Patty, and Lucy walking around in circles, while Snoopy Come Home plays, and each believes that they were the reason why Snoopy left.

This isn't a lighthearted, fun romp with the gang. I picked this one up recently since I've begun collecting my beloved Peanuts holiday specials on DVD and thought this would be a nice addition. I recalled seeing it as a kid but very little about the actual story. I guess I was too young to really get anything out of it beyond the fun of my favorite cartoon characters come to life on my TV screen. Watching it as an adult, I was shocked at how utterly depressing most of it is. Everyone cries through about half the movie. Snoopy is torn between two people he loves and devastated at having to leave either of them. There's animosity between Snoopy and the kids, and two rather violent fights, between Snoopy and Linus and Snoopy and Lucy. The bit where Snoopy and Woodstock are trapped by that creepy little girl who wants them as pets is disturbing - I cringed watching Snoopy choke and gag as the kid tied a rope around his neck and dragged him along behind her. Hardly entertaining! Of course, it ends on an upbeat note with Snoopy coming home to Charlie Brown where he belongs, but by that time I was mostly just glad it was over.

It reminds me of the scene in Stripes when Bill Murray asked his fellow soldiers ""How many of you saw Old Yeller?  How many of you cried when...?""  I almost gave away the ending of Old Yeller.  But seriously, it'll be great when Snoopy, Come Home comes out on DVD.  Many of us have been waiting patiently.  It may not have Vince Guaraldi's jazzy score but the songs by the Shermann Brothers (also known for the musical score for Mary Poppins and Charlotte's Web) are charming (""The Best of Buddies,"" ""Snoopy Come Home""), funny (""No Dogs Allowed"" sung by Thurl Ravenscroft) and even heartbreaking (""It Changes"").  The going away party theme sounds a little like something Guaraldi would have come up with.  Also, Woodstock makes his animation debut.The movie starts out with Peppermint Patty promising a little beach picnic for Snoopy and the only thing standing in the way is a No Dogs Allowed sign which appears the next day (those construction workers worked a lot quicker back then than they do these days!).  Charlie Brown gets mad at his dog when he cuts his finger with the can opener (what a klutz!) and tries demanding a little appreciation (you can imagine how much he gets back from Snoopy, who just hands over the dog collar!).  Snoopy also gets in a boxing match with Lucy and a tug-of-war with Linus over his blanket.  Not long after those incidents, Snoopy gets a letter from a girl named Lila (who probably got his address from the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm) asking him to visit him while she's in the hospital.  He shares the letter with Charlie Brown, who says ""If I don't find out who Lila is, I'll go crazy!""  On the way to the hospital, an overfriendly young girl named Claire decides to adopt Snoopy and Woodstock (she sings ""Fundamental Friend Dependabitlity"" while suffocating the poor beagle and putting Woodstock in a cage.  A ""blanket carrying Sherlock Holmes"" finds out all he can about Lila and finds out she was Snoopy's original owner.  Charlie Brown is surprised and passes out, KLUNK!

Originally released in 1972, ""Snoopy Come Home"" is the second in a series of four full-length Peanuts features and although not the worst, it isn't the best either.  It is certainly an improvement over ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" which I found to be rather disappointing, perhaps this is due to the inclusion of one of the greatest Peanuts characters, Peppermint Patty.The story begins when Snoopy spends a day at the beach with Peppermint Patty and returns home hours later to find Charlie Brown upset over Snoopy's abuse of independence, Charlie tells Snoopy that he feels he deserves a little bit more of respect since it is because of him Snoopy is who he is, but the beagle refuses to listen.  Shortly afterwards, Snoopy receives a mysterious letter from an old friend in the hospital and quickly rushes to go see her taking Woodstock along.  Charlie Brown stays behind, wondering where Snoopy ran off to and feeling both depressed and confused.  Linus does some research and finds out that Charlie Brown is not Snoopy's original owner, that he had previously belonged to a little girl named Lila who is now undergoing special care at the city hospital.  Tough times follow for Snoopy as he must make the hard decission of who to stay with, his friend Charlie Brown or his previous owner, Lila.Although the film features many crazy sequences that take away from flow of the film, I felt the flow of them go more evenly along that in the previous film.  These sequences are quite funny, such as when Snoopy is ""adopted"" by a crazy girl in his way to the hospital.  Songs include ""Snoopy Come Home"", ""No Dogs Allowed"", ""Do You Remember Me?"", ""You and Me"", ""Fundamental Friend Dependability"" and ""It Changes"", all of which are quite nice and memorable.  The biggest problem I had with this feature was that it wasn't as sad or heart-breaking as I remembered it, this time around, I found it a comedy film rather than a drama and I even remember one or two scenes that I didn't see this time around.  Still, like I said, this movie is definitely above ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"", but it isn't as fun or exciting as ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown!"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and don't come back!).""",4,"Good, but not as I remember it...",1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,2368,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'remember', 'watching', 'Peanuts', 'full-length', 'feature', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'nothing', 'remembered', 'Originally', 'released', '1972', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'second', 'series', 'four', 'full-length', 'Peanuts', 'features', 'not', 'worst', ""n't"", 'best', 'either', 'certainly', 'improvement', 'A', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'perhaps', 'due', 'inclusion', 'one', 'greatest', 'Peanuts', 'characters', 'Peppermint', 'Patty.The', 'story', 'when', 'Snoopy', 'day', 'beach', 'Peppermint', 'Patty', 'home', 'hours', 'later', 'find', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'upset', 'Snoopy', 'abuse', 'independence', 'Charlie', 'Snoopy', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'respect', 'Snoopy', 'who', 'beagle', 'listen', 'Shortly', 'afterwards', 'Snoopy', 'mysterious', 'letter', 'old', 'friend', 'hospital', 'quickly', 'rushes', 'go', 'see', 'taking', 'Woodstock', 'along', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'wondering', 'where', 'Snoopy', 'ran', 'off', 'feeling', 'depressed', 'confused', 'Linus', 'research', 'out', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'not', 'Snoopy', 'original', 'owner', 'had', 'previously', 'belonged', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Lila', 'who', 'now', 'undergoing', 'special', 'care', 'city', 'hospital', 'Tough', 'times', 'follow', 'Snoopy', 'must', 'make', 'hard', 'decission', 'who', 'stay', 'friend', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'previous', 'owner', 'Lila.Although', 'film', 'many', 'crazy', 'sequences', 'take', 'away', 'flow', 'film', 'felt', 'flow', 'go', 'more', 'evenly', 'previous', 'film', 'sequences', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'such', 'when', 'Snoopy', 'adopted', 'crazy', 'girl', 'way', 'hospital', 'Songs', 'include', 'Snoopy', 'Come', 'Home', 'No', 'Dogs', 'Allowed', 'Do', 'Remember', 'Me', 'Me', 'Fundamental', 'Friend', 'Dependability', 'Changes', 'are', 'quite', 'nice', 'memorable', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'feature', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'sad', 'heart-breaking', 'remembered', 'time', 'found', 'comedy', 'film', 'rather', 'drama', 'even', 'remember', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'time', 'around', 'Still', 'said', 'movie', 'definitely', 'A', 'Boy', 'Named', 'Charlie', 'Brown', ""n't"", 'fun', 'exciting', 'Race', 'Your', 'Life', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Bon', 'Voyage', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'back']",Snoopy Come Home VHS

My family sat down together today to watch with the anticipation of seeing the normal Peanuts humor and wit.  Their descriptions half-way through the movie were ""wierd"" and ""boring"".  The movie is incredibly long for a Peanuts film at about 90 minutes.  Much of this time is filled with unnecessary songs attempting to make this video some type of '70s musical.Snoopy is rude, mean, and even ungrateful to Charlie Brown in the first part of the movie.  He spends days hanging out at the beach with Peppermint Patty for totally unexplained reasons.  It makes you wonder why everyone is so glad to see him when he comes back in the end (Oops! I gave away the ending!)  The ending is mercifully short, but predictable after being painfully dragged through the first 90% of the video.This should have been a 30 minute video.  It seems that the creators tried to add to much ""filler"" to drag it out to a full-length film but they neglected to add anything meaningful to the story.I gave it one star since 3 of the 4 members of my family fell asleep during the video (the daughter who stayed awake was doing homework instead of paying attention to the story.)

Langan ""take403""","[14, 14]","I don't know what exactly Lucy was trying to say in her going away speech (and I'm sure she didn't either), but let's face it- Snoopy was more than just a dog.  This is the most emotional of all Peanuts efforts (and is  Woodstock's animation debut).  The plot: Snoopy gets a letter from his  original owner, Lila, who misses him and wants him back.  This means he  would leave the security of the Brown residence.  It has his funny parts:  the No Dogs Allowed signs everywhere (one of them is just what he needs in  the end!), Snoopy surfing, fighting Lucy with 1 boxing glove (on his  nose!), fighting Linus for his blanket (Linus retaliates by flinging 1 of  his shoes at Snoopy!), the obnoxiously friendly Clara who kidnaps Snoopy  (probably inspired Elmira on Tiny Toons), and Linus's classic line:  &quot;You got a used dog, Charlie Brown!&quot;.  Then, of course, are the  tear-jerking scenes: poor, sweet Lila begs Snoopy to stay with her,  Snoopy's going-away party in which the entire Peanuts gang is in tears  (even the crabby Lucy), and Snoopy bidding his final farewell to his pal  Woodstock and his long-suffering master, Charlie Brown (who laments &quot;I  need more hellos!&quot;).",5,"&quot;He's Not Much Of a Dog, But, After All, Who Is?&quot;",957484800,"05 5, 2000",2000,1196,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'exactly', 'Lucy', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'going', 'away', 'speech', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'either', 'let', 'face', 'it-', 'Snoopy', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'dog', 'most', 'emotional', 'Peanuts', 'efforts', 'Woodstock', 'animation', 'debut', 'plot', 'Snoopy', 'letter', 'original', 'owner', 'Lila', 'who', 'back', 'would', 'leave', 'security', 'Brown', 'residence', 'funny', 'parts', 'No', 'Dogs', 'Allowed', 'signs', 'everywhere', 'one', 'just', 'what', 'end', 'Snoopy', 'surfing', 'fighting', 'Lucy', '1', 'boxing', 'glove', 'nose', 'fighting', 'Linus', 'blanket', 'Linus', 'flinging', '1', 'shoes', 'Snoopy', 'obnoxiously', 'friendly', 'Clara', 'who', 'kidnaps', 'Snoopy', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Elmira', 'Tiny', 'Toons', 'Linus', 'classic', 'line', 'quot', 'got', 'used', 'dog', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'quot', 'Then', 'course', 'are', 'tear-jerking', 'scenes', 'poor', 'sweet', 'Lila', 'begs', 'Snoopy', 'stay', 'Snoopy', 'going-away', 'party', 'entire', 'Peanuts', 'gang', 'tears', 'even', 'crabby', 'Lucy', 'Snoopy', 'bidding', 'final', 'farewell', 'pal', 'Woodstock', 'long-suffering', 'master', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'who', 'quot', 'need', 'more', 'hellos', 'quot']",Snoopy Come Home VHS
