My only regret is that it is not available on Blu-ray yet which I will buy as soon as it is.Michael Crighton is a genius filmmaker and writer, and if you love Crighton's techno thriller novels like Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, Timeline, Airframe, Congo and all the rest Looker is the book he made into a film instead!Looker stands up against all of Crighton's books and is actually better than any of the films based on his books. I think the Jurassic Park films are terrible and are among Spielberg's worst... but Crighton was a masterful filmmaker as well as writer and even though not all of his films were good the best that stand out are: The Great Train Robbery, Coma and Looker.I truly love Looker and not just because of nostalgia for the 80's, Looker was like TRON very much ahead of it's time and still is predicting computers and computer graphic role in entertainment and industry.How essential computer graphics and programs have become to marketing and design, we aren't quite yet to the level of reproducing an actor with a programmed personality the way that Looker represents but I would not put it past a corporation to bump off supermodels and actors in the same way they do in this film to retain the rights of the model after death and continue to use their likeness, personality and voice for marketing.The plot is original and diabolical, Albert Finney is an unlikely hero here and therefore an original one; a plastic surgeon?But yet it works and he is likeable, same with Susan Dey as the idealistic model in a corrupt industry.&#34;They are killing off all the perfect girls&#34;Looker is astounding, perfectly directed, edited, acted and along with both the original TRON and War Games with Mathrew Broderick ingeniously predicts the world we live in today!Looker is fun, stylish, dramatic, thriller and high tech - please check out LOOKER now and also check out Coma and The Great Train Robbery. I am just sad to report that only Coma is available on Blu-ray because for me, in this order are Crighton's films best. Looker, The Great Train Robbery and then Coma... Westworld and Runaway I'm only mildly interested in.Funny enough though for me his best two novels were Airframe and Pirate Latitudes both of which actually steer away from being super tech thrillers to more humanistic fun adventures. As far as the tech thrillers go there is Timeline, Jurassic Park, Prey, The Lost World, Next, A Case Of Need and a whole slew of them but for just plain great reads and adventure/thrillers Airframe and Pirate Latitudes are in my opinion the best. Funny though how those are the only two Crighton stories that don't have films to them but for me are the best reads. I hope a great director does them justice one day and I hope that Michael Crighton will someday be remembered as a great director/writer for his original thriller LOOKER as well.",5,"Superb film, highly underrated.

Despite the overlapping premises, Crichton has a compellingly interesting way of portraying developing technologies as a weapon best left out of the hands of Corporate America, and Criminal America too, for that matter.The developing technology in ""Looker"" might have seemed a bit absurdly fantastical in the film's day, but it sure looks reasonable now given the nature of the corporate segment the ill-used technology appeals to.

Like me, their psyches were indelibly impressed by Susan Dey's collarbone after repeated viewings on HBO as 13-year olds. This was one of my absolute all-time favorite early-80's cable movies. It's about a hot-shot L.A. plastic surgeon (Albert Finney!?) who finds himself beset with models carrying lists of millimeter-precise changes they want in their faces/bodies so they can be Perfect.  After two of these models are murdered post-op, he becomes a suspect, and starts to investigate the origin of the computer-mandated quest for Perfection  -- a corporation with the rather sinister-sounding name of DIGITAL MATRIX. This movie is VERY 80's in music (great shimmery horror-synth combined with femmy power-pop) and art direction (lots of pastels) so it's fine to go a little MST-3K with it.  At the same time, there are some really great scenes (Susan Dey re-shooting the suntan lotion commercial over and over to please The Computer is one that haunts me) and the general concept is not absurd AT ALL... ""Hi! I'm Cindy! I'm the Perfect Female Type, 18 to 25. I'M HERE TO SELL FOR YOU!"" I'll admit, things do get a little silly in the end, but it's still fun.

But if you like intelligent sci-fi themes with sexy women and moderate violence, and if you can smirk your way through the dialogue, you may appreciate the subtler points of ""Looker.""",4,Surprising if misogynistic vision of modern TV ads,1005350400,"11 10, 2001",2001,2096,"['Looker', 'attempts', 'analyze', 'crass', 'corporate', 'marketing', 'objectification', 'women', 'advertisers', 'potential', 'misuse', 'digital', 'animation', 'will', 'interest', 'viewers', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'technologies', 'envisioned', 'back', 'dawn', 'IBM', 'PC', 'have', 'become', 'near-reality.The', 'smart', 'story', 'line', 'talented', 'cast', 'help', 'compensate', 'often', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'superficially', 'defined', 'characters.James', 'Coburn', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'make', 'most', 'own', 'stock', 'characters', 'evil', 'CEO', 'old-fashioned', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'However', 'Looker', 'most', 'female', 'characters', 'disposable', 'bimbos', 'scantily', 'clad', 'one', 'scene', 'then', 'stalked', 'high', 'technology', 'then', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'Susan', 'Dey', 'Leigh', 'Taylor-Young', 'are', 'exceptions', 'treatment', 'women', 'role', 'TV', 'ad', 'model', 'chased', 'murderous', 'conglomerate', 'Dey', 'projects', 'quiet', 'emotional', 'depth', 'won', 'fans', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'Taylor-Young', 'cool', 'commanding', 'intelligent', 'presence', 'role', 'co-conspirator', 'Coburn.Director', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'sarcastic', 'vision', 'TV', 'advertising', 'side', 'effects', 'movie', 'namesake', 'Looker', 'device', 'give', 'fresh', 'edgy', 'sometimes', 'humorous', 'spin', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'predictable', 'low-budget', 'cliches', 'auto', 'chases', 'burglaries', 'fight', 'scenes.Make', 'mistake', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'bit', 'schmaltzy', 'TV', 'ads', 'are', 'laughably', 'bad', 'key', 'question', 'unresolved', 'clear', 'sexy', 'models', 'are', 'being', 'digitized', 'animated', 'achieve', 'perfect', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'typically', 'expensive', 'TV', 'commercials', 'never', 'learn', 'why', 'Coburn', 'Taylor-Young', 'are', 'murdering', 'models.Nevertheless', 'movie', 'smartly', 'values', 'underlying', 'television', 'ad', 'production', 'potential', 'forgery', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'TV', 'shows', 'kind', 'Looker', 'star', 'power', 'cutting-edge', 'topic', 'other', 'Crichton', 'movies', 'like', 'intelligent', 'sci-fi', 'themes', 'sexy', 'women', 'moderate', 'violence', 'can', 'smirk', 'way', 'dialogue', 'may', 'appreciate', 'subtler', 'points', 'Looker']",N/A

Homicide Detective (Dorian Harewood-a familiar face in cop dramas) has already questioned Dr. Larry as one of his monogramed fountain pens was left at the girl's apartment.

Years later, I bought it on VHS and then on DVD. I just rewatched for the first time in a long time and was as enthralled as I was the first time (I've seen it so many times I've lost track).Warning: There may be spoilers.What got me interested in pulling it out and watching it now was an article I read about Google creating an eye tracker for Google glass. This idea was actually in the movie and was used by an advertising agency to see what the viewer was watching and how to create a better ad to put their product front and center. Reality catching up with fiction.What was creepy, however, was this same agency was putting light pulses in the commercials that would be hypnotic and cause the viewer to go into a trance and then become easily susceptible to suggestions. It could be used to make a person want to buy a product or vote for a certain politician.It's a sci-fi psychological thriller but it was the possibility of what can be done through the medium of TV that made this more compelling. The following quote by John Reston (played by the enormously talented James Coburn) occasionally plays in my mind and then I usually turn the TV off:""Television can control public opinion more effectively than armies of secret police, because television is entirely voluntary. The American government forces our children to attend school, but nobody forces them to watch T.V. Americans of all ages *submit* to television. Television is the American ideal. Persuasion without coercion. Nobody makes us watch. Who could have predicted that a *free* people would voluntarily spend one fifth of their lives sitting in front of a *box* with pictures? Fifteen years sitting in prison is punishment. But 15 years sitting in front of a television set is entertainment. And the average American now spends more than one and a half years of his life just watching television commercials. Fifty minutes, every day of his life, watching commercials. Now, that's power.""It is a powerful statement to the slave-mentality that has overridden our society. As stated, it is more powerful than slavery by oppression since people gladly hand their minds over to an unknown entity. When you view this movie with that kind of thinking it makes the psychology of the movie all the more disturbing.

The plot is ludicrous in a way that did not bother me then (models are being violently killed because... a secret model-simulating computer means they aren't needed any more?  what?) and a plastic surgeon is trying to save one of them.  It's weird, and there are actually signs that it thinks it is a real social satire or paranoia-fest about technology infiltrating our lives.  ""It makes you think,"" we are probably supposed to think.  But if the computer can create a 100 percent credible animation of a woman, why does it need an actual set for her to walk around on?

It was one of those that could be seen on HBO frequently, so it was hard to avoid.  I even had it taped on Beta(yes, BETA!!).  As a child I never completely understood the plot details as they were a bit over my head at that age.  I did know a plastic surgeon was investigating deaths of women and it somehow lead to a sinister looking guy with a mustache and some goofy fake tv commercials with no actors in them.  Two things really attracted me to this movie as a kid.  First, there was a brief naked shot of an attractive woman early in the film(since R rated films were shown after my bed time, I didn't see this often), and for reasons unknown to me at the time, I found this brief sequence terribly exciting.  Secondly, the Looker Gun.  In this film, the killer uses a gun that shoots a beam of light and freezes people in a hypnotic state for varying periods of time.  I thought this was fascinating.Until recently I hadn't seen this movie since probably 1988.  Now I understand it, and it remains quite interesting.  In the film, Albert Finney is a plastic surgeon who realizes that the television commercial actresses he has operated on are ending up dead.  He plays detective and finds that the deaths are linked to a shady corporation headed by James Coburn, and that this company is dabbling in a new technology.  The technology involves making tv commercials with computer generated actors that put the viewer in a hypnotic state and become engrossed with the product.  You will WANT that perfume!!  You will WANT that kitchen cleaner!!  Damn it, you WILL WANT that box of Oaties cereal!!  Along with the commercials, the corporation also designs the aforementioned freeze gun.  So, it's up to Finney to stop the killing and bring the corporation down before we start seeing these commercials in our homes.It's a really cool movie!  As a kid, the name Michael Crichton meant nothing to me, but now it all makes sense.  In 1981 this was science fiction.  Computer generated actors selling a product on a tv commercial??  How absurd!!!  A lot of the things in this film have become science fact.  Not all of them, but the scary thing about it is just how damn close we are to seeing some of these things in the near future(if not already and we don't know it)Looker's not a very poular film, more of a cult deal, but a lot of folks do seem to remember that freeze gun.

There's also a crazy ""light gun"" that causes victims to black out, a device that leads to some very strange shoot-outs. All of this might have been fun if the movie had any kind of suspense or distinctive characters.

There's no shortage of problems, though. The plotting is both lazy and often predictable, relying on a similar structure to writer-director Michael Crichton's previous film, Coma (yet another research institute, yet another conspiracy), and to say there are plotholes is putting it mildly - exactly why are James Coburn and Leigh Taylor Young's evil corporate villains murdering the models in the first place? Crichton certainly never feels the need to come up with a reason in the theatrical version (though the US TV version did include additional footage that at least speculated on a motive, though it didn't make it to the DVD). At times the film feels as if the Looker device - a disorienting light gun that makes you lose track of time - has been used on you, particularly when we jump from the police investigating the aftermath of a shootout to a car chase we never even saw begin (although not filming sequences or losing them in the cutting room may be a more likely explanation). Even star Albert Finney admitted he couldn't understand the film ""and I was in it!"" The finale falls prey to both clever-cleverness, riffing on Sherlock Jr as Finney and the villains find themselves in a shootout played through various computer-generated commercials in a move that dilutes any tension in favor of comedy, and a gaping lack of logic (why do they need to use remote control live sets instead of just showing tapes of the commercials?).This is really one of those films you just have to check your desire for logic at the door and go with the flow. But for some reason in spite of all that I've always had an indulgent spot for this Michael Crichton bomb because at least it has a few good ideas going for it even if it doesn't know what to do with them, and for the few scenes that do work (such as Finney losing an afternoon in what feels like seconds as his house is searched while he's in it). Others may not be so forgiving.Warners' DVD finally offers the film in its original 2.35:1 widescreen ratio and comes with a commentary and intro by Crichton, who seems in denial about the film's critical and commercial reception, and a trailer, but doesn't have the deleted footage that was in the US TV version and which apparently explained why the murders that drive the plot are taking place - something you never find out in the theatrical cut here!",3,Worth a look - but only if you can forgive the many problems,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,2675,"['Looker', 'was', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'disappointment', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'quarter', 'century', 'surprise', 'see', 'aged', 'better', 'many', 'contemporaries', 'largely', 'low-tech', 'predictions', 'are', ""n't"", 'wide', 'mark', 'key', 'plot', 'point', 'CGI', 'duplication', 'performers', 'commercials', 'shortage', 'problems', 'though', 'plotting', 'lazy', 'often', 'predictable', 'relying', 'similar', 'structure', 'writer-director', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'previous', 'film', 'Coma', 'yet', 'research', 'institute', 'yet', 'conspiracy', 'say', 'are', 'plotholes', 'putting', 'mildly', 'exactly', 'why', 'are', 'James', 'Coburn', 'Leigh', 'Taylor', 'Young', 'evil', 'corporate', 'villains', 'murdering', 'models', 'first', 'place', 'Crichton', 'certainly', 'never', 'need', 'come', 'up', 'reason', 'theatrical', 'version', 'US', 'TV', 'version', 'did', 'include', 'additional', 'footage', 'least', 'speculated', 'motive', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'DVD', 'times', 'film', 'feels', 'Looker', 'device', 'disorienting', 'light', 'gun', 'lose', 'track', 'time', 'been', 'used', 'particularly', 'when', 'jump', 'police', 'investigating', 'aftermath', 'shootout', 'car', 'chase', 'never', 'even', 'saw', 'begin', 'not', 'filming', 'sequences', 'losing', 'cutting', 'room', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'likely', 'explanation', 'Even', 'star', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'admitted', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'film', 'was', 'finale', 'prey', 'clever-cleverness', 'riffing', 'Sherlock', 'Jr', 'Finney', 'villains', 'find', 'shootout', 'played', 'various', 'computer-generated', 'commercials', 'move', 'tension', 'favor', 'comedy', 'gaping', 'lack', 'logic', 'why', 'do', 'need', 'use', 'remote', 'control', 'live', 'sets', 'instead', 'just', 'showing', 'tapes', 'commercials', '.This', 'really', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'have', 'check', 'desire', 'logic', 'door', 'go', 'flow', 'reason', 'spite', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'indulgent', 'spot', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'bomb', 'least', 'few', 'good', 'ideas', 'going', 'even', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'few', 'scenes', 'do', 'work', 'such', 'Finney', 'losing', 'afternoon', 'what', 'feels', 'like', 'seconds', 'house', 'searched', 'Others', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'forgiving.Warners', 'DVD', 'finally', 'film', 'original', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'ratio', 'commentary', 'intro', 'Crichton', 'who', 'denial', 'film', 'critical', 'commercial', 'reception', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'have', 'deleted', 'footage', 'was', 'US', 'TV', 'version', 'apparently', 'explained', 'why', 'murders', 'drive', 'plot', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'something', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'here']",N/A

Roberts becomes curious and unravels a conspirarcy that will guarantee perfect models forever that never have tandrums, never have to be paid and never grow old. Unfortunately Cindy (Susan Dey) a model that Larry has become involved with seems to be next on the hit list. Featuring a strong supporting cast including James Coburn, ""Looker"" retains its sleek model curves and nearly flawless surface 20+ years on. The story does have some holes in it but if you're willing to over look some of the flaws of the film you'll enjoy it.A flawed suspense thriller ""Looker"" was clearly ahead of the curve when it came to the use of digital images to replicate human beings. This was one of Finney's first role after being away from films for four years (the other two were equally odd choices--""Wolfen"" and ""Loophole""). Crichton does a good job with his own material here even setting up the sequences with the ""black out"" gun so that it's clear to viewers something weird is going on. ""Looker"" succeeds as long as you are willing to suspend your disbelief and although it's not his best film (""Westworld"", ""Coma"" and ""The Great Train Robbery"" would be his best), the strong performances and fascinating ideas for the film (which was, like a lot of Crichton's work way ahead of its time)will make this an enjoyable and entertaining flick.""END OF SPOILERS:Warner has created quite a ""Looker"". The film receives a very nice, clean transfer to DVD. Crichton provides an interesting introduction to the film and a feature length commentary where he focuses on changes, issues and solutions that occurred during the shooting of the film. His commentary primarily focuses on the technical challenges of shooting the film including how he had to re-think the section related to the ""black out"" gun.Evidently there was footage shown when the film premiered on television that doesn't appear on the DVD. Warner wasn't aware of the footage and as a result didn't include it as part of this package.Fans of ""Looker"" will enjoy this special edition. Although it doesn't have all the bells and whistles fans of the film might hope for, Warner has done a nice job of making sure the film looks and sounds good. We also get a great commentary from director/writer Crichton that provides a lot of background information on the production of the film. Highly recommended for fans of the film.
