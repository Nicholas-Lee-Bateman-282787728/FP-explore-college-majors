The acting was generally terrible and the movie was often amateurish - the opening titles looked cribbed from a kid's video project, for instance. Sometimes it was difficult to tell if the jokes were really that bad, or if the cast's utter lack of timing ruined them. The plot is charming but instantly predictable.Then at other times, the movie's great - I liked the idea of people viewing themselves in terms of movies. And, combining a Hollywood movie and a Bollywood movie to poke fun and enjoy the cliches of each is such a great idea that I fully expect to see more movies doing that. Lisa Ray is attractive (and supposedly making the transition to Bollywood). Akshaye Khanna is really cool in a dance sequence. It's paced smoothly and has the bright colors and fun songs that help define Bollywood. So despite its large faults, it's still a fun movie worth watching.",4,Excellent/Amateur,1054080000,"05 28, 2003",2003,999,"['really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'not', 'anything', 'movies', 'Pardes', 'are', 'pure', 'Bollywood', 'aimed', 'native', 'audience', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'terrible', 'movie', 'was', 'often', 'amateurish', 'opening', 'titles', 'looked', 'cribbed', 'kid', 'video', 'project', 'instance', 'was', 'difficult', 'tell', 'jokes', 'were', 'really', 'bad', 'cast', 'utter', 'lack', 'timing', 'ruined', 'plot', 'charming', 'instantly', 'predictable.Then', 'other', 'times', 'movie', 'great', 'liked', 'idea', 'people', 'viewing', 'terms', 'movies', 'combining', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'poke', 'fun', 'enjoy', 'cliches', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'fully', 'expect', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'doing', 'Lisa', 'Ray', 'attractive', 'supposedly', 'making', 'transition', 'Bollywood', 'Akshaye', 'Khanna', 'really', 'cool', 'dance', 'sequence', 'paced', 'smoothly', 'bright', 'colors', 'fun', 'songs', 'help', 'define', 'Bollywood', 'So', 'large', 'faults', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'watching']",N/A

As a result, we get the following nice group of small, low-budget, enjoyable films:- Mambo Italiano- Touch of Pink- Friends and Family (my personal favorite)- Bollywood/HollywoodYou can't take Bollywood/Hollywood too seriously...it's a cute little parody. The drop-dead beautiful Lisa Ray, a product of your basic Polish/Indian parentage, is just making the transition at this point from modeling to acting. Rahul Khanna is like Tommy Aaron to brother Akshaye's Henry.  But still, this is an enjoyable film.  Some of the reviewers are expecting too much, I think.  Director Mehta isn't looking to top 'Lagaan' here.The movie's standout scene:  real Bollywood royalty Akshaye Khanna paired in a classic song and dance piece with Ms. Ray's character 'Sue,' at that very moment revealed to be quite Indian (and not the Spaniard Rahul had taken her for).  It's a scene that would rank with the best of any movie from Bollywood.

941070,ADS5APY1NKTL4,B000BDGWGM,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[4, 8]","If Bollywood/Hollywood had been my introduction to Bollywood, when I started watching the films about five years ago, I don't think I would have been the fan of the genre that I am today.  Though, I am well aware that director, Deepa Mehta, directed and orchestrated this film in order to presumably poke fun at this popular film industry, based in India, it really didn't work for me.For those of you, unfamiliar with Bollywood, it is the Indian equivelant of the Hollywood industry.  That said, the two genres are quite different from one another, in terms of style, plot development and common themes.  Bollywood is known for (seemingly) spontaneous dance numbers, interspersed with high drama, romance, comedy and adventurous interludes.  In other words, the genre offers something for everyone.Bollywood/Hollywood TRIES to offer something for everyone, but it just doesn't work out.  In fact, I couldn't get past the fact that the actors, writers and director were trying WAY too hard to make this a combination of a film with a message, a romance and a parody, all rolled into one.  Our hero (Rahul Khanna) is a rich, self-described ""cyber geek.""  He has just recently lost his Caucasian girlfriend in a freak accident, and his mother and Shakespeare-quoting grandmother are determined that he settle down with the right INDIAN girl.  As luck would have it, he meets Sue (Lisa Ray), an escort who is willing to take on the persona of anyone for this man, if paid the right price.  Though, Sue claims to be Spanish, her knowledge of, both, Bollywood films and cultural Indian norms speaks otherwise.Not only was this film almost unwatchable, due to the deplorable acting and its weak attempts at Bollywood ""in"" jokes (many films are made reference to here), but its failed attempts in depicting the cultural constraints of Indian culture in comparison to more Western values came off more as badly delivered sketch comedy, than as real, intelligent observations.  (The film is set in Ontario, and the main character must balance the Indian values he was raised with, alongside his wish to rebel and break free from traditional constraints, as a young, bicultural Asian-Canadian man.)I don't reccomend you waste your time on this one.  Instead, I suggest that people look films like the wonderful Lagaan, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, I Have Found It, and Monsoon Wedding.",2,not the greatest introduction to Bollywood...,1138579200,"01 30, 2006",2006,2370,"['Bollywood/Hollywood', 'had', 'been', 'introduction', 'Bollywood', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'films', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'genre', 'am', 'today', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'director', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'directed', 'orchestrated', 'film', 'order', 'presumably', 'poke', 'fun', 'popular', 'film', 'industry', 'based', 'India', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'me.For', 'unfamiliar', 'Bollywood', 'Indian', 'equivelant', 'Hollywood', 'industry', 'said', 'two', 'genres', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'one', 'terms', 'style', 'plot', 'development', 'common', 'themes', 'Bollywood', 'known', 'seemingly', 'spontaneous', 'dance', 'numbers', 'interspersed', 'high', 'drama', 'romance', 'comedy', 'adventurous', 'interludes', 'other', 'words', 'genre', 'something', 'everyone.Bollywood/Hollywood', 'TRIES', 'offer', 'something', 'everyone', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'fact', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'actors', 'writers', 'director', 'were', 'trying', 'WAY', 'too', 'hard', 'make', 'combination', 'film', 'message', 'romance', 'parody', 'rolled', 'one', 'hero', 'Rahul', 'Khanna', 'rich', 'self-described', 'cyber', 'geek', 'just', 'recently', 'lost', 'Caucasian', 'girlfriend', 'freak', 'accident', 'mother', 'Shakespeare-quoting', 'grandmother', 'are', 'determined', 'settle', 'down', 'right', 'INDIAN', 'girl', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'Sue', 'Lisa', 'Ray', 'escort', 'who', 'willing', 'take', 'persona', 'anyone', 'man', 'paid', 'right', 'price', 'Sue', 'be', 'Spanish', 'knowledge', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'cultural', 'Indian', 'norms', 'only', 'was', 'film', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'due', 'deplorable', 'acting', 'weak', 'attempts', 'Bollywood', 'jokes', 'many', 'films', 'are', 'made', 'reference', 'here', 'failed', 'attempts', 'depicting', 'cultural', 'constraints', 'Indian', 'culture', 'comparison', 'more', 'Western', 'values', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'badly', 'delivered', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'real', 'intelligent', 'observations', 'film', 'set', 'Ontario', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'balance', 'Indian', 'values', 'was', 'raised', 'alongside', 'wish', 'rebel', 'break', 'free', 'traditional', 'constraints', 'young', 'bicultural', 'Asian-Canadian', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'waste', 'time', 'one', 'Instead', 'suggest', 'people', 'look', 'films', 'wonderful', 'Lagaan', 'Hum', 'Dil', 'De', 'Chuke', 'Sanam', 'Have', 'Found', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding']",N/A

Bollywood lovers can easily identify the basic elements:  song and dance, necessary love obstacle and a few other nuances.  But the film ruined the parody by explaining them with subtitles like ""DEVDAS: tragic Bollywood Hero"".  Bollywood lovers have seen Devdas and don't need explanations, and it seems to confuse non-Bollywood fans.  It also tried to take a jab at wholesome Bollywood by centering the story around a rich guy who falls in love with a fabulous girl who is really a prosititute.  To an Indian, that's dodgy material.

941072,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B000BDGWGM,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[0, 0]","This is the story of an Indian family in Canada. There is the young man (Rahul Khanna) who promised Dad to look after the family after his death. The family is an odd one with a brother who takes video footage of everything happening in the family, a drama queen mother, a grandmother who sets people up and then throws off lines from Shakespeare, a pregnant sister engaged to be married. The grandmother wants the young man to find a good Indian woman as a bride. He doesn't want to but appears to comply so his sister can marry. He finds a girl who will pose as an Indian bride and then finds out she is Indian. I could go on and on and give the plot away.However this movie is a string of Bollywood stereotypical situations as situations keep arising that typify well-known Indian movies. That was the OK bit for me. But the treatment was offbeat in a way than jarred for me. It has a sort of intellectual smart-aleck feel to it- almost like a group of film students had got together and woven things together. Actors make references to things like 'existential angst', comments are written over various frames with references to titles of Bollywood movies and we have grandma mouthing responses like 'this is the winter of our discontent'. For me it was more an arthouse vanity project than anything I could sit and enjoy.I did think Rahul Khanna (who was playing it straight and drifting through making reference to the madness around him) was very good. Akshaye Khanna appears as himself for a cameo as the young man's friend  saying the young man is like a brother to him (and he is Akshayes' real brother).A salute to, or even a send up of Bollywood would be fine but it felt self-consciously intellectual and I didn't find the heart I like in Bollywoods.Now this one really gets a range of responses. I see it won some awards in Canada. When I checked IMDb, it was rating (with almost 1500 votes at about a 6 out of 10 across age-groups - but with quite a few giving it 1 or 2. On Indian sites, it ranges from 'boring, inept, condescending to both Indians and non-Indians' to 'great spoof'! I didn't have any fun with this one- perhaps you will.
