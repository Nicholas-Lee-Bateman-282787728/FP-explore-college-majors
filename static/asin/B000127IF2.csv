790939,A1AC9S8U66SNMU,B000127IF2,Buenoslibros.es,"[3, 5]","This film by Robert Bresson is beautiful and sad. Made in the same ambience and tone as his 'Au Hazard Bathasar' but not as exciting as it. I don't know where you are coming from, but if you are interested in intimistic and basically plotless cinema, as can be found in foreign (and old) movies, Bresson is a good choice. But if your reason is that of making a spiritual journey, or or widening your faith, then, you must be warned.'Diary...' is pure doubt. The doubt of the main character, the rural priest, and the doubt of the director. The tone and the sadness of the experience of watchibng this film is what mostly impresses me. Other than that, what stays in my mind at the end of the story are the following thoughts:a) The story-teller (Bresson) makes us reflect on the inutily of believing in God, or in acting as if God exists, for if He does exist, life in the present, my circumstance, reality, now, what I feel, the cancer I suffer, the the pain I feel, is so real, so more real than that God of Love I want to believe in but I doubt. This is the impression that this film is communicating me.b) Everybody is cruel. This people don't even deserve my love for them. How can I love them. Why should I be different? It would be crazy. What would my argument be sustained on (the case of the young priest) in order to prove these people wrong in their believes and in their actions? God, his mercy and love? They look at me and they despise me! Or they pity me like a fool!Sad. So this is not really a story, it is just a depiction of a tormented soul, of the realization that we are so imperfect, so weak (would Bresson even say ""sinful""?), a fool-on-the-moon's lament. A cry in the wasteland.What do you do when you are hungry? Do you eat the food, or do you cry at it and blame it for being hungry? Same with God.There is a certain resemblance between this film and the way the great historian Arnold Toynbee depicts disintegrating societies: There is a sense of drift, in which people yield to a meaningless determinism, as if their efforts do not matter, and as if they have no control over their lives. There is a sense of guilt, a self-loathing that comes from their moral abandon.Drift and guilt. These nouns apply as well to the young priest's parishioners.

790943,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B000127IF2,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 6]","Robert Bresson's 1950 breakthrough film, Diary Of A Country Priest (Journal D'Un Cure De Campagne), is one of those films that is absolutely antithetical to everything a Hollywood film stands for. It is obsessive, detailed, slow, and opaque. This, however, does not mean it is a great film, as so many knee-jerk critics claim it is. It is not; but it is a very interesting film. Ostensibly, it may seem to be a film on religion and/or suffering, or, as film critic Fr&eacute;deric Bonnard claims, in The Criterion Collection's DVD essay on the film, a film `about imprisonment,' but it's neither, really. It's more cogently a film about masochism, guilt, and pathological privation, although it does touch upon religion, suffering, and imprisonment. The film was not only directed by Bresson (his fourth of thirteen films), but also adapted by Bresson from the 1936 novel of the same title by Georges Bernanos. Anyone familiar with the works of Carl Theodor Dreyer will be familiar with the techniques used by Bresson- although this film is less stagey and more intimate in tone, but Bresson's cinematographer, L&eacute;once-Henry Burel, is not as slow and deliberate as Dreyer, nor does the film depend so heavily on the juxtaposition between light and dark as Dreyer's works do. There is a `lightness' in Bresson's film that is absent from Dreyer's- both in terms of the gauzey and diffused visuals and intellect. This is not to say that Bresson's film lacks depth, it's merely not as dependent upon a grand philosophical posit as Dreyer's films are.... Yet, the film never reaches the heights that other religiously meditative films, such as Ingmar Bergman's Winter Light, do, mostly because of the very blandness of the narrative. Whereas Bergman's film transcends religion and cores into universal human behavior, Diary Of A Country Priest merely presents its simple narrative, and if one cannot get into it- for its religious-specific ideas, so be it. Also, the film never gets truly inside the young priest. Why, for example, does he even keep a diary? All it seems to be is a book filled with gossip and his petty and self-serving observations. Yet, the film likens the priest to a Christ-like character, rather than a mere outcast. Since outcasts are universal, why does Bresson decide to affiliate the lead character with the remote Christ and not the ubiquitous nebbish? After all, the priest has no name, and this is clearly done to universalize him, even though a priest, by definition, is a non-universal figure. Not that a Christ complex could not be compelling onscreen, just that this particular one is not, for all this character can muster are vapid apothegms such as, `The desire to pray is already prayer,' ""I was a victim of the Holy Agony,' or his dying words, as related by Dufr&eacute;ty: `What does it matter? Everything is grace.'Were only those words true this film would recapitulate their meaning. Failing that, it at least tries, something that, again, Hollywood films do not even dare. Perhaps that young priest was on to something?",3,Good effort,1221004800,"09 10, 2008",2008,3064,"['Robert', 'Bresson', '1950', 'breakthrough', 'film', 'Diary', 'A', 'Country', 'Priest', 'Journal', ""D'Un"", 'Cure', 'De', 'Campagne', 'one', 'films', 'absolutely', 'antithetical', 'everything', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'stands', 'obsessive', 'detailed', 'slow', 'opaque', 'however', 'not', 'mean', 'great', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'knee-jerk', 'critics', 'claim', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'Ostensibly', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'film', 'religion', 'and/or', 'suffering', 'film', 'critic', 'Fr', 'eacute', 'deric', 'Bonnard', 'claims', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'essay', 'film', 'film', 'imprisonment', 'really', 'more', 'cogently', 'film', 'masochism', 'guilt', 'pathological', 'privation', 'touch', 'religion', 'suffering', 'imprisonment', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'directed', 'Bresson', 'fourth', 'thirteen', 'films', 'also', 'adapted', 'Bresson', '1936', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Georges', 'Bernanos', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'works', 'Carl', 'Theodor', 'Dreyer', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'techniques', 'used', 'Bresson-', 'film', 'less', 'stagey', 'more', 'intimate', 'tone', 'Bresson', 'cinematographer', 'L', 'eacute', 'once-Henry', 'Burel', 'not', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'Dreyer', 'film', 'depend', 'so', 'heavily', 'juxtaposition', 'light', 'dark', 'Dreyer', 'works', 'do', 'lightness', 'Bresson', 'film', 'absent', ""Dreyer's-"", 'terms', 'gauzey', 'diffused', 'visuals', 'intellect', 'not', 'say', 'Bresson', 'film', 'depth', 'merely', 'not', 'dependent', 'grand', 'philosophical', 'posit', 'Dreyer', 'films', 'are', 'film', 'never', 'heights', 'other', 'religiously', 'meditative', 'films', 'such', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Winter', 'Light', 'do', 'mostly', 'very', 'blandness', 'narrative', 'Whereas', 'Bergman', 'film', 'religion', 'universal', 'human', 'behavior', 'Diary', 'A', 'Country', 'Priest', 'merely', 'simple', 'narrative', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'it-', 'religious-specific', 'ideas', 'so', 'be', 'Also', 'film', 'never', 'truly', 'young', 'priest', 'Why', 'example', 'even', 'keep', 'diary', 'be', 'book', 'filled', 'gossip', 'petty', 'self-serving', 'observations', 'film', 'priest', 'Christ-like', 'character', 'rather', 'mere', 'outcast', 'outcasts', 'are', 'universal', 'why', 'Bresson', 'decide', 'affiliate', 'lead', 'character', 'remote', 'Christ', 'not', 'ubiquitous', 'nebbish', 'priest', 'name', 'clearly', 'done', 'universalize', 'even', 'priest', 'definition', 'non-universal', 'figure', 'Not', 'Christ', 'complex', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'compelling', 'onscreen', 'just', 'particular', 'one', 'not', 'character', 'can', 'muster', 'are', 'vapid', 'apothegms', 'such', 'desire', 'pray', 'already', 'prayer', 'was', 'victim', 'Holy', 'Agony', 'dying', 'words', 'related', 'Dufr', 'eacute', 'ty', 'What', 'matter', 'Everything', 'grace', 'only', 'words', 'true', 'film', 'would', 'recapitulate', 'meaning', 'Failing', 'least', 'tries', 'something', 'again', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'dare', 'Perhaps', 'young', 'priest', 'was', 'something']",N/A
790944,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B000127IF2,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[6, 8]","Certainly the novel by Georges Bernanos entitled Journal d'un cure de campagne created its alarm in its day as it exposed some of the less spiritual and more secular realities of society, and yet it is a deeply insightful and still troubling examination of a young priest struggling to live with spiritual authenticity his difficult vocation as a diocesan priest in a strange cold town while slowly dying of stomach cancer.Fortunately Bernanos portrays this priest as a gifted and careful writer who maintains an intimate diary. Therefore this novel, in the old style of Liaisons Dangerueses, presents its narrative in the guise of discovered records now published. It is therefore impossible to film.Yet Bresson does so admirably and faithfully and sincerely, and with great talent, technique and wisdom. Thankfully the great Criterion offers us a wonderful reprint restored very recently by which we may view again and again this wonderful, subtle, moving film. My only choking point of course are the subtitles which go invisible against a white background and appear so intrusively against the black background of the young asthetic priest's pre-Vatican cassock, but then the French for the most part is spoken so slowly and carefully that we can follow the original with practice, which is always for the best in any case. It is also accompanied by the priest clearly chronicling in his journal the words we hear repeated, as we watch him write across the big screen, and thus this film from the start graciously supplies its own subtitles in the original.One great advanatge of this Criterion edition is the brilliant commentary. For once this is helpful, unlike for example the ubiquitous Mr. Carpenter in similar overdubbed commentaries, where the speaker mumbles like someone who believes they know much and actually parrot inanities which make you want to reach forward to the cinema seat before you and shyly demand their silence. Here the optional commentary as said before is brilliant, helpful, gracious, utterly informative and thought provoking, including when the nephew of the Count speaks of his fleeing for the Foreign Legion and the commentator draws a parallel explicitly to the current rush to war in Iraq with the grotesquely heretical hymn ""Onward, Christian Soldiers!""Every Catholic should see this film to remember life before the Second Vatican Council, in the time between the two wars, and the loneliness of our parish priets in their spiritual struggle as quasi-hermits in the wilderness. It is a delight to see the old vestments, kissed at the embrodiered cross, and to hear the Latin blessing with proper gestures. It is interesting to see the villagers's presuming our contemporary infamous evil in the priest's regard for the little girls he prepares for First Holy Communion.The commentator again provides useful information regarding the actor's preparation for this role. Yet as with any commentary no matter how excellent, we can neer take it as the last word. Indeed, we may read the young dying priest as archetype for the death of a way of life in the light of coming technological wonders and a new way of life. In another century he would have died alone slowly like a dog, as portrayed here, offering up his suffering and physical pain. Then we see him crossing the huge new train station in Lille struck by wonder and revelation as if in a modern secular cathedral. Surely this epiphany opens us to a jungian reading. It must at least bring us to reach for this amazon's access to old copies of Bernanos and associated commentaries as cited by Critierion's delightfully informative commentator.Truly this is a film which merits a place in your DVD and/or theological library.

790945,ANIMV3SPDD8SH,B000127IF2,Guy De Federicis,"[6, 6]","Possibly the diary itself should have been excluded in this transition of the Georges Bernanos novel to film. The book allowed the diary passages, which by book's end swelled in emotional intensity, to serve as evidence to the sainthood of the young country priest who believes himself a failure at uplifting the spirit of his depressed parish. Here, the diary passages, although sometimes humanely profound, contol the film systematically as a tool to forward the plot, and never successfully reveal the character.If you've never been moved by French author, Bernanos' powerful book, it's cinema counterpart may seem only dull and religious. If you have taken the book to heart however, there is a lot to admire here. The cold rural atmosphere can be felt like a chill to the bone in the bold, stark, black and white cinematography. The character actors surrounding the priest are a solid wall of antagonizing support. The young priest's joyous motorcycle ride is captured exactly as the book intended, as an unexpected escape from his mundane and painful life.Claude Layduin, in the title role, is often moving as the sole god-fearing man in a village of depraved religious intention, but his wise, godlike stares away from the camera, as if into the mist, upset the ignorance and humility of the character, who never for a moment believes himself to be worthy of God, the essence of the novel.This classic French film seems to be a victim of mixed reviews since it's 1950 premier. It would seem admirers of the book will also admire the film. Those unaware of the novel, may find it's greatest aspects here as well.",4,"CRITERION COLLECTION OF ""THE DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST""",1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,1618,"['Possibly', 'diary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'excluded', 'transition', 'Georges', 'Bernanos', 'novel', 'film', 'book', 'allowed', 'diary', 'passages', 'book', 'end', 'swelled', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'serve', 'evidence', 'sainthood', 'young', 'country', 'priest', 'who', 'failure', 'uplifting', 'spirit', 'depressed', 'parish', 'Here', 'diary', 'passages', 'sometimes', 'humanely', 'profound', 'contol', 'film', 'systematically', 'tool', 'forward', 'plot', 'never', 'successfully', 'reveal', 'character.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'moved', 'French', 'author', 'Bernanos', 'powerful', 'book', 'cinema', 'counterpart', 'may', 'seem', 'only', 'dull', 'religious', 'have', 'taken', 'book', 'heart', 'however', 'lot', 'admire', 'here', 'cold', 'rural', 'atmosphere', 'can', 'be', 'felt', 'chill', 'bone', 'bold', 'stark', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'character', 'actors', 'surrounding', 'priest', 'are', 'solid', 'wall', 'antagonizing', 'support', 'young', 'priest', 'joyous', 'motorcycle', 'ride', 'captured', 'exactly', 'book', 'intended', 'unexpected', 'escape', 'mundane', 'painful', 'life.Claude', 'Layduin', 'title', 'role', 'often', 'moving', 'sole', 'god-fearing', 'man', 'village', 'depraved', 'religious', 'intention', 'wise', 'godlike', 'stares', 'away', 'camera', 'mist', 'upset', 'ignorance', 'humility', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'moment', 'be', 'worthy', 'God', 'essence', 'novel.This', 'classic', 'French', 'film', 'be', 'victim', 'mixed', 'reviews', '1950', 'premier', 'would', 'seem', 'admirers', 'book', 'will', 'also', 'admire', 'film', 'unaware', 'novel', 'may', 'find', 'greatest', 'aspects', 'here', 'as', 'well']",N/A

790948,A2O7P0578BBFBB,B000127IF2,K. Doyle,"[2, 2]","Well worth a look, this well made movie is completely from the tormented viewpoint of the country priest via his journal.  I think it tells an important story, one worth serious contemplation.  But different people will get different things out if it.  Some may see it as inspiring, others as a cautionary tale.  I love the fact that it can be interpreted either way.  And perhaps in other ways as well, a real thought provoker.By coincidence, I happened to view this not long after watching the movie of Kurt Hamsun's ""Hunger.""  A movie also from the viewpoint of a lonely and troubled individual.  The similarities are interesting, as are the differences.  Both are clueless about reality, dumbfounded by its lack of fit with their idealisms about it.  Other people are mostly sources of confusion to them.  The priest is motivated by service, and the writer (in Hunger) by mere survival.  Both are completely incompetent at it, unable to connect with the rest of humanity in any meaningful way (though the priest does seem to make a little connection with another priest, that's about the extent of it).  Whether their psychological states could be said to be anything but disfunctional, is undoubtedly a matter of interesting debate from either side.My first impression is that the priest's torment, like the writer's in ""Hunger,"" was largely self-imposed, or at least, derived from his inability to recognize his own ignorance and do something useful about it.  Certainly, the townspeople were far less than model citizens, but this should not be all that surprising given the lack of solid priestly capabilities.  It seems to me that the young priest was not cut out for his job, wallowing in his sorrows which did himself no good and his parishoners a disservice.  His stomach problems seem a metaphor for the effects in the real world of his inability to understand much of anything.  He could not stomach the world, and the world had little stomach for him.  He does not offer what I would call a positive spiritual contribution, is a pain-in-the-gut for everyone else in one way or another, not just himself.  While he appears to have some empathy with others, I would say that it is merely imagined, as it seems only to arise in ways that are nonconstructive or inappropriate.  He seems to think he did well in his conversation with the countess, but it's not at all clear that the effect was actually a positive one.  It takes more than mere suffering to be a saint, one must also grow a backbone.  One must be able to effectively communicate.  Otherwise, say hello to self-indulgent masochism, blind fanaticism, or perhaps, just really lousy luck.  Like ""Hunger,"" ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" is akin to a train-wreck in slow motion.I say my ""first impression,"" here, because I suspect I will have other thoughts about it upon additional reflection and additional viewings.

Both Bresson and Bernanos are masters at understatement, and so a story that so easily could've become bloated with easy piety instead becomes a portrait of holiness.The young cure of Ambricourt (Claude Laydu) finds himself in a parish where everyone mocks or despises him.  The local comte dislikes him because the cure knows he's having an affair with his daughter's tutor.  The school children mock him because he's youthful and inexperienced.  His fellow priests waffle between pity and scorn for what they see as his weakness.  And it doesn't help that the cure is plagued by ill health--he eventually dies of stomach cancer--and spiritual dryness.Yet even in all his suffering and private and public humiliations, and despite his own self-doubts, he exudes a purity born of love that gives him a strength he isn't quite aware he possesses.  A perceptive canon tells him at one point that ""Your simplicity is like a flame that burns,"" and this is why, the canon concludes, the cure's parishioners so dislike him.  Sanctity is an affront to people whose lives are fractured by bad choices, carelessness, and a refusal to love.The Cure of Ambricourt's spiritual journey reminds one of Teresa, the ""Little Flower,"" who famously defended the spiritual path of simplicity and smallness.  Sainthood isn't necessarily dramatic or flashy.  It can also be characterized, as the film's Priest of Torcy says, in ""doing little things, day by day, while [one] waits"" for God.Cinematography, directing, and acting are superb.  Laydu's performance is as unforced and simple as it had to be to do justice to his character.  The robust but not unspiritual priest of Torcy, played by a psychiatrist(Adrien Borel) who had no previous acting experience, is touching. Nicole Ladmiral's portrayal of the troubled adolescent Chantal is heartbreaking.  Tragically, Ladmiral's promising career was cut short when she (apparently deliberately) threw herself under a Paris subway car in 1958.Ten stars.",5,Simplicity like a burning flame,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",2008,2066,"['Bresson', 'adaptation', 'Bernanos', 'novel', 'one', 'most', 'perfect', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Bresson', 'Bernanos', 'are', 'masters', 'understatement', 'so', 'story', 'so', 'easily', 'could', ""'ve"", 'become', 'bloated', 'easy', 'piety', 'instead', 'portrait', 'holiness.The', 'young', 'cure', 'Ambricourt', 'Claude', 'Laydu', 'parish', 'where', 'everyone', 'local', 'comte', 'dislikes', 'cure', 'having', 'affair', 'daughter', 'tutor', 'school', 'children', 'mock', 'youthful', 'inexperienced', 'fellow', 'priests', 'waffle', 'pity', 'scorn', 'what', 'see', 'weakness', ""n't"", 'help', 'cure', 'plagued', 'ill', 'health', 'eventually', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'spiritual', 'dryness.Yet', 'even', 'suffering', 'private', 'public', 'humiliations', 'own', 'self-doubts', 'purity', 'born', 'love', 'strength', ""n't"", 'quite', 'aware', 'perceptive', 'canon', 'one', 'point', 'simplicity', 'flame', 'why', 'canon', 'cure', 'parishioners', 'so', 'Sanctity', 'affront', 'people', 'lives', 'are', 'fractured', 'bad', 'choices', 'carelessness', 'refusal', 'love.The', 'Cure', 'Ambricourt', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'one', 'Teresa', 'Little', 'Flower', 'who', 'famously', 'defended', 'spiritual', 'path', 'simplicity', 'smallness', 'Sainthood', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'dramatic', 'flashy', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'characterized', 'film', 'Priest', 'Torcy', 'doing', 'little', 'things', 'day', 'day', '[', 'one', ']', 'waits', 'God.Cinematography', 'directing', 'acting', 'are', 'superb', 'Laydu', 'performance', 'unforced', 'simple', 'had', 'be', 'do', 'justice', 'character', 'robust', 'not', 'unspiritual', 'priest', 'Torcy', 'played', 'psychiatrist', 'Adrien', 'Borel', 'who', 'had', 'previous', 'acting', 'experience', 'touching', 'Nicole', 'Ladmiral', 'portrayal', 'troubled', 'adolescent', 'Chantal', 'heartbreaking', 'Tragically', 'Ladmiral', 'promising', 'career', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'apparently', 'deliberately', 'threw', 'Paris', 'subway', 'car', '1958.Ten', 'stars']",N/A

As swiftly as the priest arrives he is discouraged by the unfriendly atmosphere that surrounds him in the village.  His discouragement leads him on a path of spiritual and cerebral suffering as he struggles with his faith in God and humanity.  Besides the intellectual struggle the priest is suffering physically from an illness in his abdomen that has forced him on a rare diet based on old bread that he softens in sweetened wine.  Unselfishly, the priest continues to face-up to the adversity of his environment as he clasps on to remains of his minuscule faith.  Bresson's vision of the priest is visually stunning as the film emotionally draws the audience into a vortex of thoughts, feelings, and presence.  In the process, Bresson communicates his philosophical message with daunting simplicity as he removes all the miscues that could distort his position.

What I intend is that Bresson (a Catholic himself) is more interested in the 'deeply spiritual' (for want of a more precise phrase) meanings conveyable by the medium than in wanton demonstrations of directoral flair. I feel that the Amazon reviewer is correct in his assertion that &quot;Bresson charts the priest's collapse with a series of brief scenes, a minimalist style that makes the slightest touch of a hand or far-off sound of a dog barking seem magnified in importance.&quot; Herein lies my (personal) problem with the film: I am not overly patient and, quite frankly, for me this film was a bit of a drag.

The theology was relevant and on-the-mark.  The movie proceeded from that point in a sort of self-destructing manner and the ending was intentially anti-climatic (depending on your perspective of faith in general).There was a lot that interested me during the movie and I even used some of it in the sermon the next day.  The relationship of priest to parishioner, the need for the priest to be there at the right moments and nowhere to be seen at the wrong moments, the loneliness of the job (for some),etc, were pretty well examined.  I couldn't help but be disappointed in how ""Diary of a Country Priest"" portrayed the priest and his job in such a dismal way.

790956,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000127IF2,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST, (1951).  This black and white, classic 115 minute French film was adapted by acclaimed French director Robert Bresson, (LES DAMES DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE),from a well-known French novel by Georges Bernanos.  It concerns the priest of the small French village of Ambricourt, in the vicinity of Lille .It appears to take place at an earlier time, perhaps in the 1930s, before the outbreak of World War II.  The title priest, played by non-actor Claude Laydu, is a reserved and dedicated young man, new to the job, whose inability to mesh in social situations causes him to feel isolated from the very population he's supposed to be serving. His health problems add to his troubles, making him unable to carry out some of his obligations. As he grows sicker and ever more confused as to what his life really means, the priest feels himself further distanced from his village and from God.  This cerebral  film, Bresson&#8217;s fourth, done in the minimalist style that Bresson was to make his own, largely with amateur actors,  is often considered Bresson&#8217;s first masterpiece: he both wrote the screenplay and directed. The DVD also features commentary  by film historian Peter Cowie.This film is powerful, but very, very slow.  It requires close attention to detail in order to understand it.  And it strongly reminds me of the Austrian Michael Haneke &#8216;s WHITE RIBBON, made more than 60 years later.  Or, more logically, WHITE RIBBON is a reminder of this earlier French film.  Both tell the story of sensitive souls crushed  by the hostile, malicious inhabitants of a small isolated village.  However, in Haneke&#8217;s film, we are given no explanation for the malice of the village, and particularly its children; just the thought that growing up in a village like that was enough to create Nazis.  Or perhaps it was just growing up speaking German.  At any rate, in DIARY, we are given an explanation; I expect from the novel upon which it is based.  Several characters remark that locals in that vicinity are all hobbled by having been born descended from generations of drunks; and that, furthermore, they were also probably malnourished as children. Mind you, we had particular difficulty in this house in benefiting from this film, as, unfortunately, we were not able to turn off the intrusive commentary by Cowie.  Ultimately, the only thing we could think to do was to set the TV controls to mute, thereby missing out on the atmosphere of the spoken French, and just reading the English subtitles.Both  Bresson, and Bernanos were devoted Catholics.  In fact, the movie&#8217;s most famous line, &#34;All is grace,&#8221; according to the Internet Movie Database, is a quotation from Therese de Lisieux, a saint to whom novelist Georges Bernanos was deeply devoted.  Regretfully, I doubt this film would appeal to a wide, general audience, or to anyone lacking a particular interest in it: an interest in French history, or Bresson,  or French film, or religious and spiritual dramas, or faith and spirituality.  If you have any doubts, I&#8217;d recommend just streaming it prior to any purchase.",3,Powerful Film that Requires Close Attention,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,3139,"['DIARY', 'A', 'COUNTRY', 'PRIEST', '1951', 'black', 'white', 'classic', '115', 'minute', 'French', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'acclaimed', 'French', 'director', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'LES', 'DAMES', 'DU', 'BOIS', 'DE', 'BOULOGNE', 'well-known', 'French', 'novel', 'Georges', 'Bernanos', 'priest', 'small', 'French', 'village', 'Ambricourt', 'vicinity', 'Lille', '.It', 'take', 'place', 'earlier', 'time', 'perhaps', '1930s', 'outbreak', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'title', 'priest', 'played', 'non-actor', 'Claude', 'Laydu', 'reserved', 'dedicated', 'young', 'man', 'new', 'job', 'inability', 'mesh', 'social', 'situations', 'feel', 'isolated', 'very', 'population', 'supposed', 'be', 'serving', 'health', 'problems', 'add', 'troubles', 'making', 'unable', 'carry', 'out', 'obligations', 'sicker', 'ever', 'more', 'confused', 'what', 'life', 'really', 'priest', 'further', 'distanced', 'village', 'God', 'cerebral', 'film', 'Bresson', '8217', 's', 'fourth', 'done', 'minimalist', 'style', 'Bresson', 'was', 'make', 'own', 'largely', 'amateur', 'actors', 'often', 'considered', 'Bresson', '8217', 'first', 'masterpiece', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'directed', 'DVD', 'also', 'commentary', 'film', 'historian', 'Peter', 'Cowie.This', 'film', 'powerful', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'close', 'attention', 'detail', 'order', 'understand', 'strongly', 'Austrian', 'Michael', 'Haneke', '8216', 'WHITE', 'RIBBON', 'made', 'more', '60', 'years', 'later', 'more', 'logically', 'WHITE', 'RIBBON', 'reminder', 'earlier', 'French', 'film', 'tell', 'story', 'sensitive', 'souls', 'crushed', 'hostile', 'malicious', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'isolated', 'village', 'However', 'Haneke', '8217', 'film', 'are', 'given', 'explanation', 'malice', 'village', 'particularly', 'children', 'just', 'thought', 'growing', 'up', 'village', 'was', 'enough', 'create', 'Nazis', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'growing', 'up', 'speaking', 'German', 'rate', 'DIARY', 'are', 'given', 'explanation', 'expect', 'novel', 'based', 'Several', 'characters', 'remark', 'locals', 'vicinity', 'are', 'hobbled', 'having', 'been', 'born', 'descended', 'generations', 'drunks', 'furthermore', 'were', 'also', 'probably', 'malnourished', 'children', 'Mind', 'had', 'particular', 'difficulty', 'house', 'benefiting', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'were', 'not', 'able', 'turn', 'off', 'intrusive', 'commentary', 'Cowie', 'Ultimately', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'think', 'do', 'was', 'set', 'TV', 'controls', 'mute', 'thereby', 'missing', 'out', 'atmosphere', 'spoken', 'French', 'just', 'reading', 'English', 'subtitles.Both', 'Bresson', 'Bernanos', 'were', 'devoted', 'Catholics', 'fact', 'movie', '8217', 'most', 'famous', 'line', '34', 'grace', '8221', 'according', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'quotation', 'Therese', 'de', 'Lisieux', 'saint', 'whom', 'novelist', 'Georges', 'Bernanos', 'was', 'deeply', 'devoted', 'Regretfully', 'doubt', 'film', 'would', 'appeal', 'wide', 'general', 'audience', 'anyone', 'lacking', 'particular', 'interest', 'interest', 'French', 'history', 'Bresson', 'French', 'film', 'religious', 'spiritual', 'dramas', 'faith', 'spirituality', 'have', 'doubts', '8217', 'd', 'recommend', 'just', 'streaming', 'prior', 'purchase']",N/A

The emotional power builds up through use of minimal dialogue and camera- in- face shots-the man's final moments distilled and captured in a single shot. The final image of an isolated cross encapsulates the profound suffering of this nameless priest.His last words:""What does it matter?All is grace"".The priest is free at last.Based on a novel by Bernanos,given treatment of a high order.",5,A remarkable film,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3056,"['young', 'Priest', 'French', 'rural', 'village', 'disliked', 'villagers.He', 'unknown', 'stomach', 'ailment', 'weak', 'ailing', 'living', 'diet', 'bread', 'soaked', 'sugar', 'wine.Being', 'austere', 'idealistic', 'save', 'souls.People', 'want', 'things', 'nothing', 'rich', 'farmer', 'old', 'Fabregars', 'who', 'cheap', 'no-cost', 'funeral', 'wife.The', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'web', 'problems', 'wife', 'mistress', 'daughter.He', 'told', 'priestly', 'mentor', 'change', 'eating', 'habits.He', 'often', 'faint', 'morose.He', 'needs', 'toughen', 'up', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'loved', 'give', 'spiritual', 'discipline.He', 'masochistic', 'misery', 'martyrdom.He', 'identifies', 'Christ', 'Golgotha.Bresson', 'priest', 'isolated', 'lonely', 'need', 'love', 'approval.He', 'highlights', 'aspect', 'showing', 'glass', 'seen', 'window', 'frames.It', 'may', 'be', 'raining', 'snowing', 'outside', 'trapped', 'cell', 'imprisoned', 'own', 'mind.He', 'drawn', 'similarly', 'lonely', 'people', 'Countess', 'Seraphita', 'Chantal', 'Dr.Delbende.The', 'Journal', 'voiceover', 'are', 'Bresson', 'primary', 'means', 'detail', 'Priest', 'Ambricourt', 'inner', 'life.The', 'very', 'real', 'writing', 'pen', 'paper', 'repetitive', 'ritual', 'film', 'blotting', 'scratching', 'closing', 'capturing', 'soul', 'immaterial', 'thoughts', 'ideas', 'emotions.Similarly', 'raking', 'ground', 'mirrors', 'lining', 'stomach.He', 'psychological', 'misfit.He', 'mocked', 'tormented', 'favoured', 'student', 'Seraphita', 'catechism', 'classes.The', 'Count', 'interfering', 'family.He', 'Count', 'barn', 'empty', 'field', 'barren', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'more', 'productive', 'uses', 'villagers.He', 'been', 'asked', 'Governess', 'Louise', 'intercede', 'conflict', 'involving', 'pupil', 'Chantal', 'Count', 'daughter.Chantal', 'priest', 'compassion', 'threatening', 'suicide', 'manipulative', 'scorn', 'priest.In', 'film', 'most', 'central', 'scene', 'drawn', 'ministering', 'Countess', 'imparting', 'suspicions', 'Chantal.He', 'death', 'death', 'more.She', 'tormented', 'grieves', 'loss', 'son.He', 'helping', 'find', 'inner', 'peace.He', 'miracle', 'being', 'able', 'give', 'what', ""n't"", 'have', 'himself.Chantal', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'change', 'mother', 'actions', 'cruel', 'denounce', 'idealistic', 'priest.Bresson', 'film', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'spiritual', 'life', 'physical', 'malady', 'journal', 'entries', 'use', 'long', 'short', 'shots', 'harsh', 'reality', 'existence', 'man', 'faith', 'secular', 'world.He', 'slowly', 'consumed', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'learn', 'later', 'emotional', 'power', 'up', 'use', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'camera-', 'in-', 'face', 'shots-the', 'man', 'final', 'moments', 'distilled', 'captured', 'single', 'shot', 'final', 'image', 'isolated', 'cross', 'profound', 'suffering', 'nameless', 'priest.His', 'last', 'words', 'What', 'matter', 'grace', '.The', 'priest', 'free', 'last.Based', 'novel', 'Bernanos', 'given', 'treatment', 'high', 'order']",N/A

790960,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B000127IF2,Turfseer,"[5, 11]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Throughout the years, the 'passion story' of Jesus has always remained the bedrock of the Catholic church. Although respected, the story of the suffering of a man who lived 2,000 years ago no longer has the same impact it once did in earlier times. In our own time, the average 'believer' looks to the narratives of film for spiritual enlightenment. That's why the Catholic church of today has placed great importance on creating a list of great movies that reflect their values. 'Diary of a Country List' however is not on the Vatican Top 45. That's because director Robert Bresson's modern day Jesus figure, the Priest of Ambricourt, becomes a martyr after being rejected by the Church establishment.Diary of a Country Priest is based on a novel written by George Bernanos in the early 30s. The film was made in 1950 but the pre-World War II setting is retained from the novel. The Priest (who is never named in the film) is an intense young man played by Claude Laydu (in his first film role). The Priest doesn't fit in at all in the village of Ambricourt. He actually suffers from what appears to be colitis (later diagnosed as stomach cancer) and subsists mainly on bread and wine. The rumor starts going around in the Village that he's an alcoholic. The village children don't understand his sophisticated catechisms except for one--Seraphita--who initially impresses the Priest with her knowledge of church doctrine. But when he asks her why she takes her studies so seriously, Seraphita mocks him by answering that he has beautiful eyes. Her schoolmates have all been listening to their conversation at the door to the rectory and burst out laughing at her retort.The Priest obviously isn't very happy by the town's indifferent bordering on hostile reaction to his ministry but he trudges on. His mentor, the Priest of Torcy, is a much more outgoing and practical man who advises him to take control by establishing some kind of 'order' in dealing with his parishioners. Unfortunately, that's just not the Young Priest's style. He's much more blunt and often says exactly what's on his mind. The Priest's faith is tested early on when a physician he consulted for his stomach troubles ends up committing suicide.The core of the narrative involves the Priest's relationship with a local Count and Countess who live on a nearby estate. The Priest hopes to convince the Count to donate money and some unused land for a youth center; the Count at first is receptive and promises to consider the Priest's proposal. Unfortunately, the Priest cannot ignore the fact that the Count is having an affair with the governess at the estate. To make matters worse, the Count's daughter, Chantal, is extremely angry with her father over his affair with the governess and threatens to run away (or even worse, commit suicide). The Priest dissuades the young girl from taking any rash action but refuses to be tactful with the Count, pointing out to him that his daughter is extremely troubled. The Count pegs the Priest as a meddler and makes it clear that his comments aren't welcome.Even worse is the Priest's counseling sessions with the Countess who has been grieving for years over the death of her young son. At first the Countess makes it clear that she's lost all faith in God but the determined Priest manages to get her to look on the bright side once again. Ironically, the Countess drops dead hours after his last counseling session with her and the Count and the rest of the townspeople blame the Priest for 'exciting' the Countess and perhaps hastening (or even causing) her death. As a result, the priest is now 'persona non grata' in the town. He meets with the Priest of Torcy who patronizes him by insisting that his 'alcoholism' stems from (an early version of) fetal alcohol syndrome. He also advises the Priest not to meet with Chantal as he describes her as a 'demon' but the Priest insists he must minister to all--even those who are obviously lost.In some respects, Bresson's updated passion tale echoes the original source material (i.e. The New Testament). Jesus's suffering is blamed on the Jews in the New Testament but here the Priest is cast off by cold and unfeeling townspeople supported by the punitive clergy. This appears to be the primary weakness of Bresson's story. Except for the mature Seraphita who comforts the Priest after he collapses due to abdominal pains and Chantal's cousin, the suave Olivier, who offers up a relaxing motorcycle ride as the Priest journeys to a neighboring town to obtain a consult with a physician, the bulk of the characters are all quite mean-spirited. It's the old stab-in-the-back mentality and Bresson is not immune to employing this device when serving up his newly minted Jesus figure.There's more martyrdom in store for our hapless Priest. Sure enough, not only is he cast out by his parishioners but must endure the final crushing diagnosis: stomach cancer. The ordeal of fire is a modern one--instead of crucifixion on a cross, the Priest endures the modern 'crucifixion' of dying an agonizing death from cancer. The final image is one of the cross and like Jesus, the Priest maintains his faith despite all the suffering.Bresson curiously has been described as an 'agnostic' but I think that's a misnomer. Rather, he accepts the Christian faith but views himself as outside the establishment. Diary of a Country Priest is worth watching a number of times, especially in terms of the gripping cinematography (reminiscent of films from the silent era) as well as the superb use of off-screen audio. Film scholar Peter Cowie's commentary is valuable as he compares the film to the novel. I disagree with his evaluation however, that the film is a masterpiece. The Diary has its thoughtful moments but in the end it's more propaganda than art.",3,Mean-spirited antagonists undermine otherwise thoughtful tale of modern-day Jesus figure,1274054400,"05 17,
