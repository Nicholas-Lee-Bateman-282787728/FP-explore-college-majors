Smith,"[1, 5]","Matt Dillon wrote, directed and acted in this sort of pulp fiction tale about a con artist feeling guilty about bilking victims of a Hurricane Katrina-like mess. The cutting is a little too quick and the muddled plot  is hard to follow for most of the movie. The soundtrack gets annoying with its endless southeast Asian whining sounds. James Caan is interesting, as usual. Maybe if Dillon had not tried to do too much, this film would have come out better. As it stands, it's worth a watch, I guess.

769141,A1MIJKZQ1MIRBM,B0000AZKP8,C. Law,"[2, 2]","With CITY OF GHOSTS, actor Matt Dillon makes his directorial debut and, before this, I almost forgot how much I actually could like the guy. Other than THERE""S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and his supporting role in DEUCES WILD I feel like I haven't seen Dillon all that much. CITY OF GHOST S made me actually want to see more of him. He's a talented actor and it really should come as no surprise that he eventually wound up behind the camera after working with such directors as Francis Ford Copolla (THE OUTSIDERS) and Gus Van Sant (DRUGSTORE COWBOY).The film follows Jimmy (Dillon), an amoral insurance scam artist who, when the FBI shows up asking questions, hightails it to Cambodia to hunt for his supervisor, Marvin (James Caan), who may also be his legitimate father.It isn't the story of CITY OF GHOSTS that is remarkable though. It's not that there's anything wrong with the story but, all in all, the film's story is somewhat predictable. Aside from the exotic locales the film doesn't really break any new ground. What is remarkable is Dillon's talent in the director's chair and his ability to capture the picturesque beauty of the film's foreign locales (the film was really shot in Cambodia). That's what makes it such a pleasure to watch. You really feel as if Dillon's character is a stranger in a strange land because he as an actor really is and that keeps you involved with the story throughout, even if the film could have benefited from being trimmed down a good twenty minutes or so shorter.CITY OF GHOSTS also stars Gerard Depardieu (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK; 1492), Rose Byrne (TWO HANDS; TROY), Natasha McElehone (THE DEVIL'S OWN; SOLARIS), and Stellan Skarsgaard (RONIN; DEEP BLUE SEA).C",3,The exotic locales and its director make it worth watching..,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,1707,"['CITY', 'OF', 'GHOSTS', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'directorial', 'debut', 'almost', 'forgot', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'could', 'like', 'guy', 'Other', 'THERE', 'S', 'SOMETHING', 'ABOUT', 'MARY', 'supporting', 'role', 'DEUCES', 'WILD', 'feel', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Dillon', 'that', 'much', 'CITY', 'OF', 'GHOST', 'S', 'made', 'actually', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'talented', 'actor', 'really', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'eventually', 'wound', 'up', 'camera', 'working', 'such', 'directors', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Copolla', 'THE', 'OUTSIDERS', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'DRUGSTORE', 'COWBOY', '.The', 'film', 'Jimmy', 'Dillon', 'amoral', 'insurance', 'scam', 'artist', 'who', 'when', 'FBI', 'up', 'asking', 'questions', 'Cambodia', 'hunt', 'supervisor', 'Marvin', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'legitimate', 'father.It', ""n't"", 'story', 'CITY', 'OF', 'GHOSTS', 'remarkable', 'not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'story', 'film', 'story', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'Aside', 'exotic', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'What', 'remarkable', 'Dillon', 'talent', 'director', 'chair', 'ability', 'capture', 'picturesque', 'beauty', 'film', 'foreign', 'locales', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'shot', 'Cambodia', 'what', 'such', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'really', 'feel', 'Dillon', 'character', 'stranger', 'strange', 'land', 'because', 'actor', 'really', 'involved', 'story', 'even', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'being', 'trimmed', 'down', 'good', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'shorter.CITY', 'OF', 'GHOSTS', 'also', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'THE', 'MAN', 'IN', 'THE', 'IRON', 'MASK', '1492', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'TWO', 'HANDS', 'TROY', 'Natasha', 'McElehone', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'OWN', 'SOLARIS', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgaard', 'RONIN', 'DEEP', 'BLUE', 'SEA', '.C']",N/A

769143,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B0000AZKP8,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[2, 3]","Wasn't quite sure what the title of this movie was meant to convey.  Perhaps that the characters were ghostlike?  From the title, I expected a very different movie than what actually unfolded.  There are no supernatural beings (ghosts) portrayed in this movie.  Having lived in both Vietnam and Thailand for a number of months, I presume Cambodia is similar in look and feel.  This movie really captures the feel of the region.  I don't think I have seen a movie capture the flavor of a place as well as this one; not even documentaries.  This couldn't have been made on a movie set; they must have done it mostly in Thailand.  I wonder if they actually did go to Cambodia for some of the filming?  The characters are believable too.  What would have made this a near perfect movie would have been a better plot.  The plot was a little difficult to follow and seemed a little thin at times.  I never did quite figure out what exactly was going on, but given that the story was about con men, perhaps that was part of the point?  Not an easy movie to watch because it is hard to pick a hero to identify with, as almost everyone is either a con or just trying to survive in a harsh environment.  This movie is a little different than most of the standard action/adventure movies we see.  It lumbers along, never really picking up any momentum.  On the other hand, it never gets boring; the pace keeps up just enough to keep you interested.  It would be hard to doze off during this movie, but you aren't going to be on the edge of your seat either.  It is a movie that is merely quite good but with a little effort could have been wonderful.I think it is worth watching just because it is a little different and doesn't follow a standard formula.

More importantly however, is that this film is from first-time director and star Matt Dillon. Jimmy (Matt Dillon) is a con man who hurriedly travels to Cambodia. He does so because he and his elusive partner Marvin (James Caan) have just swindled money from the insurance company they run. With disaster claims piling up, and the U.S. law enforcement agents hot on his heels, he decides it is better to seek out his partner and collect his share of the money while he can. However, Jimmy is in for more than he expected. [Guess he never watched ""The Killing Fields""].Cambodia is shown in all its squalor; and the hardships of life the people must endure in order to survive in this very poor country are not lost on the viewer. There is an odd assortment of foreigners in the country that Jimmy meets while staying in a Hotel; which was once in its more glorious times, under French occupation, a high class place. But Cambodia has fallen on very hard times for many years now, and the ameneties we take for granted are not to be found here. Emile (Gerard Depardieu) runs the hotel, and he is a very quirky man by nature. However, it is the character of Joseph Kaspar (Stellan Skarsgard) whom Jimmy meets and strikes up a semi-friendship with that is the center of the story.There is more to Kaspar and Jimmy's partner Marvin, than Jimmy realizes. And it is here that Jimmy confronts a lesson in life he will soon not forget. One of the mains reasons I liked this film was the countryside and the Cambodian people themselves shown in the film. And also the way in which the conditions of Cambodia were shown. No need for special effects here. You get everything: from the feel of the people, the nature of corruption, and hardship that life in Cambodia must be like. Moreover, after viewing the film I was impressed with how a first-time director was able to pull off such a difficult feat.Matt Dillon was able to shoot this film in Cambodia and did so in a very touching way. The music is haunting, as is the picture, and I left the theatre afterwards with a feeling of sadness. Afterall, this is Cambodia were talking about. The country is as chaotic today, as it was in the past. Albeit not to the same extremes as Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, which tore the country apart. Nonetheless, the difficulties must have been tremendous. And for a first time director, Dillon pulled it off wonderfully. I recommend the film with caution, it may not appeal to all viewers, however, I thought the film was great.",5,"An Excellent Film, But Not For Everyone: Underrated!",1161561600,"10 23, 2006",2006,2642,"['City', 'Ghosts', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'viewed', 'film', 'More', 'importantly', 'however', 'film', 'first-time', 'director', 'star', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Jimmy', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'hurriedly', 'Cambodia', 'so', 'elusive', 'partner', 'Marvin', 'James', 'Caan', 'have', 'just', 'swindled', 'money', 'insurance', 'company', 'run', 'disaster', 'claims', 'piling', 'up', 'U.S.', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agents', 'hot', 'heels', 'better', 'seek', 'out', 'partner', 'collect', 'share', 'money', 'can', 'However', 'Jimmy', 'more', 'expected', '[', 'Guess', 'never', 'watched', 'Killing', 'Fields', ']', '.Cambodia', 'shown', 'squalor', 'hardships', 'life', 'people', 'must', 'endure', 'order', 'survive', 'very', 'poor', 'country', 'are', 'not', 'lost', 'viewer', 'odd', 'assortment', 'foreigners', 'country', 'Jimmy', 'meets', 'staying', 'Hotel', 'was', 'once', 'more', 'glorious', 'times', 'French', 'occupation', 'high', 'class', 'place', 'Cambodia', 'fallen', 'very', 'hard', 'times', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'ameneties', 'take', 'granted', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Emile', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'hotel', 'very', 'quirky', 'man', 'nature', 'However', 'character', 'Joseph', 'Kaspar', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'whom', 'Jimmy', 'meets', 'up', 'semi-friendship', 'center', 'story.There', 'more', 'Kaspar', 'Jimmy', 'partner', 'Marvin', 'Jimmy', 'realizes', 'here', 'Jimmy', 'lesson', 'life', 'will', 'soon', 'not', 'forget', 'One', 'mains', 'reasons', 'liked', 'film', 'was', 'countryside', 'Cambodian', 'people', 'shown', 'film', 'also', 'way', 'conditions', 'Cambodia', 'were', 'shown', 'need', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'get', 'everything', 'feel', 'people', 'nature', 'corruption', 'hardship', 'life', 'Cambodia', 'must', 'be', 'Moreover', 'viewing', 'film', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'first-time', 'director', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'difficult', 'feat.Matt', 'Dillon', 'was', 'able', 'shoot', 'film', 'Cambodia', 'did', 'so', 'very', 'touching', 'way', 'music', 'haunting', 'picture', 'left', 'theatre', 'afterwards', 'feeling', 'sadness', 'Afterall', 'Cambodia', 'were', 'talking', 'about', 'country', 'chaotic', 'today', 'was', 'past', 'Albeit', 'not', 'same', 'Pol', 'Pot', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'tore', 'country', 'apart', 'Nonetheless', 'difficulties', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'tremendous', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Dillon', 'pulled', 'off', 'wonderfully', 'recommend', 'film', 'caution', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'however', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'great']",N/A

769152,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0000AZKP8,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 6]","""City of Ghosts"" is a film that makes you sweat.  It looks hot.  When Emile the inn keeper (Gerard Depardieu) rents Jimmy a room with an air conditioner that lays in pieces on the floor, you know it's not going to chill out anytime soon.  Dillon does a good job capturing the third world vibe.  As a story, it kind of ambles along as Jimmy leaves New York to find Marvin played by James Caan.  Then we learn that Jimmy's dad may be Marvin and that if there is no honor among thieves, blood is still thicker than water.  The moral compass of the film comes from Sereyvuth Kem as the rickshaw driver Sok who comes into quite a sum and leaves part of it to Buddah.  Natascha McElhone is a tremendous actress who keeps getting stuck in small films.  Yes, she did a great job in ""Devil's Own"" with Brad Pitt, but others like ""Laurel Canyon,"" ""Love's Labour's Lost"" and ""Ladies in Lavender"" have shown her to be over-talented and under-cast.  She does a great job in a limited role as she flirts with Jimmy and apparently has enough influence to reform his ethics.  Stellan Skarsgard plays Caan's honcho Kaspar who betrays him when push comes to shove.  He won the Silver Bear award in Berlin for Best Actor for ""Den Enfaldige Mordaren"" as an abused lad and has appeared in ""Good Will Hunting.""  He does a great sweaty job as the weak-willed man who falls in love with a Bangkok girl who gets whacked by the Russian mob.  The film's story did get a bit bogged down.  You had a Russian mob, the Cambodian general who was corrupt, various street gangs, Gerard Depardieu's monkey and the FBI who seemingly disappeared about a quarter of the way into the film all seeming to gang up on Jimmy.  One never really figures out how the crime gets settled.  Along the way, backpackers get legs chopped off and blown up in a mine field, which apparently was a momentary misleading toward an obscure ending.  But maybe the point was the love story; and Natascha McElhone's role just was sufficiently overlooked as Jimmy tries to work out the issues from his past.  I thought this film was filled with memorable performances.  The problem is all the sweat.  This is a good film to rent during a winter snowstorm.

769153,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0000AZKP8,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 6]","Matt Dillon directed this film, and was also one of the writers.  He stars in it too.The film starts in an aftermath of a hurricane on the East Coast, with interviews of people who have lost their homes. We soon become aware, however, that the insurance company on which they depended, and which is based outside the United States, has no money to pay the claims. The investigation finds Matt Dillon running the insurance company's New York office and it seems that he is completely innocent.  Suddenly, though, he takes off for Bangkok and then on into Cambodia in search of the man who was behind the scam.  His relationship with the top guy, played by James Cain, is complicated though and, as the story moves along, the plot thickens.Gerard Depardieu is cast as one of those expatriates who runs a sleazy hotel in Cambodia.  His performance shines and this is clearly the best and most convincing role in the film.  Everyone else, including a local Cambodian who helps our hero and a blonde babe archeologist who Dillon romances, are just there to help the setting of the fast moving, but impossible plot.In my opinion, though, the star of the film is Cambodia itself.  The cinematography was great and I came away with a sense of place that is rare in a plot-driven film. The story did hold my attention, as there were some interesting twists and turns of the story and was generally well done.  As it wasn't targeted to an audience looking for an artsy or meaningful film, it definitely fulfilled its limited purposed.  Every film does not have to be an Academy Award winner.  Some are just for pure entertainment.  And for that reason, this film gets a modest recommendation from me..",4,A rare sense of place for a plot driven film.

Palm, Inc. was sponsoring the event and I was lucky enough to be invited. Given the pre-party and the potential for celebrities to attend (there were none), I was pretty hyped. Loving movies like I do, this was the one of the best of all possible worlds in which to see this movie - it didn't help.""City of Ghosts"" is Matt Dillion's first shot at directing and writing a film and it shows. The main character, Jimmy Cremming, is supposed to be this un-trusting scam artist that's been trained in it all his life. That may sound good on paper, but you have to demonstrate it on the screen and Dillion simply refused to show his character as un-sympathetic. If the character has grown up grifiting and scamming then there should be some evidence of it in his demeanor at least and there just isn't. As a result, the main character has no story arc. Although he is supposedly going through a transformation, there is no evidence of it.None of the major characters have any depth or range to them either. James Cann walked through this role, Stellan Skarsgard does nothing but play a drunk and Natascha McElhone was nothing but eye candy. A lot of good talent that was simply wasted. There were two notable exceptions. Two actors were able to brake out of the bad script enough to create a character that you could actually care for. Gerard Depardieu plays a very funny inn keeper/bartender. His role could have been almost forgotten, yet instead Depardieu instilled such humor and compassion in his role that it's one of the more memorable. The other actor was Kem Sereyvuth, who plays Sok, the local rickshaw operator who takes a liking to Jimmy Cremming and vice versa. Sereyvuth may have been type casted a bit in his role, I don't know much about him, but his portrayal is honest and sincere. You get the feeling that they found the actor pulling a rickshaw and gave him a job. I'm sure that's not the case, but it's a testimony to his acting ability.There is one facet of the movie that I greatly enjoyed and that was the portrayal of Cambodia. I have traveled some, but I've never been to Cambodia. Having said that, I got the feeling that I had truly traveled there. The use of music and the almost documentary style of the cinematography in the early portions of the movie transports you into another place.

769155,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0000AZKP8,mirasreviews,"[16, 18]","Jimmy (Matt Dillon) sold disaster insurance in New York until a federal investigation made it clear that his company was engaging in fraud, selling insurance with no intention of paying on claims. Jimmy knows where his boss, Marvin, can be found, and he travels to Cambodia to track him down. Marvin (James Caan) is laying low and working on his next business venture, trying to entice a powerful and corrupt Cambodian general to invest in a resort complex. A business associate of Marvin's, Kaspar (Stellan Skarsgard), may or may not be trying to help Jimmy, but is becoming increasingly anxious about getting his share of the loot from the insurance scam. The situation goes from uneasy to harrowing when the constant scheming and backstabbing of these Western con men becomes intertwined with the lawlessness of a post-war Cambodia. And it begins to look as if no one will come to a good end.If my description of this film's plot seems incoherent, it is because the story's complexity and sinuousness make it difficult to recount. ""City of Ghosts"" was co-written and directed by actor Matt Dillon, who also plays the lead role in the film. Dillon's inexperience at both writing and directing show in this film. He has chosen an especially complex piece of material to direct. Plus, he has co-written it with Barry Gifford, which makes it difficult to see flaws in the writing and correct them in his on-screen interpretation. The film is littered with cliched characters: Down-and-out Westerners hanging on in Southeast Asia, one a cripple, one a burly bartender (Gerard Depardieu), and a couple of junkies. A humble and loyal local man, Sok (Kem Sereyvuth), who aids our protagonist and provides the moral to our story. Jimmy, a man who thinks that he cannot be redeemed but seems to really want to be anyway.  And there is a love interest (Natascha McElhone), whose sole purpose in the story is Jimmy's said redemption. ""City of Ghosts"" is heavy on atmosphere and convolution, but light on substance...usually. It has flashes of depth. The film's emotional climax is more of an anti-climax. That may actually be realistic, but it doesn't fare well on film.I'm giving this movie 4 stars because, in spite of its faults, it is very successful at certain things: The supporting performances of Stellan Skarsgard and James Caan are excellent. We see very little of ""Marvin"", but Caan embodies this man who has been driven by self-aggrandizement his whole life and who is perpetually one scam ahead of his many enemies. Caan only needs one scene to give us an understanding of Marvin's entire self-image. And I have to conclude that Stellan Skarsgard can play any character to perfection. ""Kaspar"" has a confused and confusing criminal disposition. He is desperate and unstable. He doesn't seem realistic. But Skarsgard lends him a palpable presence anyway. Jim Denault's cinematography is beautiful. Cambodia is picturesque, but I was most impressed and perplexed by Denault's masterful methods of  dealing with the apparent lack of good light in many of the film's scenes. The most striking feature of ""City of Ghosts"" is its ability to generate the near-constant uneasiness that one feels when submersed in a culture very different from one's own: The feeling of slight panic that comes with realizing that the basic assumptions and value systems that underlie your understanding of the universe at home may not apply here. This is, of course, intensified when things start to go wrong. I've never seen a film that conveyed this emotion so authentically and consistently.So I'm recommending ""City of Ghosts"" for its excellent supporting performances, its cinematography, and its ""uneasiness"". Producing discomfort turns out to be a good thing in this case. Narratively, the film is flawed. If you're looking for a good story, this probably isn't it. But if you're willing to pick out the gems from among the clich&eacute;s and misjudgments, I think ""City of Ghosts"" is worth the time. If Matt Dillon can retain the strengths of this film and learn from its faults, he has a future as a director.The DVD: Bonus features include a theatrical trailer and audio commentary by Matt Dillon and Barry Gifford, who is the film's co-writer. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish, and French. The audio commentary isn't bad, but the commentary I would have been most interested in in this case is the cinematographer's. It's unfortunate that he doesn't appear at all in the extras.",4,"Exotic, Atmospheric, and Sometimes Nihilistic Thriller",1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,4480,"['Jimmy', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'sold', 'disaster', 'insurance', 'New', 'York', 'federal', 'investigation', 'made', 'clear', 'company', 'was', 'engaging', 'fraud', 'selling', 'insurance', 'intention', 'paying', 'claims', 'Jimmy', 'where', 'boss', 'Marvin', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Cambodia', 'track', 'down', 'Marvin', 'James', 'Caan', 'laying', 'low', 'working', 'next', 'business', 'venture', 'trying', 'entice', 'powerful', 'corrupt', 'Cambodian', 'general', 'invest', 'resort', 'complex', 'business', 'associate', 'Marvin', 'Kaspar', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'trying', 'help', 'Jimmy', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'anxious', 'getting', 'share', 'loot', 'insurance', 'scam', 'situation', 'uneasy', 'harrowing', 'when', 'constant', 'scheming', 'backstabbing', 'Western', 'con', 'men', 'becomes', 'intertwined', 'lawlessness', 'post-war', 'Cambodia', 'look', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'good', 'end.If', 'description', 'film', 'plot', 'incoherent', 'story', 'complexity', 'sinuousness', 'make', 'difficult', 'recount', 'City', 'Ghosts', 'was', 'co-written', 'directed', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'who', 'also', 'lead', 'role', 'film', 'Dillon', 'inexperience', 'writing', 'directing', 'show', 'film', 'chosen', 'especially', 'complex', 'piece', 'material', 'direct', 'co-written', 'Barry', 'Gifford', 'difficult', 'see', 'flaws', 'writing', 'correct', 'on-screen', 'interpretation', 'film', 'littered', 'cliched', 'characters', 'Down-and-out', 'Westerners', 'hanging', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'one', 'cripple', 'one', 'burly', 'bartender', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'couple', 'junkies', 'humble', 'loyal', 'local', 'man', 'Sok', 'Kem', 'Sereyvuth', 'who', 'protagonist', 'moral', 'story', 'Jimmy', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'redeemed', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'anyway', 'love', 'interest', 'Natascha', 'McElhone', 'sole', 'purpose', 'story', 'Jimmy', 'said', 'redemption', 'City', 'Ghosts', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'convolution', 'light', 'substance', 'usually', 'flashes', 'depth', 'film', 'emotional', 'climax', 'more', 'anti-climax', 'may', 'actually', 'be', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'fare', 'well', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'because', 'spite', 'faults', 'very', 'successful', 'certain', 'things', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'James', 'Caan', 'are', 'excellent', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'Marvin', 'Caan', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'driven', 'self-aggrandizement', 'whole', 'life', 'who', 'perpetually', 'one', 'scam', 'ahead', 'many', 'enemies', 'Caan', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'give', 'understanding', 'Marvin', 'entire', 'self-image', 'have', 'conclude', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'can', 'play', 'character', 'perfection', 'Kaspar', 'confused', 'confusing', 'criminal', 'disposition', 'desperate', 'unstable', ""n't"", 'seem', 'realistic', 'Skarsgard', 'palpable', 'presence', 'anyway', 'Jim', 'Denault', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'Cambodia', 'picturesque', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'perplexed', 'Denault', 'masterful', 'methods', 'dealing', 'apparent', 'lack', 'good', 'light', 'many', 'film', 'scenes', 'most', 'striking', 'feature', 'City', 'Ghosts', 'ability', 'generate', 'near-constant', 'uneasiness', 'one', 'feels', 'when', 'submersed', 'culture', 'very', 'different', 'one', 'own', 'feeling', 'slight', 'panic', 'realizing', 'basic', 'assumptions', 'value', 'systems', 'underlie', 'understanding', 'universe', 'home', 'may', 'not', 'apply', 'here', 'course', 'intensified', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'conveyed', 'emotion', 'so', 'authentically', 'consistently.So', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'City', 'Ghosts', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'performances', 'cinematography', 'uneasiness', 'Producing', 'discomfort', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'case', 'Narratively', 'film', 'flawed', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'story', 'probably', ""n't"", ""'re"", 'willing', 'pick', 'out', 'gems', 'clich', 'eacute', 'misjudgments', 'think', 'City', 'Ghosts', 'time', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'can', 'retain', 'strengths', 'film', 'learn', 'faults', 'future', 'director.The', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'include', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Barry', 'Gifford', 'who', 'film', 'co-writer', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'audio', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'bad', 'commentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'interested', 'case', 'cinematographer', 'unfortunate', ""n't"", 'appear', 'extras']",N/A

These were popularfrom their under-priced competitiveness, sold by Matt Dillon.  Ofcourse, when a hurricane hits Florida, the Carolinas, and peoplesubmit claims for their losses, the owner disappears, leaving manyhome owners destitute, the company decapitalized as all $10 m ofpremiums were funnelled into the Cayman Isles and Swiss numbered bankaccounts, beyond the reach of regulators.Matt Dillon and James Caan, demonstrate extreme acting skill, andcredibility, with a subtle, meaningful presence throughout the 90mins. Natasha McElhone has a natural, shining presence playing anarcheologist.The cinematography is simply excellent, in all filming situations,night, day, action scenes and not, with a quasi-wide screen releasethat is sharp, clear and well edited.The soundtrack is also equally outstanding, with immense discernmentin the numbers selected, in the many tense moments.

As one of the characters in this monsoon thriller said, ""the whole country could use a coat of paint.""  Matt Dillon is the insurance executive caught up in a scandal that he needs to rectify, maybe, if he can locate the company chief executive, the mysterious and shifty Marvin.  On the way to rain forests, Dillon meets up with pretty Natacha McEthone, a member of group of antiquity restorers.  Then the usual seedy characters show up at the rancid hotel.  James Caan as Marvin and Gerard Deprardieu as the indo-chin innkeeper fill out the cast.  Then Dillon's passport is stolen and on and on for two hours we take a tour of the countryside, the natives, and the brothels.Dillon directed and co-wrote the script and I think that is a problem.  City of Ghosts is too long and the Dillon-McElhone romance is forced.  I mean if you're afraid for your life, are you going to take the time to ask a girl out on a date?  Hmmm, maybe not, so Dillon loved his directorial takes so much, he could not cut them, and some studio guy insisted on a love interest.

769158,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000AZKP8,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 3]","An uneasy, yet intriguing, brew of Joseph Conrad, Mario Puzo and Raymond Chandler, ""City of Ghosts"" is Matt Dillon's entrance into directing, and it fits him well, even if the movie flew far under the radar upon its release. Mossy with atmosphere, the story of three con men in Cambodia is overstuffed at two hours, yet the central theme of American crime vs. third world corruption - the attraction of the two to each other, and their eventual incompatibility - emerges fiercely in Dillon and Barry Gifford's co-written script.""City of Ghosts"" opens with an insurance scam. A hurricane belts the East Coast, and thousands of policyholders are left stranded by a phony company that sucked up their premiums and then laundered the money. At first it seems Jimmy (Dillon) was a fall guy hired by a shadow CEO: He presents a viable cover story to the FBI, which the feds buy.A day later he's headed to Southeast Asia to locate Marvin (James Caan), the CEO, who's working a new deal to build a casino in Cambodia, recently liberated after the reign of Pol Pot. Marvin's new partner, Casper (Stellan Skarsgard, Hollywood's resident shady fellow) is working his own angle with a few of Marvin's former marks.Although the table is set for a quick-n-dirty foreign thriller of double crosses and exoticism, Dillon spins the material against its natural bent and toward film noir. Upon Jimmy's arrival in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, Dillon is intent on getting us comfortable with the surroundings; some of it works - the brothel scene is oddly alluring - and some of it reeks of prestige padding. Gerard Depardieu has a large role as a crooked motel owner that's colorful but unrelated to the central story. Natascha McElhone is Jimmy's half-hearted love interest, an art scholar of Cambodia's ancient ruins. There is a local bike porter (Kem Sereyvuth), two petty thieves, an Oddjob hitman, three Russians, a monkey, two more art hippies and a retired general from the Pol Pot regime playing both sides of the casino development scheme.Caan, second billing behind Dillon, has a rather small role as the goofily detached Marvin, who seems less a criminal mastermind than a creep out the wild, playing head games. A sudden event midway through ""City of Ghosts"" accounts for the character's relative absence from the picture, but Dillon never finds the approach to paint Marvin as the Kurtz-like figure he'd so much like him to be; introducing Caan to the picture in long shot, dancing with girls, isn't exactly effective for Marvin's mystery.Yet there is enough to recommend. I like Skarsgard's performance - what suspense there is, he creates by just seeming worried - and Dillon, as usual, fits believably inside his character, in this case the tough-but-not-so-wiseguy. There is an authentic brutality to the picture - kidnappings, innocent victims, offhand violence - that Dillon has visited throughout his career as an actor. The crackerjack plot lacks a little snap, but an ominous languor fills the void. Lush, but mindful of the singe of murder still in the air.

Naegele,"[19, 21]","Having co-written the script and starred in the film, Matt Dillon was brilliant in his directorial debut with ""City of Ghosts,"" which was filmed principally in Thailand and Cambodia.  Surely, during the Academy Award-nominated actor's long and successful career, he will be recognized fully for his many talents.  The movie was beautifully filmed, and the editing is terrific; and there was fine acting as always by James Caan, Natascha McElhone, G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Stellan Skarsgrd--with wonderful supporting actors too, including Kem Sereyvuth (as ""Sok"") who had never acted before, but was a ""natural"" in Dillon's words.Unlike so many films that have been shot on foreign locations, this one really allows the viewer to feel and absorb the locales and their seedy underbellies.  Regrettably, after all of the work that went into this movie, its widest release in the States was 20 theaters, and its domestic gross was a mere $357,197.  Nonetheless, it has offered Dillon the opportunity to showcase his talents, and to work with world-class actors in the process of doing so--which is a tribute to his professionalism.  It is not every day that such talented ensemble cast members join in a risky undertaking like this, at least financially.Dillon has the potential to become a fine and established director in the future, just as actors Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson have done before him.  His camera angles, his cuts, and the palette that he lays before his audience are both creative and sumptuous, to say the least.  A wider audience should have seen ""City of Ghosts"" worldwide; however, DVDs and sources such as Amazon.com and Blockbuster Online allow this to happen today.  Dillon should be immensely proud of what he accomplished with this film--and that comes across in his very interesting, wonderful and informative commentary with respect to how the film was made, which is included in the ""Special Features"" section of the DVD.  Well worth listening to, and watching.And finally, James Caan's karaoke singing is a joy to watch.

769160,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0000AZKP8,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Matt Dillon's directorial debut is one of those films whose strengths are also its weaknesses. It's atmospheric with a fairly vivid sense of place - the parts of Cambodia that need a paint job, where Dillon's insurance fraudster has come to collect his cut of a Ponzi scheme that's just been blown away by a hurricane - and the human flotsam and jetsam that wind up there (many played by local residents rather than professional actors). At times the atmosphere is almost like a modern-day Joseph Conrad tale rather than the David Lynch films co-writer Barry Gifford is perhaps better known for. But this takes precedence over the plot, the concise plotting of the early scenes giving way to local colour and eccentrics as his boss, James Caan, and fellow conman Stellan Skarsgard, fall foul of some very bad people who also have Dillon in their sights. Despite starting out like one of those south of the border Robert Mitchum RKO thrillers of the 40s and 50s, there's a determinedly 70s indie vibe reminiscent more of Bogdanovich's Saint Jack rather than Cassevettes, albeit with a better budget, but while it constantly holds the interest it doesn't really grip. Instead the attraction is more like slumming it in a bad neighborhood with all sense of personal threat removed.Still, Gerard Depardieu is great fun as a bar/hotel owner playing Jacques Dutronc songs or trying to persuade his pet python to seek out and eat a pilfering monkey (""Here Olly-ver! Olly-ver! The monkee! Monkee!""), the relationship with Kem Sereyvuth's cyclo driver is nicely developed and refreshingly non-patronising, it's nice to see Bo Hopkins again even in a blink-and-you'll miss it cameo and it's probably your only chance to see Caan dancing in a sarong or drunkenly singing karaoke in Khmer.",3,Highly atmospheric but somewhat meandering,1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,1777,"['Matt', 'Dillon', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one', 'films', 'strengths', 'are', 'also', 'weaknesses', 'atmospheric', 'fairly', 'vivid', 'sense', 'place', 'parts', 'Cambodia', 'need', 'paint', 'job', 'where', 'Dillon', 'insurance', 'fraudster', 'come', 'collect', 'cut', 'Ponzi', 'scheme', 'just', 'been', 'blown', 'away', 'hurricane', 'human', 'flotsam', 'jetsam', 'there', 'many', 'played', 'local', 'residents', 'rather', 'professional', 'actors', 'times', 'atmosphere', 'almost', 'modern-day', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'tale', 'rather', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'co-writer', 'Barry', 'Gifford', 'perhaps', 'better', 'known', 'precedence', 'plot', 'concise', 'plotting', 'early', 'scenes', 'giving', 'way', 'local', 'colour', 'eccentrics', 'boss', 'James', 'Caan', 'fellow', 'conman', 'Stellan', 'Skarsgard', 'fall', 'foul', 'very', 'bad', 'people', 'who', 'also', 'have', 'Dillon', 'sights', 'starting', 'out', 'one', 'south', 'border', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'RKO', 'thrillers', '40s', '50s', 'determinedly', '70s', 'indie', 'vibe', 'reminiscent', 'more', 'Bogdanovich', 'Saint', 'Jack', 'rather', 'Cassevettes', 'better', 'budget', 'constantly', 'interest', ""n't"", 'really', 'grip', 'Instead', 'attraction', 'more', 'slumming', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'sense', 'personal', 'threat', 'removed.Still', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'great', 'fun', 'bar/hotel', 'owner', 'playing', 'Jacques', 'Dutronc', 'songs', 'trying', 'persuade', 'pet', 'python', 'seek', 'out', 'eat', 'pilfering', 'monkey', 'Here', 'Olly-ver', 'Olly-ver', 'monkee', 'Monkee', 'relationship', 'Kem', 'Sereyvuth', 'cyclo', 'driver', 'nicely', 'developed', 'refreshingly', 'non-patronising', 'nice', 'see', 'Bo', 'Hopkins', 'again', 'even', 'blink-and-you', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'cameo', 'probably', 'only', 'chance', 'see', 'Caan', 'dancing', 'sarong', 'drunkenly', 'singing', 'karaoke', 'Khmer']",N/A
