Legal and labor-laws and work-ethics could not possibly allow for the full realization of the book..not to mention the magic needed to get 4-8 yr olds to act like shakesperian poets just isnt gonna happen...better luck herding cats. It's amazing that Enders Game made it to the big screen at all..for that I'm grateful.Big screen movie lengths also are big hinderances, to do it true justice the movie would have likely needed to be twice as long, the target market would no way sit still for a 3-4 hour movie like their dads and uncles that discovered and loved the book back in the 1980's would love to (super-extended directors cut?). I was satisfied enough with what emerged. Not the sci-fi tour-de-force the book was. Average enough and I suppose a good movie experience with a smattering of moral/ethical lessons and human-insights intended for the youth audience in there.I'm admittedly somewhat disappointed with the ending as it seemed to not do well enough to set up and seed the importance of the character 'Bean', skims over the old traits and chaos the earth's nations were falling back into, it also radically re-jiggered Enders events where he located and secured the egg capsule of the formic queen and his finding a new home for its hatching..woefully abreviated and waaay too early in the 'Ender' storyline. Perhaps its an admission that the 'shadow' sequels are likely not going to happen or else have no active plans of production.To be honest I would never expect the following 'Ender' novels to be put on the big screen.. the 'Orson Card' style of story telling from one book to another in this series are huge jumps in both time, characters, mission, and location. As any that have read the series, Enders game bares little to no connection to the next 'Ender-book' ""Speaker for the Dead""..the disconnect would throw curveballs that simply will not survive translation to the 'everyman' movie goer.. One truly will have no connection to the other besides the names of the primary characters who at that point are far from being the young pre-pubescent children they were in book-1, no amount marketing and promotion campaign could bridge that gap for the average movie-goer. That said, perhaps it is to be read as an acknowledgement that there would likely be no sequels planned; this opportunity to get this one to the big screen was taken for what it was..and created as a mostly contained and complete story telling, introducing us to this world and characters while leaving no gaping holes to allow for future sequel speculation or ready expectation. A relatively tidy experience overall.Again..very glad it made it to the screen and did a decent enough job of not screwing the entire pooch as generally happens with book-to-movie adaptations..If another OSC book is ever under consideration for adaption to the big screen..any guesses on what I'd love to see?",3,Glad it made it to the big screen...,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,3074,"['usual', 'translation', 'couldnt', 'possibly', 'live', 'up', 'written', 'page..No', 'way', 'could', 'know', 'reading', 'book', 'young', 'tho', 'were', 'kids', 'were', 'still', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'Legal', 'labor-laws', 'work-ethics', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'allow', 'full', 'realization', 'book..not', 'mention', 'magic', 'needed', 'get', '4-8', 'yr', 'olds', 'act', 'shakesperian', 'poets', 'just', 'isnt', 'gon', 'happen', 'better', 'luck', 'herding', 'cats', 'amazing', 'Enders', 'Game', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'all..for', ""'m"", 'grateful.Big', 'screen', 'movie', 'lengths', 'also', 'are', 'big', 'hinderances', 'do', 'true', 'justice', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'needed', 'be', 'twice', 'long', 'target', 'market', 'would', 'way', 'sit', 'still', '3-4', 'hour', 'movie', 'dads', 'uncles', 'discovered', 'loved', 'book', 'back', '1980', 'would', 'love', 'super-extended', 'directors', 'cut', 'was', 'satisfied', 'enough', 'what', 'emerged', 'Not', 'sci-fi', 'tour-de-force', 'book', 'was', 'Average', 'enough', 'suppose', 'good', 'movie', 'experience', 'smattering', 'moral/ethical', 'lessons', 'human-insights', 'intended', 'youth', 'audience', 'there.I', ""'m"", 'admittedly', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'ending', 'seemed', 'not', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'set', 'up', 'seed', 'importance', 'character', 'old', 'traits', 'chaos', 'earth', 'nations', 'were', 'falling', 'back', 'also', 'radically', 're-jiggered', 'Enders', 'events', 'where', 'located', 'secured', 'egg', 'capsule', 'formic', 'queen', 'finding', 'new', 'home', 'hatching..woefully', 'abreviated', 'waaay', 'too', 'early', ""'Ender"", 'storyline', 'Perhaps', 'admission', ""'shadow"", 'sequels', 'are', 'likely', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'else', 'have', 'active', 'plans', 'production.To', 'be', 'honest', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'following', ""'Ender"", 'novels', 'be', 'put', 'big', 'screen..', ""'Orson"", 'Card', 'style', 'story', 'telling', 'one', 'book', 'series', 'are', 'huge', 'jumps', 'time', 'characters', 'mission', 'location', 'have', 'read', 'series', 'Enders', 'game', 'little', 'connection', 'next', ""'Ender-book"", 'Speaker', 'Dead', '..the', 'disconnect', 'would', 'throw', 'curveballs', 'simply', 'will', 'not', 'survive', 'translation', ""'everyman"", 'movie', 'goer..', 'One', 'truly', 'will', 'have', 'connection', 'other', 'names', 'primary', 'characters', 'who', 'point', 'are', 'far', 'being', 'young', 'pre-pubescent', 'children', 'were', 'book-1', 'amount', 'marketing', 'promotion', 'campaign', 'could', 'bridge', 'gap', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'said', 'perhaps', 'be', 'read', 'acknowledgement', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'sequels', 'planned', 'opportunity', 'get', 'one', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'taken', 'what', 'was..and', 'created', 'mostly', 'contained', 'complete', 'story', 'telling', 'introducing', 'world', 'characters', 'leaving', 'gaping', 'holes', 'allow', 'future', 'sequel', 'speculation', 'ready', 'expectation', 'relatively', 'tidy', 'experience', 'overall.Again..very', 'glad', 'made', 'screen', 'did', 'decent', 'enough', 'job', 'not', 'screwing', 'entire', 'pooch', 'generally', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptations..If', 'OSC', 'book', 'ever', 'consideration', 'adaption', 'big', 'screen..any', 'guesses', 'what', ""'d"", 'love', 'see']",N/A

Cheng ""livingoc""","[2, 3]","For those purchasing Ender's Game on Blu-Ray, here are the special features: Aside from the iTunes Digital Download and Ultraviolet Downloads; you get audio commentary from the director, Gavin Hood; an &#34;Inside the Mind Game&#34; featurette; a Behind the Scenes Making of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; called &#34;Ender's World,&#34; and deleted/extended scenes with optional audio commentary from Hood.Now on to my movie review: I read Ender's Game, 13 years ago as a freshman in high school. While the movie adaptation of Ender's Game condenses a lot of what happened in battle school, omits a lot of the politics that was happening on Earth, and glosses over the friendship between Ender and Bean, I was impressed with how the movie retained the essence of the book. Probably the most enjoyable part of the movie was seeing their interpretation of Battle School. Given how advanced technology is today, at least compared to 2001, the special effects were better than I imagined.In truth, I believe that the entire Ender's Universe would have been better served as a mini-series or a TV show, especially if it focused on the Ender's Shadow series as I think the general public would have related better with what was happening on EARTH than in Space. The film itself, wasn't very accommodating for a movie franchise or even a sequel, even though it did leave things &#34;open-ended&#34; enough.A huge round of applause should be given to the casting. The casting of Asa Butterfield as Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin, the titular 'hero,' is perfection. He played Ender's conflicting emotions, vulnerabilities and viciousness with a sincere conviction beyond someone his age should be able to portray. He truly is talented young man and I hope he continues acting because his future and career are bright. I was completely okay with them aging up all the characters, because let's be honest, it'd be difficult to find a believable precocious young actor to portray a 6 year old and then to a 12/13 year old commander.My favorite scenes involved him commanding his jeesh or confronting his enemies, including even Graff. Some of the best scenes in the movie was solely just Asa's Ender going head to head with Harrison Ford's Colonel Graff. Speaking of, Harrison Ford is perfect as Colonel Graff, I think if the movie had been a success and a potential sequel was in the making, he'd have the necessary gruff kindness to play Bean's confidante. And while the gender change in Anderson threw me for a second, I love Viola Davis, she's just a fantastic actress and her Anderson is a great reminder that these soldiers in Battle school are in fact kids, who have to return to &#34;normal&#34; life after the war. And another brilliant nugget of casting was Nonso Anozie as Sergeant Dap. I couldn't help shout out &#34;Game of Thrones!&#34; whenever he appeared on screen.I remember back in 2001, the book was always stuck in perpetual rumors of being in pre-production or casting, with names like Haley Joel Osment being thrown around as possible candidates to play Ender. 12 years later, I think the movie was made and released at the right time with the right cast, just the circumstances around the book being 28 years old and Orson Scott Card's personal statements, mired the movie's potential success. If it weren't for the boycotting, the movie could have done better, and maybe the marketing could have pushed a near 30 year old book better, but it's truly a pity most high schoolers aren't required to read this book anymore and most kids these days don&#8217;t know much about the series.Which was why it was also such a pity that Bean wasn't more significant in the movie adaptation. I had read that Orson Scott Card&#8217;s initial drafts to the movie adaptation of Ender&#8217;s Game were to have it centered more on Ender and Bean&#8217;s friendship. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. But the director preferred pushing Ender and Petra&#8217;s friendship, which is fine, but it killed any potential opportunity for a true Shadows sequel, which in my opinion would have made better movies. Plus, Bean gets Petra in the end. Has nine children with her and he is the love of her life.Part of the problem I had with the other books in Ender's series after Ender's Game is that Ender's story was interesting because not only of the war he ends, but the people IN the book he meets. The afore mentioned Bean and Petra, Alai, Dink, Shen, Graff, etc. These were all his friends and allies that don't appear in the sequels (aside from Ender in Exile - written AFTER Bean's Shadow sequels), so why would anyone care about them?The truth is, restoring the Formics' world is admirable of Ender, especially how Ender's guilt consumed him, but reading about it? Not as interesting. Learning about battle school and how Ender dealt with the pressures of the school, his actions in defending himself, and the war was interesting. But basing a franchise around his travels in space with the Formics, just isn't appealing.I think this is why Ender's Shadow would have made a better &#34;franchise&#34; starter. You start it with Ender's Game, introducing both Ender and Bean, blending both Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Then continue on to the beginning of Ender in Exile, then Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant, and then back to Ender in Exile and end it with Ender's travels in space.What's done is done. This is a great &#34;companion&#34; movie to go with the novel, Ender's Game. As a huge fan of the Ender Shadow's series and the book Ender's Game, I thought everybody did the best they could with the budget and time constraints. Again, I already mentioned that it's a pity they didn't go with Card's initial draft of the movie, but what's done is done. I only hope in the future sometime, the books will be made into a miniseries as the stories and characters themselves are certainly deserving.",5,"Great Cast, A Decent Book to Movie

1555589,AJOF6MLUKKLFZ,B008JFUNHI,Adam,"[1, 4]","Ender's Game had a lot working for it. There was mostly solid performances and some good special effects, with a decent plot.However, as someone who never read Ender's Game the book, I have to admit that the problem I had with the movie is that it felt like at the end of the film, I was watching an entirely different type of movie than I had for the first part..Through about the first 4/5ths of the movie, I was watching a film that seemed to combine two distinct types of films: a coming of age a story and a kick tail sci fi action film. The Coming of Age story was particularly marked as Ender progressed. He gained the respect of peers and even a sergeant who swore he would never salute Ender. He grew and became a leader as his true potential was brought to the fore.  While there were indications that the Graff was rushing to violence, Ender showed enough character, compassion, and decency that you felt he'd do the right thing once in command.***Spoilers***And then he commits genocide by blowing up the alien planet, after being tricked by the adults who were using actual ships in his last simulation. As a viewer, I felt like I'd suffered a bait and switch.  While there were some darker scenes, nothing really suggested that the whole alien threat was in the mind of the adults. Nothing suggested what would happen. Colonel Graff  looked like the tough and determined Coach/Authority figure pushing our young hero to greatness not the crazy paranoid guy who wanted to go to total war with aliens just in case.The 30 day countdown shown in one scene made even the most extreme behavior to prepare Ender seem okay because after all it was 30 days until the alien bug apocalypse. Apparently if you read the book, you'd know it was 30 days until we invaded the aliens, but again that's not how it looked to me.To be fair, it did seem the adults didn't actually plan on Ender blowing up the alien world. They were more like, &#34;Hmm. Okay, that works.&#34;The adaptation from the book is at times sloppy. For example, while we don't know the aliens language, we do know the name of the species. How? Also, why the heck did the aliens who wanted peace spend decades making no effort to make amends with Earth while thousands of Earth ships set themselves to invade, instead opting to contact the young boy who was to lead the forces against the planet and speaking to him in vague dream imagery. And why the heck did they promote a kid to Admiral, put him on a shuttle , and send him on his merry way?I've read some reviewers suggest that this should have been made into two movies to provide more detail and explanation, but if they told the story the same way, I would have been more annoyed to watch two movies that end with our hero being duped into genocide.Based on box office results, this is probably the only film we'll see in this series and it's quite a pathetic ending.

1555595,A17DE61L1M0IG1,B008JFUNHI,Alex418,"[0, 0]","Turning books into movies must be difficult. Change too much and you are at risk of angering the fans and change too little and the movie might not flow that well. Ender's Game leans somewhere towards the latter of that spectrum, but it still works fairly well as a film in its own right. Despite not liking some aspects of the book, the Battle School section is fantastic, so I had high hopes for this film. Luckily, I wasn't too disappointed.The movie does a good job of explaining the story quickly to newcomers without boring readers. Basically, aliens called Formics have attacked Earth twice, and the last time humanity almost lost except for Mazer Rackham's heroic (and mysterious) sacrifice. Now, the Formics are attacking again and the government is training children to take them down, with the war relying on training a particular boy named Ender Wiggin to be the leader.Ender's Game the book travels at a fairly quick pace; Ender's Game the movie speeds by even faster, which is both a good and bad thing. The pacing feels perfect in the last half-hour or so, but during the Battle School part (as I mentioned as my favorite part of the book) feels like it is missing some crucial scenes. When (mild spoilers) Ender gets control of his own army at the school, he says he will make them the best. And then all of the sudden we cut to just one battle and one battle only that results in Ender leaving to go to Command School. The book perfectly captured the feeling that Ender was rising to the top, but somehow the movie mostly misses this.Although I would have liked to have seen more, the Battle Room scenes are neat (basically zero-gravity laser tag) and the movie strengthens again near the end where a twist that will likely surprise those who haven't read the book is executed perfectly. The ending is thought-provoking and handled very well, perhaps even better than the book did it. All of the acting performances are great, with Asa Butterfield as Ender being a particularly strong choice. The music is also very impressive, and visually the film looks great.Outside of a few small but glaring problems with the film's pace and a few pieces feeling like they are missing, this film is what any fan could have hoped for from the book and stands on its own as a good science-fiction adventure.

1555617,ATS6RV3R26WAN,B008JFUNHI,Amazon Customer,"[19, 28]","Astonished by the story and the young star. This movie thrilled and fascinated me. I will be reading the book because the movie characterization of Ender (played by Asa Butterfield) shows an extraordinary person not easily, convincingly, found anywhere in cinema; a child's intelligence disciplined to the degree that we see a boy who truly blurs the line between child and adult. I figure it can only happen in a writer's mind and am grateful to the director for aiming so well at the writer's concept. Even if the question of age is not on target for some, the result raises eyebrows and makes age and maturity more of a mystery than I ever thought possible.Ender is obviously a child, but is gifted with a self-awareness that no child possesses. His military severity, coupled with great empathy and compassion, makes him much more than his age. But his innocent face begs the question, what is appropriate or inappropriate to have a child do, even at our country's most desperate hour? As if fighting and war are somehow more moral than any number of crimes against children. Of course, I value this movie for the way it uses fiction to make me think and not to get all wrapped up in serious issues. But I find it amazing that the boy-man concept could be brought to the screen so perfectly, so intelligently, in the performances of all involved.

At least they need to make ""Speaker for the Dead"" ; then we can see a better balanced rendition of what Orson Scott Card is trying to say to us.As with many movies there is not enough time to portray or even imply what the book tells us. Tee best we can hope for is a good reflection and not let the movie change the story for its own ends. This is one of those movies that tried in the time allotted to give you not only the feel but to put in as many details as possible.The choice of actors did a pretty good match to the characters. The graphics did not overwhelm the story. The background music did not washout the dialog. Unfortunately the version I watched did not have a voice over commentary to add to the experience. We view the story as a third party and never really get into anyone's mind.To many readers it will never be justified. To people that have not read the book it may be obscure. But at least they did not try to make a different story out of it. I am trying to restrain myself from comparing this film to classic sci-fi stories. To the movie's credit they did not dwell on the technology. The story here is about people and societies that just happen to take place in the future.Basic story is that it looks like we have been attacked a nearly annihilated. Our only recourse is to do unto others before they do it unto us. We do not know their intentions but take no chances. In the military we are always taught that no two wars are the same; we can train but must be flexible and initiative. The primes here are that children are more flexible and amendable to new environments.We are left with a moral question.

Characters routinely announce their motivations, the same bit of exposition is repeated no less than three times in the first 20 minutes of the movie (the repetition is a minor plot point later on, but it's a completely unnecessary one), and we get lingering shots of scenery without any real point while the rest of the movie feels like it's rushing to get through major plot points as fast as it can.  Harrison Ford looks and sounds tired, but I don't think that's a character choice.  The second half of the movie is much, much better than the first, but that's just because the first half is laughably bad.  And half of the good half is just a setup for the sequel they were surely hoping to make.I thought I'd be happy enough with this movie if they just had some cool scenes of space paintball like in the book.  Turns out there's not much of that here, and what is here sometimes abandons the &#34;Ender is a tactical genius&#34; aspect that is the core of the book for a more conventional &#34;Look at how well he can shoot with a gun in each hand!&#34; approach.

I don't actually care if they change the book, as long as the changes make a good movie.  I think some of the changes here would have worked better if they had gone further with them.  Ender's siblings, for instance, get such little screen time and characterization that the movie would have been better off cutting them completely; as it is, they're just a way to visualize a ham-handed theme.All in all, I only really enjoyed about 20 minutes of this movie.

A group of gifted young women and men are selected for an academy to lead the fight against an alien race.  They are very young and have to advance dramatically both mentally and physically.  This is about what it's like at that training camp and the story of one young man, Ender, who somehow pulls everything within him together.  Imagine just for a few minutes that we in the United States could do that with our educational and career systems.  After excelling by beating many, many other opponents and their squads at the training games, like mock warfare, he is sent off to a command kind of school and has to leave his family and all the friends he knows.  At command school he is pitted against other opponents who are hand selected along with their teams.  Finally he goes to what he thinks is the final stage of training, but it is not just training.  Here I won't spoil what happens, but i enjoyed the struggle within this young man and his fierce will along with his ability to attract a strong team around himself.  The aliens end up being much different than we think and Ender has a gift for mind-reading.  The special effects are outstanding.  The tension building up within him and in the story is striking.  There is a series of books following this first book in the series too.  You should read those too.  I didn't remember the ending of the movie from reading the first book.  Perhaps I missed something.  The movie is more hopeful than I had imagined by reading the reviews.  I don't know, but it seems like some of the reviewers did not watch the movie all the way through.  If you are a science fiction fan, don't miss this one.  It is very special.  I think perhaps what some people didn't like was that the story is driven so much by the promise and mental flexibility and learning capabilities of very young men and women.  I wonder, is that a message about our future?  Do we need to be much more open minded to really understand life and so that we are not so judgmental.  The movie left me with many deep questions.

It was very enjoyable to see these wonderful scenes come to life, and it's great that modern special effects have a reached the point where this is possible.There were a few aspects that could have been improved. The Battle School training sequences were good but lacked the thrill that the book evoked. Ender's relationships with his siblings was underdeveloped in the film.

My brother hasn't seen it because some people say it's worth it and some people say it is way off the mark. Well, I saw it because my brother introduced me to the books right when this movie came into theaters. I didn't have quite the attachment that my brother does, but I was very obsessed (to the point where I reread the book while waiting for Speaker For The Dead to arrive from the library rather than start another book and have since December of '13 purchased nearly all the books within the Enderverse) with the story told by Orson Scott Card.I found that the movie cut corners from the story. This is to be expected considering much of the drama of the book stems from things that are moralistic and difficult to portray visually. To me, the movie seemed to be flying at a million miles an hour, but this too is to be expected. It took me several nights to get the same story, albeit a more detailed story, read while the movie took almost two hours to shrink as much of the story down to it's most constituent parts so that the essence of the story was still there. It certainly helped to use many lines or portions of dialogues directly from the book itself. I don't know if this book to movie line transfer is common, as this is the first book I've read that made it onscreen, but for me, a lover of the book, this really connected the two mediums.There are some liberties with the story too. Ender seems to be about 12 - 15 throughout the whole movie, so his fight with Stillson occurred not when he was six, nor did Graff collect him when he was six. Probably depicting such young kids in a militaristic setting would have been upsetting for many parents. Also, the Battle School timeline was shortened, despite that being a significant amount of the content of the original story. So those are some of the main differences (there are a few more but I don't want to give too many spoilers) that I noticed between the book and the movie.The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they tattooed Mazer Rackham's face in the movie, saying that he is Maori. I don't recall that from the book at all, and see no point to having Ben Kingsly paint his face as such. But Orson Scott Card was credited as a producer and so was his &#34;Ender Buddy&#34; Aaron Johnston so maybe they know something we don't, or maybe YOU all know something that I don't.

1555673,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008JFUNHI,Brian Driver,"[3, 7]",".[FOR THOSE WHO WANT A SIMPLIFIED REVIEW, JUST ZIP TO THE FINAL FOUR PARAGRAPHS. THERE ARE NO SPOILERS.]Just about anybody who has read Ender's Game knows what to expect when it comes to this movie, and it is my guess that these are the people who comprise the majority of the audience. In other words, the screenwriter (and director) Gavin Hood's decision to let us in early on a key element of the surprise ending is probably a wise one; it is now only Ender himself, and his youthful comrades, who remain in the dark. Though a good deal of the book's shocking ending depended on this factor, the film, pointedly, does not. (NOTE: Even author Orson Scott Card himself--who tried to write several unsuccessful screenplays for this movie himself--conceded its seeming impossibility in this regard).Now, as to whether ENDER'S GAME does service to the novel, that's a question I suppose only the box office will ultimately reveal. For me, I found the movie to be a lavish but watered down adaptation. True, making movies out of books is usually a process prone to reduction, but I felt the movie lacked so much that it affected my appreciation of it as the character-driven story that the novel depicted so well.  And Ender's development as a character is key to the success of the movie.Not to reveal anything--which I won't--but ENDER'S GAME the novel is a story told through several narratives, much like another great young adult novel calledI AM THE CHEESE, by Robert Cormier. The narrative threads help us understand the fabric of characterization and plot that one single narration could not have achieved. ENDER'S GAME the novel was spectacularly successful at this--so much so that the novel has sold millions of copies, has been translated into over 30 languages, has won the Hugo and the Nebula, and on and on. (It's unfortunate that it has been tarred by the furor caused by author Orson Scott Card's negative views on homosexuality, particularly dealing with same-sex marriage, but that--and WORSE offenses--he engineered himself.)But it is ENDER'S GAME the movie that is the subject here, and whether IT works or not. While it has all the trimmings of high-caliber acting, extraordinary special effects, and certainly a compelling plot, it came up short at affecting the grand story told by the novel. Where the novel succeeded--and so well, in fact, that it is suggested reading in U.S. Marine Corps training school--is in the details of Ender's training, and in particular in his ingenious response to the dilemmas dealt him by his battle school commanders.And as anyone familiar with the book will tell you, it's in this regard thatENDER'S GAMEthe novel is so compelling. Ender's ability to think his way out of difficult situations makes for fascinating reading, and Card deserves credit for the brilliant strategies he invoked. The complex conflicts he faced were not just military ones--for instance, he was not only repeatedly bullied by his jealous fellow students, but he also used his growing success as a tool to force concessions from his trainers--they were understandable and progressive, and the novel reported his steady coming to terms with his hostile environs in a step-by-step manner.You see, the world is facing its second set of attacks by a culture it barely defeated the first time around, and there's no denying that this time it is likely to face overwhelming destruction. Ender is one of the latest round of cadets being rushed through training school in a desperate attempt to find someone, ANYONE who can think like their enemy, and use that empathy to defeat them. The older tacticians have been too set in their ways to accomplish such a task--the secret, they know, lies in the young, and Ender is the best of the lot. In fact, he's the best anyone has EVER seen.Yet in the movie this prowess is displayed so briefly that it's no more than a highlight reel...it's like watching a three-hour football game in a hour. I really felt the movie's brevity in the scenes concerning the computer program designed to bring out his inner demons, and again in the revealing progression of games played within the weightless Battle Dome. It was there his genius really revealed itself, and his spectacular outside-the-box strategies came across so well.While the acting was of a high caliber--particularly that of Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley as a major interested in Ender's psychology and a singular hero of the last war, respectively--and the special effects were grand, I felt let down by the short shrift the movie gave Ender's tactical growth.  Again, this is no small factor--it is, in fact, what makes the book so magnificent. And it just wasn't really there for me.So, while I feel that the movie made good entertainment, I do not believe it was a compelling movie for the same reasons as its source material. As such, I only give it a three...maybe higher if you have not read the book and are only there to see razzle and dazzle. In that case, you're on your own.",3,"Lots of Glamor, But Lacks What Makes the Novel So Great",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,5006,"['[', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'WANT', 'A', 'SIMPLIFIED', 'REVIEW', 'JUST',

an Insectoid species going after the &#34;queen&#34; bug.Harrison Ford playes a &#34;drill sargeant&#34; type to find his next leader because the last &#34;millitary kickbutt leader&#34;(Ben Kingsley) was thought to be killed in the last big battle to defeat the bugs.It turns out he wasn't killed but went into hiding on a distant location,maybe I'm wrong about the details but you get the concept.The kid goes through &#34;cosmic boot camp&#34; and defeats his opponents in a series of trails and winds up in charge of the military forces,and what he thinks is his final trial which is a video game defeats the bugs and gets the queen to save everyone.Actually it is reality and he really does kill the enemy(and a lot of his troops)to gain victory,the command has fooled him into doing the job and he freaks out.Everything works out in the end even though he feals used in the process!He gets the bugs and the pretty girl in the end and becomes the next&#34;millitary kickbutt leader&#34;.From what I read in a movie description this was a book from 1977 and I guess finally CGI got advanced enough to do this type of movie.I don't mean to be prejudgiced toward &#34;gamers&#34; but the treand toward &#34;action through CGI sequences&#34; has become so often because of cheaper production costs in hollywood I miss real acting!Maybe CGI has got to be so good that there is no need for actual acting?Anyway this is aimed toward gamers,its actually a pretty good movie!This reminds me of &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; in a way,and in that movie it was the &#34;brain bug&#34; that was the thing to get!They plug in a couple of good old actors to make it more respectable and draw in old farts like me!!haha!!check it out,its a good way to kill a couple of hours!!Hey look at last years big space drama &#34;Gravity&#34;,it was almost all CGI and made a ton of money(no acting awards)but a lot of technical awards and etc.Maybe someday there will all CGI movies and no need for actual actors anymore,like Jim Cameron said in jest on the set of &#34;avatar&#34; a few years ago(that movie made a billion),it would sure be a lot cheaper then paying a bunch of high price actors,haha!!just kidding!!who knows what the future will be?The Oscars seem to still favor an actual acting movie!I suppose Sci-Fi will be in this CGI trend?From Star Wars on this is the way its going,watch and enjoy!!This movie is worth 3 maybe 3 1/2 stars at best!",3,A good movie for game addicted people....I didn't read the book!!,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3013,"['was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'probably', 'steered', 'younger', 'people', 'are', 'game', 'addicted', 'like', 'annimation.Sorry', 'sound', 'old', 'here', 'draw', 'here', 'was', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'being', 'were', 'important', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Ghandi', 'Ghandi', 'being', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'others', 'era.The', 'concept', 'here', 'brainiac', 'kid', 'plucked', 'class', 'having', 'razor', 'sharp', 'leadership', 'skills', 'solutions', 'problems', 'advanced', 'defeat', 'latest', 'threat', 'colonies', 'Earth', '34', 'Buggers', '34', 'Insectoid', 'species', 'going', '34', 'queen', '34', 'bug.Harrison', 'Ford', '34', 'drill', 'sargeant', '34', 'type', 'find', 'next', 'leader', 'last', '34', 'millitary', 'kickbutt', 'leader', '34', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'killed', 'last', 'big', 'battle', 'defeat', 'bugs.It', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'went', 'hiding', 'distant', 'location', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'details', 'get', 'concept.The', 'kid', '34', 'cosmic', 'boot', 'camp', '34', 'defeats', 'opponents', 'series', 'trails', 'up', 'charge', 'military', 'forces', 'what', 'final', 'trial', 'video', 'game', 'bugs', 'queen', 'save', 'everyone.Actually', 'reality', 'really', 'kill', 'enemy', 'lot', 'troops', 'gain', 'victory', 'command', 'fooled', 'doing', 'job', 'out.Everything', 'works', 'out', 'end', 'even', 'used', 'process', 'bugs', 'pretty', 'girl', 'end', 'next', '34', 'millitary', 'kickbutt', 'leader', '34', 'what', 'read', 'movie', 'description', 'was', 'book', '1977', 'guess', 'finally', 'CGI', 'got', 'advanced', 'enough', 'do', 'type', 'movie.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'prejudgiced', '34', 'gamers', '34', 'treand', '34', 'action', 'CGI', 'sequences', '34', 'become', 'so', 'often', 'cheaper', 'production', 'costs', 'hollywood', 'miss', 'real', 'acting', 'Maybe', 'CGI', 'got', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'need', 'actual', 'acting', 'Anyway', 'aimed', 'gamers', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', '34', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '34', 'way', 'movie', 'was', '34', 'brain', 'bug', '34', 'was', 'thing', 'get', 'plug', 'couple', 'good', 'old', 'actors', 'make', 'more', 'respectable', 'draw', 'old', 'farts', 'haha', 'check', 'out', 'good', 'way', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'Hey', 'look', 'last', 'years', 'big', 'space', 'drama', '34', 'Gravity', '34', 'was', 'almost', 'CGI', 'made', 'ton', 'money', 'acting', 'awards', 'lot', 'technical', 'awards', 'etc.Maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'CGI', 'movies', 'need', 'actual', 'actors', 'anymore', 'Jim', 'Cameron', 'said', 'jest', 'set', '34', 'avatar', '34', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'made', 'billion', 'would', 'sure', 'be', 'lot', 'cheaper', 'then', 'paying', 'bunch', 'high', 'price', 'actors', 'haha', 'just', 'kidding', 'who', 'what', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'Oscars', 'seem', 'still', 'favor', 'actual', 'acting', 'movie', 'suppose', 'Sci-Fi', 'will', 'be', 'CGI', 'trend', 'Star', 'Wars', 'way', 'going', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'worth', '3', 'maybe', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'best']",N/A

As each student in our clique of slightly gothic and artistic individuals finished novels in the series, we passed them on to the next person. So, I eagerly awaited the release of this film after seeing the trailer during my last trip to the theater.The story about a young prodigy, chosen as a sole commander of the earth's battle forces, is presented in much a similar fashion as in the novel. Asa Butterfield is Ender, the protagonist, who trains to lead the earth forces. Harrison Ford is his, sometimes, none-too-gentle superior who steers him in this endeavor as General Graff. I feel that in the novel, Ender is a much stronger character than the one portrayed in this film version. However, I've come to like the slightly more subtle Ender that might contribute less to deluded feelings of grandeur or overestimating one's ability to succeed in real life. Admittedly, after watching two hours of Ender's Game, I came out of the theater feeling like I could stop traffic with my eyes closed while waving popcorn from the machine, whimsically, through the air, across the lobby, out through the door, and into my mouth.

It is a science-fiction action film with an uncharacteristic premise. It is uncharacteristic in the sense that as a science-fiction action film, it is less eventful and more thoughtful. Andrew &#8220;Ender&#8221; Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is an extremely gifted kid with the mentality for success in battle. He is closely watched by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and quickly moved up the ranks of a futuristic military academy.An alien species called the 'formics' or in the book, 'the buggers', are threatening earth's existence and desperate moves are needed to be made. &#8220;Ender's Game&#8221; does have elements that are similar to two films in my opinion, but seeing as though the book came out in 1985, those films appear to be inspired by the book. Those movies are &#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221; (1987) and &#8220;Starship Troopers&#8221; (1997). The film focuses on the training of military recruits preparing for war against bugs and it makes a broad statement about war and its effect on the human condition.This is easily the best thing that Harrison Ford has done in years and his performance is only bolstered by the performance of sort of unknown Asa Butterfield. Butterfield encompasses everything needed to portray a complex and challenging role. Maybe his previous performance in a rare gem like &#8220;The Boy in the Striped Pajamas&#8221; prepared him for such an emotional and deep character. Much is placed upon the shoulders of the teenager Ender Wiggin and Butterfield was flawless at bringing you into an inner-turmoil that many times can only be described in a book.I wondered why &#8220;Ender's Game&#8221; was not a summer blockbuster release because the effects are well done and the movie looked like a blockbuster type thing, but now that I've viewed it, I understand its release completely. This isn't a blockbuster release type film. This is a thoughtful film, more suitable for Oscar season and a more thoughtful movie-goer. The movie challenges you to question things and rethink things, just as its lead character does, separating him from others.The ending of the film seem to be rushed and thrown together; most undoubtedly to prepare this film for a possible franchise of films, but that would be the only thing that I disliked about it. Not that the ending was bad, but in a film that was already near 2-hours, what happened in its final minutes, to be done properly would have required at least another 20 or 30 minutes that the creator decided to forgo.

1555710,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B008JFUNHI,Christopher Schwinger,"[4, 10]","I'm not well-versed in sci fi ""lore"", but after I read what Harrison Ford said about the themes of military ethics this movie addresses, I wanted to see it.  I'm glad I did.  Thankfully, the pace moves quickly and doesn't dwell on moods and emotions or weird aspects of the sci fi technology.  Asa Butterfield is very good as the young actor who plays Ender, the boy/early teen prodigy who is being trained to lead an invasion against a former enemy.  The enemy is a race of aliens who had fought against earth about 50 years before.  Ender has to confront the ""establishment's"" modus operandi:  Is it right to attack a group that has been minding its own business because there had been a previous war and you don't want a future attack from them?  This is very relevant to America's foreign policy.  While I believe preemptive war is sometimes necessary when the designs of the enemy are very clear--think of how much better off Europe would have been if Britain had intervened just one year earlier against Hitler, whose intent was unmistakable and who was doing a massive military buildup--there is no justification for war against former enemies that no longer have aggressive intent, or who just want to have access to resources in their surroundings.  I would hope people would see that this is very relevant to Israel's attitude toward the Palestinians, most of whom are peaceful, and that there is a difference between xenophobia (hostility to foreigners, racial apartheid) and being wisely involved in preventing terrorist attacks.  Another thing that struck me thematically was the manipulation of Ender's mind through virtual reality/simulated reality.  When I experienced what I consider the golden age of computer games, in the 90s, they were engaging, but in subsequent years, they have gotten much more realistic and overblown in their effect on the mind.  I am deeply concerned about the psychological effect they have on people, desensitizing them to real-life catastrophes, and whether intentionally or not, this theme is explored in Ender's Game as young Ender plays a game on his electronic device to develop his tactical thinking skills.The other thing that hit me thematically was the exploitation of children.  I felt I was witnessing the corruption of youth as the story of Ender and his classmates developed.  Adolf Hitler was the first leader to so successfully take control over every child's mind, because he had more powerful media than ever before in history.  His Germany was very well connected technologically, better than the extensive Soviet Union.  That made for a very hierarchical, very well controlled training program for the entire society.  Like the Nazis, the military training school in Ender's Game incessantly pushes the children to be merciless and focused only on their mission.  This develops camaraderie for them, but also a coldness toward anyone outside their race.  They also have intense power play against their peers and are forbidden to communicate with their families back on earth.  Hitler Youth and League of German Girls camping events, and the Nuremberg rallies, were how the Nazis brainwashed children.  They isolated them from every other influence, and made them see themselves as no more than pawns for the larger agenda.  Harrison Ford's character, who is not exactly a villain but no hero, either, has boxed himself into an unethical outlook on warfare, and is convinced that children are born to further the collective interest, like Hitler and the other Nazi leaders.  Hitler himself didn't think his agenda was all about him, but about serving his cause of racial purity, a perverted and deeply hateful form of nationalism.  Yet even though the western world is less nationalistic since WWII, this kind of thinking is still dangerously alive, including in America.  Many are convinced that the ends justify the means, and that if the goal is worthy, you don't have to follow constitutional procedures.  That applies to all kinds of government takeovers and surveillance programs.As I have just described, I see many themes that are valuable in this movie.  Also, the special effects blew me away.

1555714,ACJVGDN8G386P,B008JFUNHI,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[5, 7]","Despite any misgivings concerning Orson Scott Card's personal beliefs about controversial subjects, his novel &#34;Ender's Game&#34; (TOR, 1985) often shows up in the top 2 or 3 titles of the most loved books among Science Fiction readers. The original novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Novel, not an easy feat since few have won both awards for the same book. (&#34;Dune&#34; by Frank Herbert, &#34;The Left-Hand of Darkness&#34; by Ursula K. Le Guin, and &#34;Doomsday Book&#34; by Connie Willis are a few examples which are double winners.) After many starts and stops over a 20+ year period, &#34;Ender's Game&#34; has finally graced the big screen. And it has been worth the long wait.The screen adaptation of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is one of the best among classic science fiction novels. (By contrast, the original &#34;Dune&#34; film directed by David Lynch was an atrocious screen version of Herbert's famous novel.) Where &#34;Ender's Game&#34; succeeds (and the original &#34;Dune&#34; film didn't) was because the former understood the sensibility of the story. While on the surface, the plot seems simple: a young cadet is in training at a kind of military space school. At the same time, the story is much deeper than merely a bunch of kids playing shoot 'em up in a weightless battlefield. Underlying the setting of a training school for pre-teen space soldiers (written over 10 years before Harry Potter) is the idea of how a youth becomes a leader among his/her peers. Is leadership in-born, or is it taught? Or does it come from facing adversity in which the person must find within him or herself the ability to be self-reliant?The administrators of the space school don't believe that leaders are born, but rather can be forged, like a sword. And Earth needs someone forged for the task to stop the alien meanies who threatened to conquer earth. In the last battle, the meanies were stopped by a hero who had the guts and cleverness to use every resource available to ensure victory. To replicate their former hero, they contrive to offer one of their best students a series of experiences which will instill the idea that he is a leader. And that student is Ender Wiggin. The administrators in charge of his experiences are Harrison Ford and Viola Davis who put Ender through a ringer of impossible situations that would be nearly unbearable to almost everyone else. The story is not only about how Ender deals with these experiences at the training school but also how he grows into something a bit different than what the administrators had planned. And after having graduated to different levels of the training school, he meets someone he thought so much larger than life that he can't believe he has met him face-to-face.A beautiful and moving adaption of one of the great science fiction classics. The cast is first rate all-around with exceptional performances by the kids, particularly Hailee Steinfeld as Petra and the highest marks for Asa Butterfield as Ender. The special effects are fantastic, which is to be expected, but they support the story rather than overwhelm it, which seems to be the trend these days for most science fiction offerings. This is one of the few science fiction films that is simultaneously dazzling and moving. A rare find in the annals of SF filmmaking. And as stated by others involved with this film, the message of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; has absolutely nothing to do with the author's opinions on other subjects.",4,Harry Potter Meets Star Wars: Excellent Adaption of One of the Classics of Science Fiction,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,3492,"['misgivings', 'concerning', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'personal', 'beliefs', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'novel', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'TOR', '1985', 'often', 'up', 'top', '2', '3', 'titles', 'most', 'loved', 'books', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'readers', 'original', 'novel', 'won', 'Hugo', 'Nebula', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Novel', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'few', 'have', 'won', 'awards', 'same', 'book', '34', 'Dune', '34', 'Frank', 'Herbert', '34', 'Left-Hand', 'Darkness', '34', 'Ursula', 'K.', 'Le', 'Guin', '34', 'Doomsday', 'Book', '34', 'Connie', 'Willis', 'are', 'few', 'examples', 'are', 'double', 'winners', 'many', 'starts', '20+', 'year', 'period', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'finally', 'graced', 'big', 'screen', 'been', 'long', 'wait.The', 'screen', 'adaptation', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'one', 'best', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'contrast', 'original', '34', 'Dune', '34', 'film', 'directed', 'David', 'Lynch', 'was', 'atrocious', 'screen', 'version', 'Herbert', 'famous', 'novel', 'Where', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'original', '34', 'Dune', '34', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'former', 'understood', 'sensibility', 'story', 'surface', 'plot', 'simple', 'young', 'cadet', 'training', 'kind', 'military', 'space', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'story', 'much', 'deeper', 'merely', 'bunch', 'kids', 'playing', 'shoot', 'up', 'weightless', 'battlefield', 'Underlying', 'setting', 'training', 'school', 'pre-teen', 'space', 'soldiers', 'written', '10', 'years', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'idea', 'how', 'youth', 'leader', 'his/her', 'peers', 'leadership', 'in-born', 'taught', 'come', 'facing', 'adversity', 'person', 'must', 'find', 'ability', 'be', 'self-reliant', 'administrators', 'space', 'school', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'leaders', 'are', 'born', 'rather', 'can', 'be', 'forged', 'sword', 'Earth', 'someone', 'forged', 'task', 'stop', 'alien', 'meanies', 'who', 'threatened', 'conquer', 'earth', 'last', 'battle', 'meanies', 'were', 'stopped', 'hero', 'who', 'had', 'guts', 'cleverness', 'use', 'resource', 'available', 'ensure', 'victory', 'replicate', 'former', 'hero', 'contrive', 'offer', 'one', 'best', 'students', 'series', 'experiences', 'will', 'instill', 'idea', 'leader', 'student', 'Ender', 'Wiggin', 'administrators', 'charge', 'experiences', 'are', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'who', 'put', 'Ender', 'ringer', 'impossible', 'situations', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'unbearable', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'Ender', 'deals', 'experiences', 'training', 'school', 'also', 'how', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'what', 'administrators', 'had', 'planned', 'having', 'graduated', 'different', 'levels', 'training', 'school', 'someone', 'thought', 'so', 'much', 'larger', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'met', 'face-to-face.A', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'adaption', 'one', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'classics', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'all-around', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'kids', 'particularly', 'Hailee', 'Steinfeld', 'Petra', 'highest', 'marks', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Ender', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fantastic', 'be', 'expected', 'support', 'story', 'rather', 'overwhelm', 'be', 'trend', 'days', 'most', 'science', 'fiction', 'offerings', 'one', 'few', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'simultaneously', 'dazzling', 'moving', 'rare', 'find', 'annals', 'SF', 'filmmaking', 'stated', 'others', 'involved', 'film', 'message', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'author', 'opinions', 'other', 'subjects']",N/A

The lessons learned they showed did not have the desired response.Aside from not hitting the books very well, it was predictable, and not from my knowing the book standpoint, it was Hollywood predictable.  Not to mention within that scope a very weak finish.  Maybe the books and the recentness of them will help drive this for future, but box office losses in the millions do not make investors happy.  This movie had much more advertisement than recent box office Sci Fi flops such as Serenity, and Serenity was a much better movie based on the critics and fans who did see it.It's too bad, other movies like John Carter, had it preceded Avatar, had a better cast, and been named The Princess of Mars like the books, it might not have lost a ton at the box office.

Fast track to many years later and my second reading and I felt that it was much less mature then my first read. Now to the movie, the attempt to be faithful to the book was excellent. It was not much of a problem to leave out certain sections that provided for the important description of the myriad pieces that helped one to understand the war and the novel process in selecting children to train with a brutal schedule that put boot camp to shame. Still, it was written for a younger population, younger then YA which in many cases is better written then adult level books. The ability to show the zero G training from the book was very difficult to transpose to the screen. Still, the cinema was artfully done and made the more juvenile story of interest to adult audience. I am always intrigued by the thinking and use of &#34;out of the box&#34; concepts.

1555733,A2LCE1D0TW2XY0,B008JFUNHI,D. Alexander,"[60, 78]","I'm not sure what I was expecting from this. I suppose I was hoping for Lord of the Rings: a sense of scale, emotional resonance, and characters so compellingly-realized that they replace the ones you mentally create when you read the book.Well, that's not this movie. It feels like a bullet point summary. There's no time to flesh anything out, so things just happen, point by point, with little glue or depth. Relationships and character motivations are so condensed that the emotional impact of many events just leeches away. Worth watching? Sure. It's not a bad spectacle and the plot is coherent enough. But comparisons to the source only highlight what it could have been.The outline hasn't changed. Ender's Game is set well in the future after an attack on Earth by an alien race. The military sends genius children (teenagers onscreen) with leadership potential to a 'battle school' in space to prove themselves against their peers. Some will eventually command a counterstrike. Ender is the most gifted and intelligent of the children, a 'chosen one' by adults under severe time pressure. How he adapts and how the others come to follow him comprise the majority of the book. The movie opts to excise much of this progression and a number of secondary characters. An open-ended epilogue leaves room for sequels.Ender himself is probably the biggest loss in the translation. He's intended as a tragic character. The crux of the book is that a person with the empathy to understand how to destroy this civilization would be too empathetic to do it, if he knew that he was. But he understands on some level, and as the pressure builds on him, so it does on the reader.That's amplified by the intense solitude Card imposes. In this movie, Ender is just another kid: fast friends with the others after minor goading. Not so in the book: he's small in stature and has only a moment to befriend Alai before he's accelerated away. The older children feel and prey on his sensitivity until his achievements transform him into an 'other,' a unicorn set apart by ability. And his superiors are never friendly. They think he has to believe that he's the only one capable of winning, and that no one will ever help him, or he won't see it through to the end. The fate of the world is literally in his hands and the weight of it nearly kills him.We don't get that sense of bleakness because it wasn't written into the script except at the final reveal (and as a result, Ender's response comes across as a tantrum rather than a moment of existential despair). It's a sort of generic teen-savior screenplay. That causes other problems. The challenge of adapting Ender's Game was always suspension of disbelief: how do you write child parts to make them seem deserving of adult responsibility? There's no disconnect on the written page because you're in Ender's head. You can see just how calculating and deductive he is. But very little of that is recreated. He acts like a normal, slightly precocious teenager, among other normal teenagers. In consequence, Harrison Ford's intense belief in Ender, prophetic in writing, seems a bit delusional here. If you can't accept the premise of child generals, it's difficult to appreciate the rest.What's left? To start, a capable lead. Asa Butterfield meshes well with the role, except insofar as the oddity of seeing a 5'1 adversary bully someone nine inches taller and twenty pounds heavier. He's actually better than Ford, who alternates between one-note gruff and hero worship. Viola Davis is underused. All the secondary characters could have been anyone. None except Petra have any meat to their roles. Ben Kingsley's Mazer Rackham remains a mysterious specter, perhaps the most interesting individual in the movie. One wonders if this couldn't have been a trilogy with the first third focusing on his exploits.And we've got some action with two major set pieces: a training 'battle room' much larger than what I'd envisioned, and an alien planet. Ender's initial experiences with the battle room in zero-G were the most engaging parts for me. It's one of the few sections where the movie slows to take a breath. As he experiences this new thing, so do you. That's pretty cool. By counterpoint, his later adventures commanding his proteges in a simulator were exciting enough, but terribly rushed and anticlimactic. The sense of scale is actually less than in the training scenes.On balance, Ender's Game is a decent film, but memorable to me more for the pain of what might have been rather than as a sympathetic reaction to the main character. I'd wait until it hits the discount racks. If you're viewing it with fresh eyes, you may have a better experience.",3,Like having an ice-cream sundae in one bite,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,4701,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'suppose', 'was', 'hoping', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'sense', 'scale', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'characters', 'so', 'compellingly-realized', 'replace', 'ones', 'mentally', 'create', 'when', 'read', 'book.Well', 'not', 'movie', 'bullet', 'point', 'summary', 'time', 'flesh', 'anything', 'out', 'so', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'point', 'point', 'little', 'glue', 'depth', 'Relationships', 'character', 'motivations', 'are', 'so', 'condensed', 'emotional', 'impact', 'many', 'events', 'just', 'away', 'Worth', 'watching', 'Sure', 'not', 'bad', 'spectacle', 'plot', 'coherent', 'enough', 'comparisons', 'source', 'only', 'highlight', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been.The', 'outline', ""n't"", 'changed', 'Ender', 'Game', 'set', 'well', 'future', 'attack', 'Earth', 'alien', 'race', 'military', 'sends', 'genius', 'children', 'teenagers', 'onscreen', 'leadership', 'potential', ""'battle"", 'school', 'space', 'prove', 'peers', 'will', 'eventually', 'command', 'counterstrike', 'Ender', 'most', 'gifted', 'intelligent', 'children', ""'chosen"", 'one', 'adults', 'severe', 'time', 'pressure', 'How', 'how', 'others', 'come', 'follow', 'comprise', 'majority', 'book', 'movie', 'excise', 'much', 'progression', 'number', 'secondary', 'characters', 'open-ended', 'epilogue', 'room', 'sequels.Ender', 'probably', 'biggest', 'loss', 'translation', 'intended', 'tragic', 'character', 'crux', 'book', 'person', 'empathy', 'understand', 'how', 'destroy', 'civilization', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'empathetic', 'do', 'knew', 'was', 'level', 'pressure', 'reader.That', 'amplified', 'intense', 'solitude', 'Card', 'movie', 'Ender', 'just', 'kid', 'fast', 'friends', 'others', 'minor', 'goading', 'Not', 'so', 'book', 'small', 'stature', 'only', 'moment', 'befriend', 'Alai', 'accelerated', 'away', 'older', 'children', 'feel', 'prey', 'sensitivity', 'achievements', 'transform', ""'other"", 'unicorn', 'set', 'apart', 'ability', 'superiors', 'are', 'never', 'friendly', 'think', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'capable', 'winning', 'one', 'will', 'ever', 'help', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'end', 'fate', 'world', 'literally', 'hands', 'weight', 'nearly', 'him.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'bleakness', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'script', 'final', 'reveal', 'result', 'Ender', 'response', 'across', 'tantrum', 'rather', 'moment', 'existential', 'despair', 'sort', 'generic', 'teen-savior', 'screenplay', 'other', 'problems', 'challenge', 'adapting', 'Ender', 'Game', 'was', 'always', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'how', 'do', 'write', 'child', 'parts', 'make', 'seem', 'deserving', 'adult', 'responsibility', 'disconnect', 'written', 'page', ""'re"", 'Ender', 'head', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'calculating', 'deductive', 'very', 'little', 'recreated', 'normal', 'slightly', 'precocious', 'teenager', 'other', 'normal', 'teenagers', 'consequence', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'intense', 'belief', 'Ender', 'prophetic', 'writing', 'bit', 'delusional', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'premise', 'child', 'generals', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'rest.What', 'left', 'start', 'capable', 'lead', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'meshes', 'well', 'role', 'except', 'insofar', 'oddity', 'seeing', '5', '1', 'adversary', 'bully', 'someone', 'nine', 'inches', 'taller', 'twenty', 'pounds', 'heavier', 'actually', 'better', 'Ford', 'who', 'one-note', 'gruff', 'hero', 'worship', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'underused', 'secondary', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'anyone', 'None', 'Petra', 'have', 'meat', 'roles', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Mazer', 'Rackham', 'mysterious', 'specter', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'individual', 'movie', 'One', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'trilogy', 'first', 'third', 'focusing', 'exploits.And', ""'ve"", 'got', 'action', 'two', 'major', 'set', 'pieces', 'training', ""'battle"", 'room', 'much', 'larger', 'what', ""'d"", 'envisioned', 'alien', 'planet', 'Ender', 'initial', 'experiences', 'battle', 'room', 'zero-G', 'were', 'most', 'engaging', 'parts', 'one', 'few', 'sections', 'where', 'movie', 'take', 'breath', 'new', 'thing', 'so', 'do', 'pretty', 'cool', 'counterpoint', 'later', 'adventures', 'commanding', 'proteges', 'simulator', 'were', 'exciting', 'enough', 'terribly', 'rushed', 'anticlimactic', 'sense', 'scale', 'actually', 'less', 'training', 'scenes.On', 'balance', 'Ender', 'Game', 'decent', 'film', 'memorable', 'more', 'pain', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'sympathetic', 'reaction', 'main', 'character', ""'d"", 'wait', 'discount', 'racks', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'fresh', 'eyes', 'may', 'have', 'better', 'experience']",N/A

As it is, it's just too rushed through and watered down from the book. &#34;oh cool they're about to do that part, oh wait it's already past that...&#34; happened numerous times. It's just rushed and no time is really given to anything.Spoon feeding whats happening:Another big complaint is that it's the same spoon fed crap 'storytelling' that hollywood does where they just tell you exactly whats going on instead of building up mystery/suspense/wonder/conflict/etc... that the book allows for. For instance, harrison ford tells ender RIGHT FROM THE DAMN BEGINNING that he's going to pit everyone else against him, and why. In the book, he doesn't know that, hes just confused as hell. spoon feeding, because we're all babbling babies that just wouldn't be able to comprehend things otherwise....The actingI was mostly fine with, maybe it's just me, but i can't take these kids seriously, and anytime they smile or have levity, i feel like im watching spy kids or something. one of the things im very happy they did was age them more, in the books they are a lot younger. can you imagine something like anakin from phantom menace being ender? dear lord i don't...An example of rushing things:When he goes to battle school, he spends time in several places, mostly in salamander group, and theres different ways he grows and excels, but in the movie it's literally him bouncing between things, and then all of a sudden he's trained the winning group and they're beating everyone. are you kidding me? at 37 minutes in, he can barely hit a target when the girl first takes him into the game field, and TWENTY minutes later at 57 minutes in, his dragon team defeats the other two teams. That's how much it's watered down/rushed through. I don't get a sense of this character growing at all.One more example of things being rushed:The video game he plays, it's a torment in the book, he comes back to it numerous times and as he grows, he figures things out about it. In the movie? nope, twice, done.Overall, i wish they just made some better choices in how to portray it. It isn't anywhere near the pile of garbage that became of Eragon, but i don't feel it does the book justice.",3,"It just had too big a shoes to fill, and it felt wrong on a number of levels",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2617,"['did', ""n't"", 'help', 'i', 'watched', 'bunch', 'friends', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'critical', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'well.It', 'started', 'off', 'OK', 'wanted', 'be', 'good', 'went', 'expecting', 'be', 'just', 'OK', 'based', 'prior', 'reviews.Too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'feeling', 'watching', 'was', 'i', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'longer', 'made', 'chunks', 'backstory', 'retrospect', 'be', 'flashback', 'otherwise', 'just', 'too', 'rushed', 'watered', 'down', 'book', '34', 'oh', 'cool', ""'re"", 'do', 'part', 'oh', 'wait', 'already', 'past', '34', 'happened', 'numerous', 'times', 'just', 'rushed', 'time', 'really', 'given', 'anything.Spoon', 'feeding', 'whats', 'happening', 'big', 'complaint', 'same', 'spoon', 'fed', 'crap', ""'storytelling"", 'hollywood', 'where', 'just', 'tell', 'exactly', 'going', 'instead', 'building', 'up', 'mystery/suspense/wonder/conflict/etc', 'book', 'instance', 'harrison', 'ford', 'ender', 'RIGHT', 'FROM', 'THE', 'DAMN', 'BEGINNING', 'going', 'pit', 'everyone', 'else', 'why', 'book', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'confused', 'hell', 'spoon', 'feeding', ""'re"", 'babbling', 'babies', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'comprehend', 'things', 'otherwise', '.The', 'actingI', 'was', 'mostly', 'fine', 'maybe', 'just', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'kids', 'seriously', 'anytime', 'smile', 'have', 'levity', 'i', 'feel', 'im', 'watching', 'spy', 'kids', 'something', 'one', 'things', 'im', 'very', 'happy', 'did', 'was', 'age', 'more', 'books', 'are', 'lot', 'younger', 'can', 'imagine', 'something', 'anakin', 'phantom', 'menace', 'being', 'ender', 'dear', 'lord', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'example', 'rushing', 'things', 'When', 'battle', 'school', 'time', 'several', 'places', 'mostly', 'salamander', 'group', 'theres', 'different', 'ways', 'excels', 'movie', 'literally', 'bouncing', 'things', 'then', 'sudden', 'trained', 'winning', 'group', ""'re"", 'beating', 'everyone', 'are', 'kidding', '37', 'minutes', 'can', 'barely', 'hit', 'target', 'when', 'girl', 'first', 'game', 'field', 'TWENTY', 'minutes', 'later', '57', 'minutes', 'dragon', 'team', 'other', 'two', 'teams', 'how', 'much', 'watered', 'down/rushed', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'character', 'growing', 'all.One', 'more', 'example', 'things', 'being', 'rushed', 'video', 'game', 'torment', 'book', 'back', 'numerous', 'times', 'things', 'out', 'movie', 'nope', 'twice', 'done.Overall', 'i', 'wish', 'just', 'made', 'better', 'choices', 'how', 'portray', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'pile', 'garbage', 'became', 'Eragon', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'book', 'justice']",N/A

1555750,A2NW4GICXSLUVZ,B008JFUNHI,"David H. Hanneman ""Dave H""","[3, 5]","I watched this at a friends house this weekend, and it was okay, a bit familiar, but confused most of my friends - I found myself explaining the parts that the director couldn't cram into the film. (Background: I've read the book before, and re-read it today) As it stands, the film is confusing to non-readers because it leaves out many of the motivations and explanations of some of the character motivations in order to fit the story into a feature length film.For those who are still interested in watching it but haven't read the book, here are some points that might help you enjoy the film more. (Or you could always read the book and get more out of it)  For those that haven't read the book - expect fast paced and &#34;shallow&#34; character development, with a touch of &#34;what was that?&#34; confusion.Character descriptions:Peter is Ender's brother; a cruel sociopath. The First child of a family, his online alter ego &#34;Locke&#34; is not shown in the film.Valentine is Ender's empathetic sister. The Second child of a family, her online pseudonym is &#34;Demosthenes&#34;.Andrew &#34;Ender&#34; Wiggin is the main character. The Third child, he is engineered to be a balance of his brother and sister.Capt Graff (Ford Harrison) is a Captain in the International Fleet, who thinks Ender could be the future Admiral of the fleet.As far as the movie character Wiggin: I think the actor they picked had the right personality, but was too tall. The book repeatedly emphasizes how you and small he is, and untrained in fighting he is - especially in the physical fight scenes, while in the movie he teaches fighting to Petra.Missing background: the movie tries but fails to convey the fact that the Earth was badly hurt during the first invasion. So badly hurt that the Earth looked to genetic engineering to get faster, stronger, and smarter soldiers.  This little bit of knowledge might help you understand why the International Fleet has such power to draft a mere child out of a family. Also, the bit about First and Second: most families were limited to just one child, a few families earned the right to have a second child, but only in very rare cases were the right to have a Third child granted to families. All of there Wiggin children were bascially drafted before their parents were allowed to conceive. (In the movie he is &#34;offered a place in the program&#34;)Ender is chosen to be a commander - Captain Graff hopes he will become the next Mazer Rackham, so Graff thinks it is best if he learns the isolation of command. This is why Graff singles him out on the first shuttle launch. Not shown in the film is a scene where the child sitting behind him keeps knocking him on the head until Ender grabs and breaks his arm. Also not shown is his later response where he cries in his bunk thinking back at this necessary cruelty.Upon arriving at Battle School, Ender is given the bunk closest to the door. Later in the movie it is explained that this is where &#34;toon&#34; (platoon) leaders sleep, because messages about the day's battle are slipped under the door. At this stage the &#34;Launchies&#34;, as the newcomers are called, don't realize that they are assigning him this position. Not shown very well in the movie is Ender's struggle with Bernard - the book takes more time to explain how Bernard the bully gathers supporters to make Ender's life miserable. The movie does show the result in the cafeteria scene where the other children finally start to show support for Ender.The movie drastically shortens the series of training battles that Ender has against the other school's armies, and the way that the instructors make it more and more unfair against Ender until the final battle against two armies at once. (Never before heard of) The movie doesn't explain Bonzo Madrid's Spanish machismo very well - and in the movie I think Ender realizes he has killed Bonzo Madrid, the commander of the Salamander army; in the book he is rushed away and told only that Bonzo was &#34;iced&#34; (slang for failing out or being expelled from school) and sent back to Spain. Going back to the earlier fight on Earth - in that case the movie only says he put a child in the hospital; in the book he killed the child but doesn't realize it until much later.Command school is also drastically shortened and simplified in the movie, and doesn't cover much of Razer's lessons.  The movie glosses over &#34;the reveal&#34; that most of the recent improvements came from examining the Bugger's ships. They also did a poor job of showing Razer's battle scene - in the book there were multiple identical Bugger ships and Razer noticed that one seemed to be at the center of actions; the movie seems to show just a single attack on one enemy ship surrounded by drones. One thing I think the movie did better was explaining that the &#34;Buggers&#34; somehow got into Ender's computer-simulated world and used it to communicate with him.The Ending (PLOT SPOILER): It was a bit awkward how the movie revealed everything in a few seconds - how the graduation ceremony wasn't a training simulation; how he destroyed an entire alien race (The movie says &#34;genocide&#34; but it is actually xenocide); how he was responsible for the death of so many fleet soldiers; the revelation of the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo (the children he killed). Also, the movie puts the queen egg reveal on the &#34;planet&#34; Eros with Petra (Eros is the largest asteroid in our planet's solar system - chosen by the Buggers for an advance base); the book sets the stage for the next book by having Peter and Valentine emigrate to a new colony planet which looks strangely familiar - just like the computer-simulated world that Ender had back in Battle School.As I said before, I thought this movie was pretty good, but was distracted by the confusion of my friends, who had no experience with the book. So take that into account before buying this.",2,For Orson Scott Card fans only,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,5948,"['watched', 'friends', 'house', 'weekend', 'was', 'okay', 'bit', 'familiar',

Myerscough,"[2, 3]","This movie is well made and decent enough as a movie although horribly rushed in pace, lot of big $$$ sci-fi special effects and blockbuster stuff, but they truly failed to grab fans of the book.  To me, the worst thing they did is make the kids way too old, which completely ruins the story.  The impact of the book is brought about by how incredibly young the children are, things that incredible at 6 or 8 years old don't mean much, are to be expected, creepy, or even seem juvenile when you are looking at a 16 year old.  I know the idiots in Hollywood think you can't have a movie if you don't have some hormonal eye candy prancing around - they even failed to do that.  They haven't created a heart-throb, they've spent 100 million dollars producing a flop that somehow managed to make a few dollars.The movie IS worth seeing, barely, but it could have been so much better.  The only way to have done this story justice would have been to break it down into two long movies or three two hour movies, and use actors the same age as those in the book.  This is not a teen romance, having the sexual tension thing with Petra and Ender was just plain wrong, and a waste of screen time.  Nemisis Bonzo Madrid, instead of being much bigger than Ender, is now a near midget homunculus, so big bad Ender is now killing a little kid whom he towers over, instead of being in any threatening situation at all???Too many dumb things about this movie to overlook.  I'm not sure I would have really even gotten a lot of the movie if I hadn't read the book about 20 times. Relationships were never established, character development was nil, If I didn't know who these people were from reading the book, I wouldn't have cared a thing about them. They could have added 10-15 minutes of character development to this movie and improved it dramatically, but it would still fail because Ender is an adolescent 16 year old from beginning to end, four years older than Ender was supposed to be at the very end.  The whole movie takes place with no aging of the characters, and the characters are slapped together in the same launch group.

This generation's children, limited by mandate like modern-day China, dream of one day participating in the orbital war games tasked with producing the next five-star general, and our protagonist (Ender) is the cream of the crop. Though steeped in lore and a long, rich back story, just like the novel, I was taken aback by just how much screen time was devoted to laying this groundwork. Maybe I'm spoiled by recent films, such as Pacific Rim, who manage to effectively build a similar world in just a five-minute opening narrative sequence, but it seems a colossal waste of time to still be working on the preamble midway through the second act. That gives the impression that we're just getting started when, in reality, the plot is already nearing its crescendo. It's a very literal interpretation of the source, with many lines and plot points arriving verbatim from the printed page, but plays as extremely hollow and  emotionally detached. Much of that can be attributed to Ender himself, an admittedly nuanced, complicated character that fails to make a graceful transition to the screen. Despite spotting several flashes of myself in his actions, I never empathized with him as an individual, nor did I like him on a basic level. This is a production that deserves points for tackling an extremely difficult property - I was sure the scenes of the game itself would make or break it, when they did neither - but one that, apart from a thoroughly excellent visual effort, falls just short of the mark in every way.

It seems like many reviewers still don't understand just how different novels and movies are as creative media. For movies, time is precious - most movies have only around 2 hours to tell their story - whereas books generally don't face a hard limit on the page count. Moreover, movie are expensive to make whereas books are cheap (basically the author's living expenses and and market campaign).Looking at Ender's Game as a movie and not just as an adaptation of the book, it actually holds up very well. Asa Butterfield manages to subtly portray both a ruthless and compassionate side to Ender. The rest of the actors generally do a good job bringing their characters to life, which is no small accomplishment give that most of them are kids. Even though the kids are older than their counterparts in the book, they still look, feel, and act like kids. Ender's voice even cracks a bit, like a kid going through puberty. While Ender and Petra do have quite a few scenes together, I was very pleased to see that Hollywood didn't try to insert romance into their relationship.Gavin Hood, the director, obviously realized that he wasn't filming the book and the script makes some significant but smart changes. The arc of Ender's siblings - Peter and Valentine - is drastically curtailed (even in the book, it was only peripheral to the main plot). More importantly, Ender's character arc isn't quite as exhaustive or exhausted as in the book. I appreciate that Hood implicitly acknowledges that movie Ender hasn't been at Battle School nearly as long as book Ender and the movie doesn't try to cheat and shortcut that experience. Ender's arc feels appropriate for what we see in the movie and going further probably wouldn't have been possible in 2 hours.Without spoiling anything, I was also impressed that they spent at least some time on the denouement. Not since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King have I felt so glad that a movie took time to give its characters at least some room to experience the fallout of events. Again, it's not the book, but the the essentials of the store are there.That said, I kept finding myself frustrated that the movie wasn't longer than 2 hours. There were parts that felt rushed or condensed. The beginning in particular has an odd way of introducing Ender's universe to audiences, most of who are not familiar with the book. The first 10-15 minutes are probably more confusing as the movie really throws you into the story pretty quickly. I thought overall the movie was better paced as it progressed, but even later scenes could have used more time to simmer. If anything, I thought the movie included too much from the book and tried to cover too much ground at the risk of not developing the main plot sufficiently. Some important characters, such as Mazer Rackham, just don't leave much of an impression because we don't spend enough time with them.I almost got the sense that Gavin Hood was forced by the studio to do some last minute editing to shorten the film. I would have thought that Good could have convinced the studio to allow a longer movie given the popularity of the novel, but that extra half hour probably would mean at least one less showing per day in most cinemas. I can only hope we'll see an extended version on DVD.Overall, this is a well done, if condensed, version of the Ender's Game novel. It's probably much more faithful to the book than most movie adaptations of novels (certainly more so than say the Hobbit). If you go into the movie with an appreciation for the realities of filmmaking, I suspect most fans of the book will enjoy seeing their favorite characters come to life.

This film focuses on only one story line: Ender's training at Battle School. He, along with other gifted children, must face tactical, strategic, intellectual, and moral challenges to determine which of them is the one person capable of defeating the insect like aliens who nearly wiped out mankind fifty years earlier and who appear now to be massing for a counterstrike. The novel interwove that thread with the story of Ender's beloved sister and psychotic brother, who scheme to influence and manipulate the politics of Earth. That subplot and a good portion of the mind game/dream sequences have been excised to focus on the combat training, while still emphasizing the moral ambiguity of the whole exercise. The film's success or failure rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the actor portraying Ender, and Asa Butterfield is more than up to the task. He completely captures Ender's combination of steely resolve, colossal intellect, sudden violence, and, above all, the empathy that conflicts with his other qualities. He easily holds his own in scenes with Ben Kingsley (looking like he wandered in from an audition for Queequeg in Moby Dick) and Harrison Ford, suitably weary and gruff (his character's name is 'Graff' in case anyone in the audience doesn't get it). The other young actors are just as good, with the exception of poor Moises Arias, who is given the thankless task of playing Ender's rival Bonzo as if he wandered in from a Bowery Boys movie. His lip curling, eye-popping menace is laughable, particularly since he looks about three feet tall.

1555817,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUNHI,FNDNreview,"[1, 8]","For an immeasurable amount of time, books have been a cornerstone of Hollywood's production of films.  In fact, your favorite movie is likely based on a novel or at the very least inspired by some piece of literature.  Popular books, including The Godfather, Jurassic Park, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy have all been adapted to film and translated so well they garnered heavy critical acclaim - not to mention they've changed the way films are produced.  On the other hand, while the highly praised novel-to-film adaptions stick out in a noteworthy manner, so do the novels that have been adapted that have turned out to be downright horrible.  In recent memory, Eragon, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones are just the tip of the iceberg in the category of film adapted ""flops.""  Now, there are some that sit in the fields of gray - being moderately presentable and somewhat entertaining, like the newest vision of The Great Gatsby or basically any one of the Twilight films.  Still, novel-to-film adaptions appear to be risky business, especially when a novel has critical acclaim of its own merit, along with a legion of diehard followers.  So, is the newest novel-to-film adaption, Ender's Game, a praise-worthy flick or just another forgettable Hollywood production?Based on the novel of the same name written by Orson Scott Card and directed by Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Ender's Game stars Asa Butterfield as Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggins - a young prodigy training to become a potential commander in the International Fleet to protect humanity against an alien species called the Buggers.  Handpicked by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford), Ender must work his way to the top of the command chain, and if Graff is correct, Ender might just be humanity's last hope.  However, before he can achieve his ultimate goal, Ender must earn the respect of his peers, including fellow classmates and teammates Petra Arkanian (Hailee Steinfeld), Bonzo (Mois&eacute;s Arias), and Bean (Aramis Knight).  Ben Kingsley, Viola Davis, and Abigail Breslin also star in supporting roles.Let's get this straight first - as this is not a comparison to the novel.  The book clearly stands on its own as one of the more admired novels in sci-fi lore, which also won several prominent awards since its debut as a full novelization in 1985 (it started as a short story in 1977).  Why it took so long for this book to be adapted to film is a bit of a head scratcher in itself.  Also, there is no need to discuss the often and sometimes offensive views of author Orson Scott Card.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, feel free to look it up - but the work of director Gavin Hood will not be judged even remotely based Card's moralistic or political views.MINOR SPOILERS FROM HERE...The film's star, Asa Butterfield is certainly the outstanding star in this epic space adventure.  Most recognizable from his leading role in Hugo, Butterfield does his best impression of Hugh Laurie's House and Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes - quickly dissecting individuals and attempting to sell himself as basically the smartest person alive.  For the most part, Butterfield is acceptable as a strategy ""wizard,"" but he's not anyone's ideal image of a savior.  In fact, at times he shows shades of Hayden Christenson as a bit of sniveling little brat that's difficult to like, mainly because of his attempt to act as though he's better than everyone else.  But, as the film progresses, his emotional journey will allow for much more viewer compassion - all leading up towards an emotional climax and eventually his final exchange with Harrison Ford's character.  This heated back-and-forth dialogue is the film's screen-stealer and most memorable interaction.To its complete benefit, Ender's Game has one of the greatest actors in the history of film lending his skillset in a supporting role to the young star - that being savvy film vet, Harrison Ford.  From the moment the story begins, Ford's character is there pulling the strings - even though he appears to be doing so at first in desperation for humanity's future existence.  As the film progresses, he takes more and more of an interest into the mindset and specific actions of young Ender - almost like a Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader relationship (yes, there's my one Star Wars reference).  For those that are familiar with the book, you know the road this relationship ends up traveling down - but for the people like me that haven't read the book, the end result of their relationship leads to a significant dilemma and many, many questions.  Was Graff ultimately doing the right thing for humanity?  Would a child have the capability and mental angst to do what was necessary to take down aliens?  Is Ender anything other than a patsy?  Was he too smart for his own good?The series of questions above lead to the major hang-ups of this film, which turns out to be the actual story progression itself.  Obviously, in order to find any sort of enjoyment in this film you literally have to take all sensibility and logic and just flat-out ignore it.  The fate of humanity is supposedly at stake and a child is in charge of the entire battle fleet?  Come on, that's a pretty wild stretch of the imagination - and maybe I'm being a bit ignorant here, but why aren't adults being trained to command the fleet?  Why doesn't humanity's previous hero, Mazer Rackham, portrayed by the always mesmerizing Sir Ben Kingsley, volunteer to take on the aliens once again?Overall, Ender's Game is an average human vs. alien film with stunning sound and visuals.  How it compares to the novel is for other people to decide, but as a standalone film, Ender's Game is an entertaining coming-of-age story - despite it being mostly predictable and occasionally self-serving.  However, the progressive training of Ender's character and Mighty Duck-like relationship building is where the real enjoyment and drama of this film lies.  And to be honest, after seeing the opening moments of the film, it's hard not to see the reflection of Independence Day, especially in the opening battle where one pilot's sacrifice saves humanity.  It begs the question:  are alien invasion stories getting stale?  Regardless and for the most part, Gavin Hood has created a film that will appease fans of the book, moderately entertain causal moviegoers, and possibly even encourage those of us who don't know much about Ender to get into the series.GRADE:  CFNDNreview.com",3,Popular novel 'Ender's Game' translates into ordinary film experience,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",2013,6523,"['immeasurable', 'amount',

1555845,A36WGHR8TO5DKT,B008JFUNHI,"Goldwave ""shopper""","[1, 3]","Not sure if the following is enough to require a ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** but just in case:I haven't read the book, but based upon this screenplay, the book pulled material from about a thousand similarly themed sci-fi novels and short stories I've read over the years.  It is predictable and extremely dated.I'm okay with suspending belief up to a point, especially for a rollicking sci-fi film.  However, this one is just plain stupid.  Who would possibly believe that an Earth filled with highly competent, trained and experienced adults would turn the survival of the planet and Mankind over to a bunch of youngsters?  Right, that would happen.Presumably, the premise there is the assumption that only children are capable of manipulating gaming gadgetry with the alacrity to defeat hoards of aliens.  Lord knows none of the adults currently manning the world's military, space and other technologically advanced sectors can push a few buttons and chew gum at the same time.And, as all children know, life experience of older people serves no purpose such as in making decisions, learning how to interact, and lead others, etc.  Well, according to the film's slowly drawn out story, the life experiences of these kids matters in developing them into suitable warriors.  But whatever life experience the old people got, in their day, apparently not.  Right.Further, there isn't even anything special clearly presented about any of these children characters.  It is a perplexing mystery why everyone finds the young protagonist such a mind-blower, for example.  Sure, your kid may be uber-talented at Pop Warner football, but do you then make him quarterback of the top team in the NFL?  To pretend, for the sake of adhesion to the film's premise, that Young Weedhopper's pedestrian ideas and instincts were things that none of the adults would have already considered is just laughable.  Maybe it would even have been barely believable if they'd gone with just one Superkid.  But no; it had to be ALL kids, as they were the only ones would could possibly do anything.  Right.And what is with the ants?  Ants (or ant-like aliens) sure end up being featured as the monsters in alien stories a lot.  I mean, seriously.  Ants again?  I guess that was what was in the original book, so they had to go with it.  I have to say when watching this, it was the appearance of the Ant People that caused my heart to sink finally, because I had to face the truth that I'd been suckered into a garbage film.

1555861,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUNHI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Ender's Game gets the Hollywood treatment and realizes my worst apprehensions. I'll give it this: the movie's good, but it's not great. It's bleak and humorless and takes itself way too seriously. Orson Scott Card's classic 1985 novel is my favorite sci-fi YA read of all time, and, in my opinion, the silver screen treats it rough in places. It would've better served the source material were this instead a show serialized on HBO rather than a 2-hour motion picture. So many anticipated things from the book were barely touched on or simply glossed over.I wonder if the ""We are not alone"" contingent were gratified when the chitinous alien race darkened our skies fifty years ago. Humanity barely eked out a win in the Formic War and, since then, deepest paranoia has incentivized us. Somewhen between then and now Earth's International Fleet has brainstormed a new and radical approach. Today, humanity rests its hope on its children. The reasoning: a child's brain is more adaptive, more cognitive, more intuitive, can integrate complex data more easily than adults. A program is founded to train and groom genius children into the next great military commanders. It's Earth's best response for when the swarming Formic horde inevitably re-invades.Here's Andrew Wiggin, here's Ender (Asa Butterfield). After a messed-up mind game or two, he's recruited to Battle School, that space station wherein he's expected to fiercely compete with other child prodigies for that rare selection to Command School. Ender comes from a genius family. He's the third Wiggin sibling to be admitted to Battle School. His brutal and unstable brother, Peter, and his compassionate sister, Valentine, had both washed up. It bodes horribly for Ender that he's viewed by the military academy's harsh taskmaster, Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford), as THE best hope for humanity in the coming war. Colonel Graff means to test Ender, to mess with Ender, to push him to the breaking point.It's bemusing that Indiana Jones and Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) play second fiddle to some kid. Except that the kid turns in real credible work here. Asa Butterfield is focused, His expressiveness makes Ender an open book for us. You observe the spirit-shattering toll his stint at Battle School inflicts on him. I still say Asa's too old to play the part.The best bits concern the null gravity war games held at Battle School, which are these visually arresting, smartly choreographed sequences. I wish the film had staged even more mock battles.The impartial movie audience - mostly those who haven't read the book - will be more receptive towards the movie. It's got a compelling lead and an irresistible, thought-provoking premise, and a whiff of The Last Starfighter and Starship Troopers. The f/x is impeccable.But I've read the book and I feel protective about the book. I think, ultimately, the movie doesn't do it justice. The heebie-jeebies you feel from these kids talking like adults is largely because the story barely makes an effort to depict these kids - other than Bean and Petra - as Ender's intellectual peers (which they are supposed to be). In fact, from jump Ender is projected as this very special, best-of-the-best type of war leader, and yet the film doesn't do enough to make him earn it. There are serious editing issues. The story feels rushed. You get no sense of how much time elapses. We see Ender rapidly go from a raw ""launchie"" to being promoted to squad leader to suddenly holding all the top scoring records in the game. But without the proper time reference, his evolution just feels too abrupt.More nitpicks: It's petty but it bugs me that the movie doesn't explain the root of the ""Ender"" nickname. It's like this: When Valentine was very young, ""Ender"" was the closest she got to pronouncing ""Andrew."" And ""Ender"" stuck.I waited in vain for someone, anyone, to refer to the Formics as ""buggers.""Harrison Ford seems engaged as the brusque, calculating Colonel Graff whose eye never strayed from the big picture. He makes a good foil for Asa and you resent but get the motivation behind Graff's deliberately damaging actions. You know why he isolates Ender. The book dives even more into it. For example, in the book, no sooner does Ender get comfortable with a group than Graff rips him out of it and reassigns him to a new group. And Ender has to start from scratch, earn everyone's respect all over again. The movie also brushes aside the second guessing and the remorse and paternal warmth that Graff comes to feel towards Ender in the book. Too bad, it would've humanized Graff more.In the end, there simply isn't room to adequately plumb the richness and complexity of Ender's Game. Barely touched on are the eugenics aspect, the ansible technology, and society's totalitarian state. Valentine and Peter's roles are criminally marginalized. Instead, Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), Ender's Battle School ally, serves to occupy Valentine's space. Petra becomes Ender's emotional bulwark. Ugh, okay, enough picking at the edges. I say, go watch the movie. I know I've bagged on it pretty mercilessly. I give it an above-average 3 - maybe 3.5 - out of 5 stars. It's got stuff going for it. It delivers the sci-fi thrills. The lead acting is solid. But after watching the movie, do read the book and see how much got left out. Then maybe you'll feel like I feel. The movie's good, but it's not great.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with Gavin Hood (screenwriter/director of Ender's Game)- Audio Commentary with producers Gigi Pritzker & Roberto Orci- 6

1555866,A2U649AS19PBYL,B008JFUNHI,"Henry Brown ""Hank""","[0, 0]","Watching this film, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw comparisons to other specific sci-fi on the big screen: Not too long ago the Star Trek reboot showed us Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura together at Star Fleet Academy. And some 15 years ago was the abysmal adaptation of Starship Troopers. I liked Star Trek, despite my annoyance at some aspects of it, but still, Ender&#8217;s Game is, so far, my favorite space cadets-playing-war-games movie.As far as Heinlein goes, this film captured the spirit of his military science fiction better than the movie that bore the title of his trail-blazing book. I&#8217;ve never read Orson Scott Card, but am tempted to at least add his books to my bucket list, now.Card used an interesting premise for this storyline: Future armed forces will train children for war, since youngsters adapt quicker to new/changing technology. Hence the hero is a child, with the responsibility of Earth&#8217;s very existence resting on his bony pre-adolescent shoulders.Or is he a hero? It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if the critics hate this movie because of what survives to the big screen from Card&#8217;s book: the suggestion that ruthlessness is required to win wars. That is watered-down considerably by writing the character as a &#8220;bleeding heart&#8221; type with an emotional maturity more on par with an aged monk&#8230;who just happens to be a savant with military tactics and strategy.The acting is fair, on average&#8211;nothing spectacular. The boy playing Ender is called upon to be misty-eyed in too many close-ups to remember, and he delivers. And Harrison Ford hams it up (this is a consistent phenomenon in his recent roles, seems to me) as Ender&#8217;s stage mom commander. Other actors are believable enough. (In Ford&#8217;s defense, the role did strike me as written with a lack of dimension.)What made the experience enjoyable for me was the character interaction written into the academy scenes. Group dynamics can be fascinating from an anthropological perspective (or depressing and infuriating from a participatory one). Reduce the group members in age to when the passion and motives of human beings are easily observed, and the intensity amplifies accordingly. For this reason I should have loved Lord of the Flies, but they lost me at &#8220;fade in.&#8221;I can nit-pick pretty much any movie to death (even those I like), and have. This one is no exception. But I&#8217;ll just mention one thing that bothered me: the mixing of naval and land force ranks in one branch of service. Having sergeants, colonels and admirals all in the same branch is just&#8230;wrong.But anyway, I found that the good outweighed the bad and Ender&#8217;s Game is worth a watch.Hank Brown blogs at Virtual Pulp (dot net).",3,Now I have to Read Card,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2758,"['Watching', 'film', 'couldn', '8217', 'help', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'other', 'specific', 'sci-fi', 'big', 'screen', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'showed', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'Uhura', 'together', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Academy', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'abysmal', 'adaptation', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'liked', 'Star', 'Trek', 'annoyance', 'aspects', 'still', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game', 'so', 'far', 'favorite', 'space', 'cadets-playing-war-games', 'movie.As', 'far', 'Heinlein', 'film', 'captured', 'spirit', 'military', 'science', 'fiction', 'better', 'movie', 'bore', 'title', 'trail-blazing', 'book', '8217', 'never', 'read', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'am', 'tempted', 'least', 'add', 'books', 'bucket', 'list', 'now.Card', 'used', 'interesting', 'premise', 'storyline', 'Future', 'armed', 'forces', 'will', 'train', 'children', 'war', 'youngsters', 'adapt', 'quicker', 'new/changing', 'technology', 'Hence', 'hero', 'child', 'responsibility', 'Earth', '8217', 'very', 'existence', 'resting', 'bony', 'pre-adolescent', 'shoulders.Or', 'hero', 'wouldn', '8217', 'surprise', 'critics', 'hate', 'movie', 'what', 'big', 'screen', 'Card', '8217', 's', 'book', 'suggestion', 'ruthlessness', 'required', 'win', 'wars', 'watered-down', 'considerably', 'writing', 'character', '8220', 'bleeding', 'heart', '8221', 'type', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'more', 'par', 'aged', 'monk', '8230', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'savant', 'military', 'tactics', 'strategy.The', 'acting', 'fair', 'average', '8211', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'boy', 'playing', 'Ender', 'called', 'be', 'misty-eyed', 'too', 'many', 'close-ups', 'remember', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'up', 'consistent', 'phenomenon', 'recent', 'roles', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'stage', 'mom', 'commander', 'Other', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'enough', 'Ford', '8217', 'defense', 'role', 'did', 'strike', 'written', 'lack', 'dimension', 'What', 'made', 'experience', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'character', 'interaction', 'written', 'academy', 'scenes', 'Group', 'dynamics', 'can', 'be', 'fascinating', 'anthropological', 'perspective', 'depressing', 'infuriating', 'participatory', 'one', 'Reduce', 'group', 'members', 'age', 'when', 'passion', 'motives', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'easily', 'observed', 'intensity', 'accordingly', 'reason', 'should', 'have', 'loved', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'lost', '8220', 'fade', 'in.', '8221', 'can', 'nit-pick', 'pretty', 'much', 'movie', 'death', 'even', 'like', 'have', 'one', 'exception', '8217', 'just', 'mention', 'one', 'thing', 'bothered', 'mixing', 'naval', 'land', 'force', 'ranks', 'one', 'branch', 'service', 'Having', 'sergeants', 'colonels', 'admirals', 'same', 'branch', 'just', '8230', 'anyway', 'found', 'good', 'outweighed', 'bad', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game', 'watch.Hank', 'Brown', 'blogs', 'Virtual', 'Pulp', 'dot', 'net']",N/A

There were huge, glaring plot holes and problems here and there, but overall a good movie. Once again, however, a director seems incapable of properly showing the passage of time. It seemed like the kid was training for about 2 weeks before he got promoted 3 different times. Then, after what seems like a month, he's a the commander of the entire fleet? Maybe the books did this better, but it didn't seem like much was at stake when the kids are playing training games the whole time. I know, the ending is quite a twist and the main focus is the &#34;morality of war&#34; concept, but until then it fell a little flat. Also, we really do not need a FREAKING VOICE OVER to open the movie. This is getting old, it is lazy, and too many movies TELL instead of SHOW.

In fact, it would barely qualify as a Sci-FI because the futuristic science is not one of the central theme of this movie.Exciting this movie really isn't. If you are looking for a Sci-Fi action flick, then you might be disappointed.This movie is about leadership. How does one become a leader? How does someone build trust and win the hearts and minds of his/her team? This movie provides rather insightful answers to these questions.In my view, everyone should be interested in learning to be a leader. Being a leader doesn't necessarily mean being a formal leader. It means having the qualities of a leader so that can build trust and gain influence of others around him/her. It is one of the life's great survival skills.What I didn't like about this film is the notion that teenagers can be more competent leaders and battlefield strategies than experienced adults. Really? If teenagers are so competent, how come our society is not led by teenagers? The movie definitely downgrades experiences and wisdom of adults as something irrelevant. Now that's fantasy.Pros:1)Great book on how to develop one's leadership skills.

To me, the casting is perfect and the ambitious production values match the book's phenomenal success. If you've read it you know this is Nirvana for a lover of computer generated imaging: Space ships, free floating trainees in a gravity-free environment, a decimated planet, futuristic living quarters, the list goes on and on.Ender is so called because in this future world, families are only allowed two children: He is a third, AND he is gifted. This has not slipped past the powers that be, because they need a gifted new tactician to help them destroy their sworn enemy.We see:* Harrison Ford (""Indiana Jones"" and ""42"") is Colonel Graff, absolutely determined to annihilate the enemy, once and for all; collateral damage can go to blue blazes. Once again, Ford has to earn his salary: He is saddled with a few bits of really lame dialogue.* Asa Butterfield (""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" and ""Hugo"") is our eponymous hero: intelligent, ethical and focused. He has to straddle the gap between the teenage world of bullying and the adult world of interplanetary warfare. This talented kid must have a terrific agent!* Viola Davis (""The Help"" and ""Prisoners"") is Major Gwen Anderson, the only heart in a heartless situation. This actress always impresses me; there is a moment as she leaves a room... BRILLIANT!* Hailee Steinfeld (""True Grit"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"") is Ender's friend Petra, she's there for him when he's assigned a hostile classroom. Petra is a better role for Steinfeld than Juliet.* Ben Kingsley (""Hugo"" and ""Iron Man 3"") is Mazer Rackham, a seasoned fighter drafted to coach our youngster in the ways of the enemy. Why did they choose this accent for this character? ...hmmm...Rated PG-13, youngsters can see other youngsters fight an intergalactic battle (the rest of us will suspend disbelief). To me, all the CGI in the world is no substitute for a good story. Here, courtesy of writer/director Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""), we have a really good story, albeit a bit far-fetched, so the CGI works just fine for me. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine offers everything from battling spaceships to Butterfield's eyelashes.I'm ready for the obvious sequel.

So I will do my best not to do the old &#34;book better than movie&#34; schtick because before I even went to see it I believed it would be impossible to condense the qualities of the book into a feature length movie.  And I was right.That being said, the movie WAS quite satisfying.  I wouldn't call it great as the movie failed to fully encapsulate the true genius of Ender and his extraordinary ability to socially and intellectually outmaneuver his rivals...which is really what this movie is all about.  But it was close enough for me to enjoy it.  To really get to the core of what the book was about I believe Ender's Game would have been far better off as an HBO-type 12 episode series.  As it is, this movie tended to remind me a bit of Dune.  Not that it was badly done (Dune was not exactly a great movie), it's just that it seemed like 20 pages of book went by every minute which necessarily required the movie to move too quickly for its own good.  Had I not read the book first I think I might have been confused during some parts of it (Ender's relationships with his siblings, with Bernard, why Bean's input was critical to Ender, etc).Harrison Ford did a great job as Colonel Graff and Asa Butterfield was a believable Ender, although he is too old by the books' standard.  Dang it...I did it again.  Ok, I just decided I simply cannot keep from comparing it to the book.  Sorry.  But I took my wife and three kids (ages 10, 15, and 17) and they all thought it was great (and they didn't read it).  I hope that helps.  They even started a discussion after the movie to ask questions about why Ender made certain decisions as a leader so I think that qualifies the movie as somewhat thought provoking.One thing you may think about if you haven't read the book is this, &#34;Why am I watching a movie about a kid who seems to be playing video games?&#34; or more directly, &#34;Why am I paying money to watch a kid PLAY video games?&#34;  This story is more about his development into a leader and decision-making process so try to prepare for it that way and you should derive a good amount of enjoyment from it.",4,Meets expectations for such a great story,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,2246,"['many', 'others', 'have', 'stated', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'one', 'favorite', 'time', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'not', 'do', 'old', '34', 'book', 'better', 'movie', '34', 'schtick', 'even', 'went', 'see', 'believed', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'condense', 'qualities', 'book', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'was', 'right.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'WAS', 'quite', 'satisfying', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'great', 'movie', 'failed', 'fully', 'encapsulate', 'true', 'genius', 'Ender', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'socially', 'intellectually', 'outmaneuver', 'rivals', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'close', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'really', 'get', 'core', 'what', 'book', 'was', 'believe', 'Ender', 'Game', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'off', 'HBO-type', '12', 'episode', 'series', 'movie', 'tended', 'remind', 'bit', 'Dune', 'Not', 'was', 'badly', 'done', 'Dune', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', '20', 'pages', 'book', 'went', 'minute', 'necessarily', 'required', 'movie', 'move', 'too', 'quickly', 'own', 'good', 'Had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'confused', 'parts', 'Ender', 'relationships', 'siblings', 'Bernard', 'why', 'Bean', 'input', 'was', 'critical', 'Ender', 'etc', '.Harrison', 'Ford', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Colonel', 'Graff', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'was', 'believable', 'Ender', 'too', 'old', 'books', 'standard', 'Dang', 'did', 'again', 'Ok', 'just', 'decided', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'comparing', 'book', 'Sorry', 'took', 'wife', 'three', 'kids', 'ages', '10', '15', '17', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'hope', 'even', 'started', 'discussion', 'movie', 'ask', 'questions', 'why', 'Ender', 'made', 'certain', 'decisions', 'leader', 'so', 'think', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'thought', 'provoking.One', 'thing', 'may', 'think', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', '34', 'Why', 'am', 'watching', 'movie', 'kid', 'who', 'be', 'playing', 'video', 'games', '34', 'more', 'directly', '34', 'Why', 'am', 'paying', 'money', 'watch', 'kid', 'PLAY', 'video', 'games', '34', 'story', 'more', 'development', 'leader', 'decision-making', 'process', 'so', 'try', 'prepare', 'way', 'should', 'derive', 'good', 'amount', 'enjoyment']",N/A

The government selected his parents and even allowed him to be a third child in a society that limited families to two children.  He was a virtual genius and his intellect and strategic capabilities far exceeded those of other humans even at his young age.  He was created to lead the Earth into a war in which they would both win and survive or it would mean the end of all mankind.  The book was all about Ender's rigorous training and preparation to be a warrior and a leader.  It was the majority of the book and yet the movie makes the training seem short and almost superficial when compared to the book. This book is a classic of science fiction that any one that is a Sci-Fi fan has read and enjoyed.Ender is trained that there is only a win and nothing else. The leaders of Earth know the truth.  They almost lost the last war with the alien Buggers and by a fluke of battle won, almost by accident.  They know the Formics will return and they know that they need a new generation of military minds to win the next time or be defeated and destroyed.This is a good film and the special effects are just outstanding.  The use of key leading actors in the filming made the movie even better.  Harrison Ford played a great role in the film and I liked how he and Ben Kingsley added real grit to the training of Ender Wiggins.  I have to say though that the book was better than the movie. Isn't this usually the case though?  The story deviates from the book in several areas and I believe it was done to make the movie more enjoyable for the people that have never read the story.  In order to do the book real justice the movie would probably had to be done in parts with a lot of focus on the battle school training and the command school training.  Unfortunately if you had read the book you loved the story and the details.  The detail of how Ender was hammered into being the leader needed to fight the war is a major part of the written book.The movie was good and I give it a 4 star rating.  I am also glad how the CGI was great but it didn't just take over the film and destroy the story totally.  Some of the last movies I have watched were just so much CGI action that the story suffered by being overwhelmed by the CGI artists.  If you are a lover of the book you will have to see the movie.

They're training for a war that's hurtling their way.Comments: I thought this was decently interpreted, though I'll admit that it's been years since I read Ender's Game. I think my feelings for the movie sort of mirror my feelings for the series as a whole. The original Ender's Game book was excellent, unique, fun, and one of the very few times I've seen the whole bugs-in-space thing actually work well for the story. If they'd ended it at the end of the climatic battle, I would have rated it a 4, but they went on to do the whole guilt-trip thing that seems to be Ender's lot for the rest of his life. To be honest, it feels like a waste at that point.Good:The video game scenes were neat.Acting was fine. Not exactly something I'd throw major awards at, but decent.It included a lot of the memorable scenes from the book. (People are always going to dispute what gets cut from a book to movie move.)Neutral:Score is all right. A lot of the pounding themes are fitting for the scenes, but there's no one theme that stands out as particularly memorable. It's okay, but not a soundtrack I'd rush out to buy because I want it playing on loop while I work.To Improve:Although the acting was decent, if you haven't read the book, you will likely feel that the story's disjointed. There's not much here to really feel connected to the characters. Who are they? What makes them tick? This is where movies in general are at a disadvantage compared to a book.Conclusion: It's an entertaining 2-hr flick.

1555977,AIYHUYQNF5GCA,B008JFUNHI,"Laurence R. Hunt ""Laurence Hunt""","[3, 5]","Basically, Steven Aldersley has accomplished an excellent review (and overview) of this movie in its context as novel made film. I will add that I also am a lifelong science fiction fan, and have also read the book (just once - it was the Heinlein novels that I re-read, which, unfortunately, have never been made into top-tier movies). I wish to clarify a few additional points from my own perspective. Above all, yes, this is a very successful translation of book to screen, and that is not easily done - so credit to everyone involved in this project. I chose a 5-star rating because the movie definitely exceeded my expectations, and by quite a bit. In fact, I was dubious at the outset, as I had thought that Harrison Ford appeared weak in the previews, and the viewing of the film confirmed this. Honestly, Mr. Ford came across, in my view, more as a washed-up former leader, though I will credit him for rising to the occasion under pressure (both in his on-screen role and as an actor who appears to be literally &#34;off his peak&#34;). But Mr. Ford will have to &#34;get it together&#34; to carry such roles in future. Asa Butterfield as Ender was almost a perfect pick, as he was able to avoid either over-playing or under-playing the character. I was not expecting the actor playing Ender to look like a young Arnold Schwarzenegger - as Ender's strengths are ultimately cerebral, but I though he appeared a little bit too de-conditioned actually to have survived the physical tests (peer conflicts) with which he was faced. But let's be clear: Ender's character is all about mental agility and fast processing, not physical strength, and this could easily have been over-done in the opposite direction, so the 96-pound weakling who kicks dust in the face of the bully without bothering with the physical training is an acceptable compromise, in my view. (But honestly, after 8 years of military training, he'd have to have grown some muscle mass to complement his brain power!) Finally, I do not have the Kiwi accent down pat, so I can't comment on Mr. Kingsley's mastery of it (or not), but Ben Kingsley MADE THIS MOVIE. Without him, it would definitely have failed - honestly, the other pieces could not have come together without Mr. Kingsley's consummate performance. So, among the actors, I would award Mr. Kingsley with an extra star for his ability to define Mazer Rackham onscreen with a searing portrayal of a fierce and intense character. Let me also second Mr. Aldersley. One can hope for a sequel. As to Mr. Card's politics (with which I happen to disagree), he has used his right to free speech appropriately, and recognized his limits - even commenting that he has &#34;lost&#34; on the issue, so why the hubbub? This movie has nothing whatsoever to do with the author's politics. In fact, the movie backed off from what I think is by far the most difficult aspect of the book as a young readers' selection - and that is that Ender was in fact selected based in part on his capacity to take life (a requirement of any soldier, but a fact of life from which we usually prefer to shield our children). If there had been any public controversy about this film, it is this area, if any, that should have been considered difficult and disturbing. That is, Ender is raised as a child soldier, and in the background, there are questions that hark to such stories as those of Omar Khadr, the Lord's Resistance Army, etc. Should we train children to kill from a very young age? One can easily argue that, in context, the humans of the future had little choice - as we were to face an adversary that appeared to have in mind our extinction - certainly a genocidal mass slaughter so that they could inhabit our planet. And should we defeat them, we of course are faced with a similar ethical dilemma - which Mr. Card addresses in later works... particularly as it is stressed that Ender is an empathetic character. Without moving into the domain of spoilers, the means by which Ender was brought into active duty also raise multiple difficult ethical questions - as was indeed the author's intent. Later works are required to address and explore these dilemmas, and that same disclaimer applies to the film version. So, as is often the case, the public controversy about the author's politics was a misguided diversion from the extremely difficult ethical questions about child soldiers raised by his work - about which there has been far less public debate. Note that neither the film nor broad public comment has yet really attended to this issue. Were I to be discussing this story with young people, that is certainly the question I would be asking them to think about. Perhaps that opportunity will arise, with a sequel....",5,A difficult project handled successfully,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,4743,"['Basically', 'Steven', 'Aldersley', 'accomplished', 'excellent', 'review', 'overview', 'movie', 'context', 'novel', 'made', 'film', 'will', 'add', 'also', 'am', 'lifelong', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'just', 'once', 'was', 'Heinlein', 'novels', 're-read', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'top-tier', 'movies', 'wish', 'clarify', 'few', 'additional', 'points', 'own', 'perspective', 'yes', 'very', 'successful', 'translation', 'book', 'screen', 'not', 'easily', 'done', 'so', 'credit', 'everyone', 'involved', 'project', 'chose', '5-star', 'rating', 'movie', 'definitely', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'quite', 'bit', 'fact', 'was', 'dubious', 'outset', 'had', 'thought', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'appeared', 'weak', 'previews', 'viewing', 'film', 'confirmed', 'Honestly', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'came', 'view', 'more', 'washed-up', 'former', 'leader', 'will', 'credit', 'rising', 'occasion', 'pressure', 'on-screen', 'role', 'actor', 'who', 'be', 'literally', '34', 'peak', '34', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'will', 'have', '34', 'get', 'together', '34', 'carry', 'such', 'roles', 'future', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Ender', 'was', 'almost', 'perfect', 'pick', 'was', 'able', 'avoid', 'over-playing', 'under-playing', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'actor', 'playing', 'Ender', 'look', 'young', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Ender', 'strengths', 'are', 'ultimately', 'cerebral', 'appeared', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'de-conditioned', 'actually', 'have', 'survived', 'physical', 'tests', 'peer', 'conflicts', 'was', 'faced', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'Ender', 'character', 'mental', 'agility', 'fast', 'processing', 'not', 'physical', 'strength', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'over-done', 'opposite', 'direction', '96-pound', 'weakling', 'who', 'dust', 'face', 'bully', 'bothering', 'physical', 'training', 'acceptable', 'compromise', 'view', 'honestly', '8', 'years', 'military', 'training', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'grown', 'muscle', 'mass', 'complement', 'brain', 'power', 'Finally', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Kiwi', 'accent', 'down', 'pat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'Mr.', 'Kingsley', 'mastery', 'not', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'MADE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'failed', 'honestly', 'other', 'pieces', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'together', 'Mr.', 'Kingsley', 'consummate', 'performance', 'So', 'actors', 'would', 'award', 'Mr.', 'Kingsley', 'extra', 'star', 'ability', 'define', 'Mazer', 'Rackham', 'onscreen', 'searing', 'portrayal', 'fierce', 'intense', 'character', 'Let', 'also', 'second', 'Mr.', 'Aldersley', 'One', 'can', 'hope', 'sequel', 'Mr.', 'Card', 'politics', 'happen', 'disagree', 'used', 'right', 'free', 'speech', 'appropriately', 'recognized', 'limits', 'even', 'commenting', '34', 'lost', '34', 'issue', 'so', 'why', 'hubbub', 'movie', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'do', 'author', 'politics', 'fact', 'movie', 'backed', 'off', 'what', 'think', 'far', 'most', 'difficult', 'aspect', 'book', 'young', 'readers', 'selection', 'Ender', 'was', 'fact', 'selected', 'based', 'part', 'capacity', 'take', 'life', 'requirement', 'soldier', 'fact', 'life', 'usually', 'prefer', 'shield', 'children', 'had', 'been', 'public', 'controversy', 'film', 'area', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'difficult', 'disturbing', 'Ender', 'raised', 'child', 'soldier', 'background', 'are', 'questions', 'hark', 'such', 'stories', 'Omar', 'Khadr', 'Lord', 'Resistance', 'Army', 'etc', 'Should', 'train', 'children', 'kill', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'argue', 'context', 'humans', 'future', 'had', 'little', 'choice', 'were', 'face', 'adversary', 'appeared', 'have', 'mind', 'extinction', 'certainly', 'genocidal', 'mass', 'slaughter', 'could', 'inhabit', 'planet', 'should', 'defeat', 'course', 'are', 'faced', 'similar', 'ethical', 'dilemma', 'Mr.', 'Card', 'later', 'works', 'particularly', 'stressed', 'Ender', 'empathetic', 'character', 'moving', 'domain', 'spoilers', 'means', 'Ender', 'was', 'brought', 'active', 'duty', 'also', 'raise', 'multiple', 'difficult', 'ethical', 'questions', 'was', 'indeed', 'author', 'intent', 'Later', 'works', 'are', 'required', 'address', 'explore', 'dilemmas', 'same', 'disclaimer', 'applies', 'film', 'version', 'So', 'often', 'case', 'public', 'controversy', 'author', 'politics', 'was', 'misguided', 'diversion', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'ethical', 'questions', 'child', 'soldiers', 'raised', 'work', 'been', 'far', 'less', 'public', 'debate', 'Note', 'film', 'broad', 'public', 'comment', 'yet', 'really', 'attended', 'issue', 'Were', 'be', 'discussing', 'story', 'young', 'people', 'certainly', 'question', 'would', 'be', 'asking', 'think', 'Perhaps', 'opportunity', 'will', 'arise', 'sequel']",N/A

I had read Ender's Game many years ago, it actually being my gateway to science fiction, and was doubtful this was the type of book that would even translate well into a film version. Beneath the storyline is a deeper meaning that I was dubious as to whether anything Hollywood got their filthy paws on might survive.To an extent, there was a major element of summer blockbuster written all over this film, and the plot did suffer from oversimplification - or rather, Ender's motivations were, but no more so than what would occur in any book adapted for the screen. While we lose that process of introspection which is what ultimately made the book so thought provoking, an excellent job was done with keeping true to the book's overall theme, and I was actually astounded by the job Gavin Hood did with the screenplay. It was also apparent how much Orson Scott Card contributed to this effort, as a tremendous amount of the emotional content of the novel has translated so well here. There was a depth beyond the CGI that I was truly impressed to see, so any minor nuances of the story that were lost are easily forgiven by the entertainment value and considerable respect given to the source material.A word on Asa Butterfield, who was an actor I was not at all familiar with beforehand. His performance was sheer brilliance, and how he conveys the inner workings of the mind of a child with a supremely disciplined intelligence beyond his years, does speak volumes of his talent. As for Harrison Ford, I had all but given up on him ever appearing in anything worthwhile again, so was delighted to see a classic performance from him, and fully intend to view this movie a second time, just for the acting. It was astounding, from the visuals, to the casting, to the nuances of character that seemed to have been picked up on so well by both director and cast, and one of very few films actually worth the aggravation and expense of going to the movies.",4,Impressive Adaptation,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,2070,"['Having', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'took', 'gamble', 'movie', 'expecting', 'yet', 'massive', 'disappointment', 'had', 'read', 'Ender', 'Game', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'actually', 'being', 'gateway', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'doubtful', 'was', 'type', 'book', 'would', 'even', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'version', 'storyline', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'was', 'dubious', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'got', 'filthy', 'paws', 'might', 'survive.To', 'extent', 'was', 'major', 'element', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'written', 'film', 'plot', 'did', 'suffer', 'oversimplification', 'rather', 'Ender', 'motivations', 'were', 'more', 'so', 'what', 'would', 'occur', 'book', 'adapted', 'screen', 'lose', 'process', 'introspection', 'what', 'ultimately', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'thought', 'provoking', 'excellent', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'keeping', 'true', 'book', 'overall', 'theme', 'was', 'actually', 'astounded', 'job', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'did', 'screenplay', 'was', 'also', 'apparent', 'how', 'much', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'contributed', 'effort', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'emotional', 'content', 'novel', 'translated', 'so', 'well', 'here', 'was', 'depth', 'CGI', 'was', 'truly', 'impressed', 'see', 'minor', 'nuances', 'story', 'were', 'lost', 'are', 'easily', 'forgiven', 'entertainment', 'value', 'considerable', 'respect', 'given', 'source', 'material.A', 'word', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'who', 'was', 'actor', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'beforehand', 'performance', 'was', 'sheer', 'brilliance', 'how', 'inner', 'workings', 'mind', 'child', 'supremely', 'disciplined', 'intelligence', 'years', 'speak', 'volumes', 'talent', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'ever', 'appearing', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'again', 'so', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'classic', 'performance', 'fully', 'intend', 'view', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'acting', 'was', 'astounding', 'visuals', 'casting', 'nuances', 'character', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'so', 'well', 'director', 'cast', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'actually', 'aggravation', 'expense', 'going', 'movies']",N/A

1555999,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B008JFUNHI,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[19, 23]","I am reviewing the film ""Ender's Game"" based on the film itself (as a film overall) and not in comparison to the incredibly renowned original Orson Scott Card book of the same name. With that said, Director and adaptor of the screenplay Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Rendition) did a really artistic and thought evoking job of telling the story of a gifted young boy who is persecuted because of his size, intelligence and ability to win at everything he tries.In this film there is a back-story of aliens, once again, after having attacked Earth in the past and for whatever reason left our planet in a wake of destruction and chaos. Years later the military expects their immanent return and as a result, are training qualified young people to do battle in a highly sophisticated and technological manner.With a really talented and experienced cast, like Harrison Ford (Mosquito Coast, Witness) as Colonel Graff, who is the man who first sees in one boy, a person who may stand above the crowd both intellectually and strategically for the cause. Graff is a trainer of young people in the art of war, combat and strategy. Harrison gives a real gritty hard-nosed performance that almost at times makes you dislike his combative and Napoleon-like way of commanding his trainees.Stepping up to the plate rather impressively is Asa Butterfield (Hugo, The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas) playing Ender Wiggin, who has this impressive intensity in his eyes and an incredible conviction to his character with his performance. Asa is sharp and alert to watch and does the overcoming of his peers very well. It's unfortunate his end mission isn't what he thought it was and as a result makes good on something that was completely out of his hands.Sir Ben Kingsley (Schindler's List, Hugo) plays Mazer Rackham, the legendary fighter of all who actually defeated the aliens, the only one to defeat the aliens in an all-out attack. Coupled with his strangely bizarre tattoo make-up, Ben give a sharp, `Master Yoda'-like performance who has a mission of only training the best of the best. Like Ender.Special note must go to Viola Davis for playing the cunning and sharp Major Gwen Anderson who keeps trying to keep Harrison from over zealously over-training these young people into their own deaths. Viola's chemistry and opposite thinking against Harrison makes for some nice conflict scenes together.The film has some wonderful visual effects and the sequences in the ant-gravity training sphere above Earth are stunning to watch. The aliens are also a twist on the insect looking type that are actually not as they appear to be perceived by humans.The film for me left a really good message in my head about how young people, when they see this film, can realize that peer pressure, your extraordinary or ordinary gifts are never something to be ashamed of. This film is a positive message about young people or the underdogs who win on their wits, intelligence and cunning. ""Ender's Game"", besides being a Sci-Fi visual delight to look at, at the heart of it, tells a real story of courage and hope. Again, the book is far more intense and detailed, but this as a separate film holds up with a good story and characters. A really good film on many levels, with a positive outlook on humanity and how prejudice is not always found on our planet.",4,"""Ender's Game"" Has A Nice Message For Youth Today""",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,3343,"['am', 'reviewing', 'film', 'Ender', 'Game', 'based', 'film', 'film', 'overall', 'not', 'comparison', 'incredibly', 'renowned', 'original', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'said', 'Director', 'adaptor', 'screenplay', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'X-Men', 'Origins', 'Wolverine', 'Rendition', 'did', 'really', 'artistic', 'thought', 'evoking', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'gifted', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'persecuted', 'size', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'win', 'everything', 'film', 'back-story', 'aliens', 'once', 'again', 'having', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'past', 'reason', 'left', 'planet', 'wake', 'destruction', 'chaos', 'Years', 'later', 'military', 'immanent', 'return', 'result', 'are', 'training', 'qualified', 'young', 'people', 'do', 'battle', 'highly', 'sophisticated', 'technological', 'manner.With', 'really', 'talented', 'experienced', 'cast', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Mosquito', 'Coast', 'Witness', 'Colonel', 'Graff', 'who', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'one', 'boy', 'person', 'who', 'may', 'stand', 'crowd', 'intellectually', 'strategically', 'cause', 'Graff', 'trainer', 'young', 'people', 'art', 'war', 'combat', 'strategy', 'Harrison', 'real', 'gritty', 'hard-nosed', 'performance', 'almost', 'times', 'dislike', 'combative', 'Napoleon-like', 'way', 'commanding', 'trainees.Stepping', 'up', 'plate', 'rather', 'impressively', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'Hugo', 'Boy', 'Stripped', 'Pajamas', 'playing', 'Ender', 'Wiggin', 'who', 'impressive', 'intensity', 'eyes', 'incredible', 'conviction', 'character', 'performance', 'Asa', 'sharp', 'alert', 'watch', 'overcoming', 'peers', 'very', 'well', 'unfortunate', 'end', 'mission', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'result', 'good', 'something', 'was', 'completely', 'hands.Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Hugo', 'Mazer', 'Rackham', 'legendary', 'fighter', 'who', 'actually', 'defeated', 'aliens', 'only', 'one', 'defeat', 'aliens', 'all-out', 'attack', 'Coupled', 'strangely', 'bizarre', 'tattoo', 'make-up', 'Ben', 'give', 'sharp', 'Master', ""Yoda'-like"", 'performance', 'who', 'mission', 'only', 'training', 'best', 'best', 'Ender.Special', 'note', 'must', 'go', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'playing', 'cunning', 'sharp', 'Major', 'Gwen', 'Anderson', 'who', 'trying', 'keep', 'Harrison', 'zealously', 'over-training', 'young', 'people', 'own', 'deaths', 'Viola', 'chemistry', 'opposite', 'thinking', 'Harrison', 'nice', 'conflict', 'scenes', 'together.The', 'film', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'effects', 'sequences', 'ant-gravity', 'training', 'sphere', 'Earth', 'are', 'stunning', 'watch', 'aliens', 'are', 'also', 'twist', 'insect', 'looking', 'type', 'are', 'actually', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'perceived', 'humans.The', 'film', 'left', 'really', 'good', 'message', 'head', 'how', 'young', 'people', 'when', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'realize', 'peer', 'pressure', 'extraordinary', 'ordinary', 'gifts', 'are', 'never', 'something', 'be', 'ashamed', 'film', 'positive', 'message', 'young', 'people', 'underdogs', 'who', 'win', 'wits', 'intelligence', 'cunning', 'Ender', 'Game', 'being', 'Sci-Fi', 'visual', 'delight', 'look', 'heart', 'real', 'story', 'courage', 'hope', 'Again', 'book', 'far', 'more', 'intense', 'detailed', 'separate', 'film', 'up', 'good', 'story', 'characters', 'A', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'positive', 'outlook', 'humanity', 'how', 'prejudice', 'not', 'always', 'found', 'planet']",N/A

1556008,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B008JFUNHI,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","A downgraded, softer, watered down Andrew Ender Wiggin rises to meet his destiny...I liked this film and I am glad that I watched it, although it is definitely significantly INFERIOR to the book. Below, more of my impressions, with very limited SPOILERS.As probably everybody already knows, this sci-fi war film is situated in the future, years after a failed alien invasion of the Earth. Fearing that another, even deadlier invasion can take place, humanity created a powerful space fleet and trained hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers and officers. But in order to lead this huge armed forces, it was decided that a new kind of generals and admirals was needed, one able to learn and adapt faster when faced by complex and always varying alien tactics of space fighting. This film tells the story of a very promising recruit, young Andrew Ender Wiggin, who may just be the future war leader of the whole humanity - if only he manages to survive the excruciatingly difficult, increasingly painful and sadistically cruel training in which complex war games play a great role...We learn those things in the first minute of the film and about the rest I will say no more. Young Asa Butterfield who plays Ender is simply AMAZING, as good as he was in &#34;Hugo&#34;. Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley give a great show as his teachers, with Viola Davis and Nonso Anozie supporting them valiantly as respectively war academy main psycholgist and the hulking drill sergeant. Young actresses Hailee Steinfeld and Abigail Breislin play also important roles, those of Petra, Ender's friend in academy and Valentine, Ender's older sister.Now, this film is an adaptation of an archi-classic of Sci-Fi letters, written in 1985 by Orson Scott Card. The book &#34;Ender's game&#34; made quite a splash when first published and got all the yearly awards a SF book can get and it didn't age at all - in fact it is still a DARN GOOD READ. But I understand that it was not possible to make a big budget Hollywood adaptation without significant changes - and also it was proably not possible to ask the young actors to do on screen some of the things that are done in the book... For that reason, Ender from the film is a quite different character than the one from the book - he is softer, gentler, weaker, more vulnerable and lacks most of the ruthlessness described in the novel. Also, at the very end of the film, his actions are not motivated by pity and mercy as in the book but by guilt and remorse - and THAT is, I believe, the one change that was not necessary and it REALLY hurt this film.For the needs of the film many of topics were also completely abandoned and the whole training was shortened, with especially the number of fascinating war games significantly reduced.Still, I can not find it in my heart to take away one star from the rating, because notwithstanding all the changes the director and the actors made a hell of a job and this film is a very pleasant watch! Excellent actors, great CGI, good action scenes, a tense and dramatic narration, very honest dialogs, all this makes &#34;Ender's game&#34; a good, solid Sci-Fi film - and there is not so much of them around. I warmly recommend to see it in the cinemas as long as it still play. I certainly will buy the DVD when it is available.

1556009,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B008JFUNHI,MadMacs,"[5, 13]","PG-13 Review. If adult language insults your well being - please stop now. Not being funny - I mean, stop reading.Never read Orson Scott Card. Never heard of 'Ender's Game' until this movie was produced. I want that clear before anyone continues on and reads this review. If those two criteria are relevant to you - then, again, stop now. Additionally, I don't have a stake one way or another whether this film succeeds or fails. Like the 'Hunger Games' franchise, I can only review what was presented.Tells the story of Ender Wiggin, cadet in training for our combat forces and a potential leader in the making. Growing up in a world where Earth was nearly conquered by an invading species from another planet, it's discovered that only the young have the mental ability to effectively manage the vast interconnected network of automated defense drones. Is he the leader that the training command believes will finally deliver victory? Tested and pushed, Ender, rather quickly, moves from unsure youngster to confident and disciplined digital warrior. Yet, something is definitely amiss. Are his vivid recurring dreams more than just visualizations of missed family?An okay flick.Young actors, especially recently, have been notoriously miscast. Chosen by committee rather than honesty; fully developed on-screen characterization a skill that is seemingly not a requirement to be selected for the lead role anymore. Does anyone still think Hayden Christensen did a great job for Lucas? But let's give credit where it's due. Asa Butterfield pulled off his role with conviction, delivering a believable portrayal as the 'chosen one', the young person destined to lead humanity to victory over our dread enemies.But suppose grandpa and his wrinkly bald buddy just didn't ""get it""? What if the gray ones didn't ""understand"" the true nature of the battlefield?This crucial plot element struck me as sycophantic and insulting. Very much a marketing department's wet dream. The salvation of humanity turns out to be a bunch of teenage kids who play video games. And simultaneously making out the older folks as inept and morally blind.Really? &lt;smh>Talk about pandering to one's target market. Shamelessly stroking a very specific audience with a very specific message: Old People Need Not Apply. You gray ones can't operate a computer, don't know how to write code, and you certainly can't sit on your backside for endless hours grasping and playing with one's joystick. (Yes, I know, it's a ""controller"". But my snark wouldn't have worked as well.&lt;g>)Y-Gen Americans already have a rather warped sense of the world. And how our elders are treated, or mistreated as in this case, is par for the course in this pathetic brave new world.In an irony worthy of a movie itself, whom can we thank for this freakish existence? The Baby Boomers. Those arrogant self-important jackasses that first posited, then reveled, in this ridiculously moronic belief system: ""Don't Trust Anyone Over 30"".Thanx Hippies. Payback is a bleep ain't it?Overall, a decent movie with a typical slate of special effects to help offset the incredibly patronizing, shallow screenplay. And my interpretation has always been, if a production 'needs' special effects to make the film ready for consumption - then it's already a failure. In essence, no point with the gravy if the meat is no good.There was real potential here, a chance to really explore and celebrate the concept of youth overcoming perceived limitations; to give the young the chance to be something more than a clich&eacute;. But the filmmakers blew it in favor of a tired boilerplate of a plot that's been done more times than Madonna has been mounted.Screenplay - One. Acting - Four. SFX - Three.Overall - 3 stars.Movie Recommendation:- While this recommendation is nothing like 'Ender's Game' - check out this indie from the UK - 'Attack the Block'. A movie that addresses disreputable and broken youngsters who, when given a proper challenge, find their own footing in a way that was both fascinating and entertaining.",3,Shamelessly Sycophantic,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,4058,"['PG-13', 'Review', 'adult', 'language', 'insults', 'well', 'being', 'please', 'stop', 'now', 'Not', 'being', 'funny', 'mean', 'stop', 'reading.Never', 'read', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'Never', 'heard', ""'Ender"", 'Game', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'want', 'clear', 'anyone', 'reads', 'review', 'two', 'criteria', 'are', 'relevant', 'then', 'again', 'stop', 'now', 'Additionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stake', 'one', 'way', 'film', ""'Hunger"", 'Games', 'franchise', 'can', 'only', 'review', 'what', 'was', 'presented.Tells', 'story', 'Ender', 'Wiggin', 'cadet', 'training', 'combat', 'forces', 'potential', 'leader', 'making', 'Growing', 'up', 'world', 'where', 'Earth', 'was', 'nearly', 'conquered', 'invading', 'species', 'planet', 'discovered', 'only', 'young', 'have', 'mental', 'ability', 'effectively', 'manage', 'vast', 'interconnected', 'network', 'automated', 'defense', 'drones', 'leader', 'training', 'command', 'will', 'finally', 'deliver', 'victory', 'Tested', 'pushed', 'Ender', 'rather', 'quickly', 'moves', 'unsure', 'youngster', 'confident', 'disciplined', 'digital', 'warrior', 'something', 'definitely', 'amiss', 'Are', 'vivid', 'recurring', 'dreams', 'more', 'just', 'visualizations', 'missed', 'family', 'okay', 'flick.Young', 'actors', 'especially', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'notoriously', 'miscast', 'Chosen', 'committee', 'rather', 'honesty', 'fully', 'developed', 'on-screen', 'characterization', 'skill', 'seemingly', 'not', 'requirement', 'be', 'selected', 'lead', 'role', 'anymore', 'Does', 'anyone', 'still', 'think', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Lucas', 'let', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'pulled', 'off', 'role', 'conviction', 'delivering', 'believable', 'portrayal', ""'chosen"", 'one', 'young', 'person', 'destined', 'lead', 'humanity', 'victory', 'dread', 'enemies.But', 'suppose', 'grandpa', 'wrinkly', 'bald', 'buddy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'What', 'gray', 'ones', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'true', 'nature', 'battlefield', 'crucial', 'plot', 'element', 'struck', 'sycophantic', 'insulting', 'Very', 'much', 'marketing', 'department', 'wet', 'dream', 'salvation', 'humanity', 'out', 'be', 'bunch', 'teenage', 'kids', 'who', 'play', 'video', 'games', 'simultaneously', 'making', 'out', 'older', 'folks', 'inept', 'morally', 'blind.Really', 'lt', '>', 'Talk', 'pandering', 'one', 'target', 'market', 'Shamelessly', 'stroking', 'very', 'specific', 'audience', 'very', 'specific', 'message', 'Old', 'People', 'Need', 'Not', 'Apply', 'gray', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'operate', 'computer', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'write', 'code', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'backside', 'endless', 'hours', 'grasping', 'playing', 'one', 'joystick', 'Yes', 'know', 'controller', 'snark', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'well.', 'lt', '>', 'Y-Gen', 'Americans', 'already', 'have', 'rather', 'warped', 'sense', 'world', 'how', 'elders', 'are', 'treated', 'mistreated', 'case', 'par', 'course', 'pathetic', 'brave', 'new', 'irony', 'worthy', 'movie', 'whom', 'can', 'thank', 'freakish', 'existence', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'arrogant', 'self-important', 'jackasses', 'first', 'posited', 'then', 'reveled', 'ridiculously', 'moronic', 'belief', 'system', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Trust', 'Anyone', '30', '.Thanx', 'Hippies', 'Payback', 'bleep', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Overall', 'decent', 'movie', 'typical', 'slate', 'special', 'effects', 'help', 'offset', 'incredibly', 'patronizing', 'shallow', 'screenplay', 'interpretation', 'always', 'been', 'production', 'special', 'effects', 'make', 'film', 'ready', 'consumption', 'then', 'already', 'failure', 'essence', 'point', 'gravy', 'meat', 'good.There', 'was', 'real', 'potential', 'here', 'chance', 'really', 'explore', 'celebrate', 'concept', 'youth', 'overcoming', 'perceived', 'limitations', 'give', 'young', 'chance', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'clich', 'eacute', 'filmmakers', 'blew', 'favor', 'tired', 'boilerplate', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'times', 'Madonna', 'been', 'mounted.Screenplay', 'One', 'Acting', 'Four', 'SFX', 'Three.Overall', '3', 'stars.Movie', 'Recommendation', 'recommendation', 'nothing', ""'Ender"", 'Game', 'check', 'indie', 'UK', 'Block', 'movie', 'disreputable', 'broken', 'youngsters', 'who', 'when', 'given', 'proper', 'challenge', 'find', 'own', 'footing', 'way', 'was', 'fascinating', 'entertaining']",N/A
1556010,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B008JFUNHI,magellan,"[5, 11]","Please note that this review is about the movie rather than the DVD release.This movie was visually appealing with great special effects, but you expect that given the state of CGI these days. And the battle and command school action scenes were good. But the movie's main problem is that it dumbed down or glossed over too many aspects of the book that are necessary to the story. And some of the facts were just wrong, as other reviewers here have mentioned also. It's certainly an intense film that keeps the tension building until the final climax. That and the special effects came off well.But the film reminded me of Starship Troopers from 15 years ago, based on the Robert Heinlein novel, which, although doing justice to the battle scenes (despite the lack of powered armor) and violence in the book, glossed over too much of the back story, and overall didn't do justice to the complexity of the book. Sci-fi fans here will also probably recall the film versions of Dune, which had a few problems of their own but did a better job of doing justice to Herbert's novel.Back in the 30s and 40s Hollywood knew how to tell a complicated, subtle story. The classic movies of the Golden Age of Cinema put modern films to shame. Now special effects are everything and the plot, dialog, and story line suffer and take a back seat to the special effects, especially in the sci-fi genre. Why this is I don't know. Perhaps modern directors and producers aren't as erudite as their Golden Age counterparts or they think modern audiences are just dumber and need similarly dumbed down movies. Perhaps this is what sells so that's what people get. I don't claim to be an expert on film history so perhaps someone here who is will comment on that at some point.",3,Okay but not great,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1755,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'movie', 'rather', 'DVD', 'release.This', 'movie', 'was', 'visually', 'appealing', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'expect', 'given', 'state', 'CGI', 'days', 'battle', 'command', 'school', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'good', 'movie', 'main', 'problem', 'dumbed', 'down', 'glossed', 'too', 'many', 'aspects', 'book', 'are', 'necessary', 'story', 'facts', 'were', 'just', 'wrong', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'have', 'mentioned', 'also', 'certainly', 'intense', 'film', 'tension', 'building', 'final', 'climax', 'special', 'effects', 'came', 'off', 'film', 'reminded', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'based', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'novel', 'doing', 'justice', 'battle', 'scenes', 'lack', 'powered', 'armor', 'violence', 'book', 'glossed', 'too', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'complexity', 'book', 'Sci-fi', 'fans', 'here', 'will', 'also', 'probably', 'recall', 'film', 'versions', 'Dune', 'had', 'few', 'problems', 'own', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'doing', 'justice', 'Herbert', 'novel.Back', '30s', '40s', 'Hollywood', 'knew', 'how', 'tell', 'complicated', 'subtle', 'story', 'classic', 'movies', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Cinema', 'put', 'modern', 'films', 'shame', 'Now', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'everything', 'plot', 'dialog', 'story', 'line', 'suffer', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'special', 'effects', 'especially', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Perhaps', 'modern', 'directors', 'producers', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'erudite', 'Golden', 'Age', 'think', 'modern', 'audiences', 'are', 'just', 'dumber', 'need', 'similarly', 'dumbed', 'down', 'movies', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'what', 'people', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'be', 'expert', 'film', 'history', 'so', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'here', 'who', 'will', 'comment', 'point']",N/A

1556015,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B008JFUNHI,Marshall Lord,"[1, 1]","""Ender's game"" by Orson Scott Card was first published in 1977 as a short story. The author expanded it to a full length novel by the same name published in 1985 which is regarded by many people including myself as one of the greatest SF novels ever written. Some elements of the film are also taken from Card's parallel novel, ""Ender's Shadow.""This review of the 2013 film version, which has just come out on blu-ray and DVD, is based on watching it at home on disc with my family.I don't think the film is quite up to the level of brilliance of the books. Some of the most visionary aspects of the novel, such as the way it foresaw the role of online debate and discussion at a time when the World Wide Web was a twinkle in Tim Berners-Lee's eye, do not make it into the film. A viewer who has not read the book would have no conception that the hero's brother and sister, who are major characters in the book and its' sequels but minor ones in the film, are as influential in their own right in the history of the ""Enderverse"" as he is.Nevertheless this film is a pretty good stab at bringing to the screen the central plot of the original short story and many of the moral dilemmas and challenges of the full novels - and I don't think you could have fitted much more of the books into a film of this duration. The plotting is reasonably tight and keeps the action going, much of the acting is excellent, and the special effects which show space travel, a ""battle school"" on a giant orbiting space station, and finally space battles, are brilliant.The premise for the story is that Earth has been at war for decades with an alien race who originally attempted to invade our planet and were beaten back at great cost. The insectlike alien enemy are usually referred to in the film and in some of the more recent books in the series as ""Formics"" - in the original book they were usually referred to as ""bugs"" or by a similar and even ruder word. Presumably the more polite term has been adopted to reduce charges of xenophobia. In fact neither the books nor the film are at all xenophobic, but some of the characters in them are: one of the moral issues the story addresses is whether fear and hatred are the only possible response to the enemy and whether mankind might be too quick to assume that the extermination of one or other race are the only possible outcomes.The human race has decided, for reasons which will become clear, that to win the war it is necessary to start training the best potential commanders to lead Earth's military while they are still children. The story is set at ""Battle School"" and then ""Command School"" where the children with the highest military command potential are being trained to lead the fleets.Harrison Ford plays Colonel Graff, the commander of Battle School, whose job is to pick the boys and girls who will lead Earth's forces to victory or defeat. Graff is determined to develop the best and most ruthless commanders no matter how much pressure he puts these children under: Voila Davis plays Major Gwen Anderson, Battle School's psychologist who is horrified by how far Graff is prepared to go.Asa Butterfield plays Ender Wiggin, the boy who Graff is trying to turn into a new Caesar or Napoleon - and who is sharp enough to respond, when Graf shares that aim with him, that Caesar was assassinated by his own people and Napoleon was defeated. Ben Kingsley plays the older Mazer Rackam who becomes Ender's final teacher (the younger Rackham who defeated the original Formic attack is portrayed by Kyle Clements).Aramis Knight plays Bean, Ender's lieutenant and the closest thing he has to a friend, who is the viewpoint character of the book ""Ender's Shadow.""I though the acting by Butterfield, Ford, Davis and Kingsley was superb - Butterfield and Ford were both nominated for acting awards for their performances in this film.I'm trying to think of a way to give this film a fair rating without damning it with faint praise. I did enjoy it - my 12 year old son thought it was brilliant and is desperately hoping there will be a sequel.That may be difficult this time around - not least because the other books in the series would be even harder to film than ""Ender's Game"" which the author and others have been trying to turn into a film for a long time.I don't believe this will be the last film version of ""Ender's Game"" that I shall see. Gavin Hood and his colleagues have shown that it is possible to produce an entertaining film version of this book.

That being said, I was both ecstatic and horrified when I heard that they were making the movie. I had always imagined George Lucas to direct the film adaptation and when I heard that it was directed by someone I wasn't familiar with I was less than happy. In fact I was terrified that they were going to destroy my memories of the book. Luckily, they didn't. Yes, they tweaked parts of the story, and left out some information. However, surprisingly it didn't bother me. I was happy with the end result. It was clear that they tried to keep it as close to the story as possible. Yes, there are some things that I wish they had included in the movie. However, I understood why they didn't. That being said, I recommend that you actually read the book prior to seeing the movie. Is it essential? No! However, I believe that it will make it a lot easier to understand and appreciate the story and the actions of the characters. The book was wonderfully detailed and made you feel empathy for Ender and his teams. However, due to the length of the movie, that is something that they were unable to fully develop or focus on. Prior to seeing the movie, I read a few reviews by respected critics. Frankly, it was clear that most of them had never read the book, or they didn't bother to pay attention. This is one of those movies that are catered more towards adults. There are a lot of underlying messages and philosophical questions in this movie. If you do not pay attention, then you won't ""get it"". ***If you are expecting a comedy, romance, action/adventure story then you probably will not be satisfied.

But if you need more details, here goes.10 years after Will Smith and Randy Quaid  saved the planet from an alien invasion in Independence Day. There has been a fear that the aliens might come back and try again. So now Han Solo is spying on kids via cameras and has zoned in a kid named Ender who is supposedly really, really smart because he beats video games in ways no one else can. Quite frankly if I could just hook my brain up to a pro action replay, I probably could do that too.Anyway, Harrison ford takes the kid away just like Anikin Skywalker was taken from his mommy, and this star of the movie with a high level of midi-clorians is taken to a space station to begin battle training. The way the military train you for combat in the future is have you play laser tag in zero gravity! War, it's fantastic!So the kid clocks a few more video games, gets passed around to a few teams, the editing makes it seem like it's all happening in a matter of days before the main boy does the typical &#34;I can't handle this&#34; rubbish that has been done to death in films, only to come back and form his own underdog team... here comes the Mighty Ducks in spaceeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!The end battle was too predictable, not so much of how things happen, but you knew what the end scenario was going to be before it happened. Then it just ends on a stupid note.I'm off to do more than save the Earth, but the whole universe.... a weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!It's too rushed. You just don't care about this kid. He goes from cadet school, to space, to being switched around, to being unsure of himself and back to try and save humanity in the blink of an eye. All you get is the feeling that this kid is supposed to be very intelligent, has a violent side when pushed, a possibly sociopath, doesn't like authority and will disobey it, and is in love with one of this team members. Pretty much sounds like the story of D-Generation X! (Ahhh, SUCK IT!) There is too many pointless bully scenes that don't pay off in the end, they are just there to show this kid is unstable and will do anything to win. But I just could not care any less.Visually the scenes and CGI work well enough... but I couldn't help bu wonder if it was a distraction? All that junk flying around in a zero gravity game of laser tag... was it stuff that was necessary, or just visual distractions to cover the fact that it's a game of kids trying to get from one side of the room to the other with at least one member not being shot? Come again, how does that train you to be a commander? Because Ender's game plan was pretty simple, any old jock could have thought that up.If you don't go into movies like I do, and you aren't so critical of films, and just want to be mind &^%$#@ by visions of space and 10 foot ant's, then this movie might be worthy of a night in front of the tv with a bag of popcorn.... but if you go in and expect this to be more than a barely half decent flick, one that once you watch, you will never want to see again, then you might wanna avoid it. However, be your own judge... see it if you must. Then you can come back and we can make fun of it together.",2,"Come 'ere, Kid.

1556041,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUNHI,mitchell5954,"[0, 2]","Ender&#8217;s Game, to be honest is a bit of a disappointing experience.  I was expecting a big, action-packed, visually pleasing sci-fi flick, but got a very clich&eacute; filled mediocre movie.  If you are expecting this film to be a big sci-fi war movie like the trailers made it out to be then you will be disappointed.  I have not read the original novel, so I will not make any comparisons between the two.  With such a notable cast I was expecting this to be great, but it really was not.  However, there are still some good things about the movie that prevents it from being that bad.50 years ago Earth was invaded by aliens called the Formics, but were driven away by this genius commander named Mazer (Ben Kingsley).  Now the military is training highly intelligent children to turn them into elite soldiers in preparation for their return.  One of these children is named Ender who has caught the attention Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) because of his incredible strategic abilities.  Ender is the third child in a family of three that have tried to become a soldier.  His sister failed because she was too soft and his big brother failed because he was too violent, but Ender was a balance of the two.  Throughout the film Ender goes through different types of training in military school to mold him into a great leader.The biggest disappointment in the film is the pacing.  Most of the film consists of Ender in military school training until the very end which is the best part of the entire movie.  The story is the generic &#8220;oddball that does not fit in and gets bullied at first, but later is loved and eventually has to lead everyone to victor against the antagonist&#8221; story that we have seen a million times before.  I know it is essential for character development for Ender, but I wanted more high quality fights.  We get a couple of decent fights here and there but they are not that great.  The only impressive fight we get is at the very end.We do not even get that much character development during the military training.  Ender gets a fair amount but the side characters get nothing.  We know nothing about any of Ender&#8217;s so-called friends.  We know nothing of their past or motivation, and we barely spend any time with them.  These people start out hating Ender, and then ten minutes later they like and even agree to follow him and join his team.  We do not spend nearly enough time getting to know these people to warrant this sudden change of heart.Even the brother and sister get no development or even much screen time.  His father and mother are not touched on at all.  We only see the brother for two minutes at the beginning but then he is never seen again.  They do not do much with the sister either, which is too bad because these are his family members.  Ender&#8217;s motivation is to prove himself to his family, mainly his sister, so I thought that they would play more of a role but they do not.Mazer and Colonel Hyrum do not get any development either.  Hyrum is an angry man that wants to destroy the Formics but we do not know why and we never find out.  All we get for Mazer is that he was this legendary commander that drove away the Formics 50 years ago.  We do not know of his backstory or his motivations.  Both Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley do a great job acting wise, but neither is given much of a character or much to do, especially Ben Kingsley.  Kingsley literally does not show up until the 3rd act, and even then does not do much.You have the token bullies that are only there to provide conflict for Ender.  There is nothing to them at all.  If there is a sequel (which seems unlikely) that provides more development for all these characters that I mentioned then I can somewhat let this go, but until then these are all big issues.Ender himself, to be honest, is not that interesting.  Granted, he is fairly smart and is not overly whiny like many protagonists in these types of stories tend to be.  However, there is nothing that I found that intriguing about him to keep me invested, at least until the end.  The actor who plays him, Asa Butterfield, is not the best actor either.  His acting seemed very stiff.  He has only one expression on his face the entire film.  He does not show genuine emotion until the very end.There are some good aspects to the film, though.  The effects are breathtaking.  They are on part with those of Avatar and Prometheus.  The action scenes are fairly decent and are fun to look at.  The final action scene in particular is amazing.  At the very end of the film there is a twist that I found to be very surprising and effective.  In my opinion, the twist at the end of this film is better than most of the twists in M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s movies.  The twist at the end and the great effects saved this film from being entirely forgettable.  Plus, the ending is one point I began to truly sympathize with Ender and start to like him slightly more.Overall, Ender&#8217;s Game is a good visual experience.  If you want a good visual experience then go see this in the theatre.  Other than that I would say to just buy or rent it when it comes to DVD.  For the most part it is a very generic movie.  I am glad I saw it but, at the same time, I would not care much if I did not see this film again.",2,Wasted Opportunity I Thought!,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",2014,5320,"['Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game',

1556044,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUNHI,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","It seems to me that many films start off very promising, transition to a certain momentum and then, alas, stumble across the finish line in a disappointing fashion.  This film is just the opposite.  Full disclosure up front.  I wasn't, and am still not familiar with the source material but I suspect it is pretty well written.  I should also disclose that I'm a  sci-fi fan and have been since I first saw a movie with a genetically altered giant ant (""Them"").This story is about Earth barely surviving an alien assault from another planet by a species called Formics.  They appear to be giant ant-like (see!) creatures looking to colonize our planet.  After an all-out war, the Formics were eventually defeated with much of the glory going to a pilot known as Mazer Rackham (a tatted up Ben Kingsley).  Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) heads up a unit responsible for finding what is left of the Formics on their home planet and annihilating them with a preemptive strike.  The key to success appears to be young pubescent teens who are gifted intellectually but also don't have their brains cluttered with life experiences like the adults.  Hey, that makes some sense to me in a future world.Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) has been identified as the primary candidate to lead the assault.  In essence he would be the battlefield commander.  This middle section of the film is where the story falls flat.  First, Master Butterfield wasn't very convincing as the guy who would stand up to bullies in the various training sessions.  Physically he isn't very imposing.  One of Ender's primary allies and potential romantic interest is Petra (Hailee Stenfeld) who suits the role.  Director and screenwriter Gavin Hood muddles this part of the story but saves it with some terrific CGI battles (simulated) in preparation for the final attack.  Without giving too much away, the adults are still running the show.The film's nice premise focuses on idea of using children in a war time setting.  The film's conclusion raises other moral issues which for me, turned on a light as to what the film was actually about.  Recommended.The Blu ray version of the film comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film has a lot of CGI in place and the green screen shots that go with it.  In general, most of the movie is shot indoors or in space so the natural look of the film is somewhat dark.  Fortunately the black levels are excellent.  Some of the color designs in the film seem problematic but that isn't the fault of the transfer technicians, so no complaints on the video.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track and it is very, very good.  I was particularly impressed with the surround sound distribution.  It is evident that the technicians paid attention to this element and it shows.  Never offensive but relevant to the various scenes.  Excellent dynamic range which again is often lacking.

1556072,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B008JFUNHI,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[0, 1]","1985 was a good year --- not only was I born but this was the publishing year of what many call the original YA dystopia. Ender's Game as a film had a lot of work to do from the outset. It not only had to overcome years of developmental hell but had to contend with severe controversy surrounding the Orson Scott Card's questionable ideals as well as high expectations from the series' legion of die-hard fans. Now, I haven't ever read the books so I had no basis of comparison when going into the film but I did have high hopes. Based on the trailer, the movie looked awesome! Unfortunately, for me, Ender's Game did not defy the odds.The story follows Ender Wiggin, a newly recruited member of a battle school designed to train young children to fight a war against the alien forces that attacked Earth years prior. Ender finds himself alienated and must overcome incredible pressure from everyone, and most of all, from himself, in order to lead the team to victory.I can't really say if the plot remains faithful to Card's original novel, but I did enjoy the idea of it. For the time it was written, it was probably uniquely original, but being late to the game, I can't say I haven't already seen it all before. Despite the predictability of the storyline, my biggest gripe was that it felt like key elements were missing --- not plot holes exactly, just like critical scenes had been cut at the last minute, like there were gaps in important information. Instead, it relies heavily on these grand info dumps from Wiggin via the narration and the character development and storyline suffer because of this. Another big problem I had was with the story's overall cohesiveness, in that there is none. The whole movie feels as though it takes place in the matter of a week and because of this, there's very little depth. I lost track of time watching it, probably because I was doing other things other than watching it. In short, I just didn't care.You would think that the star-studded cast (Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, Hailee Steinfeld, Viola Davis & Abigail Breslin) would be enough to save this drowning movie, but alas, such was not the case. Breslin has but a minor role and Davis, arguably the best in her role, isn't featured nearly enough to leave a lasting impression. Ford and Kingsley deliver passable performances, but they hardly shine. And newcomer Asa Butterfield is wooden and stiff in his role as Ender. I don't know if the character in the book is this way, but he's incredibly unrelatable in the film. Things come to him far too easily and I had no idea why he was appointed to be the leader of the group. Nothing he said or did really gave me a good feeling about him. Honestly, I didn't care about a single one of the characters and if you don't care then what's the point?I guess the look and feel of the film were about the only things I think the filmmakers got right. The set and cinematography were spot-on, everything I imagined from the spacey, sci-fi setting. I want to play in that Battle Room. So. Freaking. Amazing. But other than that, Ender's Game was an utter fail as a stand alone movie. If it's done anything positive, it's only made me want to read the book that much more.Food for Thought: All in all, I was less than impressed with Ender's Game. Though it was a visually stunning movie, I found it to be predictable, full of wooden performances and too hard to comprehend.

1556097,A11TUHEHHENLBC,B008JFUNHI,"Patrick L. Boyle ""Mr. Wonderful""","[4, 10]","I read the book a long time ago. Then I read it again - by mistake. I do that occasionally when I have forgotten that I have already read it. That's not a good sign. If you get half way through a book before it all seems familiar that's a sign that the story isn't very memorable.The book is very famous. It is by far the most famous book written by Orson Scott Card. It spawned a number of sequels. Everyone one with any interest in Science Fiction has heard of 'Ender's Game'. But watching the movie version after all these years it seems trite. That's because it has already inspired a number of movies including &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;The Matrix&#34;.It is very reminiscent of the Matrix. Harrison Ford keeps saying over and over - &#34;He's the One&#34;. I wanted to say in refutation - &#34;No, he isn't dummy, Keanu Reeves is the One&#34;.  The idea that little kids make good fighters was just exploited in last year's &#34;Hunger Games&#34;. And the military training meme was also seen recently in &#34;Starship Troopers&#34;.  So the whole story setup is anything but fresh.The special effects are of course perfect. When the space ship took off I reminisced about how that same scene was done in &#34;Fire Maidens of Outer Space&#34;.  In that super cheesy 50's movie they cut in some stock footage of a V-2 rocket going up. When it returned to Earth they showed the same rocket with the film inverted. Even as a tiny rug rat I knew this was all wrong. Movies should be better than that.In &#34;Ender's Game&#34; the CGI special effects are damn near perfect. So it was surprising that about an hour into the film when I was overtaken by a wave of boredom. If I hadn't paid five dollars to see it in high definition I would have switched to something else. It just wasn't a strong enough story to sustain my interest. I didn't believe in the characters. I didn't believe in the situation. And what's worse, I didn't care.The real point of the plot is not about training little kids to be soldiers but about the morality of genocide. Personally this theme lays an egg. Who cares about these aliens? Kill 'em all seems OK to me. But Card tries to elicit an emotional response by having the old switcheroo in the final reel. The nasty aliens who we thought had tried to kill us were really sweet, sensitive bugs who just wanted to communicate. Ender feels real bad that he killed all of them.When I read the book, this emotional climax left me cold. When I saw this scene played out on the screen last night it also left me cold. It was too flat. We had never seen the alien bugs except in a few heavily excerpted flashbacks. We never saw them in person - just their space ships. We were never given any reason to love them or hate them - so who cares if they have been wiped out?We need some new plots. We need more Sci-Fi movies that endorse alien species genocide like &#34;Starship Troopers&#34;. Most Sci-Fi movies recently have endorsed genocide of humans (e.g. Avatar). Here in California we could use a little genocide of the Delta Smelt - but we have been fed all this tripe about the horrors of species elimination and we have lost our  own will to survive.",1,As Bad as the Book,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,3189,"['read', 'book', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'Then', 'read', 'again', 'mistake', 'do', 'occasionally', 'when', 'have', 'forgotten', 'have', 'already', 'read', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'get', 'half', 'way', 'book', 'familiar', 'sign', 'story', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable.The', 'book', 'very', 'famous', 'far', 'most', 'famous', 'book', 'written', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'spawned', 'number', 'sequels', 'Everyone', 'one', 'interest', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'heard', ""'Ender"", 'Game', 'watching', 'movie', 'version', 'years', 'trite', 'already', 'inspired', 'number', 'movies', 'including', '34', 'Hunger', 'Games', '34', '34', 'Matrix', '34', '.It', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Matrix', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'saying', '34', 'One', '34', 'wanted', 'say', 'refutation', '34', 'No', ""n't"", 'dummy', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'One', '34', 'idea', 'little', 'kids', 'make', 'good', 'fighters', 'was', 'just', 'exploited', 'last', 'year', '34', 'Hunger', 'Games', '34', 'military', 'training', 'meme', 'was', 'also', 'seen', 'recently', '34', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '34', 'whole', 'story', 'setup', 'anything', 'fresh.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'course', 'perfect', 'When', 'space', 'ship', 'took', 'off', 'reminisced', 'how', 'same', 'scene', 'was', 'done', '34', 'Fire', 'Maidens', 'Outer', 'Space', '34', 'super', 'cheesy', '50', 'movie', 'cut', 'stock', 'footage', 'V-2', 'rocket', 'going', 'up', 'When', 'returned', 'Earth', 'showed', 'same', 'rocket', 'film', 'inverted', 'Even', 'tiny', 'rug', 'rat', 'knew', 'was', 'wrong', 'Movies', 'should', 'be', 'better', 'that.In', '34', 'Ender', 'Game', '34', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'damn', 'perfect', 'was', 'surprising', 'hour', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'overtaken', 'wave', 'boredom', 'had', ""n't"", 'paid', 'five', 'dollars', 'see', 'high', 'definition', 'would', 'have', 'switched', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'story', 'sustain', 'interest', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'believe', 'situation', 'what', 'worse', 'did', ""n't"", 'care.The', 'real', 'point', 'plot', 'not', 'training', 'little', 'kids', 'be', 'soldiers', 'morality', 'genocide', 'Personally', 'theme', 'egg', 'Who', 'aliens', 'Kill', 'OK', 'Card', 'elicit', 'emotional', 'response', 'having', 'old', 'switcheroo', 'final', 'reel', 'nasty', 'aliens', 'who', 'thought', 'had', 'tried', 'kill', 'were', 'really', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'bugs', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'communicate', 'Ender', 'feels', 'real', 'bad', 'killed', 'them.When', 'read', 'book', 'emotional', 'climax', 'left', 'cold', 'When', 'saw', 'scene', 'played', 'out', 'screen', 'last', 'night', 'also', 'left', 'cold', 'was', 'too', 'flat', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'alien', 'bugs', 'few', 'heavily', 'excerpted', 'flashbacks', 'never', 'saw', 'person', 'just', 'space', 'ships', 'were', 'never', 'given', 'reason', 'love', 'hate', 'so', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'wiped', 'out', 'need', 'new', 'plots', 'need', 'more', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'endorse', 'alien', 'species', 'genocide', '34', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '34', 'Most', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'recently', 'have', 'endorsed', 'genocide', 'humans', 'e.g', 'Avatar', 'Here', 'California', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'genocide', 'Delta', 'Smelt', 'have', 'been', 'fed', 'tripe', 'horrors', 'species', 'elimination', 'have', 'lost', 'own', 'will', 'survive']",N/A

1556124,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B008JFUNHI,Ranny Levy,"[0, 1]","&#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; adapted from the worldwide best selling book by Orson Scott Card is a must see event. 50 years after an alien race tried to colonize earth and millions of lives were lost, the International Military continue to strengthen their forces in hopes to prevent and eliminate any possibility of future attacks. Young children are enlisted in a program that trains them to fight and learn strategies through intensive studies and video-game like activities. The best of the best are then sent off to boot camp in space to be trained to lead and fight in the military. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is an extremely gifted boy who is recruited by Colonel Gaff (Harrison Ford). Gaff believes that Ender might be the only hope left for the human race and intends to train him to lead the International Military. Will the fate of the entire earth be too much for young Ender to cope with?I am absolutely in love with this film. Not only is it visually breathtaking in Imax, but it has so many emotional layers that touch on an abundance of issues that surface in our society. First off, the cinematography and CGI is absolutely flawless. I love the design of the Space Camp where the recruits are trained. I also thinks it&#8217;s cool that although &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; is very futuristic, they didn&#8217;t go overboard with the advanced technology which makes it seem as if these could be things we could see in the future. I really like the fact that there is no obvious makeup on the child actors. Since they are only children and are playing children in the film, the makeup artists kept them natural looking and allows their blemishes to be shown which is something you don&#8217;t typically see.This film is so emotionally intense. I honestly was speechless once the film was over. &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; is 2 hours long and I could have sat in that theater for several hours more. One thing that really stood out to me is that this film touches on the topic of sending children off to war and the detrimental effect it has on their emotions. This is a serious issue in our society today because, even though we aren&#8217;t sending 12-year-olds off to war, so many of our troops are fresh out of high school and are in no way ready for what they are about to face. This film shows how the effects of war and violence weigh on the children and how they are broken down and built back up into people lacking empathy and emotional stability. It was brought up a lot that if these kids even come home alive, there isn&#8217;t much left of them. Another issue that is prevalent in our culture that is also addressed in this film is the fact that realistic, violent video games are completely desensitizing our generation to the very real issues of violence in our world today. In the movie, the kids are trained by &#8220;playing&#8221; several different war games -from contact strategies on teams, to video game-like exercises that test their ability to control a space fleet. They are playing these &#8220;games&#8221; and not being able to fully understand how what they&#8217;re doing will affect others. I also really enjoy the fact that so many different cultures are represented in this movie. A lot of times we just see films that are centered around the U.S. and our own customs but, &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; really shows how all cultures and ethnic backgrounds are affected in these ways.I like so many characters in this film that it&#8217;s hard to pick out one favorite. I obviously loved Asa Butterfield's character, Ender, because he does a ridiculously outstanding job of portraying the complexity of his character. Ender is going through extremely rigorous training that pushes him both physically and emotionally and he has to deal with his own issues of being either too empathetic or too quick to violence. I also really love Bonzo, played by Moises Arias, because I think Moses is a fantastic actor and I&#8217;ve only ever seen him in more comedic roles. To see him play such an intense role is really powerful. This film also has some other fantastic young actors such as Abigail Breslin, Hailee Steinfeld, Aramis Knight as well as incredible adult actors such as Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Overall this film has an outstanding cast and characters.I give &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; 5 out of 5 stars because I feel like words can&#8217;t describe this film. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It entertained me while also getting me to think about real world issues. I do however recommend this film for ages 13 to 18. This film is very intense emotionally and visually. There is quite a bit of violence and even though it isn&#8217;t over-the-top gory, it is very realistic. This film left a big impact on me emotionally and younger children may not be able to handle that type of intensity. But if you are over the age of 13, I strongly recommend it even if you aren&#8217;t necessarily into sci-fi or futuristic films. &#34;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; has so many layers that there is something for everyone, So head to your local theater because &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; is showing in Imax and 3D now!Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST!

Of course this Biblical verse (used in the movie and the book of the same title) is twisted a bit as the correct interpretation is that a child will lead in a harmonious, not a warlike, way. I think teens and tweens will love this movie if the audience in the theater today was any indication. Adults may find it objectionable that children are manipulated by adults into an army to fight an alien force. Actually I found it to be quite an intriguing and thought provoking concept. The children are selected based on their computer prowess and intelligence, and we may find someday in the not too distant future - when wars become almost completely computerized - that children (teens) are better suited as this type of &#34;soldier&#34;. All that aside, I found this to be a fine sci/fi actioner, with an excellent story and stunning computer based special effects. Both the adult and child actors perform superbly, with a standout performance by Asa Butterfield as Ender. Also look for top notch performances by child actors, Hailee Steinfeld as Ender's top assistant and friend, Petra; and Abigail Breslin as Ender's sister.

I remember amazing conversations between the two siblings and a whole thing about internet forums.

There's far too much reiteration of simply how Ender is their savior, or perfect, or some other ""established"" nonsense.

The person I was with who'd never read the book was also completely lost for most of the film.Oh, and they made it into micro gravity velocity within, what, 20 seconds?  More B.S. orbital mechanics in Hollywood films, I guess.  Not even Gravity could escape that problem.Still probably worth seeing for fans of the book, but I'd recommend a matin&eacute;e showing or waiting for streaming or disk.And avoid the pointless 2k IMAX version.  That's correct: just a 2K 24fps interpositive and no 3D.3D and additional length would have helped the film, in spite of the sometimes bland delivery.  A much longer, less-tight director's cut, with stereoscopic 48fps (no problem for the CGI) for some later digital copy release would be welcome.

Although it attempted to stay true to the novel by Orson Scott Card (who was also one of the producers of this movie), I felt that because it left out one of Ender&#8217;s major character development &#8211; you didn&#8217;t get a sense as to the intense transformation he endured at the hands of the Battle School process.  For instance, Ender is much younger in the novel than he is portrayed in the movie.  This made a difference for me because with the novel you saw how the development of a child&#8217;s brain was being altered so that he could grow to become more than a homicidal killer, but an antisocial leader capable of extreme destruction for the &#8220;greater good&#8221;.  That is the major premise of the novel, but the movie missed this mark.In the novel, you both empathized and feared Ender&#8217;s capability.  In the movie, I mostly just felt sorry for him.  The boy&#8217;s he killed had never been accidental, but in the movie he only killed one boy (by accident) and the other boy, he simply stopped.  Again, the character in the movie looked to be in his early teens.  Ender killed the first boy when he was seven years old; this makes a huge difference in that Ender&#8217;s capacity for violence seemed to be at the hands of the Battle School and not a part of Ender in the movie (which was just not so).All in all, it was a good movie.  It did what it intended to do, it entertained.  However, if you&#8217;re going to make a &#8220;thinking man&#8217;s&#8221; Sci-Fi, then commit to it.

One failing is that the characters of Alai, Bean, and Petra are almost one dimensional despite there being so much more detail in Cards books.  There is no feeling that Bean was actually Enders fall back if he had chosen not to return.I have no real issue with minimizing the brutality of older brother Peter since that contributes little to furthering the plot.  (He was essentially a sociopath in the books.)Time constraints should never dominate a movie as it obviously did here.  An additional fifteen or twenty minutes would have done so much to elevate this movie.  Besides leaving the supporting student cast in the dust there really should have been one more battle sequence with Dragon Squadron.  They essentially leapt from last place to first based on one victory.  There was no explanation as to how they got to the middle ranking, it just happened.  It is probably too much to ask for to hope there is a battle training scene somewhere on the cutting room floor.  The strategy used by Ender and Bean are both important.  There is no indication as to why Ender should leave the mopping up details to Bean and there is a reason.Finally, there was no reason to completely ignore the effects of relativistic flight.  Mazer was called an old man, there was one mention of an ansible without explanation.  This effectively closed the door on future movies in the series.  Mazer was almost the same physical age as during the Formic war.  Ender will become the Speaker for the Dead because he spends so much time not aging through his travels.  Why slam the door before the movie was released?A minor point about the commentary...commentary is most effective when you can listen to it and the movie at the same time.  Not here.Enders Game is the one Sci Fi book I have read six or so times.  I have read the entire series at least twice straight through.  The movie is fine, but could and should have been great.  As with many movies it is difficult to pick up detail on a TV screen.  Apparently no designers ever consider that dark colors wash out detail on a smaller screen.  At least the sound was not overpowering so you could get all the audible detail.",4,Wishing for another fifteen minutes!,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,2244,"['Enders', 'Game', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'missed', 'numbers', 'reasons', 'One', 'failing', 'characters', 'Alai', 'Bean', 'Petra', 'are', 'almost', 'one', 'dimensional', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'Cards', 'books', 'feeling', 'Bean', 'was', 'actually', 'Enders', 'fall', 'back', 'had', 'chosen', 'not', 'return.I', 'have', 'real', 'issue', 'minimizing', 'brutality', 'older', 'brother', 'Peter', 'little', 'furthering', 'plot', 'was', 'essentially', 'sociopath', 'books', 'Time', 'constraints', 'should', 'never', 'dominate', 'movie', 'obviously', 'did', 'here', 'additional', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'elevate', 'movie', 'leaving', 'supporting', 'student', 'cast', 'dust', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'more', 'battle', 'sequence', 'Dragon', 'Squadron', 'essentially', 'leapt', 'last', 'place', 'first', 'based', 'one', 'victory', 'was', 'explanation', 'how', 'got', 'middle', 'ranking', 'just', 'happened', 'probably', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'hope', 'battle', 'training', 'scene', 'somewhere', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'strategy', 'used', 'Ender', 'Bean', 'are', 'important', 'indication', 'why', 'Ender', 'should', 'leave', 'mopping', 'up', 'details', 'Bean', 'reason.Finally', 'was', 'reason', 'completely', 'ignore', 'effects', 'relativistic', 'flight', 'Mazer', 'was', 'called', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'one', 'mention', 'ansible', 'explanation', 'effectively', 'closed', 'door', 'future', 'movies', 'series', 'Mazer', 'was', 'almost', 'same', 'physical', 'age', 'Formic', 'war', 'Ender', 'will', 'become', 'Speaker', 'Dead', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'not', 'aging', 'travels', 'Why', 'slam', 'door', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'minor', 'point', 'commentary', 'commentary', 'most', 'effective', 'when', 'can', 'listen', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'Not', 'here.Enders', 'Game', 'one', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'book', 'have', 'read', 'six', 'so', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'entire', 'series', 'least', 'twice', 'straight', 'movie', 'fine', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'many', 'movies', 'difficult', 'pick', 'up', 'detail', 'TV', 'screen', 'Apparently', 'designers', 'ever', 'consider', 'dark', 'colors', 'wash', 'out', 'detail', 'smaller', 'screen', 'least', 'sound', 'was', 'not', 'overpowering', 'could', 'get', 'audible', 'detail']",N/A

1556153,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B008JFUNHI,Robert Badgley,"[1, 2]","Ender's Game(released Oct/13)stars,among others,  Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, Hailee Steinfeld, Viola Davis, Abigail Breslinand  Ben Kingsley.This Sci-Fi adventure of young teens is a pleasing,fast moving and well played film by all concerned.The &#34;hero&#34; that all cadets in training try to emulate is called Mazer Rackham.It's just,to me,a mix up of Occum's Razor,which is to solve problems succinctly.This is exactly what our lead character does and which makes the film so compelling.The story finds the Earth in 2136,which went through a terrible battle 50 years before.It barely managed to win a war against an ant like species called the Formic.The hero of that battle is the aforementioned Mazer Rackham.Since that time families usually submit their off spring to training camps so that the Earth may be properly prepared for the inevitable next battle.&#34;Ender&#34; Wiggins is just such a trainee.His brother and sister have already washed out of the program,but he shows extraordinary potential. The trainee's commander Col.Graff(Ford),sees the Earth's saviour in him but knows he must bring him along carefully.After &#34;removing&#34; him from training school to judge his reaction,he is accepted and sent aloft to an orbital facility above the Earth.In his class he stands out and is eventually graduated to a higher level of cadets,the Salamanders.Its gung-ho leader is not too thrilled at his being there and friction develops immediately.In games Ender of course excels.Graff recognizing his ever accumulating abilities, promotes Ender to lead a rag tag outfit &#34;like himself&#34;,called the Dragons.The group is made of of former class mates that he has already bonded with.After a surprisingly tactical win in zero gravity against two other teams,Ender is confronted in the shower by the Salamander leader.It ends up with the leader unconscious on the floor and Ender wanting to quit the program.Ender ends up back on Earth in seclusion.Ender's beloved sister Valentine comes to him and in the end Ender realizes his place is &#34;up there&#34;.Now back in the program,Graf does not waste any more time and sends Ender and his group to a former Formic colony light years away.Here,surprisingly,he meets up with Mazer Rackham,who is very much alive and becomes his teacher.Battle simulation follows battle simulation and in the next to final simulation Ender and his group lose.Next day comes the final &#34;battle&#34; for graduation.All are tense.Ender's first attack on the Formic home world fleet is a success.But nearer the surface the Formics are swarming for an all out offensive.As they attack Ender surrounds their formidable molecular weapon with his drone ships,sacrificing thousands of personnel on other unprotected ships to allow it to get close enough to the home planet in order to fire on it.Once done,the entire planet is destroyed.It is not to long after the battle has been won that Ender and his crew find out they were actually fighting the Formic.Ender takes his loss of crewmen,ships and the destruction of an entire species to heart.He resigns right then and there.Back in his room on the former Formic colony he looks out to see a destroyed building which had appeared earlier in a simulated game.He goes out and investigates,and meets the last surviving Formic queen.All along Ender has had some kind of psychic connection with the Formic.The queen is dying and there before him is her last egg.Ender tearfully vows to find the baby queen a new home to colonize.As the film ends Ender is dictating a letter to his sister that he has been promoted to Admiral and is searching the known universe for a home for the Formic.The film is well paced with plenty of action. What is especially compelling is the interaction amongst the cadet themselves.It all rings true:the rivalry and jealousy between Ender and other cadets and Ender's  command of tactics,yet awkwardness at his interaction with another cadet female whom he takes a shine to.Ford is on game,and while Kingsley doesn't have a long part,his time on screen is likewise well spent and full of tension.When the final day comes,not only is Ender fooled but we as viewers are also.This film has it all and I liked what I saw.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary and,the trailer and deleted and extended scenes.All in all I liked this film from beginning to end.It flows well and the acting is top notch.The interaction between peers is typical of what we are as humans,and though it has been handled sloppily in other films,here it is handled with just the right touch.In a neat twist,this is a battle of survival done at a distance:very clean,precise and cold.I think you will like this film too.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,"""Its the WAY you win that's important""",1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,4793,"['Ender', 'Game', 'released', 'Oct/13',

The idea of transferring computer game skills to actual combat situations is intriguing.  But the plot itself is wobbly.  If this movie is trying to say something, I'm lost on what it is. Apparently the earth is or recently was under attack and is still at risk. Many were killed. Now they are recruiting the brightest children they have on earth to train to fight the invaders. Whether they are doing this because they don't have enough intelligent adults left is unknown. It is kind of an odd premise, considering how young and immature these kids are emotionally, as is very clear, though they may have above average intelligence and/or computer skills.  Ender Wiggin is apparently considered a genius and they want him to command their fleet against the enemy invaders to save the world.  Ender is a competent if not ingenious strategist, but he's also still a boy with feelings for his family and his friends.  The military encourages the boys to see each other as competition, not friends, which is odd because if anything the military in real life tries to build a sense of comaraderie among soldiers, who need to depend on each other in combat situations. Yet the major, who may be a psychologist, but whether she is, is not made clear, says they don't want Ender to think he can depend on others for help.  It's as though they are trying to turn him into a robot, without feelings or caring, in the belief that if they can do that, he would be more effective. That makes no sense at all.  The technological skill this future Earth society seems to possess would enable them to make robots and use them in combat or even for command if that was what they needed.  Society does tend to teach people, especially boys, to be stoic and not have feelings, and that's one way society creates mental illness in people, including and especially soldiers. So while the conflict is an intriguing one, the way Ender's mind is being manipulated is not unlike the way the minds of children are manipulated from birth onward - i.e. don't feel because feelings will cause you problems. Ender fights it but succumbs to save the world. What is the message or purpose in this?

It was successful enough, in fact, that the author then turned it into a full-blown novel and then series of novels. I read all of these at the time, so I was naturally very interested in seeing how this fascinating story adapts to the big screen.The good news is that this movie represents an excellent adaptation of the novel. The script wisely shortens certain components of the novel and makes a few changes to the story, but these are minor and largely necessary. Harrison Ford is absolutely perfect as Colonel Graff, and young Asa Butterfield pulls off the Ender role very well. The supporting cast of young actors similarly does well.About my only criticism of the movie is that I think that it could have been done better had it been longer. The time at Battle School is significantly truncated and has a rushed feel to it. On the other hand the Command School sequence is even more detailed than the novel. Mazr Rackham is portrayed well here, but could have been developed even more.Overall, this film makes for excellent entertainment and is worthy of a five-star rating. By the way the special effects are excellent here but do not overpower the storyline as is too common these days. The scenes of fleets and battles is excellent, as is the portrayal of Battle School.This film is one that science fiction aficionados will return to many times.

Carpenter,"[1, 3]","Enders Game is one of my favorite SciFi books, and could easily be one of the best books of that genre ever written.I didn't expect that the movie would be able to capture the whole story, but I was hoping that they would at least stay true to the basic conflict in the story.The first problem I saw was that the actor playing Ender was taller than almost any of the other 'children'. A crucial part of his character relates to his small size (due to his youth) and the issues that causes when he's around older kids.Second, I know it's a trope, but there were at least two times they needed to do a montage to show the passage of time. The first when he was training as a launch, and second with Dragon army.If you didn't know the story, you would think he one a single battle as a soldier, was made leader of his own army, won a battle there and immediately went to Command School.Since they did show a montage there, for all his simulated 'training' battles, I know they weren't against it in principle, or another mechanism could have been used instead. The key is that the character of Ender is completely different because it looks like he's just a super-genius that get's everything he want's right off the bat... Completely the opposite of the real story.It seems mind boggling to me that the producers would pay for Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley, and then go with a 3rd rate script, but that's exactly what happened.People who have read the book will find this move very frustrating.

Given that book-to-film adaptations tend to suck, I watched this movie with modest expectations, so I wasn't too disappointed.  As a film, it's quite respectable (the main themes are all there), but it falls far short of the book.  I understand that much of the original material had to be condensed for the film, but I thought too much was cut out.  Valentine and Peter's roles were drastically reduced (Peter's role is almost non-existent), but I get that - this allows the film to focus on Ender.  I felt that Ender's time in Battle School and Command School was far too condensed.  In the book, Ender spends years in Battle School, and the members of Dragon Army grow to respect and love him.  The film doesn't develop Ender's relationships with his fellow launchies enough.  The movie would have been much better had it been 10 minutes longer.

Hurt but only when necessary, a smart strategist, but not a killer -- as they wanted him to be -- but a compassionate soldier.  He kept his compassion to himself.  Even when confronted at all odds, he didn't back down but tried to figure it all out.The family thing was skipped entirely from the book.  His brother and sister had a blog and was very political in nature and this was cut out.  Also his brother was not well developed at all.  I had no care for the movie version.  The sister, she was a bit better developed but I didn't care there either.As in the book, the film version of the ending was great.  I won't spoil it, but when I first read this ending I was amazed.

1556210,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B008JFUNHI,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[2, 3]","The main villain doesn't appear until the last 5 minutes of the film, post battle, so nobody is in jeopardy. The villain is supposed to power the story so no villain, no engine, no world-saving work for the hero to do. No one subjecting innocent people to bad things, no threat, no one to worry about, no scary character to impress or frighten the audience.The story then is Ender's schooling. He's a sympathetic enough character relentlessly bullied as he is, but he doesn't really do much: with no villain he has nothing to do beyond competently dispatching his bullies. While a challenge for Ender, his bullies aren't exactly a world threat and so can't replace the missing primary villain and the work the villain does in the story.The training game the film focuses on doesn't seem that difficult to me, and when Ender actually organizes the attack at the story's conclusion, he's just directing other characters, sort of like old Star Trek episodes where Captain Kirk tells Mr. Sulu or Scotty what to do.Acting was solid, Harrison Ford sold Ender as ""the one"" but story itself didn't show him to be the one; it was more the characters kept agreeing that Ender was the one, but with no villain, the story itself had no way to prove to the audience that Ender is the hero.Casting was overly traditional, wished they'd have cast Ender as female or a minority or the Harrison Ford character as a minority or female. As shot, we have same old, same old: caucasian male power players surrounded by female and minority secondary characters, even down to the african american bark-is-worse-than-his-bite sergeant. Maybe Hollywood will be this way until females and minorities can green light a film, though you'd think that could happen by now.Also, the storytellers didn't create a believable world. Having the Harrison Ford character just show up at Ender's family home and inform Ender's parents that he was taking Ender did not work for me. Such behavior definitely needed to be supported/explained in the story as in the real world such behavior by a government official would not be acceptable. Writer needed to show a world where such governmental over-reaching is prevalent, the norm: this is really important (otherwise the audience stays outside the story as the story world has no correlation to the audience's world) and needed to be set up in the story before Ender was taken.The story didn't show the devastation of the attacks on Earth: Ender's family home and neighborhood looked fine.And the way the other kids bully Ender does not suggest that Earth is under threat.  If Earth was at the point of being destroyed, would the bullying behavior we witness Ender endure at nearly every level of his education be as prevalent? Don't think so. Kids would know there'd be no time for such nonsense, they'd be too terrified.  Writer figured a way to make Ender sympathetic by having him victimized, but the excessive bullying isn't believable in a world where people supposedly live in real fear of alien attack. In other words, teenagers living on a planet that was actually being attacked by aliens would not act as the bullies did towards Ender. If the writer wanted us to buy their behavior, he needed to do alot more work giving us the reason for it. Jealousy and competition, the reasons the writer give here to explain the bullying, don't work when a species is under attack and facing destruction. A planet where millions and millions have been killed, as the voiceover says here, is a world in chaos and disrepair. Such excessive bullying for the reasons given just don't mesh with what's supposed to be happening in the story.A kid fending off multiple bullies is a sympathetic character and a good start, but with no villain, and a poorly set up and executed story reality, the movie fails to emotionally engage us except that we feel sorry for Ender, but our pity does not a story make.

1556225,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B008JFUNHI,Steven Aldersley,"[581, 612]","I'm a big reader of science fiction, and Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series is probably my favorite. The only things that come close are Hyperion by Dan Simmons and Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. I've read Ender's Game more than 10 times, including two or three occasions on which I finished it in a single sitting. One of my college papers is based on the novel and is published on Card's website.Yes, I'm a fan.So, as you can imagine, I have been looking forward to an Ender's Game movie long before I ever thought it might happen. For me, it had the potential to be the best science fiction movie ever made, if done well. After assembling a strong cast, my expectations could not have been higher as I sat down to watch the IMAX version today.The basic premise is that an alien race, known as the Formics or Buggers, invaded Earth fifty years ago. The invading fleet was defeated, but another attack is expected. In order to be ready to face a species that learns from its mistakes, the International Fleet has come up with a strategy: A program was established to observe the behavior of young children, hoping that the best young geniuses of the time would be able to become the top military strategists by the time they were needed. Ender Wiggin was chosen as one of the trainees.The movie deviates considerably from the book, but it's necessary. I am not here to tell you why the book is better, I'm here to tell you whether Ender's Game works as a movie. However, I must explain some of the key differences. In the book, Ender begins his training at the age of six, while all of the trainees in the movie appear to be 15 or older. I understand that it would be impossible to find dozens of 6-year-old actors capable of carrying this story. Also, the sequence of events is different. Bean, who is a key character, meets Ender immediately, rather than a few years into his training. Ender's training is supposed to take around eight years, but it seems to happen in months.The biggest weakness of the movie is the way the battle training is condensed. Again, I realize that few people would want to watch four hours of training, but some of the suspense is missing because so little time is devoted to key events. Some events in the book seem unfair to Ender, but without the background information, anyone who hasn't read the book will miss the significance. Whenever I read Ender's Game, I become Ender Wiggin and experience the satisfaction of his achievements. I'm glad to say that I experienced similar feelings during the movie.IMDB claims that the movie is an action movie, but that's not the case. Don't go into this expecting battle sequences or laser fights. They do exist, but not in the form you might expect. I am actually impressed that Hollywood didn't ruin the movie by trying to include too much action.Ender's Game is essentially about leadership, and why individuals choose to follow certain people. Everyone in the school is a genius, but Ender is a good leader because he gains the trust, loyalty, and even love of his followers. The book is full of tactics, and we see Ender and his army discover and develop skills over the course of several years. The armies are comprised of 40 soldiers who are typically split into four Toons of 10 soldiers during battle. I doubt a casual viewer will come away from this movie even knowing what a Toon is. We certainly aren't shown how Ender's Dragon Army uses tactics that are completely new. On the plus side, the ending could not have been better, and I was excited to see an important scene present and handled well.So, does this movie work at all?As someone who knows all of the background to Ender's story, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it come alive on the big screen. The acting was good and the special effects spectacular, although my Kiwi friend reliably informs me that Ben Kingsley butchered the accent. Most of the key events in the book are touched upon, and a fan of the series will automatically catch the references and fill in the blanks. A complete newcomer to the story will probably have a good time, but come away wondering why Ender's Game is often regarded as the best science fiction book ever written.I hope that the movie will be successful enough to spawn a sequel. Speaker for the Dead is a much deeper story, and shows what happens to Ender after the war. However, with some people boycotting the movie due to their dislike of Card's politics, I'm not sure whether a sequel will be possible.I'll be adding Ender's Game to my collection as soon as it is released on Blu-ray, but it would be wrong of me to automatically give it 5/5 just because I love the books. That said, it's a good attempt to make a coherent story out of very difficult material. It's hard to show people thinking. If you do like the movie and haven't read the book, I urge you to do so. I imagine it would considerably enhance any future viewings.By the way, the trailer gives away almost everything.",4,My favorite science fiction book works reasonably well on the big

And I am very much aware that what works in a book often does not in a film, so a film version must play to it's strengths (I don't care who argues against the film versions of The Neverending Story or Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice, they used the film medium to tell INCREDIBLE alternate takes on their source material). No, the problems to be found here are something else altogether.If you've ever watched an anime TV show that was condensed into a film (Space Battleship Yamato Movies, Gundam:The Movie, Gurren Lagann Film 1) you will be familiar with this style of film. Unlike a masterful re-imagining of a tv series (Rin Taro's Galaxy Express 999, Mobile Suit Gundam Movie 3) you are getting everything including the kitchen sink crammed into a couple of hours, such that it all feels far too rapid and jarring. Nothing has time to breathe and soak in.To be sure, there are small failings that I can forgive. All the Battle School Kids are way too old. The banter with Graff and his co-administrator is replaced with bluster. The entire sub-plot with Valentine and Peter trying to take over the world is cut. But that's not what cuts this movie down several notches.Ender didn't just hurt other kids. He KILLED them. And it was quite brutal. While it could be argued that it was too much for the film, unfortunately it has the effect of also removing the emotional weight of the film. Combine this with plot twists that were ruined (&#34;The Invasion&#34; and what it REALLY meant), and relationships that lacked an depth, and numerous small details that pretty much sucked the soul out of the film (Ender's relationship with the Administrators of Battle School was much more removed, cold, and antagonistic in the book, all the adults were crying tears of joy after his final exam, Mazer commanded a &#34;ship&#34; not a jet, Ender NEVER lost a battle, [and perhaps most importantly] Ender wanted to come home to Earth but was sent into exile with Valentine joining him to roam at light-speed seemingly forever).Yeah, there's lots of things you could pick on, but what it all comes down to is that this film was poorly directed. It was too short by a third, focused on all the wrong details, and pretty much wasted an excellent cast. If you're going to create such an awesome Battle Room, the LEAST you can do it show a compilation of battles one after another, and enough battles to make it really exciting.This is not a bad film. It is not a train-wreck. It is simply a film that had a great story, a great cast, great special effects, and had the wrong director. As such it is simply a movie with almost unlimited wasted potential. The good news is that maybe FINALLY now that the ice is broken, someone will attempt to make a direct-to-tv version that tells the whole story the way it was meant to be (I'll even settle for an anime). Until that time, give this one a watch. Just rent it or check it out at the library. It's a waste to see in the theaters (especially since it would have REALLY benefited from 3D, and wasn't filmed that way).",3,A poorly directed adaptation makes for a somewhat entertaining film,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,3297,"['Having', 'seen', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'Miyazaki', 'Nausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'large', 'stories', 'condensed', 'down', 'few', 'hours', 'done', 'beautifully', 'excuse', '34', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'story', '34', 'will', 'accept', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'what', 'book', 'often', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'version', 'must', 'play', 'strengths', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'film', 'versions', 'Neverending', 'Story', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'used', 'film', 'medium', 'tell', 'INCREDIBLE', 'alternate', 'source', 'material', 'No', 'problems', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'something', 'else', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'anime', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'condensed', 'film', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'Movies', 'Gundam', 'Movie', 'Gurren', 'Lagann', 'Film', '1', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'style', 'film', 'masterful', 're-imagining', 'tv', 'series', 'Rin', 'Taro', 'Galaxy', 'Express', '999', 'Mobile', 'Suit', 'Gundam', 'Movie', '3', 'are', 'getting', 'everything', 'including', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'crammed', 'couple', 'hours', 'such', 'feels', 'far', 'too', 'rapid', 'jarring', 'Nothing', 'time', 'breathe', 'soak', 'in.To', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'small', 'failings', 'can', 'forgive', 'Battle', 'School', 'Kids', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'old', 'banter', 'Graff', 'co-administrator', 'replaced', 'bluster', 'entire', 'sub-plot', 'Valentine', 'Peter', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'cut', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'down', 'several', 'notches.Ender', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'hurt', 'other', 'kids', 'KILLED', 'was', 'quite', 'brutal', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'effect', 'also', 'removing', 'emotional', 'weight', 'film', 'Combine', 'plot', 'twists', 'were', 'ruined', '34', 'Invasion', '34', 'what', 'REALLY', 'meant', 'relationships', 'lacked', 'depth', 'numerous', 'small', 'details', 'pretty', 'much', 'sucked', 'soul', 'film', 'Ender', 'relationship', 'Administrators', 'Battle', 'School', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'removed', 'cold', 'antagonistic', 'book', 'adults', 'were', 'crying', 'tears', 'joy', 'final', 'exam', 'Mazer', 'commanded', '34', 'ship', '34', 'not', 'jet', 'Ender', 'NEVER', 'lost', 'battle', '[', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', ']', 'Ender', 'wanted', 'come', 'home', 'Earth', 'was', 'sent', 'exile', 'Valentine', 'joining', 'roam', 'light-speed', 'seemingly', 'forever', '.Yeah', 'lots', 'things', 'could', 'pick', 'what', 'down', 'film', 'was', 'poorly', 'directed', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'third', 'focused', 'wrong', 'details', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'excellent', 'cast', ""'re"", 'going', 'create', 'such', 'awesome', 'Battle', 'Room', 'LEAST', 'can', 'do', 'show', 'compilation', 'battles', 'one', 'enough', 'battles', 'make', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'not', 'train-wreck', 'simply', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'had', 'wrong', 'director', 'such', 'simply', 'movie', 'almost', 'unlimited', 'wasted', 'potential', 'good', 'news', 'maybe', 'FINALLY', 'now', 'ice', 'broken', 'someone', 'will', 'attempt', 'make', 'direct-to-tv', 'version', 'whole', 'story', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'be', ""'ll"", 'even', 'settle', 'anime', 'time', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'Just', 'rent', 'check', 'out', 'library', 'waste', 'see', 'theaters', 'especially', 'would', 'have', 'REALLY', 'benefited', '3D', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'way']",N/A

1556242,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B008JFUNHI,T. Briggs,"[0, 5]","Let me start by saying I did not like the book Ender&#8217;s Game.  It was 30 years ago and I found long drawn out action sequences as useless to storytelling then as I do now.  I don&#8217;t recall finishing the book because after a few hundred pages of such scenes I just got bored and put it down figuring someday I&#8217;d come back to it.  My bad.  Had I trudged through another 100 pages of the same scenes rewritten for another day I would have found a major payoff.  So this is truly a case where I can honestly say, for me, that the movie was better than the book.  I loved this film.I didn&#8217;t want to like it.  I hate supporting homophobes and fascists but art is art.  And as the film started I picked on a glaring illogic in which we are to believe that after losing &#8220;millions&#8221; of humans during the Formic wars there was apparently the type of ban on having more than 2 children that requires special permission.  Ender is a third.  It&#8217;s a mini story arc that doesn&#8217;t advance the story and so just seems useless and not adding anything to our understanding of Ender or in moving the story forward.My next dig was about the Formics themselves.  Bugs again?  Really?  Even in the 80&#8217;s it was somewhat of a clich&eacute;.  And I never understood why sci-fi writers insist on making aliens just larger versions of Earth critters.  Seriously.  There is a school of thought I subscribe to in which humanoids with hands and fingers make tools because they can but moths with wings and antennae don&#8217;t because they don&#8217;t have hands and fingers.  In other words when we do meet aliens they are more likely than not to more closely resemble us than frogs.  Frogs can&#8217;t drive.  Ants can build but they don&#8217;t have fingers so will never make tools which are necessary to building spacecraft.  And the common mistake of making the ant a 20 foot towering queen dragging a 2 ton ass around completely ignores the physical limitations of size.  You just can&#8217;t scale up ants and dogs to dinosaur size.  It takes a dinosaur s to get big not ants, it&#8217;s about body design, weight distribution, gravity and brain size.  Ok so enough for my lame critique.  The minute Ender is removed from his boot camp and sent to command school it gets real.  Well as real as an 11 year old fleet commander living on an alien world can be.But there&#8217;s something about Ender that makes me want to follow his life story and see where he goes.  It&#8217;s not just his brilliance but it&#8217;s his humanity and his understanding.  The film opens with a quote by Ender: &#8220;In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.&#8221;  And the film ends with the idea &#8220;it&#8217;s not enough to win, it&#8217;s how you win.&#8221;  And as he takes off in the final scene he wonders if he&#8217;ll be as good at peace as he was at war.

Some excellent and major life changes had forced me to put the site on a brief hiatus, but nothing will keep me away from the &#8220;critically&#8221; important task of telling all of you what I think about recent films!  So let&#8217;s get on with the show&#8230;Let me get this out of the way, I have not read Orson Scott Card&#8217;s 1985 novel, Ender&#8217;s Game.  This review does not reflect quality of adaptation but merely the merit of the film as it stands independent from the book.  That being said, Ender&#8217;s Game is intriguing enough and perhaps marks the start of a potentially strong franchise.Regardless of how you feel about Ender&#8217;s Game, it is nice to see Harrison Ford in space again.  Ford plays Colonel Hyrum Graff, a likely pun on the word &#8220;gruff&#8221; as his characters is certainly that.  Following the common tradition involving child protagonists, this is a film about the future.  Graff and his International Military seek out and train only the most promising children in his Battle School because only children have the potential to master the intricate &#8220;war games&#8221; necessary to protect Earth from a looming threat from an alien race known as the Formics.  The Formics nearly triumphed over the humans once before and every child grows up learning the story of Mazer Rackham, who sacrificed his life to destroy the mothership.  Now, the humans are preparing to take the offensive and eliminate the Formics forever.  Graff finds his golden child in the form of Ender Wiggins (Asa Butterfield), an introverted yet brilliant young recruit.Sacrifice is a pervasive theme in the film and it is dealt with in a very provocative way.  The title itself plays the title character&#8217;s surname within the colloquial term &#8220;End Game,&#8221; which suggests the notion of performing actions for the supposed greater good.  Thus, there is always a looming sense of distrust and darkness regarding the motives of Graff and his school.  Graff&#8217;s methods are harsh and borderline abusive.  However, this does keep the audience guessing and on edge throughout the perpetual &#8220;hazing&#8221; of Ender as he single handedly rises through the ranks despite tremendous adversity from his fellow recruits and superiors.Ender&#8217;s Game is a surprisingly bleak and dark look at humanity, but so it is with most good science fiction.  The main hurdle that the film struggles with is its unevenness in developing Ender&#8217;s time in Battle School and his relations with family and life on Earth.  The film makes a habit of glossing over details that could have made the film more character driven.  Instead, screenwriter/director Gavin Hood chooses to downplay characterization and simply toss archetypes into moral ambiguity with clever special effects, especially some of the &#8220;war game&#8221; scenes.  Nonetheless, the moral ambiguity that he does emphasize is palpable and the film&#8217;s premise is fascinating at times.Overall, Ender&#8217;s Game is a mixed bag.  It is dark and an interesting concept, but it wants to keep at least one foot in lighter territory in the hopes of appealing to a young audience.  The novel&#8217;s fan-base has been young-adult oriented &#8211; yet the novel debuted in 1985, resulting in a potentially wide audience appeal.

1556255,A1Y2GZGBMICFG8,B008JFUNHI,The Separator,"[5, 14]","For any film fanatic that also happens to be an Orson Scott Card fan, Ender&#8217;s Game was the type of film that warranted the hanging of a calendar on the wall and blacking out the days until the film's November 1st release date. I was this excited for months about the film, and yes, I saw it opening night. But after having seen it, I say with dismay that although the admission may not have been a total waste of money, it may have been better spent on a few drinks at a bar, or on a Shake Shack dinner (for the non- drinkers). I was just so unexpectedly un-enthralled that I&#8217;m still in shock.The film opens with Ender Wiggin as his parent&#8217;s third child in a world where thirds are not highly regarded, yet a prestigious military school&#8217;s administrators monitor Ender&#8217;s life via hidden cameras, and through this observation witness the potential genius within Ender. But whatever they notice, it is not shown to the audience.Nonetheless Ender leaves his family behind to study at this elite training school where plans are secretly being made; Ender will train to become the next great commander of the Earth fleet. While at battle school Ender meets the legendary Mazer Rackham, a famous Maori warrior whom singlehandedly defeated the aliens previously, when they attacked Earth. Rackham&#8217;s job now is to mentor Ender, to prepare him for the greatest battle of his life.Director Hood&#8217;s rendition of Ender&#8217;s Game does just adequate justice to the original plot of the book. I pined for a grittier, R-rated Prometheus or District 9-ish kind of rendition, and instead I got something related more to Will Smith&#8217;s Independence Day.There were no gaps left in the timeline of the film, gaps necessary to explain how Ender could possibly have become a fleet commander at all. As Director Hood portrays it, the audience sees Ender go from cadet to commander overnight, almost literally. No human past, present, or future, (not even Ender) could pull that off.Blas&eacute; scenes are followed by descriptions of grandeur that made me wonder if I had just watched the same scene as the military commanders. In front of a group of new recruits Ender is praised by Officer Graff (Harrison Ford) for his intelligence, a set-up for later peer torment? But the intelligence Ender shows here is hardly praiseworthy. It&#8217;s just a smart-alecky remark about zero gravity. Later, when Ender is confronted by a gang of boys, whom he ends up defeating, the fight is not convincing, yet again, administrators swoon. This type of device, apathetic scene followed by glorious praise occurs over and over throughout the film. Descriptions of awe are purveyed when no actual awe has taken place.Asa Butterfield's unmoving performance is largely responsible for the film&#8217;s failure. He is not a convincing Ender, and so all his examples of greatness seem staged. Every time Ender does something &#8220;miraculous&#8221; and is praised for it, it&#8217;s reminiscent of the medieval age; a king&#8217;s steward dolloping out praise at every instance to keep his majesty satisfied. Harrison Ford is also pretty terrible. Come to think of it, pretty much all the acting, except Ben Kinglsey&#8217;s is bad.Errata: Ender spends significant amounts of time whining about the administration blocking his email account. What does this have to do with the plot? Nothing. Since when do starships send and receive email? They don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s ansible technology in this world people! (machines capable of instantaneous or superluminal communication) Starships are way past &#8220;email.&#8221;Overall, I&#8217;d say Ender&#8217;s Game was only kind of bad, but it so totally not awesome.Get more reviews Getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",2,Most disappointing film of 2013,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,3766,"['film', 'fanatic', 'also', 'be', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'fan', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game', 'was', 'type', 'film', 'warranted', 'hanging', 'calendar', 'wall', 'blacking', 'out', 'days', 'film', 'November', '1st', 'release', 'date', 'was', 'excited', 'months', 'film', 'yes', 'saw', 'opening', 'night', 'having', 'seen', 'say', 'dismay', 'admission', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'waste', 'money', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'few', 'drinks', 'bar', 'Shake', 'Shack', 'dinner', 'non-', 'drinkers', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'unexpectedly', 'un-enthralled', '8217', 'm', 'still', 'shock.The', 'film', 'Ender', 'Wiggin', 'parent', '8217', 's', 'third', 'child', 'world', 'where', 'thirds', 'are', 'not', 'highly', 'regarded', 'yet', 'prestigious', 'military', 'school', '8217', 's', 'administrators', 'monitor', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'life', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'observation', 'witness', 'potential', 'genius', 'Ender', 'notice', 'not', 'shown', 'audience.Nonetheless', 'Ender', 'family', 'study', 'elite', 'training', 'school', 'where', 'plans', 'are', 'secretly', 'being', 'made', 'Ender', 'will', 'train', 'become', 'next', 'great', 'commander', 'Earth', 'fleet', 'battle', 'school', 'Ender', 'legendary', 'Mazer', 'Rackham', 'famous', 'Maori', 'warrior', 'whom', 'singlehandedly', 'defeated', 'aliens', 'previously', 'when', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'Rackham', '8217', 's', 'job', 'now', 'mentor', 'Ender', 'prepare', 'greatest', 'battle', 'life.Director', 'Hood', '8217', 's', 'rendition', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game', 'just', 'adequate', 'justice', 'original', 'plot', 'book', 'pined', 'grittier', 'R-rated', 'Prometheus', 'District', '9-ish', 'kind', 'rendition', 'instead', 'got', 'something', 'related', 'more', 'Will', 'Smith', '8217', 's', 'Independence', 'Day.There', 'were', 'gaps', 'left', 'timeline', 'film', 'gaps', 'necessary', 'explain', 'how', 'Ender', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'become', 'fleet', 'commander', 'Director', 'Hood', 'audience', 'Ender', 'go', 'cadet', 'commander', 'overnight', 'almost', 'literally', 'human', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'not', 'even', 'Ender', 'could', 'pull', 'off.Blas', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'are', 'followed', 'descriptions', 'grandeur', 'made', 'wonder', 'had', 'just', 'watched', 'same', 'scene', 'military', 'commanders', 'front', 'group', 'new', 'recruits', 'Ender', 'praised', 'Officer', 'Graff', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'intelligence', 'set-up', 'later', 'peer', 'torment', 'intelligence', 'Ender', 'shows', 'here', 'hardly', 'praiseworthy', '8217', 's', 'just', 'smart-alecky', 'remark', 'zero', 'gravity', 'Later', 'when', 'Ender', 'confronted', 'gang', 'boys', 'whom', 'up', 'defeating', 'fight', 'not', 'convincing', 'yet', 'again', 'administrators', 'swoon', 'type', 'device', 'apathetic', 'scene', 'followed', 'glorious', 'praise', 'film', 'Descriptions', 'awe', 'are', 'purveyed', 'when', 'actual', 'awe', 'taken', 'place.Asa', 'Butterfield', 'unmoving', 'performance', 'largely', 'responsible', 'film', '8217', 's', 'failure', 'not', 'convincing', 'Ender', 'so', 'examples', 'greatness', 'seem', 'staged', 'time', 'Ender', 'something', '8220', 'miraculous', '8221', 'praised', '8217', 'reminiscent', 'medieval', 'age', 'king', '8217', 'steward', 'dolloping', 'out', 'praise', 'instance', 'keep', 'majesty', 'satisfied', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'also', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Come', 'think', 'pretty', 'much', 'acting', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', '8217', 'bad.Errata', 'Ender', 'significant', 'amounts', 'time', 'whining', 'administration', 'blocking', 'email', 'account', 'What', 'have', 'do', 'plot', 'Nothing', 'when', 'do', 'starships', 'send', 'receive', 'email', 'don', '8217', '8217', 'ansible', 'technology', 'world', 'people', 'machines', 'capable', 'instantaneous', 'superluminal', 'communication', 'Starships', 'are', 'way', '8220', '8221', 'Overall', '8217', 'd', 'say', 'Ender', '8217', 's', 'Game', 'was', 'only', 'kind', 'bad', 'so', 'totally', 'not', 'awesome.Get', 'more', 'reviews', 'Getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",N/A

It was not revealed until the end that the battle was for real, instead of just being a game. This in and of itself was fine and I can understand the logic of doing so. But my lack of overwhelming enjoyment came from turning what could and should have been a joyous celebration into a personal agenda promoting the horror of genocide. We are led to believe at the end that an injustice was done and woe is me all the while fighting an enemy that had decimated the earth 70 years before. Now we must deal with the conclusion that somehow we did something wrong.This is one of the current prevailing trends in movies today.........directors take what could be an excellent movie and attempt to twist it around to suit their personal agenda and want to use it as a podium to promote their thoughts and views. While anyone is free to think what they want, please don't try to push it off on me through your directing. If you want to make some type of political statement, then do a documentary or something, not a movie and then twist the last 5 minutes and ruin everything.As a result of this, I watched two hours or so and enjoyed literally everything, got engaged with the character development, could empathize with Ender and then was let down and left empty at the conclusion.

1556262,A3LDFTSXU3UPBO,B008JFUNHI,Tim &#34;Timdiana&#34; Dunn,"[2, 5]","Anytime I hear that a movie based on novel hit theaters, I'm skeptic. Aside from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter or Hunger Games, bringing ""best-selling fantasy or sci-fi novels"" to the movies never goes well. Yet, that doesn't stop Hollywood making these films. So hitting theaters this weekend is Ender's Game: based on the novel by Orson Scott Card. This big time sci-fi movie featured a big time cast and effects; but could these elements make this novel-based film a must see?If you're like me, then you haven't read the Card's book.So in a case like this, you have to look at film's plot and how it works as a movie. With that said, this how the plot goes:  Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield) is a part of a military group that trains young minds to fight against the opposing alien force. Because of Ender's brilliance, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) takes a fast interest in the young cadets and see that Ender gets through the ranks so he can become the new hero of Earth.While I'm not sure how this film fairs in translating the novel, I have to say the story does work on the big screen. The only issue I had with the movie is the pacing. As soon as the film starts, Ender's is already an accomplished student. Before you know it he is assigned to fleet training, then he moves to Salamander Squad; and as you turn your head, Ender has is own team. It was hard to get a feel in Ender's progression because the plot was moving so quickly. That out of the way, the story itself was impressive. I liked the themes used in the film, such as the conflict of war and the harshness of training. It was a solid war game plot, despite that the film's story may not have followed the book word through word.Ender's Game feature an impressive looking cast; from young actors to veterans. As casts go, I enjoyed everyone. Asa Buterfield's performance as Ender was reasonable. He could have easily been a generic protagonist, but thanks to Buterfield, Ender was a brilliant cadet full of flaws and conflict.  Opposite to Buterfield was Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff. Ford has proven his worth over the years, but every time he steps into a sci-fi film, it's a treat. The same applies for this film as Ford plays a fully dimensional characer that you can understand and, at times, get behind. While actors like Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley even out the supporting characters, the real surprise came from the cadets. Sure these rookies didn't have loads of screen time, but their performances still worked and I found them just as intriguing as the A-list celebrities.Continuing my impressed feelings about this film, I found Ender's Game to be a technically sound film. Going in, I expected the film to have big effects, but I didn't think they would look as good as they did. Not everything was gorgeous though. There were a few CG shots that could have looked better. Yet, for the most part, the effects blended well with the overall design; making a nice looking film. Steve Jablonsky brought his style to the movie's score, but while I could here Jablonsky's familiar sounds, I thought his overall composing fit the sci-fi film.From the effects to the overall acting, Ender's Game had several great moments. If there were an scenes that stood out to me, it was the zero g training sequences. On several occasions, the cadets would compete against each other in this massive sphere with no gravity. The scenes were impressive by blending good effects with cool war game scenarios. It was like watching the Quidditch matches from the Harry Potter films; only on a bigger scale.When I walked into the theater, I wasn't expecting much from Ender's Game. In fact, I was certain that the movie was going to be a miss. How wrong I was. Ender's Game is a great looking movie that is well acted and has strong themes in its story. I don't know how well the movie translated the book, but for what it is , Ender's Games makes for a solid sci-fi film.See the Review here: [...]",4,Recieves the Medal of Surprise,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,3963,"['Anytime', 'hear', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'hit', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'skeptic', 'Aside', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'bringing', 'best-selling', 'fantasy', 'sci-fi', 'novels', 'movies', 'never', 'well', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'films', 'So', 'hitting', 'theaters', 'weekend', 'Ender', 'Game', 'based', 'novel', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'big', 'time', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'featured', 'big', 'time', 'cast', 'effects', 'could', 'elements', 'make', 'novel-based', 'film', 'must', 'see', ""'re"", 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Card', 'book.So', 'case', 'have', 'look', 'film', 'plot', 'how', 'movie', 'said', 'how', 'plot', 'Ender', 'Wiggen', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'part', 'military', 'group', 'young', 'minds', 'fight', 'opposing', 'alien', 'force', 'Ender', 'brilliance', 'Colonel', 'Graff', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'fast', 'interest', 'young', 'cadets', 'see', 'Ender', 'ranks', 'can', 'become', 'new', 'hero', 'Earth.While', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'film', 'translating', 'novel', 'have', 'say', 'story', 'work', 'big', 'screen', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'movie', 'pacing', 'As', 'soon', 'film', 'Ender', 'already', 'accomplished', 'student', 'know', 'assigned', 'fleet', 'training', 'then', 'Salamander', 'Squad', 'turn', 'head', 'Ender', 'own', 'team', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'feel', 'Ender', 'progression', 'plot', 'was', 'moving', 'so', 'quickly', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'impressive', 'liked', 'themes', 'used', 'film', 'such', 'conflict', 'war', 'harshness', 'training', 'was', 'solid', 'war', 'game', 'plot', 'film', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'followed', 'book', 'word', 'word.Ender', 'Game', 'feature', 'impressive', 'looking', 'cast', 'young', 'actors', 'veterans', 'casts', 'go', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'Asa', 'Buterfield', 'performance', 'Ender', 'was', 'reasonable', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'generic', 'protagonist', 'thanks', 'Buterfield', 'Ender', 'was', 'brilliant', 'cadet', 'full', 'flaws', 'conflict', 'Opposite', 'Buterfield', 'was', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Colonel', 'Graff', 'Ford', 'proven', 'worth', 'years', 'time', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'treat', 'same', 'applies', 'film', 'Ford', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'characer', 'can', 'understand', 'times', 'get', 'actors', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'even', 'out', 'supporting', 'characters', 'real', 'surprise', 'came', 'cadets', 'Sure', 'rookies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'loads', 'screen', 'time', 'performances', 'still', 'worked', 'found', 'just', 'as', 'intriguing', 'A-list', 'celebrities.Continuing', 'impressed', 'feelings', 'film', 'found', 'Ender', 'Game', 'be', 'technically', 'sound', 'film', 'Going', 'expected', 'film', 'have', 'big', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'Not', 'everything', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'were', 'few', 'CG', 'shots', 'could', 'have', 'looked', 'better', 'most', 'part', 'effects', 'blended', 'well', 'overall', 'design', 'making', 'nice', 'looking', 'film', 'Steve', 'Jablonsky', 'brought', 'style', 'movie', 'score', 'could', 'here', 'Jablonsky', 'familiar', 'sounds', 'thought', 'overall', 'composing', 'fit', 'sci-fi', 'film.From', 'effects', 'overall', 'acting', 'Ender', 'Game', 'had', 'several', 'great', 'moments', 'were', 'scenes', 'stood', 'out', 'was', 'zero', 'g', 'training', 'sequences', 'several', 'occasions', 'cadets', 'would', 'compete', 'other', 'massive', 'sphere', 'gravity', 'scenes', 'were', 'impressive', 'blending', 'good', 'effects', 'cool', 'war', 'game', 'scenarios', 'was', 'watching', 'Quidditch', 'matches', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'only', 'bigger', 'scale.When', 'walked', 'theater', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Ender', 'Game', 'fact', 'was', 'certain', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'miss', 'How', 'wrong', 'was', 'Ender', 'Game', 'great', 'looking', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'strong', 'themes', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'translated', 'book', 'what', 'Ender', 'Games', 'solid', 'sci-fi', 'film.See', 'Review', 'here', '[', ']']",N/A

1556266,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008JFUNHI,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","The Ender franchise has turned into such a global phenomena that now, most kids are required to read it in High School. I was one of those kids and I absolutely loved the story. In fact I continued on with the books and they became unbearably strange. How they got almost 20 novels out of it is beyond me. While I was really excited to finally see Ender's Game on the big screen, I knew the chances of it continuing past one film would be slim at best. It all has to do with the ending, which is bizarre and really shouldn't have been continued. For those who don't know the story, in the future, Earth is at war with an alien species known as the Formics. The Humans have taken heavy losses and in desperation have started a recruitment program, that focuses on children. Knowing that kids think in a different way than adults do, they are hoping to find that one genius who has the key to defeating the Formics. That child turns out to be Ender Wiggin, a child who under Earth's new Government, shouldn't have even been born. Seeing the story I read so many years ago, come to life on the big screen, was magical for me. Finally I was able to understand the parts that were just too confusing to see in my head and get the complete picture. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who somewhat miraculously, at the age of 15, has had the starring role in every film he's been in. After watching Ender's game it's not hard to see why, he was to this film, what Ender was to the Human's in the story. The producers surrounded him and his young crew with a cast of Academy Award winners including Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis, which ultimately strengthen the movie and must of really inspired this kid to give the performance he gave. While the film simply broken even at the box office, (killing any chance of a franchise developing out of it) it was very well done and closely mirrored the book. They did a near perfect job of deciding what parts should stay and what should be eliminated, giving us a film that was just as good as the book, if not better.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",2014,2069,"['Ender', 'franchise', 'turned', 'such', 'global', 'phenomena', 'now', 'most', 'kids', 'are', 'required', 'read', 'High', 'School', 'was', 'one', 'kids', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'story', 'fact', 'continued', 'books', 'became', 'unbearably', 'strange', 'How', 'got', 'almost', '20', 'novels', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'finally', 'see', 'Ender', 'Game', 'big', 'screen', 'knew', 'chances', 'continuing', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'slim', 'best', 'do', 'ending', 'bizarre', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'continued', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'future', 'Earth', 'war', 'alien', 'species', 'known', 'Formics', 'Humans', 'have', 'taken', 'heavy', 'losses', 'desperation', 'have', 'started', 'recruitment', 'program', 'children', 'Knowing', 'kids', 'think', 'different', 'way', 'adults', 'do', 'are', 'hoping', 'find', 'one', 'genius', 'who', 'key', 'defeating', 'Formics', 'child', 'out', 'be', 'Ender', 'Wiggin', 'child', 'who', 'Earth', 'new', 'Government', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'even', 'been', 'born', 'Seeing', 'story', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'come', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'magical', 'Finally', 'was', 'able', 'understand', 'parts', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'confusing', 'see', 'head', 'get', 'complete', 'picture', 'Ender', 'played', 'Asa', 'Butterfield', 'who', 'somewhat', 'miraculously', 'age', '15', 'had', 'starring', 'role', 'film', 'been', 'watching', 'Ender', 'game', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'film', 'what', 'Ender', 'was', 'Human', 'story', 'producers', 'surrounded', 'young', 'crew', 'cast', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winners', 'including', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'ultimately', 'strengthen', 'movie', 'must', 'really', 'inspired', 'kid', 'give', 'performance', 'gave', 'film', 'simply', 'broken', 'even', 'box', 'office', 'killing', 'chance', 'franchise', 'developing', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'closely', 'mirrored', 'book', 'did', 'near', 'perfect', 'job', 'deciding', 'what', 'parts', 'should', 'stay', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'eliminated', 'giving', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'not', 'better']",N/A

Keep in mind, yes there were some important elements that were left out and I did have to explain a couple of things to my husband and daughter since they were not explained well in the movie - i.e. what the significance of a third child means and why it's important.However, if they were to put all of the elements in the movie, it would either be over 4 hours long, or made into 2 movies. It could not be done. I would have preferred to see more with the battle room and how Ender formulated his strategies. But again, there is just not enough time to put everything into a 2 hour movie.With that said, I think they did a great job with the major points to the story. Some will disagree, especially with the sub plot of Valentine and the older brother (I can't remember the name at the moment), but again, not everything will fit into a 2 hour movie.

Just watching the inside of Starships and Battle School is enough for us to see that filmmakers took great care in creating them. It is regrettable that they failed to take care in telling the story that could have been much more thrilling and even thought-provoking.Asa Butterfield (Hugo of Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;Hugo&#8221;) plays Andrew &#34;Ender&#34; Wiggin, a young cadet sent to &#8220;Battle School&#8221; in outer space. Humans were attacked by the military forces of alien species (the Formics) fifty years ago, and International Fleet trains and tests the students on their ability to fight and command. The storyline is a bit similar to that of &#8220;Starship Troopers,&#8221; but director Gavin Hood (&#8220;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&#8221;) keeps the film violence-free.Despite the nice visuals and fine acting from the cast (including Harrison Ford as Colonel Hyrum Graff), &#8220;Ender&#8217;s Game&#8221; is not really emotionally involving, lacking any character development. The film&#8217;s story deals with topics like leadership, but the hero here manages to gain the respect of other students in a not very convincing way.In short, the film feels rushed.

1556277,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008JFUNHI,Turfseer,"[0, 2]","**This review may contain spoilers**Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0After watching 'Ender's Game' for the first five minutes and understanding the film's premise, my immediate reaction was 'Yikes!-- look's like I'm in for a long ride.' Yes I must confess that my initial impression that the premise was ludicrous, was borne out by the rest of the plot and attendant hokey character machinations. Why exactly does humanity choose to employ children to battle insect-like aliens (aka Formics) who attacked and almost successfully destroyed earth fifty years earlier? That's a good question for Orson Scott Card, the author of the original source material, who wrote the book (of the same title) which the movie is based on. It's an easier question for profit-hungry producers, who speculated that allowing prepubescent kids to act out their fantasies in what essentially is one monotonous video game on screen, would translate into mega-profits at the box office. At the end of the day, 'Ender's Game', only made a very small profit due to its reliance on a slew of computer generated effects.As for the Ender's plot, it revolves around a kid who has the same apocalyptic sounding name (does it mean he 'ends' the threat of the alien invasion or earth is at an end?) Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin (played by an overly intense Asa Butterfield), is a cadet who catches the eye of Commander Graff, who sees potential in the reserved and thoughtful twelve or thirteen year old. Graff is played by Harrison Ford who manages to be unpleasant throughout, barking orders at Ender and generally conforming to the script's call to play the boss as a boorish martinet.While in a regular training school, Ender gets into his first physical confrontation with classmate Stilson, after defeating him in a space ship simulation. He also impresses Graff's subordinate, Gwen Anderson, when he figures out how to defeat a giant troll-like creature in a 'mind game' program designed as a no-win scenario (the CGI-effects here, along with a later scene involving one of Ender's visions, are perhaps the best parts of the film).Ender then graduates to the much more fancy battle school where students fire laser guns at each other in a giant sphere dubbed the 'Battle Room' in a zero gravity atmosphere. Kids who love video games will probably find all of this endearing but for me, most of it reminded me of the typical dated paeans to military school cadet culture (here now with the students dressed up in spacesuits). When Ender is appointed the 'commander' of his own band of 'misfits' and defeats his former commander, Bonzo Madrid (no, not Bonzo the chimp!) in one of those battles inside the sphere, the second clich&eacute;d fight occurs between the two afterward, inside a shower room. Ender decides it's 'Bedtime for Bonzo' after he puts Madrid into a coma (again Commander Braff is impressed by Ender channeling his hardly utilized inner Rambo).Ender ends up being promoted to Commander of all forces and is transferred to a base of a former Formic colony. There he meets Rackham, the legendary commander who found the key to defeating the Formics in the epic battle fifty years ago. Ben Kingsley manages to out growl Harrison Ford, as another over aggressive mentor assisting the heralded lap dog, Ender (and yes, Kingsley's atrocious tattoos all over his face, are certainly not endearing at all). I have no guilt feelings about revealing the film's deus ex machina, so SUPER SPOILERS are ahead: the simulation that Ender (along with all of his pals from Battle School) engage in, which annihilates the Formic planet, was for real.Thus Graff turns out to be a true martinet, a stand-in for over-aggressive, right wing, American military types. Ender, however, feels horribly guilty about being duped into wiping out the Formics. He realizes that the earlier mind game scene he involves himself in, is right outside the base and after encountering a dying Formic Queen, he vows to take the Queen's egg and colonize a new world with it. Ender justifies his actions by claiming that the Formics attempted to communicate with him, before Graff and his minions did their 'dirty work'. The problem is the Formics did indeed try to destroy the earth's population but the film's scenarists provide no explanation as to the original reason for the invasion. Therefore, Ender's assumption that their attempt to communicate is not justification enough for him to save the Formic species. Ender is unable to refute Graff, who implicitly argues that any attempt to communicate could very well have been a ruse.Unfortunately, the idea of kids being put in charge of a fighting team in place of adults, seems to be an absurd conceit. And at a certain point, it isn't difficult to figure out that the filmmakers intentionally allowed Ender to take the moral high ground after he gets oh so 'touchy feely' with the that one last Formic egg (damning Graff for encouraging the kids' aggression, deceiving them but not explaining why he was wrong in the first place about the danger of another Formic invasion).There were a few moments here and there which were nicely done, particularly Ender's mind game where he encounters the Formics for the first time inside the castle that was destroyed during the initial invasion. But watching juveniles beat each other up or blast one another in simulated war games, was not my cup of tea. This despite the films' scenarists wishful thinking that killing is bad if you don't give a dangerous, former adversary, a chance to redeem themselves, in the face of the flimsiest of evidence. Others might dub all this 'liberalism run amok'; as for me I'll simply return this disc to Netflix as fast as possible and move on to something more worthwhile!",1,Battlestar Galactica meets Lord of

1556284,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B008JFUNHI,V. Berk,"[22, 25]","My friends and I have long wondered when Ender's Game would arrive on the silver screen.  In the stream of young adult fiction being adapted for the silver screen I always figured it was only a matter of time before Orson Scott Card's 1985 classic 'Ender's Game' received the Hollywood treatment.  While I don't think Gavin Hood's 2013 adaptation is going to win over many converts, nor do I think it will particularly anger fans.  For what it is I believe 2013's Ender's Game does the best it can within the confines of a 100 minute running time.I'd like to say right of the bat that it's been a few years since I read 'Ender's Game', but from what I remember the movie does a decent enough job summarizing the events of the novel.  There are some major omissions to be sure, but there isn't any alterations that made me feel the source material had been betrayed in any way.  Problems within the film arise from omissions, not flagrant disregard for the source.The casting feels spot on.  Asa Butterfield is a great Ender Wiggins and is a spot on representation of the kind of kid I imagined reading the book.  Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff more or less steals the show, reminding us of what a magnetic screen presence he's always been (although he's more or less just playing Harrison Ford) and Viola Davis as Major Anderson does work excellently well as his counterpart.  Ben Kingsley does a serviceable job, but has such little screen time that he doesn't really have a chance to establish his character.  Ender's siblings Valentine (Abigail Breslin) and Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) have such little presence that they might as well not exist (despite their significant roles in the book).  I can understand why these characters had their roles cut down so immensely for the sake of adaptation, but the film still has them referenced constantly, so their lack of development doesn't help you feel much for Ender's internal conflicts relating to his family.The main problem with Ender's Game is that it has so much story to tell in such a short span of time.  Certain plotlines are sped through, some are omitted entirely, and it just feels incredibly condensed.  If you haven't read the book I don't think you'll have time to develop much empathy for these characters, or get a grip of what's going on. Having read the book I was able to appreciate these scenes, but even then it felt lacking; like I was watching pieces of an unfinished whole.Do I think Ender's Game is a great or bad movie?  Neither.  It's an okay movie.  As a movie it doesn't really stand up on its own merits, so that limits its appeal to new audiences, and a movie should work on its own separate from its source.

The acting was good, the part of Ender played very well, the characters throughout believable.  Ford did a very good job as the Colonel.  One thing I enjoyed is that they avoided the &#34;Barbie Model&#34; cliche often found in such films.  Ender's friends are just normal-looking, everyday people-next-door.  His female friend wasn't a paper-thin ad for C.K... but rather a more believable military-cadet build.  I had to give a thumbs up to them on that.  Ben Kingsley played a good part, but unfortunately the tattoos more distracted from than added to the movie-- and I'm sure were a royal pain for him to endure in makeup each day.  The storyline was excellent and for me-- the climax highly effective.  This is one of those movies I would not mind seeing a second time-- which makes me wish we could award half stars. I'd give this 4 1/2 solid.  An excellent flick all the way around and well worth watching.

To say I'm disappointed is the understatement of the century.  Really, I'm just saddened.The entire movie was like reading the book in fast forward.  Problem with that, is they left out everything emotional in the book.  Remember how you felt when they pulled Ender from Dragon Army?  He asked Bean who was leading it.  Bean looked down at his hands and said: &#34;Me&#34;.  Remember when they gave Ender the Dragon Army, and they hammered him so hard that even you, as the reader, felt exhausted?  Remember how Ender and Dragon Army climbed the ranks?  Remember how hard and cold he'd gotten when floating on the raft, killing wasps with his bare fingers and talking about how the sharks learned to not bother him?Ugh.  I just want to throw my hands up in frustration.  The movie carried ZERO emotion.  If I hadn't read the book, I almost feel like I'd be lost trying to watch the movie.  The book made you FEEL everything.  In the movie, they had to TELL it.  What an epic disappointment.  I actually put off watching this for a long time because I was scared it would suck.  Sure wished I'd avoided it forever now.  They did an excellent job putting Lord of the Rings on the big screen.  Why ruin Ender's Game?  OSC produced it?
