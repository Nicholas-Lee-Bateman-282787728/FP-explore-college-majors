956869,A3C5ZZQ143WG6T,B000CCW2PW,Jenifer M,"[69, 70]","I was looking for an instructional striptease video - one that wasn't an aerobic workout.  I wanted to put on a show of my own - not get into shape.  ""The Art of Exotic Dance -- Striptease Series"" with Fawnia Mondey seemed right on target.Since I had accompanied my husband/boyfriend to several strip clubs over the years, I had a basic idea of what I wanted to accomplish.  (Thank goodness women are now welcome.)  I wanted to learn some moves - and maybe create a short routine - that I hoped to use for `special occasions' in my own home!As background, this video series is hosted by Fawnia Mondey (who goes by just ""Fawnia"") -- who lists as her credentials a dozen nude dance titles (such as Miss Canada's Rookie of the Year, or the North American Exotic Dance Champion).  She is also cute as a button - and just as in shape - as she appears on the video's cover.  (Darn her!)This episode also had a few other instructors.  One, `Athena,' also a former Penthouse dance contest champion, looks so much like Fawnia (just a bit thinner, younger and brunette) that she could probably pass for Fawnia's younger sister.The first demonstration, executed mostly topless, shows how to give a ""no touch"" lap dance performance, and how to use the ""tease"" to heighten the excitement, with views both front and back.The second lesson (also topless) gets a little hotter by adding in contact (with your ""customer"").  The segment starts with the dancer -- sitting first on the guy's lap - and then proceeding to brush her chest against his cheeks.  Many of the moves focus on rubbing yourself against him (by sitting in his lap, facing him or away) or by assuming various postures which bring portions of your body (breasts or butt, usually) closer to his face.Emotionally, the goal is to make the man feel welcome and special - by demonstrating how much you enjoy performing for him.  Expressing one's personality, according to Fawnia -- is also very important, and she gives numerous suggestions on how to accomplish this.Some of the lap dance lessons are actually filmed in a (closed) strip club, with the guy sitting in a chair as though he had just paid for his ""dance.""  One of the more exciting moves demonstrated -- was something called the ""spider"" where the dancer horizontally scissors the guy's face with her legs --and moves the lowest portion of her body teasingly in front of him.  Of course, bringing your own lips in close - will also make his blood run just as quickly to his head!In one of the more instructional portions of the video, Fawnia herself demonstrates various ways to remove a normal rear-clasp bra when viewed from the front or the back.  She then does the same with a front-clasp bra -- sometimes using her arms or hands to shield her breasts afterwards -- as a means of lengthening the reveal.She even shows how to remove your bikini (bottom) while standing or sitting (the latter done with the toes pointed), and also while lying on the floor (with the instructor achieving total nudity after each demonstration).The video finishes by demonstrating how to translate these same moves into an ""at home"" performance, one with Athena (who begins by removing her skirt), and several with Fawnia (who starts off one segment wearing - and then removing - her silk babydoll nighty).Ladies, if you've ever enjoyed a lap dance yourself -- you know just how utterly exciting and seductive this personal show can be!I should also point out -- of the three videos (Pole Work, Floor Work, and Lap Dancing), this lap dance episode is the only one in the series -- that offers any in depth instruction on the actual stripping off of one's garments.  It is also the only one that features any toplessness or nudity - so if your hubby wants to watch - this is the episode he'll find to be the most entertaining.  (The other two videos are strictly dance instruction - with very little undressing.)As my only nit, some of the earliest dance segments on the video were overly dark or yellow (in coloration).  Obviously, to capture the actual feel of the performances - these were filmed using only the existing light of the setting.  Unfortunately, no adjustments were made in the film type or in the white balance (of the video recorder) to compensate.The later segments of the video, filmed with more normal everyday lighting, were much more enjoyable.To conclude, if you're planning to buy any disc in the series - always buy this episode (lap dancing) first -- for its actual instruction on how to strip -- and for the numerous finishing moves it offers to help get your guy `over-the-top!'  Enjoy.",4,The sexiest in the series . . . and the most practical!,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",2007,4606,"['was', 'looking', 'instructional', 'striptease', 'video', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'aerobic', 'workout', 'wanted', 'put', 'show', 'own', 'not', 'get', 'shape', 'Art', 'Exotic', 'Dance', 'Striptease', 'Series', 'Fawnia', 'Mondey', 'seemed', 'right', 'target.Since', 'had', 'accompanied', 'husband/boyfriend', 'several', 'strip', 'clubs', 'years', 'had', 'basic', 'idea', 'what', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'women', 'are', 'now', 'welcome', 'wanted', 'learn', 'moves', 'maybe', 'create', 'short', 'routine', 'hoped', 'use', 'special', 'occasions', 'own', 'home', 'background', 'video', 'series', 'hosted', 'Fawnia', 'Mondey', 'who', 'just', 'Fawnia', 'who', 'credentials', 'dozen', 'nude', 'dance', 'titles', 'such', 'Miss', 'Canada', 'Rookie', 'Year', 'North', 'American', 'Exotic', 'Dance', 'Champion', 'also', 'cute', 'button', 'just', 'shape', 'video', 'cover', 'Darn', 'episode', 'also', 'had', 'few', 'other', 'instructors', 'One', 'Athena', 'also', 'former', 'Penthouse', 'dance', 'contest', 'champion', 'so', 'much', 'Fawnia', 'just', 'bit', 'thinner', 'younger', 'brunette', 'could', 'probably', 'pass', 'Fawnia', 'younger', 'sister.The', 'first', 'demonstration', 'executed', 'mostly', 'topless', 'how', 'give', 'touch', 'lap', 'dance', 'performance', 'how', 'use', 'tease', 'heighten', 'excitement', 'views', 'front', 'back.The', 'second', 'lesson', 'also', 'topless', 'little', 'hotter', 'adding', 'contact', 'customer', 'segment', 'dancer', 'sitting', 'first', 'guy', 'lap', 'then', 'proceeding', 'brush', 'chest', 'cheeks', 'Many', 'moves', 'focus', 'rubbing', 'sitting', 'lap', 'facing', 'away', 'assuming', 'various', 'postures', 'bring', 'portions', 'body', 'breasts', 'butt', 'usually', 'closer', 'face.Emotionally', 'goal', 'make', 'man', 'feel', 'welcome', 'special', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'performing', 'Expressing', 'one', 'personality', 'according', 'Fawnia', 'also', 'very', 'important', 'numerous', 'suggestions', 'how', 'accomplish', 'this.Some', 'lap', 'dance', 'lessons', 'are', 'actually', 'filmed', 'closed', 'strip', 'club', 'guy', 'sitting', 'chair', 'had', 'just', 'paid', 'dance', 'One', 'more', 'exciting', 'moves', 'demonstrated', 'was', 'something', 'called', 'spider', 'where', 'dancer', 'horizontally', 'guy', 'face', 'legs', 'lowest', 'portion', 'body', 'teasingly', 'front', 'course', 'bringing', 'own', 'lips', 'close', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'blood', 'run', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'head', 'one', 'more', 'instructional', 'portions', 'video', 'Fawnia', 'various', 'ways', 'remove', 'normal', 'rear-clasp', 'bra', 'when', 'viewed', 'front', 'back', 'then', 'same', 'front-clasp', 'bra', 'sometimes', 'using', 'arms', 'hands', 'shield', 'breasts', 'afterwards', 'means', 'lengthening', 'reveal.She', 'even', 'how', 'remove', 'bikini', 'bottom', 'standing', 'sitting', 'latter', 'done', 'toes', 'pointed', 'also', 'lying', 'floor', 'instructor', 'achieving', 'total', 'nudity', 'demonstration', 'video', 'finishes', 'demonstrating', 'how', 'translate', 'same', 'moves', 'home', 'performance', 'one', 'Athena', 'who', 'removing', 'skirt', 'several', 'Fawnia', 'who', 'one', 'segment', 'wearing', 'then', 'removing', 'silk', 'babydoll', 'nighty', '.Ladies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'enjoyed', 'lap', 'dance', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'utterly', 'exciting', 'seductive', 'personal', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'should', 'also', 'point', 'out', 'three', 'videos', 'Pole', 'Work', 'Floor', 'Work', 'Lap', 'Dancing', 'lap', 'dance', 'episode', 'only', 'one', 'series', 'depth', 'instruction', 'actual', 'stripping', 'one', 'garments', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'toplessness', 'nudity', 'so', 'hubby', 'watch', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'find', 'be', 'most', 'entertaining', 'other', 'two', 'videos', 'are', 'strictly', 'dance', 'instruction', 'very', 'little', 'undressing', 'only', 'nit', 'earliest', 'dance', 'segments', 'video', 'were', 'overly', 'dark', 'yellow', 'coloration', 'Obviously', 'capture', 'actual', 'feel', 'performances', 'were', 'filmed', 'using', 'only', 'existing', 'light', 'setting', 'Unfortunately', 'adjustments', 'were', 'made', 'film', 'type', 'white', 'balance', 'video', 'recorder', 'compensate.The', 'later', 'segments', 'video', 'filmed', 'more', 'normal', 'everyday', 'lighting', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable.To', 'conclude', ""'re"", 'planning', 'buy', 'disc', 'series', 'always', 'buy', 'episode', 'lap', 'dancing', 'first', 'actual', 'instruction', 'how', 'strip', 'numerous', 'finishing', 'moves', 'help', 'get', 'guy', 'over-the-top', 'Enjoy']",N/A
956870,A8A6QIW6PG508,B000CCW2PW,ND,"[1, 1]","From the high-end looking photography/graphics on the cover, I was expecting something professional. Unfortunately, this DVD does not deliver- there is no instruction on how to do any moves or really ""entertain your man"" and the production quality is poor -very grainy at times & bad lighting. The setting was not appealing either, at one point it looks like they are actually in a club with dingy looking walls & an old couch. On a good note-some of the other scenes are filmed in an apartment, with better lighting & atmosphere.From the title, you assume that you are going to learn how to lap dance for your man, unfortunately there is very little instruction to go on. They did include a chapter where you are shown how to remove your bra in about 6 ways, from back to front. It's very simple (un-snap it and cover your breasts or not) and they could have moved on. Other than that, it is pretty much you watching a real dancer perform different lap dances for a client in the club, and at home. There is a voice-over that gave general pointers & tips but most of the information seemed to be geared towards someone who is really looking to become an exotic dancer, not much information for the person who wants to dance for fun at home.Also want to add there is nudity (topless). Not a big deal, it was fine. It was relevant in what they were trying to convey but because of it, they needed to pay more attention to the way the material was presented. Poor lighting, atmosphere, and grainy film quality made it feel seedy, like you were getting ready to see some amateur porn- not learn a fun exotic dance routine.Sadly, I can't say I would recommend this DVD. I don't think there is really enough valuable information here based on what was offered.Just a note: I was looking around for pole dancing & exotic dance workshops around the country, when I found Fawnia's Pole Fitness Studio in Las Vegas. I saw video clips (well-done) on her & the classes offered there and it was great- very professional & put together. She is a great dancer. Since I can't make it to Nevada at this point, I thought I'd get a few of her dvds to try out. I was surprised at the low quality and lack of information. I do wish it was possible to have given them a better review. I still feel, despite my experience with the dvds, that she is a good performer & when I get the chance- I would take a class with her in person.",1,Not Really An Instructional - Poor Production Quality,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,2409,"['high-end', 'looking', 'photography/graphics', 'cover', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'professional', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'not', 'deliver-', 'instruction', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'really', 'entertain', 'man', 'production', 'quality', 'poor', '-very', 'grainy', 'times', 'bad', 'lighting', 'setting', 'was', 'not', 'appealing', 'either', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'actually', 'club', 'dingy', 'looking', 'walls', 'old', 'couch', 'good', 'note-some', 'other', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'apartment', 'better', 'lighting', 'title', 'assume', 'are', 'going', 'learn', 'how', 'lap', 'dance', 'man', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'little', 'instruction', 'go', 'did', 'include', 'chapter', 'where', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'remove', 'bra', 'about', '6', 'ways', 'back', 'front', 'very', 'simple', 'un-snap', 'cover', 'breasts', 'not', 'could', 'have', 'moved', 'Other', 'pretty', 'much', 'watching', 'real', 'dancer', 'perform', 'different', 'lap', 'dances', 'client', 'club', 'home', 'voice-over', 'gave', 'general', 'pointers', 'tips', 'most', 'information', 'seemed', 'be', 'geared', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'looking', 'become', 'exotic', 'dancer', 'not', 'much', 'information', 'person', 'who', 'dance', 'fun', 'home.Also', 'want', 'add', 'nudity', 'topless', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'relevant', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'convey', 'needed', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'way', 'material', 'was', 'presented', 'Poor', 'lighting', 'atmosphere', 'grainy', 'film', 'quality', 'made', 'feel', 'seedy', 'were', 'getting', 'ready', 'see', 'amateur', 'porn-', 'not', 'learn', 'fun', 'exotic', 'dance', 'routine.Sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'enough', 'valuable', 'information', 'here', 'based', 'what', 'was', 'offered.Just', 'note', 'was', 'looking', 'around', 'pole', 'dancing', 'exotic', 'dance', 'workshops', 'country', 'when', 'found', 'Fawnia', 'Pole', 'Fitness', 'Studio', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'saw', 'video', 'clips', 'well-done', 'classes', 'offered', 'there', 'was', 'great-', 'very', 'professional', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'dancer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'Nevada', 'point', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'few', 'dvds', 'try', 'out', 'was', 'surprised', 'low', 'quality', 'lack', 'information', 'do', 'wish', 'was', 'possible', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'review', 'still', 'feel', 'experience', 'dvds', 'good', 'performer', 'when', 'get', 'chance-', 'would', 'take', 'class', 'person']",N/A
956871,A29V9Z89OH03YR,B000CCW2PW,Tamii,"[54, 55]","I'm really getting tired of these dvds that promise or advertise to be instructive when all that is given is a view of different performances and commentary.  It presumes that erotic dancing is ""easy"" and anyone with half a body can do it.  This idea simply is not true.  As a teacher, women come to me at times with no idea of how to do a hip circle or other basic erotic dance moves.  They cannot learn through observation only. This dvd takes the observation approach.  Basic/intermediate erotic dance moves are not taught through direct instruction, but through observation. Also, this dvd does involve brief nudity.That being said, I do appreciate that in the product description, this dvd states that this product is really geared more towards women with erotic dance experience.  I do like that good, sound tips about how to do a lap dance is given.  Mostly, I liked this dvd for the suggestions and tips to beginning house dancers who want to earn a bit more money.  However, in terms of the moves presented for dancers of this type...there's just not enough variation presented here in order to make it worthwhile.This dvd has 4 different dance routines by four different dancers including Fawnia. The talent is capable and moves are executed really well. Then, there is a section on clothing removal which involves how to remove a bra and T-bar.  There's also an interview section where Fawnia briefly interviews two of the dancers about dancing and the impact it has had on their lives.To sum, I think this dvd will benefit buyers with some erotic dance experience.  Beginning dancers or women who are new or shy about erotic dancing might have some difficulty with imitating the moves through observation only.  For these women, I'd suggest ""The Art of Exotic Dancing"" or ""Exotic dancing for Everyday Women."" These two dvds will give you direct instruction on some basic moves.  Let's face it, in order to fully appreciate this dvd, you will need familiarity with basic erotic dance moves first.",3,Not instructive enough,1159574400,"09 30, 2006",2006,2007,"[""'m"", 'really', 'getting', 'tired', 'dvds', 'promise', 'advertise', 'be', 'instructive', 'when', 'given', 'view', 'different', 'performances', 'commentary', 'erotic', 'dancing', 'easy', 'anyone', 'body', 'can', 'do', 'idea', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'teacher', 'women', 'come', 'times', 'idea', 'how', 'do', 'hip', 'circle', 'other', 'basic', 'erotic', 'dance', 'moves', 'can', 'not', 'learn', 'observation', 'only', 'dvd', 'observation', 'approach', 'Basic/intermediate', 'erotic', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'taught', 'direct', 'instruction', 'observation', 'Also', 'dvd', 'involve', 'brief', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'appreciate', 'product', 'description', 'dvd', 'product', 'really', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'women', 'erotic', 'dance', 'experience', 'do', 'good', 'sound', 'tips', 'how', 'do', 'lap', 'dance', 'given', 'Mostly', 'liked', 'dvd', 'suggestions', 'tips', 'beginning', 'house', 'dancers', 'who', 'want', 'earn', 'bit', 'more', 'money', 'However', 'terms', 'moves', 'presented', 'dancers', 'type', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'variation', 'presented', 'here', 'order', 'make', 'worthwhile.This', 'dvd', '4', 'different', 'dance', 'routines', 'four', 'different', 'dancers', 'including', 'Fawnia', 'talent', 'capable', 'moves', 'are', 'executed', 'really', 'well', 'Then', 'section', 'clothing', 'removal', 'how', 'remove', 'bra', 'T-bar', 'also', 'interview', 'section', 'where', 'Fawnia', 'interviews', 'two', 'dancers', 'dancing', 'impact', 'had', 'lives.To', 'sum', 'think', 'dvd', 'will', 'benefit', 'buyers', 'erotic', 'dance', 'experience', 'Beginning', 'dancers', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'shy', 'erotic', 'dancing', 'might', 'have', 'difficulty', 'imitating', 'moves', 'observation', 'only', 'women', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Art', 'Exotic', 'Dancing', 'Exotic', 'dancing', 'Everyday', 'Women', 'two', 'dvds', 'will', 'give', 'direct', 'instruction', 'basic', 'moves', 'Let', 'face', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'dvd', 'will', 'need', 'familiarity', 'basic', 'erotic', 'dance', 'moves', 'first']",N/A

Only one dancer seemed to really be intuitive in her dancing, all the others I was fast ffwing & just saw the same 3-5 moves over & over.All you learn: Always touch yourself as much as possible, look/act or really enjoy yourself teasing him, let him see you from all angles, always pose to make sure you show your body in best possible light, roll your butt in his face, let your hair stroke his body, rub your boobs & crotch in his face, simulate sex in any way you can think, sliding your whole body up/down, sit on him up/down, whisper in his ear, make him feel wanted, ask him what he wants: an aggressive or shy girl, use blindfolds or tie him up so he can't touch you... That's it. The most important part is being confident in yourself & loving your own body.This also has an interview with dancers & their private life for anyone who wants to become an exotic dancer.I gave 2 stars for it being unique, using voice over while a dancer demonstrates, not too boring in how teaches, though needs more moves, had 3 different real dancers who won awards (though can't be for what they show here, must be toned down) & some interesting moves like the ""spider"" which is doing the bridge pose in a guy's face by putting your feet on the back of the chair.It showed like 4 ways to take off a bra or panties, but only 1 seemed different, the rest boring.Half the dancers were about entertaining a customer if you should decide to go that business & half about entertaining your significant other.I am disappointed, I expected much more flair.",2,Learn very little,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,1563,"['agree', 'Tropical', 'Only', 'one', 'dancer', 'seemed', 'really', 'be', 'intuitive', 'dancing', 'others', 'was', 'fast', 'ffwing', 'just', 'saw', 'same', '3-5', 'moves', 'learn', 'Always', 'touch', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'look/act', 'really', 'enjoy', 'teasing', 'let', 'see', 'angles', 'always', 'pose', 'make', 'sure', 'show', 'body', 'best', 'possible', 'light', 'roll', 'butt', 'face', 'let', 'hair', 'stroke', 'body', 'rub', 'boobs', 'crotch', 'face', 'simulate', 'sex', 'way', 'can', 'think', 'sliding', 'whole', 'body', 'up/down', 'sit', 'up/down', 'whisper', 'ear', 'make', 'feel', 'wanted', 'ask', 'what', 'aggressive', 'shy', 'girl', 'use', 'blindfolds', 'tie', 'up', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'touch', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'being', 'confident', 'loving', 'own', 'body.This', 'also', 'interview', 'dancers', 'private', 'life', 'anyone', 'who', 'become', 'exotic', 'dancer.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'being', 'unique', 'using', 'voice', 'dancer', 'not', 'too', 'boring', 'how', 'teaches', 'needs', 'more', 'moves', 'had', '3', 'different', 'real', 'dancers', 'who', 'won', 'awards', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'what', 'show', 'here', 'must', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'interesting', 'moves', 'spider', 'doing', 'bridge', 'pose', 'guy', 'face', 'putting', 'feet', 'back', 'chair.It', 'showed', '4', 'ways', 'take', 'off', 'bra', 'panties', 'only', '1', 'seemed', 'different', 'rest', 'boring.Half', 'dancers', 'were', 'entertaining', 'customer', 'should', 'decide', 'go', 'business', 'half', 'entertaining', 'significant', 'other.I', 'am', 'disappointed', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'flair']",N/A
