Unfortunately, all the pretty ""bells and whistles"" spent in effects and on the horrible Megan Fox could not save this poor excuse of a comic book adaptation. Even the great John Malkovich was sucked into Fox's talentless vacuum by portraying an unconvincing villain that is as intimidating as my next door neighbor's toy poodle.  With all this said, Josh Brolin was one of the redeeming qualities in the film that made it watchable and entertaining.  When I say ""entertaining"" I mean in a ""MST-3000"" meaning where you sit around with friends and make fun of it while intoxicated on your choice of poison. I believe Brolin knew what he was getting into and said to himself, ""Screw it!  Im going to have fun with the role while I'm getting paid millions for this turd!!"". And it really shows in his performance. This is the beauty of the film if you choose to acknowledge it or not.

The description for the movie sounded appealing to me, so I made the horrendous decision to watch it assuming I was going to be impresed by an action flick but.. wow does it ever seriously unquestionably STINK!Good luck trying to follow along to any kind of storyline.  The pacing of the film mainly focuses around cheesy explosions coming out of nowhere, a woman who works as a prostitute and her daily struggles dealing with men who want to kill her, and people lying dead in the ground coming back to life for a few minutes to reveal important information before quickly slipping back into death again.  I really don't get any of this of course.Just keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.  Otherwise you'll be left sitting there totally confused and uninterested in just about everything taking place on screen.Even without understanding any of the storyline segments, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to realize the acting is terrible all around.

1305567,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002ZG982S,buru buru piggu,"[3, 7]","Jonah Hex is bad. Really bad. Please turn around now and pick up another movie.Don't trust the low Amazon rating? Read on. I have an almost masochistic fascination with really bad films so I watched this knowing it got terrible reviews from movie-goers and reviewers alike. Sometimes a movie is so bad, you just have to watch it to experience the utter ridiculosity of the filmmaker and new-found heights of cinematic stupidity, like Uwe Boll's seminal crapfestHouse of the Dead, ranked consistently in IMDB's 100 worst films of all time. Even in its awfulness, there's a sort ofMystery Science Theater 3000-like entertainment value as an example of WTF filmmaking to poke fun at. It's so bad, it makes you laugh. Jonah Hex is so bad it makes you want to punch all those involved in bringing this atrocity to the screen. Aside from the sight of the lovely Megan Fox in a bodice, there's really no reason to watch this complete mess of a film. If you enjoyed last summer's bombG.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, however, you might like Jonah Hex.Previous reviewers hit it right on the head when they likened JH to Wild Wild West and Van Helsing for its mix of western, sci-fi and steampunk. All 3 films had big, likable stars, were ridiculously campy and failed miserably at the box office. I'll add in another:The League of Extraordinary Gentlemenfor JH's similarity in plot of bad guy building a terrifying ship-based superweapon that can level cities and supernatural/occult overtones. I like hero/anti-hero action, westerns/period films and historical fiction, with an occasional bit of camp, but with a muddled script, a snooze-inducing villain, and a really crappy hero, Jonah Hex manages to get everything wrong in its brief 72 minutes. On top of that, the decision to mix heavy metal into the film was just dumb. The consistently excellent Marco Beltrami provides part of the score and progressive metal band Mastadon provides the rest. Westerns and heavy metal do not mix, especially during shootouts, adding a decided factor of cheese to the whole thing. I like westerns, I like action. I like metal. I do not like them all at once.Never mind some of the severe gaps in storytelling logic: Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, went on to design a secret super-weapon for the US government that it never built, but it had all the parts and plans just lying around? Never mind that a band of ex-Confederate rebels with no scientific or engineering background can build the thing in a few weeks or the unexplained source of the glowing orbs that provide the explosive power. Never mind because this movie is already so bad that logic gaps can't make it worse.Josh Brolin, who I loved inNo Country for Old Men, is totally uninteresting in his portrayal of the title character. Maybe there wasn't much he could've done with the script. He is devoid of personality and so is his arch enemy, John Malkovich, who looks more like bum than villain and maybe even more boring than he was inEragon. The last time I saw this much wood was at a gay pride parade. Michael Fassbender does give the film a much-needed splash of personality as the vicious and combat-adept Irish psychopath Burke, as does Aiden Quinn as President Grant, and the Smith who makes Jonah's gear. In his brief 2 or 3 minutes onscreen, Smith manages to convey more warmth and personality than Brolin does in the entire film.What killed this movie, aside from the lack of character development and plot that's as chopped up as Hex's face, was just how lame Hex was as a hero. I'm not familiar with the comics, but if Hex is supposed to be the strong, silent type, you won't see it here. Brolin's Hex can hardly fight and gets shot really easily. He's pretty much a wimp and a bungler. I didn't expect to see the archetypal ""Man With No Name"" that Clint Eastwood made famous (though there is a scene ripped off from Fistful of Dollars), but I did expect a solid measure of bad-assedness, self-reliance, and the ability to avoid getting shot, either by using brains, or quick reflexes. He seems to have no knowledge of combat/assault tactics and would've died if not for the unexplained Indian medicine men who keep reviving his sorry carcass. He depends on fancy weapons more than wit, quick-thinking, or fighting abilities. The gatling gun that features so prominently on the movie poster, you see only once. For about 20 seconds. He is so poor at being a hero that he gets ambushed trying to do an ambush -- he gets jumped by Burke as he tries to sneak up the plank to their boat. At night... Lastly is some questionable CG. The crayola-colored dreamworld/flashback sequences are cheesy and poorly done as are some really fake looking explosions. Even the superweapon is lame. It shoots out cannonballs, and then a glowing Dragon Ball to detonate them.Ugh.. watch this only if you feel life is too long. I'm hoping there's a director's cut somewhere that can redeem this movie somewhat. As it stands, 1.5 stars at most.",1,Jonah Suxx,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,4985,"['Jonah', 'Hex', 'bad', 'Really', 'bad', 'Please', 'turn', 'around', 'now', 'pick', 'up', 'movie.Do', ""n't"",

1305571,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B002ZG982S,Chris Kennison,"[0, 3]","Completely prepared to loathe Jonah Hex, I started watching the film and found myself strangely, loving it. It was unique and violent and full of old west cold-heartedness and then you throw in cool weapons and Jonah Hex's ability to talk to the dead, and you have the capability of a great and memorable movie.The first thing you have to imagine is that Jonah Hex is a comic book movie. It's unrealistic in its truest form. It unreal set in a very real civil war America, where the nation is divided between those who love America and those who think government is out to destroy their freedoms and are fully prepared to bring the country down to secure this.The movie has a nice production value with good effects and fast moving action and a fast moving story, in fact, too fast. The story that is. I can only guess what happened with Jonah Hex. The studio heads and their all knowing money grubbing brains, saw early takes of the film, saw the money that was being spent to blow up a train and probably a bunch of other scenes that were slated to be filmed, and figured that people wouldn't get it, buy it or invest in Jonah Hex and his hard to believe world of old west with technology, and they cut the filmmakers budget, cheapening the production and causing the creators to cut dozens of scenes that made the movie more whole and more involved.Ultimately, Jonah Hex, in its finished form, started off like a movie with great promise as Jonah Hex discovers that his arch nemesis, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), the man who disfigured him and killed his family, is still alive and plotting a large scale attack on the government of America. Yet, somewhere about 30 minutes in, the movie is obviously missing some scenes because there's very little setup as Hex finds Turnbull in a couple of scenes. Of course, the movie can't end there, so the first battle between them ends in a tie and then a couple of scenes later we're at the finale.What? What happened to the movie. The scenes that were including in the final product were well done and well shot, well performed and looked brilliant and were creative. The scenes that were missing was the problem with the film. So, either the original filmmakers had no faith in the film and cut the middle out in order to save money, or the studio itself had no faith in the film and they cut the budget. End of story.Had the studio and the creators had faith in what they were doing, Jonah Hex may have been a memorable western sci-fi film, but they didn't, and the finished product is a rushed, hurried, choppy, something missing story that falls right into the same mold as every other forgettable movie that comes out on a yearly basis.",2,LACK OF FAITH dooms JONAH HEX,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,2692,"['Completely', 'prepared', 'loathe', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'started', 'watching', 'film', 'found', 'strangely', 'loving', 'was', 'unique', 'violent', 'full', 'old', 'west', 'cold-heartedness', 'then', 'throw', 'cool', 'weapons', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'ability', 'talk', 'dead', 'have', 'capability', 'great', 'memorable', 'movie.The', 'first', 'thing', 'have', 'imagine', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'unrealistic', 'truest', 'form', 'unreal', 'set', 'very', 'real', 'civil', 'war', 'America', 'where', 'nation', 'divided', 'who', 'love', 'America', 'who', 'think', 'government', 'out', 'destroy', 'freedoms', 'are', 'fully', 'prepared', 'bring', 'country', 'down', 'secure', 'this.The', 'movie', 'nice', 'production', 'value', 'good', 'effects', 'fast', 'moving', 'action', 'fast', 'moving', 'story', 'fact', 'too', 'fast', 'story', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'what', 'happened', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'studio', 'heads', 'knowing', 'money', 'grubbing', 'brains', 'saw', 'early', 'film', 'saw', 'money', 'was', 'being', 'spent', 'blow', 'up', 'train', 'probably', 'bunch', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'slated', 'be', 'filmed', 'figured', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'buy', 'invest', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'hard', 'believe', 'world', 'old', 'west', 'technology', 'cut', 'filmmakers', 'budget', 'cheapening', 'production', 'causing', 'creators', 'cut', 'dozens', 'scenes', 'made', 'movie', 'more', 'whole', 'more', 'involved.Ultimately', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'finished', 'form', 'started', 'off', 'movie', 'great', 'promise', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Quentin', 'Turnbull', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'man', 'who', 'disfigured', 'killed', 'family', 'still', 'alive', 'plotting', 'large', 'scale', 'attack', 'government', 'America', 'somewhere', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'obviously', 'missing', 'scenes', 'very', 'little', 'setup', 'Hex', 'Turnbull', 'couple', 'scenes', 'course', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'first', 'battle', 'tie', 'then', 'couple', 'scenes', 'later', ""'re"", 'finale.What', 'What', 'happened', 'movie', 'scenes', 'were', 'including', 'final', 'product', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'shot', 'well', 'performed', 'looked', 'brilliant', 'were', 'creative', 'scenes', 'were', 'missing', 'was', 'problem', 'film', 'So', 'original', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'faith', 'film', 'cut', 'middle', 'out', 'order', 'save', 'money', 'studio', 'had', 'faith', 'film', 'cut', 'budget', 'End', 'story.Had', 'studio', 'creators', 'had', 'faith', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'memorable', 'western', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'finished', 'product', 'rushed', 'hurried', 'choppy', 'something', 'missing', 'story', 'right', 'same', 'mold', 'other', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'out', 'yearly', 'basis']",N/A
1305572,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG982S,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 9]","As much as I hate sounding like a cinematic apologist, I can't deny it when I enjoy a film in spite of almost universal disdain. Having given passing grades to critically lambasted films like ""10,000 B.C.,"" ""The Women,"" ""Nine,"" and most recently, ""Legion,"" I will once again raise my voice in defense of ""Jonah Hex,"" a loud, aggressive, lightning-quick revenge tale that seems to have no qualms about its delightfully preposterous premise or its gloriously fantastical vision of nineteenth-century America. It was made, I believe, not only in the spirit of fun as an escapist action spectacle, but also as a statement - weak though it may be - about terrorism and modern nuclear war. Have better films been made with these qualities? You bet. Still, this movie achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and with all due respect to those who wrote scathing reviews, sometimes you can't ask for any more than that.Adapted from the comic book by John Albano and Tony Dezuniga, the film tells the story of the title character (Josh Brolin), who in the 1860s served the Confederate Army before disobeying a direct order and being forced to kill one of his fellow soldiers. That soldier's father, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), retaliated by killing Hex's family and branding the right side of his face, turning it into a gaping mass of scar tissue. Although never adequately explained, it seems Hex gained supernatural powers from his near death experience, namely the ability to raise the dead with a touch of his hand. This will come in handy on more than one occasion; it's especially fun, in its own ghoulish way, when he has to dig up the grave of Turnbull's son to extract information.But I'm getting ahead of the story. Believing Turnbull dead, Hex has spent the last number of years as a lawless bounty hunter, driven by profit instead of loyalty, sought after only as a last resort. And that's exactly where the American government is at; President Ulysses S. Grant (Aiden Quinn) has learned that Turnbull is still alive, plotting to destroy Washington D.C. on July 4, 1876, America's centennial. Grant and his staff know that only Hex can stop him. Hex accepts their offer, not out of patriotism but because he and Turnbull have unfinished business. In many ways, the two are exactly the same: Both have lost loved ones; both are driven by revenge; both hate the American government. So what exactly would Hex get out of this if he were to succeed? He's certainly not looking to be a national icon.Tagging along is Hex's love interest, a prostitute named Lilah (Megan Fox), who isn't given all that much to do except look hot, fight men twice her size, deliver smart-aleck one-liners, and pack weapons in all sorts of naughty places. It's hard to find another angle of approach here; apart from the obvious visual appeal, I suspect nothing of value would have been lost if this character had been eliminated from the screenplay. Honestly, she's about as necessary to the plot as the appendix is to the human digestive system. Of course, we don't begrudge the appendix just because it happens to be useless. So why should we begrudge this character? How can we given the fact that the plot is equally useless?The film runs at a brisk eighty minutes, and that includes the end credits. What I find amazing is that, with such a short running time, director Jimmy Hayward still managed to tell a cohesive and fairly complete story, which makes me second-guess my belief that being thorough doesn't necessarily mean being exhaustive; I learned pretty much everything I needed to know about the plot, the settings, and the characters, the only exception to the latter being Lilah. Perhaps this is because nothing about the story is based in reality - not even the Civil War, which had only passing references to begin with, seems genuinely depicted. Or perhaps it's because there wasn't much to expand on, the characters being little more than stick-figure caricatures. Whatever the case, its length had no real impact on its quality, and that's really saying something.I guess what I'm saying is that I enjoyed this film specifically for its silliness, its tongue-in-cheek attitude to the material, its comic book mindlessness. I also enjoyed the allusions to past and present political situations, specifically as related to the development and usage of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Granted, the allusions are momentary at best; what you're really supposed to focus on is the fun. ""Jonah Hex"" will never be considered a great film. It won't even be considered a good film. In all likelihood, it will be forgotten ten years down the line. Nevertheless, I do think it can be enjoyed as the violent flight-of-fancy it was so clearly intended to be. If there ever was a movie made purely for your entertainment, this would be it.",4,"The Quick, the Dead, and the Ugly",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,4830,"['As', 'much', 'hate', 'sounding',

As so often happens, Hollywood has taken a very nice comic series and messed around with it a bit.  Secondly, when you watch this thing you have to remember that it is pure fantasy. I personally am not all that hung up on the comic book featuring this character and do not follow it; although I must say that is the issues I have seen are quite well done and I can fully appreciate their attraction.Briefly we have sort of a cross between many of the early Clint Eastwood movies and The Wild, Wild West.  Throw in some mystic powers, such as the ability of Jonah to talk to the dead and a seemingly inability to be killed on Jonah's part, and you pretty well have the overall feeling of what you are dealing with.Simply stated, Jonah Hex is a former Confederate soldier who betrayed his unit, shot his best friend, had his family (Jonah's) burned alive in front of him by an evil Confederate Office, was left for dead, was found by the Crow Indians, brought back to life and then goes out into the world to seek revenge.  We find that the Confederate Officer who burned his family is truly an evil guy and now has access to a ""super weapon"" and plans to blow up Washington D.C. along with the rest of the country.  Hex is sent of a mission my President Grant to stop the evil deeds from happening.What I liked about the movie was that it was truly ""gritty,"" and it was dark!  You came away feeling and smelling the sweat and dust and the blood and the pain. Also, Jonah is truly rather ugly with half his face burned away after being branded.  Secondly, there is a very satisfactory body count.  I sort of lost track of it after about 20 minutes...but trust me...there were plenty of various neat killings.  Third, the movie is filled with many, many very satisfactory explosions, fire and mayhem.  Fourth, the young lady who plays Hex's girl friend, a prostitute, is quite stunning and extremely pleasing to the eye. I think the current term of ""hot,"" would apply to her. I also rather like Jonah's dog and horse.  Fifth, I love a good revenge movie and the revenge here is absolute.The use of the various gadgets Hex uses in reminiscent of The Wild, Wild West but stretch your credibility to the extreme.  But of course as I said, this is pure fantasy so I did not quibble about that aspect.  As to Hex's mystic powers...hey folks, this is a movie...it is not suppose to be real...just enjoy it.Bottom line:  If you are a fan of the Hex comics, you might be disappointed.  If you are looking for a deep and meaningful plot line...you will be devastated. The plot line is truly a mess.  If you like a fantasy story with lots of dead people, a high body count, lots of things being blown up...well, like me, you will probably enjoy this one.I might tell you though...watch the first 15 or 20 minutes of this one.  If you like what you see, the press on...you get more of the same throughout the film.  If you do not like it...well shut it down cause it don't get no any better than what you have already seen.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",4,THIS IS A RIGHT FINE MOVIE IF YOU LIKE THIS SORT OF THING.,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,4193,"['Movies', 'days', 'are', 'books', 'have', 'access', 'numbers', 'genre', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'such', 'great', 'access', 'choices', 'literally', 'something', 'out', 'there', 'everyone', 'When', 'books', 'movies', 'always', 'think', 'old', 'saying', 'One', 'man', 'garbage', 'man', 'treasure', 'Now', 'did', 'not', 'purchase', 'rent', 'movie', 'No', 'am', 'too', 'cheap', 'watched', 'one', 'late', 'night', 'one', 'various', 'movies', 'channels', 'have', 'access', 'Actually', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'watched', 'twice', 'will', 'state', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'rather', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'theater', 'see', 'one', 'popcorn', 'outrageously', 'priced', 'am', 'not', 'allowed', 'have', 'soft', 'drinks', 'candy', 'wife', 'doctor', 'doing', '.Anyway', 'personally', 'rather', 'liked', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'sort', 'fit', 'specific', 'needs', 'time', 'watched', 'perfectly', 'are', 'couple', 'things', 'consider', 'watch', 'First', 'are', 'comic', 'geek', 'am', 'am', 'sort', 'closet', 'comic', 'geek', 'dearly', 'love', 'collection', 'vintage', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'comics', 'then', 'quite', 'well', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'disappointment', 'are', 'follower', 'Jonah', 'so', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'taken', 'very', 'nice', 'comic', 'series', 'messed', 'bit', 'Secondly', 'when', 'watch', 'thing', 'have', 'remember', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'personally', 'am', 'not', 'hung', 'up', 'comic', 'book', 'featuring', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'must', 'say', 'issues', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'attraction.Briefly', 'have', 'sort', 'cross', 'many', 'early', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Throw', 'mystic', 'powers', 'such', 'ability', 'Jonah', 'talk', 'dead', 'seemingly', 'inability', 'be', 'killed', 'Jonah', 'part', 'pretty', 'well', 'have', 'overall', 'feeling', 'what', 'are', 'dealing', 'with.Simply', 'stated', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'former', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'betrayed', 'unit', 'shot', 'best', 'friend', 'had', 'family', 'Jonah', 'burned', 'alive', 'front', 'evil', 'Confederate', 'Office', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'was', 'found', 'Crow', 'Indians', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'then', 'out', 'world', 'seek', 'revenge', 'find', 'Confederate', 'Officer', 'who', 'burned', 'family', 'truly', 'evil', 'guy', 'now', 'access', 'super', 'weapon', 'plans', 'blow', 'up', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'rest', 'country', 'Hex', 'sent', 'mission', 'President', 'Grant', 'stop', 'evil', 'deeds', 'happening.What', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'truly', 'gritty', 'was', 'dark', 'came', 'away', 'feeling', 'smelling', 'sweat', 'dust', 'blood', 'pain', 'Also', 'Jonah', 'truly', 'rather', 'ugly', 'face', 'burned', 'away', 'being', 'branded', 'Secondly', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'body', 'count', 'sort', 'lost', 'track', '20', 'minutes', 'trust', 'were', 'plenty', 'various', 'neat', 'killings', 'Third', 'movie', 'filled', 'many', 'many', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'explosions', 'fire', 'mayhem', 'Fourth', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Hex', 'girl', 'friend', 'prostitute', 'quite', 'stunning', 'extremely', 'pleasing', 'eye', 'think', 'current', 'term', 'hot', 'would', 'apply', 'also', 'rather', 'Jonah', 'dog', 'horse', 'Fifth', 'love', 'good', 'revenge', 'movie', 'revenge', 'here', 'absolute.The', 'use', 'various', 'gadgets', 'Hex', 'reminiscent', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'extreme', 'course', 'said', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'did', 'not', 'quibble', 'aspect', 'Hex', 'mystic', 'powers', 'hey', 'folks', 'movie', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'real', 'just', 'enjoy', 'it.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'fan', 'Hex', 'comics', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'looking', 'deep', 'meaningful', 'plot', 'line', 'will', 'be', 'devastated', 'plot', 'line', 'truly', 'mess', 'like', 'fantasy', 'story', 'lots', 'dead', 'people', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'lots', 'things', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'well', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one.I', 'might', 'tell', 'watch', 'first', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'one', 'like', 'what', 'see', 'press', 'get', 'more', 'same', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'well', 'shut', 'down', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'seen.Don', 'BlankenshipThe', 'Ozarks']",N/A

I like movies that bust out of the usual genre cliches.But it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for ""Jonah Hex"" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Van Helsing,"" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.Then the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building ""the weapon"" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).I wish I could give a better summary of the plot in ""Jonah Hex,"" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.Basically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (""Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead""), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for ""the weapon,"" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?I'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.""Jonah Hex"" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""

1305586,AYG1U47VFZ165,B002ZG982S,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 2]","I've not only grown up reading comic books, but I've grown old reading them.  When my peers moved on from reading entirely, I tried to maintain some sense of intimacy with the world of graphic storytelling.  Although I have no one title I follow exclusively, I'll pick up a graphic novel from almost any line so long as I'm assured by someone - friend, enemy, critic - that it's worth the time and money, so I tend to always eventually get around to seeing the films of comics-inspired properties in hope of finding myself something else worth looking into.I never read JONAH HEX growing up, but I did follow the character's brief stint in an alternate timeline: HEX threw the bounty hunter into the future, where an apocalyptic Earth provided him some familiar wastelands to spend the rest of his days rightin' wrongs.  So I had some working familiarity with the myth, and, while the film JONAH HEX didn't exactly delight, it certainly didn't disappoint.  Josh Brolin makes the best of spittin' his lines out from between his clenched teeth and gnarled cheek scar.The story?  Hex (Brolin) is a bounty hunter sought out by President Ulysses S. Grant (a sadly under-used Aidan Quinn) to help save the day from Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), a former Confederate general with an axe to grind against the now re-United States post the Civil War.  The story boasts strong hints of ""The Wild, Wild West"" (the TV show, not the insipid Will Smith movie) where secret weapons, dastardly deeds, and lovely lasses all come together against the backdrop of the American West.  There's a love interest - Megan Fox plays Hex's squeeze Lilah - and lesser heavy thrown in for good measure - the increasingly spectacular Michael Fassbender as Burke, Turnbull's right-hand-man and the guy responsible for murdering Hex's family years earlier.The formula had all the right ingredients, but, all-in-all, HEX turns out to be a bit of a disappointment though time may reward this lesser comic property with a `cult' statis.The problems?Arguably, the biggest anchor here is the fact that HEX is a film out of time.  Hex's backstory is smaller and more intimate than the typical superhero - his ""ability"" is to communicate with the dead - and, hence, a smaller story would've been more in order.  With the SPIDER-MAN films and Christopher Nolan's stamp on THE DARK KNIGHT, the bar was raised, and, apparently, some suit thought more ""flash"" was needed.  An opening train robbery was elevated ridiculously to the level of a Michael Bay explosion extravaganza, and for what?  The theft of a few train cars.  Also, the story required a massive superweapon.  After all, don't all evil geniuses have one?  But the magical mystical supercannon comes complete with glowing cannon balls that function like nuclear missiles, and the audience is given absolutely no logical explanation of the possible science.  (Hint, hint: there wasn't any.)Sadly, Malkovich - one of our current Hollywood greats - appears entirely bereft of the fact that he was being filmed throughout the production of HEX.  As the film's principal heavy, Malkovich plays Turnbull completely void of any real passion, motivation, or depth, and that's not to say that the script couldn't have used a few touch-ups in the dialogue department here and there.  But instead of chewing scenery, Malkovich seems to blend in with it.  Also, Fox - despite her obvious physical assets - is completely miscast here.  She deadpans her lines with all the charm of the average cell phone conversation, and she looks curiously ant-like wearing a corset cinched tight enough to, quite literally, split the woman in half.  To his strength, Brolin makes the best of Hex, imbuing the character with equal parts ""Dirty Harry"" and ""The Crow"" in a script that really needed to tone down the dramatic overuse of unnecessary metaphysical flashbacks.  While his resume does show contributions to several children's animation features from Pixar, director Jimmy Hayward seems lost - or, at least, entirely detached - from the source materials, and why the fine folks at Warner Bros. chose to leave a dark and ominous revenge story in Hayward's hands remains a mystery to me.  His sole previous directing credit (per IMDB.com) was HORTON HEARS A WHO!I'm no director, nor a screenwriter, but what Warner Bros. should've done here is really toyed with the contemporary Western.  Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN could've served as a perfect inspiration for JONAH HEX - there are strong similarities to character backstories - but given the film a decidedly ""X Files"" edge while exploring Hex's skills at communicating with the deceased.  Instead, we're given a flashy GHOST RIDER knock-off really missing the dirt and grit so common to an oater picture.  (`Oater' is Hollywood slang for the Western, for those uninformed.)  The studio went mainstream when they should've gone ""field-and-stream,"" especially given Fassbender's quirky Irish prescence that really is given - like an awful lot else - very little explanation or exposition.Still, a near-miss is a near-miss, and, as I've said, HEX may enjoy a reasonable shelf-life as a cult property, which, in itself, is a bit of a quandary.  It used to be small studios turned out cult hits, certainly not a powerhouse like Warner Bros. and certainly not now that comic properties are ""an in thing.""  It's an easy way to kill an hour and a half - a harmless diversion - but, much like Hex's inner turmoil over losing his family years earlier, I can't help wonderin' what could've been.",2,A Near-Miss

Who authorized the budget and why were they not stopped by anyone who might have had the merest speculation of a suggestion of a clue how bad this would be? Jonah Hex is a one time Confederate soldier who hunts down evil doers. I'll take that as my mantra if I ever run into the twits who created it. Its only saving grace was that it is only 80 minutes long.I never read Jonah Hex as a kid, I was more into Marvel's `Kid Colt.' I'd heard the lousy reviews but though I can keep an open mind. I liked Zorro and Errol Flynn films, I'll give it a chance.  I gave it a chance.

Will Smith can enunciate his words. Brolin mumbles so much of his dialogue you're sure he's got a mouth full of pebbles and may have just swallowed two or three. You can't really understand him half the time and after a while you really don't want to. Chasing down the villain and his uber killing machine Brolin seems to roll around the battlefield shrugging off bullets and coming and going like Clint Eastwood's ""Preacher"" in Pale Rider but with less style.He's supported by Megan Fox who I will admit is a draw. She can't act but I thought her in period clothing as a whore with a heart of...whatever, would be cute. Well she is and it wasn't enough. Her acting is so wooden you expect a couple of Hex' Native American friends to carve her into a totem pole. She's somehow affected a southern drawl for no given reason. Maybe that is what she thinks is acting.The director has sort of art house dream sequences to try and make it look mysterious and other worldly but all it does it clog the screen. Maybe Brolin's explaining it in voice over but his garbled mumbling is so unintelligible he could just as easily be ordering out for a pizza, no anchovies, you can't tell.When the credits finally roll all you can think is that Jonah Hex did the impossible, it actually made Wild Wild West seem not so bad, and yes that includes the parts with Ken Branagh's walking giant spider kill bot.",1,Absolutely useless,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2326,"['Who', 'green', 'lit', 'drivel', 'Who', 'authorized', 'budget', 'why', 'were', 'not', 'stopped', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'merest', 'speculation', 'suggestion', 'clue', 'how', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'one', 'time', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'down', 'evil', 'doers', ""'ll"", 'take', 'mantra', 'ever', 'run', 'twits', 'who', 'created', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'only', '80', 'minutes', 'long.I', 'never', 'read', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'kid', 'was', 'more', 'Marvel', 'Kid', 'Colt', ""'d"", 'heard', 'lousy', 'reviews', 'can', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'liked', 'Zorro', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'films', ""'ll"", 'give', 'chance', 'gave', 'chance', 'Now', 'want', 'revenge', 'darker', 'art', 'house', 'version', 'Will', 'Ssmith', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'basic', 'plot', 'being', 'President', 'Grant', 'mysterious', 'loner', 'government', 'agent', 'stop', 'former', 'Confederate', 'general', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'United', 'States', 'comic', 'book', 'style', 'weapon.The', 'films', 'differ', 'there', 'Will', 'Smith', 'can', 'enunciate', 'words', 'Brolin', 'so', 'much', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'sure', 'got', 'mouth', 'full', 'pebbles', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'swallowed', 'two', 'three', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'time', 'while', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Chasing', 'down', 'villain', 'uber', 'killing', 'machine', 'Brolin', 'roll', 'around', 'battlefield', 'shrugging', 'off', 'bullets', 'coming', 'going', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Preacher', 'Pale', 'Rider', 'less', 'style.He', 'supported', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'who', 'will', 'admit', 'draw', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'thought', 'period', 'clothing', 'whore', 'heart', 'whatever', 'would', 'be', 'cute', 'Well', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'acting', 'so', 'wooden', 'expect', 'couple', 'Hex', 'Native', 'American', 'friends', 'carve', 'totem', 'pole', 'somehow', 'affected', 'southern', 'drawl', 'given', 'reason', 'Maybe', 'what', 'acting.The', 'director', 'sort', 'art', 'house', 'dream', 'sequences', 'try', 'make', 'look', 'mysterious', 'other', 'worldly', 'clog', 'screen', 'Maybe', 'Brolin', 'explaining', 'voice', 'garbled', 'mumbling', 'so', 'unintelligible', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'ordering', 'out', 'pizza', 'anchovies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell.When', 'credits', 'finally', 'roll', 'can', 'think', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'did', 'impossible', 'actually', 'made', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'seem', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'yes', 'parts', 'Ken', 'Branagh', 'walking', 'giant', 'spider', 'kill', 'bot']",N/A

1305601,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B002ZG982S,Haunted Flower,"[13, 18]","""Jonah Hex"" was directed by Jimmy Hayward who was a director and actor for ""Horton Hears a Who!"" and clearly was the right choice for the job (*insert sarcasm here*). Josh Brolin stars as Jonah Hex, a branded ex-Confederate Soldier turned bounty hunter on a path for vengeance against Quentin Turnbull played by John Malkovich, the man who murdered his wife and child.Unfamiliar with the comic book, I thought I was going to be getting more of a lone gunslinger wild west tale, but instead got a warped CGI explosion heavy, shoddy hand-to-hand combat action flick in South Carolina. Were there ever deserts in South Carolina?My first instinct was that this film was pretty inconsistent/uneven, but that would have to imply that parts were good and parts were bad and for the life of me, I can't think of any parts that were good.When the tagline reads ""Revenge is Ugly"", they weren't kidding. Brolin's face is so ugly along with his personality that it is almost impossible to cheer for him. He's gruff and maybe it is the challenge of working with the side of his mouth clenched from the deformity, but his half-hearted quips never pay off. You never get the impression that he actually likes or cares about Megan Fox or her character and all of their scenes have the chilly chemistry of ""Let's get this over with.""Megan Fox as Lilah right from the start is pretty unlikable. Her character is a hypocrite chasing off some John who wants her to run away with him to the big city only to suggest to Jonah Hex that he do the same with her. Megan Fox's body looks good in a dress and we all know she is a striking young lady even in the all-natural look she was sporting cosmetics-wise, but someone came up with the horrible idea to give her a blurry Barbara Walters filter in EVERY shot to ease off some of that high definition detail that might expose a reality where she has pores *gasp*. It is super distracting and suggests her character ought to have angel wings or something when her attitude and morals couldn't be farther away. Her accent is painful and remember while watching this that in the movie world, you have multiple takes to choose from when you make the final cut so the line delivery you hear here is the best the director got out of her. Wow. Bad choice all around to cast her because looks-wise you'd think it would work, but instead of making her real and gritty and consistent with the rest of the film, they went with the weird filter choice and everything else about her character and acting is a disaster. By the time she tries to do some fighting of her own at the end, it's too late, we already hate her. ""Jennifer's Body"" = YES, ""Jonah Hex"" = NO.Michael Fassbender whom I loved in ""Fish Tank"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"" is thrown into a funky henchman with a neck tattoo whom from his accent I can only guess is...Irish?? Accents are all over the place in this film, but this one and this character takes the cake for weirdness. He seems to be a jaunty assassin that enjoys his task of finishing Jonah Hex so much that he keeps getting distracted and letting the man get away. His final fight scene ends very anticlimactically with a result that seems VERY PG13 for what was supposed to have happened to him. Maybe they should have gone big or gone home with an R rating to boost up the violence to a level that would more properly express the grittiness of tone throughout.John Malkovich uses flat proper annunciation to be a villain once more as is his trademark. Turnbull is seeking out weapons of mass destruction to use against a centennial celebration not for any specific revenge, but just to blow stuff up apparently. Faking his own death got Hex off the trail, but once Turnbull is out and about causing a ruckus again, the U.S. Military comes crawling back to Jonah Hex, the only man they believe can stop him with promises of a blanket pardon if he succeeds. Being flat and emotionless usually works in rival to a passionate hero, but when both protagonist and antagonist come off as one-note, the whole vengeance plot feels bland and pointless.Probably the coolest moments of the movie are when Jonah Hex reanimates dead people, but that is mostly on the CGI end and not the acting at all.""Jonah Hex"" is a little painful and ugly from start to finish. A little jumpy, filled with flashbacks and a recurring vengeance dream that seems nonsensical and like it should have been cut altogether. Better to steer clear of this one, you'd be better off with an action-comedy like ""The A-Team"" or ""Knight and Day"" shockingly.",1,Josh Brolin & Megan Fox both speak flatly to each other with ill-disguised contempt masquerading as love,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,4557,"['Jonah', 'Hex', 'was', 'directed', 'Jimmy', 'Hayward', 'who', 'was', 'director', 'actor', 'Horton', 'Who', 'clearly', 'was', 'right', 'choice', 'job', '*insert', 'sarcasm', 'here*', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'branded', 'ex-Confederate', 'Soldier', 'turned', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'path', 'vengeance', 'Quentin', 'Turnbull', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'wife', 'child.Unfamiliar', 'comic', 'book', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'lone', 'gunslinger', 'wild', 'west', 'tale', 'instead', 'got', 'warped', 'CGI', 'explosion', 'heavy', 'shoddy', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'action', 'flick', 'South', 'Carolina', 'Were', 'there', 'ever', 'deserts', 'South', 'Carolina', 'first', 'instinct', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'inconsistent/uneven', 'would', 'have', 'imply', 'parts', 'were', 'good', 'parts', 'were', 'bad', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'parts', 'were', 'good.When', 'tagline', 'Revenge', 'Ugly', 'were', ""n't"", 'kidding', 'Brolin', 'face', 'so', 'ugly', 'personality', 'almost', 'impossible', 'cheer', 'gruff', 'maybe', 'challenge', 'working', 'side', 'mouth', 'clenched', 'deformity', 'half-hearted', 'quips', 'never', 'pay', 'off', 'never', 'get', 'impression', 'actually', 'cares', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'character', 'scenes', 'have', 'chilly', 'chemistry', 'Let', 'get', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'Lilah', 'right', 'start', 'pretty', 'unlikable', 'character', 'hypocrite', 'chasing', 'off', 'John', 'who', 'run', 'away', 'big', 'city', 'only', 'suggest', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'do', 'same', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'body', 'good', 'dress', 'know', 'striking', 'young', 'lady', 'even', 'all-natural', 'look', 'was', 'sporting', 'cosmetics-wise', 'someone', 'came', 'up', 'horrible', 'idea', 'give', 'blurry', 'Barbara', 'Walters', 'filter', 'EVERY', 'shot', 'ease', 'off', 'high', 'definition', 'detail', 'might', 'expose', 'reality', 'where', 'pores', '*gasp*', 'super', 'distracting', 'character', 'ought', 'have', 'angel', 'wings', 'something', 'when', 'attitude', 'morals', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'farther', 'away', 'accent', 'painful', 'remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'world', 'have', 'multiple', 'choose', 'when', 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'line', 'delivery', 'hear', 'here', 'best', 'director', 'got', 'Wow', 'Bad', 'choice', 'all', 'cast', 'looks-wise', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'work', 'instead', 'making', 'real', 'gritty', 'consistent', 'rest', 'film', 'went', 'weird', 'filter', 'choice', 'everything', 'else', 'character', 'acting', 'disaster', 'time', 'do', 'fighting', 'own', 'end', 'too', 'late', 'already', 'hate', 'Jennifer', 'Body', '=', 'YES', 'Jonah', 'Hex', '=', 'NO.Michael', 'Fassbender', 'whom', 'loved', 'Fish', 'Tank', 'Inglourious', 'Basterds', 'thrown', 'funky', 'henchman', 'neck', 'tattoo', 'whom', 'accent', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'Irish', 'Accents', 'are', 'place', 'film', 'one', 'character', 'cake', 'weirdness', 'be', 'jaunty', 'assassin', 'task', 'finishing', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'so', 'much', 'getting', 'distracted', 'letting', 'man', 'get', 'away', 'final', 'fight', 'scene', 'very', 'anticlimactically', 'result', 'VERY', 'PG13', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'happened', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'big', 'gone', 'home', 'R', 'rating', 'boost', 'up', 'violence', 'level', 'would', 'more', 'properly', 'express', 'grittiness', 'tone', 'throughout.John', 'Malkovich', 'flat', 'proper', 'annunciation', 'be', 'villain', 'once', 'more', 'trademark', 'Turnbull', 'seeking', 'out', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'use', 'centennial', 'celebration', 'not', 'specific', 'revenge', 'just', 'blow', 'stuff', 'up', 'apparently', 'Faking', 'own', 'death', 'got', 'Hex', 'trail', 'once', 'Turnbull', 'out', 'causing', 'ruckus', 'again', 'U.S.', 'Military', 'crawling', 'back', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'only', 'man', 'believe', 'can', 'stop', 'promises', 'blanket', 'pardon', 'Being', 'flat', 'emotionless', 'usually', 'rival', 'passionate', 'hero', 'when', 'protagonist', 'antagonist', 'come', 'off', 'one-note', 'whole', 'vengeance', 'plot', 'feels', 'bland', 'pointless.Probably', 'coolest', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'when', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'dead', 'people', 'mostly', 'CGI', 'end', 'not', 'acting', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'little', 'painful', 'ugly', 'start', 'finish', 'little', 'jumpy', 'filled', 'flashbacks', 'recurring', 'vengeance', 'dream', 'nonsensical', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'altogether', 'Better', 'steer', 'clear', 'one', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'action-comedy', 'A-Team', 'Knight', 'Day', 'shockingly']",N/A

You'd think that combining horror and Wild Western action would be a win-win, right? But somehow it ends up being a forgettable train wreck by the time it concludes.Jonah Hex fights for the Confederacy until his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull gives the order to attack a hospital. Turnbull's son draws on Hex because of his refusal to attack and is shot dead. Quentin Turnbull doesn't take kindly to his son being killed and hunts down Jonah Hex at his home. Turnbull ties Hex to a cross outside of his home and burns the house down with his wife and son inside, forcing him to watch. Turnbull also brands Hex's face with a hot iron, disfiguring him. Hex hangs on the cross for days, dying until Crow Indians find and rescue the dying man. Using an assortment of magical techniques they somehow manage to bring Hex back from near death. Now the former Confederate soldier has a mysterious power that grants him the ability to bring people back to life for a limited amount of time.Hex wants revenge but Turnbull dies in a hotel fire before he can extract it. Doing what he knows best, Jonah takes up bounty hunting and soon becomes well-known. It isn't long before Turnbull turns up in a train robbery looking quite well for a dead man. It seems that Turnbull plans to destroy the United States government using a weapon of mass destruction that looks like Dragon Balls (you know, from Dragon Ball Z?).The film starts out quite promising. I enjoyed the first fifteen minutes but unfortunately it was all downhill from there. Josh Brolin does a fine job as Hex but the character doesn't have much depth to him. Lilah, Jonah's prostitute love interest played by Megan Fox seems like an almost thrown in character who has virtually no back story. We're never told why she cares for Hex or for that matter why she's a whore. As in her other movies, Megan Fox is nice to look at but as an actress she's downright terrible (especially in this role).While I don't think it would have saved the film, the PG-13 rating is incredibly limiting for a Western that is supposed to have horror elements such as this one. I'm not saying that blood, violence and gore are the answer to all the negatives found in Jonah Hex (or any other film for that matter) by any means but without limitations the action sequences could have at least been more satisfying. Sadly, like most of the film, with the exception of the first town shootout, the action feels very bland and thrown together.The soundtrack doesn't do it any favors either, sounding like a typical late 90's action film with its roaring orchestral score and occasional electric guitar rifts. Perhaps the composers should have listened to some of Ennio Morricone's works for inspiration.Maybe its nit-picking but the special weapons in this film just look dumb. They're incredibly cheesy and just so uncreative. If you look at a film like Van Helsing where the vampire hunter uses a variety if nifty artillery in cool ways and compare it to Jonah Hex one cannot help but sigh at the lackluster efforts. Between the lousy looking guns at the utterly stupid looking Dragon Ball weapons of mass destruction, you're left to wonder just who designed the props for this movie.At a running time of about 80 minutes it's story is lackluster and feels thrown together. A majority of the action sequences are dull, the acting is fairly sub-par on all fronts and even the films score stands out as a negative. I seriously wonder how this film got a theatrical release. Had it been a SyFi original movie I would have at least given it a little leeway but perhaps that's being too kind because I've honestly seen far better SyFy original movies such as Ghost Town. I went in really wanting to like Jonah Hex and to disagree with the critics who ripped on it. After all, I love horror films and I love well-done Western films but in the end, Jonah Hex fails to be a good Western or horror film.

Supernatural ghost whisperer, however, is a show with Jennifer Love Hewitt.  And until that gets on Showtime and gets a little more risqu&eacute; it's not going to draw in the male audience.  Therein lies the problem with Jonah Hex (and Wild Wild West); one bad apple spoils the bunch.  Add to that a script written by a clearly confused screenwriter and direction from someone who gets lost in a single-stall bathroom.  Only Hollywood could screw up the story of a guy who turned into a Wild West bounty hunter after a life in which his prostitute mother runs away, his father sells him into slavery with an Indian tribe, he fights in the Civil War (South), gets accused of being a traitor, shoots Stonewall Jackson, has his wife murdered the day before the wedding (some would call this a lucky break), and is disgraced in an Indian battle to the death and branded with a searing hot tomahawk to his cheek.  Jimmy Hayward should never be allowed to direct again.Whatever, it's not like they tried to introduce the characters at all.  Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin - decent performance) gets his history changed, and all we know is he has an enemy, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich - going through the motions), who murdered Hex's family after Hex supposedly betrayed his fellow soldiers. Turnbull is the most shallow character Malkovich has ever played.  Inserted purely because a movie needs an antagonist.  Speaking of pointless characters, Michael Fassbender is completely wasted, and they may as well have blind-folded Megan Fox, gagged her, stuffed her into a corset fitted for an anorexic, thrown her into bed, forced her to play the role of a prostitute, and zoomed closely on her pouring assets.  Crossing my fingers for an extended edition.Beyond that, ridiculousness abounds.  Saddle mounted Gatling guns that don't bother the horse (but dragging a fat guy is too much for the trusty steed).

He thought he lost the chance when he found out that Quintin died in a fire, but it turns out that Quintin faked his death. Jonah never could take his anger out on Quintin, so now's his chance.Brolin is usually always good, but this movie gives him nothing to do but look angry with one bad one liner after another. While Megan Fox just plays off her looks like she did in Jennifer's Body and most of her lines are vain one-liners about how hot she is. The movie has better actors like Aiden Quinn and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Supernatural season 1, Watchmen and Losers) in very small roles.But if they had longer appearances and Fox wasn't in the movie at all, I think Jonah Hex would still be bad. Jonah Hex isn't that interesting for instance, mostly do to the fact that you know he'll get revenge on the guy that did him wrong. I've seen plenty of better revenge westerns starring Clint Eastwood for instance, to know Jonah will get his revenge.

1305614,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B002ZG982S,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[2, 4]","I will probably draw heat for this review, as I have for some of my other comic book cum movie reviews, but so be it. I have not read the comic book so this review is strictly based on the movie, JONAH HEX.Set in the recently-post Civil War America, JONAH HEX is the story of a man driven by vengeance. During the closing days of the Confederacy, Jonah was ordered to destroy a hospital. When he refused, his commanding officer burned Jonah's family alive, forcing Jonah to watch. The commander then brands Jonah's face and leaves him to die, although he says the brand is so Jonah always remembers who did this to him. The Crow Indians rescue Jonah from the brink of death, leaving him with the ability to talk to, and torture, the dead. So Jonah sets out to kill his old CO who is now planning to destroy Washington DC with a super weapon.That is the basic story line of JONAH HEX, and you get most of it in the first few minutes of the movie. But what struck me was the similarity to the old Wild Wild West television series. In every blessed episode, we saw James West, the Secret Service agent, thwarting an evil genius who was trying destroy something. Jonah isn't as pretty as Jim West, but his role is the same. In the series, we had Artemis Gordon acting as a sort of M from James Bond. In JONAH HEX, we had Agent Broils from the Fringe series supplying horse-mounted Gatling guns and incendiary crossbows. In Wild Wild West, Jim's boss was President Grant. In JONAH HEX, he was working for President Grant. And of course, there are the pretty girls present in both.As I sat watching JONAH HEX, thinking about The Wild Wild West series, I realized how flat the movie is. The characters are cardboard, the plot is pointless, and even the visuals are ordinary. The acting was passable but not remarkable. The actors read their lines but they didn't own their characters. I started imaging other actors in those roles and found that it was a very easy exercise. In fact, it might have been a better movie if they had gotten unknowns to play the main roles.I'm giving JONAH HEX 3 stars because it didn't offend me and because no one used the word, ""Friend-O."" It just wasn't an exciting or even interesting movie, but if you have some ironing to do, this might fill the bill for something to have on in the background.",3,Not-So-Wild West,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,2323,"['will', 'probably', 'draw', 'heat', 'review', 'have', 'other', 'comic', 'book', 'cum', 'movie', 'reviews', 'so', 'be', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'comic', 'book', 'so', 'review', 'strictly', 'based', 'movie', 'JONAH', 'HEX.Set', 'recently-post', 'Civil', 'War', 'America', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'story', 'man', 'driven', 'vengeance', 'closing', 'days', 'Confederacy', 'Jonah', 'was', 'ordered', 'destroy', 'hospital', 'When', 'refused', 'commanding', 'officer', 'burned', 'Jonah', 'family', 'alive', 'forcing', 'Jonah', 'watch', 'commander', 'then', 'Jonah', 'face', 'die', 'brand', 'so', 'Jonah', 'always', 'remembers', 'who', 'did', 'Crow', 'Indians', 'rescue', 'Jonah', 'brink', 'death', 'leaving', 'ability', 'talk', 'torture', 'dead', 'So', 'Jonah', 'out', 'kill', 'old', 'CO', 'who', 'now', 'planning', 'destroy', 'Washington', 'DC', 'super', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'get', 'most', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'what', 'struck', 'was', 'similarity', 'old', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'television', 'series', 'blessed', 'episode', 'saw', 'James', 'West', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'thwarting', 'evil', 'genius', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'destroy', 'something', 'Jonah', ""n't"", 'as', 'pretty', 'Jim', 'West', 'role', 'same', 'series', 'had', 'Artemis', 'Gordon', 'acting', 'sort', 'M', 'James', 'Bond', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'had', 'Agent', 'Broils', 'Fringe', 'series', 'supplying', 'horse-mounted', 'Gatling', 'guns', 'incendiary', 'crossbows', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Jim', 'boss', 'was', 'President', 'Grant', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'was', 'working', 'President', 'Grant', 'course', 'are', 'pretty', 'girls', 'present', 'both.As', 'sat', 'watching', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'thinking', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'series', 'realized', 'how', 'flat', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'cardboard', 'plot', 'pointless', 'even', 'visuals', 'are', 'ordinary', 'acting', 'was', 'passable', 'not', 'remarkable', 'actors', 'read', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'own', 'characters', 'started', 'imaging', 'other', 'actors', 'roles', 'found', 'was', 'very', 'easy', 'exercise', 'fact', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'had', 'gotten', 'unknowns', 'play', 'main', 'roles.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'JONAH', 'HEX', '3', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'offend', 'one', 'used', 'word', 'Friend-O', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'exciting', 'even', 'interesting', 'movie', 'have', 'ironing', 'do', 'might', 'fill', 'bill', 'something', 'have', 'background']",N/A

1305624,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG982S,Mark Turner,"[6, 6]","It seems that Hollywood has fallen in love with comic book characters once again. Of course Hollywood tends to do so when a genre makes money. The success of BATMAN BEGINS and IRON MAN as well as their sequels has Hollywood realizing fans are willing to pay top dollar when their heroes are done right. But on occasion those in Hollywood still think they can do the original better and anger fans, as was the case with the release of JONAH HEX. But when looked at on its own instead of through fans eyes, this movie isn't all that bad.Josh Brolin stars as the title character; a Confederate soldier who decided there'd been enough bloodshed, killed his best friend/commander and turned in his fellow soldiers so he could get on with his life. Unfortunately his friends father was a maniacal leader named Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich) who didn't take kindly to his son's death of Hex' becoming a traitor. So he burns Hex' wife and child alive while forcing him to watch and brands his face with the letters QT.Hex survives the ordeal, is rescued by Crow Indians and finds himself with a power to communicate with the dead, apparently due to his near death experience. Revenge escapes him though with Turnbull dies in a fire. Hex, scarred for life inside and out, takes on the role of bloody avenger and becomes the deadliest bounty hunter around, taking out those who would prey on the innocent in the most brutal ways possible. And you learn all this within the first 5-10 minutes of the film!But this is a movie that last 81 minutes so we need a story. It turns out that Turnbull never really died. Instead, he's been leading a group of mercenary soldiers who still think there's a chance for the south to rise again. So much so that they've discovered a secret weapon the Union had and never put together and are now gathering the pieces to do so. Once built, cities will be set aflame and their cause will bring about a new order in America.Knowing of his past relationship with Turnbull, President Grant orders Hex be turned lose on his trail and bring Turnbull to justice. In return, Hex will receive a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed as a bounty hunter (like the killing the dirty Sheriff early in the film). Knowing who he's after means Hex cares less about the bounty and more about the man he's pursuing.Just before being ""recruited"" to set out after Turnbull we get the chance to meet Hex' girlfriend for lack of a better term. Suffice to say that Lilah (Megan Fox) uses her womanly ways to earn a living in the Wild West. Get it? Good. But she has a soft spot for Hex who passes on the chance to be with Lilah forever because anyone who gets close to Hex has a tendency to end up dead.As Hex follows leads to find Turnbull, we get to see his abilities come in handy. He questions a recently deceased member of Turnbull's army and later digs up his old friend, Turnbull's son, to get more information that will bring him closer to the living Turnbull. A final confrontation is sure to follow and it does. To find out if Turnbull is successful in bringing down the USA, you'll have to rent or buy the movie.The movie is beautifully shot and looks great in scene after scene be it the desert, a town out west or an abandoned fort taken over by the bad guys. The special effects, especially when Hex talks to the dead, are top of the line and believable as far as raising the dead goes. And the make up, most notably that used on Hex which involves a sort of hole in the cheek burnt face look, is done to perfection.Brolin does a solid job as Hex, a man tormented by his past, afraid of his present and uncaring of his future. One risen corpse tells him that they're waiting for him down below but it doesn't seem to faze him. He knows he'll get there eventually but he has work to do on Earth first.Fox does little more than look good but for the most part I think her fans expect little more than that. Does she have acting ability? Sure, but when your roles all call for you to be scantily clad or topless (not here) then your acting isn't what most people are looking for. I think she has the talent, let's just hope we see more of that instead of skin next time around.Malkovich does a great job of being the over the top bad guy. Heck, he does a good over the top good guy too (see his performance in RED for that). Here he has little to work with but makes what he has work for him. He's mean as can be and that makes you root more for Hex.On the whole the movie offers an enjoyable night's entertainment, delivering plenty of action and story to boot. While it may not be the movie die hard comic book fans expected, everyone else will have a good time with it. Give it a rent and afterwards you might even consider adding this one to your collection of westerns.One last note. In watching this I was expecting something that was one of the most terrible films ever made. The online world has portrayed this film as deserving of a Golden Turkey award. Viewing it from that perspective made the film far more enjoyable and less a struggle than perhaps a fan of the comic series might have with it. Viewed on its own merits as a piece of fluff entertainment, it does a great job.",4,AW HEX!,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,5213,"['Hollywood', 'fallen', 'love', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'once',

Anderson,"[0, 1]","While Jonah Hex could have potentially been a wonderful series Franchise for DC Comics, whoever makes the script/directing decisions on most of their films needs to be replaced.  There is an entire mind set about DC films that Marvel has managed to get past (true, their Hulk franchises have been weak at best and while I enjoyed their Fantastic Four movies for the characters, they suffered from some of DC's scripting/directing weaknesses which is why that series died despite wonderful actors).Westerns aren't that popular in the first place, but creepy, metaphysical stuff was hot about the time this movie came out.  But the producers/studio focused on the least interesting aspects of a magical western that they could.  Also, I think casting the lead that they did for Jonah Hex was a mistake because he didn't make a very exciting or dynamic Jonah!  It was like a made-for-TV movie in terms of actors and acting (that's usually where I see our lead at and he's Syfy Channel quality).As a fan of the comics and weird westerns more particularly, this missed the mark.  We pick a B grade actor and expect an A grade quality film?

I have a feeling however that the film makers were concerned this was the only shot they had at a Jonah Hex movie (and it probably was) and decided to tell this one instead. The problem is that the backstory is so rushed that there is not much in the way of character development. You get the basic details (Hex was a soldier in the confederate army, who refused to execute an order of his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull (played by John Malkovich) and in the process kills Turnbull's son (who also happens to be Hex's friend). Hex's family is then killed in front of him, he is branded on the cheek (giving the facial deformity) and left to die. In the process of being healed by the local Indian tribe he gains the power to talk to the dead.That is the story should have been fleshed out in detail. The entire movie clocks in around 80 min, and that story is probably given less than 20. Aside from knowing who the good guy and bad guy are, we have no real reason to be invested in any of the characters. Which is a shame given that the supporting cast is made up of some very good actors (Michel Fassbender, Lance Reddick etc). Megan Fox was pretty much the same as always. Looks pretty and has a couple good one liners, but her character is not in the movie all that much until the end. And again, there is no backstory for her character so the only reason we are supposed to care about her character is she is pretty and loves Jonah Hex.I think the movie would have been better served to have been a little longer, with the first half giving a true backstory of the events that lead up to the start of this movie, then Hex going after Turnbull initially and then his transition to a bounty hunter. If that movie did well, then a better version of this movie could have been made and with characters that people actually are invested in, they may have been able to get at least a couple movies from the story.I have never read the comics, but from reading other reviews it seems like they diverged a lot from the source material. If you are a fan of the comics and changing the story would piss you off, then I would say skip this entirely. For everyone else, the movie is entertaining enough. There are some good action sequences and the A/V quality of the movie is very good on Blu Ray.

Who doesn't enjoy seeing low-tech versions of vehicles, weapons, or common appliances from modern times appearing within films set in the past?  Examples from past films include huge dirigibles, colossal flying platforms, mega frigates, and so on.  One weapon that fits this category is the automatic crossbow from ""Van Helsing,"" pretty much the only thing I recall from the movie, probably to my benefit.  Big is almost always better, no matter what the proponents of equivalence and social niceties tell you.  I'll admit, it was only the Gatling gun-enabled horse from the preview which drew to view this steampunk western.""Jonah Hex"" is director Jimmy Hayward's (""Horton Hears a Who!"") take on the graphic novel series of the same name.  Josh Brolin (""No Country for Old Men"") plays Hex, a horribly disfigured bounty hunter who lives a life of hollow pleasures.  His pointless existence began after learning that the true target of his vengeance, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich, ""Rounders,"" ""Being John Malkovich""), had perished in a hotel fire.  Turnbull had earned Jonah's ire after burning Hex's wife and son alive in their home, forcing him to watch, and then branding his face.  Turnbull justified these horrific deeds because Jonah, a confederate solider, had betrayed his own regiment, killing Quentin's son Jeb in the course of events.  Further complicating these double-sided rationalizations is Jonah's belief that he was serving the cause of good in his betrayal of Jeb and the Confederacy.  The movie's plot grinds forward with President Grant learning two things:  Turnbull is still alive, and is planning to destroy the Union on the eve of its 100th birthday via the use of a country-killing Device.*possible spoilers below*This movie employs many nifty gimmicks to garner interest, but it'll depend on the viewer's taste how successful they tend to be.  For myself, I felt they enhanced the experience to a tolerable and even enjoyable level.  Without these little details, the plot, acting, and pace wouldn't be able to sustain the attention of most audience members.  For example, Jonah is not only an experienced bounty hunter, he is something of a necromancer, being able to speak with the dead.  He can coerce them to reveal the locations of his enemies, as well as other information.  Each encounter with the dead was very well scripted and filmed, but the pinnacle was when Hex spoke with Jeb Turnbull, Quentin's son who Jonah himself killed.  The moral and philosophical questions raised, as well as the mutual agony felt by Jonah and Jeb by their own equal but opposite set paths, felt quite mature for a film of this genre.Further, the gigantism involving many aspects of the movie--such as massive ironclads and cannon balls--was fun and added to the levity.  Several dreamlike sequences, during which Jonah internalizes and interprets his current struggles with Turnbull, deepened the moral struggles of our protagonist.  As I've mentioned previously, Gatling guns are always cool, and Jonah dual-wielding them on his horse worked in this film.  It worked in a ridiculous way, but then that makes all the difference, now doesn't it?*end possible spoilers*The relative merit of mature moral subject matter aside, this movie has more than a smattering of problems which tarnish Hex's silver spurs.  In a couple of scenes detailing Jonah's hunt for Turnbull, it is less than obvious to the audience where he is going, why he is there, and how he came to decide to go there.  Another reviewer commented that the movie seems heavily edited--if true, this would partially explain the confusing transitions.  This brevity permeates the entire movie, not just Hex's detective work.  His romance with Lilah (Megan Fox, ""Transformers"") feels about as satisfying from a story perspective as the water left in a sieve is as refreshment.  Jonah's rescue from certain doom is a trippy mess of confusing symbolism.  Too little time is lavished on Burke, (Michael Fassbender, ""Inglourious Basterds"") a fascinatingly sociopathic character with whom Fassbender steals every scene.  Finally, Jonah Hex's final confrontation with Turnbull (as well as his post-win ""get the girl"" scene) seems a forced and inadequate foregone conclusion.  One never got the sense that Jonah, his girl, or his nation were ever in any real danger, no matter how convincing Malkovich's or Fassbender's acting.Having been unfamiliar with ""Jonah Hex"" prior to seeing this movie, I was able to see and enjoy this movie without preconceptions one way or another.  One reviewer stated that Jonah is bereft of mystical powers in the comic series, and this detracted from the experience for him.  I can understand how it would, and am a little confused why filmmakers would insert these elements had they not been present before--no one better give my precious Scrooge McDuck comics any magical overtones!  However, as a veritable blind man to the mythos of the comics, I enjoyed Jonah Hex for how it was portrayed:  A spin on the classic Western movie featuring a haunted protagonist who resembles Eastwood's ""Stranger"" in more than a few ways.  It's not ""Tombstone,"" or ""The Wild Bunch,"" and maybe not even purist ""Hex"" on the silver screen, but it is good fun for an hour or so.  Many good-to-strong performances were enough to make me at least consider watching the sequel, should one be made.",3,"""Jonah Hex"" manages to carve a bit of scar tissue into our hearts to remember

Well, that's not the case here. First off, the movie is only 72 minutes long if you take away the end credits. They spent no time developing any of the characters, so I never really cared about any of them. Maybe a director's cut will be released on DVD, because this movie really needed another 30 minutes.Josh Brolin is a fine actor and he is the best thing about the movie, but even he seems a little bored with the whole thing at times. He does get some good one-liners along the way. John Malkovich is just here for a paycheck. Talk about a villain that will put you to sleep. His whole evil plan has been done a million times before. We all know Megan Fox looks great, but can she act? The answer is still no. She's not too bad here, especially when compared with her previous work, but her character is really unnecessary. It also seemed like they enhanced her face with some CGI touch up in certain scenes, as if to make her best asset even more flawless.The CGI is okay, the music is way too in your face, and the story leaves a lot to be desired, but Jonah Hex doesn't fall into the abysmal territory of The Wild Wild West. It at least has some relatively fun sequences. It's just too silly, even though it takes itself way too seriously. Does that make sense? Probably about as much sense as strapping two gatling guns to the sides of your horse, only to never see them again after they worked so well in the opening shootout.

Regardless, here we are with Josh Brolin no less playing the scarred bounty hunter, and John Malkovich playing his nemesis Turnbull.  The surprising production values and the even more surprisingly noteworthy cast of actors could have really combined to make Jonah Hex a worthwhile comic adaptation, but sadly, the end result isn't anything really worth writing home about, albeit the film itself is not nearly as terrible as early teasers and its poor box office had suggested.  Hex is on Turnbull's tail as the villain plans to watch America burn in flames during its centennial event, with Hex's partner being that of a prostitute (Megan Fox, because they figured eye candy would be better than Hex's male comic ally Batlash).  A majority of the action scenes are shallow, not to mention the violence of which and authenticity of the old west are just watered down to comply with the PG-13 rating.  Still, Brolin is decent enough as Hex (and the prosthetic makeup isn't bad either), Malkovich mails it in, Fox's brief role is nothing more than said eye-candy, and even other actors such as Will Arnett, Aidan Quinn, Lance Reddick, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in an uncredited cameo don't seem to have too much interest in the proceedings.  Michael Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds and soon to be seen as the young Magneto in the X-Men prequel) isn't bad as Turnbull's irish, tattooed henchman, but that's pretty much it.

1305645,A2VS8JFNTISI3L,B002ZG982S,"Out Of Your Element Donny ""The Noir The Merrier""","[0, 1]","I bought this disc for five dollars, so I'm not one to complain so much as others.  And unlike other reviewers the steampunk and exaggerated tones didn't bother me at all.  You get what you pay for. I really wanted to like this film, despite the spate of lousy reviews it received at its release.That it didn't follow the traditional Jonah Hex origin was not a concern to me; I like the comic, but Hex is not so well known as Superman that he rebukes a revisionist take on his story. I like Brolin and Malkovich, I love westerns when they are fun (*Brisco County Jr.* from the tube is a particular favorite, and it too used fantasy elements--but Brisco had charisma and humor, and I cared about the characters, even the villains. . . .), and I enjoy comic book adaptations.Unfortunately, one point not too fully addressed in other reviews is my greatest pain with this film--its production quality is so darned DARK, the viewer can't tell what in God's name is going on for roughly thirty percent of the film.I realize the tone is supposed to be fiercely unrepentant and ""dark hearted,"" as per the protagonist's suffering. But here the form does not assist the content. A couple otherwise strong action sequences could have been much more effective if the light supervisor had allowed us to see who was who and what was taking place. Shadows are key in noir projects, but in classic films the audience can actually SEE what is happening. I tried turning off every light in the house to see if perhaps the director was shooting with subtle shades and tones to up the ""heart of darkness"" of the principals.  No. Getting up close to the screen didn't even help--and we have a good high definition screen.So it becomes difficult to assess the relative merits of a film shot without benefit of a flashlight. Still, here are a couple other simple opinions:*Megan Fox continues her ability to register emotions from A to Z, while capitalizing on her cleavage. Truly, this character is fleshed out only in appearance--Fox had very little to do except hit her mark and allow the wan light to illumine her figure. Oh yes, and she shot a gun a couple times.*Josh Brolin is a strong actor, but again the script gives him little to do but react with a sneer (which is part of the Hex personna anyway). His voice-over is sparse and ultimately unnecessary, a crutch the narrative does not need if it shows nuance on the screen. (But then we've already discussed why that's a problem. . . .)*John Malkovich could have been a great villain. Here he becomes a puppet to the machinery.  He's not given the chance even to chew the scenery--he doesn't have one scene where he can even gum it. Credit the screenplay with that loss.*It's only 72 minutes not counting the credits! Unless you're Bergman or Fellini, or Disney for that matter, most filmmakers can't tell a full story in a little over one hour--it comes off as underdeveloped, unrealized and ultimately uninvolving. Maybe this could have been a TV movie director's first outing, given the constraints of the one-hour format. Then it might have been worth coming back to the following week to develop the characters and story more.*Further, the DVD does not offer scene selections--perhaps the company determined there were not enough scenes to opt for that feature. This is a bare bones disc--a few deleted scenes, again piled one after another without a listing of how many or of what nature they are.*The whole production provokes two reactions in me: How I wish it had been helmed by Sam Raimi (I love *The Quick and the Dead* for its wry ""playing"" with the genre; I can forgive many quasi-goofy revisionist takes in that film because the people involved seem to be having so much FUN making it); and why is everyone, including Wil Arnett, sleepwalking through the show? Outside of a menacing tribal ""exorcism"" sequence involving crows and spirits, there's very little genuine emotion going on here.  The whole film strikes me as an exercise in stoicism. For the audience's sake, lighten up! (Literally in its shooting, and figuratively in the screenplay--humanize the puppets.)It just occurs to me that, for whatever reason--studio interfering, a rush to production, who knows?--very few people seemed to care about this film.  And by extension, much of the audience responds in kind.  I would rate the film a two for what it could have been; the DVD gets a two as well--for, again, a lack of care exercised.

'People', whomever they are, many who probably have never seen the film, or ever watched a western in their life, have shown nothing but disdain for this film. 'Jonah Hex' is simply one of the best westerns to come along since 'Outlaw Josey Wales' (one of Clint Eastwood's best westerns). Forget about the bad marketing by Warner Bros. Forget about Megan Fox's 'image' (she is tough and very sexy in her limited scenes here). Josh Brolin, who, in interviews, says the film should be taken as camp, is correct. This is a supernatural western. This is a no-holds barred, shoot'em up, explosion filled, ghostly (originally from DC's Weird Tales) and fantastic western that blows the socks off of the viewer - if only the viewer were to take a second glance at it. Brolin is fantastic as the horribly scarred bounty hunter. The actor IS Jonah Hex (never a doubt). John Malkovich shows he's still as villainous as ever. And Fox is fine (forget that 'Transformers' crap, she is good in this). Even Aidan Quinn shows up as President Grant. This is a high class production, and the best western (and, alas, there are so few) to come out of Hollywood in some time. If it doesn't jive with the comic book exactly - and it doesn't - so what. Jonah Hex isn't Batman or Superman, he isn't Ironman or Spider-Man. Who cares? He is a unique character who deserves another chance at building an audience. Maybe DC will make it happen. But I really implore you. 'Jonah Hex' is a great western. Maybe you're expecting 'Hamlet' here, or even 'Twilight' or 'Toy Story'. This is Jonah Hex. He stands on his own. And if you do see it again (or for the first time for those fakers), you will see just how mind-blowing this film can be. I can't wait for the DVD to show up. I pray the director's cut last longer than 75 minutes. PEOPLE: Give it one more chance. I implore you. For most of you, you WILL be pleasantly surprised at how good 'Jonah Hex' really is.

But the film was not bad all.Sure it's not ""according to Hoyle"" per the DC Comics canon, but so what?  It's a western.  And what a western it was -- very dark however, and not a lot of humor in it.Even so, Jonah Hex as a man whose only sin was to disobey Confederate orders to burn a hospital and killed those who got in his way, was himself forced to watch his own wife and son die at the hands of his commanding officer, Turnbull.Hex was tortured and half-dead; through some Indian magic and medicine, Hex gained the ability to talk to the dead.  I guess the pun horse (or ghost) whisperer comes to mind!  The film does not overuse this feature and is mostly a shoot-em-up, gun slinging story about a man who is given a second chance, although is methods are not exactly moral or legal.It is chilling when Hex is told by a man he had killed some time back that Hell has a special treatment for him.  He can wait.  First, he must hunt down Turnbull and stop him from using an extraordinary weapon that can level cities.The fact of a weapon of such magnitude and thus the South shall rise again was a bit unreal and I don't believe such was possible in 1876 (the time of this story).Megan Fox plays Lilah the prostitute and though her part is small, she looks great playing it.Bottom Line:The whole film is stylized, like watching a slicked-up version of The Wild, Wild West.  I have no idea if this film will ever see a sequel but the only thing wrong with it was its darkness and unrealistic premises.The beginning of the film with its horrific start and torture and burning of family is indeed shocking.  The animation at the beginning is neat and stylized and the fading into reality is fun to watch.  The whole bounty hunter thing is touched on but not played up enough.The rapid fire editing and dark (underexposed) picture in many parts is hard to follow.  And things are burning.  Lots of fire and burning.  Sadly, the generally unfavorable reviews and the film not even getting close to breaking even with its $47 million budget could explain why we won't see a sequel soon.If the film stuck to the original Jonah Hex comics and drew a story out of that, stick to more Western and less hocus pocus (and a different gal than the cute but couldn't act her way out of a tight corset Megan Fox) then we would have seen a fun film worth watching.Still, fun to watch for its dark themes!  Wish there was more gun slinging and humor, and less ghost/mystery stuff.  Oh yeah, a more coherent plot would have been nice, too.DVD:  The DVD had a bunch of previews for upcoming films, but no special features, no ""making of"" or anything.

Because, well, it doesn't have either. You know what though? That is just fine.Sometimes all I really want is some mindless fun. A movie where I don't need to spend too much time analyzing it. Jonah Hex is definitely that kind of movie. It's like a roller coaster, it's fun while it lasts but it won't leave any real lasting effect on you.Brolin pulls off the haunted/mysterious/bad-ass cowboy perfectly. Malkovich is what he is best at, a creepy villain. And Fox, well, she also does well what she normally does, acts sexy and keeps her dialogue to a minimum. The action sequences are well done, the gun fights are engaging, and the ending is satisfying. So yea, you could say I enjoyed this film.A lot of people are complaining about the length of it. I am honestly glad it didn't drag itself out too long though. When there isn't much of a storyline, it's pointless to try and stretch it out to make a 2 hour film. Often times what happens is there is a lot of added fluff which just drags the film down. So even though the movie is only 80 minutes long, it's a tight 80 minutes which gets right to the point with everything, storyline, character development, and action sequences.I would really recommend giving this movie a shot.

1305659,A246YIFE5M6M2C,B002ZG982S,"Shawn Kovacich ""Shawn Kovacich""","[5, 8]","Well I just got back from the midnight showing of this movie and I have to honestly admit that I am both surprised and disappointed in this movie. Being a HUGE Jonah Hex fan since the 70's, I have been anxiously awaiting a good movie adaptation of the comic books, and after watching this movie, I am still waiting.Josh Brolin did an okay job in his portrayal of Jonah Hex and there were times in the movie that I thought he aced it, and then there were other times that I found myself very disappointed. Megan Fox was actually a good surprise because I don't particularly care for her, but she did an okay performance as the whore Leila, which I can't imagine was much of a stretch in the acting department. John Malkovich of course turns in an outstanding job playing the villain, Quentin Turnbull, and I really couldn't find any flaws in his performance.The storyline was reminiscent of theWild Wild Westremake with Will Smith and Kevin Kline in that it had to have a ridiculous plot element of some kind of super weapon instead of sticking with a good old fashioned and believable western plot. Although admittedly this plot line was much better than the giant mechanical spider, but not by much. I found myself wondering why the powers that be who oversaw the making of this film didn't make sure it had a reasonable plot line and script like such movies as;The Outlaw Josey WalesandUnforgivenboth of which starred Clint Eastwood, who in my opinion should have been picked to play Jonah Hex if they movie was made back in the 70's or even early 80's.I did however find myself not being to upset over the supernatural element that was showcased in this film, even though it doesn't appear in the original comic books. Although there were some elements of the story that were totally wrong and should have been corrected and/or included in this film. They are as follows:1. Jonah Hex carried two ivory handled Colt Dragoons in .45 caliber. One in a single holster, and the other tucked in behind his gun belt.2. Jonah also carried a Bowie knife hidden in the back of his jacket where it could be reached by grabbing it from the back of his neck.3. Jonah also occasionally carried and used a tomahawk, not a hatchet.4. Jonah was scarred by the Apache Indians after killing the Chief's son, not by Quentin Turnbull.5. Jonah was never married until years later when he married a Chinese girl named Mei-Ling.6. Jonah absolutely never carried two Gatling Guns, one on each side of his horse. This is absolutely ridiculous and was a major sore spot with me in this movie.7. Crossbow pistols that shoot sticks of dynamite? Okay then, why didn't they also include the mechanical spider and really make it believable?8. This movie came in at just under 90 minutes, so why not put in an additional 30 minutes and show the true origins of Jonah from his childhood up to being sold into slavery to the Apaches by his drunk and abusive father after his whore of a mother left him alone with his father.9. Also with the additional 30 minutes, they could have shown how his good friend Jeb Turnbull actually was killed in the POW camp escape after Jonah was framed by the camp commandant.10. And finally, there should have been a few more scenes of Jonah as an actual bounty hunter, even a montage of sorts would have been okay.If you are a Jonah Hex fan you are going to be very disappointed with this movie. If you aren't, or perhaps are just an occasional fan, then you may find it more enjoyable than I did. For all of us true Jonah Hex fans, I would recommend sticking with the comic books both the original series and the new ones that are out, you will be much happier than watching this horrible big screen adaption. I just picked up this Jonah Hex origins graphic novelJonah Hex: No Way Backand am very pleased with it. I highly recommend that you read it as well.Shawn KovacichRabid Jonah Hex FanAuthor of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.",3,"An Embarrassment To The Comic Book, But Better Than I Expected, But Not By Much!",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,3957,"['Well', 'just', 'got', 'back', 'midnight', 'showing', 'movie', 'have', 'honestly', 'am', 'surprised', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Being', 'HUGE', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'fan', '70', 'have', 'been', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'good', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'comic', 'books', 'watching', 'movie', 'am', 'still', 'waiting.Josh', 'Brolin', 'did', 'okay', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'were', 'times', 'movie', 'thought', 'aced', 'then', 'were', 'other', 'times', 'found', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'surprise', 'do', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'did', 'okay', 'performance', 'whore', 'Leila', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'was', 'much', 'stretch', 'acting', 'department', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'course', 'turns', 'outstanding', 'job', 'playing', 'villain', 'Quentin', 'Turnbull', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'flaws', 'performance.The', 'storyline', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'theWild', 'Wild', 'Westremake', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'had', 'have', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'element', 'kind', 'super', 'weapon', 'instead', 'sticking', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'believable', 'western', 'plot', 'admittedly', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'giant', 'mechanical', 'spider', 'not', 'much', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'powers', 'be', 'who', 'oversaw', 'making', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sure', 'had', 'reasonable', 'plot', 'line', 'script', 'such', 'movies', 'Outlaw', 'Josey', 'WalesandUnforgivenboth', 'starred', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'who', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'play', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'back', '70', 'even', 'early', ""80's.I"", 'did', 'however', 'find', 'not', 'being', 'upset', 'supernatural', 'element', 'was', 'showcased', 'film', 'even', ""n't"", 'appear', 'original', 'comic', 'books', 'were', 'elements', 'story', 'were', 'totally', 'wrong', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'corrected', 'and/or', 'included', 'film', 'are', 'follows:1', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'carried', 'two', 'ivory', 'handled', 'Colt', 'Dragoons', '.45', 'caliber', 'One', 'single', 'holster', 'other', 'tucked', 'gun', 'belt.2', 'Jonah', 'also', 'carried', 'Bowie', 'knife', 'hidden', 'back', 'jacket', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'reached', 'grabbing', 'back', 'neck.3', 'Jonah', 'also', 'occasionally', 'carried', 'used', 'tomahawk', 'not', 'hatchet.4', 'Jonah', 'was', 'scarred', 'Apache', 'Indians', 'killing', 'Chief', 'son', 'not', 'Quentin', 'Turnbull.5', 'Jonah', 'was', 'never', 'married', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'married', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'named', 'Mei-Ling.6', 'Jonah', 'absolutely', 'never', 'carried', 'two', 'Gatling', 'Guns', 'one', 'side', 'horse', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'was', 'major', 'sore', 'spot', 'movie.7', 'Crossbow', 'shoot', 'sticks', 'dynamite', 'Okay', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'also', 'include', 'mechanical', 'spider', 'really', 'make', 'believable', '8', 'movie', 'came', 'just', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'put', 'additional', '30', 'minutes', 'show', 'true', 'origins', 'Jonah', 'childhood', 'up', 'being', 'sold', 'slavery', 'Apaches', 'drunk', 'abusive', 'father', 'whore', 'mother', 'left', 'alone', 'father.9', 'Also', 'additional', '30', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'shown', 'how', 'good', 'friend', 'Jeb', 'Turnbull', 'actually', 'was', 'killed', 'POW', 'camp', 'escape', 'Jonah', 'was', 'framed', 'camp', 'commandant.10', 'finally', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'Jonah', 'actual', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'even', 'montage', 'sorts', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'fan', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'are', 'just', 'occasional', 'fan', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'true', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'fans', 'would', 'recommend', 'sticking', 'comic', 'books', 'original', 'series', 'new', 'ones', 'are', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'happier', 'watching', 'horrible', 'big', 'screen', 'adaption', 'just', 'picked', 'up', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'graphic', 'novelJonah', 'Hex', 'Way', 'Backand', 'am', 'very', 'pleased', 'highly', 'recommend', 'read', 'well.Shawn', 'KovacichRabid', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'FanAuthor', 'Achieving', 'Kicking', 'Excellence', 'book', 'DVD', 'series']",N/A

However, Hex has an extra talent via the Crow Indians who brought him most of the way back from the dead; he can talk to corpses once he touches them. If Hex can stop the plot, he will be a free man and forgiven his Confederate and murderous bounty hunter sins. So, OK, a pretty good premise.But the movie is paced so choppily that its very tough to follow. Both Hex and Turnbull are played in a dry and droll manner, leaving Michael Fassbender to pick up the slack as the sole character to show any sparks. There are some interesting cast members here (Aidan Quinn as President Grant, and both Will Arnett and Tom Wopat are involved), but again, the convoluted script leaves little room for characther development.

Here we have a man touched by death that has a ""odd way"" about him. As he makes his way in the world and sees so many people he is close to die, he begins to wonder ""why me"" and becomes hardened. This leads him to doing some rather odd things that sometimes means fighting doom and sometimes means fighting the nearly dead but always means that he is at war with himself. In the comics he deals with some rather odd entanglements, fighting Lovecraftian beasties that are not ever friendly and are sometimes measured by the amount of tendrils they bring to a fight. In the movie it is more like a ""Wild Wild West"" film theme, with some mad butcher carving a path that allows the viewer to see what is right and what is wrong. In the comics the distinction is not so easily made.When I watched this movie, I knew it would be awkward to see that scarred face as it talked out the side of its burned mouth. What I did not expect was just how awkward the rest of the film would be. With the acting being done at a modest level and the requirements of the film being bigger guns and more perfection via explosion, the rest of the script was tame. I had wanted more, wishing and hoping, but the film was not what I had hoped for. It was, instead, tame and it asked viewers to want this in their film.There were a few interesting parts in the film, like when Jonah talked with the dead. That was interesting to see, and it was interesting to see the way they suffered. I personally liked that and I liked some of the other pieces there as well. Honestly, I liked the movie but I liked it in a B-movie kind of way. That meant that I would have given it a rounded up 4 stars BUT it was not that type of film. It was a big screen debut of a character that should have been more, could have been more, but never became what he should have been. That was sad, too, considering the promise there.If you want a film, then you may or may not like this. I picked ot up because I wanted to watch sometihng, not because it was my first choice, and that is how I got to my 4 star roundout. Still, if you want to say that you compare it to a normal silverscreener, it might be more in the 3 star arena.

And sure, the film opens with a nice gun fight sequence, but something goes wrong after a while and, despite its short running time (81 minutes including credits), the film soon becomes a long, tedious ride, with a story that doesn't know where it really wants to go.Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is a post-Civil War bounty hunter with special abilities like (only briefly) resurrecting the dead. The DC Comics anti-hero, whose family was killed by Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), agrees to work for President Grant (Aidan Quinn) only because the very terrorist plotting against the government is Turnbull himself.The script is by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, known for their works ""Crank"" and its sequel (as a writer/director team) starring Jason Statham. Perhaps their fast-paced, anything-goes style could bring something new to the weak story. I am afraid Jimmy Hayward (who served as a co-director in ""Horton Hears a Who!"") is not the best choice for this material.Players are doing their best.

1305674,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,B002ZG982S,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 1]","The new DC Comics movie ""Jonah Hex"" qualifies as a saddle-sore supernatural horse opera. Imagine the classic Clint Eastwood western ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" combined with the abominable Will Smith epic ""Wild Wild West,"" and you'll have a rough idea about what to expect from this outlandish, often incoherent, half-baked travesty. Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Jonah Hex"" boasts some rather brutal violence, but the consequences of the violence are rarely depicted. Josh Brolin toplines a capable cast as a cursed Confederate officer who has endured a near-death experience and possesses some bizarre powers. Ostensibly, this Warner Brothers' release brings into the limelight a little known DC Comics' character that appeared initially in the 1970s. Unfortunately, ""Gamer"" scenarists Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have changed several significant events and characters. First, we learn little about our anti-hero's origins. Second, Neveldine and Taylor neglect to delineate Jonah Hex's obvious supernatural capability. Mind you, Jonah Hex isn't immortal, but he can lay hands on dead men and temporarily resurrect them to satisfy his curiosity. Third, whatever charisma Neveldine and Taylor had going for them in their ""Gamer"" as well as their ""Crank"" movies never illuminates the screen in ""Jonah Hex."" Reportedly, Neveldine and Taylor were supposed to helm ""Jonah Hex,"" but they left the film after creative differences with the studio.An American Civil War prologue depicts Jonah Hex as a valiant Confederate officer leading raids against Union troops. During his voice over narration, Jonah announces that war and he were made for each other. Things drastically change later when Hex refuses to obey an order to burn a civilian hospital with the patients trapped inside. The action is relayed in expository dialogue between our hero and a dead man. When Hex refused to carry out the order, he shot his best friend, Jeb Turnball (Jeffrey Dean Morgan of ""Watchmen""), and Jeb's father, General Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich of ""Shadow of a Vampire""), tracks Hex down after the war to exact vengeance. They tie Hex to an x-shaped cross and raze his house with his wife and young child trapped inside. Before Turnball leaves, the heartless villain wields smoldering branding iron with his initials and scorches the right side of Hex's face. Crow Indians find the tortured Hex later and perform various ritualistic ceremonies that endow our hero with supernatural powers. Hex appropriates a tomahawk, warms it until it glows, and burned off the initials. As a result, our vengeance-driven hero's face is twisted into a sneer on one side with a hole in his jaw near his teeth. Everybody that confronts Hex bothers him about what happened to his countenance. Usually, Hex kills them. Sadly, our protagonist learns to his chagrin that Turnball has died in a hotel fire. Anyhow, Hex turns to a life of bounty hunting after Turnball's demise. Hex establishes a relationship a frontier call girl, Lilah (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer's Body""), who is crazy about him.Hex gets into trouble when he arrives in a two-bit town to get his bounty money for killing four brothers. Initially, the lawmen are not prepared to pay him off. They see only three bodies. Hex has the three corpses tied behind his horse, and he has dragged them through the desert. He expects them to pay him the vast sum of $100 for the quartet. One of the lawman observes that there was a fourth brother. Hex slings a bag with a head in it at the lawmen, and they decide not to honor their agreement with him. Instead, they aim to collect the $500 on Hex's head. A man with a rifle in the church bell tower blasts away at Hex, but this assassin is a terrible marksman. The lawmen empty their holsters to fire, too. Unveiling two Gatling guns hanging on either side of his horse, Hex wipes out everybody. Never mind that no horse could tote around such heavy armament. Concessions have to be made in larger-than-life movies like ""Jonah Hex,"" but Haywood doesn't make anything look cool. The Army arrives after Hex is getting out of bed with Lilah. They conscript him into the military at gun point. They have news that Quentin Turnball is alive. President Grant (Aiden Quinn of ""Practical Magic"") thinks Hex is the ideal hombre to track down murderous Turnball.Meantime, Turnball steals a massive, multi-barreled, revolving cannon devised by Eli Whitney, Sr., that will enable the user to flatten an entire town. The military has concealed the weapon. They feel that its power is too devastating. Predictably, Quentin Turnball thinks otherwise. He hijacks the train and uses dynamite to blow the Federal troops guarding the weapon sky high along with the civilian passengers. Women and children are among the soldiers. Hex exploits his power to make the dead loquacious and learns from Jeb that Quentin Turnbull is holed up at Fort Resurrection. At the fort, Hex boards the ironclad ship equipped with the weapon of vast destruction. Turnbull and his men are about to launch the ship when Hex shoots it out with the villains, but the wily villain escapes. Turnball plans to steam his warship within range of Washington, D.C., and then open fire on the centennial celebration.Of course, Hex puts the hex on Turnbull. Basically, ""Jonah Hex"" suffers from an incoherent script. We are never told exactly why the villains must fire five cannonballs and then fire a gold cannon ball that detonates the other cannon balls. The best thing that ""Horton Hears a Who!"" director Jimmy Hayward does with this formulaic western is rein it in to a mere 80 minutes. Nothing about this oater is memorable. The dialogue is forgettable, and poor Josh Brolin looks like somebody glued a slice of pepperoni pizza to his face. Megan Fox is sexy, but she isn't around long enough to make much of an impression. A bearded, long-haired John Malkovich rounds out the cast as the homicidal terrorist.",2,Nothing Hexcellent About This Jonah!!!,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,5930,"['new', 'DC', 'Comics', 'movie',

Also on that note i think half of the movies critics rate as being horrible turn out being great, its all in personal preference. I for one really liked this film, mainly because of Josh Brolin who is great in films like No Country For Old Men, and W. He makes a go of this comic book western and i think he does a good job, for what he's given to work with. Honestly i'm not a Meagan Foxx fan at all, is she pretty, yeah she's decent, can she act, no not really. John Malkovich as a bad guy is a good idea, and he at least fits his ""small"" but evil role as the sinister bad man. I don't wanna give spoilers but this movie is really easy to follow anyways.Its just all about Jonah Hex getting revenge for his wife and kids after there death. He basically rides around looking for the men who did so, but there are some very interesting twist on how he does this. He has the power to raise the dead and ask questions, and the way this is executed is very cool, to me. I guess people were just really wanting another X-men, Sin City type comic deal but you don't get that here, not from a story perspective anyways. Josh Brolin to me could definitely be the next Eastwood, he just does the silent, low tone, southern i'm going to gun you down type voice, with the attitude like he just doesnt give a #%#t. So this is just simple film, and actually pretty damn violent for PG-13, just without all the blood. So its a simple comic book western with some good acting, and over the top effects, nothing more, nothing less. And i like it more, than most, i see.:)",4,I always enjoy what others don't.,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,1652,"['think', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'Critics', 'rate', 'highly', 'are', '70', '%', 'crap', 'rest', 'good', 'Also', 'note', 'i', 'think', 'half', 'movies', 'critics', 'rate', 'being', 'horrible', 'turn', 'out', 'being', 'great', 'personal', 'preference', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'mainly', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'who', 'great', 'films', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'W.', 'go', 'comic', 'book', 'western', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'job', 'what', 'given', 'work', 'Honestly', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'Meagan', 'Foxx', 'fan', 'pretty', 'yeah', 'decent', 'can', 'act', 'not', 'really', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'idea', 'least', 'fits', 'small', 'evil', 'role', 'sinister', 'bad', 'man', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'really', 'easy', 'follow', 'anyways.Its', 'just', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'getting', 'revenge', 'wife', 'kids', 'death', 'basically', 'looking', 'men', 'who', 'did', 'so', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'twist', 'how', 'power', 'raise', 'dead', 'ask', 'questions', 'way', 'executed', 'very', 'cool', 'guess', 'people', 'were', 'just', 'really', 'wanting', 'X-men', 'Sin', 'City', 'type', 'comic', 'deal', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'not', 'story', 'perspective', 'anyways', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'could', 'definitely', 'be', 'next', 'Eastwood', 'just', 'silent', 'low', 'tone', 'southern', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'gun', 'down', 'type', 'voice', 'attitude', 'just', 'doesnt', 'give', '%', 't', 'just', 'simple', 'film', 'actually', 'pretty', 'damn', 'violent', 'PG-13', 'just', 'blood', 'simple', 'comic', 'book', 'western', 'good', 'acting', 'top', 'effects', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less', 'i', 'more', 'most', 'i', 'see']",N/A

It's like the comic come to life. Josh Brolin is fine in the eponymous role. On top of this, Megan Fox proves in her peripheral part that she's the foxiest ultra-babe on the face of the planet. Did I already mention this?At only 82 minutes, the story is simple and the pace is fast, which I don't mind since too many films overstay their welcome. But the writers did strive for some depth and that's commendable. If there was more depth and epic-ness I wouldn't hesitate to raise my rating. As it is, ""Jonah Hex"" plays like a spaghetti Western that's actually decent. Imagine the style and pizazz of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" updated to 2010, but half as long, no tedious stretches and less one-dimensional characters and you'd have a pretty good approximation of ""Jonah Hex.""One of the film's highlights is the incredible metalized score by Marco Beltrami and none other than Mastodon.

Maybe the movie-going public isn't ready, or the time isn't right for yet another, sort of, ""Revisionist-Western-Film"".  If one can call it that. The movie is an excercise in film-making, taking a relatively unknown comic-book anti-hero from the stable of DC Comics' characters, and giving it the Hollywood treatment. This reviewer is also a DC Comics fan, but only knows of the ""Jonah Hex"" character when he appeared in various ""guest-starring"" roles of other various DC Comics Universe comic books in ""time-travel-back-to-the-old-west"" stories (i.e JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA), and maybe picked up and thumbed through a couple of issues JONAH HEX or WEIRD WESTERN TALES comics over the years --(In fact, if one is to pick up the current DC Comics mini-series BATMAN: THE RETURN OF BRUCE WAYNE/ISSUE NO.4, Jonah Hex makes an appearance in that!). What makes the film stand out is pretty good casting. Josh Brolin in the title role does an excellent job and is well cast. John Malkovich plays Quentin Turnbull, Jonah Hex's antagonist. Malkovish usually plays (many-a)villians a bit over-the-top, but plays Turnbull pretty much restrained (but still evil). Other surprises in the cast are Tom (THE DUKES OF HAZARD) Wopat, Will Arnett in a non-comedic role as a Civil War Union Officer, the always reliable Aiden Quinn as President Ulysses S. Grant, and Michael Fassbender (so unrecognisable from his Lt. Hicox role in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS) as 'Burk', Turnbull's right-hand-henchman. The plot mixes elements of adventure, revenge, horror, romance, Amercian History, and modern themes of ""weapons-of-mass-destruction"" in an old-west background and is a little predictable but entertaining nontheless. The movie length itself is slightly under 90 minutes so, [they] didn't try to make it an epic-type-western. The production values of the film are just right (the Jonah Hex make-up on Josh Brolin is pretty seamless). Overall, a film worth a look if one has 80 minutes to kill (and if your a male, it's worth a look if one wants to see Megan Fox playing the saloon girl/prostitute with a heart-of-gold, Tallulah Black).",3,Jonah Hex Delivers An Entertaining Western Tale,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,2150,"['JONAH', 'HEX', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'Maybe', 'movie-going', 'public', ""n't"", 'ready', 'time', ""n't"", 'right', 'yet', 'sort', 'Revisionist-Western-Film', 'one', 'can', 'call', 'movie', 'excercise', 'film-making', 'taking', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'comic-book', 'anti-hero', 'stable', 'DC', 'Comics', 'characters', 'giving', 'Hollywood', 'treatment', 'reviewer', 'also', 'DC', 'Comics', 'fan', 'only', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'character', 'when', 'appeared', 'various', 'guest-starring', 'roles', 'other', 'various', 'DC', 'Comics', 'Universe', 'comic', 'books', 'time-travel-back-to-the-old-west', 'stories', 'i.e', 'JUSTICE', 'LEAGUE', 'OF', 'AMERICA', 'maybe', 'picked', 'up', 'thumbed', 'couple', 'issues', 'JONAH', 'HEX', 'WEIRD', 'WESTERN', 'TALES', 'comics', 'years', 'fact', 'one', 'pick', 'up', 'current', 'DC', 'Comics', 'mini-series', 'BATMAN', 'RETURN', 'OF', 'BRUCE', 'WAYNE/ISSUE', 'NO.4', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'appearance', 'What', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'casting', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'title', 'role', 'excellent', 'job', 'well', 'cast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Quentin', 'Turnbull', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'antagonist', 'Malkovish', 'usually', 'many-a', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'Turnbull', 'pretty', 'much', 'restrained', 'still', 'evil', 'Other', 'surprises', 'cast', 'are', 'Tom', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZARD', 'Wopat', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'non-comedic', 'role', 'Civil', 'War', 'Union', 'Officer', 'always', 'reliable', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'President', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'so', 'unrecognisable', 'Lt.', 'Hicox', 'role', 'INGLOURIOUS', 'BASTERDS', ""'Burk"", 'Turnbull', 'right-hand-henchman', 'plot', 'mixes', 'elements', 'adventure', 'revenge', 'horror', 'romance', 'Amercian', 'History', 'modern', 'themes', 'weapons-of-mass-destruction', 'old-west', 'background', 'little', 'predictable', 'entertaining', 'nontheless', 'movie', 'length', 'slightly', '90', 'minutes', 'so', ']', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'make', 'epic-type-western', 'production', 'values', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'right', 'Jonah', 'Hex', 'make-up', 'Josh', 'Brolin', 'pretty', 'seamless', 'Overall', 'film', 'look', 'one', '80', 'minutes', 'kill', 'male', 'look', 'one', 'see', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'playing', 'saloon', 'girl/prostitute', 'heart-of-gold', 'Tallulah', 'Black']",N/A
