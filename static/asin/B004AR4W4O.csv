""The Stonewall Uprising"" profiles the people behind the protest that jumpstarted the LGBT rights movement. To its credit, there are substantial interviews as well as footage from the time. What is especially tragic are the pre-Stonewall footage such as a cop lecturing frightened teenagers on how they'd be humiliated if they got caught with another person of the same sex, as well as the infamousBoys Beware (1961)which depicts all male homosexuals as creepy and predatory.

1393771,A2YM0JQI2IO0VS,B004AR4W4O,"B. Berthold ""brad13""","[4, 5]","On the night of June 28th, 1969, queer folk, men, women, drag queens, came out fighting from the dark of night.  The following dawn, an identity and a movement were born.  No longer pathology cases or `tea-room` deviants, the `twilight people` were baptized `gay` and the rest is history.`Stonewall Uprising` documents the events that led up to the explosion outside Greenwich Village`s Stonewall Inn that torrid summer night.  With unjust sex laws that criminalized homosexual behavior, 1960`s America was a dark time for gay people.  Persecuted, subjected to lobotomies and electro-shock therapy, queer folk were hunted at every turn.  The sole refuge was the gay bar.  Tucked away on seedy alleys, they served a variety of functions for gay people.  They were social clubs, counseling centers, fortresses where queer men and women could feel some sense of security.  Yet, vice squads routinely entered such establishments and arrested the occupants on so-called `public indecency` charges.  Police entrapment and bullying was endemic throughout American cities.  Any gay person loitering anywhere could be picked up and arrested.  All this changed with the courageous men and women who finally stood up on June 28th, 1969 and said enough is enough.A smart, well-crafted documentary, `Stonewall Uprising` tells the stories of various participants of that fateful night, from the fierce drag queens to the terrified police officers trapped within the Stonewall Inn by the enraged crowd.The first half of the film presents the dismal, fear-filled lives of many pre-Stonewall gays.  Police footage of `tea-room` arrests are shown alongside such well-meaning, but grotesque documentary clips that put a human face on the clinical moniker of `homosexual.`The second half of `Stonewall Uprising` concentrates on the riots themselves and the on the events that precipitated them, namely the creation of America`s first gay ghetto, Greenwich Village.  Following the riots and the brutal police response, the Village`s gay community rose up and held the first-ever `gay pride` demonstration march through the streets of New York.`Stonewall Uprising` has given voice to a community whose history has languished in silence for too long.  For us queer folk, the struggle for equity was born with the Stonewall Uprising and remains unfinished.  Those concerned about the civil equality of all Americans would do well to watch this documentary.",5,The beginning,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,2432,"['night', 'June', '28th', '1969', 'queer', 'folk', 'men', 'women', 'drag', 'queens', 'came', 'out', 'fighting', 'dark', 'night', 'following', 'dawn', 'identity', 'movement', 'were', 'born', 'No', 'longer', 'pathology', 'cases', 'tea-room', 'deviants', 'twilight', 'people', 'were', 'baptized', 'gay', 'rest', 'history.', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'documents', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'explosion', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 's', 'Stonewall', 'Inn', 'torrid', 'summer', 'night', 'unjust', 'sex', 'laws', 'criminalized', 'homosexual', 'behavior', '1960', 's', 'America', 'was', 'dark', 'time', 'gay', 'people', 'Persecuted', 'subjected', 'lobotomies', 'electro-shock', 'therapy', 'queer', 'folk', 'were', 'hunted', 'turn', 'sole', 'refuge', 'was', 'gay', 'bar', 'Tucked', 'away', 'seedy', 'alleys', 'served', 'variety', 'functions', 'gay', 'people', 'were', 'social', 'clubs', 'counseling', 'centers', 'fortresses', 'where', 'queer', 'men', 'women', 'could', 'feel', 'sense', 'security', 'vice', 'squads', 'routinely', 'entered', 'such', 'establishments', 'arrested', 'occupants', 'so-called', 'public', 'indecency', 'charges', 'Police', 'entrapment', 'bullying', 'was', 'endemic', 'American', 'cities', 'gay', 'person', 'loitering', 'anywhere', 'could', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'arrested', 'changed', 'courageous', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'finally', 'stood', 'up', 'June', '28th', '1969', 'said', 'enough', 'enough.A', 'smart', 'well-crafted', 'documentary', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'stories', 'various', 'participants', 'fateful', 'night', 'fierce', 'drag', 'queens', 'terrified', 'police', 'officers', 'trapped', 'Stonewall', 'Inn', 'enraged', 'crowd.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'dismal', 'fear-filled', 'lives', 'many', 'pre-Stonewall', 'gays', 'Police', 'footage', 'tea-room', 'arrests', 'are', 'shown', 'such', 'well-meaning', 'grotesque', 'documentary', 'clips', 'put', 'human', 'face', 'clinical', 'moniker', 'homosexual.', 'second', 'half', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'concentrates', 'riots', 'events', 'precipitated', 'namely', 'creation', 'America', 's', 'first', 'gay', 'ghetto', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'Following', 'riots', 'brutal', 'police', 'response', 'Village', 's', 'gay', 'community', 'rose', 'up', 'held', 'first-ever', 'gay', 'pride', 'demonstration', 'march', 'streets', 'New', 'York.', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'given', 'voice', 'community', 'history', 'languished', 'silence', 'too', 'long', 'queer', 'folk', 'struggle', 'equity', 'was', 'born', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'unfinished', 'concerned', 'civil', 'equality', 'Americans', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'watch', 'documentary']",American Experience: Stonewall Uprising

This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.This documentary belongs in every library interested in human history.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: STONEWALL UPRISING (a/k/a THE STONE WALL UPRISING) is a typical, no-nonsense documentary outlining the unbearable pain and agony suffered by the gay community in America. That didn't lessen much when a small group of drag queens suddenly formed a military line and fought the police when they attempted to raid the Stone Wall Inn (sorry, it was NEVER the ""Stonewall"", it was ""The Stone Wall""), a famous gay bar.It was from here, from this experience, that Gilbert Baker (at the time of the riot a young man) conceived of the Gay Rainbow flag which has come to be known as the Rainbow Flag or the Gay Pride Flag. From a riot in the street by Americans simply wanting the freedom to be who they are, a flag and an idea are born. This documentary film may leave out a few things and may seem as dry as toast--but it is required viewing.Though I cannot attest to this with any certainty, I'm sure this TV documentary stole more than a little bit fromBefore Stonewall: The Making of a Gay and Lesbian Community(see my review) and shows a few of the same faces--meaning the same footage. It could be, however, that AMERICAN EXPERIENCE was giving the general TV audience a chance at exploring BEORE STONEWALL in a more family-oriented format. I have seen that done before and I like its 'moral fiber'.AMERICAN EXPERIENCE, most importantly, covers some real evil toward the gay community that was not deeply explored in BEFORE STONEWALL orAfter Stonewall(see my review). The reference to the psych hospital that is known as ""the gay Dachau"" is an example. Get this historical document for your home library, and be sure you show it to as many people as possible.When I came out, times were dark and my friends were dying, first of gay-bashings then of AIDS.

1393777,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B004AR4W4O,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","""The Stonewall Uprising"" is a very educational, powerful documentary. I was impressed with the archival footage, still photographs and interviews with just a few of the people who were there the night that GLBTQ people finally refused to be bullied by police and ""the establishment."" Up until the Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969, gays, lesbians, bisexual, transgender people and those questioning their sexuality were routinely subjected to humiliating, brutal punishments for simply being ""caught"" in a gay bar--they were arrested as the bar was raided and their names and addresses were published in local newspapers! They were frequently ruined for life; they often lost their jobs as a result of being arrested for ""homosexual (and other) acts"" because the papers made it very public that they had committed what was then just about the most horrible, shameful and indecent crime you could commit. Indeed, it's chilling to see footage of a law enforcement officer barking at a group of young students that if they were involved in any same-sex activity or similar relationships they ""would find out about it and you'll be caught--we'll tell your parents"" and more! Those poor students looked scared to death. There was even a ""Dachau for queers"" called The Atascadero State Hospital in California where staff injected ""sexual deviants"" with a drug designed to make them feel they were drowning in an effort to ""cure them.""Some of the most poignant footage is the interviews we get with several people who were actually at The Stonewall Bar that evening--they tell how the Mafia routinely ran the gay bars and paid off the cops to either stay away or raid the bars at pre-arranged times. These eye-witnesses also tell of just how big the crowd of angry people became after The Stonewall was raided unexpectedly and how violence broke out--this was the first time police had ever seen this reaction from the gays, lesbians, drag queens and others on their side. We find out what happened after more police arrived; the complete story of what transpired that evening is fascinating. We learn in great detail how the GLBTQ community resisted police all through that night. There is even interview time with a police office who was there the night the bar was raided.The DVD doesn't come with bonus features; but then again it doesn't have to. The story is told with such clarity and detail that almost nothing, if anything, is left out.Overall, I highly recommend this film for anyone in the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and questioning community; and it's clearly essential viewing for anyone studying the history of human rights and civil rights. We must remember The Stonewall Uprising so that younger generations of people will know about the birth of what was to become the global GLBTQ equal rights movement.",5,essential viewing,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",2012,2825,"['Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'very', 'educational', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'was', 'impressed', 'archival', 'footage', 'still', 'photographs', 'interviews', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'night', 'GLBTQ', 'people', 'finally', 'refused', 'be', 'bullied', 'police', 'establishment', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'June', '28', '1969', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'bisexual', 'transgender', 'people', 'questioning', 'sexuality', 'were', 'routinely', 'subjected', 'humiliating', 'brutal', 'punishments', 'simply', 'being', 'caught', 'gay', 'bar', 'were', 'arrested', 'bar', 'was', 'raided', 'names', 'addresses', 'were', 'published', 'local', 'newspapers', 'were', 'frequently', 'ruined', 'life', 'often', 'lost', 'jobs', 'result', 'being', 'arrested', 'homosexual', 'other', 'acts', 'papers', 'made', 'very', 'public', 'had', 'committed', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'just', 'most', 'horrible', 'shameful', 'indecent', 'crime', 'could', 'commit', 'Indeed', 'chilling', 'see', 'footage', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officer', 'barking', 'group', 'young', 'students', 'were', 'involved', 'same-sex', 'activity', 'similar', 'relationships', 'would', 'find', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'caught', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'parents', 'more', 'poor', 'students', 'looked', 'scared', 'death', 'was', 'even', 'Dachau', 'queers', 'called', 'Atascadero', 'State', 'Hospital', 'California', 'where', 'staff', 'injected', 'sexual', 'deviants', 'drug', 'designed', 'make', 'feel', 'were', 'drowning', 'effort', 'cure', 'most', 'poignant', 'footage', 'interviews', 'get', 'several', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'actually', 'Stonewall', 'Bar', 'evening', 'tell', 'how', 'Mafia', 'routinely', 'ran', 'gay', 'bars', 'paid', 'off', 'cops', 'stay', 'away', 'raid', 'bars', 'pre-arranged', 'times', 'eye-witnesses', 'also', 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'big', 'crowd', 'angry', 'people', 'became', 'Stonewall', 'was', 'raided', 'unexpectedly', 'how', 'violence', 'broke', 'out', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'police', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'reaction', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'drag', 'queens', 'others', 'side', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'more', 'police', 'arrived', 'complete', 'story', 'what', 'transpired', 'evening', 'fascinating', 'learn', 'great', 'detail', 'how', 'GLBTQ', 'community', 'resisted', 'police', 'night', 'even', 'interview', 'time', 'police', 'office', 'who', 'was', 'night', 'bar', 'was', 'raided.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'come', 'bonus', 'features', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'have', 'story', 'told', 'such', 'clarity', 'detail', 'almost', 'nothing', 'anything', 'left', 'out.Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'bisexual', 'transgender', 'questioning', 'community', 'clearly', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'studying', 'history', 'human', 'rights', 'civil', 'rights', 'must', 'remember', 'Stonewall', 'Uprising', 'that', 'younger', 'generations', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'birth', 'what', 'was', 'become', 'global', 'GLBTQ', 'equal', 'rights', 'movement']",American Experience: Stonewall Uprising

Days of rioting followed.The demand just to drink at a bar in peace is very 'moderate' in our era. Major cities now have GLBT elected officials and there is a push for equal benefits. The Democratic Party endorses same sex marriage in it's platform.But these people merely wanted the right to congregate. They initially weren't thinking about public office or being 'out' in the public sphere. They just did not want to be arrested for who they were!This was a different era when the American Psychological Association still classified homosexuality as a mental illness--a disorder it did not remove until 1973. An arrest record and the public reporting of this brought public shame and the loss of employment, even in a place like New York.Pressure from subsequent activists in the Gay Liberation Front, who were dissatisfied with the pace of change, helped soon move beyond initial demands.The documentary is good because it relies upon both stock footage and first person interviews. You understand how this transformed and successfully politicized a community. They realized that they had 'rights' and were citizens.  There was no going back to how 'others' said they should be.And perhaps most importantly, gay rights is an issue still very much discussed in the public sphere. History is not just something which happens in the past--but an ongoing process developed every day.
