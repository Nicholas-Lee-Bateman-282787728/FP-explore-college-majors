I watched this with really low expectations, and came away with a decent story of 2 brothers (1 white/1 black), and their struggles with life.One struggles with drugs while the other simply struggles with himself, you don't really find out why immediately though. Deborah Cox did an excellent job as a side story about her life while playing one of the brother's girlfriend.All in all it was a really low budget movie with an entertaining cast and story that kept me interested (not easy to do) till the end.",4,Suprisingly entertaining.,1029628800,"08 18, 2002",2002,575,"['Somebody', 'brought', 'watch', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'watched', 'really', 'low', 'expectations', 'came', 'away', 'decent', 'story', '2', 'brothers', '1', 'white/1', 'black', 'struggles', 'life.One', 'struggles', 'drugs', 'other', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'immediately', 'Deborah', 'Cox', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'side', 'story', 'life', 'playing', 'one', 'brother', 'girlfriend.All', 'was', 'really', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'cast', 'story', 'kept', 'interested', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'till', 'end']",Love Come Down

It's a good movie, has excellent character development. My only complaint: Larenz Tate isn't that great, not sure he really carried the lead in this. He was pretty much eclipsed by Martin Cummins' performance. Cummins won a lot of Canadian awards for this role. Also, the DVD should have more of a 'making of' extra.",4,Excellent Canadian Film,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,402,"['wish', 'Canadian', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'damn', 'hard', 'find', 'down', 'here', 'States', 'good', 'movie', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'only', 'complaint', 'Larenz', 'Tate', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'carried', 'lead', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'eclipsed', 'Martin', 'Cummins', 'performance', 'Cummins', 'won', 'lot', 'Canadian', 'awards', 'role', 'Also', 'DVD', 'should', 'have', 'more', ""'making"", 'extra']",Love Come Down
684331,A1FATTRIXTSTEB,B00005UKKG,"Pamela Jarmon-Wade ""Tx Red Rose""","[3, 5]","Love Come Down stars Larenz Tate and Deborah Cox.  I did not recognize the rest of the cast by name or face.  Let me first say that I am a BIG fan of Larenz Tate.  He is one awesome actor.  His past work includes Love Jones, Dead Presidents, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, The Inkwell and Menace II Society.  Deborah Cox is an excellent songstress and her acting appearance in Soul Food The Series was good.  However, this movie proves that a good cast alone can't carry the entire project.  A solid storyline, good directing, editing and writing helps.I really could not get into this video.  The directing execs did a poor job of mixing scenes of the past into the present.  Now that I have given my opinion let me summarize the movie/video...A singer and a young man meet in a night club and there is chemistry.  After getting together for a night, the story depicts two people from two different backgrounds...yet both are just as dysfunctional as the other.  The characters deal with drug abuse and addiction, child abuse, murder, family secrets, fears, love, sex and rivalry.  Sounds like the perfect ingredients for a good movie...DON'T bet the WHOLE hog on it.",1,ONLY if you have nothing better to do...,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,1164,"['Love', 'Come', 'Down', 'stars', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Deborah', 'Cox', 'did', 'not', 'recognize', 'rest', 'cast', 'name', 'face', 'Let', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'BIG', 'fan', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'one', 'awesome', 'actor', 'past', 'work', 'Love', 'Jones', 'Dead', 'Presidents', 'Why', 'Do', 'Fools', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Inkwell', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'Deborah', 'Cox', 'excellent', 'songstress', 'acting', 'appearance', 'Soul', 'Food', 'Series', 'was', 'good', 'However', 'movie', 'good', 'cast', 'alone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'entire', 'project', 'solid', 'storyline', 'good', 'directing', 'editing', 'writing', 'helps.I', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'video', 'directing', 'execs', 'did', 'poor', 'job', 'mixing', 'scenes', 'past', 'present', 'Now', 'have', 'given', 'opinion', 'let', 'summarize', 'movie/video', 'A', 'singer', 'young', 'man', 'meet', 'night', 'club', 'chemistry', 'getting', 'together', 'night', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'two', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'yet', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'dysfunctional', 'other', 'characters', 'deal', 'drug', 'abuse', 'addiction', 'child', 'abuse', 'murder', 'family', 'secrets', 'fears', 'love', 'sex', 'rivalry', 'perfect', 'ingredients', 'good', 'movie', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'bet', 'WHOLE', 'hog']",Love Come Down

Larenz Tate was great to look at, and Deborah Cox, I could listen to her sing all day.  But that movie was just dumb.  What was the point to it?  It was just no story line at all.  First of all, I think they should have used a biracial child to play Larenz's part, because they were all off in that area.  Maybe they should have had their friend play it.  It would have been more believable.
