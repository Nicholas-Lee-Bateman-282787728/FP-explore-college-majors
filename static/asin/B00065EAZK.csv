Which is saying something since she is usually not that attracted to tv programs or movies.  She loves the music and video of REAL kids playing.  She also enjoys the digital animation in this feature.  She doesn't usually like any animated programs.  Every time we put this in, we have a 30 min. ""break"" to get some dishes done, etc.  I call it my ""life line"" and only use it sparingly - like once a day so it doesn't get too old!We tried others in the Baby Genius series and none were as mesmerizing as this one.

She now knows the words to all the songs and dances along to most of them. She really enjoys watching the children and hearing the music. My only complaint (and it is a small one) is that I wished they had used the original words to all the songs. Most of them are the original words but for reasons I don't understand, the words to My Bonnie lies of the Ocean and Blow the Man Down are different. But overall, I would enthusiastically recommend this DVD.",5,A big hit,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,565,"['daughter', 'loves', 'DVD', 'was', 'favorite', '9', 'months', 'still', 'favorite', '2', '1/2', 'now', 'words', 'songs', 'dances', 'along', 'most', 'really', 'watching', 'children', 'hearing', 'music', 'only', 'complaint', 'small', 'one', 'wished', 'had', 'used', 'original', 'words', 'songs', 'Most', 'are', 'original', 'words', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'words', 'My', 'Bonnie', 'Ocean', 'Blow', 'Man', 'Down', 'are', 'different', 'overall', 'would', 'enthusiastically', 'recommend', 'DVD']",Baby Genius Favorite Children's Songs Music
