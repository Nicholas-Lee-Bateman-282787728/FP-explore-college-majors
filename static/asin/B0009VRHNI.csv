(Spoilers- though this information is revealed in the first several minutes of the film)It is apparent in the first scenes that their relationship has become too intimate and is frightening him. In an effort to undo what he has wrought he decides to invite his hookup and her sons to live with them in their home. This works about as well as one would expect. Rose's life is on the cusp of changing out of all recognition on many levels, though she only seems truly aware of changes in her relationship with her father.It is extremely well-acted and the cinematography is beautiful. It's worth watching on many levels and includes one or two very interesting and satisfying twists. There are interesting secondary characters and themes playing out as well. In the end, Jack needs to come to terms with the fact that he may have made some missteps along the way and that they may not be solvable.

914049,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B0009VRHNI,A Customer,"[44, 46]","Those familiar with Rebecca Miller's previous film Personal Velocity, an insightful triptych of three very different young women, will know that she's a director who's on the cutting edge of American independent filmmaking. But with her latest venture The Ballad of Jack and Rose; she seems to have really outdone herself. This astonishingly beautiful and perceptive tale presents, with an astounding veracity, themes of familiaral love, the loss of innocence, and the ultimate costs of idealism in a world where such ideals are no longer relevant or not even particularly welcome.Boasting some of the best performances of the year, The Ballad of Jack and Rose opens with Jack (a fantastic Daniel Day Lewis) and 16-year-old Rose (Camilla Belle) sharing a tender and intimate embrace while lying on a Garden of Eden-like bed of grass. As they stare up at the wild blue yonder, one gets the sense that they're a complete, contained, and totally contented couple. It's not immediately clear how they are related to each other, but we soon learn that they are a chaste father and daughter. However, the ambiguity of their severely intense relationship quickly becomes unsettling.It's 1986 and Jack and Rose are living on a remote East Coast island, the only holdovers from a utopian cooperative. Their world is self-sufficient, autonomous, and claustrophobic. They spend their days living off the land, and hiding out in a wooden, rambling shack that is nestled upon a windswept hilltop and over-grown with grass and wildflowers. Jack is originally Scottish, an old hippie, who came to America in the mid-60's carrying with him the hopes and dreams for a country that he thought America would become. An engineer by profession, over the years he has instilled in Rose a fierce intelligence, but also a wariness and distrust of the outside world.Jack is dying of a bad heart, and he's angry about the world he cannot put in order; he also feels helpless about the beloved daughter who will soon be parentless. Rose feels as though she can't live without him, so when she tells him"" When you die, I'm going to die"" you know that she means it. Their problems are compounded when a slick land developer (Beau Bridges), who has begun building a lavish, modern subdivision, deliberately endangers the wetlands flanking the edge of Jack's property.In an effort to get some domestic help and also to introduce Rose to the wider world, Jack invites Kathleen (Catherine Keener), his casual girlfriend from the mainland, and her two sons Thaddius and Rodney (Ryan McDonald and Paul Dano) to move in and assist with the household. But Rose, having been sheltered from influences other than her father, is not pleased to share her world with anyone new.Rose is gradually becoming a woman, and she doesn't know how to be appropriate around new people. She's particularly upset that Kathleen is sharing her father's bed and dividing his attention. In an effort to get back at her father, she begins to solicit the attentions of Kathleen's boys, and sets in motion a series of events that forces Jack to confront the disorder and disappointment of his life.Daniel Day Lewis brings total emotional heft to this role, vividly bringing to life the character's whole host of contradictions; it really is a tour-de-force of acting. His portrayal of a disappointed, bitter, but highly intelligent counter-culture type is fiercely earnest and totally empowering. Jack is a man of principle who is caught between his old world beliefs and a world that has long ago left him behind.Jack is the epitome of a control freak who realizes, too late, that the depth of his devotion may well have poisoned his daughter. Camilla Belle brings to Rose a ferocious sense of the competitive; she's possessive, and potent, a seemingly innocent yet very willful seductress. She lashes out at her father and at Kathleen in a sequence of chaos-inducing maneuvers that can only bring heartbreak to the small collective.The Ballad of Jack and Rose is a marvelously shaded mood piece that is probably more about issues and characters than it is about story. Miller has a languid, floaty, and wondering directorial style that lends itself well to this type of subject. Rhythmic and dreamy, both Day-Lewis and Belle respond to it all as if gasping in harmony. The film works on numerous levels - it's a statement about environmentalism, it's also a homage to a bygone world, but its mostly an intensely engaging and satisfying drama about a man who has been sidelined by the realities of life, and who could never live up to the ideas inside his head.

914050,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009VRHNI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It is a true statement that this film gets better with time.  When I first saw it I was a little turned off by it, but I think that's because I didn't really understand it, nor did I appreciate its strangely disturbing undertones.  But the one thing I couldn't help but notice was Camilla Belle's magnificent performance.  It was that performance that urged me to rewatch this film a second time, so that my wife could experience just how stunning Belle truly is here.  It was during that second viewing that I began to accept this film for all its beauty and look past its flaws to see the heart and soul of this tragic yet inspiring `ballad'.The story is that of Jack Slavin and his daughter Rose.  Jack has made it his goal to shield his beautiful daughter from the outside world.  They live together on an isolated island that once was the grounds for communal living.  As Jack grows sicklier by the day he decides that this life of isolation may not be the best choice for his daughter anymore.  She needs someone to look after her, to take care of her when he is not able to anymore.  With that thought in mind he asks his girlfriend Kathleen (of whom Rose is not privy) and her two awkward teenage sons to come live with them.  Rose is not happy with this new arrangement and so she begins to lash out in any way possible in order to capture her father's attention.`The Ballad of Jack and Rose' is at its heart a beautiful story of one mans deep love for his daughter and her general attachment to him.  The powerful performances given by Daniel Day-Lewis (why doesn't he act more?) and Camilla Belle elevate this film above what it could have been and help create something tender and meaningful.  We see within Belle the complete and tortured journey that her character takes on in coming to the understanding that she will not always have this man with her.  Her loyalty and devotion to her father is warm and touching, yet as the film continues we see there is a dark and destructive side to this kind of affection.  What is bewildering about `The Ballad of Jack and Rose' is the way it is able to affectively show the positive as well as negative side of something we tend to take for granted.The film also contains some fine supporting performances.  Catherine Keener (always solid) delivers a fantastic performance as Kathleen, the kind hearted yet confused girlfriend of Jack.  While I think that Paul Dano has grown into a fine actor (his performance in `There Will Be Blood' gave me chills) I don't think he really fit well here.  He came off as awkward, and while I understand that his character was a tad `awkward' I still feel that he was not all together here.  Ryan McDonald did a fine job as did Jena Malone who is sorely underused.  And who would have thought that Jason Lee could pull off a performance in a movie like this so well; not I.In the end I found `The Ballad of Jack and Rose' to be quite a beautiful, if not startling, ballad indeed.  As Rose continues to sell herself so-to-speak in order to punish her father we are brought into the darkness that surrounds this film and are helped to appreciate the flaws within attachment.  Camilla Belle is flawless here, truly amazing to watch.  Her performance is the type of performance that never leaves you; the type of performance that catapults careers.  While `The Ballad of Jack and Rose' is not a film everyone will understand nor appreciate, it is a film that deserves a chance.  It strikes a fire and allows that fire to erupt into a wild flame, a wild flame that challenges us to try and tame it.",4,It is quite a beautiful ballad to tell...,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,3584,"['true', 'statement', 'film', 'better', 'time', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'was', 'little', 'turned', 'off', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'did', 'appreciate', 'strangely', 'disturbing', 'undertones', 'one', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'was', 'performance', 'urged', 'rewatch', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'wife', 'could', 'experience', 'just', 'how', 'stunning', 'Belle', 'truly', 'here', 'was', 'second', 'viewing', 'began', 'accept', 'film', 'beauty', 'look', 'flaws', 'see', 'heart', 'soul', 'tragic', 'yet', 'inspiring', ""ballad'.The"", 'story', 'Jack', 'Slavin', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Jack', 'made', 'goal', 'shield', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'outside', 'world', 'live', 'together', 'isolated', 'island', 'once', 'was', 'grounds', 'communal', 'living', 'Jack', 'sicklier', 'day', 'life', 'isolation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'daughter', 'anymore', 'someone', 'look', 'take', 'care', 'when', 'not', 'able', 'anymore', 'thought', 'mind', 'girlfriend', 'Kathleen', 'whom', 'Rose', 'not', 'privy', 'two', 'awkward', 'teenage', 'sons', 'come', 'live', 'Rose', 'not', 'happy', 'new', 'arrangement', 'so', 'lash', 'out', 'way', 'possible', 'order', 'capture', 'father', 'attention.', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'heart', 'beautiful', 'story', 'one', 'mans', 'deep', 'love', 'daughter', 'general', 'attachment', 'powerful', 'performances', 'given', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'why', ""n't"", 'act', 'more', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'elevate', 'film', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'help', 'create', 'something', 'tender', 'meaningful', 'see', 'Belle', 'complete', 'tortured', 'journey', 'character', 'coming', 'understanding', 'will', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'man', 'loyalty', 'devotion', 'father', 'warm', 'touching', 'yet', 'film', 'see', 'dark', 'destructive', 'side', 'kind', 'affection', 'What', 'bewildering', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'way', 'able', 'affectively', 'show', 'positive', 'as', 'well', 'negative', 'side', 'something', 'tend', 'take', 'granted.The', 'film', 'also', 'fine', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'always', 'solid', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'Kathleen', 'kind', 'hearted', 'yet', 'confused', 'girlfriend', 'Jack', 'think', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'grown', 'fine', 'actor', 'performance', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'gave', 'chills', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'really', 'fit', 'well', 'here', 'came', 'off', 'awkward', 'understand', 'character', 'was', 'tad', 'awkward', 'still', 'feel', 'was', 'not', 'together', 'here', 'Ryan', 'McDonald', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'did', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'who', 'sorely', 'underused', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'performance', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'I.In', 'end', 'found', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'be', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'not', 'startling', 'ballad', 'indeed', 'Rose', 'sell', 'so-to-speak', 'order', 'punish', 'father', 'are', 'brought', 'darkness', 'film', 'are', 'helped', 'appreciate', 'flaws', 'attachment', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'flawless', 'here', 'truly', 'amazing', 'watch', 'performance', 'type', 'performance', 'never', 'type', 'performance', 'careers', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'film', 'chance', 'fire', 'fire', 'erupt', 'wild', 'flame', 'wild', 'flame', 'try', 'tame']",N/A

In this film, the hero, Jack, is flawed.  An idealistic commune-dweller from the sixties, he stayed at the commune with his daughter long after the rest moved on.I do not believe this work of art was intended to please the critics or to be tidy.  Which is a nice change.Jack discovers two ironies at the end of his life:  First, that despite his ideals and differences of ""taste,"" he is no different than his nemesis, the real estate developer played by Beau Bridges.  To create an instant family for himself and his daughter, Jack pays his mistress to move in with her two teenage sons.  Then he pays her to move out when it it doesn't work.  Afterwards, the real estate developer offers to buy his land.  Jack says to his daughter, Rose, ""Everything is for sale.""The second irony was that by holding his beloved daughter too closely, sheltering her and depending on her too much, he failed to prepare her for a life without him.There are no car chases or intricately choreographed fight scenes in the movie.  There is, however, gorgeous scenery, a delicious soundtrack including Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival, and subtle, compelling acting.  The film offers fuel for thought on the consequences of enmeshed parent-child relationships, the conflict between social idealism and modern ""progress,"" and an example of ""what not to do,"" when blending families.If you ever wondered what it might be like to throw off the bonds of capitalism and live ""off the grid,"" this beautiful film might be an amusing breath of fresh air.Or, let's face it - if you've ever been irritated by a social idealist with a superior air, and wanted to see that person get a wake up call, this film might bring a naughty bit of malicious glee.",5,A good film for closet idealists,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,1860,"['people', 'think', 'order', 'film', 'be', 'worthwhile', 'hero', 'required', 'be', 'free', 'faults', 'mistakes', 'disagree', 'film', 'hero', 'Jack', 'flawed', 'idealistic', 'commune-dweller', 'sixties', 'stayed', 'commune', 'daughter', 'long', 'rest', 'moved', 'on.I', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'work', 'art', 'was', 'intended', 'please', 'critics', 'be', 'tidy', 'Which', 'nice', 'change.Jack', 'discovers', 'two', 'ironies', 'end', 'life', 'First', 'ideals', 'differences', 'taste', 'different', 'nemesis', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'played', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'create', 'instant', 'family', 'daughter', 'Jack', 'mistress', 'move', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'Then', 'move', 'out', 'when', ""n't"", 'work', 'Afterwards', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'buy', 'land', 'Jack', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Everything', 'sale', 'second', 'irony', 'was', 'holding', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'too', 'closely', 'sheltering', 'depending', 'too', 'much', 'failed', 'prepare', 'life', 'him.There', 'are', 'car', 'intricately', 'choreographed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'movie', 'however', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'delicious', 'soundtrack', 'including', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'subtle', 'compelling', 'acting', 'film', 'offers', 'fuel', 'thought', 'consequences', 'enmeshed', 'parent-child', 'relationships', 'conflict', 'social', 'idealism', 'modern', 'progress', 'example', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'when', 'blending', 'families.If', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'throw', 'off', 'bonds', 'capitalism', 'live', 'grid', 'beautiful', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'amusing', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.Or', 'let', 'face', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'irritated', 'social', 'idealist', 'superior', 'air', 'wanted', 'see', 'person', 'get', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'film', 'might', 'bring', 'naughty', 'bit', 'malicious', 'glee']",N/A

Jack has kept Rose isolated from the outside world for sixteen years, but as his health takes a drastic fall he feels she may need a woman in her life, someone to take care of her after his death.  That woman is Jack's secret girlfriend Kathleen (Keener), someone he kept completely hidden from Rose until the day she and her two teenage boys move in with them.  Her boys are very different than anything Rose was used to.The film mostly focuses on Rose's rebellion against her father and his newfound family and the effects it has on everyone around them.

It is now that he is realizing that being cloistered away may not be in the best interests of everyone, triggered by Rose's frighteningly sincere revelation to kill herself when he dies and the inappropriate feelings he is beginning to feel for her. His decision to enlist the help of his mainland squeeze and her two sons to come and stay on the island to ""help out"" does not go over well with Rose and she certainly does little to hide that fact. As this shaky ""experiment"" progresses, it leads to both tragic and life-changing events to all those involved.This is all handled exquistely by the players here, in particular Daniel-Day Lewis. It's a shame he doesn't work more often, because virtually every role he's been in is Oscar-worthy and this is no exception.

THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE, his best film in a while, is the tale of a liberal dream grown old. And, as he has done with all his other characters, Day-Lewis becomes his role. At one point, I said to my husband. ""Daniel looks terrible.""  ""Well, he is pretty sick"" said my husband.  Jack's illness (heart disease) has caused his body to waste away, so Day-Lewis does not display the physique seen in previous films, but rather appears as a wizened and wiry middle-aged man on his last legs- perhaps a somewhat older version of Christie Brown sans the disability and wheel chair.Rose is a beautiful young girl, Jack's daughter, protected from the harsh realities of the outside world until a developer threatens their blissful existence on an island in the Atlantic off the coast of Canada, and Jack's girlfriend and her ne'er do well drug addict son move in, ostensibly to take care of Jack. Has Jack given Rose everything she needs to survive in this ""real"" world?  Only time will tell.  The ending of their story is bittersweet but closes on a hopeful note.

914058,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009VRHNI,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 7]","Master filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu made one of his great masterworks about the unearthly devotion between a father and a daughter with 1949's ""Late Spring"". Director-screenwriter Rebecca Miller has a similar idea in mind here, as she has fashioned a story set in 1986 around the same inextricable bond between a 1960's drop-out Jack and his teenage daughter Rose on an isolated island. She has an intriguing idea for the film's theme, the disillusionment of the idealism borne out of the 1960's anti-war movement and the encroachment of capitalism upon a former commune's idyllic setting.However, whereas Ozu uses narrative ellipses to let the story flow and lets the viewer respond emotionally, Miller does not reflect such an instinctive manner and has piled on soap opera conventions, heavy symbolism, a dominating soundtrack (lots of Bob Dylan) and lethargic pacing to add weight to her well-intentioned but significantly flawed 2005 movie. That's unfortunate since we expect more from a film starring the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis (Miller's husband) as Jack and Catherine Keener as his sometime hippie-earth mother girlfriend, Kathleen. Looking appropriately gaunt for a dying man, Day-Lewis infuses his trademark feral passion into the role and comes up with some genuinely incisive moments, though Miller gives him little more the liberal hermit archetype to play. Keener does not fare much better as her role is even more stereotypical than his, especially as Miller's contrived story turns make her acts more incomprehensible as the story trudges on. Oddly, she plays a comic variation on a very similar role in this year's ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" and is wonderful in that.Camilla Belle is a lovely presence as Rose, and she does some strong work with the coming-of-age aspects of her character. Where the script fails her is in showing the motivation for her often extreme acts of hostility and manipulation to keep Rose's relationship with Jack isolated from the others. As a result, she comes across as petulant and childish rather than the puritanical soul Miller would like us to think she is. There are several performances in smaller roles worth mentioning - Ryan McDonald keenly aware as Kathleen's overweight, acerbic son, Rodney, who wants to be a hairdresser; Beau Bridges as the conciliatory land developer, Marty Rance; a surprisingly sensitive Jason Lee as a thoughtful gardener who bonds with Rose over their mutual love of flowers; and in the film's best performance, an almost unrecognizable Jena Malone as Rodney's wild-child friend, Red Berry.Occasionally there are scenes that surprise with their originality like the final encounter between Jack and Marty. However, more often, there are several scenes that ring false, in particular, the back-projected home movies during the kids' recreation of a 1960's love-in party. The film's sluggish pace suddenly picks up toward the end when a series of events wrap up the loose ends of the story in too pat a manner including a totally unnecessary epilogue. Ellen Kuras's cinematography is almost too prettified given her predilection for impressionistic set-up shots. Miller shows signs of her father Arthur Miller's gravitas in her story, but she needs to work on maintaining interest in her film as the plot unfolds. Truth be told, I fell asleep twice before I could see the movie to the end.

The result is a film of tenderness and dashed hopes and unconditional love between a father and daughter.Jack Slavin (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a Scottish immigrant who mentally still lives in the 1960s, full of adoration of nature and the idealistic expectations of the Hippies reacting against a country at war with Vietnam.  He and his daughter Rose (Camilla Belle) now (in 1986) live in a deserted hippie commune on an island off the East Coast of the USA.  Their relationship is idyllic, living off the land, at one with nature.  Jack has heart failure and worries about the fate of his isolated Rose almost as much as he loathes the inevitable encroachment of land developers such as Marty Rance (Beau Bridges) who is building houses on the precious wetlands on the opposite side of Jack's island.Jack seeks to solve (control) problems: he invites his girlfriend Kathleen (Catherine Keener) and her two sons Rodney (Ryan McDonald)  and Thaddius (Paul Dano) to enlarge his family at the old commune, and he confronts Marty with threats that he will destroy the development project.  Once the extended family is formed, Rose views Jack having sex with Kathleen, decides she must 'grow up' and attempts to enter womanhood by unsuccessfully seducing Rodney and ultimately losing her virginity to Thaddius, an event she makes public by hanging her stained banner sheet on the windswept clothesline.  Jack reacts in rage then anguish at his failure to provide a secure, healthy future for Rose, and in time gives in to the developers and draws Rose back to him in a final scene that is one of the most touching farewells on film.Daniel Day-Lewis is so completely immersed in his character that he never for a moment loses our compassion.  The entire cast is excellent, the pacing of this sensitive script is extraordinary, and the entire production crew (cinematography, music, editing, etc) shares the sense of commitment to Miller's direction.  This is a genuinely touching film completely without the saccharine tones that could have overtaken the story. Highly Recommended.

914062,AMS8RT7TRF1ID,B0009VRHNI,Jean Mills,"[19, 21]","I bought this film just because Daniel Day-Lewis was in it.  I had to think about it even so because of what might be objectionable content and I didn't want to get into such a film with Mr. Day-Lewis.  Thank goodness my interest in his performances overcame all this negativity and I went ahead.  There are many reviews here that explain the movie in indepth detail.  For me Daniel Day-Lewis makes this movie.  He portrays his character (Jack) so well that you mourn for him and ache for the young daughter (Rose)who is going to live a large portion of her lifetime without this father who is absolutely everything to her but is very ill and will die soon.  Still this pull toward each other in an unhealthy way is relatively new and they are trying to maintain the loving relationship they have without really confronting this problem. He definitely has the girlfriend, Kathleen, (who has two teenage sons that he had never met) move in with him and his daughter (big mistake) to help keep the relationship one of father/daughter but he tries to tell his daughter this  is ""just an experiment"" to possibly get the help they need since he is so ill.  Actually, he was in a panic over his feelings about his daughter when he made this decision, had never mentioned this girlfriend to his daughter, and there doesn't seem to be a connection other than physical with this woman, therefore it was destined to fail. The contrast of homelife before vs. after these people move in is absolutely terrible to say the least.  If I had to start each day with these people after what had been my normal everyday life, I would have probably become self-destructive too.  This ""intrusion"" into their lives is the beginning of the end.  Rose is extremely hurt and angry and feels ""tricked"" into having to live with these people.  This parent and child have been alone on this island many years, and feelings have become confused. She has begun to be seductive in her behavior and she wants to actively pursue this type of relationship with her father but he is overwhelmed with how to handle this situation  and is overcome with guilt about the feelings he has for her. This film handles this departure from the norm in such a caring way that you become completely engrossed with their problems overall and understand how difficult this is for the father to confront and resolve.  No one could have made me believe I would love this film as I do.

The film also stars Oscar nominee Catherine Keener (Best Supporting Actor, Capote),Beau Bridges, Jason Lee, Jena Malone, and Camilla Belle as Rose. The movie is about Jack & Rose. A father and daughter who live reclusively on a small island. Their is a housing development about to be built on the island, but Jack and Rose live their alone in a large house without a TV. In fact, Rose is pretty much shut off from the entire outside world and knows nothing except what Jack has taught her. Rose has never even traveled to the mainland, but Jack goes their often to see his girlfriend Kathleen (Keener).When Jack is sick with what appears to be some kind of heart condition, he invites Kathleen and her two kids Rodney (Ryan McDonald, who is really good) and Thaddius (Paul Dano) to live with him and Rose. ""Don't worry,""he warns Rose. ""It's only an experiment."" Rose, who enjoys her solitude, is not happy with the living arrangement and as she discovers new things, like sex and such, she begins experiments of her own much to the dismay of Jack. Jason Lee co-stars as a gardener named Gray, who appears to be a ploy to give the movie an ending; Beau Bridges plays the guy building the housing developments. Now, this movie is exactly what the review on the back says ""Compelling. Imaginative. Thought-Provoking"". It really is a great movie in all aspects. The dialouge is very good and Day-Lewis is absolutely amazing; Newcomer Ryan McDonald plays the part of the seemingly gay Rodney, an aspiring hairdresser, really well. There are some parts of the movie that can easily be spotted as mere puppets to further the story. Like Lee's character and the character played by Jena Malone. Camilla Belle (who I've only seen in some disney channel movie) shows some great talent, simalarly to Evan Rachel Wood in ""Thirteen"", except Belle is playing a much more mature role. The movie's got a very interesting plot and message and it also explores realms like what would happen if you secluded your daughter on an island. I thought when the movie got incestuous, it was just a plot-twist waitint to happen; And I wasn't fond of the ending, because Miller could have taken it so many different directions. But despite these cons, this is a fantastic and touching movie.

This is his wife's movie and I heard that he didn't want to be in it until he finally broke down and agreed. Bad choice. This is a boring movie with a twisted plot. It's basically about a father and a daughter who are in love with each other. Pretty sick stuff if you ask me. Not only that, but this movie is BORING!

Years ago it was prospering but all the members have left, including jack's wife, and only Jack and Rose remained. They spend their days in quiet contentment, gardening, farming --and launching two-men guerrilla attacks on a housing development on the other side of the island.Living in near isolation, jack and rose develop an incredibly close bond, one that threatens to become incestuous. Terrified of this development, Jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend and her two teenage sons to live with them. The new 'guests' are an unwelcome development to Rose's life. She's incredibly possessive of her father and in retaliation for this intrusion, she tries to seduce the two boys and kill Kathleen (the girlfriend). jack is at wit's end eventually, things cannot go on as they were nor can they continue to coexist in the new situation. He has two choices neither of which are idyll.This is where the movie goes awry. The movie keeps everything to a very natural level, no overwrought music, and overreactions. This works for most of the movie yet these events are too alarming for the characters to ignore. After Rose tries to shoot Kathleen, all the characters choose to ignore Rose's unhealthy jealousy. They blame her behavior as the result of being isolated from society for too long. But the character came off more like a petulant child instead of a wild child. As her acts became increasingly dangerous, the more I wanted someone to finally tell her enough is enough. The character of Jack is equally unlikable. He chooses to ignore his daughter's unhealthy attachment and when he does fully accept it, he continues to encourage it. This may be a fully organic development of the characters and their relationship, but that doesn't mean it's entertaining. Despite the controversial relationship, the movie vacillates between smug and boring.The performances are good, my favorite are those of Paul Dano, Ryan MacDonald, and Catherine Keener as the girlfriend and her two sons, there's a naturalness to their acting that is oddly lacking in the depictions of Jack and Rose. Perhaps that is intentional. Jack and Rose are not as much real people as they are idealized environmentalist versions of a fairytale king and his daughter, living in grand isolation until the advent of the evil stepmother, Kathleen. Only in this case the stepmother isn't evil and the new family is more entertaining then the main characters.There is an extraneous subplot with Beau bridges as a housing developer that serves as metaphorical commentary on Jack and Rose's reltionship, but like the rest of the movie it's too smug to be meaningful.",2,ruined by its own precocity,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,2792,"['Set', '1986', 'Ballad', 'tale', 'ailing', 'wealthy', 'counterculture', 'environmentalist', 'Jack', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'living', 'abandoned', 'commune', 'Years', 'was', 'prospering', 'members', 'have', 'left', 'including', 'jack', 'wife', 'only', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'remained', 'spend', 'days', 'quiet', 'contentment', 'gardening', 'farming', 'launching', 'two-men', 'guerrilla', 'attacks', 'housing', 'development', 'other', 'side', 'island.Living', 'near', 'isolation', 'jack', 'rose', 'develop', 'incredibly', 'close', 'bond', 'one', 'become', 'incestuous', 'Terrified', 'development', 'Jack', 'secret', 'mainland', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'live', 'new', ""'guests"", 'are', 'unwelcome', 'development', 'Rose', 'life', 'incredibly', 'possessive', 'father', 'retaliation', 'intrusion', 'seduce', 'two', 'boys', 'kill', 'Kathleen', 'girlfriend', 'jack', 'wit', 'end', 'eventually', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'were', 'can', 'continue', 'coexist', 'new', 'situation', 'two', 'choices', 'are', 'idyll.This', 'where', 'movie', 'awry', 'movie', 'everything', 'very', 'natural', 'level', 'overwrought', 'music', 'overreactions', 'most', 'movie', 'yet', 'events', 'are', 'too', 'alarming', 'characters', 'ignore', 'Rose', 'tries', 'shoot', 'Kathleen', 'characters', 'choose', 'ignore', 'Rose', 'unhealthy', 'jealousy', 'blame', 'behavior', 'result', 'being', 'isolated', 'society', 'too', 'long', 'character', 'came', 'off', 'more', 'petulant', 'child', 'instead', 'wild', 'child', 'acts', 'became', 'increasingly', 'dangerous', 'more', 'wanted', 'someone', 'finally', 'tell', 'enough', 'enough', 'character', 'Jack', 'equally', 'unlikable', 'ignore', 'daughter', 'unhealthy', 'attachment', 'when', 'fully', 'accept', 'encourage', 'may', 'be', 'fully', 'organic', 'development', 'characters', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'mean', 'entertaining', 'controversial', 'relationship', 'movie', 'smug', 'boring.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'favorite', 'are', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Ryan', 'MacDonald', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'girlfriend', 'two', 'sons', 'naturalness', 'acting', 'oddly', 'lacking', 'depictions', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'Perhaps', 'intentional', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'idealized', 'environmentalist', 'versions', 'fairytale', 'king', 'daughter', 'living', 'grand', 'isolation', 'advent', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'Kathleen', 'Only', 'case', 'stepmother', ""n't"", 'evil', 'new', 'family', 'more', 'entertaining', 'then', 'main', 'characters.There', 'extraneous', 'subplot', 'Beau', 'bridges', 'housing', 'developer', 'as', 'metaphorical', 'commentary', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'reltionship', 'rest', 'movie', 'too', 'smug', 'be', 'meaningful']",N/A

It's this combination of unorthodox aspects that make ""Ballad"" (at best) an intriguing journey and (at worst) a bit self-important.Daniel Day Lewis, always indispensable, plays Jack.  An ex-hippie, he exists in isolation with his daughter on an island which used to be inhabited for communal living.  His performance here is exemplary, a nice blend of idealism and radicalism.  Camilla Belle, as his wizened daughter Rose, shows great depth as well.  This is largely her spiritual and emotional journey as she faces life without the only man she has ever loved--her father.  And their bond is fierce, almost too close by any conventional standards.  Jack worries about his health, and what will happen to Rose upon his death.  So he embarks on a romantic and financial venture with Catherine Keener to bring her and her sons to the island to be Rose's family.This addition to Rose's lifestyle is a difficult adjustment.  Her relationship with all three newcomers is challenging and tumultuous--but it is definitely a catalyst to taking Rose in a new direction.  Launched out of complacency, she is forced to take the reins of her life as an individual--no longer part of a pair.  The ending is surprising, thoughtful, and poetic.  The final images have lingered with me.I recommend ""Ballad"" for those looking for something a bit unusual.  Great performances and beautiful cinematography are just two highlights.  But it's the offbeat story and intellectually complex characters that I will remember most.  While, at times, the film can be slightly uneven or heavy-handed--these are minor quibbles.  This is an original film told in an original voice.

914072,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009VRHNI,Lee Armstrong,"[22, 32]","""The Ballad of Jack & Rose"" was directed by Rebecca Miller who is the daughter of playwright Arthur Miller and is the wife of this film's star, Daniel Day Lewis.  Her last screenwriting + directing project ""Angela"" won a 1994 trophy @ the Sundance film festival.  Daniel Day Lewis is one of the most celebrated and unique actors working today.  Since his breakthrough performance in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" and an Oscar for ""My Left Foot"" as well as Oscar nominations for ""In the Name of the Father"" & ""Gangs of New York,"" he has created an impressive body of work.  Lewis who comes from well-known parents, Poet Laureate Cecil Day Lewis & actress Jill Balcon (Nicholas Nickelby, 1947), plays Jack who has inherited a large bank account.  Jack is an interesting mix of counter-cultural commune social experimenter and loving father to his daughter Rose.  With his heart increasingly coming close to wearing out, he worries for his daughter, even as he tries to battle local developer Marty Rance played by Beau Bridges from building on what has traditionally been classified as wetland.  His performance is an interesting mix of grit & determination with love & uncertainty.  His daughter Rose is played Camilla Belle.  She brings to the part a wide-eyed innocence combined with the natural stirrings of a young woman.  Jack brings his girlfriend Kathleen to the island to hopefully have someone to help him through his deterioration and to provide a feminine hand for Rose.  However, rather than bringing Kathleen gradually into their lives, Jack keeps this part of his life totally secret from Rose until the moment when Kathleen arrives with two sons and a trailer full of lamps & assorted belongings.  Kathleen is played by the delightful Catherine Keener who is married to actor Dermot Mulroney.  She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Being John Malkovich"" and has recently appeared as Sean Penn's police partner in ""The Interpreter"" with Nicole Kidman & as the love interest of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin.""  Her son Rodney is a stocky, perhaps gay, hairdresser played by Ryan McDonald who was in ""Bang Bang You're Dead"" and has a small part in ""Fierce People"" that will come out next year with Diane Lane.  Her other son Thaddius is wild & rebellious, experimenting with sex, drugs & reptiles.  As Thaddius, Paul Dano does an excellent job of showing a calm exterior with an interior emotional life wound tight as a spring.  It's the same quality that made his performance as the young serial killer in ""Taking Lives"" with Ashley Judd in 2004 so scary.  Jason Lee has a cameo as Grey, the gardener who provides plants for Rose's garden.  Jena Malone who played Susan Sarandon's daughter in ""Stepmom"" from 1998 and had a small part in ""Cold Mountain"" comes to the island as Red Berry.  It's an interesting cameo part that gives Rose a glimpse of free love as Red Berry & Thaddeus are watched. (...) However, with the family domestic scenes including a copperhead snake in the house and the shotgun assault on the developer, it makes us feel like we've shared the lives of some very unusual but interesting people.

914073,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0009VRHNI,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 10]","Starring Daniel Day-Lewis as Jack, this recent Indie film is very ambitious.  It's set in 1986 in a former commune off the coast of New England.  Once there were 60 people living there, with hippie hopes and dreams.  But that was sixteen years before.  Now there are just two people left - Jack and his 16-year old daughter, Rose, played by Camilla Belle.  This father-daughter combo live their lonely lives in the midst of natural beauty and no modern conveniences. There's a deep bond between them.  But Jack is ill.  He has a heart condition and not long to live.  We can see it from his skeletal shape and the cave-in look of his features.Out of concern for his daughter, he invites a local woman named Kathleen with whom he has been having an affair, to come live with him. He even pays her money to do this.  She moves in with her two teenage sons.  One is a chubby and gay.  The other has a sense of feral evil about him.  They are shocked by the lack of modern conveniences but Kathleen is determined to make it work.What follows is a sad and somewhat warped look at the coming of age sexuality of Rose and an inevitable crisis that brings all the twisted emotions to the surface.  More than anything this film is a mood piece.  And the mood is one of despair, longing and unhappiness.Daniel Day-Lewis is an exceptionally talented actor and his is wonderful in this role as are all the other actors.

Unfortunately, Jack is having heart difficulties, and worried by Rose's promise to die with him, he invites his girlfriend's family over to take care of them.  Too bad his experiment in raising a completely innocent girl made her too innocent, because now the arriving family is a threat to everyone's sanity.There's quite a lot going on in this film as far as characters are concerned.  Jack, the person always trying to control everything around him so that it can all live harmoniously together, has much more going on with his character than he realizes.  Rose is blindly in love with her father, even incestuously.  Kathleen, Jack's girlfriend, is a ""normal person"", but she carries a severe savior complex.  Her two sons suffer from being an overweight, maybe gay hair stylist and a demented, forceful counter-culturist.  Every character in the film is painted distinctly and forceably, creating drama and character development that goes into depths that it almost doesn't even have to.In fact, this movie plays a lot like a first draft.  The characters and story are realized well enough, but the writer/director Rebecca Miller never really takes them out of her head enough for anyone else to really share their experiences with them.  The story itself follows a certain arch, with all the necessary continuances of beginning, middle, end, climax and endouement, character development and motivation, but by the end of the film it's quite clear that Miller doesn't actually know what the story is.There would be a lot of symbolism, mostly Americana.  The fact of the matter is that every character quite easily represents a side of America, an aspect that each holds dear and maintains even when falling into conflict with another aspect.  Yet the overall thesis of the work is entirely lost.  It was starting to grasp its message at the end, but then lost it in the epilogue.  This is a story about a bunch of characters.  That do stuff.Whatever the movie did have in terms of storytelling, however, was lost completely in the direction.  While the photography was pretty good and definitely gave enough lovely imagery to look at, the camera itself never seemed to be put in the right place.  Ninety percent of this movie is in close-up, for no other reason than that it seems Miller didn't figure there was anything else to focus on.  Editing and action is cut fast and frantically in an effort to hide the fact that the shot itself isn't really that important.  In all reasonableness, this work doesn't want to be a movie.What it does have, and what is basically the only thing one can fall back on, is superb performances.  Being that the characters are instrumental and that the performers are very good, the overall grace of the drama is what sustains one's attention enough to sometimes even forget that they're watching something not completely developed yet.  In the end, this is a performance piece, not a film, and makes a good rough draft to a work that may someday be fully developed.(...)",2,A rough first draft?,1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,3268,"['film', 'out', 'very', 'promising', 'idyllic', 'relaxing', 'flow', 'nature', 'natural', 'housing', 'habited', 'one', 'ex-commune', 'member', 'Jack', 'daugther', 'Rose', 'alone', 'world', 'left', 'time', 'work', 'play', 'look', 'clouds', 'sky', 'Unfortunately', 'Jack', 'having', 'heart', 'difficulties', 'worried', 'Rose', 'promise', 'die', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'take', 'care', 'Too', 'bad', 'experiment', 'raising', 'completely', 'innocent', 'girl', 'made', 'too', 'innocent', 'because', 'now', 'arriving', 'family', 'threat', 'everyone', 'sanity.There', 'quite', 'lot', 'going', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'Jack', 'person', 'always', 'trying', 'control', 'everything', 'so', 'can', 'live', 'harmoniously', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'going', 'character', 'Rose', 'blindly', 'love', 'father', 'even', 'incestuously', 'Kathleen', 'Jack', 'girlfriend', 'normal', 'person', 'severe', 'savior', 'complex', 'two', 'sons', 'suffer', 'being', 'overweight', 'maybe', 'gay', 'hair', 'stylist', 'demented', 'forceful', 'counter-culturist', 'character', 'film', 'painted', 'distinctly', 'forceably', 'creating', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'depths', 'almost', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'to.In', 'fact', 'movie', 'lot', 'first', 'draft', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'realized', 'well', 'enough', 'writer/director', 'Rebecca', 'Miller', 'never', 'really', 'head', 'enough', 'anyone', 'else', 'really', 'share', 'experiences', 'story', 'certain', 'arch', 'necessary', 'continuances', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'climax', 'endouement', 'character', 'development', 'motivation', 'end', 'film', 'quite', 'clear', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'what', 'story', 'is.There', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'mostly', 'Americana', 'fact', 'matter', 'character', 'quite', 'easily', 'side', 'America', 'aspect', 'dear', 'maintains', 'even', 'when', 'falling', 'conflict', 'aspect', 'overall', 'thesis', 'work', 'entirely', 'lost', 'was', 'starting', 'grasp', 'message', 'end', 'then', 'lost', 'epilogue', 'story', 'bunch', 'characters', 'do', 'stuff.Whatever', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'however', 'was', 'lost', 'completely', 'direction', 'photography', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'definitely', 'gave', 'enough', 'lovely', 'imagery', 'look', 'camera', 'never', 'seemed', 'be', 'put', 'right', 'place', 'Ninety', 'percent', 'movie', 'close-up', 'other', 'reason', 'Miller', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'was', 'anything', 'else', 'focus', 'Editing', 'action', 'cut', 'fast', 'frantically', 'effort', 'hide', 'fact', 'shot', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'reasonableness', 'work', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'movie.What', 'have', 'what', 'basically', 'only', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'fall', 'back', 'superb', 'performances', 'Being', 'characters', 'are', 'instrumental', 'performers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'overall', 'grace', 'drama', 'what', 'one', 'attention', 'enough', 'sometimes', 'even', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'something', 'not', 'completely', 'developed', 'yet', 'end', 'performance', 'piece', 'not', 'film', 'good', 'rough', 'draft', 'work', 'may', 'someday', 'be', 'fully', 'developed.']",N/A

What great genes flowed into this film!Back to the story.  It's about Jack, an aging hippie, from Scotland, who has built a commune on an island somewhere off the East Coast of the US.  The rest of the tribe has left, including Jack's wife, leaving him alone with their daughter, Rose.  Jack can afford to indulge in his isolationist, idealistic version of paradise, due to a hefty inheritance from his father.  Jack has done everything he can to preserve his way of life and values in Rose, who is the light of his life.  He has taken her out of public school at 11, and apparently has kept her away from other people, even TV.  The opening scene shows Jack and Rose lying on the grass of their roof, dreamily looking at the sky together.  It's an interesting opening because at that point we don't know what their relationship is--it could be an older man and his young lover or it could be father and daughter?  This is just the point.  The two have become everything to each other so that a ""normal"" father-daughter relationship has grown into almost something else.Others here have stressed the incest matter but I don't think that this is really the point.  Miller shows us how this un-natural attachment has developed naturally in this environment.  Jack, for his part, does go to town and has a sexual relationship with a woman there, so he is more able than Rose to realize that what has grown between them is not right.  At the point that we meet these two, a crisis is about to happen to interfere with their utopian life.  Jack is ill with a heart condition and expects not to live much longer, Rose is becoming a woman, and a real estate developer is moving in, spoiling the pristine wetlands that they inhabit.  Something's gotta give and it does.Jack's way of solving the issue is to bring Kathleen, his girlfriend, to live with them.  He figures she will take care of him as he dies and also that she'll provide a mothering influence to Rose, who obviously needs it. Also he promises Kathleen that she'll be well taken care of after he's gone....meaning financially.  Kathleen, played by the always good Catherine Keener, is a complex character herself.  A middle-aged single mother, with teen-aged boys from two different fathers, she struggles with two jobs and lives in the basement of her sister's house.  She does love Jack, has a tendency towards caretaking and clearly could use a financial break. I thought her actions towards the end were surprising but, upon reflection, were understandable.  Her affection for Jack seems real but her older son, Rodney, makes a telling remark as they move in, about when she gets the windfall, to give him half.That's what's so good about the script.  All of these people are flawed but their actions are completely understandable.  That's the mark of a good writer---to make us root for these imperfect people.Some reviewers have criticized the change of pace from the first, quiet, part of the film to the dramatic events that quickly develop.  But I think it's perfect.  Clearly the ideals that exist in Jack's mind have their limitations and his refusal to realize what is happening invites the chaos that ensues.  Indeed he has carried on a dual life for a while, refusing to tell Rose about Kathleen or inviting Kathleen to the island, or even meeting her sons.  Reality is bound to break up his illusions in a big way.I thought the story was well thought-out and holds together.  But what really sells the story is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis.  Without him this could have failed miserably.  I didn't know, when I watched it, that he is the husband of the director, but it shows.  He is already a fine actor, but here he is photographed so lovingly that even if you didn't like him before, you would here.  It reminds me of the many films shot by male directors who were in love with their female stars at the time, most notably Bergman with his various lovers but also Louis Malle/Susan Sarandon and Godard/Anna Karina.  It's a nice switch here to see the woman photographing her lover.I liked her choice of bringing up the intensity of the action to a dramatic climax. It serves the story well. Jack's version of Utopia goes up in flames but his values live on in Rose in the last scene.  Very nice!The cinematography is lovely, the scenery is beautiful, the sets were great.  There are a lot of small details that are well done and add up to the enjoyment of the film. I loved the house with the grass roof.  Beau Bridges is wonderfully soft and puffy as the real estate developer who looks as though he's never done a day's hard work himself in contrast to Jack's lean-ness.  I loved Jack's clothes---expensive, wool jackets and hats.  He didn't get these at JC Penny's or Good Will but they are well worn. Rodney's nylon jacket, that he won't remove.  I liked both boys, one skinny and rodent like, and the other big and sweet and sad.There is a mythic aspect to the film, that I liked, too.  The title, the ""Ballad of Jack and Rose"" suggests something beyond the mundane and there is the charming bedtime story of the little girl and the ox, which reappears at Jack is dying.This is a really artful film that I hope will stand the test of time.  Perhaps as Daniel Day Lewis has come into more prominence with his recent Oscar performances, more people will find this film.  I'd be interested in seeing more collaboration with his wife, too.",5,Thoughtful tale of a father and daughter,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",2013,5765,"['-may', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'so', 'much', 'like',

But as I watched this film I realized it had a lot of deep meaningful messages in it. It's the story of a young girl who has been sheltered all her life. She's lived a very innocent life on a small island with her father. Everything is storybook and perfect in her eyes, but when she is forced to deal with change she can't accept the shock of it all. Her emotions just run rampant and she does some very unforgiving things in an attempt to hold on to that idealic lifestyle she had become accustomed to. The film is about living a life free of progress and how progress can deeply effect certain people to the point that they end up doing things they might later regret in an attempt to hold on to that perfect life they feel is being stolen from them. In this story Daniel Day-Lewis is a loving father with an ever worsening heart condition who is trying to help give his daughter a future and protection after he passes away. Through her mistakes she learns some lessons and gains the strength to continue living on her own once her father has passed away. She loves her father so much, and he loves her equally that their relationship sometimes nearly goes in the taboo path of incest, but it's a,love so intense that the sexual feelings they have is just a reflection for the strong bond they have in thier relationship. It's a story about learning to accept change when it does happen. This film kept reminding me of another coming of age film I saw some time ago called ""Friends"", a very touching film about young love that Elton John wrote the soundtrack music for. If you enjoyed this I am certain you'll like that film as well, though it is hard to find and not on dvd yet.

Which is not to say this indie effort doesn't deserve watching. There's much here to be absorbed by.Daniel Day-Lewis, as always, brings intensity and depth to a conflicted character, not always easy to like. The remaining true believer of an idealistic 1970s commune, Jack is the father of a devoted adolescent daughter, Rose, the two of them like Prospero and Miranda on a New England offshore island. Deeply in love with her father, Rose is determined to deny his failing health and reacts with barely suppressed rage when he brings a girlfriend and her two teenage sons to live on the island with them.With all the components here for domestic conflict - in a house without TV - writer/director Miller has more than enough material. But while dysfunctional complexities multiply, a housing developer is putting up big colonial-style houses in a nearby wetlands and a gentle young man working for a florist on the mainland also figures into the story.

Having admired its director, Rebecca Miller in all her films, we were right in seeing it in the wide screen of the main theater because that seems to be the perfect way to watch this intimate picture.Ms. Miller takes us to an island off the coast of the continental mainland to set her story. As the film opens we watch Jack Flavin with his teen age daughter as they are perched on the roof of their strange cabin with the roof being made of lawn grass. They are father and daughter who have stayed in the land where years ago, had been a commune. We don't know what happened to Rose's mother, and nothing is clarified. We gather Jack and Rose have a special bond that at times border in incest.Jack believes in keeping the island the way it is; development is coming fast and furious in the way of luxury homes being built in what probably will be a gated community where people of the same background and financial means will live, in sharp contrast as the commune idea that attracted Jack to the place. Jack, having inherited money from his father is financially secure, but still lives in a primitive way in a basic type of life. We see Jack as he takes pills; we realize he is not a well man.When Jack takes a side trip to the mainland, he visits Kathleen, a single mother with two teen aged sons. Jack convinces her to come to live with him at the island. What Jack doesn't count is on Rose's reaction to the invasion to her space. In fact, the hatred for the invaders is instant. Katheleen, a kind woman herself, tries to reach Rose without any success. Rodney, one of the sons, has a weight problem, and has studied to be a hairdresser. Thaddius, is the rebel, who has an eye on the beautiful Rose.Jack's basic intention for bringing Kathleen is to help him during his last days because he senses his days are numbered. When Thaddius suffers an accident, Kathleen takes the opportunity to go back home, leaving Jack and Rose to fend for themselves.Ms. Miller takes an elegiac look at the situation making Jack into an almost Shakespearean character, that is, bigger than life. Jack is lovingly photographed in his many moods. The beautiful Rose's face shows all the emotions going on inside her. The director ought to be congratulated for involving us in the film and making us care for what will happen to Jack and Rose.Daniel Day-Lewis is an actor who doesn't work much these days and that is our loss! As Jack, Mr. Day-Lewis has the rare opportunity to show his vulnerability and seems to be naked in front of our eyes because he doesn't hide the emotions from us. We know at any given moment what this man is thinking and what makes him tick. Mr. Day-Lewis gives a fabulous performance as he dominates the picture completely.Camilla Belle is Rose. This young actress proves he is up to the task the director demands of her character. Not only is she beautiful, but she clearly exudes an innate intelligence that pays off in her portrayal of the girl who sees her world fall apart and has no way to stop what is killing her father.Catherine Keener makes a valuable contribution to the film as Kathleen. She clearly is a gentle soul who is in love with Jack and wants to stay with him until the end. That is not meant to be because Jack realizes that in ""importing"" her to the island she gets in the way of the perfect balance between father and daughter.Ryan McDonald makes the confused Rodney come alive. This young actor is a natural. The rest of the cast include minor appearances by Beau Bridges, Jason Lee, Jena Malone and Paul Dano, who plays Thaddius the other son.""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"" is clearly not for a wide audience because it's too intelligent to get a broader distribution, but the fans of Rebecca Miller will always cherish this film for what she brought to it and for the magnificent performances she got from her cast.

914085,A3PJXZOYC8026Z,B0009VRHNI,Simon Crowe,"[9, 23]","Quite possibly the worst film of 2005, Rebecca Miller's THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE is an obnxious & overly determined bore. Jack (Daniel Day-Lewis, the director's husband) is the last member of a '60s commune living on some potentially valuable island property off the East Coast in the mid-'80s. The land surrounding Jack's commune is the target of a developer (Beau Bridges) with whom Jack has an adversarial relationship.Jack's daughter Rose (talented newcomer Camilla Belle) who appears to be about 15, lives with her father, does not go to school, apparently has no friends, and not the faintest understanding of the emotional and physiological changes she's going through.We're meant to sympathize with Jack (who is dying of a heart condition) as the last of a dying breed, but in fact he is monstrous. Jack and Rose's delicate and much too sexually tinged relationship is disrupted by the arrival of Jack's girlfriend (Catherine Keener) and her two teenage sons - one gay, the other a budding sociopath. Keener's character realizes Rose is in trouble but Jack seems oblivious.The real villain of the piece is of course capitalism itself. Jack cant stand against the forces of development by himself but ironically has no hesitation about using his inherited wealth to manipulate people. Day-Lewis burrows in as usual and makes the best of it, but some of these scenes (particularly the Jack-Rose stuff) are just unplayable.A film filled with rank hypocrisy and some unfortunate ideas about child rearing, THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE is a disappointment on every level.",1,good cast in pretentious nonsense,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,1576,"['Quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'film', '2005', 'Rebecca', 'Miller', 'THE', 'BALLAD', 'OF', 'JACK', 'AND', 'ROSE', 'obnxious', 'overly', 'determined', 'bore', 'Jack', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'director', 'husband', 'last', 'member', ""'60s"", 'commune', 'living', 'potentially', 'valuable', 'island', 'property', 'East', 'Coast', ""mid-'80s"", 'land', 'surrounding', 'Jack', 'commune', 'target', 'developer', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'whom', 'Jack', 'adversarial', 'relationship.Jack', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'talented', 'newcomer', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'who', 'be', 'about', '15', 'father', 'not', 'go', 'school', 'apparently', 'friends', 'not', 'faintest', 'understanding', 'emotional', 'physiological', 'changes', 'going', 'through.We', ""'re"", 'meant', 'sympathize', 'Jack', 'who', 'dying', 'heart', 'condition', 'last', 'dying', 'breed', 'fact', 'monstrous', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'delicate', 'much', 'too', 'sexually', 'tinged', 'relationship', 'disrupted', 'arrival', 'Jack', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'two', 'teenage', 'sons', 'one', 'gay', 'other', 'budding', 'sociopath', 'Keener', 'character', 'realizes', 'Rose', 'trouble', 'Jack', 'oblivious.The', 'real', 'villain', 'piece', 'course', 'capitalism', 'Jack', 'cant', 'stand', 'forces', 'development', 'ironically', 'hesitation', 'using', 'inherited', 'wealth', 'manipulate', 'people', 'Day-Lewis', 'burrows', 'as', 'usual', 'best', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'Jack-Rose', 'stuff', 'are', 'just', 'unplayable.A', 'film', 'filled', 'rank', 'hypocrisy', 'unfortunate', 'ideas', 'child', 'rearing', 'THE', 'BALLAD', 'OF', 'JACK', 'AND', 'ROSE', 'disappointment', 'level']",N/A

I thought that Daniel Day Lewis was great as usual and the very underrated Katherine Keener was also very good. This is a simple and complex story all rolled into one.

914087,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0009VRHNI,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[3, 6]","I was expecting to be moved a great deal by this indie film about the dysfunctional relationship between an ex-hippie single dad and his possessive teenage daughter, but dued to it's complex characters and story, I was somewhat disappointed and bored while viewing this film. I certainly didn't find myself feeling sympathetic towards Rose(Camilla Belle) who was possessive, selfish, and rebellious. She's just spoiled rotten by too much love from Jack(Daniel Day-Lewis).Jack, who is terminally ill lives on the New England Coast with her 16 year old daughter who hasn't had much interaction with people since she was withdrew from school at the age of 10. One day, he decided to invite his girlfriend Kathleen(Katherine Keener) and her two boys to live with him and Rose. The move in upsets Rose a great deal, and she's very jealous and worry that her father's love for her would diminish now that there's another woman in the house. Gradually, Rose becomes friends with Rodney(Ryan McDonald) whom she wanted to explore with sexually, but ultimately gets rejected, and he ended up giving her a tomboy haircut that shocked Jack and Kathleen. However, she soon lose her virginity to Rodney's unlikeable brother Thaddius(Paul Dano) who was rather promiscuous. That even upset Jack futhermore, and he threatens to punish Thaddius for his behaviours. Rose continues to be disturbing towards Kathleen in hoping that it would turn her away. Then Jack is obligated to choose between keeping her daughter and the love of his life....I understand that there hasn't been anyone involved in Jack and Rose's life for many years, that all of a sudden their relationship becomes volatile when the loving and kind Kathleen steps into the picture, and things start to go wrong in many  ways, but their relationship was too intense and unhealthy even that was the ultimate problem to begin with.Even with great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis, Camilla Belle, and Katherine Keener, this overly ambitious family drama/coming of age movie is just too hard to digest. The recent Dear Frankie was far more entertaining and touching than this film. You have to be a huge fan of one of the three leads to appreciate this film better. As for me, I enjoyed Katherine Keener's performance and role the most despite not having as much screentime as she deserved.",3,Dysfunctional Father-Daughter Relationship.,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,2337,"['was', 'expecting', 'be', 'moved', 'great', 'deal', 'indie', 'film', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship', 'ex-hippie', 'single', 'dad', 'possessive', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'dued', 'complex', 'characters', 'story', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'bored', 'viewing', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'feeling', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Rose', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'who', 'was', 'possessive', 'selfish', 'rebellious', 'just', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'too', 'much', 'Jack', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', '.Jack', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill', 'lives', 'New', 'England', 'Coast', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'interaction', 'people', 'was', 'withdrew', 'school', 'age', '10', 'One', 'day', 'decided', 'invite', 'girlfriend', 'Kathleen', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'two', 'boys', 'live', 'Rose', 'move', 'upsets', 'Rose', 'great', 'deal', 'very', 'jealous', 'worry', 'father', 'love', 'would', 'diminish', 'now', 'woman', 'house', 'Gradually', 'Rose', 'friends', 'Rodney', 'Ryan', 'McDonald', 'whom', 'wanted', 'explore', 'sexually', 'ultimately', 'rejected', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'tomboy', 'haircut', 'shocked', 'Jack', 'Kathleen', 'However', 'soon', 'lose', 'virginity', 'Rodney', 'unlikeable', 'brother', 'Thaddius', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'was', 'rather', 'promiscuous', 'even', 'upset', 'Jack', 'futhermore', 'punish', 'Thaddius', 'behaviours', 'Rose', 'be', 'disturbing', 'towards', 'Kathleen', 'hoping', 'would', 'turn', 'away', 'Then', 'Jack', 'obligated', 'choose', 'keeping', 'daughter', 'love', 'life', '.I', 'understand', ""n't"", 'been', 'anyone', 'involved', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'life', 'many', 'years', 'sudden', 'relationship', 'becomes', 'volatile', 'when', 'loving', 'kind', 'Kathleen', 'picture', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'many', 'ways', 'relationship', 'was', 'too', 'intense', 'unhealthy', 'even', 'was', 'ultimate', 'problem', 'begin', 'with.Even', 'great', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'Camilla', 'Belle', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'family', 'drama/coming', 'age', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'hard', 'digest', 'recent', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'touching', 'film', 'have', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'one', 'three', 'leads', 'appreciate', 'film', 'better', 'enjoyed', 'Katherine', 'Keener', 'performance', 'role', 'most', 'not', 'having', 'as', 'much', 'screentime', 'deserved']",N/A
914088,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B0009VRHNI,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","***This review contains some PLOT SPOILERS***Released in 2005 and directed by Rebecca Miller, Daniel Day-Lewis's wife, ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"" tells the story of a Scottish immigrant, Jack (Day-Lewis), and his daughter, Rose, who live alone on an isle off the East coast. The time is 1986 and their home is an ex-commune that attracted a lot of people in the early 70s.Jack's wealthy due to an inheritance, but he's struggling with a weak heart and could buy the farm any day. He suddenly realizes that his daughter's attachment to him is getting unhealthy when she declares she's going to die when he dies, which is magnified by the fact that she's coming-of-age. So he makes the rash decision to have his sometime-girlfriend and her two sons from the mainland to come live with them. The ""experiment"" doesn't go well because it stirs up the jealous wrath of Rose, not to mention it's her first real exposure to society -- and sexuality. On top of all this, Jack conflicts with a land developer (Beau Bridges) who's building colonial-style homes on the wetlands next to the ex-commune.Although I loved this film my wife called it ""stupid,"" indicating that this is pretty much a love it/hate it piece.NOTEWORTHY ITEMS:- Although there's thankfully no incest the subject does come up (which is probably what turned my wife off). Boundaries must be established in any loving relationship, ahead of time, if you know what I mean.- Although the story takes place in the USA it was filmed on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Good locations.- Everyone talks about how beautiful the girl who plays Rose is (Camilla Belle), but -- c'mon -- what is she, 16 years-old? Jack's redheaded girlfriend (Catherine Keener) is the real beauty here. She fills out a pair of jeans real nice, lol.- The two sons of Jack's girlfriend are like day and night. Rodney is intelligent, unique and nigh-spiritual, while Thadius possesses a rodent-like feral disposition and isn't remotely appealing. Jenna Malone plays a friend visiting from the mainland; I couldn't figure out what she found attractive about Thadius, except maybe that he was the only eligible, virile male within 50 miles.- Rose has her first-time sexual experience and I felt sorry for the poor girl. The scene successfully shows that sex apart from true love (which includes commitment in my book) is mechanical, boring and meaningless.- Jack is an ex-hippie radical idealist who lives free of the shackles of capitalism (but mostly because of his inheritance), but the counterculture movement expired long ago. It's only natural that he would conflict with the housing developer pushing ""progress."" But what do you do when you discover you're not so different from your nemesis and he's actual a quality soul?- The psychology is obvious and interesting. Jack's a good man and father but he made a mistake to isolate Rose on the island with him. Her attachment grew unhealthy and he wisely sets a proper boundary. He also asks her to forgive him.- The soundtrack includes songs by Bob Dylan and Creedance. I don't usually like Dylan but a great song by him is included here -- ""One More Cup of Coffee."" Watch for it late in the story when Jack and Rose leave the island to confront the real estate developer. Unfortunately it's only a snippet.- Did they take the names Jack and Rose from ""Titanic""?FINAL ANALYSIS: What I like best about ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"" is its originality and unpredictability. I'm personally weary of 'summer blockbusters' and everything that goes with 'em. A movie like this is the perfect remedy.The film runs 10 minutes shy of 2 hours.GRADE: A-",4,Passing away / Coming of age,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,3624,"['***This', 'review', 'PLOT', 'SPOILERS***Released', '2005', 'directed', 'Rebecca', 'Miller', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'wife', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'story', 'Scottish', 'immigrant', 'Jack', 'Day-Lewis', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'who', 'live', 'alone', 'isle', 'East', 'coast', 'time', '1986', 'home', 'ex-commune', 'attracted', 'lot', 'people', 'early', '70s.Jack', 'wealthy', 'due', 'inheritance', 'struggling', 'weak', 'heart', 'could', 'buy', 'farm', 'day', 'suddenly', 'daughter', 'attachment', 'getting', 'unhealthy', 'when', 'going', 'die', 'when', 'magnified', 'fact', 'coming-of-age', 'rash', 'decision', 'have', 'sometime-girlfriend', 'two', 'sons', 'mainland', 'come', 'live', 'experiment', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'up', 'jealous', 'wrath', 'Rose', 'not', 'mention', 'first', 'real', 'exposure', 'society', 'sexuality', 'top', 'Jack', 'land', 'developer', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'who', 'building', 'colonial-style', 'homes', 'wetlands', 'ex-commune.Although', 'loved', 'film', 'wife', 'called', 'stupid', 'indicating', 'pretty', 'much', 'love', 'it/hate', 'ITEMS', 'thankfully', 'incest', 'subject', 'come', 'up', 'probably', 'what', 'turned', 'wife', 'Boundaries', 'must', 'be', 'established', 'loving', 'relationship', 'ahead', 'time', 'know', 'what', 'mean.-', 'story', 'place', 'USA', 'was', 'filmed', 'Prince', 'Edward', 'Island', 'Canada', 'Good', 'locations.-', 'Everyone', 'talks', 'how', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'who', 'Rose', 'Camilla', 'Belle', ""c'mon"", 'what', '16', 'years-old', 'Jack', 'redheaded', 'girlfriend', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'real', 'beauty', 'here', 'out', 'pair', 'jeans', 'real', 'nice', 'lol.-', 'two', 'sons', 'Jack', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'day', 'night', 'Rodney', 'intelligent', 'unique', 'nigh-spiritual', 'Thadius', 'rodent-like', 'feral', 'disposition', ""n't"", 'remotely', 'appealing', 'Jenna', 'Malone', 'friend', 'visiting', 'mainland', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'found', 'attractive', 'Thadius', 'maybe', 'was', 'only', 'eligible', 'virile', 'male', '50', 'miles.-', 'Rose', 'first-time', 'sexual', 'experience', 'felt', 'sorry', 'poor', 'girl', 'scene', 'successfully', 'sex', 'apart', 'true', 'love', 'commitment', 'book', 'mechanical', 'boring', 'meaningless.-', 'Jack', 'ex-hippie', 'radical', 'idealist', 'who', 'free', 'shackles', 'capitalism', 'mostly', 'inheritance', 'counterculture', 'movement', 'expired', 'long', 'ago', 'only', 'natural', 'would', 'conflict', 'housing', 'developer', 'pushing', 'progress', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'discover', ""'re"", 'not', 'so', 'different', 'nemesis', 'actual', 'quality', 'soul', 'psychology', 'obvious', 'interesting', 'Jack', 'good', 'man', 'father', 'made', 'mistake', 'isolate', 'Rose', 'island', 'attachment', 'grew', 'unhealthy', 'wisely', 'proper', 'boundary', 'also', 'forgive', 'him.-', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Creedance', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'like', 'Dylan', 'great', 'song', 'included', 'here', 'One', 'More', 'Cup', 'Coffee', 'Watch', 'late', 'story', 'when', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'leave', 'island', 'confront', 'real', 'estate', 'developer', 'only', 'snippet.-', 'Did', 'take', 'names', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'Titanic', 'FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'What', 'like', 'best', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'originality', 'unpredictability', ""'m"", 'personally', 'weary', ""'summer"", 'blockbusters', 'everything', ""'em"", 'movie', 'perfect', 'remedy.The', 'film', '10', 'minutes', 'shy', '2', 'hours.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A
