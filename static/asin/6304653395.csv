An entire rogues gallery of defects, including deep black crush, pasty release print looking skin tones, plugged up and constricted contrast ranges, etc. etc. All in all you wind up with something that looks just like the height of video quality, from around about 1990. It's not even for sure, from the look and feel, that the original transfer was at 2k. It may be a 1k transfer now scaled up to Blu-Ray resolution presentation.Oh, and this is a featureless disc. Not even a menu. No extras at all. You can't even access a pop up while it is playing. It can be started and stopped.

430524,A2PBV1899CX3TE,6304653395,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[4, 5]","Yukio Mishima was a fascinating writer, and as interesting as his writing was, it was almost overshadowed by his real life. One of Mishima's overarching themes was perfection, and how once perfection is achieved--for instance, a body builder or warrior attains his peak physical form--then decline is inevitable. Age takes its toll, and Mishima argues that he would prefer death rather than witness that decline. This is the theme of his extended essay, called Sun and Steel, and also the theme of The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, where the young acolyte burns down the temple rather than see it fade from its former glory. Sun and Steel, in particular foretells Mishima's own fate, as he died after forming his own militia and calling for an overthrow of the post WWII Japanese government. When his coup d'&eacute;tat failed, he committed the ritual samurai suicide, Hari Kari, on November 25, 1970.Destroying something when it begins to fall from the state of perfection is also the theme of The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. The story is set in England instead of Japan, with Kris Kristofferson playing an American sailor named Jim Cameron (I'm the King of the World!), but it doesn't really translate that well in this filmed adaptation. Mishima's writing is very intense, and he can be making a completely reasonable argument, but then he will just take a leap into the irrational. It would be hard to translate to film, and though a valiant effort is made, it falls far short of the mark.Sarah Miles plays an Englishwoman living in the port city of Dover in Britain. She sells antiques and is a single mother raising a young teenage son. She is very close to her son, perhaps too close, and they share many passions. They both fall in love with the American sailor played by Kristofferson, but in their own ways. The son sees him as a hero, but only as long as he remains true to the sea. When he decides to settle down with the boy's mother, he sees that as a betrayal.Also complicating the situation is a young nihilist at the boy's school who psychologically bullies the students, dubbing himself the chief, and assigning them all numbers in the pecking order. The chief feeds the boy's sense of betrayal, and you just know that things are not going to end well--for anyone, but especially for Kristofferson, and the poor cat, Sebastian.Sarah Miles and Kristofferson both do a good job with the basic story of the romance. The boy, played by Jonathan Kahn, the chief (Earl Rhodes), and the rest of their group are O.K., acting-wise--but they are all just so IRRITATING! The Chief was no doubt meant to be irritating to adults and those not under his sway, but was he not also meant to be charismatic? I didn't sense any of that, he just seemed like an arrogant cry baby. The film comes off as a mishmash of  The Love Boat, Love American Style, an after school special, a little bit of soft core, and The Lord of the Flies. It really doesn't do the Mishima material justice.Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters - Criterion Collection(1985) Directed by Paul SchraderThe Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Seaby Yukio MishimaTHE TEMPLE OF THE GOLDEN PAVILIONby Yukio MishimaSun and Steelby Yukio MishimaForbidden Colorsby Yukio MishimaConfessions of a Mask (New Directions Paperbook)by Yukio MishimaTrouble in Mind(1985) Kris Kristofferson was HawkSongwriter(1984) Kris Kristofferson was Blackie BuckThe Man Who Loved Cat Dancing(1973) Sarah Miles was CatherineBlow Up(1966) Sarah Miles was Patricia--------He gave his soul to the sea and his heart to a woman.

430525,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,6304653395,Chip Kaufmann,"[1, 1]","It had been many years since I first saw THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA. I had forgotten what a beautiful film it is to look at and what a perverse film it is thematically. I've never read the original Yukio Mishima story but considering his life and death, I shouldn't be surprised by the content. I hadn't read the story before seeing the film and now I'm glad that I didn't. A number of reviews talk about how it doesn't work in its English setting transplanted from the Japanese. That may be but with nothing to compare it to, I found the English seaside setting most effective. Now, out of curiosity, I'll seek out the original and make my own comparison. The inherent British class system among the boys lends itself to the events that unfold. The head boy, known simply as ""The Chief"" (a wonderfully disturbing performance by Earl Rhodes), comes from a wealthy and privileged background. He is all intellect and no emotion making him a Nietzschean prototype who despises the weak and seeks perfection in all forms. The other boys, who aspire to his position and wishing to curry favor, hang on his every move and go along with him in each increasingly disturbing act that he commits. One of these boys, Jonathan (Jonathan Kahn), is the central character of the film for it is his connection with The Chief and with his widowed mother (Sarah Miles) that is the primary focus of SAILOR.Despite the film's great beauty (lovingly photographed by Douglas Slocombe) and evocative music from Johnny Mandel (M*A*S*H) or perhaps because of it, the film becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch ***SPOILERS*** as we are invited to take part in voyeurism (the boy secretly watches his mother undress in her bedroom), dispassionate violence (the boys dissect the Chief's house cat), and a final scene that saddened me. Perhaps that's the point. Writer-director Lewis John Carlino started his career as a playwright (THE BRICK & THE ROSE) before becoming a screenwriter (THE MECHANIC) and occasional director (THE GREAT SANTINI, CLASS). He knows how to write dialogue and how to bring characters to life. My question is...Why these characters? There is much food for thought here but most of it is of a very depressing nature. The love scenes between Miles and Kris Kristofferson are no longer scandalous just erotic and they heighten the impact the film ulltimtely has. Back in 1976 this was considered a mainstream film that many people went to see (the spread in PLAYBOY didn't hurt) and that was all but dismissed by critics. Today it would be an arthouse indie that would garner critical awards and audience indifference (think NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Along with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE it remains one of the most pessimistic movies ever made.

430530,A30TW9R3R0NODW,6304653395,Mark Kittell,"[4, 4]","This is an interesting film about an American sailor who decides to give-up the sea life for an English woman who seems to be in need of sexual gratification after the death of her husband (who may have been killed by unsuspected foul play). Unfortunately, her son is a member of secret gang led by some arrogant kid who hates adults and their rules that have created laws and civilization in order to protect the ""weak."" He even poisons a house cat as ""punishment"" for leaving behind its wild ""nature"" and living a pampered life. This is also the fate that awaits the sailor. This review isn't for the film itself but the blu-ray edition. If this had been released by a major studio, I think we might have expected a decent release from the best available elements. But this Shout release obviously used a very poor source for this ""high-def"" transfer. The images are generally washed-out, definition is poor, flesh-tones tend to be on the red side, there are specks, dirt and imperfections galore, and dark scenes are devoid of clarity, marred especially by pixel-failure where whole portions of the screen seemed blanked-out. There was obviously no attempt to ""clean"" it up. Just horrible. The DVD version is far superior to this, if only because the imperfections are less obvious.",1,Awsomely awful blu-ray transfer,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1285,"['interesting', 'film', 'American', 'sailor', 'who', 'give-up', 'sea', 'life', 'English', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'need', 'sexual', 'gratification', 'death', 'husband', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'unsuspected', 'foul', 'play', 'Unfortunately', 'son', 'member', 'secret', 'gang', 'led', 'arrogant', 'kid', 'who', 'adults', 'rules', 'have', 'created', 'laws', 'civilization', 'order', 'protect', 'weak', 'even', 'house', 'cat', 'punishment', 'leaving', 'wild', 'nature', 'living', 'pampered', 'life', 'also', 'fate', 'sailor', 'review', ""n't"", 'film', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'major', 'studio', 'think', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'decent', 'release', 'best', 'available', 'elements', 'Shout', 'release', 'obviously', 'used', 'very', 'poor', 'source', 'high-def', 'transfer', 'images', 'are', 'generally', 'washed-out', 'definition', 'poor', 'flesh-tones', 'tend', 'be', 'red', 'side', 'are', 'specks', 'dirt', 'imperfections', 'galore', 'dark', 'scenes', 'are', 'devoid', 'clarity', 'marred', 'especially', 'pixel-failure', 'where', 'whole', 'portions', 'screen', 'seemed', 'blanked-out', 'was', 'obviously', 'attempt', 'clean', 'up', 'Just', 'horrible', 'DVD', 'version', 'far', 'superior', 'only', 'imperfections', 'are', 'less', 'obvious']",The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea VHS

The cinematography is gorgeous, but the cruelty overshadows it. Thank God for DVD. I was able to stop the scene, and go to the next, when they are about to ""operate"" on the cat. And I am putting this mildly!!! I would like to take those kids, and castrate them myself!!!!The scene with them on the row boat is no better. This is where the Chief little brat (and i am being nice!) throws a fire cracker up in the air, the seagull catches it,and blows up and dies!!! Yikes, i can't believe i am explaining this stuff!The sex is no big deal! I could have directed it better myself!At least the film folk put in that no animals were harmed during the making of the film! That would be evil in itself.I wonder nearly 30 years after what the kid actors think of this film ..they are in their 40's now... and what Kris Kristofferson thought of all of this... the ending doesn't go into detail. You know what's going to happen... these kids like the Manson Family too much! anyhoo, that's my story and i am sticking to it!!!",1,"A little Sex and a Whole lotta ocean, BUT NO ANIMAL CRUELTY!!!",1137024000,"01 12, 2006",2006,1157,"['purchased', 'wierd', 'film', 'today', '1/2', 'price', 'media', 'play.I', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'sea', 'film', 'point', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'cruelty', 'Thank', 'God', 'DVD', 'was', 'able', 'stop', 'scene', 'go', 'next', 'when', 'are', 'operate', 'cat', 'am', 'putting', 'mildly', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'kids', 'castrate', 'scene', 'row', 'boat', 'better', 'where', 'Chief', 'little', 'brat', 'i', 'am', 'being', 'nice', 'fire', 'cracker', 'up', 'air', 'seagull', 'up', 'dies', 'Yikes', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'i', 'am', 'explaining', 'stuff', 'sex', 'big', 'deal', 'could', 'have', 'directed', 'better', 'least', 'film', 'folk', 'put', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'evil', 'itself.I', 'wonder', 'nearly', '30', 'years', 'what', 'kid', 'actors', 'think', 'film', '..they', 'are', '40', 'now', 'what', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'thought', 'ending', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'kids', 'Manson', 'Family', 'too', 'much', 'anyhoo', 'story', 'i', 'am', 'sticking']",The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea VHS
430532,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6304653395,"Promise ""promise""","[5, 5]","There is much to like in this film.  It's certainly stylish, has nice shots of the sea and the English countryside.  The actors, Kristofferson and Miles were at the peak of their appeal, and yes, there are plenty of explicit love scenes.  However there are a lot of problems, too.  The Amazon reviewer does a good job of laying them out.I found reading some of the reviews of Mishima's novel from which the film is made very useful.  It makes much more sense in the context of Japanese culture.  Translating it into Western culture robs the story of any credibility, in my opinion.  Kristofferson, too, is quintessentially American and brings a very realistic quality to this tale which is quite spare and almost surreal.  Mishima's style can make you accept the story he's telling but when it's translated into this realistic, Western setting, much more needs to be explained in order for the film to work.The ""Chief,"" a young boy who obviously has a dreadful home life, is presented as a psychopath whose cruelty to animals is justified, he thinks, by his superior mentality.  Think Leopold and Loeb.  I found it hard to believe that he would have been able to get so far with this group of boys, given the fact that they were all from apparently well to do families.  The mother, played by Sarah Miles,  dislikes this boy but somehow her son manages to keep close company with the group, to the point where he is carried away with the insanity the Chief teaches.  The boy, Jonathan, at first is enamored of Jim, the sailor, played by Kristofferson and it seems to be a healthy connection.  I found the change in Jonathan to lack credibility.  No doubt it works in the novel; here it just seems terribly odd and oddly terrible.  The actor playing Jonathan isn't great; maybe that's part of the problem.It seems that quite a few of the reviewers here are fans of the film for the sex scenes.  If that's all you're looking for, I'm sure you can find better ones elsewhere.  If you're looking for the meaning of the tale, then I recommend reading the book.",3,Loses something in the translation,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,2055,"['much', 'like', 'film', 'certainly', 'stylish', 'nice', 'shots', 'sea', 'English', 'countryside', 'actors', 'Kristofferson', 'Miles', 'were', 'peak', 'appeal', 'yes', 'are', 'plenty', 'explicit', 'love', 'scenes', 'However', 'are', 'lot', 'problems', 'too', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'good', 'job', 'laying', 'out.I', 'found', 'reading', 'reviews', 'Mishima', 'novel', 'film', 'made', 'very', 'useful', 'much', 'more', 'sense', 'context', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'Translating', 'Western', 'culture', 'robs', 'story', 'credibility', 'opinion', 'Kristofferson', 'too', 'quintessentially', 'American', 'very', 'realistic', 'quality', 'tale', 'quite', 'spare', 'almost', 'surreal', 'Mishima', 'style', 'can', 'make', 'accept', 'story', 'telling', 'when', 'translated', 'realistic', 'Western', 'setting', 'much', 'more', 'needs', 'be', 'explained', 'order', 'film', 'work.The', 'Chief', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'obviously', 'dreadful', 'home', 'life', 'presented', 'psychopath', 'cruelty', 'animals', 'justified', 'superior', 'mentality', 'Think', 'Leopold', 'Loeb', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'so', 'far', 'group', 'boys', 'given', 'fact', 'were', 'apparently', 'well', 'do', 'families', 'mother', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Miles', 'boy', 'somehow', 'son', 'keep', 'close', 'company', 'group', 'point', 'where', 'carried', 'away', 'insanity', 'Chief', 'teaches', 'boy', 'Jonathan', 'first', 'enamored', 'Jim', 'sailor', 'played', 'Kristofferson', 'be', 'healthy', 'connection', 'found', 'change', 'Jonathan', 'lack', 'credibility', 'doubt', 'novel', 'here', 'just', 'terribly', 'odd', 'oddly', 'terrible', 'actor', 'playing', 'Jonathan', ""n't"", 'great', 'maybe', 'part', 'problem.It', 'quite', 'few', 'reviewers', 'here', 'are', 'fans', 'film', 'sex', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'looking', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'find', 'better', 'ones', 'elsewhere', ""'re"", 'looking', 'meaning', 'tale', 'then', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book']",The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea VHS

Unfortunately I wasn't familiar enough with each intimate scene to determine whether the blu-ray is the full version or not, I'll see if I can find more detail to watch for as far as any censorship.  But I can say that I was not as impressed with Sarah Miles, somehow the lovemaking facial expressions were bizarre rather than exciting.  Cheesy editing for some of the fades and so forth to show time passing.  I don't know - I have a lot of old movies that still are just as hot to watch now as they were when I was young, so I had hoped this would be too.  Honestly, Sarah Miles is more interesting in Hope and Glory... although the two scenes of her alone are alluring, more than the scenes with Kris K... and those do appear to be intact (yet still awkward somehow).  The disc has zero special features - there is a &#34;menu&#34; but all it does is play the movie, I don't think it even has any subtitles.
