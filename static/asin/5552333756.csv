195935,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,5552333756,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 0]","""Southern Comfort"" is a powerful, gripping documentary chronicling the final year of Robert Eads.Eads was born a woman (his son and his parents still refer to him in feminine ways), but has transitioned to masculinity--and in a tragic twist, is dying from uterine/ovarian cancer. He has a ""chosen family"" down in Georgia--young men who were born women, and Lola,a woman who is transitioning from manhood. In his final year, Eads finds love with Lola. On the surface, they look like the conventional heterosexual couple. Eads says that when he was female, he wasn't a lesbian, but a straight man who loved woman. He finds a woman who is still, to a certain extent, a man.""Southern Comfort"" is the name of the transgender convention that Eads and his friends attends. Eads describes it as a cotillion/coming out party. Despite his frailty, Eads is able to attend and make a speech. Tragically, Eads has been denied medical care... simply because he's transgender. One scene juxtaposes Maxwell (a former female) and his girlfriend Corry (a former male) taking hormonal injection shots, while Eads is taking his cancer drugs. He introduces his friend Cassie, an outcast of sorts because her husband was formerly female. Eads says of Cassie ""she doesn't have a lesbian bone in her body.""""Southern Comfort"" is a powerful documentary about the human condition and gender identity. Eads' call for compassion resonates with the Golden Rule and the Hippocratic Oath ""first, do no harm."" It ends with his ashes being scattered under a Christmas tree.

The central character, who has become a man, is ironically dying of ovarian cancer.  He was repeatedly refused treatment by the medical establishment because of his identity as a transsexual.  The unconventionality of these individuals is touchingly contrasted with their fight for basic human rights, and their desire to enjoy the simple pleasures of domestic life taken for granted by most Americans.  Despite some petty differences, they achieve compassion, humor, and tolerance in their interractions among themselves and with their &quot;straight&quot; families and friends.  The dignity of their struggle brilliantly reveals that it is actually &quot;mainstream&quot; culture which is freakish, both in terms of its outrageous persecution and its irrational phobia of them.  The final line of the film really stayed with me (I'm paraphrasing): &quot;Nature delights in diversity, why can't human beings?&quot;  I was tempted to give the film five stars but I felt the cinematography could have been more creative and the editing could have been tighter.

Kate Davis has given  us insight into a community that is sadly neglected by society at large - the transgender community of male to female and female to male who are caourageous enough to follow their convictions that they were born with the wrong body.  The film documents the last four seasons in the life of Robert Eads, a warm, crusty guy who was denied full gender change surgery by the medical profession in Georgia and thus still retains his cervix and uterus which have become malignant and eventually cause his death.  His extended family of two other female to male friends (one of whom was given a botched breast reduction by the same medical profession), the two wives of these men (one a genetic female who had been married 7 times before to extremely abusive genetic males), Robert's love Lola Cola (a male to female woman of beautiful warmth and support, and Robert's own biological son (who still calls Robert 'Mom') and grandson.  To see the way this quiet and lovely group of people stand tall in a world that despises them, who look forward to the annual Southern Comfort Weekend where transgendered people gather to nurture and celebrate each other, and who invite us into thier private lives is simply a beautiful experience for the viewer.  Where other less sensitive directors could have made this film a sensational expose, Kate Davis has elected to keep it tender and true.  Kudos to all concerned.

This award winning documentary follows Robert Eads and his girlfriend, Lola Cola, during the last year of Robert's life (ironically, he's dying of Ovarian cancer).  The story is told with Robert in the lead with his many friends and family around commenting on how life simply is.  It's told in such a matter of fact way, you wonder they don't all just give up.  In the extreme face of adversity, discrimination and hate, they have the courage to continue living.  In fact, they prefer the isolated redneck country, as even in the more liberal city, there is more prejudice.All the `female to male' guys are believable and only Lola Cola seems more like a drag queen, but this attitude soon diminishes as you see Lola for who he/she really is.  Lola is simply a loving, caring person; someone that you feel just doesn't deserve this kind of hardship.  In fact, none of these fine people deserve their fate.  However, this film is careful to keep in the middle and there is no smaltz and few judgmental remarks - except, oddly enough, between themselves.  These are people who have the courage to face their lives and live them to the fullest.It might be difficult to try and get into the heads of these people, but it is an exercise worth the effort.  What one ends up seeing are simply true human beings with emotions and love for each other.  This is something that seems to be lacking in so many other areas of society.  This documentary is an invaluable slice of life.

195942,A2R6RA8FRBS608,5552333756,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 3]","Southern Comfort is a brilliantly executed documentary focusing on a small yet equally important part of society--namely, those people who decide that they wish to change their gender. From watching this documentary I got the distinct impression that these people must be very brave because of the inherent stress involved, not to mention the prejudice they face up when they interact with other ""normal"" people. What the others say is true: these transgender people face their lot in life with tremendous grace and a sense of humor that always seems to get them through the rough times they face with family, friends who may not understand, and very possibly people at work, too. In addition, the film leaves little to be desired; we truly get to see how these people are human beings just like everyone else and the cruelty of the medical establishment is highlighted which is outrageous and sad at once. The cinematography is excellent and there is plenty of time to get to know these people fairly well although the spotlight remains on Robert Eads, a female to male transgender person who, in the last year of his life, strikes up an unexpected romance with a male to female transgender person. It really touched me the way they helped each other and their love for each other is very genuine.Robert has to deal with a terrible blow. He changed most of the way from a woman to a man; but he never actually had a hysterectomy. He says in the film that his doctors told him it wasn't necessary. Thus, when he developed cancer of the cervix, not only was it caught very late, every last doctor refused to treat Robert, saying it would be ""an embarrassment"" to their patients to have Robert sitting in their waiting room. The fact that the medical establishment left Robert Eads alone to die is horrific to me and it raises very serious ethical issues.Now there are many things I could say about Robert's friends who are profiled in this movie but to make a long story short they all, to one extent or another, don't exactly fit into the mold of ""normalcy"" in society and we see the price they pay for it. There's Max, Cas, Corissa, Stephanie and more. The group includes a genetic female who, after seven marriages to brutal men who beat her and more, actually found her true love with a female to male transgender person. Sure, they don't society's definition of what's ""normal;"" but wow are they happy and fulfilled together as they do what they want to do with their lives and that impressed me. They find happiness with self-acceptance and the strong social bonds they form help them to cope immeasurably.The DVD comes with deleted scenes and the list of awards this film won, including that wonderful award from Sundance, is quite long.You may think that this type of movie is not for you and therefore pass it by. I would encourage you, however, to give this a try and watch it. You'll be amazed and quite possibly even touched by their love for one another; and it leaves you with the understanding that all humans deserve to be considered equal and treated equally with fairness and kindness.",5,gripping and deeply moving at once,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,3102,"['Southern', 'Comfort', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'documentary', 'focusing', 'small', 'yet', 'equally', 'important', 'part', 'society', 'namely', 'people', 'who', 'decide', 'wish', 'change', 'gender', 'watching', 'documentary', 'got', 'distinct', 'impression', 'people', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'brave', 'inherent', 'stress', 'involved', 'not', 'mention', 'prejudice', 'face', 'up', 'when', 'interact', 'other', 'normal', 'people', 'What', 'others', 'say', 'true', 'transgender', 'people', 'face', 'lot', 'life', 'tremendous', 'grace', 'sense', 'humor', 'always', 'get', 'rough', 'times', 'face', 'family', 'friends', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'very', 'possibly', 'people', 'work', 'too', 'addition', 'film', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'truly', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'cruelty', 'medical', 'establishment', 'highlighted', 'outrageous', 'sad', 'once', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'plenty', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'people', 'fairly', 'well', 'spotlight', 'Robert', 'Eads', 'female', 'male', 'transgender', 'person', 'who', 'last', 'year', 'life', 'up', 'unexpected', 'romance', 'male', 'female', 'transgender', 'person', 'really', 'touched', 'way', 'helped', 'other', 'love', 'other', 'very', 'genuine.Robert', 'deal', 'terrible', 'blow', 'changed', 'most', 'way', 'woman', 'man', 'never', 'actually', 'had', 'hysterectomy', 'film', 'doctors', 'told', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'Thus', 'when', 'developed', 'cancer', 'cervix', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'caught', 'very', 'late', 'last', 'doctor', 'refused', 'treat', 'Robert', 'saying', 'would', 'be', 'embarrassment', 'patients', 'have', 'Robert', 'sitting', 'waiting', 'room', 'fact', 'medical', 'establishment', 'left', 'Robert', 'Eads', 'alone', 'die', 'horrific', 'very', 'serious', 'ethical', 'issues.Now', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'say', 'Robert', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'profiled', 'movie', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'one', 'extent', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'mold', 'normalcy', 'society', 'see', 'price', 'pay', 'Max', 'Cas', 'Corissa', 'Stephanie', 'more', 'group', 'genetic', 'female', 'who', 'seven', 'marriages', 'brutal', 'men', 'who', 'beat', 'more', 'actually', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'female', 'male', 'transgender', 'person', 'Sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'society', 'definition', 'what', 'normal', 'wow', 'are', 'happy', 'fulfilled', 'together', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'lives', 'impressed', 'find', 'happiness', 'self-acceptance', 'strong', 'social', 'bonds', 'form', 'help', 'cope', 'immeasurably.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'list', 'awards', 'film', 'won', 'including', 'wonderful', 'award', 'Sundance', 'quite', 'long.You', 'may', 'think', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'therefore', 'pass', 'would', 'encourage', 'however', 'give', 'try', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'quite', 'possibly', 'even', 'touched', 'love', 'one', 'understanding', 'humans', 'deserve', 'be', 'considered', 'equal', 'treated', 'equally', 'fairness', 'kindness']",N/A

Ultimately, the support and understanding exhibited by most of the people in this film triumph.

You walk a mile in his shoes. You develop empathy. That is absolutely what happens in this amazing film. This is not a ""Hollywood"" version ""based on a true story"". You watch the story unfold in real life, with real people - amazingly ordinary people who offer a glimpse of their extraordinary souls. You get to know their everyday lives, their joys, and ultimately the sorrow that they are moving toward in this period of their lives. My one complaint is that the editing is a little lax on the central character. Perhaps the film maker could not bear to take more away from a man who was losing so much already.
