847226,AAAQ1ZLUMTE2Y,B0002VGSBM,creators ID,"[0, 0]",the final season of the first TV series that I ever spent my money on collecting also one of the most expensive serious at the time due to how new DVDs where at the time the series cancellation newer sets became cheaper and I think the full set now is much much cheaper I'm not sure if the newer set has the same quality of encoding though or sound I thought I saw it on blue Ray for a few months but it seems to have disappeared are never come to pass.Series was one of the first of its kind if not a one-of-a-kind series my sister relates it to a role-playing game character group on quests and fighting off or dealing with the things that come in between completing the quests.To me the show was the perfect progression from those years of Hercules and Xena and Stargate SG-1 and the ending of the Star Trek TV years but it has gone a direction that I have never seen in any sci-fi sense the characters didn't grow season by season or stay stagnant they grew even in the episode they changed and an episode they acted how you'd expect everyday people to act when faced with the trials adventures and torturers that happen in the show with the boundaries of keeping it a family show I guess the makeup scenery were beyond anything I've ever seen in its originality and comforting Farscape is a place I always want to go back to and unlike BattleStar Galactica the reimagining series it's something that's easily gotten back into if an episode is on here are their when flipping through channels. The ships may not be as cool as Star Trek or Star Wars but once you've seen the whole show they start to make sense and once you see the insides in the later years you will forgive them for not looking like any of the current styles of spaceship used in television or movies. Maybe also a key point to the series was even when somebody was in charge nobody was really in charge the characters just did what they would do any ways which is probably how is most people experience there every day lives with other people around them,5,the final season of the first TV series that I ever spent my money on collecting,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,2027,"['final', 'season', 'first', 'TV', 'series', 'ever', 'spent', 'money', 'collecting', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'expensive', 'serious', 'time', 'due', 'how', 'new', 'DVDs', 'where', 'time', 'series', 'cancellation', 'sets', 'became', 'cheaper', 'think', 'full', 'set', 'now', 'much', 'much', 'cheaper', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'newer', 'set', 'same', 'quality', 'encoding', 'sound', 'thought', 'saw', 'blue', 'Ray', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'disappeared', 'are', 'never', 'come', 'pass.Series', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'kind', 'not', 'one-of-a-kind', 'series', 'sister', 'role-playing', 'game', 'character', 'group', 'quests', 'fighting', 'off', 'dealing', 'things', 'come', 'completing', 'quests.To', 'show', 'was', 'perfect', 'progression', 'years', 'Hercules', 'Xena', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'ending', 'Star', 'Trek', 'TV', 'years', 'gone', 'direction', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'sci-fi', 'sense', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'season', 'season', 'stay', 'stagnant', 'grew', 'even', 'episode', 'changed', 'episode', 'acted', 'how', ""'d"", 'expect', 'everyday', 'people', 'act', 'when', 'faced', 'trials', 'adventures', 'torturers', 'happen', 'show', 'boundaries', 'keeping', 'family', 'show', 'guess', 'makeup', 'scenery', 'were', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'originality', 'comforting', 'Farscape', 'place', 'always', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'BattleStar', 'Galactica', 'reimagining', 'series', 'something', 'easily', 'gotten', 'back', 'episode', 'here', 'are', 'when', 'flipping', 'channels', 'ships', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'cool', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Star', 'Wars', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'whole', 'show', 'start', 'make', 'sense', 'once', 'see', 'insides', 'later', 'years', 'will', 'forgive', 'not', 'looking', 'current', 'styles', 'spaceship', 'used', 'television', 'movies', 'Maybe', 'also', 'key', 'point', 'series', 'was', 'even', 'when', 'somebody', 'was', 'charge', 'nobody', 'was', 'really', 'charge', 'characters', 'just', 'did', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'ways', 'probably', 'how', 'most', 'people', 'experience', 'there', 'day', 'other', 'people']",Farscape - The Complete Fourth Season

847271,A3RN5W5IWPMKHD,B0002VGSBM,Nathaniel Wayne,"[0, 0]","There are few shows out there as inventive and wild as &#34;Farscape&#34; and it continues to carve out its unique niche with this fourth season. Ben Browder continues his commanding performance as the human John Crichton, lost in the depths of space among aliens. His growth over the course of the show has been stellar, and that development doesn't slow down here. Aeryn, played by Claudia Black, also has some really meaty stuff to work with and is given some interesting directions. The rest of the returning characters are pretty much as they've always been (with some minor tweaking or highlights here or there,) but John and Aeryn have always been the heart of the show and where the most change/growth is.The new character of Sikozu is an interesting addition to the crew, and she brings back that sense of &#34;can she really be counted on?&#34; that many of the characters had early on but lost over time as they all bonded. Grayza being promoted to the big villain on the Peacekeeper side is functional, but she's unremarkable as a villain. Thankfully Scorpius is still around to keep things lively, and his shifting role in all of this always adds a nice edge to things.On an episode by episode basis the quality varies quite a bit. When the episodes factor in some way into the larger story of the season then they tend to work quite well. The more stand alone episodes feel like the filler that they are. The problem with these episodes is that they've become very formulaic, with the crew making a deal with the wrong person (or something along those lines) and then having to work their way out of the issues that ensue. By contrast the episodes that feed into the larger overall story are much less predictable and yield some truly stellar moments.",4,Look Upward and Share the Wonders I See,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",2014,1765,"['are', 'few', 'shows', 'out', 'there', 'inventive', 'wild', '34', 'Farscape', '34', 'carve', 'out', 'unique', 'niche', 'fourth', 'season', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'commanding', 'performance', 'human', 'John', 'Crichton', 'lost', 'depths', 'space', 'aliens', 'growth', 'course', 'show', 'been', 'stellar', 'development', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'here', 'Aeryn', 'played', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'also', 'really', 'meaty', 'stuff', 'work', 'given', 'interesting', 'directions', 'rest', 'returning', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'minor', 'tweaking', 'highlights', 'here', 'there', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'heart', 'show', 'where', 'most', 'change/growth', 'is.The', 'new', 'character', 'Sikozu', 'interesting', 'addition', 'crew', 'back', 'sense', '34', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'counted', '34', 'many', 'characters', 'had', 'early', 'lost', 'over', 'time', 'bonded', 'Grayza', 'being', 'promoted', 'big', 'villain', 'Peacekeeper', 'side', 'functional', 'unremarkable', 'villain', 'Thankfully', 'Scorpius', 'still', 'keep', 'things', 'lively', 'shifting', 'role', 'always', 'nice', 'edge', 'things.On', 'episode', 'episode', 'basis', 'quality', 'quite', 'bit', 'When', 'episodes', 'factor', 'way', 'larger', 'story', 'season', 'then', 'tend', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'more', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'feel', 'filler', 'are', 'problem', 'episodes', ""'ve"", 'become', 'very', 'formulaic', 'crew', 'making', 'deal', 'wrong', 'person', 'something', 'lines', 'then', 'having', 'work', 'way', 'issues', 'ensue', 'contrast', 'episodes', 'feed', 'larger', 'overall', 'story', 'are', 'much', 'less', 'predictable', 'yield', 'truly', 'stellar', 'moments']",Farscape - The Complete Fourth Season

War begins to brew as the reptillian-esque Scarrans now seek the wormhole technology Crichton knows to rule the universe, no matter the cost.

847273,A33T53Y0PA7ZXA,B0002VGSBM,Niki M.,"[9, 11]","While Season 4 definitely had it's exciting, fun Farscape moments, and still added to this fantastic series as a whole, as compared to the other seasons, it only rated 3-stars for me.I know I will be branded the scourge of the Earth for the this review.  But I've watched every Farscape episode and I've got to tell you that Season 4 was a huge disappointment for me.  In that, the majority of the focus was on John and Aeryn to the near exclusion of the remaining characters.  Everyone but John and Aeryn simply stopped evolving to an appreciable degree.Instead of the storylines being tributaries meandering through the lives of all the characters, there was only one steady flow raging through the lives of John and Aeryn.  Quite frankly, it got very old, very quickly for me.  Season 4 consisted of: Tune in next week to see John pining for Aeryn or Aeryn pining for John.  Tune in next week to see John looking for wormholes or Earth.  After 21 episodes, I was over hearing about the lovesick John/Aeryn, and even sicker of those frelling wormholes.We never got to know more about D'Argo or visit the Luxan home world.  We never got know more about Rygel or visit the Hynerian home world.  And that goes for all of the other characters too.  The series ended with the Peacekeeper Wars, yet we barely got to see the animus that brewed between the factions.  Apparently there was a whole universe of interesting storylines out there but we rarely got to see any of them.  Why?Because for some reason, the PTB thought we needed to see show after show of ""John loves Aeryn (and vice versa)"" and ""John/Scorpious love wormholes"".  Reminiscent of wasting three entire episodes (during the first season) on the absurd ""Princess loves John, demands to marry him, and suddenly the battle-hardened Farscape crew who have escaped from everywhere else are not even bothering with an exit strategy.""  Yes, I can see how these stories would be more interesting than powerful, warring factions plotting to destroy each other, along with any other species who get in their way.Sorry folks, I cannot drink the Farscape kool-aid for Season 4. It was a huge let down for me considering it was the last season of the series. It was stagnate and missed an opportunity for the fans really enjoy ALL of the characters, including Pilot, in more than just supportive by-product roles.I put on hiatus viewing my other sci-fi shows so I could devote my time to viewing all of the Farscape episodes.  It was a refreshing relief to get back to watching Stargate Atlantis, in which the action storylines drive the show instead of the passions of one or two specific characters.  Although, Rodney is quickly becoming the Crichton ""all about me"" focus of Atlantis...which is slightly bothersome.

BUT, in season 4 you get the brilliance of an amazing, complex show, truly hitting it's stride. They nailed this, it's one of my favorite single seasons of all time.The acting and directing is phenomenal.  You can sense that cast and crew have learned how to trust each other, and that they are not afraid to take risks.  Both acting and directing is confident, intense, and also not afraid to be playful.  They made me cry, they made me laugh, they made my jaw drop open. Multiple times.The special effects and costumes and set design remain some of the most impressive ever on TV, and superior to many movies. That they were able to make this much magic 22 hours a year (7 years ago) blows my mind.  And season 4, of course is the best ever for visuals and effects.  They all have the basic visual language down cold by now, so they are able to polish and enrich existing props (notice how much more detailed the Droids are this season, or Rigel's puppet) The show has a much richer, more organic look this season. And while computer graphics have come a long way since 2003, Farscape still has some of the most visually arresting CGI ever made for the small screen.Just don't expect a clean ending.  It ends on a cliff-hanger, the whole team was expecting at least one more season.  You want to watch Peacekeeper Wars after.This season has some very disturbing images (Scorpius boot-licking, John's sexual enslavement, Aeryn's double with 1/2 her head blown off in loving close-up, various torture scenes)I definitely would not recommend it for pre or early teen viewing, and if I had a mature teen I'd want to at least talk about it before and after.And it's got a few scenes that I thought didn't work. (including big chunks of ""John Quixote"")The DVD is a bit disappointing.  While it has a number of special features, including deleted scenes and actor interviews, it is completely lacking any commentary tracks.  This show cries out for multiple commentaries from writers, producers, directors and crew, special effects, etc.  I was very let down that they did not do a commentary for at least a few episodes.Despite that.  This is one of the most visually captivating, emotionally moving, and intellectually stimulating single seasons ever to be broadcast.

847279,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0002VGSBM,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[6, 6]","The third season of Farscapeended with the tried and true method of separating the main characters at a time of crisis so that the opening of the next season could involve their slow and painful attempts to reunite - with the added revelation that one of them is pregnant. A battle had been won but the cost was great for the crew of Moya: though successful in destroying a Peacekeeper research facility that was coming dangerously close to unlocking the secrets to wormhole technology, they lost two of their allies and were divided amongst themselves as they fled from a galaxy that placed even larger bounties on their heads.To backtrack a little, it's worth giving a short summary of the show in general. A quirky and off-beat sci-fi series, ""Farscape"" centers on the adventures of American astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browser), flung through a wormhole to the far side of the galaxy and thrown in with a group of escaped prisoners on board their sentient ship. Since then he's been hunted by the militaristic Peacekeepers and the war-like Scarrans, both of whom are after the wormhole technology that's been implanted in his head. All John wants to do is work things out with his beloved Aeryn (an ex-Peacekeeper) and make it back to his family waiting on Earth.Of course, there's no point in starting your ""Farscape"" adventure this late in the game. In fact, it's very difficult to jump on board after the mid-way point ofseason two, and naturally it's best to begin right back at the start ofseason one. If you make the investment of time and money, then you're in for a well plotted, well characterized and immensely creative and colorful show, which takes the best of the sci-fi genre and twists it on its head. Our heroes are not Starfleet soldiers, but a motley bunch of escaped prisoners, and their aims are not lofty ideals of truth or justice, but the desire to live out their lives in relative peace.That goal is becoming increasingly distant with the growing conflict in the galaxy, and the fact that its resolution lies locked in John's brain. Having been entrusted with the key to wormhole technology by the Ancients, John knows that he alone has the power to prevent war and ensure peace - if only he can figure out *how*.The start of the season finds him scrounging out an existence on board a dying leviathan, joined quickly by a gold-skinned, red-haired, increasingly impatient alien named Sikuzo (Raelee Hill). Arrogant and brash, but with a keen mind and the ability to move her gravitational centre (giving her the ability to walk up walls and ceilings), she becomes a new regular cast member.One by one, the crew of Moya reunites: warrior D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), thieving Chiana (Gigi Edgley) and ex-emperor Rygel (voiced by Jonathan Hardy). Last of all is Aeryn (Claudia Black), waiting aboard Moya with a surprise guest in tow: Scorpias. The half-Scarran, half-Peacekeeper (Wayne Pygram) is now on the run from the law along with the rest of them, and after spending the last three seasons trying to escape, avoid or outwit his insatiable desire for wormhole technology, Crichton now finds him necessary for his foster-family's survival. The real game-changer comes when Crichton finally makes his way back to Earth and the long-awaited reunion with his father, sister and the friends he left behind. But his presence there only poses a danger to his race, and after a time-traveling escapade back to the 1980s, an awkward reintegration with the world he left behind, an episode-long television expose on Earth's first contact with aliens, and the realization that he's been tracked by his enemies, Crichton makes the decision to return to space and work toward securing the safety of his home planet.From there the episodes are continuously linked all the way up to the grand finale as Moya's crew enters the peace negotiations (better described as intrigues) between the Scarran Emperor and the Peacekeeper Commandant Grayzer. The fact that the three part episode finale is called ""We're So Screwed"" should tell you how well that goes, but the writing team excels with another tightly-written, nail-biting conclusion that ends on an equally jaw-dropping cliffhanger.Season four is not my favorite ""Farscape"" season (that title still belongs tothe third season), but by this stage the writers know their characters inside and out, as well as where exactly the plotlines are going. It was therefore an outrage when the show was abruptly cancelled despite the network's promise that there would be a fifth season for the writers to wrap up their planned storylines - but never fear, there was a reprieve in the show's imminent close in the form of a four-part miniseries that brought ""Farscape"" to a swift, though satisfactory finish.With this in mind, the forth season of ""Farscape"" definitely feels as though it's building toward something. There are far fewer filler episodes this time around (although there is invariably always room for the two that turn up every season: the one where Moya is attacked by some sort of parasite or virus, and the one where the crew wanders onto an alien planet and causes trouble amongst its culture). There is also some incredibly dark content this time around, including torture, slaughter, mind control, humiliation fantasies, and even the rape of two main characters - not graphically, but certainly explicitly. Don't be fooled by the bright colors of the packaging; this show isn't for the kids.Among the supporting cast there is a late return from Stark (Paul Goddard) in the series finale, and we are also joined by a mysterious and rather batty three-eyed seer known as Noranti (Melissa Jaffer), who seems to know more about the circumstances than she's letting on. In her place the character of Jool (Tammy MacIntosh) is dropped, which is something of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, Jool was never a popular character with audiences, on the other, she had been steadily improving over the course of the third season and by her last regular episode she had formed very sweet bonds with the core cast. It was a shame that the writers didn't trust their own development of Jool, as by the time she's shed her obnoxious exterior to become a useful team-member, they get rid of her.Another nitpick is that the show is constantly let down by the weak acting of its extras. It's not so bad when they're hidden under layers of prosthetics, but some of the humanoid characters are painfully stiff and awkward sounding. And the only thing more grating than an Australian accent in uncharted space is an Australian accent disguised as an American accent in uncharted space (not that there's anything wrong with Aussie accents in general!) It wouldn't be so bad if it were not for the inconsistency of the accents used across the show, and as Joss Whedon said in a commentary forFirefly, a show relies on the good acting of its extras and bit-parts to create a sense of reality in their created world. When Crichton was reunited with his family and fellow humans at the season's midway point, it was the terribly stilted acting that pulled me right out of the emotional power of the scene.Season four essentially revolves around two main plotlines: the relationship between John and Aeryn, and John and Scorpias's never-ceasing search for mastery over wormhole technology (with a rather intriguing alliance between Scorpias and Sikozu on the side). One of the side-effects of this is that many of the other characters are shunted to the side, and there is precious little development given to Chiana, D'Argo or Rygel and no real exploration into their cultures and home planets. In lieu of the promised fifth season, the spotlight never returns to them - one suspects that the proposed fifth season would have extended the Scarran/Peacekeeper conflict into a galaxy-wide war that involved all the alien species so far introduced to the show, a development that is sadly never to be realized.Disregarding the Sci-Fi network's lack of foresight in canceling the show before its time, the forth season of ""Farscape"" pushes story and (most) character ahead into the future, once more raising the stakes and increasing the odds against our intrepid heroes. Make sure you haveThe Peacekeeper Warshandy for the conclusion of one of the most innovative and imaginative sci-fi shows ever to hit television.",5,"""You and Your Timing...""",1284768000,"09 18,

847290,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0002VGSBM,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[79, 83]","Now that word has arrived that we have the concluding mini-series (and thanks to all of my fellow 'scape fans for writing to Sci-Fi channel without which this would never have happened), I decided to take the plunge and buy season 4 to refresh my memory of what happened to Crichton and his merry band of pransters. Man what a great season. For those that need to know, this boxed is only different in one way from the individual two disc sets with season 4 episodes. It's cheaper. No other extra features besides a nice little box to put them inside. A pity I was hoping for something extra but, hey, with gas prices I'm happy I could save a few bucks. There are a number of strong episodes this season (and only one or two that I thought was absolutely lame)In ""Crichton Kicks"" we are introduced to a new recurring character Sikozu as she crashes into the ship Crichton has taken refuge on in order to escape pirates interested in harvesting Leviathans. He's just about gotten his mathematical formula ready to go when she destroys part of it and they have to team up to stay alive. ""What Was Lost"" is an outstanding two part episode where Crichton hooks up with his buddies and sees Scorpious humiliated by a peacekeeper named Grayza who has delusions of grandeur. Finally Crichton finds Aeryn on Moya with her new friend Scorpious. It seems Scorpi saved her life and, as such, Crichton has a new shipmate.The trilogy of""Unrealized Reality"", ""Kansas"" and ""Terra Firma"" finds Crichton and the rest of Moya's crew traveling to Earth but at the wrong time. Eventually, they find the right time but, unfortunately, their timing leaves something to be desired. The concluding three part episode ""We're so Screwed"" takes the series in an entirely new direction with Crichton mastering much of the wormhole information that's been locked in his head. It seems the Scarrans have taken Aeryn hostage in hopes of using her as bait to get him to give up the wormhole technology so the Scarrans can rule the known universe. Finally, we get the coda for season four (and the set up for the mini-series). ""Bad Timing"" ties directly into the preceding three episodes concluding the story arc with Crichton learning that the Scarrans may try to invade Earth. Crichton's only choice is to try and close the portal to Earth but will he ever be able to get back?Picture quality is outstanding on each disc with a sharp, crisp high definition transfer. The 5.1 soundmix takes full advantage of the format and the sound has tremendous presence. The extras are numerous with the second and third season bloopers, interviews with cast, deleted scenes, set, prop and costume galleries, early make-up tests (which is really quite fascinating). Each indvidual box comes with a booklet with character histories, season four overviews, episodes synopsis and interesting photos. Special featurettes include ""Cool Farscape Facts"",  ""On the Last Day"" where we get behind the scenes footage for the season four wrap session,""The Story So Far"" which gives a brief update on the series to season four, ""Villains"", the usual ""Alien Encounters"" bits and ""Farscape Trailers"".All in all another exceptional season. I do miss the commentary tracks. While they didn't have to be on every single episode, I would have enjoyed them on ""Bad Timing"" and the ""We're So Screwed"" trilogy. I suppose you can't have everything but I am quite happy that ""Farscape"" is returning even if only in a limited capacity.
