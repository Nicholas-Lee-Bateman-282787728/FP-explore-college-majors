I have lived in china for a few years so recognise this as the real deal. Its a good a travel insight into China you can get for the usual westerner and had a nice romantic storyline with suberb acting by the chinese leading lady in particular. Only spoiled by a vollleyball fun fight and a scene of angry chinese villlagers running after the american. Easily enjoyable, touching and lots of wisdom too. A rare find in a day of films that skim the surface.",4,Good,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,582,"['good', 'real', 'china', 'detail', 'Real', 'chinese', 'english', 'accents', 'real', 'chinese', 'characters', 'real', 'culture', 'have', 'lived', 'china', 'few', 'years', 'so', 'recognise', 'real', 'deal', 'good', 'travel', 'insight', 'China', 'can', 'get', 'usual', 'westerner', 'had', 'nice', 'romantic', 'storyline', 'suberb', 'acting', 'chinese', 'leading', 'lady', 'particular', 'Only', 'spoiled', 'vollleyball', 'fun', 'fight', 'scene', 'angry', 'chinese', 'villlagers', 'running', 'american', 'Easily', 'enjoyable', 'touching', 'lots', 'wisdom', 'too', 'rare', 'find', 'day', 'films', 'skim', 'surface']",N/A
1280772,A2WMDDDW6POOR5,B002O3Z4TI,Gemseeker,"[3, 4]","First, in the extras we learn that this movie was filmed using mostly the real inhabitants of a small Chinese village, so their (mostly ordinary) reactions to things that happen really show that despite what politicians would have us believe, these are real people, the kind you meet in everyday life.  The have jobs, cook, take care of kids, watch TV (together, since apparently there's only one TV in the whole village--reminds me of when watching TV in America in the 1950's was supposed to ""bring the family together"")...I watched this movie not so much for the story, but for a welcome, close look at the culture that is the real China.  For example, two Asian values were subtly displayed in one short sentence, spoken by the high-school educated female lead of the movie:  ""Boys are so lucky.""  (This line is delivered with a kind of ""oh, well"" feeling.  There's not a hint of the kind of rebellion that an American raised after women's lib would feel obliged to raise.)  This statement shows not only the obvious idea of male-dominated cultures, but also the more subtle concept that one must accept one's fate with grace.I didn't have too much trouble understanding everyone, despite the thick accents, but I recommend you turn on the subtitles anyway.The actual story, about an aimless young American man whose family makes him travel to China on a business trip and while he's there, falls in love with a young woman who dreams of going to University, is okay, but not great.  You can see the producers wanted to try to make this movie appeal to young people who only want to see a romance/sexy movie, not a culture study, so they throw in some silly scenes that seem out of place, like they belong in a soap opera or something.  (The beach-volleyball-fight comes to mind.)I did appreciate the scenes with the main character's black best friend refusing to act like a stereotype (to a random guy he says something like ""I'm not doing that homeboy secret-handshake crap"") and trying to encourage his buddy to grow up, even when he was like ""Lay off me, will you?"" (He replies, ""What, so I'm not supposed to throw you a rope when you're drowning?"")One of the best lines in the movie was where the girl accuses the American, ""We have so little, and you have so much.  With so many options available to you, why can't you choose a direction for your life?""  ...She's right.  This statement really reverberates with me (I'm trying to decide a college major) and anyone else at a crossroads in their life.",4,"Watch it for a look at modern-day village China, not for the story",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2510,"['First', 'extras', 'learn', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'using', 'mostly', 'real', 'inhabitants', 'small', 'Chinese', 'village', 'mostly', 'ordinary', 'reactions', 'things', 'happen', 'really', 'show', 'what', 'politicians', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'kind', 'meet', 'everyday', 'life', 'have', 'jobs', 'cook', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'watch', 'TV', 'together', 'apparently', 'only', 'one', 'TV', 'whole', 'village', 'when', 'watching', 'TV', 'America', '1950', 'was', 'supposed', 'bring', 'family', 'together', 'watched', 'movie', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'welcome', 'close', 'look', 'culture', 'real', 'China', 'example', 'two', 'Asian', 'values', 'were', 'subtly', 'displayed', 'one', 'short', 'sentence', 'spoken', 'high-school', 'educated', 'female', 'lead', 'movie', 'Boys', 'are', 'so', 'lucky', 'line', 'delivered', 'kind', 'oh', 'well', 'feeling', 'not', 'hint', 'kind', 'rebellion', 'American', 'raised', 'women', 'lib', 'would', 'feel', 'obliged', 'raise', 'statement', 'not', 'only', 'obvious', 'idea', 'male-dominated', 'cultures', 'also', 'more', 'subtle', 'concept', 'one', 'must', 'accept', 'one', 'fate', 'grace.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'everyone', 'thick', 'accents', 'recommend', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'anyway.The', 'actual', 'story', 'aimless', 'young', 'American', 'man', 'family', 'travel', 'China', 'business', 'trip', 'there', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'going', 'University', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'can', 'see', 'producers', 'wanted', 'try', 'make', 'movie', 'appeal', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'want', 'see', 'romance/sexy', 'movie', 'not', 'culture', 'study', 'throw', 'silly', 'scenes', 'seem', 'place', 'belong', 'soap', 'opera', 'something', 'beach-volleyball-fight', 'mind', 'did', 'appreciate', 'scenes', 'main', 'character', 'black', 'best', 'friend', 'refusing', 'act', 'stereotype', 'random', 'guy', 'something', ""'m"", 'not', 'doing', 'homeboy', 'secret-handshake', 'crap', 'trying', 'encourage', 'buddy', 'grow', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'Lay', 'will', 'What', ""'m"", 'not', 'supposed', 'throw', 'rope', 'when', ""'re"", 'drowning', 'One', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'was', 'where', 'girl', 'American', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'options', 'available', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'choose', 'direction', 'life', 'right', 'statement', 'really', ""'m"", 'trying', 'decide', 'college', 'major', 'anyone', 'else', 'crossroads', 'life']",N/A

It's pretty much stupid MTV real-world like depictions.I recommend you do the same. Just skip forward to the part where he travels to asia.The most commendable thing about the movie is its realism.

So the time seems ripe for a fish out of water story where an American learns about China and about himself.An American in China tries to be that film but falls down with a cliche-ridden script that fails to entertain or inform.  David is a slacker looking for direction who goes to China, apparently to out-source the family's plumbing supply business, where he finds confusion, culture shock and true love.Most of the jokes were old when they were building the Great Wall.  David walks into a tree, David trips on the bed sheets, David eats gross food and David is chased by angry villagers.  The romance with Mei (the only other English speaker around) is as obvious and forced as you might expect.  The China shown is a bit fake, they pass off a major tourist attraction near Suzhou as a typical Chinese town.  It's rather like saying Venice is a typical Italian city.  And for some odd reason Mei's family is not bound by the one-child policy.  Actually there's no mention at all of politics, not too surprising since shooting in China requires government permission and script approval.  So somehow David never runs into censored news or has his internet access blocked.All that being said there are some good features, the emphasis on exams and university rings true, the hospitality of China is showcased and a scene at a karaoke parlor shows some of the dark side of women's lives in modern China.But in the end this is not a particularly entertaining or insightful film, which is a shame because there are very few films about China that are.",2,Good idea spoiled by hacknied script full of cliches,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,1647,"['China', 'today', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'places', 'world', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'time', 'ripe', 'fish', 'water', 'story', 'where', 'American', 'learns', 'China', 'himself.An', 'American', 'China', 'tries', 'be', 'film', 'down', 'cliche-ridden', 'script', 'entertain', 'inform', 'David', 'slacker', 'looking', 'direction', 'who', 'China', 'apparently', 'out-source', 'family', 'plumbing', 'supply', 'business', 'where', 'confusion', 'culture', 'shock', 'true', 'love.Most', 'jokes', 'were', 'old', 'when', 'were', 'building', 'Great', 'Wall', 'David', 'tree', 'David', 'bed', 'sheets', 'David', 'gross', 'food', 'David', 'chased', 'angry', 'villagers', 'romance', 'Mei', 'only', 'other', 'English', 'speaker', 'obvious', 'forced', 'might', 'expect', 'China', 'shown', 'bit', 'fake', 'pass', 'major', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'near', 'Suzhou', 'typical', 'Chinese', 'town', 'rather', 'like', 'saying', 'Venice', 'typical', 'Italian', 'city', 'odd', 'reason', 'Mei', 'family', 'not', 'bound', 'one-child', 'policy', 'Actually', 'mention', 'politics', 'not', 'too', 'surprising', 'shooting', 'China', 'government', 'permission', 'script', 'approval', 'somehow', 'David', 'never', 'censored', 'news', 'internet', 'access', 'blocked.All', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'good', 'features', 'emphasis', 'exams', 'university', 'rings', 'true', 'hospitality', 'China', 'showcased', 'scene', 'karaoke', 'parlor', 'dark', 'side', 'women', 'lives', 'modern', 'China.But', 'end', 'not', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'insightful', 'film', 'shame', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'China', 'are']",N/A
