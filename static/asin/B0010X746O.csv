While there are differences, I enjoyed Kan Stott in the title role, more so than the other actor in earlier adaptations.  I thought I would try this show because of Mr. Stott.  I like it, but it is a rougher type of situation as you would expect being about a Vice rather than a murder squad.  Still, I found it better than watching  Law and Order SVU.If you like British police show, try the REBUS series and GEORGE GENTLY and JACK TAYLOR and VERA as well as the old standard PRIME SUSPECT.If you have been watching DOWNTON ABBEY, it will be fun to spot some of the actors in earlier roles!There are a whole lot of other interesting British mystery/cop show aside from the MORSE, INSPECTOR LINDLEY, INSPECTOR LEWIS and the new SHERLOCK which you can find if you have seen these on PBS and liked them.Some are more humorous than others - don't miss A TASTE OF FROST, PIE IN THE SKY and THE LAST DETECTIVE. Usually when you get one of the DVDs there is a trailer showing clips from other shows which is how I got hooked on these.  There are others as well.  Of course, don't forget the MIDSOMMER MURDER series which is  now into set 23 as well.Once you find you like this type of  show, it is like eating potato chips - you can't stop with just one.  It is fun finding new (and old) shows, watching various actors in different roles over the years ( Inspector Foyle of FOYLE'S WAR as a jewel thief or a conman, Downton's Duke as a serial killer, Mr. Bates as a police chief superintendant, a drug smuggling nightclub owner or again a serial killer).

The acting is excellent, the script strong, the stories and their pacing highly professional. The main character, Pat Chappell (Ken Stott) is worldly, realistic, but sympathetic, often feeling akin to those working within an industry (i.e. sex) with many grey areas and based on aliases, fantasies, deceptions and (not-always) casual encounters: It's the exploiters he detests.The proceedings, though dealing with sex, are quite unerotic, and one is left depressed, perhaps how the vice squad as portrayed here may feel at the end of the day.Note: it is interesting, given era the series was made, to compare nineties' high tech with today's. And if any commerce has benefitted from technological advance, it's the oldest one.",4,Sour Times Indeed,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,854,"[""'ve"", 'just', 're-watched', 'series', 'season', ""'d"", 'seen', '1999', 'most', 'good', 'drama', 'even', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'acting', 'excellent', 'script', 'strong', 'stories', 'pacing', 'highly', 'professional', 'main', 'character', 'Pat', 'Chappell', 'Ken', 'Stott', 'worldly', 'realistic', 'sympathetic', 'often', 'feeling', 'akin', 'working', 'industry', 'i.e', 'sex', 'many', 'grey', 'areas', 'based', 'aliases', 'fantasies', 'deceptions', 'not-always', 'casual', 'encounters', 'exploiters', 'proceedings', 'dealing', 'sex', 'are', 'quite', 'unerotic', 'one', 'left', 'depressed', 'perhaps', 'how', 'vice', 'squad', 'portrayed', 'here', 'may', 'feel', 'end', 'day.Note', 'interesting', 'given', 'era', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'compare', 'nineties', 'high', 'tech', 'today', 'commerce', 'benefitted', 'technological', 'advance', 'oldest', 'one']",The Vice: Season 1

1127414,A28YDMI499J1X9,B0010X746O,J. Janssen,"[26, 27]","If you like Ken Stott in Rebus, you'll like this earlier effort.  The subject matter is pretty seamy, particularly for American TV audiences, which is probably why it never made it to PBS or A&E.;  It does have a little of ""The Wire"" feel to it, but it's clearly Ken Stott's vehicle as DI Pat Chapel.  Stott plays Chapel like a younger Rebus who still feels a certain degree of devotion to the job and not just to the crime at hand.  But, like Rebus, Chapel is a flawed character constantly flirting with on the job disasters, mostly of his own making.  His subordinates are affected by the nature of the work and his less than stellar management style, but in the end they catch the bad guys.The series has a few unusual twists and turns with one of the stars coming to an early end in Season  2 which, apparently, is all we're allowed to see of the generally excellent series.  The show ran for 5 years on British TV, but so far only the first two seasons have been released on DVD.  Since the show originally ran starting in 1998-99 I don't hold out a lot of hope for the balance of the episodes.  Again, the subject matter is rough with all the expected violence and nudity, but the acting and scripts are first rate.
