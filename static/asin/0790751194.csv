121324,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,0790751194,Baberufus,"[1, 6]","Let me say, right off the bat...Clint Eastwood is one of my top 3 favorite actors (Pacino and DeNiro are the other 2). You just can't beat the Dirty Harry movies! After a few successful Dirty Harry films, Clint decided to try comedy country music-tinged movies in the form of ""Every Which Way But Loose"" and ""Any Which Way You Can""--and struck gold. I also enjoy those two movies for what they are. But then I guess he figured he could do no wrong--lol--and thought, ""Well, I'd like to make a film about a country singer, and I CAN BE THE SINGER!"" OK, that's crossing the line...Clint's singing voice sounds too much like his speaking voice--too whispery. His singing just plain doesn't cut it, sorry. He looks the part--looks a lot like pictures of the legendary Hank Williams--but he's not much of a singer. I know he's a musician, and I think it might be that he actually plays his piano parts in the movie (not sure, but some of his ""piano acting"" looked pretty real), kind of doubt he did his own guitar playing. But anyway, I know he is quite the music buff, and the songs in the movie are pretty good...not great, but good.Some non-musical aspects of the movie are lacking, too. I thought the stowaway girl was a fairly expendable character--she was mildly funny, but I don't think her character added much to the plot. The movie was just weak, overall. Kind of funny in some parts, but overall corny and cheesy. The cop scenes were dumb, too.So I can just hear the suits at Warner Bros. chewing Clint out after making this movie...""OK, Clint, you're mojo is wearing off on these folksy comedies...it's time for another Dirty Harry, movie...OK??""--haha. And lo and behold, one year later...Sudden Impact! With the all-time greatest movie catchphrase...""Go ahead, make my day!"" Now THAT'S Clint Eastwood in top form! :-)So I consider Honky Tonk Man one of Clint's career low points. There are much better movies like this one from that time period...Urban Cowboy, The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia, and Honeysuckle Rose come to mind. I recommend those way over Honky Tonk Man.",2,Clint went too far...,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",2010,2089,"['Let', 'say', 'right', 'bat', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'one', 'top', '3', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Pacino', 'DeNiro', 'are', 'other', '2', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movies', 'few', 'successful', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'films', 'Clint', 'decided', 'try', 'comedy', 'country', 'music-tinged', 'movies', 'form', 'Every', 'Which', 'Way', 'Loose', 'Any', 'Which', 'Way', 'Can', 'struck', 'gold', 'also', 'enjoy', 'two', 'movies', 'what', 'are', 'then', 'guess', 'figured', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'thought', 'Well', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'film', 'country', 'singer', 'CAN', 'BE', 'THE', 'SINGER', 'OK', 'crossing', 'line', 'Clint', 'singing', 'voice', 'too', 'much', 'speaking', 'voice', 'too', 'whispery', 'singing', 'just', 'plain', ""n't"", 'cut', 'sorry', 'part', 'lot', 'pictures', 'legendary', 'Hank', 'Williams', 'not', 'much', 'singer', 'know', 'musician', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'actually', 'piano', 'parts', 'movie', 'not', 'sure', 'piano', 'acting', 'looked', 'pretty', 'real', 'kind', 'doubt', 'did', 'own', 'guitar', 'playing', 'anyway', 'know', 'quite', 'music', 'buff', 'songs', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'good.Some', 'non-musical', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'lacking', 'too', 'thought', 'stowaway', 'girl', 'was', 'fairly', 'expendable', 'character', 'was', 'mildly', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'character', 'added', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'weak', 'overall', 'Kind', 'funny', 'parts', 'overall', 'corny', 'cheesy', 'cop', 'scenes', 'were', 'dumb', 'too.So', 'can', 'just', 'hear', 'suits', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'chewing', 'Clint', 'out', 'making', 'movie', 'OK', 'Clint', ""'re"", 'wearing', 'off', 'folksy', 'comedies', 'time', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'movie', 'haha', 'lo', 'behold', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'Sudden', 'Impact', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'movie', 'catchphrase', 'Go', 'ahead', 'make', 'day', 'Now', 'THAT', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'top', 'form', 'consider', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Man', 'one', 'Clint', 'career', 'low', 'points', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'one', 'time', 'period', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Went', 'Out', 'Georgia', 'Honeysuckle', 'Rose', 'come', 'mind', 'recommend', 'way', 'Honky', 'Tonk', 'Man']",N/A

121326,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0790751194,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[8, 8]","In 1982 Clint Eastwood released Honkytonk Man. It was clearly a labor of love, of the music, and a chance for him to make a movie with his son, Kyle, who looks to be about 13 or 14 years old. The story resembles The Grapes of Wrath--Oklahoma farmers escape the dust and tornadoes and The Great Depression. But instead of California, Red Stovall (Clint Eastwood) wants to go to Nashville and audition at The Grand Ole Opry. The rest of the family goes to California, but his nephew, Whit (Kyle Eastwood) somehow persuades mom and dad to let him go with drunk uncle Red. He is fascinated by Uncle Red: his hat, his car, but most of all his guitar and music. His Uncle has two problems, though. He is a raging alcoholic, and he is dying of TB. Whit is the designated driver for the rest of the journey, and what a journey it is.I happened to glance at some other reviews that were heavily critical of the music, saying some of it wasn't authentic for the time period. I say that he might have stretched it a bit here and there, but the music was so good, that minor quibbles like that are quickly quashed. Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, or at least a very reasonable facsimile, as well as a blues singer in the vein of Bessie Smith, are a few of the many musical highlights. The story is great, too, as Uncle Red shows his nephew how to tune a guitar, steal chickens, and even takes him to a brothel. If you weren't so caught up in the story, you might realize that the parallel story was Clint showing his son Kyle how to act in a movie, and introducing him to the Honkytonk life. Kyle Eastwood has grown up to be a musician, and he plays bass for his own big jazz band. Perhaps his fascination with the guitar wasn't acting at all.The story, based on a novel by Clancy Carlile, who also wrote the screenplay, never gives in to easy sentimentality, but it tugs at the heartstrings, and is gritty where it needs to be. Clarence Lawson Carlile's father was half Cherokee, and he was born on a Choctaw Indian reservation. He worked in Texas picking cotton until his sharecropper family moved to California to pick fruit. He began writing while in the Army during the Korean War and later received a Master's degree from San Francisco State University (my alma mater, by the way). His first novel, ""As I Was Young and Easy"" (1958), was written in 17 days.Red's struggle with tuberculosis was a harsh reality in those days, and TB also took the life of Jimmie Rodgers, the Singing Brakeman. Like Rodgers, Red Stovall knows he is dying, but he just wants to record some songs, do something that matters, before he dies. Honkytonk Man matters, and I recommend it wholeheartedly, it is one of Clint Eastwood's neglected masterpieces.10 Films Starring and/or Directed by Clint Eastwood.Million Dollar Baby (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)(2004) ....

121330,AY12DBB0U420B,0790751194,Gary Peterson,"[2, 2]","I like Clint Eastwood movies and last night I watched ""Honkytonk Man."" It's a big change of pace for Eastwood, that's for certain. He plays a loser among losers in depression-era America and a wannabe country singer headed for Nashville and the big chance of a Grand Ol' Opry appearance. He's with his nephew (played ably by his son). Although billed as a comedy, it's really a rather dreary story and there aren't any winners. I think it might be best viewed as a period piece and the movie does a rather good job of depicting people and their environments in the Great American Depression. Most of the movie looks like it was filmed in Nevada rather than in the route from Oklahoma to Nashville, and the modern stripes on some of the roads are a dead giveaway that it's just a movie and that someone was not careful enough with the little details.In playing a country singer, Eastwood sings his own songs and my advice would be not to give up his day job. It's a rather good cast and I'm wondering how they could find such a dreary, beat-down group of people, but they fit the depression era setting perfectly. Kudos to the makeup people! Make no mistake, this is a good movie. It's not one of Eastwood's best movies, but is well worth watching especially for the depression era depiction.Gary Peterson",4,Excellent Depression-Era Depiction.,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1304,"['like', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'last', 'night', 'watched', 'Honkytonk', 'Man', 'big', 'change', 'pace', 'Eastwood', 'certain', 'loser', 'losers', 'depression-era', 'America', 'wannabe', 'country', 'singer', 'headed', 'Nashville', 'big', 'chance', 'Grand', 'Ol', 'Opry', 'appearance', 'nephew', 'played', 'ably', 'son', 'billed', 'comedy', 'really', 'rather', 'dreary', 'story', 'are', ""n't"", 'winners', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'viewed', 'period', 'piece', 'movie', 'rather', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'people', 'environments', 'Great', 'American', 'Depression', 'Most', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Nevada', 'rather', 'route', 'Oklahoma', 'Nashville', 'modern', 'stripes', 'roads', 'are', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'just', 'movie', 'someone', 'was', 'not', 'careful', 'enough', 'little', 'details.In', 'playing', 'country', 'singer', 'Eastwood', 'own', 'songs', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'day', 'job', 'rather', 'good', 'cast', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'how', 'could', 'find', 'such', 'dreary', 'beat-down', 'group', 'people', 'fit', 'depression', 'era', 'setting', 'perfectly', 'Kudos', 'makeup', 'people', 'Make', 'mistake', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'movies', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'depression', 'era', 'depiction.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Some examples are A Perfect World, Bronco Billy, and this film.  This is a really subtle film that starts out (deceptively) as light comedy, then takes a serious turn in the middle and has a sad ending.  It's similar to Million Dollar Baby in that way (even though MDB is better), and the plot is similar (flawed people who have made past mistakes looking for that shot at redemption).  Clint, as actor and director, really captures the atmosphere of the depression days, the desperation, the sadness, and the fear that everyone had to live with.

The first hour made me think it's one of those films by Eastwood that are not be taken too seriously. As Red's illness grows worse day by day, his character becomes more and more pityable. Clint Eastwood plays the dying man in this movie. It was nearly tearjerking to see him cry out for his love when his end is near. Towards the last half hour of the film, the film manages to reach it's peak in terms of moving script. I dont know how he does it but Clint Eastwood somehow manages to make ""not so serious films"" into gulp inducing trips. If I could start again, I would say this film is about a man who makes music. He ain't a big shot and he doesnt have many big dreams. Towards the end of his life(Thanks to TB which he suffers from) he realises he must record his music. His nephew is his only friend and he's always around. The core of this movie would interest a person who likes travelling,beer,acoustic guitar and casual flings. I can't possibly comprehend just how terribly serious this film got towards the end.I have seen 5 Clint Eastwood films before this. Escape from Alcatraz, Absolute Power and MDB are his best. This one will earn more respect if I ever give it a watch again. I would look back at Honkytonky Man as a film in which Clint Eastwood played the character of a semi cowboy who lived his life to what he stood for.

121335,A2EMP366TTS6E1,0790751194,Judith Miller,"[6, 6]","Honkytonk Man is an entertaining and well-done film directed by and staring Clint Eastwood. The story takes place during the Great Depression and is about Red Stovall (Clint), a country singer who has a chance to make it on the Grand Ole Opry. Red knows it's probably his last chance for fame. He's an alcoholic and also very sick with tuberculosis. On his way to Nashville, he stops by to visit his sister in Oklahoma. She persuades Red to take along his teenage nephew Whit (Kyle Eastwood) to drive for him. She suspects that Whit will also have to take care of his uncle before very long.I don't know if Kyle Eastwood appeared in any other films, but I was impressed by how well he did.  He was charming and very natural in the role of admiring nephew. In fact, the supporting cast couldn't have been better.There are some negative comments from other reviewers about Clint's singing.  I felt his style matched the character he was portraying in the film. He had a quiet singing voice that was between talking and singing. I found his voice to be pleasant. He's an actor and not a professional singer. I've heard many actors used that same vocal technique when required to sing.This was not a glamorous or glitzy type of film.

121337,A1IF1CS65GOVNK,0790751194,"MR77100 ""Sparks""","[2, 19]","In the early 1980's, Clint Eastwood tried a number of different characters. He had his ups and downs, and HONKEYTONK MAN is definately a down. Based on a novel, the movie takes place in the 1930's with Eastwood playing Red Stoval, an aging country singer trying to make it in the bars. He sest out on a trip to Memphis, hoping to make it big. His real-life son Kyle plays his nephew, who tags along to keep him out of trouble.I give him credit for trying, but Eastwood CANNOT sing. He actually did a better job trying in PAINT YOUR WAGON then here. The movie is rather slow, with the occasional sleazy comment or action to hold your interest, which doesn't last long. One funny moment is when Red tells off a cop who is frisking him. Another is when he holds up a friend with a shotgun, (yes, he does carry a gun in this one briefly). By far the funniest part is where he takes his nephew to a brothel to help him lose his virginity! Still, the movie is depressing with Red suffering from TB throughout the whole film, and to see him waste away while singing doesn't make things any better. The cars are also not in date with the film. Wanting to be somebody is a good motive for still going on with the show, but he takes it too far, and any Eastwood fan would be rattled by the ending. HONKEYTONK MAN was a commercial disappointment, and I would sadly rank it as one of Eastwood's worst films.",2,Eastwood tries to sing country,1080432000,"03 28, 2004",2004,1395,"['early', '1980', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'tried', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'had', 'ups', 'downs', 'HONKEYTONK', 'MAN', 'definately', 'down', 'Based', 'novel', 'movie', 'place', '1930', 'Eastwood', 'playing', 'Red', 'Stoval', 'aging', 'country', 'singer', 'trying', 'make', 'bars', 'sest', 'out', 'trip', 'Memphis', 'hoping', 'make', 'big', 'real-life', 'son', 'Kyle', 'nephew', 'who', 'along', 'keep', 'trouble.I', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'Eastwood', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'sing', 'actually', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'trying', 'PAINT', 'YOUR', 'WAGON', 'then', 'here', 'movie', 'rather', 'slow', 'occasional', 'sleazy', 'comment', 'action', 'hold', 'interest', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'One', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'Red', 'cop', 'who', 'frisking', 'when', 'up', 'friend', 'shotgun', 'yes', 'carry', 'gun', 'one', 'briefly', 'far', 'funniest', 'part', 'where', 'nephew', 'brothel', 'help', 'lose', 'virginity', 'Still', 'movie', 'depressing', 'Red', 'suffering', 'TB', 'whole', 'film', 'see', 'waste', 'away', 'singing', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'better', 'cars', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'date', 'film', 'Wanting', 'be', 'somebody', 'good', 'motive', 'still', 'going', 'show', 'too', 'far', 'Eastwood', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'rattled', 'ending', 'HONKEYTONK', 'MAN', 'was', 'commercial', 'disappointment', 'would', 'sadly', 'rank', 'one', 'Eastwood', 'worst', 'films']",N/A
