Cool As Ice was one of those movies that tried to capalitize on the phenomena that was Vanilla Ice and in my opinion did a fairly good job.  The acting was not bad and the music still holds up after all these years.  The film was so memorable that when I became aware it was finally on DVD I didn't even hesitate to purchase it to add to my library and I'm glad I did.

Featuring classic lines like &quot;drop the zero and get with the  hero&quot; and &quot;so, what's up with tomorrow?&quot; in a very exciting  dialog, this movie reminds me of another camp classic &quot;Better Off  Dead.&quot; I have seen &quot;Cool As Ice&quot; at least a dozen times.  Each time, I laugh more than I did before. Why do I laugh? It's simple. The  movie is so dumb, it's entertaining. Not to mention Stephen Keaton from  FAMILY TIES is in this flick.

You will watch the entire  thing wondering why you are watching it. But you will watch it. His rousing  version of &quot;Thank you for letting me be myself&quot; will make anyone  laugh out loud.

304551,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302261589,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 7/07, 11/11Rate: 77/07: The VHS cover has a tagline, and it says, ""When a girl has a heart of stone, there's one way to melt it."" So, how? ""Just add ice."" In that case, when the ice melts, what happens? The stone is still there. If you added ice to the stoned heart, would that make the melting harder? If heat is applied, would that kill the heart as well? Otherwise, I suppose that the stone is impossible to melt. Anyway, Cool As Ice starts off nicely with good dance moves and lyrics. Then the story rolls along akin to The Wild One. As a matter of fact, linking Cool As Ice to Rebel Without a Cause, as some people have stated, is incorrect. Having my expectations lowered than usual for this one, I personally found Cool As Ice very enjoyable. Some scenes in the picture are very over-the-top cheesy, not to forget to mention embarrassing, and beside those lame parts, much of Cool As Ice moves along very well with an intriguing plot. I have to say that Kristin Minter held her ground surprisingly well despite the corny scenes. Vanilla Ice aka Robert (Not Rip) Van Winkle gives an impressive debut performance, and I suspect that the director knew how bad the movie looked but decided to ignore all of that. Putting the lameness aside, I feel Cool As Ice had something serious to say with a message in the lines of ""No matter how ridiculous this person looks, he is a person."" Interestingly, the father fell into that trap and saw himself in error before admitting his poor judgment. Cool As Ice is not exactly a picture to be taken seriously, and, I confess, it's whole a lot better than 75% of the crap I've seen. As humorous as the lettered black jacket looks, Cool As Ice feels like an amusement park, having its ups and downs. The supporting cast is rather weak, but Vanilla Ice and Kristin Minter, and possibly Michael Gross (surprisingly he agreed to this role), carry the film on their shoulders adeptly well. I like the ending very much as it sort of pays a homage to Saturday Night Fever. Another homage paid from Cool As Ice is Easy Rider with the artistically scenery landscape while on a motorcycle ride with the music playing. When I can think of a worse film, I could have seen Cool As Ice as Citizen Kane. Okay...to think back what went on in Cool As Ice. Highlights are Vanilla Ice riding in his yellowy motorcycle and (ramp-less) jumping over the fence to disrupt Minter's horse-riding, the way how Vanilla Ice knocks on the door, the high school dance scene, ""drop that zero and get with the hero"" line, overlarge Stallone sunglasses, etc. One thing I can safely say is Cool As Ice managed to capture the genteel feel and look of the 30-40's romantic movies extraordinarily well. Am I joking? No. What I look for in a movie is entertainment, and Cool As Ice met my expectations. David Kellogg managed to direct a stylish picture. It's too bad Vanilla Ice never made another lead performance. Looking back at history, Vanilla Ice himself had an interesting persona that set off a craze in the early 90's and still, as of today, remains one of the most memorable figures of that decade. Moreover, he may have been responsible for the next Vanilla Ice, that is, Eminem. Anytime I see or think of the name Vanilla Ice, the only two things that come to my mind are his hair plus the slice-lined eyebrow and, of course, ""Ice Ice Baby."" It is quite amazing that he was successful for only one year, maybe less, and yet his popularity is enormous to this day. Meanwhile, his fall-out was pretty dramatic, and Vanilla Ice had been the center of deep ridicule. Nevertheless, Cool As Ice is a nice outlet for harmless fun. Actually, I am very impressed with the putting-down of Vanilla Ice's mannerisms when he attempts to display his feelings. This is a very rare thing because many movies do not attempt to play this one. I often am a good observant of people in behavior, and this type of behavior, displayed by Vanilla Ice, is a perfect example of how some introvert people act.11/11: Not too bad of a film really. I've seen worse.

304560,A2FNW654OSB917,6302261589,Jamie,"[9, 10]","During the 20th century, Vanilla Ice starred in ""Cool as Ice,"" based on a short story about a lower class rebel. Ice shows up on a neon-yellow motorcycle, which is an allegorical representation of society's image of the rebel. The setting of the story is in modern day America: a place where harsh attitudes and cynicism make a rebel an essential character in society.  Vanilla utilizes his attitude in the film to evoke emotions, especially feelings of sympathy and compassion, in hopes that the viewer will both identify and empathize with his character, Johnny.  Vanilla Ice personifies the rebel as a maternal figure.  Through a clear understanding of the feminine symbolism deeply embedded in the rebel, the viewer is able to comprehend a specific theme, addressed by Vanilla, concerning the relationship between change and love.  The theme is that spontaneous change demonstrates that even the strongest bonds of love are hardly ever guaranteed and that a disruption in that can have disastrous results, including death. A deeper analysis of the text of the film reveal that the character of Johnny not only is a hero, but a martyr. Johnny's ever-popular catch phrase, &quot;Drop that zero, and get with the hero&quot; symbolizes Vanilla's true life experience with rejection in society. Before the viewer can understand the correlation between change and love, he/she has to recognize that Vanilla Ice's portrayal of the rebel unequivocally symbolizes Ice himself.",5,Feminine Symbolism in Cool as Ice,980208000,"01 23, 2001",2001,1471,"['20th', 'century', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'starred', 'Cool', 'Ice', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'lower', 'class', 'rebel', 'Ice', 'up', 'neon-yellow', 'motorcycle', 'allegorical', 'representation', 'society', 'image', 'rebel', 'setting', 'story', 'modern', 'day', 'America', 'place', 'where', 'harsh', 'attitudes', 'cynicism', 'make', 'rebel', 'essential', 'character', 'society', 'Vanilla', 'attitude', 'film', 'evoke', 'emotions', 'especially', 'feelings', 'sympathy', 'compassion', 'hopes', 'viewer', 'will', 'both', 'identify', 'empathize', 'character', 'Johnny', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'rebel', 'maternal', 'figure', 'clear', 'understanding', 'feminine', 'symbolism', 'deeply', 'embedded', 'rebel', 'viewer', 'able', 'comprehend', 'specific', 'theme', 'addressed', 'Vanilla', 'concerning', 'relationship', 'change', 'love', 'theme', 'spontaneous', 'change', 'even', 'strongest', 'bonds', 'love', 'are', 'hardly', 'ever', 'guaranteed', 'disruption', 'can', 'have', 'disastrous', 'results', 'including', 'death', 'deeper', 'analysis', 'text', 'film', 'reveal', 'character', 'Johnny', 'not', 'only', 'hero', 'martyr', 'Johnny', 'ever-popular', 'catch', 'phrase', 'quot', 'Drop', 'zero', 'get', 'hero', 'quot', 'Vanilla', 'true', 'life', 'experience', 'rejection', 'society', 'viewer', 'can', 'understand', 'correlation', 'change', 'love', 'he/she', 'recognize', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'portrayal', 'rebel', 'unequivocally', 'symbolizes', 'Ice']",N/A

I don't believe that this country will ever  come across such a great figure as Vanilla, not for some time  anyways."" This was Quoted by Mr. Nelson Mandela reflecting upon 'cool  as ice's first week ticket grosses. He vanished shortly afterwards, almost  as quick as he changed the world. Perhaps it was inevitable that Ice would  eventually leave, but so quick? Well they say that the brightest flames  always vanish the quickest. I would like to think that Ice's music secretly  reveals what his goals were, there was a line in 'Ice, Ice, baby!' that  went"" rollin' in my V.O, drop top down so my hair can blow!"" The  optimist in me would like to think that that one line is a indication as to  where he is now. I can almost see him if I close my eyes, hes somewhere out  there in this great republic of ours, rolling around from town to town city  to city in that white V.O of his, giving himself to those in need. Vanilla  Ice was many things, he was a musician, an actor( judging by his work in  this film, perhaps the finest ever.)but most of all he was a healer. It was  his bussom that we cried into after the gulf war, he was there to comfort  us, and well we took him for granted and asked for too much , we didn't  realize that he was only human just like us, and so he went away. What he  left us with was an album and this very movie( a testament to love,  compassion, and of course a word to our mother earth.) Perhaps someday when  we least expect it he will return to reclaim our undying devotion, that is  if we keep our hearts pure and open. And together they will beat, Can you  hear them Vanilla  they are beating for you to drive that magnificent V.O  back into them, but most of all they beat for you.

What could be better than that?""  In time, this really began to sink in.While visiting my uncle during the summer, I'd try to describe to my other group of friends how stupid Cool As Ice was.  But somehow, I couldn't conjure up words to capture the vividness of the real thing.  Scenes would linger in my mind.  One day I realized with shock that I'd somehow developed a Cheetos association with the movie, and whenever I had a bag (which was often) Vanilla immediately popped into my mind.  With every delicious crunch I could hear his voice calling to me.To the marvel of my friends, when I returned home I wasted no time in requesting the film for that evening's entertainment.  I had changed, somehow.  I'd finally seen the light.  I'm not sure why it didn't click at first.  Maybe it was a passive aggressive reaction to a white guy having the first number one rap album.  Maybe I just hated flat tops.  Either way, I missed the boat, because my friends had gotten Ice out of their system and were now in a Ren and Stimpy phase.  So I bought the d**n thing.  I watch it alone with a bag of Cheetos and curse my friends.Don't be like me.  Be the one to buy it and introduce it to your friends.  That way, you won't miss the boat.  And you'll have more than an empty bag of Cheetos to keep you company at the end of the night.",5,Movies this good should come packaged with a bong,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,1626,"['used', 'hate', 'movie', 'stupid', 'friends', 'would', 'rent', 'time', ""'d"", 'had', 'few', 'bowls', 'um', 'cereal', 'would', 'protest', 'lobby', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Pamela', 'Anderson', 'film', 'would', 'inevitably', 'be', 'met', 'defense', 'lines', 'f***ing', 'Vanilla', 'Ice', 'crotch', 'rocket', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'time', 'really', 'began', 'sink', 'in.While', 'visiting', 'uncle', 'summer', ""'d"", 'try', 'describe', 'other', 'group', 'friends', 'how', 'stupid', 'Cool', 'Ice', 'was', 'somehow', 'could', ""n't"", 'conjure', 'up', 'words', 'capture', 'vividness', 'real', 'thing', 'Scenes', 'would', 'linger', 'mind', 'One', 'day', 'realized', 'shock', ""'d"", 'somehow', 'developed', 'Cheetos', 'association', 'movie', 'whenever', 'had', 'bag', 'was', 'often', 'Vanilla', 'immediately', 'popped', 'mind', 'delicious', 'crunch', 'could', 'hear', 'voice', 'calling', 'me.To', 'marvel', 'friends', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'wasted', 'time', 'requesting', 'film', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'had', 'changed', 'somehow', ""'d"", 'finally', 'seen', 'light', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'first', 'Maybe', 'was', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'reaction', 'white', 'guy', 'having', 'first', 'number', 'one', 'rap', 'album', 'Maybe', 'just', 'hated', 'flat', 'tops', 'way', 'missed', 'boat', 'friends', 'had', 'gotten', 'Ice', 'system', 'were', 'now', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'phase', 'bought', 'd**n', 'thing', 'watch', 'alone', 'bag', 'Cheetos', 'curse', 'friends.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Be', 'one', 'buy', 'introduce', 'friends', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'boat', ""'ll"", 'have', 'more', 'empty', 'bag', 'Cheetos', 'keep', 'company', 'end', 'night']",N/A

This dramatic piece of art has been the inspiration for many films I think(Cider House Rules, American Beauty, and Problem Child to name a few). Rap star, Johnny Van Owen can bust some funky rhymes, and can schling a schlong with the best of them, yet there is still a void in his life. After his big show(where he obtains the lovely Monique's phone number), Johnny, Sir D and the rest of his posse hit the road on their bikes and start a magical journey. Johnny, as demonstrated by his ""Down By Law"" leather, is rebellious, yet warm and friendly, but he is in search of something. He isn't really from anywhere because as we all know ""it ain't where your from, it's where your at."" Johnny finds himself riding alongside a girl(Kathy, a brilliant 1600 SAT scoring girl) driving a horse and he is so fearless, so driven by his desire to fill his void, that he jumps the 4 foot high fence, without the aid of a ramp, scaring the ""hoise"" and knocking her to the ground . When he checks to see if she's ok, she punches him in the stomach. ""You punch pretty good, for a girl"", he jokingly proclaims. Yup, Yup, she likes him. The posse then proceeds into town where Sir D's bike breaks down(possibly due to gerry curl in the engine, as a posse member jokes). They then take the bike to some eccentric artists' house who offer to fix the bike. Johnny finds out that Kathy lives in the same neighborhood as the artists, so he goes to Schling a Schlong at her house. There's one problem: her boyfriend ..., umm I mean Nick. Nick represents the ills of society: corruption, greed, and he does not wear neon green pants or shave his eyebrows. When Johnny approaches, ..., I mean Nick, Nick proclaims ""What is that?"" Nick asks Kathy if she knows him. Johnny,upon learning her name is Kathy) affectionately calls her Kat. They say their goodbyes and Johnny utters the most famous line since Gone With The Wind, when he says ""Words of Wisdom, drop that zero and get with the hero."" This is still a very popular pickup line at bars and nightclubs. Johnny , with the skill of a magician comandeers Kat's dayplanner, proclaiming ""Lookie, lookie in Kat's black bookie."" We later learn that Mr. Gordon Winslow(Kat's dad) is not whom he appears to be. He is actually James Anthony Hackett, a former cop who busted some thugs, some 20 years ago, and now they want revenge on the whole family: Kat, Tommy, (her kid brother) and the parents. Will Kat come to love Johnny? Will The Sugar Shack(the hippest club in town) come alive with another ice perfomance? Will ..., I mean Nick get beat up after playing baseball with Sir D's bike?  Will the Winslow's call the cops to get the bad guys. If you are down by law, if you shave your eyebrows, if you wear neon green pants, and enjoy witness relocation movies starring white rap stars then this movie is for you. Words of wisdom, buy this movie. I'm outta here, just like yesterday.
