Biohunter should be one of those classics.  It was made by the same people that made Wicked City and Ninja Scroll, two of the most famous old-school anime movies of all time, and it shows.  The basic premise of the movie is that werewolves, vampires, and monsters actually could be real, if there were a genetic disorder that mutated people into these creatures.  Two professors are fighting these monsters, and one of them has contracted the &quot;demon virus&quot; himself.  The character designs are brilliant, especially for the infected professor. The action scenes are intense, and the animation is top-notch.  There is a small amount of gore, but just enough to keep it exciting.  It's R-rated stuff, but it won't make you sick like some anime.  It's only an hour long, but it's definitely not rushed, and you probably won't even notice how short it is.

Oh sure, it has the smae content from Wicked City, but....well....there is not enough of it to satisfy fans of Wicked City. If the film had been longer I would have appreciated it more, but Bio Hunter is one of those could-have-been-better films. Still, if Wicked City is rented out at the video store (my video store always has Wicked City rented out), rent this for a little taste of Wicked City. However, I can not give Urban Vision any conpensation for their so called 'Special Edition' of Bio Hunter. The only thing special is the storyboards which were not really that great. And that does it for the Extras. Thats right. No trailer, interviews or image gallery. Overall, if Bio Hunter appeals to you, rent it. If you want to buy it, I suggest trying Wicked City instead.

I really haven't a clue other then this is a really hard to get film that IS Excellent and has high quality sound and graphics. its been remastered nicely. its just a shame that the extras seem to have not been special enough for the ""special edition"" 3 1/2 stars overall. *this would have easily been 4 stars but 2 negatives. one the silly cartooon sex scene and 2 the lack of more story and battles when there Clearly was loads of room for Tons more.

Try having to hunt the beasts that are infected while being infected yourself, keeping the virus in check (to some degree) while using it as a weapon to both detect the beasts and to destroy them as well. That's the reasoning behind the Bio Hunters, Komada and Koshigaya, and the Demon virus that seems to be working its way through the streets of Tokyo; most notably resulting in a series of brutal attacks on young women of the city and the subsequent ingestion of their internal organs. Still, that's before the oddities of love, emotion, politics, and divination enter the already clustered field.Although in the really short department (45 minutes isn't something I normally approve of), Bio Hunter more than makes up for this fact with portions of intrigue - and the occasional person that happens across the mind of Yoshisaki Kawajiri. His stamp is more than apparent here, too, with the horror of the story delivering and the pace of the piece moving pretty quickly, showing the viewer that it is the lack of padding and not content that keeps the length minimal. Combine this with quality animation, a plot that drips blood, nudity, violence, some nice scenery dripping blood and violence, and a story that is worth keeping pace with and you have a ""special something"" that everyone should at least look into.",5,Liver: What Nine out of Ten Demons Prefer,1041811200,"01 6, 2003",2003,1483,"['What', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'contracting', 'virus', 'overtake', 'make', 'consume', 'human', 'flesh', 'spreading', 'random', 'seemingly', 'unknown', 'reason', 'Try', 'having', 'hunt', 'beasts', 'are', 'infected', 'being', 'infected', 'keeping', 'virus', 'check', 'degree', 'using', 'weapon', 'detect', 'beasts', 'destroy', 'as', 'well', 'reasoning', 'Bio', 'Hunters', 'Komada', 'Koshigaya', 'Demon', 'virus', 'be', 'working', 'way', 'streets', 'Tokyo', 'most', 'notably', 'resulting', 'series', 'brutal', 'attacks', 'young', 'women', 'city', 'subsequent', 'ingestion', 'internal', 'organs', 'Still', 'oddities', 'love', 'emotion', 'politics', 'divination', 'enter', 'already', 'clustered', 'field.Although', 'really', 'short', 'department', '45', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'something', 'normally', 'approve', 'Bio', 'Hunter', 'more', 'up', 'fact', 'portions', 'intrigue', 'occasional', 'person', 'mind', 'Yoshisaki', 'Kawajiri', 'stamp', 'more', 'apparent', 'here', 'too', 'horror', 'story', 'delivering', 'pace', 'piece', 'moving', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'showing', 'viewer', 'lack', 'padding', 'not', 'content', 'length', 'minimal', 'Combine', 'quality', 'animation', 'plot', 'blood', 'nudity', 'violence', 'nice', 'scenery', 'dripping', 'blood', 'violence', 'story', 'worth', 'keeping', 'pace', 'have', 'special', 'something', 'everyone', 'should', 'least', 'look']",N/A
