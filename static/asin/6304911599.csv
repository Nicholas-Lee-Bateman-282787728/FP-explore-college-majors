439162,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6304911599,Acute Observer,"[9, 68]","Prime Suspect 1This 1991 film begins at night when cars drive down the street. The police arrive to see the body of a young woman. She has been dead for 1 to 2 hours [but her blood is not black and clotted].A small black book is given to the detective in charge, John Shefford. The blood type is analyzed from the fluid. There is a match on the computer to a man recently released from prison for a rape. George Marlow is arrested and interrogated. [The personal life of Jane Tennison pads out the story.] The lead detective has a heart attack; who will replace him? DCI Tennison wants what she should have. The victim was incorrectly identified as Della Mornay so the body must be identified from the missing persons report. [Does all that smoking have symbolism?] The details of the crime are explicit; the victims were tortured before death.The policemen resent their first woman detective [a subplot]. The victim was identified (Karen Howard). Her boyfriend knows nothing since they broke up. Suspect Marlow is released for lack of evidence. Then another victim is found, this is Della Mornay who rented the small flat. Where are the missing pages from Della's diary? The same torture marks as on Karen. DCI Tennison goes on live TV to get witnesses or find the missing car. Someone calls in as a witness, but identifies another man. The investigation goes on. [There is more padding to fill up time.] Tennison discovers something while working late and goes to Oldham. Re-interviewing witnesses finds a new fact taht wasn't in the reports. Is there another suspect? But Tennison may be off the case. What is the connection between the victims? An assistant notices a connection. Moira is brought in for questioning. Will she talk? When George and Moira leave their flat they are followed by the police. There is a shocking discovery! [Now you know how it will end.] There is an arrest of a suspect for the six murders. Questioning continues until an emotional outburst and a final admission. The courtroom scene will have a final surprise.This is an interesting story in spite of the padding and interpersonal conflicts. I suspect Moira knew more that what she told. The hidden agenda is to show the police biased against a female chief detective. We don't know how true this is in England or other European countries. The suspect seems to hold a low-paying job but can afford to rent a large garage and let someone else hold the key. The one redeeming value of this film is its display of urban scenery.

DCI Jane Tennison, by far, is one of the most complex female characters ever written for television. She is layered, she is difficult and she is sublime. She is a character that many women can relate to. Her depth dives fathoms deep. She's soft and she's surly. She's a woman navigating the world and landscape of men; but her woman's heart is never absent.Dame Helen Mirren, a mistress of her craft, has not shied away from the darker sides of this character, as can be seen in ""Prime Suspect Seven."" American television could learn a lot from this series of stories. Our counterparts, across the pond, show us how to get it done.These stories are not for the faint of heart. They're gritty, realistic and heart-wrenching. They're about character. If you're looking for ""Law & Order,"" they're not for you. But if you're looking for something that delves deeper into the human machine, or character driven stories that make you think, they are definitely for you.And Jane Tennison, well, she's simply luminous.

If you saw it in America on PBS, you don't realize how much  continuity and tension are lost by all of the inevitable pledge breaks.Helen Mirren is nothing short of brilliant as Inspect Jane Tennison, the  first woman to hold the post of D.C.I. (Deputy Chief Inspector) on a major  homicide investigation. She must not only solve a series of murders, but  battle sexism and sabotoge within her department.Great acting in the  supporting roles and a first rate script (written by Linda LaPlante)are  enough to carry this story. But what really sets it apart is how it manages  to get you rooting for Jane Tennison without being cloying or sentimental.  We see this woman as a human being, warts and all. Her obsession with work  leads her to neglect her relationships. She is quick to anger. Sometimes  her first judgement is not the right one. But through it all you want her  to succeed. She gives everything to her job.If you like mysteries or  police stories, this is as fine as piece of television as you'll see.The video and audio transfer are only so-so (by DVD standards), but this  is the happy exception where the DVD is cheaper that VHS.

Thurlow,"[1, 1]","1992's ""Prime Suspect 1"" matches up superb British actress Helen Mirren with her signature role as tough, ambitious and flawed Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison.  In this, the opening production of what became a long-running series on PBS, DCI Tennison gets her big break when the lead DCI on a rape and murder cased dies of a heart attack.  Tennison convinces her reluctant boss to let her take over the case but she must face down resistance from the boys club murder squad.The story itself is an intriguing and gritty murder mystery that becomes more complicated in each of its four component episodes.  What seemed like a basic rape/murder is complicated by the discovery of an additional body and the possibility that both murders, and others, may be the work of a serial killer.  The investigation is hindered by a inside cover-up to protect the original investigating officer, and by a lack of definitive evidence.  Tennison and her crew must sort through a frustrating series of red herrings and blind alleys to get to the truth.  The writers of this production were wildly successful in maintaining the suspense to the very end.DCI Tennison is a highly capable police officer but distinctly a flawed hero.  She is smart, persistent, and empathetic with the victims in the case.  She is prepared to overturn every available rock to find the killer, but only her skill in office politics keeps her from being taken off the case when she steps on toes within the department.  Her relentless drive and ambition cause her to slight her relationships with her live-in boyfriend (Tom Wilkinson) and her family.  Her ruthlessness in solving the case takes her right to the limit of the law and perhaps a bit more, while her heavy drinking and smoking foreshadow future health problems.""Prime Suspect 1"" is very highly recommended as a superb British police procedural and as the opening act in a long-running and very successful crime drama series.",5,Gritty Crime Drama....,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,1955,"['1992', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '1', 'matches', 'superb', 'British', 'actress', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'signature', 'role', 'tough', 'ambitious', 'flawed', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'opening', 'production', 'what', 'became', 'long-running', 'series', 'PBS', 'DCI', 'Tennison', 'big', 'break', 'when', 'lead', 'DCI', 'rape', 'murder', 'cased', 'dies', 'heart', 'attack', 'Tennison', 'reluctant', 'boss', 'let', 'take', 'case', 'must', 'face', 'down', 'resistance', 'boys', 'club', 'murder', 'squad.The', 'story', 'intriguing', 'gritty', 'murder', 'mystery', 'more', 'complicated', 'four', 'component', 'episodes', 'What', 'seemed', 'basic', 'rape/murder', 'complicated', 'discovery', 'additional', 'body', 'possibility', 'murders', 'others', 'may', 'be', 'work', 'serial', 'killer', 'investigation', 'hindered', 'inside', 'cover-up', 'protect', 'original', 'investigating', 'officer', 'lack', 'definitive', 'evidence', 'Tennison', 'crew', 'must', 'sort', 'frustrating', 'series', 'red', 'herrings', 'blind', 'alleys', 'get', 'truth', 'writers', 'production', 'were', 'wildly', 'successful', 'maintaining', 'suspense', 'very', 'end.DCI', 'Tennison', 'highly', 'capable', 'police', 'officer', 'distinctly', 'flawed', 'hero', 'smart', 'persistent', 'empathetic', 'victims', 'case', 'prepared', 'overturn', 'available', 'rock', 'find', 'killer', 'only', 'skill', 'office', 'politics', 'keeps', 'being', 'taken', 'off', 'case', 'when', 'toes', 'department', 'relentless', 'drive', 'ambition', 'cause', 'slight', 'relationships', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', 'family', 'ruthlessness', 'solving', 'case', 'right', 'limit', 'law', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'more', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'foreshadow', 'future', 'health', 'problems', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '1', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'superb', 'British', 'police', 'procedural', 'opening', 'act', 'long-running', 'very', 'successful', 'crime', 'drama', 'series']",Prime Suspect 1

Tennison's obsession with the cases and fighting for credibility and respect from her colleagues don't help to her relationship with the boyfriend Peter Rawlins (Tom Wilkinson), either. Helen Mirren is superb as DCI Tennison playing the character that is sympathetic, tough, vulnerable, bright, very clever, and sexy - all at the same time. Mirren was voted the sexiest 60+ star in the word few months ago. I think she's been always incredibly attractive and desirable - and always will be. She definitely lit the screen at 46, in her first season of ""Prime Suspect"" (1991). Creator of the show, Lynda La Plante wrote the story that ranks among the best police procedures and it is terrific - complex, dynamic, with unexpected turns, and interesting multidimensional characters. Ralph Fiennes played one of his first roles as a boyfriend of a murdered girl and he was memorable in a very emotional scene opposite Mirren.

439181,AG8U6F6226GBZ,6304911599,Lotte,"[11, 16]","Reviewing the Complete Collection which I bought, this is my review.One vicious murder/mystery after another.  Incredible acting! (Though the story-lines were extremely brutal.  Also, imo, the male dominance over female Jane T. was a bit overdone, and the horror of the depictions over some long decayed bodies, not to mention the violent ways they were murdered, blood curdling.  Yet the plots themselves were extremely good, if very sadistic.My main personal objection was that there were no sub-titles with the films, nor did using DVD remotes which provides subtitles when the film itself doesn't, didn't help. All I got was gibberish type. These are the only films out of hundreds I own, that this happened on.  Many films, even most British films provide their own subtitles, even the old ones. Almost all American films provide subs.As an American, I only caught parts of the language, and that was a huge draw back. This was especially true in neighborhoods where the actors were speaking not only a British dialect, but a foreign British dialect, often very fast, making most of their dialogue impossible to understand. Most of the crimes did occur in such such neighborhoods or in poor neighborhoods where language sounded more like gibberish.  Very frustrating.  Even the cops rarely spoke distinctly, much of it fast and under their breath.  All, except for Jane.  No problem with her.  She spoke clearly, and her British accent didn't distract from understanding what she was saying.As said before, the police's constant harassment of Helen Mirren (Jane) was a bit over the top and after a few adventures it did became abit tiresome, and made the cops in charge appeared corrupt, which a few were.  Helen Mirren was great as usual, and so was the cast, (which is why I bought the films) but the constant actions of police and their ""lets get Jane"" attitude became annoying as she had proved herself over and over again. Is there really that much anti-feminism and jealousy in the British male police force?Perhaps the writers just used it as xtra difficulties in Jane's life, as if she didn't have enough on her plate. Big question. Why she stayed on the force was never made clear. Few scenes depicted her as happy.  Every plot was as violent and creepy as the next, and after a while I wasn't sure why I was watching. But you can't help it. This year, I watched them again, but this time it disturbed me more than the first, and so somewhere along the set, I put them away. I did think the first one was the best of the lot. No need to bring it back on disk 4 especially with a different actor as the killer.Jane had a hard time on her job, and gradually took to drink. An unfortunate ending for a dedicated cop who was one of the few actors whose speech I could understand. Helen Mirren was great, of course.  She always is.NBC has a new Prime Suspect.  American version.  Don't even bother.  It's just as hard to understand the Amer. English as the British, even if you turn on the sub-titles.  Commericals loom about every few minutes, and they are many and very looong.

But the Met is an all boys club.  Jane is also starting a new relationship with a divorcee, Peter (Tom Wilkinson).Episode 1 -A woman was found brutally murdered in the bed sit (business apartment) of prostitute Della Mornay.  DCI Shefford has been assigned the case.  They find a rare blood type in the bed sit and are able to trace it to a convicted rapist George Marlow.  They arrest and question Marlow and he admits to frequenting Della.  But the quick end of the investigation changes when DCI Shefford has a heart attack and dies.There is no available DCI's for the case, well no male DCI's.  Jane makes a pitch to her boss and with some trepidation, he gives her the case.  This makes her the first female DCI to handle a murder investigation.  The old boys network circles the wagons to sabotage Jane, lead by Shefford's second Detective Sergeant Bill Otley.The first thing that Jane does is confirm the victim's identity.  But the victim's finger prints do not match Della's, they must now find out the victim's identity.  They slim down the missing persons to two and Jane visits the family and discovers the girl's identity, Karen Howard.  Now they have to connect Marlow with Karen Howard.Episode 2 -The 72 hours is up and Jane must make a decision, charge or release Marlow.  Since she has no compelling evidence, Marlow is released.  This displeases everyone and Otley uses this to his advantage.Jane realizes something is wrong and looks through a desk and finds the missing Della Mornay file and diary.  The following day Otley has convinced the Superintendent to remove Jane from the case but now Jane has all the cards.  It comes out that not only Shefford but Otley knew Della Mornay.  She was their confidential informant.  Further, there are pages missing from her diary.  It turns out that Shefford also visited Della ""professionally"".Jane goes on Crime Watch to see if this will yield any clues and it does.  A witness is found and might tie Marlow to Karen Howard.(Look for Ralph Fiennes at the beginning of the episode as Karen's boyfriend.)Episode 3 -When the witness chooses the wrong person from the line up, the investigation is stepped up.  Jane goes to Marlow's employer and finds out that he started with the firm in Manchester and that his common law wife, Moira (Zoe Wannamaker), accompanied him on his sales trips.  Jane gets Marlow's trip records and has the crew match similar murders.  They locate three more homicides.  Also, Jane interviews Marlow's cell mate and finds out that Marlow had a lock-up (rental garage).In investigating the first suspected linked murder it is found out that Shefford was on the case.  Jane needs to find out if he was involved in the other investigations.  This is the last straw with her boss and is being taken off the case.Episode 4 -The crew has determined that enough similarities exist to consider these murders connected.  Now Jane has to figure out what tie Marlow to the victims.  It takes her assistant, a woman, to come up with Moira.  She is a free lance beautician.  Jane brings her in and starts to rattle her.When her boss ""The Gov"" catches up with her, she is told that all of her crew have refused to allow her removal from the case.  But the good news is interrupted by the news that George and Moira are on the move.At Euston underground, they split up.  The crew split up to follow them.  While Moira is off shopping, George leads them to the lock-up.  Both are arrested and after she is confronted again, Moira recants her testimony.  Then George confesses of the six cases.Lynda LaPlante has created one of the great police movies and the greatest female police character.  Helen Mirren gives a magnificent performance as the under appreciated DCI Jane Tennison.  She takes LaPlante's script and hits every nuance to perfection.This miniseries also featured early performances by future stars including a cameo by Ralph Fiennes, future Oscar nominee Tom Wilkenson as Jane's current boyfriend and a stunning performance by Zoe Wannamaker as Moira, the prime suspect's girlfriend.This series has spawned five additional miniseries, none of which was a good as the original but better than anything else on television. (The first three won Emmy Awards for Best Mini-Series).Buy this and the other and have a great time.DVD EXTRA: Helen Mirren biography",5,Best Way to Get the Man is Put a Woman on the Case,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,4526,"['Prime', 'Suspect', 'started', 'what', 'become', 'best', 'series', 'detective', 'specials', 'ever.Jane', 'Tennison', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'Deputy', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'DCI', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'London', 'Met', 'boys', 'club', 'Jane', 'also', 'starting', 'new', 'relationship', 'divorcee', 'Peter', 'Tom', 'Wilkinson', '.Episode', '1', '-A', 'woman', 'was', 'found', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'bed', 'sit', 'business', 'apartment', 'prostitute', 'Della', 'Mornay', 'DCI', 'Shefford', 'been', 'assigned', 'case', 'find', 'rare', 'blood', 'type', 'bed', 'sit', 'are', 'able', 'trace', 'convicted', 'rapist', 'George', 'Marlow', 'arrest', 'question', 'Marlow', 'frequenting', 'Della', 'quick', 'end', 'investigation', 'changes', 'when', 'DCI', 'Shefford', 'heart', 'attack', 'dies.There', 'available', 'DCI', 'case', 'well', 'male', 'DCI', 'Jane', 'pitch', 'boss', 'trepidation', 'case', 'first', 'female', 'DCI', 'handle', 'murder', 'investigation', 'old', 'boys', 'network', 'wagons', 'sabotage', 'Jane', 'lead', 'Shefford', 'second', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Bill', 'Otley.The', 'first', 'thing', 'Jane', 'confirm', 'victim', 'identity', 'victim', 'finger', 'prints', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'Della', 'must', 'now', 'find', 'out', 'victim', 'identity', 'slim', 'down', 'missing', 'persons', 'two', 'Jane', 'family', 'girl', 'identity', 'Karen', 'Howard', 'Now', 'have', 'connect', 'Marlow', 'Karen', 'Howard.Episode', '2', '-The', '72', 'hours', 'up', 'Jane', 'must', 'make', 'decision', 'charge', 'release', 'Marlow', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'Marlow', 'released', 'everyone', 'Otley', 'advantage.Jane', 'realizes', 'something', 'wrong', 'desk', 'missing', 'Della', 'Mornay', 'file', 'diary', 'following', 'day', 'Otley', 'convinced', 'Superintendent', 'remove', 'Jane', 'case', 'now', 'Jane', 'cards', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'Shefford', 'Otley', 'knew', 'Della', 'Mornay', 'was', 'confidential', 'informant', 'Further', 'are', 'pages', 'missing', 'diary', 'out', 'Shefford', 'also', 'visited', 'Della', 'professionally', '.Jane', 'Crime', 'Watch', 'see', 'will', 'yield', 'clues', 'witness', 'found', 'might', 'tie', 'Marlow', 'Karen', 'Howard', 'Look', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'beginning', 'episode', 'Karen', 'boyfriend', 'Episode', '3', 'witness', 'wrong', 'person', 'line', 'up', 'investigation', 'stepped', 'up', 'Jane', 'Marlow', 'employer', 'out', 'started', 'firm', 'Manchester', 'common', 'law', 'wife', 'Moira', 'Zoe', 'Wannamaker', 'accompanied', 'sales', 'trips', 'Jane', 'Marlow', 'trip', 'records', 'crew', 'match', 'similar', 'murders', 'locate', 'three', 'more', 'homicides', 'Also', 'Jane', 'Marlow', 'cell', 'mate', 'out', 'Marlow', 'had', 'lock-up', 'rental', 'garage', 'investigating', 'first', 'suspected', 'linked', 'murder', 'found', 'Shefford', 'was', 'case', 'Jane', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'involved', 'other', 'investigations', 'last', 'straw', 'boss', 'being', 'taken', 'off', 'case.Episode', '4', '-The', 'crew', 'determined', 'enough', 'similarities', 'exist', 'consider', 'murders', 'connected', 'Now', 'Jane', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'tie', 'Marlow', 'victims', 'assistant', 'woman', 'come', 'up', 'Moira', 'free', 'lance', 'beautician', 'Jane', 'starts', 'rattle', 'her.When', 'boss', 'Gov', 'up', 'told', 'crew', 'have', 'refused', 'allow', 'removal', 'case', 'good', 'news', 'interrupted', 'news', 'George', 'Moira', 'are', 'move.At', 'Euston', 'underground', 'split', 'up', 'crew', 'split', 'up', 'follow', 'Moira', 'shopping', 'George', 'lock-up', 'are', 'arrested', 'confronted', 'again', 'Moira', 'testimony', 'Then', 'George', 'confesses', 'six', 'cases.Lynda', 'LaPlante', 'created', 'one', 'great', 'police', 'movies', 'greatest', 'female', 'police', 'character', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'magnificent', 'performance', 'appreciated', 'DCI', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'LaPlante', 'script', 'hits', 'nuance', 'perfection.This', 'miniseries', 'also', 'featured', 'early', 'performances', 'future', 'stars', 'including', 'cameo', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'future', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Tom', 'Wilkenson', 'Jane', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Zoe', 'Wannamaker', 'Moira', 'prime', 'suspect', 'girlfriend.This', 'series', 'spawned', 'five', 'additional', 'miniseries', 'none', 'was', 'good', 'original', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'television', 'first', 'three', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Mini-Series', '.Buy', 'other', 'have', 'great', 'time.DVD', 'EXTRA', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'biography']",Prime Suspect 1

In fact, I'm pretty sure that annoyance was one of the things the producers were aiming for.  Unlike other mysteries with women leads (Blue Murder and Murder in Suburbia, to name two), DCI Jane Tennison is not accepted as head of the investigation when she takes over.  The police force is still very sexist, and the show highlights this at every turn.  It's infuriating to watch, though probably still very true of many places today.  So perhaps it's a little preachy, teaching the lesson of equality and all, but it's good that it's out there to show what it was like for women trying to climb into a man's world, and not sugar-coating it.The mystery itself was very well done.  It'll have you second-guessing your second-guesses, and there are plenty of false leads and mis-information.  My only complaint is not as much with the show as it is with the CDs.  All four episodes are the same story, and I don't understand why they wouldn't have fit on one disk.  It would have been better to have all four episodes on the first disk, so you could just play it all the way through, and all the extras on the other disk, to watch if you wanted.  Instead they have two episodes and some special features on each disk.  A minor annoyance, and I didn't deduct from the rating for it, but it was something I disliked.If you like gritty police crime dramas, this is a show for you.  It's outspoken and doesn't pull any punches.",4,Made me want to hurl things at the screen,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1496,"['one', 'series', 'hated', 'not', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'fact', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'annoyance', 'was', 'one', 'things', 'producers', 'were', 'aiming', 'other', 'mysteries', 'women', 'leads', 'Blue', 'Murder', 'Murder', 'Suburbia', 'name', 'two', 'DCI', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'not', 'accepted', 'head', 'investigation', 'when', 'police', 'force', 'still', 'very', 'sexist', 'show', 'turn', 'infuriating', 'watch', 'probably', 'still', 'very', 'true', 'many', 'places', 'today', 'So', 'perhaps', 'little', 'preachy', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'equality', 'good', 'out', 'there', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'women', 'trying', 'climb', 'man', 'world', 'not', 'sugar-coating', 'it.The', 'mystery', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', ""'ll"", 'have', 'second-guessing', 'second-guesses', 'are', 'plenty', 'false', 'leads', 'mis-information', 'only', 'complaint', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'show', 'CDs', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'same', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'one', 'disk', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'have', 'four', 'episodes', 'first', 'disk', 'could', 'just', 'play', 'way', 'extras', 'other', 'disk', 'watch', 'wanted', 'Instead', 'have', 'two', 'episodes', 'special', 'features', 'disk', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'did', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'rating', 'was', 'something', 'disliked.If', 'gritty', 'police', 'crime', 'dramas', 'show', 'outspoken', ""n't"", 'pull', 'punches']",Prime Suspect 1
