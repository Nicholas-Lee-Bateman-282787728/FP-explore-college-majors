Don't I wish I can have that ability. The most amazing part of this DVD was the interview with Cynthia Rothrock. To see her explaination of certain scenes was nice. But one thing that bugs me was her semi nude body in a romantic sexual scene. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful but I'm not used to seeing her in those scenes, But she pulled it off. In my opinion I gave this movie 5 stars, just because it had it all:) And I would love to train to fight like her.  Just to stay in shape and to take care of my self when nesacerry. But this is my opinion you'd have to see it then agree, if you agree with every one, or just put in your two cents in a review.:)",5,Amazing,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,776,"[""'m"", 'such', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'movie', 'was', 'action', 'packed', 'funny', 'phsyic', 'ability', 'touch', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'can', 'have', 'ability', 'most', 'amazing', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'interview', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'see', 'explaination', 'certain', 'scenes', 'was', 'nice', 'one', 'thing', 'bugs', 'was', 'semi', 'nude', 'body', 'romantic', 'sexual', 'scene', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'not', 'used', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'pulled', 'off', 'opinion', 'gave', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'had', 'would', 'love', 'train', 'fight', 'Just', 'stay', 'shape', 'take', 'care', 'self', 'when', 'nesacerry', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'have', 'see', 'then', 'agree', 'agree', 'one', 'just', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'review']",Sworn to Justice

However, what I liked about this movie was, you have the star of ""No Retreat No Surrender I"" (Kurt McKinney) joins forces with the star of ""No Retreat No Surrender II"" (Cynthia Rothrock). The story was predictable and the direction lost track only but a couple of times. However, it showed Cynthia in a view worthy of a classy pretty lady who is also a weapon. My wife and I both liked this movie as the music score matched with the martial arts action and other scenes perfectly. Kurt's role could have displayed more action i.e. my reason and point for stipulating the direction loses track.

664249,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005LP3O,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[0, 0]","Many good things about this movie make it better than many B grade martial art films, but unfortunately, there was just too little action for my needs and the pacing of this movie felt too eratic.The story is definetly more interesting in Sworn to Justice than most martial art films, and the plot thickens nicely and has some surprises throughout.  The charcaters are ok, some are really good and some not so good, and Cynthia Rothrock has many up and downs throughout the movie.  Her acting can be pretty good at times, and then not so good.  The movie also stars Kurt Mckinnley (from No Retreat, No Surrender - about 10 years before this film) who does a ok job, though a little bland.  The villain is played by Kenn Scott, who also does an ok job.  The movie begins a little weird with Janna (Cynthia Rothrock) getting psychic powers from a fall that would normally kill someone.  For the most part, the movie feels lagging at times, but finally gets exciting about 3/4 through.Unfortunately, there just wasn't as much action as I had hoped for.  The few fight scenes are pretty good, and my favorite was the fight between Kenn Scott and Kurt McKinnley.  A quick fight, only lasting 1-1/2 minutes, but exciting and very well done.Just another average film overall, with high spots and low spots.  I also point out that the picture and sound quality is better than most martial art B movies.

664251,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B00005LP3O,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[6, 6]","I'm pleased that among fan circles ""Sworn to Justice"" tends to get appreciated as a good latter-day adventure for Cynthia Rothrock. As the only solo vehicle she'd produce within an eight-year stretch and also what I consider to be her last really good outing to date as a martial arts star, it's fitting that Rothrock herself would point to this one as her favorite among her American features. As such, it's definitely worth picking up for fans and general karate aficionados alike...but it's not perfect. I'm almost sorry to say so, knowing how much effort when into this and seeing how different it is from the rest of Rothrock's work, but there are a couple of major drawbacks that just manage to pull this one's rating from a solid four stars down to a high three.The story: when a robbery leaves psychologist Janna (Rothrock,China O'Brien) hospitalized and her family dead, she awakens to a hitherto unrealized psychic power that allows her to track the criminals and uncover a massive plot of police corruption.The most apparent strength the film has is its impressive cast list. No other Cynthia Rothrock feature has quite so many genuine actors of repute in its credits: Tony Lo Bianco (The French Connection) as the shady detective, Walter Koenig (Star Trek) as Janna's psychiatrist colleague, Brad Dourif (The Two Towers) as the murder suspect, Mako (The Sand Pebbles) as Janna's blind martial arts instructor, and Mary Margaret Humes (Dawson's Creek) as a doomed friend all converge to give this one a dramatic credibility that virtually all other Rothrock flicks have lacked. However, the first major drawback of the feature is that this unique cast isn't fully utilized. Koenig, Dourif, and Mako are all restricted to only a couple of scenes, which may have all been shot in a day apiece. And while it's genuinely cool to see Cynthia acting alongside performers you could see in much larger productions, they don't elevate the movie's quality as dramatically as one would hope: with the exception of Bianco, the roles of the other stars could conceivably have been played by capable lesser-known players and they still would have left a similar impression.The action generally sticks to karate fistfights, and these deliver a mixed bag. Wanting to give the fight content some flair, Rothrock personally brought in Hong Kong choreographer Tak Yuen (Shaolin) to wrangle the fights - the first time Yuen'd worked on an American feature. However, apparently a second choreographer was needed, and longtime American staple Eric Lee also contributes to the action. Lee has delivered some good work in movies likeRing of Fire, but he can't really hold a candle to Yuen and as a result, it's easy to tell which fights were choreographed by whom. Three of the film's half-dozen fights stand out: the duels between Rothrock and Kenn Scott (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2) and Scott and Kurt McKinney (No Retreat No Surrender) for their quality, and the sound effect-filled scene wherein Janna thwarts a gang robbery for its unwelcome goofiness. The brawls seem split pretty evenly between the two choreographers, and because of this, I can only give the action content a 50% score.Production values are on the high side of things, although the movie's not particularly larger or flashier than many other direct-to-video actioneers. Even though I don't think the psychic angle was fully exploited, the film does deliver another special feature in Cynthia Rothrock's first topless love scene. Now, I don't watch action movies to see breasts, but this is pretty unique, seeing as Rothrock had hitherto gone her entire career without removing her clothes. She gives them up for Kurt McKinney, who's a strange choice but does pretty well in his first martial arts flick in ten years, so let's say he deserved it. Rothrock and he have good chemistry, and I'm glad it was played tastefully.Again, established fans ought to definitely place this one in their collection, and folks who enjoy American martial arts films in general should give it a try as well. Despite its flaws, it's  still one of the most solid pictures our Kung Fu Queen has made in this half of her career, and deserves to be seen.",3,"Cynthia Rothrock: Sensual, Psychic, Silly",1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,4197,"[""'m"", 'pleased', 'fan', 'circles', 'Sworn', 'Justice', 'get', 'appreciated', 'good', 'latter-day', 'adventure', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'only', 'solo', 'vehicle', ""'d"", 'produce', 'eight-year', 'stretch', 'also', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'last', 'really', 'good', 'outing', 'date', 'martial', 'arts', 'star', 'fitting', 'Rothrock', 'would', 'point', 'one', 'favorite', 'American', 'features', 'such', 'definitely', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'fans', 'general', 'karate', 'aficionados', 'not', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'almost', 'sorry', 'say', 'so', 'knowing', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'when', 'seeing', 'how', 'different', 'rest', 'Rothrock', 'work', 'are', 'couple', 'major', 'drawbacks', 'just', 'manage', 'pull', 'one', 'rating', 'solid', 'four', 'stars', 'down', 'high', 'three.The', 'story', 'when', 'robbery', 'psychologist', 'Janna', 'Rothrock', 'China', ""O'Brien"", 'hospitalized', 'family', 'dead', 'hitherto', 'unrealized', 'psychic', 'power', 'track', 'criminals', 'uncover', 'massive', 'plot', 'police', 'corruption.The', 'most', 'apparent', 'strength', 'film', 'impressive', 'cast', 'list', 'other', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'feature', 'quite', 'so', 'many', 'genuine', 'actors', 'repute', 'credits', 'Tony', 'Lo', 'Bianco', 'French', 'Connection', 'shady', 'detective', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Janna', 'psychiatrist', 'colleague', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'Two', 'Towers', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Mako', 'Sand', 'Pebbles', 'Janna', 'blind', 'martial', 'arts', 'instructor', 'Mary', 'Margaret', 'Humes', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'doomed', 'friend', 'converge', 'give', 'one', 'dramatic', 'credibility', 'virtually', 'other', 'Rothrock', 'flicks', 'have', 'lacked', 'However', 'first', 'major', 'drawback', 'feature', 'unique', 'cast', ""n't"", 'fully', 'utilized', 'Koenig', 'Dourif', 'Mako', 'are', 'restricted', 'only', 'couple', 'scenes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'day', 'apiece', 'genuinely', 'cool', 'see', 'Cynthia', 'acting', 'performers', 'could', 'see', 'much', 'larger', 'productions', 'do', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'movie', 'quality', 'as', 'dramatically', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'exception', 'Bianco', 'roles', 'other', 'stars', 'could', 'conceivably', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'capable', 'lesser-known', 'players', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'similar', 'impression.The', 'action', 'generally', 'karate', 'fistfights', 'deliver', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Wanting', 'give', 'fight', 'content', 'flair', 'Rothrock', 'personally', 'brought', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'choreographer', 'Tak', 'Yuen', 'Shaolin', 'wrangle', 'fights', 'first', 'time', 'Yuen', ""'d"", 'worked', 'American', 'feature', 'However', 'apparently', 'second', 'choreographer', 'was', 'needed', 'longtime', 'American', 'staple', 'Eric', 'Lee', 'also', 'action', 'Lee', 'delivered', 'good', 'work', 'movies', 'likeRing', 'Fire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'candle', 'Yuen', 'result', 'easy', 'tell', 'fights', 'were', 'choreographed', 'whom', 'Three', 'film', 'half-dozen', 'fights', 'stand', 'out', 'duels', 'Rothrock', 'Kenn', 'Scott', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', '2', 'Scott', 'Kurt', 'McKinney', 'No', 'Retreat', 'No', 'Surrender', 'quality', 'sound', 'effect-filled', 'scene', 'wherein', 'Janna', 'gang', 'robbery', 'unwelcome', 'goofiness', 'brawls', 'seem', 'split', 'pretty', 'evenly', 'two', 'choreographers', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'action', 'content', '50', '%', 'score.Production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'side', 'things', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'larger', 'flashier', 'many', 'other', 'direct-to-video', 'actioneers', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'psychic', 'angle', 'was', 'fully', 'exploited', 'film', 'deliver', 'special', 'feature', 'Cynthia', 'Rothrock', 'first', 'topless', 'love', 'scene', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'action', 'movies', 'see', 'breasts', 'pretty', 'unique', 'seeing', 'Rothrock', 'had', 'hitherto', 'gone', 'entire', 'career', 'removing', 'clothes', 'up', 'Kurt', 'McKinney', 'who', 'strange', 'choice', 'pretty', 'well', 'first', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'ten', 'years', 'let', 'say', 'deserved', 'Rothrock', 'have', 'good', 'chemistry', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'played', 'tastefully.Again', 'established', 'fans', 'ought', 'definitely', 'place', 'one', 'collection', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'American', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'general', 'should', 'give', 'try', 'as', 'well', 'flaws', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'solid', 'pictures', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Queen', 'made', 'half', 'career', 'be', 'seen']",Sworn to Justice
