In Germany it opened a week after &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (so Angelina Jolie was one of the reasons I went to see it), and because it was praised as a love story, I took my girlfriend - and she also loved it! Jolie (more beautiful than ever in those costumes), Banderas and Thomas Jane (&quot;Thursday&quot;) did a good job in their roles, but mostly the erotic and morbid atmosphere of Havanna during carneval was what made the movie so pleasent to watch.

687624,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005V4XU,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Yes, this plot tends to derail the film in parts (I mean really, this is not a realistic film at all), but the performances, the stunning direction, the love scenes, the steamy chemistry and the art direction (those sets are glorious) make this a very rewarding and splendidly desirable movie to watch.  I like how some state this is `so bad it's good', but I really don't think it's `bad' at all.  It's sleek, sensual and provoking, not to mention gorgeous to look at.The film centers around the whirlwind romance between a wealthy Cuban coffee plantation owner named Luis who sends away for a mail-order bride named Julia only to find that she is far from what he expected.  The two are obviously very attracted to one another and soon fall into love, or so it seems.  When Julia disappears with all of Luis's money, not to mention his heart, he sets out to find her and exact his revenge.  His journey leads him to find a world filled to the brim with intrigue, danger and romance.The first half of the film is a stunning unraveling of love and lust, and Angelina Jolie's languid sensuality coupled with Antonia Banderas's fearlessness really elevates the scenes and creates something that feels beautiful yet almost dirty; tender yet dangerous.  The second half of the film starts strong, with wild splashes of color and deftly cultivated sequences of desire, but soon after the couple is reunited the sudden game of cat-and-mouse starts to delve into tediousness.  The ending to me was a cop-out (even if it's what you secretly are desiring) and it gave the film an almost camp like feeling (the way the character's seem to be toying with you is somewhat off putting in a `look we can be funny' kind of way).It's that last quarter of the film that really drives a nail in the coffin for me.As for the bulk of the film though, `Original Sin' really does it for me.  Jolie is a very spirited and competent performer.  The only fault that could be found her is that she does rest on her natural desirable qualities in a lot of her work (very reminiscent of Johansson in that regard) but when the script calls for it, how can you `fault' her.  The script definitely calls for it here, and she delivers.  You believe her, even when the dialog seems to be fighting against her (the fiery ""because I was falling in love with my husband!"" scene is a bit contrived, but she makes it work somehow).  Banderas doesn't fare as well as Jolie, but he goes for it.  I've always enjoyed him, but I've always found his acting a bit awkward.  I think it's the way he speaks for me.  I love when foreign actors convert to English films (I love foreign actors, period) but some have trouble with the language and they speak in way that makes each word almost seem like a struggle.  Banderas gives me that vibe, thus making some of his dialog seem unconvincing.For me, this biggest acting glitch is Thomas Jane (who ruins a lot of the second half for me as well) and honestly feel if the part had been recast the film would have worked much better in the end, but then again, the character was pretty horrible to begin with.So, watch the movie.  It is not as bad as some claim it to be, and even when it falls short it makes up for it in other areas.  Some say this is a skin flick (the unrated version certainly straddles the fence of `adult entertainment') but there is more here than that.  The darkness attributed to the plot adds a layer to the film that takes it out of that lazy category and gives it a life of its own.",4,Sinfully delicious...,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,3510,"['Yes', 'plot', 'derail', 'film', 'parts', 'mean', 'really', 'not', 'realistic', 'film', 'performances', 'stunning', 'direction', 'love', 'scenes', 'steamy', 'chemistry', 'art', 'direction', 'sets', 'are', 'glorious', 'make', 'very', 'rewarding', 'splendidly', 'desirable', 'movie', 'watch', 'how', 'state', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'sleek', 'sensual', 'provoking', 'not', 'mention', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'at.The', 'film', 'centers', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'wealthy', 'Cuban', 'coffee', 'plantation', 'owner', 'named', 'Luis', 'who', 'away', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'named', 'Julia', 'only', 'find', 'far', 'what', 'expected', 'two', 'are', 'obviously', 'very', 'attracted', 'one', 'soon', 'fall', 'love', 'so', 'When', 'Julia', 'Luis', 'money', 'not', 'mention', 'heart', 'out', 'find', 'exact', 'revenge', 'journey', 'find', 'world', 'filled', 'brim', 'intrigue', 'danger', 'romance.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'stunning', 'unraveling', 'love', 'lust', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'languid', 'sensuality', 'coupled', 'Antonia', 'Banderas', 'fearlessness', 'really', 'scenes', 'creates', 'something', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'almost', 'dirty', 'tender', 'yet', 'dangerous', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'strong', 'wild', 'splashes', 'color', 'deftly', 'cultivated', 'sequences', 'desire', 'soon', 'couple', 'reunited', 'sudden', 'game', 'cat-and-mouse', 'starts', 'delve', 'tediousness', 'ending', 'was', 'cop-out', 'even', 'what', 'secretly', 'are', 'desiring', 'gave', 'film', 'almost', 'camp', 'feeling', 'way', 'character', 'seem', 'be', 'toying', 'somewhat', 'off', 'putting', 'look', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'kind', 'way', '.It', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'really', 'nail', 'coffin', 'me.As', 'bulk', 'film', 'Original', 'Sin', 'really', 'Jolie', 'very', 'spirited', 'competent', 'performer', 'only', 'fault', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'rest', 'natural', 'desirable', 'qualities', 'lot', 'work', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Johansson', 'regard', 'when', 'script', 'how', 'can', 'fault', 'script', 'definitely', 'here', 'delivers', 'believe', 'even', 'when', 'dialog', 'be', 'fighting', 'fiery', 'was', 'falling', 'love', 'husband', 'scene', 'bit', 'contrived', 'work', 'somehow', 'Banderas', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'Jolie', ""'ve"", 'always', 'enjoyed', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'acting', 'bit', 'awkward', 'think', 'way', 'love', 'when', 'foreign', 'actors', 'convert', 'English', 'films', 'love', 'foreign', 'actors', 'period', 'have', 'trouble', 'language', 'speak', 'way', 'word', 'almost', 'seem', 'struggle', 'Banderas', 'vibe', 'thus', 'making', 'dialog', 'seem', 'biggest', 'acting', 'glitch', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'who', 'lot', 'second', 'half', 'well', 'honestly', 'feel', 'part', 'had', 'been', 'recast', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'end', 'then', 'again', 'character', 'was', 'pretty', 'horrible', 'begin', 'with.So', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'claim', 'be', 'even', 'when', 'short', 'up', 'other', 'areas', 'say', 'skin', 'flick', 'unrated', 'version', 'certainly', 'fence', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'more', 'here', 'darkness', 'attributed', 'plot', 'layer', 'film', 'lazy', 'category', 'life', 'own']",N/A

Yeah, maybe just the one - personally I think it's seen better days.  Somebody else described ""Original Sin"" as a convincing period piece.  Um, it's not.  This is not Cuba of any period, this is a 2 hour Ralph Lauren Safari ad.  But you know, I saw it in the theatre (on a date, isn't that hilarious) and then I rented the DVD, cuz what can I say, sometimes I enjoy a 2 hour Ralph Lauren Safari ad.  Specifically I like that scene with all those petals raining down on that huge party in the hotel in (I think it's supposed to be) Havana.  I watch that and I want to be there.  Also, the actors are eye candy.  And since I did see both the theatrical release and the DVD, I know what the DVD includes for ""extra footage"" - but I could probably have guessed anyway.  I mean, we've got two naked people on a bed of roses on the cover, with ""Unrated Edition"" scrolled across the top and a pull-quote that says ""Steamy!""  Things get pretty raw in this movie considering it isn't an actual porno - don't watch it if sex annoys you or whatever.  I wonder if Melanie and Billy Bob get together on a Sunday night and watch it.  Other than that it just seems to play off Angelina Jolie's public persona as a beautiful, slightly disturbed, sexually charismatic in a vaguely wicked way, thrill-seeking bad girl.  It's a shame she hasn't been in more really good films, cuz she has proved she can act.  But ""Tomb Raider"" was awful, ""Life or Something Like It"" was awful, and this is beyond awful.  So awful it's hilarious - which can be a good thing.

687638,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B00005V4XU,Charismatic Creature,"[0, 3]","WARNING: SOME VERY MILD SPOILERS*****The first time I saw this, I was prepared to laugh at a sleazy, direct-to-video Harlequin novel-on-celluloid. What is it about Antonio Banderas? He's very handsome and not a bad actor, but he seems to choose a lot of really cheesy projects, ""Femme Fatale"" being a particularly awful one I recall watching.But I thought this was a decently entertaining, if not brilliantly deep film. I was unaware at that time of it's provenance -- it's based on an excellent novel by Cornell Woolrich called ""Waltz into Darkness"". The book is well worth reading if you like this film. It was also made into a film in the mid-sixties by Francois Truffaut called (inexplicably ) ""Mississippi Mermaid"". Strange title, because the original novel is set in 1870s New Orleans and Julia travels to meet Louis on a steamer down the Mississipp BUT in the Truffaut film he reset the story in the 60s and the action of the film in colonial Africa and the French Riviera!""Original Sin"" is, interesting, vastly closer to the novel than the Truffaut version. The setting is changed to Cuba, presumably to accodomodate Bandera's accent, but the period is correct and the story doesn't work well in modern times, so overall, I find ""Original Sin"" to be the better of the two movies -- and that's saying a lot, as Truffaut is revered as a brilliant director. (""Mississippi Mermaid"" is NOT by any means one of his better efforts, however.)An early cautionary tale of ""personals ads"" and blind dating, the story seems even more relevant today than when it was written. Luis (Banderas) writes to a mail order bride, who is supposed to be plain, shy and religious. He is surprised when stunningly beautiful and sexy Julia (Angelina Jolie, of the collagen injected lips) shows up. Even though she betrays him and cheats on him and steals all his money...he still loves her. Both film versions clean up the ending -- I won't give the film ending away -- but in the book, Julia/Bonny actually kills Louis/Luis. A very bleak ending. Don't worry, the movie is a lot more fun.The kind of film that falls under the heading of ""guilty pleasure"", ""Original Sin"" has lots of great costumes and sets and Banderas and Jolie are two of the sexiest people imaginable and we get to watch them getting hot and heavy. (BTW: the ""unrated version"" isn't really all that dirty...I don't get the rating thing. The sex isn't graphic or bizarre in any way -- it's two people who are MARRIED and making love. In the age of ""Sex in the City"", what the heck is the big deal?)Anyways, call over your best girlfriends, microwave some popcorn and have a good time....",2,Mildly entertaining chick flick,1088294400,"06 27, 2004",2004,2638,"['WARNING', 'SOME', 'VERY', 'MILD', 'SPOILERS*****The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'prepared', 'laugh', 'sleazy', 'direct-to-video', 'Harlequin', 'novel-on-celluloid', 'What', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'very', 'handsome', 'not', 'bad', 'actor', 'choose', 'lot', 'really', 'cheesy', 'projects', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'being', 'particularly', 'awful', 'one', 'recall', 'watching.But', 'thought', 'was', 'decently', 'entertaining', 'not', 'brilliantly', 'deep', 'film', 'was', 'unaware', 'time', 'provenance', 'based', 'excellent', 'novel', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'called', 'Waltz', 'Darkness', 'book', 'well', 'worth', 'reading', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'film', 'mid-sixties', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'called', 'inexplicably', 'Mississippi', 'Mermaid', 'Strange', 'title', 'original', 'novel', 'set', '1870s', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Julia', 'travels', 'meet', 'Louis', 'steamer', 'down', 'Mississipp', 'BUT', 'Truffaut', 'film', 'reset', 'story', '60s', 'action', 'film', 'colonial', 'Africa', 'French', 'Riviera', 'Original', 'Sin', 'interesting', 'vastly', 'closer', 'novel', 'Truffaut', 'version', 'setting', 'changed', 'Cuba', 'presumably', 'accodomodate', 'Bandera', 'accent', 'period', 'correct', 'story', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'modern', 'times', 'overall', 'find', 'Original', 'Sin', 'be', 'better', 'two', 'movies', 'saying', 'lot', 'Truffaut', 'revered', 'brilliant', 'director', 'Mississippi', 'Mermaid', 'NOT', 'means', 'one', 'better', 'efforts', 'however', 'early', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'personals', 'ads', 'blind', 'dating', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'written', 'Luis', 'Banderas', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'plain', 'shy', 'religious', 'surprised', 'when', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'Julia', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'collagen', 'injected', 'lips', 'up', 'Even', 'cheats', 'steals', 'money', 'still', 'film', 'versions', 'clean', 'up', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'ending', 'away', 'book', 'Julia/Bonny', 'actually', 'Louis/Luis', 'very', 'bleak', 'ending', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'fun.The', 'kind', 'film', 'heading', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Original', 'Sin', 'lots', 'great', 'costumes', 'sets', 'Banderas', 'Jolie', 'are', 'two', 'sexiest', 'people', 'imaginable', 'get', 'watch', 'getting', 'hot', 'heavy', 'unrated', 'version', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'dirty', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'rating', 'thing', 'sex', ""n't"", 'graphic', 'bizarre', 'way', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'MARRIED', 'making', 'love', 'age', 'Sex', 'City', 'what', 'heck', 'big', 'deal', 'Anyways', 'call', 'best', 'girlfriends', 'microwave', 'popcorn', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A

An unrated version is also available, with extra footage and a commentary track.)This is a perfect example of bad marketing. All the ads for Original Sin amplify the sexual chemistry between stars Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie. This is, in fact, a minor part of the story, at least in this, the R-rated version.Original Sin is, in fact, an old-fashioned film noir, updated in mentality, but not in time. (The film takes place in the nineteenth century, but Jolie's character appears unaware of this except in her manner of dress.)Luis Vargas (Banderas) sends away for a mail-order bride. Julia Russell (Jolie) arrives at the train station, looking much better than her photograph.But new wife Julia has many secrets, not least of which is...ah, but that would be giving it away.Based on the novel Waltz into Darkness (by Cornell Woolrich, author of Rear Window), writer/director Michael Cristofer (Gia) has fashioned a gripping narrative and wonderful acting opportunities for his stars, but he smothers it in overacting (of which Banderas is the only nonparticipant) and distracting editing techniques like using multiple cuts throughout dramatic scenes best left as one long shot and in useless slow-motion. The result is a mishmash of bad filmmaking, in which an interesting story is almost unrecognizable as such.(This DVD contains no extras of any kind.

It's a brilliantly casted and wonderfully scripted story of blind love.  When Luis (Bandaras) meets his mail-order-bride Julia (Jolie) he is stunned at her beauty.  She is nothing like he expected, yet he marries her immediatly.  Luis is the perfect gentleman, and that makes Julia's next move even harder.  Once she has gained Luis' trust she leaves him, taking him for every cent.  Luis then, with the help of a P.I., decides he will find her, and kill her.  The problem is that he still loves her.  But does she love him?  This film shows the dark side of love, the side that allows you to love someone you don't even know, but can feel, someone you connect with, someone that makes you whole.  Jolie and Bandaras are spot on (especially with their clothes off...HOT HOT HOT) and they work wonders with this script.  I have watched this film over and over and still can't get enough of it.  The unrated version of this film offers a steamier and much more explicet love scene with movement and lots of nudity (no full frontal Bandaras shots though, you'll have to settle for quite a few butt shots) and it includes a few other sex scenes, less explicet, that were cut from the movie entirly.  Either way you'll be pleasently pleased.  The unrated version doesn't add anything new to the plot and or the flow of the film so pursue only if you're in dire need for a near-porn-like nude scene...otherwise, the theatrical version is just fine (and you still see quite a bit of nudity)...Great acting, great story, great bodies...what can I say but Great movie!",5,Dark Love Story,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,1617,"['film', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'there', 'need', 'watch', 'list', 'brilliantly', 'casted', 'wonderfully', 'scripted', 'story', 'blind', 'love', 'When', 'Luis', 'Bandaras', 'mail-order-bride', 'Julia', 'Jolie', 'stunned', 'beauty', 'nothing', 'expected', 'immediatly', 'Luis', 'perfect', 'gentleman', 'Julia', 'next', 'move', 'even', 'harder', 'Once', 'gained', 'Luis', 'trust', 'taking', 'cent', 'Luis', 'then', 'help', 'P.I.', 'will', 'find', 'kill', 'problem', 'still', 'love', 'film', 'dark', 'side', 'love', 'side', 'love', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'can', 'feel', 'someone', 'connect', 'someone', 'whole', 'Jolie', 'Bandaras', 'are', 'spot', 'especially', 'clothes', 'HOT', 'HOT', 'HOT', 'work', 'wonders', 'script', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'unrated', 'version', 'film', 'steamier', 'much', 'more', 'explicet', 'love', 'scene', 'movement', 'lots', 'nudity', 'full', 'frontal', 'Bandaras', 'shots', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'quite', 'few', 'butt', 'shots', 'few', 'other', 'sex', 'scenes', 'less', 'explicet', 'were', 'cut', 'movie', 'entirly', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasently', 'pleased', 'unrated', 'version', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'new', 'plot', 'flow', 'film', 'so', 'pursue', 'only', ""'re"", 'dire', 'need', 'near-porn-like', 'nude', 'scene', 'otherwise', 'theatrical', 'version', 'just', 'fine', 'still', 'see', 'quite', 'bit', 'nudity', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'bodies', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Great', 'movie']",N/A

687648,A1AEDW75371P5M,B00005V4XU,Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com),"[6, 7]","This movie starts out like any terrible made for TV soap opera, but amazingly it continues to get better and it finishes up as an interesting new take on the femme fatale archetype.  It is somewhat hard to believe that such a well worn plot could yield any knew ideas, yet this film seems to make an interesting reversal on the theme that indicates a reflection of a social change in regards to the role of women and men in society.The basic plot centers around a wealthy businessman (played by Antonio Banderas) who orders off for a mail-order bride who &quot;is not meant to be beautiful&quot; but rather, &quot;loyal, loving, and young enough to bear children.&quot;  What he gets is Angelina Jolie, and though she isn't what he expected or claimed he wanted, he graciously decides to marry her anyway (I bet that was a tough choice).  I'm not giving anything away by telling you that Jolie totally screws up Banderas' life, stealing his fortune and causing him to lose his prestigious position.Ok, so the plot of a woman whose sexuality is so strong that it causes a man to destroy his life isn't anything new.  But what makes this movie interesting is that it highlights the extreme vulnerablity of men.  Banderas' character is constantly willing to forgive Jolie's, not because of some crude lustful desire, but out of a sincere love and acceptance for Jolie's character.  Jolie's character is absolutely foul, and everybody in the film understands that, this makes the willingness for acceptance shown by the cuckolded Banderas oddly touching.  In a way, this film takes the old belief that love is essentially acceptance and forgiveness and takes it to such an extreme as to be totally absurd.  But if you're willing to go with it, the film is quite interesting.In order for the film to work at all, there must be some sort of explination for Jolie's character, Bonnie.  She must be essentially good, but forced, somehow, to perform evil.  This difficulty is handled with the introduction of Billy.  Billy is essentially Bonnie's pimp and is able to exert an iron hold on her emotions.  Their relationship is quite similar to that shown between Sharon Stone and James Woods in &quot;Casino.&quot;  It seems quite clear that our society believes that women are inherently vulnerable to decietful males.  The prevalence of deadbeat dads seems to bear this out, but for the sake of maintaining a more equal view of gender, perhaps it should be suggested that this is just a male fantasy.  However, even as a fantasy,this idea has some revelance and social impact that should be explored.  The main question it raises is: if women are suceptible to these adverse influences, how can you pry them away?  Real love should be the answer, but &quot;Original Sin&quot; suggests that any woman actually in this position would be leary enough of lies in the disguise of real love to disregard love if it ever did turn up.It is an interesting question, and it was totally surprising to see it dealt with so deftly in a movie such as this.  Granted, there are many things that are terrible about this film.  Many of the scenes go on too long and seem redundant or ridiculous.  However, both Banderas and Jolie are superb and you can't help but be drawn in.  In the end, you find yourself thinking about this movie a lot more than you ever anticipated you would.  It is a pleasant surprise and that alone makes it worth taking a look at.",3,Surprising!,998092800,"08 18, 2001",2001,3431,"['movie', 'out', 'terrible', 'made', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'amazingly', 'get', 'better', 'up', 'interesting', 'new', 'take', 'femme', 'fatale', 'archetype', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'believe', 'well', 'plot', 'could', 'yield', 'knew', 'ideas', 'yet', 'film', 'make', 'interesting', 'reversal', 'theme', 'reflection', 'social', 'change', 'regards', 'role', 'women', 'men', 'society.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'centers', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'played', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'who', 'orders', 'off', 'mail-order', 'bride', 'who', 'quot', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'beautiful', 'quot', 'rather', 'quot', 'loving', 'young', 'enough', 'bear', 'children.', 'quot', 'What', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'claimed', 'wanted', 'graciously', 'marry', 'anyway', 'bet', 'was', 'tough', 'choice', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'telling', 'Jolie', 'totally', 'up', 'Banderas', 'life', 'stealing', 'fortune', 'causing', 'lose', 'prestigious', 'position.Ok', 'plot', 'woman', 'sexuality', 'so', 'strong', 'man', 'destroy', 'life', ""n't"", 'anything', 'new', 'what', 'movie', 'interesting', 'extreme', 'vulnerablity', 'men', 'Banderas', 'character', 'constantly', 'willing', 'forgive', 'Jolie', 'not', 'crude', 'lustful', 'desire', 'sincere', 'love', 'acceptance', 'Jolie', 'character', 'Jolie', 'character', 'absolutely', 'foul', 'everybody', 'film', 'willingness', 'acceptance', 'shown', 'cuckolded', 'Banderas', 'oddly', 'touching', 'way', 'film', 'old', 'belief', 'love', 'essentially', 'acceptance', 'forgiveness', 'extreme', 'be', 'totally', 'absurd', ""'re"", 'willing', 'go', 'film', 'quite', 'interesting.In', 'order', 'film', 'work', 'must', 'be', 'sort', 'explination', 'Jolie', 'character', 'Bonnie', 'must', 'be', 'essentially', 'good', 'forced', 'somehow', 'perform', 'evil', 'difficulty', 'handled', 'introduction', 'Billy', 'Billy', 'essentially', 'Bonnie', 'pimp', 'able', 'exert', 'iron', 'hold', 'emotions', 'relationship', 'quite', 'similar', 'shown', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'James', 'Woods', 'quot', 'Casino.', 'quot', 'quite', 'clear', 'society', 'women', 'are', 'inherently', 'vulnerable', 'decietful', 'males', 'prevalence', 'deadbeat', 'dads', 'bear', 'out', 'sake', 'maintaining', 'more', 'equal', 'view', 'gender', 'perhaps', 'should', 'be', 'suggested', 'just', 'male', 'fantasy', 'However', 'even', 'fantasy', 'idea', 'revelance', 'social', 'impact', 'should', 'be', 'explored', 'main', 'question', 'women', 'are', 'suceptible', 'adverse', 'influences', 'how', 'can', 'pry', 'away', 'Real', 'love', 'should', 'be', 'answer', 'quot', 'Original', 'Sin', 'quot', 'woman', 'actually', 'position', 'would', 'be', 'leary', 'enough', 'lies', 'disguise', 'real', 'love', 'disregard', 'love', 'ever', 'did', 'turn', 'up.It', 'interesting', 'question', 'was', 'totally', 'surprising', 'see', 'dealt', 'so', 'deftly', 'movie', 'such', 'Granted', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'terrible', 'film', 'Many', 'scenes', 'go', 'too', 'long', 'seem', 'redundant', 'ridiculous', 'However', 'Banderas', 'Jolie', 'are', 'superb', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'drawn', 'end', 'find', 'thinking', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'anticipated', 'would', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'alone', 'worth', 'taking', 'look']",N/A

687650,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00005V4XU,D. Litton,"[15, 22]","&quot;Original Sin&quot; is a daring but unsuccessful attempt at an erotic thriller, baring Angelina Jolie's bust but never bearing a soul worth caring about. Actors Jolie and Antonio Banderas are in fine form, and just to see them act together is worth it, even if their talents are cast into a lost cause.The writer and director of the film, Michael Christofer, gives the film two different complexes. One makes the film look like an honest effort on his part to make a movie that reveals too many of its secrets work. The other makes it look like one of those skin flicks that one can easily find on Cinemax in the early hours before dawn, only given an A-list cast and Hollywood gloss.The film stars Banderas as Luis Durand, a rich coffee mill owner who is looking for a woman to be his wife, bear him children, and be kind and loyal. He's not interested in love, though his head certainly turns when he meets the woman he has sent for, Julia Russell, played by the overly busty Jolie. She provides simple explanations for why she did not write to him, and why the photograph he received looks nothing like her.They waste no time in getting married, then taking their time to get to know one another. He gives her full access to his bank accounts, his house, and his love, which is sullied when she runs away, his money in hand. What she leaves behind is a trunk with the real Julia Russell's belongings inside, and feelings of betrayal and rage in Luis's heart.Up to this point, the movie has built up some momentum. A scene involving Julia's sister protesting that the handwriting in Julia's letter is not that of her sister's has some impact an the opener for Luis's realization that Julia is not really Julia at all. And, despite what the critics will say, Jolie and Banderas do have some chemistry onscreen, more so in scenes that do not involve sex.The movie is bold in giving us such a vivid depiction of sexual activity, however softcore it is, but in doing this, it causes the audience to lose interest in the rest of the story. Not only were people in the audience snickering during these scenes, but they really do not fit into the big picture. We know they are in love, so what is the purpose of scenes such as this?As the film moves on, it begins to trip on itself. Luis hunts and reclaims Julia, and they reconcile their differences. When a rather mysterious detective comes into play (played by Thomas Jane), Luis shoots him, and the story turns into Bonnie and Clyde (incidentally, Julia's real name in the film is Bonnie). They go on the run, still being chased by the detective who is still alive and meeting Julia in secret to discuss Luis's financial ruin and timely death.Truth is, the movie is just not that interesting. The beginning is not too bad, but the second half of the film is unbelievable, contrived, and listless. Luis wants her back because he is so consumed by his love for her, which would be convincing if the movie did not play him to be a whining martyr. He has force in the beginning, but as the movie wears out its welcome, he becomes little more than putty in Julia's hands.The ending is also a complete betrayal of what the movie has been trying to prove all along. In the beginning narration, it is said that &quot;this is not a story about love, but about the power it holds over people.&quot; The movie gets the power point right, yes, but in the end, the love aspect of that speech finds its way into the picture, throwing us for a loop when our predictions were centered on an unhappy ending.Watching &quot;Original Sin&quot; reminded me of such movies as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Beholder,&quot; two movies that were given harsh reviews as well. &quot;Letter&quot; worked for me because, despite the fact that it strayed from the novel, the story was still enjoyable. &quot;Beholder&quot; was a nice unconventional film to watch, with superb lead performances. &quot;Original Sin&quot; is unconventional, and has good acting, but somewhere along the line, it fails to hold any interest as it dwindles down.",2,Shamelessly bares its actors but woefully bears no soul.,997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,4086,"['quot', 'Original', 'Sin', 'quot', 'daring', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'baring', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'bust', 'never', 'bearing', 'soul', 'caring', 'about', 'Actors', 'Jolie', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'just', 'see', 'act', 'together', 'even', 'talents', 'are', 'cast', 'lost', 'cause.The', 'writer', 'director', 'film', 'Michael', 'Christofer', 'film', 'two', 'different', 'complexes', 'One', 'film', 'look', 'honest', 'effort', 'part', 'make', 'movie', 'reveals', 'too', 'many', 'secrets', 'work', 'other', 'look', 'one', 'skin', 'flicks', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'find', 'Cinemax', 'early', 'hours', 'dawn', 'only', 'given', 'A-list', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'gloss.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Banderas', 'Luis', 'Durand', 'rich', 'coffee', 'mill', 'owner', 'who', 'looking', 'woman', 'be', 'wife', 'bear', 'children', 'be', 'kind', 'loyal', 'not', 'interested', 'love', 'head', 'certainly', 'when', 'woman', 'sent', 'Julia', 'Russell', 'played', 'overly', 'busty', 'Jolie', 'simple', 'explanations', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'why', 'photograph', 'received', 'nothing', 'her.They', 'waste', 'time', 'getting', 'married', 'then', 'taking', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'full', 'access', 'bank', 'accounts', 'house', 'love', 'sullied', 'when', 'away', 'money', 'hand', 'What', 'behind', 'trunk', 'real', 'Julia', 'Russell', 'belongings', 'feelings', 'betrayal', 'rage', 'Luis', 'heart.Up', 'point', 'movie', 'built', 'up', 'momentum', 'scene', 'involving', 'Julia', 'sister', 'protesting', 'handwriting', 'Julia', 'letter', 'not', 'sister', 'impact', 'opener', 'Luis', 'realization', 'Julia', 'not', 'really', 'Julia', 'what', 'critics', 'will', 'say', 'Jolie', 'Banderas', 'do', 'have', 'chemistry', 'onscreen', 'more', 'so', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'involve', 'sex.The', 'movie', 'bold', 'giving', 'such', 'vivid', 'depiction', 'sexual', 'activity', 'however', 'softcore', 'doing', 'audience', 'lose', 'interest', 'rest', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'people', 'audience', 'snickering', 'scenes', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'big', 'picture', 'know', 'are', 'love', 'what', 'purpose', 'scenes', 'such', 'film', 'moves', 'trip', 'Luis', 'hunts', 'reclaims', 'Julia', 'reconcile', 'differences', 'When', 'rather', 'mysterious', 'detective', 'play', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Luis', 'shoots', 'story', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'incidentally', 'Julia', 'real', 'name', 'film', 'Bonnie', 'go', 'run', 'still', 'being', 'chased', 'detective', 'who', 'still', 'alive', 'meeting', 'Julia', 'secret', 'discuss', 'Luis', 'financial', 'ruin', 'timely', 'death.Truth', 'movie', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'unbelievable', 'contrived', 'listless', 'Luis', 'back', 'so', 'consumed', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'convincing', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'be', 'whining', 'martyr', 'force', 'beginning', 'movie', 'out', 'welcome', 'little', 'more', 'putty', 'Julia', 'hands.The', 'ending', 'also', 'complete', 'betrayal', 'what', 'movie', 'been', 'trying', 'prove', 'along', 'beginning', 'narration', 'said', 'quot', 'not', 'story', 'love', 'power', 'people.', 'quot', 'movie', 'power', 'point', 'right', 'yes', 'end', 'love', 'aspect', 'speech', 'way', 'picture', 'throwing', 'loop', 'when', 'predictions', 'were', 'centered', 'unhappy', 'ending.Watching', 'quot', 'Original', 'Sin', 'quot', 'reminded', 'such', 'movies', 'quot', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'quot', 'quot', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'quot', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'given', 'harsh', 'reviews', 'as', 'well', 'quot', 'Letter', 'quot', 'worked', 'fact', 'strayed', 'novel', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'quot', 'Beholder', 'quot', 'was', 'nice', 'unconventional', 'film', 'watch', 'superb', 'lead', 'performances', 'quot', 'Original', 'Sin', 'quot', 'unconventional', 'good', 'acting', 'somewhere', 'line', 'hold', 'interest', 'down']",N/A

687653,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005V4XU,Eric,"[15, 20]","Ah, the erotic thriller, a genre that now mostly exists in the form of straight-to-video or made-for-cable TV release.  But there are always the occasional theatrical releases, such as Basic Instinct (great sex scenes, sporadically interesting story), Bound (steamy sex scenes, good plot, Jennifer Tilly is annoying as hell), Wild Things (dull sex scenes, fun plot twists), and Color of Night (ludicrous story, but features one of the best sex scenes in mainstream cinema!).  Original Sin can be added to the list, but it's easily the worst of this lot, giving us two stars who generate no heat and a story that isn't ridiculously convoluted enought to be trashy fun.  Really, this movie's all talk, without enough genuine passion, suspense, and not enough bare skin (and I saw the unrated version).Antonio Banderas stars as an incredibly dumb coffee mill owner who's just been arranged to meet his mail-order bride.  He's written letters to her and has seen some pictures of her, but when he meets her face-to-face, she's nothing like he expects.  This bride turns out to be Angelina Jolie, whose sensuous looks and curves captivates our protagonist.  It seems she sent a different picture of herself so that a man won't be looking to marry her for her looks.  What a great, deceptive start to their marriage. Oh, yes, their marriage is bliss, as they continously make love and declare their love for one another.  But then it turns out she actually isn't his mail-order bride; she's taken all his money, leaving poor Banderas heart-broken and dead-set to find her.  Enter Thomas Jane, whose role is obvious from the start to any semi-keen viewer.Original Sin is the kind of film that will probably have your eyes rolling from all the overdone dialogue (""Can't you see I cannot...LIVE without you?!) and squirming in your seat as you wait for something important to happen.  Story-wise, well, you'd be surprised how little plot there is.  Aside from what I've described, there's hardly anything else to be mentioned.  None of the plot twists are surprising or even amusingly over-the-top, so you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet out of boredom.This might have been a somewhat engaging venture if I cared about the situation and the characters, but no, Banderas' is too gullible to root for and Jolie is...well...I've honestly never much liked Jolie; she's always one-note with her performances and her huge lips and really creepy resemblance to Jon Voight (her dad) is a distraction that not even decent acting (which she doesn't even qualify for) can account for.  The fact that both actors (as well as Thomas Jane) don't even seem to realize they're starring in such a trashy film only damages the film further.  They take this material waaayyy too seriously.The only thing worthy of note in this entire film is a somewhat graphic sex scene between Banderas and Jolie.  Cinema these days has grown rather tame with on-screen sex, so I guess it's nice to see nudity on display in a big-studio release (though, make no mistake, even unrated, this scene is still not as graphic or even as well-directed as the sex scenes in Color of Night or Basic Instinct).

Julia skips town with a bunch of Luis' cash and for the rest of the film, Luis follows her around like a lovesick lap dog begging her to take him back and abuse him some more.

The viewer comes away without being able to identify with either character.  Luis is so pathetic that we can feel only disgust and lack of respect for all his groveling, and Julia is so callous and wicked that no amount of attractiveness can overcome the revulsion she elicits.This film is a dreadful waste of talent.

The plot holds promise as the audience is slowly drawn into the seductive world of early 1900's Cuba, each image lush as it exploits the tropic clime in which the movie is set. The sun gleaming brightly as Luis rushes towards the docks to meet his mail order bride to be. Each second passes interminably, as the film tries to build tension, as Luis searches for his bride to be, before he finally finds Julia amongst the many travelers. Enchanted by the unexpected beauty Luis finds himself immersed in a web of intrigue, lies, and obsession as he follows where his heart takes him.The Premise of 'Original Sin' IS interesting. How far would you go for love? When does love become obsession? However the questions remain up in the air as the actors go through the motions in a somewhat mechanical manner as the plot of this 'thriller' twists and turns rather predictably.The love scenes added little to the overall plot of the movie, even if they were mildly entertaining in their own right. I've read criticisms of the nude love scenes in this movie and unless you are the type of prude who gets upset at the sight of naked cats and dogs which roam the streets and are unable to order chicken breasts in a fast food place because it sounds naughty, you won't find it offensive.There were only two things memorable about the movie: 1.) The Cinematography, served to enhance so/so performances and created a beautiful yet sometimes dark setting. 2.) Jolie's performance in a single scene near the end of the movie.Other than that 'Original Sin' is an average movie that is sexy and suspenseful.

687679,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005V4XU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 9]","""Original Sin"" is based on the novel ""Waltz into Darkness"" by Cornell Woolrich (1903-1968), whose story ""It Had to Be Murder"" was made into the classic 1954 Alfred Hitchcock film ""Rear Window.""  Waiting until 2001 to turn this particular novel into an American movie starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie has a couple of interesting impacts (the book was filed as ""La Sir&egrave;ne du Mississipi"" by Francois Truffaut in 1969 with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Catherine Deneuve).  The first is that the unrated version of ""Original Sin"" available on DVD is able to have nude scenes featuring the two stars.  The second, and I was dare say more important difference, is that director Michael Cristofer, who also did the film's screenplay, released his film to an audience that was weaned on films like ""The Sting"" and have had their suspicions raised to red level by ""The Usual Suspects"" and other films in that mode.It is clear from the start that there are trust issues with this story.  Jolie first appears as a woman in prison who is facing execution by garroting in a particularly wicked looking chair.  She is telling her story to a priest (confession seems too strong a word to describe her narrative).  Our assumption is that she must have committed murder to deserve such a fate, and so the story begins.  Luis Vargas (Banderas) is the rich co-owner of a coffee plantation on Cuba around the previous turn of the century.  For reasons that would certainly belie the actor's good looks his character has sent away for a bride from the United States.  He shows her photograph to his friends; his intended is rather plain looking, but his goal is to find someone who is kind, true, and young enough to bear children.  Neither her being beautiful nor him being in love is part of the plan.But then Julia Russell (Jolie) shows up and clearly has lied about her looks.  She does not want to wanted for her pretty face and it seems clear she has a past she is trying to get away from if not hide outright.  Luis confesses that he has lied as well, hiding the fact of his wealth.  This leads Julia to conclude that these two strangers who are about to be married in a few hour's time have at least one thing in common: ""Neither one of us can be trusted.""  Luis might not believe her, but we certainly do.  They marry and if there is not love between them the sex seems to be really great.  But then there are uneasy letters from Julia's sister and then an American private investigator, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), arrives in Cuba, hired to find out what is really happening to Julia.The good news is that no matter how suspicious you are about what is happening in this movie, you are never going to figure out the ending.  You might stumble on it, but it will be the result of blind luck rather than reasoned formulations.  There is an inherent ambiguity to both the characters and their actions, and if you told me that Cristofer had purposefully made sure all of the scenes could be read in opposite directions I would not be surprised.  At some point you will learn not to be surprised by what is happening and then it becomes a question of how far the momentum of the plot twists will take you.However, the bad news is finding a character to root for as this game plays itself out.  Luis should be the obvious choice, but you can get weary trying to decide if he is in love or just trying to get revenge.  Besides, there is something pathetic about this rich and handsome man intending to buy himself a homely bride.  When he realizes he has been stupid and keeps on doing stupid things, Luis becomes an even more pathetic figure.  There is a limit as to how stupid the hero gets to be in a movie such as this one.  This story would work a lot better if the leading man were not so much more better looking than the leading woman.  But then when they look at each other each has the same reason to like what they see.  Still, the dynamic bothers me at times.We are told that this is not a love story, but rather a story about love.  But that is no more of a trustworthy comment that anything else we hear in this film.  Ultimately, I come to the sad conclusion that the sex scenes were probably the best part of this film.  At the end, when all the twists are out in the open and I think back on what the final revelation means for every thing up to that point, I still cannot connect all of the dots and have it make sense.  It is like the payoff exists despite the setup and not because of it.  Or, to put it another way, the tricks of all the plot twists are not up to the treat of the sex scenes.

He's a wealthy landowner who has sent away for a plain Jane mail order bride.  Much to his surprise, the woman that steps off the ship is Jolie, a real babe.  There is an immediate attraction and soon they are married, having a great time with each other with lots of romantic scenes.  This is soon to end, however, when he discovers that she has deceived him.  The woman he was supposed to marry has disappeared.  And who, exactly is this beautiful creature who fate has brought to his door?  This is just the first half hour of the film, however, and from here on there are ups and downs and lots of deceptions.  The man is smitten and Jolie has him wrapped around her finger.  The plot thickens.I've never thought much of Jolie as an actress.  That is why she is so perfect for this part.  She's supposed to play a ""bad"" actress, and the role calls for a lot of ""over-acting"".  This made me enjoy her performance.  And she also wears beautiful clothes and is a pleasure to look at.  Antonio Banderas is completely believable as the man who she makes jump through hoops.  But he doesn't really get much sympathy because he lets her do it to him.  And, in a funny way, it is Jolie who I wound up empathizing with.  She's cast as a survivor and it's a good role.There is certainly too much melodrama in the production.

The actors have a real chemistry, it can be seen whenever they look at each other and in the famous sensual scenes. Julia has a mysterious past and constant nightmares trouble her.

But it was actually a pretty good movie, an almost Hitchcockian film, almost as good as the Talented Mr. Ripley.Sure, there's sex in it. You see a lot of Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas, as well as other people. But there's a story beneath all of it, and it's an intriguing movie even without the sex scenes. Jolie plays Jane Russell, who marries a Cuban coffee plantation owner named Luis Vargas through mail order--except only when they finally meet does he learn that she's beautiful and she learns that he is rich. However, Luis begins to discover that his bride has lied about more than her beauty, though he cannot stop loving her even as she deceives him.Banderas and Jolie are very good actors, and are very convincing together. The sets and scenery of colonial Cuba are elegantly done, and the music is both atmospheric and sultry. But it's far from perfect.

687692,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00005V4XU,Matthew Gladney,"[11, 13]","'Original Sin' is a rather well-done film. It has moments of bland dialogue, the sex scenes are a tad corny (because they try so hard to be passionate), but all in all, for other reasons, it is quite a twisting and turning little erotic thriller.Antonio Banderas stars as Luis, and Angelina Jolie (looking exceptionally beautiful here) stars as Julia Russell. Luis is a coffee plantation owner, and is in need of a wife who is &quot;young&quot; and can &quot;bear his children&quot;. The movie takes place some 100 years in the past, down in South America, so this somewhat crude need of his is acceptable. Julia is the American woman who has traveled down to meet him and to become his wife. They have only seen pictures of one another. Upon her arrival, Julia does not match her picture, and admits to having sent a false photo, so as not to be involved with a man who &quot;only desires a pretty face.&quot; Luis admits to his own fib - he had told her through correspondence that he *worked* at the plantation, not that he *owned* it, so as to ward-off any prospective gold diggers. These deceptions only begin to reveal the lies and twisted desires that are to come later in the film. It really does interest you, keeping you on your toes, even if some of the &quot;surprises&quot; are somewhat easy to see coming.The acting in 'Original Sin' really hits the mark. Antonio Banderas is fine as the subtle and sympathetic Luis. Angelina Jolie continues to grow into a sturdy and mature actress. Thomas Jane, who plays a sinister private detective, also shines in his performance. The locales (including two cities in Cuba during Carnival season) make for rich scenery, and the story does take quite a few turns, always making it engaging. The directing is also interesting, as it makes good use of inventive quick-cut edits. There is quite a bit of eroticism and nudity, as this is most definitely an adult film (R rating).The ending of 'Original Sin' was, I thought, a little weak, but it still wasn't enough to detract from its overall strength. The story is adapted from a novel by famed author Cornell Woolrich (whom Alfred Hitchcock loved), thus a trusty blueprint was there to start with. The story isn't really all that spectacular - many &quot;thrillers&quot; have come before it where the plot twists, characters are not revealing the entire truth, and there's always a sap to feel sympathy toward.

687695,AUZR3D51MOQ3A,B00005V4XU,Mel,"[0, 0]","This is a story about love,  as Bonny Castle would say.  It's a story about a man and a woman from two different worlds,  who come together in marriage,  and find out what it really means to be one.Some would say this is a movie about a con artist who screwed her husband over.  A con artist who was unworthy of the man she married.  They might say she made her husband look like a fool.  But truly,  it is the con artist who is the fool,  who managed to con herself into believing she could be nothing but the lowest of the low, even when the best was given to her.In both characters we see what could be seen as unconventional,  cynical standards.  Luis expected a homely, simple wife,  not even expecting love.  Bonny expected money,  not expecting a husband that would accept her for all her flaws and help her fight her demons.  The moral of this story could perhaps be that if a couple is willing,  they can overcome obstacles in their lives and grow by marriage.  But of course,  there are always con artists in the real world who are just evil and cannot be helped.I would go as far as to say that Billy is the movie's evil.  Billy offers everyone help, at a price.  He does not advise on what is best for everyone,  but what is essentially best for him.  He uses Luis in every way but makes himself out to be a friendly ally.  He does all he can to keep Bonny within her own limitations,  which really just become the limitations set by Billy.  The scratches almost like a marking on her very soul, as if to say her soul is his.Rounding up,  I'll give this a 5 star review.  I almost gave it 4 stars because the casing did not have any of those inserts that I like to read and look at.  Bought this for around $9,  which is excellent for a blue-ray price.

Banderas is looking for an heir not a mate, per se but Jolie has other things in mind i.e basically to win Banderas over and steal his money. But instead she falls in love with him...or does she? Cristopher sets up a portent tropical milieu filled with bananas, coffee and mosquito netting where the humidity and sexual attraction is so thick you could cut it with a knife. There are several plot twists that lead to deception and betrayal that require a lot of suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part to swallow and much of this works. Cristopher tries to do it all in the high style of the late 50's potboilers like &quot;The Long Hot Summer&quot; or &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; and almost succeeds.

(think: Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).  A woman decieves a man, the man falls in love with her, and in the end... the woman realizes that she loves him back... blah blah.HOWEVER, the visuals in this movie are incredible.  The costumes, the scenery, Angelina's hair-do's, etc. are just absolutely breath-taking.

687710,AMZYAGVDQWTS,B00005V4XU,Reviews No More,"[16, 27]","Antonio Banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can't believe he ever got wealthy when he's running around giving money freely to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who lied to him from the moment they met.  She didn't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry.  Well, we never get to see the pretty girl, because Jolie must have killed her too.  The only reason this woman is ""hot"" is because she'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody (if you've seen Gia, you'll know what I mean).  Neither she or Banderas (who isn't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her.  My guess?  The age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie gets old fast.  It's so stupid, because nobody has interludes like that unless they're shooting a blue movie.  The only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot.You can see right through this silly waste of two hours you'll never get back:  this adaptation from Waltz into Darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more.  This movie is as bad as Showgirls and one star less than Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, because at least Beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way.  Not only is their relationship devoid of any true sense of love, but you also get this overwhelming desire to see creepy, unconvincing Billy (played horribly by Thomas Jane) get the girl.  Billy?  What a stupid name for a bad guy, but I guess it wouldn't make a difference even if his name was Ralph or Percival.Early on in the movie, the so-called beauty Julia/Bonnie/I forget what else--wants to see a really bad theater group, and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented.  My thoughts about Original Sin exactly.  The plot is stupid, and the dialogue is so bad it's over the top.  In the end, the movie makes absolutely no sense, and you wish you would get a payoff, but you don't.  The rat poison doesn't do its job, and neither does the executioner.  All I really am sure of is that, with all the rape scenes that Jolie's horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who's asking for it constantly, that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender, and I'm not even a feminist!  As for studmuffin Banderas?  He really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in Problem Child with John Ritter.

Antonio Bandaras makes his character three dimensional. Angelina Jolie is given less to work with, and we never quite understand her character but that doesn't take from her charm as the protagonist.All that is fine and dandy, but something big is missing from the overall feel of the film. The color tone through out is semi-sepia, which gives it a tinge of brownish orange -- quite irritating if you know that the real Spain could have been spectacular on screen anyway! The camerawork is quaky at times, which I found rather distracting, and the same goes for the pieces of soft porn thrown in, replete with predictable and occasionally even corny dialogue.Nonetheless, the movie progresses into a good plot, until an almost unprecedented fantastically dramatic ending. Which is great!Problem? Even though the end had come, and gone, the movie went on. What should have been an awesome dramatic ending was lurched 180 around towards what can only be described as a Hollywoodesque denouement.

Okay, so I admit-I'm an Angelina Jolie junkie. But that's beside the point.The plot of ""Original Sin"" isn't too original. Wealthy Cuban landowner Antonio Banderas buys a mail-order bride (Jolie) and gets a little more than he bargained for. Not only is his bride-to-be more beautiful than the photo she sent, she is quite the cat in bed. Not exactly the demur Virginia schoolteacher she professed to be.Following the typical Hollywood ""stupid male"" syndrome, Banderas signs over access to his fortune to his new bride, only to find she has absconded with his money. Not only does Banderas go off half-cocked in search of Jolie, but when he finds her, he only wishes to bed her, not concerned his fortune is gone. A bit too unrealistic here, considering Banderas was homicidal and violent only minutes earlier. Of course, Jolie is also following the Hollywood stereotype of female characters that fall in love with men who wish to kill them.Thomas Jane adds an exciting dimension to the movie as the psychotic sidekick of Jolie, although their relationship isn't quite defined, nor explained. The ""spit in the mouth"" routine was quite disgusting and could have been left out with no detrimental affects to the movie.In all, if you wish to see a lot of Angelina Jolie naked, this is the movie for you, although the flapping breast image was a bit much.

Luis Vargas, a rich plantation owner in Cuba, has sent away for a mail-order bride from America.  When she arrives, he instantly falls in love with her.  At first, their relationship seems to be going along fine, but things begin to change.  His wife, Julia, runs away with all his money after he added her name to his account.  The rest of the movie follows Luis as he tries to find her again as he chases her across Cuba.  This movie isn't as bad as some people made it out to be although it isn't a great movie.  It is beautifully shot with plenty of fantastic settings and lush colors.  There is a couple graphic sex scenes with plenty of nudity so be forewarned.  This is an enjoyable movie that is at least worth a watch.Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie are very good as the recently married couple, Luis Vargas and Julia Russell.  Their relationship is very believable as Luis falls madly in love with his new bride.  Thomas Jane is very good in a creepy role as Detective Walter Downs who is investigating something about Julia's past.  The Unrated Edition DVD offers widescreen presentation, director's commentary, a Gloria Estefan music video, an animated photo gallery, and two theatrical trailers.

687725,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005V4XU,Tsuyoshi,"[76, 81]","Though ""Original Sin"" received coldest reviews from critics, I enjoyed watching it, and really love that film.  We got gorgeous Angelina Jolie and sexy Antonio Banderas, and what do we expect more?  Yes, the story is ridiculous, I admit, but the classic noir ""Double Indenmity"" has also a very far-fetched story that would easily match that of this film.  Some point out that there already has been a French version of the story in ""Mississipi Mermaid"" directed by Truffaut, claiming ""Original Sin"" is just another Hollywood-made trash  remake, but Truffaut's one is not among his best works in spite of two French icons Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo.Simply put, ""Original Sin"" is about love.  Lots of love.  The film is set in the 19th century, Cuba.  Antonio made success with coffee trade, and receives a mail-ordered bride, Angelina.  They soon marry, and love each other, but she suddenly disappears with all his money.  Enraged Antonio traces her to Havana, where he finds out Angelina, now with a different beau.  Instead of killing her, he loves her again.  No, he makes love much, much, again.  But she has a secret, for which she suffers....  Nothing should be said about the latter half of the film (which completely differs from Truffaut's rather somber version) except that the ever winding story goes like Mulholland Drive.The suspense element is too thin and the whole storyline is too incredible to take seriously, but the film somehow succeeds on one level, that is, descriptions of illogically passionate love between two leads, whose emotions flare up with enough chemistry to convince that they (actors) really mean it.  Antonio, first trying to take back money, soon decides to give everything; Angelina, first trying to deceive him, soon gives up herself.  I don't know how American audiences reacted to this illogical behaviors -- some have said it's stupid, yes, I understand -- but I, a Japanese, somehow find myself drawn deeply into their emotional relations.  After all, love is what makes people ridiculous, isn't it?  If so, they are very credible, I believe.Everyone would agree that the production design is fine, and costume (of Angelina Jolie, especially) is delightful to look at.  (It was actually shot in Mexico; imagine wearing a suit there.)  Good photography makes up for perhaps unnecessary plot twist at the end.  Campy, you might say.  But as a ""Woman of Fate"" Angelina Jolie is perfect, and I am not the only one who would give everything to her -- and you too, Billy Bob?",4,"There's No Shame in Saying That ""I Love This Film.""",1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,2527,"['Original', 'Sin', 'received', 'coldest', 'reviews', 'critics', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'got', 'gorgeous', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'sexy', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'more', 'Yes', 'story', 'ridiculous', 'admit', 'classic', 'noir', 'Double', 'Indenmity', 'also', 'very', 'far-fetched', 'story', 'would', 'easily', 'match', 'film', 'point', 'out', 'already', 'been', 'French', 'version', 'story', 'Mississipi', 'Mermaid', 'directed', 'Truffaut', 'claiming', 'Original', 'Sin', 'just', 'Hollywood-made', 'trash', 'remake', 'Truffaut', 'one', 'not', 'best', 'works', 'spite', 'two', 'French', 'icons', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'Jean-Paul', 'Belmondo.Simply', 'put', 'Original', 'Sin', 'love', 'Lots', 'love', 'film', 'set', '19th', 'century', 'Cuba', 'Antonio', 'made', 'success', 'coffee', 'trade', 'mail-ordered', 'bride', 'Angelina', 'soon', 'marry', 'love', 'other', 'suddenly', 'money', 'Enraged', 'Antonio', 'Havana', 'where', 'out', 'Angelina', 'now', 'different', 'beau', 'Instead', 'killing', 'again', 'No', 'love', 'much', 'much', 'again', 'secret', 'Nothing', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'completely', 'differs', 'Truffaut', 'rather', 'somber', 'version', 'ever', 'winding', 'story', 'Mulholland', 'Drive.The', 'suspense', 'element', 'too', 'thin', 'whole', 'storyline', 'too', 'incredible', 'take', 'seriously', 'film', 'somehow', 'one', 'level', 'descriptions', 'illogically', 'passionate', 'love', 'two', 'leads', 'emotions', 'flare', 'up', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'convince', 'actors', 'really', 'mean', 'Antonio', 'first', 'trying', 'take', 'back', 'money', 'soon', 'give', 'everything', 'Angelina', 'first', 'trying', 'deceive', 'soon', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'American', 'audiences', 'reacted', 'illogical', 'behaviors', 'have', 'said', 'stupid', 'yes', 'understand', 'Japanese', 'somehow', 'find', 'drawn', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'relations', 'love', 'what', 'people', 'ridiculous', ""n't"", 'so', 'are', 'very', 'credible', 'believe.Everyone', 'would', 'agree', 'production', 'design', 'fine', 'costume', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'especially', 'delightful', 'look', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'Mexico', 'imagine', 'wearing', 'suit', 'there', 'Good', 'photography', 'up', 'perhaps', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'Campy', 'might', 'say', 'Woman', 'Fate', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'perfect', 'am', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'give', 'everything', 'too', 'Billy', 'Bob']",N/A

It is dark and takes somewhat unreasonable twists. I was not that thrilled about the camera work. I think the movie was made by the same director who made &quot;Gia,&quot; but in this case some scenes made my head spin because of the merry-go-round approach of the director. The camera simply twirled a bit too much. I liked Angelia Jolie's performance a lot and wish the critics would get off her back. However, this film feels a little like three films spliced together. The first is a story of a mail-order bride who may not be who she says she is. The second is a stroy of love and (mis)trust. And the third is a dramatic finale. I feel that each of these parts is somehow autonomous and does not need the others to entertain or make a point. I am not sure whose fault this is. I liked the end of this movie, even though as some reviewers have pointed out, it does not quite fit into the atmosphere of the rest of the picture. But perhaps this is the point--love outlives betrayal, obsession, financial catastrophy, and other disasters.
