416920,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304366051,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Melodramatic to a major fault, `Raintree County' tries really hard to be the second coming of `Gone With the Wind' and winds up failing so miserably it was almost painful to endure.  With lavish sets and beautiful cinematography and costumes galore, you'd think this well-known period piece would hold up today, especially when you factor in the film's two stars, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift.  Well, I'm not sure what Oscar voters were drinking back in 1957, but Taylor's wretched performance may be the lowlight of her career (and this is coming from a man who considered her one of the finest actresses of any generation), and the overall scope of this tragically campy soap opera is so brutally nonsensical that one can't help but cringe at the very thought of it.Maybe it deserves an extra star for entertaining me with all its unintentional humor.I'm being harsh, possibly too harsh, but I digress; does this film really deserve anything more?  I mean, the story itself had promise and yet the desire to oversell everything to the point of creating a farce is almost too much to bear.  The character development, outside of that done by the magnetic Eva Marie Saint, was so minimal I felt like I knew nothing of why these characters didn't just off one another the first chance they got.  With such a vapid love story centering around two barely interesting individuals, this film was already on shaky ground.  Susanna Drake is an interesting sort, you know, once you factor in the fact that she's crazy, but Taylor's uneven accent is laughable and the way the plays into the melodramatic nature of the film is terribly sore.  John Shawnessy is a bore of a character and so Clift fares possibly worse than Taylor, since he near put me to sleep.I just didn't care about anyone.The pacing is also off-putting.  It isn't that it feels the whole of three hours, but it covers so much ground and jumps such large segments that one is left to fill in blanks that are not really hinted to and thus hampers the development of character in that respect as well.  I mean, with years in-between one is left bewildered at certain actions, especially those concerning Susanna, and the bafflement on John's face.  Like, shouldn't you have seen this coming, and then again how should we know because just thirty seconds ago your son was an infant and now he's like five years old.It's pretty, but it's also pretty vapid.",2,"Gone With the Wind, this is not...",1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,2420,"['Melodramatic', 'major', 'fault', 'Raintree', 'County', 'tries', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'second', 'coming', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'up', 'failing', 'so', 'miserably', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'endure', 'lavish', 'sets', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'galore', ""'d"", 'think', 'well-known', 'period', 'piece', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'especially', 'when', 'factor', 'film', 'two', 'stars', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Oscar', 'voters', 'were', 'drinking', 'back', '1957', 'Taylor', 'wretched', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'lowlight', 'career', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'considered', 'one', 'finest', 'actresses', 'generation', 'overall', 'scope', 'tragically', 'campy', 'soap', 'opera', 'so', 'brutally', 'nonsensical', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cringe', 'very', 'thought', 'it.Maybe', 'extra', 'star', 'entertaining', 'unintentional', 'humor.I', ""'m"", 'being', 'harsh', 'possibly', 'too', 'harsh', 'digress', 'film', 'really', 'deserve', 'anything', 'more', 'mean', 'story', 'had', 'promise', 'yet', 'desire', 'oversell', 'everything', 'point', 'creating', 'farce', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'bear', 'character', 'development', 'done', 'magnetic', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'was', 'so', 'minimal', 'felt', 'knew', 'nothing', 'why', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'off', 'one', 'first', 'chance', 'got', 'vapid', 'love', 'story', 'centering', 'around', 'two', 'barely', 'interesting', 'individuals', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'shaky', 'ground', 'Susanna', 'Drake', 'interesting', 'sort', 'know', 'once', 'factor', 'fact', 'crazy', 'Taylor', 'uneven', 'accent', 'laughable', 'way', 'plays', 'melodramatic', 'nature', 'film', 'terribly', 'sore', 'John', 'Shawnessy', 'bore', 'character', 'so', 'Clift', 'possibly', 'worse', 'Taylor', 'put', 'sleep.I', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'anyone.The', 'pacing', 'also', 'off-putting', ""n't"", 'whole', 'three', 'hours', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'jumps', 'such', 'large', 'segments', 'one', 'left', 'fill', 'blanks', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'hinted', 'thus', 'hampers', 'development', 'character', 'respect', 'as', 'well', 'mean', 'years', 'in-between', 'one', 'left', 'bewildered', 'certain', 'actions', 'especially', 'concerning', 'Susanna', 'bafflement', 'John', 'face', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'should', 'know', 'because', 'just', 'thirty', 'seconds', 'ago', 'son', 'was', 'infant', 'now', 'five', 'years', 'old.It', 'pretty', 'also', 'pretty', 'vapid']",Raintree County VHS

However, I still found it to be a pleasant movie to watch. The Southern Belle dresses were well done and the color is indeed vibrant. The men's clothing was not as well done as the women's, especially the military uniforms and I thought the actual War Between the States section of the movie was sped through. At the beginning we sense the war clouds looming and we are informed of its progress through the newspaper headlines, nonetheless, once it happens it seems over and done with too quickly. The love triangle is reminiscent of the War Between the States' epic &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; as we have Elizabeth Taylor in the role of the beautiful but dangerous Southern Belle, much like Scarlett O'Hara, and we have the local girl who, though lacking the looks of Olivia De Havilland, still comes across as similar simply because she is the more level headed of the two girls. The lead male character, as we are informed from the beginning is a dreamer and rather easily influenced by his less than desirable school teacher. His lack of assertiveness is part of what contributes to making the plot weak. However, it was nice to see how devoted he was to his literally insane wife even after all the hardships she put him through.

416926,A314TD4FRFA8BY,6304366051,David A. Kemp,"[1, 1]","MGM evidently envisioned this three-hour 1957 would-be Civil War epic as a next-generation Gone With the Wind, but its hopes were misplaced:  it's a grave disappointment.  Taylor hams it up as a tempestuous, manipulative, neurotic Southern belle (a kind of overwrought parody of Scarlett O'Hara).  Clift is stuck in the thankless role of bland straight man to whom things happen---whom other characters play off of.  Saint is the true-blue hometown gal who loves Clift, gets jilted, but perseveres to land her man in the end.  Marvin is a hard-drinking, two-fisted hellraiser.  British old pro Nigel Patrick steals his scenes as a flamboyant, lecherous schoolmaster and provides welcome diversion.  But he can't save this silly, ponderous, badly dated melodrama:  the sophomoric dialogue hamstrings the actors and falls flat (some of it is laughable); none of the characters or situations carries any real conviction; the lumbering film just can't get off the ground.  It has been aptly called ""an elephantine bore,"" and does scant justice to Ross Lockridge's estimable 1948 historical novel on which it is based.

Eva Marie Saint creditably played the ""Melanie"" role.  Lee Marvin surprised in his performance as a local braggart and bully.  Elizabeth Taylor pined, sighed, wept, and had fits in a Louisiana accent.To this viewer, though, the plot of this minor league version of ""Gone With the Wind"" is not very compelling, and the extra twist of a legendary ""raintree"" in an Indiana swamp comes across as literary fluff.Some of the scenes of Indiana and Louisiana must have been gorgeous on the big screen, but this Asian-release DVD does no credit to the original film and its photography.-30-",2,"Alas, slow and tedious",1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,917,"['Bottom', 'line', 'up', 'front', 'Running', 'more', '2', 'hours', '40', 'minutes', 'Raintree', 'County', 'slow', 'tedious.My', 'take', 'film', 'aimed', 'be', 'long', 'meditation', 'manliness', 'set', 'period', 'Civil', 'War', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'stuck', 'marriage', 'unstable', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor.Clift', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'creditably', 'played', 'Melanie', 'role', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'surprised', 'performance', 'local', 'braggart', 'bully', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'pined', 'sighed', 'wept', 'had', 'fits', 'Louisiana', 'accent.To', 'viewer', 'though', 'plot', 'minor', 'league', 'version', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'not', 'very', 'compelling', 'extra', 'twist', 'legendary', 'raintree', 'Indiana', 'swamp', 'literary', 'fluff.Some', 'scenes', 'Indiana', 'Louisiana', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'gorgeous', 'big', 'screen', 'Asian-release', 'DVD', 'credit', 'original', 'film', 'photography.-30-']",Raintree County VHS

416930,A7Y6AVS576M03,6304366051,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","I like RAINTREE COUNTY. I rate it in my top 10 or 20 films. (If you rank films it often seems we need more space in our top 10 doesn't it?) Essentially the film seems magical for me. It is a somewhat offbeat and disturbing epic that seems to captivate the viewer. In one instance it demonstrates tried and true Hollywood conventional storytelling at its best. Yet at other times it goes off into a nether land of the mysterious wonderment of what the beautiful side of life holds for the passionate seeker of such exquisite bewilderment. And still yet it juxtaposes this quest for seeking the secret of such profound and beautiful emoluments of nature to a darker and mysterious side the human psyche that befuddles and hinders the quest and ability to appreciate these wonders. All this set against the backdrop of the Civil War the film seems to somehow mirror and metaphorically explain the complexities of the conflict without truly stating in strong visual terms the sentiments of the North and South. The Civil War was a conflict characterized initially as one of nobility to a cause, clouded by dreams of glory that eventually came to a realization that all the death and destruction and waste of human energies was neither noble and certainly was not characterized by ideals of glory or other such aspirations.I suppose I could go on at length and talk about many of the esoterically interesting aspects of RAINTREE COUNTY but one scene really comes to mind and continues to captivate me. Late in the film during the Civil War sequence Lee Marvin gives one of the most wonderful lines in the film that sort of sums up the realization of what RAINTREE COUNTY really means. He yells out across to a band of rebels behind the thick brush, ""I come from Raintree County."" And then he speaks softly to himself in fond memory ""I come from Raintree County."" He has come full circle. The Raintree means many things to those that believe. This one tender moment of reflection by Marvin, ""Flash"" Perkins, affirms that. On a personal note Montgomery Clift's real life disfiguring accident during this film only heightens the enigmatic quality that this film holds. We truly don't know what could have been. We can only wonder and believe that something greater was at work on this production. Johnny Green's low-key emotionally fervent and almost unearthly score beckons the viewer to imagine greater things that can be only be inspired from some spiritual notions from the heavens. Both Elizabeth Taylor's and Eva Marie Saint's competition for Montgomery Clift's affections take second place to Clift's yearning for truth and understanding spurned by the expressive performance of Nigel Patrick as Professor, Jerusalem Webster Stiles, who has continually mystified Clift's yearning for life's answers.

Nevertheless he felt he should make a film inspired in the epic roots according the signs of  ""Gone with the wind"" and so in 1955, he adventured to materialize this project.The untiring, recurrent  and untamed search of the golden tree works out as a haunting metaphor about those memories of the youth, those vanished illusions, those elusive dreams about full happiness, but also alludes to Goethe `s Faust: ""Grey my friend, is all theory and green the golden tree of the life.""A Southern belle (Miss Taylor) stops at nothing or get what she wants, including her man, having as big frame the bloody Civil War.

I'm sorry I never got to see this movie in the theater, I was only about 10 or 11 years old at the time of its release. That didn't stop me from seeing a lot of other pictures at the time. I have always like this movie, the performance of Elizabeth Taylor as the southern belle is riveting. This picture came soon after Giant, another powerful performance, and just before Butterfield 8, for which she finally did win an Oscar. Good as she is in this, Montgomery Clift is the leading man and he is excellent as well. This film is also noticeable for being one of the first roles for Lee Marvin in a supporting spot. The magnificent score by Johnny Green has been released in a two-disc edition with the original Nat King Cole title song. The only problem I have with that is whoever was repsonsible for putting it up, didn't know how to end it, so you are stuck with listening to about 10 different possible musical endings, butI digress. The movie was meant as a companion piece to a certain other Civil War movie which was a little more well-known. I especially like the performance Eva Marie Saint puts in as Clift's long-suffering girl friend who never abandons him, even after his marriage to Taylor. The location scenes are fascinating, Reeffoot Lake in northwestern Tennessee stands in for the original Indiana location, and a set of ruins in western Mississippi near Natchez also fits in nicely as Taylor's character tries to expain her insanity. This role also shows what a versitle actress Taylor was. It's about as far from her role in Giant as she could get, and she shown in both pictures. It also doesn't hurt that she was nice to look at in both, either. Guess we'll have to settle for the widescreen video tape roadshow version for now, but hopefully MGM won't keep this one locked up forever.

The worst part is probably the script, followed by the plot.  The whole thing seems like 1950s illusions of what a crisis over racial ancestry in the civil-war South may have been like, and while no doubt there were crises of that nature, I just don't see them playing out like this story-- I just can't bring myself to believe that people would act like that in the 1850s, or for that matter, ever.  It's a big-budget 65mm widescreen film, probably trying to recreate the success of Gone With the Wind, but there's far better out there.Turns out they didn't originally even get the book author's name right in the credits, it's not Rockridge, but Lockridge.

416937,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6304366051,Kevin Killian,"[12, 16]","Either you love it or you hate it.  This movie isn't very satisfying, and part of it has to do with the intensely private and inward nature of the novel by Ross Lockridge from which the screenplay was taken.There was also the question of when during the filming did Montgomery Clift suffer his terrible accident.  For you always hear people saying you can point to the exact frame and rell after which you can see his face destroyed.  This begs the question, surely, for aren't most big studio films photographed out of sequence to accommodate actors and technician's schedules, changing weather conditions, vagaries of location shooting, etc.  That said, it would be great to have a DVD version of this film in which for once and for all, by comparison with the shooting script and MGM studio daily logs, a commentary might let us which scenes were filmed at what time and what month.  To me, Clift looks more or less the same in all stages of the film, but that might be makeup I guess.  There's something eerily withdrawn about his character in the first place, and his underplaying might have been his own way of getting into the role; on the other hand, it does horribly resemble the zombie-like movements of someone who's on a lot of painkilling medications.  As John Shaughnessy is supposed to be suffering from the multiple traumas of the Civil War, it's fitting he looks a little ""not there.""I can best compare the lackluster effect of watching this film to another more recent film that has similar storyline and mixed results, COLD MOUNTAIN.  Jude Law is playing the Monty Clift part this time around, while Nicole Kidman tries her best at playing the Eva Marie Saint ""Nell"" good girl waits at home part.  The colorful wacko that Elizabeth Taylor essays here went to Renee Zellweger, who was also channeling Betty Hutton in ANNIE GET YOUR GUN.

And that song is indeed the best part of the movie, so you could probably save yourself about four hours by turning it off after the last note. But perhaps that is a little harsh. &quot;Raintree County&quot; is actually one of those, &quot;You know what they should have done instead?&quot; kind of movies that you re-write with your friends during dinner afterwards. My brothers and I have all come up with better plot developments than the screenwriters, or so we think. For instance, Johnny Shawnessy (Montgomery Clift) is a, uh-oh, frustrated writer who longs to write Something Great. His father (Walter Abel), his mother (Agnes Morehead), his childhood sweetheart Nell (Eva Marie Saint), and even his HS teacher (Nigel Patrick) are always commenting on this throughout the movie at different times. But of course, we never see him write a darn thing, so where's the evidence, y'know? Well, during the Civil War, he decides to enlist to find his missing wife and child (never mind about how that happened, it's not important right now) and runs into that HS teacher who's now a battlefront artist a la Winslow Homer. Well, tarnation, why didn't the scriptwriter think to make Johnny a war correspondent? Then he could finally write SOMETHING and look for the family at the same time. Duh! Now about that missing wife. Susannah is played by Elizabeth Taylor in one of her Southern belle roles. There's trouble, you see, because she's also insane. But is she really insane, like in her genes, or is she making herself crazy with all these self doubts of hers? Her self-doubts are caused by Her Secret, which is that she was the innocent cause of her mother going crazy and burning down the plantation after shooting her husband and his negro mistress. Thus, her mother was definitely insane. But Susannah had secretly wished that the negro mistress--who was also her nurse--was her real mother. Now, here's the problem: if she is really her mother's daughter, then she will probably have heriditary insanity. If she is really the daughter of Henrietta the nurse, why then she's part black, which is too much for her to cope with. So which is better, to go crazy or be half black if you're a bigoted Southern belle? Your call on that one. And all throughout &quot;Raintree County&quot;, Johnny keeps waffling between his two loves, sexy crazy Susannah and &quot;from my roots&quot; Nell, who's not all that sexy but at least she's not crazy.

However, if Johnny had really loved Nell, he would have asked her to marry him, but he never did. To say that the marriage of Johnny and Susanna was love-less is completely false. Susanna loved Johnny more than anyone she had ever loved (except for maybe her mammy, Henrietta).Furthermore, for Johnny's part, even though he had been tricked into marrying Susanna (she told Johnny that she was pregnant), he may not have been ""in love"" with her in the beginning of their marriage, but he eventually did love her.Over time, the primary problems in their marriage were a result of a devastating fire in Susanna's youth, and her constant re-living of that trauma. A Secondary problem, was the fact that Susanna was a southern belle who believed in slavery and everything that that entailed. Johnny, on the other hand, was a northern abolitionist.Anyway, I will not spoil the end of the movie, as you should purchase this movie and find out for yourself the final result.I will say that the movie was spectacularly produced. The acting was excellent (Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Eva Marie Saint, Agnes Moorehead), the cinematography was good, the color was vibrant and the direction flowed very well.This is an epic drama on par with Gone With The Wind.

The movie is a problematical and often entertaining adaptation of Ross Lockridge's lyrical, metaphorical novel. Perhaps any film version of the elegantly poetic book would be a compromise, but ""Raintree County"" seems to suffer from a kind of curious detachment from the material. Elizabeth Taylor is fine, Montgomery Clift may have not been able to deliver what was needed due to his serious car accident midway into production, and the supporting players (like the terrific Lee Marvin) steal the show.The DVd version currently available is poor: the image has been cropped to approximately 1:85-1, certainly not the wide vista of MGM's highly-touted ""Camera 65"" (whose credit has been cut from the opening titles, by the way) and the print looks as if it may have been transferred from a VHS copy. For purists, I'd say stay away and wait for a better transfer. There are no overtures here, no intermission titles, and no features like documentaries: this film could have used them, and some commentary. For others, such as those who have fond memories of the movie from theaters, or for those who just need their ""Raintree"" fix every few months or so, then go ahead: it's an acceptable way to see the movie, and will likely be the only available format for the time being.

The Asian DVD version of the movie is a complete rip-off.  One of my discs wouldn't even play.  The first disc made a constant humming noise when I put it into the three DVD players that I have.  I've never heard a DVD hum like a vacuum cleaner.  If this isn't enough to dissuade you from buying this worthless piece of garbage, then check this out: the movie has been formatted to 1.85.1 instead of the 2.35.1 so you don't even get the entire picture.

It reflects the complexities of the old south and the civil war admirably. Elizabeth Taylor is incredible as ""Susan"" the tormented heroin who has fears of negro blood in her ancestry. The cinemtography is sweeping and spectaculer - but Oh My - thats where it ends.The copy I received (imported from U.S.A.) has sub-titles that cannot be turned off. They do not always stay true to the dialogue so are distracting and in fact annoying.Surely a better tribute to a great movie and a great actress could have been produced.

The bad new is that you cannot get the captions off the screen. Sometimes the captions are wrong and quite risque. The movie starts after the titles have started which isn't good. But the movie itself is very good. Could look at Elizabeth all day. Great story and cast. Beautifullly filmed and quite authenic.

I've always had a liking for melancholy music (like Rachmaninoff) but don't know why. Inherited, I suppose.The movie itself is good but not great. I like the way Monty Clift played his part -- assured but not cocky, seeming to say only what was needed when it was needed. Liz did a good job, too. There's one scene that takes place on the bottom of their bed, where she's trying to explain the fire, the doll, and what it all meant, and which was extended and had to require decent acting ability to make credible.The ending is murky as to what really happened.
