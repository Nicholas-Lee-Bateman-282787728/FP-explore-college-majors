I like Bob's encouragement, and I like that the real people in this look like they really are enjoying it, versus the pasted-on tight smiles so typical in other DVDs of this type.However, the cardio can be a little hard to follow. Bob does more coaching than actual doing, and the only reason that's bad is because his exercisers are all slightly out of sync with each other. Since the music doesn't have a heavy downbeat or bass, it doesn't help you to find the correct tempo. You'll have to find your own tempo and be content with that.Overall, though, it's a good workout DVD that requires a minimum of equipment and is very time-effective.

948019,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000BQ7J70,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","Now, I have been a fan of the show `The Biggest Loser' since its first season, and even if I've missed a few seasons in between, this past season re-sparked my adoration of just what this show represents.  Now, I am far from obese, but I could use a little toning.  My wife, who is like a total workout junkie, grabbed this DVD from our local library and after one week we decided to purchase our own copy.I am not one to get into workout videos.  I find them rather corny and ineffective.  I don't generally like the pacing and I find the workouts to be sub par compared to what I could do on my own (when I actually decide to do anything).Bob gets this one right.I think that, while flawed, the flaws are what make this workout work for me.  The contestants from the show (from the first two seasons) are all heavily inspired by Bob (who wouldn't be) and it shows in their glowing participation.  Even when they stumble around, nearly fall, lose their pace or even begin to throw in the towel they are endearing and likable `instructors'.  Bob is a GREAT instructor.  He has a very personable quality that makes him shine and keeps us interested.  He has a nice connection with the contestants and that translates through the screen and into our living rooms.The workouts are basic yet very engaging and involved and so you really FEEL it.  Like I said, I am FAR FROM OBESE (I'm barely overweight) but I nearly threw up the first time I did the low intensity cardio (lunges are my weakness, and holding that last squat is ridiculous).  Bob keeps you moving no matter what, and that keeps your heart elevated and your mind focused and so you really get the most out of these workouts.I find Gary a tad annoying, Drea as well.  They're comments back and forth can be a little distracting to be honest, but it's something that is easily overlooked.I do wish that there were more workouts here, but that is what the other DVD's are for.  This workout is not really for the advanced student, it is to encourage those who feel that they can't do anything to realize that they can do a lot more than they ever imagined.  I admire Bob for taking a very forgiving and encouraging approach to this DVD.  The fact that he shows alternate ways for you at home to engage in the workouts without overexerting yourself is admirable and makes this DVD something that everyone can enjoy and participate in.I'll be picking up more of these DVD's very soon!",4,An inspiring and motivating workout indeed!,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2440,"['Now', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'first', 'season', 'even', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'few', 'seasons', 'past', 'season', 're-sparked', 'adoration', 'just', 'what', 'show', 'Now', 'am', 'far', 'obese', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'toning', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'total', 'workout', 'junkie', 'grabbed', 'DVD', 'local', 'library', 'one', 'week', 'decided', 'purchase', 'own', 'copy.I', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'get', 'workout', 'videos', 'find', 'rather', 'corny', 'ineffective', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'pacing', 'find', 'workouts', 'be', 'sub', 'par', 'compared', 'what', 'could', 'do', 'own', 'when', 'actually', 'decide', 'do', 'anything', 'one', 'right.I', 'think', 'flawed', 'flaws', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'workout', 'work', 'contestants', 'show', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'heavily', 'inspired', 'Bob', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'glowing', 'participation', 'Even', 'when', 'stumble', 'around', 'nearly', 'fall', 'lose', 'pace', 'even', 'begin', 'throw', 'towel', 'are', 'endearing', 'likable', 'instructors', 'Bob', 'GREAT', 'instructor', 'very', 'personable', 'quality', 'shine', 'keeps', 'interested', 'nice', 'connection', 'contestants', 'screen', 'living', 'rooms.The', 'workouts', 'are', 'basic', 'yet', 'very', 'engaging', 'involved', 'so', 'really', 'FEEL', 'said', 'am', 'FAR', 'OBESE', ""'m"", 'barely', 'overweight', 'nearly', 'threw', 'up', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'low', 'intensity', 'cardio', 'lunges', 'are', 'weakness', 'holding', 'last', 'squat', 'ridiculous', 'Bob', 'moving', 'matter', 'what', 'heart', 'elevated', 'mind', 'focused', 'so', 'really', 'get', 'most', 'workouts.I', 'find', 'Gary', 'tad', 'annoying', 'Drea', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'comments', 'back', 'forth', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'distracting', 'be', 'honest', 'something', 'easily', 'overlooked.I', 'do', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'workouts', 'here', 'what', 'other', 'DVD', 'are', 'workout', 'not', 'really', 'advanced', 'student', 'encourage', 'who', 'feel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'realize', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'more', 'ever', 'imagined', 'admire', 'Bob', 'taking', 'very', 'forgiving', 'encouraging', 'approach', 'DVD', 'fact', 'alternate', 'ways', 'home', 'engage', 'workouts', 'overexerting', 'admirable', 'DVD', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'participate', 'in.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'more', 'DVD', 'very', 'soon']","Biggest Loser, The"

948023,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,B000BQ7J70,Brett D. Cullum,"[174, 176]","If you're familiar with the show, this is Bob Harper's routines on the DVD (Jillian Michaels is nowhere to be found).  The segments offered include the trainer taking up to six of the contestants through a typical workout with him.  They say what makes this DVD different than others is the fact they use ""normal people"" in the room with Bob.  They are the contestants who have been excercising with him for a while. The difficulty level of these workouts are pretty accelerated if you've never worked out before.  People with joint problems are going to find the constant jumping and kicking somewhat daunting.  The worst aspect of this DVD is the people who will want to use it the most may not be able to.  They do offer modified versions of the moves at certain times, but for the most part you better be ready to jump and do deep knee bends.  Bob talks you through every segment, and thankfully you can choose a ""music only"" option once you have the routines down (a nice touch for people who do this every day).There are six routines to choose from, and you can mix and match from the following:Warm-up (5 minutes) - Basic stretching moves to get you ready to go.Low Intensity Cardio (25 minutes) - Some jumping jacks, some kicking and punching, and a lot of core strengthening excercises for the begginer.High-Intensity Cardio (20 minutes) - A more aggressive cardio routine designed for people who have been working out for at least a month.  The moves are quick, and there's a lot more jumping.  It's constant motion combined with boxing and kicking moves.Strength and Sculpt (20 minutes) - Use hand weights and a mat or towel to go through a circuit training routine designed to build muscle and sculpt.Boot Camp (20 minutes) - A combination of of cardio and sculpting that can be done with or without hand weights.  This is for people who need a quick workout, and do not have time for both a cardio and sculpting routine.Cool Down (20 minutes) - Yoga style stretching to get you back to normal after an intense workout.You can select a combination of routines pre-matched for you, or customize the routines by choosing any combination of the above.  Menus are easy enough to navigate, and you shouldn't find it hard to get to where you need to be depending on what your level is.  Following along should be easy enough.  The only distraction is sometimes the contestants are out of synch with the rest of the group, or they modify the movement according to their body type.  I guess the trick is to zero in on the contestant that has your fitness level at first and follow them, but it does make it strange to see people doing variations of the same thing.The DVD itself looks fine for what it is.  Picture and sound are clear, and we get them in fullscreen and simple stereo.  Special features include a six week suggested plan, a cast and trainer intro, and Matt and Suzy's story for inspiration.  Also tucked in to this package are corporate sponsor 24 Hour Fitness commercials, a message from the fitness company's CEO, and a certificate good for ""30 Days Free"" at a local 24 Hour Fitness gym.  For less than ten dollars you knew someone was going to try and sell you something.The workouts are a great way to get started.  Bob is a pretty detailed trainer even on DVD, but he still can't replace a session with a real fitness expert live in front of you.  I'd say this is a good DVD for people who are pressed for time, can't get to a gym, or need to start off doing things in the privacy of the home before going public at the local fitness palace.  Gyms can be intimidating, and as long as you move and do something it's better than nothing.

948024,AWVQR7YYTYJ1L,B000BQ7J70,Brittany Rose,"[8, 8]","This is the first in a relatively long line of Biggest Loser workout DVDs, and it's also one of the better ones. It contains four workouts, all of which can be completed within half an hour, as well as a short warm-up segment, and a (too long!) ten-minute stretch / cooldown segment. The DVD encourages you to go through a six-week training program that has you alternating which of the four main programs you do each day, but you can also customize all 6 pieces to create your own ideal workout, depending on your fitness level.Each workout presents its own challenges - as someone who is pretty fit and has been keeping up a regular workout program for over a year, I still find myself winded or giving up here and there. This is partially because Bob, your trainer, loves to d-r-a-w things out, right when you're hitting your threshold for pain and / or exhaustion. Regardless, all four workouts keep you engaged and for the most part, the time flies by.As for those aforementioned challenges? The low impact cardio is five minutes longer than the others, to make up for its slightly easier pace. The sculpt workout is the most traditional weight training program, with a ridiculous series of abs moves right at the end to really knock you out. The high impact cardio really does in your calves through the endless tire runs and high knees. And the Boot Camp, a cardio with weights circuit training program, is pretty intense on the arms and knees. ALL of these workouts will make you feel like you've really worked, without having to spend hours dialing it in at the gym, which is great. The contestants have much better form and more personality than those you'll see on future BL DVDs, but it's still comforting to see them struggle and pause here and there when things get really intense.Some words to the wise - if you're really out of shape or are just starting to workout again, take it easy. Don't be ashamed to start out on the beginner moves or use light weights (or no weights at all). Just because this is the first ever BL DVD, it's definitely not easier than any of the others. I find the moves a little less creative and a little more strenuous on the joints than other DVDs, but in general I'd easily recommend this as a part of a regular workout program.",4,The Original & One Of The Best,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,2274,"['first', 'relatively', 'long', 'line', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'four', 'workouts', 'can', 'be', 'completed', 'hour', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'warm-up', 'segment', 'too', 'long', 'ten-minute', 'stretch', '/', 'cooldown', 'segment', 'DVD', 'go', 'six-week', 'training', 'program', 'alternating', 'four', 'main', 'programs', 'do', 'day', 'can', 'also', 'customize', '6', 'pieces', 'create', 'own', 'ideal', 'workout', 'depending', 'fitness', 'level.Each', 'workout', 'own', 'challenges', 'someone', 'who', 'pretty', 'fit', 'been', 'keeping', 'up', 'regular', 'workout', 'program', 'year', 'still', 'find', 'winded', 'giving', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'partially', 'Bob', 'trainer', 'd-r-a-w', 'things', 'out', 'right', 'when', ""'re"", 'hitting', 'threshold', 'pain', '/', 'exhaustion', 'Regardless', 'four', 'workouts', 'keep', 'engaged', 'most', 'part', 'time', 'by.As', 'aforementioned', 'challenges', 'low', 'impact', 'cardio', 'five', 'minutes', 'longer', 'others', 'make', 'up', 'slightly', 'easier', 'pace', 'sculpt', 'workout', 'most', 'traditional', 'weight', 'training', 'program', 'ridiculous', 'series', 'abs', 'moves', 'right', 'end', 'really', 'knock', 'out', 'high', 'impact', 'cardio', 'really', 'calves', 'endless', 'tire', 'runs', 'high', 'knees', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'cardio', 'weights', 'circuit', 'training', 'program', 'pretty', 'intense', 'arms', 'knees', 'workouts', 'will', 'make', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'really', 'worked', 'having', 'spend', 'hours', 'dialing', 'gym', 'great', 'contestants', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'form', 'more', 'personality', ""'ll"", 'see', 'future', 'BL', 'DVDs', 'still', 'comforting', 'see', 'struggle', 'pause', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'intense.Some', 'words', 'wise', ""'re"", 'really', 'shape', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'workout', 'again', 'take', 'easy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'ashamed', 'start', 'out', 'beginner', 'moves', 'use', 'light', 'weights', 'weights', 'Just', 'first', 'ever', 'BL', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'not', 'easier', 'others', 'find', 'moves', 'little', 'less', 'creative', 'little', 'more', 'strenuous', 'joints', 'other', 'DVDs', 'general', ""'d"", 'easily', 'recommend', 'part', 'regular', 'workout', 'program']","Biggest Loser, The"

I found that I lost weight on weeks 1,3,5 and not on weeks 2,4,6. It was at least several pounds on those weeks so I am not sure why on the even weeks there was not weight loss however there was not a weight gain either. Anyway, Bob really helps to push you and encourage you. It helps to see that biggest loser contestants are struggling in the background just like anyone would when they first start out.

After looking for something that is easy to follow and do-able, it seemed the search might be fruitless. This workout, however, could not be more satisfying.Bob is a bad boy, but flirty and cute in his narration. It's a sexy video, with his teasing and commands, which takes my mind off the pain of the workout. It makes me laugh, even when in positions that burrrrrrrnnnnnn.The participants are all regular people. They mess up, they sweat, they grimace, they grunt, and they talk back and forth, exclaiming out loud that they are in pain from the burn, and that the workout is hard for them. (And Bob laughs and then does something to make it harder, like pressing lightly on their shoulders while they are in a long-held squat.) The participants even lose step / count at times - it's GREAT!Make sure to watch other things than the videos so you can see the before and after videos of the participants. Some of the Biggest Losers are very tight and in-shape now and others still have a way to go, which makes it more encouraging and easier to work out with than traditional exercise videos.All of the exercises (in the week one workout at least) are totally doable for me. I have bad knees but know my limits - I just didn't go as deep into squats or lunges, and there are all sorts of other exercises for which I can do the full range of motion. It's a tough workout but as long as you're mindful of yourself and know what you can and can't do, this video would make an excellent companion (or replacement!) for what you have now. You can work as hard and as deep or as soft and as light as you want to.There are all sorts of options to use on this disc - narration and music, just music, and six different workouts. It's a versatile product, very pleasant to watch, and it makes me feel like I've accomplished something after I'm finished doing it.",5,Fantastic!,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,1907,"['was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'workout', 'first', 'looking', 'something', 'easy', 'follow', 'do-able', 'seemed', 'search', 'might', 'be', 'fruitless', 'workout', 'however', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'satisfying.Bob', 'bad', 'boy', 'flirty', 'cute', 'narration', 'sexy', 'video', 'teasing', 'commands', 'mind', 'pain', 'workout', 'even', 'when', 'positions', 'burrrrrrrnnnnnn.The', 'participants', 'are', 'regular', 'people', 'mess', 'up', 'sweat', 'grimace', 'grunt', 'talk', 'back', 'forth', 'exclaiming', 'out', 'loud', 'are', 'pain', 'burn', 'workout', 'hard', 'Bob', 'laughs', 'then', 'something', 'make', 'harder', 'pressing', 'lightly', 'shoulders', 'are', 'long-held', 'squat', 'participants', 'even', 'lose', 'step', '/', 'count', 'times', 'GREAT', 'Make', 'sure', 'watch', 'other', 'things', 'videos', 'can', 'see', 'before', 'videos', 'participants', 'Biggest', 'Losers', 'are', 'very', 'tight', 'in-shape', 'now', 'others', 'still', 'have', 'way', 'go', 'more', 'encouraging', 'easier', 'work', 'out', 'traditional', 'exercise', 'videos.All', 'exercises', 'week', 'one', 'workout', 'least', 'are', 'totally', 'doable', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'know', 'limits', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'deep', 'squats', 'lunges', 'are', 'sorts', 'other', 'exercises', 'can', 'do', 'full', 'range', 'motion', 'tough', 'workout', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'mindful', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'video', 'would', 'make', 'excellent', 'companion', 'replacement', 'what', 'have', 'now', 'can', 'work', 'as', 'hard', 'deep', 'soft', 'as', 'light', 'want', 'are', 'sorts', 'options', 'use', 'disc', 'narration', 'music', 'just', 'music', 'six', 'different', 'workouts', 'versatile', 'product', 'very', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'accomplished', 'something', ""'m"", 'finished', 'doing']","Biggest Loser, The"

To date (4 months & 2 weeks) I have gotten rid of 39lbs.  The workouts are challenging at 1st and as you adapt you can step them up by adding heavier weights.  I still cannot do all 4 of the workouts like the contestants.  You get 4 different workout to choose from plus the warm-up (4 minutes) & cool down (10 minutes).  The Low Impact is the longest at (25 minutes long), Toning (20 minutes), High Impact (20 minutes) & Boot Camp (20 minutes).  I enjoy working out with Bob and the contestant from The Biggest Loser.  I have gotten 3 other women that are logging there progress with me in my group to purchase this video as well.  They enjoy it.  One of the women is a PE teacher and does mega long workouts but is challenged and feels great doing this one.

Do you think you are up to the challenge that all those contestants on the hit television show had to endure from trainers Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels? Frankly, do YOU think you have what it takes to be ""The Biggest Loser"" in your own household? Then prepare to be challenged in a fun and exciting way with The Biggest Loser Workout DVD.As someone who lost nearly 200 pounds, I am very well aware of the importance of a regular cardio workout program to weight management. Although my eating plan was the low-carb lifestyle, I still credit my daily visits to the YMCA as a major contributor to my weight loss success. That's why I wrote a whole chapter in my book ""Livin' La Vida Low-Carb"" about the incredible importance of exercise.I am a HUGE FAN of ""The Biggest Loser"" and couldn't wait to get this DVDwith an Amazon.com gift certificate I received for Christmas. I eagerly popped it into my DVD player to see for myself what ""The Biggest Loser"" workout plan is all about.After you hear an inspiring message from trainer Bob Harper (read my exclusive interview with him at LivinLaVidaLowCarb.com>, whose voice will push you during your workout, you can also see the dramatic transformation in the lives of both Matt, who was crowned the Season Two winner of ""The Biggest Loser,"" as well as Suzy, who was in the top three from Season Two. In addition, there is Season Two runner-up Seth and Andrea along with Season One contestants, Gary and Drea, who have done a great job keeping their weight off. These six ""real life"" people will show you that exercise can be fit into your life and can be fun, too.The thing I like best about this workout video is that you can go at your own pace. There are varying levels of intensity and you can work your way up from the ""Low-Intensity"" workout all the way to the heart-pumping ""Boot Camp."" Whew, dog, this DVD is gonna work you! But if you are going to see results in your weight loss, then you will need to get your heart rate up and your body is gonna need to sweat. The Biggest Loser Workout DVDwill certainly do the trick.I'm not usually a big fan of workout DVDs because they are sometimes too hokey in my book. But if you are a fan of the show or have a great need to do something about that pot belly, this may be a great motivating tool for you. Just as I have successfully lost weight along with these contestants from ""The Biggest Loser,"" so can YOU do it, too! Put in the effort and the results will be worth it in the end!

The workouts are actually pretty challenging. The quality of the workouts are good, but there are a couple of reasons why I give this 4 stars instead of 5. This is very high impact. If you have joint problems this is not the DVD for you. There is ALOT of jumping. Also, this must have been recorded before the finale because the cast of former contestants were visibly unable to keep up on some of the exercises. Also, sometimes they would be going at a different pace, or be on a different foot, than Bob the trainer. These things can be pretty distracting. The versatility of this DVD is a big selling point.

948047,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B000BQ7J70,Sheri in Reho,"[59, 61]","This DVD features trainer Bob Harper and cast members from The Biggest Loser TV show (Seth, Gary, Matt, Suzy, etc.). The DVD is broken into 2 cardio workouts and 2 sculpting workouts plus 1 warmup and 1 cooldown that are used for all of the workouts. They have a menu that allows you to pick and choose a workout regimen from these pieces or pick a ready-made workout. Love that!Warmup (5 mins.): This is a stretch-type warmup vs. a cardio-type warmup--stretches, lunges and squats. Basic stuff.Low Intensity Cardio (20 mins.): Includes some basic cardio warmup and then moves into a light kickbox-style cardio. Being a kickbox fan, it was nice to see some basic kickboxing techniques here.  However, just about every other kickboxing workout I've ever done has explained how to punch and kick to not injure yourself and Bob doesn't. As an experienced kickboxer, this was a minor irritation--I just did it how it SHOULD be done, not how he said to do it. But for people new to kickboxing, I am concerned that he doesn't explain proper technique.High Intensity Cardio (20 mins.): Begins with a faux-jump-rope cardio warmup and moved into some plyometric moves (jumping side to side quickly, etc.), football-style agility drills, high knee lifts and also some kickboxing techniques here too. Definitely intense.Strength & Sculpt (20 mins.): He does 1-minute circuits of upper body then lower body activity--upper body is lifting weights and lower body is squats and lunges while holding weights. I felt almost every exercise, especially when he has you pulsing or holding those squats and plies. About half of this workout is standing and the rest is on the floor. The floor work is mostly abs but with some buns and triceps.Boot Camp (20 mins.): Starts out with kickbox punches using weights and moves into calisthenics in 1-minute intervals like in the previous workout. The pace is intense...right when you finish one exercise and you're begging for rest, he pushes you right into the next exercise.Cooldown (5 mins.): I LOVE this cooldown. It is filmed on a rocky outcropping on a hill that looks like the one they made them climb on the TV show. They do multiple stretches and balance moves in this beautiful outdoor setting.The biggest weakness of the cardio workouts is that they use only that generic Biggest Loser background music from the TV show. As a result, with no beat, the exercisers get out of synch with each other, with the trainer, and I get out of synch with all of them on a regular basis. This is a REAL PAIN because I otherwise like this DVD quite a bit.If you are a fan of the TV show The Biggest Loser and especially if you watched the season that included these people, it is a great benefit because you feel like you already know them. There is a great sense of camaraderie and history with Bob and the group. It is obvious that they have all been through this hard work before and it is motivating to see what they look like and feel like now and realize the hard work it took to get there. The only person who really gets on my nerves is Drea during the sculpt workout (too much ego).",3,Camaraderie between Bob & BL Gang is fun.,1157155200,"09 2, 2006",2006,3112,"['DVD', 'trainer', 'Bob', 'Harper', 'cast', 'members', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'TV', 'show', 'Seth', 'Gary', 'Matt', 'Suzy', 'etc.', 'DVD', 'broken', '2', 'cardio', 'workouts', '2', 'sculpting', 'workouts', '1', 'warmup', '1', 'cooldown', 'are', 'used', 'workouts', 'have', 'menu', 'pick', 'choose', 'workout', 'regimen', 'pieces', 'pick', 'ready-made', 'workout', 'Love', 'Warmup', '5', 'mins', 'stretch-type', 'warmup', 'vs.', 'cardio-type', 'warmup', 'stretches', 'lunges', 'squats', 'Basic', 'stuff.Low', 'Intensity', 'Cardio', '20', 'mins', 'basic', 'cardio', 'warmup', 'then', 'light', 'kickbox-style', 'cardio', 'Being', 'kickbox', 'fan', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'basic', 'kickboxing', 'techniques', 'here', 'However', 'just', 'other', 'kickboxing', 'workout', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'explained', 'how', 'punch', 'kick', 'not', 'injure', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'kickboxer', 'was', 'minor', 'irritation', 'just', 'did', 'how', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'done', 'not', 'how', 'said', 'do', 'people', 'new', 'kickboxing', 'am', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'explain', 'proper', 'technique.High', 'Intensity', 'Cardio', '20', 'mins', 'faux-jump-rope', 'cardio', 'warmup', 'moved', 'plyometric', 'moves', 'jumping', 'side', 'side', 'quickly', 'etc', 'football-style', 'agility', 'drills', 'high', 'knee', 'lifts', 'also', 'kickboxing', 'techniques', 'here', 'too', 'Definitely', 'intense.Strength', 'Sculpt', '20', 'mins', '1-minute', 'circuits', 'upper', 'body', 'then', 'lower', 'body', 'activity', 'upper', 'body', 'lifting', 'weights', 'lower', 'body', 'squats', 'lunges', 'holding', 'weights', 'felt', 'almost', 'exercise', 'especially', 'when', 'pulsing', 'holding', 'squats', 'plies', 'half', 'workout', 'standing', 'rest', 'floor', 'floor', 'work', 'mostly', 'abs', 'buns', 'triceps.Boot', 'Camp', '20', 'mins', 'out', 'kickbox', 'punches', 'using', 'weights', 'moves', 'calisthenics', '1-minute', 'intervals', 'previous', 'workout', 'pace', 'intense', 'right', 'when', 'finish', 'one', 'exercise', ""'re"", 'begging', 'rest', 'right', 'next', 'exercise.Cooldown', '5', 'mins', 'LOVE', 'cooldown', 'filmed', 'rocky', 'outcropping', 'hill', 'one', 'made', 'climb', 'TV', 'show', 'do', 'multiple', 'stretches', 'balance', 'moves', 'beautiful', 'outdoor', 'setting.The', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'use', 'only', 'generic', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'background', 'music', 'TV', 'show', 'result', 'beat', 'exercisers', 'get', 'synch', 'other', 'trainer', 'get', 'synch', 'regular', 'basis', 'REAL', 'PAIN', 'otherwise', 'DVD', 'quite', 'bit.If', 'are', 'fan', 'TV', 'show', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'especially', 'watched', 'season', 'included', 'people', 'great', 'benefit', 'feel', 'already', 'know', 'great', 'sense', 'camaraderie', 'history', 'Bob', 'group', 'obvious', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'work', 'motivating', 'see', 'what', 'look', 'feel', 'now', 'realize', 'hard', 'work', 'took', 'get', 'there', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'nerves', 'Drea', 'sculpt', 'workout', 'too', 'much', 'ego']","Biggest Loser, The"

948049,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B000BQ7J70,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[4, 4]","I purchased this video because I love the Power Sculpt and Cardio Max DVDs.  I have only done the Boot Camp, High-Intensity Cardio, the Sculpt, and the Stretch workouts (being an intermediate/advanced exerciser, I bypassed the Low-Intensity Cardio segment because they said it was for people who have never worked out before).  I must say, overall, I am impressed with this series of workouts.  I love the ""mix and match"" option, so you can construct a workout that is designed for you.  The Boot Camp is a nice addition for those mornings when I don't have time to do a full cardio and strength workout.The High-Intensity Cardio is very good--it is a bit repetitive, but Bob really gets your heart rate up, especially during the tires and football runs.  He works the lower body first, does upper body, and then goes back to the lower body with some kicks.  I like it because the moves are not complicated and can be done easily, but very effective at getting your heart rate up and moving.  No, the contestants in the background don't always keep together, but I try to ramp up my own intensity, and end up being out of rhythm with them anyway.  I tend to go faster than the people on the DVD, to really push my heart rate to its limit.  Let me tell you, I was drenched in sweat after those 20 minutes!The Sculpt/Strength workout is good as well; it is a basic strength workout without any combo moves that work both upper and lower body together.  Bob focuses on upper and lower body separately, but I really like his core moves towards the end with the reverse crunches, regular crunches, oblique crunches, and ab holds.  I have a tendency to like the old school moves, so I didn't really mind the absence of the combination moves.  However, I do other workouts during the week that have those, such as a plethora of Jillian Michaels workouts and some of the Women's Health workouts, to balance out my weekly rotation. Just because one workout you do doesn't have some of the moves you want doesn't mean the DVD is worthless.  Also, I have read some complaints about the music; music is never (and shouldn't be, in my opinion) a factor in my decision regarding whether or not a workout is worth buying--if you're focusing on the WORKOUT, you shouldn't even notice the music!Overall, this DVD is worth investing your money in.  All of the Biggest Loser workouts have a solid foundation, and this one is no different.

They show you the real deal with them breathing hard, messing up & wanting to stop. You know how they feel, they aren't doing the fake smiles & editing all the minor errors, etc. It feels like a regular gym claass.Bob, the personal trainer from the show even jokes that he doesn't have to do the workout, just guide the others & talk us into not giving up. I was pleasantly surprised with his style. He is very sweet, knows it's not fun & is really good at motivating you. He says happily it's ok if you can only lift your knee a little, etc., he never puts you down. He does show some modifications, etc. He talks 75% into the camera/you as if you were there. I've had other dvds where the instructor were very callous about saying not to stop, don't be a wimp, etc. which is very negative & studies have shown negativity rarely helps people challenge themselves.Warmup: little over 4 min down outsides w/basic stretching, lunges, squats, side torse stretching, shoulder rolls, etc. shown with one contestant at a time.Workout 1: Low Intensity Cardio: step touches, jumping jacks, lunges, squats, etc. The issue I have to thiw workout is the kickboxing segment, there is a lot of kicking & punching, but he doesn't tell you how to avoid injuries.Workout 2: High Cardio: fake jump roping, skiing/skating, football running, tire running, punches/hooks, knee kicks.Workout 3: Scuplt & Stretch: starts with weights for arms in different positions, then lungest, squats & plies. Next is floorwork for abs with reverse crunches, crunches for obliques, reg crunches & weights for triceps. Bridge pose in yoga w/1 leg up for the back/butt, the yoga plank kinda on elbows for abs & ends in child's pose.Workout 4: Boot Camp w/weights: punching, arm raises, jumping jacks, push ups, plank, jumping, squats, simulating wood chopping, repeat 2x.Cooldown: 10 min with Bob leading 5 of the contestants on a mountain doing basi stretches & some yoga like side angle, treeThere's a trailer at collagevideo com",4,"Good workout, great interactive, honest feel",1163808000,"11 18, 2006",2006,2311,"['Many', 'people', 'already', 'reviewed', '4', '20', 'min', 'programs', 'toning', 'cardio', 'can', 'be', 'customized', '1', 'warmup', 'cool', 'down', 'program.The', 'difference', 'why', 'everyone', 'bought', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'amounts', 'makeup', 'perky', 'workout', 'outfits', 'stop', 'workout', 'wipe', 'off', 'sweat', 'fix', 'hair', 'etc', 'most', 'fitness', 'dvds', 'show', 'real', 'deal', 'breathing', 'hard', 'messing', 'up', 'wanting', 'stop', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'fake', 'editing', 'minor', 'errors', 'etc', 'regular', 'gym', 'claass.Bob', 'personal', 'trainer', 'show', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'workout', 'just', 'guide', 'others', 'talk', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'style', 'very', 'sweet', 'not', 'fun', 'really', 'good', 'motivating', 'happily', 'ok', 'can', 'only', 'lift', 'knee', 'little', 'etc.', 'never', 'down', 'show', 'modifications', 'etc', '75', '%', 'camera/you', 'were', 'there', ""'ve"", 'had', 'other', 'dvds', 'where', 'instructor', 'were', 'very', 'callous', 'saying', 'not', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'wimp', 'etc', 'very', 'negative', 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'negativity', 'rarely', 'people', 'challenge', 'themselves.Warmup', 'little', '4', 'min', 'down', 'outsides', 'w/basic', 'stretching', 'lunges', 'squats', 'side', 'torse', 'stretching', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'etc', 'shown', 'one', 'contestant', 'time.Workout', '1', 'Low', 'Intensity', 'Cardio', 'step', 'touches', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'lunges', 'squats', 'etc', 'issue', 'have', 'thiw', 'workout', 'kickboxing', 'segment', 'lot', 'kicking', 'punching', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'avoid', 'injuries.Workout', '2', 'High', 'Cardio', 'fake', 'jump', 'roping', 'skiing/skating', 'football', 'running', 'tire', 'running', 'punches/hooks', 'knee', '3', 'Scuplt', 'Stretch', 'starts', 'weights', 'arms', 'different', 'positions', 'then', 'lungest', 'squats', 'plies', 'Next', 'floorwork', 'abs', 'reverse', 'crunches', 'crunches', 'obliques', 'reg', 'crunches', 'weights', 'triceps', 'Bridge', 'pose', 'yoga', 'w/1', 'up', 'back/butt', 'yoga', 'plank', 'kinda', 'elbows', 'abs', 'ends', 'child', 'pose.Workout', '4', 'Boot', 'Camp', 'w/weights', 'punching', 'arm', 'raises', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'push', 'ups', 'plank', 'jumping', 'squats', 'simulating', 'wood', 'chopping', 'repeat', '2x.Cooldown', '10', 'min', 'Bob', 'leading', '5', 'contestants', 'mountain', 'doing', 'basi', 'stretches', 'yoga', 'side', 'angle', 'trailer', 'collagevideo', 'com']","Biggest Loser, The"

The warm up and cool down are also very effective.
