961798,A3OMBJ1RKFWP5M,B000CRR3OC,"Ax20 ""Ax20""","[4, 4]","I've found myself surprisingly impressed with ABC Family shows so when I saw that this entire show was up on Hulu, I naturally decided to try it. I also have a bit of a dislike for horse shows (thanks to a few particularly bad incidences, such as Misty of Chincoteague) so I was a little doubtful. This show did a good job of removing my dislike.Wildfire follows a girl who was in a correctional facility and is given a second chance when a horse racing family takes her in as a stable hand. Eventually, she becomes part of the family and becomes a jockey.There are some things about this show that I particularly like:-The time the show spent on Kris's family in particular was very strong. we come to understand how she might have ended up in the juvenile detention center and why she might make bad decisions in her life.-Her issues when it came to trust in herself and others was particularly clear and understandable. After making so many bad decisions for herself and being hurt by so many people, it is only natural that she would be hesitant to trust even when people seem to have only ever helped her.-There was an interesting competitive/friendly dynamic happening between the Davis and Ritter farms. On the one hand the Davis family would stop at no cost to become the dominant stable. On the other, the Davis children could not help but become entangled with the Ritter family. This push and pull between family and friend/love loyalty added stakes to every aspect of the show because to win in on area meant losing in another.There were some things I did not like:-Kris's relationship with Junior felt forced in the beginning and rushed in the end. It seemed strange that she would fall for him, that he would change personalities so quickly, and that their wedding would happen so fast. It almost makes me wonder if they were likely to succeed long-term.-There was so much more potential in Kris's backstory than what we got. We could have used more about Kris's family-seeing her mother a second time, maybe learning about her father. I would have liked to see her go home at some point (not permanently, just to confront her past head on).Ultimately, I enjoyed this show. It isn't ABC Family's best, but it is a step in the direction that the network has taken recently to become more current and popular.",3,I Don't Usually Like Horse Shows...,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,2321,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'surprisingly', 'impressed', 'ABC', 'Family', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'entire', 'show', 'was', 'up', 'Hulu', 'naturally', 'decided', 'try', 'also', 'have', 'bit', 'dislike', 'horse', 'shows', 'thanks', 'few', 'particularly', 'bad', 'incidences', 'such', 'Misty', 'Chincoteague', 'so', 'was', 'little', 'doubtful', 'show', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'removing', 'dislike.Wildfire', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'correctional', 'facility', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'when', 'horse', 'racing', 'family', 'stable', 'hand', 'Eventually', 'part', 'family', 'jockey.There', 'are', 'things', 'show', 'particularly', '-The', 'time', 'show', 'spent', 'Kris', 'family', 'particular', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'come', 'understand', 'how', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'juvenile', 'detention', 'center', 'why', 'might', 'make', 'bad', 'decisions', 'life.-Her', 'issues', 'when', 'came', 'trust', 'others', 'was', 'particularly', 'clear', 'understandable', 'making', 'so', 'many', 'bad', 'decisions', 'herself', 'being', 'hurt', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'only', 'natural', 'would', 'be', 'hesitant', 'trust', 'even', 'when', 'people', 'seem', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'helped', 'her.-There', 'was', 'interesting', 'competitive/friendly', 'dynamic', 'happening', 'Davis', 'Ritter', 'farms', 'one', 'hand', 'Davis', 'family', 'would', 'stop', 'cost', 'become', 'dominant', 'stable', 'other', 'Davis', 'children', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'entangled', 'Ritter', 'family', 'push', 'pull', 'family', 'friend/love', 'loyalty', 'added', 'stakes', 'aspect', 'show', 'win', 'area', 'meant', 'losing', 'another.There', 'were', 'things', 'did', 'not', '-Kris', 'relationship', 'Junior', 'felt', 'forced', 'beginning', 'rushed', 'end', 'seemed', 'strange', 'would', 'fall', 'would', 'change', 'personalities', 'so', 'quickly', 'wedding', 'would', 'happen', 'so', 'fast', 'almost', 'wonder', 'were', 'likely', 'succeed', 'long-term.-There', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'potential', 'Kris', 'backstory', 'what', 'got', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'Kris', 'family-seeing', 'mother', 'second', 'time', 'maybe', 'learning', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'go', 'home', 'point', 'not', 'permanently', 'just', 'confront', 'past', 'head', '.Ultimately', 'enjoyed', 'show', ""n't"", 'ABC', 'Family', 'best', 'step', 'direction', 'network', 'taken', 'recently', 'become', 'more', 'current', 'popular']",N/A

961812,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B000CRR3OC,N. Gregg,"[0, 0]","An evening-type soap opera (mostly PG, sometimes PG13) which revolves around Kris Furillo and a horse named Wildfire, and their bond.  And around the Raintree and Davis neighboring rival horse ranches. (Raintree being the struggling good-hearted ranch, and the Davis ranch being the rich competition who often connive and do underhanded things - usually against Raintree.)Kris is a teen who grew up in a broken home, taking care of her alcoholic/druggie mom, and got sent to juvenile prison for stealing a car. While there she gets involved with a horse at an equestrian place which is part of the juvenille rehab program. Turns out she has a natural talent with the horses and forms a special bond with a horse named Wildfire. Pablo is an ex-con who trains the horses at Raintree and also worked at the place Wildfire was at. Recognizing something special about Kris, he stepped up and volunteered to sponsor her if she got parole, and got her a job at the Raintree ranch owned by the Ritter family.Matt Ritter and his best buddy Ken Davis Jr (""Junior"") are both smitten with Kris on sight, and Jr's sister Danielle (""Dani"") instantly sees Kris as a rival/threat.At the beginning the writers had Matt, Jr and Dani still in HS (and Kris needing to get her GED) - but all that goes out the window within a handful of episodes as they act more like twenty-somethings with plenty of time on their hands and school never seems to get mentioned again. So you're better off ignoring school references and believing from the start that they're HS grads who won't be doing college.At the Raintree ranch, Kris finds a ""home"" she never thought she'd have as the Ritters treat her like family, and she learns a trade and develops her natural talent for all things equestrian and gets to continue to be with the horse Wildfire.  Throughout the series, love interests flip frequently and there are always plenty of crisis situations - usually due to financial issues at Raintree, and Dani's conniving/underhandedness. So, plenty of ""drama"" for this drama.If you watch all the episodes (seasons 1-4) back to back as I did, by the 3rd season you'll be really wishing they'd make up their minds on if Kris should be with Matt or Jr and at least try to stick to it.  But overall it's a pretty interesting show with characters you'll enjoy. The horses are beautiful, the races are exciting, and the acting is good - especially the star Genevieve Cortese (""Kris"") who has you in her hands right from the beginning and never lets go.",4,Will have you in it's clutches from beginning to end,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",2012,2513,"['evening-type', 'soap', 'opera', 'mostly', 'PG', 'sometimes', 'PG13', 'Kris', 'Furillo', 'horse', 'named', 'Wildfire', 'bond', 'Raintree', 'Davis', 'neighboring', 'rival', 'horse', 'ranches', 'Raintree', 'being', 'struggling', 'good-hearted', 'ranch', 'Davis', 'ranch', 'being', 'rich', 'competition', 'who', 'often', 'connive', 'do', 'underhanded', 'things', 'usually', 'Raintree', 'Kris', 'teen', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'broken', 'home', 'taking', 'care', 'alcoholic/druggie', 'mom', 'got', 'sent', 'juvenile', 'prison', 'stealing', 'car', 'involved', 'horse', 'equestrian', 'place', 'part', 'juvenille', 'rehab', 'program', 'out', 'natural', 'talent', 'horses', 'special', 'bond', 'horse', 'named', 'Wildfire', 'Pablo', 'ex-con', 'who', 'horses', 'Raintree', 'also', 'worked', 'place', 'Wildfire', 'was', 'Recognizing', 'something', 'special', 'Kris', 'stepped', 'up', 'volunteered', 'sponsor', 'got', 'parole', 'got', 'job', 'Raintree', 'ranch', 'owned', 'Ritter', 'family.Matt', 'Ritter', 'best', 'buddy', 'Ken', 'Davis', 'Jr', 'Junior', 'are', 'smitten', 'Kris', 'sight', 'Jr', 'sister', 'Danielle', 'Dani', 'instantly', 'Kris', 'rival/threat.At', 'beginning', 'writers', 'had', 'Matt', 'Jr', 'Dani', 'still', 'HS', 'Kris', 'needing', 'get', 'GED', 'out', 'window', 'handful', 'episodes', 'act', 'more', 'twenty-somethings', 'plenty', 'time', 'hands', 'school', 'never', 'get', 'mentioned', 'again', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'ignoring', 'school', 'references', 'believing', 'start', ""'re"", 'HS', 'grads', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'doing', 'college.At', 'Raintree', 'ranch', 'Kris', 'home', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'have', 'Ritters', 'treat', 'family', 'trade', 'natural', 'talent', 'things', 'equestrian', 'continue', 'be', 'horse', 'Wildfire', 'series', 'love', 'interests', 'flip', 'frequently', 'are', 'always', 'plenty', 'crisis', 'situations', 'usually', 'due', 'financial', 'issues', 'Raintree', 'Dani', 'conniving/underhandedness', 'So', 'plenty', 'drama', 'drama.If', 'watch', 'episodes', 'seasons', '1-4', 'back', 'back', 'did', '3rd', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'really', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'Kris', 'should', 'be', 'Matt', 'Jr', 'least', 'try', 'stick', 'overall', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'show', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'horses', 'are', 'beautiful', 'races', 'are', 'exciting', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'star', 'Genevieve', 'Cortese', 'Kris', 'who', 'hands', 'right', 'beginning', 'never', 'lets', 'go']",N/A
961813,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000CRR3OC,Only-A-Child,"[1, 2]","""Everything is a mess!"" says Kris Furillo (Genevieve Cortese) late in the 3rd season of ""Wildfire"". Kris is expressing her frustration over yet another low point in the roller-coaster ride that is life in the world of ""Raintree Farm""; a horse ranch somewhere in California (but filmed in New Mexico). Everything is always a mess for the two families who inhabit this world of soapy overwrought melodrama, occasionally interrupted by a welcome horse race or rodeo. Like ""Weeds"" and ""Breaking Bad"", the world of ""Wildfire"" is one step forward and two steps back; as the writers desperately try to pump life into the series by subjecting the characters to a new adversity each episode.  I'm sure everyone's life would be better if the producers had come up with the cash to use the Michael Murphy song with the title sequence.""Wildfire"" ran for 51 hour-long episodes (2005-08) on the ABC Family Channel, and these seasons are now available on DVD. Dennis Weaver fans know of the series because it was his last television work. He appeared as a regular during the first season. Coincidentally his last appearance on this show was broadcast 50 years after the broadcast of his first appearance on ""Gunsmoke"".""Wildfire"" is a demographically specific series; an attempt to blend ""The Saddle Club"" and ""The O.C.""; with the addition of a J.R. Ewing character as the only thing that might pass for deliberate comic relief. So if you liked any of these shows you should probably check out it out. However, if you liked ""Saddle Club"" mostly for its friendship and character growth themes, you would be wise to give ""Wildfire"" a wide berth. The characters in ""Wildfire"" don't grow, they are too busy being in competition with each other and they become shallower and more tedious with each passing season.The series centers around four teenagers (played by actors old enough for their 10th high school reunions) and their two families, the financially insecure Ritter family and the rich Davis family. Kris is ostensibly a Ritter, at least she lives on their ranch and is constantly being told that she is a member of the family. Cortese is a rather limited actress but she has a natural likability and she looks cute in her jockey outfits (which thankfully hide her assorted tats), so you don't really mind that she is rarely able to sell her conflicted indecisive character.Nicole Tubiola and Ryan Sypek play Danielle and Junior Davis; the children of the J.R. based character (Ken Davis -nicely overplayed by James Read). They are both legitimate actors and are the strength of the series.Unintentional comic relief comes from the fourth teen, Matt Ritter. Matt is played by the talent-challenged Micah Alberti. One doesn't quite know whether to laugh or cringe as this poor guy struggles to get through each segment in which he appears. His scenes with Cortese are simply tedious, since both are so wooden these scenes have a sort of amateurish unity. Alberti is a truly creepy guy. A 20-something serial-killer creepy which he might be able to parlay into something useful in the horror genre (insert Ted Bundy here). But in ""Wildfire"" he is being asked to play wholesome and he falls so short of selling his character that it begins to have considerable amusement value.It is in Alberti's scenes with the legit actors that the talent disparity becomes painful and at times you actually feel embarrassed for him. Charlotte Salt and Amy Jo Johnson are probably the strongest actors in the entire ensemble. Their characters are semi-regulars who the writers inexplicably pair up with Alberti for a lot of great mockfest moments at his expense.The racing and rodeo scenes are nicely edited, cutting close-ups of the cast into actual races and grandstand master shots. It is not hard to suspend disbelief and just go with this stuff. Unfortunately these are only featured in a handful of episodes each season.The Lion's Gate DVD sets are nicely done, with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, some special features, and some commentary options.

But why so long in between the wait (in seasons) to get it on DVD. For Season 2 the wait seems endless and Season 4 is almost upon us.I've loved this show from the start as well; of course my deep fondness is of horses--that is the main attraction, but I think it's a good family-type show as well. But I am so sorry about the sudden passing of Dennis Weaver. He was such a great actor; he will be sorely missed. I was very sad about his death, but have good memories of him & of his work; Gunsmoke, McCloud, just to name a few...Anyway, getting back on track, Wildfire is a very good TV series and I hope it lasts for many more seasons to come.P.A.

Stewart ""moviemancritter""","[98, 103]","I don't get why the over review of this set gives the show just 1 star because it isn't the show he wanted it to be!Anyway, ""Wildfire"" was a show originally developed for the WB network that eventually became the first in a growing line of succesfull original drama series for the ABC Family Channel.  The show follows a girl, Kris, and focuses mainly on her transition from Juvenile Hall to the ranch life of Texas.  In order for her parole to be granted she is given a job as a ranch hand in an extremely posh and secretive community that raises and races horses.It is here that she, along with wildfire - a horse from her days in juvie - finally is able to shed her past and live like a normal teenager just trying to survive.  But that isn't made easy with all the drama surrounding her and her new soragate family.I will admit that the series starts out jumpy, but it really comes into its own halfway through the season and never lets up.  I missed the final three episodes on television and I cannot wait to revist this series and get caught up.

Also involved are a stoic trainer, a likeable kid, and a mixture of haves and have-nots from the local surroundings.I'm a bit puzzled as to why the young boy and Grandpa seem to flow in and out of the show, and why we should care so much about Dani's search for her mom.
