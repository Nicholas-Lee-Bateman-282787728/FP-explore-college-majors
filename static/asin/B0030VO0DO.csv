1315794,AIMR915K4YCN,B0030VO0DO,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[3, 3]","This 3-disc collection is worth the price. THE SKULL is a wonderfully gothic Peter Cushing / Christopher Lee vehicle w/ the eeevil, murderous SKULL (once belonging to the shoulders of the Marquis De Sade himself!) of the title. THE MAN WHO COULD CHEAT DEATH has Lee again, this time pitted against the immortal Anton Diffring, who must kill in order to live. The beautiful Hazel Court also stars. THE DEADLY BEES is a ridiculous yarn about killer honeybees on a rampage in a small village. Watch for the god-awful cropped-in bees as they swarm and sting! These hilarious ""special"" effects add to the overall dumb charm of this buzz-fest. All in all, a fantastic triple feature!...",5,Two Classics And One Howler...,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,680,"['3-disc', 'collection', 'price', 'SKULL', 'wonderfully', 'gothic', 'Peter', 'Cushing', '/', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'vehicle', 'w/', 'eeevil', 'murderous', 'SKULL', 'once', 'belonging', 'shoulders', 'Marquis', 'De', 'Sade', 'title', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'COULD', 'CHEAT', 'DEATH', 'Lee', 'again', 'time', 'pitted', 'immortal', 'Anton', 'Diffring', 'who', 'must', 'kill', 'order', 'live', 'beautiful', 'Hazel', 'Court', 'also', 'DEADLY', 'BEES', 'ridiculous', 'yarn', 'killer', 'honeybees', 'rampage', 'small', 'village', 'Watch', 'god-awful', 'cropped-in', 'bees', 'swarm', 'sting', 'hilarious', 'special', 'effects', 'add', 'overall', 'dumb', 'charm', 'buzz-fest', 'fantastic', 'triple', 'feature']","The Cult Horror Colection SET! - The Skull, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, & The Deadly Bees"

Hard to take these old films too seriously, and an example was the horrible bunch of bees that are attempting to terrorize a village-sort of reminded me of Hitchcock's The Birds. You will have fun with this one-highly recommended and a new addition to your Halloween DVD collection.",5,Couldn't resist those bees!!,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",2014,419,"['totally', 'delightful', 'collection', 'classic', 'cult', 'films', 'brought', 'together', 'one', 'set', 'entertainment', 'entertain', 'Hard', 'take', 'old', 'films', 'too', 'seriously', 'example', 'was', 'horrible', 'bunch', 'bees', 'are', 'attempting', 'terrorize', 'village-sort', 'reminded', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds', 'will', 'have', 'fun', 'one-highly', 'recommended', 'new', 'addition', 'Halloween', 'DVD', 'collection']","The Cult Horror Colection SET! - The Skull, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, & The Deadly Bees"

No subs.The man who could cheat death, very interesting. 3 viewsThe Skull I'm a big fan of Cushing and Lee, but I could care less if I saw this one again. 1 viewKiller bees, passable entertainment a bit patchy, so I'm most likely going to watch it again, but I give it 1 view. I have watched killer bees again and its better the second time around mostly for its excellent framing devices which are classic hammer style. It begins with the main actress doing a lip sync for a television broadcast, when she faints dead away the music continues ironically the lyrics are ""stop the music!"". Casting could have been better, the old guy is too young and has some hasty makeup.",3,generally worth watching,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,910,"['man', 'who', 'could', 'cheat', 'death', 'stand', 'out', 'killer', 'bees', 'was', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'bit', 'better', 'expected', 'skull', 'less', 'was', 'expected', 'quality', 'cast.No', 'complaints', 'disc', 'quality.Scant', 'extras', 'subs.The', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'cheat', 'death', 'very', 'interesting', '3', 'viewsThe', 'Skull', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Cushing', 'Lee', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'saw', 'one', 'again', '1', 'viewKiller', 'bees', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'bit', 'patchy', ""'m"", 'most', 'likely', 'going', 'watch', 'again', 'give', '1', 'view', 'have', 'watched', 'killer', 'bees', 'again', 'better', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'mostly', 'excellent', 'framing', 'devices', 'are', 'classic', 'hammer', 'style', 'main', 'actress', 'doing', 'lip', 'sync', 'television', 'broadcast', 'when', 'dead', 'away', 'music', 'ironically', 'lyrics', 'are', 'stop', 'music', 'Casting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'old', 'guy', 'too', 'young', 'hasty', 'makeup']","The Cult Horror Colection SET! - The Skull, The Man Who Could Cheat Death, & The Deadly Bees"

But what that means is they are stacked without their individual casings. Mine came with a small foam piece I guessed was meant to ""protect"" them.  This is not a good way to preserve discs of films you'd like to keep. They're too easily damaged. As far as the films are concerned, this is a good collection of British horror films. ""The Skull"" and the rarely seen ""Man Who Could Cheat Death"" being the standouts. The prints and sound are fine with the exception being ""Man Who Could Cheat Death"" which has the opening sequence too dark as the clearly bright titles roll over it, then the rest of the film is clear and nice if with somewhat muted colors. Overall, a good print of a fine film that could use remastering. If you like all three films, I'd suggest buying them seperately for safety reasons. But if you just want to save money, then this could be the way to go.
