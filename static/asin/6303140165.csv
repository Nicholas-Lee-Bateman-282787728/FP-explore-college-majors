So I watched it and I was disappointed partly because the daughter said her father caught a disease in Africa. Out of all the continents to catch a disease, why must it be Africa? According to the lie she told, her dad said it would've made sense to catch the disease in Europe because they had it in their Middle Ages. This was not funny to me. It just showed me how dumb she was. I wish movies, books, etc can be labelled, ""Not Africa-friendly."" This would make it a lot easier for people of African descent to stop being exposed to these negative things. I also found it disturbing that the daughter lied that her father was her lover. I didn't think this was funny, and I still don't. She crossed the line.

359705,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6303140165,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","MY DAD THE HERO (1994, Dir. Steve Miner, 90 minutes) is some genuinely touching work by G&eacute;rard Depardieu, which frankly could have phoned in his performance but carries it well anyway. And this is an enjoyable film because one can get a glimpse of the Depardieu who stole America's heart, even if it was only for a couple of years total. See my review of one of my personal favorites of his,The Pact of Silence(LE PACTE DU SILENCE).Here, Depardieu reprises his original role from three years earlier in the French film Mon p&egrave;re, ce h&eacute;ros, which I am now dying to see. I understand it got rave reviews over and above this unnecessary American remake. As I recall, the remake got some nasty jabs from critics who thought Depardieu was 'slumming', but I don't think that verb ever crosses the brains of actors.Depardieu plays the not-so-hapless-as-he-seems Andre, a divorced father who is on tenterhooks regarding his lover ... should he marry, shouldn't he marry. He embarks on a vacation in the West Indies on an undisclosed island (location, Bahamas) with his daughter, the beautiful Katherine Heigl (looks familiar and I sincerely hope she's learnt to act better).While on the trip, in pursuit of a boy, the daughter starts lying to him about the nature of her relationship with her father. Thanks to her, it gets round that he is her boyfriend. Depardieu's reaction is a wonderful restrained hysteria, and absolutely hilarious when he exclaims that now all the islanders think he's a child molester. The scenes in which that could have been milked for really good laughs are simply not there. What is there is comic genius.Dad's a hero frankly because he loves his daughter so much he'll do the impossible for her: go along with anything she dreams up, and even improvises when he has to. That man really loves his daughter. The pity in all this is I believe the talent is wasted on the silly onlooking extras - with the likes of Steve Tobolowsky spouting hilarious remarks about the romantic ways of Frenchmen.Anyway, this is a fine film for Depardieu's presence and for the fun that is lightened at every step. It reminds me a bit of the sophisticated TV comedies we occasionally see today, but do recall this is the early 1990s. Finally, the mysterious girlfriend in Andre's life, who remains unrevealed until the final scene, I will not spoil - but I LOVE her and this is near the start of her film career.Frankly you cannot go wrong with a film that has so much physical comedy from Depardieu and even a couple of homages to earlier roles that made him famous in America. I say get it for the general viewing section of your really good quality film collection.For reference, 1990'sCyrano de Bergeracwas Depardieu's big splash in America; this he followed up with the comedyGreen Cardin the same year and really became a double hit. in 1992 he participated in1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992) G&eacute;rard Depardieu, Armand Assante DVDin a most prominent role as cardinal; in 2001 he starred in the first real film shot with pure digital in which he played the title characterVidocq(a/k/a DARK PORTALS: CHRONICLES OF VIDOCQ, see my review). He always manages to somehow swashbuckle as he plumbs great emotional depths.He disappears for long terms because he does a LOT of TV work. I am most pleased to announce he has a ton of new projects, several in post-production and a few newly completed works such as his portrayal of Alexandre Dumas in 2010'sL'Autre Dumas (Original French Version with English Subtitles) Region 1. Naturally I squeal with delight at his cameos, most notably alongside Queen Latifah in 2006'sThe Last Holiday.",5,"Depardieu is a deep, effective comedian and great star of our age",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3662,"['MY', 'DAD', 'THE', 'HERO', '1994', 'Dir', 'Steve', 'Miner', '90', 'minutes', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'work', 'G', 'eacute', 'Depardieu', 'frankly', 'could', 'have', 'phoned', 'performance', 'well', 'anyway', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Depardieu', 'who', 'stole', 'America', 'heart', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'couple', 'years', 'total', 'See', 'review', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'Pact', 'Silence', 'LE', 'PACTE', 'DU', 'SILENCE', '.Here', 'Depardieu', 'original', 'role', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'French', 'film', 'Mon', 'p', 'egrave', 're', 'ce', 'h', 'eacute', 'ros', 'am', 'now', 'dying', 'see', 'understand', 'got', 'rave', 'reviews', 'unnecessary', 'American', 'remake', 'recall', 'remake', 'got', 'nasty', 'jabs', 'critics', 'who', 'thought', 'Depardieu', 'was', ""'slumming"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'verb', 'ever', 'brains', 'actors.Depardieu', 'not-so-hapless-as-he-seems', 'Andre', 'divorced', 'father', 'who', 'tenterhooks', 'regarding', 'lover', 'should', 'marry', 'should', ""n't"", 'marry', 'vacation', 'West', 'Indies', 'undisclosed', 'island', 'location', 'Bahamas', 'daughter', 'beautiful', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'familiar', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'learnt', 'act', 'better', '.While', 'trip', 'pursuit', 'boy', 'daughter', 'lying', 'nature', 'relationship', 'father', 'Thanks', 'round', 'boyfriend', 'Depardieu', 'reaction', 'wonderful', 'restrained', 'hysteria', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'when', 'now', 'islanders', 'think', 'child', 'molester', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'milked', 'really', 'good', 'laughs', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'What', 'comic', 'genius.Dad', 'hero', 'frankly', 'daughter', 'so', 'much', ""'ll"", 'do', 'impossible', 'go', 'anything', 'up', 'even', 'improvises', 'when', 'man', 'really', 'daughter', 'pity', 'believe', 'talent', 'wasted', 'silly', 'onlooking', 'extras', 'likes', 'Steve', 'Tobolowsky', 'spouting', 'hilarious', 'remarks', 'romantic', 'ways', 'Frenchmen.Anyway', 'fine', 'film', 'Depardieu', 'presence', 'fun', 'lightened', 'step', 'bit', 'sophisticated', 'TV', 'comedies', 'occasionally', 'see', 'today', 'do', 'recall', 'early', '1990s', 'Finally', 'mysterious', 'girlfriend', 'Andre', 'life', 'who', 'unrevealed', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'LOVE', 'start', 'film', 'career.Frankly', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Depardieu', 'even', 'couple', 'homages', 'earlier', 'roles', 'made', 'famous', 'America', 'say', 'get', 'general', 'viewing', 'section', 'really', 'good', 'quality', 'film', 'collection.For', 'reference', ""1990'sCyrano"", 'de', 'Bergeracwas', 'Depardieu', 'big', 'splash', 'America', 'followed', 'up', 'comedyGreen', 'Cardin', 'same', 'year', 'really', 'became', 'double', 'hit', '1992', 'participated', 'in1492', 'Conquest', 'Paradise', '1992', 'G', 'eacute', 'Depardieu', 'Armand', 'Assante', 'DVDin', 'most', 'prominent', 'role', 'cardinal', '2001', 'starred', 'first', 'real', 'film', 'shot', 'pure', 'digital', 'played', 'title', 'characterVidocq', 'a/k/a', 'DARK', 'PORTALS', 'CHRONICLES', 'VIDOCQ', 'see', 'review', 'always', 'somehow', 'swashbuckle', 'great', 'emotional', 'depths.He', 'disappears', 'long', 'terms', 'LOT', 'TV', 'work', 'am', 'most', 'pleased', 'announce', 'ton', 'new', 'projects', 'several', 'post-production', 'few', 'newly', 'completed', 'works', 'such', 'portrayal', 'Alexandre', 'Dumas', ""2010'sL'Autre"", 'Dumas', 'Original', 'French', 'Version', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'Region', '1', 'Naturally', 'squeal', 'delight', 'cameos', 'most', 'notably', 'alongside', 'Queen', 'Latifah', ""2006'sThe"", 'Last', 'Holiday']",My Father the Hero VHS

Depardieu plays nothing short of a lumbering buffoon.He is such an amazing dramatic actor who has graced the screen with portrayals of such legendary figures as DANTON,CYRANO de BERGERAC,COLONEL CHABERT,Jean Valjean in LES MISERABLES that this fluff is so far below him as a great actor; that said, though,Depardieu is funny and touching in his sensitive and comedic turn as Andre.It is no small wonder that Katherine Heigl has turned out to be one of the hottest stars on American television.You can see all of her potential here in looks and in depth of skill.This is an American remake of the French film MON PERE CE HERO.MY FATHER THE HERO is a fun 90 minute romp from Touchstone/Disney that will be enjoyed for the sheer entertainment of it all.Katherine Heigl's first film was THAT NIGHT and shows her at the age of eleven.It is a small role, but you will see the star power there! Depardieu has always been the greatest and should be seen in the above mentioned films for Americans who have not seen this magnificent Frenchman act.I also suggest A PURE FORMALITY,A LOVING FATHER,MOON IN THE GUTTER,JEAN de FLORETTE and ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD to view Depardieu in his Frenchiness ""magnifique"".His other American triumph was GREEN CARD opposite Andie MacDowell.",3,Lightweight comedy makes for sheer entertainment,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2247,"['nothing', 'earth-shatteringly', 'unique', 'MY', 'FATHER', 'THE', 'HERO.It', 'very', 'lightweight', 'comedy', 'concerns', 'relationship', 'Andre', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'headstrong', 'daughter', 'Nicole', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'attempt', 'reconnect', 'five', 'years', 'vacation', 'Tiki', 'resort.Nicole', 'nothing', 'short', 'cruel', 'manipulative', 'brat', 'Andre', 'trying', 're-establish', 'life', 'Nicole', 'attempting', 'decide', 'marriage', 'woman', 'been', 'seeing.Now', 'plot', 'film', 'pretty', 'flimsy', 'feature', 'France', 'best', 'known', 'actor', 'last', 'thirty', 'years', 'very', 'young', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'third', 'feature', 'film', 'long', 'before', 'T.V', 'ROSWELL', 'GREY', 'ANATOMY.Both', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'material', 'hand.The', 'most', 'convincing', 'scene', 'concerns', 'Depardieu', 'feeding', 'Heigl', 'romantic', 'lines', 'aka', 'Cyrano', 'de', 'Bergerac', 'order', 'capture', 'heart', 'beau', 'Dalton', 'James-whatever', 'happened', '..very', 'clever', 'convincing', 'Depardieu', 'nothing', 'short', 'lumbering', 'buffoon.He', 'such', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'who', 'graced', 'screen', 'portrayals', 'such', 'legendary', 'figures', 'DANTON', 'CYRANO', 'de', 'BERGERAC', 'COLONEL', 'CHABERT', 'Jean', 'Valjean', 'LES', 'MISERABLES', 'fluff', 'so', 'far', 'below', 'great', 'actor', 'said', 'Depardieu', 'funny', 'touching', 'sensitive', 'comedic', 'turn', 'Andre.It', 'small', 'wonder', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'hottest', 'stars', 'American', 'television.You', 'can', 'see', 'potential', 'here', 'looks', 'depth', 'skill.This', 'American', 'remake', 'French', 'film', 'MON', 'PERE', 'CE', 'HERO.MY', 'FATHER', 'THE', 'HERO', 'fun', '90', 'minute', 'romp', 'Touchstone/Disney', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'Heigl', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'THAT', 'NIGHT', 'age', 'eleven.It', 'small', 'role', 'will', 'see', 'star', 'power', 'there', 'Depardieu', 'always', 'been', 'greatest', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'above', 'mentioned', 'films', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'magnificent', 'Frenchman', 'act.I', 'also', 'suggest', 'PURE', 'FORMALITY', 'A', 'LOVING', 'FATHER', 'MOON', 'IN', 'THE', 'GUTTER', 'JEAN', 'de', 'FLORETTE', 'ALL', 'THE', 'MORNINGS', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'view', 'Depardieu', 'Frenchiness', 'magnifique', 'other', 'American', 'triumph', 'was', 'GREEN', 'CARD', 'opposite', 'Andie', 'MacDowell']",My Father the Hero VHS

359714,A1MB5HUA3WYEJC,6303140165,"Mike ""Movie Buff""","[1, 3]","""Oooooooohhhh nooooooooooooooo!""This was a very cute and enjoyable movie. Gerard Depardieu (The Man in the Iron Mask) was funny as the father of a teenage girl who is dealing with her parents being divorced and her father not always contactable. The teenager is played by the now stunning (and over 18) Katherine Heigl. Everytime my wife and I watch this movie, the infamous bathing suit that Nicole (Heigl) wears always starts us up on a conversation. When he backside is showing, I'm the first one to say that our daughter will not wear that until she's 30, and NO THONGS!!! LOL.The movie is basically about Andre (Depardieu) and Nicole going on a vacation to the Bahamas. Andre learns that his daughter is all grown up and is in that age where she will get agitated any second and fall in love just as fast. Nicole has been upset with Andre for a while but refuses to tell him why as she is also mad that he hasn't been around. Andre also has to figure out why his girlfriend, Isabelle, isn't speaking to him either. What complicates matters is the fact that during there vacation, everyone; both employees and fellow vacationers, think he is a pervert. This is due to the fact that Nicole had told a small little lie that Andre, her father, is actually her lover. This was to impress an older guy that she likes who happens to work at the hotel her and her father stay at. The fact is that this guy at first when he saw her near rocks on the shore ""treated her like a kid,"" telling her to not go on those rocks because it's dangerous---made her start her lies, first saying she was older than her actual age which was 14.
