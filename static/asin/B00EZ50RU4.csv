The only bad in it. Moving on...the story is typical, not much new here the drunken, down on his luck coach given one more chance to prove himself , done well by Josh Holloway. Caity Lotz as the dance teacher is terrific. The dancers are all superb and the routines and competitions though expected were all great. the stand out performance goes to Josh Peck....watch this guy, he's good and has done other good things.",5,Still not a hip-hop fan but so entergetic,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,563,"['Not', 'hip', 'hop', 'fan', 'here', 'so', 'said', '.I', 'thought', 'was', 'fun', 'energetic', 'One', 'question', 'why', 'God', 'name', 'was', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'only', 'bad', 'Moving', 'story', 'typical', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'drunken', 'down', 'luck', 'coach', 'given', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'prove', 'done', 'well', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'Caity', 'Lotz', 'dance', 'teacher', 'terrific', 'dancers', 'are', 'superb', 'routines', 'competitions', 'expected', 'were', 'great', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'Josh', 'Peck', '.watch', 'guy', 'good', 'done', 'other', 'good', 'things']",N/A
