Bindi Irwin was truly amazing as Kirra. It is so amazing how much she looks like her father, and carry's on his legacy through her knowledge of animals, and her love for them...which makes this even better, because you can tell her passion for animals is really genuine. I also thought the scenery was so beautiful, the acting by all the cast was excellent, and this movie ranks up there as being just as wonderful as the other Free Willy movies. I thought the ending was very powerful and emotional, that it made me cry. Hearing the song by Bindi Irwin while the credits were rolling were amazing, and I recoginized her voice immediately. Bindi Irwin seems so down-to-earth, like I said before a genuinly passionate person, and I hope she remains following in her father's footsteps.I am defintely going to buy it, and on blu-ray, so I get the highest quality, and so I can see the bonus features, because the one I  rented didn't have any on there.",5,Free Willy 4 didn't disappoint!,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,1037,"['4th', 'movie', 'Free', 'Willy', 'series', 'truly', 'delight', 'loved', 'minute', 'Bindi', 'Irwin', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'Kirra', 'so', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'father', 'carry', 'legacy', 'knowledge', 'animals', 'love', 'even', 'better', 'can', 'tell', 'passion', 'animals', 'really', 'genuine', 'also', 'thought', 'scenery', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'up', 'there', 'being', 'just', 'as', 'wonderful', 'other', 'Free', 'Willy', 'movies', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'made', 'cry', 'Hearing', 'song', 'Bindi', 'Irwin', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'were', 'amazing', 'recoginized', 'voice', 'immediately', 'Bindi', 'Irwin', 'so', 'down-to-earth', 'said', 'genuinly', 'passionate', 'person', 'hope', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps.I', 'am', 'defintely', 'going', 'buy', 'blu-ray', 'get', 'highest', 'quality', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'bonus', 'features', 'one', 'rented', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'there']",N/A
1329946,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0037RP0OE,Enjolras,"[1, 2]","I really liked Bindi Irwin as an actress. She is adorable and full of emotion. In the previous Free Willy movies, the whale was the star. InFree Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove, Bindi steals the screen. One can definitely detect her voice - and her father's - in quotes like, ""Just because they use big words doesn't mean they're experts."" One thing I really like is that the film shows Bindi doing scientific research to learn how to save Willy - a nice role model for other kids.However, at times, I thought the movie's pacing was a bit slow and off. When Bindi wasn't on screen, it was hard to pay attention. Unfortunately, the rest of the case and movie doesn't match Bindi's energy.Most of Orcas were computer-generated, at least for the underwater scenes. I guess some fans might be disappointed - after all, this isn't quite as exciting as a real whale. However, considering the stress that captivity causes real Orcas - as well as all of the trouble filming live Orcas caused in the prior Free Willy movies - I can understand that decision.Overall, a cute movie for kids and fans of Bindi Irwin. It won't be a classic, but it could launch her on an acting career.",4,"Bindi's great, but sometimes it's a bit slow",1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,1172,"['really', 'liked', 'Bindi', 'Irwin', 'actress', 'adorable', 'full', 'emotion', 'previous', 'Free', 'Willy', 'movies', 'whale', 'was', 'star', 'InFree', 'Willy', 'Escape', 'Pirate', 'Cove', 'Bindi', 'screen', 'One', 'can', 'definitely', 'detect', 'voice', 'father', 'quotes', 'Just', 'use', 'big', 'words', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'experts', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'like', 'film', 'Bindi', 'doing', 'scientific', 'research', 'learn', 'how', 'save', 'Willy', 'nice', 'role', 'model', 'other', 'kids.However', 'times', 'thought', 'movie', 'pacing', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'off', 'When', 'Bindi', 'was', ""n't"", 'screen', 'was', 'hard', 'pay', 'attention', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'case', 'movie', ""n't"", 'match', 'Bindi', 'energy.Most', 'Orcas', 'were', 'computer-generated', 'least', 'underwater', 'scenes', 'guess', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'exciting', 'real', 'whale', 'However', 'considering', 'stress', 'captivity', 'causes', 'real', 'Orcas', 'as', 'well', 'trouble', 'filming', 'live', 'Orcas', 'caused', 'prior', 'Free', 'Willy', 'movies', 'can', 'understand', 'decision.Overall', 'cute', 'movie', 'kids', 'fans', 'Bindi', 'Irwin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'classic', 'could', 'launch', 'acting', 'career']",N/A
1329947,A1CHM200OEN65X,B0037RP0OE,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[2, 2]","Another ""Free Willy"" movie? Oh, brother. That was my initial reaction. When I discovered, however, that Bindi Irwin would be starring in it, I became intrigued. I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, attended the same school as Terri Irwin, and my heart has been linked to their family since Steve Irwin's early success as ""The Crocodile Hunter"" and the later tragedy of his death. How could I not give this movie a chance?The story is quick-moving and fun-spirited. Bindi is a young girl from Australia whose father gets hurt in an accident. She is forced to go spend six weeks in Capetown, South Africa, with her estranged grandfather, the father of her deceased mother. Beau Bridges plays his role well, giving it a few moments of goofiness and some heartfelt scenes. He and his granddaughter do not hit it off right away. In fact, he is a gambling, unmotivated fellow who runs a downtrodden theme park. A storm brings the theme park an unexpected surprise, though, in the form of a young Orca. ""Willy"" becomes the catalyst for a granddaughter/grandfather relationship, as well as the source of rivalry and conflict from a bigger, better theme park.The movie has some funny moments and some incredible scenery from the Capetown area. Beau and Bindi give the film a lot of heart. There are one or two slapstick moments, but overall it remains focused on its young female star and her desire to care for animals even while winning over her crusty, but good-natured grandpa. The only real weakness is the use of simulated underwater Orca scenes. They might work well in an aquarium presentation, but they don't do well in a film. And they seemed unnecessary, considering the very real Orca used throughout the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by ""Free Will: Escape from Pirate's Cove."" It has a message about preserving nature, without getting too preachy about it. It makes good use of adorable and likable Bindi, and it shows that Beau Bridges still has some life in his acting career.
