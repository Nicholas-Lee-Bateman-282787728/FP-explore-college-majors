M.""","[0, 0]","Some will not like the culture education but it really shows the differences and similarity in how it all comes down to being human. No matter what your ethnicity, size, sexuality, or religion, we all crave acceptance. Without acceptance the pain is often numbing and paralyzing to the one considered the outsider. These actors portray this very well and you feel their pain. I recommend watching this and opening your heart and mind.",5,I liked it,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,434,"['will', 'not', 'like', 'culture', 'education', 'really', 'differences', 'similarity', 'how', 'down', 'being', 'human', 'matter', 'what', 'ethnicity', 'size', 'sexuality', 'religion', 'crave', 'acceptance', 'acceptance', 'pain', 'often', 'numbing', 'paralyzing', 'one', 'considered', 'outsider', 'actors', 'portray', 'very', 'well', 'feel', 'pain', 'recommend', 'watching', 'opening', 'heart', 'mind']",N/A

1574539,A34B3AAKD6C0NR,B008R6U69Y,Nanci,"[1, 1]","One is abt to join a man in an arranged marriage and expects a fairy tale life.  One is a repressed lesbian trying to come to terms with urges that her culture demonizes.  The third is struggling to overcome the incestuous sexual abuse that still haunts her.  All are students on the same college campus but engage each other from different direction, and each sees her interaction with the others in a very personal and individual viewpoint.  Very interesting to see how their personalities color their perceptions of the same situation.  A good reminder that we all have demons that only we can see when we work so hard to hide them.  All in all, satisfying and uplifting, and I watch this fairly often for that reminder to be kinder to our fellow humans.",4,"Three girls, three viewpoints",1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,757,"['One', 'abt', 'join', 'man', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'fairy', 'tale', 'life', 'One', 'repressed', 'lesbian', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'urges', 'culture', 'demonizes', 'third', 'struggling', 'overcome', 'incestuous', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'still', 'are', 'students', 'same', 'college', 'campus', 'engage', 'other', 'different', 'direction', 'interaction', 'others', 'very', 'personal', 'individual', 'viewpoint', 'Very', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'personalities', 'color', 'perceptions', 'same', 'situation', 'good', 'reminder', 'have', 'demons', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'work', 'so', 'hard', 'hide', 'satisfying', 'uplifting', 'watch', 'fairly', 'often', 'reminder', 'be', 'kinder', 'fellow', 'humans']",N/A
