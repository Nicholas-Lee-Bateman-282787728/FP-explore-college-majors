Season 3 is another must buy season, and I'm so happy Warner Archive is keeping the series going on dvd. Growing Pains never gets aired in reruns anymore so it's great to have the complete uncut episodes of another season on dvd! The picture quality is quite good and better than season 2's dvd. The audio's very good too.Growing Pains season 3 was a top 10 show in ratings back in the 80's and for a good reason! All the episodes are lots of fun and very funny. This dvd is well worth owning and hopefully we get the remaining seasons very soon.

1651307,A3MGKU008K95W9,B00CVB6XDO,"Christopher ""chris c""","[0, 0]","All anyone talks about is the fact that the series is on MOD instead of standard DVD. I don't really know if that is a reflection on Growing Pains popularity or sales... Warner's is releasing some of the all time great classic films in this format as well. Titles which would (or should) sell at retail... here is the thing - like CD's people are not buying DVD's anymore. Blue Ray to some extent but even those aren't selling record numbers... People are streaming everything and when it comes to television consumers expect these series to be on Netflix or Amazon Prime or Hulu etc... I don't think MOD v DVD should be a topic of conversation tho, nor should Streaming/DIgital v Hard copy media (I am a CD/DVD guy myself) - the topic should be the show and this show quite simply makes me feel like a kid again. Wholesome innocent fun with a family of actors I felt I knew. Of course like all shows Growing Pains suffered as the kids grew up but this season - like seasons 1 and 2, does not suffer from that particular problem. I always preferred this show to it's contemporaries (Family Ties, Cosby's etc) something about these characters and the chemistry between the actors just worked for me. This is the show in its prime and if you grew up watching it, as I did, it will make you feel great - and take you back to a simpler time, pre-internet, pre-cell phone, and pre-facebook,  - back to a time when people spoke to each other and weren't expected to be logged in or connected 27/7 - when we had time to live life.",5,Special Series for kids growing up in the 80's,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,1523,"['anyone', 'talks', 'fact', 'series', 'MOD', 'instead', 'standard', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'reflection', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'popularity', 'sales', 'Warner', 'releasing', 'time', 'great', 'classic', 'films', 'format', 'as', 'well', 'Titles', 'would', 'should', 'sell', 'retail', 'here', 'thing', 'CD', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'buying', 'DVD', 'anymore', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'extent', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'selling', 'record', 'numbers', 'People', 'are', 'streaming', 'everything', 'when', 'television', 'consumers', 'expect', 'series', 'be', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Hulu', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'MOD', 'v', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'topic', 'conversation', 'tho', 'should', 'Streaming/DIgital', 'v', 'Hard', 'copy', 'media', 'am', 'CD/DVD', 'guy', 'topic', 'should', 'be', 'show', 'show', 'quite', 'simply', 'feel', 'kid', 'again', 'Wholesome', 'innocent', 'fun', 'family', 'actors', 'felt', 'knew', 'course', 'shows', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'suffered', 'kids', 'grew', 'up', 'season', 'seasons', '1', '2', 'not', 'suffer', 'particular', 'problem', 'always', 'preferred', 'show', 'contemporaries', 'Family', 'Ties', 'Cosby', 'etc', 'something', 'characters', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'just', 'worked', 'show', 'prime', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'did', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'great', 'take', 'back', 'simpler', 'time', 'pre-internet', 'pre-cell', 'phone', 'pre-facebook', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'people', 'spoke', 'other', 'were', ""n't"", 'expected', 'be', 'logged', 'connected', '27/7', 'when', 'had', 'time', 'live', 'life']",N/A
