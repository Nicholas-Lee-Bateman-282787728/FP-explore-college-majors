505309,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B00000IYRF,Brad Baker,"[16, 16]","Louise Brooks flashed across the magic flickering Silver Screen for oh so brief a moment, only to fall back into almost forgotten lost history.  &quot;Louise Brooks: Looking For Lulu&quot; is a earnest documentary hosted by Shirley MacLaine.  It features clips from her dazzling early career, her spotty movie roles, and amazingly, an interview with the once notorious super-star herself. The bouncy teen from Kansas landed in Hollywood in the early 1920's ready to change the world. Her defiant, trenchant attitude didn't suit the studio bosses, but Paramount Pictures smelled stardom, and signed her immediately. Several bouncy roles followed, all featuring the black-haired vixen with the special coif. But Louise's temprament soon pushed her away from the meaty film roles she might have attained. She went to Berlin in 1926 to star in a dark tragedy for German director G.W. Pabst. She portrayed a flighty young dancer, romancing lovers, young and old, rich and penniless. She stands trial for an accidental murder, which occurs during one of her trysts. The proceedings go poorly, and she flees to London, with her young companion, played by Francis Lederer. Her life soon descends into poverty and despair, ending with a fateful meeting with none other than Jack the Ripper. The movie is rich in mood and mystery, featuring an ealy lesbian relationship(banned in the United States).  The film was called &quot;Pandora's Box&quot;. Brooks's last film(in 1937) was as a b-film co-star in a cowboy movie starring a newcomer named John Wayne. Brooks life took a turn for the worse as well. Her final interview, years later in a Manhattan flat, is breathtaking. Re-discovered by cinema historian James Card, Brooks served out her final days with grace and dignity. This marvelous DVD presents an accurate re-telling of the Hollywood career, and it's eventual pitfalls. Louise Brooks is a cinema icon. Would that this halcyon star might shine forever.",4,LULU WE LOVE YOU,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,1952,"['Louise', 'Brooks', 'flashed', 'magic', 'flickering', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'oh', 'so', 'brief', 'moment', 'only', 'fall', 'back', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'lost', 'history', 'quot', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'Looking', 'Lulu', 'quot', 'earnest', 'documentary', 'hosted', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'clips', 'dazzling', 'early', 'career', 'spotty', 'movie', 'roles', 'amazingly', 'interview', 'once', 'notorious', 'super-star', 'herself', 'bouncy', 'teen', 'Kansas', 'landed', 'Hollywood', 'early', '1920', 'ready', 'change', 'world', 'defiant', 'trenchant', 'attitude', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'studio', 'bosses', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'smelled', 'stardom', 'signed', 'immediately', 'Several', 'bouncy', 'roles', 'followed', 'featuring', 'black-haired', 'vixen', 'special', 'coif', 'Louise', 'temprament', 'soon', 'pushed', 'away', 'meaty', 'film', 'roles', 'might', 'have', 'attained', 'went', 'Berlin', '1926', 'star', 'dark', 'tragedy', 'German', 'director', 'G.W', 'Pabst', 'portrayed', 'flighty', 'young', 'dancer', 'romancing', 'lovers', 'young', 'old', 'rich', 'penniless', 'trial', 'accidental', 'murder', 'one', 'trysts', 'proceedings', 'go', 'poorly', 'London', 'young', 'companion', 'played', 'Francis', 'Lederer', 'life', 'soon', 'poverty', 'despair', 'ending', 'fateful', 'meeting', 'none', 'other', 'Jack', 'Ripper', 'movie', 'rich', 'mood', 'mystery', 'featuring', 'ealy', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'banned', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'was', 'called', 'quot', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'quot', 'Brooks', 'last', 'film', '1937', 'was', 'b-film', 'co-star', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'starring', 'newcomer', 'named', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Brooks', 'life', 'took', 'turn', 'worse', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'interview', 'years', 'later', 'Manhattan', 'flat', 'breathtaking', 'Re-discovered', 'cinema', 'historian', 'James', 'Card', 'Brooks', 'served', 'out', 'final', 'days', 'grace', 'dignity', 'marvelous', 'DVD', 'accurate', 're-telling', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'eventual', 'pitfalls', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'cinema', 'icon', 'Would', 'halcyon', 'star', 'might', 'shine', 'forever']",Louise Brooks - Looking for Lulu

505311,AV3M53Y6XEP30,B00000IYRF,Jesmat,"[4, 4]","'Looking For Lulu' is a well made documentary of silent star Louise  Brooks. The film's makers have used the one hour running time to very good  effect - there is no padding or wasted time on this DVD. The documentary is  written by Barry Paris who has also penned highly acclaimed books of this  great actress. But of course 60 minutes is not long enough to fully cover  Ms Brooks' career, let alone her entire life. Ideally, I would have liked  to see a documentary twice this length, but the hour we do get is extremely  interesting. Shirley MacLaine does a fine job narrating the DVD, which is  also scattered with movie clips, photos and anecdotes from those who knew  Louise Brooks. The most fascinating feature is interview clips of Louise  herself - filmed in 1976 when Ms Brooks was in her late sixties. These are  quite revealing. On the technical side, I was slightly disappointed by the  DVD's (lack of) special features. The only extra feature is a filmography -  just a list of Louise Brooks' films with no additional information given.  What would have made this disc really special is a gallery showing the  photos used in the documentary plus any others the makers could get their  hands on. One other aspect of the DVD that leaves you wanting more is the  picture quality of some of the old silent film clips - they are truly  exceptional. There is clearly the potential for video companies to release  high quality prints of Louise Brooks' work. Let's hope some of her films  appear on DVD soon.",4,Good biography that leaves you wanting more,965692800,"08 8, 2000",2000,1514,"[""'Looking"", 'Lulu', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'silent', 'star', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'used', 'one', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'very', 'good', 'effect', 'padding', 'wasted', 'time', 'DVD', 'documentary', 'written', 'Barry', 'Paris', 'who', 'also', 'penned', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'books', 'great', 'actress', 'course', '60', 'minutes', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'fully', 'cover', 'Ms', 'Brooks', 'career', 'let', 'alone', 'entire', 'life', 'Ideally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'documentary', 'twice', 'length', 'hour', 'do', 'get', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'fine', 'job', 'narrating', 'DVD', 'also', 'scattered', 'movie', 'clips', 'photos', 'anecdotes', 'who', 'knew', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'most', 'fascinating', 'feature', 'interview', 'clips', 'Louise', 'filmed', '1976', 'when', 'Ms', 'Brooks', 'was', 'late', 'sixties', 'are', 'quite', 'revealing', 'technical', 'side', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'only', 'extra', 'feature', 'filmography', 'just', 'list', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'films', 'additional', 'information', 'given', 'What', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'disc', 'really', 'special', 'gallery', 'showing', 'photos', 'used', 'documentary', 'others', 'makers', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'One', 'other', 'aspect', 'DVD', 'wanting', 'more', 'picture', 'quality', 'old', 'silent', 'film', 'clips', 'are', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'clearly', 'potential', 'video', 'companies', 'release', 'high', 'quality', 'prints', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'work', 'Let', 'hope', 'films', 'appear', 'DVD', 'soon']",Louise Brooks - Looking for Lulu
505312,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00000IYRF,M. Oleson,"[0, 0]","I became fascinated with Louise Brooks after seeing her in perhaps her best known film, ""Pandora's Box.""  Frankly I didn't know anything about her but after seeing her in another German film with the same director, ""Diary Of A Lost Girl,"" I decided to look further into her fascinating career.  This 60 minute documentary produced by Turner Classic Movies and Hugh Hefner was directed by Hugh Munro Neely.  It is a well-paced film that looks into Brook's early life as a dancer and film actress and concludes with an interesting interview from 1976.In Hollywood, she was primarily cast in small roles, but did have the lead in a few.  Certainly an independent woman, Brooks was known for speaking her mind and having a good time.  Both got her in trouble with mainstream Hollywood.  Her first big opportunity came when German filmmaker G. W. Pabst cast her as Lulu, a sexy but somewhat innocent girl whose life takes a tragic turn.When Brooks returned to Hollywood, she was all but ignored.  She took several years off before returning to the screen with secondary roles and made her last film in 1938.  IMdB shows she only made 24 films after her 1925 debut.  Brooks certainly must be heralded as one of the best actresses of her time, but by her own admission, often bucked the system.  The documentary, narrated by Shirley McClain offers some insight into this provocative star.  Brooks herself provides some first-hand info in some rare clips from a 1976 interview, some 9 years before her death at age 78.Note, that this documentary is also included in the Criterion DVD of ""Pandora's Box.""",4,A brief look into the life of one of film's most beautiful and facinating stars,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1595,"['became', 'fascinated', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'seeing', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'film', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'Frankly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'seeing', 'German', 'film', 'same', 'director', 'Diary', 'A', 'Lost', 'Girl', 'decided', 'look', 'further', 'fascinating', 'career', '60', 'minute', 'documentary', 'produced', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'was', 'directed', 'Hugh', 'Munro', 'Neely', 'well-paced', 'film', 'Brook', 'early', 'life', 'dancer', 'film', 'actress', 'interesting', 'interview', '1976.In', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'primarily', 'cast', 'small', 'roles', 'did', 'have', 'lead', 'few', 'Certainly', 'independent', 'woman', 'Brooks', 'was', 'known', 'speaking', 'mind', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'got', 'trouble', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'big', 'opportunity', 'came', 'when', 'German', 'filmmaker', 'G.', 'W.', 'Pabst', 'cast', 'Lulu', 'sexy', 'somewhat', 'innocent', 'girl', 'life', 'tragic', 'turn.When', 'Brooks', 'returned', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'ignored', 'took', 'several', 'years', 'returning', 'screen', 'secondary', 'roles', 'made', 'last', 'film', '1938', 'IMdB', 'only', 'made', '24', 'films', '1925', 'debut', 'Brooks', 'certainly', 'must', 'be', 'heralded', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'time', 'own', 'admission', 'often', 'bucked', 'system', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Shirley', 'McClain', 'insight', 'provocative', 'star', 'Brooks', 'first-hand', 'info', 'rare', 'clips', '1976', 'interview', '9', 'years', 'death', 'age', '78.Note', 'documentary', 'also', 'included', 'Criterion', 'DVD', 'Pandora', 'Box']",Louise Brooks - Looking for Lulu

505314,A37S3ACL57LN62,B00000IYRF,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 3]","Louise Brooks is often looked over because of her nonchalance about acting and her career. She was a very intelligent woman who was known for her intense sexuality. She made several films, the most important ones being made in Germany like Pandora's Box. Her career was ended when the talkies came, not because her voice did not record well but because she was so arrogant to the studios. Years after she stopped making films, she wrote a series of essays compiled into a book called Lulu in Hollywood which helped to rejuvenate her career.This documentary is great for novice Brooks fans because it touches on basic information like her early life, transitioning into films, and the end of her career. It does not, however, provide much insight into who Brooks was as a person or truly why she behaved the way she did. It is certainly not a deep exploration into her character or her career.
