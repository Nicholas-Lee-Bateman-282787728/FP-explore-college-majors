97777,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790731886,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","This is one of those surprisingly delightful films that rarely gets the attention it deserves yet for some reason got that attention.  Watching the movie I was floored at the fact that it won two Oscars and was nominated for more.  It just does not feel like an Academy movie at all, with over the top yet resoundingly sincere performances that just don't seem like the type the Academy would recognize, and yet Dudley Moore found himself an Oscar nominee and John Gielgud actually WON the Oscar.The film is an entertaining little comedy about a rich young heir named Arthur who falls in love with a struggling actress named Linda.  She loves him despite his money, but his father is adamant that he marry another woman.  With the threat of losing his money, Arthur relies on his trusty butler to help him make the right decisions and ultimately `get the girl'.It's a feel good movie, nothing more nothing less.That doesn't overshadow the fact that it is a wonderful movie.  Just because it isn't as deep as you may want your Oscar fare to be doesn't mean that it isn't worthy of all the praise and adoration it has received.  It is wonderfully constructed, wildly entertaining and is memorable to boot.  You could watch this movie over and over and never tire of it; that is for sure.The acting is also a nice touch.  John Gielgud is the standout, and the Oscar he has proves that.  He is witty and sharp and heart touching to boot.  Dudley Moore, in my opinion, also should have won the Oscar.  Sure he was up against dramatic heavy weights like Warren Beatty and Henry Fonda but seriously, his pitch perfect comedic timing is flawless and needed to be recognized.  He plays the majority of the film drunk yet he never lapses into mediocre repetition but is constantly fresh and his performance is beyond rewarding.  Liza Minnelli is decent here, but she falls to the wayside when you consider her leading man.  Still, she has talent and that charismatic touch that elevates her performance.It's witty, charming, touching and most importantly unforgettable.

97778,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,0790731886,andy8047,"[2, 7]","Back in the 70's,British-born Dudley Moore was little known to the American public even when he supported Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn in the 1978 Paramount film FOUL PLAY. The following year,he co-starred with Bo Derek in ""10"",which was his first starring American film. The disappointing WHOLLY MOSES followed in 1980. That same year,Moore did this film with Liza Minelli,daughter of the late Judy Garland. It was filmed in New York City and was theatrically released in July 1981. Moore won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Bach,a drunk millionaire who goes broke. Arthur is engaged to Susan Johnson(pre-L.A. Law Jill Eikenberry) but the engagement is broken and Arthur's money is taken away by Susan's father. In one of the first scenes,Arthur spends the night at his apartment with a hooker named Gloria. Then Arthur meets Linda,a diner waitress(Minelli) in a department store where she is shoplifting. Arthur and Linda hook up immediately. But the wedding between Arthur and Susan almost happened. Susan was dressed in her wedding gown and Arthur tells her at the very last minute that he's in love with Linda. Susan's father enters the chapel and beats the crap out of Arthur. The movie soundtrack album has been long out-of-print(it was never re-issued on CD). It features ARTHUR'S THEME(Best That You Can Do) performed by Christopher Cross. That song is available on some CD compilations and was one of 1981's top hits. For the next eleven years,Moore relentlessly made movies such as SIX WEEKS with Mary Tyler Moore,UNFAITHFULLY YOURS,BEST DEFENSE with Eddie Murphy,LIKE FATHER LIKE SON with Kirk Cameron,LOVESICK with Elizabeth McGovern,MICKI & MAUDE with Amy Irving and Ann Reinking,CRAZY PEOPLE with Daryl Hannah,BLAME IT ON THE BELLBOY and of course,ARTHUR 2:ON THE ROCKS with Minnelli. ARTHUR 2 was theatrically released in 1988 and wasn't as successful as the first film. Sadly,Dudley passed away in March 2002 of complications from diabetes. He was 66. I dedicate this film to his memory. Also in ARTHUR 2,Cynthia Sikes resumed the role of Susan Johnson since Eikenberry was immersed in L.A. LAW.",5,Wholly Moses!

And even thogh three of its key elements have passed on (director Steve Gordon, John Gielgud and Dudley Moore), it still remains heartwarming and rediculously funny.Moore plays Arthur Bach, a very rich and usually very drunk playboy. He lives in a posh Manhattan mansion with his faithful and wise butler Hobson (John Gielgud in an Oscar - winning role). Arthur enjoys taking long baths, playing with toys, and drinking. But he may inherit 750 million dollars a wealthy Long Island blond. There's one loophole in this plan: Linda Marolla (Liza Manelli in her best screen role since ""Cabaret""), a waitress who captures Arthur's heart while shoplifting.

While many comedies revolve around the cruel ridicule of certain parties, this is a MAJOR exception. We meet the millionaire Dudley Moore who seems to be a heavy drinker. But is he a drinker by nature? Perhaps not. His father wants him to marry Susan, (who he doesn't love) for financial reasons. Later, Arthur meets the poor (but likable) Linda. While Arthur seems to know that there are some things that money can't buy, he is realizing he may seem to know real love. In his small role, Linda's father goes from suspecting Linda's dating life to cheering it. But if we want to understand him, he probably doesn't want to think of his daughter being destitute after he dies.While Arthur loves Linda, he is afraid of being disinherited and has to make a choice between love (Linda) and money (Susan). Geraldine Fitzgerald tries to make the choice easy. She says to marry Susan and cheat with Linda, but Arthur can not do that.The character who steals the movie is John Gielgud as Arthur's servant.  At first, he seems to abhor Arthur for his heavy drinking and self absorption. (Much like a father would be annoyed by his son at a young age.) One of his most memorable lines is: ""Arthur, if you feel unloved, welcome to the world."" But is he so unfeeling? Realizing he may not be around much longer, he explains to Linda that he won't be around much longer, and he asks Linda to take his role.The most wonderful thing about this movie is that portrays the transition one goes through from the love a 'father' has for his 'son,' to the love  a man shares with a woman.There is an interesting mix of suspense, menace, comedy, and a happy ending.

I first saw Dudley Moore in ""Foul Play,"" thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought ""10"" and ""Arthur,"" as it turned out a downward trajectory.What I dislike about ""Arthur"" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in ""The Loved One"" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes.

The screen relationship between these two was played to such perfection that both men earned Oscar nominations, and Gielgud deservingly walked home with the statue.In retrospect, there is so much more to like about the movie now than there was more than 20 years ago. Arthur is someone who our society has taught us to abhor -- a wealthy, drunk womanizer who seemingly takes every opportunity to drive under the influence. And yet we love him. He's witty, he's cute (as Liza Minnelli opines, &quot;Like one of Santa's helpers) -- and yet's a lot like most of us, searching for the someone inside of him who someone else can love. Steve Gordon, who tragically died less than a year after this film was released, created the perfect blend of humor, romance and drama. The result is something which can be watched again and again, and which somehow never gets old.Everything about Arthur is incredible, from the Oscar-winning theme song to the finely-honed screenplay to the myriad of wonderful performances.

Always a great actor, Moore plays the part of Arthur, the spoiled son of a multimillionaire, to perfection. Arthur has never had to work a day in his life, and it shows. He spends his days playing with his toys and racing his cars and his nights drinking and carousing. However, his father insists that he marry the daughter of his business rival or else he will be cut off from the family inheritance. There's only one problem. Arthur doesn't love the girl. Instead, he falls in love with Linda Marolla (Liza Minelli), a girl from a working-class family who also happens to be a shoplifter.Second, the acting of Arthur's caretaker, Hobson (Sir John Gielgud) and Liza Minelli is also outstanding. Gielgud, in particular, comes as close to perfection in this movie as is humanly possible. (He won an Oscar for his role in this film.)Finally, the movie is hilarious, with more funny one-liners than is possible to count.This is a true classic and one worth watching again if you haven't done so for a long time.

97799,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0790731886,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","This 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director Steve Gordon and stars Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. Sadly, Gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. It's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. It plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. The plot centers on Arthur Bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring Susan Johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. Of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into Linda Marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a Bergdorf Goodman tie for her father.The standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic &eacute;lan by Moore. That he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to Gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as Hobson, Arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. It's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but Gielgud makes Hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. In probably her most likable film role, Liza Minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making Linda quite genuine in motivation.A pre-""LA Law"" Jill Eikenberry plays Susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while Barney Martin (Jerry's dad on ""Seinfeld"") steals all his scenes as Linda's slovenly father Ralph. The one fly in the ointment is veteran actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. And I have to admit that I still can't stand the very dated, overplayed Christopher Cross song that inevitably won the Oscar for that year's best song. Unfortunately, the 1997 DVD, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.",4,Still a Charmer a Quarter Century Later Especially for the Well-Missed Talents of Moore and Gielgud,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2198,"['1981', 'comedy', 'still', 'thanks', 'combined', 'efforts', 'writer/director', 'Steve', 'Gordon', 'stars', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'Sadly', 'Gordon', 'only', 'early', 'forties', 'died', 'soon', 'completing', 'only', 'feature', 'film', 'especially', 'unfortunate', 'loss', 'truly', 'deft', 'hand', 'character-driven', 'farce', 'whole', 'film', 'irresistible', 'almost', ""1930's-style"", 'screwball', 'comedy', 'revamped', 'contemporary', 'tastes', 'plot', 'centers', 'Arthur', 'Bach', 'drunken', 'diminutive', 'millionaire', 'playboy', 'who', 'risk', 'losing', '750', 'million', 'inheritance', ""n't"", 'marry', 'dowdy', 'boring', 'Susan', 'Johnson', 'heiress', 'handpicked', 'old-money', 'father', 'dotty', 'grandmother', 'course', ""n't"", 'love', 'chance', 'Linda', 'Marolla', 'working-class', 'waitress', 'course', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'Bergdorf', 'Goodman', 'tie', 'father.The', 'standard', 'complications', 'ensue', 'most', 'endearing', 'way', 'loads', 'alcohol-fueled', 'slapstick', 'executed', 'classic', 'eacute', 'lan', 'Moore', 'spoiled', 'character', 'likable', 'credit', 'not', 'only', 'comic', 'talents', 'Gielgud', 'feisty', 'acidic', 'turn', 'Hobson', 'Arthur', 'devoted', 'reality-grounded', 'valet', 'type', 'role', 'could', 'play', 'sleep', 'Gielgud', 'Hobson', 'truly', 'memorable', 'character', 'fate', 'film', 'welcome', 'injection', 'poignancy', 'proceedings', 'probably', 'most', 'likable', 'film', 'role', 'Liza', 'Minnelli', 'picture', 'male', 'co-stars', 'toning', 'down', 'usual', 'razzle-dazzle', 'personality', 'making', 'Linda', 'quite', 'genuine', 'motivation.A', 'pre-', 'LA', 'Law', 'Jill', 'Eikenberry', 'Susan', 'just', 'right', 'passive-aggressive', 'note', 'Barney', 'Martin', 'Jerry', 'dad', 'Seinfeld', 'scenes', 'Linda', 'slovenly', 'father', 'Ralph', 'one', 'fly', 'ointment', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Geraldine', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'eccentricities', 'grandmother', 'have', 'admit', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'very', 'dated', 'overplayed', 'Christopher', 'Cross', 'song', 'inevitably', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'best', 'song', 'Unfortunately', '1997', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'need', 'remastering', 'extras', 'worth', 'noting', 'photos', 'production', 'notes']",N/A

The script is poor and the jokes age very, very poorly too.  The only exception for some reason seems to be Sir John Gielgud's lines which were able to raise a chuckle or two from me and his was the only redeeming acting feature from this film.  ""That"" song was another redeeming feature written as it was by the great Burt Bacharach but otherwise, this is a poor excuse for a comedy and actually a poor excuse for a film.I actually enjoyed Dudley Moore's performance as a guest on ""The Muppet Show"" a whole lot better than his work here as he seems woefully miscast here.  I can't understand how the script can be so unbalanced and it seems as if only Gielgud was reading his lines while Moore and Minnelli seemed to be making it up as they went along.  I truly struggle to recall the last time I watched such a boring and totally uninspiring film.Not that this matters given the lousy content but this dvd version is also very, very poor.  It hasn't been restored or remastered and so the picture quality is average at best while the sound quality is pathetic; it was so soft volume wise and even when you increase the volume a lot higher than you'd usually do for other dvds the quality is still so poor that you have to struggle at times to hear the dialogue but in the case this film I guess you could say that it's a blessing here.Very bad film, even worse quality dvd makes this a very highly not recommended film.

He takes Gloria to his favorite restaurant for dinner and embarrasses his wealthy Aunt (Justine Johnston) and Uncle (Maurice Copeland) there.The next morning, a train set circles a bedroom. It is Arthur in bed with his overnite guest. His butler, Hobson (Sir John Gielgud) comes in to awake him and give him his hangover breakfast. After Hobson sends the woman off and Arthur decides to take a boyish bath, they later go to a clothing store in the Bach building. He sees a woman, Linda (Liza Minnelli) wearing a yellow rain jacket and with a yellow tote bag, she is shoplifting. He is astonished, but amazed. Security stops her outside and insists, they see what is in her bag. After she causes a scene, Arthur steps in to save her. To make his act convincing that he knows her, he suddenly guesses her.Later that night, they go on a date. The Bach family warns Arthur he must marry Susan (Jill Eikenberry) or he will not be allowed to have his family fortune.

I think this movie speaks to all of us who are still thinking about growing up and reminds those that had to grow too quickly because of a truamatic event. Arthur lived a pampered life by most of our standards and he resisted the world he knew was coming quickly (i.e. marriage, career, and growing old.) The part I love best about the movie is his several refrences to Santa Claus. Which affirms in my mind that he was still very very young at heart. What I appreciate most about this movie is the very subtle and detail oriented comedy that Dudley Moore is known for. In my mind he is only second to Lucille Ball in the physical comedy department. I hate to put a list in the middle of this review but I just hope these subtle points make the movie that much more enjoyable when you see them.1. In the Plaza restaurant is the first refrence to Santa Claus when he refers to waiters.2. When he is waiting for Susan and her father says something like: ""If ever someone got in my way, they got hurt."" Arthur looks up at the moose on the wall out of the corner of his eye.3. I don't know why I find this so funny but after his engadgement he goes to visit Linda and he knocks the evelope rack off of the half wall, the director literally spends almost a full minute just focused on Arthur drunk trying to put it back together. After he can't do it he delivers my favorite line of the movie: ""This is a goner""4. At the reception party Arthur sings Santa Claus is Coming to Town.5. I love that Linda is portrayed as not being used to wealth at all when she is completely out of place at the formal party and she makes the cute comment that it ""feels just like prom night"" because she is all dressed up. To Arthur this is just a normal night.I could go through dozens more but I will leave you time to order the movie. This is a well made and well acted movie and well worth the bargain that it is.

He has no redeeming qualities. His public drunkenness is the stuff of legend. He frequents prostitutes openly. He holds no position in his father's company, nor does he really contribute to society in any way........yet we LOVE him.Moore channels the spoiled child perfectly.

Moore falls for a street wise waitress played by Liza Minelli, much to the chagrin of his father, and his father's potential business associate Bert Johnson. He stands to lose $75 million if he doesn't marry Johnson's daughter Susan.Though the drunken shennanigans make for some funny moments, the true heart of this film isn't with Arthur and Linda.....it is with Arthur and Hobson. It is in the midst of his heartache over Hobson's illness that Arthur truly learns what it is to be a grown up, and that life is too fleeting to let what is important slip through a drunken haze.An attempted remake in 2011 would not remotely compare to this timeless classic...and, quite frankly, I'm astonished an actor of Helen Mirren's caliber would agree to such a hack job of an endearing classic.THIS is the Arthur you need to see.",4,"A comedy delight that is clearly ""of it's time"".",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1624,"['are', 'certain', 'comedy', 'classics', 'are', 'truly', 'timeless', 'even', 'are', 'remarkably', 'dated', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'away', 'making', 'films', 'such', 'Blazing', 'Saddles', 'today', 'PC', 'environment', 'much', 'less', '1981', 'comedy', 'gem.Arthur', 'Bach', 'drunk', 'spoiled', 'lecherous', 'man', 'superbly', 'played', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'public', 'drunkenness', 'stuff', 'legend', 'openly', 'position', 'father', 'company', 'really', 'contribute', 'society', 'way', 'LOVE', 'him.Moore', 'channels', 'spoiled', 'child', 'perfectly', 'certainly', 'not', 'mean', 'drunk', 'clearly', 'focus', 'direction', 'life', 'loyal', 'man-servant', 'Hobson', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'Sir', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'be', 'sole', 'anchor', 'sensibility', 'Moore', 'street', 'wise', 'waitress', 'played', 'Liza', 'Minelli', 'much', 'chagrin', 'father', 'father', 'potential', 'business', 'associate', 'Bert', 'Johnson', 'lose', '75', 'million', ""n't"", 'marry', 'Johnson', 'daughter', 'drunken', 'shennanigans', 'make', 'funny', 'moments', 'true', 'heart', 'film', ""n't"", 'Arthur', 'Linda', '..it', 'Arthur', 'Hobson', 'midst', 'heartache', 'Hobson', 'illness', 'Arthur', 'truly', 'what', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'life', 'too', 'fleeting', 'let', 'what', 'important', 'slip', 'drunken', 'haze.An', 'attempted', 'remake', '2011', 'would', 'not', 'remotely', 'compare', 'timeless', 'classic', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'astonished', 'actor', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'caliber', 'would', 'agree', 'hack', 'job', 'endearing', 'classic.THIS', 'Arthur', 'need', 'see']",N/A

His incessant drinking, comic then, would be considered so Politically Incorrect today that nobody would want to touch it---the sequel, ARTHUR 2: ON THE ROCKS, released a bare two years later, was already being criticized as too flippant in its treatment of alcoholism. So went the Reagan Revolution.Regardless of the political climate, ARTHUR is a funny film. The witty by-play between the two Englishmen, Moore and Gielgud, is so dry snd razor sharp it has yet to dull after twenty seven years and countless viewings. Moore described their dialogue as ""the give-and-take between two RAF pilots during the War,"" and that is as accurate a description as can be found anywhere---""Hobson?""""Yes, Arthur?""""Do you know what I'm going to do?""""No, I don't.""""I'm going to take a bath.""""I'll alert the media.""***""Arthur, I see no reason to continue this conversation  [with Linda Marola]; that is, unless you're planning to knock over a fruit stand later on this evening.""***Linda [To Arthur]: ""What should I wear?""Hobson: ""Steal something casual.""***Bert Johnson [Athur's father-in-law-to-be]: ""I protect what's mine.

He came into our house. To steal our food.""Arthur [waving a hand]: ""Oh. Well, he was just asking for it.""Bert Johnson: ""I took a knife.

I was looking for Linda I hope this is the wrong house excuse me!Perry's Wife [screaming]: ""MY HUSBAND HAS A GUN!!!!!!!""Arthur: ""I'm sure he does, Madame. For all I know, he probably shot it while you were shouting.""---and so on. ARTHUR contains some of the funniest and most memorable one-liners ever written for the screen, and the dichotomy between Arthur's stuffy Old Money family, the gentle Arthur, and the solid working class Linda is riotous.

I was not in the best of moods walking into the theatre but was smiling from ear to ear walking out.  This is one of the funniest films ever.Arthur Bock (Dudley Moore) is the quintessential spoiled second generation millionaire.  He has never had to work a day in his life.  He has his own penthouse suite complete with running trains and butler.  Arthur's favorite pastime is getting drunk and embarrassing the upper-class.We first see Arthur as he is being chauffeured through the red light district.  He picks up a profession (her friend gets $50 for coming in second).  He takes her to a fancy restaurant, saying she is a princess from a small country (so small that last year the recarpeted the entire country!).  The next morning enter Hobson (John Gielguld), an acerbic British butler.  He has the perfect one line response to any situation.Arthur is summoned by his father.  The edict is given that Arthur must marry the daughter of dad's business rival or be cut off from his inheritance.  Arthur's answer to that is to go shopping and spend more of dad's money.  There he spies a quirky shoplifter, Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli).  Something about her interests Arthur and he pursues her.Eventually, reality wins out and Arthur must come to terms with his pending nuptials.  Now this leads to the funniest scenes of the film.  First is when Hobson realizes that Arthur really loves Linda and goes to her apartment to tell to go to the engagement party. (Best Line: ""Please get me two aspirin.  You will find them on the second shelf of the medicine cabinet behind the unused shave cream."")  Next is when Linda shows up at the engagement party.  (Best Line: ""I was in the neighborhood, it took two taxi's, a bus and a train.  But I was in the neighborhood"")  Finally, is the wedding that completely falls apart.This was one of the best written comedies with one liners that are still being repeated.  Dudley Moore gives his best performance ever.  Unfortunately, it was too good and most people thought that he was like Arthur.  Liza showed she inherited her mother's comic timing.  But the film was stolen by John Gielguld.  Gielguld deservedly won an Oscar for his perfect performance.  Also notable is Ted Ross (Tony winner as the Cowardly Lion in The Wiz) as the chauffer and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's hard as nails grandmother.

""Arthur"" is among one of the movies that I have to remember him by. This was, and still is, Dudley Moore's best film to date. In fact, no one did it quite like him. I still loved that delightful tune, ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"", which was sung by Christopher Cross. Of course, ""Arthur"" focuses on Arthur Bach (Moore), a playboy millionaire who is usually drunk most of the time. His father threatens to cut Arthur out of the $750 million inheritance if, and only if, he marries Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry, ""The Manhattan Project"") daughter of Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott, ""Beverly Hills Cop""), one of the most ruthless businessmen in New York. But then, Arthur has a change of heart when he meets a beautiful waitress named Linda Marolla (an excellent Liza Minnelli) and suddenly falls in love with her. ""Arthur"" is a movie that has received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor by Sir John Gielgud (""The Elephant Man""), who plays Arthur's unusually wisecracking butler Hobson. In fact, ""Arthur"" was considered to be such a hilarious classic that it had spawned a sequel named ""Arthur 2: On the Rocks"" about 7 years later in which Arthur experiences what it is like to be poor and among the working class, etc. In closing, there will be nothing quite like ""Arthur""...definitely one of the best Dudley Moore films of all time and of the 1980's.

I discovered that nearly three decades after its initial release this film has not lost its any of its charm.  Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore) is a hapless millionaire playboy who is rarely sober and seems entirely incapable of doing anything for himself.  Lucky for him that his trusted valet Hobson (John Gielgud) is usually around and looking out for his interests.  Sadly, Arthur is a young man with no goals and no ambition.  And to make matters worse his family has arranged for Arthur marry to a wealthy socialite named Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry).  The only problem is that Arthur has no feelings at all for this girl and his family has threatened to cut off his inheritance if he refuses to go along.  It's no wonder that Arthur is resorting more and more to the bottle for comfort.Then one day during one of his frequent and frivilous shopping excursions downtown Arthur witnesses an event that would change his life forever. An attractive young working girl named Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli) has been nabbed for shoplifting.  Seeing her predicament Arthur comes to her rescue by pretending that she was with him.  It is quite apparent that in just the course of a few short minutes our hero has fallen head over heels for this young lady.  And who could blame him?  As I recall I was so taken with Liza Minnelli in her role of Linda that I wanted to step right into the movie and marry her myself!  For the first time in his life Arthur is in love and Linda views Arthur as her knight in shining armor.  But hold on!  Will Arthur renounce the family fortune to marry Linda or will he cave in and submit to his father's wishes and marry Susan?  The fact is that there are hundreds of millions of dollars at stake here.  It is this dilemma that ""Arthur"" is all about and it makes for both a touching and hilarious motion picture.""Arthur"" was a huge hit at the box office back in 1981 earning Warner Brothers in the neighborhood of $82 million.  Dudley Moore did a workmanlike job in the role of Arthur Bach and was nominated for an Academy Award.  But  I particularly enjoyed the work of Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud who both turned in unforgettable performances.  In fact, Gielgud won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  In addition, the Burt Bacharach/Peter Allen tune ""Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" sung by Christopher Cross won the Academy Award for best song and ranked among the top singles for 1981.  Recently, I discovered that plans are afoot to do a remake of ""Arthur"".  Bad idea.  It is doubtful that you could ever recreate the magic that you will find in the original.

Schneider,"[44, 48]","Nope, I'm not talking merely about Arthur, the hapless drunk millionaire playboy played so perfectly by Dudley Moore, but ARTHUR, the wonderful 1981 film directed by Steve Gordon. Although I eventually got tired of hearing the overplayed ""Arthur's Theme"" on the radio back in the early '80's, I really have not tired of watching this movie. It has aged surprisingly well for a film that makes such good use of the New York City locations that existed at that time (not to mention the quaint old taxicabs). This is a film with a basic romantic plot that deals primarily with how love wins over money; however, this film never takes its own plot too seriously. Instead, it has much more fun with the assorted *characters*, like Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore), Linda Marolla (Liza Minnelli), the wisecracking butler Hobson (hilariously played by the wonderful Sir John Gielgud, who deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this), Arthur's dominating mother Martha Bach (Geraldine Fitzgerald), Arthur's WASP-y bride-to-be Susan Johnson (a pre-L.A. Law Jill Eikenberry), Susan's brutish father Burt Johnson (Stephen Elliott), and, of course, Bitterman, Arthur's Chauffer (Ted Ross, in a much better role than the Cowardly Lion he played in the big-budget 1978 misfire THE WIZ).  Some of dialogue is classic, especially between Arthur and Hobson! Also, this is arguably the last great movie that Liza has ever starred in.ARTHUR is one of the great comedies that most of the family can enjoy.  However, it's not really for kids under age 10, as the language is fairly racy and major plot points involve prostitutes, shoplifting, and in the case of the perpetually inebriated Arthur, alcoholism.  In fact, when it was released, many people criticized this film for turning alcoholism into one big running joke, as well as glamorizing it. This is what prompted the much-later sequel, ARTHUR 2: ON THE ROCKS, in which Arthur finally gets to experience the dark side of his habit.  Despite its sober theme, it was actually quite funny in its own right. Still, the original is better, and is one of the great films of the 1980's.
