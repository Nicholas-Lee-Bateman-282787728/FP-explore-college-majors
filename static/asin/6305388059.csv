Michael Wincott's role in Gunshy is probably the largest I've ever seen in any film because he usually gets a maximum of ten to fifteen minutes of screen time and he is always captivating whenever he appears. I know he can act, but it's disappointing to see that Wincott does not get enough screen time in past films. And it's nice to get the William Petersen treatment during Gunshy as well which is the biggest reason for the rating of `7'. Diane Lane shows that she can't still act and fails to develop any chemistry with the two male leads which is the chief reason that the plot never gets off to a flying start. Basically, I view Gunshy as a treat to see Michael Wincott and William Petersen acting. In a way, for me, it is a reminiscent of Atlantic City with Burt Lancaster. All in all, Gunshy can be much better if the plot is developed more and Diane Lane is replaced with somebody else who can actually act.",4,The Most Screen Time of Michael Wincott's Career.,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,1045,"['Viewed', '7/14Rate', '77/14', 'Gunshy', 'features', 'two', 'cool', 'actors', 'doing', 'usual', 'stuff', 'prematurely', 'nothing', 'much', 'say', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'role', 'Gunshy', 'probably', 'largest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'usually', 'maximum', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'always', 'captivating', 'whenever', 'know', 'can', 'act', 'disappointing', 'see', 'Wincott', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'past', 'films', 'nice', 'get', 'William', 'Petersen', 'treatment', 'Gunshy', 'well', 'biggest', 'reason', 'rating', '7', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'ca', ""n't"", 'still', 'act', 'fails', 'develop', 'chemistry', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'chief', 'reason', 'plot', 'never', 'flying', 'start', 'Basically', 'view', 'Gunshy', 'treat', 'see', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'William', 'Petersen', 'acting', 'way', 'reminiscent', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Gunshy', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'plot', 'developed', 'more', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'replaced', 'somebody', 'else', 'who', 'can', 'actually', 'act']",Gunshy

462797,A2IY9M330NKBW6,6305388059,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","I'm saying up front I liked this movie a lot. A good crime thriller should thrill, and this one had enough thrills to keep me in the game.Here's the scoop. Jake Bridges (William Petersen) is a writer/investigative reporter who has lost his edge. He heads to Atlantic City to crawl into a bottle. Through a fluke he ends up being befriended by Frankie McGregor (Michael Wincott) who runs ""errands"" for a local thug. Frankie takes a liking to Jake. He likes that Jake is educated and is feeling he could use some of that. The two begin a relationship and Jake starts taking a shine to Frankie's girl Melissa (Diane Lane). That begins to complicate issues as does something else Jake has not told Frankie (don't want to spoil). Now the pot is really boiling.The first few minutes made me think I was in for the same old same old but that stopped rather quickly. Due to some surprisingly good dialogue and nifty turns in the plot this kept me involved. Why Michael Wincott is not the alpha male in some big budget movies is beyond me. He's got a good camera face, has that raspy drinker's voice and is generally a good actor. He's really good as Frankie. I like William Petersen enough but I'm not a fanboy. This is as good as I've ever seen him and he has some great lines to deliver. I'd pay to watch Diane Lane eat corn flakes so my opinion of her doesn't count here.Director Jeff Celentano hasn't had much of note in his history, but writer Larry Gross has offered up a good script and given Jeff something to work with. This isn't totally original. It contains many elements of the previous year's ""Donnie Brasco"" but it's still a solid effort well worth watching.",4,Why All the Mediocre Reviews?,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1665,"[""'m"", 'saying', 'up', 'front', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'good', 'crime', 'thriller', 'should', 'thrill', 'one', 'had', 'enough', 'thrills', 'keep', 'game.Here', 'scoop', 'Jake', 'Bridges', 'William', 'Petersen', 'writer/investigative', 'reporter', 'who', 'lost', 'edge', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'crawl', 'bottle', 'fluke', 'up', 'being', 'befriended', 'Frankie', 'McGregor', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'who', 'errands', 'local', 'thug', 'Frankie', 'liking', 'Jake', 'Jake', 'educated', 'feeling', 'could', 'use', 'two', 'begin', 'relationship', 'Jake', 'taking', 'shine', 'Frankie', 'girl', 'Melissa', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'complicate', 'issues', 'something', 'else', 'Jake', 'not', 'told', 'Frankie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'Now', 'pot', 'really', 'boiling.The', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'stopped', 'rather', 'quickly', 'Due', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'dialogue', 'nifty', 'turns', 'plot', 'kept', 'involved', 'Why', 'Michael', 'Wincott', 'not', 'alpha', 'male', 'big', 'budget', 'movies', 'got', 'good', 'camera', 'face', 'raspy', 'drinker', 'voice', 'generally', 'good', 'actor', 'really', 'good', 'Frankie', 'like', 'William', 'Petersen', 'enough', ""'m"", 'not', 'fanboy', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'lines', 'deliver', ""'d"", 'pay', 'watch', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'eat', 'corn', 'flakes', 'so', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'count', 'here.Director', 'Jeff', 'Celentano', ""n't"", 'had', 'much', 'note', 'history', 'writer', 'Larry', 'Gross', 'offered', 'up', 'good', 'script', 'given', 'Jeff', 'something', 'work', ""n't"", 'totally', 'original', 'many', 'elements', 'previous', 'year', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'still', 'solid', 'effort', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Gunshy
462798,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6305388059,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[4, 5]","A very dark film whose script is surprisingly effective and very, very original. An informer makes a deal, and he introduces in a mobster band as a simple writer who has lost his muse. his right arm will be a simple guy who obeys orders: extremely predictable with a clear of cultural ascendent. Our hero William Petersen much better actor than most of people believe makes a sharp portrait. He works out as a mirror image of Pygmalion and tries to open his eyes through a painstaking reading of Moby Dick with a lot of new discoveries about the life.The drama completes its circle when Diane Lane a real Supreme Goddess, with natural talent and well gifted skills for acting eventually will be in a brief love affair with our informer. But Petersen is a very straightforward human being. And suddenly something simply doesn't fit where it should have been.A thriller that keeps its cohesion and dramatic force from beginning to end. No fissures, good cast, excellent illumination and a very good cast. Lane and Petersen shine brighter with more intensity, obviously and establish a very good sexual chemistry.Above average.",4,An interesting Noir Film!,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,1124,"['very', 'dark', 'film', 'script', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'very', 'very', 'original', 'informer', 'deal', 'mobster', 'band', 'simple', 'writer', 'who', 'lost', 'muse', 'right', 'arm', 'will', 'be', 'simple', 'guy', 'who', 'orders', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'clear', 'cultural', 'ascendent', 'hero', 'William', 'Petersen', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'most', 'people', 'believe', 'sharp', 'portrait', 'out', 'mirror', 'image', 'Pygmalion', 'tries', 'open', 'eyes', 'painstaking', 'reading', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'lot', 'new', 'discoveries', 'life.The', 'drama', 'circle', 'when', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'real', 'Supreme', 'Goddess', 'natural', 'talent', 'well', 'gifted', 'skills', 'acting', 'eventually', 'will', 'be', 'brief', 'love', 'affair', 'informer', 'Petersen', 'very', 'straightforward', 'human', 'being', 'suddenly', 'something', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fit', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'been.A', 'thriller', 'cohesion', 'dramatic', 'force', 'beginning', 'end', 'fissures', 'good', 'cast', 'excellent', 'illumination', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'Lane', 'Petersen', 'shine', 'brighter', 'more', 'intensity', 'obviously', 'establish', 'very', 'good', 'sexual', 'chemistry.Above', 'average']",Gunshy

The tile of this film is so so wrong .... the cover blurb on the cover of a movie about 'Cold Blooded Killers' is wrong and even the picture of the two male leads holding guns is wrong too .... Whats with the gun thing here ... very little gunplay in this movie .. most of it was physical violence on torture .... So probably the producers tried to make this film seem like a ripoff of those 'Tarantino' Cold Blooded killer movies ....This is a character study movie of a collector for the 'Irish' mob in Atlantic city befriending a down and out writer who seems to have lost his 'edginess' .....Irrespective of the cold heartedness of the collector, the movie paints the Irish mob boss as so mean and vicious that we start to root for our hero.

Well acted by the cast. William Petersen makes his character come alive and with his hesitations becomes real. By the end of the film you want him to have what he seaks but also want him to be safe.
