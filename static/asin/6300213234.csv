We don't even get to see the Gorn ship, which takes some excitement out of a high-speed chase, which Kirk believes is important to the Federation.As soon as the Metrons step in, however, the action picks up considerably. Kirk is forced to battle the leader of the Gorns, and the resulting combat is fun, exciting, and suspenseful.The Gorn is well-done and effective, slow, but too strong for Kirk to overcome using his standard Federation Judo that usually serves him quite well.The final showdown between Kirk and the Gorn is a classic Star Trek scene that is not to be missed.",5,A Classic,989539200,"05 11, 2001",2001,665,"['episode', 'what', 'be', 'low', 'budget', 'version', 'Balance', 'Terror', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'see', 'Gorn', 'ship', 'excitement', 'high-speed', 'chase', 'Kirk', 'important', 'Federation.As', 'soon', 'Metrons', 'step', 'however', 'action', 'up', 'considerably', 'Kirk', 'forced', 'battle', 'leader', 'Gorns', 'resulting', 'combat', 'fun', 'exciting', 'suspenseful.The', 'Gorn', 'well-done', 'effective', 'slow', 'too', 'strong', 'Kirk', 'overcome', 'using', 'standard', 'Federation', 'Judo', 'usually', 'quite', 'well.The', 'final', 'showdown', 'Kirk', 'Gorn', 'classic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'scene', 'not', 'be', 'missed']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 19: Arena VHS"
207776,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213234,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","This is the famous Gorn episode that features a slow-walking lizard man chasing Kirk around a planet. It has a strange history. Producer Gene Coon wrote it as an original episode, but then someone discovered that sci-fi author Frederic Brown had written a story that was in some ways similar, so they gave Brown credit.If you read Brown's story, you can see the similarity: an Earth man (though not Kirk) is pitted against a malevolent alien in hand-to-hand combat. If the Earth man loses, all humans will be destroyed. In the Trek version, Kirk is forced to fight the much stronger Gorn captain, and the Enterprise will be destroyed if he loses.Both stories have an anti-war slant. Super-advanced aliens decide it is better to stage a one-on-one battle rather than let two angry races carry on an interstellar war threatening the general peace. But in Coon's version, the anti-war slant is much stronger still. The Gorn race acts and appears savage indeed (what are humans more predjudiced against than reptiles?), but near the end Kirk starts to suspect that the Gorns were only defending their home territory when they blasted a Federation outpost.One of the virtues of the episode is that is one of the few ""hard science"" shows in Star Trek or any other televised sci-fi show. Actual knowledge of real science is used at an important plot point (as opposed to the meaningless technobabble that often ruined TNG). Kirk calls upon genuine knowledge of basic chemistry to make gunpower with the materials found on the planet. The Gorn captain is much too tough to be hurt otherwise. As a small child, I was really scared by this lizard man.",4,"Run, Kirk, Run, There's a Lizard Man After You!",1187222400,"08 16, 2007",2007,1641,"['famous', 'Gorn', 'episode', 'slow-walking', 'lizard', 'man', 'chasing', 'Kirk', 'planet', 'strange', 'history', 'Producer', 'Gene', 'Coon', 'wrote', 'original', 'episode', 'then', 'someone', 'discovered', 'sci-fi', 'author', 'Frederic', 'Brown', 'had', 'written', 'story', 'was', 'ways', 'similar', 'gave', 'Brown', 'credit.If', 'read', 'Brown', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'similarity', 'Earth', 'man', 'not', 'Kirk', 'pitted', 'malevolent', 'alien', 'hand-to-hand', 'combat', 'Earth', 'man', 'humans', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'Trek', 'version', 'Kirk', 'forced', 'fight', 'much', 'stronger', 'Gorn', 'captain', 'Enterprise', 'will', 'be', 'destroyed', 'stories', 'have', 'anti-war', 'slant', 'Super-advanced', 'aliens', 'better', 'stage', 'one-on-one', 'battle', 'rather', 'let', 'two', 'angry', 'races', 'carry', 'interstellar', 'war', 'threatening', 'general', 'peace', 'Coon', 'version', 'anti-war', 'slant', 'much', 'stronger', 'still', 'Gorn', 'race', 'acts', 'savage', 'indeed', 'what', 'are', 'humans', 'more', 'predjudiced', 'reptiles', 'end', 'Kirk', 'suspect', 'Gorns', 'were', 'only', 'defending', 'home', 'territory', 'when', 'blasted', 'Federation', 'outpost.One', 'virtues', 'episode', 'one', 'few', 'hard', 'science', 'shows', 'Star', 'Trek', 'other', 'televised', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'Actual', 'knowledge', 'real', 'science', 'used', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'opposed', 'meaningless', 'technobabble', 'often', 'ruined', 'TNG', 'Kirk', 'genuine', 'knowledge', 'basic', 'chemistry', 'make', 'gunpower', 'materials', 'found', 'planet', 'Gorn', 'captain', 'much', 'too', 'tough', 'be', 'hurt', 'otherwise', 'small', 'child', 'was', 'really', 'scared', 'lizard', 'man']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 19: Arena VHS"

Shortly after that, the landing party also comes under attack and after some spirited defense by Kirk and his team, the alien ship beams up their landing party and flees the area. Kirk orders pursuit at all costs, and they enter unexplored space where they are immediately scanned by forces on another planet.The scanning has been done by a very technically advanced species that decides to settle the matter. Kirk and the captain of the Gorn ship are transported to a planet where they will engage in a fight to the death. The only weapons they have will be what they can find, although they were told that each side would be able to find weapons there that will be powerful enough to destroy their opponent.Although slower in movement, the Gorn proves to be physically more powerful and capable of taking greater punishment. Kirk at first struggles in the battle and then begins to use his mind, creating gunpowder and using it to create a primitive cannon. While it does not kill the Gorn, it renders him defenseless and Kirk has the opportunity to kill him. However, in an example of understanding, he refuses to do so, an act that spares the lives of the Enterprise crew and the Gorn ship. Kirk is then allowed to see and communicate with the Metrons, who are impressed with Kirk's expression of the high trait of mercy.This is without doubt one of the best episodes in the series. As the late Carl Sagan wrote, humans seem to have a genetic aversion to reptiles; he speculated that it is a vestige of the time when mammals and reptiles were in competition for the position as the dominant species on Earth. It is a near certainty that when humans encounter other species, each side will consider the other to have a repulsive appearance. This is a situation that will have to be faced and solved very quickly, as the consequence could easily be a brutal interstellar war.",5,Kirk faces and conquers his innate loathing of reptiles,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,2012,"['Enterprise', 'lured', 'Cestus', 'III', 'when', 'landing', 'party', 'materializes', 'surface', 'find', 'colony', 'been', 'destroyed', 'Shortly', 'landing', 'party', 'also', 'attack', 'spirited', 'defense', 'Kirk', 'team', 'alien', 'ship', 'up', 'landing', 'party', 'area', 'Kirk', 'orders', 'pursuit', 'costs', 'enter', 'unexplored', 'space', 'where', 'are', 'immediately', 'scanned', 'forces', 'planet.The', 'scanning', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'technically', 'advanced', 'species', 'settle', 'matter', 'Kirk', 'captain', 'Gorn', 'ship', 'are', 'transported', 'planet', 'where', 'will', 'engage', 'fight', 'death', 'only', 'weapons', 'have', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'can', 'find', 'were', 'told', 'side', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'weapons', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'powerful', 'enough', 'destroy', 'opponent.Although', 'slower', 'movement', 'Gorn', 'be', 'physically', 'more', 'powerful', 'capable', 'taking', 'greater', 'punishment', 'Kirk', 'first', 'struggles', 'battle', 'then', 'use', 'mind', 'creating', 'gunpowder', 'using', 'create', 'primitive', 'cannon', 'not', 'kill', 'Gorn', 'defenseless', 'Kirk', 'opportunity', 'kill', 'However', 'example', 'understanding', 'do', 'so', 'act', 'lives', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Gorn', 'ship', 'Kirk', 'then', 'allowed', 'see', 'communicate', 'Metrons', 'who', 'are', 'impressed', 'Kirk', 'expression', 'high', 'trait', 'mercy.This', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'late', 'Carl', 'Sagan', 'wrote', 'humans', 'seem', 'have', 'genetic', 'aversion', 'reptiles', 'speculated', 'vestige', 'time', 'when', 'mammals', 'reptiles', 'were', 'competition', 'position', 'dominant', 'species', 'Earth', 'near', 'certainty', 'when', 'humans', 'encounter', 'other', 'species', 'side', 'will', 'consider', 'other', 'have', 'repulsive', 'appearance', 'situation', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'faced', 'solved', 'very', 'quickly', 'consequence', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'brutal', 'interstellar', 'war']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 19: Arena VHS"
