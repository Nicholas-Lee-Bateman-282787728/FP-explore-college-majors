I knew we had Prince versus Morris Day in a love triangle, but I had no idea there would be some complexity to this story. A few scenes my internal censor wanted to delete. Knowing what I do of Prince's bio, I wonder how much of this film is autobiographical, even though he's not listed as a writer.This was hot in my teen years, when I was too busy to watch any films, but also when I was ignoring style and looking solely for substance. Prince has substance. This DVD represents the only time I've seen him perform. My God, talk about style. I had no idea he could dance like that. The DVD also showed his wonderful wit and humor. And his conflict. If you love his music, watch this one.Oh, and The Time have made much better music than what's in the film. Prince making sure he looks better than the competition? Damned if I know. Prince did get the best sound engineering for his vocals. But Morris Day flapping around like a bird looked really stupid. I'd rather hear Walk Your Body and I'm So Cool.There's no excuse for Apollonia 6. Three plastic women in lingerie groping themselves and mumbling through something called Sex Shooter.

Musical scenes aside, the story is cornball by modern standards. But the MUSIC!---WHOA!The DVD extras are well done. I recall the concert footage of ""Baby I'm A Star/I Would Die 4U"" with the James Brownish jam session at the end (with Shiela E, who doesn't appear in the actual film, on the drums) airing frequently on MTV during the purple reign of the Summer of 1984. This is Prince onstage at his best, and is comparable to the performance scenes in the film. The MTV movie premire footage (also from 1984) is quite bizarre, with a young Eddie Murphy and a middle-aged Little Richard saying ""Prince is me in this generation.""It would have been great to have the deleted scenes that the trailer alludes to included, but what appears is just fine. Must give credit to Morris Day and the Time for adding needed comedy relief in this film. He and the Time are still shouting SQUAWK HALLELUJAH on stages across the country.BTW, while you should get this and all of Prince's albums from 1978-87 (well, ""Diamonds and Pearls' was his best post-Sign of the Times"" work), hold your noses and STAY AWAY from the films ""Under the Cherry Moon"" and the even more senseless mess ""Graffiti Bridge.""

97002,A3HU0B9XUEVHIM,0790731533,"Andre S. Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[1, 1]","Considering this is Prince's best known and most well regarded film there's still a lot of controversies surrounding it. That word in fact is so much a part of the Prince experience he titled a song and album by that word four years previous to this. Before this film came out the soundtrack to it had put Prince into the same commercial stratosphere as Michael Jackson and Madonna in terms of MTV era pop music and gave pop music critics a lot to talk about. After a chaotic and long gestating production that resulted in a lot of last minute recasting for the part of the leading lady the movie was finally released. While it's semi autobiographical there's a distance to the approch Prince takes with it. Prince himself plays the lead character only referred to as ""The Kid"",a struggling musician with a lot of personal problems in the Minneapolis music scene. One of the main acts at the First Avenue club he and his bands' The Revolution main competition are The Time,a funk band let by the comically pimping Morris Day. The club owner is convinced that The Kid and his band aren't making any money for the club because he ""only plays for himself"". Enter Apollonia,an attractive young singer looking for a break in the business. She soon becomes the girl caught in the middle between Prince's romantic desires for her and Morris's intentions of having her head up a girl group (Apollonia 6,of course) to co-opt The Kid and his band. The film plays this out to a climactic conclusion. This is where the possible biography comes in. In the film The Kid is portrayed as either humiliating and in one shocking case slapping Apollonia. This would make the character repellent if it weren't for the reason given: The Kid is living with his troubled parents,one of whom is an emotionally unstable and abusive father. He was a musician who wrecked his career (and apparently his wives) for the sake of his art and we see his tragic fate as he finally shoots himself in the end. The Kid's relationship with the two female members of the band (Wendy And Lisa) is troubled because they have a song (the rhythm of ""Purple Rain"" as it turns out) that he refuses to listen to because of his fragile ego. After the events with his family,Apollonia and Morris in the film The Kid finally relents and elects to transform Wendy And Lisa's tune into a full fledged anthem by movies end. Over the years everything under the sun has been questioned about this movie: the truth of it's biographical content,it's overtones of misogyny and,sometimes correctly so the lack of professional acting involved on a lot of the people involved. What we do get is a compelling film with amazing live performances and more ambiguous autobiography on Prince's part. We know of his trouble and abusive family in real life and that his real father was a musician but in Prince's own words for the sake of the story they went too far on certain plot points. One positive point is that it portrays alchoal (as abused by Prince's father Francis L in the film) as a detrement rather than a help and,through both The Kid and Morris's overbearing and in a few cases violent displays of ""ugly ego"" that to create great art it's better to work with others rather than against them. The movie doesn't have the more uniquely cultural or spiritual overtones that Prince's next two filmsUnder the Cherry MoonandGraffiti Bridgeseemed to have. As a result it's one of the more easy to digest of Prince's film to the general public and captures him,and a music scene he helped to create as it hit it's peak.",5,The Motion Picture Debut Of His Royal Badness,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",2010,3560,"['Considering', 'Prince', 'best', 'known', 'most', 'well', 'regarded', 'film', 'still', 'lot', 'controversies', 'surrounding', 'word', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'Prince', 'experience', 'titled', 'song', 'album', 'word', 'four', 'years', 'previous', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'put', 'Prince', 'same', 'commercial', 'stratosphere', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Madonna', 'terms', 'MTV', 'era', 'pop', 'music', 'gave', 'pop', 'music', 'critics', 'lot', 'talk', 'chaotic', 'long', 'gestating', 'production', 'resulted', 'lot', 'last', 'minute', 'recasting', 'part', 'leading', 'lady', 'movie', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'semi', 'autobiographical', 'distance', 'approch', 'Prince', 'Prince', 'lead', 'character', 'only', 'referred', 'Kid', 'struggling', 'musician', 'lot', 'personal', 'problems', 'Minneapolis', 'music', 'scene', 'One', 'main', 'acts', 'First', 'Avenue', 'club', 'bands', 'Revolution', 'main', 'competition', 'are', 'Time', 'funk', 'band', 'let', 'comically', 'pimping', 'Morris', 'Day', 'club', 'owner', 'convinced', 'Kid', 'band', 'are', ""n't"", 'making', 'money', 'club', 'only', 'Enter', 'Apollonia', 'attractive', 'young', 'singer', 'looking', 'break', 'business', 'soon', 'girl', 'caught', 'middle', 'Prince', 'romantic', 'desires', 'Morris', 'intentions', 'having', 'head', 'up', 'girl', 'group', 'Apollonia', '6', 'course', 'co-opt', 'Kid', 'band', 'film', 'out', 'climactic', 'conclusion', 'where', 'possible', 'biography', 'film', 'Kid', 'portrayed', 'humiliating', 'one', 'shocking', 'case', 'slapping', 'Apollonia', 'would', 'make', 'character', 'repellent', 'were', ""n't"", 'reason', 'given', 'Kid', 'living', 'troubled', 'parents', 'one', 'whom', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'abusive', 'father', 'was', 'musician', 'who', 'wrecked', 'career', 'apparently', 'wives', 'sake', 'art', 'see', 'tragic', 'fate', 'finally', 'shoots', 'end', 'Kid', 'relationship', 'two', 'female', 'members', 'band', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'troubled', 'have', 'song', 'rhythm', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'out', 'listen', 'fragile', 'ego', 'events', 'family', 'Apollonia', 'Morris', 'film', 'Kid', 'finally', 'relents', 'elects', 'transform', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'tune', 'full', 'fledged', 'anthem', 'movies', 'end', 'years', 'everything', 'sun', 'been', 'questioned', 'movie', 'truth', 'biographical', 'content', 'overtones', 'misogyny', 'sometimes', 'correctly', 'lack', 'professional', 'acting', 'involved', 'lot', 'people', 'involved', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'compelling', 'film', 'amazing', 'live', 'performances', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'autobiography', 'Prince', 'part', 'know', 'trouble', 'abusive', 'family', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'father', 'was', 'musician', 'Prince', 'own', 'words', 'sake', 'story', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'certain', 'plot', 'points', 'One', 'positive', 'point', 'alchoal', 'abused', 'Prince', 'father', 'Francis', 'L', 'film', 'detrement', 'rather', 'help', 'Kid', 'Morris', 'overbearing', 'few', 'cases', 'violent', 'displays', 'ugly', 'ego', 'create', 'great', 'art', 'better', 'work', 'others', 'rather', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'uniquely', 'cultural', 'spiritual', 'overtones', 'Prince', 'next', 'two', 'filmsUnder', 'Cherry', 'MoonandGraffiti', 'Bridgeseemed', 'have', 'result', 'one', 'more', 'easy', 'digest', 'Prince', 'film', 'general', 'public', 'music', 'scene', 'helped', 'create', 'hit', 'peak']",N/A

(My brother played sports with his brother and said when Prince was young his name was Skipper!! And that he was very weird; hmmmm...can't imagine that...)The montages and musical numbers in this are a trashy, sleazy, 80s joy from start to finish. Prince was at his peak here; he looks great, dances like a demon on meth, and of course, The Time bring much fun to the show as well. Morris Day is a natural comedian.The audience shots with all of the horrible 80s makeup are hysterical. And Wendy (or is it Lisa?) has a swept-over hairdo that would impress the Flock of Seagulls. A lotta eyeliner and  AquaNet went into making this movie.I also had the joy of seeing it again recently with a fairly drunk theater audience at a Prince Tribute Singalong- and this movie was meant to be rocked to. Prince is so insanely talented and joyful and the hooks just keep coming. I've seen him live and he can play any instrument and wail on it- he did a duet with Carlos Santana and completely held his own. And he didn't just walk over to the instruments- he twirls, kicks, splits and shimmies over to them. A consummate performer and this is Prince in top form.And whoever got to design his outfits must've had a blast. The boots that go halfway up his tiny body, the accessories all over the place- buckles, chains, etc... He also looked very much like an Eighties Little Richard here, and it suited him well.Sure, the sexism in the film is less than enlightened, but Wendy & Lisa & Appolonia counterbalance lowlights like Morris having a woman tossed into a dumpster.This reminds me that, sure, there was a lotta crap in the 80s, but there was a hell of a lot of fun to be had as well.

97016,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,0790731533,Christopher Culver,"[3, 4]","When PURPLE RAIN was shot in 1983, Prince was a newly mainstream act, finally celebrated outside of his hometown of Minneapolis.  Eager for more exposure, he sought out some producers and made this film. A hybrid film and music video, PURPLE RAIN describes the career of The Kid (Prince himself, of course), trying to make it in the music business in spite of the tough competition of swank Morris Day and violence between his alcoholic parents (Clarence Williams III and Olga Karlatos). The arrival of aspiring singer and dance Apollonia introduces some romance into the mix. Basically, things happen during the day, and then in the evening The Kid does his club act, where the songs Prince and The Revolution perform are vaguely related to what's going on between The Kid and Apollonia.This format of a dramatic plot mixed in with gratuitous concert performance is in no way new. Elvis did a whole series of such films. What makes PURPLE RAIN memorable is how it captures a Zeitgest so broadly. It's a one-stop celebration of early 1980s fashion, car design, club life, and of course music. Of course the plot and much of the acting is risible, though often it descends into ""it's so bad it's good"" territory. Certainly one chuckles when the club manager tells The Kid, ""No one understands your music but yourself"", when the soundtrack sold 13 million copies.The 20th anniversary edition DVD release contains a second disc with extras. There are three small documentaries, which describe respectively the Minneapolis venue featured in the film, the making of PURPLE RAIN, and the influence the film has had. They all feature interviews with the same people, including members of the Revolution and The Time. However, Prince, Moris Day, and Apollonia are missing from this documentary material.",3,"A fine way to revisit the 1980s, and the music's not bad",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,1795,"['When', 'PURPLE', 'RAIN', 'was', 'shot', '1983', 'Prince', 'was', 'newly', 'mainstream', 'act', 'finally', 'celebrated', 'hometown', 'Minneapolis', 'Eager', 'more', 'exposure', 'sought', 'out', 'producers', 'made', 'film', 'hybrid', 'film', 'music', 'video', 'PURPLE', 'RAIN', 'career', 'Kid', 'Prince', 'course', 'trying', 'make', 'music', 'business', 'spite', 'tough', 'competition', 'swank', 'Morris', 'Day', 'violence', 'alcoholic', 'parents', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'Olga', 'Karlatos', 'arrival', 'aspiring', 'singer', 'dance', 'Apollonia', 'romance', 'mix', 'Basically', 'things', 'happen', 'day', 'then', 'evening', 'Kid', 'club', 'act', 'where', 'songs', 'Prince', 'Revolution', 'perform', 'are', 'vaguely', 'related', 'what', 'going', 'Kid', 'Apollonia.This', 'format', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'mixed', 'gratuitous', 'concert', 'performance', 'way', 'new', 'Elvis', 'did', 'whole', 'series', 'such', 'films', 'What', 'PURPLE', 'RAIN', 'memorable', 'how', 'Zeitgest', 'so', 'broadly', 'one-stop', 'celebration', 'early', '1980s', 'fashion', 'car', 'design', 'club', 'life', 'course', 'music', 'course', 'plot', 'much', 'acting', 'risible', 'though', 'often', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'territory', 'Certainly', 'one', 'chuckles', 'when', 'club', 'manager', 'Kid', 'one', 'music', 'when', 'soundtrack', 'sold', '13', 'million', 'copies.The', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'DVD', 'release', 'second', 'disc', 'extras', 'are', 'three', 'small', 'documentaries', 'respectively', 'Minneapolis', 'venue', 'featured', 'film', 'making', 'PURPLE', 'RAIN', 'influence', 'film', 'had', 'feature', 'interviews', 'same', 'people', 'including', 'members', 'Revolution', 'Time', 'However', 'Prince', 'Moris', 'Day', 'Apollonia', 'are', 'missing', 'documentary', 'material']",N/A

97019,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0790731533,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[2, 2]","This semi-autobiographical movie set in Minneapolis about the Revolution and their struggle to outdo rival bands, including Morris Day's The Time, was the first of four movies the Purple One did--if one counts the concert film Sign 'O' The Times.  The love angle comes in when the Kid sees Apollonia window-shopping and flirtatiously walks off with the anklet he espies her wearing.The music is initially the only asset the Kid has.  He is selfish, arrogant, and thinks himself head over them.  Wendy and Lisa hand him a song with a familiar melody that he initially dismisses with sheer contempt--re the puppet show with ventriloquist voices.  He barely notices Jill, a blonde at the club who is nursing a crush on him.  He eventually turns against Apollonia, whom he slaps after she tells him she's going to join Morris's project group, Apollonia 6.Apart from the concert sequences, for me, two memorable scenes highlights of this movie are unfortunately sexist in nature, to which I give a thousand apologies.  One is the scene when Morris Day and Jerome Benton are stopped by one of Morris's white girlfriends who tears into him.  The hapless woman is seized by Jerome and thrown into a trash can.  The other is the Kid's stopping off at a lake and agreeing to help Apollonia if she jumps naked into Lake Minnetonka.  She jumps in, only to have the Kid tell her, as she clambers out gasping, ""That ain't Lake Minnetonka.""Although I knit my brow into a frown when I first read this in a magazine, I now unknit that brow and agree that Morris Day hands down steals the show with his ladies-man, Cab Calloway/James Brown schtick.  Their take on Abbott and Costello&#65533;fs &#65533;gWho&#65533;fs On First&#65533;h routine is hilarious.  Even though they perform only two numbers in the movie and not completely, their brand of dance funk serves as a contrast to the Hendrix-guitar rock from the Revolution.Olga Karlatos and the Mod Squad TV series' Clarence Williams III play the Kid's parents, and despite the lack of substantial screen time, one can see the Kid mirroring his father in his moodiness, creative talent, and the way they treat women.Nearly 20 years later, how does this movie hold up?  Well, given the rampant sexism in this movie, probably not too well. If anything, the concert sequences, particularly the blazing opening number, ""Let's Go Crazy,"" and the final three, beginning with the brilliant heartfelt title track and into a blaze of glory with ""I Would Die 4 U"" and ""Baby I'm A Star.""Of the people in the movie, Apollonia is by far the nicest person in the movie, or at least the one with the least faults.  One note of interest is seeing Dez Dickerson, Prince's former guitarist, doing the song ""Modernaire"" with his group prior to Prince's performance of ""The Beautiful Ones.""  And seeing some of the characters make me wonder what are they doing now?  Apollonia, Jill Jones, Dez Dickerson, where are you?The sexism may not go over well with today's PC-oriented stance.  However, I will admit that this movie signified the peak of his career, and many would agree that the companion album holds up better today.",4,Concert sequences and music survives in Prince's first movie,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,3141,"['semi-autobiographical', 'movie', 'set', 'Minneapolis', 'Revolution', 'struggle', 'outdo', 'rival', 'bands', 'including', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Time', 'was', 'first', 'four', 'movies', 'Purple', 'One', 'did', 'one', 'concert', 'film', 'Sign', 'O', 'Times', 'love', 'angle', 'when', 'Kid', 'Apollonia', 'window-shopping', 'flirtatiously', 'walks', 'anklet', 'wearing.The', 'music', 'initially', 'only', 'asset', 'Kid', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'head', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'hand', 'song', 'familiar', 'melody', 'initially', 'sheer', 'contempt', 're', 'puppet', 'show', 'ventriloquist', 'voices', 'barely', 'Jill', 'blonde', 'club', 'who', 'nursing', 'crush', 'eventually', 'Apollonia', 'whom', 'going', 'join', 'Morris', 'project', 'group', 'Apollonia', '6.Apart', 'concert', 'sequences', 'two', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'highlights', 'movie', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'sexist', 'nature', 'give', 'thousand', 'apologies', 'One', 'scene', 'when', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Jerome', 'Benton', 'are', 'stopped', 'one', 'Morris', 'white', 'girlfriends', 'who', 'tears', 'hapless', 'woman', 'seized', 'Jerome', 'thrown', 'trash', 'can', 'other', 'Kid', 'stopping', 'off', 'lake', 'agreeing', 'help', 'Apollonia', 'naked', 'Lake', 'Minnetonka', 'only', 'have', 'Kid', 'tell', 'her', 'out', 'gasping', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Lake', 'Minnetonka', 'knit', 'brow', 'frown', 'when', 'first', 'read', 'magazine', 'now', 'unknit', 'brow', 'agree', 'Morris', 'Day', 'down', 'steals', 'show', 'ladies-man', 'Cab', 'Calloway/James', 'Brown', 'schtick', 'take', 'Abbott', 'Costello', '65533', 'fs', '65533', 'gWho', '65533', 'fs', 'First', '65533', 'routine', 'hilarious', 'Even', 'perform', 'only', 'two', 'numbers', 'movie', 'not', 'completely', 'brand', 'dance', 'funk', 'contrast', 'Hendrix-guitar', 'rock', 'Revolution.Olga', 'Karlatos', 'Mod', 'Squad', 'TV', 'series', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'play', 'Kid', 'parents', 'lack', 'substantial', 'screen', 'time', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Kid', 'mirroring', 'father', 'moodiness', 'creative', 'talent', 'way', 'treat', 'women.Nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'how', 'movie', 'hold', 'up', 'Well', 'given', 'rampant', 'sexism', 'movie', 'probably', 'not', 'too', 'well', 'anything', 'concert', 'sequences', 'particularly', 'blazing', 'opening', 'number', 'Let', 'Go', 'Crazy', 'final', 'three', 'beginning', 'brilliant', 'heartfelt', 'title', 'track', 'blaze', 'glory', 'Would', 'Die', '4', 'U', 'Baby', ""'m"", 'Star', 'people', 'movie', 'Apollonia', 'far', 'nicest', 'person', 'movie', 'least', 'one', 'least', 'faults', 'One', 'note', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Dez', 'Dickerson', 'Prince', 'former', 'guitarist', 'doing', 'song', 'Modernaire', 'group', 'prior', 'Prince', 'performance', 'Beautiful', 'Ones', 'seeing', 'characters', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'now', 'Apollonia', 'Jill', 'Jones', 'Dez', 'Dickerson', 'where', 'are', 'sexism', 'may', 'not', 'go', 'over', 'well', 'today', 'PC-oriented', 'stance', 'However', 'will', 'admit', 'movie', 'signified', 'peak', 'career', 'many', 'would', 'agree', 'companion', 'album', 'up', 'better', 'today']",N/A

Most people remember this film mostly for its catchy songs that changed music history forever.  Its plot is also something worth remembering.  Its combination of storylines within The Kid's life blends wonderfully: his struggle to stay employed in the Minneapolis club where he performs, falling in love with Apollonia, and confronting his demons of frequently witnessing his abusive father in action.  Certain scenes give it edge and drama that keeps audiences interested and that accent the characters' surroungings.  The emotional impact is always present, namely the fight scenes.  Therefore, the film is more than just a long music video.  Such film quality makes it worth watching multiple times.  The actors offer their own emotional theme to the film.  Though certain roles were not demanding, Prince's role as The Kid is his acting best of his career.The music featured in &quot;Purple Rain&quot; has since become instant classics.  Though every Prince hit is genius, these songs remain his best in his career.  Its soundtrack stayed at #1 for 24 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts, sold 11 million copies in the US, and spawned four smash hits.  Prince earned two Grammys and an Oscar for his song &quot;Purple Rain&quot;.  These songs combine pop, R&amp;B, funk, rock, and soul beautifully.  They alone make the film worth watching; yet, they don't distract from the plot.  There has since not been a music-based film like it, not even &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002).&quot;Purple Rain&quot; is a great film for music and/or Prince fans for viewing pleasure.

Witness, for example, the 8-minute sonic and visual barrage that opens ""Purple Rain,"" as Prince and his band tear through ""Let's Get Crazy."" The film has lost its shock value -- who are all those fashion victims in their underwear? -- but none of its ability to astonish.The mixture of dodgy acting, raw energy and high spirits gave ""Purple Rain"" the same infectious appeal found two decades earlier in ""A Hard Day's Night"" and two decades later in ""8 Mile.""""Purple Rain"" was one of the early Warner Bros. titles on DVD, in a pan-and-scan version that you actually had to flip over to see the entire movie. That disc is best tossed into the recycling. The ""20th Anniversary Edition"" returns ""Rain"" to its original widescreen aspect ratio, with a Dolby 5.1 audio mix that's house-party heavy on the subwoofer.No surprise, of course, that Prince is nowhere to be found on the extras, given his long contract war with Warner Bros. The telling of the ""Purple Rain"" story largely is left to director Albert Magnoli and producer Robert Cavallo (who reunite for a commentary) as well as Prince's famed bandmates of the time, Wendy and Lisa.In addition to the making-of featurette, there's a history of the Minneapolis club made famous by the film and a rah-rah look at ""Purple Rain's"" legacy in music and fashion.

Despite all of these obstacles, Prince, or ""the kid"" comes out on top at the end with ""Purple Rain"", the title of the album that would alter the music landscape forever.While the acting was a little cheesy, nonetheless, it is a must have for any Prince fan, let alone any pop music lover.

Back when the only access I had to this film was via a Music Video show, ""When Doves Cry"" became my favorite song, and ""Let's Go Crazy"" was a close second.  I watched every Prince video, and eventually had access to Satellite by babysitting.  I saw Purple Rain several times on satellite, later bought the vhs tape, and I purchase better versions as they are released.  This movie inspired me throughout life.  Ironically, I accomplished most of my dreams and desires without becoming famous, but the movie is inspirational for numerous reasons.I loved the androgyny of the '80s, the glam, and the wild lifestyles.  Prince was and is a master of music, performance, and I dig his acting as well.  I also recommendUnder the Cherry Moon, and his other movies, recorded performances, etc.  However, for me, Purple Rain is ""it.""  This movie was the crux and focal point of my life, for a long time. I lived a unique life, inspired by this film, and lived out many dreams.  To me, this movie is about doing whatever it takes to get where you want to be, without losing your Self in the process.Prince is an amazing musician.  I own most of what he has created on CD, and I never tire of his music.  I rarely watch movies more than once or twice, because of my recall.  However I do not know how many times I have seen Purple Rain.I believe that many people who are Driven, and want to achieve will appreciate this movie.

His flamboyant style and discordant guitar licks were a welcome relief to the burgeoning techno music which would eventually take over the 80s.  One of the more amusing sub-stories in this movie is the way Prince comes to unseat Morris Day and the Time, an updated doo wop band that ruled the roost at the club.

Part of my ongoing reacquaintance with Prince in the wake of the return to form in Musicology.My aunt found this misogynistic; my sister considers this one of her favorite movies of all time. For me, Prince throws down the gauntlet as the post-modern James Brown with slammin microphone throwdowns, total onstage command, and a similar inability to construct love. I saw so many justifications for why I avoided Prince as a teenager in this film. Throwing women in dumpster, the lake scene, slapping women around, some of this was tough to watch for me. Perhaps I am too sensitive. Prince doesn't really act, not that you should expect him to. Sometimes he models on his bike or pouts in his dressing room. Other times he gives knockout performances. The best parts of Purple Rain for me could have been condensed to a sequence of music videos. But a storyline focused Prince to give him pop megastardom and its a vital mid80s cultural document. For that reason alone anyone interested in music should check this film out.Morris Day was classic for me just about all the way through. He was funny and I dug the funk of his band. I dig tracks like the Bird.I agree with other reviewers who complained about the shoddy DVD in its fullscreen only format and its lack of extras. Equally shoddy is the fact that Warners has not come out with a deluxe soundtrack that includes stuff by Apollonia 6 and the Time. I'd love to have a soundtrack like the deluxe soundtrack for &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; by Jimmy Cliff that delves into all of the great music to come out of this film and that features all the bands under Prince's influence at the time.The film has a lousy message and poor acting but at least it focused Prince on a project that many consider his most consistent musical statement.I still prefer the Prince of Sign O the Times to the Prince of Purple Rain because of the greater maturity. But I recognize this movie as a stepping stone in his evolution as an artist and as a man and I recommend it to all curious about his music as a window into the paradoxes of his world and his artistry.5 stars for the music2 stars for DVD quality2 stars for plot3 stars overall.--SD",3,"Plot and message, yikes!

This semi-biographical tale of Prince's struggling to make it in the music industry is hit and miss throughout. For those who haven't already seen this; the film is really nothing more than a feature-length music video marking Prince's acting debut; he is essentially playing himself here, and is surprisingly charming. Prince is no actor...he mumbles his lines and resorts to melodrama in serious scenes...but his performance truly conveys a great deal of pain and conflict.For a musician in his first role, he is actually quite good. Morris Day is a virtual scene-stealer; the ""Time"" leader plays, who else, Morris Day and his performance is inspired and funny. Prince's then-band mates Wendy and Lisa also shine as well as Apollonia who is adequate as The Kid's love interest. Clarence Williams III (""The Mod Squad"") gives the best performance here as The Kid's father; his rage, confusion, and guilt truly come through in a brilliant performance, and his role should have been bigger.""Purple Rain"" is certainly an ego trip for its star. But Prince certainly deserves to have a big head because the music in ""Purple Rain"" is nothing less than awe-inspiring. He deservedly won an Oscar for his score, and the excitement of his live shows are truly on display here. The Time is also fun to watch; ""Purple Rain"" includes their performances of two of their biggest hits, ""The Bird"" and ""Jungle Love.""""Purple Rain"" is not without its imperfection. The film doesn't fully investigate The Kid's home life with the exception of a few throwaway scenes. Despite the charms of most of the performers, the acting is amateurish and often laughable.

With commentaries, previously-unseen documentaries and numerous pop videos, this 20th anniversary edition has more than enough bells and whistles on it to compensate for the failings of its DVD predecessor.All of which, of course, wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference if the film itself wasn't up to scratch. Purple Rain, fortunately, doesn't have this problem. It is, quite possibly, the Greatest Vanity Picture Ever: a monumental edifice to the ego, excess and brilliance of the little man on whose life it is very loosely based. Prince plays The Kid, a talented musician who must rise above his turbulent family life and self-obsession if he is to get with the hot chick and have everyone love his ass forevermore. It's contrived stuff, but surprisingly well-played: Prince himself is pretty effective, Clarence Williams III delivers a nuanced turn as his dad, and Morris Day and Jerome Benton do a neat comedy double-act as The Kid's rivals.That said, the drama is pretty incidental to the musical set-pieces: Prince's place is on stage, and he doesn't disappoint here - be it getting jiggy with a speaker stack in ""Darlin Nicki"", or putting his heart on his spangled sleeve for the title track. Whilst parts of the film may now seem hilariously dated - dig the motorcyle, the formation dancers, and the ""tough"" fellas in the crowd - there's no denying the impact and vitality of the stageshow itself. And, as a period piece, this one beats the competition hands down.",5,Princely treatment for a pop classic,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1632,"['Condemned', 'years', 'truly', 'mediocre', 'DVD', 'version', 'Prince', 'epochal', '1984', 'effort', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'finally', 'been', 'awarded', 'reissue', 'was', 'waiting', 'commentaries', 'previously-unseen', 'documentaries', 'numerous', 'pop', 'videos', '20th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'more', 'enough', 'bells', 'whistles', 'compensate', 'failings', 'DVD', 'predecessor.All', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'slightest', 'bit', 'difference', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'scratch', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'fortunately', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'quite', 'possibly', 'Greatest', 'Vanity', 'Picture', 'Ever', 'monumental', 'edifice', 'ego', 'excess', 'brilliance', 'little', 'man', 'life', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Prince', 'Kid', 'talented', 'musician', 'who', 'must', 'rise', 'turbulent', 'family', 'life', 'self-obsession', 'get', 'hot', 'chick', 'have', 'everyone', 'love', 'ass', 'forevermore', 'contrived', 'stuff', 'surprisingly', 'well-played', 'Prince', 'pretty', 'effective', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'nuanced', 'turn', 'dad', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Jerome', 'Benton', 'do', 'neat', 'comedy', 'double-act', 'Kid', 'rivals.That', 'said', 'drama', 'pretty', 'incidental', 'musical', 'set-pieces', 'Prince', 'place', 'stage', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'be', 'getting', 'jiggy', 'speaker', 'stack', 'Darlin', 'Nicki', 'putting', 'heart', 'spangled', 'sleeve', 'title', 'track', 'Whilst', 'parts', 'film', 'may', 'now', 'seem', 'hilariously', 'dated', 'dig', 'motorcyle', 'formation', 'dancers', 'tough', 'fellas', 'crowd', 'denying', 'impact', 'vitality', 'stageshow', 'period', 'piece', 'one', 'competition', 'down']",N/A

I was then Rich King's Breakfast Nook and made the world smile. I've decided to make another change to stay one step ahead of the game. I'm a lot like Prince. I've made up a symbol for myself, but it doesn't translate well to this site. I do use it as my signature when I sign autographs. Well, onto the movie.This is an absolute classic with everything you would ever want in a great movie. There's Prince, there's some rain, there's a purple motorcycle, there's appalonia and her daisy air rifle acting range and there's Morris freakin Day and the freakin Time. When Jungle Love would come on at the roller rink I frequented they nearly had to call the fire marshall because I was setting the rink on fire. I've always taken things up a level from normal. Let me set the scene. I would be playing some tempest, probably setting a new high score on the machine, and the DJ would say Morris Day and Time were coming up. That meant one of two songs was coming up. The Bird, which I found lame, or Jungle flibbity love. Well, the DJ knew where the bread was buttered and threw on Jungle Love. The crowd would start chanting for me. I would drop the red satin cape and hit the floor. The local news stations would fight for the best filming position and I made things happen.

""The Kid"" and his struggles to be a musical star, dealing with his family problems at home, and attempting to court Appelonia.  What really made this movie such a classic wasn't really the backstory, it was the musical performances.  ""Jungle Love"" by Morris Day and the Time, still a classic on radio to this day.  Prince's performances, most notably and memorably, ""Purple Rain"" which was performed with such heart that you can feel the emotion behind the song.So how does it translate to HD-DVD?  Well, it does look better than the regular DVD version, but it's definitely not the optimal quality that it could have been.  The ""it's an old movie"" excuse doesn't fly, because Casablanca was done in superb fashion.  So it's absolutely not ""The Look of Perfect"".That said, the audio is top notch.  Surround is in full form and you can hear everything very well - a must for a movie that is centered around musical performances.

97083,A25AXWGBGJ5KBS,0790731533,"M J Heilbron Jr. ""Dr. Mo""","[13, 15]","There is no argument. Prince, in 1984, with the ""Purple Rain"" juggernaut mowing down records at the box office, the record charts and the concert halls, was awesome. Watching the film again, a film I had memorized in my youth, renewed my appreciation for his prodigious talent.And what balls this guy had! Barely into his twenties, with one moderately successful album (the double ""1999"") behind him, he ventured into the film world.He's in nearly every frame. His name's above the title. It is autobiographical in tone. It's essentially a musical, with each song propelling the plot and supplying storytelling information.  It was a rock musical, to make matters worse, as they were (and still are) not known for being huge money-makers.Yet from the opening frames to the climactic ending, you are absolutely hooked. One hundred percent.If you are not, then you MUST have something against him, or against rock in general, or in musicals...Seriously, the incendiary ""Let's Go Crazy"" with his Hendrixian squeals and pogo beat, is as good as any filmed musical performance ever.Somebody argue with me, I dare you.The editing, the cinematography, the energy, the precision...it's the closest a film has come to reproducing a true live experience. And Prince owns every inch of celluloid here. His personality radiates right off the screen.Each song advances the story so well, the dialogue is kept minimal.Many critics point out some hackneyed lines and stilted performances, faulting the entire movie because of them.They're partially correct. There are a few lines that STILL make me wince, even when I know they're coming. Many of the supporting actors/musicians sound like they're reading out of a phone book.Not Prince though. Not once. He feels authentic. Even the logistically stupid things he does (mostly with a motorcycle) or the stylistically questionable things (mostly his wardrobe) somehow manage to work with him. And him only.Apollonia is a vision, but she shouldn't sing.Morris Day is a hoot on stage, but some of his off-stage antics don't work.I will say that Jerome is perfect. I just love his presence.There is a hint of misogyny on the part of many men in the film, but I think that's part of the plot. I think Prince's redemption at the end of the film includes a new respect towards women. Using Wendy and Lisas song for ""Purple Rain"", singing ""I'll never beat you"" in the song ""I Would DIe 4 U"" to Apollonia, kissing Wendy on the cheek during ""Rain"" all indicate a change of heart.Anyways, that ALL pales next to the concert footage. While he's chastising Apollonia from the stage using songs like ""The Beautiful Ones"" or the infamous ""Darling Nikki"", or exorcising demons in ""Purple Rain"", he is a master artist. Captured on film. I don't think I've ever seen the joy of performing emanate so clearly from an individual in a film. The performance is a kinetic drug working on Prince, and we watch the side effects.I can't believe he wrote ""When Doves Cry"" overnight, on command. I can't believe they shot all the concert footage in ten days. Total. I can't believe this raw talent that we fortunately captured on film. He'll never be like this again.The (literally) climactic encore of ""I Would Die 4 U"" and ""Baby I'm a Star"" (referring to the guitar neck bit at the end) is Prince proudly announcing to the world he has arrived. Who else, in the title and chorus of the last song, could state...could proclaim that he is a star, and we in the audience can do nothing but nod in agreement.Now, the DVD itself, this new 20th anniversary version, is a revelation. Over the years, I bought the record, then saw the movie, then went to the concert.Then I bought the VHS tape.Then I bought the CD.Then I bought the laserdisc.Then I bought the DVD.Now, I got this sucker, and this one rules them all. The picture, finally letterboxed, is gorgeous. Crisp, colorful and detailed. The sonics are pristine.The extras are pretty terrific too. The mini-docs on the First Avenue club, and on the making of the film itself, are interesting enough. The puff piece on the ""influence"" of Purple Rain is OK, but they don't go really into any serious detail.The biggest laugh is the footage from MTV's Premiere coverage. Pee-Wee Herman, Eddie Murphy, Sheila E., Weird Al, John Cougar Mellencamp (the best speaker of the bunch, by far), an odd appearance by Little Richard, the painful fashions, the worst hosting and interviewing you'll EVER see......oh I couldn't stop laughing.Add on those precious, uncut videos (and a running commentary a little too slow for my taste) and you have a five-star DVD. No question.Catch a glimpse of a star hitting supernova. It's right here. And it's awesome.",5,Awesome talent on display.

The real star was the music and stage choreograph. This movies energy comes charging though full force when each band struts there stuff.

97110,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,0790731533,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 4]","Purple Rain is one of the iconic Black films of the 1980s. Forget about plot, story and acting, this unique movie is like Prince himself: It's is all about the music.Prince is the Kid, a struggling Black Minneapolis rock musician. He's not thinking about getting big just trying to get by. He struggles to keep his band playing a local nightclub where he hasn't been packing them in lately. His band wants to break up and he's got stiff competition in rival band The Time and its charismatic bandleader Morris Day who is trying to persuade the club owner towards featuring his acts exclusively. In the quest to stay in the club, keep his band together and fight for the affections of Apollonia Kotero, the Kid suffers for his art. In between the inspired and original music videos we see his pain in every frame of this film.In his personal life, the Kid is desperate not to turn into his father, an alcoholic musician who mercilessly beats his Mother. He doesn't want to repeat the violent behavior of his Father, but his frustrations about the direction of his career seem to be getting the better of him in his relationship with Apollonia. I don't want to give away any more, but in the end he overcomes his struggles, ends the cycle of violence, and gets the girl. The movie ends with the performance of ""Purple Rain"". Seeing this concert footage of this song alone is worth the purchase price of the DVD.Purple Rain is a unique movie experience. Part autobiography, part rock video part documentary it comes together into a beautifully crafted film. Director Alberto Magnoli's camera takes the viewer into the world of Rock music in Minneapolis. Production values are sparse, but that works to Magnoli's advantage. It allows him to capture the grittiness of the mid 80's beautifully. Filming out of those homes, alleys, and city streets takes us back to that time before Prince became a worldwide superstar. And yes, people did wear clothes and hairstyles like that back then.The music-without it, there wouldn't be a movie. I heard many of these songs way back when I was a kid in 1984 and all of them still stay with me. Princes' music is a one-of a kind experience. There's so much heart, passion and emotion in every song, in every beat of music. Watching this movie again twenty-three years later I now understand the pain behind his creative process. As a writer and artist myself I've come to appreciate this movie even more. Anyone who wants to be a musician, rapper, writer, or ""artist"" should have a copy of this movie and the soundtrack on hand.There isn't much acting here, since everyone is just playing themselves, but the heart and passion of this production shows onscreen. Prince is Rock solid as the Kid. Appolonia Kotero is charming and engaging. The late Clarence Williams III is incredible to watch as the abusive father.

97119,A38U2M9OAEJAXJ,0790731533,The Groove,"[1, 1]","""Purple Rain"" was a phenomenon that successfully merged music and film like no other movie since its release.  It was a solid box office hit, and the soundtrack spent 24 consecutive weeks at Number One, going multiplatinum, winning Grammys and even snatching up an Academy Award. In this movie, Prince is the Kid, a struggling musician who leads a band called the Revolution and is trying to keep his gig at the First Avenue, the same club where rival Morris Day (and the Time) also performs.  Meanwhile, he crosses paths with 19-year-old Apollonia, who also has dreams of making it big.  Let it be immediately known that the Kid is not a pleasant dude at all.  In fact, he's a bit of an arrogant jerk.  Throughout the movie, he slaps Apollonia, dupes her into jumping into a lake, and treats her as little more than a sex object.  On top of that, the Kid has some pretty major control issues as well.  He insists that the band performs only the Kid's own material, and he snubs any contribution from members Wendy and Lisa.  And when we're introduced to his parents, we immediately understand why the Kid treats women so badly.  His father (played by Clarence Williams III) routinely abuses his mother, and watching this constant abuse drives the Kid to the brink.  So can the Kid rise above his violent past, mend his fraying band, keep his gig at the club, and ultimately find peace within himself and Apollonia?  You'll have to see the movie to find out.  The plot in ""Purple Rain"" covers very familiar ground, but what really makes the movie watchable are the musical performances.  Prince rips through classics like ""Let's Go Crazy,"" ""Baby I'm a Star,"" the salacious ""Darling Nikki,"" and the title song, while the Time also holds its own with hits like ""The Bird"" and ""Jungle Love.""  Even Apollonia made an amusing impression in ""Sex Shooter,"" one of the ""so-bad-it's-good"" songs of the 1980s.  The acting, a term I use fairly liberally in this review, is a different matter.  Clarence Williams seems to be the only professional of the bunch, while Morris Day and Jerome Benton are true naturals in front of the camera, giving the movie a much needed comic uplift and counterbalancing some of the more wooden performances by Apollonia and Prince himself.  The DVD presents ""Purple Rain"" for the first time in widescreen format, with remastered sound and a bevy of features on the second disc.  These include music videos for every single released from this soundtrack, including an 18 minute performance of ""I Would Die 4 U/Baby I'm a Star.""  We also get a handful of retrospective documentaries featuring interviews with cast and crew members such as members of the Revolution, Jellybean Johnson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (who weren't even in ""Purple Rain""), director Albert Magnoli, and MTV journalist Kurt Loder.  (Prince, Day, Apollonia, Williams are all MIA.)  While these clips are interesting, they don't do much more than praise Prince to high heaven.  But the real treat is the original MTV premiere party, featuring then VJ Mark Goodman, as well as guests Eddie Murphy, Sheila E, Wendy, Lisa, and Lionel Richie among others.  ""Purple Rain"" is no masterpiece, and it has its awkward moments, but it's still a fun movie to watch for both Prince fans and non-Prince fans.  20 years later, the rain still falls.",4,"Baby, He's a Star!",1093737600,"08 29, 2004",2004,3324,"['Purple', 'Rain', 'was', 'phenomenon', 'successfully', 'merged', 'music', 'film', 'other', 'movie', 'release', 'was', 'solid', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'soundtrack', 'spent', '24', 'consecutive', 'weeks', 'Number', 'One', 'going', 'multiplatinum', 'winning', 'Grammys', 'even', 'snatching', 'up', 'Academy', 'Award', 'movie', 'Prince', 'Kid', 'struggling', 'musician', 'who', 'band', 'called', 'Revolution', 'trying', 'keep', 'gig', 'First', 'Avenue', 'same', 'club', 'where', 'rival', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Time', 'also', 'Meanwhile', 'paths', '19-year-old', 'Apollonia', 'who', 'also', 'dreams', 'making', 'big', 'Let', 'be', 'immediately', 'known', 'Kid', 'not', 'pleasant', 'dude', 'fact', 'bit', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'movie', 'Apollonia', 'jumping', 'lake', 'little', 'more', 'sex', 'object', 'top', 'Kid', 'pretty', 'major', 'control', 'issues', 'well', 'band', 'only', 'Kid', 'own', 'material', 'contribution', 'members', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'when', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'parents', 'immediately', 'understand', 'why', 'Kid', 'treats', 'women', 'so', 'badly', 'father', 'played', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'routinely', 'mother', 'watching', 'constant', 'abuse', 'Kid', 'brink', 'can', 'Kid', 'rise', 'violent', 'past', 'mend', 'fraying', 'band', 'keep', 'gig', 'club', 'ultimately', 'find', 'peace', 'Apollonia', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'plot', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'covers', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'watchable', 'are', 'musical', 'performances', 'Prince', 'rips', 'classics', 'Let', 'Go', 'Crazy', 'Baby', ""'m"", 'Star', 'salacious', 'Darling', 'Nikki', 'title', 'song', 'Time', 'also', 'own', 'hits', 'Bird', 'Jungle', 'Love', 'Even', 'Apollonia', 'made', 'amusing', 'impression', 'Sex', 'Shooter', 'one', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'songs', '1980s', 'acting', 'term', 'use', 'fairly', 'liberally', 'review', 'different', 'matter', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'be', 'only', 'professional', 'bunch', 'Morris', 'Day', 'Jerome', 'Benton', 'are', 'true', 'naturals', 'front', 'camera', 'giving', 'movie', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'uplift', 'counterbalancing', 'more', 'wooden', 'performances', 'Apollonia', 'Prince', 'DVD', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'first', 'time', 'widescreen', 'format', 'remastered', 'sound', 'bevy', 'features', 'second', 'disc', 'include', 'music', 'videos', 'single', 'released', 'soundtrack', 'including', '18', 'minute', 'performance', 'Would', 'Die', '4', 'U/Baby', ""'m"", 'Star', 'also', 'get', 'handful', 'retrospective', 'documentaries', 'featuring', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'such', 'members', 'Revolution', 'Jellybean', 'Johnson', 'Jimmy', 'Jam', 'Terry', 'Lewis', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'director', 'Albert', 'Magnoli', 'MTV', 'journalist', 'Kurt', 'Loder', 'Prince', 'Day', 'Apollonia', 'Williams', 'are', 'MIA', 'clips', 'are', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'more', 'praise', 'Prince', 'high', 'heaven', 'real', 'treat', 'original', 'MTV', 'premiere', 'party', 'featuring', 'then', 'VJ', 'Mark', 'Goodman', 'as', 'well', 'guests', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Sheila', 'E', 'Wendy', 'Lisa', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'others', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'masterpiece', 'awkward', 'moments', 'still', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'Prince', 'fans', 'non-Prince', 'fans', '20', 'years', 'later', 'rain', 'still']",N/A

97122,AN84BDHH63TBN,0790731533,"Timothy N. Stelly Sr. ""Stellbread""","[0, 3]","Purple Rain is the story of a music ing&eacute;nue, The Kid (Prince), who as a rock band frontman has become a big fish in a small pond. His hope is to make it to the big time but his budding career is in jeopardy once rival music showman Morris (Day) and his group, The Time, not only begin to outshine the Kid, but seek to develop another act to squeeze The Kid out.The kid not only has to deal with that, but he has problems at home as his mother and father are in the terminal stage of falling out of love, and his band mates have grown weary of the Kid dismissing their input in favor of playing no one else's music but his. When the sexy and slightly talented Apollonia arrives in town with stars in her eyes, Prince gets first crack at her, but makes the mistake of playing dumb mind games with her which he tries to pass off as being mysterious.Morris however, fails to light a fire under Apollonia because he is abrasive and stuck on himself, but he manages to convince her that the Kid is on the way out, he's on the way up and he wants to taker her with him up the ladder to stardom. Apollonia bites, which leaves the Kid in a tizzy. The tables have been turned and now he is feeling something more for Apollonia than a kindred love of music. However he fears that his relationship will end up as volatile as his parents' (Williams and Karlatos), and that idea is reinforced when he discovers that Apollonia has been working with Morris and in a rage slaps her causing Apollonia to run off.The Kid however, takes not only his talent to the stage, but his problems, which forces the hand of club owner Billy (Billy Sparks) who warns the Kid to step up his game. In the most poignant scene in the film he tells him that he is on the verge of becoming a loser like his father, another gifted but troubled musician.The Kid, feeling the pressure of having to deliver and come on stage after Morris and the Tome have opened the show with a visually stunning performance, decides to play a song that he's written, but based on chords that he gleaned from one of the band members, who is stunned to hear him say as much. The result is the song Purple Rain and from there the Kid segues into I Would Die 4 U and Baby, I'm a Star, and he brings the house down to the point where even Morris and Apollonia are cheering him on.In the end Prince gets the girl, as an inebriated Morris not only blows his chance but is literally kicked to the curb as the Kid and Apollonia speed off on a motorcycle. Not a bad plot, but the dialogue and the plot don't ring true and the acting...if you want to call it that...couldn't have been more stilted if they'd been reading their lines and stage directions from a teleprompter.Purple Rain succeeded at the Box Office because of Prince, period. He had star power and his music was at the top of the charts, including tunes he'd written for Vanity 6 and The Time. The movie grossed $68 million domestically, not bad for a flick whose cast includes but one name actor, Clarence Williams III (from the 60's TV series The Mod Squad and Tales From The Hood). These guys make Muhammad Ali's performance in Freedom Road look like Forrest Whitaker's in The Last King of Scotland.The technicians weren't much better than the actors. How amateurish was this film?

""Purple Rain"" is primarily a showcase for Prince's music and female lead Apollonia Kotero's breasts.

In between the songs, there's a melodramatic story and amateurish acting, but it's mildly amusing rather than annoying. Prince himself is rather laughable as a brooding and tortured artist who wears a lot of pretty clothes and takes himself far too seriously (watch 'An Evening with Kevin Smith' for the great story of Smith spending time with Prince).

97128,A2IU2BSVWQLKJ7,0790731533,Unlucky Frank,"[3, 3]","I just caught this again on TV. And I must say, I absolutely adore this campy piece of pure nostalgic 80's MTV schmaltz! (Yiddish for sentimental music or art.) Definitely a guilty pleasure.The Purple One gets to brood, smash, slap, pump, preen, pout, pose, possess, and posture his way through, what's essentially, just one long 80's music video, with lots of montage and wide-angle shots of Prince riding his purple Honda thru The Motor City and the surrounding Detroit countryside. I've always wondered if Prince got to pull off his own ""brodies"" on that bike. Or, was it a very short stuntman? (For those of you too young to remember, a ""brody"" was a showy donut or skid performed on a motorcycle or a bike.)The plot is almost laughable, and at times, the story arc makes absolutely no sense. Angry young man as misunderstood genius gets caught up in the abusive pattern of misunderstood father figure, mixed into a traditional battle-of-the-bands rivalry between two flamboyant Funksters trying to make it into the music biz, while out maneuvering each other on their way to the top.However, what's very bright about this screenplay are the romantic role reversals of sexual attraction between the male and female archetypes that sometimes played themselves out during the sexual politics of the 80's, and more tellingly, in Prince's private fantasy world. The film utilizes the androgynous nature of Prince's sexuality in a reverse game of sexual tug-of-war with the glamorous Apollonia to the full effect of Prince's male fantasy ego. Prince takes the feminine passive/agressive role of playing hard-to-get while Apollonia follows along as the libidinously loved-starved male submissive. (Until of course, Prince begins to emulate his abusive role model and starts slapping her around as the object of his derision; a mother figure with little or no self-esteem.) Prince frequently turns to the camera, bats his eyes, shoots that come hither look at the females in the audience with a whisper that says, ""You know you want me. If you can catch me, you can have me."" Pure sexual dynamite!There is an overt depiction of violence against women here that is supposed to serve the storyline. At times, it just looks like an excuse for Prince to play out his real-life passive/agressive male fantasies with his female proteges, and just slap some chicks around a little to show them who's the boss. Pimp! Granted, Prince will always kiss and make up with the objects of his affection.Objectification of male and female sexuality is Prince's trademark. Not only does he want to cream all over the ladies, but he also wants you ladies to cream all over him. Prince wouldn't have it any other way. And as a longtime fan, neither would I.This film is the erotic essence of Prince at his narcissistic best. One gets the feeling that between takes, Prince and the others in the cast were continually fixing their hair and checking themselves out in the mirror. While I would argue that Madonna was merely copying the fashions of what hot young girls were wearing in New York night clubs at the time, Prince was pushing sexual fashion to the very limits with his female proteges. The objectification of his singers was obvious, as they were only allowed to perform scantily clad in the hottest lingerie imaginable.Gents take note: Apollonia is nearly bursting out at the seams of her skin tight bustiere during her sultry sex number in this flick. Very Nice. Prince also takes his turn at objectifying himself as well. Ladies take note: Prince definitely sexes it up in fine style. The concert shots of Prince thrusting, licking, and stroking himself during his energetic dance routine is a pure self-masturbatory celebration of sexual awakening and awareness. It's really a marvelous example of why Prince and his music were so important towards the end of the Free Love Era. (Right before it was destroyed by the looming death spector of AIDS.)SIGN OF THE TIMES: The hair styles are priceless. Geri curls, heavily teased bouffants, hair relaxer, and waves of combed over pompadours. The clothes are vintage. The jackets, ties, and hot lingerie are a total throwback to the 80's. And who could ever forget Prince as The Funky Purple Toreador in his puffy dandy blouse, purple overcoat, skin-tight buttonfly pants, and flamenco boots? Classic!The acting is sometimes wooden and totally camp. Morris Day and Jerome have the funniest parts in the film. Jerome is downright hilarious.The music of course, is CLASSIC! Prince and The Revolution at their Best! And, who can forget Morris Day and The Time? I miss those guys. They don't make funk like this anymore!The film itself is 3 Stars at best.As a Music Video of Prince in the 80's, this is 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!Enjoy this nostalgic trip down Memory Lane.I have to get this!
