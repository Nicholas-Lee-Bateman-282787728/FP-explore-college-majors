686637,AHYMU2N5MBYWC,B00005V1WW,"Amazon Customer ""Steeple Chase Poser""","[1, 5]","(Spoilers below, but the flick's too stupid for it to matter.)Computer technology has greatly aided the filmmaking industry. Twenty years ago, it would have been impossible to create the stunning visual effects seen in ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", let alone an entirely digital movie such as ""Monsters, Inc."" However the prevalence of any new technology is invariably followed by those who would rely on gimmick alone rather than quality. Such is the case with martial arts master Jet Li's latest offering, The One.The One takes place in the future where inter-dimensional travel has become possible. Each dimension runs parallel to our own and is home to the same people, but under different circumstances, living completely different lives. Voyaging to another universe is for authorized dimensional police only. Li plays a former member of this police force going by the name Lawless. We learn, through clumsily constructed exposition, that he has defected after discovering that every time one of his alternate reality selves dies, the `life energy' from the dead self is distributed among the remaining selves. So Li is on a mission to travel to all of the universes and kill himself in each, becoming increasingly more powerful until he becomes `the one' at which point he imagines he'll be unstoppable.As one might guess, Li also plays our hero, Gabe. Gabe is a cop in a universe that isn't aware that other dimensions exist. He lives a happily oblivious life complete with friends on the force and a beautiful wife, T.K. Lawless travels to this universe followed by two other dimensional law enforcers, Funsch and Roedecker. The two try to stop Lawless from killing Gabe, his last remaining twin, and achieving ultimate power. Oh, and did we forget to mention that it may also cause all the universes to explode? Maybe. No one in the film seems sure.Immediately, the premise of this film catches the audience's attention. What if there are other worlds out there? Am I as unique as I believe myself to be? What would I be like if one small element of my life were altered? These are all very intriguing questions and writer/director James Wong took care to ensure that none of them were addressed in this film. Indeed, it appears that all opportunities to include thought-provoking content were patently avoided. The fact that this is an action movie, and a martial arts flick on top of that, suggests that one shouldn't expect in-depth social commentary or even a complex plot, but The One continually disappoints it's viewers by raising interesting concepts and then failing to focus on them.For example, it would have been clever to show Lawless assassinating several different versions of himself, each with a different appearance and lifestyle. This could have easily been done in montage or in a sequence of short combat scenes that would have prepared the audience for the main action of the film. Instead we see only one other version of Li aside from his two main characters and a few humorous images displayed on a computer screen that make it appear as though the director simply gave Li a box of wigs and jackets to play with. Furthermore, the characters are quite weak. We are given brief introductions to each of the main players, but these serve only to remind us of some stereotype or character from another film that we can use as a mental placeholder in lieu of actual character development. After all, this is an action movie; we've got to get to the fighting as quickly as possible. As if that weren't enough of a deterrent, characters are unceremoniously and unnecessarily killed just as we have some semblance of an attachment to them. Both Li's wife, portrayed by the usually brilliant Carla Gugino, and Roedecker, played by the equally talented Delroy Lindo, are executed for no other reason than to motivate Li's good guy character and fuel hatred for his bad guy character, as if the audience could tell the difference.Predictably, the movie culminates in a huge action scene where Li fights himself. It should have been impressive, but was instead boring and much too long. The computer wizardry that allowed Jet Li to kick his own ass was actually so flawless that I forgot to be impressed by it. After Gabe finally defeats Lawless, the film tries to trick us unsuccessfully with the old `which one is which' routine, but I doubt any audience member was fooled. Justice prevails as the evildoer is punished by being transported to a prison universe that looks like the set of a cheap music video. Our hero is rewarded by being sent to yet another alternate reality where he isn't a fugitive for his doppelganger's crimes and his wife is still alive. Gabe doesn't seem to mind that his real wife is dead and he's been presented with a cheap substitute. And how does he or the police know what his wife's history is in this world? He might fall in love with her all over again, only to discover that her favorite actor has changed from Cary Grant to Adam Sandler. Gabe can pretend his soul mate isn't dead, but he better not come crying to the dimension squad when her stand-in turns out to be a lesbian pyromaniac, decoupage lover, or a carnival freak who has undergone complex surgery to make herself a human lizard. ...Actually, that would be pretty cool. Why wasn't the movie about that?Overall, The One has few redeeming qualities. The action has been done better in The Matrix and Jackie Chan's canon, the plot is riddled with holes, and the two accomplished character actors, Lindo and Gugino, can't compensate for the fact that Li still hasn't gotten the hang of the English language. If the premise of The One is true and alternate realities do exist, I hope to one day travel to a universe where they never made this film.",2,"Please, one Jet Li per movie.",1118793600,"06 15,

Who doesn't want to see a bunch of butt-kicking!  I, along with my friends, were part of that cloud of over-zealous movie goers who considered Jet Li the godsend, the one who was going to deliver us from boring cinema and keep us glued to our theater seats.For the most part, I still quite enjoy his films.`The One' is not one that I enjoy.  In fact, even upon its release, I was turned off by the film.  I remember when I first saw the trailer.  I was so excited.  My friend and I had just seen `The Kiss of the Dragon' and we were only TOO excited for more Li action.  This had to be great.  After about three minutes I knew that my expectations were far too high.  Upon further reflection, this has become not only one of the biggest disappointments for me as a movie-goer, but I the end one of the worst films of this past decade.Easy.The plot revolves around single man and his quest to become invincible.  The film presents to us a multiverse, a world where parallel universes contain variations of every individual.  One man has traveled from universe to universe, killing off his other selves in order to gain all their strength.  Things get tricky when he has only one left to kill because that one isn't going down without a fight.And fight they do.The plot is kind of campy in parts and not very well fleshed out, but the biggest disappointment was the action scenes.  This came out around the time when it was cool to make your movies look like video games.  I never understood that, and it always upset me.  This movie is the kind of that concept and it is ultimately a huge failure.  The acting is also very weak.  Jet Li can't really act, but he can fight.  He should stick to that and only that.  The big `this movie will be awesome because Jet Li with fight Jet Li' idea was a big failure because that eventuality is far less impressive than it should be.  I'd rather see Li fight other people in a better choreographed fight scene.

But it has found a place in my heart, and I'll tell you why.I don't know how old you are, so I don't know what movies you watched and loved on TV as a kid.  For me it was cheesy garbage like Dollman, Trancers, and lots of Chuck Norris movies.  Now imagine those movies that you formed grade-school cults around, starring Jet Li.  Your fanaticism would've been much more fanatical, wouldn't it? And instead of looking like morons on the playground while trying to perform Stallone's patented slur/battle-cry from Rambo, this generation of kids will look like morons mimicking authentic kung fu! And that's the big break I cut for it.  It's a cheesy action movie that's relatively kid-friendly, and I think it'll serve some burgeoning movie fans well in their formative years (bad action movies are a necessity to growing boys, you know).And besides that distant sense of nostalgia it gives me, it's also got some pretty darn funny accidental humor (which always works to the credit of these kinds of movies).  You've got Jet Li trying to headbang to a nu-metal song, which he doesn't seem to have the rythm for to begin with, but on top of it all he's trying to do it EVILLY (no knock to the guy's acting, he's just too sweet-natured to look that malevolent).  There's Delroy ""Hnnngh!"" Lindo continuing his on-going quest to manually clench his own eyeballs out of his head Total Recall-style (like DeNiro's famed ""shrug/tic"" and Pacino's revered ""distant stare"", his acting signature is the versatile ""Bug Eye"").  You've got the classic ""motorcycle/man slap-sandwich"" death that could very well be the stuff of legend.  And if that's not the cheesiest, but vaguely creepy and morbid ending ever, then spank my heinie 'cause I think so.So while it's no Hard Target for sheer action thrill/dumb humor, I think it deserves a small place in the b-movie pantheon.

Thank goodness, otherwise we'd never figure out the plot from the disconnected screenplay.`The One' is an interesting concept which combines everything we loved about `The Terminator', `Time Cop,' `The Matrix,' `Sliders' and more. Just like `Sliders' technology has made it possible to travel between alternate universes. Super criminal Jet Li illegally travels from universe to universe with the sole purpose of murdering himself so he can be the one Jet Li.Hot on his trail are supercops Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham (with a bad American accent).The idea of sci-fi and Jet Li as both hero and villain is intriguing.However `The One' falls short of its goal due to several road blocks.Poor dialogue. The disconnected screenplay has characters doing and saying things which make no sense and add nothing to further the story. All the characters seem rather calm even though they are fighting for their lives.Characters' actions make no sense. As with the dialogue it becomes lost as we see characters drift from scene to scene without purpose or awareness. For example the LAPD Jet Li after witnessing a climatic shootout with himself, simply returns home to his wife Carla Gugino as if it is a normal day. You'd think the police would want each of their officers to provide a statement and the shootout would be headline news. Later Li goes to the hospital for a brain scan where at least 5 of his fellow officers go to hangout for no reason.Lindo and Statham also have a pointless existence as they have been hunting Li for 2 years and have witnessed his incredible feats. Yet they calmly ask Li to drop his gun and put his hands on his head. Since Li can dodge bullets, you'd think these two would have realized he's not coming quietly.Bad casting. While Li is a martial arts legend his broken English makes it impossible for us to see him as the good husband cop. The over use of `Matrix' style fight sequences with computer animation negate Li's use of martial arts which makes us question why Li was cast at all.Lindo and Statham come off like Laurel and Hardy as they too seem to take their roles as if they were mere delivery men.`The One' does have some good sci-fi and fight sequences in the beginning but it carries too much baggage which prevents us from enjoying it, thanks to B gen-x director James Wong.",3,A Good Concept Not Realized,1195603200,"11 21, 2007",2007,2394,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'One', 'VHS', 'was', 'introduced', 'own', 'trailer', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'disconnected', 'screenplay.', 'One', 'interesting', 'concept', 'everything', 'loved', 'Terminator', 'Time', 'Cop', 'Matrix', 'Sliders', 'more', 'Just', 'Sliders', 'technology', 'made', 'possible', 'travel', 'alternate', 'universes', 'Super', 'criminal', 'Jet', 'Li', 'illegally', 'universe', 'universe', 'sole', 'purpose', 'murdering', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'Jet', 'Li.Hot', 'trail', 'are', 'supercops', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'bad', 'American', 'accent', 'idea', 'sci-fi', 'Jet', 'Li', 'hero', 'villain', 'intriguing.However', 'One', 'short', 'goal', 'due', 'several', 'road', 'blocks.Poor', 'dialogue', 'disconnected', 'screenplay', 'characters', 'doing', 'saying', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'add', 'nothing', 'further', 'story', 'characters', 'seem', 'rather', 'calm', 'even', 'are', 'fighting', 'lives.Characters', 'actions', 'make', 'sense', 'dialogue', 'lost', 'see', 'characters', 'drift', 'scene', 'scene', 'purpose', 'awareness', 'example', 'LAPD', 'Jet', 'Li', 'witnessing', 'climatic', 'shootout', 'simply', 'home', 'wife', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'normal', 'day', ""'d"", 'think', 'police', 'would', 'want', 'officers', 'provide', 'statement', 'shootout', 'would', 'be', 'headline', 'news', 'Later', 'Li', 'hospital', 'brain', 'scan', 'where', 'least', '5', 'fellow', 'officers', 'go', 'hangout', 'reason.Lindo', 'Statham', 'also', 'have', 'pointless', 'existence', 'have', 'been', 'hunting', 'Li', '2', 'years', 'have', 'witnessed', 'incredible', 'feats', 'calmly', 'ask', 'Li', 'drop', 'gun', 'put', 'hands', 'head', 'Li', 'can', 'dodge', 'bullets', ""'d"", 'think', 'two', 'would', 'have', 'realized', 'not', 'coming', 'quietly.Bad', 'casting', 'Li', 'martial', 'arts', 'legend', 'broken', 'English', 'impossible', 'see', 'good', 'husband', 'cop', 'use', 'Matrix', 'style', 'fight', 'sequences', 'computer', 'animation', 'negate', 'Li', 'use', 'martial', 'arts', 'question', 'why', 'Li', 'was', 'cast', 'all.Lindo', 'Statham', 'come', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'too', 'seem', 'take', 'roles', 'were', 'mere', 'delivery', 'men.', 'One', 'have', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'fight', 'sequences', 'beginning', 'too', 'much', 'baggage', 'enjoying', 'thanks', 'B', 'gen-x', 'director', 'James', 'Wong']",N/A

As only 2 Jets remain in the end, they can move at inhuman speeds, and thus the fight scenes have a Matrix-bullet-time quality to them in which Li fights at normal speed while everything else moves in super slow-motion.  And that, my friends, is everything good and interesting about this movie.The One is a b-grade movie, with terrible dialog, confusing plot points, and rather bad acting.  Think of a bad Van Dahme or Segal movie and you'll understand ""The One.""  The interesting premise of jumping from universe to universe is never fleshed out or explored, nothing on the level of Highlander or that Star Trek episode with Evil Kirk.  The special effects are interesting to watch, but they are strung together haphazardly, and it makes no sense that Li can lift up motorcycles and dodge bullets one moment but can get knocked down by a slow, powerless bunch the next.  The plot doesn't even bother to explain many of its silly action scenes, it just introduces them.  I was touched by the honest romance between Li and Carla Gugino, but that's all.I am a huge fan of Jet Li, but I found this to be one of his worst films in terms of martial arts and action.  The fighting is very sparce and except for a duel in the end, nothing shows of Li's skill or talent.

Not only do you have Jet Li doing his martial arts thing, which he does better than anyone else working in movies today, but he finally faces a worthy opponent (himself); then there's the gorgeous Carla Gugino, who has long been one of my favorite actresses; throw in a visionary, science fiction storyline, all kinds of explosions, some pretty darn impressive CGI, and you've got yourself a movie I will gladly pay to watch.  But it gets better.  The story comes from the minds of X-Files legends Glen Morgan and James Wong, with Wong directing and Morgan serving as co-producer of the story they co-wrote.  Best of all, though, we get to see Jet Li portray a bad guy, and that is something you just don't want to miss.Jet Li plays both of the characters at the heart of this story.  The universe of The One is not even a universe, it's a multiverse, with versions of each person existing simultaneously in each universe; all these different versions of &quot;you&quot; are connected somehow, and the power vacuum left by the death of one &quot;you&quot; is not lost but is shared equally among all of the other versions of &quot;you.&quot;  Travel between the universes is possible through wormholes, and such travel is strictly policed.  When one agent discovers that he can become more powerful by killing one of his counterparts elsewhere, he becomes a renegade who knocks off 123 versions of himself to become almost all-powerful.  Lawless (the bad Jet Li) makes a spectacular escape from the universe cops and comes after the one remaining version of himself out there, Gabe Law (the good Jet Li).  Gabe has naturally been gaining in power and strength himself all this time, and this fact plus his martial arts background makes Gabe a force to be reckoned with.  The movie builds to the ultimate confrontation between these two selves, a nice twist on the struggle between good and evil.I, for the most part, like my martial arts displays realistic and natural; if you're going to use wires and allow for all sorts of superhuman abilities, you'd better do an impressive job with the special effects.  Consider that job done in The One.  Using such devices as different film speed and CGI animation, this movie's special effects are quite impressive; Wong avoids the kind of excess you find in many a Matrix clone.  There are a couple of scenes in which the animation does not look real for a moment or two, but one can easily overlook this because the things that the souped up version of Jet Li does pretty much rock the house.  The fight scenes are in no way diminished by the use of the old hidden wire technique, and you walk away from this movie knowing you have gotten your money's worth of entertainment.  The DVD adds a plethora of special features on the making of the movie, including a commentary by Wong and crew, some good looks at the fight choreography work of Cory Yuen, a really cool animation sequence of one action scene using G.I.

I am just gonna talk about the dvd aspects of the special edition dvd.IMAGE:Colmbia TriStar present the picture in both a 2:17:1 ratio anamorphic widescreen and a full screen format. The widescreen obviously better duplicates the film's original theatrical showing, but the fullscreen often displays more image at the stop and bottom. Because of the short running time of the feature the two choices can be accommodated one the same side of a dual-layered disc. The picture quality is good when the director isn't playing overmuch with filters and lens. It's a little rough and dark at times, but there are no significant moire effects or grain to worry about. I just wish it were more interesting to look at instead of having to stare at all those dull, tiresome, iron-gray tones.SOUND:The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio, which I had admired in Jet Li's previous films, is here merely loud. There is no subtlety, no grace about it anywhere. It's mainly used to underscore every plot action with a pounding. glaring rock beat, whether the scene needs it or not. Occasionally, a bullet will whiz by in a rear speaker or a car will screech around a corner behind us. It seems hardly worth the effort.EXTRAS:As far as special features go, Columbua have produced enough of them to take one's mind off the movie for a while. Like rather than watching the film, you could listen to the audio commentary with director James Wong and various filmmakers with the telivision screen turned off. You could also watch one of four featurettes: ""Jet Li is the One,"" thirteen minutes long, an extended promo with interviews of cast and vrew. ""Multiverse Creates the One,"" eighteen minutes long, detailing the action sewuences, ""About Face,"" six minutes long, examining how the graphic artists enabled Li to fight himself in the finale, and ""The Many Faces of Jet li."" two minutes, another actor promo. Then, there are some filmographies, a brief animatronic comparison, twenty-eight scene selections, and a widescreen theatrical trailer.

He's a great guy and I seriously think he's the modern day Bruce Lee. He'll kick your ass if you cross the line and interfere with his moral obligations. He upholds that moral code when he's the good Jet Li, but unfortunately falls flat as the evil Jet Li, who pretty much dominates the film and was the sole-reason why I and many others plunked down our 8 bucks to see it in the first place.Granted, the bad Jet Li wreaks a lot of havok in the film like crushing throats, shooting and bringing heavy objects down on police officers, and moving at supernatural speeds to hurl people across the room and dodge capture. It's a great popcorn flick and will leave your mouth open in awe and excitement, but that depends if you resent the all-too-familiar special effects and ""so-close-to-Highlander-it's-painful"" plot.

Litton,"[3, 9]","At an early point in ""The One,"" actor Jet Li is strapped to a steel chair, a transport of some kind, and makes the remark, ""The multiverse, every universe in it, is irrational and sloppy."" Take away the scientific nature of that statement, and what you have is a perfect description of writer/director James Wong's martial arts actioner, a recycle bin of old ideas and action sequences, turgid characters and ludicrous plotting. In short, it may very well be one of the worst films ever made.From the very first line, a campy narration that reveals the ""multiverse,"" composed of over one hundred separate universes, I got the feeling that the film had nowhere to go. Seconds later, we're taken to a prison in one of the various universes, where inmate Lawless is being removed from his cell for execution. Played by Jet Li, Lawless is soon gunned down in cold blood by Yulaw, also played by Jet Li. It is here that we learn Yulaw's agenda, hopping from universe to universe, killing his aliases and attaining their strength to become the one and only.Despite capture efforts on the part of the Multiverse Agency, who fear the imbalance of power as a result of Yulaw's killing spree, our fearless, cocky antihero escapes to yet another universe, carrying two bumbling Agency deputies along for the ride. He plans to seek out and destroy Gabe (once again played by Jet Li), a Los Angeles police officer who loves his veterinary wife and has a dog for a pet (so much for characterizations, huh?).The film is a classic case of a bad premise made even worse by lack of imagination on the part of its makers. Let's forget for a moment that the plot recycles bits and scraps from various films, recalling such twists as the old ""Which one is the good guy?"" trick meant to throw us off the track. Not only is such a tactic completely clich&eacute;d and overused, but it burdens the film with predictability, lacking even the good sense to at least try to reverse our initial guess.Even the film's countless scenes of joyless, uninspired action are also to blame. Director Wong seems to have a ""Matrix"" fetish; if the abundance of bullet-dodging sequences, in which a character quickly ducks out of harm's way while the camera trails with the bullet itself, isn't proof of Hollywood's lack of originality, then nothing ever will be. The martial arts fight sequences will no doubt draw comparison to films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but, despite their well-staged appearance, they lack any sort of energy or intensity. Oh, and did I mention the big payoff sequence, a finale with sparks and slow-motion photography that will surely remind younger viewers of the final showdown from Disney's ""The Lion King?""The film's biggest problem is Jet Li himself, who plays a plethora of characters, but can't manage a single worthy performance as any of them. His arrogance and wit in the role of Yulaw are unaffecting and run-of-the-mill, and he seems more focused on those two traits than he does in making this antagonist into a fearsome figure. Since Gabe is little more than a pawn in Yulaw's game of chess, the story gives us little reason to care whether or not he lives or dies. In fact, by film's end, you may find yourself pleading with the writers to just kill them both and end it all.The good news is, Li looks right at home with the material. The bad news is, this debacle feels about as entertaining as an MRI. ""The One"" does succeed in inciting us to question the lucidity and good judgment of its characters and writers, whose efforts never rise above juvenile. Martial arts aficionados will undoubtedly embrace the film with such praiseful compliments as ""breathtaking"" and ""eye-popping.""

686662,A1XX5797TIZT5Q,B00005V1WW,D. Mok,"[0, 2]","I'm being a bit generous with my rating this time.  Jet Li's previous two Hollywood outings, Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon, are so incredibly bad that I've kept my expectations low.Happily, The One delivers in much grander style than any Li film since Lethal Weapon 4.  Is it a cinematic masterpiece?  No.  Is it an emotional tour de force?  Negative.  But is it enjoyable, and does it deliver excitement and entertainment?  I would definitely say so.I was originally suspicious of the PG-13 rating.  Action films and the PG-13 rating don't tend to mix well.  But director James Wong (Final Destination) is imaginative enough that the PG-13's usual restrictions aren't a big hurdle for him.  Though some of the special effects and production design look quite cheesy (the &quot;wormhole&quot; device looks like a Zoom drum machine!), the whole package is delivered with enough sense of fun to make you suspend disbelief.Li hasn't quite overcome his linguistic limitations, but Wong was smart to evoke in Li the villainy that had made his Lethal Weapon 4 turn so interesting.  And freed of the pretensions towards condescending, Oriental mystical nonsense (as in Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon), we can relate to Li's character much more.  Carla Gugino doesn't exactly get the deepest role here, but she's very likeable and provides Li with his first believable love interest, and Delroy Lindo just steals the show with a hilarious, surprising dual-role appearance.  His second entrance is easily the funniest moment in the film.  And Jason Statham manages to make us forget those awful Guy Ritchie movies from which he came.The script moves along briskly and the pacing is tight, the fight sequences very well staged and shot, with extra marks going to the slam-bang sound effects.

An absolute abomination to kung-fu films (and moviedom in general), ""The One"" is an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. I had to watch ""American Beauty"" 8 times in a row to stop feeling dirty about myself.What's wrong about the movie? Well, if we were to count the number of groans it elicited from me ... one. One big looooooong groan, as long as the movie itself. Maybe that's REALLY to what the title referred. Apart from the ""Dragonball Z"" ""I'm a really powerful evil guy trying to get stronger and, oh wait I just need to kill this one last guy to become the STRONGEST IN THE MUTLIVERSE!"" plot, the utterly terrible soundtrack, horribly CGI-enhanced fight scenes, boring pace, laughably bad acting ... nothing! It's a perfectly fine movie!Jet Li proves once again how badly he acts. Early Ah-nold was more convincing in ""Hercules Goes Bananas"". Every time he has an emotion, it's the same expression -- like he was just pinched. Really hard. It's sad, really. He's also a mediocre martial artist. I don't remember any of the really great kung-fu movies needing slo-mo Matrix camera moves.Giving this movie much more in the way of a review would be almost acknowledging it as a film, so I'll stop here in a moment. I will say that the catch-22 in the movie was okay, but naturally they copped out with it in the end. Oh well. Not like it could've saved this.If you want a kung-fu movie where the action is real, the plot is good, and you actually have a sense of reverence for the main character, rent either ""Enter the Dragon"" with Mr. Bruce ""Wataw!""

686664,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,B00005V1WW,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[1, 1]","For a Jet Li movie, The One is most original, blending martial arts with a sci-fi environment and matrix-like effects.  The idea is great, and you may fall in love with ""the idea"" more than the movie itself.  Unfortunately, despite the martial arts, The One executes itself too poorly.The most memorable element of the film is that there are 2 Jet Li's.  Well, 123 to be exact from 123 different universes, but it comes down to the last 2, and the ""evil"" Jet Li charcater is obsessed with becoming ""the one"".  If he kills off the good Jet Li character, he will become invincibly powerful, though he is nearly there.  Near the end, the final fight is good Li vs bad, a decent fight that lasts 7 minutes, but uses the matrix like effects in the fight poorly.  They kinda look cool at first, but if you get too much into it visually, it just looks pretty weak and breaks up the flow of the martial arts styles throughout the fight.I have to say the rest of the cast is pretty dull, except maybe Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham, who play 2 agents from the alternate universe trying to stop the evil Li character.  For Jason Statham fans, he's got a pretty large role in The One, but don't expect his character to know how to fight like in the Transporter movies.The acting is rather weak too, and again, the movie relies a lot off of visual effects, and most just don't do the justice if you have seen the matrix one too many times.  There is a scene where the evil Li character picks up 2 motorcycles and knocks around some cops with them, that actually looked pretty neat.The originality of this movie, the martial arts, and the good Jet Li vs bad Jet Li still give this movie a 4 stars.  I absoultely loved this movie when it first came out, because I thought oh who cool this is for Jet Li.

686666,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005V1WW,Eric,"[3, 4]","The One features an extremely silly, but also very intriguing premise.  You see, our world is only one of over 100 (I can't remember the exact number, was it 125?)parallel universes that exist.  You have a different personality in another world, and if you actually travel to these other worlds and kill another version of you, then you gain his or her power.  That's exactly what Jet Li is trying to do, and there are a couple of multiverse cops out to stop him.  This is all just build-up for a big one-on-one fight between the two Jet Lis, so you're basically watching 80 minutes of B.S.But that's not to say the idea doesn't hold any promise.  It's just that the movie ignores the concept in favor of big fight scenes.  Being an action fan and all, that's perfectly fine with me, except the action in this movie fails to generate any thrills since they're way too exaggerated and involve waaayyy too much wirework.  And is it just me or does anyone else find the premise of Jet Li fighting Jet Li incredibly lame?  The fun of watching a martial arts fight is seeing two different individuals going head-to-head, mano-a-mano.  In this case, the fight is computer-aided and not even entirely convincing.The One does feature a few good actors, particularly Delroy Lindo and Jason Statham, both of whom are fine here, though I would have liked to have seen Statham kick a little more butt.  He's definitely got the makings of a top-notch action icon, certainly moreso than the overrated Vin Diesel. But at least we can always watch The Transporter for that (which is, by the way, a far more entertaining action thriller).As for Li himself, he's stuck in a role that doesn't do him many favors.  First, you have to wonder how his evil self is able to find his alternate versions in all the other universes if they have different names.  Best explanation I can see is that he broke into the multiverse database and tracked down all the versions of himself out there, which actually raises another question: how does the multiverse keep track of everybody on every alternate universe?There are the usual paradoxes of an alternate universe, that being the fact the parallel worlds can't be too different if there is a physically identical twin of yourself in all these other worlds (meaning your parents would have had to have hooked up at the exact same time for all 125 worlds) and all versions of yourself would probably have to die at the exact same time, so as to make certain no other weird influences would occur (say, one version of yourself dies suddenly, but another one goes on and marries and has kids the other one wouldn't have; kind of screws up the order, doesn't it?).  But according to this movie, not everyone dies at the same time in these alternate worlds, which begs the question of why there aren't any super-powerful geriatrics.  After all, there must be at least one old man or woman who gains all the remaining power of those who died.Best not to think of such things with a movie like this.  Makes your head hurt after awhile.  But really, I recommend you just miss this movie altogether.  There are a couple of enjoyable moments, including a scene where Li handcuffs some cops together and to a chair, but there's too much CGI at work, not enough thrills, and certainly not enough brains to pull this premise off.

There are an infinite number of parallel universes, and in each one there is one of us.  We are the same person in each, but different (married to the same woman in one universe, married to a guy in the next, as a bit player ""explains"").  Li illegally (of course) moves from one universe to the next, gaining strength as he kills his parallels selves until just two are left.Amazing effects, like Li's encounter with the motorcycle cops or his Matrix-esque dodging of bullets.  But it is his martial arts ability which makes this flick.  The movies is almost a 90 minute warm up for the Li vs. Li inevitable fight, and man, that sure does not disappoint! This may well be the most amazing martial arts battle I have ever seen.Tons of action, and more than a bit of humor to break the tension.  Fine support by DelRoy Lindo.

You can dodge bullets, become ultra smart, ultra strong... basically like Neo. Kill all the other versions and the universe either explodes, or you become god. So is THE One's plan until he meets his last version, and since both THE One and The One are both on equal power, this One might be a bit harder to kill. If you're not confused yet, then by all means buy the movie.For the action/sci-fi fan, there's plenty of entertainment to behold, and much to sink your teeth in. From the original premise, to fight sequences to the general action, there's certainly enough to keep you going, and the movie succeeds where it should fail. Add a young Jason Statham, and you got a great popcorn flick.

The concept (while fascinating) is handled in b-movie fashion with an above-average budget, with special emphasis placed on all the wrong things.One of the reasons that 'Kiss Of The Dragon' was so effective was that they kept the slow-motion camera work to a minimum, leaving us to be entertained by Jet Li's naturally fast reflexes and superb choreography, not to mention a great soundtrack.In 'The One', it's bad enough that the script is virtually non-existant, the action is far from Li's best, and the comic-book rendering of his fights detract from his greatest strength: real-time combat.I laughed every time they brought the camera onto the 'tracking device', which they did 3 or 4 times at least.  The director must have thought to get the most out of that particular effect by doing so, and the result is comical at best.Especially bad is the final fight scene, which is overlong, and unimpressive.

Once I was able to see it, I thought it was a very good movie, but not perfect. The concept of a multiverse makes for good sci-fi and this movie was definately interesting to me. The story goes like this: there are 123 universes that make up the multiverse, and in each universe there is a different version of each person that exists in the other universes. Jet Li plays Gabe Law, a cop in one universe. In another universe he is Yu Law, a man obsessed with power. Power and strength are divided equally among the 123 universes, and each time of of the variants dies, his power is divided among the rest of the men. So Yu Law has been illegally been traveling within the multiverse and has killed all but one of &quot;himself&quot; and himself. Sound complicated yet? It may be to some people but watching it clears a lot up. So two multiverse agents are after Yu Law since he has murdered all of the others, and Gabe Law is drawn in to stop him also. The balance in the multiverse could be destroyed if there is only one left. So that is that in a nutshell. The movie is loaded with great fight scenes and special effects that make for a visual treat. My favorite scene is in the beginning when Yu Law kills the guy while he is in police custody. Now this movie is not perfect, and it does get to a point where it gets a little dull for a while. Just be patient because it does get better, especially with the fight between Gabe and Yu Law. Some people are giving this movie negative reviews because of the unoriginality. Is it unoriginal? Perhaps to a certain extent. Are the special effects a rip-off of movies like the Matrix? Somewhat. But this isnt the first movie to copy elements from that movie and it sure will not be the last. If you are a sci-fi fan you may enjoy this movie. If you just want to see a good action movie with awesome special effects, check this one out. You may or may not like it, it is a matter of taste.

686684,AK81WLVD5KGUX,B00005V1WW,"John S. Ryan ""Scott Ryan""","[10, 17]","This movie has a great concept and it has Jet Li. How in the world could it have turned out so badly?The concept is a pretty cool one. There's not just one universe, see; there's a 'multiverse'. (SF readers will already have their own list of favorite alternative-universe novels. One of mine is James Hogan's _Paths to Otherwhere_.) It's possible for people in one universe to access the others via wormholes. And for some reason, whenever one version of a person gets killed, all of that version's 'energy' gets redistributed over the ones who are still alive.There's something of a plot based on this idea. There are 125 versions of Jet Li in the multiverse. One of him -- formerly a member of the elite corps that protects the multiverse from untoward interference -- has killed 123 of the others. The two that are left, sharing as they do the energy formerly parcelled out among all 125, are now really really fast and really really strong. And the bad one is trying to kill the good one, and thus become (drum roll, please) the One.Okay, it's not going to pass muster with most SF readers. But with a good screenplay and the right production, it could have been a good movie; _Timecop_ suffered from similar logical problems and yet turned out to be a fine film.This one doesn't have a good screenplay or the right production.What it _does_ have is Jet Li, which is why I gave it three stars. The guy is amazing to watch. Unfortunately, there's not enough martial-arts stuff to sustain fans who are _watching_ it for the martial-arts stuff. And there's not enough of anything else to sustain fans who are watching it for any other reason.It's one big Duhh after another. Is there, for example, any good reason why _these_ two Jet Lis look exactly alike (when we've already seen, via a computer-screen summary of the previous murders, that the _other_ 123 Jet Lis range from blonde to dreadlocked)?

In fact I wished I could give it a 5 star rating but it does not warrant it.There are lots of good things about this movie, not least being the wonderful marshall arts choerography or the tantalising thought of Jet Li in action against himself! The storyline is not a new one for science fiction fans as the alternative universe concept has been around for years. Indeed Michael Morcock has turned it into an almost comic book art form. But it has not been given a real airing on the big screen. As an aside this particular idea is a real theory in cosmology and one which is gaining a large number of adherents. Getting back to the movie, there is a pretty good plot which only starts to unravel after the movie is about half-way through. Jet Li once again demonstrates that the martial arts genre has more to offer than the clownish antics of Jackie Chan, and that there is a more artistic and darker side to it. His most recent roles suggest that Li will become an even bigger star as he certainly has a greater breadth than Chan.Now to the downside. There are some contradictions within the plot certainly. It takes 123 deaths to give the bad guy the strength and everything else he accrues on his way to being the One but for the good guy, he only starts to gain this as he becomes the target. The real problem with this movie for me is the close resemblances to Highlander and Timecop. Not so much in the actuality as Li is not choppoing off the heads of others but killing versions of himself, nor is he time travelling and trying to restore a situation but in the rather lame Van Damme storylines and devices. A better perspective would have been the sort of Millenium approach which certainly was a darker view.The ending was a bit naff too particularly on the Hades universe where it ended up looking like a Playstation game but all set up for a sequel.All in all a pretty good movie, kept the attention and was entertaining and fun to watch.

The DVD itself is pretty good, but doesn't stand out from those of other movies. It's got the typical special features and commentary, like most movies. Since the DVD doesn't stand out, I'll get to my review on the movie itself.The One was overall a pretty good movie, with lots of interesting ideas, but it had some faults as well. What I liked best about it was the fact that The One was original, as far as the setting goes. The idea that there is a copy of each person in each of the many dimensions was original. Other high points included the special effects, camera angles, and stunts. All of these were brought together in the scene where Jet Li fights a copy of himself. However, there were low points in The One as well. For one, I thought that there was too much action in this movie, which somewhat ruined the plot. For instance, most of the movie was fight scenes, which got old after a while. However, since Jet Li is relatively good at fight scenes, that wasn't much of a problem. Another thing that I disliked about this movie was that it seemed like a stereotypical Jet Li film; all action and little plot. The One was almost exactly like Hero and other Jet Li films specifically because most of it was occasionally mindless action. Also, the dialog of The One wasn't great, and occasionally hard to understand, and I thought that the writing wasn't up to par with the special affects and stunts. However, with a great story, setting and ideas, this movie kept me entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. For that, I give it seven stars. If you like action movies with intense and good martial arts sequences, then you'll love this movie. However, if you don't enjoy action sequences, then The One will most likely bore you.

The rest of the movie falls under itself in tired cliches, a silly plot, and weak acting. But the action is cool. The story involves a multiverse, a collection of different universes. Everyone has a copy of themselves in each universe. Kill one of yourself and you get stronger. Kill all of them, and you become the one. It's not as confusing as it sounds, but it does have many plot holes that don't help the movie.

It seems every action hero has to eventually face himself. Literally, by playing his twin. Jet Li decided to get a head start by doing this movie relatively early in his career.I really didn't expect much of this movie. The plot is complex: 125 parallel dimensions exist. A member of the Multiverse Bureau of Investigation accidentally kills one of his alteregos in a parallel universe and discovers that he becomes stronger, faster, and more powerful. Realizing that, if he kills all of his multiple selves, this process can make him a god, he goes off on a killing spree in the most egregious example of self-loathing this side of sci-fidom.WAY too many critics put this movie down for its special effects. Specifically, that the effects mimic the Matrix. So what? Seeing Jet grab two motorcycles, one in each hand, and smash a man to death with them is a thrill. He kicks cops out of thin air, dodges bullets, and jumps across buildings. That's the best part of the movie.The problem is, Jet Li just can't act. Or I should say, he can't act well. The plot demands a lot of him -- this is a rare instance of a script being better than the actor can handle. Jet Li is supposed to weep over his wife's loss, act in multiple roles as his multiple selves, display rage, hope, madness...more than most people display in a year. Jet can't do it. His English is quite good, but he simply doesn't have the range.And in a movie all ABOUT range, Jet can't pull it off. But that's okay, what he does is some amazing martial arts, demonstrates really cool special effects, and provides a funky plotline that inspired me enough to want to run a mini-campaign in this setting (maybe I will, hmmm).

""The One"" calls the attention to Jet Li as Yulaw, a Multiverse agency renegade who has the ability to travel into alternate and parallel universes and grows stronger with every person that he kills. But for Yulaw to become ""the one"", he will have to face his ultimate challenge yet...himself! That's right! He faces against another Jet Li as Gabe, a police officer who leads a carefree life with his lovely wife (Carla Gugino, ""Snake Eyes""). But Gabe's life is suddenly shattered when Yulaw enters the present world and attempts to kill Gabe off in order to be the last one standing...but not before two Multiverse agents (Delroy Lindo, Jason Statham) can stop Yulaw first. So, basically it's a fight to the death for both Gabe and the ruthless Yulaw.

Even if the general idea existed, it either was not, or could not, be done well on film before. James Cameron's _The Terminator_, Ridley Scott's _Alien_ and _Blade Runner_, Lucas' _Star Wars_, and Spielberg's _Jaws_ and _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ all achieved this in one way or another._The One_ enters this select company both by virtue of originality (I have seen the general premise once or twice before, but never on film) and because even had someone attempted this before, it couldn't have been done as well.The basic idea of _The One_ is that there are a large number of parallel dimensions, each with a slightly different history (in this one, George Bush became president; in another, it might have been Dole, Gore, or someone even less likely). In each of these universes exists a parallel version of ourselves, as we would be if we'd grown up there. In one of these universes, dimensional travel has been perfected; people can go from one to the other. And one of those people discovers that if he kills off his duplicates, he becomes stronger, faster, smarter; there is some kind of mystical connection between all these parallels, and the power of all is divided up among those that are left; accordingly, he's travelling through the dimensions, slowly eliminating all his parallel selves. The hero of our story is his last remaining duplicate, who has been trying to understand what has been happening to him recently.Scenes involving such superhuman abilities simply couldn't be done well before this, and few actors other than Jet Li would be able to pull them off convincingly even with special-effects assistance. The pacing is excellent, the plotline fascinating (the bad guy's being chased by a couple of dimensional cops who have an additional concern beyond the fact that this guy's committing multiple homicides: according to some dimensional theory, if he succeeds in eliminating all the others, it will cause a cataclysm), and the action is simply top-notch.The ending is surprising, and extremely cool. It leaves the possibility of a sequel open, but doesn't require one, either. Highly recommended.

686718,A10Q9341H2LYX0,B00005V1WW,Shan Wickremesinghe,"[1, 1]","Like a preceding film Highlander, this film has a similar theme. One man sets out to kill his alternate selves to gain an ultimate power. There are 125 alternate universes and Gabriel Yulaw (Jet Li) is from the one which has the means to travel to all others and polices the means of that travel.He is a former police officer of the Multiverse Authority who has discovered that by killing each of his alternate selves, he becomes faster, smarter and more powerful. His eventual aim is to kill them all and become The One. No one seems to be sure whether he'll become a god or this universe will end, in fact no-one, including Yulaw himself has any idea. It's clearly not stopping him from trying though. Obviously not a man overflowing with brotherly love when he says how his alternates are wasting their potential so he might as well be putting it to good use. Given how disreputable most of his alternates look, he does seem to have a valid point. We see him kill one of his two remaining alternates and then escape the local police before being captured by his former teammates.He doesn't stay imprisoned for long. Thanks to an exploding rodent (!) he escapes in search of the last of his alternates. This would be Gabe, who is married to a nice vet. He is perplexed as to why he has been getting stronger and faster himself. It turns out that each surviving alternate gets equally stronger as the power is equally redistributed after each death. Yulaw has the jump on everyone else as he knows what is going on and none of his alternates know about him, let alone trying to kill him.The fighting is very cartoon like, with people being thrown about like rag dolls, heavy objects being thrown about like styrofoam and impossible physical feats such as springing high walls in a single bound. That's the point though, it's deliberately meant to be over the top.The problem with this very slight film (it is all but over by the 70 minute mark) is ironically that it takes too long to get to what we want to see. A full on hand to hand fight of Jet Li vs Jet Li, as opposed to all the skirmishes where the two didn't really connect up to that point. The fight is extraordinary but it takes its time getting there. In the acting department, no one really distinguishes themselves apart from Jet Li, who does put some menace into Gabriel Yulaw. There are some people in this film we would expect a lot better from. Some of the other performances are actually quite embarrassing in fact.This is one of those films that it pays not to think too hard about. Since they would have worked out what Yulaw was up to well before getting this far, they should have been able to trap him by then. You'd also think that they'd send more than two men to get him if he was so dangerous. What especially bothered me was that for someone so powerful, they repeatedly manage to capture Yulaw again and again and if it weren't for some fortuitous (and often stupid) events allowing his escape each time, the movie would have come to an even more premature end. You especially have to worry about the people running the whole show with such decisions as to how they decide at the end which of the 2 Jet Li's is their man. I would have also thought that the number of alternate universes would have been a base 2 multiple like 128. Like I said, best not to think of these things too much.Overall, this film is not as good as it could have been. It failed to really explore the potential of the idea it was based on. Yulaw's fate at the end of the film was intriguing though and it would be intriguing to have seen where that led. I would recommend ""Time and Tide"" (directed by Tsui Hark - non sci-fi) as a much better action film or The Matrix instead.They should learn more from Asian cinema. If Jet Li or Jackie Chan had never made it in the US, or outside Asia it would have been our loss, not theirs. They have made some great films in Hong Kong which are worth chasing down (Once upon a Time in China and Police Story 3:Supercop) and the makers of their American films should learn more from them.From a couple of X-Files alumni (James Wong and Glen Morgan) and was originally planned as a vehicle for Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Well known fight choreographer Corey Yuen helped create the fights in this film. The extras on the DVD are fascinating, with 3 features about the making of the film, a lot of which dealt with the techniques used to make it look convincing that Jet Li was fighting Jet Li. It's well worth seeing these to get an insight into the complexities of movies that use a lot of special effects.Not a huge success at the box office, with a budget of $50-60 million and grossing about $44 million in the US and Canada and about $40 million on domestic video rentals. Hopefully for the makers, the film was pushed into the black with overseas takings. Even though I was not overly satisfied with this film, I am a little curious to know what happened next and wouldn't mind an (unlikely) sequel. Will Gabe survive in a world where he has no job and shares all the identifying characteristics of a man declared dead by the authorities? Will Yulaw become King of the Hill?Not really a very successful as a film but worth a look for the excellent fight at the end and 3 very good features about the making of the film.

Its appealing premise - parallel universes, populated by variants of every individual, and one guy who wants to increase his own power by eliminating his other ""selves"" - is forgotten almost as soon as it's introduced. It's blown aside by what are presumably this film's only real reasons for existing: Jet Li and digital effects. Specifically, Jet Li fighting himself by virtue of digital effects.

In those different realities, there isn't just one you, but many. Each is unique, with different lives, and each helps keep a balance that makes us all ""normal."" Now what do you suppose would happen if you could potentially kill all those other versions of ""you,"" forcing the multiverse to distribute the energies amongst the rest of ""you"" existing out there? Would it make this you stronger, faster, smarter, with abilities well beyond normal ""men?"" And what would happen if you did it again and again, attempting to become ""the one?""When I watch a Jet Li film, I'm not sure exactly what to expect from him. Sometimes his moves range in the realms of normal mean, and sometimes his moves go well beyond that. In movies like Legend of the Swordsman and Black Mask, he's shown us that he can not only do the amazing, but that he can do it convincingly. And that's why, in The One, I found myself appeased even in the slightest. The storyline itself was one that hinged on a premise that nobody really knows how to answer. It posed to the cast a dilemma, asking what would happen if someone actually managed to become ""the one."" Some hinted that it would undo everything, too, and some hinted that it would perhaps make that one be able to accomplish everything. And that motivation, the becoming of something almost godlike, was what drove the killing forward. I liked that, and I liked the fact that each killing made Jet Li more efficient as the story progressed.Unfortunately the good comes with the bad, and someone spiked my time with a little too much drama, not enough action, and some ""time cop"" like action along the way. The development of the marriage in the main Jet Li's worked well at first, but it started sucking a lot of time away from the person we all wanted to see; the Jet Li with a need to kill. In order to stop what we wanted to happen from happening, we were also told that the multiverse is policed and those police drop in, burn some time, and don't really work out that well, either. They liked to talk for some reason, sometimes doing a little of this and a little of that, but mostly taking away from the action that the movie started showing me and abruptly took away. So, that was a downside.Yes, somewhere along the way something went wrong. I'm not sure why it happened and why the movie didn't simply cut out the middle of the film, but it didn't.

Now he is gone to Hollywood, and surely we miss him, not because his skills are not to be seen on big screen, but because he is utterly ""Hollywood-nized.""  Though he is experiencing bigger things there, true fans know him through his films made in Hong Kong, and they know they are right.""The One"" is a sort of one extended, or I should say, stretched episode of ""X-Files"" series, which the director James Wong is deeply involved.  Like his previous film ""Final Destination,"" the film is built upon one unique premise, and here we are told in the opening that the universe is in reality a muti-verse, consisting of 125 different versions of the world.  In one of them, Mr, Gore is the president of USA while in another Mr. Bush.  On the basis of that concept, now Li can play 125 versions of himself, but ... do we need to watch all of them while one of them is already formidable?Anyway, one evil Ji, coming out of one universe, travels to kill off all other versions of him, and the last one is a good guy Li, who must confront the other Li with a help from the policemen that watch over the prohibited interactions between those universes.  As those policeman, Delroy Liodo (""Romeo Must Die"") and Jason Statham (""Lock Stock..."") appear.Interested?  Unfortunately, the film, short as it is, doesn't  afford to hold our attention long as it sounds on paper, simply because of these following clear factors.  Reason One: Li is a great action hero on his own, who doesn't need any other ""one"".  Reason Two: the fact is that we have seen similar settings already; say, for example, ""The Matrix""  (And you may be reminded of ""Timecop"" with its alternate world image and the multi-universe cops.)  The film starts promisingly, but soon we realize that it has little to offer after it sets up its whole rules.The actions themselves are shot very excitngly, thanks to, of course, Li's nimble movements, but CGI generated scenes are, to be frank, below average, sometimes looking as unnnatural as characters on TV games (but excuse me for saying that, if that is exactly the point).  The final battle between the good Li and bad Li is fairly exciting, but still there sticks one little though in my mind while watching it -- that is, why need two Lis when one is great and cool enough?  And as for Carla Gugino (mom of ""The Spy Kids""), the director is hugely guilty of misusing her, wasting her beautiful and sexy presence, and  totally ignoring her  potential as playing more than a secondary, disposable character.  The way she is used is as misguided as letting Jet Li hold guns (does he need?), and the latter kind of Hollywood-type action is obviously a dead giveaway that they still don't learn the essence of Li's actions.I said these harsh things because, so far, Ji's Hollywood-made movies are not well-received in Asia, and though we still follow the master's path, namely from ""Lethal Weapon 4"" to ""The One,"" we don't know for sure; don't know what to do with them.  if you really want to know what Li can do with his charismatic acting as one-and-only action hero, see his ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series.  What he needs is the director Tsui Hark's flair for presenting genuinely thrilling, outrageously exciting martial arts jet-coaster sequence.",3,"In Short, The Good Li vs The Evil Li;  Just an OK Action?",1023062400,"06 3, 2002",2002,3383,"['Many', 'people', 'might', 'remember', 'Jet', 'Li', 'many', 'Asian', 'fans', 'still', 'Li', 'Lian', 'Jie', 'maestro', 'Shaolin', 'martial', 'arts', 'Now', 'gone', 'Hollywood', 'surely', 'miss', 'not', 'skills', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'utterly', 'Hollywood-nized', 'experiencing', 'bigger', 'things', 'there', 'true', 'fans', 'know', 'films', 'made', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'know', 'are', 'right', 'One', 'sort', 'one', 'extended', 'should', 'say', 'stretched', 'episode', 'X-Files', 'series', 'director', 'James', 'Wong', 'deeply', 'involved', 'previous', 'film', 'Final', 'Destination', 'film', 'built', 'one', 'unique', 'premise', 'here', 'are', 'told', 'opening', 'universe', 'reality', 'muti-verse', 'consisting', '125', 'different', 'versions', 'world', 'one', 'Mr', 'Gore', 'president', 'USA', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'basis', 'concept', 'now', 'Li', 'can', 'play', '125', 'versions', 'do', 'need', 'watch', 'one', 'already', 'formidable', 'Anyway', 'one', 'evil', 'Ji', 'coming', 'one', 'universe', 'travels', 'kill', 'off', 'other', 'versions', 'last', 'one', 'good', 'guy', 'Li', 'who', 'must', 'confront', 'other', 'Li', 'help', 'policemen', 'watch', 'prohibited', 'interactions', 'universes', 'policeman', 'Delroy', 'Liodo', 'Romeo', 'Must', 'Die', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'appear.Interested', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'short', ""n't"", 'afford', 'hold', 'attention', 'long', 'paper', 'simply', 'following', 'clear', 'factors', 'Reason', 'One', 'Li', 'great', 'action', 'hero', 'own', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'other', 'one', 'Reason', 'Two', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'settings', 'already', 'say', 'example', 'Matrix', 'may', 'be', 'reminded', 'Timecop', 'alternate', 'world', 'image', 'multi-universe', 'cops', 'film', 'promisingly', 'soon', 'realize', 'little', 'offer', 'up', 'whole', 'rules.The', 'actions', 'are', 'shot', 'very', 'excitngly', 'thanks', 'course', 'Li', 'nimble', 'movements', 'CGI', 'generated', 'scenes', 'are', 'be', 'frank', 'below', 'average', 'sometimes', 'looking', 'as', 'unnnatural', 'characters', 'TV', 'games', 'excuse', 'saying', 'exactly', 'point', 'final', 'battle', 'good', 'Li', 'bad', 'Li', 'fairly', 'exciting', 'still', 'one', 'little', 'mind', 'watching', 'why', 'need', 'two', 'Lis', 'when', 'one', 'great', 'cool', 'enough', 'Carla', 'Gugino', 'mom', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'director', 'hugely', 'guilty', 'misusing', 'wasting', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'presence', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'potential', 'playing', 'more', 'secondary', 'disposable', 'character', 'way', 'used', 'as', 'misguided', 'letting', 'Jet', 'Li', 'hold', 'guns', 'need', 'latter', 'kind', 'Hollywood-type', 'action', 'obviously', 'dead', 'giveaway', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'essence', 'Li', 'actions.I', 'said', 'harsh', 'things', 'because', 'so', 'far', 'Ji', 'Hollywood-made', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'well-received', 'Asia', 'still', 'follow', 'master', 'path', 'namely', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4', 'One', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Li', 'can', 'do', 'charismatic', 'acting', 'one-and-only', 'action', 'hero', 'see', 'Once', 'Time', 'China', 'series', 'What', 'director', 'Tsui', 'Hark', 'flair', 'presenting', 'genuinely', 'thrilling', 'outrageously', 'exciting', 'martial', 'arts', 'jet-coaster', 'sequence']",N/A
