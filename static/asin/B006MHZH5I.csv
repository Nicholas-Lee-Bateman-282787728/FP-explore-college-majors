1517397,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006MHZH5I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 26]","I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste. But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face. They have less replay value. If you are a fan of a particular comedian and you follow them, you have to expect that you will hear some material that they've used successfully in the past. The most common complaint I see leveled at comedy DVDs are that the jokes aren't fresh. That's right, folks--every time a comedian steps up to the stage, his entire act isn't going to be newly devised and original. And if you were going to tape a show for the general public to buy, wouldn't you use jokes and material that have proven popular and successful? I would!That said, I'm a fan of comedian Sebastian Maniscalco.  In his latest comedy endeavor ""What's Wrong With People?,"" he does cover a number of topics that will be familiar to those that have followed his career.  The entire set is dedicated to the daily annoyances of living in the modern world.  And just about everything annoys Maniscalco, and rightly so.  It's an absurd world we live in, and making fun of ourselves and our peculiarities provides plenty of comedic material.  As I said, the themes that he employs over this 75 minute concert are quite familiar but Maniscalco executes the jokes with precision.  I have found oftentimes that comedians will lead with their strongest material, but there tends to be a middle section that lags.  I found this to be evenly paced and quite funny throughout.In truth, I don't know that ""What's Wrong With People?"" is the most uproarious performance that I've seen from Maniscalco.  In this case, though, I don't know that it matters.  I'm giving this my highest ranking for two reasons: (1) I laughed consistently and (2) I agreed with EVERYTHING he said.  I so strongly identified with the material, I felt he was reading my mind.  So I had a very personal connection with this set.  Perhaps I am just too easily annoyed!  Sebastian Maniscalco is a big talent that deserves wider recognition, so if you aren't familiar with him--please check this out.  It probably helps if you're a curmudgeon, but this humor is easy to identify with and very funny.

1517399,A2GTS9FVQDFWAJ,B006MHZH5I,LilRedVette,"[9, 9]","Three months ago, I purchased this Sebastian Maniscalco dvd for my 87 old mother.  I was looking for a stand up comedy act along the lines of Pat Cooper who my mother greatly enjoyed.  I had never heard of Sebastian Maniscalco before I saw his dvd on Amazon.  It's hard to find good standup comedy acts these days that are PG or even PG-13 rated that would be appropriate, i.e. ""clean"" for ""older"" audiences. After reading some of the reviews and for around $10, I figured I would at least give Sebastian's ""What's Wrong With People"" a try.Three months ago when my mom and my sisters sat down to watch this Sebastian dvd, my mom was working and driving and continuing to lead an active and productive life. She enjoyed her time with her 3 children and several grandchildren and great grandchildren. She also loved old movies and stand up comedy acts and she absolutely loved Sebastian's ""What's Wrong With People"".  She must have watched it literally a hundred times and would laugh hysterically each time as if it was the first time she had ever seen it.  My entire family would watch along with her and besides seeing the joy it brought to mom, it was also a huge hit with all of us. We probably can recite most of his performance verbatim.Sebastian's dvd turned out to be the best medicine mom could ever get.  She was soon after diagnosed with cancer and three days ago it took her life.  She was quoting lines from Sebastian's dvd right up to the time she was unable to speak. Sebastian will never know what his dvd meant to all of us and the joy he brought my mother in her final days.  We have emailed him to let him know how much joy he brought our family seeing mom so happy but I'm sure we're just one of thousands of emails he receives so it is understandable that we have not heard back yet. I just hope that one day, he comes across ours just so he knows how much he was part of our family.I'm not going to review his ""What's Wrong With People"" dvd because you can read other people's reviews for that. My words of advice are just this...If you are lucky enough to still have your parents or grandparents in your life and they enjoy comedy, sit down with them, hold their hand, tell them how much you love them and watch Sebastian's ""What's Wrong With People"" together. I'm so grateful my family had the opportunity to do this with my mother.Update:  Sebastian returned my email just a couple of days after my mother's passing.  He did not know that she had died.  He took the time to respond with a very personal email that touched the hearts of my entire family.  After I emailed him back to let him know that mom had died, he once again responded to say how sorry he was. Not many top performers would have taken the time to do that but Sebastian did.  A stellar comdedian and a true gentlemen who we consider a part of our family.Another Update:  I just saw Sebastian's show at Mohegan Sun Casino in CT last Saturday night 3-30-13 with my fiancee and sisters and their husbands.  He was truly awesome!  He was scheduled for just one show but because they were getting so many requests for tickets, they added another show that night.  I would say that 90% of his material was new and the rest that we heard before from his ""What's Wrong With People"" dvd.  But that was fine with us because he is really THAT funny.  We've heard some of his old material a countless number of times and it never gets old.  After our show, he made himself available to have photos taken with him and to sign autographs.  I bought (another) one of his dvds and had him autograph that.  He remembered who I was from my email regarding my mother and he could not have been more gracious and friendly.  He is getting married this August which he announced during the show and his fiancee was doing the picture taking and collecting money from the dvd sales.  She was very nice also!  Don't ever hesitiate to see Sebastian if he is touring in your area and it goes without saying to buy his dvd.  I am confident saying that Sebastian is headed for greater things as a comedian. I could easily see him starring in his own sitcom along the likes of ""Seinfeld"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", and ""King of Queens"".  He is a comedian not to be missed either in person or from watching his dvd.",5,Thank You Sebastian!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,4278,"['Three', 'months', 'purchased', 'Sebastian', 'Maniscalco', 'dvd', '87', 'old', 'mother', 'was', 'looking', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'act', 'lines', 'Pat', 'Cooper', 'who', 'mother', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'Sebastian', 'Maniscalco', 'saw', 'dvd', 'Amazon', 'hard', 'find', 'good', 'standup', 'comedy', 'days', 'are', 'PG', 'even', 'PG-13', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'i.e', 'clean', 'older', 'audiences', 'reading', 'reviews', '10', 'figured', 'would', 'least', 'give', 'Sebastian', 'What', 'Wrong', 'People', 'try.Three', 'months', 'when', 'mom', 'sisters', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'Sebastian', 'dvd', 'mom', 'was', 'working', 'driving', 'continuing', 'lead', 'active', 'productive', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'time', '3', 'children', 'several', 'grandchildren', 'great', 'grandchildren', 'also', 'loved', 'old', 'movies', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'acts', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'Sebastian', 'What', 'Wrong', 'People', 'must', 'have', 'watched', 'literally', 'hundred', 'times', 'would', 'laugh', 'hysterically', 'time', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'My', 'entire', 'family', 'would', 'watch', 'seeing', 'joy', 'brought', 'mom', 'was', 'also', 'huge', 'hit', 'probably', 'can', 'recite', 'most', 'performance', 'verbatim.Sebastian', 'dvd', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'medicine', 'mom', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'was', 'soon', 'diagnosed', 'cancer', 'three', 'days', 'took', 'life', 'was', 'quoting', 'lines', 'Sebastian', 'dvd', 'right', 'up', 'time', 'was', 'unable', 'speak', 'Sebastian', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'dvd', 'meant', 'joy', 'brought', 'mother', 'final', 'days', 'have', 'emailed', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'joy', 'brought', 'family', 'seeing', 'mom', 'so', 'happy', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'just', 'one', 'thousands', 'emails', 'understandable', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'back', 'yet', 'just', 'hope', 'one', 'day', 'ours', 'just', 'so', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'part', 'family.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'review', 'What', 'Wrong', 'People', 'dvd', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'people', 'reviews', 'words', 'advice', 'are', 'just', 'are', 'lucky', 'enough', 'still', 'have', 'parents', 'grandparents', 'life', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'sit', 'down', 'hold', 'hand', 'tell', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'watch', 'Sebastian', 'What', 'Wrong', 'People', 'together', ""'m"", 'so', 'grateful', 'family', 'had', 'opportunity', 'do', 'mother.Update', 'Sebastian', 'returned', 'email', 'just', 'couple', 'days', 'mother', 'passing', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'died', 'took', 'time', 'respond', 'very', 'personal', 'email', 'touched', 'hearts', 'entire', 'family', 'emailed', 'back', 'let', 'know', 'mom', 'had', 'died', 'once', 'again', 'responded', 'say', 'how', 'sorry', 'was', 'Not', 'many', 'top', 'performers', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'time', 'do', 'Sebastian', 'did', 'stellar', 'comdedian', 'true', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'consider', 'part', 'family.Another', 'Update', 'just', 'saw', 'Sebastian', 'show', 'Mohegan', 'Sun', 'Casino', 'CT', 'last', 'Saturday', 'night', '3-30-13', 'fiancee', 'sisters', 'husbands', 'was', 'truly', 'awesome', 'was', 'scheduled', 'just', 'one', 'show', 'were', 'getting', 'so', 'many', 'requests', 'tickets', 'added', 'show', 'night', 'would', 'say', '90', '%', 'material', 'was', 'new', 'rest', 'heard', 'What', 'Wrong', 'People', 'dvd', 'was', 'fine', 'really', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'old', 'material', 'countless', 'number', 'times', 'never', 'old', 'show', 'made', 'available', 'have', 'photos', 'taken', 'sign', 'autographs', 'bought', 'one', 'dvds', 'had', 'autograph', 'remembered', 'who', 'was', 'email', 'regarding', 'mother', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'gracious', 'friendly', 'getting', 'married', 'August', 'announced', 'show', 'fiancee', 'was', 'doing', 'picture', 'taking', 'collecting', 'money', 'dvd', 'sales', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'also', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'hesitiate', 'see', 'Sebastian', 'touring', 'area', 'saying', 'buy', 'dvd', 'am', 'confident', 'saying', 'Sebastian', 'headed', 'greater', 'things', 'comedian', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'starring', 'own', 'sitcom', 'likes', 'Seinfeld', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'King', 'Queens', 'comedian', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'either', 'person', 'watching', 'dvd']",Sebastian Maniscalco - What's Wrong with People?
