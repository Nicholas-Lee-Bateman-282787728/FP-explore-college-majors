1278874,A2FJCITRT7GQ0N,B002N5KDZM,D.R.L.,"[3, 3]","~ If you are familiar with Anita O'Day's audio recordings, but have not seen her perform there are a few options:Anita O'Day - Live at Ronnie Scott'sfrom 1986,Live in Tokyo '63, this DVD, her stupendous performance onJazz on a Summer's Dayfrom 1958, and the second DVD in the biographicalAnita O'Day - The Life Of A Jazz Singer, which collects selected performances from these DVDs and other TV shows and movies.  Perhaps the place to start is with Bert Stern'sJazz on a Summer's Daybecause the stellar performance by Anita is so perfectly matched by her band, and because her stunning visual appearance is so well captured by Stern's artistic eye.~ The 53 minute DVD currently under review originates from to TV shows in which Anita fronts a piano-bass-trio and performs in front a small intimate audience.  During the mid-1960's through the mid-1970's, when American audiences and concert promoters shunned jazz, especially jazz singers, many jazz artists made their living in Japan and Europe where audiences appreciated the art form known as jazz.  For the two shows recorded for this DVD, Anita used pick-up bands, as she did on most gigs during this period.  The only familiar face in the band was on the 1963 show: her long-time drummer, road manager, and drug procurer John Poole.  Poole is a master of the brushes and a master of anticipating and reading Anita's rapid shifts in tempo and rhythm.~ The band for the 1 November 1963 show in Sweden is Goran Engdahl (p), Roman Dylag (b), and John Poole (d).  They perform Sweet Georgia Brown, Let's Fall In Love, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square, Fly Me to the Moon, Honeysuckle Rose, On Green Dolphin Street, and Tea for Two.~ The band for the 21 October 1970 show in Norway is a French group consisting of George Arvanitas (p), Jacky Samson (b), and Charles Saudrais (d).  They perform Let's Fall in Love, Yesterday/Yesterdays, Four Brothers, I Can't Get Started, Sweet Georgia Brown, and Tea For Two.~ Do not be put off by the fact that two tunes appear in both concerts.  Indeed, comparison of the performances from one concert to the other clearly show what a great improvisor and bandleader Anita O'Day was.  In fact, one of the must stunning thing about this entire DVD is watching Anita O'Day the bandleader directing the trio - indicating who will solo when and for how long.  The other stunning thing about the DVD is watching how Anita the musician improvises and interacts with her fellow musicians - who obviously hold Anita in the highest regard.  Watch Anita exchanges fours with her pianist or bass player or drummer.  You just do not get this dynamic exchange out of studio recordings.~ The 1963 concert is perhaps a little more loose and joyous, and Anita is a little more adventurous in her improvisations.  Not sure if this is due to the presence of John Poole on drums or the quality of the other two musicians or the fact that in 1963 Anita was in the depths (or is it the height) of her heroin addiction (which was not the case in 1970).~ When I listen to Anita O'Day I try to ignore the words and listen to her voice as a tenor sax or trumpet.  By doing so it helps remind me that she was much more than a singer - she was a musician - she was a fantastic improvising musician with excellent tone control.~ Highly recommended DVD.",5,Anita O'Day: Musician and Band Leader,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,3315,"['~', 'are', 'familiar', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'audio', 'recordings', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'perform', 'are', 'few', 'options', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'Live', 'Ronnie', ""Scott'sfrom"", '1986', 'Live', 'Tokyo', ""'63"", 'DVD', 'stupendous', 'performance', 'onJazz', 'Summer', 'Dayfrom', '1958', 'second', 'DVD', 'biographicalAnita', ""O'Day"", 'Life', 'A', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'selected', 'performances', 'DVDs', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'Perhaps', 'place', 'start', 'Bert', ""Stern'sJazz"", 'Summer', 'Daybecause', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Anita', 'so', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'band', 'stunning', 'visual', 'appearance', 'so', 'well', 'captured', 'Stern', 'artistic', 'eye.~', '53', 'minute', 'DVD', 'currently', 'review', 'originates', 'TV', 'shows', 'Anita', 'piano-bass-trio', 'performs', 'front', 'small', 'intimate', 'audience', 'mid-1960', 'mid-1970', 'when', 'American', 'audiences', 'concert', 'promoters', 'shunned', 'jazz', 'especially', 'jazz', 'singers', 'many', 'jazz', 'artists', 'made', 'living', 'Japan', 'Europe', 'where', 'audiences', 'appreciated', 'art', 'form', 'known', 'jazz', 'two', 'shows', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'Anita', 'used', 'pick-up', 'bands', 'did', 'most', 'gigs', 'period', 'only', 'familiar', 'face', 'band', 'was', '1963', 'show', 'long-time', 'drummer', 'road', 'manager', 'drug', 'procurer', 'John', 'Poole', 'Poole', 'master', 'brushes', 'master', 'anticipating', 'reading', 'Anita', 'rapid', 'shifts', 'tempo', 'rhythm.~', 'band', '1', 'November', '1963', 'show', 'Sweden', 'Goran', 'Engdahl', 'p', 'Roman', 'Dylag', 'b', 'John', 'Poole', 'd', 'perform', 'Sweet', 'Georgia', 'Brown', 'Let', 'Fall', 'Love', 'A', 'Nightingale', 'Sang', 'Berkeley', 'Square', 'Fly', 'Me', 'Moon', 'Honeysuckle', 'Rose', 'Green', 'Dolphin', 'Street', 'Tea', 'Two.~', 'band', '21', 'October', '1970', 'show', 'Norway', 'French', 'group', 'consisting', 'George', 'Arvanitas', 'p', 'Jacky', 'Samson', 'b', 'Charles', 'Saudrais', 'd', 'perform', 'Let', 'Fall', 'Love', 'Yesterday/Yesterdays', 'Four', 'Brothers', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Get', 'Started', 'Sweet', 'Georgia', 'Brown', 'Tea', 'Two.~', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'fact', 'two', 'tunes', 'appear', 'concerts', 'Indeed', 'comparison', 'performances', 'one', 'concert', 'other', 'clearly', 'show', 'what', 'great', 'improvisor', 'bandleader', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'was', 'fact', 'one', 'must', 'stunning', 'thing', 'entire', 'DVD', 'watching', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'bandleader', 'directing', 'trio', 'indicating', 'who', 'will', 'solo', 'when', 'how', 'long', 'other', 'stunning', 'thing', 'DVD', 'watching', 'how', 'Anita', 'musician', 'improvises', 'interacts', 'fellow', 'musicians', 'who', 'obviously', 'hold', 'Anita', 'highest', 'regard', 'Watch', 'Anita', 'exchanges', 'fours', 'pianist', 'bass', 'player', 'drummer', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'dynamic', 'exchange', 'studio', 'recordings.~', '1963', 'concert', 'perhaps', 'little', 'more', 'loose', 'joyous', 'Anita', 'little', 'more', 'adventurous', 'improvisations', 'Not', 'sure', 'due', 'presence', 'John', 'Poole', 'drums', 'quality', 'other', 'two', 'musicians', 'fact', '1963', 'Anita', 'was', 'depths', 'height', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'was', 'not', 'case', '1970', '.~', 'When', 'listen', 'Anita', ""O'Day"", 'try', 'ignore', 'words', 'listen', 'voice', 'tenor', 'sax', 'trumpet', 'doing', 'remind', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'singer', 'was', 'musician', 'was', 'fantastic', 'improvising', 'musician', 'excellent', 'tone', 'control.~', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'DVD']",N/A

1278876,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B002N5KDZM,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[3, 3]","The two concerts on this hour-long DVD are separated by seven years, but Anita's stage presence and singing are superb on both. And despite the seven years of abuse she heaped upon herself with drugs and fast-paced lifestyle, she was still full of energy and turned in an amazing performance on the second half of this DVD that was filmed in Norway.About the concerts:The first part of the DVD was filmed in Stockholm, Sweden on June 25, 1963, She is accompanied by Swedish pianist G&ouml;ran Engdahl (who also took the photo that graces the cover of the DVD case), Polish bassist Roman Dylag, and her partner-in-crime and favorite drummer, John Poole.Her performance is dazzling. She takes total charge of the stage, musicians and audience and blasts through her setlist without missing a beat or a false note. As a drummer I greatly appreciated seeing shots of John Poole, who is one of my drum idols. The songs were: Sweet Georgia Brown, Let's Fall In Love, A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square, Fly Me To The Moon, Honeysuckle Rose, On Green Dolphin Street and Tea For Two.Anita's rendition of ""A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square"" is ample evidence that she was as adept at singing a ballad as she was on the fast tempo pieces for which she is well known.On the second part of the DVD, filmed in Oslo, Norway on October 21, 1970, she was accompanied by George Arvanitas on piano, Jacky Samson on bass and Charles Saudrais on drums.Her setlist was shorter for this performance, consisting of Let's Fall In Love, Yesterday/Yesterdays, Four Brothers, I Can't Get Started, and, of course, Sweet Georgia Brown and Tea For Two that were staples of her act.She was as energetic as she was in the first performance, and, if anything, perhaps delivered her vocals even better than she did seven years earlier! That's a judgement call.  She did deviate from her tried and true standards with a medley of the Beatles' Yesterday with Yesterdays - and managed to pull it off. The only missing ingredient in this performance is John Poole, her drummer for decades.Overall, this is an essential set of performances for Anita O'Day fans, and my favorite of all of her videos that I own (which includesLive in Tokyo '63andAnita O'Day: Live at Ronnie Scott's.)",5,Anita in action!

So heads-up, it's time to learn from a maestro.In this fantastic DVD O'Day is virtually a one-woman band with her precision timing, saxophonic phrasing, crowd charming, and fiesty asides. She's backed by solid bands but she's clearly the engine driving this express. We're lucky to see two concerts here bookending the 60's which act as a master class in first class vocalese. Anita had the complex rhythmic sense of Gene Krupa and the liquid instincts of John Coltrane, all while she was singing a melodic tune. In a male field, she held her own with her whipsmart musicianship and earned deep respect from her legendary peers. Watch how she turns ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" into a bop opera.
