Fox""","[5, 6]","Maybe you've seen ""Beach Party,"" or ""Beach Blanket Bingo,"" but I'll bet you've never seen an East German beach party musical -so welcome to Heisser Sommer!  DEFA (the East German Communist government-controlled film company) did not make many musicals.  Indeed, given the chronic shortages in East Germany  (often filmmaking would have to stop when the electricity went off), and the limited ability of filmmakers, actors and the like to interact with their western counterparts, it is remarkable that this film is as good as it is. It is easily as good as any American movie of this genre, and you'll find yourself humming the tunes long after the movie is over.The plot is simplistic: a group of ten teenage boys and a separate group of eleven teenage girls make their way to the Baltic Sea for a vacation.  After they arrive, each group engages collectively in sophomoric hi-jinks (e.g., the boys hide the girls' clothes while the girls are swimming; the girls send the boys to a barn ""guarded"" by a St. Bernard) and one girl plays two boys off against each other.  While the dancing, by Western standards, is a bit amateurish, the songs are catchy, the singing is good and the film is fast-paced and energetic.When watching the movie, though, you will never forget that it's in East Germany.  For openers, the female lead does not look like a typical 1960s-era American leading lady.  The movie offers a rare glimpse of 1960s East Germany (Leipzig, in the opening; East Berlin, in a dream sequence.)  Some of the translations, while accurate, are unintentionally funny.  As others have mentioned, communist mores, while incidental to the plot, occasionally come through.  Example:  when one guy wants to leave early, he is told that ""only cowards leave.""  This echoes the view held by the East German government that those who went West were cowards, who did not want to participate in building the ""workers' paradise.""  The movie makes it appear as if groups of kids could take off for vacations almost on a whim -- as the commentary on the film explains, vacations in East Germany involved a lot of advance planning.The movie is a lot of fun.  If you enjoy it, you'll also like ""East Side Story,"" which is a tongue-in-cheek history of musicals made behind the Iron Curtain.",4,One Of A Kind -- Great Fun,1104969600,"01 6, 2005",2005,2279,"['Maybe', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Beach', 'Party', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', ""'ll"", 'bet', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'East', 'German', 'beach', 'party', 'musical', '-so', 'welcome', 'Heisser', 'Sommer', 'DEFA', 'East', 'German', 'Communist', 'government-controlled', 'film', 'company', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'many', 'musicals', 'Indeed', 'given', 'chronic', 'shortages', 'East', 'Germany', 'often', 'filmmaking', 'would', 'have', 'stop', 'when', 'electricity', 'went', 'off', 'limited', 'ability', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'like', 'interact', 'western', 'counterparts', 'remarkable', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'easily', 'as', 'good', 'American', 'movie', 'genre', ""'ll"", 'find', 'humming', 'tunes', 'long', 'movie', 'over.The', 'plot', 'simplistic', 'group', 'ten', 'teenage', 'boys', 'separate', 'group', 'eleven', 'teenage', 'girls', 'make', 'way', 'Baltic', 'Sea', 'vacation', 'arrive', 'group', 'collectively', 'sophomoric', 'hi-jinks', 'e.g.', 'boys', 'hide', 'girls', 'clothes', 'girls', 'are', 'swimming', 'girls', 'send', 'boys', 'barn', 'guarded', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'one', 'girl', 'two', 'boys', 'other', 'dancing', 'Western', 'standards', 'bit', 'amateurish', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'singing', 'good', 'film', 'fast-paced', 'energetic.When', 'watching', 'movie', 'though', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'East', 'Germany', 'openers', 'female', 'lead', 'not', 'look', 'typical', '1960s-era', 'American', 'leading', 'lady', 'movie', 'rare', 'glimpse', '1960s', 'East', 'Germany', 'Leipzig', 'opening', 'East', 'Berlin', 'dream', 'sequence', 'translations', 'accurate', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'communist', 'mores', 'incidental', 'plot', 'occasionally', 'come', 'Example', 'when', 'one', 'guy', 'leave', 'early', 'told', 'only', 'cowards', 'leave', 'view', 'held', 'East', 'German', 'government', 'who', 'went', 'West', 'were', 'cowards', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'participate', 'building', 'workers', 'paradise', 'movie', 'appear', 'groups', 'kids', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'vacations', 'almost', 'whim', 'commentary', 'film', 'vacations', 'East', 'Germany', 'involved', 'lot', 'advance', 'planning.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'enjoy', ""'ll"", 'also', 'East', 'Side', 'Story', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'history', 'musicals', 'made', 'Iron', 'Curtain']",N/A
665900,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00005MKNY,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 5]","Who would have thought a beach party movie from the Red Menace of East Germany would be more wholesome than any of the American competition?  A big group of young men and a big group of young women bump into each other while hitchhiking to the Baltic coast for summer vacation, and play increasingly juvenile pranks on one another.  They sing songs (""Heisse Sommer"" will burn its way into your brain whether you speak German or not), dance with awful awkwardness to choreography that is based almost entirely on marching, and maintain solemn chastity while building socialism.  At the end, the movie just kind of peters out.  It's still a fascinating glimpse into Soviet-era Eastern Europe.In one of the bonus materials, a short essay explains that this movie was really popular among the youth when it was released, and the kids would go see this repeatedly.

If you've seen the documentary about communist bloc musicals, &quot;East Side Story,&quot; you know that because of the communist system DEFA made very few musical comedies, so it's amazing that this film is as good and polished as it is. The director was talented and several of the actor/singers are very charismatic and likely would have done well in the West. In some ways the characters were more mature than their counterparts in Hollywood beach movies. For example, one character discusses the possibility of pregnancy.Still, this is a fun film.

The weirdness just increases every time you see Chris Doerk speak or sing, she's cute, but she has this weird creepy intensity that probably went over really, really well in East Germany. You can learn valuable truths about human nature from this movie, such as how East German women treated their men (""treat them mean, keep them keen""), and dig those East German fashions!. As you watch this movie every musical number just gets better and better,  you just keep wondering ""how can they top the last"". And of course there are the situations, which are so stupid as to boggle the mind. For one prank the boys decide to frighten all of the girls by putting a mouse in their collective hotel room (man thiis movie is huge on collectivism, no one does anything by themselves in this movie, whether or not this is deliberately subtextual I don't know, but it smacks you upside the head like a Stasi nightstick*) while the girls get back at the boys by luring them into a barn guarded by a Saint Bernard (I'm not making this up, and watching these candy-assed East Germans nancy-jungen get cornered by a friggin Saint Bernard makes you wonder why we ever worried about these pussies coming through the Fulda Gap).Then there's the weirdness of German pop song titles the song ""Everything that we do, we do only for you"" translates as ""Alles was wir tun das tun wir nur fur euch"", which just doesn't work as well as the English title (you can see this with the Christmas Carol ""Silent Night"", which was originally written in German and titled ""Stille Nacht"".). The songs, and the German romantic endearments such as ""Kuss Mich mal"" really hammer home the point that German is not the language of love.As for the ""dance"" numbers, well, I'd have to say that there's nothing like German communism to crush whatever vestigial sense of rhythm possessed by white folks. And that dancing haystack number, wow! Watching this movie leaves you with certain questions: ""Would this film have been any different if it had been made by a Nazi regime that won World War II""?, ""Aren't we lucky that the Beatles got the Hell out of Hamburg and stopped singing in German?"", ""Was East German pornography into orgies and group sex as an expression of collectivism?""
