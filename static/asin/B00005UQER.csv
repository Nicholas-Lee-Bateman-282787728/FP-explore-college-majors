685822,A351XMJF8DCD8Z,B00005UQER,"bart ""wwfrockfan""","[5, 5]","Hounded is one of Disney Channel's funniest original movies.  It stars Tahj Mowry (from tv show &quot;Smat guy&quot; and voice of Wade from &quot;Kim Possible&quot;) as Jay Marshall, a 13 year old who is very talented in art and has the perfect speech for a contest to win  a scholarship for Peterson Academy.  Jay must win or he'll end up in Military school where his late father had worked and where is older brother , Mike (Craig Kirkwood)who's dream is to be in the army, is attending.  But Jay's dreams are crushed when a fellow rival, Ronny Van Dusen(Shia Lebouf from &quot;Even Stevens&quot;) manages to get his hands on the speech.  Jay goes to his principal (Ed Begly jr) and he immediately finds out Ronny took his speech but doesn't do anything because the principal just happens to be Ward Van Dusen: the father of  Ronny Van Dusen who lets his son get away with possibly anything.  Now there is nothing Jay can do or is there?  Jay attemtps to retrieve his stolen (and used) speech so it can be evidence to show the judges at the contest.  But it seems that Jay has more problems then just having his speech stolen.  The van dusen's dog just happened to be around and follows Jay home.  At first the dog seems like a typical dog but there is something about it Jay doesn't know- it needs some type of special medication or it goes insane.  The parts where jay gets chased around by the dog all over is house is hillarious.  So much choas and havoc happens and there nothing jay can do about it(believe me, if you were in his position, there would be nothing you could about to.) Jay is just lucky is mom is away but his olderbrother Mike is coming home.  Mike too is a person who can't even control the dog.  Jay tells Mike that the dog is here because the van dusens let him take care of it for the day just to avoid telling the truth.  Speaking of the Van Dusens, they think the dog is kidnapped or should I say dognapped.  Ward is actually happy the dog is gone.  So happy that when jay called him and disguised his voice and telling him he was gonna bring the dog back, Ward threaened to arrest him if he brought it back, but of course he didn't he was talking to Jay.Overall I think Hounded is a very funny movie for all kids.  When I saw it for the first time when it premiered back in April 2001, I was luaghing a lot.  Hounded is not just about getting chased by a crazy dog but it also shows two different brothers finally getting along and in the end what happens when you take something that is not yours.  Hounded is one of the perfect movies to watch so buy it.",5,My favorite disney channel original movie,1030838400,"09 1, 2002",2002,2587,"['Hounded', 'one', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'funniest', 'original', 'movies', 'Tahj', 'Mowry', 'tv', 'show', 'quot', 'Smat', 'guy', 'quot', 'voice', 'Wade', 'quot', 'Kim', 'Possible', 'quot', 'Jay', 'Marshall', '13', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'very', 'talented', 'art', 'perfect', 'speech', 'contest', 'win', 'scholarship', 'Peterson', 'Academy', 'Jay', 'must', 'win', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'Military', 'school', 'where', 'late', 'father', 'had', 'worked', 'where', 'older', 'brother', 'Mike', 'Craig', 'Kirkwood', 'who', 'dream', 'be', 'army', 'attending', 'Jay', 'dreams', 'are', 'crushed', 'when', 'fellow', 'rival', 'Ronny', 'Van', 'Dusen', 'Shia', 'Lebouf', 'quot', 'Even', 'Stevens', 'quot', 'get', 'hands', 'speech', 'Jay', 'principal', 'Ed', 'Begly', 'jr', 'immediately', 'out', 'Ronny', 'took', 'speech', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'principal', 'just', 'be', 'Ward', 'Van', 'Dusen', 'father', 'Ronny', 'Van', 'Dusen', 'who', 'son', 'get', 'away', 'possibly', 'anything', 'Now', 'nothing', 'Jay', 'can', 'do', 'there', 'Jay', 'attemtps', 'retrieve', 'stolen', 'used', 'speech', 'can', 'be', 'evidence', 'show', 'judges', 'contest', 'Jay', 'more', 'problems', 'then', 'just', 'having', 'speech', 'stolen', 'van', 'dusen', 'dog', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'around', 'Jay', 'home', 'first', 'dog', 'typical', 'dog', 'something', 'Jay', ""n't"", 'know-', 'type', 'special', 'medication', 'insane', 'parts', 'where', 'jay', 'chased', 'dog', 'house', 'hillarious', 'So', 'much', 'choas', 'havoc', 'happens', 'nothing', 'jay', 'can', 'do', 'believe', 'were', 'position', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'could', 'about', 'Jay', 'just', 'lucky', 'mom', 'away', 'olderbrother', 'Mike', 'coming', 'home', 'Mike', 'too', 'person', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'control', 'dog', 'Jay', 'Mike', 'dog', 'here', 'van', 'let', 'take', 'care', 'day', 'just', 'avoid', 'telling', 'truth', 'Speaking', 'Van', 'Dusens', 'think', 'dog', 'kidnapped', 'should', 'say', 'dognapped', 'Ward', 'actually', 'happy', 'dog', 'gone', 'So', 'happy', 'when', 'jay', 'called', 'disguised', 'voice', 'telling', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'bring', 'dog', 'back', 'Ward', 'threaened', 'arrest', 'brought', 'back', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'talking', 'Jay.Overall', 'think', 'Hounded', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'kids', 'When', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'premiered', 'back', 'April', '2001', 'was', 'luaghing', 'lot', 'Hounded', 'not', 'just', 'getting', 'chased', 'crazy', 'dog', 'also', 'two', 'different', 'brothers', 'finally', 'getting', 'along', 'end', 'what', 'when', 'take', 'something', 'not', 'yours', 'Hounded', 'one', 'perfect', 'movies', 'watch', 'so', 'buy']",N/A

Shia Labeouf came off the disney channel and you can tell how he got so big! Great family friendly movie, good acting and very funny. But it also has it's serious moments. One great thing about it is the humor isn't cheesy. Back when we had tv, I used to hate the disney channel shows. The humor was so lame, obviously geared towards a younger audience. But this movie is everyone's favorite, even my dad's!I really hope someone sees the wisdom is putting this film on DVD. We only recently got a used VHS player so we could finally watched ""Hounded"" after several years of not!And the special effects aren't the greatest when the dog goes nuts.

The scenes where the dog is having one of his ""spells,"" just absolutely kills me and my family... we laugh and laugh and laugh!
