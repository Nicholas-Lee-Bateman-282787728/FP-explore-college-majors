872113,ALOYRM215JP45,B0006Q93L0,"GhostFrappe ""Nerd of all trades""","[1, 3]","There's nothing I can say about the film's screwed-up history that could be said better than what has already been put here, so I want to just review the film I ordered. Overall, I did like it - interesting characters, alright story, and holy crap that chase scene between Tack and the thief was so cool. However, someone at Miramax deserves to have a steamroller drive over their genitals for some of the crap that went wrong with this film. And I am going to point those things out (warning, there will be spoilers).1. Tack. Tack is absolutely adorable - this cute, shy little cobbler. He's also white as a sheet...how someone in a Middle Eastern country manages to be that white is a mystery all in itself, but maybe he's an albino. Who knows. My problem is with the fact that about halfway through the movie, his skin goes from white to a normal flesh tone and then to brown by the end of the film. And I've no issue against any skin color, but Tack honey, you are a freaking racial chameleon. Very sloppy animation work and a total lack of attention to detail to allow this to happen not once, but twice. Also, even if I had not familiarized myself with the movie's history, it's painfully obvious that Tack was meant to be a character of few words and that someone had the bright idea to give him a bunch of unnecessary lines, some of which involve him being the narrator.2. The voices. Aside from Tack having words put in his mouth, someone also seemed to think it'd be a great idea to do this to more characters. The thief never actually opens his mouth and speaks, which means he's meant to be a silent character. Nope, Miramax decided he would communicate with us via telepathy, or as they put it, ""he's a man of few words, but many thoughts."" And the stupid jokes were unnecessary - the thief's actions spoke well enough for themselves that he did not need a voice. And why did the bird need a voice? He said nothing of importance and it's clear he was not meant to talk.3. Animation quality. The film is like an animated quilt with random, differently designed patches spread everywhere. There's obvious vintage-looking segments, some gorgeously animated scenes, and then the half-baked crap that looks like it's from a 90s cartoon. Could they have tried a little tiny bit harder to make the animation look better? It's bad enough I have to be aurally assaulted by Matthew Broderick's voice, but some of the animation was just blah.4. The fight scene. You hear for so long in the film about the enemy, One-Eye. OMG One-Eye is coming, One-Eye is coming, we're all gonna die and the country will explode and rain of blood and acid will fall up into the sky, hell itself will open up and billions of tortured souls will pour out and eat what remains of the earth and then the planet will explode. Okay, they don't actually say all that, but my point is everyone freaks out over this immensely-powerful enemy and then the entire army is defeated in like a minute. I can get over how the army is defeated by Tack launching one of his tacks - it's ridiculous, but I can deal with it. I would have liked to see more actual battling first, like maybe Tack gets his arse whooped a bit before he realizes what can bring the enemy down. And I would have liked to see the enemy storm the palace, or see more of that gigantic monster-machine they brought with them. It was just so pitifully short and I think if it lasted a little longer, it could have been a really epic battle scene.Despite all that, though, I still liked the film. Obviously I think if it had been completed while adhering more to the original creator's vision, it would have been astounding. It's as if someone took a bunch of puzzles, mixed up all the pieces in a big pile, and Miramax took things that obviously did not fit and forced them into the picture so that nothing matched by the time it was finished. Would I watch it again? Honestly, yes. I don't want to judge the film solely on what it could have been and what was done well in this film is worth watching.",3,"Screw you, Miramax",1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,4040,"['nothing', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'screwed-up', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'better', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'put', 'here', 'want', 'just', 'review', 'film', 'ordered', 'Overall', 'did', 'interesting', 'characters', 'alright', 'story', 'holy', 'crap', 'scene', 'Tack', 'thief', 'was', 'so', 'cool', 'However', 'someone', 'Miramax', 'deserves', 'have', 'steamroller', 'drive', 'genitals', 'crap', 'went', 'wrong', 'film', 'am', 'going', 'point', 'things', 'out', 'warning', 'will', 'be', 'spoilers', '.1', 'Tack', 'Tack', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'cute', 'shy', 'little', 'cobbler', 'also', 'white', 'sheet', 'how', 'someone', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'country', 'be', 'white', 'mystery', 'maybe', 'albino', 'Who', 'problem', 'fact', 'halfway', 'movie', 'skin', 'white', 'normal', 'flesh', 'tone', 'then', 'brown', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'issue', 'skin', 'color', 'Tack', 'honey', 'are', 'freaking', 'racial', 'chameleon', 'Very', 'sloppy', 'animation', 'work', 'total', 'lack', 'attention', 'detail', 'allow', 'happen', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'Also', 'even', 'had', 'not', 'familiarized', 'movie', 'history', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'Tack', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'character', 'few', 'words', 'someone', 'had', 'bright', 'idea', 'give', 'bunch', 'unnecessary', 'lines', 'involve', 'being', 'narrator.2', 'voices', 'Aside', 'Tack', 'having', 'words', 'put', 'mouth', 'someone', 'also', 'seemed', 'think', ""'d"", 'be', 'great', 'idea', 'do', 'more', 'characters', 'thief', 'never', 'actually', 'mouth', 'speaks', 'meant', 'be', 'silent', 'character', 'Nope', 'Miramax', 'decided', 'would', 'communicate', 'telepathy', 'put', 'man', 'few', 'words', 'many', 'thoughts', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'thief', 'actions', 'spoke', 'well', 'enough', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'voice', 'why', 'did', 'bird', 'need', 'voice', 'said', 'nothing', 'importance', 'clear', 'was', 'not', 'meant', 'talk.3', 'Animation', 'quality', 'film', 'animated', 'quilt', 'random', 'differently', 'designed', 'patches', 'spread', 'everywhere', 'obvious', 'vintage-looking', 'segments', 'gorgeously', 'animated', 'scenes', 'then', 'half-baked', 'crap', '90s', 'cartoon', 'Could', 'have', 'tried', 'little', 'tiny', 'bit', 'harder', 'make', 'animation', 'look', 'better', 'bad', 'enough', 'have', 'be', 'aurally', 'assaulted', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'voice', 'animation', 'was', 'just', 'blah.4', 'fight', 'scene', 'hear', 'so', 'long', 'film', 'enemy', 'One-Eye', 'OMG', 'One-Eye', 'coming', 'One-Eye', 'coming', ""'re"", 'gon', 'die', 'country', 'will', 'explode', 'rain', 'blood', 'acid', 'will', 'fall', 'up', 'sky', 'hell', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'billions', 'tortured', 'souls', 'will', 'pour', 'out', 'eat', 'what', 'earth', 'then', 'planet', 'will', 'explode', 'Okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'say', 'point', 'everyone', 'freaks', 'out', 'immensely-powerful', 'enemy', 'then', 'entire', 'army', 'defeated', 'minute', 'can', 'get', 'how', 'army', 'defeated', 'Tack', 'launching', 'one', 'tacks', 'ridiculous', 'can', 'deal', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'actual', 'battling', 'first', 'maybe', 'Tack', 'arse', 'whooped', 'bit', 'what', 'can', 'bring', 'enemy', 'down', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'enemy', 'storm', 'palace', 'see', 'more', 'gigantic', 'monster-machine', 'brought', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'pitifully', 'short', 'think', 'lasted', 'little', 'longer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'epic', 'battle', 'scene.Despite', 'still', 'liked', 'film', 'Obviously', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'completed', 'adhering', 'more', 'original', 'creator', 'vision', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'astounding', 'someone', 'took', 'bunch', 'puzzles', 'mixed', 'up', 'pieces', 'big', 'pile', 'Miramax', 'took', 'things', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'forced', 'picture', 'nothing', 'matched', 'time', 'was', 'finished', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'Honestly', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'judge', 'film', 'solely', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'well', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

872119,A26O0T192IBKY1,B0006Q93L0,J. Alford,"[0, 2]","Originally released in U.S. theatres as Arabian Night, and also known in other parts of the world as The Princess And The Cobbler, this movie was actually in production for nearly thirty years. First spearheaded in the 60s by Richard Williams who was the animation director for Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Raggedy Ann & Andy movie, The Thief And The Cobbler went from one production period to another. It was first going to be finally be released in the early 90s by Warner Bros., but that deal fell through when it wasn't done on time. So Williams did two versions of this, one in America as Arabian Night through Miramax, and as Princess And The Cobbler as another, each edit is supposed to be radically different from the other.Set during the time of the Arabian Nights, an army of evil warriors called the One-Eyes(because they all have one of their eyes poked out)is making their way to Bagdad which is also referred to as the Golden City. Living there is a simpler cobbler named Tack, who after encountering the unnamed Thief in his shop stumbles into the grand vizir, Zigzag(voiced by the late Vincent Price, which was his last movie role). Ziggy brings him to the king to be executed, but the luscious Princess Yum-Yum takes a serious shining to him, and saves him by claiming she needs a shoe repaired. Meanwhile, the Thief sneaks into the palace to try and steal three gold balls that are placed on top of a high tower which are prophecised to protect the city from evil. Tack runs into ZZ again and has him put in prision. Thief manages after several Wile E. Coyote-type attempts to finally get the balls, just as a messenger comes to inform the king of the oncoming One-Eyes invasion. When Zigzag's posse gets the balls for him after the Thief drops them, he uses this as a chance to have the king let him marry the princess. After being rejected, Zigster takes the balls to ally himself with the One-Eyes. Yum-Yum then goes with Tack on a quest to get advice from a reclusive witch who lives in the desert to find out how to stop the One-Eyes, al while being followed by the Thief. Along the way, they run across some melodic desert punks who were formally with the army, that Yummy adopts as her royal guard. They get to the witch who tells them to attack the One-Eyes when they come. Double-backing it to Bagdad, they arrive just as the One-Eyes unleash their gigantic war machine on the city. Tack realizes that the witch ment to use ""a tack"" though, and throws a tack at the soldiers which ricochets off several soldiers and eventually causes the war machine to fall apart, although the Thief's attempts to get the balls back from it help bring it down too. Tack is seen as a hero, marries Yum-Yum, and the Thief tries to make off with the closing credits.This film has some serious design clashes in it, but in a good way. It goes the way of generic Disney style, but is more heavily based on the United Productions of America animation who did Mr. Magoo. The main draw was the esthetic use of perspective involved in some of the shots to provide an almost 3-D effect when watching it. When Disney more or less took the film from Richard Williams when they released it through Miramax, they gave it a new edit and some new voice overs. They added Johnathon Winters as the Thief(in inner monologue only), and Matthew Broderick as Tack, even though in the original dub he was voiced by Sean Connery. After lots of ups & downs with Disney, Williams finally decided to release it as a non-profit bootleg titled The Recobbled Cut. It's visually a wonderful film, and worth owning anyone who can appreaciate a great animated legacy.",4,Aladdin ain't got nothin' on this!,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,3648,"['Originally', 'released', 'U.S.', 'theatres', 'Arabian', 'Night', 'also', 'known', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'Princess', 'Cobbler', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'production', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', 'First', 'spearheaded', '60s', 'Richard', 'Williams', 'who', 'was', 'animation', 'director', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Raggedy', 'Ann', 'Andy', 'movie', 'Thief', 'Cobbler', 'went', 'one', 'production', 'period', 'was', 'first', 'going', 'be', 'finally', 'be', 'released', 'early', '90s', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'deal', 'fell', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'time', 'So', 'Williams', 'did', 'two', 'versions', 'one', 'America', 'Arabian', 'Night', 'Miramax', 'Princess', 'Cobbler', 'edit', 'supposed', 'be', 'radically', 'different', 'other.Set', 'time', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'army', 'evil', 'warriors', 'called', 'One-Eyes', 'have', 'one', 'eyes', 'poked', 'out', 'making', 'way', 'Bagdad', 'also', 'referred', 'Golden', 'City', 'Living', 'simpler', 'cobbler', 'named', 'Tack', 'who', 'encountering', 'unnamed', 'Thief', 'shop', 'grand', 'vizir', 'Zigzag', 'voiced', 'late', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'was', 'last', 'movie', 'role', 'Ziggy', 'king', 'be', 'executed', 'luscious', 'Princess', 'Yum-Yum', 'serious', 'shining', 'claiming', 'shoe', 'repaired', 'Meanwhile', 'Thief', 'palace', 'try', 'steal', 'three', 'gold', 'balls', 'are', 'placed', 'top', 'high', 'tower', 'are', 'prophecised', 'protect', 'city', 'evil', 'Tack', 'ZZ', 'again', 'put', 'prision', 'Thief', 'manages', 'several', 'Wile', 'E.', 'Coyote-type', 'attempts', 'finally', 'get', 'balls', 'just', 'messenger', 'inform', 'king', 'oncoming', 'One-Eyes', 'invasion', 'When', 'Zigzag', 'posse', 'balls', 'Thief', 'chance', 'have', 'king', 'let', 'marry', 'princess', 'being', 'rejected', 'Zigster', 'balls', 'ally', 'One-Eyes', 'Yum-Yum', 'then', 'Tack', 'quest', 'get', 'advice', 'reclusive', 'witch', 'who', 'desert', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'stop', 'One-Eyes', 'al', 'being', 'followed', 'Thief', 'way', 'run', 'melodic', 'desert', 'punks', 'who', 'were', 'formally', 'army', 'Yummy', 'adopts', 'royal', 'guard', 'get', 'witch', 'who', 'attack', 'One-Eyes', 'when', 'come', 'Double-backing', 'Bagdad', 'arrive', 'just', 'One-Eyes', 'unleash', 'gigantic', 'war', 'machine', 'city', 'Tack', 'witch', 'ment', 'use', 'tack', 'tack', 'soldiers', 'several', 'soldiers', 'eventually', 'war', 'machine', 'fall', 'apart', 'Thief', 'attempts', 'get', 'balls', 'back', 'bring', 'down', 'too', 'Tack', 'seen', 'hero', 'marries', 'Yum-Yum', 'Thief', 'tries', 'make', 'off', 'closing', 'credits.This', 'film', 'serious', 'design', 'clashes', 'good', 'way', 'way', 'generic', 'Disney', 'style', 'more', 'heavily', 'based', 'United', 'Productions', 'America', 'animation', 'who', 'did', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'main', 'draw', 'was', 'esthetic', 'use', 'perspective', 'involved', 'shots', 'provide', 'almost', '3-D', 'effect', 'when', 'watching', 'When', 'Disney', 'more', 'less', 'took', 'film', 'Richard', 'Williams', 'when', 'released', 'Miramax', 'gave', 'new', 'edit', 'new', 'voice', 'overs', 'added', 'Johnathon', 'Winters', 'Thief', 'inner', 'monologue', 'only', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Tack', 'even', 'original', 'dub', 'was', 'voiced', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'lots', 'ups', 'downs', 'Disney', 'Williams', 'finally', 'decided', 'release', 'non-profit', 'bootleg', 'titled', 'Recobbled', 'Cut', 'visually', 'wonderful', 'film', 'worth', 'owning', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'appreaciate', 'great', 'animated', 'legacy']",N/A

Richard Williams' intricately animated film was butchered by the studio, and the two title characters, both intended to be largely mute roles, had nearly non-stop dialogue dubbed onto their every scene (Tack, the cobbler, actually becomes the narrator of the movie!).The plot of ""The Thief and the Cobbler"" -- an original story, not an adaptation of a traditional tale or literary work -- has sometimes been criticized as dull and unmemorable.  I agree with this assessment; Williams' statement during the film's production that it would be the first animated feature whose plot would tie together like a detective story at the end seems wildly off-base, and more applicable to ""The Lion King"" than ""The Thief and the Cobbler"".  Nonetheless, enough of Williams' achievement can be glimpsed in the released film to convince me that the plot would have served well enough as a vehicle for the fantastic animation had the film been completed as Williams intended.It is indeed to be hoped that an official restoration and rerelease of this film are soon undertaken.

Mccart ""pjmccart""","[111, 116]","NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES ONLY TO THE ORIGINAL RICHARD WILLIAMS WORKPRINT CUT, NOT THE VERSION ON DVD OR RELEASED INTO THEATERSIn possibly the worst seizures of a film in history, possibly the greatest animated film was reduced to a grotesque mess only with only hints of the original brilliance. Almost half of the film was deleted or never finished, wonderful vocal performances were re-dubbed, and extensive re-editing destroyed the lyrical narrative form.Before The Thief and the Cobbler was ripped to shreds, it was a pet project of animator/director Richard Williams (who you should know as the animation director... or really co-director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit). From 1964 to the late 1980s, every penny spent on the film was out of his own pocket or from small investments from benefactors. He produced hundreds of television commercials to pay for the movie. Alas, even after years of work, he had only about 10 minutes of footage at the cost of $2 million dollars.The Thief and the Cobbler started as an adaptation of stories about Mulla Nasrudin (by Idres Shah). When rights over the published work fell apart, he turned his project into an original, but familiar tale. The haunting opening narration (spoken by Shakespearian actor Sir Felix Almyer) began the film:""It is written among the limitless constellations of the celestial heavens and in the depths of the emerald seas and upon every grain of sand in the vast deserts that the world which we see is an outward and visible dream of an inward and invisible reality.Once upon a time there was a golden city. In the centre of the golden city atop the tallest minaret were three golden balls. The ancients had prophesied that if the three golden balls were ever taken away harmony would yield to discord and the city would fall to destruction and death.But... the mystics had also foretold that the city might be saved by the simplest soul with the smallest and simplest of things.In the city there dwelt a lowly shoemaker... who was known as Tack the Cobbler. Also in the city... existed a Thief... who shall be nameless.""Through a series of circumstances, the flea-bitten thief causes Tack to be mistaken as an attacker on the Grand Vizier Zig-Zag. After being brought to the palace to be executed, he falls in love with Princess Yum-Yum (daughter of the benevolent, but sleepy King Nod). Zig-Zag bribes and brownnoses King Nod, hoping to control the Golden City and take Yum-Yum as his own.Tack is a white-faced and silent - his demeanor and movement reminiscent of Chaplin's Tramp, Harry Langdon, and Jacques Tati's Hulot. The Thief is a scrawny, flea-bitten kleptomaniac mute. Zig-Zag, voiced by Vincent Price in a valedictorian performance, is blue-skinned and vulture-like in appearance.Princess Yum-Yum is voiced by Hilary Pritchard (bit player in many 1970's British TV shows), King Nod by Sir Anthony Quayle, Zig-Zag's vulture has squawks and hisses provided by Donald Pleasence. In a surprise, but appropriate cameo, Sir Sean Connery provides his voice.For animation, he recruited master animators from the golden age: Art Babbitt (Disney), Ken Harris (Warner Bros.), Myron ""Grim"" Natwick (Fleischers). He would also give shots to his commercial animators to work on as training (many of which went on to be acclaimed animators in their own right such as Eric Goldberg, Tom Sito, and his son Alex). Richard Williams, himself, animated much of the film himself - often keeping Zig-Zag's scenes to himself. The style of most of the characters is a blend of the rounded UPA look, but with the detail of Disney. Rare for most animated films, nearly all of the animation was drawn in ""ones"" which refers to one drawing = one frame.The film's plot is intricately subtle, requiring the utmost attention to detail to understand the characters. Being that the two main characters have no dialogue, emotions are conveyed masterfully through facial expressions and gestures. Sometimes, just one brief shot defines an entire character. The animation itself (in the original 70 minutes directed by Richard Williams) out-performs 3-D digital animation. Characters are drawn with such fluidity, often giving the illusion of being live-action (make no mistake, not one frame utilized rotoscoping). However, the film often replicates the look of a live-action film. Surprisingly, the fluid ""camera movement"" is similar to the styles used in the French New Wave - length dolly shots, long takes, 360 degree turns, and even rapid zooms. In one bravura shot, the camera dollys from a close-up of Zig-Zag's eyes with full 3-D perspective and then revealed to be a reflection in another character's eye - continuing to pull out.It's important to note that everything in the film was as intricate as possible. As mentioned before, the most subtle emotions conveyed by characters say more than dialogue. Tack's facial emotion is hidden by his pale face, but the one or two tacks held in his lips become his smile or frown. Zig-Zag is drawn with extra shoulder joints like a marionette. His face is virtually a characture of Vincent Price (appropriately). If that's not enough, Zig-Zag has six digits on each hand, each with an extra joint, and 20 rings per hand. The Thief conveys his want (whether it be the golden balls or jewels) through a reflection in his eyes. Desert brigands are literally animated sketches (in contrast to the highly refined main characters). The settings are drawn with squashed perspective as a homage to Persian miniatures paintings.The story itself combines comedy, romance, fantasy, with a little bit of scares. The One-Eye Army is reminiscent of the Teutonic soldiers in Alexander Nevsky - led by the massive Mighty One-Eye. The Thief constantly gets into injury or mishaps as if he were a human Wile E. Coyote (not a coincidence since Ken Harris, the main animator for the thief, often animated the classic Roadrunner cartoons). Tack is constantly at work - sometimes repairing shoes in his sleep.The centerpiece of the film, though, is the gigantic One-Eye Army War Machine. Filled with Rube Goldberg mousetrap devices. The destruction sets off a chain reaction, resulting in self-destruction.Featuring beautiful and stunning animation, wonderful vocal performances, and plenty of laughs - The Thief and the Cobbler almost had a chance at being the greatest animated film ever made.After decades of work, with only 15 minutes of animation to complete in 4 months, the investors pulled out of a negative pickup deal, resulting in the incomplete film to be bought-out by the Completion Bond Company. Richard Williams was taken off his own project. Incomplete animation was farmed out to Korea where it was finished poorly (even compared to the original work). Many voices were re-dubbed, including Sir Anthony Quayle's wonderful King Nod. Insipid musical sequences were added. Over 20 minutes of completed animation were cut out of the film. Tack was given a new voice regardless of his lips moving or not. Originally with an eclectic soundtrack consisting of classical (much from Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade), surreal Wendy Carlos-eque electronic pieces, and even some fierce jazzy sections - it was replaced with a mediocre orchestral score that borrowed heavily from Henry Mancini's themes for The Pink Panther.While the original story remained intact to an extent, many inexplicable changes were made. Tack, shown to be quite a successful cobbler, was changed via a new opening narration to be an orphan and shoemaker's apprentice. Yum-Yum was changed into a feminist. Originally with a modulated, demonic voice, Mighty One-Eye was redubbed with a laughably tame voice.The misery did not end there. Miramax picked up distribution for the United States and altered the film even further. The first release was retitled The Princess and the Cobbler. This new version, Arabian Knight made even worse changes. The Thief, thankfully left as a mute in the prior version, was given a voice provided by Jonathan Winters - who seemed to ad-lib the entire performance. Phido, Zig-Zag's vulture, was given a voice even with absolutely no lip-sync. Tack and Yum-Yum were redubbed again, often with the ADR out of sync. Even more footage was deleted such as an entire subplot with the Mad Holy Old Witch (voiced by Carry On ____ regular Joan Sims) and much of the fantastic War Machine sequence. Even worse, this further altered version was marketed as an Aladdin clone - to the point of having overdubs referencing the film.Even in its truncated and emasculated form, the genius of the original animation is stunning. Negotiations have been off and on since the release of the altered cuts to restore it. The Walt Disney Company currently owns the film and has the power to bring back Richard Williams to allow him to restore and finish the film the way it was intended to be seen.Until this happens, the only way to see the original film is via VHS tape bootlegs - often from 3rd generation sources. Considering how much a fanbase exists thanks to the bootleg, it would be benificial to Disney and fans for the uncut version to finally be made available not only on DVD, but to be allowed a wide theatrical release. Thanks to the rules of the Academy Award, a theatrical release of a restoration would allow it to win the Best Animated Feature Oscar - among others.Until then, avoid the current DVD like the plague. The Thief and the Cobbler is one of the rare cel-animated films shot in CinemaScope - at the time of the film's production starting, only two American films shot in wide-format had been made (Disney's The Lady and the Tramp and Sleeping Beauty). The commercial DVD is in pan & scan, which does unforgivable damage to the virtuoso 2.35:1 framing the film had - even the laserdisc preserved this.",5,The Magnificent Ambersons of

872129,A1FP2LA6M2OJX0,B0006Q93L0,"R. Holman ""the_holmboy""","[46, 53]","I am not here to rant about how what this movie became after Miramax/Disney got a hold of it back in the mid 90's. However, I am here to expound my extreme irritation with this shoddy release.A little history first: A fullscreen, 2 channel version of this movie on DVD was offered as a free promotional item on cereal boxes in Canada about 5 years ago.  I picked one up at that time for a few bucks on an auction site.  I still have the cereal box version in my collection, holding out for a Widescreen release, similar to the one that I first saw on Laserdisc.  So at long last Disney releases it on DVD and it is the same exact thing that was offered on the cereal box, but now it is the price you see here - ouch!  Actually, I found it a local ***-Mart store for half as much, so shame on this place for their price gouging.This is a clear case of Disney not knowing their audience.  It appears family movies are more marketable in fullscreen, even though most buyers of this video are going to be animation fans, original content changes notwithstanding.  Disney should have taken the same angle with this one that they took with the excellent Studio Ghibli releases.  But the man behind that brilliant maneuver, John Lasseter at Pixar, probably has shaky relations with Disney at this point.  So this half-baked release will sit on the shelf next to another crappy Disney release, Mulan II, and gather dust.

872130,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0006Q93L0,Trevor Willsmer,"[9, 9]","Richard Williams' legendary labour of love The Thief and the Cobbler is one of those films that was just born unlucky. After spending three decades working on it, the animator over-ran the budget and was taken off his own picture, with the gaps filled in by cheap Thai and Hungarian animation that sticks out like a sore thumb, many of the original voice cast (Anthony Quayle, Donald Pleasance, Felix Aylmer, Sean Connery) redubbed, musical numbers added and the film retitled The Princess and the Cobbler in a version that only seems to have ever been released in Australia (sadly, the Australian DVD is panned and scanned from the original Scope ratio, as is this release). Then, to add insult to injury, Miramax re-edited that version even further from Williams' intentions and retitled it Arabian Knight to cash-in on the success of Aladdin, leading to a film intentionally designed as anti-Disney animation being marketed as the very thing its creator was rebelling against.The Miramax cut presented here is quite painful to watch at times, not least because of the horrendous non-stop stream of subconciousness mutterings from Jonathan Winters dubbed over the silent character of the Thief, best described as the cinematic equivalent of sitting next to a loquacious drunk with exceptionally bad breath on the last bus home. At one point Roy Disney tried to restore the film to its original conception, seeking out the lost and unused sequences and talking about getting Williams to finish the film his way - only for the Disney-Eisner feud to see the film's champion leave the company and the film in the Weinstein's tender mercies.The film would never have been a masterpiece: for all it's visual audacity there never seems to have been enough of a story. Williams was clearly more interested in animating increasingly elaborate and intricate sequences involving the Thief than in filling out the plot points, but what's especially astonishing is that in an incredible act of cinematic vandalism many of the most visually inventive parts of the film hit the cutting room floor even though whole sequences had been completed - indeed, even much of the truly extraordinary work in the climactic destruction of the war machine has been cut. While some of these scenes were relegated to the end credits sequence, in some cases their omissions leads to massive continuity problems and gaps in the plot. To make matters worse, the original footage seems to have disappeared, preventing its partial restoration. Still, I suppose we should be grateful (though surprised would be a more appropriate reaction) that they didn't replace Vincent Price's voice as well.There are surviving moments of visual genius, particularly a brief but amazing chase sequence across chequered and patterned floors and backgrounds that is all the more impressive for being entirely hand-drawn (Williams started work in 1968 long before computer animation was even a glimmer on the far horizon), but they're never enough to compensate for the fact that you don't really care about the characters or the story around them. The Cobbler in particular is a bland and uninteresting character, all the more so for being mute (or at least in the original version until the last line of the film, originally delivered rather clumsily by Sean Connery, though both released versions gave him voice-over dialog - in this Miramax cut the Cobbler is voiced by Matthew Broderick). The work print, filled out with storyboards and pencil tests, gives some impression of what has been lost and how much better this could have been, though that is not included on this disc (widely circulated at conventions, it would at least been a gesture to animation fans to include it regardless of its poor quality). But whichever version you see you'll be left with a film that frustrates and astounds to varying degrees.Sadly, while they have reverted to Williams' title, Miramax's DVD is exactly the same `Arabian Knight' cut with no restored footage or extras. In fact, it manages to be even more disappointing than their laser disc release - while that at least was in 2.35:1 widescreen, this every-effort-spared barebones release doesn't even have a widescreen transfer.
