There are many videos of both Japanese and Western smiths forging Japanese and Japanese-styled blades on YouTube, many of them very good, but this film doesn't rest on its laurels. It includes interviews and footage with all of the craftsmen involved in the task, from tsuka(handle) makers(both those who carve the core and wrap the handle), saya(scabbard) makers, habaki(blade collar) makers, toshigi(blade polishers), horimono(blade carvings) carvers, and of coarse, the smith themselves. They also conduct interviews with noted Kenjutsu(Japanese sword fighting) masters. The quality of the video is very crisp and clear, and most of the major questions are asked/answered. A great film for both the casually interested and ardent students of all things related to Japanese swords.",5,"Great, in depth look into the facets of making a Japanese sword.",1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,952,"['stated', 'title', 'review', 'great', 'comprehensive', 'look', 'multifaceted', 'process', 'creating', 'fully', 'fitted', 'finished', 'Nihonto', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'are', 'many', 'videos', 'Japanese', 'Western', 'smiths', 'forging', 'Japanese', 'Japanese-styled', 'blades', 'YouTube', 'many', 'very', 'good', 'film', ""n't"", 'rest', 'laurels', 'interviews', 'footage', 'craftsmen', 'involved', 'task', 'tsuka', 'handle', 'makers', 'who', 'carve', 'core', 'wrap', 'handle', 'saya', 'scabbard', 'makers', 'habaki', 'collar', 'makers', 'toshigi', 'blade', 'polishers', 'horimono', 'blade', 'carvings', 'carvers', 'coarse', 'smith', 'also', 'conduct', 'interviews', 'noted', 'Kenjutsu', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'fighting', 'masters', 'quality', 'video', 'very', 'crisp', 'clear', 'most', 'major', 'questions', 'are', 'asked/answered', 'great', 'film', 'casually', 'interested', 'ardent', 'students', 'things', 'related', 'Japanese', 'swords']",Art of the Japanese Sword

1397676,AIH35QDMJEJK0,B004DY8M7C,J Book,"[13, 14]","I like and enjoy many things Japanese.  I was a missionary there as my last job.  Any free time I  had I went out looking for specific Japanese crafts/craftsmen(women). I found a couple of hands full.  Unfortunately, I never found a sword-maker or any of their lot.  I did find a knife and carving tool maker who was most interesting to watch and ask questions of.Now comes this DVD.... horribly expensive for my poor wallet....but never-the-less... I'm very happy with it.It is NOT a Japanese product...there you must watch the craft-person's face for 1/2 of the video.  Next, you get to see maybe 10 min. of actual hand/tool work....and the rest is preparing some food for everyone involved.)So with that relief...I tell you that I got to see much of all that is involved in making all facets of the trade.(Face and food viewing was minimal or non-existant.) The various parts of construction were great...but WAY to short for my likes.  I like and want to see excessive details in all of this.  Even making the hand grips was just kind of hinted at. Seeing and hearing a knife cut a piece of Magnolia wood is music to my ears....I realize the blade is the ""soul"" of the warrior, etc.... but there are many parts to the thing and for the price I wished to see so much more.  The hand guard was not even mentioned....I only saw ONE in the whole DVD!So, I gave the DVD a 5 rating...which it does deserve.  NO doubt.  In spite of not enough detail.... it is a superbly made and assembled flick.  Thank you who done it.!!",5,One of the best....,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,1519,"['like', 'enjoy', 'many', 'things', 'Japanese', 'was', 'missionary', 'there', 'last', 'job', 'free', 'time', 'had', 'went', 'out', 'looking', 'specific', 'Japanese', 'crafts/craftsmen', 'women', 'found', 'couple', 'hands', 'full', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'found', 'sword-maker', 'lot', 'did', 'find', 'knife', 'carving', 'tool', 'maker', 'who', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'watch', 'ask', 'questions', 'of.Now', 'DVD', 'horribly', 'expensive', 'poor', 'wallet', '.but', 'never-the-less', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'it.It', 'NOT', 'Japanese', 'product', 'there', 'must', 'watch', 'craft-person', 'face', '1/2', 'video', 'Next', 'get', 'see', 'maybe', '10', 'min', 'actual', 'hand/tool', 'work', '.and', 'rest', 'preparing', 'food', 'everyone', 'involved', 'So', 'relief', 'tell', 'got', 'see', 'much', 'involved', 'making', 'facets', 'trade', 'Face', 'food', 'viewing', 'was', 'minimal', 'non-existant', 'various', 'parts', 'construction', 'were', 'great', 'WAY', 'short', 'likes', 'like', 'want', 'see', 'excessive', 'details', 'Even', 'making', 'hand', 'grips', 'was', 'just', 'kind', 'hinted', 'Seeing', 'hearing', 'knife', 'cut', 'piece', 'Magnolia', 'wood', 'music', 'ears', '.I', 'realize', 'blade', 'soul', 'warrior', 'etc', 'are', 'many', 'parts', 'thing', 'price', 'wished', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'hand', 'guard', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'only', 'saw', 'ONE', 'whole', 'DVD', 'So', 'gave', 'DVD', '5', 'rating', 'deserve', 'doubt', 'spite', 'not', 'enough', 'detail', 'superbly', 'made', 'assembled', 'flick', 'Thank', 'who', 'done', 'it.']",Art of the Japanese Sword

Does the video cover every single aspect- no.  I do not believe one video or book could.  I've studying the art of Japanese sword making for several years, read many good books and spent time with a traditional Japanese sword smith in his shop.  The making of a Japanese sword is not a simple process, but take the collaboration of many master artisans.  One thing I liked particularly about this video was the interviews with each of the artists as they worked.  It takes years of hard work before any apprentice is permitted to work on their own.  I didn't realize that saya or scabbard maker requires an 11 year apprenticeship.  I recommend anyone seriously interested in wanting to understand what goes into making a Japanese sword to watch this video.  One item which didn't get much attention was the tsuba, but that is almost an art form in and of itself as is every process involved in making a traditional Japanese sword.  The only thing I can think of that is better than watching this DVD would be to  spending time with a traditional Japanese sword smith as they first make their steel and then transform into a work of art.  That is something I had the opportunity to do and I encourage others to do, but one can save a lot of time and money by simply watching this DVD as it contains things which I had not previously seen before in other videos or books.",5,"Review of ""The Art of the Japanese Sword"" DVD",1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1499,"['DVD', 'outstanding', 'job', 'covering', 'basis', 'involved', 'making', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'one', 'hour', '23', 'minutes', 'video', 'cover', 'single', 'aspect-', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'one', 'video', 'book', 'could', ""'ve"", 'studying', 'art', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'making', 'several', 'years', 'read', 'many', 'good', 'books', 'spent', 'time', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'smith', 'shop', 'making', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'not', 'simple', 'process', 'take', 'collaboration', 'many', 'master', 'artisans', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'particularly', 'video', 'was', 'interviews', 'artists', 'worked', 'years', 'hard', 'work', 'apprentice', 'permitted', 'work', 'own', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'saya', 'scabbard', 'maker', '11', 'year', 'apprenticeship', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'seriously', 'interested', 'wanting', 'understand', 'what', 'making', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'watch', 'video', 'One', 'item', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'tsuba', 'almost', 'art', 'form', 'process', 'involved', 'making', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'think', 'better', 'watching', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'spending', 'time', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'sword', 'smith', 'first', 'make', 'steel', 'then', 'transform', 'work', 'art', 'something', 'had', 'opportunity', 'do', 'encourage', 'others', 'do', 'one', 'can', 'save', 'lot', 'time', 'money', 'simply', 'watching', 'DVD', 'things', 'had', 'not', 'previously', 'seen', 'other', 'videos', 'books']",Art of the Japanese Sword

It presents a very good overview, especially if you're a newcomer to the world of Japanese sword making.As good as it is, I couldn't help but feel that,for the price, it should have been a little longer and more in depth.  I could listen to the sword makers talk about their art all day.  Like most attempts at covering this subject, the blade gets the bulk of the coverage here with the furniture, polishing, and saya getting short shrift at the end.  Again, I can understand this perspective but the documentary is under 90 minutes in length.
