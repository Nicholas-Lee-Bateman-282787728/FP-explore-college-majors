I've been watching low-budget flicks for many years looking for something that could ever come close to the eerie feeling I got when first watching 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and although there have been some decent attempts along the way there have been MANY MORE awful ones, so it's nice to finally be able to say that 'Staunton Hill'-fits-the-bill! This is one creepy and disturbing flick! It's VERY realistic and never strays into unbelievable territory, building up slowly but steadily its sense of impending dread (much like the original 'Chainsaw') then unleashes its brutality in a quick and violent fashion that is grim, relentless and highly unpredictable! Seriously this movie was quite satisfying to behold! I have a very high standard for giving movies 5 stars (which is reserved only for the classics) but I want to give this one 4 1/2 stars because it's just a notch under classic! I must admit that I was almost going to pass this one up, thinking that Cameron Romero was just hitching a ride into movie making from his famous dad but horror fans should take note of the new Romero's talents!

1265140,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002EBRF88,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","This movie is bad.  Not in a ""so bad it's campy"" way and not in a ""so bad it's disgusting"" way.  Staunton Hill is an amateurish mess from a director who is obviously learning his way around camera, plot, and actors.  And all of that is quite visible on screen.Let's start with the plot.  Hitchhikers in the 70s stumble their way onto a cannibalistic family.  We know that it's the 70s because the fact is ham-fistedly made clear from the pick in the African-American guy's hair (Kiko Ellsworth as Boone) to footage of the race riots.  The fact that it's the 70s has almost no bearing whatsoever on the plot other than to remove the convenient issue of cell phones.  It does have one upside; the footage has the grainy feel of a 70s film.SPOILER HILL: There's a subplot about attempting to graft limbs onto a dying girl. It takes place on an entirely different set, complete with an attractive assistant who never shows up elsewhere in the film.  The connection between this scene and the rest of the movie is Quintin (Charlie Bodin), a failed medical student who is conducting some unorthodox surgery - surgery we can only assume will save the dying girl that we know nothing about.Quintin lures our unsuspecting victims to their doom with a friendly demeanor and an offer of a ride.  Romero doesn't seem to understand foreshadowing, because he makes it very clear that Quintin is actually part of the crazy family within the first ten minutes.  By the time it's revealed that Quintin is actually the mastermind of the operation, Romero intercuts the revelatory scene with every clue from the first half of the movie.  It's like horror movies for dummies -- Romero isn't confident enough either in his own filmmaking skills or the audience's ability to figure out that Quintin is actually a Really Bad Guy.  It robs the revelation of any suspense.Like the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the crazy family is as much filled with lumbering monsters (B.J. Hendricks as the mentally-impaired Buddy) as it is with crazy old ladies (Sherry Weston as Geraldine) and fat people (Kathy Lamkin as Louise).  In fact, Lamkin is basically playing the same character she played in the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Unlike the original, Cameron confuses ""creepy"" with ""violent."" The purpose of having a character in an archaic wheelchair was to show how backwards the family was - and at the same time, show how they were willing to feed victims even to their elderly and infirm.  Here, Geraldine is a caricature.  Actress Weston looks far too young to be the crazy old lady and the director equips her with a taser capable of killing a man.  She actually takes out the fittest member of the group, Cole (David Rountree), by herself.The list of serious flaws goes on and on.  The movie seems to center on the gutting and dismemberment of Trish (Paula Rhodes), intercut with dialogue from Boone as he explains the horrors that happen at a slaughterhouse: the animals are still alive as they are drained of blood, squealing.  Except that's not what happens to Trish.  She gets her eyeball caved in and is unconscious by the time the throat-slitting happens.  Staunton Hill's one chance at being horrifying is tripped up by a narrative that doesn't match what's on screen.When hottie Jordan (Cristen Coppen) manages to escape, there's a final confrontation between two characters that happens so quickly, without any sort of drama, that it may well as well be two stuntmen duking it out. And it probably IS just two stuntmen.Staunton Hill is more film project than film.

If your looking for sheer terror this film doesn't deliver much at all. If your looking for gore, there is some but if your accustomed to movies like Hostel or the Hills Have Eyes remake your going to be dissapointed for certain. Even those films are rather weak compared to some I've seen. The gore is pretty good but on a scale of 1-10 it rated a minus 4 as far as I am concerned. There is no actual torture because the victims were all dead before they got butchered. The villains in this movie were not all that creepy or very scary at all. They were more like downright silly. The acting was pretty good though by a couple of the characters, and I think they deserve better than this because they do have some level of talent. There is a lot of good cinematography and some beautiful country in the process which I found really the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The worst thing is that the actors and their reaction to very horrifying moments were muted and seemed very unrealistic. Instead of screaming in terror, or begging with any real conviction they react more relaxed and sullen, not as people would in a real situation like this. The music was pretty original with some very good ideas. Other than that this movie fails on the scale or gore movie. It fails as a torture porn movie. It fails as much of a scary movie.

If you are an avid horror movie fan you should feel at home watching this one. It is a Chainsaw Massacre rip off, better done than most. The Staunton family was great. Kathy Lamkin as the head of the clan was superb. The 6 college kids left much to be desired. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was just that the writer forgot to give them interesting character. I guess the wheel chair guy had already been done. If you like watching bloody women getting tied down and having their clothes removed to their undergarments, then this movie is for you.",3,DIDN'T WE SEE THIS ONE BEFORE?,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2010,623,"['DID', ""N'T"", 'WE', 'SEE', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'BEFORE', 'Everyone', 'looked', 'so', 'familiar', 'are', 'avid', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'should', 'feel', 'home', 'watching', 'one', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'rip', 'off', 'better', 'done', 'most', 'Staunton', 'family', 'was', 'great', 'Kathy', 'Lamkin', 'head', 'clan', 'was', 'superb', '6', 'college', 'kids', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'was', ""n't"", 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'just', 'writer', 'forgot', 'give', 'interesting', 'character', 'guess', 'wheel', 'chair', 'guy', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'like', 'watching', 'bloody', 'women', 'getting', 'tied', 'having', 'clothes', 'removed', 'undergarments', 'then', 'movie']",Staunton Hill
