1148615,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B00153ZQR8,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[4, 4]","Super Pocoyo is a collection of small Pocoyo episodes which are great for kids with small attention spans or just as something quick to watch.  In Pocoyo there is a narrator that talks but other than that the characters only make a few sounds/words every now and then.  It is a cute and simple show great for preschoolers.  My 2 year old actually cracked up when watching this DVD and then I laughed because I couldn't figure out what he was laughing at!  The animation is bright, colorful and full of fun shapes but as far as a plot goes there really isn't one.  The show just has Pocoyo and his friends doing simple tasks and small adventures.  It is not really meant to be educational but rather ""learning through laughter"" and showing friendship.",4,Cute and bright!,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,750,"['Super', 'Pocoyo', 'collection', 'small', 'Pocoyo', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'kids', 'small', 'attention', 'spans', 'just', 'something', 'quick', 'watch', 'Pocoyo', 'narrator', 'talks', 'other', 'characters', 'only', 'make', 'few', 'sounds/words', 'now', 'then', 'cute', 'simple', 'show', 'great', 'preschoolers', '2', 'year', 'old', 'actually', 'cracked', 'up', 'when', 'watching', 'DVD', 'then', 'laughed', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'laughing', 'animation', 'bright', 'colorful', 'full', 'fun', 'shapes', 'as', 'far', 'plot', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'show', 'just', 'Pocoyo', 'friends', 'doing', 'simple', 'tasks', 'small', 'adventures', 'not', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'educational', 'rather', 'learning', 'laughter', 'showing', 'friendship']",Pocoyo: Super Pocoyo

1148617,ATXTZV84SIGXE,B00153ZQR8,"J. Monfort ""smart cookie""","[4, 5]","I bought our first Pocoyo DVD after seeing a Pocoyo cartoon with my 4 year old nephew while on vacation. He was mesmerized, which surprised me because he is a very energetic child.I bought this one because of how much he enjoyed the first one (till he ""lost"" it), and he's going through a superhero craze right now. This DVD is broken up into 8-10 smaller stories. Running time is about an hour and a half, though you can choose how much of it your child watches from the menu. You can play them all or select individual ones.The stories are very simple to understand, and are done with almost no dialogue (all are narrated). Pocoyo and his friends perform simpler tasks, play make believe, and have small adventures. It's all very gentle, but not boring. There is excitement in the color palette (bright characters on a white background), in the music, and in Pocoyo's mannerisms. The emotions taught are realistic, as are the reactions of his friends.Overall, I think this a great DVD for little kids. As I said, my nephew who will be 5 in June watched the whole DVD through twice in a day. His favorite episodes were ""Super Pocoyo"" and ""Pocoyo juggles."" Enjoy - it's worth it!",5,"Perfect for children, and a solid DVD!",1299542400,"03 8, 2011",2011,1179,"['bought', 'first', 'Pocoyo', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'Pocoyo', 'cartoon', '4', 'year', 'old', 'nephew', 'vacation', 'was', 'mesmerized', 'surprised', 'very', 'energetic', 'child.I', 'bought', 'one', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'one', 'lost', 'going', 'superhero', 'craze', 'right', 'now', 'DVD', 'broken', 'up', '8-10', 'smaller', 'stories', 'Running', 'time', 'hour', 'half', 'can', 'choose', 'how', 'much', 'child', 'watches', 'menu', 'can', 'play', 'select', 'individual', 'ones.The', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'simple', 'understand', 'are', 'done', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'are', 'narrated', 'Pocoyo', 'friends', 'perform', 'simpler', 'tasks', 'play', 'make', 'believe', 'have', 'small', 'adventures', 'very', 'gentle', 'not', 'boring', 'excitement', 'color', 'palette', 'bright', 'characters', 'white', 'background', 'music', 'Pocoyo', 'mannerisms', 'emotions', 'are', 'realistic', 'are', 'reactions', 'friends.Overall', 'think', 'great', 'DVD', 'little', 'kids', 'said', 'nephew', 'who', 'will', 'be', '5', 'June', 'watched', 'whole', 'DVD', 'twice', 'day', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'were', 'Super', 'Pocoyo', 'Pocoyo', 'juggles', 'Enjoy']",Pocoyo: Super Pocoyo
