This might surprise some people, but I can honestly say that this show is in the same vain as ""I Love Lucy"". Of course not in terms of storyline or theme, but the writing is fresh, current, and unique. And the most important thing about Parks and Recreation is that it makes you laugh out loud, seriously! I haven't belly-laughed so much since the show I mentioned before, this show is THAT good! Love the effortless chemisty between Amy Poehler and Adam Scott, they are so cute! Rashida Jones, Nick Offerman, and the rest of the cast are a hoot! I've watched every season and Season 4 is my personal favorite. I highly recommend this offbeat comedy!

1440197,AMFMVWHYF2Q6T,B0053O8ACS,D. C. Obraztsov,"[1, 1]","First of all, if you like The Office, skip all reviews and watch immediately.  This is similar to The Office in many ways (particularly it's ""mockumentary"" style) and is even funnier, especially as the seasons progress (reverse for The Office).  It somehow gets better and better, and the characters are some of the most likable, unique, and funniest on television, some in television history.Amy Poehler plays Leslie Knope, a very ambitious and goofy government employee who this season is trying to get on City Council.  In the first season the character was criticized for acting too dumb (think like Michael Scott, a bit), so they made her a little less ditzy going into season 2 and she's been sharpened more and more since then.  Leslie is still incredibly goofy, but it's much more evident now how smart she is.  Unlike Michael Scott in The Office, Leslie is super hard-working and sleeps 3 and 1/2 hours on average a night because she spends all of her time working.  Like Michael Scott, she has a crazy sweet tooth.I love Poehler and her portrayal of Leslie because it is so refreshing to have a non-sexualized woman as a lead role on a television show.  Poehler is a very pretty woman, no doubt, but she doesn't rely on her looks at all for this show.  She dresses very conservatively and I don't think we see even a hint of cleavage.  She is a super empowering female character and a great role model.Ron Swanson, played by Nick Offerman, has a crazy cult following and has been dubbed by many critics as one of the funniest characters in television history, and the relationship between him and Leslie is compared a lot to that of Mary and Lou's from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.  In the first season Ron wasn't as prevalent, but now he has nearly iconic status.  Ron hates the government, so is constantly FOR cutting spending and hates to work.  He hates fancy technology and pop culture and spends most of his free time woodworking, eating steak, fishing, hunting, etc.  He's the All-American manly man, and Offerman is so skilled in deadpan comedy.  The actor and character are also quite similar, especially their affinity to woodworking.  If you check out Offerman's Twitter, he closed it because it was a ""mistake"" and wanted to go out in nature instead.  This just adds to the uniqueness that is Ron Swanson.  My boyfriend is 40 and Ron Swanson is now his ""hero,"" lol.  He really is hilarious.Aziz Ansari plays Tom Haverford, who is obsessed with making lots of money and what's hot and what's not.  He also is amazingly great and weird at coming up with business names and ideas.  Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza as married couple Andy Dwyer and April Ludgate respectively is one of the best decisions the showrunners have made for character development.  They complement each other, are fun and cute to watch, and most of all - hilarious.  Andy is dumber than ever.This is definitely one of the best comedies on television right now.  Some of my other favorites are It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Office, Psych, Louie, Wilfred, The League, Veep, and yet - this consistently gets a lot more laughs out of me every time.  And the show gets better as it goes on - it is seriously in its prime right now.  It also has amazing replay value, because it's a lot of fun to go back and rewatch these characters that you didn't know as well at first.",5,"""If you re-arrange the letters of Peru, you get Europe."" - Andy Dwyer",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,3365,"['First', 'all', 'like', 'Office', 'skip', 'reviews', 'watch', 'immediately', 'similar', 'Office', 'many', 'ways', 'particularly', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'even', 'funnier', 'especially', 'seasons', 'progress', 'reverse', 'Office', 'somehow', 'better', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'most', 'likable', 'unique', 'funniest', 'television', 'television', 'history.Amy', 'Poehler', 'Leslie', 'Knope', 'very', 'ambitious', 'goofy', 'government', 'employee', 'who', 'season', 'trying', 'get', 'City', 'Council', 'first', 'season', 'character', 'was', 'criticized', 'acting', 'too', 'dumb', 'think', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'bit', 'made', 'little', 'less', 'ditzy', 'going', 'season', '2', 'been', 'sharpened', 'more', 'more', 'then', 'Leslie', 'still', 'incredibly', 'goofy', 'much', 'more', 'evident', 'now', 'how', 'smart', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Office', 'Leslie', 'super', 'hard-working', '3', '1/2', 'hours', 'average', 'night', 'time', 'working', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'crazy', 'sweet', 'tooth.I', 'love', 'Poehler', 'portrayal', 'Leslie', 'so', 'refreshing', 'have', 'non-sexualized', 'woman', 'lead', 'role', 'television', 'show', 'Poehler', 'very', 'pretty', 'woman', 'doubt', ""n't"", 'rely', 'show', 'very', 'conservatively', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'see', 'even', 'hint', 'cleavage', 'super', 'empowering', 'female', 'character', 'great', 'role', 'model.Ron', 'Swanson', 'played', 'Nick', 'Offerman', 'crazy', 'cult', 'following', 'been', 'dubbed', 'many', 'critics', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'relationship', 'Leslie', 'compared', 'lot', 'Mary', 'Lou', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'first', 'season', 'Ron', 'was', ""n't"", 'prevalent', 'now', 'nearly', 'iconic', 'status', 'Ron', 'government', 'so', 'constantly', 'FOR', 'cutting', 'spending', 'hates', 'work', 'fancy', 'technology', 'pop', 'culture', 'most', 'free', 'time', 'woodworking', 'eating', 'steak', 'fishing', 'hunting', 'etc', 'All-American', 'manly', 'man', 'Offerman', 'so', 'skilled', 'deadpan', 'comedy', 'actor', 'character', 'are', 'also', 'quite', 'similar', 'especially', 'affinity', 'woodworking', 'check', 'out', 'Offerman', 'Twitter', 'closed', 'was', 'mistake', 'wanted', 'go', 'out', 'nature', 'instead', 'just', 'uniqueness', 'Ron', 'Swanson', 'boyfriend', '40', 'Ron', 'Swanson', 'now', 'hero', 'lol', 'really', 'hilarious.Aziz', 'Ansari', 'Tom', 'Haverford', 'who', 'obsessed', 'making', 'lots', 'money', 'what', 'hot', 'what', 'not', 'also', 'amazingly', 'great', 'weird', 'coming', 'up', 'business', 'names', 'ideas', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'married', 'couple', 'Andy', 'Dwyer', 'April', 'Ludgate', 'respectively', 'one', 'best', 'decisions', 'showrunners', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'development', 'complement', 'other', 'are', 'fun', 'cute', 'watch', 'most', 'hilarious', 'Andy', 'dumber', 'ever.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'television', 'right', 'now', 'other', 'favorites', 'are', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'Office', 'Psych', 'Louie', 'Wilfred', 'League', 'Veep', 'yet', 'consistently', 'lot', 'more', 'time', 'show', 'better', 'seriously', 'prime', 'right', 'now', 'also', 'amazing', 'replay', 'value', 'lot', 'fun', 'go', 'back', 'rewatch', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'well', 'first']",Parks and Recreation: Season Four

This season also gets several appearances by none other than Paul Rudd, who does a great job as Bobby Newport, Leslie's chief rival for the seat of Pawnee City Council.And on the subject of City Council, this season features the strongest story arc yet, with plenty of hilarious antics engaged upon during the 22 episodes, while Leslie desperately tries to achieve her lifelong ambition. She pulls out all the stops, even when her campaign advisors leave her, and Parks staff is there to help.

Between the great Ron Swanson, Leslie, Andy, and every other character on the show, Parks is one of the finest comedies currently on television. Season four showed no drop in quality whatsoever. And on top of all of the brilliant comedy, it also had some very touching emotional moments that are hard to forget.

To anyone who has seen Seasons 2 or 3 of Parks and Recreation, this shouldn't be a surprise; this show is one of the best comedies on air right now.And Season 4 does not disappoint.At the end of Season 3, Leslie Knope is asked to run for public office with city council elections on the horizon.  The first episode of Season 4 picks this thread up directly: the crux of this season centers around Leslie running for office.  Unlike previous seasons, this one has a very real and cogent through-line; every episode advances this storyline to some degree.  While some of these episodes are serialized in nature, they also do stand alone as fantastic episodes of television.  The writing on this show involves a great mixture of wit, awkwardness, absurdity, and sentiment.  While many of us were worried that the budding romance between Leslie and Ben would be cheesy and boring (e.g., Pam and Jim,) the writers don't drop the ball.With all of this said, I don't feel like Season 4 was quite as good as the previous two seasons.  This put off many long-time fans, but even with the slight decrease in quality, this season was still head and shoulders above most of today's television.  If you are a newcomer to the series, I would recommend starting from the beginning; not necessarily because you will miss too much of the story, but because the earlier seasons are just as funny (and sometimes funnier) than this one.  If, however, you have watched the previous seasons of Parks and Rec, Season 4 is worthy of your time, energy, and money.Recommended for fans of:  The Office, Community, Arrested Development.Particular highpoints of the season:Episode 2: Ron and Tammys (hilarious finale involving moonshine and Ron Swanson)Episode 15: Dave Returns (features the return of the awkward cop played by Louis C.K.)Episode 19: The Debate (the epic showdown between Ms. Knope and her opponent, Bobby Newport Jr.)Episode 21: Win, Lose or Draw (the satisfying conclusion to the campaign and the season)",5,One of the Best Comedies on Television,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,2097,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'better', 'Office', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', 'show', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'air', 'right', 'now.And', 'Season', '4', 'not', 'disappoint.At', 'end', 'Season', '3', 'Leslie', 'Knope', 'asked', 'run', 'public', 'office', 'city', 'council', 'elections', 'horizon', 'first', 'episode', 'Season', '4', 'picks', 'thread', 'up', 'directly', 'crux', 'season', 'around', 'Leslie', 'running', 'office', 'previous', 'seasons', 'one', 'very', 'real', 'cogent', 'through-line', 'episode', 'storyline', 'degree', 'episodes', 'are', 'serialized', 'nature', 'also', 'do', 'stand', 'alone', 'fantastic', 'episodes', 'television', 'writing', 'show', 'great', 'mixture', 'wit', 'awkwardness', 'absurdity', 'sentiment', 'many', 'were', 'worried', 'budding', 'romance', 'Leslie', 'Ben', 'would', 'be', 'cheesy', 'boring', 'e.g.', 'Pam', 'Jim', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'drop', 'ball.With', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'put', 'off', 'many', 'long-time', 'fans', 'even', 'slight', 'decrease', 'quality', 'season', 'was', 'still', 'head', 'shoulders', 'most', 'today', 'television', 'are', 'newcomer', 'series', 'would', 'recommend', 'starting', 'beginning', 'not', 'necessarily', 'will', 'miss', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'are', 'just', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'funnier', 'one', 'however', 'have', 'watched', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Parks', 'Rec', 'Season', '4', 'worthy', 'time', 'energy', 'money.Recommended', 'fans', 'Office', 'Community', 'Arrested', 'Development.Particular', 'highpoints', 'season', 'Episode', '2', 'Ron', 'Tammys', 'hilarious', 'finale', 'involving', 'moonshine', 'Ron', 'Swanson', 'Episode', '15', 'Dave', 'Returns', 'return', 'awkward', 'cop', 'played', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'Episode', '19', 'Debate', 'epic', 'showdown', 'Ms.', 'Knope', 'opponent', 'Bobby', 'Newport', 'Jr.', 'Episode', '21', 'Win', 'Lose', 'Draw', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'campaign', 'season']",Parks and Recreation: Season Four

Anyways I love how the show follows the work of someone dedicated to implementing change in the government, through different projects in the parks department for the better of the community. It works well, however the only technical problems I had, which occurred frequently, was when the sound would stop yet the video would remain playing. This issue occurs for other TV via Amazon prime too, so this problem should be fixed. Besides that issue it runs well, when the internet connection is good. Anyways this is a great great gift for those who enjoy Amy Poehler's comedy, though it can be slap stick funny at times, it truly is funny and is a great accomplishment for her as well as women comedians.
