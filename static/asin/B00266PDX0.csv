Their chemistry was undeniable!  So much so the characters got hitched in a 1965 highly-televised episode :-)",5,Put it on DVD already,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,339,"['Now', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'out', 'DVD', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'aired', 'same', 'number', 'years', 'same', 'period', 'likely', 'not', 'far', 'behind.Inger', 'had', 'such', 'grace', 'such', 'elegance', 'Bill', 'Windom', 'was', 'dashing', 'very', 'sexy', 'chemistry', 'was', 'undeniable', 'So', 'much', 'characters', 'got', 'hitched', '1965', 'highly-televised', 'episode']",The Farmer's Daughter TV Series

Mathieu ""waldenpond88""","[2, 2]","I grew up in Germany watching mid sixties TV series like ""Tammy"", ""I dream of Jeannie"", ""Flipper"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" etc.But for me and many of my class mates ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (in Germany called ""Katy"") was the best of them all...with one exception: ""Kentucky Jones"" with Dennis Weaver and Ricky Der. That was lovely, too!Also I wish Desilu would finally release ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) on DVD. It's only 30 color episodes, not such a big deal and people wouldn't have to worry, if season 2 will be released (for instance they stopped releasing ""Peyton Place"").",5,One of the best Classic TV Series,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,596,"['grew', 'up', 'Germany', 'watching', 'mid', 'sixties', 'TV', 'series', 'Tammy', 'dream', 'Jeannie', 'Flipper', 'Man', 'called', 'Shenandoah', 'etc.But', 'many', 'class', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', 'Germany', 'called', 'Katy', 'was', 'best', 'one', 'exception', 'Kentucky', 'Jones', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Ricky', 'Der', 'was', 'lovely', 'too', 'Also', 'wish', 'Desilu', 'would', 'finally', 'release', 'Greatest', 'Show', 'Earth', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'DVD', 'only', '30', 'color', 'episodes', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'people', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'season', '2', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'instance', 'stopped', 'releasing', 'Peyton', 'Place']",The Farmer's Daughter TV Series

Jasinkonis,"[5, 5]","i saw the farmer's daughter in its original run on abc.  it is a beautiful, classy, entertaining show.  the chemistry and charisma of inger stevens and william windom is fabulous.  i watched the show in syndication for as long as it aired.  it is time for this show to be remastered for dvd so it can be collected, treasured and appreciated again.  no, entertainment and stylish shows like this are very rarely produced anymore and this is a serious culture loss.  i hope we get to see inger and william very soon.  i know columbia or shout is capable of doing a boffo job of presenting the farmers daughter on dvd.........happy viewing......gary jasinkonis.......east northport, new york.......",5,high time to be seen again and appreciated........,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,695,"['i', 'saw', 'farmer', 'daughter', 'original', 'run', 'abc', 'beautiful', 'classy', 'entertaining', 'show', 'chemistry', 'charisma', 'inger', 'stevens', 'william', 'windom', 'fabulous', 'i', 'watched', 'show', 'syndication', 'as', 'long', 'aired', 'time', 'show', 'be', 'remastered', 'dvd', 'can', 'be', 'collected', 'treasured', 'appreciated', 'again', 'no', 'entertainment', 'stylish', 'shows', 'are', 'very', 'rarely', 'produced', 'anymore', 'serious', 'culture', 'loss', 'i', 'hope', 'get', 'see', 'inger', 'william', 'very', 'soon', 'i', 'know', 'columbia', 'shout', 'capable', 'doing', 'boffo', 'job', 'presenting', 'farmers', 'daughter', 'dvd', 'happy', 'viewing', 'gary', 'jasinkonis', '.east', 'northport', 'new', 'york']",The Farmer's Daughter TV Series
1251132,AEY0PSRZGDW84,B00266PDX0,"J. Smith ""JThree""","[4, 4]","Great program. Saw this series twenty years ago on the Family Channel, and I was impressed with the acting. Have to give the producers credit for a unique episode where Inger Stevens played a dual role as the Congressman Morley's late wife in flashbacks, and she did it so convincingly. Usually in family sitcoms of this nature, the late family member is never mentioned or discussed (ala Brady Bunch, The Partridge Family, etc.), but this made the series different.Hope that today's audiences would give this program a chance.JThree",4,Great underrated show.,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,533,"['Great', 'program', 'Saw', 'series', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'Family', 'Channel', 'was', 'impressed', 'acting', 'Have', 'give', 'producers', 'credit', 'unique', 'episode', 'where', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'played', 'dual', 'role', 'Congressman', 'Morley', 'late', 'wife', 'flashbacks', 'did', 'so', 'convincingly', 'Usually', 'family', 'sitcoms', 'nature', 'late', 'family', 'member', 'never', 'mentioned', 'discussed', 'ala', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'etc', 'made', 'series', 'different.Hope', 'today', 'audiences', 'would', 'give', 'program', 'chance.JThree']",The Farmer's Daughter TV Series

Inger Stevens is also one of my favorites.  EXcellent program, especially with Kathleen (?) Nesbitt as Glenn's mom.  Three faves in one show.  And the kids were even great.
