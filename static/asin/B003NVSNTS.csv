I love her bubbly and fun personality!When i ordered it, i thought it would be a light easy workout! Its not supper hard but its not supper easy either. Its just in the middle.Four things i really like is:1.) She is bubbly throughout the whole workout but is still like any other women and sometimes has hard with certain moves2.) her and her trainer (nicky) have a great relationship and he actually use to be on the same socccer team as David beckahuam3.) its based on sports but is still really fun even if your not into sports (like me)4.) you can costumes design your workout (chose which workouts you wanna do and in the order) or you can just do them all.If you get this dvd make sure to do the booty bonus (my favorite part of the workout)",4,Love Her!

There's a bit of a cheesiness factor, but if you ever watched The Girls Next Door without getting annoyed you'll be fine. The music isn't that great, but the moves aren't complicated so you can always mute the audio & workout to your iPod. The sports drills give you a great cardio workout that's time efficient. There are 5 different segments (football, basketball, soccer, track & field, kickboxing) plus a booty workout that you can mix and match. Each segment is broken up into 30 second intervals, which makes it great for beginners. You'll work hard without over-exerting yourself (I tried Jillian Michaels & could barely function the next day). If you're at an intermediate or advanced fitness level, you won't break a sweat with this unless you do the entire workout- try P90X or something!

It was definitely challenging but each ""move"" is only 30 seconds, so it's over almost as soon as it's getting really tough.  Plus each segment is only 6 minutes long, so each segment feels pretty easy, and makes you want to go ahead and combine all of the segments.  I definitely got my heart rate and body heat up.  It's super cheesy, but that's what I expected and part of the fun!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes it seems unfinished or unprofessional.  During some of the moves when only Kendra is doing them and the trainer is pointing out what to do, she will stop and interrupt to laugh in the middle of the set.  Also, I felt like some of the sets were missing 1 or 2 reps.  Pretty annoying...

I enjoy her work out.  It is cardio, no floor work. so not alot of toning, just alot of sweating and heart pumping to get your blood flowing and burn fat and calories.  she is just entertaining and fun to listen to and to watch.

I've tried many dvds and the thing I like about this is it is a good workout but it stops just when you think you cant do it anymore. so if your like me and just starting out this is a great workout. If you cant keep up with them then you just stop and run in place as they suggest. I think its great and feel great after just 2 days of doing part of it. you can also customize it and pick which workouts you want to do also. It includes all the sports type exercises you see players doing. Love it and this one is a keeper.

1355920,A231KSL42Z60CQ,B003NVSNTS,Melissa McKenzie,"[3, 4]","I will be the first to admit that I am not a big fan of Kendra.  I typically find her to be the most annoying of the three Girls Next Door.  She didn't do much to help my view of her in this DVD.  I felt like she was trying too hard to be cute and came off a little fake except in the bonus ""booty"" section.  That was the only time I felt like she was being real.Even though I'm not a fan of Kendra, I saw the preview video Amazon had up and it actually looked like it would be a lot of fun, so I gave it a shot....and I was surprised.The sections are very short and go by quickly since the exercises are done in 30 second intervals.  For some 30 seconds feels just right and for others 30 seconds is too short.  I'm actually used to doing interval training in minute intervals so for the most part it ended up being a little easier than what I'm used to although I haven't done personal trainer style interval training in some time (thus why 30 seconds for some exercises felt just right).I've mentioned in another review that I have wrist issues which made part of the Track & Field section impossible for me to do (unfortunately).  There is an exercise in Football that also requires going down to the floor but it is manageable.  That being said, the Kickboxing, Soccer and Basketball sections I found to be the most fun.Other than fact that Kendra comes off a little fake at times, I felt that the time between the sections was a little slow and gave me too much time to rest, even though I was jogging in place the whole time.  There is handful of jumping exercises so if you live on the second floor of an apartment building, like I do, you can't jump as high as you'd like without upsetting your neighbors.  Kendra changes outfits for each section and even though she says she's ""tired"" and even takes a break a couple of times, it is very obvious that she isn't as tired as she's pretending to be, but that's OK.  In the warm up her trainer becomes slightly annoying by counting to three before each stretch is done, but the counting is nice during the intervals.  They do preview the moves for you so you do know what you're going to be doing which is a nice touch.I know it sounds like I'm giving it a negative review, but all of the things I hate about the DVD don't really matter because I enjoyed the actual workout so much.  The sections go by fast and by the time you start to get tired the intervals are over.  I'd really like to give it 3.5 stars but since I don't have that option, I went with 4 because I do think that a lot of people would have fun doing it.  I just hope that if she ends up making a second DVD that it is more challenging (45-60 second intervals) but equally as fun.",4,It was surprisingly fun,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2705,"['will', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Kendra', 'typically', 'find', 'be', 'most', 'annoying', 'three', 'Girls', 'Next', 'Door', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'help', 'view', 'DVD', 'felt', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cute', 'came', 'off', 'little', 'fake', 'bonus', 'booty', 'section', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'being', 'real.Even', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'Kendra', 'saw', 'preview', 'video', 'Amazon', 'had', 'up', 'actually', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'gave', 'shot', '.and', 'was', 'surprised.The', 'sections', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'go', 'quickly', 'exercises', 'are', 'done', '30', 'second', 'intervals', '30', 'seconds', 'feels', 'just', 'right', 'others', '30', 'seconds', 'too', 'short', ""'m"", 'actually', 'used', 'doing', 'interval', 'training', 'minute', 'intervals', 'so', 'most', 'part', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'little', 'easier', 'what', ""'m"", 'used', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'personal', 'trainer', 'style', 'interval', 'training', 'time', 'thus', 'why', '30', 'seconds', 'exercises', 'felt', 'just', 'right', '.I', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'review', 'have', 'wrist', 'issues', 'made', 'part', 'Track', 'Field', 'section', 'impossible', 'do', 'unfortunately', 'exercise', 'Football', 'also', 'going', 'down', 'floor', 'manageable', 'being', 'said', 'Kickboxing', 'Soccer', 'Basketball', 'sections', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'fun.Other', 'fact', 'Kendra', 'off', 'little', 'fake', 'times', 'felt', 'time', 'sections', 'was', 'little', 'slow', 'gave', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'rest', 'even', 'was', 'jogging', 'place', 'whole', 'time', 'handful', 'jumping', 'exercises', 'so', 'live', 'second', 'floor', 'apartment', 'building', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'as', 'high', ""'d"", 'like', 'upsetting', 'neighbors', 'Kendra', 'outfits', 'section', 'even', 'tired', 'even', 'break', 'couple', 'times', 'very', 'obvious', ""n't"", 'as', 'tired', 'pretending', 'be', 'OK', 'warm', 'up', 'trainer', 'slightly', 'annoying', 'counting', 'three', 'stretch', 'done', 'counting', 'nice', 'intervals', 'do', 'preview', 'moves', 'so', 'do', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'doing', 'nice', 'touch.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'giving', 'negative', 'review', 'things', 'hate', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'enjoyed', 'actual', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'sections', 'go', 'fast', 'time', 'start', 'get', 'tired', 'intervals', 'are', ""'d"", 'really', 'like', 'give', '3.5', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'option', 'went', '4', 'do', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'fun', 'doing', 'just', 'hope', 'up', 'making', 'second', 'DVD', 'more', 'challenging', '45-60', 'second', 'intervals', 'equally', 'fun']",N/A
