I have always enjoyed catching series on TV whenever its on. It's great that I can now actually sit down and watch each one in full.This is a great set of films made for TV and actually done well. Many made for tv shows/movies are low budget and lousy acting. This set though seems like they spent the money on graphics and actors, made for a great series.SciFi did well with this set. I'd personally like to them continue for a while but me saying something to them is about as good as me telling someone to give me a million bucks.MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION brings together six of some of the greatest sci-fi authors. Stephen Hawking hosts the series. Also there are many high grade actors in these films - Anne Heche, Malcolm McDowell, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Sean Astin, and Brian Dennehy, to start the list.If you like SCI-FI you will definitely like this 2 disc set. Definitely worth it to add to you home DVD collection.Some of the stories get a bit whacked out but it's cool because the graphics keep you hooked.",5,great series! add to your collection.,1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,1109,"['MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIESWhat', 'great', 'collection', 'short', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'catching', 'series', 'TV', 'whenever', 'great', 'can', 'now', 'actually', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'one', 'full.This', 'great', 'set', 'films', 'made', 'TV', 'actually', 'done', 'well', 'Many', 'made', 'tv', 'shows/movies', 'are', 'low', 'budget', 'lousy', 'acting', 'set', 'spent', 'money', 'graphics', 'actors', 'made', 'great', 'series.SciFi', 'did', 'well', 'set', ""'d"", 'personally', 'like', 'continue', 'while', 'saying', 'something', 'as', 'good', 'telling', 'someone', 'give', 'million', 'bucks.MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'together', 'six', 'greatest', 'sci-fi', 'authors', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'series', 'Also', 'are', 'many', 'high', 'grade', 'actors', 'films', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'start', 'list.If', 'SCI-FI', 'will', 'definitely', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'Definitely', 'worth', 'add', 'home', 'DVD', 'collection.Some', 'stories', 'get', 'bit', 'whacked', 'out', 'cool', 'graphics', 'keep', 'hooked']",Masters Of Science Fiction

1165243,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B001A7GOCA,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[11, 18]","I am a huge Sci-Fi fan and was very disappointed having missed ""Masters of Science Fiction"" when the episodes originally aired, so was very pleased when the whole (short lived) series was released on DVD. This had a lot of potential since the stories were from some very good writers and there are some first class actors in every episode. The set contains all 4 of the broadcasted episodes and two others that were never aired.While I appreciate good Sci-Fi stories, and including a moral message has been done with great success in the past (seeThe Day the Earth Stood Stillfor example), three of these episodes are blatant political statements. This is fine if you are of the political persuasion and hold the opinions be shown as ""correct"", but in most cases these cross the line of entertainment and enter into realm of political vilification.Here are my observations, by episode (no spoilers, all the details can be found on the DVD insert):""A Clean Escape"" - A dying shrink treats a man with no memory. Distinctly Anti-War with fairly gruesome and disturbing scenes - Nothing more than a slap at a conservative president.""The Awakening"" - A comment on the Iraq War,  it's another ""Peace or die"" message. This one was just a complete write-off with all other nations (laughably including China and Pakistan) being wiser and more peaceful than the USA (complete with a warmonger president).""Jerry Was A Man"" - This was the gem in the lot! This episode examines exceptional wealth, genetically designed ""creatures"", and what it means to be human. Slightly cynical, but decent Sci-Fi.""The Discarded"" - Mutants in space, this one is a message on diversity and acceptance. The basic story, acting, and special effects were fairly good, but the gruesome images, sexual references, crude linguistic imagery, and the predictable outcome made this one barely watchable.""Little Brother"" (never aired) - In this well done episode, man's mind vs the inflexible system is examined...who will win? Good Sci-Fi right up to the end.""Watchbird"" (never aired) - What is the cost of increased ""homeland security"", from the DVD insert, ""...is it wise to sacrifice our liberty in the name of our security?"". This is just another politically motivated message, complete with stereotypical corporate and government villains.I really wanted to like this series, but found most of the episodes disappointing and overtly politicized. There is a REASON why this series was taken off the air after only four episodes were shown!

1165244,AN9J46667D80O,B001A7GOCA,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[5, 7]","I hadn't heard of this series when it was airing on ABC last year. Now I'm begining to understand why. It's just not a good show. I'm also not sure why it aired on ABC. If they'd aired it on the Sci-Fi Channel, it still would've sucked, but would've also been much better than 90% of the dross they currently broadcast.We have on these discs six episodes and... that's it, actually. No extras. None. Remember back in the day when Paramount DVDs used to list ""scene selection"" as a special feature? Yeah, these don't even have that.The lousy DVDs set the stage for mediocre production values, terrible writing and very bad plots. Sadly, the first episode was so good it seems like it's part of a different series, but it's a steady downhill slide from there. Let's look at each episode.1. Surprisingly good! Excellent performances, a couple nice twists and some great writing! Too bad it doesn't set the stage for later.2. Eh. Acceptable. I could really do without the religious overtones, though.3. The begining of the end. Overly broad characterizations (not characters), extremely unsubtle plot points, bad overacting, and a plot that's been done much better elsewhere.4. Nice production values, but the characters all look like extras fromNightbreedandTotal Recall, the central explanation for why these people are where they are makes no logical sense, and the ending really makes no sense! Oh, and then there's the fact that these deformities the characters display could be fixed even with modern surgical techniques, much less those available to people with enough tech to build a ship like that. Some great performances by Brian Denehy and John Hurt make it watchable, but that's about the best I can say for it.5. Oh, argh. There's nothing good about this episode. From the offhand reference to the 64th Amendment (cause, you know, after having less than 30 in 230+ years, we need to make up for lost time and add about 35 more in the next fifty years), to the word ""Person"" used as a title, to a made-up name for the main character, to a legal strategy that I can't believe no one would've ever tried before. This was just flat bad and I had a very tough time finishing it.6. Did you know there's dozens of physical changes that take place before someone kills someone else? Neither did I. Neither did most doctors, I'm betting. This episode claims there are these changes, but I wonder just how one determines this. I mean, what, hook someone up to a set of scanners and then let them kill someone else? Right. I bring this up because this is the central plot of this episode and it's pretty darn unlikely. Oh, I also wonder how it is that in this day and age you could have the solo scientist coming up with the concept, doing all the R&D;, doing all the engineering, all the programming, etc, etc, on these warbirds. The episode itself is extremely predictable and uninteresting, and the ending is awfully abrupt and offers no conclusion.There's a place for sci-fi anthology shows. Some of the older ones, like ""The Twighlight Zone"" and ""The Outter Limits"" were very good. None of the newer ones have lived up to that legacy, and this doesn't change that.If you like good science fiction, look elsewhere. You won't even find watchable science fiction here.",1,One out of six isn't bad! Right? Right?

Just a bit frustrating that ABC like many networks just don't give science fiction much of a chance to really succeed and build an audience, of course it's not going to do well during summer evenings, because that when most of your potential audience is out of the house and not watching TV.

1165246,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001A7GOCA,Dave. K,"[3, 5]","At one time anthology shows were fairly popular, but there came a certain point when they were all, but forgotten. With the release of Masters of Horror the anthology show got a new lease on life, while Masters of Horror wasn't the ratings blockbuster many thought it would be it found its audience. Masters of Science Fiction pretty came out of Masters of Horror with some of the same producers one being Mick Garris.Where as Masters of Horror felt more like 1-hr movies, Masters of Science Fiction follows the TV format, which isn't a bad thing, but this show just never really works and often seems more messy than anything. The show is also highly political driven and that can be slightly annoying. I have no problems with social commentary, but I hate when I feel like someone's views are being forced on me regardless if I agree or disagree. It seems this show was just made for the filmmakers to get out their political views.I really wanted to like this show, but I just was never able to get into it and most of the time I was looking over to see how much time has passed, which is never a good thing. Masters of Science Fiction proved to be a ratings failure and only lasted 4 episodes with 2 never airing, but can now be seen on this DVD. Unlike Masters of Horror, the talent here isn't as well proven, but the one thing this show does get right is the casting. Each episode had some really talented actors that can take this material and make it slightly better. To be quite honest I found it to be a chore to get through the episodes and thankfully there were only 6 had their been more I doubt I would have been able to finish it. Maybe the hardcore Sci-Fi fans will enjoy this, but odds are you'll be letdown.The DVD from Anchor Bay has an excellent audio and video quality, but very much lacks of the special features, which for me doesn't matter I suppose since I didn't like the show I wouldn't be interested in anything anyone involved had to say.Their was a slight mistake on the insert card and DVD; on the insert card Little Brother is listed as the last episode and on disc 2 it's listed as the last, but when you put on the DVD the last episode is actually Watchbird.A CLEAN ESCAPE- ***Starring- Judy Davis & Sam WaterstonScreenplay- Sam Egan (short story by John KesselDirector- Mark RydellThis is probably the best episode of the series, which isn't saying much since at best it's average. The story is fair enough, but never fully moves forward. Still despite that I mostly liked this one and the performances from Davis and Waterston are excellent; some decent twists save this one.THE AWAKENING- ** Starring- Terry O'Quinn & Elisabeth RohmScreenplay- Michael Petroni (short story by Howard Fast)Director- Michael PetroniHad potential, but mostly falls flat after a solid start. As the episode goes on it just doesn't go anywhere and gets rather boring. The concept reminded me a little bit of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, so that's the main reason I looked forward to this one. But after a decent start it just goes downhill and gets far too preachy.JERRY WAS A MAN- **Starring- Malcolm McDowell & Anne HecheScreenplay- Michael Tolkin (short story by Robert A. Heinlein)Director- Michael TolkinWay too silly and over the top, which was the point, but for me it was just too much. The writing was silly and I couldn't get into this one at all. The only saving grace was McDowell and Heche who were both really funny and make this one just barley watchable.THE DISCARDED- * Starring- John Hurt, James Denton & Brian DennehyScreenplay- Harlan Ellison & Josh Olson (short story by Harlan Ellison)Director- Jonathan FrakesI found this terrible; I quickly lost my attention with the episode and was just passing the time before it finally ended. This one looks like a cheap made for Sci-Fi TV show. Actually that would be an insult to those Sci-Fi originals. This was the last episode to air on network TV and honestly can't say I'm surprised.LITTLE BROTHER- ****Starring- Clifton Collins Jr. & Kimberly EliseScreenplay- Walter Mosley (short story by Walter Mosley)Director- Darnell MartinBest episode of the series; if only the rest could have been like this we'd have a winner. While nothing great, Little Brother is very entertaining and works out quite well. Honestly this is the only one really worth watching.WATCHBIRD- ***Starring- Sean Astin & James CromwellScreenplay- J. Michael Stracznski (short story by Robert Sheckley)Director- Harold BeckerFairly good; has its moments when it's entertaining as well as some boring moments. There was potential to be more, but never quite reaches it. Watchbird is one of the better episodes, which isn't saying much since it was average at best.",2,Below average series,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,4720,"['one', 'time', 'anthology', 'shows', 'were',

Masters of Science Fiction follows in the tradition of The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Amazing Stories and may well be the last time we see anything of the sort on network television.I saw the series when ABC aired it, and I did not mind re-watching the four episodes that were actually broadcast before ABC pulled the plug. As others have noted here, this set of stories probably leans a little too heavily toward the ""thought-provoking social relevance"" end of the sci-fi anthology spectrum. The earlier series all dabbled in this as well, but they also had a lot of stories that were just weird, amusing, or creepy without the burden of a message of some sort.If you collect DVD's of science fiction anthologies, you definitely want to add this set to your collection; more casual fans of the genre will want to see, but not necessarily own, Masters of Science Fiction.",4,Worth watching if you're a fan,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,1038,"['Even', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'stories', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'TV', 'science', 'fiction', 'anthologies', 'aimed', 'adult', 'audiences', 'are', 'probably', 'thing', 'past', 'Masters', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'tradition', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'last', 'time', 'see', 'anything', 'sort', 'network', 'television.I', 'saw', 'series', 'when', 'ABC', 'aired', 'did', 'not', 'mind', 're-watching', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'actually', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'pulled', 'plug', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'here', 'set', 'stories', 'probably', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'thought-provoking', 'social', 'relevance', 'end', 'sci-fi', 'anthology', 'spectrum', 'earlier', 'series', 'dabbled', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'stories', 'were', 'just', 'weird', 'amusing', 'creepy', 'burden', 'message', 'sort.If', 'collect', 'DVD', 'science', 'fiction', 'anthologies', 'definitely', 'want', 'add', 'set', 'collection', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'not', 'necessarily', 'own', 'Masters', 'Science', 'Fiction']",Masters Of Science Fiction

The stories are all independent of each other & cover such sci-fi genres as artificial intelligence, the end of the world & genetics / genetic engineering.The DVD is hosted by the great Stephen Hawking.  Some know him as the Lucasian professor of mathematics, Cambridge university.  Others know him as the author of the mega-popularA Brief History of Time.  Still others know him as the ""really smart dude in a wheelchair"" (Hawking has ALS).  In any case, it's terrific to have him as a part of any science fiction gathering.  To be sure, however, Hawking only has a couple of lines to introduce each story, and occasionally has something to say @ the epilogue.  Hence, calling him a host might be stretching things a wee bit.For the stories, my favorites were A CLEAN ESCAPE and JERRY WAS A MAN & THE AWAKENING, all of which are on the first disc.  The ensemble of actors / actresses is impressive, and it's obvious that Anne Heche has a great time w/her role as a Paris Hilton type of spoiled brat in JERRY WAS A MAN.LITTLE BROTHER could have been better if they had stretched out the story some more.

As others have mentioned, this is very reminiscent of ""The Outer Limites"" or ""Twilight Zone.""  However, those programs tackled controversial issues with SUBTLETY.  This series tries a little too hard to be relevant, when it needed to concentrate on entertainment value.  The anti-war message was blatant, and the tried and true ""diversity"" rears its head as well.  That said, there is something to enjoy here.The acting is top notch with a LOT of recognizable talent.  I love Sam Waterson, Sean Astin and Malcolm McDowell.  If viewers look past the politicizing, the source material is some of the best in the SciFi genre.  Heinlein's writing is usually thought-provoking and the story selected here, ""Jerry was a Man,"" is the best on the disc I think.  In the vein of his masterpiece, ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" it really stands out and the set is worth purchasing for this alone.  Of course, adapting any written material results in something being lost, but the gist is here. Reviewer CFH provides a succinct, if a little harsh, recap of the other episodes.Overall, I think the network should have given this more of a chance.  I missed it entirely when it aired, and would have made an effort to see it if I had known about it.  For me, the biggest disappointment was the lack of extras.  Producers had a great opportunity to explore the works that inspired these stories, with interviews of the authors still living, their impact on actual scientists (like Stephen Hawking), etc.  That would have made this a must-have.

A corporation creates a robotic machine originally to assist with our wartime soldiers. When it saves lives the government uses it to fight crime in the US. In the end, it will question if we are willing to sacrifice liberty for security.THE DISCARDED is based on the short story by Harlan Ellison. Humans born with various mutations are isolated and forced to drift in outer space. Many commit suicide from the loneliness and despair. Hope comes, but they must make a pact with the very people who sent them there to begin with.Judy Davis, Sam Waterson, Anne Heche, Brian Dennehy, John Hurt, James Denton and Malcolm McDowell are to name some of the few stars of this series.

Now recall the best episodes of that show:  ""The Sandkings,"" ""The Quality of Mercy,"" ""The Refuge,"" ""Birthright.""  Great short science fiction, from some great writers.This series is like the best episodes of that show, and it even harken's back to some of the best episodes of the originalThe Outer Limits.  It has stories from some of the best scifi writers, and many of the epsiodes are directed by some of the best scifi filmmakers.  The only real problem is that the series is cut short.  Most of the episodes have servicable effects, but it is obvious in the two unaired episodes that not much money was left for special effects wizardry.That said, you will be hard pressed to find a better value for your short scifi anthology series.  All these episodes feature great writing and acting, and many of them are based on famous short stories by the great masters of science fiction.  The effects, while not on par with something like Star Wars, are good enough not to distract you from the great stories and great acting.My particular favorite episode is called ""A Clean Escape,"" which  adapts John Kessel's short story to devastating effect.  There are almost no effects in this episode, and it takes a long time for the scifi element to become readily apparent, but the acting carries it through the poignant script without a hitch.The only real knock on this DVD set is the lack of extra features.  The disc is bare besides the episodes themselves, and even those menus aren't very well put together.  The DVD release seems to be an attempt at a quick cash-in on a cancelled show, and not the high quality presentation that this series deserves.

Just an excellent series and would like to have been able to see more of these.Albeit, some of the programming would have shunted off to cable, this program really had such potential.  When I first read the reviews on Amazon before ordering it, it sounded like ""Twilight Zone"" before I read that being mentioned by name.  6 episodes, each one with an appeal at so many levels.  Two of them have a similar background theme, the president and the US act unilaterally at times, oh well, some have to get the digs in.  But like the TZone, the episodes take on current issues in our societies in a futuristic reference.  Yet these are a genra all of their own.Thankfully, there is not much in the way of language in the various videos.  There are three that I like, two that are so/so, one with a great message that is just down right gruesome or ghoulish looking, maybe it was produced to be shown on Halloween.My favorites are Sam Waterson in ""A Clean Escape"" as a demented man returning daily to talk with his psychiatrist, Judy Davis, this would make the great beginning of a movie of what went on prior to.  Surprises await and you will not be dissappointed.  ""The Awakening"" with Terry O'Quinn (you know Locke, from Lost) doing a great job as a former armed services researcher into the paranormal. We also have the Smoking Man from X-Files in this one.  Great acting, interesting story, plot, message.One of my favorites is also Little Brother, man vs. machine or a world run by computers.  Clifton Collins, Jr. does a remarkable job of a man faced with insurmountable odds in a world that is run by computers.  Some real cool graphics in this one.Honorable mention to ""Jerry Was a Man"" with Anne Heche playing a Paris Hilton type in a world where humanoids who are man made do all of the repetitive and dangerous work.  Malcom McDowell plays the owner/creator of the humanoids.  They make a few digs at the rich and corporations, done skillfully and in good taste as well.Some of these you kind of wish you could see outside of where they are more of a broad view to engage the imagination.I really liked the brief introduction by Stephen Hawkins and unlike the T-Zone, there is a brief line or two that sum up the story that makes it even more poinant.

Only four of the six episodes made it to American television (Little Brother and Watchbird never aired).  To be honest, i was a bit skeptical about the quality of these shows.  But after viewing them, they're not that bad, it's a shame that the network didn't give the show a better slot or any kind of promotion (I didn't even know the show was on the air).  Smart television is what's missing from the airwaves.  I wish there were more shows like this one instead of the same old lousy sit-coms (British retreads or badly written ones) and cheap-to-produce reality programing. If you want to watch some interesting sci-fi drama then look no further.  I strongly recommend this DVD set.The Discarded:Starring John Hurt and Brian Dennehy as two outcasts from Earth who travel around the solar system along with a group of fellow outsiders who are looking for a place to call home.  Abandoned by those from Earth because of a genetic blood virus that causes certain mutations.

But his freedom his short-lived as he learns the sad reality of a computer based future where criminal justice is swift.  AWatchbirdSean Astin and James Cromwell star in this tale about machine v.

The good doctor has been working with this patient and wants to make a breakthrough before she expires from her grave illness.  To learn the patient's true identity would be all too telling.

DISC 1: This sci-fi series is more intellectual that action-packed, and meant to give you afterthoughts. It wasnt terribly exciting but unique enough to watch start to finish. ""A Clean Escape"" has a good plot but its roundabout execution lacks the mystery it attempts. The scenario of nuclear winter is a believable topic but i felt little for the characters. ""The Awakening"" is my favorite. Can the motive for an alien invasion be a good one, is the question in this story. The ending is a profound one i dont believe I will forget. ""Jerry Was a Man"" is a bizarre tale regarding robots that left me empty. DISC 2: I found ""The Discarded"" an abstract reminder of the corruption and mistrust of government.

1165268,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B001A7GOCA,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[1, 2]","I am thrilled that MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION:  THE COMPLETE SERIES is now available on DVD.  I am very thrilled that I now own it.  I am even more thrilled that this anthology contains two never before seen episodes.I first became aware of MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION during the summer of 2007.  While flipping through the channels, the installment titled ""Jerry Was A Man"" caught my eye on ABC.  ""Jerry Was A Man"" is a short story by Robert Heinlein, one of my favorite authors.  I knew almost immediately what I was seeing and was both stunned and very excited.  Upon investigation, I learned what we now all know:  MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION brings to life the work of six of the world's greatest sci fi authors.  Each episode is based on a well know short story:  ""Jerry Was A Man"" by Robert Heinlein, ""The Discarded"" by Harlan Ellison, ""A Clean Escape"" by John Kessel, ""The Awakening"" by Howard Fast, ""Watchbird"" by Robert Sheckley, and ""Little Brother"" by Walter Mosley.  Each story is directed by a talented director, such as Jonathan Frakes, Harold Becker, or Mark Rydell.  Each installment also includes a star-studded cast - Anne Heche, Malcolm McDowell, Elizabeth Rohm, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Sean Astin, and Brian Dennehy, to name a few.  The production values are outstanding, and famed professor Stephen Hawking hosts the entire series in a manner similar to that of Twilight Zone's Rod Serling.  I only caught three of the four episodes aired at the time, searching in vain for the remainder in reruns.  For what ever reasons, this series received almost no marketing and was never rerun.  So you can understand my elation at discovering these DVDs.This is good, old fashion science fiction at its best, based on strong, intelligent ""future history stories"" by some of the best authors in the business.  These stories are not necessarily easy.  The authors' intent is to make you think.  Classic and classy, these stories have stood the test of time.  And it is about time that someone brought them to television, to a hopefully wider audience.  And it makes you wonder what took them so long.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone, but most especially for lovers of classic science fiction.",5,Science Fiction Greats,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,2200,"['am', 'thrilled', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'COMPLETE', 'SERIES', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'am', 'very', 'thrilled', 'now', 'own', 'am', 'even', 'more', 'thrilled', 'anthology', 'two', 'never', 'seen', 'episodes.I', 'first', 'became', 'aware', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'summer', '2007', 'flipping', 'channels', 'installment', 'titled', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'A', 'Man', 'caught', 'eye', 'ABC', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'A', 'Man', 'short', 'story', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'knew', 'almost', 'immediately', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'was', 'stunned', 'very', 'excited', 'investigation', 'learned', 'what', 'now', 'know', 'MASTERS', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'life', 'work', 'six', 'world', 'greatest', 'sci', 'fi', 'authors', 'episode', 'based', 'well', 'know', 'short', 'story', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'A', 'Man', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'Discarded', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Clean', 'Escape', 'John', 'Kessel', 'Awakening', 'Howard', 'Fast', 'Watchbird', 'Robert', 'Sheckley', 'Little', 'Brother', 'Walter', 'Mosley', 'story', 'directed', 'talented', 'director', 'such', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'Harold', 'Becker', 'Mark', 'Rydell', 'installment', 'also', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'Elizabeth', 'Rohm', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'name', 'few', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'outstanding', 'famed', 'professor', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'entire', 'series', 'manner', 'similar', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'only', 'caught', 'three', 'four', 'episodes', 'aired', 'time', 'searching', 'vain', 'remainder', 'reruns', 'what', 'ever', 'reasons', 'series', 'received', 'almost', 'marketing', 'was', 'never', 'rerun', 'can', 'understand', 'elation', 'discovering', 'DVDs.This', 'good', 'old', 'fashion', 'science', 'fiction', 'best', 'based', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'future', 'history', 'stories', 'best', 'authors', 'business', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'easy', 'authors', 'intent', 'make', 'think', 'Classic', 'classy', 'stories', 'have', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'time', 'someone', 'brought', 'television', 'hopefully', 'wider', 'audience', 'wonder', 'what', 'took', 'so', 'long.HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'anyone', 'most', 'especially', 'lovers', 'classic', 'science', 'fiction']",Masters Of Science Fiction

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[2, 4]","With only four episodes making it to the small screen (and two that never saw the light of day until the release of this DVD set), I'd hardly call ""Masters of Science Fiction"" a true series.  However, Anchor Bay was nice enough to release all six episodes in a standard, thrifty two-disc set.These television adaptations do very little justice to the short stories they've been based on.  With a collection of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein, Robert Sheckley and Harlan Ellison, you'd be hard-pressed to find better printed material to work with.  However, most of the stories chosen follow the age-old science fiction format of ""man screws up/future looks bleak.""In my opinion, none of the episodes are stellar.  However, a few do stand above the pack.  ""Watchbird,"" based on a short story by Sheckley, was one of the episodes that never aired on television.  It should have.  It shows you how bad things can go when a weapon designed for military use is integrated into normal society.  ""The Awakening,"" based on a short story by Howard Fast, blends religion and science fiction and comes very near to being great.  The best of the lot is Heinlein's ""Jerry Was A Man,"" and, as expected, it features the most humor of any of the episodes.The casts for each episode are wonderful, and range from Anne Heche to Malcolm McDowell to Sam Waterston to Sean Astin.

1165273,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B001A7GOCA,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","It was with great anticipation that I watched this series, which I completely missed on television.  Unfortunately, while the series does indeed have stories based on stories by some of the great authors of science fiction, the execution generally leaves something to be desired.  This collection contains some interesting moments, but I suspect it is doomed to be a curiosity that may negatively influence television executives from trying such anthology shows in the future.Six episodes were produced for this series.  The series was quite short-lived, and not all episodes were originally televised in the United States.  One problem may be that science fiction in general is not really all that popular.  Much of what people think is science fiction is actually fantasy or science fantasy (e.g., ""Star Wars"" is science fantasy, though too many people mistakenly classify it as science fiction - even people who should know better).  If you are accustomed to watching fantasy or science fantasy, and you suddenly find yourself in a science fiction story, your reactions are not going to be positive and you may, wrongly, find yourself thinking, ""I do not like this kind of science fiction,"" when in reality you may never have liked ANY kind of science fiction.While the six episodes cover different topics, the range of topics is relatively narrow and may delve too deeply into philosophical and political matters.The first episode, ""A Clean Escape,"" based on a story by award-winning author John Kessel, jumps into an old theme of science fiction, the hazards of technology.  The theme is strongly oriented in the philosophy of power and the inability of people who have no technical background to understand the technology they control.  The story seemed frustratingly slow to develop, and I longed for something to happen, though it never really did.  The shock value was relatively low when the underlying story was finally revealed, and I thought to myself that this was yet another cautionary tale that I had read too many times.  Perhaps a newcomer to science fiction might be more impressed.  Sam Waterston does as well as he can, and indeed, he probably rises above the material he has.  If you love stories involving the depths of human psychology, this story might be for you.The second episode is ""The Awakening,"" by author Howard Fast, who has written but a few science fiction stories.  This story is yet another standard theme of science fiction, visitation by aliens who are here to help us, whether we want to be helped or not.  This story was much better than ""A Clean Escape,"" and the story tries hard to get into the motivations of decision-makers.  Unfortunately, when a story is less than an hour long, and the complexities of the subject are as deep as they are in this story, it is difficult to develop the characters to the point where we care about motivations, so one of the primary benefits to the story is never fully realized.  Furthermore, as with the first story, this story is also strongly political, and the political aspects detract from the story, in my opinion.The third episode is ""Jerry Was a Man,"" based on a short story by Robert A. Heinlein, one of the greatest and most influential science fiction authors.  This story has certain aspects that are humorous, which is a trait of many of Heinlein's stories, while having one or more serious underlying themes.  In the case of this story, the themes are racism, prejudice, and bigotry.  Just what makes a man, and who decides who is human and who is not?  It is easier to appreciate this story when you consider that Heinlein wrote it at a time when there was much racism, and minorities in the United States were often treated more poorly than animals.  As with the previous two stories, there is a political, or perhaps societal, message in this story, but it is much more subtle than in the first two stories.  Anne Heche is a pleasure to watch as she takes command throughout the story.The fourth episode is ""The Discarded,"" based on the short story by science fiction great Harlan Ellison.  This story combines another standard theme of science fiction, a disease or condition that dooms mankind, with one or more political messages that take a while to develop.  Unfortunately, this story is so negative and develops so slowly that the talents of Brian Dennehy and John Hurt are unable to save this story, which might have been much better and been more powerful in a 20 or 25 minute format.The fifth episode is ""Little Brother,"" which I consider to be one of the finest episodes of this series.  The story covers yet another standard theme of science fiction, excessive control and interference by government in the lives of citizens.  However, this story breathes new life into the theme by including a different twist in a society that has come to rely on machines and technology far too much to administer that society.  This story is enjoyable, and I enjoyed the twist at the end, which I did not see coming.The final episode is ""Watchbird,"" based on a short story by science fiction great Robert Sheckley and which stars Sean Astin.  This episode vies with ""Little Brother"" as being the best episode of the series.  While the theme of this story bears some similarities to ""Little Brother,"" it is the execution of the story that makes the story interesting.  The Watchbirds were developed as military technology, and now the government wants to use the Watchbirds for law enforcement (drones, anyone?).  Of course, as tends to happen in many science fiction stories, once someone has power, they always want more power, and the Watchbirds are very powerful, giving whoever controls them what may be the ultimate control over people.  You know that no good will come of this.Anthology science fiction has been done in the past, and done well.  ""The Outer Limits"" has gone through two incarnations, and both incarnations were executed, overall, well.  Yes, both covered standard themes of science fiction, but not every story was political or philosophical, and focused more on the most fundamental tenant of science fiction, ""what if...?""  Many of the stories had an excellent ""shock"" at the end of the story that I still find shocking, or at least surprising, even today.""The Twilight Zone"" also addressed science fiction subjects, selecting stories best addressed by the shorter format of that show.  Once again, while the stories were often political, the messages were often so subtle that by the time you realized there was a political or philosophical message, the story was over and you had already enjoyed it.Sadly, ""The Masters of Science Fiction"" breaks no new ground, and fails to reach anywhere close to the great science fiction anthologies of the past.  The final two episodes, which were not aired during the series initial run on television, were probably the best episodes.  Those two episodes might have garnered an audience that permitted the series to continue.  Instead, the four lesser episodes were aired, likely driving away much of the potential audience.For the right price, and for a person who loves science fiction, this series is worth having, in spite of my often negative comments.  Casual fans of science fiction should pass this one by.Good luck!",3,Some Concepts do not Translate Well to Television,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,7285,"['was', 'great', 'anticipation', 'watched',

1165277,A2CWIYIETNBAK3,B001A7GOCA,Michael Birman,"[1, 4]","As someone old enough to have watched the original Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, two of the earliest of the televised SF anthologies, searching for their successor has been a long and fruitless task. Once limitations in special effects were eliminated with the advent of CG, the literate character driven SF of the past was replaced by special effects for their own sake. What's lost, of course, is the entire point of a science fiction series: the attempt to hold up a mirror to ourselves using the whole universe as the backdrop. These six 45 minute episodes included in a 2 DVD set were part of a short Starz anthology called Masters of Science Fiction. Based on stories penned by the likes of Harlon Ellison, Robert Heinlein and Walter Mosley, the 6 teleplays have a bleakness and edginess appropriate to our times. Their political leanings have been described by other reviewers as 'left-leaning'. To the extent that there is a focus on the absurdity and immorality of war and the need for understanding between sentient species, this is perhaps nominally true. Using quotations from scripture, Christmas carols and Thoreau, peace and kindness are shown as more desirable human traits than their opposites.The quality of these films are quite high, with well-chosen stories brilliantly adapted by superb writers. Directed by the likes of Star Trek alumnus Jonathan Frakes and by Mark Rydell, the acting is equally exemplary. Seeing actors of the caliber of Judy Davis, William Hurt, Sam Waterston and Brian Dennehy in a television anthology is uncommon, to say the least. Their confidence in the material is an indication of its quality. It is reminiscent of the old days when some of the finest actors of the era appeared in the Twilight Zone. If you enjoy science fiction that has a story to tell and a message to deliver, you will enjoy this DVD set.

It never had a chance though. Even the earlier 0's version of the ""twilight zone"" didn't have a chance. Network tv rarely gives sci fi a chance. However Abc did have lost for six great seasons and this one was worth watching. It's a very short series though with only six episodes. The acting is superb in some of these shows too. With john hurt and brian denehy being in the best episode of the bunch 'the discarded"". The last episode is the weakest but it's still a decent sci fi anthology show.

1165280,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B001A7GOCA,Michael R Gates,"[29, 43]","The idea behind MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION is, on the surface, a good one: Draw from some of the best literature of the genre, commission scripts from some of the best screenwriters in the genre, and turn those scripts over to some talented filmmakers.  Good idea, true, but just as with Dr Frankenstein's infamous experiment, the stitching together of these various parts has produced a horrible monster.Instead of delivering thought-provoking, cutting-edge speculative SF or subtle cautionary tales wrapped in the trappings of SF, these ""Masters"" of Science Fiction offer up ham-fisted, blatantly biased socio-political sermons.  What's more, they can't even keep their politics straight, with at least one of the episodes (to wit, ""The Awakening"") preaching the spiritual beliefs of the Religious Right at the same time that it stands on the complete-disarmament soapbox of the ultra-left.  That's a stitched-up wreck of a Frankenstein monster if there ever was one!Now, lest you accuse this reviewer of being politically biased, let me state right now that I am a dyed-in-the wool liberal and actually agree with some of the political stances presented in this show.  But I've also been a fan of SF practically since birth, and I can certainly appreciate a dystopian cautionary tale. Indeed, two of my favorite SF novels are George Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and Ayn Rand's ANTHEM, one of which was written by a disillusioned socialist and the other by a staunch laissez-faire capitalist.  Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that I want to watch a science-fiction TV series where every episode is little more than an anti-American political statement.  And frankly, that's what each of the six episodes of MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION amounts to--40 minutes of ideological propaganda.On the plus side, the technical skills that went into this short-lived series are outstanding.  For example, the performances from the likes of greats like Sam Waterston, Terry O'Quinn, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell, and many others are superb.  Also, the make-up FX for episodes like ""The Discarded,"" a story that centers on a society of genetic mutants, far surpass those of most made-for-TV SF shows.  And the special FX for all the episodes are very well done, with even the nowadays-ubiquitous CGI being used to good effect. Sadly, these positive aspects of the show are too greatly diminished by the in-your-face politics of the writers and directors.The idea behind this series is a good one: Take the best talents from the genre and use them as the foundation for a TV series.  As a matter of fact, the same idea was employed on the earlier series MASTERS OF HORROR, and that show had a successful two-year run on cable and experienced phenomenal DVD sales.  Unfortunately, when the same producers--Mick Garris, Keith Addis, and Ben Browning, to name a few--applied their idea to a science-fiction series, they let their politics get in the way, and the result is merely a batch of 40-minute agitprop films that are poorly disguised in the trappings of SF. It's really no surprise, then, that MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION lasted for a scant six episodes, and it's almost laughable that the creators of this travesty actually expect people to pay for the-- ahem!--""privilege"" of watching it on DVD.",1,Masters of Agitprop,1226275200,"11 10, 2008",2008,3291,"['idea', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'surface', 'good', 'one', 'Draw', 'best', 'literature', 'genre', 'commission', 'scripts', 'best', 'screenwriters', 'genre', 'turn', 'scripts', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'Good', 'idea', 'true', 'just', 'Dr', 'Frankenstein', 'infamous', 'experiment', 'stitching', 'together', 'various', 'parts', 'produced', 'horrible', 'monster.Instead', 'delivering', 'thought-provoking', 'cutting-edge', 'speculative', 'SF', 'subtle', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'wrapped', 'trappings', 'SF', 'Masters', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'offer', 'ham-fisted', 'blatantly', 'biased', 'socio-political', 'sermons', 'What', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'politics', 'straight', 'least', 'one', 'episodes', 'wit', 'Awakening', 'preaching', 'spiritual', 'beliefs', 'Religious', 'Right', 'same', 'time', 'complete-disarmament', 'soapbox', 'ultra-left', 'stitched-up', 'wreck', 'Frankenstein', 'monster', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Now', 'lest', 'accuse', 'reviewer', 'being', 'politically', 'biased', 'let', 'state', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'dyed-in-the', 'wool', 'liberal', 'actually', 'agree', 'political', 'stances', 'presented', 'show', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'fan', 'SF', 'practically', 'birth', 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'dystopian', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'Indeed', 'two', 'favorite', 'SF', 'novels', 'are', 'George', 'Orwell', 'NINETEEN', 'EIGHTY-FOUR', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'ANTHEM', 'one', 'was', 'written', 'disillusioned', 'socialist', 'other', 'staunch', 'laissez-faire', 'capitalist', 'Nonetheless', ""n't"", 'mean', 'want', 'watch', 'science-fiction', 'TV', 'series', 'where', 'episode', 'little', 'more', 'anti-American', 'political', 'statement', 'frankly', 'what', 'six', 'episodes', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', '40', 'minutes', 'ideological', 'propaganda.On', 'plus', 'side', 'technical', 'skills', 'went', 'short-lived', 'series', 'are', 'outstanding', 'example', 'performances', 'likes', 'greats', 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'James', 'Cromwell', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'superb', 'Also', 'make-up', 'FX', 'episodes', 'Discarded', 'story', 'society', 'genetic', 'mutants', 'far', 'surpass', 'most', 'made-for-TV', 'SF', 'shows', 'special', 'FX', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'nowadays-ubiquitous', 'CGI', 'being', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'Sadly', 'positive', 'aspects', 'show', 'are', 'too', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'in-your-face', 'politics', 'writers', 'directors.The', 'idea', 'series', 'good', 'one', 'Take', 'best', 'talents', 'genre', 'use', 'foundation', 'TV', 'series', 'matter', 'fact', 'same', 'idea', 'was', 'employed', 'earlier', 'series', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'HORROR', 'show', 'had', 'successful', 'two-year', 'run', 'cable', 'experienced', 'phenomenal', 'DVD', 'sales', 'Unfortunately', 'when', 'same', 'producers', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'Keith', 'Addis', 'Ben', 'Browning', 'name', 'few', 'applied', 'idea', 'science-fiction', 'series', 'let', 'politics', 'get', 'way', 'result', 'merely', 'batch', '40-minute', 'agitprop', 'films', 'are', 'poorly', 'disguised', 'trappings', 'SF', 'really', 'surprise', 'then', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'SCIENCE', 'FICTION', 'lasted', 'scant', 'six', 'episodes', 'almost', 'laughable', 'creators', 'travesty', 'actually', 'expect', 'people', 'pay', 'ahem', 'privilege', 'watching', 'DVD']",Masters Of Science Fiction

One would do better to just read the thought-provoking short stories on which these eps were ineptly based and spare themselves the annoyance of these poorly executed shows. Those short stories, by the way, were some of the authors' weaker works; ABC probably got them cheap. And does Amazon ever give negative reviews? The first story, Clean Escape wasn't too bad, save the shoddy craftsmanship. Nothing too spectacular after that.Production was hurried and almost amateurish. Actors uncommitted to their parts. Effects and make up were cheesy. It looked like something from the 80's. The futuristic episodes were set in convention centers and stadiums, and the distopian scenes in alleys and factories.

I have since only gone back to catch new episodes of ""Heroes"". So, it's no surprise that the short-lived ""Masters of Science Fiction"" series came and went on ABC without my ever even knowing about it. I was aware of the more popular ""Masters of Horror"" series from Showtime, even though I don't even have Showtime, but then I'm a bit more into the horror genre and love horror anthologies. One thing that puts me off of Sci-Fi anthologies a bit is that they tend to always be about aliens, bleak futures, and robots. Rarely anything else.""Masters of Science Fiction"", in all of its six episodes, doesn't deviate from that, and it also is high on making political and social statements. That's pretty common in sci-fi, but it does get a bit old, especially in a world where the political statements on television are getting as monotonous as the sex. Still, over all, this very ""Outer Limits"" TV series is about as good as can be expected. Some episodes are better than others. Oddly, the two episodes I found to be the most enjoyable are the two that never aired on American television, ""Little Brother"" and ""Watchbird"". Here is a breakdown of the 6, 44-minute episodes you get in this complete series, 2-disc DVD set (with zero extras):""A Clean Escape"" (Story Author: John Kessel, Director: Mark Rydell): A dying doctor's patient cannot remember the past 25 years of his life; 25 years in which the world has been changed greatly as a result of his actions. This one is a little slow and a bit too ""in your face"" with its political statement.""The Awakening"" (Story Author: Howard Fast, Director: Michael Petroni): A strange visitor to Earth brings forth an ultimatum that could cause the leaders of the world to reach an understanding with or completely destroy each other. This second episode is probably even more in your face with the political statement, but it's more exciting than Clean Escape (which probably could have worked better as a 22 minute program). Starting the series with its two most blatantly political episodes was probably not the best idea.""Jerry Was a Man"" (Story Author: Robert A. Heinlein, Director: Michael Tolkin): A more lighthearted episode, this futuristic story presents a bored rich couple who take in some unusual ""pets"". One of them is a man-made humanoid that was marked for destruction. The rich woman who now controls his fate soon becomes determined to defend his rights as a ""human being"". This episode was pretty fun, but could have been better if ""Jerry"" had been more likable. He was rather annoying with his constant requests for candy and cigarettes.""The Discarded"" (Story Author: Harlan Ellison, Director: Jonathan Frakes): An odd collection of diseased freaks exiled from Earth travels through space in search of a new home and is suddenly presented with an offer to return. Yet another I would rather have seen in 22 minutes than 44. This one really drags and I didn't find it that entertaining. Perhaps it's just too much of a downer throughout. Boasts a fine cast though. John Hurt and Brian Dennehy are in this one.""Little Brother"" (Story Author: Walter Mosley, Director: Darnell Martin): A man trying to escape the confines of the lower levels of urban development finds himself on trial for a murder that was clearly not his fault. However, the judge, jury, and executioner of this future world are not human and lack the willingness to weigh the facts fairly. One of the better episodes, in my opinion.""Watchbird"" (Story Author: Robert Sheckley, Director: Harold Becker): A young inventor creates the weapons system of tomorrow in a fleet of mechanical birds designed to take out a killer before he strikes. Things get out of hand though, when the government wants to put the birds, designed for war combat, over the streets of the U.S. to protect the citizens. I found this to be, hands down, the best episode of the series. It's the only one that didn't feel it was dragging at any point. A genuinely good episode.When all is said and done, ""Masters of Science Fiction"" really is about the same as any other sci-fi anthology show.

1165284,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,B001A7GOCA,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[2, 3]","From the concept ofMasters of Horrorcomes Masters of Science Fiction, a six episode television series hosted by Professor Stephen Hawking.  The series focuses on a number of different sci-fi scenarios featuring some of Hollywood's most renowned and gifted actors and directors.A Clean Escape : starring Sam Waterston & Judy Davis, based on the short story by John Kessel - A psychiatrist (Davis) must help a delusional patient (Waterston), suffering from short-term memory loss, recover his lost memories in order to discover the terrifying truth behind the ultimate annihilation.  Fine acting by both leads, but the episode, while revealing its true form little by little at a time, results in a very bleak and unsatisfactory conclusion.The Awakening : starring Terry O'Quinn & Elisabeth Rohn, based on the short story, ""The General Zapped,"" by Howard Fast - It appears to be an alien invasion and time is running out.  Will the United States launch its weapons of mass destruction before it's too late?  This episode is reminiscent of bothV - The Original TV Miniseries(1983) and the big screen theatrical film,Independence Day(1996) only with a decidedly much more different conclusion.Jerry Was A Man : starring Anne Heche & Malcom McDowell, based on the short story by Robert A. Heinlein - The year is 2077.  A wealthy woman (Heche) leases an anthropoid, a genetically created being, from a scientist (McDowell) then legally fights to prove it is a human being with rights and feelings.  This episode is very reminiscent to Steven Spielberg'sA.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)(2001), but also reminded me of the interestingStar Trek The Next Generation - Season Threeepisode, ""The Measure of A Man,"" in its depiction of an artificially created life-form wishing to have the same rights and privileges as a regular human being.  The episode is also much more lighthearted and comical compared to the others.  Very entertaining.The Discarded : starring Brian Dennehy & John Hurt, based on the short story by Harlen Ellison - A discarded group of mutated humans, on an old beat up space vessel orbiting the earth, are given a second chance at freedom when their own blood could be the key to a new cure that can save mankind.  Brian Dennehy is quite good as the cynically skeptical captain, as is John Hurt, who plays the captain's naively open-minded right hand man.  Director Jonathan Frakes, best known for his work on various Star Trek television series and films, delivers a bleak world to us, with good makeup effects, a smooth jazz soundtrack, and decent visuals, but the overall outcome is rather predictable.Little Brother : starring Clifton Collins Jr. & Kimberly Elise, based on the short story, ""Futureland,"" by Walter Mosley - An escapee (Collins Jr.) is charged with the murder of a police officer, plus two others, and must rely on his knowledge of computer system technology in order to prove his innocence.  Intriguing episode, which reminded me a little of Terry Gilliam'sBrazil, with its strict laws of due process.  Clifton Collins Jr. is enjoyable to watch as the quick thinking and wrongfully accused prisoner.  Good episode.Watchbird : starring Sean Astin & James Cromwell, based on the short story by Robert Sheckley - Charlie (Sean Astin) is the inventor of the newly successful Watchbird program, a sophisticated metallic bird with the capabilities to fight and assist in the warring country of Iraq.  Now the US Government and Homeland Security want the device to be used to protect the good citizens on U.S. soil.  But is it capable of such a task?  Anyone who's seenThe Terminatorand its subsequent sequels and TV series (The Sarah Connor Chronicles) will find this episode's story and plotline to be quite familiar, with the idea of machines taking over and deciding on their own what is right and wrong.  Sean Astin, as the  abused inventor, is good in the lead role, as is James Cromwell who plays his boss.  One of the better episodes of the series.This series, which will remind most avid sci-fi fans ofThe Outer Limits (1995)has potential, but is bogged down by too much preachy dialogue and rather depressingly bleak storylines.  A few of these episodes, namely Jerry Was A Man & The Awakening are more positive, but overall the series itself may leave you wishing for a more prosperous and enlightened future.The audio and picture quality are very nice for a TV series such as this.

1165285,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B001A7GOCA,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[1, 1]","Most of the filmed science fiction stories in this collection from the short lived ""Masters of Science Fiction"" series are intriguing enough to be worth watching.  If that sounds like faint praise, it is.  There is nothing here that is a ""must see"" and nothing that I would strongly recommend -- but if you like science fiction, and especially science fiction that wears its political and philosophical message on its sleeve, you could do a lot worse.There are six episodes here, two more than when this aired on television.  Most tell stories about the future, and warn of the dangers and ambiguities of technological development.  All are built around a message, and can be a bit heavy-handed about its delivery, but the stories are entertaining enough (and short enough) that that doesn't detract too much from the appeal.  The production values are fairly strong -- but the special effects and set pieces don't always work together to create a believable world.  Many of the worlds presented in the series seemed neat but not really ""lived in.""There are a few standouts here, that really did work well, and whose aesthetics matched perfectly with the story and the message: ""The Discarded,"" was probably the best, presenting the plight of mutated misfits exiled from Earth on an aging and ill-equipped vessel, with a standout performance by John Hurt as a disappointed idealist with an extra head on his shoulders; Michael Tolkin directed the amusing and intriguing ""Jerry Was a Man,"" that worked because of the satirical social comedy that played as the backdrop of the more explicitly science fiction message.There is lots to like about this series -- the films mostly look good, the acting is strong and they hired great people who performed their roles as well as they could be.  I think what killed it for me a bit was that they designed it to be too similar to the science fiction of an era when to play fantasy on television you needed to deliver a message, there needed to be a moral of the story -- otherwise it wasn't ""serious"" fiction, it was a mere diversion.  The kind of science fiction I read and the kinds of science fiction films I enjoy have moved beyond that to where they don't need to apologize for being ""unreal"" and focus on telling compelling stories whose messages can't be summed up by a robotic voice (Stephen Hawking narrates) over the credits.",3,"A bit heavy-handed, but mostly diverting collection of short science fiction stories",1220313600,"09 2, 2008",2008,2376,"['Most', 'filmed', 'science', 'fiction', 'stories', 'collection', 'short', 'lived', 'Masters', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'series', 'are', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'be', 'worth', 'watching', 'faint', 'praise', 'nothing', 'here', 'must', 'see', 'nothing', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'like', 'science', 'fiction', 'especially', 'science', 'fiction', 'political', 'philosophical', 'message', 'sleeve', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'are', 'six', 'episodes', 'here', 'two', 'more', 'when', 'aired', 'television', 'Most', 'tell', 'stories', 'future', 'warn', 'dangers', 'ambiguities', 'technological', 'development', 'are', 'built', 'message', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'delivery', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'short', 'enough', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'appeal', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'fairly', 'strong', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'pieces', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'together', 'create', 'believable', 'world', 'Many', 'worlds', 'presented', 'series', 'seemed', 'neat', 'not', 'really', 'lived', 'are', 'few', 'standouts', 'here', 'really', 'did', 'work', 'well', 'aesthetics', 'matched', 'perfectly', 'story', 'message', 'Discarded', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'presenting', 'plight', 'mutated', 'misfits', 'exiled', 'Earth', 'aging', 'ill-equipped', 'vessel', 'standout', 'performance', 'John', 'Hurt', 'disappointed', 'idealist', 'extra', 'head', 'shoulders', 'Michael', 'Tolkin', 'directed', 'amusing', 'intriguing', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'Man', 'worked', 'satirical', 'social', 'comedy', 'played', 'backdrop', 'more', 'explicitly', 'science', 'fiction', 'lots', 'like', 'series', 'films', 'mostly', 'look', 'good', 'acting', 'strong', 'hired', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'performed', 'roles', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'think', 'what', 'killed', 'bit', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'too', 'similar', 'science', 'fiction', 'era', 'when', 'play', 'fantasy', 'television', 'needed', 'deliver', 'message', 'needed', 'be', 'moral', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'serious', 'fiction', 'was', 'mere', 'diversion', 'kind', 'science', 'fiction', 'read', 'kinds', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'enjoy', 'have', 'moved', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'apologize', 'being', 'unreal', 'focus', 'telling', 'compelling', 'stories', 'messages', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'robotic', 'voice', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'narrates', 'credits']",Masters Of Science Fiction

Other episodes are intellectually stimulating but fall into the view once and done category.  The performances throughout the episodes by the likes of Malcolm McDowell and Judy Davis run the gamut from exceptional to exceptionaly appropriate.  Terry O'Quinn of Millennium and Lost has terrific turn here in his episode.

The closest to a positive ending was in ""Little Brother""where the hero becomes part of the controlling computer in a black onblack society.I really wish with all the great acting in these showsI could give this a better review, but I can't:it isn't representative of the best sci fi!",3,Universally negative sci fi,1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,708,"['Had', 'series', 'been', 'less', 'negative', 'maybe', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'future', 'might', 'have', 'lasted', 'longer', 'Science', 'fictions', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'predicting', 'grim', 'orhopeless', 'futures', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'science', 'fiction', 'andthose', 'who', 'write', 'have', 'admit', 'pessimism', 'replacedall', 'space', 'operas', 'Bradbury', 'effect', 'blue', 'gray', 'futuresseems', 'have', 'taken', 'hold', 'literary', 'approach', 'sci', 'fiin', 'movies', 'TV', 'closest', 'positive', 'ending', 'was', 'Little', 'Brother', 'where', 'hero', 'part', 'controlling', 'computer', 'black', 'onblack', 'society.I', 'really', 'wish', 'great', 'acting', 'showsI', 'could', 'give', 'better', 'review', 'ca', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'representative', 'best', 'sci', 'fi']",Masters Of Science Fiction
1165293,A1K94LXX833JTT,B001A7GOCA,Sanpete,"[28, 30]","Masters of Science Fiction was a series produced for ABC that sought to capture some of the magic of The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits.  Of the six one-hour episodes made (under 45 minutes without the ads), all included here, only four were shown.  The series was arguably not given a chance, as it was aired on Saturday nights in August, not a great time slot.Some of the concepts are interesting and promising, and there are some top-notch actors, but I still didn't enjoy these much.  On the whole the writing is superficial, the logic weak, and the atmospherics that might make up for that are only so-so.  I only enjoyed one of the six episodes enough to say I liked it.The first episode has a nice basic idea to work with, revealed bit by bit in a way that makes much description of the plot too much of a spoiler.  Judy Davis plays a psychotherapist who has a patient (Sam Waterston) with a condition she is very anxious to cure, for reasons that are only made clear later.  Sadly, some of it doesn't quite add up or is only tenuously credible, and the exposition is clumsy.  I thought Waterston seemed oddly hammy and fake, though maybe he thought that suited the character.  Davis has a compelling screen presence.The second episode takes place in the very near future.  Alien creatures appear on earth and (without giving too much away) do stuff that it seems they should have done long before.  The way this happens is fairly arbitrary.  I liked Terry O'Quinn in this episode, in a measured performance that brought some subtlety of character at least.Both the first two episodes, and most of the others too, fail to be very subtle about the rather simplistic principles we're supposed to draw from them.The episode I enjoyed is the third one, ""Jerry Was a Man,"" based on a short story by Robert Heinlein.  Part of the enjoyment was sheer comic relief from the first two episodes, both rather Serious and a bit preachy.  This is the only one of the six that's primarily comedic, though serious ideas are dealt with.  Jerry is a genetically engineered android who was originally designed to sweep minefields (in about the least efficient way possible), but who has been working as a janitor lately and is about to be turned into puppy chow.  A very wealthy woman (Anne Heche) takes a fancy to him and undertakes to save him, eventually by trying to prove he's a human.  The intriguing tag line that is spoken by Stephen Hawking at the end is, ""What makes us human may one day be defined not by the gifts we possess but by the virtues we lack.""  Malcolm McDowell is particularly good as the genetic engineer.Series host Stephen Hawking, by the way, has very little to do in this series.  He says a line at the beginning and end of each piece.  The lines generally don't quite work like Rod Serling's comments for The Twilight Zone.  I doubt very much that Hawking wrote them.Episode 4 concerns a group of people rejected from Earth because of various unpleasant mutations and sent to wander the solar system in search of a home.  They're approached by a representative from Earth with a deal to take them back.  The drama is fairly thin and the results are highly predictable.  John Hurt and Brian Dennehy are fine, and the make-up artists had a great time with the mutations, including a fairly well done second, smaller head on John Hurt.  There are a couple surprisingly if still only mildly brutal touches in that episode.The fifth episode is similar in several ways to Robocop, but with small eagle-like flying ""Watchbirds"" as the peacekeeping machines, and a kind of wireless human-machine interface instead of flesh and machine joined directly.  The machines start off well and then problems come up as they're tied up in politics.  It lacks Robcop's high-powered action and is only briefly and mildly violent.  It also lacks the clever, polished script.  The acting is fairly good.  This one is the second best of the group for me.The final episode has elements of 1984, done in a pale Terry Gilliam (Brazil) style.  An underground worker escapes, is accused of murder, and fights with his mind against a partly human machine that constitutes his judge, defense counsel, and jury.  The things that cause trouble for the machine are so elementary as to lack much credibility or interest, and the ending is sheer Hollywood.The production values for the series are on the high side of what would be expected for a TV series.  With all of the episodes, there are some interesting or enjoyable points.  I can see why some people enjoyed them.  But viewers inclined to be picky or critical about their science fiction should probably look elsewhere.",3,"Not masterful, but will have appeal for some",1220572800,"09 5,

It was a spin off of Masters of Horror, a show on a channel I don't get and has the same premise of taking a short story from well respected writers in the genre and turn them into a short film that fits into an hour of television. The DVD set features two episodes that never made it to air.The cast is decent with John Hurt (Hellboy), John Locke (Lost), Sean Astin (Rudy), Sam Waterston (Law and Order), Brian Dennehy (Romeo + Juliet), Anne Heche (Six Days and Seven Nights), Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), and James Denton (Desperate Housewives).  Only Little Brother lacks a decent marquee name.  But the real star of the entire series is Steven Hawking who narrates each episode with an intro and outro of them all giving us life lesson of what we should have learned from them.The stories themselves are your run of the mill Sci-fi stories like living underground in a post-apocalyptic state, the guy whose memory is wiped clean ever hour, the alien visitors, a robot that can feel, mutants that are discarded into outer space, a Big Brother type society, and machines that get too smart.  Most of stories take them too seriously for their own good and only Jerry Was a Man is the only one with a sense of humor about it.But each stories is at the very least watchable, but only hardcore Science Fiction buff would want to add the DVD, which comes with zero extras, to the library.

Slow, heavy-handed social propaganda dominate the series.  The irony is that the last two episodes, which were unaired, are actually pretty good.  Considering the strong cast of actors, I expected much more.  One of my favorite authors is Robert Sheckley.  His story Watchbird was the sixth and last and is the best of the series.  It compares favorably to an episode of the original Outer Limits, which added a subtle moral message to the science fiction.  And who can object to the message of The Day the Earth Stood Still (origianl film)?  The Masters of Science Fiction series mostly forgot the science fiction.  It was a good idea gone terribly wrong.

Logue ""If you can't win, change the r...","[3, 5]","This is a set of six shows from the Masters of Science Fiction series, so titled because each story is taken from a classic science fiction author.  The stories themselves have been updated a bit for modern times, which is probably a good thing as it keeps them relevant and, more importantly, makes them seem more like they are set in current times instead of the 60s when many of these stories were originally written.They do share a 60s style about them, though, in that they are written more like talky stage plays, and are therefore very dialog-heavy.  The actors in it are first-rate, and they are matched very well to the stories.  Anne Heche, for example, can sometimes come across on screen as somewhat unemotional, but here she plays a wealthy woman and the character really fits with her strengths.The stories can get a little preachy, but that is also a hallmark of the 60s classics, and flowed naturally from the material without seeming forced.  Think Rod Serling when he comments at the end of a Twilight Zone episode and you've got the gist of it.Two of the six episodes in this collection were never shown, so even if you managed to catch these in their summer 2007 run, there are two new ones you haven't seen.Overall, the set is a good rendition of the way science fiction used to be made ""in the good old days,"" but with better production values.  If you find yourself wishing there was something better on TV than yet another reality show, you may want to give this set a try.Sean P.

1165297,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B001A7GOCA,Serene Night,"[1, 3]","This is a compilation of 6 episodes from the first and only season of Masters of Science Fiction. There are 6 episodes of this show on two DVD's. I found the episodes of variable interest, some stories resonated more with me than others. Overall 5/6 of these episodes feature dark subject matter in a bleak future where humanity, despite its best intentions goes horribly wrong in some way.****Warning: Reviews/Synopsis may contain spoilers.***The EscapeA man with mental illness with amnesiac symptoms consults an unsympathetic psychiatrist who tries to shake him free of his memory lapses. As the psychiatrist begins to run out of time to treat her patient, she begins to use more extreme measures to cure him of his condition. Is  everything truly what it seems, or is something sinister going on? 2/5 starI found this episode to be somewhat tedious, and considering this is the first episode,  I worried this didn't bode well. I didn't like the psychiatrist character that much. She came off as cruel and jaded. Granted, she had her reasons, (which are revealed) but she was difficult to like.  There was too much sitting around talking as Havelmann struggles to remember. The twist at the ending I was only meh about. I was more interested in the people and how they lived than in the situation  they were in, than the struggle between doctor and patient which I was only lukewarm about. To me the therapist came off as vengeful rather than... Therapeutic.  2/5 stars.The AwakeningA downed chopper in Iraq is the scene of the opening for this second episode. As two soldiers... An American and an Iraqi discover they can communicate and encounter an alien cocoon. When they are eventually rescued they are discovered comatose and  are taken back ot base, where Alien expert Terry Quinn is called in to investigateI liked this episode much better than the first. Mostly because I liked the characters more, and there was a wee bit more action. Terry (of Lost fame), is a great actor, and I was intrigued by the aliens. But I lost enjoyment with the rather heavy message, which despite being a good one, was about as subtle as a kick in the face. Meh... . 3/5 stars.Jerry Was a ManIn the future humanoid robots are used to as disposable labor for a jaded group of elite. When a spoiled rich woman grows attached to a cyborg named Jerry, she goes to great lengths to free him from becoming puppy chow.I liked this one the best of the first 3 episodes. It was humorous and light-hearted and the acting was great. (Anne Heche as Martha Von Vogel) (Malcolm McDowell as Tibor Cargrew). I also thought the CGI for the elephant was adorable. Unlike the first 2 the subject of Nuclear War was not mentioned. Thank Heavens.  5/5The DiscardedThis short opens on a spaceship where a group of horribly mutated humans are living in poor conditions. After a delegation from earth makes an offer these outcasts cant refuse will it prove to be too good to be true?This was a well thought out short story by Harlen Ellison. The characters were interesting, and I particularly enjoyed the wedding and I especially liked  Bedzyk. I would like to see more set in this universe, particularly what was going on on earth. On the flip side, the subject matter was a bit bleak. (A society of outcasts who are used and discarded like old toys). I wanted these people to have a happy ending. I guess not. 4/5Little BrotherA man escapes a work camp in a bid for freedom. Instead he finds himself behind bars and tried for murder. Can he triumph over the justice system ran by computers?I enjoyed this episode. The main character was sympathetic, and the idea of a computer judge and jury was intriguing. Negatives? I was a bit surprised that the 'judge' was so easily discombobulated. Surely this can't be the first intelligent criminal to hit its court. 4/5WatchbirdsA scientist designs a robotic bird for military purposes. When greedy developers insist he use the bird to patrol domestically, the designer resists, will the watchbirds be the latest victim in the government's bid for power?I think this was my favorite episode on disk 2.

1165298,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B001A7GOCA,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[4, 6]","This short-lived series had a lot going for it, in theory, even though there is nothing about the title of the series that is intriguing. Each episode is 'hosted' by Stephen Hawking.. but you don't really see him w/ the exception of a very quick slide/drive-by of a still image during the opening credits. His voice - or rather the familiar voice of his computer comments at the intro and outro of each episode.Like the dark series, Night Gallery and its sometimes 'lighter,' older cousin, ""The Twilight Zone,"" - the episodes are non-contiguous. This is a series of individual shows that are not connected to each other. What they have in common is that they are star-studded, well written, well-acted and they all involve sci-fi.Even though they are well written, I must say there wasn't an episode that blew me away in originality, though. They seemed like re-hashed stories, if not a hodgepodge of two or more plots from other sci-fi movies/shows I've seen over the years.In ""The Awakening,"" genderless beings come to earth to force an ultimatum that the various countries stand down militarily. Very reminiscent of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" ... albeit with its own unique twist - no Gort and it's hinted that the aliens may indeed be angelic.In the episode, ""Jerry Was a Man,"" a ""Joe,"" a genetically altered human and plastic creation has someone attempt to 'defend' him in his right to be man and for his personhood. This is very reminiscent of the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode, ""The Offspring,"" in which man-made character/android, Data has his rights challenged as to whether he is an officer in Starfleet or merely their property. I did love the miniature elephant, though... I definitely want one of those as soon as they become available.""The Discarded"" was highly reminiscent of both the movie ""Total Recall"" and episodes featuring the Vidiians that harvest organs to stave off the disease that is mutating their people.""Little Brother"" reminds me of a combination of a few Star Trek episodes where Kirk befuddles a computer and ""Logan's Run.""I could go on for quite a bit, and in detail, how these shows remind me of other stories I've already seen, but the episodes are highly enjoyable in their own right. And, as stated earlier, they are very well acted. They obviously had a generous budget for the special effects - at no time are you thinking anything is cheesy as far as acting or CGI.The DVD loses a star due to the forced trailers when you pop the disc in. When you own a DVD, you should not be forced to watch 10 minutes of trailers each time you insert the disc. When I popped in the disc for the first time - there was no intro telling me this was a trailer and I couldn't get to the menu. I wasn't even sure what was going on at first, because the trailer was for a very campy apocalyptic movie from the 1970s (replete with Elvis sideburns and giant afros) that lasted FOREVER, then it was followed by an equally lengthy and cheesy 1970s trailer, then a trailer for an animated character named ""Chode."" Finally, after about 10 minutes, you get access to a menu. Subtitles are an option, and you can watch just one episode or the whole disc.This is a 2-disc set in decent packaging. The series loses another couple of stars because of the liberal political bent in every episode. I can usually blow off the political underpinnings of various shows I watch - they're products of Hollywood and I expect to be preached to by the Liberal left at every opportunity - but the bent was so obvious in each episode, it induced eye-rolling. Not a good way to start your viewing experience or anticipate the sci-fi within. It would be entirely possible to write these stories in a way that was not so biased and judgmental without losing the impact of the sci-fi story at hand - but clearly that was not the choice of the directors and writers. By golly, you're gonna like it, if we've gotta shove this down your throats!I don't mind if the story engages my thought processes to the point where my thinking leans left - but I don't care to be preached to when I am only wanting to enjoy some sci-fi.Two stars are easily won by the superb special effects and make-up. The re-hashed preachfests, however - plus forced trailers at the beginning knock off 3 stars.",2,Night Gallery meets The Outer Limits,1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,4291,"['short-lived', 'series', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'theory', 'even', 'nothing', 'title', 'series', 'intriguing', 'episode', ""'hosted"", 'Stephen', 'Hawking..', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'w/', 'exception', 'very', 'quick', 'slide/drive-by', 'still', 'image', 'opening', 'credits', 'voice', 'rather', 'familiar', 'voice', 'computer', 'comments', 'intro', 'outro', 'dark', 'series', 'Night', 'Gallery', 'sometimes', ""'lighter"", 'older', 'cousin', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'episodes', 'are', 'non-contiguous', 'series', 'individual', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'connected', 'other', 'What', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'star-studded', 'well', 'written', 'well-acted', 'involve', 'sci-fi.Even', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'must', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'episode', 'blew', 'away', 'originality', 'though', 'seemed', 're-hashed', 'stories', 'not', 'hodgepodge', 'two', 'more', 'plots', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'movies/shows', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years.In', 'Awakening', 'genderless', 'beings', 'come', 'earth', 'force', 'ultimatum', 'various', 'countries', 'stand', 'down', 'militarily', 'Very', 'reminiscent', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'own', 'unique', 'twist', 'Gort', 'hinted', 'aliens', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'episode', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'Man', 'Joe', 'genetically', 'altered', 'human', 'plastic', 'creation', 'someone', 'attempt', ""'defend"", 'right', 'be', 'man', 'personhood', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'episode', 'Offspring', 'man-made', 'character/android', 'Data', 'rights', 'challenged', 'officer', 'Starfleet', 'merely', 'property', 'did', 'love', 'miniature', 'elephant', 'definitely', 'want', 'one', 'as', 'soon', 'become', 'available', 'Discarded', 'was', 'highly', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'Total', 'Recall', 'featuring', 'Vidiians', 'harvest', 'organs', 'stave', 'off', 'disease', 'mutating', 'people', 'Little', 'Brother', 'combination', 'few', 'Star', 'Trek', 'where', 'Kirk', 'computer', 'Logan', 'Run', 'could', 'go', 'quite', 'bit', 'detail', 'how', 'shows', 'remind', 'other', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'episodes', 'are', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'right', 'stated', 'earlier', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'obviously', 'had', 'generous', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'time', 'are', 'thinking', 'anything', 'cheesy', 'as', 'far', 'acting', 'CGI.The', 'DVD', 'star', 'due', 'forced', 'trailers', 'when', 'pop', 'disc', 'When', 'own', 'DVD', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', '10', 'minutes', 'trailers', 'time', 'insert', 'disc', 'When', 'popped', 'disc', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'intro', 'telling', 'was', 'trailer', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'menu', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'first', 'trailer', 'was', 'very', 'campy', 'apocalyptic', 'movie', '1970s', 'replete', 'Elvis', 'sideburns', 'giant', 'afros', 'lasted', 'FOREVER', 'then', 'was', 'followed', 'equally', 'lengthy', 'cheesy', '1970s', 'trailer', 'then', 'trailer', 'animated', 'character', 'named', 'Chode', 'Finally', '10', 'minutes', 'get', 'access', 'menu', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'option', 'can', 'watch', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'whole', 'disc.This', '2-disc', 'set', 'decent', 'packaging', 'series', 'couple', 'stars', 'liberal', 'political', 'bent', 'episode', 'can', 'usually', 'blow', 'off', 'political', 'underpinnings', 'various', 'shows', 'watch', ""'re"", 'products', 'Hollywood', 'expect', 'be', 'preached', 'Liberal', 'left', 'opportunity', 'bent', 'was', 'so', 'obvious', 'episode', 'induced', 'eye-rolling', 'Not', 'good', 'way', 'start', 'viewing', 'experience', 'anticipate', 'sci-fi', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'possible', 'write', 'stories', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'biased', 'judgmental', 'losing', 'impact', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'hand', 'clearly', 'was', 'not', 'choice', 'directors', 'writers', 'golly', ""'re"", 'gon', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'shove', 'down', 'throats', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'story', 'thought', 'processes', 'point', 'where', 'thinking', 'left', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'be', 'preached', 'when', 'am', 'only', 'wanting', 'enjoy', 'sci-fi.Two', 'stars', 'are', 'easily', 'won', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 're-hashed', 'preachfests', 'however', 'forced', 'trailers', 'beginning', 'knock', 'off', '3', 'stars']",Masters Of Science Fiction

I sat down to view ""Masters of Science Fiction, The Complete Series,"" with some apprehension.  However, I have to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the episodes.First of all, I found some very well know people starring in this such as, Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, Sean Astin and others, that was good and added a lot to the viewing.As I watched each espisode I found I certainly enjoyed them.  They dealt with war, humanity, and even the Angelic, which was definitely my favorite. These stories have a flare like those of The Twilight Zone, or Outer Limits, but with more of a 'this could happen,' feeling as you watched them. That did add to the weird feeling that filled the room, which I believe is suppose to be part of the experience, right? In conclusion let me say this.

1165302,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B001A7GOCA,Terry Sunday,"[0, 0]","I don't have much to say one way or the other about the ""Masters of Science Fiction"" DVD set. It's neither exceptionally good nor unbearably bad. At worst, it's a decent way to kill a few hours, especially if you did not catch the ""acclaimed"" series when it aired on network television (I didn't). At best, it's an interesting example of what can result when world-class screenwriters, directors and actors get together to visually interpret well-known science fiction short stories written by masters of the craft, such as Harlan Ellison, Robert A. Heinlein and Robert Sheckley. The six segments in this anthology (two of which did not air in the original series) are not remarkable by any means. Nor are the acting, special effects and production values anything special. I found the whole thing to be just so-so. I'm glad I had a chance to see the shows, and I may re-watch some of them from time to time, but on the whole I was underwhelmed.I think much of my lukewarm reaction to this DVD set stems from the mediocre authors' works selected. Specifically, I'm very disappointed in the choice of Robert A. Heinlein's ""Jerry Was a Man"" as the Grand Master's story for this series. In my opinion, virtually ANY other Heinlein short story would have been a stronger, better choice. I can rattle off a long list of MUCH better stories without even consulting my library, classics such as, for example, ""By His Bootstraps,"" ""Goldfish Bowl,"" ""And He Built a Crooked House,"" ""Project Nightmare,"" ""The Long Watch,"" ""Year of the Jackpot"" and ""Sky Lift,"" to name just a few. I can't imagine why the producers of this series picked the relative stinker ""Jerry Was a Man.""Full-length movies of Heinlein's novels have not been conspicuously successful. Consider, for instance, ""The Puppet Masters,"" which was second-rate on many levels, and the truly execrable ""Starship Troopers,"" an embarrassingly inept, relentlessly depressing gorefest that should not even share the name of Heinlein's masterful novel. ""Jerry Was a Man"" continues the tradition of poor adaptations of Heinlein's stories. In this case, the original story wasn't even that good.

Dick and Ray Bradbury and I grew up watching reruns of the original Star Trek. I knew I would enjoy watching Masters of Science Fiction, and after finishing all 6 episodes, it's clear this show was truly ahead of its time, and was cancelled far too quickly.There was no better host for this series than Professor Stephen Hawking - his episode introduction and coda kept my eyes riveted to the screen. I felt very humbled to watch a show he was involved in - It was like getting a personalized greeting from Alfred Hitchcock before starting a horror film anthology.Each of the six stories in this collection does exactly what great science fiction is supposed to do - it opens our minds to enjoy stories outside the norm, and takes us to places that exist outside of our own imaginations. Some of these stories may seem reminiscent of certain Twilight Zone episodes, but they stand on their own and offer us an escape from the humdrum of everyday life into the world of the fantastic - the futuristic - and the unknown.The episodes aren't heavy-laden with special effects, the scripting makes each story believable, and the actors & actresses make the entertainment enjoyable. These stories also offer a wide range of emotions to their viewers. I was driven to near tears at ""A Clean Escape"", I found myself chuckling at ""Jerry Was A Man"", and I found myself watching ""The Discarded"" more than once because of John Hurt's stellar performance as Samswope, to name but a few.I knew I made the right decision when I picked ""Play All"" from the DVD menu, because I simply couldn't stop watching.

1165305,A2NC9G399V3UF0,B001A7GOCA,"Tim Lasiuta ""Comic Fan 42""","[8, 16]","News and rumours of the excellence of ""Masters of Science Fiction"" had been rampant.  Throughout the media, praise was unanimous for  this series.  Having watched an episode with my wife, I caught disjointed bits and pieces that left me wondering.With the release of the series due out August 5th, 2008, Anchor Bay is about to shatter the world of TV. TV screens today are filled with reality shows, crime detection masterpieces, family comedies with insipid role models, and cartoons of questionable quality.  ""Masters"" surely changed that.  Watching the series in sequence (6 episodes-2 unaired) you get the feeling that intelligence has once again become fashionable on TV.Based on classic speculative fiction by Harlan Ellison, Robert Sheckey, Robert Heinlin, John Kessel, Howard Fast, and Sam Egan, ""Masters"" revisits the arena left vacant for so long by the departure of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"".  Not only did the producers select strong stories, but also a stellar cast that includes John Hurt, Terry O'Quinn, Sam Waterston, James Denton, Brian Dennehy, Anne Heche, and Sean Astin.  Directors Jonathan Frakes, Michale Petroni,  and Harold Becker  conduct a philosophic discussion of what might be.To say this series is intelligent and overdue is an understatement.  The six episodes are  ""the Awakening"", ""A Clean Escape"", ""The Discarded"", ""Jerry Was A Man"", ""Little Brother"", and ""Watchbird.""  The episodes ooze style, class, and an approach to production not seen since the Indy Chronicles.  Which one stands out the most?  ""Little Brother"" is stunning.  Walter Mosley's short story about a time when automated justice dispensed by absorbed personalities is  commonplace is frightening.  Fredon is accused of murdering two policemen and a young child, but found innocent after he proves the policemen lied, causing a breakdown in the system.  The truth was too much to handle.  Clifton Collins Jrs' portrayal of Fredon is bang on for a man doomed to die, yet refusing to die without causing change.  ""The Discarded"", based on an Ellison novella, is the ultimate story of minorities and diseased floating adrift in space, waiting for a chance to go home to earth one last time.  When hope arrives bearing a promise to take them home, the merest chance is too much to take.  Hope turns to disappointment as faith is replaced by desperation as the army uses them to save themselves, then returns with more discards.  Concepts like genomic mutations, prejudice, and hope are examined in this visually disturbing portrayal of nazi-like death camps of the future.  William Hurt and Brian Dennehy are remarkable in their roles.A very interesting addition to the series is that of Professor Stephen Hawking as narrator.  Just like Rod Serling before him was the voice of futuristic fantasy, Hawking has become the voice of the scientific future.We can only hope that this series continues to bring anthologic intelligence to our TV screens once more.  The world of science fiction needs more Masters.Tim Lasiuta[...]",5,Masters....is the ONLY word possible,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3028,"['News', 'rumours', 'excellence', 'Masters', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'had', 'been', 'rampant', 'media', 'praise', 'was', 'unanimous', 'series', 'Having', 'watched', 'episode', 'wife', 'caught', 'disjointed', 'bits', 'pieces', 'left', 'release', 'series', 'due', 'August', '5th', '2008', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'shatter', 'world', 'TV', 'TV', 'screens', 'today', 'are', 'filled', 'reality', 'shows', 'crime', 'detection', 'masterpieces', 'family', 'comedies', 'insipid', 'role', 'models', 'cartoons', 'questionable', 'quality', 'Masters', 'surely', 'changed', 'Watching', 'series', 'sequence', '6', 'episodes-2', 'unaired', 'get', 'feeling', 'intelligence', 'once', 'again', 'become', 'fashionable', 'TV.Based', 'classic', 'speculative', 'fiction', 'Harlan', 'Ellison', 'Robert', 'Sheckey', 'Robert', 'Heinlin', 'John', 'Kessel', 'Howard', 'Fast', 'Sam', 'Egan', 'Masters', 'arena', 'left', 'vacant', 'so', 'long', 'departure', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'producers', 'select', 'strong', 'stories', 'also', 'stellar', 'cast', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'Sam', 'Waterston', 'James', 'Denton', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'Anne', 'Heche', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Directors', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'Michale', 'Petroni', 'Harold', 'Becker', 'conduct', 'philosophic', 'discussion', 'what', 'might', 'be.To', 'say', 'series', 'intelligent', 'overdue', 'understatement', 'six', 'episodes', 'are', 'Awakening', 'Clean', 'Escape', 'Discarded', 'Jerry', 'Was', 'A', 'Man', 'Little', 'Brother', 'Watchbird', 'episodes', 'ooze', 'style', 'class', 'approach', 'production', 'not', 'seen', 'Indy', 'Chronicles', 'Which', 'one', 'out', 'most', 'Little', 'Brother', 'stunning', 'Walter', 'Mosley', 'short', 'story', 'time', 'when', 'automated', 'justice', 'dispensed', 'absorbed', 'personalities', 'commonplace', 'frightening', 'Fredon', 'accused', 'murdering', 'two', 'policemen', 'young', 'child', 'found', 'innocent', 'policemen', 'lied', 'causing', 'breakdown', 'system', 'truth', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'Clifton', 'Collins', 'Jrs', 'portrayal', 'Fredon', 'bang', 'man', 'doomed', 'die', 'yet', 'refusing', 'die', 'causing', 'change', 'Discarded', 'based', 'Ellison', 'novella', 'ultimate', 'story', 'minorities', 'diseased', 'floating', 'adrift', 'space', 'waiting', 'chance', 'go', 'home', 'earth', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'When', 'hope', 'bearing', 'promise', 'take', 'home', 'merest', 'chance', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'Hope', 'disappointment', 'faith', 'replaced', 'desperation', 'army', 'save', 'then', 'more', 'discards', 'Concepts', 'genomic', 'mutations', 'prejudice', 'hope', 'are', 'examined', 'visually', 'disturbing', 'portrayal', 'nazi-like', 'death', 'camps', 'future', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'are', 'remarkable', 'roles.A', 'very', 'interesting', 'addition', 'series', 'Professor', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'narrator', 'Just', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'was', 'voice', 'futuristic', 'fantasy', 'Hawking', 'become', 'voice', 'scientific', 'future.We', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'series', 'bring', 'anthologic', 'intelligence', 'TV', 'screens', 'once', 'more', 'world', 'science', 'fiction', 'more', 'Masters.Tim', 'Lasiuta', '[', ']']",Masters Of Science Fiction

I would only call about half of the writers Masters, but they were all pretty good.There have been several attempts to compare this short series to previous series; I would offer Tales of Tomorrow from the 50s for a style comparison. They are dialog driven and settings are for the most part limited to a few locations.The episodes in my order of preference are: The Discarded, Jerry was a Man, Watchbird, A Clean Escape, The Awakening, Little Brother.John Hurt and Brian Dennehy give stand out performances in the Discarded and this is easily the best of the lot. Harlan Ellison made a cameo, but it's hard to spot.Jerry was a Man is one of Robert Heinlein's early short stories from the 40s. It has been heavily modified from the original. They played it broad, and it's the lightest in tone.Watchbirds looses a little of the famous Sheckley sense of irony in the retelling, but it's a good little episode.Clean Escape suffered from slow pacing. About 10-15 minutes trim towards the middle would have been an improvement.The Awakening was written by Howard Fast, better known for his novel Spartacus, and problems during the McCarthy era.

As a Reuters reviewer put it, this is what you call ""burying a show deep within the bowels of television Siberia.""  A network doesn't do this to a show it wants to promote or have on the air.
