One man is found on the train, there is a fight, and he is thrown off. One ""sharp business man"" is very interested in these gold shipments. (Gold is untraceable.) Edward Pierce plans to steal the gold shipment and makes meticulous plans to steal and copy the four keys to the safe. This film shows the ""ratting"" sport, and people riding horses. It shows how each key is found and copied by different ruses. Mid 19th century London was recreated as the background. ""All everybody thinks about is money."" There is a security leak and new precautions are taken. Edward Pierce has a way to defeat those plans. ""Social engineering"" has a long history.This film shows how this theft is accomplished. There is a glitch (no plan is perfect) but it is overcome. Yet there is a final slip-up. The judge sentences Pierce. But one last trick trumps justice at the end.

His sidekick, Ager, is not so convincing, but Connery carries the team single-handedly. His crafty lover, played by Downs, brings nothing new to a role that we've seen overplayed in too many suspense and action films.My main criticism of this movie is the obsession with highly explicit sexual imagery interwoven throughout the film, which leaves one wondering how in the world it merited a PG rating. I expected to see a fun and witty action movie, and The Great Train Robbery is definitely that, but whoever decided to add the sexual elements made a bad call.

136453,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792835093,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 12/10Rate: 612/10: Having read the book by Michael Crichton, The Great Train Robbery was a fairly interesting picture to watch but stopped short of being a good one. Easily, the best feature about it was the Victorian England look, and it was the big reason for my sustained interest to the end. However, I thought the book was just much better and more entertaining to read. Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland weren't too bad themselves. I enjoyed their presence. I thought it was keen to watch how the impressions of the keys were waxed in, and I finally figured out what the word ""snakeman"" meant. Probably the most amazing scene had to be the one where Sean Connery was atop of a moving train. That was breathtakingly real, and he did it himself. Also, another amazing scene was where Wayne Sleep, playing as Clean Willy, did the actual stunts, especially that frightening scaling of the huge vertical wall of Newgate Prison. Watch it again, and you will be surprised how awesome that scene was. I have to question another scene where the snakeman will climb through the hole of a room where the two keys are located and then opening the door for the waxman because I think it would have been so much easier if the latter taught the former how to make impressions in wax rather than doing the long and hard way. Anyway, I felt the movie was a bit banal to watch because of the need to get the four keys. Ultimately later, Mission: Impossible with Tom Cruise rendered The Great Train Robbery outdated when it came to the premise and most especially of the train stunt in the end. Of course, from the book, I was thinking about that moment of the safety coffin fastened with a bell, and I was surprised that it eventually made to the film (probably for the first time ever). A lot of people may not understand that scene very well because it was well explained in the book. Basically, during the 18th and 19th century due to cholera outbreak, there was a fear of people being buried alive, so when inside of a coffin, they would ring the bell to notify others. Of course, the whole thing is impossible to believe because it never happens. So, that's superstition to you. Still, it is interesting nevertheless. All in all, The Great Train Robbery wasn't that bad of a film, still worth watching.",3,Wasn't That Bad at All.

136456,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,0792835093,Craig Connell,"[2, 2]","Wow, this is a wonderfully-filmed movie that especially looked good since it was one of the first DVDs I purchased over a decade ago. Rich colors and good period detail of 19th century England made it visually attractive. However, compared to most DVDs, the transfer here was too grainy. I hope MGM re-issues this on Bllu-Ray and gives it the sharp transfer it deserves.Story-wise, beware that it takes quite awhile before the actual holdup takes place. This is almost a two-hour film and they build up slowly to famous heist. However, I didn't find any of it boring. This is rated PG but there are quite of bit of sexual innuendos early on by Connery as he woos Lesley-Ane Down. Other than that, it's a pretty tame film. Donald Sutherland adds a touch a touch of humor here and there as he and Connery pull off the suspenseful heist....and it is suspenseful.Connery trying to maneuver on top of the train was a highlight, as was the ""whooshing"" sound of the train each time it passed under a bridge.

136457,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,0792835093,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[33, 33]","Based on the book and directed by Michael Crichton, this enjoyable caper movie from 1979 brings together a fantastic cast in an authentic 19th century Victorian environment to tell a story based around the true story of the first great train robbery. I saw this movie many years ago on British television and have always found it enjoyable so it was an easy buy for me.In addition to a superb Sean Connery as the suave mastermind Edward Pierce (is Connery ever NOT suave) and the always amazing Donald Sutherland as his accomplice Agar, we also have Lesley-Anne Down as Miriam. Down was a favorite actress of mine from this era with movies like ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" ""Rough Cut"" and ""Sphinx."" Here she plays Connery's lover who is not afraid to use her quite incredible feminine charms to aid Pierce character.Joining the three leads are such well known faces as British television celebrity Michael Elphick (as the railway guard who aids Pierce and Agar); Pamela Salem as Emily Trent (Salem would be reunited with Connery four years later in the rogue 007 film ""Never Say Never Again"") and Alan Webb as the bank president.Filmed in Ireland with a modest budget of only $6 million, the script is intelligent, the action appropriate and the dialogue both witty and engaging. The showpiece stunt with Pierce on top of a moving train has since been copied many times since, including in the 1983 James Bond movie ""Octopussy"" with Roger Moore in the role that Sean Connery made famous). But this stunt sequence is distinctive in that Connery performed his own stunts. The train was supposed to be traveling only 35 miles-per-hour, but Connery argued that the train was actually moving much faster, an assertion that was confirmed by the helicopter pilot who measured the speed of the train at 55 miles-per-hour.The movie, set in 1855, tells the story of the three conspirators attempts to steal $25 million in gold bullion that is being transported by train to pay British troops fighting in the Crimean War.To gain access to the gold Pierce and Agar need copies to four keys and the bulk of the movie involves their efforts to obtain each key in what can be described as four separate caper tales.The effort and difficulties facing the thieves is ably outlined by Connery in the opening narration to the movie:""In the year 1855, England and France were at war with Russia in the Crimea. The English troops were paid in gold. Once a month, twenty-five thousand pounds in gold was loaded into strongboxes inside the London bank of Huddleston and Bradford and taken by trusted armed guards to the railway station. The convoy followed no fixed route or timetable. At the station, the gold was loaded into the luggage van of the Folkestone train for shipment to the coast and from there to the Crimea. The strongboxes were placed into two specially-built Chubb safes constructed of three-quarter inch tempered steel. Each safe weighed five hundred and fifty pounds. Each safe was fitted with two locks, requiring two keys, or four keys altogether. For security, each key was individually protected. Two keys were entrusted to the railway dispatcher who kept them locked in his office. A third was in the custody of Mr. Edgar Trent, president of the Huddleston and Bradford. And the fourth key was given to Mr. Henry Fowler, manager of the Huddleston and Bradford. The presence of so much gold in one place naturally aroused the interest of the English criminal elements. But in 1855 there had never been a robbery from a moving railway train.""There are some definite differences between the actual robbery on which Crichton based his work and the movie. The actual plot involved four criminals - Pierce, Agar, the railway guard Burgess, and a railway clerk named Tester and all four keys were kept on railroad premises in London and Folkestone. But as it turned out the two Foilkestone keys were not used. In addition the guard's van was not locked from the outside; Pierce and Agar were let in by Burgess, and a share of the loot was handed out to Tester at stations.The crown jewel as far as supplementary material is concerned is the scene specific commentary by writer-director Crichton. Even given the intervening 18 years between the release of the movie and the recording of the commentary Crichton seems to have a wealth of anecdotal and technical recollections of the making of the movie and displays a genuine affection for the movie. We learn about the research he did for the book and the machinations that went on behind the scenes. Apparently the largely British and Irish crew initially had little respect for the young director until he ordered a copy of his 1978 movie ""Coma"" for them to watch, after which he got more respect. In another incident Crichton's hair caught on fire when the locomotive emitted burning embers.There is also (as was common for MGM releases in the earlu days of DVD) an 8-page glossy, full color booklet with trivia surrounding the making of the movie.",5,One of my favorites of all caper movies,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,5000,"['Based', 'book', 'directed', 'Michael', 'Crichton',

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","The mysterious Edward Pierce, on the surface a gentleman above reproach and well-established in Victorian London's aristocratic circles, secretly a daring master criminal who sometimes goes by the alias of ""John Simms."" In 1855, as war rages in the Crimea between Russia and England and France, Edward Pierce sets his sights on the 25,000 of gold shipped by train once a month to pay the English troops. He's worked out the logistics. He only requires copies of the four keys that access the payroll strongboxes on that train. Much of the narrative concerns itself with the ingenious duplication of these keys.Edward Pierce has got a canny eye for people. He seeks out the vices of them so-called honorable blokes what safeguard the keys. As such he targets one old banker at a seedy dogfighting venue and ambushes another in a brothel, both engaged in activities most certainly frowned upon by high society. Pierce has pressed into service that unparalleled screwsman Agar (Donald Sutherland) and the dodgy cat burglar Clean Willy (Wayne Sleep) who, by the way, must extricate himself from prison so as to participate in the Big Job. By Pierce's side is the spirited Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), his lady love and clever accomplice. If ever a woman were born to wear lacy Victorian knickers, it is the glorious Lesley-Anne Down. There's that steamy bedroom scene between her and Connery in which she slinks around in her delicates. Even though Down doesn't actually flash the flesh, you walk away with your eyeballs fogged over. Watching her in this movie, you fall in love with her character. Her Miriam makes a winning combination of sweetness and tawdriness, of elegance and street savviness. Miriam is gifted and in full command of her skills set but frets over whether Pierce is serious about her.The opening's voiceover narration ends thus and so sets up high expectations: ""The presence of so much gold in one place naturally aroused the interest of the English criminal elements. But in 1855 there had never been a robbery from a moving railway train."" THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, adapted to screenplay by director Michael Crichton from his own novel, presents a rollicking caper adventure brimming with striking period detail and doubtless authentic gutter vernacular from the Victorian era. Released in 1979, before soulless CG and before Michael Bay's obnoxiousness, we're treated to old school tricks of the trade - to marvelously staged practical effects - in terms of how the elaborate con and heist are conceived, rehearsed, and executed. And for the Big Job itself, it turns out one can absolutely make do with the appliance of a sneaky disguise or three, wax impressions of keys, a sound cardiovascular system, and a dead, stanky cat. A thread of rugged humor runs thru the film, with Sean Connery yet again demonstrating his mastery of the light touch. If I were to sum up Sean Connery, it'd go like this: virility tempered with smarts and sardonic humor. He's effortless as the consummate gentleman thief.Donald Sutherland has built up a career rife with oddball character roles, and he doesn't disappoint here. He endows his quirky safecracker with an arsenal of splendid little tics and pecadillos. Maybe my favorite Sutherland scene has him frenziedly running around the room as he times himself during the gang's rehearsal of their impending snatch of the keys at the railway station.It's obligatory with these heist pictures that the plan never ever unfolds without something going wrong. The fun is in seeing how our ""heroes"" cope with these inevitable swerves. Pierce resolves one such unexpected dilemma with a terse command: ""Find me a dead cat."" Heh. This story is based on the real-life hijacking of a gold shipment headed for the Crimean War in 1855. But I doubt the real-life mastermind ever found himself teetering on top of a hurtling train, having to avoid decapitation from onrushing low bridges. That's Sean Connery himself doing that. I guess the stunt double had the day off and someone lost the back projection screen. No wonder Connery has swagger.",5,"""But in 1855 there had never been a robbery from a moving railway train.""",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,4085,"['mysterious', 'Edward', 'Pierce', 'surface', 'gentleman', 'reproach', 'well-established', 'Victorian', 'London', 'aristocratic', 'circles', 'secretly', 'daring', 'master', 'criminal', 'who', 'sometimes', 'alias', 'John', 'Simms', '1855', 'war', 'rages', 'Crimea', 'Russia', 'England', 'France', 'Edward', 'Pierce', 'sights', '25,000', 'gold', 'shipped', 'train', 'once', 'month', 'pay', 'English', 'troops', 'worked', 'out', 'logistics', 'only', 'copies', 'four', 'keys', 'access', 'payroll', 'strongboxes', 'train', 'Much', 'narrative', 'concerns', 'ingenious', 'duplication', 'keys.Edward', 'Pierce', 'got', 'canny', 'eye', 'people', 'out', 'vices', 'so-called', 'honorable', 'blokes', 'what', 'safeguard', 'keys', 'such', 'one', 'old', 'banker', 'seedy', 'dogfighting', 'venue', 'brothel', 'engaged', 'activities', 'most', 'certainly', 'frowned', 'high', 'society', 'Pierce', 'pressed', 'service', 'unparalleled', 'screwsman', 'Agar', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'dodgy', 'cat', 'burglar', 'Clean', 'Willy', 'Wayne', 'Sleep', 'who', 'way', 'must', 'extricate', 'prison', 'so', 'participate', 'Big', 'Job', 'Pierce', 'side', 'spirited', 'Miriam', 'Lesley-Anne', 'Down', 'lady', 'love', 'clever', 'accomplice', 'ever', 'woman', 'were', 'born', 'wear', 'lacy', 'Victorian', 'knickers', 'glorious', 'Lesley-Anne', 'Down', 'steamy', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'Connery', 'around', 'delicates', 'Even', 'Down', ""n't"", 'actually', 'flash', 'flesh', 'walk', 'away', 'eyeballs', 'fogged', 'Watching', 'movie', 'fall', 'love', 'character', 'Miriam', 'winning', 'combination', 'sweetness', 'tawdriness', 'elegance', 'street', 'savviness', 'Miriam', 'gifted', 'full', 'command', 'skills', 'set', 'frets', 'Pierce', 'serious', 'her.The', 'opening', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'thus', 'so', 'up', 'high', 'expectations', 'presence', 'so', 'much', 'gold', 'one', 'place', 'naturally', 'aroused', 'interest', 'English', 'criminal', 'elements', '1855', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'robbery', 'moving', 'railway', 'train', 'GREAT', 'TRAIN', 'ROBBERY', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'director', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'own', 'novel', 'rollicking', 'caper', 'adventure', 'brimming', 'striking', 'period', 'detail', 'doubtless', 'authentic', 'gutter', 'vernacular', 'Victorian', 'era', 'Released', '1979', 'soulless', 'CG', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'obnoxiousness', ""'re"", 'treated', 'old', 'school', 'tricks', 'trade', 'marvelously', 'staged', 'practical', 'effects', 'terms', 'how', 'elaborate', 'con', 'heist', 'are', 'conceived', 'rehearsed', 'executed', 'Big', 'Job', 'out', 'one', 'can', 'absolutely', 'make', 'do', 'appliance', 'sneaky', 'disguise', 'three', 'wax', 'impressions', 'keys', 'sound', 'cardiovascular', 'system', 'dead', 'stanky', 'cat', 'thread', 'rugged', 'humor', 'film', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'yet', 'again', 'demonstrating', 'mastery', 'light', 'touch', 'were', 'sum', 'up', 'Sean', 'Connery', ""'d"", 'go', 'virility', 'tempered', 'smarts', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'consummate', 'gentleman', 'thief.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'built', 'up', 'career', 'rife', 'oddball', 'character', 'roles', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'here', 'quirky', 'safecracker', 'arsenal', 'splendid', 'little', 'tics', 'pecadillos', 'Maybe', 'favorite', 'Sutherland', 'scene', 'frenziedly', 'running', 'room', 'gang', 'rehearsal', 'impending', 'snatch', 'keys', 'railway', 'station.It', 'obligatory', 'heist', 'plan', 'never', 'ever', 'unfolds', 'something', 'going', 'wrong', 'fun', 'seeing', 'how', 'heroes', 'cope', 'inevitable', 'swerves', 'Pierce', 'one', 'such', 'unexpected', 'dilemma', 'terse', 'command', 'dead', 'cat', 'Heh', 'story', 'based', 'real-life', 'hijacking', 'gold', 'shipment', 'headed', 'Crimean', 'War', '1855', 'doubt', 'real-life', 'mastermind', 'ever', 'found', 'teetering', 'top', 'hurtling', 'train', 'having', 'avoid', 'decapitation', 'onrushing', 'low', 'bridges', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'doing', 'guess', 'stunt', 'double', 'had', 'day', 'someone', 'lost', 'back', 'projection', 'screen', 'wonder', 'Connery', 'swagger']",N/A

Filmed in 1978, this is Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland at their finest, playing two Victorian scalawags trying to pull off the biggest heist in British history. To say any more about the outcome would be a spoiler, but the movie is almost two hours of nonstop intrigue and tension as the two crooks try to figure how to steal the unstealable.With Crichton writing the screenplay and directing, the movie was pretty faithful to the book, although if you want all the little details, read the book also. This was based on an actual event, but I don't know how faithful Crichton's story is to the real event.

""The Great Train Robbery"" (titled ""The First Great Train Robbery"" for its UK release) is just as whimsical and fun.But I did notice something this week that I hadn't noticed before, probably because I recently watched it on a much larger TV screen:  in the crowd shots for the scene where a female prisoner is hanged while another prisoner attempts his escape, you can see a large number of extras wearing modern-day (1977/78) street clothes in a scene taking place in the mid-19th century.  I suppose the production didn't have enough costumed extras to fill the frame for that scene, so some locals and miscellaneous crew members were brought in last-minute to flesh it out.  This fact may or may not be mentioned in Crichton's commentary track on the DVD (which I listened to too many years ago to recall its specifics), but I'm just proud of myself for being able to spot it on my own!Seeing this on a larger screen also permits the viewer to get a better look at the lovely Lesley-Anne Down, who takes a somewhat two-dimensional role and infuses it with a considerable amount of humor.  Her character endures some mildly unpleasant and socially awkward exchanges with amorous males intent on seducing her, and Down's facial expressions during her slow burns comically showcase her character's disdain for her would-be suitors (the funniest being the one on the train near the climax of the film).But the film is carried by Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland and both of them make this a very enjoyable ride for the viewer.

136466,A3OH101U0CPUC7,0792835093,Joseph Boone,"[1, 1]","In 1855, England was near the height of its power. Industrialization had transformed the country, its empire stretched across most of the world, and high-speed rail was an established fact of life. In the midst of this Victorian order, Edward Pierce conceived and executed perhaps the most daring robbery up to that point in time.  Specifically, he and his confederates set out to steal 25,000 pounds in gold bullion from a moving train protected by every form of security available in that age.This is something of a pet project for Michael Crichton.  First he wrote the novel,The Great Train Robbery, and then he wrote and directed this adaptation.  As one might expect, the movie largely stays true to the book except for some trimming to help keep the film from running too long.  The tone is fairly tongue-in-cheek and the plot moves along at a good pace.The cast is largely populated with unknowns, though there are two obvious exceptions.  Sean Connery takes center stage as Pierce and does an adequate, though highly understated, job of filling the role.  Donald Sutherland plays his primary aide, Agar, and gives the part with a suitable touch of goofiness without going overboard.  The no-names all do creditably jobs of filling their roles but none stand out.Those who love a good heist should enjoy The Great Train Robbery.  Some of the intricacy is lost in the translation to film, but it's still very solid.  One complaint is that there is a fair amount of 19th century slang and criminal jargon that can be tough to follow and is never explained or translated for 21st century viewers.  It also seemed to me that Crichton might not have been the best director for this movie.  It's very ""by the numbers"" and lacks any real verve.  When you look at the plot, I see no reason why this couldn't be every bit as enjoyable asThe Sting, but it's not even in the same league.  There isn't enough sense of fun, and more emphasis on the intricacy of the planning would have made the crime seem more impressive.This is not a bad movie, and worth giving a try if you enjoy heists.  Sean Connery doesn't give his most memorable performance, but his many fans should enjoy seeing him play the rogue.

Due to the fine acting and direction by Michael Crichton, the story, which was based on an actual robbery, was a great success, and was endlessly entertaining.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books",5,&quot;Because I wanted the money&quot;  he told the judge.,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,2227,"['Director', 'Michael', 'CrichtonFormat', 'ColorStudio', 'Mgm/Ua', 'StudiosVideo', 'Release', 'Date', 'July', '1', '1997Cast', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'Edward', 'Pierce/John', 'Simms/GeoffreyDonald', 'Sutherland', 'Robert', 'Agar', 'ScrewsmanLesley-Anne', 'Down', 'Miriam/Madame', 'Lucienne/Miss', 'Brigid', 'LawsonAlan', 'Webb', 'Edgar', 'Trent', 'President', 'Huddleston', 'amp', 'Bradford', 'BankMalcolm', 'Terris', 'Henry', 'Fowler', 'Manager', 'Huddleston', 'amp', 'Bradford', 'BankRobert', 'Lang', 'Inspector', 'SharpMichael', 'Elphick', 'Burgess', 'Railway', 'Guard', 'AccompliceWayne', 'Sleep', 'William', 'Willy', 'Williams', 'SnakesmanPamela', 'Salem', 'Emily', 'TrentGabrielle', 'Lloyd', 'Elizabeth', 'TrentGeorge', 'Downing', 'Barlow', 'Coachman', 'AccompliceJames', 'Cossins', 'Inspector', 'HarranbyJohn', 'Bett', 'McPhersonPeter', 'Benson', 'Station', 'DespatcherJanine', 'Duvitski', 'MaggieBrian', 'Salvo', 'John', 'Trent', 'ButlerAndr', 'eacute', 'Morell', 'JudgeDonald', 'Churchill', 'ProsecutorBrian', 'Glover', 'Captain', 'JimmyNoel', 'Johnson', 'ConnaughtPeter', 'Butterworth', 'PutnamPatrick', 'Barr', 'BurkeHubert', 'Rees', 'LewisAgnes', 'Bernelle', 'Woman', 'PlatformFrank', 'McDonald', 'P.C', 'London', 'Bridge', 'StationJoe', 'Cahill', 'Rail', 'Guard', 'Folkestone', 'TrainCecil', 'Nash', 'Newgate', 'Prison', 'ChaplainSusan', 'Hallinan', 'Emma', 'BarnesOliver', 'Smith', 'Ratting', 'AssistantJohn', 'Altman', 'First', 'PickpocketPaul', 'Kember', 'Second', 'PickpocketGeoff', 'Ferris', 'Third', 'PickpocketJenny', 'Till', 'Woman', 'StrandCraig', 'Stokes', 'Urchin', 'StrandDonald', 'Hewlett', 'Club', 'MemberGeoffrey', 'UnsworthBrooke', 'AdamsNuala', 'Holloway', 'Call', 'GirlThe', 'inimitable', 'Edward', 'Pierce', 'Sean', 'Connery', '1855', 'pulled', 'off', 'first', 'robbery', 'moving', 'train', 'shipment', 'gold', 'bullion', 'intended', 'Crimea', 'months', 'planning', 'making', 'wax', 'impressions', 'four', 'keys', 'effecting', 'prison', 'break', 'one', 'henchmen', 'necessary', 'plan', 'escape', 'Pierce', 'fact', 'robbery', 'robbery', 'was', 'completed', 'hitch.Taking', 'part', 'robbery', 'was', 'Robert', 'Agar', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Miriam', 'Lesley-Anne', 'Down', 'sundry', 'other', 'characters', 'Due', 'fine', 'acting', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'robbery', 'was', 'great', 'success', 'was', 'endlessly', 'entertaining.Joseph', 'Joe', 'Pierreauthor', 'Handguns', 'Freedom', 'care', 'maintenanceand', 'other', 'books']",N/A

Sean Connery was on THE TODAY SHOW when it was released and discussed doing his own stunt work during the robbery scenes.  Stumbling atop the rattling train, he was certain they had to be moving much faster than 35 MPH.  When he asked the engineers how they knew they were going 35, they said they calculated it by counting the telephone poles going by!  The train was actually going well over 50 MPH!Director Michael Crichton recounts the same story in his commentary.  I would've given this film five stars but, after listening to him voice his disatisfaction with it, I took one star off.  I should've left the commentary for another time!Crichton does offer a lot of interesting insights into the film.  The difficulties of recreating a London that doesn't exist anymore, the moral dilemma of filming a dog killing rats (the &quot;ratting&quot; scene is real), the filming of the train scenes.Connery brings his cool authority to the proceedings and Donald Sutherland is always interesting.
