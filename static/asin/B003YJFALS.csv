Figueroa ""Knight of the Black Rose""","[0, 2]","I wish there were special features and that the picture quality was better.However, it's never looked better (not saying much).The set starts out with the episode that bridges the two seasons. It's an episode that more belongs as part of the first season, containing the last appearance of several first season characters.After that, the show bears no similarity to season 1 and may as well be a different show. It's dark in both lighting, atmosphere, themes, and mood.For most, this show marks the introductory role of Adrian Paul who would later play TV's Highlander.The budget of the show also takes a serious drop in cringe-worthy ways, making scenes which should be serious into Mystery Science Theater material. The show that premiered along side Star Trek: The Next Generation fell far indeed.But for those who like dark shows with heroes fighting sinister forces from the shadows, you could do worse.For myself, it's worth it just to have the final episode of the Col.

I think that for it's day (early 80's...soldiers are still wearing old pisspot helmets), it was probably cutting edge. Quite frankly, I'm having trouble getting through it. It's not the concept, which I find is grear. It's the writing, which is full of cliches, the acting, which is wooden with no chemistry between the characters, which of course goes back to the writing again and the directing. It's outdated and owes a lot of it's style and form to Quinn Martin shows, like the Invaders, except they existed 15 years earlier. I think my biggest beefs are that the aliens say the same things in each episode...""we must raise our bretheren, these humans are stronger than we anticipated, we must accomplish this brothers or all is lost."" The humans do the same thing and they are wooden enough to make Keanu Reeves look animated.I do like the way they transition from the 1953 film with Gene Barry to now. To throw in some references to HG Wells would have been nice and thus far I've discovered no real purpose for the invasion, although I might have missed it. With the kind of military power the aliens have, this should be no contest.I'm keeping the set so I can watch it again, but so far I'm underwhelmed.",3,Feeling pulled and pushed,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,1340,"['have', 'been', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'life', ""'m"", '59', 'Somehow', 'missed', 'series', 'bought', 'here', 'good', 'price', 'think', 'day', 'early', '80', 'soldiers', 'are', 'still', 'wearing', 'old', 'pisspot', 'helmets', 'was', 'probably', 'cutting', 'edge', 'Quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'not', 'concept', 'find', 'grear', 'writing', 'full', 'cliches', 'acting', 'wooden', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'course', 'back', 'writing', 'again', 'directing', 'outdated', 'lot', 'style', 'form', 'Quinn', 'Martin', 'Invaders', 'existed', '15', 'years', 'earlier', 'think', 'biggest', 'beefs', 'are', 'aliens', 'say', 'same', 'things', 'episode', 'must', 'raise', 'bretheren', 'humans', 'are', 'stronger', 'anticipated', 'must', 'accomplish', 'brothers', 'lost', 'humans', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'are', 'wooden', 'enough', 'make', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'look', 'animated.I', 'do', 'way', 'transition', '1953', 'film', 'Gene', 'Barry', 'now', 'throw', 'references', 'HG', 'Wells', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'thus', 'far', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'real', 'purpose', 'invasion', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'kind', 'military', 'power', 'aliens', 'have', 'should', 'be', 'contest.I', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'set', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'so', 'far', ""'m"", 'underwhelmed']",War of the Worlds: The Complete Series
