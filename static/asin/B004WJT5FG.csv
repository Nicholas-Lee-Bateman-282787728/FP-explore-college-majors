1430624,A2817AWABAP3RC,B004WJT5FG,"Anonymous ""JaneJane""","[49, 49]","My 7 year old daughter (who loves bunnies) and I watched this movie and cried the whole time. It was a great bonding experience but it tells you just how sad this movie is. Very charming but sad.Story: An abused 9 year old Julia (whose mother is a drug addict and an alcoholic) is placed in a new foster family. Foster dad is stressed because he can't find a job. Foster mom is an artist and very loving. Foster brother is  not a bad boy but has no patience for a ""broken foster sister"".Julia doesn't talk or otherwise engage in family life, she only watches ""Velveteen Rabbit"" movie over and over again. Some flashbacks show her mother coming late at night drunk and stoned (closing a door in some guy's face) and hitting Julia for not sleeping in a bathtub like she was told. So we know that Julia has a broken heart. When the family finds a hurt rabbit in the woods, Julia gets very attached to it. The only person that can help the hurt bunniy is a weird old lady who lives on the farm with hundreds of abandoned animals. She refuses to return the bunny to Julia until the girl learns to take care of it properly. So Julia spends every afternoon after school at the old woman's farm helping with animals, and in the process of healing the bunny she heals her own heart.It is a great family movie as long as you are prepared to discuss following issues:1)adoption/foster families2) mothers abandoning children/not showing up for visitation appointments (it might bring bad memories in families with divorced parents)3) mother in jail/giving away parental rights4) drug/alcohol addiction5) running away from home6) parents hurting children (it is only a slap on the face in a movie, so it is not graphic at all but when Julia slaps a doll she receives as a gift from the foster family for Christmas it is clear that she is damaged and has lots of anger).Please don't let this scare you away from this wonderful movie. It's a lovely movie indeed, but it does deal with some adult topics that might or might not go over kids' heads.*****Spoiler alert********It has a happy ending so it will be happy tears.",5,Very very sad but so touching!,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,2106,"['7', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'who', 'bunnies', 'watched', 'movie', 'cried', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'great', 'bonding', 'experience', 'just', 'how', 'sad', 'movie', 'Very', 'charming', 'sad.Story', 'abused', '9', 'year', 'old', 'Julia', 'mother', 'drug', 'addict', 'alcoholic', 'placed', 'new', 'foster', 'family', 'Foster', 'dad', 'stressed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'Foster', 'mom', 'artist', 'very', 'loving', 'Foster', 'brother', 'not', 'bad', 'boy', 'patience', 'broken', 'foster', 'sister', '.Julia', ""n't"", 'talk', 'otherwise', 'engage', 'family', 'life', 'only', 'Velveteen', 'Rabbit', 'movie', 'over', 'again', 'flashbacks', 'show', 'mother', 'coming', 'late', 'night', 'drunk', 'stoned', 'closing', 'door', 'guy', 'face', 'hitting', 'Julia', 'not', 'sleeping', 'bathtub', 'was', 'told', 'know', 'Julia', 'broken', 'heart', 'When', 'family', 'hurt', 'rabbit', 'woods', 'Julia', 'very', 'attached', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'help', 'hurt', 'bunniy', 'weird', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'farm', 'hundreds', 'abandoned', 'animals', 'return', 'bunny', 'Julia', 'girl', 'take', 'care', 'properly', 'So', 'Julia', 'spends', 'afternoon', 'school', 'old', 'woman', 'farm', 'helping', 'animals', 'process', 'healing', 'bunny', 'own', 'heart.It', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'prepared', 'discuss', 'following', 'issues:1', 'adoption/foster', 'families2', 'mothers', 'abandoning', 'children/not', 'showing', 'up', 'visitation', 'appointments', 'might', 'bring', 'bad', 'memories', 'families', 'divorced', 'parents', '3', 'mother', 'jail/giving', 'away', 'parental', 'rights4', 'drug/alcohol', 'addiction5', 'running', 'away', 'home6', 'parents', 'hurting', 'children', 'only', 'slap', 'face', 'movie', 'not', 'graphic', 'when', 'Julia', 'doll', 'gift', 'foster', 'family', 'Christmas', 'clear', 'damaged', 'lots', 'anger', '.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'scare', 'away', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'lovely', 'movie', 'indeed', 'deal', 'adult', 'topics', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'go', 'kids', 'heads', '*****Spoiler', 'alert********It', 'happy', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'tears']",The Christmas Bunny
1430625,A3LWC833HQIG7J,B004WJT5FG,austin_Larry,"[6, 6]","I just finished watching this on Netflix. We were able to adopt our daughter just a couple of weeks agon on National Adoption day so the summary of the story intrigued me. I found the movie very powerful with excellent performances from Florence Henderson and the young actress playing the foster child, Julia.Julia is 9 and the movie did a very accurate job of showing what would be common occurances leading up to a child entering foster care. Of coure there are a million different details but the basic scenario of a biological unable and/or unwilling to provide even minimal basic safe care for a child is why children enter the foster system. I do strongly disagree with the existing 1 star review at the time of my writing this. The scenes of Julia's previous life are VERY brief. The filmmakers did their best to keep these brief. But they were completely necessary to the movie. And they could be used as a teaching moment for young children watching that will help them better understand any foster or adoptive children in their schools, and life. How come Julia isn't with her mom? What did her mom do? How come Julia is sad?From my experiences with foster to adopt most things were portrayed accuretly with the exception of the biological mom going over to the foster home for a visit. This would NOT happen for anyone considering foster to adopt. It also somewhat brought up what might be a big mis-conception about fostering; people doing it for pay. Are there some foster only homes for who this is a consideration, yes? Maybe even a big consideration. But there are many homes like we were who are foster to adopt. We WANTED to adopt. Our fist placement did go back to relatives after we had fallen in love with him. But we were lucky enough to adopt our daughter. In the movie they say Michigan pays $15 a day. Texas pays a little over $20. Ask yourself this. These children are in need, it is not safe for them with biological parents and then relatives are asked and are unable or not suitable as well. They need a home. Would a for profit group home charge the state $20 a day to care for a child? Heck no. You are talking probably at least a $100 a day maybe $200 or more. Foster homes across this country save tax payers billions of dollars a year.Every foster child is different. Our placements were both very much younger so did not have the same problems at all. And obviously for dramatic purposes Julia was portrayed as I would say on the very much more to more than average problem side. However the filmakers did do their homework or had their own experiences because the ways Julia act out are some of the most common that were related to us that we might see with older children. In the end, surprisingly powerful performances, very accurate, and something worth watching to anyone considering fostering, foster to adopt, or adoption. And of course anyone who wants a much better than average holiday movie that IS something younger kids (say 7 or 8 and up) both can and SHOULD watch with parental guidance.",5,"Powerful, well-done, and mostly accurate account of foster to adopt system.",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",2011,3038,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Netflix', 'were', 'able', 'adopt', 'daughter', 'just', 'couple', 'weeks', 'agon', 'National', 'Adoption', 'day', 'summary', 'story', 'intrigued', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'powerful', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'young', 'actress', 'playing', 'foster', 'child', 'Julia.Julia', '9', 'movie', 'did', 'very', 'accurate', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'common', 'occurances', 'leading', 'up', 'child', 'entering', 'foster', 'care', 'coure', 'are', 'million', 'different', 'details', 'basic', 'scenario', 'biological', 'unable', 'and/or', 'unwilling', 'provide', 'even', 'minimal', 'basic', 'safe', 'care', 'child', 'why', 'children', 'enter', 'foster', 'system', 'do', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'existing', '1', 'star', 'review', 'time', 'writing', 'scenes', 'Julia', 'previous', 'life', 'are', 'VERY', 'brief', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'best', 'keep', 'brief', 'were', 'completely', 'necessary', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'teaching', 'moment', 'young', 'children', 'watching', 'will', 'help', 'better', 'understand', 'foster', 'adoptive', 'children', 'schools', 'life', 'How', 'come', 'Julia', ""n't"", 'mom', 'What', 'did', 'mom', 'do', 'How', 'come', 'Julia', 'sad', 'experiences', 'foster', 'adopt', 'most', 'things', 'were', 'portrayed', 'accuretly', 'exception', 'biological', 'mom', 'going', 'foster', 'home', 'visit', 'would', 'NOT', 'happen', 'anyone', 'considering', 'foster', 'adopt', 'also', 'somewhat', 'brought', 'up', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'big', 'mis-conception', 'fostering', 'people', 'doing', 'pay', 'Are', 'there', 'foster', 'only', 'homes', 'who', 'consideration', 'yes', 'Maybe', 'even', 'big', 'consideration', 'are', 'many', 'homes', 'were', 'who', 'are', 'foster', 'adopt', 'WANTED', 'adopt', 'fist', 'placement', 'did', 'go', 'back', 'relatives', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'were', 'lucky', 'enough', 'adopt', 'daughter', 'movie', 'say', 'Michigan', '15', 'day', 'Texas', 'little', '20', 'Ask', 'children', 'are', 'need', 'not', 'safe', 'biological', 'parents', 'then', 'relatives', 'are', 'asked', 'are', 'unable', 'not', 'suitable', 'as', 'well', 'need', 'home', 'Would', 'profit', 'group', 'home', 'charge', 'state', '20', 'day', 'care', 'child', 'Heck', 'are', 'talking', 'probably', 'least', '100', 'day', 'maybe', '200', 'more', 'Foster', 'homes', 'country', 'save', 'tax', 'payers', 'billions', 'dollars', 'year.Every', 'foster', 'child', 'different', 'placements', 'were', 'very', 'much', 'younger', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'problems', 'obviously', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'Julia', 'was', 'portrayed', 'would', 'say', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'more', 'average', 'problem', 'side', 'However', 'filmakers', 'did', 'do', 'homework', 'had', 'own', 'experiences', 'ways', 'Julia', 'act', 'out', 'are', 'most', 'common', 'were', 'related', 'might', 'see', 'older', 'children', 'end', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'performances', 'very', 'accurate', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'anyone', 'considering', 'fostering', 'foster', 'adopt', 'adoption', 'course', 'anyone', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'average', 'holiday', 'movie', 'something', 'younger', 'kids', 'say', '7', '8', 'up', 'can', 'SHOULD', 'watch', 'parental', 'guidance']",The Christmas Bunny

Unlike a lot of movies, it treats issues like the father's unemployment and its affect on the rest of the family very seriously and respectfully, so that we see how his pain affects the little girl as well as his wife. Similarly, it takes the issue of rabbits discarded after the holidays and quietly shows how negligent adults and their children have created a real problem.

1430632,A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,B004WJT5FG,"Janet Boyer ""Snowland Deck and Coffee Tarot C...","[5, 5]","In arguably the performance of her life, Florence Henderson (Brady Bunch) stars as an eccentric, rough-around-the-edges farmwoman who nurses bunnies back to health.A troubled foster child named Julia has been tossed from home to home, largely because she won't speak and obsessively watches an old videotape of The Velveteen Rabbit. Her foster families don't know what to do with her--and Julia's Mom is a drug addict incapable of caring for her.Enter a loving but fallen-on-hard-times family that includes an out-of-work engineer for a father, a stay-at-home furniture-painting mom and an adolescent boy who have decided to take on a foster child (doing double duty for additional income and filling a void in the mom's heart).The caseworkers place Julia with the family, but the transition isn't smooth--especially because of Julia's lack of communication and anti-social behavior.During the holidays, cousins come over and an uncle gets the boy a BB gun. They run out in the woods and start shooting at birds--and end up injuring a bunny. Julia takes to the bunny and the family rush the animal to the vet.Barring an expensive operation, the bunny has little chance. However, the vet knows a woman who's a ""Bunny Lady""...a rabbit whisperer, if you will. The family goes to the Bunny Lady's farm and get a chilly reception, but she agrees to keep it and try to mend it.Unbeknownst to her family, Julia gets off at a different bus stop (which worries them): it's at the Bunny Lady's farm. The Bunny Lady allows Julia to visit every day, and she teaches Julia how to care for the rabbits.When the bratty boys take the healed bunny and decide to put it in one of their ""sleighs"" to push down a steep snow hill they made, Julia screams--and bites one of the boys...and then runs away deep into the forest on a bitterly cold evening.The rest of the movie shows how a family's love (and a rabbit's!) breaks through to a sad, mistrustful, lonely little girl--and how a grown man learns humility for the sake of his family and how a bitter widow's heart softens towards humanity.The Christmas Bunny isn't a saccharine holiday tale (despite receiving Five out of Five Doves from the Dove Foundation), and does have a few unsettling moments. Still, it's a redemptive, well-acted movie likely to elicit more than a few tears, as well as feelings of thankfulness for family and community.-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuff",4,Not Your Typical Christmas Movie,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,2417,"['arguably', 'performance', 'life', 'Florence', 'Henderson', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'eccentric', 'rough-around-the-edges', 'farmwoman', 'who', 'bunnies', 'back', 'health.A', 'troubled', 'foster', 'child', 'named', 'Julia', 'been', 'tossed', 'home', 'home', 'largely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'speak', 'obsessively', 'old', 'videotape', 'Velveteen', 'Rabbit', 'foster', 'families', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'Julia', 'Mom', 'drug', 'addict', 'incapable', 'caring', 'her.Enter', 'loving', 'fallen-on-hard-times', 'family', 'out-of-work', 'engineer', 'father', 'stay-at-home', 'furniture-painting', 'mom', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'who', 'have', 'decided', 'take', 'foster', 'child', 'doing', 'double', 'duty', 'additional', 'income', 'filling', 'void', 'mom', 'heart', 'caseworkers', 'place', 'Julia', 'family', 'transition', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'especially', 'Julia', 'lack', 'communication', 'anti-social', 'behavior.During', 'holidays', 'cousins', 'come', 'uncle', 'boy', 'BB', 'gun', 'run', 'out', 'woods', 'start', 'shooting', 'birds', 'end', 'up', 'injuring', 'bunny', 'Julia', 'bunny', 'family', 'animal', 'vet.Barring', 'expensive', 'operation', 'bunny', 'little', 'chance', 'However', 'vet', 'woman', 'who', 'Bunny', 'Lady', 'rabbit', 'whisperer', 'will', 'family', 'Bunny', 'Lady', 'farm', 'get', 'chilly', 'reception', 'keep', 'try', 'mend', 'it.Unbeknownst', 'family', 'Julia', 'off', 'different', 'bus', 'stop', 'Bunny', 'Lady', 'farm', 'Bunny', 'Lady', 'Julia', 'visit', 'day', 'Julia', 'how', 'care', 'rabbits.When', 'bratty', 'boys', 'take', 'healed', 'bunny', 'decide', 'put', 'one', 'sleighs', 'push', 'down', 'steep', 'snow', 'hill', 'made', 'Julia', 'one', 'boys', 'then', 'away', 'deep', 'forest', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'evening.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'how', 'family', 'love', 'rabbit', 'sad', 'mistrustful', 'lonely', 'little', 'girl', 'how', 'grown', 'man', 'humility', 'sake', 'family', 'how', 'bitter', 'widow', 'heart', 'towards', 'humanity.The', 'Christmas', 'Bunny', ""n't"", 'saccharine', 'holiday', 'tale', 'receiving', 'Five', 'Five', 'Doves', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'have', 'few', 'unsettling', 'moments', 'Still', 'redemptive', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'likely', 'elicit', 'more', 'few', 'tears', 'as', 'well', 'feelings', 'thankfulness', 'family', 'community.', 'Janet', 'Boyer', 'author', 'lots', 'stuff']",The Christmas Bunny
