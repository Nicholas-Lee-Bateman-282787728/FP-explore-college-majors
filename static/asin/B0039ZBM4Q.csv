1334508,A1248JRIINWRTH,B0039ZBM4Q,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[1, 2]","Let me first say I am not a regular watcher of Ghost Hunters or Paranormal State. I've seen clips on YouTube, but that's about it - ironic, since I love to read about ghosts.I liked Paranormal Cops because these guys used cold, hard logic and forensic evidence to figure out the source of ghostly trappings, rather than mythology and blind belief. To me, following the evidence is better. Sure, there is a cheese factor - but what ghost chasing show doesn't have some cheese mixed in? My only major disappointment was that they never found a person or animal who was causing some of the mischief. All but one instance had paranormal activity. I figured, being cops, these guys would find someone hiding out, doing some stuff, at least one time.As of this review, this DVD is $18 on Amazon, which is MUCH too expensive. There are only six episodes and a few extras that are just extra footage. It isn't worth that, but maybe half that price. Since you can watch full episodes online, you'd think they'd lower the price point.",4,"Not bad, but too expensive",1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,1024,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'regular', 'watcher', 'Ghost', 'Hunters', 'Paranormal', 'State', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'YouTube', 'ironic', 'love', 'read', 'ghosts.I', 'liked', 'Paranormal', 'Cops', 'guys', 'used', 'cold', 'hard', 'logic', 'forensic', 'evidence', 'figure', 'out', 'source', 'ghostly', 'trappings', 'rather', 'mythology', 'blind', 'belief', 'following', 'evidence', 'better', 'Sure', 'cheese', 'factor', 'what', 'ghost', 'chasing', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'cheese', 'mixed', 'only', 'major', 'disappointment', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'person', 'animal', 'who', 'was', 'causing', 'mischief', 'one', 'instance', 'had', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'figured', 'being', 'cops', 'guys', 'would', 'find', 'someone', 'hiding', 'out', 'doing', 'stuff', 'least', 'one', 'time.As', 'review', 'DVD', '18', 'Amazon', 'MUCH', 'too', 'expensive', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'few', 'extras', 'are', 'just', 'extra', 'footage', ""n't"", 'worth', 'maybe', 'half', 'price', 'can', 'watch', 'full', 'episodes', 'online', ""'d"", 'think', ""'d"", 'lower', 'price', 'point']",N/A

Believable and likeable investigators.  Real time footage.  Real time evidence.  A building worth investigating.  Good production quality.  I finished the show and wanted to see another one....but couldn't find another one.

1334510,A1ERC0I9LTI5JN,B0039ZBM4Q,Clarissa Bowen,"[10, 16]","This show is a joke. First off their promo slogan is ""Cops by day, paranormal investigators by night."" Sound familiar to anyone? Does Ghost Hunter's ""Plumbers by day, ghost hunters by night"" ring a bell? That right there hints at how uninspired and unoriginal this show truly is.I love paranormal-based shows (especially the ones serious about educating the world [skeptics and believers alike] with scientific approaches), but PARANORMAL COPS brings nothing new or note-worthy to the field. In fact, I found myself laughing more than anything else while watching this series. And they cram a whole lot in in under just 30 minutes a week.

I don't think there are enough episodes to justify the price. Nor do I think it's really worth that much with the quality. It's a good show.

1334514,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0039ZBM4Q,Haunted Flower,"[1, 1]","Paranormal CopsThe Complete Season One6 Episodes on 2 Discs, released June 29, 2010""These are the real cases of the Chicago Paranormal Detectives.""""Paranormal Cops"" consists of a group of four cops who get together in the evenings and take on cases of reported paranormal activity. They mostly try to get proof and figure out who the spirits are, but this is not Ghostbusters. They sometimes ask spirits politely to leave, but there is no exorcising going on which makes me wonder what the victims expect to happen when they ask for help.These ""police officers by day, paranormal cops by night"" will ""not rest till your case is closed."" They pray together before starting each job. The tortured victim is usually very happy to see the cops and joyfully describes hearing things or seeing things because they are on camera. The Paranormal Cops set up their equipment for the night to record sound and video. They walk around each area talking to each other and asking spirits questions. A person might occasionally jump like a spirit just ran through them. Moriah Rhame claims to be a medium with powers and lets the spirit's intent talk through her. Everything they learn about the spirits is siphoned through Moriah who gives all the details she is experiencing from them.Honestly, there is nothing at all scary about this show. If anything, it is mildly amusing to see these people earnestly walking around trying to collect proof. ""Did you see that?"" ""No."" ""Did you hear that?"" ""What did you hear?"" If the dust is undisturbed, that clearly means a ghost is prowling, not that the person was mistaken with what they saw. They rarely catch usable or convincing audio or visual footage, so it is more boring than anything else unfortunately. I wouldn't recommend picking this one up.Bonus Features:There is additional footage from the episodes. All significant events were put into the episodes so most of this additional footage is just walking around in that green light some more and debating what is going on.",1,There is nothing ghostly about what these cops are doing,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,2013,"['Paranormal', 'CopsThe', 'Complete', 'Season', 'One6', 'Episodes', '2', 'Discs', 'released', 'June', '29', '2010', 'are', 'real', 'cases', 'Chicago', 'Paranormal', 'Detectives', 'Paranormal', 'Cops', 'group', 'four', 'cops', 'who', 'get', 'together', 'evenings', 'take', 'cases', 'reported', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'mostly', 'try', 'get', 'proof', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'spirits', 'are', 'not', 'Ghostbusters', 'sometimes', 'ask', 'spirits', 'politely', 'leave', 'exorcising', 'going', 'wonder', 'what', 'victims', 'expect', 'happen', 'when', 'ask', 'help.These', 'police', 'officers', 'day', 'paranormal', 'cops', 'night', 'will', 'not', 'rest', 'till', 'case', 'closed', 'pray', 'together', 'starting', 'job', 'tortured', 'victim', 'usually', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'cops', 'joyfully', 'describes', 'hearing', 'things', 'seeing', 'things', 'are', 'camera', 'Paranormal', 'Cops', 'set', 'up', 'equipment', 'night', 'record', 'sound', 'video', 'walk', 'area', 'talking', 'other', 'asking', 'spirits', 'questions', 'person', 'might', 'occasionally', 'jump', 'spirit', 'just', 'ran', 'Moriah', 'Rhame', 'be', 'medium', 'powers', 'spirit', 'intent', 'talk', 'Everything', 'learn', 'spirits', 'siphoned', 'Moriah', 'who', 'details', 'experiencing', 'them.Honestly', 'nothing', 'scary', 'show', 'anything', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'see', 'people', 'earnestly', 'walking', 'around', 'trying', 'collect', 'proof', 'Did', 'see', 'Did', 'hear', 'What', 'did', 'hear', 'dust', 'undisturbed', 'clearly', 'ghost', 'prowling', 'not', 'person', 'was', 'mistaken', 'what', 'saw', 'rarely', 'catch', 'usable', 'convincing', 'audio', 'visual', 'footage', 'more', 'boring', 'anything', 'else', 'unfortunately', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'picking', 'one', 'up.Bonus', 'Features', 'additional', 'footage', 'episodes', 'significant', 'events', 'were', 'put', 'episodes', 'most', 'additional', 'footage', 'just', 'walking', 'around', 'green', 'light', 'more', 'debating', 'what', 'going']",N/A
