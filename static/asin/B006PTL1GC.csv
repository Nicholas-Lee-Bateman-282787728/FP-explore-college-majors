1518864,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B006PTL1GC,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 9]","A domestic affair between a Victorian Era (or slightly after) mental doctor and patient that happened to have a great affect on the development of the pseudo-science called ""psychology"" sounds interesting. This film is kind of boring, tedious, arguably miscast (Fassbender is solid as Jung) and the cgi backgrounds are fake looking too. Also, I desired a more penetrating script probing the philosophical differences between the mystical yearning Jung and Freud's desire for everyone's insanity to revolve around genitalia. Which he thought could be more scientifically respectable psychoanalytical work than exploring witchcraft and the occult. Cronenberg is an old man now and old men usually don't shoot more impressively better movies than when they were young, working hard for success, rising talents.I read Christoph Waltz was initially cast as Sigmund Freud, but was replaced by Viggo Mortensen due to a scheduling conflict. Christian Bale was ""in talks to play Carl Jung, but he too had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts"". And.. the role of Sabina Spielrein in the screenplay was written for Julia Roberts, who I think would've been more interesting, especially if teamed with the previous two actors(!!). In any case Roberts has played a sex worker (and what's the difference between paying a shrink and paying for sex other than the latter probably isn't a rip-off).When watching this film I thought it would've worked better, much better, and simply made more sense, as a play. Turns out a play called ""The Talking Cure"" at the Royal National Theater was made into this movie, basically. Ralph Fiennes (of archetypal villain- Voldemort notoriety played Jung-Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 7"" Series 2 Voldemort Action Figure). I recall Derek Jarman'sWittgenstein (Special Edition)and believe Jarman's approach would have worked better for this play about Freud, Jung and a freaky Russian chick. Jarman's approach to his subject was more captivating and consisted in a few intelligently selected props, good costumes and a perfect cast all shot in close-up indoors with pitch black background and the dialog.",2,videodrone,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2135,"['domestic', 'affair', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'slightly', 'mental', 'doctor', 'patient', 'happened', 'have', 'great', 'affect', 'development', 'pseudo-science', 'called', 'psychology', 'interesting', 'film', 'kind', 'boring', 'tedious', 'arguably', 'miscast', 'Fassbender', 'solid', 'Jung', 'cgi', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'fake', 'looking', 'too', 'Also', 'desired', 'more', 'penetrating', 'script', 'probing', 'philosophical', 'differences', 'mystical', 'yearning', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'desire', 'everyone', 'insanity', 'revolve', 'around', 'genitalia', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'scientifically', 'respectable', 'psychoanalytical', 'work', 'exploring', 'witchcraft', 'occult', 'Cronenberg', 'old', 'man', 'now', 'old', 'men', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'more', 'impressively', 'better', 'movies', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'working', 'hard', 'success', 'rising', 'talents.I', 'read', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'was', 'initially', 'cast', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'was', 'replaced', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'due', 'scheduling', 'conflict', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'was', 'talks', 'play', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'too', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'scheduling', 'conflicts', 'And..', 'role', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'who', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'especially', 'teamed', 'previous', 'two', 'actors', 'case', 'Roberts', 'played', 'sex', 'worker', 'what', 'difference', 'paying', 'shrink', 'paying', 'sex', 'other', 'latter', 'probably', ""n't"", 'rip-off', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'better', 'much', 'better', 'simply', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'play', 'out', 'play', 'called', 'Talking', 'Cure', 'Royal', 'National', 'Theater', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'basically', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'archetypal', 'villain-', 'Voldemort', 'notoriety', 'played', 'Jung-Harry', 'Potter', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', '7', 'Series', '2', 'Voldemort', 'Action', 'Figure', 'recall', 'Derek', ""Jarman'sWittgenstein"", 'Special', 'Edition', 'believe', 'Jarman', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'play', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'freaky', 'Russian', 'chick', 'Jarman', 'approach', 'subject', 'was', 'more', 'captivating', 'consisted', 'few', 'intelligently', 'selected', 'props', 'good', 'costumes', 'perfect', 'cast', 'shot', 'close-up', 'indoors', 'pitch', 'black', 'background', 'dialog']",N/A
1518865,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B006PTL1GC,a gentle sound,"[4, 5]","Last evening I watched the film.I have read Freud and Jung. Not completely, perhaps before I really understood either, not that I can understand either-but I mean to say I read them in connection to my work in art and my interest in creativity in my twenties. I have read biographies of their lives as well. So -the interest in this content was already there for me. They don't have to sell it-if I could I'd visit all the places of their lives. Learn more, read more. I would like to own The Red Book in reproduction actually. So I've wanted to see this movie since I saw a preview in the theater. It is the story of Jung early in his career, his relationship with Freud and their break, and a woman (Sabina Spielrein) who was Jung's first psychoanalytic patient. She apparently factored in this break in ways I did not know, nor have I ever read or heard of. In a way this was almost deflating-how could I have missed such stuff? (The acting of the three main characters btw was fascinating and unlike what I would have pictured- if pressed to explain I would respond that neither of them (Jung or Freud) had I pictured in this cerebral, refined, rather finished gentle way-and that the actress seemed to struggle almost with Tourette's or some straightjacket the rest of us couldn't see which was I hope both a liberty and a device meant to stand for the distancing mental illness produces-it achieved that effect)The role of this first psychoanalytic patient in Jung's life trajectory seems immense- as told here- I recall somewhere in my reading someone who was an analysist, perhaps Jung, talking of how that 1st patient is so important and thus so memorable-then I would imagine kept alive in their work rather like I will always recall the first class I taught. Not being in the field I can only relate through my lens of perception. Perhaps I missed that they became sexually involved-he and his 1st patient- in what I have read. That shocked me. I didn't even realize how she went on to be such an incredible contributor in psychoanalysis,was his assistant,then taking psychoanalysis to Russia, and herself by then a psychiatrist. That he lent her such a role in his work-certainly as talking partner- made me think of a mirror-I'm sorry -it just did. And my brief fleeting thought was I bet he had many. It was fascinating to learn of all of this.I recently have been talking and thinking about the death instinct and the creative life force in male intimacy- reading about it-to so quickly be directed to the root of the formulation of this theory via the person he analyzed and her contribution of this to the work they developed- struck me as quite a coincidence-I began reading him because I wanted to better understand creative drives as well as surviving abuse within creativity,The movie also explores triangulation- actually that as much as anything else-and I have no idea if that is accurately what happened. Triangulation is everywhere in it. Infidelity, love, needs, the nature of repression, rejection, wounds, truth, psychiatry, boundaries, healing, sexuality, historical perspectives, evolution of ideas, science and myth, individuation-a host of themes touched upon.I think a woman's need for the healing force of two of the greatest psychiatrists that ever lived indicates really the amazing person this girl was-or they were. For basically they both took her seriously and in their own way cared for her.My thought was sexualizing the relationship with Jung-mistake, but at least the movie bears that out false for both of them. Ultimately her fulfillment as a doctor healing her. There are things here I haven't yet worked out, and places where thins get too close to my own stuff for me to work it out easily.And if this plot line isn't the revealing of the nature of triangles what would that be?They are prey to their feelings in this movie, to their actions, to the dominate themes of the time, science versus mysticism for instance is discussed,  they analyze everything, they look at their histories, they explore their dream contents, they adjust the thinking,they deny, they hide truths, they reveal, they are human, they sort through the dynamics of their living-looking at what is driving them. Time figures in the story. It touches on how Freud and Jung were not the same in orientation, how the dynamics between them revealed both of their weaknesses. Especially Jung-who seems seen by Freud.I suppose in the end what struck me was their bravery to face their feelings, continue trying-even when Jung is basically just portrayed here as a coward in his relationship to Sabina- and in his marriage-a coward- that likes the wife's money- still they are present with one another.Imperfections shown. Their importance to one another is presented in what must have been some sticky stuff.In this way the movie becomes rather like the opening up to discussion in repressive times of what a woman might want, what the effect of the times might breed for such an intelligent woman, to be so desired and yet to move forward and develop not as a subordinate or object alone- and finally it seems to hold her own intellectually-that was interesting. Sabina Spielrein clearly was greatly wounded, a healer herself, and these three great individuals are placed within their times dynamics one hopes accurately, you hope- so we can see the development of their methods in analysis fairly. (She will later be shot with her children,by the Nazi's which was a tragic thing to read in the last brief notes- the men having fuller careers-but all shaped by times foreshadowed here with Jung's apocalyptic dream.)It's a love story, it's a loss story, it's a growth story, it's actually perhaps an intellectual and historical journey as well.(I could have done without the spanking scenes, but I think that's because they seemed so privacy invading, impossible, and suggestive of titillating-and would scandalize about a half of the folks that might happen upon the movie. And I doubt them. I understood them within the context of displaying the unbounded nature of their relationship and exploration of the destructive force of sexuality she had in play from childhood-in the notion of their exploration of taboo subjects-but it came across grossly)So essentially Jung had an affaire with a patient, with a first patient, and I suppose that's pretty significant to understand in his evolution, that his work was as much about his own insights into self as patients health-as his process. I saw in the movie at times the flashes of their equality, the wounds within him, the strange compartment for his wife, the triangulation over Sabina with Freud, Also with his wife and work,  Sabina's role in their split (Jung/Freud which I have never heard before in anything I've read), (reading later of her fate after the movie)-at least for me a movie abruptly ended....it is all grist for the mill....I think the movie distorts the man-super normalizing him here via a very sweet performance, but...I never pictured Jung so wealthy either, but I knew that his wife was wealthy, nor him so beautiful and in such magnificently beautiful surroundings, so in the movie this felt false against my inner eye -distant and perfected or idealized-definitely idealized, tribute like- but looking at pictures later I thought perhaps this was carefully considered -certainly the quotes used as dialog throughout the movie were placed in key moments to stay with you directly from the letters.. I revise those images to move him even further from things I can understand-the luxury and station of his life...but surely there would be some quibbling about Carl Jung as seen here.And finally, this was a relationship that their letters revealed and it was a movie based upon them. One of the fantasies or  themes of my life was a wish to have such intimacy with others through writing and experiences, to know such a closeness, to share feelings, insights, the stuff of life with another in that way-clearly these letters were the correspondence of three people that took the time, knew the significance, allowed the relating in this form to connect them. There are several movies that I love in which letters are the basis of the movie. The Anne Bancroft one with the bookseller-The Turtle Diaries among them. It would seem that these movies deeply affect me. They represent something for me- the deep connection in word. Somehow in my fantasy, or my conceptions of love, of the secrets inside us-letters, correspondence, the revealing-it is a piece of why this movie worked for me-perhaps psychologically.How different a movie it might have been had these men simply rejected Sabina Spielrein, denied her importance to them, never written another word to her in their fear of scandal, and simply we were left with none of these records. It would seem they put the thing to pen because they were brave enough to at least on some level face and work through it -that seems such an act of care and love.Interesting

With that kind of pedigree and its provocative subject matter, A Dangerous Method picked up some early awards buzz that unfortunately burned off by the time the Oscars came around, though Mortensen did pick up a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the Golden Globes.

1518867,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B006PTL1GC,Andrew Desmond,"[2, 3]","I was quite underwhelmed by ""A Dangerous Method"".  I am firmly of the view that the fame attaching to the film has preceded it.  I expected more and came away disappointed.The movie covers the overlapping in the lives of the two of the 20th century's great minds, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  The cause of their meeting was, ostensibly, one of Jung's patients, a wealthy Russian Jewess, Sabrina Spielrein.  She comes to Jung in an extremely distressed state after having been institutionalised.  It is here that the acting is first rate.  Keira Knightly plays Spielrein and is extremely plausible.  It is not an easy task to convince the audience of madness.  Knightly succeeds totally.In the course of her sessions with Jung, the two become sexually involved.  This is, of course, contrary to accepted protocols.  Jung is aware of this and is deeply conflicted. The fact that his wife is pregnant at the time only serves to heighten the emotional conflict that is running through Jung.  Freud is also unhappy with his behaviour.The essence of the film is the interplay of these three main characters.  Unfortunately, the drama comes to no great heights.  It seems to end abruptly and the viewer is left feeling somewhat cheated.  This is a pity.  The film had more to offer.  It had an excellent cast with a fascinating subject to explore.",2,Underwhelmed,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,1341,"['was', 'quite', 'underwhelmed', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'am', 'firmly', 'view', 'fame', 'attaching', 'film', 'preceded', 'expected', 'more', 'came', 'away', 'disappointed.The', 'movie', 'overlapping', 'lives', 'two', '20th', 'century', 'great', 'minds', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'cause', 'meeting', 'was', 'ostensibly', 'one', 'Jung', 'patients', 'wealthy', 'Russian', 'Jewess', 'Sabrina', 'Spielrein', 'Jung', 'extremely', 'distressed', 'state', 'having', 'been', 'institutionalised', 'here', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Spielrein', 'extremely', 'plausible', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'convince', 'audience', 'madness', 'Knightly', 'totally.In', 'course', 'sessions', 'Jung', 'two', 'become', 'sexually', 'involved', 'course', 'contrary', 'accepted', 'protocols', 'Jung', 'aware', 'deeply', 'conflicted', 'fact', 'wife', 'pregnant', 'time', 'only', 'heighten', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'running', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'also', 'unhappy', 'behaviour.The', 'essence', 'film', 'interplay', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'drama', 'great', 'heights', 'end', 'abruptly', 'viewer', 'left', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'cheated', 'pity', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'offer', 'had', 'excellent', 'cast', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'explore']",N/A
1518868,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B006PTL1GC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","There have been accusations heaped upon `A Dangerous Method'; that it is too kinky.  It's not.  There have been accusations on Keira's performance; that it is too over the top.  It's not.  No, the kinky nature of the film is far tamer than the initial trailer and or mere synopsis would have you believe, and all of Miss Knightley's jaw jutting theatrics fit perfectly in tone with her character; the real life Sabina Spielrein and thus feel naturalized and appropriate.Sadly, debunking these accusations doesn't make `A Dangerous Method' any better of a film.David Cronenberg is a director I have a hard time with.  He's just not as consistent as I'd like him to be.  I loved his 80's work, but I find that a lot of his more acclaimed recent fare has been stilted for me, rather bland and just not entirely thought through.  `A Dangerous Method' suffers from that.  The film just hangs there, without much to make it truly engrossing or compelling, and this is a shock when you consider the dynamics involved here.  This should have been a ravishing tale, yet it just feels so stagnant.  Even the kinky sex scenes feel restrained in a way that doesn't add to the sophistication of the picture (this period genre is far different that standard Cronenberg fare, and thus I assume he was shooting for Oscar here) but instead give it a dull varnish.Fassbender delivers his weakest performance of the year, yet Mortensen is gold and Knightley proves yet again that the haters can hate all they want, but she is a great actress.Still, `A Dangerous Method' is missing that spark.

1518878,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B006PTL1GC,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","I think this was an exceptional and brilliant film and give it 5 stars, but I have been reading the work of Freud and Jung for thirty years and I think that many people unfamiliar with the history of psychoanalysis would find this film too complex and dense to be enjoyed. That is a shame since the themes explored are fascinating and the acting was first rate. But the bottom line is that this is a film that will appeal to a limited audience of intellectual viewers.The primary focus of the film was divided between the psychological struggles of a brilliant young woman and the sexual and intellectual struggles of a brilliant psychologist attempting to forge a model of human consciousness and unconsciousness while at the mercy of his own desires and impulses. A secondary theme was the professional scientific and personal relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carol Jung over a 7 year period critical to the development of the field of psychoanalysis.Carl Jung was very familiar with the work of Sigmund Freud and began writing to him about there mutual interests in abnormal psychology. But the two men were very different in many ways and these differences eventually lead to tension in their relationship. The film does a credible job of contrasting Freud, an Austrian Jewish physician, and the wealthy Jung, a privileged Swiss psychiatrist. Early in the film Jung begins to use Freud's method of analysis whereby the psychiatrists sits behind the patient so as to reduce projection onto the psychiatrist and to create a more ambiguous sensation for the patient so that they can actually focus on their own projections and images without looking to the therapist for approval or disapproval. Jung complains that Freud writes much about the intellectual side of the analysis without giving many details as to the actual implementation of the methodology, thus early in the film Jung's independent thought is demonstrated.Freud saw Sabrina Spielrein as a patient when she was 19 years old and published her case history as the case of Sabrina S. It is Emma Jung in the film who tells the viewer that surely this Sabrina S written about by Freud is the same Sabrina Spielrein who has been admitted to the psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Jung.Michael Fassbender does an outstanding job as he plays Carl Jung. The character of Jung is pivotal in this film and Jung is a brilliant but conflicted human being. Jung was an outstanding genius, comparable to the genius of Freud, but he loses his bearings when he begins an affair with Sabrina Spielrein. His attempts to gain control of himself and the relationship reveal his cold determination which Fassbender plays very well. Fassbender's athletic sexual physique appears to be ready to explode out of the tight Victorian clothing that binds him much as Jung's sexuality is exploding out of his overly controlled intellect. Jung may appear overly harsh, controlled and rejecting as he ends the affair with Spielrein but he was becoming unhinged from the ground upon which he had built his personal, intellectual and professional life.Kira Knightly does a superb job of playing Sabrina Spielrein. Spielrein has neurotic tics that manifest when painful or conflicting memories emerge. The early scenes where Spielrein relates to Jung how often her father whipped her naked behind and then forced her to kiss his hand after the whipping are very powerful. As a child Spielrein would sometimes urinate in fear while being whipped and her father would whip her again for the urination. She now dreams of a catlike creature whispering into her ear as a slug like creature crawls on her lower back. Jung is able to connect that Spielrein would masturbate to images and memory of physical punishment and that pain had thus become eroticized for her. Knightly was able to portray mental illness, repressed eroticism and intellectual acuity in one outstanding performance.Vincent Cassel deserves mention for the part he plays as Dr. Otto Gross, another brilliant but unstable mind in an addict. However it is in conversation with the way-out Gross that Jung comes to terms with his passion for a brilliant and beautiful patient.Viggo Mortensen plays Sigmund Freud with careful understatement. Freud believed that in Jung he had finally found the champion, the heroic son, who would carry his theories forward. Much of their relationship in the film vibrates between a father-son relationship, a mentor-mentee relationship, and a professional competition. Of course the scene is included where Freud and Jung share dreams on the voyage to America and Freud tells Jung that one dream he can not reveal since he would lose his `authority' which Jung relates as the point where Freud lost all authority for him. It is to the film's credit that it includes the discussions between Freud and Jung on strategy whereby Freud wished their work to remain focused, concentrated, demonstrable, and repeatable whereas Jung was becoming more expansive, overly inclusive, and willing to explore paranormal experiences that are almost impossible to demonstrate or repeat under controlled conditions. Both strategies may advance scientific thought but the tensions eventually disrupt their personal and professional relationships.Eventually the tables turn as Spielrein emerges from her neurosis and becomes a brilliant psychoanalyst in her own right, mentored and complimented by Sigmund Freud.Thus this 99 minute films is about two complex themes; the development, expression, and repression of sexual desires as demonstrated in the relationship of Spielrein and Jung and the creation, translation and re-creation of complex scientific ideology as demonstrated in the relationship of Jung and Freud.",5,Intellectual film on sexual repression and desire,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,5740,"['think', 'was', 'exceptional', 'brilliant', 'film', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'have', 'been', 'reading',

1518879,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B006PTL1GC,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","A Dangerous Method doesn't delve as deeply into the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud as it could have, but is nevertheless, a solid effort from director David Cronenberg. Cronenberg is not known for his subtlety, but the more mature style on display here is nuanced, and if it could have delved deeper, it at least gets what it does show right for the most part.  Though fans of his previous films might miss the shock and awe of films like Scanners, his remake of The Fly, Crash (not the Oscar winner but a much more twisted tale starring James Spader), Naked Lunch or Dead Ringers (the absolute worst date movie ever made), Cronenberg is at least consistent in that his films are always very challenging, psychologically speaking. He is King of All Head Games.Carl Jung: Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable... just to be able to go on living.Michael Fassbender is Jung, and like the director, he could have gone deeper into Jung's more mystical, and some would say superstitious, theories, but presented more of a good doctor tempted by his attractive, but disturbed patient vibe. He wants to do the right thing, but how can you resist when you have Kiera Knightly throwing herself at you, and the Dangerous Method of therapy she begs for is the only thing that seems to provide her with relief?Sabina Spielrein: [to Jung] I want you to punish me.Kiera Knightly gives a very enthusiastic performance as Sabina Spielrein, but at first it almost went off the rails. Her character is Jung's patient, then Freud's patient, then she goes on to be a docter herself. She chewed the scenery a bit, but later, when she herself was a physician wanting to use what she had learned to cure other unfortunate souls, her performance was much better controlled and believable. She is also very easy on the eyes, and I get a sense that her career is on the verge of blowing up, big time. Same for Fassbender, who has nothing to be ashamed of, and was also in the much anticipated Prometheus.Also believable was Sarah Gadon as Jung's lovely wife, Emma, who not only provided him with a lovely family, but was also very rich, which gave the Jung doctor the luxury of pursuing his more esoteric objectives, such as Synchronicity, the Collective Subconscious, cultural and mythical archetypes, and the ancient wisdom unearthed in the I Ching, the Book of Changes. Another seminal character was Otto Gross, played by Vincent Cassel, who was a renegade doctor wanting to push the Dangerous Methods envelope even further, scoffing at the ethics forbidding patient doctor relations.Viggo Mortensen, as Freud, was as usual brilliant. Though Siggy tried to pass himself off as above it all, he was just as much in thrall to his libido as the rest of us. The fact that he had repressed his desires didn't mean they weren't still exerting their influence. I think that he said things like ""sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"" in order to give him a little closet to hide inside. He wasn't fooling anyone, and his frustrated need to be some kind of surrogate father figure for Jung was as much of a reason for their rift as any. Furthermore, some of his theories were just wrong, and he could have benefited immensely from Jung's ideas.Sigmund Freud: Experiences like this, however painful, are necessary and inevitable; without them, how can we know life?The Bottom Line is that A Dangerous Method could have delved a little deeper, but the excellent cast and sure footed direction made for a most entertaining film--one that would make a much better date movie than Dead Ringers. There are a few steamy risqu&eacute; scenes, but most of it is left up to the imagination, and there are also some tantalizing glimpses of great ideas and psychological insights, but these are, alas, also left mostly to the imagination.",5,Siggy CigarAsh and the Spiders From Mars,1341187200,"07 2, 2012",2012,3810,"['Dangerous', 'Method', ""n't"", 'delve', 'deeply', 'rift', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'could', 'have', 'nevertheless', 'solid', 'effort', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Cronenberg', 'not', 'known', 'subtlety', 'more', 'mature', 'style', 'display', 'here', 'nuanced', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'deeper', 'least', 'what', 'show', 'right', 'most', 'part', 'fans', 'previous', 'films', 'might', 'miss', 'shock', 'awe', 'films', 'Scanners', 'remake', 'Fly', 'Crash', 'not', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'much', 'more', 'twisted', 'tale', 'starring', 'James', 'Spader', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'absolute', 'worst', 'date', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Cronenberg', 'least', 'consistent', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'very', 'challenging', 'psychologically', 'speaking', 'King', 'All', 'Head', 'Games.Carl', 'Jung', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'do', 'something', 'unforgivable', 'just', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'living.Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Jung', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'deeper', 'Jung', 'more', 'mystical', 'would', 'say', 'superstitious', 'theories', 'presented', 'more', 'good', 'doctor', 'tempted', 'attractive', 'disturbed', 'patient', 'vibe', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'how', 'can', 'resist', 'when', 'have', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'throwing', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'therapy', 'only', 'thing', 'provide', 'relief', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', '[', 'Jung', ']', 'want', 'punish', 'me.Kiera', 'Knightly', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'first', 'almost', 'went', 'rails', 'character', 'Jung', 'patient', 'then', 'Freud', 'patient', 'then', 'be', 'docter', 'herself', 'chewed', 'scenery', 'bit', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'physician', 'wanting', 'use', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'cure', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'souls', 'performance', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'controlled', 'believable', 'also', 'very', 'easy', 'eyes', 'get', 'sense', 'career', 'verge', 'blowing', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'Same', 'Fassbender', 'who', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed', 'was', 'also', 'much', 'anticipated', 'Prometheus.Also', 'believable', 'was', 'Sarah', 'Gadon', 'Jung', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Emma', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'provided', 'lovely', 'family', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'rich', 'gave', 'Jung', 'doctor', 'luxury', 'pursuing', 'more', 'esoteric', 'objectives', 'such', 'Synchronicity', 'Collective', 'Subconscious', 'cultural', 'mythical', 'archetypes', 'ancient', 'wisdom', 'unearthed', 'Ching', 'Book', 'Changes', 'seminal', 'character', 'was', 'Otto', 'Gross', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'who', 'was', 'renegade', 'doctor', 'wanting', 'push', 'Dangerous', 'Methods', 'envelope', 'even', 'further', 'scoffing', 'ethics', 'forbidding', 'patient', 'doctor', 'relations.Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Freud', 'was', 'usual', 'brilliant', 'Siggy', 'tried', 'pass', 'off', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'thrall', 'libido', 'rest', 'fact', 'had', 'repressed', 'desires', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'were', ""n't"", 'still', 'exerting', 'influence', 'think', 'said', 'things', 'sometimes', 'cigar', 'just', 'cigar', 'order', 'give', 'little', 'closet', 'hide', 'inside', 'was', ""n't"", 'fooling', 'anyone', 'frustrated', 'need', 'be', 'kind', 'surrogate', 'father', 'figure', 'Jung', 'was', 'much', 'reason', 'rift', 'Furthermore', 'theories', 'were', 'just', 'wrong', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'immensely', 'Jung', 'ideas.Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Experiences', 'however', 'painful', 'are', 'necessary', 'inevitable', 'how', 'can', 'know', 'life', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'could', 'have', 'delved', 'little', 'deeper', 'excellent', 'cast', 'sure', 'footed', 'direction', 'made', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'date', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'are', 'few', 'steamy', 'risqu', 'eacute', 'scenes', 'most', 'left', 'up', 'imagination', 'are', 'also', 'tantalizing', 'glimpses', 'great', 'ideas', 'psychological', 'insights', 'are', 'alas', 'also', 'left', 'mostly', 'imagination']",N/A
1518880,AB34G6VKP28L,B006PTL1GC,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[1, 2]","Following the progression of thought in the minds of three psychologists in the Edwardian era, A Dangerous Method is an intriguing film about not entirely likable individuals that raises some interesting thoughts on morality and repression.No one quite knows what to do with Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley). Her keen mind has been overcome with sporadic fits and hallucinations, which lands her in the mental hospital where Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is employed. She proves a fascinating subject, and one that prompts him to consult well-known psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortenson) for his opinion. Over the years, as Sabina improves under sexual therapy, Jung finds his idealistic views of morality challenged through another associate, who believes that monogamy is unnatural and nothing should ever be repressed. But his eventual relationship with Sabina will do more than threaten his reputation... it will also begin to dismantle his precarious relationship with Freud.This is a fascinating movie on many levels, as it explores the hypocritical nature of humankind and at times impresses us with its psychological conclusions and at others makes us smile a bit in their far-reaching explanations. The obsession that Jung has with dreams reveals a lot about his inner motivations and fears, but quite early on we understand that while common interests bring them together, elements of pride will keep Jung and Freud apart. Jung is offended to be the mentored, and Freud cannot confide in them, leaving an unequal friendship certain to implode. In the midst of this sits Sabina, who when we first meet her is contorting her face inside a carriage and then much later, becomes a successful psychologist in the field.Casting on this is utterly delightful. Keira in particular turns in an exquisite performance that requires a large amount of physical manipulation. It is both fascinating and painful for an audience to watch, as a woman struggles with expressing her internal emotions. Fassbender is an adequate Jung, and if his intention was to make me dislike the man, he did it perfectly. It's unusual to enter a movie about Jung and come out liking Freud more, but that is what happened. Viggo is brilliant in the role, vanishing into it so completely that at times I forgot he was acting. You can see the richness of the Edwardian period in the lush costumes and settings, some of which are particularly exquisite. It also has a beautiful musical score and real intelligence in its screenplay.I did not see most of the harsher content, but the film does earn its R-rating for sexual material and nudity. I was left to enjoy the richness of the production and the intellectual scope of the script, one that combines social prejudices and our desire to know what alters our behavior, but also the emptiness of Jung's life.",3,Intellectual & Sad,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2843,"['Following', 'progression', 'thought', 'minds', 'three', 'psychologists', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'intriguing', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'likable', 'individuals', 'interesting', 'thoughts', 'morality', 'repression.No', 'one', 'quite', 'what', 'do', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'keen', 'mind', 'been', 'overcome', 'sporadic', 'fits', 'hallucinations', 'mental', 'hospital', 'where', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'employed', 'fascinating', 'subject', 'one', 'consult', 'well-known', 'psycho-analyst', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Viggo', 'Mortenson', 'opinion', 'years', 'Sabina', 'sexual', 'therapy', 'Jung', 'idealistic', 'views', 'morality', 'challenged', 'associate', 'who', 'monogamy', 'unnatural', 'nothing', 'should', 'ever', 'be', 'repressed', 'eventual', 'relationship', 'Sabina', 'will', 'do', 'more', 'threaten', 'reputation', 'will', 'also', 'begin', 'dismantle', 'precarious', 'relationship', 'Freud.This', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'hypocritical', 'nature', 'humankind', 'times', 'impresses', 'psychological', 'conclusions', 'others', 'smile', 'bit', 'far-reaching', 'explanations', 'obsession', 'Jung', 'dreams', 'reveals', 'lot', 'inner', 'motivations', 'fears', 'quite', 'early', 'understand', 'common', 'interests', 'bring', 'together', 'elements', 'pride', 'will', 'keep', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'apart', 'Jung', 'offended', 'be', 'mentored', 'Freud', 'can', 'not', 'confide', 'leaving', 'unequal', 'friendship', 'certain', 'implode', 'midst', 'Sabina', 'who', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'contorting', 'face', 'carriage', 'then', 'much', 'later', 'successful', 'psychologist', 'field.Casting', 'utterly', 'delightful', 'Keira', 'particular', 'turns', 'exquisite', 'performance', 'large', 'amount', 'physical', 'manipulation', 'fascinating', 'painful', 'audience', 'watch', 'woman', 'expressing', 'internal', 'emotions', 'Fassbender', 'adequate', 'Jung', 'intention', 'was', 'make', 'dislike', 'man', 'did', 'perfectly', 'unusual', 'enter', 'movie', 'Jung', 'come', 'out', 'liking', 'Freud', 'more', 'what', 'happened', 'Viggo', 'brilliant', 'role', 'vanishing', 'so', 'completely', 'times', 'forgot', 'was', 'acting', 'can', 'see', 'richness', 'Edwardian', 'period', 'lush', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'particularly', 'exquisite', 'also', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'score', 'real', 'intelligence', 'screenplay.I', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'most', 'harsher', 'content', 'film', 'earn', 'R-rating', 'sexual', 'material', 'nudity', 'was', 'left', 'enjoy', 'richness', 'production', 'intellectual', 'scope', 'script', 'one', 'social', 'prejudices', 'desire', 'know', 'what', 'behavior', 'also', 'emptiness', 'Jung', 'life']",N/A

I mean -- it's GOTTA be!  Ya'all get POINTS just for trying!Ugh.ACTUALLY: Under the creakiness of such a premise (one feels, as one often does in these situations, that the diegesis/narrative tension is all but a weight on you while ""submitting"" yourself to it, more ponderous than any high school/college lecturer bore could ever've been), one feels so chastened that one's ability to ""like"" the film on one's own initiative is all but completed squashed (""How DARE you think differently!  How DARE you not 'grapple' with this!"" etc., etc.), making it an act of prolonged ethical/artistic cowardice since, y'know ... ""success"" is ""guarranteed""!Meanwhile, to sum up, here's what you (actually) get:-- verisimilitudinousness (now THERE's a word for ya!) layered in such a thick, mortar-around-bricks sort of way that the effect is, oddly, implausible.  One gets the sense that -- ha ha -- EVERY FRICKIN' LINE in the movie (or, like, almost) actually ""happened"" and the whole shebang was just sandwiched together to fit in a 2 hrs. plus-or-minus running time and insure ""inescapable plausibility.""  But -- and here's the real ""but"" -- for those of us whom (either in an academic setting or, perhance, out of our own ""self-starting"" curiousity) have happened across ANY of the real Freud and/or Jung's writings these characterizations strike one as ... ""off.""  Like they didn't care to capture them, exactly: just the ""Icon"" status the viewers is all but forced to ""submit"" to.  (Most film critics, curiously or not, seem unaware of this -- or, more likely, unable to PERCEIVE this.  Well, you don't HAVE to read Freud and/or Jung -- EVER -- to NECESSARILY be a ""well-rounded"" person [I suppose] ... but, if you're just going to ""show up"" at the film that's ""handed to you"" and just start off as a matter-of-course with something like ""Oh yeah, of course: Freud and Jung!  Totally!  I get it!"" you're either going to: (1.) miss much or (2.) catch little, however you want to put it!)-- a rather horrific culture-wide precedent set herein; specifically, the scene where the very-adept actress Keira Knightley is instructed to -- front & center -- replicate ""madness"" [compulsive, labored switching, for our viewing pleasure] which none-too-many viewers, not aware of Cronenberg's madness [he's totally NOT gay, in case you were wondering!] may not have ""protected"" themselves from, by shutting their eyes during that scene and ""keeping it out"" of their heads [YOU didn't do this, did you?  Too bad!].  Knowing that there are, in fact, people in Psyche Wards who are TRULY unhinged -- and not just there for the convenience of their ""concerned"" relatives or Pfizer & Co.'s or the psychiatric ""profession"" as practiced by (mostly) M.D.'s nowadays -- but have, in fact, fallen down such a DEEP ""internal well"" that just being NEAR them can compromise your ability, to soon-therafter ... well ... let's just say some things aren't so easily ""shaken off"" and leave it at that, okay?  [That is, unless you believe ""culture shock"" is a MYTH, or are otherwise not fit for post-6th grade life without pseudo-bravadoic ""scoffing"" at anything LARGER than yourself -- yeah, GOOD LUCK with THAT!]Soooo ... some several-times-several months [maybe sixteen? twenty-seven? I forget . . . ] after ""Adbusters"" first ran a series limning the ""leakage"" of the so-called ""torture porn"" [well ... you gotta call it SUMPTHIN', dontcha?] into mainstream culture/advertising/network T.V. programs [yah: those are some real great ""kicks"" to start foisting off on the kids!], ""Interview"" magazine -- catching the ""slow down and run backwards"" pull of this film -- has run (in its current issue) a ""fashionably institutionalized"" spread in its pages ... as though drooling, incontinence, and (perhaps) unrecoverable-from psychic trauma is ""alluring"" ... great!  Just great!  (Like that would've EVER happened without ""deep"" Croneyberg propping alluring, competent & magnetic Keira in front of a 35mm camera for our viewing pleasure ... again: terrific!)-- lastly, making a ""20/20 hindsight"" effort along these lines would, in fact, be USEFUL if one didn't lose track of that fact that we all, nowadays, are similarly ""bound"" ... rather than, say, just looking back -- safely ensconced in our ""knowing-better,"" modern perspective -- and going ""DEEP!"" for the duration of the movie.But, of course, that last would actually entail:[1.] Drawing parallels in the then-current, post-Industrial Revolution, pre-World Wars world-stage (rather just tacking on an ""inexplicable""/""inevitable""/""helpless ground-level view"" epilogue; you know, those WORLD WARS just, like, ""happened""!) that were just then becoming barely possible before becoming horrifically smashed by the ""momentums"" beyond the horizon (i.e., Bram Stoker's ""The Illustrated Dracula (Penguin Illustrated Classics),"" itself both a deep meditation on psyche/physical body/materia interaction and an allegory of Old World resentments clawing their way into the English-speaking world's ""plentitude"") -- and, like you know, the OTHER FILM stuff being done, at the time (Cronenberg apparently expects us to ignore/have never heard of the work of Bunuel/Dali like ""Un Chien Andalou,"" subjecting us, instead, to a ""Masterpiece Theater"" rendering of how these silly people -- ""pot kettle black"" -- couldn't quite keep all their insights in line!).  When Andre Breton -- founder of Surrealism, and considered an ""abandoner"" of his French brethren for fleeing the continent during W.W.I.I. -- came back with his ""Arcanum 17 (Green Integer)"" prose-poem, CORRECTLY assessing the hatred of the female/intuitive that overwhelmed the Western Civilized world, we all were granted a ""reprieve"" from ""not-knowing"" what to make of it.  A marker.  A signpost.But, hey: Cronenberg doesn't take ""art"" THAT seriously, does it?  (Again, kids: it's not 1950.  You don't get to PULL THIS CRAP if you haven't DONE YOUR RESEARCH!)Sorry, Dave: you get an ""F""![2.] Ever since David Lynch made ""Lost Highway"" [1997] and Richard Linklater made ""Waking Life"" [2001], the ""ante"" has been ""upped"" -- and the ""possibilities,"" for that matter -- for making ""idea films"": experiencially, neither one-nor-the-other, neither sitting through ""ideas"" being expounded like a Stanley Kramer movie or a George Bernard Shaw play, nor ""film transpositions"" that have no THEORY you're supposed to ""get,"" y'know, in your ""head,"" OUTSIDE the film ... (whatsamatter, Dave?  Didn'tcha ""get the memo,"" or somethin'?)[3.]  Freud MADE the ""psyche"" a tenable concept, freeing it from being a slave to Organized Religion (which, of course: few had the ""inner liberty,"" previous to then, to CONCEIVE of, without) or something artists KNEW about, but had trouble ""articulating"" (given the all-too-understandable skepticism by most other folks without said experience responded with towards such conjecture), which is why HIS ""margin of error"" is, given the times, entirely his OWN -- not OURS!  (Ours, of course, is personified by/has been established by Swiss Psychologst Alice Miller, whose unwaveringly & unflinchingly levelheaded ""The Untouched Key: Tracing Childhood Trauma in Creativity and Destructiveness"" ""cashed out"" Friedrich Nietzsche as a never-grown-up lifelong emotional cripple whose ""&Uuml;bermensch""/master race concept bore real fruit in the atrocities practiced on the Hereros in Africa, and, later, on the European Jewry in Germany ... oh, I'm sorry -- didn't you know?

It's just bizarre to think that fans of any sort of film genre could hate, dislike, or not care for anything in Cronenberg's genre-spanning repertoire. He's a pretty versatile director and dabbles in a little bit of everything while leaving his fingerprints and trademarks all over everything he's a part of. Videodrome, The Fly, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, and Spider are a few personal favorites. With that said, A Dangerous Method more than likely won't be considered one of his best but is still a very solid effort overall.The entire film feels like an acting vehicle with Keira Knightley firmly in control of the driver's seat. Viggo Mortensen isn't really around much at all and his performance is the most forgetful of the three leads. His performance is still fairly engaging, but it pales in comparison to his co-stars and even his performance in his last film with Cronenberg Eastern Promises. Michael Fassbender does let his talent slip through his rather wooden-feeling performance at times. Carl Jung (Fassbender) and Sigmund Freud (Mortensen) are the two main scientific minds of the film and being know-it-all, emotionless drones is practically expected and kind of natural to think of when a scientist comes to mind. Fassbender at least shows signs of emotion and it's almost as if you can see the wheels turning in his head before he speaks at times, but Keira Knightley steals the show. Her facial expressions, body language, and hand gestures are just phenomenal and almost inhuman. I've never seen someone's teeth used to be so expressive before and her Russian accent isn't too shabby either. It'd be kind of a tragedy if Knightley isn't at least nominated for an Oscar after this.The film becomes notorious for the repetitive way certain scenes are shot. Two characters would be in frame, one in the background and one in the foreground (usually a close-up), and it would only last for a few lines of dialogue. It was a simple idea yet was visually intriguing and the technique usually made the shot more memorable because of it. There's also a scene near the end of the film with a discussion between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) sitting by the lake. It's mostly absent of background music other than some piano that creeps in later on in the scene, but hearing the sounds of the lake during their conversation made it a little more spectacular.A Dangerous Method is set during World War I and is about how Freud and Jung developed psychoanalysis at its core, but is driven by the masochistic affair that develops between Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein. Their intimate scenes are usually fairly disturbing and incredibly emotional. They're practically the heart and soul of the film. There are also a handful of one-liners that are sure to stick with you long after the journey ends. (""Little do they know we're bringing them the plague."")A Dangerous Method is a little unnerving at times, but is very tame in comparison to nearly everything else Cronenberg has done. Keira Knightley is absolutely outstanding. A Dangerous Method is a well-written and intelligent drama that is powerful and superbly acted with just the right amount of discomforting material to keep you fascinated until those final credits roll.",4,Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable just to be able to go on living,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,3308,"['Does', 'anybody', 'actually', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'just', 'bizarre', 'think', 'fans', 'sort', 'film', 'genre', 'could', 'hate', 'dislike', 'not', 'care', 'anything', 'Cronenberg', 'genre-spanning', 'repertoire', 'pretty', 'versatile', 'director', 'dabbles', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'leaving', 'fingerprints', 'trademarks', 'everything', 'part', 'Videodrome', 'Fly', 'Dead', 'Ringers', 'Naked', 'Lunch', 'Spider', 'are', 'few', 'personal', 'favorites', 'said', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'more', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'still', 'very', 'solid', 'effort', 'overall.The', 'entire', 'film', 'feels', 'acting', 'vehicle', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'firmly', 'control', 'driver', 'seat', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', ""n't"", 'really', 'around', 'much', 'performance', 'most', 'forgetful', 'three', 'leads', 'performance', 'still', 'fairly', 'engaging', 'comparison', 'co-stars', 'even', 'performance', 'last', 'film', 'Cronenberg', 'Eastern', 'Promises', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'let', 'talent', 'slip', 'rather', 'wooden-feeling', 'performance', 'times', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Fassbender', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Mortensen', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'scientific', 'minds', 'film', 'being', 'know-it-all', 'emotionless', 'drones', 'practically', 'expected', 'kind', 'natural', 'think', 'when', 'scientist', 'mind', 'Fassbender', 'least', 'shows', 'signs', 'emotion', 'almost', 'can', 'see', 'wheels', 'turning', 'head', 'times', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'show', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'hand', 'gestures', 'are', 'just', 'phenomenal', 'almost', 'inhuman', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'someone', 'teeth', 'used', 'be', 'so', 'expressive', 'Russian', 'accent', ""n't"", 'too', 'shabby', 'either', ""'d"", 'be', 'kind', 'tragedy', 'Knightley', ""n't"", 'least', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'this.The', 'film', 'notorious', 'repetitive', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'Two', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'frame', 'one', 'background', 'one', 'foreground', 'usually', 'close-up', 'would', 'only', 'last', 'few', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'was', 'simple', 'idea', 'yet', 'was', 'visually', 'intriguing', 'technique', 'usually', 'made', 'shot', 'more', 'memorable', 'also', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'discussion', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'Knightley', 'sitting', 'lake', 'mostly', 'absent', 'background', 'music', 'other', 'piano', 'later', 'scene', 'hearing', 'sounds', 'lake', 'conversation', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'spectacular.A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'how', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'developed', 'psychoanalysis', 'core', 'driven', 'masochistic', 'affair', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'are', 'usually', 'fairly', 'disturbing', 'incredibly', 'emotional', ""'re"", 'practically', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'handful', 'one-liners', 'are', 'sure', 'stick', 'long', 'journey', 'Little', 'do', 'know', ""'re"", 'bringing', 'plague', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'little', 'unnerving', 'times', 'very', 'tame', 'comparison', 'nearly', 'everything', 'else', 'Cronenberg', 'done', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'absolutely', 'outstanding', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'well-written', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'powerful', 'superbly', 'acted', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'discomforting', 'material', 'keep', 'fascinated', 'final', 'credits', 'roll']",N/A
1518885,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B006PTL1GC,DanD,"[1, 2]","David Cronenberg is most famous for his earlier work, which revolved around various incarnations of the New Flesh.  His three most recent films (shall we call it the Viggo Mortensen Trilogy?)  could be described as analyzing the New Identity.  Longtime fans have expressed disappointment, of course, although both A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE and EASTERN PROMISES are arguably the strongest overall films of Cronenberg's career.  A DANGEROUS METHOD is a nice end-cap to the prior two films, while never quite reaching their brutal eloquence.  This is perhaps because METHOD is more a movie of ideas, and ideas, while captivating, don't necessarily make for an entertaining film.  The story (such as it is) follows Carl Jung, as he rehabilitates Sabina Spielrein, discovering in her not only a brilliant young woman, but also a fierce lover.  This relationship causes friction between Jung and his mentor/friend, Sigmund Freud, and ultimately leads to the split between the two.  (No spoilers; it's history, after all.)This is a slow film; indeed, at times the audience's attention is tempted to waver (thus, the lack of a fifth star).  To look away would be to miss a fine little film, however.  The performances from the three leads is utterly captivating.  The film belongs to Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley, the former restraining his baser urges, the latter exhibiting unrestrained emotional outbursts.  Viggo Mortensen is along in a supporting capacity, utterly disappearing into the role of a jovial, thoughtful Freud.  Turning in small, but excellent, supporting roles are Vincent Cassel (as Otto Gross) and Sarah Gadon as Emma Jung.  Christopher Hampton's script (based off of his play) is top-notch, and Cronenberg's direction is surprisingly controlled; for a director known for chaotic abandoned, Cronenberg plays the film fairly close to the chest, except for a few key scenes with Knightley.  Arguably, A DANGEROUS METHOD could have benefited from a little abandon; it's not boring, not at all, but the film is ultimately missing something.  Still, it's a fine addition to Cronenberg's cannon, one that leaves us hankering for his next disturbed offering.",4,"""Only the wounded physician can hope to heal.""",1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,2169,"['David', 'Cronenberg', 'most', 'famous', 'earlier', 'work', 'revolved', 'various', 'incarnations', 'New', 'Flesh', 'three', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'shall', 'call', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Trilogy', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'analyzing', 'New', 'Identity', 'Longtime', 'fans', 'have', 'expressed', 'disappointment', 'course', 'A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'EASTERN', 'PROMISES', 'are', 'arguably', 'strongest', 'overall', 'films', 'Cronenberg', 'career', 'DANGEROUS', 'METHOD', 'nice', 'end-cap', 'prior', 'two', 'films', 'never', 'quite', 'reaching', 'brutal', 'eloquence', 'perhaps', 'METHOD', 'more', 'movie', 'ideas', 'ideas', 'captivating', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'entertaining', 'film', 'story', 'such', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'discovering', 'not', 'only', 'brilliant', 'young', 'woman', 'also', 'fierce', 'lover', 'relationship', 'friction', 'Jung', 'mentor/friend', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'ultimately', 'split', 'two', 'spoilers', 'history', 'slow', 'film', 'indeed', 'times', 'audience', 'attention', 'tempted', 'waver', 'thus', 'lack', 'fifth', 'star', 'look', 'away', 'would', 'be', 'miss', 'fine', 'little', 'film', 'however', 'performances', 'three', 'leads', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'film', 'belongs', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'former', 'restraining', 'baser', 'urges', 'latter', 'exhibiting', 'unrestrained', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'along', 'supporting', 'capacity', 'utterly', 'disappearing', 'role', 'jovial', 'thoughtful', 'Freud', 'Turning', 'small', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Otto', 'Gross', 'Sarah', 'Gadon', 'Emma', 'Jung', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'script', 'based', 'play', 'top-notch', 'Cronenberg', 'direction', 'surprisingly', 'controlled', 'director', 'known', 'chaotic', 'abandoned', 'Cronenberg', 'film', 'fairly', 'close', 'chest', 'few', 'key', 'scenes', 'Knightley', 'Arguably', 'A', 'DANGEROUS', 'METHOD', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'little', 'abandon', 'not', 'boring', 'not', 'film', 'ultimately', 'missing', 'something', 'Still', 'fine', 'addition', 'Cronenberg', 'cannon', 'one', 'hankering', 'next', 'disturbed', 'offering']",N/A

Cannon ""dcannon661""","[3, 3]","If director David Cronenberg's early films like Videodrome and The Fly were concerned about ""the new flesh"", then his most recent efforts have been fascinated with ""the new mind.""  It might be the drug addled world of Naked Lunch or the disturbed mind of Spider or the amoral world of Eastern Promises, but the director has gone from visceral horror into more intellectually disturbing terrain.And ""A Dangerous Method"" fits this world view quite well.  I was leery of seeing this film since it generated very mixed reviews, with some people loving it and others finding it tedious.  I liked it a lot and think the problem is that this is really two films.  On the surface everything is Victorian prim and proper.  Except for some naughty spanking scenes, the film has few Cronenbergian flourishes.But go one level deeper and follow what everyone is talking about and things get more disturbing.  When Carl Jung uses Freud's experimental ""talking method"" on a new female patient Sabrina Spielrein, we get into a world of sexual repression, adulterous affairs, mysticism versus hedonism, and hints of European Anti-Semitism on the eve of World War II.  There may also be an intellectual menage a trois going on here - with Jung as ego rebelling against superego father figure in Freud and Spielrein as id (and Vincent Cassel's hedonistic Otto Gross could serve as Libido, I guess).Cerebral and complex, and let's be honest, dialogue heavy in quite a few places, this is not an action packed film.  But it is an intellectually challenging and provocative multi-level film, with superb cinematography and fine performances by all the leads.I must admit I am a fan of director Cronenberg - but I am not blind to his faults.  He can be very distant and aloof as a director - M Butterfly was definitely not his best effort and Spider left me cold.  I found Dangerous Method challenging and involving from start to finish.  In his early film Scanners, Cronenberg had a famous scene where a human head literally explodes.

1518887,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B006PTL1GC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","From filmmaker David Cronenberg  (""The Fly"", ""Eastern Promises"", ""A History of Violence"") comes his latest film ""A Dangerous Method"" based on the 1993 non-fiction book by John Kerr and a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, who wrote the original 2002 play ""The Talking Cure"" which was based on the book.The film has been in development for nearly a decade.  The film adaptation was to feature Julia Roberts but as time went on, Chris Hampton's play would be the first to be done but as time had passed and scheduling conflicts came in the way, by 2010, a film would be made and would star Viggo Mortensen (""The Lord of the Rings"" films, ""The Road"", ""A History of Violence""), Michael Fassbender (""Inglorious Basterds"", ""300', ""X-Men: First Class""), Keira Knightley (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Pride & Prejudice"") and Vincent Cassel (""Black Swan"", ""Shrek"", ""La Haine"").And now, ""A Dangerous Mind"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.VIDEO & AUDIO:""A Dangerous Method"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen and audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital. Before I continue, it's important to note that this film will be released on Blu-ray, so if you want the best picture and audio quality, I recommend watching it on HD.With that being said, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a film that utilizes a lot of outdoor scenes and locations.  So, there are time that we see vibrant colors and overall lighting was good and while watching the film, I admit that in my mind, I was thinking how awesome a lot of these scenes would look in HD.  And along with the wonderful location shots and cinematography, the film features beautiful costume design and also set design as well.  As for the picture quality of DVD, overall picture quality is good but once again, if you want the detail and clarity, go for the Blu-ray version.As for audio, dialogue is clear and there are moments where ambiance such as Sabina being taken to the mental hospital, you can hear the sounds of her kicking things around inside the carriage through the surround channels.  But the film is primarily a center and front-channel driven film.The music from Howard Shore is quite impressive and Richard Wagner's ""Sigfried Idyll"" performed by Lang Lang and arranged by Howard Shore is absolutely beautiful.  One again, this is a beautiful soundtrack that would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray but on DVD, overall dialogue and audio is clear with no problems that I can see or hear.SPECIAL FEATURES:""A Dangerous Method"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Director David Cronenberg - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary from Director David Cronenberg.The Making of A Dangerous Method - (7:41) Director David Cronenberg and the cast talk about working on the film.AFI's Harold Lloyd Master Seminar with David Cronenberg - (31:21) AFI interviews director David Cronenberg about how he came to direct ""A Dangerous Method"", how the film came to be and the making of the film.Theatrical Trailer - (1:56) The theatrical trailer for ""A Dangerous Method"".JUDGMENT CALL:""A Dangerous Method"" is an intriguing form of fiction based on the lives of Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein.For anyone who has studied psychiatry or are familiar with the people featured in the film, reading into the lives of Carl Jung and Sabina Spielrein seems like an emotional and intellectual drama.  And it doesn't surprise me that a film was made on them.For Carl Jung, so far it has been a few who have asserted that Jung and Spielrein have had a sexual relationship.  Afterall, it is known that Carl Jung had a long-time affair with Toni Wolff, a Swiss analyst who was also a patient of Carl Jung and had a relationship with his wife and Wolff simultaneously.  While with Sabina Spielrein, there have been books since 1980 written about the relationship between Jung and Spielrein from 1904-1910 and that he did constitute an ethical breach of doctor-patient boundary while treating Spielrein.In 1994, letters and diaries were found in the Claparede archive in Geneva and these letters show that their relationship was non-sexual but more of a therapeutic nature.Needless to say, no one will ever know the truth if these two individuals did have a sexual relationship but we do know that Carl Jung did have an impact in the life of Sabina Spielrein.  We do know that Carl Jung contacted Sigmund Freud for advice in treating Sabina and that moment of time, both Jung and Freud became intellectual confidants.As for the rift that drove them apart, we know that Sabina had nothing to do with it, but it was two men with two different theories and both men being well-known in their field and doing all they can to have supporters of their ideas, the clash between both men were inevitable.So, while watching ""A Dangerous Method"", I did find Christopher Hampton's screenplay based on John Kerr's novel to be an intriguing take on this long-rumored interaction but also what caused the rift between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.The more you research Carl Jung, especially with the release of ""The Red Book"" in 2009 (a manuscript that he written right after his falling out with Jeung and was forbidden for public viewing by his family until a family heir decided to publish it a few years ago) which you realize that Jung was man who had dreams, an active imagination one would say and these were further explored in his book.And as for his relationships with his patients, while Tony Wolff was known to be his mistress, Sabina to be rumored as a woman he had an affair with for years, I did find it quite intriguing of how the storyline incorporated Otto Gross, who was a disciple of Sigmund Freud but treated by Carl Jung and is known as the founding grandfather of 20th Century Counterculture.  A free spirited manic depressive who was an extrovert addicted to sex.  Was it Otto Gross that helped lead Jung astray?  I found that intriguing.I'm not a Freud or Jung erudite, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performances by Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley are fantastic.  How exact it is to their original counterparts, I don't know.  But Keira Knightley did a wonderful job in portraying a hysterical woman.  It's a performance that I have never seen by Knightley and in fact, whenever she did go into hysterics, I was freaked out a little as she would do this elongating of her jaw.  Needless to say, it was visually affective in portraying the character.Mortensen's Sigmund Freud was rather well-done.  Very stoic and serious, while Fassbender's performance of Carl Jung was very good, but it made me wonder if an intellectual like Jung was also a suave ladies man?  I felt that maybe he looked too cool, but then again, maybe Carl Jung was a classy, cool, suave intellectual.The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky (""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Eastern Promises"", ""A History of Violence"") was absolutely beautiful and vibrant and it helps to have a talented crew providing wonderful costume and set design as well. Also, I give credit to Howard Shore for providing beautiful, emotional, chaotic music to support what we see onscreen.As for the DVD, fans of David Cronenberg will enjoy his AFI interview but also his audio commentary which he really delves into the characters and his interested in doing a film about Freud.But as I did enjoy the performances, the cinematography and music, I do have a problem with the film's storyline overall.Once again, this film is fiction based on assertions that Sabina Spielrein and Carl Jung had a sexual relationship.  But if letters were found to show that it was factual, I wouldn't be surprised because we know that Jung had an affair and a relationship with Tony Wolff, a former patient of his and a future analyst.But I enjoyed the film for giving attention to Sabina Speilrein, as she was the first person to introduce the idea of death instincts (best known for her published work ""Destruction as the Cause of Coming into Being""), a concept that Sigmund Freud would incorporate into his own theory.  She was also known to introduce psychoanalysis to Russia and was an inspiration to future psychoanalysts, including Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget.Always known as a footnote in Sigmund Freud's book and considered as a ""forgotten pioneer of psychoanalysis"", unfortunately Sabina Speilrein's life in reality was cut short and her two children were killed by a German SS Death Squad.  But her contributions as a psychoanalysis should have been shown.  This woman's work have been forgotten and now that she has been brought back to the masses, she is not seen for her accomplishments but her sadistic needs.It is known that Spielrein had wrote about masochism and the sadistic component of sexual drive as a ""destructive drive"" but does it mean she was a woman who loved to be spanked by Carl Jung?  Those scenes I found a bit worrisome as people will see her more as Carl Jung's sexual exploit rather than her contributions as a psychoanalyst.Overall, ""A Dangerous Method"" is an exploitative, sensational and intriguing take on Carl-Gustav Jung and Sabina Spielrein, and Jung's his split with his intellectual confidant Sigmund Freud, but I do admit that I found the treatment of Sabina Speilrein's life to be troubling and misleading. It's bad enough that her career as a psychoanalysis was never recognized (possibly because in that era she was a woman in man's world and not taken seriously by her peers) but to summarize her life as a character that is always craving for attention and wanting to be spanked, I found it the most unfortunate.  And like Freud's footnote to credit her career, Cronenberg also ends with a title of Spielrein's accomplishments and tragic death.For so long, many have hoped for Speilrein to be known for her work and no longer be ""forgotten"".  Unfortunately, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a film that no only hurts her reputation and paints nothing more but a hysterical love toy but also is a film that is possibly quite damaging to the legacy of Carl Jung.While ""A Dangerous Method"" does make for intriguing cinema.

Viggo Mortensen plays Freud as a man who is brave enough to suggest that sex is the key to unlocking virtually every human secret but who is so thoroughly ensconced in Victorian respectablity that he is uncertain what to do with this discovery. Initially, he places his hopes in Jung but, as Michael Fassbender plays him, Jung is too confused by his own personal truths and desires to see a clear way forward. Neither men seem to understand psychoanalysis as Sabina (Keira Knightly) understands it: as a personally and politically liberating art & science. Cronenberg's film (based on a book and stage play) suggests that we still haven't resolved the age-old dispute between Freud's patriarchal rationalism that preserves the social order and a more anti-patriarchal & anti-authoritarian version of psychoanalysis that transforms the social order. Keira Knightly's character seems to be the one nearest realizing some form of compromise between or some sort of synthesis of these two competing branches of the art/science but alas the film ends and we never learn what that way forward might have been.

1518891,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B006PTL1GC,Dr. James Gardner,"[196, 221]","Putting aside some minor historical and biographical inaccuracies, ""A Dangerous Method"" is a marvelous film, with a bravura performance by Keira Knightly. The focus of the film is the relationship between two of the great founders of modern psychological theory, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian Jew who developed the Psychoanalytic method as a result of his work in neurology and his experiments with Mesmerism (hypnosis). He published the first of many books in 1899 and this attracted the attention of dozens of intellectuals, including Carl Jung (1875-1961), a Swiss Psychiatrist.Jung approached Freud in 1906 and their relationship lasted for approximately 7 years.When they met, Freud was 50 and Jung was 31. Freud was a Jew and Jung was a Swiss Reformed Evangelical. Freud was 5'7"", Jung was 6'1"". Jung's experience was largely based in institutions and Freud was primarily a private physician. Freud lived comfortably but was never well off. Jung had been poor as a child but married one of the wealthiest women in Switzerland. Freud was known for being faithful to his wife and Jung was well known for his affairs, one of which is the focus of the film.Keira Knightly plays Sabrina Spielrein (1885-1942), a former patient of Jung with whom he had an affair. Knightgly is the Natalie Portman look-alike who played the decoy Queen in Star Wars (1999). From this humble beginning she went on to earn an Oscar and a Golden Globe nomination for ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005) and has been in such box office hits as the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise and ""King Arthur"" (2004). As the conflicted and vulnerable Russian Jewess, this is by far her best performance and one of the best performances by anyone.Viggo Mortensen plays the cigar smoking Freud (who ultimately developed cancer of the jaw). Mortensen is best known for his ""Lord of the Rings"" films as well as some stunning work in films like his Oscar nominated role in ""Eastern Promises"" (2007) and ""A History of Violence"" (2005). His work in this film earned him a Golden Globe nomination. He is marvelously understated.Michael Fassbender plays Jung. Fassbender is best known for his work in ""Inglorious Bastards"" (2009) and his Golden Globe nominated ""Shame"" (2011). He does a good job acting, but he lacks the stature of Jung who towered over (at 6'1"") his contempories.David Cronenberg directs. Cronenberg is known as the ""Baron of Blood"" for films such as ""Scanners"" (1981), ""Videodrone"" (1983), ""The Dead Zone"" (1983) and ""The Fly"" (1986). He worked with Mortensen on ""A History of Violence"" (2005) and ""Eastern Promises"" (2007).The beautiful on location photography is courtesy of Peter Suschitzky who is a long time collaborator with Cronenberg and who also has to his credit films as diverse as ""Valentino"" (1977), ""Mars Attack"" and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"". The excellent musical score is from Howard Shore whose most familiar work is ""Lord of the Rings"" for which he won 2 Oscars and 3 ASCAPs. and who also gave us memorable work in ""Big"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Philadelphia"", and ""Se7en"".It's hard to make a compelling movie about such an academic topic as the differences in emphasis between Freud and Jung, and there a few good films about the history of psychology. Montgomery Clift's ""Freud"" (1962) and the Australian film ""Between the Wars"" (1974) are examples that this can be achieved, and here we have another fine example.There are some problems with the film. The influence of World War 1 on Freud's death theory is ignored as is Jung's unflattering complicity with the Nazis. The use of Otto Gross as the only other analyst in the film makes one think that early Psychoanalysis was permeated with sexual perverts, when in fact there were many people involved who were there for the intellectual and humanitarian purposes.Another problem with the film is that the enormity of Freud's message is not really portrayed adequately. In 1900, the idea that our behavior was controlled by unconscious impulses was revolutionary, and as much of a problem for Freud as his sexual theory, yet the two were intertwined. The film's focus on the sexual theory doesn't do justice to the complexity of Freud's theory nor to how controversial it was.The film also underplays the importance that Jung's role as a non-Jew had to the ""movement"" and how much anti-semitism was at play for a theory that seemed to be rooted in intellectual Jewish culture.Critics were divided in assessing the film. Roger Ebert called the film ""absorbing"" and said Mortensten's performance was ""masterful"". The Hollywood Reporter called it ""precise, lucid and thrillingly disciplined"", but Rene Rodrigues of the Miami Herald called the film ""crushingly dull"".The film was released in late November and earned nearly $4 million in the first month, which placed it 165 for all films released in the previous year. It had an estimated budget in excess of $20 million.Bottom line - fans of biographies and anyone with an interest in Psychoanalysis will find this film very entertaining and informative, but for the ordinary film goer it may be too much talking and not enough action.",4,"Great film, but not for everyone",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,5163,"['Putting', 'aside', 'minor', 'historical',

(and, by the way, both freudian and jungian psychoanalysis are ""sciences"" now largely discredited and therefore immune to any misrepresentations that this film might seem to make.) whether the affair is factual or not (i find it likely, given jung's wayward temperament), it is highly meaningful and resonant within the film as a transgression that becomes necessary in carl jung's search for what is true to himself. others dislike the vivid sexual scenes, but they seem to me necessary to anchor the basic temperaments involved: meticulous freud increasingly obsessed with what other people think, restless carl increasingly unconcerned with what other people think, and sabrina ... a molten gush of passion, pain and inspiration.david cronenberg's achievement (as director and cowriter) is to cast this psychoanalytic triangle -- ego carl, superego sigmund, and sabrina of the boiling id -- as an elaborate family drama. the personalities argue for conflicting interpretations of science and healing, repression and freedom, creativity and destruction, civilization and its discontents (superbly exemplified in otto gross) that were raw and entirely unexplored at the time. themes we may think of today as settled or at least worn out are reimagined through the conflicted individuals who grappled with them for the first time, and we are shown how revolutionary intellectual insights, at first encounter, can unleash primal counterreactions in otherwise civilized human nature. there are even resonances of classic freudian concepts: the carl/sabrina affair as incest, the jung/freud dispute as a parricide, the benevolent tone that freud takes to spielrein as a father and daughter seduction.whatever quibbles the fastidious may want to make about documentation and evidence, or posterity and propriety, this film struck me as accurate where it aspired to be: as a portrait of the human struggle to understand the darkest and most powerful parts of human nature. it is one of

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","""A Dangerous Method"" is a movie that disserved by its trailer -- it looked like a movie that focused on Carl Jung having an affair with a masochistic mental patient. Well, yes, that does happen. But David Cronenberg's movie is less about the love affair and more about Carl Jung's fraying friendship with Sigmund Freud, and Viggo Mortensen and Michael Fassbender give exquisite performances. Sadly, Keira Knightley isn't up to their level.Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) is incarcerated at a Swiss mental hospital, where she is psychoanalyzed by Carl Jung (Fassbender) -- and soon he is able to pinpoint the cause of her masochistic sexual behavior. Soon she's not only acting normally, but is studying to become a doctor herself.Pleased by her progress, Jung speaks about her to the eminent Dr. Sigmund Freud (Mortensen), who views Jung as a surrogate son and heir to his well-regarded theories. At the same time, Jung continues working professionally with Sabina as she develops her own psychoanalytic theories -- and the two of them develop a passionate attraction.Jung initially is reluctant to cheat on his loyal, beautiful wife. But after a sex-addicted psychoanalyst (Vincent Cassel) exhorts Jung to follow his urges, he falls into a passionate affair with Sabina. This throws a monkey wrench not only into his personal life, but it begins to interfere in his friendship with Freud -- and as Jung insists on following his own theories about myth and archetypes, his friendship with Freud begins to fall apart.It takes a director as brilliant as David Cronenberg to not only get a movie like this made and released in theatres, but to keep it from becoming dull. Most of ""A Dangerous Method"" is made up of conversations about the human mind and how it works, slowly showing the audience that psychoanalytic theories are not really about the patient -- they are all about the shrinks and how THEY see the world.And yet Cronenberg makes every scene, every conversation feel intense and sometimes passionate, no matter how dry the subject matter is. He makes you feel the intense passion of Jung and Sabina as they natter about their theories, contrasted to the rigid condescension of Freud. Things are intense even in a funny scene where Freud exhorts Jung to talk about kinky sexual practices at the dinner table.And while Jung's sexual/intellectual affair with Sabina is important, the most important relationship here is the friendship with Freud and Jung, which flowers briefly before slowly decaying. Fassbender and Mortensen are absolutely spellbinding here -- one is a uncertain but passionate doctor who is seeking to explore new terrain in the human mind, and the other is an older, more entrenched man who refuses to explore different theories.But Keira Knightley was not the right actress for this part -- she's not subtle enough to go toe-to-toe with Mortensen and Fassbender. Any displays of emotion look cartoonish and exaggerated, with her twitching and yo-yoing jaw. Even in the scenes where Sabina is composed, she feels over-the-top compared to the others.""A Dangerous Method"" is a very cerebral, ""talky"" movie, but it also is a powerful look back at the men and women who created psychology as we know it today.

It's scarcely a film about Freud at all; Jung is the central character throughout. It's the ethical, emotional and intellectual turmoil of his life that shapes the drama; his divergence from Freud is presented as largely the result of sexual and professional jealousy on both sides, with just the merest hint of the impending catastrophe of anti-semitism and an even slimmer hint of the substantial incompatibility of Freud's and Jung's psychological models. Nevertheless, the very capable acting of Viggo Mortensen as Freud and Michael Fassbender as Jung keeps the film engrossing.The insurmountable problem is the acting of Keira Knightley in the role of the historical person Sabina Spielrein, first shown on screen as a flailing hysteric, then as a challenging patient significantly ""helped"" by Jung's psychoanalysis, then as the masochistic lover and manipulator of Jung, thus becoming the ""wedge"" between Jung and Freud. The characterological triangle is not entirely implausible. In fact, it might approach ""fact"" or at least insight. But Knightley so freakishly overacts throughout that the triangle loses its hypotenuse. Knightley's grimaces and writhings are hard enough to watch, but her spoken dialogue is horrible. She seems to be attempting a ""Russian"" accent in this English-language script that rightly should be in German. Alas, her Russo-English slips often - sometimes in mid sentence - into a twangy LA Valley Girl accent. And how's that for weird, since she is actually British by birth? Even if her accent were better managed, her speaking technique is amateurish; ""stars"" who are paid celestial salaries surely can be expected to have basic skills of dramatic elocution.I'm stymied about a proper rating for this film. As I said, I found it engrossing; ergo four stars, though Knightly is so awful that I'm tempted to slam the film with a three.

1518899,A328S9RN3U5M68,B006PTL1GC,Grady Harp,"[7, 11]","A DANGEROUS METHOD offers the audience a look at the beginnings of psychoanalysis by presenting the lives of four important doctors at eh turn of the 20th century. The film is adapted by Christopher Hampton from his play `The Talking Cure' which in turn was a dramatization of John Kerr's book `A Most Dangerous Method'. An interesting aspect of the film is that it is primarily a film about discussions embroidered with enough action to make it cinematic. It is beautiful to watch, a pleasure to hear (Howard Shore's musical score consists of `arrangements' of themes form the operas of Richard Wagner with an emphasis on the `Siegfried Idyll' which as a work with its own similar history that plays exceptionally well into this story), a challenge to absorb in the hands of director David Cronenberg, and a showcase for some fine acting.The film opens in 1904 with Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) accepting as a patient young Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Sabina Spielberg (Kiera Knightley) who is a tortured soul from a past abusive upbringing.  We are like a fly on the wall, observing Sabina's neurotic/psychotic behavior as Jung begins to tame her: their gradually successful treatment results in an affair both emotional and physical despite the fact that Jung is married to Emma (Sarah Gadon) and has children and also despite the fact that Jung believes the doctor/patient relationship should be respected. Meanwhile off in Vienna Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) is gaining acclaim for this psychoanalytic work and refers a patient of his, a fellow analyst Dr. Otto Gross (Vinvent Cassell) whose extreme sexual acting out has gained notoriety. Jung accepts Gross as a patient and from the stance of the story, Jung learns more form Gross than Gross benefits from Jung: apparently Jung's libido is encouraged and that urges him to act out with Sabina, now able to respond to the world in a manner so appropriate that she becomes a medical student and eventually a psychiatrist also.  The story also examines the coming together and the eventual parting of ways between Jung and Freud and it is this part of the film that becomes more significantly and satisfyingly cerebral.  It is this intense relationship between Freud and Jung that gives us a quality understanding of the birth of psychoanalysis.Though the opening scenes of the film - those that focus on the outrageous behavioral changes in Sabina - becoming trying on the nerves, the remainder of the film is intellectually satisfying. Kiera Knightley stumbles with her Russian accent and tends to take her character's mental aberrations too far, but otherwise she is excellent in her role.  Both Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen offer elegant and understated characterizations of these two important men in the history of medicine.  Vincent Cassell and Sarah Gadon are also exceptional in their acting.

1518903,A330XFRJKS3APU,B006PTL1GC,Igor Biryukov,"[4, 7]","An interesting and thought-provoking film. Five stars, but I have some minor reservations. Lets psychoanalyze this:1] Jung. While certainly a womanizer, Carl Jung was quite mainstream. Though he and his patient Sabina Speilrein were lovers, Jung didn't spank her in the bedroom with his belt. Not even for medicinal purposes. Did this come from the director's fertile imagination or his suppressed desires?2] Freud. It was bold, but silly to cast Aragon of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (Viggo Mortensen) as Sigmund Freud. This didn't pay off, because Viking-looking VIggo (Isn't he Danish?) looks more like Jung than Freud. Freud was 5' 7'"" (170 cm), while Viggo is six feet-tall. Details are important. While Viggo acts well, he doesn't look believable. But perhaps Freud himself wouldn't have mind it?3] Frau Spielrein. Making ""Pirates of the Caribbean's"" Keira Knightly into Sabina Spielrein didn't quite work either in my view. Sabina was attractive to Jung because she was (apart from being neurotic) very rich, very bright and very exotic. She was a Russian. She came from Rostov-on-Don, heiress to the fortune of a Russian-Jewish merchant. She spoke German with a Russian accent. Correct me if I am wrong, but Keira doesn't fit this profile, although she did best she could with her West London accent.Perhaps I am nitpicking. Overall, the film is good and, in cinematographic terms, good-looking. The music-score is nice. While casting is overall suspicious, Vincent Cassel is brilliant as Otto Gross, a deranged over-sexed psychoanalyst. Jung's wife is also well cast. The costumes are tremendous; the atmosphere of the times is well reproduced. I highly recommend it to everyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and films for grown-ups.P.S. The main argument between Jung and Freud perhaps should have been better explained in the film: it was about nature of the libido. Freud conceived of the libido as a quantitative (or ""economic"") concept: it is an energy which can increase or decrease, and which can be displaced. Freud insisted on the sexual nature of the energy, and he maintained a dualism in which the libido is opposed to another (non-sexual) form of energy. Jung opposed this dualism, positing a single form of life-energy, which is neutral in character. I believe Freud was nearer the truth: at least he stayed scientific, while Jung descended into the alchemy.",5,Cherchez la femme,1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2391,"['interesting', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'Five', 'stars', 'have', 'minor', 'reservations', 'Lets', 'psychoanalyze', 'this:1', ']', 'Jung', 'certainly', 'womanizer', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'was', 'quite', 'mainstream', 'patient', 'Sabina', 'Speilrein', 'were', 'lovers', 'Jung', 'did', ""n't"", 'spank', 'bedroom', 'belt', 'Not', 'even', 'medicinal', 'purposes', 'Did', 'come', 'director', 'fertile', 'imagination', 'suppressed', 'desires', '2', ']', 'Freud', 'was', 'bold', 'silly', 'cast', 'Aragon', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'Viking-looking', 'VIggo', ""n't"", 'Danish', 'more', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'Freud', 'was', '5', '7', '170', 'cm', 'Viggo', 'six', 'feet-tall', 'Details', 'are', 'important', 'Viggo', 'well', ""n't"", 'look', 'believable', 'perhaps', 'Freud', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'mind', '3', ']', 'Frau', 'Spielrein', 'Making', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'either', 'view', 'Sabina', 'was', 'attractive', 'Jung', 'was', 'apart', 'being', 'neurotic', 'very', 'rich', 'very', 'bright', 'very', 'exotic', 'was', 'Russian', 'came', 'Rostov-on-Don', 'heiress', 'fortune', 'Russian-Jewish', 'merchant', 'spoke', 'German', 'Russian', 'accent', 'Correct', 'am', 'wrong', 'Keira', ""n't"", 'fit', 'profile', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'West', 'London', 'accent.Perhaps', 'am', 'nitpicking', 'Overall', 'film', 'good', 'cinematographic', 'terms', 'good-looking', 'music-score', 'nice', 'casting', 'overall', 'suspicious', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'brilliant', 'Otto', 'Gross', 'deranged', 'over-sexed', 'psychoanalyst', 'Jung', 'wife', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'costumes', 'are', 'tremendous', 'atmosphere', 'times', 'well', 'reproduced', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'interested', 'history', 'psychoanalysis', 'films', 'grown-ups.P.S', 'main', 'argument', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'explained', 'film', 'was', 'nature', 'libido', 'Freud', 'conceived', 'libido', 'quantitative', 'economic', 'concept', 'energy', 'can', 'increase', 'decrease', 'can', 'be', 'displaced', 'Freud', 'insisted', 'sexual', 'nature', 'energy', 'maintained', 'dualism', 'libido', 'opposed', 'non-sexual', 'form', 'energy', 'Jung', 'opposed', 'dualism', 'positing', 'single', 'form', 'life-energy', 'neutral', 'character', 'believe', 'Freud', 'was', 'truth', 'least', 'stayed', 'scientific', 'Jung', 'descended', 'alchemy']",N/A

I am sad that the trailer basically had the ending of the movie in it so when I got to the end I was kind of like '...really?' I could have saved the money and just watched the trailer to see pretty much the whole movie. I am also sad because I enjoy a good story about something historical but I really feel like they added a lot of sex just to sell the film. I would have been ok without seeing Keira Knightley's boobs and some man that looks like a younger version of my grandfather spanking her with a belt. For me personally for the reasons described, it was a little creepy and gross lol. I'm sure other people will be totally ok with those scenes though. I also totally expected the wife to have more of a role in the movie and I am very disappointed by that. If I could summarize the plot synopsis in my own words I would say: Carl Jung has sex with a patient while arguing with Freud and neglecting his family. They laugh, they cry, they move on and die. Then end.All in all, it didn't really make me think much or feel much. Besides slightly confused about why they would put the end of the movie in the trailer. This movie is worth a once through.

1518905,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B006PTL1GC,Israel Drazin,"[1, 2]","Carl Jung (1875-1961) is known today as a respected psychoanalyst. His father was a protestant minister and Carl maintained a deep interest in religion, spirituality, myths, and even superstition throughout his life. He disagreed with the Sigmund Freud's theory (1856-1939) that the underlying human drive is sex. Thus, for example, Freud says that some people are unable to overcome early sexual attractions to their mother or father and he says art can be a sublimation of the sex drive. While Freud insisted on a strictly scientific study of people, Jung felt that psychoanalysts must also delve into improvable imaginative mystical and spiritual matters. One of his theories is archetypes: ideas can be transmitted from one generation to the next. This is well known. However what is not known is that Jung unprofessionally had long-lasting sexual affairs with at least two of his patients for years.This 2011 film tells part of the story of Jung's affair with Sabina Spielrein. It began in 1905 and lasted for five years. The film is based on the book by the same name by John Kerr. Spielrein was 19 years old and Jung's first patient. She was ten years younger than Jung who was married. Jung at the time was impressed by the treatment method of Sigmund Freud and used it to treat Spielrein successfully.A serious problem with the Freud method is transference: patients develop a strong feeling of love for the doctor. Thus the author calls it a ""dangerous method."" As expected, Spielrein became enamored with Jung, and Jung, who had stopped loving his wife, took advantage of Spielrein sexually. Jung met Freud in 1906 and began a friendly relationship with him until Freud learnt of Jung's misuse of his profession and sexual affair. Freud ended his relations with Jung in 1913.Sabina Spielrein became a physician and a psychoanalyst, married, had two daughters, and moved to Russia. She is credited with introducing psychoanalysis to Russia. She and her husband were Jewish. Stalin murdered her husband and the Nazis killed her and her two daughters. After Spielrein left for Russia, Jung, a non-Jew, began an affair with another one of his patients who was also Jewish. Freud with whom Adler had disagreements was also Jewish. In view of Jung repeatedly taking unprofessional advantage of Jews and other acts, as well as articles he wrote during the Nazi regime in Germany in which he spoke disparagingly about Jewish psychoanalysis, there are analysts who are convinced that Jung was an anti-Semite.",5,A very revealing film that criticizes Carl Jung,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2510,"['Carl', 'Jung', '1875-1961', 'known', 'today', 'respected', 'psychoanalyst', 'father', 'was', 'protestant', 'minister', 'Carl', 'maintained', 'deep', 'interest', 'religion', 'spirituality', 'myths', 'even', 'superstition', 'life', 'disagreed', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'theory', '1856-1939', 'underlying', 'human', 'drive', 'sex', 'Thus', 'example', 'Freud', 'people', 'are', 'unable', 'overcome', 'early', 'sexual', 'attractions', 'mother', 'father', 'art', 'can', 'be', 'sublimation', 'sex', 'drive', 'Freud', 'insisted', 'strictly', 'scientific', 'study', 'people', 'Jung', 'felt', 'psychoanalysts', 'must', 'also', 'delve', 'improvable', 'imaginative', 'mystical', 'spiritual', 'matters', 'One', 'theories', 'archetypes', 'ideas', 'can', 'be', 'transmitted', 'one', 'generation', 'next', 'well', 'known', 'However', 'what', 'not', 'known', 'Jung', 'unprofessionally', 'had', 'long-lasting', 'sexual', 'affairs', 'least', 'two', 'patients', 'years.This', '2011', 'film', 'tells', 'part', 'story', 'Jung', 'affair', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'began', '1905', 'lasted', 'five', 'years', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'John', 'Kerr', 'Spielrein', 'was', '19', 'years', 'old', 'Jung', 'first', 'patient', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'younger', 'Jung', 'who', 'was', 'married', 'Jung', 'time', 'was', 'impressed', 'treatment', 'method', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'used', 'treat', 'Spielrein', 'successfully.A', 'serious', 'problem', 'Freud', 'method', 'transference', 'patients', 'develop', 'strong', 'feeling', 'love', 'doctor', 'Thus', 'author', 'dangerous', 'method', 'expected', 'Spielrein', 'became', 'enamored', 'Jung', 'Jung', 'who', 'had', 'stopped', 'loving', 'wife', 'took', 'advantage', 'Spielrein', 'sexually', 'Jung', 'met', 'Freud', '1906', 'began', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'Freud', 'learnt', 'Jung', 'misuse', 'profession', 'sexual', 'affair', 'Freud', 'ended', 'relations', 'Jung', '1913.Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'became', 'physician', 'psychoanalyst', 'married', 'had', 'two', 'daughters', 'moved', 'Russia', 'credited', 'introducing', 'psychoanalysis', 'Russia', 'husband', 'were', 'Jewish', 'Stalin', 'murdered', 'husband', 'Nazis', 'killed', 'two', 'daughters', 'Spielrein', 'left', 'Russia', 'Jung', 'non-Jew', 'began', 'affair', 'one', 'patients', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'Jewish', 'Freud', 'whom', 'Adler', 'had', 'disagreements', 'was', 'also', 'Jewish', 'view', 'Jung', 'repeatedly', 'taking', 'unprofessional', 'advantage', 'Jews', 'other', 'acts', 'as', 'well', 'articles', 'wrote', 'Nazi', 'regime', 'Germany', 'spoke', 'disparagingly', 'Jewish', 'psychoanalysis', 'are', 'analysts', 'who', 'are', 'convinced', 'Jung', 'was', 'anti-Semite']",N/A

Jung follows Freud's methods but also has his own ideas. Jung and Freud become friends and mentors to each other as well as sparring partners over their believes. Jung becomes sexually involved with Spielrein and nothing is ever the same.A DANGEROUS METHOD is a beautifully films period piece taking place in the early 20th century. The visuals are a treat to the eye. Costumes and location add an extreme reality to this film. The main problem is there really is not much of interest in this film as the trio work out the problems.

1518907,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B006PTL1GC,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 9]","This film is not in Cronenberg's most common style but it is well done. It is nicely quaint and that is definitely the British touch in it, quaint to the point of nostalgia, mind you before the Fist World War in Austria and in Switzerland.But The film is divided between the sentimental conflict and impulses, that are also sexual, and the more serious subjects of the relation between Jews and Aryans in the German speaking Europe of the time on one hand and the theoretical and practical debate between Freud and Jung on the other hand. That gives to the film a strange equilibrium that definitely makes the sexual and sentimental side purely animalistic and the theoretical part a purely boring discussion between essentially males locked up in their impulses, repressions and other axioms.The sentimental side is simple. Carl Jung had liaisons, a little bit more than affairs with his own patients and played on the term by refusing their fees when he started the liaison or affair. At the same time he keeps a rather serene relation with his own wife who is extremely well-off. That sounds sordid and that is anyway a case of abuse of power from a person in an authority position to a person in a medically dependent position. That is unacceptable from any point of view. That side of the film is off-limits.The second question, that of the relations between Jews and Aryans before 1914 in German speaking countries is only expressed by Freud and is a total rejection of some compromise with the Aryans and an advice to the young student Jung had a liaison with to remember that Jews are not supposed to mix with Aryans and are supposed to keep together. This cast a bright light on the reasons of the ending of the relation of Jung and Freud, though it is true in a way Freud was too intellectually powerful for Jung to remain under his influence too long. The question at stake here is the fact that Jung considers that Freud brings too much sexuality in psychoanalysis.The third question is the continuation of the previous one. The debate between Freud and Jung before 1914. Can the whole psychology of a human being be reduced to his libido, hence to his sexual instinct or impulse? Jung starts thinking then that many other elements interfere with the psychology of an individual that come from the social and cultural field, both being time-sensitive and hence inherited from the past, from history, and hence the reflection of this history, including ancient history. Jung will go very far in that direction after WW1. A side issue is brought into the picture by Sabina Spielrein, the student and patient Jung had a liaison with. She seems to tend to think that a love relation, a sexual relation leads to the destruction of both egos in order to be able to produce a new one. This is by far the reduction of the sexual and sentimental impulse, the libido, to only one objective: procreation. This is dangerous.The point is that Wilhelm Reich is missing in that picture who will defend the idea that the libido aims mainly at getting pleasure and that procreation is only kind of a side effect, which it has become nowadays due to contraceptives and other birth control means.That reduces the debate to the arguments that will triumph in Scientology: the only basic and central aim of all life is the survival instinct, at the level of the individual, intercourse, the immediate group and the species. If sexuality has only one aim, procreation, if pleasure can only be taken into account outside procreation, hence outside a marital relation, if the only aim of the individual is to survive in a way or another, humanity is reduced to a herd of animals that have to be manipulated and brainwashed by the few powerful ones who will dominate by self appointment due to their force, no matter what.I thus regret this film does not step over 14-18 and does not envisage the later period of the 1920s and the 1930s, when things became quite different and a lot more interesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,The debate comes only after the 1914-18 slaughter,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,4008,"['film', 'not', 'Cronenberg', 'most', 'common', 'style', 'well', 'done', 'nicely', 'quaint', 'definitely', 'British', 'touch', 'quaint', 'point', 'nostalgia', 'mind', 'Fist', 'World', 'War', 'Austria', 'Switzerland.But', 'film', 'divided', 'sentimental', 'conflict', 'impulses', 'are', 'also', 'sexual', 'more', 'serious', 'subjects', 'relation', 'Jews', 'Aryans', 'German', 'speaking', 'Europe', 'time', 'one', 'hand', 'theoretical', 'practical', 'debate', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'strange', 'equilibrium', 'definitely', 'sexual', 'sentimental', 'side', 'purely', 'animalistic', 'theoretical', 'part', 'purely', 'boring', 'discussion', 'essentially', 'males', 'locked', 'up', 'impulses', 'repressions', 'other', 'axioms.The', 'sentimental', 'side', 'simple', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'had', 'liaisons', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'affairs', 'own', 'patients', 'played', 'term', 'refusing', 'fees', 'when', 'started', 'liaison', 'affair', 'same', 'time', 'rather', 'serene', 'relation', 'own', 'wife', 'who', 'extremely', 'well-off', 'sordid', 'anyway', 'case', 'abuse', 'power', 'person', 'authority', 'position', 'person', 'medically', 'dependent', 'position', 'unacceptable', 'point', 'view', 'side', 'film', 'off-limits.The', 'second', 'question', 'relations', 'Jews', 'Aryans', '1914', 'German', 'speaking', 'countries', 'only', 'expressed', 'Freud', 'total', 'rejection', 'compromise', 'Aryans', 'advice', 'young', 'student', 'Jung', 'had', 'liaison', 'remember', 'Jews', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'mix', 'Aryans', 'are', 'supposed', 'keep', 'together', 'cast', 'bright', 'light', 'reasons', 'ending', 'relation', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'true', 'way', 'Freud', 'was', 'too', 'intellectually', 'powerful', 'Jung', 'remain', 'influence', 'too', 'long', 'question', 'stake', 'here', 'fact', 'Jung', 'considers', 'Freud', 'too', 'much', 'sexuality', 'psychoanalysis.The', 'third', 'question', 'continuation', 'previous', 'one', 'debate', 'Freud', 'Jung', '1914', 'Can', 'whole', 'psychology', 'human', 'being', 'be', 'reduced', 'libido', 'hence', 'sexual', 'instinct', 'impulse', 'Jung', 'thinking', 'then', 'many', 'other', 'elements', 'interfere', 'psychology', 'individual', 'come', 'social', 'cultural', 'field', 'being', 'time-sensitive', 'hence', 'inherited', 'past', 'history', 'hence', 'reflection', 'history', 'including', 'ancient', 'history', 'Jung', 'will', 'go', 'very', 'far', 'direction', 'WW1', 'A', 'side', 'issue', 'brought', 'picture', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'student', 'patient', 'Jung', 'had', 'liaison', 'tend', 'think', 'love', 'relation', 'sexual', 'relation', 'destruction', 'egos', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'produce', 'new', 'one', 'far', 'reduction', 'sexual', 'sentimental', 'impulse', 'libido', 'only', 'one', 'objective', 'procreation', 'dangerous.The', 'point', 'Wilhelm', 'Reich', 'missing', 'picture', 'who', 'will', 'defend', 'idea', 'libido', 'mainly', 'getting', 'pleasure', 'procreation', 'only', 'kind', 'side', 'effect', 'become', 'nowadays', 'due', 'contraceptives', 'other', 'birth', 'control', 'debate', 'arguments', 'will', 'triumph', 'Scientology', 'only', 'basic', 'central', 'aim', 'life', 'survival', 'instinct', 'level', 'individual', 'intercourse', 'immediate', 'group', 'species', 'sexuality', 'only', 'one', 'aim', 'procreation', 'pleasure', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'taken', 'account', 'outside', 'procreation', 'hence', 'marital', 'relation', 'only', 'aim', 'individual', 'survive', 'way', 'humanity', 'reduced', 'herd', 'animals', 'have', 'be', 'manipulated', 'brainwashed', 'few', 'powerful', 'ones', 'who', 'will', 'dominate', 'self', 'appointment', 'due', 'force', 'matter', 'what.I', 'thus', 'regret', 'film', 'not', 'step', '14-18', 'not', 'envisage', 'later', 'period', '1920s', '1930s', 'when', 'things', 'became', 'quite', 'different', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A
1518908,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B006PTL1GC,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 1]","I'm a huge fan of Cronenberg and have been since VIDEODROME, and I'm really appreciating the filmmaker he's grown into. He refused to pigeon-hole himself into just making hyper-violent or horrifically unnerving psuedo-sexual horror or suspense films; with SPIDER and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, he started entering the world of a fully mature director who could now play with all the toys that cinema had to offer. After that, though, came his safest film EASTERN PROMISES, and other than a bravura performance by Viggo Mortensen, is a sadly forgettable film. But with A DANGEROUS METHOD, he subverts another genre of filmmaking: The Historical Biopic.Aside from the excellent (but unsurprisingly historically inaccurate) storytelling and great performances by Michael Fassbender as Carl Jung, Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross, and Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, the real standout here is Keira Knightley who gives a brilliant, uncompromising performance as Sabina Spielrein, the young woman who comes to Jung's hospital for treatment and is the catalyst for the drama within the film. Many people who are giving this film less than stellar reviews are singling out Knightley for ""overacting"" when she's in the throes of her hysteria. Obviously I wasn't there, but from historical documentarians and accounts, this is a very successful recreation of a woman suffering from hysteria. To be quite honest though, even if it wasn't an exacting duplication, it's utterly convincing, totally unflinching, and excruciatingly heartbreaking to watch. The most important part of a great performance is to not see the actor through the character they're playing, and when they disappear into a role, it's really breathtaking to witness. That's exactly what Knightley does with the role of Sabina; she doesn't just play her, she becomes her.I've been a great admirer for the most part of Knightley's roles of late now that she is unshackled from having to be the prissy quasi-adventurer of the terrible PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series, and that can really be initially witnessed through her transformation into ""Domino"" Harvey in Tony Scott's DOMINO (a film worth seeing once, but not much more than that), and her stellar work in Mark Romanek's underrated and underseen NEVER LET ME GO. This is the performance I've been waiting for from her, and believe me it's well worth the wait.Cronenberg doesn't stray too far away from his favorite subject of sexuality and the modern mind/body, and he does extract some kink from what might otherwise be a beautifully acted and shot but all-too-safe biopic, and the sado-masochism this film displays does fit within the confines of this film and this subject matter. Mortensen shines as Freud, a man full of wisdom and bonhomie, but also a man filled with trepidation. Fassbender is fascinating as a Jung, the ""son"" to Freud's ""father"" of the field of psychoanalysis, and as a man who is of two minds about a great many things, but is steadfast in his belief that Freud's ""talking cure"" has to evolve. Cassel as Gross is hypnotic in his own twisted way as a early 20th-Century hippie; a practitioner of polygamy, a man who uses drugs to expand his consciousness; a man constantly in search of pleasure and looked to cure those who would deny themselves pleasure. Jung is the man caught between all of these characters; Freud, Gross and Spielrein... all of them seem to pull him in different directions, but all of them help to shape the man he would become.A DANGEROUS METHOD is more than just a story about two of the most significant minds of the 20th Century and the woman that would come between them; it's about the first ripple of a movement that would change everything in the world to come, and Cronenberg does this ripple great justice.",5,A Dangerous Performance by Knightley.,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,3769,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Cronenberg', 'have', 'been', 'VIDEODROME', ""'m"", 'really', 'appreciating', 'filmmaker', 'grown', 'refused', 'pigeon-hole', 'just', 'making', 'hyper-violent', 'horrifically', 'unnerving', 'psuedo-sexual', 'horror', 'suspense', 'films', 'SPIDER', 'A', 'HISTORY', 'OF', 'VIOLENCE', 'started', 'entering', 'world', 'fully', 'mature', 'director', 'who', 'could', 'now', 'play', 'toys', 'cinema', 'had', 'offer', 'though', 'came', 'safest', 'film', 'EASTERN', 'PROMISES', 'other', 'bravura', 'performance', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'sadly', 'forgettable', 'film', 'A', 'DANGEROUS', 'METHOD', 'genre', 'filmmaking', 'Historical', 'Biopic.Aside', 'excellent', 'unsurprisingly', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'storytelling', 'great', 'performances', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'Otto', 'Gross', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'real', 'standout', 'here', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'brilliant', 'uncompromising', 'performance', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Jung', 'hospital', 'treatment', 'catalyst', 'drama', 'film', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'giving', 'film', 'less', 'stellar', 'reviews', 'are', 'singling', 'out', 'Knightley', 'overacting', 'when', 'throes', 'hysteria', 'Obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'historical', 'documentarians', 'accounts', 'very', 'successful', 'recreation', 'woman', 'suffering', 'hysteria', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'exacting', 'duplication', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'totally', 'unflinching', 'excruciatingly', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'great', 'performance', 'not', 'see', 'actor', 'character', ""'re"", 'playing', 'when', 'disappear', 'role', 'really', 'breathtaking', 'witness', 'exactly', 'what', 'Knightley', 'role', 'Sabina', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'her.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'admirer', 'most', 'part', 'Knightley', 'roles', 'late', 'now', 'unshackled', 'having', 'be', 'prissy', 'quasi-adventurer', 'terrible', 'PIRATES', 'THE', 'CARIBBEAN', 'series', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'initially', 'witnessed', 'transformation', 'Domino', 'Harvey', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'DOMINO', 'film', 'seeing', 'once', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'stellar', 'work', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'underrated', 'underseen', 'NEVER', 'LET', 'ME', 'GO', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'believe', 'well', 'wait.Cronenberg', ""n't"", 'stray', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'favorite', 'subject', 'sexuality', 'modern', 'mind/body', 'extract', 'kink', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'shot', 'all-too-safe', 'biopic', 'sado-masochism', 'film', 'fit', 'confines', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'Mortensen', 'Freud', 'man', 'full', 'wisdom', 'bonhomie', 'also', 'man', 'filled', 'trepidation', 'Fassbender', 'fascinating', 'Jung', 'son', 'Freud', 'father', 'field', 'psychoanalysis', 'man', 'who', 'two', 'minds', 'great', 'many', 'things', 'steadfast', 'belief', 'Freud', 'talking', 'cure', 'evolve', 'Cassel', 'Gross', 'hypnotic', 'own', 'twisted', 'way', 'early', '20th-Century', 'hippie', 'practitioner', 'polygamy', 'man', 'who', 'drugs', 'expand', 'consciousness', 'man', 'constantly', 'search', 'pleasure', 'looked', 'cure', 'who', 'would', 'deny', 'pleasure', 'Jung', 'man', 'caught', 'characters', 'Freud', 'Gross', 'Spielrein', 'seem', 'pull', 'different', 'directions', 'help', 'shape', 'man', 'would', 'become.A', 'DANGEROUS', 'METHOD', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'two', 'most', 'significant', 'minds', '20th', 'Century', 'woman', 'would', 'come', 'first', 'ripple', 'movement', 'would', 'change', 'everything', 'world', 'come', 'Cronenberg', 'ripple', 'great', 'justice']",N/A
1518909,A1A535W556ROBQ,B006PTL1GC,James Ferguson,"[2, 3]","Historic dramas have become quite popular in recent years, but I would have never imagined someone taking on Freud and Jung, particularly in this way.  It is a story mostly about Carl Jung's tumultuous relationship with Sabina Spielrein, with Freud as a secondary, albeit important figure in the film.  Vincent Cassel almost steals the show as the randy Otto Gross, who essentially pushes Jung into a relationship with Spielrein by encouraging him to follow his emotions.  This is more a dramatic vehicle than it is a study of psychoanalysis, probably more influenced by the method acting of Stanislavsky than it was the so-called ""dangerous method"" of Freud. As such, the acting is impeccable.  Viggo Mortensen gives a wonderfully deft touch to Freud, Michael Fassbender captures the repressed emotional state of Jung perfectly, and Keira Knightley gives a stand-out performance as Sabina Spielrein.  David Cronenberg uses letters to give the story an air of verisimilitude, but the story shouldn't be taken as fact.  It is more based on thestage productionby Christopher Hampton, than it is thebookby John Kerr.  As the film winds all too quickly to an end on the eve of World War I, it leaves you begging for more.What I liked most is that Cronenberg avoided reducing his historic figures to caricatures.  He reveals them to be the complicated individuals that they were, and that we can't hope to understand them.  What we can do is enjoy this little slice of their lives, as they intersected in early 20th century Europe.  Yet, Cronenberg touches on so many aspects on Freud's and Jung's psychoanalytical views, including dreams, as they sail to America together.  He provides a fascinating portrait of Sabina Spielrein, who was brought to Jung on the verge of complete emotional collapse. Through his calm counseling and eventually through their love affair would become a leading psychoanalyst herself, with the further tutelage of Freud. This was a tumultuous time with the advent not only of modern thinking that would  reshape science and the arts, but also of modern war, which would turn Europe on its end in World War I, alluded to by Jung's dream at the end of the film.

Keira Knightley, Viggo Mortensen, and Michael Fassbender each portray highly intelligent, complex characters and they do it so convincingly.Keira plays a tormented young woman who first visits the clinic to receive treatments for her bizarre behavior caused by an abusive father and neglectful mother. Her tics and mannerisms are so severe and disturbing that it is, at times, difficult to watch. Jung allows her to assist him in some of his therapy experiments, and this activity, and her burgeoning interest in psychotherapy, allows her to find her way back to relative normalcy. Along the way, she and Jung have an affair, which is the ""dangerous"" part of the method. She is quite addicted to Jung, though he eventually breaks it off and severs contact with her for a while.The long conversations between Jung and Freud about methods and approaches are quite interesting, and most are set in Freud's office, which is filled with books and objets d'art. A rift develops between the two doctors over time as they disagree more and more on the developing therapies.The sets and costumes in the film are sumptuous, and the glimpse into the history of psychotherapy is quite interesting.

During it's all-too-brief 99-minute running time, it attempts to tackle the birth and eventual dissolution of the friendship between Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Jung's almost subconscious dissatisfaction with his family life, the torrid, potentially destructive affair Jung has with one of his patients, a major load of various psychosexual and philosophical themes, and the birth of psychoanalysis and - eventually, in many ways - modern psychology. That's a whole lot to heap on one film's plate. And that's just the problem; it is simply far too much to satisfactorily explore with any real depth in a mere 99 minutes. In order to succeed, one of two things needed to be done:1. Expand this to at least three hours.2. More realistically, choose one of those ideas and explore it at length. Wrench every last drop of psychological drama and substance from it. Use it to present a small, focused set of themes and ideas that form a film with substance. Use them to suggest something interesting. Use them to say something about human nature. Use them to do anything memorable!Instead, screenwriter Christopher Hampton seems too married to all of the different story elements of his own play to effectively edit out what may be unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Personally, I think this would have been most interesting had it focused solely on the relationship between Jung and Freud; what initially connects them and unites them as colleagues, and the eventual personal and ideological conflicts that inevitably lead to their parting ways, and what could arguably be considered a rivalry. But all of the other pieces of the film - mainly the relationship between Jung and his mentally unstable mistress - get in the way of that potentially fascinating storyline and, as a result, everything the film presents feels surface level, as if we're only seeing the tip of the proverbial iceberg.There may be no type of film more frustrating than A Dangerous Method - a film so rich with ideas and so unsure of what to do with them.",3,The Waste of Ideas Unexplored,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",2012,2102,"['Dangerous', 'Method', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'accused', 'lack', 'ideas', 'all-too-brief', '99-minute', 'running', 'time', 'tackle', 'birth', 'eventual', 'dissolution', 'friendship', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'almost', 'subconscious', 'dissatisfaction', 'family', 'life', 'torrid', 'potentially', 'destructive', 'affair', 'Jung', 'one', 'patients', 'major', 'load', 'various', 'psychosexual', 'philosophical', 'themes', 'birth', 'psychoanalysis', 'eventually', 'many', 'ways', 'modern', 'psychology', 'whole', 'lot', 'heap', 'one', 'film', 'plate', 'just', 'problem', 'simply', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'satisfactorily', 'explore', 'real', 'depth', 'mere', '99', 'minutes', 'order', 'succeed', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'needed', 'be', 'done:1', 'Expand', 'least', 'three', 'hours.2', 'More', 'realistically', 'choose', 'one', 'ideas', 'explore', 'length', 'Wrench', 'last', 'drop', 'psychological', 'drama', 'substance', 'Use', 'present', 'small', 'focused', 'set', 'themes', 'ideas', 'form', 'film', 'substance', 'Use', 'suggest', 'something', 'interesting', 'Use', 'say', 'something', 'human', 'nature', 'Use', 'do', 'anything', 'memorable', 'Instead', 'screenwriter', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'too', 'married', 'different', 'story', 'elements', 'own', 'play', 'effectively', 'edit', 'out', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'unimportant', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'Personally', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'interesting', 'had', 'focused', 'solely', 'relationship', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'what', 'initially', 'colleagues', 'eventual', 'personal', 'ideological', 'conflicts', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'parting', 'ways', 'what', 'could', 'arguably', 'be', 'considered', 'rivalry', 'other', 'pieces', 'film', 'mainly', 'relationship', 'Jung', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'mistress', 'get', 'way', 'potentially', 'fascinating', 'storyline', 'result', 'everything', 'film', 'presents', 'feels', 'surface', 'level', ""'re"", 'only', 'seeing', 'tip', 'proverbial', 'iceberg.There', 'may', 'be', 'type', 'film', 'more', 'frustrating', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'film', 'so', 'rich', 'ideas', 'so', 'unsure', 'what', 'do']",N/A

This is a superb story about a very difficult subject,  handled with sensitivity and intelligence. This will really mean a lot to those who are familiar with Freud's theory and how he and Jung collaborated and then split some seven years later before the beginning of WW1.This is the type of movie that makes you think and if you are familiar with the history of psychoanalysis, this is about as good as it gets. Freud and some of the people that he worked with were among the greatest thinkers ever. Jung, Adler, Otto Rank are in that group. Some of the occurrences presented are almost exactly as I remember reading about them many years ago. This is a classic confrontation between an analytical thinker (Freud) and a Intuitive thinker (Jung), both giants of intellect, but very human. These men were scientists, trying to dissect and understand the nature of reality and the essence of raw experience without psychic defenses or repressions. It could have destroyed them. Freud had more than one ""fainting spell"" and Jung had a nervous breakdown. It was indeed a ""Dangerous Method"".An important female character enters the picture but I'm not going to give more away about this movie.  I will say this, she may have understood everything, better than Freud or Jung. If you like this kind of subject you need to see this...Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors. So is David Lynch. You could say that Cronenberg is a very analytical and exact director whereas Lynch is more intuitive and mystical. That's the way I see it anyway.

It follows Carl Jung and details his relationship with Sigmund Freud and the development of psychoanalysis.It's not typically my type of movie, but I didn't get bored not one time (and that is super rare for me in something like this.) But here's why I liked it.The movie is complex. And I think the directors and actors handled the material very well. Michael Fassbender did a great job showing Jung's struggles to stick to own theories while feeling the pressure to conform to Freud's (played by Viggo Mortenson) ""scientific"" (and mostly sex-obsessed) approach to psychology.The movie starts in 1904 when Jung takes on the hysterical Sabina Speilrein, a Russian Jew (played oddly by Keira Knightly) and tries out Freud's new psychoanalytic theories on her. It works wonders and she not only makes vast improvements but grows up and becomes invested in the field herself.The rift between Freud and Jung start when Jung realizes that Freud will never see him as an equal, though Freud tries to spin it as disgust at Jung's affair with Sabina. It seemed to be Freud was threatened by Jung and tried to shut him up by saying that Jung's theories would ruin and discredit the field of psychology.I had a little bit of a hard time being convinced that Keira Knightly was Russian or a Jew. Her accent seemed a little inconsistent at times, but I think she did the best she could and that helped me look past it. The significance of Sabina & Freud being Jewish and Jung being a Swiss-Reformed Aryan is only slightly touched upon. I think they could have delved a little deeper into that, but the movie wanted to keep the majority of the focus on Jung's relationships with Freud & Sabina and also Jung's relationship with himself and how he goes from being a student of Freud's and doubting himself to being one the leading psychologists of his time.For me it was especially interesting to follow Jung as I didn't know nearly as much about him as I knew about Freud.

Michael Fassbender steals the show as Dr. Carl Jung. A Dangerous Method is part biographical, part drama and part thriller. It is an exploration of psychology and the men behind it: Dr. Sigmund Freud and Dr. Carl Jung. The movie starts in 1904. I would say the portrayal of Dr. Jung is not completely flattering because the film does poke some fun at both men and offers witty dialogue. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and would say most students of psychology and fans of the director will appreciate it. It's not a documentary but you can have fun with it. Some of the director's sense of humor comes through when Jung and Freud are eating together. It's subtle but laugh out loud funny at times. The picture quality in this release is superb and the audio is almost as amazing. Sony did an excellent job on the transfer. My only complaint is that Cronenberg's ""new flesh"" signature is absent from this film unlike his classic work (Scanners, Videodrome, Existenz). There is also 39 minutes of bonus content and an audio commentary. Ignore the bad reviews (3.4 stars on Amazon) because if you like psychology and Cronenberg you won't be disappointed.

1518927,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B006PTL1GC,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","David Cronenberg likes to take on sexually and violently charged controversies, so it's not surprising that he was attracted by Christopher Hampton's play ""The Talking Cure"", whose storyline was based on the book ""A Most Dangerous Method"" by John Kerr, an exploration of the role that Russian psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein played in the relationship between Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in the years before World War I. Christopher Hampton wrote the screenplay for ""A Dangerous Method"" as well, and that is evident in the strong dialogue.In 1904, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), daughter of wealthy Russian Jews, is brought to the Burgh&ouml;lzhi Clinic in Zurich in a state of hysteria. Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) wants to try the theoretical ""talking cure"" developed by Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) on her. Conveniently, Miss Spielrein turns out to be a masochist who is sexually excited by humiliation. Sabina recovers and enrolls at university with the intention of becoming a psychoanalyst herself. But her aggressive, raw sexuality proves too much for Carl Jung to resist, which eventually threatens his social standing and his already ideologically strained relationship with Freud.I was surprised that I liked this film as much as I did, because I have never found the work of either Freud or Jung the least bit interesting. I find them both largely fanciful. But there is more insight into the human psyche to be found in the ideological and personal conflicts between Freud and Jung than in anything those men published. There is real drama in their creeping hatred for one another. Freud's insistence on an exclusively sexual interpretation of clinical material versus Jung's increasingly far flung interests in parapsychology. This is exacerbated by conflicts of class, ethnicity, and personality. In walks Sabina Spielrein to stir it all up, in love with Jung but usually siding with Freud.I'm not sure if Keira Knightley overacted Sabina Spielrein's illness, but she deftly conveys Sabina's bright, self-possessed, but slightly nutty character for most of the film. Viggo Mortensen is unrecognizable as Sigmund Freud. It's not just the make-up. His voice is unlike I've ever heard it before.

The focus is upon Dr. Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Carl Jung (played by Michael Fassbender) shortly before World War I takes place and Jung is helping a disturbed patient named Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) who later becomes his lover for experimental sexual pleasures and even later a psychotherapist with her own views. There seems to be a strong push and pull feel between rationalistic psychology of Freud and intuitive psychology of Jung with some subdued conflict between the two personalities. On the whole it's an interesting look at three historical people back in the day but I've heard there are some historical inaccuracies or improper delivery of certain theories. An end narration of what happened to each of these three people follows at the end of the picture.As the topic is narrowly focused and not ""high concept"" it will have a ""boutique"" style audience, I suspect, but still a good movie if you find the details interesting. Minor nudity, people.

This early look at what became known as psychoanalysis is focused on a young disciple of Freud's, Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender, ""Prometheus"").An early patient of Jung was a disturbed young woman who had prolonged fits of hysteria.  Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) suffered abuse as a child and had grown to enjoy sexual pleasure from pain although she remained a virgin until Jung fell in love with her.  Jung was happily married with several children, but couldn't resist Spielrein once her health improved and she was no longer his patient.  In one great scene after their affair was over, a now married and pregnant Spielrein asks Jung if ""he had taken on any other `admirers'.""  He replied ""you were the jewel of great price.""  Great words from writer Christopher Hampton.Director David Cronenberg (""Eastern Promises"") uses a vast library of coorespondence between the characters to develop the film.  The sets and locations in Austria and Germany are beautiful and appear authentic.  Again much information on this era was available to the filmmakers.  They got it right.  Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, ""A History of Violence"") eventually mentors Spielrein who becomes an influential child psychologist of the day.  His relationship with Jung begins to sour, however, as Jung believes Freud is too narrow-minded in his analyses.  The film is provocative and sometimes erotic.  Mortensen and Fassbender deliver understated performances and Knightley gets your attention when she goes into full hysteria mode as Spielrein.  You may hate her or love her, but you'll surely remember her.  The movie certainly isn't for everyone, but I liked it.I could find no fault with this Blu ray 1080p transfer.  Using a 1.85:1 aspect ratio every detail is perfect.  Dark shots are dark and exterior well lit shots are beautiful.  This is really a great film to look at.  The audio is near perfect as well.

1518931,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B006PTL1GC,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[0, 0]","Essentially this is a movie about Jung and the significant relationships in his life - with his forerunner and contemporary in psychoanalysis, Freud, with his rich and patient wife, and perhaps most of all with the patient with whom he falls in love and has an affair, Sabina Spielrein.  It's hard to see the Cronenberg of old who would delve into murkiness and come up with visually inventive and often shocking ideas.. here, the photography is bright and crisp, the mannerisms impeccable and the period seemingly immaculately recreated.  The pace is measured, and in the manner of the time, ""violent arguments"" are mere words on paper, so much of what was said being done by letter.  Indeed, it is through the letters of Freud and Jung so much is known about them, apparently.  So it's a biography, covering the pivotal career trajectory of Jung.  And yet for all the willingness to show things for how they were (Knightley has a brave and deliberate performance, which was apparently well researched, as the detail rich commentary by Cronenberg attests), is less emotionally involving, and more.. well, clinical, if you'll forgive the analogy.  The details are interesting and well observed, the history of the two men in particular is of some significance, and yet for all the fine performances it is hard to truly be engaged emotionally.  Fassbender has a wonderful performance as Jung, finding out about himself as much as about his patients at times, and Mortensen is really wonderfully understated as he puffs his pipe, and wrestles with his opinion of the man he had hoped would carry his work forward.  Their interplay during their period of friendship is arguably the movies highlight, as they ponder each others dreams..""Have you considered the rolling log could be your penis..?"".  Knightley has done a great job in a difficult role, having to convince as someone seriously mentally ill at the start, but who went on to become a significant psychoanalyst in her own right.  Alas, her Russian accent, while not awful, leaves you forever reminded she is acting, when everyone else speaks perfectly normally.  It's defensible from a movie convention point of view, but distracts.Taken on its own, without any preconceptions, this is a well crafted and visually beautifully conceived movie.  It's just hard sometimes to forget that with Cronenberg we so often expect something with more bite.  Without that bite,  what we are left with is a biopic that educates a little, engages somewhat less, but is so beautifully shot and acted, it's like a Merchant Ivory film with added rude words.  6/10",3,Cronenberg goes Merchant Ivory..?,1342915200,"07 22, 2012",2012,2602,"['Essentially', 'movie', 'Jung', 'significant', 'relationships', 'life', 'forerunner', 'contemporary', 'psychoanalysis', 'Freud', 'rich', 'patient', 'wife', 'perhaps', 'most', 'patient', 'whom', 'love', 'affair', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'hard', 'see', 'Cronenberg', 'old', 'who', 'would', 'delve', 'murkiness', 'come', 'up', 'visually', 'inventive', 'often', 'shocking', 'ideas..', 'here', 'photography', 'bright', 'crisp', 'mannerisms', 'impeccable', 'period', 'seemingly', 'immaculately', 'recreated', 'pace', 'measured', 'manner', 'time', 'violent', 'arguments', 'are', 'mere', 'words', 'paper', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'being', 'done', 'letter', 'Indeed', 'letters', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'so', 'much', 'known', 'apparently', 'biography', 'covering', 'pivotal', 'career', 'trajectory', 'Jung', 'yet', 'willingness', 'show', 'things', 'how', 'were', 'Knightley', 'brave', 'deliberate', 'performance', 'was', 'apparently', 'well', 'researched', 'detail', 'rich', 'commentary', 'Cronenberg', 'attests', 'less', 'emotionally', 'involving', 'more..', 'well', 'clinical', ""'ll"", 'forgive', 'analogy', 'details', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'observed', 'history', 'two', 'men', 'particular', 'significance', 'yet', 'fine', 'performances', 'hard', 'truly', 'be', 'engaged', 'emotionally', 'Fassbender', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Jung', 'finding', 'out', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'patients', 'times', 'Mortensen', 'really', 'wonderfully', 'understated', 'pipe', 'wrestles', 'opinion', 'man', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'carry', 'work', 'forward', 'interplay', 'period', 'friendship', 'arguably', 'movies', 'highlight', 'ponder', 'others', 'dreams..', 'Have', 'considered', 'rolling', 'log', 'could', 'be', 'penis..', 'Knightley', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'difficult', 'role', 'having', 'convince', 'someone', 'seriously', 'mentally', 'ill', 'start', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'significant', 'psychoanalyst', 'own', 'right', 'Alas', 'Russian', 'accent', 'not', 'awful', 'forever', 'reminded', 'acting', 'when', 'everyone', 'else', 'perfectly', 'normally', 'defensible', 'movie', 'convention', 'point', 'view', 'own', 'preconceptions', 'well', 'crafted', 'visually', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'movie', 'just', 'hard', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'Cronenberg', 'so', 'often', 'expect', 'something', 'more', 'bite', 'bite', 'what', 'are', 'left', 'biopic', 'little', 'somewhat', 'less', 'so', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'acted', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'film', 'added', 'rude', 'words', '6/10']",N/A

On the historic side this movie introduces us to a young Carl Jung Carl a doctor first experimenting with the new Freudian psychoanalytic methods, his older father figure Sigmund Freud and the wildly hysterical Sabina Spielrein. These are three historical figures two known to us, one almost forgotten. In fact the three of them had some type of relationship although perhaps not as portrayed. There exists extensive record of close friends Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud and their breakup is a matter of historic record. The Russian born Sabina Spielrein did first enter this group as a patient and later as a leading light in founding the field of child psychology. She would know the two men quite well the record is not clear if she would become a mistress to either.Between the quality of the acting the costumes and sets this is a five-star movie. The problem is in the story line. Upon reflection it does not hold together. Specifically the arguments being presented by the principles and the principal visuals do not coincide.As A Dangerous Method would have it, Dr. Jung would become passionately involved with his former patient and provide her with the S and M sex she wanted.  To dispense with the sexual side of the movie Sabrina clearly enjoys her role on the receiving end of violent sex.  Carl is not portrayed as enjoying it very much. He looks to be experimenting with sex as therapy rather than a means of  allowing either himself or her to experience the freedom that is one of the central themes of the larger story.The inconsistency is that Dr. Jung argues that Freud is wrong in assigning sexuality as the single driving force behind psychology. However it is the sexual activity between Carl and Sabrina that consumes a very large portion of the movie. What in fact drove the breakup between these two founding giants. is that Dr. Jung developed a number of theories largely emphasizing elements such as racial memory. For racial memory to work people would receive particular impulses genetically. In the early 1900s there was no scientific basis for genetics at this level and the specificity of racial memory still sounds more mystical than scientific. Very little of the story line in A Dangerous Method covers or clarifies the their differences.The good news is that the principal actors Michael Fassbender (Carl Jung), Kiera Knightley (Sabina Spielrein) and Viggo Mortensen (Dr. Freud) perform their roles brilliantly under the very tight direction of David Cronenberg. Miss Knightley portrayal of hysteria and her transition into a trained psychologist are exceptional performances. The bulk of the dialogue of this movie is thought-provoking the sexual visuals do not support the intellectual themes.This is not a popcorn movie. The hysterical version of Sabrina makes demands on the viewer. The sex scenes whiel kinky are more clinical than titivating. Consequently the audience for this movie is going to be those who do not plan to turn off their brains, are not too committed to absolute historical accuracy and are not going to turn away at the first sign of a bared nipple.",3,"Can intellectuals have fun while having kinky, out of bounds sex?",1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,3261,"['naughty', 'sophisticated', 'intellectual', 'Europeans', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'not', 'casually', 'naughty', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'thinking', 'historic', 'side', 'movie', 'young', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Carl', 'doctor', 'first', 'experimenting', 'new', 'Freudian', 'psychoanalytic', 'methods', 'older', 'father', 'figure', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'wildly', 'hysterical', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'are', 'three', 'historical', 'figures', 'two', 'known', 'one', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'fact', 'three', 'had', 'type', 'relationship', 'perhaps', 'not', 'portrayed', 'extensive', 'record', 'close', 'friends', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'breakup', 'matter', 'historic', 'record', 'Russian', 'born', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'did', 'first', 'enter', 'group', 'patient', 'later', 'leading', 'light', 'founding', 'field', 'child', 'psychology', 'would', 'know', 'two', 'men', 'quite', 'well', 'record', 'not', 'clear', 'would', 'become', 'mistress', 'either.Between', 'quality', 'acting', 'costumes', 'sets', 'five-star', 'movie', 'problem', 'story', 'line', 'reflection', 'not', 'hold', 'together', 'Specifically', 'arguments', 'being', 'presented', 'principles', 'principal', 'visuals', 'do', 'not', 'coincide.As', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'would', 'have', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'would', 'become', 'passionately', 'involved', 'former', 'patient', 'provide', 'S', 'M', 'sex', 'wanted', 'dispense', 'sexual', 'side', 'movie', 'Sabrina', 'clearly', 'role', 'receiving', 'end', 'violent', 'sex', 'Carl', 'not', 'portrayed', 'enjoying', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'experimenting', 'sex', 'therapy', 'rather', 'means', 'allowing', 'experience', 'freedom', 'one', 'central', 'themes', 'larger', 'story.The', 'inconsistency', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'wrong', 'assigning', 'sexuality', 'single', 'driving', 'force', 'psychology', 'However', 'sexual', 'activity', 'Carl', 'Sabrina', 'very', 'large', 'portion', 'movie', 'What', 'fact', 'breakup', 'two', 'founding', 'giants', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'developed', 'number', 'theories', 'largely', 'emphasizing', 'elements', 'such', 'racial', 'memory', 'racial', 'memory', 'work', 'people', 'would', 'receive', 'particular', 'impulses', 'genetically', 'early', '1900s', 'was', 'scientific', 'basis', 'genetics', 'level', 'specificity', 'racial', 'memory', 'still', 'more', 'mystical', 'scientific', 'Very', 'little', 'story', 'line', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'differences.The', 'good', 'news', 'principal', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Dr.', 'Freud', 'perform', 'roles', 'brilliantly', 'very', 'tight', 'direction', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'Miss', 'Knightley', 'portrayal', 'hysteria', 'transition', 'trained', 'psychologist', 'are', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'bulk', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'thought-provoking', 'sexual', 'visuals', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'intellectual', 'themes.This', 'not', 'popcorn', 'movie', 'hysterical', 'version', 'Sabrina', 'demands', 'viewer', 'sex', 'scenes', 'kinky', 'are', 'more', 'clinical', 'titivating', 'Consequently', 'audience', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'plan', 'turn', 'off', 'brains', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'committed', 'absolute', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'turn', 'away', 'first', 'sign', 'bared', 'nipple']",N/A

When this film came out I didn't see it as I didn't see it as I feared it might be a Hollywood-ization of the man and I had too much respect for him to bear watching it.So, now that I saw it on DVD, I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was, or not as bad as I'd feared..  I thought it did a pretty good job of presenting the differences in the theories of the two great men and their personal relationship.  What bothered me,was the emphasis on the relationship between Jung and his patient, Sabina, I can understand how they wanted to spice up what could have been a dull academic study with some sex and romance, but since there is no historical proof that such a relationship existed, I think it's a mistake to present it as the centerpiece of the film.  indeed it seems to say that this relationship was responsible for Jung's development as a whole human being, or something like that.  In addition, Keira Knightly's portrayal of er is so odious that it makes her attraction to Jung quite incredible.  I've enjoyed Knightly's performances in other films but in this, she was beyond bad.  Her facial expressions were grotesque and her accent was ................?!Jung, too, seems badly portrayed, as a terribly uptight fellow who doesn't seem particularly likable.  The most interesting of the main characters is Freud, portrayed by the always charming Viggo Mortensesn.  I would like to have seen Viggo play Jung and anyone else play Sabina. If they had to show so much of their romance they should have had some better actors play them.

1518944,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B006PTL1GC,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 2]","Period drama about early 1900s in Switzerland and Austria.  Freud is at the peak of his fame, practicing in Vienna.  His young follower Carl Jung works in psychiatric hospital in Switzerland and Freud considers him a golden boy and potential successor in a brand new way of psychoanalysis.  One day, Jung admits new patient, who is very receptive, very intelligent and yes, very neurotic.  In the course of him treating her, Jung falls for her.Cast of actors provides background in what is was to live in early 1900s just before the WWI.  There is also an aspect of class difference between Freud and Jung.  Freud is a self made man, pioneer of he new way of treating patients; he is pragmatic and intellectually sharp but also unforgiving.  Jung on the other hand is married to a wealthy woman and treats his practice as a hobby that over time becomes mix of scientific research and mysticism. Such apprach unlimately causes Freud and Jung ot part their ways on both personal and professional level.  Heavy in dialogue between all three characters, movie explores the relationship between all three of them, the infatuation Jung has for his young patient Sabina who herself trains to become a doctor and his intimate relationship with her in which by the end of affair there is a complete role reversal between the two.  Jung looses control of his emotions, purpose and life that plunges him into a nervous breakdown, while Sabina earns her medical degree, marries and moved to Russia where with her husband she trains young doctors interested in pursuing their career in psychotherapy.One must have undivided attention while watching this movie.  Every part of the dialog is important.  I loved dresses actresses wore in this movie.

1518945,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B006PTL1GC,RMurray847,"[13, 17]","A DANGEROUS METHOD is a heavily intellectual work, with a heavy emphasis on sex...much like the work of Sigmund Freud, one of the main characters in t his fascinating yet aloof film.The movie starts with a bang, as we see the clearly disturbed Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) being forcibly admitted to a hospital.  She is thrashing and contorting her face and body in remarkable ways.  Surely this woman is in for a lengthy asylum visit.But she is in fact going to be the first patient on which young Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) will be trying his new method of Psychanalysis (yes, t that's what he calls it at first).  He places Spielrein in a chair and sits behind her and encourages her to talk.  Soon, she is confronting her demons and confessing some pretty lurid sexual feelings, including the pleasure she receives from humiliation and physical punishment.From here, A DANGEROUS METHOD swings back and forth between being an interesting case study of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein and an intellectual tug of war between Jung, and his older mentor Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen).  In the first instance, we see that the rigid divide between patient and doctor is not quite so settled in 1904.  Jung continues to treat Spielrein, but because she has a keen intellect and interest in her own treatment, he puts her to work as a research assistant.  And we also see their relationship teetering towards something even more than professor & student.  In the second instance, there are dinner table conversations and exchanged letters between Jung & Freud, wherein Jung challenges Freud to think beyond the confines of everything in psychoanalysis (as Freud calls it) relating to sex.These Jung vs. Freud exchanges are INTERESTING.  They don't make for very exciting ENTERTAINMENT, however.  They feel a bit turgid.  Jung is, in many ways, such a fussbudget that he is incapable of small talk and only wants to challenge his mentor.  Freud, the elder statesman, isn't particularly inspired to fight back vigorously.  He is looking for a successor to himself and fancies that Jung will be such...but he also doesn't seem to embrace his role as inspiration and mentor.  He mostly seems vaguely bemused...at least until the relationship between Jung & Spielrein has a direct impact on the relationship between Jung & Freud.The movie is certainly interesting in that much of it is true, including word for word readings of the correspondence between these two influential men.  But the movie fails to be emotionally gripping on almost any level.  The relationship between Jung & Spielrein is never gripping, as both of these people are driven by passions out of their control, and frequently come across as being acted UPON rather than making choices and deciding on actions.  And the relationship between Jung & Freud comes across like a well-acted reenactment in a TV documentary about the two men.  This is all the more disappointing, because with a director like David Cronenberg at the helm, I had hoped for more twisted sparks.  I think he was constrained by the stage-bound screenplay, and perhaps felt the emotional turmoil surely roiling in these characters would play more than it does.  It is simply too far below the surface most of the time.Mortensen's role is fairly small, and we really only have the tiniest glimpse into Freud's life.  Fassbender is clearly a smart actor who understands the man he is playing on a very intellectual level, but what's missing is the sense that he is truly INHABITING his character...which is a shame, because Fassbender is such a terrifically physical actor.  Knightley has by far the flashiest role, and she is generally quite good.  Her character is the most interesting...and when reading the closing comments about what happens to each character...it's almost enough to make you want to read much more about her.  In many ways, this is the most ""grown up"" character Knightly has played.  She truly has a chance to mature into a woman.A DANGEROUS METHOD is gorgeously filmed, and many of the locations are the actual locations these events took place.  The pace is fairly brisk.  It is never uninteresting...but I really wanted to care more about these people.  It's tough to actually recommend this film to a general audience...if the subject matter is of particular interest to you, then you should probably see it.",3,"3.5 stars.

I thought I would get that out of the way because my kind words must stop at this point. ""A Dangerous Method"", the new film from the talented David Cronenberg, isn't the beauty of a movie that it looks.Coming from the usually inspired Cronenberg, who since the turn of the new millennium has been on a roll much the same way he had been on at the dawn of his career in the late 70's and early to mid 80's, re-teaming with his go to star Viggo Mortenson, playing Freud and is about the only actor who comes across well here, and a subject with great cinematic potential, it comes as a down right shock for it to end up as such an inferior piece of work. It is hard to pin point just where this train skidded off it's railing, because as I've already pointed out, it looks great. Somehow I feel much of the problem lies in the casting, otherwise great actors, Keira Knightley overacts her character's mannerisms and thick, and I do mean icky thick, Russian accent. Michael Fassbender, who I predict will become a huge star and is already a fine actor, can't give his Carl Jung any electricity to the point of tedium, watching him you feel as though you would rather watch anything else, he is the cinematic equivalent of paint drying in slow splotches. Still, the major fault of the picture, I think, must be laid at Cronenberg's feet, even though he tackles themes close to him and his other films, he just seems unable to work up much enthusiasm for the subject mater, this is something new, dull Cronenberg.Adapted by Christopher Hampton from his stage play, unseen by me, working with rich material that unfortunately goes nowhere. I do not doubt a fascinating story could and should be told in film about Carl Jung and Siegmund Freud and the dawning of psychoanalysis, but ""A Dangerous Method"" seems more interested in the inner desires and illicit affairs of Carl Jung, rather than the relationship with Freud or the pursuit of psychoanalysis. Frankly, I do not care about his love life, in fact if Knightley's character, Sabine, had been dropped from the story, I think we would have already had a vast improvement.

1518953,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B006PTL1GC,Sheryl Fechter,"[15, 20]","I can certainly see how the opinions of this movie may be totally scattered.  This could possibly depend on one's personal interest in the Physchiatric field of study, onto psychoanalysis, and just how far you are personally willing to take its concepts.This wonderfully informative movie, directed by David Cronenberg and based on a true story, begins in Switzerland in 1904, at the hospital where a younger Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) is busy working with patients.  He is a devout student of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories at the time.  Jung is married, and he and his wife are expecting their first child.Dr. Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen, who gives an excellent portrayal) is following as closely as can be to conventional thinking within the 'new study', which has vastly gained in popularity. Freud is a monogamous family man with several children.  He is now in his latter fifties and well respected in the medical community although is constrained to have his theories accepted in the society of the day.  He must conform to a certain degree as to not step on too many toes for 'the new thinking' to spread.Into Jung's peaceful hospital setting arrives the extreme patient, Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly in a brilliant performance); severely ill, contorting, screaming and resisting with all she has within her.  After a short course, Jung begins to work with her while talking being seated directly behind her.  He is asking questions while she is raging and convulsing in her chair.  Dr. Jung is trying to get to the origin of her illness as she tries so hard to answer the questions, suggestions, and to remember what has happened to her.Through a long journey of psychoanalysis, a peaceful time in the facility, and a job, of sorts, working in the testing that the doctor is doing.  He is finally able to reach her and to help turn her life back around after the horrific abuse she has sustained.  He is also able to see within her the drive she has of becoming a Dr. of Psychiatry herself, and encourages her forward. During her healing and beginning medical school, they become friends and confidants.After a couple of years Dr. Jung goes to Vienna to visit his mentor, Sigmund Freud, and to speak on many issues.  Dream interpretations, the patient Sabina, and ""the talking cure"" are discussed as the two colleagues begin to get to know each other much better and with a mutual respect.  They begin writing to each other, discussing new insights, even testing out dream  interpretations on each other.  Shortly after the two giant minds meet, Jung crosses the line and begins an aggressive affair with Sabina just as Freud had been suspecting.  The rumor mill has been aptly turning with Freud Jung although questioning him at the same time.The correspondence of Dr. Freud and Dr. Jung runs a course of approximately seven years as differences of opinion, and the two doctors realize just how different they are.  Jung being more of a visionary of Freudian archetypes and Freud more scientific to remain medically relevant within the limitations of the time.  The story also goes on between Jung and Sabina for the course of the movie with the addition of love, guilt, marriage, pregnancies and several other themes which are introduced and explored.  All three of the main actors present an exceptional portrayal of each doctor.I found this movie very astute.  Wonderfully driven with the dialogue and full of interesting theories. It is definitely an entertaining vehicle for learning some things about yourself in and through the doctor's discourse.",5,"""Only The Wounded Physician Can Hope To Heal"" - Carl Jung",1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,3577,"['can', 'certainly', 'see', 'how', 'opinions', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'totally', 'scattered', 'could', 'possibly', 'depend', 'one', 'personal', 'interest', 'Physchiatric', 'field', 'study', 'psychoanalysis', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'personally', 'willing', 'take', 'concepts.This', 'wonderfully', 'informative', 'movie', 'directed', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Switzerland', '1904', 'hospital', 'where', 'younger', 'Dr.', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'busy', 'working', 'patients', 'devout', 'student', 'Dr.', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'theories', 'time', 'Jung', 'married', 'wife', 'are', 'expecting', 'first', 'child.Dr', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'who', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'following', 'as', 'closely', 'can', 'be', 'conventional', 'thinking', ""'new"", 'study', 'vastly', 'gained', 'popularity', 'Freud', 'monogamous', 'family', 'man', 'several', 'children', 'now', 'latter', 'fifties', 'well', 'respected', 'medical', 'community', 'constrained', 'have', 'theories', 'accepted', 'society', 'day', 'must', 'conform', 'certain', 'degree', 'not', 'step', 'too', 'many', 'toes', ""'the"", 'new', 'thinking', 'spread.Into', 'Jung', 'peaceful', 'hospital', 'setting', 'extreme', 'patient', 'Sabina', 'Spielrein', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'severely', 'ill', 'contorting', 'screaming', 'resisting', 'short', 'course', 'Jung', 'work', 'talking', 'being', 'seated', 'directly', 'asking', 'questions', 'raging', 'convulsing', 'chair', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'trying', 'get', 'origin', 'illness', 'so', 'hard', 'answer', 'questions', 'suggestions', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'her.Through', 'long', 'journey', 'psychoanalysis', 'peaceful', 'time', 'facility', 'job', 'sorts', 'working', 'testing', 'doctor', 'doing', 'finally', 'able', 'reach', 'help', 'turn', 'life', 'back', 'horrific', 'abuse', 'sustained', 'also', 'able', 'see', 'drive', 'becoming', 'Dr.', 'Psychiatry', 'forward', 'healing', 'beginning', 'medical', 'school', 'become', 'friends', 'confidants.After', 'couple', 'years', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'Vienna', 'visit', 'mentor', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'speak', 'many', 'issues', 'Dream', 'interpretations', 'patient', 'Sabina', 'talking', 'cure', 'are', 'discussed', 'two', 'colleagues', 'begin', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'much', 'better', 'mutual', 'respect', 'begin', 'writing', 'other', 'discussing', 'new', 'insights', 'even', 'testing', 'out', 'dream', 'interpretations', 'other', 'Shortly', 'two', 'giant', 'minds', 'meet', 'Jung', 'line', 'aggressive', 'affair', 'Sabina', 'just', 'Freud', 'had', 'been', 'suspecting', 'rumor', 'mill', 'been', 'aptly', 'turning', 'Freud', 'Jung', 'questioning', 'same', 'time.The', 'correspondence', 'Dr.', 'Freud', 'Dr.', 'Jung', 'course', 'approximately', 'seven', 'years', 'differences', 'opinion', 'two', 'doctors', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'different', 'are', 'Jung', 'being', 'more', 'visionary', 'Freudian', 'archetypes', 'Freud', 'more', 'scientific', 'remain', 'medically', 'relevant', 'limitations', 'time', 'story', 'also', 'Jung', 'Sabina', 'course', 'movie', 'addition', 'love', 'guilt', 'marriage', 'pregnancies', 'several', 'other', 'themes', 'are', 'introduced', 'explored', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'present', 'exceptional', 'portrayal', 'doctor.I', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'astute', 'Wonderfully', 'dialogue', 'full', 'interesting', 'theories', 'definitely', 'entertaining', 'vehicle', 'learning', 'things', 'doctor', 'discourse']",N/A

1518955,A3P222CN9HAPTF,B006PTL1GC,"Steve Benner ""Stonegnome""","[1, 1]","""A Dangerous Method"", directed by David Cronenberg, is a screen adaptation by Christopher Hampton of his own stage play, ""The Talking Cure"". The idea for this biographical drama derives from John Kerr's scholastic study of 1994, ""A Most Dangerous Method"", which chronicles the rise of psychoanalysis as a clinical treatment of hysteria and other mental conditions and explores the relationship between Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and the catalytic role played in both the establishment and demise of that relationship by Sabine Spielrein.  The book is long and detailed in its subject matter, documenting not only clinical methods but also placing events into the social context of their time. It presents an interweaving not just of the personal desires, obsessions and paranoias of its central characters but also of wider events to spin a complex tale of politics, hysteria, anti-Semitism, sexual duplicity, repression and intellectual brilliance wielded as blackmail.Christopher Hampton has done a masterly job of extracting the human interest story from the wider academic treatment, making Sabine Spielrein the true protagonist of the drama. In the screenplay we see her gradual transformation from highly dysfunctional hysteric to eminent and respected psychoanalyst in her own right.  Along the way, she becomes Jung's mistress and is shown as herself being pivotal in a number of the turning points in his life. Alongside, the film details the development of the friendship of the two principal proponents of the emerging field of psychoanalysis, following by the gradual divergence of their ideas, fueled by the inherent differences in the characters and the circumstances in their lives. And always, it seems, with Sabine Spielrein in the mix somewhere.While the exact details of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein remain speculative and conjectural, much of the screen adaptation is given greater authority by an almost obsessional attention to historical detail, with many of the scenes and much of the dialogue drawn from the copious notebooks, diaries and letters that all parties routinely kept and exchanged. There are nevertheless many aspects to the production that are distinctly Cronenberg in style and feel. Overall, he imbues an already uncomfortable tale with an air of voyeurism which shifts the original screenplay into a darker and more unsettling place altogether.The acting is by and large superb. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a brooding and somewhat paranoid Sigmund Freud is played to perfection -- and invariably with a cigar to his lips -- while Michael Fassbender does an admirable job of conveying Carl Jung's cautious and self-conscious approach to his own ideas which seems to have left him so susceptible and malleable in his relationships with others. Fassbender does a good job too of portraying Jung's own gradual mental disintegration at the approach of the Great War. Keira Knightly pulls off the role of unstable but brilliant Sabine Speilrein quite well, once one manages to ignore her fluctuating accent. Credit should also go to Vincent Cassel in his almost bit-part role of the wayward Otto Gross -- the serpent who mesmerises his prey -- as well as to newcomer, Sarah Gadon, whose quietly understated performance as Jung's wife, Emma, makes one wish that the writers had been able to find a way to include more of her story in the mix.  Cinematographically, the production is sumptuous (although let down by some over ambitious CGI work in places) whilst Howard Shore's Wagner-derived score is a perfect accompaniment to the scenes that call for it (and nicely absent when not).The DVD production also includes a brief ""Making of..."" feature, as well as informative commentary soundtrack by director, David Cronenberg, plus descriptive soundtrack for the unsighted.",4,Discomforting and voyeuristic biopic,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,3822,"['Dangerous', 'Method', 'directed', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'own', 'stage', 'play', 'Talking', 'Cure', 'idea', 'biographical', 'drama', 'John', 'Kerr', 'scholastic', 'study', '1994', 'Most', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'rise', 'psychoanalysis', 'clinical', 'treatment', 'hysteria', 'other', 'mental', 'conditions', 'relationship', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'catalytic', 'role', 'played', 'establishment', 'demise', 'relationship', 'Sabine', 'Spielrein', 'book', 'long', 'detailed', 'subject', 'matter', 'documenting', 'not', 'only', 'clinical', 'methods', 'also', 'placing', 'events', 'social', 'context', 'time', 'interweaving', 'not', 'just', 'personal', 'desires', 'obsessions', 'paranoias', 'central', 'characters', 'also', 'wider', 'events', 'spin', 'complex', 'tale', 'politics', 'hysteria', 'anti-Semitism', 'sexual', 'duplicity', 'repression', 'intellectual', 'brilliance', 'wielded', 'blackmail.Christopher', 'Hampton', 'done', 'masterly', 'job', 'extracting', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'wider', 'academic', 'treatment', 'making', 'Sabine', 'Spielrein', 'true', 'protagonist', 'drama', 'screenplay', 'see', 'gradual', 'transformation', 'highly', 'dysfunctional', 'hysteric', 'eminent', 'respected', 'psychoanalyst', 'own', 'right', 'way', 'Jung', 'mistress', 'shown', 'being', 'pivotal', 'number', 'turning', 'points', 'life', 'Alongside', 'film', 'details', 'development', 'friendship', 'two', 'principal', 'proponents', 'emerging', 'field', 'psychoanalysis', 'following', 'gradual', 'divergence', 'ideas', 'fueled', 'inherent', 'differences', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'lives', 'always', 'Sabine', 'Spielrein', 'mix', 'somewhere.While', 'exact', 'details', 'relationship', 'Jung', 'Spielrein', 'remain', 'speculative', 'conjectural', 'much', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'given', 'greater', 'authority', 'almost', 'obsessional', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'many', 'scenes', 'much', 'dialogue', 'drawn', 'copious', 'notebooks', 'diaries', 'letters', 'parties', 'routinely', 'kept', 'exchanged', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'many', 'aspects', 'production', 'are', 'distinctly', 'Cronenberg', 'style', 'feel', 'Overall', 'already', 'uncomfortable', 'tale', 'air', 'voyeurism', 'original', 'screenplay', 'darker', 'more', 'unsettling', 'place', 'altogether.The', 'acting', 'large', 'superb', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'portrayal', 'brooding', 'somewhat', 'paranoid', 'Sigmund', 'Freud', 'played', 'perfection', 'invariably', 'cigar', 'lips', 'Michael', 'Fassbender', 'admirable', 'job', 'conveying', 'Carl', 'Jung', 'cautious', 'self-conscious', 'approach', 'own', 'ideas', 'have', 'left', 'so', 'susceptible', 'malleable', 'relationships', 'others', 'Fassbender', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'portraying', 'Jung', 'own', 'gradual', 'mental', 'disintegration', 'approach', 'Great', 'War', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'role', 'unstable', 'brilliant', 'Sabine', 'Speilrein', 'quite', 'well', 'once', 'one', 'ignore', 'fluctuating', 'accent', 'Credit', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'Vincent', 'Cassel', 'almost', 'bit-part', 'role', 'wayward', 'Otto', 'Gross', 'serpent', 'who', 'prey', 'as', 'well', 'newcomer', 'Sarah', 'Gadon', 'quietly', 'understated', 'performance', 'Jung', 'wife', 'Emma', 'one', 'wish', 'writers', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'include', 'more', 'story', 'mix', 'Cinematographically', 'production', 'sumptuous', 'let', 'down', 'ambitious', 'CGI', 'work', 'places', 'whilst', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'Wagner-derived', 'score', 'perfect', 'accompaniment', 'scenes', 'call', 'nicely', 'absent', 'when', 'not', '.The', 'DVD', 'production', 'also', 'brief', 'Making', 'feature', 'as', 'well', 'informative', 'commentary', 'soundtrack', 'director', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'descriptive', 'soundtrack', 'unsighted']",N/A

The characters intersect, but not in any dramatic way. What I saw was a movie about the relationship between two giants in the founding of psychology. I found the clash of ideas, the class differences, and the struggle between rivalry and respect very interesting. The diversion caused by the insertion of Speilrein and her sexual and mental health issues was just that- a diversion. It was a topic of sufficient interest to merit it's own movie, but only served to distract from the story told here. What's worse was Knightly's presentation of her. I don't know whether it was her interpretation or the direction, but I have worked in an in patient setting treating seriously mentally ill people and have never seen anything like her performance. It made me want to roll my eyes and turn off the movie. Not only that but her weird accent was off- especially given that she was the only one to attempt an accent at all despite the fact that none of them were Americans.

worship of the One God , known then as the State.Psychoanalysis , created to suit the purposes and interests of Science , as an integrating , balancing Factor , to Psychiatry.Stuck between the two , were Freud , and Jung.Freud was used a lot as a materialist by some late 20th century Psychiatrists and extremist materialists , many funded by the State and even linked to Wall Street interests to scare UFO believers and other intelligent people into not talking about things openly , and if they did , they'd often be threatened with imprisonment where they'd officially be termed 'insane'while officially and unofficially treated as slaves.Their bodies were in turn to be used as fringes which would store all kinds of useless and highly dangerous drugs officially labelled 'antipsychotic'.Jung and Freud naturally had a disagreement , and when Freud saw Jung's apartment , he was shocked.Yet a lot of the elite in Freud's time who had tried to finance extremist materialistic ideas to keep the working class in line , died fools.The official explanation for Freud for a time seems to have been that he invented or established 20th century Psychiatry , or even reinvented 19th century Psychiatry, despite the fact is , that he was one of the founders , alongside Jung , of early 21th century Psychoanalysis , and had much respect for Jung , far more than used to be described officially.Freud was interested officially in the Unconscious , and in the influences that the sex life has on the Unconscious , while Jung was interested in the Subconscious.And so it is natural that they shared , and did not that much oppose , their interests.Psychiatry is still used today to oppose shamans , witches , artists , writers , you name it - and that is why so many psychiatrists today , most of them being State funded , think they're witch - finders and that their froth mouthing hocus pocus is all about continuing the Inquisition while they officially deny it.They want people to think they're being Scientific , and they will go to any length , including people who had no interest in promoting the Inquisition , to keep their patients and the followers of their hopeless , half - brained Fringe Cult in line.If that means using Freud's name to promote a materialistic explanation for the origins of the psyche , they'll go for it.I repeat; Psychiatry's business is first and foremost , to promote the continuance of Monotheism in the worst possible form , and of State worship , in it's worst possible form.The worse , the better but the better only if those Psychiatrists cash in on it.It's all about the money - not about promoting Scientific Research , which Psychiatry still heavily opposes.Freud's own position towards Psychiatry was , that , Psychiatry can be used for scientific purposes , but for that to work , it'd have to be much less centralized.He wasn't listened to , to the detriment of Psychiatry itself , and thus not Psychoanalysis.While Psychoanalysis kept evolving and blossoming to the point of going beyound simple , materialistic explanations for things , Psychiatry itself nonetheless developed some interesting , sometimes useful methods which could help some patients to recover from past trauma , but nowhere near as useful as those of Psychoanalysis.Jung's talking cure would work for some , while not for others , and Freud was immensely interested in it.I feel that as a Monotheistic Religion , Psychiatry has been used to create Scizophrenia as an alternative to the equally mythical Melancholia , and oppose the interests of Science , including Mainstream Science , and thus not benefit it.I recommend excellent documentaries such as The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtis for people who are new to Freudian and Jungian

While she is neurotic her intellect still reasons. In an early scene Sabina is in a pond as the men in white coats try to persuade her out.The clinic director approaches her and says ""You clearly have too much time on your hands. We must find something for you to do. What are your interests?""Sabina, ""Suicide and interplanetary travel.""  In this simple scene we can grasp her intellect and her issues.Jung allows Sabina, (who wants to be a doctor) to act as his assistant, a task she does a little too well as demonstrated with her diagnosis of patients using word associtaion. Sabina has been abused by her father. Now it gets weird. He would slap her, then make her kiss his hand afterwards. He would also spank her bare bottom, something Keira confesses caused arousal, even at an early age. She would do things which would cause her to be spanked.In one scene Sabina is on a moving river boat talking to Dr. Jung, however the scenery behind her never changes. It looks as it the background is superimposed. The background also appears fake when you see the statue of liberty.Carl Jung decides to consult some guy named Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) about this case. Mortensen plays Freud somewhat stiff, for a guy who relates everything to sex.  When cocaine snorting, womanizer patient (Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross) shows up at the clinic, his unethical ways cause Jung to question his life and his relationship with Knightly who now desires sex and a good spanking.Freud is always pictured with a cigar in his hand or mouth(sometimes a cigar is just a cigar), but his other idiosyncrasies are not captured. Note the German custom of wearing the wedding ring on the right hand. He is involved in a lot of dialouge scenes about sex, repression, ego, and dream interpretation. What should be a five star movie from the cast, lacks action in the script and good drama in the dialouge, but does have an historical interest.

1518961,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B006PTL1GC,Turfseer,"[3, 4]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'A Dangerous Method' is advertised as a film mainly dramatizing the conflict between iconic therapists Carl Jung and his one-time mentor, Sigmund Freud. But the bulk of the film is really about an affair that Jung had with one of his patients, Sabina Spielrein, who later went on to become a prominent Russian physician and psychoanalyst.The film begins in 1904 with Spielrein, a young medical student, checking into a psychiatric clinic with severe symptoms of what was termed 'hysteria' in those days. She primarily displays a complex motor tic of continuously thrusting her jaw out and stuttering and often must be restrained by the staff at the clinic. Carl Jung, a student of Sigmund Freud, employs Freud's new 'talking therapy' with Spielrein, who makes remarkable progress and is soon offered a job by Jung, to assist him in his medical research (Spielrein's transformation from borderline psychotic to responsible student is too abrupt as we never see how Jung actually works his miracle--Jung returns from military leave and we must take it on faith that somehow, through the passage of time, his therapy simply worked!)Jung is married to a wealthy woman who he has a number of children with. During the course of his relationship with Spielrein, he treats a disaffected physician, Otto Gross, who urges him to abandon his monogamous ways and pursue his sexual desires with Sabina. It is the contention of the film's scenarists that Jung indeed began an affair with Spielrein; her illness was related to being physically punished by her father in childhood and she now sublimates these negative experiences by engaging in masochistic spanking and bondage sessions with Jung (coupled with normal sexual encounters).Meanwhile, Jung corresponds with Freud and meets with him a number of times, including a trip to America. Freud is depicted as a rigid theoretician and practitioner, inflexibly adhering to his core belief that mental illness is rooted only in childhood sexual experiences. Jung eventually seeks to incorporate other theories to explain psychological dysfunction which Freud derides, and ultimately rejects, as 'mysticism'.The dissolution of Jung and Freud's relationship is tied to Jung's dissolving relationship with Spielrein. He not only publishes studies about his treatment of her but her dissertation as well. They both agree that acts of creation can be rooted in destruction (holding up their own relationship as a perfect example: a clash of opposites and breaking of taboos), not necessarily related to Freud's one note obsession with childhood sexuality. Although Spielrein is essentially on Jung's side, she decides to undergo analysis with Freud who she hopes might play mediator between the warring couple, after Jung (due to guilt feelings) breaks things off between them. While Spielrein takes the high road by not exposing Jung, she insists he confess his indiscretions to Freud. After agreeing to Spielrein's request, Freud uses Jung's confession against him, bashing Jung in future correspondence, after his former pupil fails to pay homage to him. After they split, both Freud and Jung then fail to acknowledge Speilrein's contributions. She finally gets over Jung, becomes a notable analyst in her own right and has children with a kindly physician from her native Russia.The resolution of both of these plot strands (Jung and Freud and Jung and Spielrein), will prove of great interest to aficionados of the great psychotherapeutic icons, but to the general public, perhaps much more anti-climactic. If we are to believe the scenarists here, Jung went way beyond his mentor Freud, in terms of presenting much broader, holistic, psychological constructs. Much of this we learn in the closing titles at film's end but I'm not convinced that Jung is the better of the two.To their credit, Freud is depicted as a minority practitioner, beleaguered on many sides, due to his unpopular emphasis on sexuality. He argued that Jung's belief in 'superstition' undermined the 'scientific' basis of their profession. Ultimately, a one hour and forty five minute film, can only touch upon the basic conflicting points between the two men. For a deeper understanding between Freud and Jung, a real solution is to read through their writings. Creative luminaries such as Joyce Joyce, however, did not care to--he dubbed them both ""Tweedledum and Tweedledee"" (perhaps if both of them had written a novel as good as 'Ulysses', they may have earned Joyce's approbation).Michael Fassbender as Jung is perhaps the strongest of the three principals. He displays a subdued intensity throughout the film. Many internet posters found Keira Knightley as Spielrein to be way over the top, particularly in the early scenes where she is depicted as being completely unhinged. I didn't think she was that bad at all and is perhaps the strongest when she makes her case for Jung, while meeting up with Freud. Viggo Mortensen comes off as a bit boring as Freud but is perhaps saddled by the rather ponderous, dialogue heavy script.'A Dangerous Method' will keep your interest up to a point. Ultimately, however, Freud and Jung's work may not be worth immortalizing in any film at all. There is a deeper and darker tale here, far more ominous and important than the conflict between seemingly self-involved intellectuals. I'm referring to the fate of Sabina Spielrein, revealed in the closing credits. She was murdered along with her two children by Einsatzgruppe D, one of the Nazi death squads, near her home town in Russia, in August of 1942. The machinations of Freud and Jung seem like a distant memory in light of the evil which inexorably began its march over the European continent some 100 years ago, almost to this day.",3,"True

Unless you're deep into Jung and Freud and enjoy scene upon scene of deep discussions about your repressed sexuality, this movie isn't for you.  Kiera Knightley's performance of a disturbed woman who from childhood gets off sexually from physical abuse, is over the top.  As some reviewers pointed out, she painfully overplays the part trying to look quite mad, which only brings you to the brink of madness watching her physical contortions.  The remainder of the movie deserves deep attention to understand the musings of the two psychiatry giants of the past.  The timeline jumps from one thing to the other a bit disjointed and actually in parts makes no sense whatsoever, such as Freud having what appeared to be a stroke, and then in the next scene is perfectly fine.  Also, if you're offended by brutal belt beatings of Kiera's behind while being tied to the bed, and Jung getting off sexually by playing into her odd sexual needs she now has freedom to express at her doctor's hand, I suggest you skip the movie.",2,Not for the Easily Bored or Sexually Shocked,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,1150,"['was', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'watching', 'previews', 'time', 'ago', 'however', 'was', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'overall', ""'re"", 'deep', 'Jung', 'Freud', 'enjoy', 'scene', 'scene', 'deep', 'discussions', 'repressed', 'sexuality', 'movie', ""n't"", 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'performance', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'who', 'childhood', 'off', 'sexually', 'physical', 'abuse', 'top', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'painfully', 'part', 'trying', 'look', 'quite', 'mad', 'only', 'brink', 'madness', 'watching', 'physical', 'contortions', 'remainder', 'movie', 'deep', 'attention', 'understand', 'musings', 'two', 'psychiatry', 'giants', 'past', 'timeline', 'jumps', 'one', 'thing', 'other', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'actually', 'parts', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'such', 'Freud', 'having', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'stroke', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'Also', ""'re"", 'offended', 'brutal', 'belt', 'beatings', 'Kiera', 'behind', 'being', 'tied', 'bed', 'Jung', 'getting', 'off', 'sexually', 'playing', 'odd', 'sexual', 'now', 'freedom', 'express', 'doctor', 'hand', 'suggest', 'skip', 'movie']",N/A

A patient who is a borderline psychotic (not neurotic as is her diagnosis in the film), is hardly a dramatic revelation.  Nor is it eye opening for a doctor to have a sexual relationship with his patient, even in turn of the century Vienna or Switzerland.  The director has Keira Knightley over play the psychotic patient role to the point of being stereotypical and a distraction. You almost want to say ""enough, already!  Nor does the director have her (in the end of the film) seem ""cured"" as she states.  She always displays a nervous tick, even in her final scene with Jung.As psychoanalytical history, the break between Freud and Jung came when Jung switched from the individual patient, to the whole of humanity as the patient, and saw ""archetypes"".  Today, Jung is a footnote in the history of psychoanalysis, and Jungian therapists are rapidly diminishing.  Freud's approach is still the most favored of those who do ""talk therapy"".And those damn cigars gave Freud cancer of the jaw, forcing its removal.

1518968,AZ39SOZT3NZQU,B006PTL1GC,XraySpex,"[2, 37]","This movie is just another example of how ancient superstition poisons people to perpetuate the psychoanalysis scam.  Freud and Jung are charlatans.  The book, The Reluctant Alliance Between Behaviorism And Humanism shows how science overcomes the superstition of psychoanalyst's and documents effective methodology, but this movie ignores the truth and continues to perpetuate this ignorant behavior.  Sad.  Psychoanalysts use the ancient superstition that you have a magical, self initiating force in your brain called a soul/will that gives you free willy. This assumption allows psychos (psychoanalysts), that never solve a problem, to blame you for your behavior. The best way to control anyone is too make them think they have a little man inside their heads to control their behavior. You have a problem it is up to you, take some personal responsibility. Never works.  Solving unhealthy behavior involves re-arranging the contingencies of reinforcement to reinforce healthy behavior, but that would take too much time, too many resources, and continuous adaption. Too difficult. It is much easier to tell people it is up to them AND have people feel good about being able to talk about things they cannot say to others in this culture AND repeating cultural clich&eacute;'s articulately, ad infinitum. Easy, but wrong.  Psychoanalysis is a cruel tool that never works and this movie continues to foster this dangerous method.  It is much easier to tell others to take responsibility and never take any responsibility of their own to shape healthy behavior. No problem ever gets solved, but the psychos get paid a ton to listen to you get to talk of subjects that are taboo in this culture and feel much better for an hour. You have to want change. How great. A way of doing nothing and not observing that circumstances make us want things and rearranging contingencies determines wanting what is healthy or unhealthy, but they ignore the facts.  They don't have to do a thing, they put all their lies/superstitions on you. You get to feel like you are solving problems, but actually you just schedule endless appointments and the vicious cycle never ends. Everybody wins. Viva La Psycho!
