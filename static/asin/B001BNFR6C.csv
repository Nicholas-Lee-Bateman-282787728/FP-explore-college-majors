My list of bad attributes could go on forever so ill try to make it quick.The acting was laughably bad, not one person, attempting to portray a character, was close to being believable.Also... had the budget been any less for this terrible flick, it would have looked like it was filmed with a child's toy camera.Lastly, the plot was so confusing and choppy, it could'nt be salvaged by the best of Hollywood's directors. The first hour and 20 min into the film were intolerably boring and the last ten minutes were lacking any special effects. As Mary's ghost attacks 4 characters she is invisible to the human eye so there they are throwing themselves about ridiculously.I cant believe I watched this all the way through.",1,Hot Tranny Mess!!!,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,770,"['have', 'not', 'one', 'pleasant', 'say', 'film', 'list', 'bad', 'attributes', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'so', 'ill', 'try', 'make', 'quick.The', 'acting', 'was', 'laughably', 'bad', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'attempting', 'portray', 'character', 'was', 'close', 'being', 'believable.Also', 'had', 'budget', 'been', 'less', 'terrible', 'flick', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'was', 'filmed', 'child', 'toy', 'camera.Lastly', 'plot', 'was', 'so', 'confusing', 'choppy', ""could'nt"", 'be', 'salvaged', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'first', 'hour', '20', 'min', 'film', 'were', 'intolerably', 'boring', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'were', 'lacking', 'special', 'effects', 'Mary', 'ghost', '4', 'characters', 'invisible', 'human', 'eye', 'so', 'there', 'are', 'throwing', 'ridiculously.I', 'cant', 'believe', 'watched', 'way']","Legend Of Bloody Mary, The"

1172733,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001BNFR6C,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 8]","Who doesn't know the legend of Bloody Mary?  You know, say her name in front of a mirror three times and she will appear (and, quite likely, either kill you or snatch you into her world).  It's so ingrained into our culture that I for one would not tempt fate by performing the ritual myself.  Unless you've lived your entire life under a rock, the basic premise of this film will be quite familiar to you.  This is, rightly or wrongly, a handicap this film must try to overcome.  It's hard not to feel as if the last thing we need is yet another Bloody Mary film rehashing old folklore and cinematic haunts.  Fortunately, The Legend of Blood Mary comes at the legend from a slightly different angle.  Unfortunately, questionable acting and some really annoying directing do much to hamper one's enjoyment of the film.In this version of the game, you first mark yourself and/or others (by writing names on the mirror) before calling Bloody Mary to come out and play.  That's what the Bloody Mary game website says to do, anyway.  The site also provides some background on Bloody Mary herself.  Having refused to divulge the name of her unborn child's father, poor Mary Worth paid the ultimate price at the hands of her Puritan, Salem-like community, with her own personal Arthur Dimmesdale supplying the crudest cut of all.  Who can blame her for wanting revenge?Ryan (Paul Preiss) is one of Mary's indirect victims - although it's hard to feel too sorry for a young man this boring and annoying.  Eight years ago, his sister Amy (Rachel Taylor) played the game, and he's been plagued with nightmares ever since her disappearance.  His girlfriend Rachel (Irina Costa) asks Ryan's former professor Father O'Neal (Robert J. Locke, obviously a graduate of the Hayden Christensen School of Acting), an untraditional priest and archaeologist, for help.  Through his personal investigation, we learn what happened to Amy and her friends.  And wouldn't you know it?  A new archaeological dig right there on campus brings the story of Bloody Mary full circle.Ryan is too aloof and self-absorbed to be likeable, but Father O'Neal is a bigger problem, in my opinion.  You can never lose yourself in the story because Robert J. Locke is never able to bring his character to life.  It's not that he's a terrible actor, it's just that his manner never changes, no matter how odd the situation.  Some aspects of the truths he discovers should prove a little problematic for a priest, but I don't think his expression would have changed if someone dropped a cement block on his foot.  I also have to call director John Stecenko out for artsy-fartsy shenanigans.  If you want to shoot characters from weird angles, that's okay, but this guy goes way overboard with the close-ups.  I don't want to look at Locke's beard when he's speaking, and I certainly don't want to see shifting close-ups of that beard as his monologue rambles on.  Overall, this is your better-than-average Bloody Mary film, but it's not nearly as good as it could or should have been - and the damages responsible for that are self-inflicted.",3,"Mirror, mirror, on the wall",1220659200,"09 6, 2008",2008,3098,"['Who', ""n't"", 'know', 'legend', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'know', 'say', 'name', 'front', 'mirror', 'three', 'times', 'will', 'appear', 'quite', 'likely', 'either', 'kill', 'snatch', 'world', 'so', 'ingrained', 'culture', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'tempt', 'fate', 'performing', 'ritual', 'myself', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'entire', 'life', 'rock', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'quite', 'familiar', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'handicap', 'film', 'must', 'try', 'overcome', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'yet', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'film', 'rehashing', 'old', 'folklore', 'cinematic', 'haunts', 'Fortunately', 'Legend', 'Blood', 'Mary', 'legend', 'slightly', 'different', 'angle', 'Unfortunately', 'questionable', 'acting', 'really', 'annoying', 'directing', 'do', 'much', 'hamper', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'film.In', 'version', 'game', 'first', 'mark', 'and/or', 'others', 'writing', 'names', 'mirror', 'calling', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'come', 'out', 'play', 'what', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'game', 'website', 'do', 'anyway', 'site', 'also', 'background', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'Having', 'refused', 'divulge', 'name', 'unborn', 'child', 'father', 'poor', 'Mary', 'Worth', 'paid', 'ultimate', 'price', 'hands', 'Puritan', 'Salem-like', 'community', 'own', 'personal', 'Arthur', 'Dimmesdale', 'supplying', 'crudest', 'cut', 'Who', 'can', 'blame', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'Ryan', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'one', 'Mary', 'indirect', 'victims', 'hard', 'feel', 'too', 'sorry', 'young', 'man', 'boring', 'annoying', 'Eight', 'years', 'ago', 'sister', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'Taylor', 'played', 'game', 'been', 'plagued', 'nightmares', 'ever', 'disappearance', 'girlfriend', 'Rachel', 'Irina', 'Costa', 'Ryan', 'former', 'professor', 'Father', ""O'Neal"", 'Robert', 'J.', 'Locke', 'obviously', 'graduate', 'Hayden', 'Christensen', 'School', 'Acting', 'untraditional', 'priest', 'archaeologist', 'help', 'personal', 'investigation', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'Amy', 'friends', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'new', 'archaeological', 'dig', 'right', 'there', 'campus', 'story', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'full', 'circle.Ryan', 'too', 'aloof', 'self-absorbed', 'be', 'likeable', 'Father', ""O'Neal"", 'bigger', 'problem', 'opinion', 'can', 'never', 'lose', 'story', 'Robert', 'J.', 'Locke', 'never', 'able', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'not', 'terrible', 'actor', 'just', 'manner', 'never', 'changes', 'matter', 'how', 'situation', 'aspects', 'truths', 'should', 'prove', 'little', 'problematic', 'priest', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'expression', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'someone', 'dropped', 'cement', 'block', 'foot', 'also', 'have', 'call', 'director', 'John', 'Stecenko', 'out', 'artsy-fartsy', 'shenanigans', 'want', 'shoot', 'characters', 'weird', 'angles', 'okay', 'guy', 'way', 'close-ups', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'look', 'Locke', 'beard', 'when', 'speaking', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'shifting', 'close-ups', 'beard', 'monologue', 'rambles', 'Overall', 'better-than-average', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'damages', 'responsible', 'are', 'self-inflicted']","Legend Of Bloody Mary, The"

The same recurring nightmares that have corrupted his sleep ever since his sister turned up missing several years ago. Nightmares similar to his sister's experiences prior to her disappearance after playing ""Bloody Mary"" at the bathroom window in their childhood home. Nightmares that may or may not have to do with the recent unearthing of a person's bones buried underneath the local church, with the remains dating back to the late 17th century. Hmmm, around the same time Mary Worth was deemed a witch for carrying Satan's child in her womb and dealt with the nightmare of slow execution. Dare I use the word ""nightmare(s)"" in every sentence of this review? Do you dare to guess the one word that could best describe what I think of the film? Well...close, but no.

1172737,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B001BNFR6C,Tim Janson,"[6, 8]","The Legend of Bloody Mary centers on the often-told urban myth about the spirit who will haunt/kill the person who repeats her name three times in front of a mirror.  It employs folklore surrounding Mary Worth or Mary Worthington, depending upon which version you hear.  In this case, it casts Mary as an accused witch during Puritan times.  Refusing to name the man responsible for getting her pregnant, Mary is accused of heresy and sentenced to death.  Tied to a tree, a large mirror is placed before her so she can watch herself die as the towns people take turns cutting her with a knife.  Mary curses the people with her dying breath.  If you're guessing that the film isn't big on historical accuracy you win a prize.In the present, Ryan (Paul Preiss) is suffering from bad dreams ever since the night his sister Amy, and several of her friends disappeared seven years earlier.  The girls were planning a big party and looking for a game to scare their guests.  Searching the Internet they came across the Bloody Mary game.  Ryan's girlfriend suggests he talk with a priest friend about his dreams.  Father O' Neal is about the lamest looking priest ever seen on film.  Wearing a cowboy hat and jeans, he looks more like a country singer than a clergyman.  Conveniently, a construction crew turns up the very mirror used in Mary's execution on the grounds of his church.The plot is a confused mess.  Over half the film takes place in flashback sequences to either Mary's trial in the 1600s or Amy's disappearance seven years ago.  This allows no flow at all to the story.  There also is no explanation as to why Bloody Mary is after Ryan now, these many years later.  The performances are uniformly poor.  The lines are delivered without a hint of emotion or expression.  The only notable cast member is veteran character actor Stephen Macht playing the 1600s judge who sentences Mary Worth to death.To top things off, you barely even get a peep at Bloody Mary.  She can only be seen in mirrors so when she is attacking her victims, you see them battling an invisible foe, dragged across the floor by an unseen source. You catch only fleeting glimpses of Mary as they pass a mirror.  You don't even see her face until the final few seconds of the film when they do the old, ""You thought the monster was dead but really isn't"" trick.  It might be just as well though...it seems as though the make-up and visual effects people basically copied the ghost's look from ""The Ring"" to use for Mary:  long dark hair, tattered dress, decomposed skin.  The film also borrows plot elements from ""Darkness Falls"", another bad horror film but far better than this one.The disc does come with a number of extras...if you should really be interested.  These include a director's commentary, alternate opening and endings, three featurettes and testimonials.  The testimonials are actually kind of fun.  These are interviews with high school kids about the Bloody Mary legend and their experiences in playing the game.",1,Confusing Mess of a Film,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,3009,"['Legend', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'centers', 'often-told', 'urban', 'myth', 'spirit', 'who', 'will', 'haunt/kill', 'person', 'who', 'name', 'three', 'times', 'front', 'mirror', 'folklore', 'surrounding', 'Mary', 'Worth', 'Mary', 'Worthington', 'depending', 'version', 'hear', 'case', 'Mary', 'accused', 'witch', 'Puritan', 'times', 'Refusing', 'name', 'man', 'responsible', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'Mary', 'accused', 'heresy', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Tied', 'tree', 'large', 'mirror', 'placed', 'can', 'watch', 'die', 'towns', 'people', 'take', 'turns', 'cutting', 'knife', 'Mary', 'people', 'dying', 'breath', ""'re"", 'guessing', 'film', ""n't"", 'big', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'win', 'prize.In', 'present', 'Ryan', 'Paul', 'Preiss', 'suffering', 'bad', 'dreams', 'ever', 'night', 'sister', 'Amy', 'several', 'friends', 'disappeared', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'girls', 'were', 'planning', 'big', 'party', 'looking', 'game', 'scare', 'guests', 'Searching', 'Internet', 'came', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'game', 'Ryan', 'girlfriend', 'talk', 'priest', 'friend', 'dreams', 'Father', 'O', 'Neal', 'lamest', 'looking', 'priest', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Wearing', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'jeans', 'more', 'country', 'singer', 'clergyman', 'Conveniently', 'construction', 'crew', 'up', 'very', 'mirror', 'used', 'Mary', 'execution', 'grounds', 'church.The', 'plot', 'confused', 'mess', 'film', 'place', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Mary', 'trial', '1600s', 'Amy', 'disappearance', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'flow', 'story', 'also', 'explanation', 'why', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'Ryan', 'now', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'poor', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'hint', 'emotion', 'expression', 'only', 'notable', 'cast', 'member', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Macht', 'playing', '1600s', 'judge', 'who', 'Mary', 'Worth', 'death.To', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'barely', 'even', 'get', 'peep', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'mirrors', 'so', 'when', 'attacking', 'victims', 'see', 'battling', 'invisible', 'foe', 'dragged', 'floor', 'unseen', 'source', 'catch', 'only', 'fleeting', 'glimpses', 'Mary', 'pass', 'mirror', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'face', 'final', 'few', 'seconds', 'film', 'when', 'do', 'old', 'thought', 'monster', 'was', 'dead', 'really', ""n't"", 'trick', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'make-up', 'visual', 'effects', 'people', 'basically', 'copied', 'ghost', 'look', 'Ring', 'use', 'Mary', 'long', 'dark', 'hair', 'tattered', 'dress', 'decomposed', 'skin', 'film', 'also', 'plot', 'elements', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'one.The', 'disc', 'come', 'number', 'extras', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'interested', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'opening', 'endings', 'three', 'featurettes', 'testimonials', 'testimonials', 'are', 'actually', 'kind', 'fun', 'are', 'interviews', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'Bloody', 'Mary', 'legend', 'experiences', 'playing', 'game']","Legend Of Bloody Mary, The"
