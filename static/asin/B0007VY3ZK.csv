I enjoyed watching about the presidents we all know about and learning about ones we rarely hear about like Buchanan, Arthur, Polk among others. My only complaints were the opinion of James Madison and War of 1812 deserved a lot more credit. It was the only war in which our country was invaded by another. James Madison is the only president during a time when our capital was sacked. I would of liked to of seen more about his presdency and how he managed to keep the country and politicans together after such an event.My second problem was why during Wilson's term they didn't mention the women picketing right in front of the White House day in and day out.",3,Well written only two problems,1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,758,"['thought', 'History', 'Channel', 'document', 'Presidents', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'good', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'presidents', 'know', 'learning', 'ones', 'rarely', 'hear', 'Buchanan', 'Arthur', 'Polk', 'others', 'only', 'complaints', 'were', 'opinion', 'James', 'Madison', 'War', '1812', 'deserved', 'lot', 'more', 'credit', 'was', 'only', 'war', 'country', 'was', 'invaded', 'James', 'Madison', 'only', 'president', 'time', 'when', 'capital', 'was', 'sacked', 'would', 'liked', 'seen', 'more', 'presdency', 'how', 'managed', 'keep', 'country', 'politicans', 'together', 'such', 'event.My', 'second', 'problem', 'was', 'why', 'Wilson', 'term', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'women', 'picketing', 'right', 'front', 'White', 'House', 'day', 'day', 'out']",The History Channel Presents The Presidents

I liked it so much that I wanted to make sure I had my own copy to use forever! The videos are great - very kid-friendly without being corny. Each video is short (I want to say no more than 10 mins. each), colorful, with lots of pictures, with music, and has an interesting narrator. I also like that they include little known trivia facts about each president. It is easy to create questions for students to answer just by listening to the video and I would recommend it for low level up to average level students as an assignment or with upper level students as an introduction to a unit or president.

The intended audience is clearly the general viewer, many of whom will have forgotten some of the more obscure presidents.  The narration is short, punchy, and tone-neutral.  For presidents who served before the era of widely-available television, video dating as far back as the terms of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, turns these men from statues into real, breathing, moving human beings in context.This DVD series is highly recommended as an introduction to the history of our presidents, suitable for a wide variety of interested viewers.",4,"The Presidents, in brief....",1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,995,"['2003', 'History', 'Channel', 'Presidents', 'nicely', 'done', 'survey', 'first', '43', 'presidents', 'President', 'concise', 'description', 'time', 'office', 'buttressed', 'short', 'commentary', 'various', 'historians', 'few', 'prominent', 'personalties', 'segements', 'include', 'paintings', 'pictures', 'photography', 'get', 'closer', 'present', 'motion', 'pictures', 'man.No', 'great', 'historical', 'depth', 'promised', 'delivered', 'here', 'intended', 'audience', 'clearly', 'general', 'viewer', 'many', 'whom', 'will', 'have', 'forgotten', 'more', 'obscure', 'presidents', 'narration', 'short', 'punchy', 'tone-neutral', 'presidents', 'who', 'served', 'era', 'widely-available', 'television', 'video', 'dating', 'far', 'back', 'terms', 'William', 'McKinley', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'men', 'statues', 'real', 'breathing', 'moving', 'human', 'beings', 'context.This', 'DVD', 'series', 'highly', 'recommended', 'introduction', 'history', 'presidents', 'suitable', 'wide', 'variety', 'interested', 'viewers']",The History Channel Presents The Presidents

One of my favorites was an actress who sat beside President Calvin Coolidge at a dinner. She turned to him and said, ""I bet I can make you say more than two words during dinner.""

891847,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B0007VY3ZK,Joker,"[1, 1]","The Presidents (2005) is a fascinating program put together by the History Channel.  Excellent mini-bios on all the presidents are presented.  If you don't own The Complete Book Of U.S. Presidents, any U.S. history books, or you don't know much about the presidents, you'll learn by watching this.  Myself, I've been able to name the presidents in order and the years they served since I was probably 8 or 9 years old.  Learning the biographical information and many details about their presidencies came in later years through reading, taking history courses, and watching this program, which does an excellent job of summing up in a short amount of time each president, their administration, and the events happening at the time they were president.

To be fair, it's possible they were simply trying to avoid the series being 85 hours ;-) There are many facts here, and just as much coverage of what a given expert thinks and feels.

The same man was the main expert in judging George W Bush - he clearly hates him. It makes me wonder what else this documentary has glossed over and slanted. Maybe, maybe not, but when sold as history, I want history not personal opinions and theories.To be fair I should note I'm Conservative and am probably equally slanted the other way.

891855,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,B0007VY3ZK,Roger J. Buffington,"[14, 20]","This presentation of The Presidents is pretty good until about the post-Eisenhower era.  After that the modern day bias of the press kicks in.  This is unfortunate, because most of this series is terrific, and gives a pretty evenhanded summary of the presidencies of most of the presidents.  By doing so this series gives the viewer a wonderful look at American history and the place each of the presidents occupies within it.Lyndon Johnson gets a very sympathetic hearing from this series despite the fact that he is responsible for the Vietnam disaster.  The bias really begins with Richard Nixon, who is virtually caricatured.  The press hated Nixon's guts, and this comes through very clearly in the treatment that ""The Presidents"" dishes out to him. (I am no big Nixon fan, but this series wrongly states that he escalated the Vietnam War when in reality he promptly began drawing down US troop levels in Vietnam, notwithstanding his attacks on Communist sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia.) Jimmie Carter's failed presidency mostly gets a pass for its disastrous failures on both the domestic and international fronts. The series makes no mention of the crazed levels of inflation and interest rates that occurred on Carter's watch.  His feckless foreign policy is portrayed through rose colored glasses--Carter himself informs the viewer that Carter learned how ""to work well with others."" Watching this series, one would conclude that Carter was a successful president, rather than the one-term failure that he actually was. (To this series' credit, it does a fair job analyzing Gerald Ford's presidency.) Ronald Reagan is introduced as ""a former movie actor"" rather than as, for example, the former two-term governor of California.  Nothing is said of the speed that Reagan's countermanding of Carter's policies had in reviving the American economy and position abroad.  Instead, Reagan is portrayed as not very bright, and ""out of the loop.""  His economic and tax cutting policies ""simply caused deficits.""  Bias can go little further.  Put simply, this series' portrayal of Ronald Reagan's presidency is unacceptably biased, and a good example of why the American people no longer place any trust in journalists or the press.  George HW Bush is portrayed as having been ""wise"" to break his promise on making tax cuts, and the series (without rebuttal by anyone) intones that the Bush and Clinton tax increases (""which were probably a good idea..."") helped fuel the boom of the 90s!  I suppose it was too much to hope that modern-day journalists could avoid the big government, pro-high tax bias that so permeates the modern-day press.  An objective look at our recent presidents will no doubt have to wait until America has a more unbiased press interested in reporting the news, rather than pushing a single leftward political bias.But enjoy!

Carter is given the respect - Reagan should get - yet Reagan is treated like a president who failed, when Carter's administration was failure from start to finish.
