1659590,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00DNF1RM4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 4]","As he ages and gets more seasoned Andrew McCarthy sheds more and more of the yuppie smug once associated with his onscreen persona. In COME DANCE WITH ME, Jack Pressman (McCarthy) comes off as a regular guy even if he's a hotshot New York exec in a financial brokerage firm. Jack's a Kansas kid made good. He's got his ducks in a row. He's in a shallow three-month relationship with the boss's high maintainance daughter (Stephanie Mills). He's finalizing a humongous account for the firm. He's in line for a massive promotion. And leaving no stone unturned, he's taking dance lessons to impress his boss during the firm's annual Christmas party. Set in an elegant ballroom, guests are expected to waltz and foxtrot and quickstep and all that classy, old timey stuff. There may even be some Latin dances sprinkled in. The big bash is less than three weeks away, so Jack's got some work to do.See, what had happened was, one evening he glanced up and saw a sign for Waltzing On Air, a modest dance studio. On impulse he negotiates the stairs and signs up for tutelage from lovely instructor Christine Gates (Michelle Nolden). Christine is the brutally honest sort. Having seen his best foot forward and heard him boast of his tennis prowess, she zings him, ""Did you play tennis with someone strapped to the front of your body?"" What else could Jack do but fall into infatuation with the outspoken dame? And, by the way, it's cute that the establishment below is named ""The Framing Gallery."" It becomes the backdrop to when Christine and Jack have an impromptu box step out in the street one evening.Michelle Nolden's Christine is distant and businesslike. It's only in her private moments that she demonstrates a winning vulnerability, and I appreciate that Nolden keeps that dialed down, that she doesn't overdo it. Her character is strong and independent, never mind that her studio is barely turning a profit, never mind that she loves it dearly, the studio having been founded by her parents, never mind that Waltzing on Air is on the verge of extinction and Christine is slated for eviction on Christmas eve (how's that for heartless?).Christine fights back, of course, she's got that gumption. But it's a losing cause. Her neighborhood has been targeted for extensive renovation by a deep pockets real estate development agency. When Christine learns that her new student, Jack Pressman, is a corporate financier, she relies on his advice and support. She's in the dark that Jack's brokerage firm is the one handling the account that's shutting down her studio and that Jack himself is the point man of that deal. And Jack's not about to tell her, smitten as he is at this stage. When Christine calls his office for a formal tte-&agrave;-tte, Jack wimps out and, in perhaps the funniest moment in the movie, assumes a wobbly British accent.Another highlight for me is Jack's down-to-earth relationship with his mom (Mary Long?). She's kinda awesome. She makes Andrew McCarthy wear an awful goofy Christmas sweater. That scene alone is worth the price of admission.Obvious similarities to SHALL WE DANCE? abound, although COME DANCE WITH ME separates enough to form its own identity. It's unexpectedly a lovely little romance. It helps that the actors keep it restrained. I love the interplay between McCarthy and Nolden, whether in conversational form or in rhythmic motion. McCarthy exhibits grace on the dance floor, but Nolden's the one who floats and glides like she's poetry on legs. Man, I appreciate great posture on women. Again, note Nolden's blend of strength and fragility, these traits translated as well to dance. And don't be surprised if you pick up helpful ballroom dancing tips, such as you're not supposed to look at your feet, yo. After watching some minutes of Christine and Jack practicing it, I had that box step down pat. That's either because I am tremendously awesome or because Christine is an impeccable instructor. In a season traditionally presided by unabashed sentiment, how do you think this movie ends? Does Jack choose naked ambition and a boost up that corporate ladder or love and the box step?",4,Andrew McCarthy fills out your dance card,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,4135,"['more', 'seasoned', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'more', 'more', 'yuppie', 'smug', 'once', 'associated', 'onscreen', 'persona', 'COME', 'DANCE', 'WITH', 'ME', 'Jack', 'Pressman', 'McCarthy', 'off', 'regular', 'guy', 'even', 'hotshot', 'New', 'York', 'exec', 'financial', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'Jack', 'Kansas', 'kid', 'made', 'good', 'got', 'ducks', 'row', 'shallow', 'three-month', 'relationship', 'boss', 'high', 'maintainance', 'daughter', 'Stephanie', 'Mills', 'finalizing', 'humongous', 'account', 'firm', 'line', 'massive', 'promotion', 'leaving', 'stone', 'unturned', 'taking', 'dance', 'lessons', 'impress', 'boss', 'firm', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Set', 'elegant', 'ballroom', 'guests', 'are', 'expected', 'waltz', 'foxtrot', 'quickstep', 'classy', 'old', 'timey', 'stuff', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'Latin', 'dances', 'sprinkled', 'big', 'bash', 'less', 'three', 'weeks', 'away', 'Jack', 'got', 'work', 'do.See', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'was', 'one', 'evening', 'glanced', 'up', 'saw', 'sign', 'Waltzing', 'Air', 'modest', 'dance', 'studio', 'impulse', 'stairs', 'signs', 'up', 'tutelage', 'lovely', 'instructor', 'Christine', 'Gates', 'Michelle', 'Nolden', 'Christine', 'brutally', 'honest', 'sort', 'Having', 'seen', 'best', 'foot', 'forward', 'heard', 'boast', 'tennis', 'prowess', 'Did', 'play', 'tennis', 'someone', 'strapped', 'front', 'body', 'What', 'else', 'could', 'Jack', 'do', 'fall', 'infatuation', 'outspoken', 'dame', 'way', 'cute', 'establishment', 'below', 'named', 'Framing', 'Gallery', 'backdrop', 'when', 'Christine', 'Jack', 'have', 'impromptu', 'box', 'step', 'out', 'street', 'one', 'Nolden', 'Christine', 'distant', 'businesslike', 'only', 'private', 'moments', 'winning', 'vulnerability', 'appreciate', 'Nolden', 'dialed', 'down', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'character', 'strong', 'independent', 'never', 'mind', 'studio', 'barely', 'turning', 'profit', 'never', 'mind', 'dearly', 'studio', 'having', 'been', 'founded', 'parents', 'never', 'mind', 'Waltzing', 'Air', 'verge', 'extinction', 'Christine', 'slated', 'eviction', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'how', 'heartless', '.Christine', 'fights', 'back', 'course', 'got', 'gumption', 'losing', 'cause', 'neighborhood', 'been', 'targeted', 'extensive', 'renovation', 'deep', 'pockets', 'real', 'estate', 'development', 'agency', 'When', 'Christine', 'new', 'student', 'Jack', 'Pressman', 'corporate', 'financier', 'advice', 'support', 'dark', 'Jack', 'brokerage', 'firm', 'one', 'handling', 'account', 'shutting', 'down', 'studio', 'Jack', 'point', 'man', 'deal', 'Jack', 'not', 'tell', 'smitten', 'stage', 'When', 'Christine', 'office', 'formal', 'tte-', 'agrave', '-tte', 'Jack', 'out', 'perhaps', 'funniest', 'moment', 'movie', 'wobbly', 'British', 'accent.Another', 'highlight', 'Jack', 'down-to-earth', 'relationship', 'mom', 'Mary', 'Long', 'kinda', 'awesome', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'wear', 'awful', 'goofy', 'Christmas', 'sweater', 'scene', 'alone', 'price', 'admission.Obvious', 'similarities', 'SHALL', 'WE', 'DANCE', 'abound', 'COME', 'DANCE', 'WITH', 'ME', 'enough', 'form', 'own', 'identity', 'unexpectedly', 'lovely', 'little', 'romance', 'actors', 'keep', 'restrained', 'love', 'interplay', 'McCarthy', 'Nolden', 'conversational', 'form', 'rhythmic', 'motion', 'McCarthy', 'grace', 'dance', 'floor', 'Nolden', 'one', 'who', 'glides', 'poetry', 'legs', 'Man', 'appreciate', 'great', 'posture', 'women', 'Again', 'note', 'Nolden', 'blend', 'strength', 'fragility', 'traits', 'translated', 'as', 'well', 'dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'pick', 'up', 'helpful', 'ballroom', 'dancing', 'tips', 'such', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'look', 'feet', 'yo', 'watching', 'minutes', 'Christine', 'Jack', 'practicing', 'had', 'box', 'step', 'down', 'pat', 'am', 'tremendously', 'awesome', 'Christine', 'impeccable', 'instructor', 'season', 'traditionally', 'presided', 'unabashed', 'sentiment', 'how', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'Does', 'Jack', 'choose', 'naked', 'ambition', 'boost', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'love', 'box', 'step']",Come Dance With Me

Still a nice 'feel good' movie to watch during Holiday season.  The idea of watching Action/thriller/ shoot-em up or graphically overblown Sci-fy doesn't fill some people with 'Holiday Cheer'.  I used to like watching that sort of fare, but in the later stages of my life I've learned, and paid attention to WHAT are the important things that one needs to appreciate.
