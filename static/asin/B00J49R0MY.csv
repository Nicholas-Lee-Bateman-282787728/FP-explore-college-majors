Ruenger,"[0, 0]","At first this was a roll of the dice have not seen any of the eps was not sure what I was getting in to, besides seeing some trailers which is 50/50 for what a show is about. After watching it a few times thru I find my self enjoying it has few moments you think did they just do that as it is mild compared to a other anime that are in this genre which I enjoyed. First was going to give this 4 stars as it not the best anime I have seen yet it still was funny think it get better with its 2nd season.",5,just simple good fun.,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,502,"['first', 'was', 'roll', 'dice', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'eps', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'seeing', 'trailers', '50/50', 'what', 'show', 'watching', 'few', 'times', 'thru', 'find', 'self', 'enjoying', 'few', 'moments', 'think', 'did', 'just', 'do', 'mild', 'compared', 'other', 'anime', 'are', 'genre', 'enjoyed', 'First', 'was', 'going', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'best', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'yet', 'still', 'was', 'funny', 'think', 'get', 'better', '2nd', 'season']",N/A

I found it very funny to watch, the english dubbing isn't bad either. there are some changes in the lines but over all I think they made a good choice for the cast. the box it's self looks great with Tohka on the back, even the case covers them self's look great.Overall I am happy with this set",5,"kiss the girl, save the world",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,366,"['fell', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'simucast', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'watch', 'english', 'dubbing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', 'are', 'changes', 'lines', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'choice', 'cast', 'box', 'self', 'great', 'Tohka', 'back', 'even', 'case', 'look', 'great.Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'set']",N/A
1695417,A195PLFQV0UARO,B00J49R0MY,Solace,"[1, 1]","This series should be for kids because it's funny and amusing, but there is some very brief nudity.  This is centered around a few, &#34;oops I walked in and saw your butt while you were in the shower&#34; followed by Shido being punched out.  There is some fan service as well but it is by no means the focus of the show.  I would recommend this for ages 15+.While this is a typical harem set up, it is well done and entertaining.  There is an English dub which is Ok, but I prefer the Japanese voice acting which is excellent!  The animation style is modern and the girls are cute.  There is also some range in the animation with mecha battle suites, different city locations, and various outfits the characters wear.  The girls who are Spirits battle the female defense force.  It's a premise to blow things up and adds some entertainment value.  The real point of interest is Shido goes on dates with each Spirit while receiving advice from an ear piece that is linked to a &#34;dating command center.&#34;  The advice is often hysterically wrong and the &#34;advisors&#34; are amusing stereo types.  The objective is to make the Spirit girls happy and then kiss them to seal away their destructive power.  This makes them safe to join Shido in everyday life and battle for his attention.The show does fall short of five stars for a few reasons.  Why are the Spirits here?  The show leaves it as, &#34;For some unexplained reason...&#34;  By the last episode this plot point isn't resolved.  Overall the plot doesn't seem to progress.  None of the girls gain an advantage over their rivals in their pursuit of Shido.  The episodes are amusing and interesting and you don't really notice that season one is over until you see the credits.  There is a season 2 and a season 3 but the question remains on where to buy them?",4,Entertaining,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,1824,"['series', 'should', 'be', 'kids', 'funny', 'amusing', 'very', 'brief', 'nudity', 'centered', 'few', '34', 'oops', 'walked', 'saw', 'butt', 'were', 'shower', '34', 'followed', 'Shido', 'being', 'punched', 'out', 'fan', 'service', 'as', 'well', 'focus', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', '15+.While', 'typical', 'harem', 'set', 'up', 'well', 'done', 'entertaining', 'English', 'dub', 'Ok', 'prefer', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'excellent', 'animation', 'style', 'modern', 'girls', 'are', 'cute', 'also', 'range', 'animation', 'mecha', 'battle', 'suites', 'different', 'city', 'locations', 'various', 'characters', 'wear', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'Spirits', 'battle', 'female', 'defense', 'force', 'premise', 'blow', 'things', 'up', 'entertainment', 'value', 'real', 'point', 'interest', 'Shido', 'dates', 'Spirit', 'receiving', 'advice', 'ear', 'piece', 'linked', '34', 'dating', 'command', 'center.', '34', 'advice', 'often', 'hysterically', 'wrong', '34', 'advisors', '34', 'are', 'amusing', 'stereo', 'types', 'objective', 'make', 'Spirit', 'girls', 'happy', 'then', 'kiss', 'seal', 'away', 'destructive', 'power', 'safe', 'join', 'Shido', 'everyday', 'life', 'battle', 'attention.The', 'show', 'fall', 'short', 'five', 'stars', 'few', 'reasons', 'Why', 'are', 'Spirits', 'here', 'show', '34', 'unexplained', 'reason', '34', 'last', 'episode', 'plot', 'point', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'Overall', 'plot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'progress', 'None', 'girls', 'gain', 'advantage', 'rivals', 'pursuit', 'Shido', 'episodes', 'are', 'amusing', 'interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'season', 'one', 'see', 'credits', 'season', '2', 'season', '3', 'question', 'where', 'buy']",N/A
