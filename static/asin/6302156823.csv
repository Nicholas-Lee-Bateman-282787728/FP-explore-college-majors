More times then Robert Wagner and the late Natalie Wood. Charley Pearl(Baldwin),whose family manufactures Pearl Drops tooth polish(a real product),is a romantic swinger who falls in love with a lounge singer(Basinger). Charley is actually engaged to Adele Horner(Elisabeth Shue) whose father Lew(Robert Loggia) owns a movie studio. The Charley-Adele wedding has been called off after the 400+ sent invitations. However,the wedding was called off before Charley and the singer married for the first of five times. When the union made headlines,it angered Lew and brought tears to Adele. Lew is so pissed at Charley that Lew wants to kill Charley. Adele thought and hoped Charley would come back to her but no such luck. Charley and the singer ended buying and moving into Lew's home. Hey,do you think it's possible that Baldwin and Basinger will become husband and wife four more times in real life just like in this film? Wagner's and Wood's first marriage ended in divorce. They both remarried and divorced others,once respectively,before remarrying a second time.

I can't compare it to the dvd quality as I have never seen it in this format, but the blu-ray is pretty nice & the price is right too. I say if you like Kim or Alec go ahead & get this.

There are worse romantic comedies you could waste your time on, but this one is nostalgic and genuinely glamourous fun.  It's a great escape from all the current situation settings in similar films.Charlie Pearl (Alec Baldwin), multi-millionaire, is about to marry movie honcho Lou Horner's (Robert Loggia) daughter until his friends take him to Vegas for a bachelor party, and he falls for club singer Vickie Anderson (Kim Basinger), who also happens to be Bugsy Siegel's (Armand Assante) girlfriend.  It's a wild ride between a millionaire playboy and a fast nightclub singer that involves 4 marriages and 3 divorces.  It won't change your world, but it certainly is fun, the costumes are excellent, and the soundtrack is among my favorites.
