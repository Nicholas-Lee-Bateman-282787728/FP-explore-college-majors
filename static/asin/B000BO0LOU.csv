946470,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000BO0LOU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[1, 3]","The closest cousin to this film in the family of cinema has to be ""You Got Served."" Both films place cardboard cutout characters on screen to provide backdrop to a commercial for a niche hobby. The thing that is wrong with this strategy is that everybody involved in these hobbies would probably be offended by the lameness of the movie itself. You just couldn't look at it and be like, ""Yeah, that just totally represented what I am all about."" Anybody who watches this will recognize it as the utter crap that it is. The only thing that it does right is keep the images flashing in front of your eyeballs fast enough that you don't nod off. That means that I didn't suffer through this the way I would a truly sleep inducing stinker such as ""Laura's Star."" But just because your eyeballs won't fall asleep doesn't mean that your mind won't because everything about this production is brain dead. The biggest offended is almost certainly the script. Line after line had me pondering just how the script got approval from 20th Century Fox as it truly sounds like it was written by a 3rd grader trying to impress me with his toughness.We are treated to a tale of two brothers who like to race their bikes. One is studious and sells out as fast as he can, while the other is a slacker thus providing boring and obvious conflict. Once K.C (Steve Howey) sells out he starts in on lecturing his brother on how he needs to grow up and other things of that nature. The implication is clear, he is desired by corporations for his maturity and everybody should fall in line like him. That mindset only lasts so long as his new corporate buddies have only one plan in mind for him and that is wingman to their star Rowdy (Channing Tatum). You know where the story goes from here as we get a lesson on how you should never play second fiddle, which is fine but a little contradictory considering that the film is little more than a wingman for Mountain Dew, Honda, and Papa John's. If you listen closely you can even hear them slip in an ad for Las Vegas (""What happens in Vegas..."") that undoubtedly didn't come free.The whole point is to set up a race (on the biggest stage of them all!) between K.C and his former lord and master. But I didn't care at all. I did spend some time wondering about the racing footage itself as for all I know it was just stock footage considering that it served no purpose plot wise. I was also amused by the perplexing casting decision to pair grizzled, nail spitting Robert Patrick with useless pretty boy Aaron Carter as father and son. In the opening credits Clear Channel showed up, something I had never seen before. Since they are now notorious for backing the wrong war it should come as no surprise that they now backed the wrong movie. Paid for by knuckleheads, made by knuckleheads, for knuckleheads. Watch at your own risk and don't expect anything interesting or in the least bit thought provoking. **",2,I Be Like Huh?,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,2936,"['closest', 'cousin', 'film', 'family', 'cinema', 'be', 'Got', 'Served', 'films', 'place', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'characters', 'screen', 'provide', 'backdrop', 'commercial', 'niche', 'hobby', 'thing', 'wrong', 'strategy', 'everybody', 'involved', 'hobbies', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'offended', 'lameness', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'be', 'Yeah', 'just', 'totally', 'represented', 'what', 'am', 'Anybody', 'who', 'will', 'recognize', 'utter', 'crap', 'only', 'thing', 'right', 'keep', 'images', 'flashing', 'front', 'eyeballs', 'fast', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'nod', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'way', 'would', 'truly', 'sleep', 'inducing', 'stinker', 'such', 'Laura', 'Star', 'just', 'eyeballs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'fall', 'asleep', ""n't"", 'mean', 'mind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'because', 'everything', 'production', 'brain', 'dead', 'biggest', 'offended', 'almost', 'certainly', 'script', 'Line', 'line', 'had', 'pondering', 'just', 'how', 'script', 'got', 'approval', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'truly', 'was', 'written', '3rd', 'grader', 'trying', 'impress', 'toughness.We', 'are', 'treated', 'tale', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'like', 'race', 'bikes', 'One', 'studious', 'out', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'other', 'slacker', 'thus', 'providing', 'boring', 'obvious', 'conflict', 'Once', 'K.C', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'out', 'lecturing', 'brother', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'other', 'things', 'nature', 'implication', 'clear', 'desired', 'corporations', 'maturity', 'everybody', 'should', 'fall', 'line', 'mindset', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'new', 'corporate', 'buddies', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'plan', 'mind', 'wingman', 'star', 'Rowdy', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'know', 'where', 'story', 'here', 'get', 'lesson', 'how', 'should', 'never', 'play', 'second', 'fiddle', 'fine', 'little', 'contradictory', 'considering', 'film', 'little', 'more', 'wingman', 'Mountain', 'Dew', 'Honda', 'Papa', 'John', 'listen', 'closely', 'can', 'even', 'hear', 'slip', 'ad', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'What', 'Vegas', 'undoubtedly', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'free.The', 'whole', 'point', 'set', 'up', 'race', 'biggest', 'stage', 'K.C', 'former', 'lord', 'master', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did', 'spend', 'time', 'wondering', 'racing', 'footage', 'know', 'was', 'just', 'stock', 'footage', 'considering', 'served', 'purpose', 'plot', 'wise', 'was', 'also', 'amused', 'perplexing', 'casting', 'decision', 'pair', 'grizzled', 'nail', 'spitting', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'useless', 'pretty', 'boy', 'Aaron', 'Carter', 'father', 'son', 'opening', 'credits', 'Clear', 'Channel', 'showed', 'up', 'something', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'are', 'now', 'notorious', 'backing', 'wrong', 'war', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'now', 'backed', 'wrong', 'movie', 'Paid', 'knuckleheads', 'made', 'knuckleheads', 'knuckleheads', 'Watch', 'own', 'risk', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'interesting', 'least', 'bit', 'thought', 'provoking', '**']",Supercross

946473,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000BO0LOU,Lee Armstrong,"[16, 18]","While it's not an earthshattering film, ""Supercross"" does keep you glued to the screen with excellent motorcycle action sequences and some sweet romance.  Directed by Steve Boyum who directed ""Meet the Deedles,"" the plot is your basic underdog who wins the race & gets the girl.  Steve Howey from ""Reba"" TV series plays KC Carlyle who is a fairly cautious but talented racer.  He impresses the team of a Japanese motorcycle company who take him on.  Unfortunately, the head of this played by Robert Patrick only wants KC to be the wingman so his son Rowdy can win the races.  When KC pulls ahead and wins a race, he upstages Rowdy and quits the lavishly sponsored team.  Trip Carlyle played by Mike Vogel from ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" & ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" may be more talented, but he also takes more chances and lacks the maturity to control himself.  In their audition for the sponsored team, he gets into a fist fight with Rowdy, leading to his brother KC being chosen for the big job and relegating Trip to continue his day job cleaning pools.  Sophia Bush from TV's ""One Tree Hill"" plays Zoe, the wealthy law student whose pool KC cleans.  She comes to be his steady girl and helps him from time to time like a manager.  Cameron Richardson from ""The Good Humor Man"" plays Piper Cole and becomes attracted to Trip.  The romance between Piper & Trip is one of the high points as Trip who is so bold on a bike is a bit slow on the pickup with the ladies.  The two seem to connect very sweetly & sincerely on film showing great chemistry.  Daryl Hannah was listed as playing the mother in the promo credits, but I didn't recall her being in the movie!  The film concludes with KC, now a privateer rather than a sponsored rider, overcoming several obstacles including a biker named Evans who is out to get him to win the crown.  While not being classic cinema by any means, ""Supercross"" is an entertaining night at the theatre that has you rooting for the good guys.  You can almost feel the earth move under their bikes.

946475,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BO0LOU,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","I'll make my review short not to spend too many words on writing about what you have already known. I only say two things; `Supercross' is about the world of Supercross competition, and very short (80 mins). If I may add one more thing, you don't find anything else in the film.`Supercross' stars two young actors Steve Howey and Mike Vogel as two brothers who race motorcycle, but as you know, the film is made primarily for the purpose of showing the Supercross action scenes. So if the film is virtually full of clich&eacute;d items such as brotherly jealousy, father-like mentor, or big competition that concludes the film, it is perfectly OK with me. I actually do not care if one character gets badly injured during a race and is confined to bed, and the same person shows up again, only several days after the terrible accident, walking and even hopping on crutches as if it's only an ankle sprain.What really matters is the race scenes, which need more improvement. Don't get me wrong here because I am not talking about the races or the stunts themselves. Stunt-turned-director Steve Boyum shows a lot of shots of the Supercross bikes flying in the air, but he shows alarmingly little concern as to how to present them to us viewers. The camera overuses the same angles and the same techniques (like slow motion and fast-forwarding) over and over again. The shots of the dirt race course and the audiences (both real ones, I think) themselves are shot fine enough to convey the feeling of watching the real race, but as the director shows little skills in narrative, we have to listen carefully to the announcer's voice to know who is who, or who is winning.Those things deprive the film's actions of the dramatic tension of the race scenes. Watching a flying bike may be a really exciting experience, but you need more than that to make the race truly thrilling and exciting. After all you can watch the real ones at the Supercross competition, so why make a movie?",2,"Some Good Stunts, Not Very Good Direction",1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1975,"[""'ll"", 'make', 'review', 'short', 'not', 'spend', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'writing', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'known', 'only', 'say', 'two', 'things', 'Supercross', 'world', 'Supercross', 'competition', 'very', 'short', '80', 'mins', 'may', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'film.', 'Supercross', 'stars', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'race', 'motorcycle', 'know', 'film', 'made', 'primarily', 'purpose', 'showing', 'Supercross', 'action', 'scenes', 'So', 'film', 'virtually', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'items', 'such', 'brotherly', 'jealousy', 'father-like', 'mentor', 'big', 'competition', 'film', 'perfectly', 'OK', 'actually', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'one', 'character', 'badly', 'injured', 'race', 'confined', 'bed', 'same', 'person', 'up', 'again', 'only', 'several', 'days', 'terrible', 'accident', 'walking', 'even', 'hopping', 'crutches', 'only', 'ankle', 'sprain.What', 'really', 'matters', 'race', 'scenes', 'need', 'more', 'improvement', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'races', 'stunts', 'Stunt-turned-director', 'Steve', 'Boyum', 'lot', 'shots', 'Supercross', 'bikes', 'flying', 'air', 'alarmingly', 'little', 'concern', 'how', 'present', 'viewers', 'camera', 'same', 'angles', 'same', 'techniques', 'slow', 'motion', 'fast-forwarding', 'over', 'again', 'shots', 'dirt', 'race', 'course', 'audiences', 'real', 'ones', 'think', 'are', 'shot', 'fine', 'enough', 'convey', 'feeling', 'watching', 'real', 'race', 'director', 'little', 'skills', 'narrative', 'have', 'listen', 'carefully', 'announcer', 'voice', 'know', 'who', 'who', 'who', 'winning.Those', 'things', 'deprive', 'film', 'actions', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'race', 'scenes', 'Watching', 'flying', 'bike', 'may', 'be', 'really', 'exciting', 'experience', 'need', 'more', 'make', 'race', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'exciting', 'can', 'watch', 'real', 'ones', 'Supercross', 'competition', 'so', 'why', 'make', 'movie']",Supercross
