192393,ADZQ6GRC6YME2,1577138112,Rickie Burney,"[22, 24]","Normally, I disliked Shannon Tweed because they are cheap and the plot is normally just about sex.  My perspective of her was turned around when I  watched Naked Lies and this one.  This one relied more on suspense and  mystery then sex and nudity.She stars as a murderous and deceitful  woman who marries a wealthy man to get his money.  His stepdaughter has  suspicions about her.  After he dies of a fatal heart attack, she finds out  what she is really up to.  That is where the suspense and murder come in.  Yes, this movie may contain some strong sexuality, but it was not as  sexually charged as some of her other ridiculous films.Once  again, this is one of her best.  I recommend this to anyone who would like  to see a good Shannon Tweed suspense film.",4,Shannon Tweed does it again.,965692800,"08 8, 2000",2000,762,"['Normally', 'disliked', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'are', 'cheap', 'plot', 'normally', 'just', 'sex', 'perspective', 'was', 'turned', 'when', 'watched', 'Naked', 'Lies', 'one', 'one', 'relied', 'more', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'then', 'sex', 'nudity.She', 'stars', 'murderous', 'deceitful', 'woman', 'who', 'wealthy', 'man', 'get', 'money', 'stepdaughter', 'suspicions', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'up', 'where', 'suspense', 'murder', 'come', 'Yes', 'movie', 'may', 'contain', 'strong', 'sexuality', 'was', 'not', 'sexually', 'charged', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'films.Once', 'again', 'one', 'best', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'good', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'suspense', 'film']",Powerplay R-Rated  VHS
192394,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,1577138112,The Phantom,"[0, 0]","Where to start with this one? Well, it just doesn't make a lot of sense. Not so much because the plot doesn't make sense--it's actually mildly interesting--but because the movie never figures out what exactly it wants to be: Is it a thriller? A comedy? A heist picture? A sex romp? I never figured it out, and that's because the movie's makers obviously didn't know what they were going for here.The fact is that it does a little bit of all those, but doesn't do any of them particularly well. Heck, they couldn't even decide who the main character is. Shannon Tweed gets the cover, and in the beginning it appears to be her story...but about halfway through everything turns around and then it seems to be the story of the hot-shot (or is it dip-spit?) boyfriend, who hangs out with Candy (Danielle Ciardi), who is the only real reason to watch this mess. She disrobes about four times--one time full monty for the camera--and good lord what a body.Her sex scenes, though, with the (in those scenes goofy rather than menacing) boyfriend, are played more for laughs. Tweed's are more garden-variety from the erotic-thriller era from which this originates. I'm telling you...this movie tried hard to have something for everyone in the adult audience...even the gore-hounds. Jack of all trades, master of none.One other thing though...and a positive check-mark: It was refreshing to see Tweed cast as a villainess for once.",3,Huh?,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,1421,"['Where', 'start', 'one', 'Well', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'actually', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'never', 'out', 'what', 'exactly', 'be', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'heist', 'picture', 'sex', 'romp', 'never', 'figured', 'out', 'movie', 'makers', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'here.The', 'fact', 'little', 'bit', ""n't"", 'do', 'particularly', 'well', 'Heck', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'decide', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'cover', 'beginning', 'be', 'story', 'halfway', 'everything', 'turns', 'around', 'then', 'be', 'story', 'hot-shot', 'dip-spit', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'out', 'Candy', 'Danielle', 'Ciardi', 'who', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'mess', 'four', 'times', 'one', 'time', 'full', 'monty', 'camera', 'good', 'lord', 'what', 'body.Her', 'sex', 'scenes', 'though', 'scenes', 'goofy', 'rather', 'menacing', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'played', 'more', 'laughs', 'Tweed', 'are', 'more', 'garden-variety', 'erotic-thriller', 'era', ""'m"", 'telling', 'movie', 'tried', 'hard', 'have', 'something', 'everyone', 'adult', 'audience', 'even', 'gore-hounds', 'Jack', 'trades', 'master', 'none.One', 'other', 'thing', 'positive', 'check-mark', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Tweed', 'cast', 'villainess', 'once']",Powerplay R-Rated  VHS

192396,ACQLPYBFJM7BL,1577138112,William Burts,"[0, 0]","This is my second review of a Shannon Tweed movie. In my first review I said - No Contest - was her best movie, I still believe that,but power play wasn't that bad even through it is just another version of the black widow genre. I think Shannon to be equally seductive as Theresa Russell, just not as talented,this movie parallels that one, but the supporting characters in this film are what make this movie interesting. Danielle Ciardi (Candice)the daughter of one of Shannons victims and her boyfriend Steve. Who are out to turn the tables on Shannon are the characters that give this film life and sex appeal. I wish there were more shannon moments. But the few glimpse's of her were sufficiently sexy!. A entertaining and sometimes funny movie.I recommend this movie as a must for your Shannon Tweed collection.",4,Another version of black widow,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",2007,817,"['second', 'review', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'movie', 'first', 'review', 'said', 'Contest', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'still', 'believe', 'power', 'play', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'just', 'version', 'black', 'widow', 'genre', 'think', 'Shannon', 'be', 'equally', 'seductive', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'just', 'not', 'talented', 'movie', 'one', 'supporting', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Danielle', 'Ciardi', 'Candice', 'daughter', 'one', 'Shannons', 'victims', 'boyfriend', 'Steve', 'Who', 'are', 'turn', 'tables', 'Shannon', 'are', 'characters', 'give', 'film', 'life', 'sex', 'appeal', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'shannon', 'moments', 'few', 'glimpse', 'were', 'sufficiently', 'sexy', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'must', 'Shannon', 'Tweed', 'collection']",Powerplay R-Rated  VHS
