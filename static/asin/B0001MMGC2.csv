811040,A2HQ31XNN3OXES,B0001MMGC2,"Andrew Beaton ""lyrical chef""","[0, 3]","""You Got Served"" is a wholly commercial enterprise, a low-budget film about hip hop dancers starring B2K and Marques Houston, and written and directed by their manager. Although its stars have acting resumes, they are by no means good actors. The production values are so shoddy that the climactic scene shows the same crowd of extras over and over again in the same small slice of arena seats, as if the filmmakers were too lazy even to pretend like it was a real event. The plot is unbelievably cliche, the dialogue is banal and the stereotypes are egregious. Despite these flaws, and in fact because of them, I enjoyed every minute of it.Although the following paragraphs reveal much of this film's plot, the events that unfold are so formulaic and predictable that you could probably take a wild guess right now and get about 80% of it right.Our two protagonists, David (Omarion) and Elgin (Houston), begin the film as best friends and leaders of a top notch ""crew"" of dancing homies. David has even found love with Elgin's little sister. But when they're challenged by their future rivals, ""Wade's crew"" out of Orange County, things take a turn for the worse as they sell drugs to raise the bettin' money. Wade and his fellow honkies look like the rejects from O-Town tryouts, and their lineup includes Kevin Federline. (Seriously.) Then the wily white boys get a Judas from David and Elgin's crew to teach them all the hot ghetto moves, and they humiliate our heroes at the dance-off. That's when Wade - you have to see this guy to understand how ridiculous he is - slams the door on the idyllic first act with the best line in the movie: ""You're just mad...'cause tonight you suckas got served!""After that, everything goes to pieces as Elgin turns on David for chasing tail instead of working on his moves, and tells his sister to ""go home and stop acting like a ho!"". This tirade by Marques Houston is worth the price of admission alone. The crew splinters into weaker factions, and it ultimately takes the martyrdom of Walt from LOST to bring some healing.Things only get better as Lil' Kim arrives to take the role of deus ex machina. Her proclamation that the dance battle between Wade's crew and Elgin's new posse should be settled by a ""straight street"" showdown, compounded by a move by Wade that has to be the most colossal tactical error possible in that situation, allow David and Elgin to reunite for one final duel with their OC enemies. Gee, guess who is going to win? All I will reveal is that in the end, the tiny slice of crowd goes wild and chants ""Served! Served! Served!""",5,"""This Feud Is Stupid, Selfish, and it Affects a Lot of People""",1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,2597,"['Got', 'Served', 'wholly', 'commercial', 'enterprise', 'low-budget', 'film', 'hip', 'hop', 'dancers', 'starring', 'B2K', 'Marques', 'Houston', 'written', 'directed', 'manager', 'stars', 'have', 'acting', 'resumes', 'are', 'means', 'good', 'actors', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'shoddy', 'climactic', 'scene', 'same', 'crowd', 'extras', 'over', 'again', 'same', 'small', 'slice', 'arena', 'seats', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'too', 'lazy', 'even', 'pretend', 'was', 'real', 'event', 'plot', 'unbelievably', 'cliche', 'dialogue', 'banal', 'stereotypes', 'are', 'egregious', 'flaws', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'following', 'paragraphs', 'reveal', 'much', 'film', 'plot', 'events', 'unfold', 'are', 'so', 'formulaic', 'predictable', 'could', 'probably', 'take', 'wild', 'guess', 'right', 'now', 'get', 'about', '80', '%', 'two', 'protagonists', 'David', 'Omarion', 'Elgin', 'Houston', 'begin', 'film', 'best', 'friends', 'leaders', 'top', 'notch', 'crew', 'dancing', 'homies', 'David', 'even', 'found', 'love', 'Elgin', 'little', 'sister', 'when', ""'re"", 'challenged', 'future', 'rivals', 'Wade', 'crew', 'Orange', 'County', 'things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'sell', 'drugs', 'raise', 'bettin', 'money', 'Wade', 'fellow', 'honkies', 'look', 'rejects', 'O-Town', 'tryouts', 'lineup', 'Kevin', 'Federline', 'Seriously', 'Then', 'wily', 'white', 'boys', 'get', 'Judas', 'David', 'Elgin', 'crew', 'teach', 'hot', 'ghetto', 'moves', 'humiliate', 'heroes', 'dance-off', 'when', 'Wade', 'have', 'see', 'guy', 'understand', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'door', 'idyllic', 'first', 'act', 'best', 'line', 'movie', ""'re"", 'just', 'mad', 'tonight', 'suckas', 'got', 'served', 'everything', 'pieces', 'Elgin', 'David', 'chasing', 'tail', 'instead', 'working', 'moves', 'sister', 'go', 'home', 'stop', 'acting', 'ho', 'tirade', 'Marques', 'Houston', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'crew', 'splinters', 'weaker', 'factions', 'ultimately', 'martyrdom', 'Walt', 'LOST', 'bring', 'healing.Things', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'Lil', 'Kim', 'take', 'role', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'proclamation', 'dance', 'battle', 'Wade', 'crew', 'Elgin', 'new', 'posse', 'should', 'be', 'settled', 'straight', 'street', 'showdown', 'compounded', 'move', 'Wade', 'be', 'most', 'colossal', 'tactical', 'error', 'possible', 'situation', 'allow', 'David', 'Elgin', 'reunite', 'one', 'final', 'duel', 'OC', 'enemies', 'Gee', 'guess', 'who', 'going', 'win', 'will', 'reveal', 'end', 'tiny', 'slice', 'crowd', 'wild', 'chants', 'Served', 'Served', 'Served']",You Got Served

Here are the problems I had with the film.Liyah and David's relationship was nothing more than a plot point for angst in the group and it wasn't believable that they liked each other. Their lines were weak, corny, and came off forced and their acting was just horrible.The whole group acting excited over splitting little amounts of money after the main two get a majority of it, like they just hit the damn lottery. GMAB.Lil Kim needs to sit her ass down because she can't act looking like a f'd up Barbie doll walking around the stage trying to look important.

Delivering what, film never said what was in those bags that Elgin got his ass kicked for.Tired of listening to Elgin and David complain about working for Emerald. Stop doing it then duh!How did Steve Harvey's character get Emerald to back off just because he said so. Ok whatever.Beautifull was just a dumbass flouncing around repeating her name like she would forget how to spell it, mom should've called her TwitWhy wasn't the mother (Jackee Harry) involved in her children's fights, she didn't do anything and the grandmother was involved. Speaking of grandmother who just pulls $1500 out like that for dancing of all things. If Elgin is so hard up in putting his sister through college & bills why didn't he just ask for the money to help his sister and mother, no he wants to use it for dancing...dumbass and the grandma's a dumbass too.Lil Saint did I lose the memo where I'm suppose to feel sorry for him because he got killed. The kid didn't do anything significant in the film but be a hinderance.The other crew saying they don't practice, now we know that's b.s., like they gonna know their teammates exact movements by going out there and free flowing, yea right!B2K or whatever they are called are some of the worst actors in history.The final dance is so typical of course a damn tie so the group can get back together after they disbanded.

The dance moves are pretty much the same throughout the movie, the dancing crew in that final dance off names the crew after a kid who is a minor character, and we have rich Orange County white boys who think talking slang makes them look cool all of a sudden. Now the kid Little Saint who died in the movie was a genuinely sad part but I found it to be corny when they all of a sudden decide, ""Oh we'll name our crew after Little Saint!"" Little Saint was a minor character in that movie who we see for a grand total of 5 minutes it seems. I'm criticizing that part of the movie from a plot standpoint. And about the Orange County white boys who were talking slang, I cringed every time they were talking slang. Warren Beatty's character from Bulworth is 2pac compared to these 2. Now my opinions on the main characters: I'm very lenient when it comes to recording artists acting in movies unless your names are Omarion Grandberry and Marques Houston. These guys are just not cut out to be in movies and their performances in this movie are dreadful. Jennifer Freeman, who I like in My Wife And Kids, had an ok performance and could have a nice movie career down the road but this movie being on her resume certainly makes that prospect difficult. But to her defense, the terrible writing doomed her. Meagan Good, who is one of my favorite actresses, had an ok performance at times and other times it seemed forced. And I found it funny when Steve ""Mr. Old School"" Harvey was in a hip hop movie when he said in The Original Kings Of Comedy he wasn't into the all hip hop and rap stuff. But I guess he had a change of heart and his performance was actually the best one in the entire movie. Now that's no indictment on Steve Harvey. It just shows you how god awful this movie is.

Now, a decade later, it has happened again.  Only this time the adults seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids were.  Somehow, amongst the horrendous acting and over-the-top scenarios, an entire theatre of kids and adults alike couldn't be more satisfied.

In this film, a popular LA dance crew from the `hood is challenged to a $5,000 showdown by a rival crew from, of all places, Orange County.

I keep seeing comparisons to Breaking and some older hip hop movies.  This movie is a lot different, and is in a category by itself.  Then dancing in this film is not just break dancing, but all kinds of different dance moves.  This is not the late 80?s and early 90's.  We are in a different time, and the dancing is different, but I like it!!  I can't do it, but I like to watch it!!!!  The acting in this film is decent, and the dance moves are awesome!!!!  I would watch the dance scenes over and over.  The dancing was just phenomenal to me.The movie is about two friends who are in a dance crew.  They compete in dance battles at Mr. Rad's (played by Steve Harvey) for money.  David an L are challenged by a rival crew for a $5,000 purse, which they lose when the rival crew has one of their dancers.  That dancer showed the rival crew the moves.  David (Omari Grandberry B2K), and L (Marques Houston- Sister Sister & IMx) also do runs for a drug dealer for money.  When L gets jumped, he is upset with David, and does not want to be friends with him anymore. L's sister (Jennifer Freeman ? My Wife and kids) has feelings for David, but to keep the peace makes the hard choice to keep her distance.  When a dance contest for a $50,000 prize, and a chance to dance in Lil Kim's video the friends put aside their differences to compete for the prize, and to honor the death of Lil Saint.  I was actually surprised to see Steve Harvey in this movie.  He is not a fan of hip hop, but his part was a father type of figure in the movie.  He was the man of reason, and the man who held the dance competitions at his establishment to keep the kids out of trouble.My major complaint was Lil Kim.  She can't act, and all that make up made her look terrible.  Lil Kim needs some serious acting lessons, and someone find her a better make up artist.  Also who dresses her?  Just terrible!!!!Meagan Goode had a very small role as Liyah's friend.  Her name was Beautifull (with two L's).  I seriously doubt this role will do anything for her career, it was that minor.  I've seen her in much better roles.Anyone who is a now defunct B2k fan will love this movie.  Anyone who is a Marques Houston fan will love this movie.

The gravity-defying dances, always exciting and amusing to see, are simply great.  And the rest of the film?  Nothing worth your time.  Be ready to push the fast-forward button, for you need to do that so often.Again I say, the dances are wonderful.  The film is basically about the two boys Elgin and David, the unbeatable dancers.  With them as the main force, their team are actually invincible at the dance battles until one day some other team (two white kids as leaders) 'stole' their dances.  Does not this sound like 'Bring It On'?The generic story is so awfully done that you start to wish that someone cut the film by 60 minutes, and make it a music video.  Think about this.  Elgin and David, when they are not at the dancingfloor, they are A) playing basketball in the neighborhood; B) carrying some stuff for underground employer: C) dating a girl (whose brother happens to be your best pal); and D) got involved in some trouble because of B or C.  Oh, and don't forget that one of their friends got shot by a gun.If someone should write this kind of script, he would be blamed for relying too much cliche.  If that film features Afro-Americans (as this film does), he would be accused of stereotyping them.  I don't know anything about the writer/director, but I only hope that he realizes it by now.The dancing, and probably its soundtrack (which I found good), are the only reason that you should see it.
