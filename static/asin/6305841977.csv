The script, the acting and the general tone of this movie is beyond repulsive, it is tawdry, inane and ultimately, quite pathetic. However, there is one overwhelmingly redeeming feature to ""Bluebeard:"" it is so bad it is unintentionally hilarious!Burton sleepwalks through this silly film with a cheap, stick-on goatee. As always, he overacts to a ridiculous degree and one eternally wonders why his directors never took him aside and said, ""Richard, you don't need to scream every single line."" Alas, Burton is magnificently dreadful here, his attempts at lovemaking become bombastically embarrassing to watch, his few, brief attempts at some decent acting are wickedly futile. One real-life moment to ponder: following one love scene with one of the no-name Italian starlets, the director yelled, ""cut!"" but Burton and the starlet continued kissing and then walked off the set to Burton's waiting limousine. Hmmm, where was Liz?This is a great movie to enjoy with a few beers and a readiness to make fun of every scene and hurl collective invective against Richard Burton.

I think I have now seen Richard Burton at his very best.  ( Perhaps ""The Wild Geese"" could be an exception. )  I loved this move.  It made me laugh over and over again.  And the women were wonderful and beautiful.  Raquel Welch was stunning.  She alone was worth the watch. However I have to say that Joey Heatherton made this movie for me.  She was never the best actress on the big or small screen.  BUT if she is not the sexiest I will eat my hat.  Girls today wish they had the sex appeal, even one tenth of the sex appeal that Ms. Heatherton carried with her.  WOW!  How I miss the days of my youth ogling and drooling over Joey Heatherton.  This movie reminded just how twitterpated she got me as a very young man just beginning to notice women. Perhaps I should say just beginning to notice what women like Joey Heatherton could do to me.  I didn't understand it then but I sure do now and wish I had many more movies of her.Anyway. I say buy this movie and watch it over and over again and enjoy every second of it.

480845,A3Q61B02RGUUJW,6305841977,Joseph A. Admire,"[1, 1]","Richard Burton was one of those actors who just couldn't be bothered to show any discrimination in what roles he picked as long as he got a paycheck (and maybe a bottle of good Scotch and a comely starlet into the bargain).  When he was good, he could be great; when he was bad, he could be a real gas.  Consider ""Bluebeard"", where Burton plays the legendary killer of beautiful women while wearing one of the silliest stage beards of all time.  It's a perfect example of the big-budget bad movie.  The director couldn't seem to decide whether to make a Big Statement about Nazism (Burton's Bluebeard is a pseudo-Nazi leader, who probably would have been an actual Nazi except that the production ran afoul of German laws prohibiting the use of Nazi regalia in entertainment and had to use clumsy substitutes) or smack his lips over Bluebeard's seductions and murders of six gorgeous wives (and one lovely but unfortunate girlfriend of one of the wives).  It ends up being unintentional and rather smutty black comedy.Actually, I need to rethink the phrase ""big budget""; the production apparently didn't have the money to be able to keep the actresses around to impersonate corpses in the Big Scene where Joey Heatherton, playing Bluebeard's latest wife (an American flapper who makes one glad that the Roaring Twenties ended with the Crash of '29) discovers the frozen bodies of the previous entries in the Wife-of-Bluebeard Sweepstakes.  What she actually sees when she opens the door of Bluebeard's cleverly hidden freezer are seven department-store mannequins inexpertly dressed up to look like the previous victims.  If they were able to get Karin Schubert to play dead for the disturbingly necrophilia-themed scene where Burton takes photos of her body as it lies laid out for her funeral, surely they could have collected the various actresses together to have them imitate Popsicles for this key scene.  It's emblematic of how clumsy this production is.Do yourselves a favor and Google for bad-movie maven Jabootu's review of ""Bluebeard"". It's a classic and says just about everything else I could have said here.  Or you could, if you have a DVD player capable of playing Region 2 discs, look for the Italian comedy ""Le sei mogli di Barbablu"", which stars rubber-faced comedy legend Toto and features Sophia Loren in one of her very first roles.All that said, should you get this movie?

It certainly was trashy, campy at times, but not really entertaining. But, let's start with the good things: The film is very nice looking, with great, campy set designs,  Ennio Morricone's soundtrack is very good and there's also some nice 1920s music such as the Charleston. The movie is reviewed in the excellent book ""Bad Movies We Love"". The authors panned Heatherton's performance but I thought she was pretty good. Richard Burton gives a routine performance and it's always nice to see Raquel Welch, although she, despite getting second billing, only has a small role.What makes ""Bluebeard"" a disappointment for me is the story, or rather, the story structure. It starts with Burton marrying a girl, who's then killed in a hunting ""accident"". He then marries American night club dancer Joey Heatherton. It's not long before Heatherton finds a number of Burton's ex-wives in a freezing room in his castle. Burton tells her since she knows his secret he'll have to kill her too, and proceeds to tell about his previous wives and how he killed them. These are told in flashbacks and while there are some good scenes, it's very slow paced and it's not long before it starts to get pretty dull to watch. I think the movie could have been pretty good if they'd trimmed it down about 20 minutes or so. I also wish the filmmakers could have decided what type of movie they wanted to make.

Richard Burton is a brilliant actor but,  if this performance is the only one you've seen, you might find that statement hard to believe.",2,What were they thinking??

480851,A26WVK274IA7DN,6305841977,Sarah Bellum,"[11, 16]","(3.5/5 stars) Here's a little oddity from the early 70's. Richard Burton plays Austrian Baron Kurt von Sepper, a hero during World War One, whose wealth, fame and good looks make it very easy for him to attract beautiful, young women. Little do they realize that he is one sadistic and misogynistic man, whose hatred of Russians, Communists and unions is matched only by his propensity to use violence as a solution against his perceived threats. (Sounds like the ideal match for Ann Coulter, doesn't he?) When workers begin to organize into a union, he dispatches some of his Nazi compatriots to burn, pillage and likewise intimidate the mostly Jewish laborers. To claim that he suffers from various neuroses and psychoses would be to state the obvious. One of the roots of these is his mommy issues, which are manifested by keeping his mother's decaying corpse in one of the rooms of his mansion. Another cause of his troubles lies in a secret, which he tries to keep from the women in his life. The secret is not revealed until the end of the movie, though most viewers will have figured it out long before that. Although the plot makes the film sound like it belongs in the thriller or perhaps suspense genres, it actually plays more like a very dark comedy with some social commentary thrown in. I'm not entirely convinced that was the goal from the onset because it is neither clever enough to succeed very well as a black comedy nor serious enough to work as a straightforward drama. Some of it, such as Raquel Welch's role, was definitely intended to be funny; however, several of the funniest parts come during the most dramatic moments. It is either a brilliantly executed comedy or a woefully inept attempt at satire. Either way, it is a tremendous amount of fun and I recommend it highly. Richard Burton is a hoot as the sadistic Baron and the women in the film are all quite attractive. Joey Heatherton gets to show off her dancing skills, her acting... um, ability and her other... uh, talents (which are two reasons for the `R' rating). Of note is the production by the father and son team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who would go on to produce the Christopher Reeve Superman films. Also of note is the quality of Lionsgate's DVD production, which is quite good. The picture is crisp and letterboxed, the colors are vibrant and there are optional subtitles. 3/5 stars for the film; 4/5 stars for the DVD",4,"""I am a man and I can prove it!""",1200528000,"01 17, 2008",2008,2421,"['3.5/5', 'stars', 'Here', 'little', 'oddity', 'early', '70', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'Austrian', 'Baron', 'Kurt', 'von', 'Sepper', 'hero', 'World', 'War', 'One', 'wealth', 'fame', 'good', 'looks', 'make', 'very', 'easy', 'attract', 'beautiful', 'young', 'women', 'Little', 'do', 'realize', 'one', 'sadistic', 'misogynistic', 'man', 'hatred', 'Russians', 'Communists', 'unions', 'matched', 'only', 'propensity', 'use', 'violence', 'solution', 'perceived', 'threats', 'ideal', 'match', 'Ann', 'Coulter', ""n't"", 'When', 'workers', 'begin', 'organize', 'union', 'Nazi', 'compatriots', 'burn', 'pillage', 'likewise', 'intimidate', 'mostly', 'Jewish', 'laborers', 'claim', 'various', 'neuroses', 'psychoses', 'would', 'be', 'state', 'obvious', 'One', 'roots', 'mommy', 'issues', 'are', 'manifested', 'keeping', 'mother', 'decaying', 'corpse', 'one', 'rooms', 'mansion', 'cause', 'troubles', 'secret', 'keep', 'women', 'life', 'secret', 'not', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'have', 'figured', 'out', 'long', 'plot', 'film', 'sound', 'thriller', 'perhaps', 'suspense', 'genres', 'actually', 'more', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'social', 'commentary', 'thrown', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'convinced', 'was', 'goal', 'onset', 'clever', 'enough', 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'black', 'comedy', 'serious', 'enough', 'work', 'straightforward', 'drama', 'such', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'role', 'was', 'definitely', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'however', 'several', 'funniest', 'parts', 'come', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'comedy', 'woefully', 'inept', 'attempt', 'satire', 'way', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'fun', 'recommend', 'highly', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'hoot', 'sadistic', 'Baron', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Joey', 'Heatherton', 'show', 'off', 'dancing', 'skills', 'acting', 'um', 'ability', 'other', 'uh', 'talents', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', 'R', 'rating', 'note', 'production', 'father', 'son', 'team', 'Alexander', 'Ilya', 'Salkind', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'produce', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'films', 'Also', 'note', 'quality', 'Lionsgate', 'DVD', 'production', 'quite', 'good', 'picture', 'crisp', 'letterboxed', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'are', 'optional', 'subtitles', '3/5', 'stars', 'film', '4/5', 'stars', 'DVD']",Bluebeard
