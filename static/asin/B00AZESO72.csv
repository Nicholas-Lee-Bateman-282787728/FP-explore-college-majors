Sienna Miller is absolute perfection as Tippi Hedren. Sienna is more than a pretty face, and she shows she's got the acting chops to pull it off. I also thought Toby Jones was a good choice to play Alfred Hitchcock. The Girl is about Tippi's working relationship with Hithcock while filming The Birds and Marnie. Tippi claims that Alfred mistreated her and made sexual advances towards her which she refused to give in to. Tippi eventually grows disgusted by his unprofessionalism and asks Alfred to release her from her contract. Of course this doesn't go over smoothly and Tippi's movie career stalls after that. This movie is a bit slow-paced but the film is even more chilling to watch the second time around. It's creepy and yet elegant all at the same time. Give it a chance.

There is quite a bit of evidence to dispute the claims made by this film, as well as Spoto's book of tabloid journalism. It was so easy for them. They did not have to rely on any real, true to life facts or details. They decided to toss all reality out the window. One would think that with this kind of freedom they could come up with a dramatically interesting, and well made film. To make matters worse, there are a number of people who will blindly believe this film's accusations (on a man who is no longer alive to defend himself).

1618591,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B00AZESO72,California Dreaming,"[5, 8]","I saw ""The Girl"" about a month or two ago, so I've surely forgotten some of the details by now.  But what I haven't forgotten:  Toby Jones gives another tour de force performance here as Alfred Hitchcock.I really noticed Mr. Jones for the first time in ""Infamous,"" a character where he completely inhabits Truman Capote.  He was surely better playing the famous writer in that film than Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Mr. Hoffman is definitely no slouch.  It was just that Mr. Jones' performance was absolutely mesmerizing, and I really thought while watching the film that I was watching Mr. Capote.  One of the better acting performances ever.  Yes, EVER.While Mr. Jones maybe wasn't quite that good playing Mr. Hitchcock, he surely was close.  Another amazing performance, and at this point I wonder if he possibly can do no wrong.  It sure seems that way.  Perhaps he's the male version of Meryl Streep, in the sense that he truly does the research -- and has the pure acting chops -- to never have a bad performance.  On his worst day he's better than most actors in Hollywood.Now, while this film is called ""The Girl,"" it really should be called ""The Boy,"" or make that ""The Man,"" as it is about one of the better directors of the 20th century.  Sure, it's about Tippi Hedren, who was in at least two movies by Mr. Hitchcock, where she did an excellent job in both.  But it's more about ""Hitch"" due to perhaps thematic concerns:  Hitch was looking for that blond, that girl, who was not only an actress, but also an imaginary and impossible woman who met his every fantasy.  And Sienna Miller does an excellent job herself playing the actress whom I believe is still working today.I'm hedging on a five on this one, but I usually reserve that for films that are life-changing experiences.  This film may not be that, but watch Mr. Jones.  His acting is life changing, at least for him, as he more than inhabits any role that he plays.",4,(But it's really) About a Boy,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2013,1937,"['saw', 'Girl', 'month', 'two', 'ago', ""'ve"", 'surely', 'forgotten', 'details', 'now', 'what', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'here', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock.I', 'really', 'noticed', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'first', 'time', 'Infamous', 'character', 'where', 'completely', 'Truman', 'Capote', 'was', 'surely', 'better', 'playing', 'famous', 'writer', 'film', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Mr.', 'Hoffman', 'definitely', 'slouch', 'was', 'just', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'performance', 'was', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'really', 'thought', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Capote', 'One', 'better', 'acting', 'performances', 'ever', 'Yes', 'EVER.While', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'good', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Hitchcock', 'surely', 'was', 'close', 'amazing', 'performance', 'point', 'wonder', 'possibly', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'sure', 'way', 'Perhaps', 'male', 'version', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'sense', 'truly', 'research', 'pure', 'acting', 'chops', 'never', 'have', 'bad', 'performance', 'worst', 'day', 'better', 'most', 'actors', 'Hollywood.Now', 'film', 'called', 'Girl', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Boy', 'make', 'Man', 'one', 'better', 'directors', '20th', 'century', 'Sure', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'who', 'was', 'least', 'two', 'movies', 'Mr.', 'Hitchcock', 'where', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'more', 'Hitch', 'due', 'perhaps', 'thematic', 'concerns', 'Hitch', 'was', 'looking', 'blond', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'actress', 'also', 'imaginary', 'impossible', 'woman', 'who', 'met', 'fantasy', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'actress', 'whom', 'believe', 'still', 'working', 'today.I', ""'m"", 'hedging', 'five', 'one', 'usually', 'reserve', 'films', 'are', 'life-changing', 'experiences', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'watch', 'Mr.', 'Jones', 'acting', 'life', 'changing', 'least', 'more', 'inhabits', 'role']",The Girl

1618593,A1YIYS3J7EQ3F8,B00AZESO72,"C. Santas ""Constantine/film buff""","[4, 6]","I saw ""The Girl,"" directed by Julian Jarrold, and starring Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Tippi Hedren, and I found this--as did my partner, both lovers of Hitchcock--quite disturbing. Though I had read Spoto's ""Spellbound by Beauty"" and was duly warned as to the contents of the movie, it still was quite shocking to see this anomalous relationship develop from the beginning. Though the movie was made as a low budget film, intended for TV (HBO), it does an amazing job in concentrating on the essentials, basically the beginning of Hitchcock's discovery of Hedren in a TV ad, his hiring her, assigning her the role of Melanie Daniels in ""The Birds,"" a film that was not easy to make, and subsequently using her in ""Marnie,"" which some consider HItchcock's last materpiece. ""The Girl"" concentrates almost exclusively on the relationwhip of Hitchocock to Hedren, and it provides concrete and undisputed evidence that HItchcock DID indeed harrass Hedren, making his intentions known from the start, citing obscene limericks to her and attempting to kiss her in his car, and subsequently tormenting her on the set, unleashing a relentless barrage of real birds in the famous attic scene, reaching up to 43 takes, and causing her untold physical torment. In ""Marnie,"" she asks out of her contract, when he asks her to ""touch"" him, but he refuses, stating that's the end of her career. She shows her revulsion of him in no uncertain terms, but she continues to work on the movie, defiantly,knowing full weel that is the end of her. The movie offers more highlights of their head to head collisions, and sometimes it is hard to watch. Hitchcock fancies himself as Pygmalion, the ancient sculptor who fell inb love with his statue of Galatea, and the gods granted him his wish and she came to life. Hedren tells him that he took a ""live, breathing human being"" and turned her to a statue. Sienna Miller is just fine in the role, and Toby Jones comes off as a diminutive pervert, shorter that the full-bodied HItchcock, definitely looking more sinister than the Master ever did. He lacks Hitchcock's devilish charm, and phlegmatic, laid-back hypnotic delivery that drew in audiences in his famous TV shows prologue. JOnes delivers only an intimation what Hitchcock would look like when propositioning, or sadistically tormenting Hedren on the set, in full view of his associates, many of whom were amazed at his obvious cruelty to her. Admirers of Hitchock may be revolted by the tearing down of their image of ""The Master of Suspense,"" so adored by critics for what looks like a a century now. I am an admirerer of Hitchcock's art, and ""The Birds"" is actually one of my two or three favorite Hitchcock films. But make no mistake. Donald Spoto is a good film historian, and he would not make up this as a fantasy. There is something very disturbing here,regardless as to the merits of the movie, which by the way received three nominations in the Golden Gloves, Best Picture being one. Tippy Hedren appears in a (too) brief interview in the extras, and she confirms for the most part what is said in the movie. NO matter what Hitchcock's post-mortem is on this matter, Hedren still lives, and not even Miller's worthwhile efforts can recreate the image of the statuesque beauty, the classy lady that shows up in a small fishing village, only to it torn apart by nature's fury. In ""Marnie"" too Hedren was superrb. She was a novice, yes, but she stands out as one of the blonde sirens Hitchcock brought on the screen--Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, Kim Novak--Hedren will stay up there with them.The film also shows that she had the guts not to quit.",4,"Yes, it was that bad....",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,3655,"['saw', 'Girl', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'starring', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Hitchcock', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'found', 'did', 'partner', 'lovers', 'Hitchcock', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'had', 'read', 'Spoto', 'Spellbound', 'Beauty', 'was', 'duly', 'warned', 'contents', 'movie', 'still', 'was', 'quite', 'shocking', 'see', 'anomalous', 'relationship', 'develop', 'beginning', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'intended', 'TV', 'HBO', 'amazing', 'job', 'concentrating', 'essentials', 'basically', 'beginning', 'Hitchcock', 'discovery', 'Hedren', 'TV', 'ad', 'hiring', 'assigning', 'role', 'Melanie', 'Daniels', 'Birds', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'make', 'subsequently', 'using', 'Marnie', 'consider', 'HItchcock', 'last', 'materpiece', 'Girl', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'relationwhip', 'Hitchocock', 'Hedren', 'concrete', 'undisputed', 'evidence', 'HItchcock', 'DID', 'indeed', 'harrass', 'Hedren', 'making', 'intentions', 'known', 'start', 'citing', 'obscene', 'limericks', 'attempting', 'kiss', 'car', 'subsequently', 'tormenting', 'set', 'unleashing', 'relentless', 'barrage', 'real', 'birds', 'famous', 'attic', 'scene', 'reaching', 'up', '43', 'causing', 'untold', 'physical', 'torment', 'Marnie', 'contract', 'when', 'touch', 'stating', 'end', 'career', 'revulsion', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'work', 'movie', 'defiantly', 'knowing', 'full', 'weel', 'end', 'movie', 'more', 'highlights', 'head', 'head', 'collisions', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'watch', 'Hitchcock', 'Pygmalion', 'ancient', 'sculptor', 'who', 'fell', 'inb', 'love', 'statue', 'Galatea', 'gods', 'granted', 'wish', 'came', 'life', 'Hedren', 'took', 'live', 'breathing', 'human', 'being', 'turned', 'statue', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'just', 'fine', 'role', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'off', 'diminutive', 'pervert', 'shorter', 'full-bodied', 'HItchcock', 'definitely', 'looking', 'more', 'sinister', 'Master', 'ever', 'did', 'Hitchcock', 'devilish', 'charm', 'phlegmatic', 'laid-back', 'hypnotic', 'delivery', 'drew', 'audiences', 'famous', 'TV', 'shows', 'prologue', 'JOnes', 'delivers', 'only', 'intimation', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'would', 'look', 'when', 'propositioning', 'sadistically', 'tormenting', 'Hedren', 'set', 'full', 'view', 'associates', 'many', 'whom', 'were', 'amazed', 'obvious', 'cruelty', 'Admirers', 'Hitchock', 'may', 'be', 'revolted', 'tearing', 'image', 'Master', 'Suspense', 'so', 'adored', 'critics', 'what', 'century', 'now', 'am', 'admirerer', 'Hitchcock', 'art', 'Birds', 'actually', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'favorite', 'Hitchcock', 'films', 'make', 'mistake', 'Donald', 'Spoto', 'good', 'film', 'historian', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'fantasy', 'something', 'very', 'disturbing', 'here', 'regardless', 'merits', 'movie', 'way', 'received', 'three', 'nominations', 'Golden', 'Gloves', 'Best', 'Picture', 'being', 'one', 'Tippy', 'Hedren', 'too', 'brief', 'interview', 'extras', 'most', 'part', 'what', 'said', 'movie', 'NO', 'matter', 'what', 'Hitchcock', 'post-mortem', 'matter', 'Hedren', 'still', 'not', 'even', 'Miller', 'worthwhile', 'efforts', 'can', 'recreate', 'image', 'statuesque', 'beauty', 'classy', 'lady', 'up', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'only', 'torn', 'apart', 'nature', 'fury', 'Marnie', 'too', 'Hedren', 'was', 'superrb', 'was', 'novice', 'yes', 'out', 'one', 'blonde', 'Hitchcock', 'brought', 'screen', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'Hedren', 'will', 'stay', 'there', 'them.The', 'film', 'also', 'had', 'guts', 'not', 'quit']",The Girl

Toby Jones offers a hard-edged portrayal of Hitchcock; this is not the lovable old rogue of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, but a sexually frustrated old lecher with an unhealthy obsession for Hedren that extends to making improper suggestions as well as repeatedly calling her at her house. These days his strategies would be termed sexual harassment.  Sienna Miller offers a glacial portrait of Hedren, whose strength of will is expressed through her unwillingness to respond to Hitchcock's advances.  However the film's concentration on the seamier side of Hitchcock's nature tends to overlook his greatness as a filmmaker; we do not get any sense that he was one of Hollywood's major players, even in his sixties.  Julian Jarrold's film is shot on a low budget; its tawdry use of exterior locations make it seem that Hitchcock is shooting a television film rather than a big-budget production.

1618595,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00AZESO72,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[10, 13]","THE GIRL (HBO Films and the BBC, for HBO, 2012, 92 minutes), based on the bookSpellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladiesby Donald Spoto is spellbinding. Real, solid, good old-fashioned film at its best. (By the way, Spoto also wrote many other relevant, delightful books:The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures,The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcocksee my review andHigh Society: The Life of Grace Kelly.)Hitch (a stunning as always Toby Jones with very little makeup and pure genius) discovers model Tippi Hedren (a gorgeous Sienna Miller) and decides he has to cast her in his upcoming filmThe Birds.While brilliantly dancing between the lives of the two main characters, this film shows us the power and determination that made Tippi Hedren perhaps the only woman to work with Hitchcock and match him move for move.In this tight, beautifully shot 92 minutes we see the entire history of Hitchcock's relationship with Hedren - from the awful ""accident"" Hitchcock arranged for her in the phone booth during the shooting of BIRDS to the purely evil decision to have her enter a room full of trained birds ready to attack her without her knowledge - going right to the end at the wrap ofMarnie. Miller does an equally beautiful job, going from a sexy model to a slightly older looking, haunted Hedren.That face I'd know anywhere: Hedren's perpetually haunted face, the lines around her sad, slightly protruding eyes which I noted weren't there when she was just a few years younger. Hedren herself assisted with this film, and it had been some time since I have seen her - but my admiration for her is no less than ever. (I got the pleasure of seeing her again when she was interviewed about this film and her reminiscences.)Imelda Staunton does a fantastic job as Hitchcock's wife Alma - never does she intrude here, just as Alma kept well out of sight in real life, preferring to watch her husband from a position well out of the limelight. Like Jones, Staunton vanishes into her role in a spooky way. Now I really feel like the voyeur Hitchcock always referenced when talking about his audience.I also deeply enjoyed the Hollywood-film-about-Hollywood attitude here: everything was just as I had imagined, but the scenes showing Hitchcock making his films were short, never sweet, alway strikingly real. This film actually builds up a fearful, suspense-riddled tension during those scenes, since we know what is coming and Hedren does not; equally we are just as shocked as Hedren when she finds herself in Hitchcock's horrendous artistic grasp.That she walked away from him with such aplomb, such strength, is one of the many reasons I admire her. She could easily have been the ""next"" Grace Kelly - but she chose not to do so. She left Hitchcock high and dry.This film also does several brilliant little shots paying homage to Hitchcock's films, from THE BIRDS toPsycho (1960), even throwing in a few of Hitchcock's cinematic inventions in the actual shooting - never going overboard, just the director thanking Hitchcock. A true fan letter from director to director. That attitude here is what I loved the most. How this will fare when compared to Sir Anthony Hopkin's film, only time will tell the truth.Jones has been down this unfortunate road before: in the uglyInfamoushe played Truman Capote (most brilliantly) but he was beaten to the punch in that case by Philip Seymour Hoffman's interpretation inCapote. Jones was all but ignored. Hoffman won an Oscar. In such cases, however, I don't see how Jones can ever line himself up for an Oscar or a wider audience.

Tippi Hedren gives an exclusive interview about the whole thing and comments on moments of the film from her own memory - of course, she was a consultant here.

1618596,A30ICW8L8XPV53,B00AZESO72,"Einar ""nordikmn49""","[0, 2]","Subtitle:  Sienna Miller miscast fails 'The Girl'!Toby Jones is brilliant.  Sienna Miller is no actress. I give them an 'A' for clothing/makeup!I've seen criticisms here of Tippi Hedren who admitted she was a model not an actress when her career began, but she had more talent in one fingernail than Ms. Miller!  Miss Miller is truly wooden and does the worst thing an actor can do:  Acts like she's acting~!  You might as well listen to her doing a reading of the script.  Her facial features are dull and her pretense at being a lady of that time is miserable.  Ms. Hedren's modeling training gave her poise and grace.  Hitch wanted her glacial but her humanity shows through.  Her intellect and charm are her own in 'The Birds' and she is absolutely believable as a spoiled socialite of that era who would have had some woodenness to her (I lived in NYC in the 70s and knew some.).  She brings to 'Marnie' a vulnerability and isolation that is amazing for an untrained actress in her second role!  Hitch bored with the film and thus the ending is somewhat abrupt and contrived.I thought Hitch a brilliant film maker and still do, but he obviously had character flaws.  One must remember these are human beings.  I think you can also find what is considered his classic 'Psycho' to have the same flaws--contrived and abrupt ending which now seems corny.  One can watch his films and think of reediting after the fact, but one forgets these people were on budgets set by studios sometimes working with actors given to them.  If Sienna Miller was given to the producer in order to make this film I forgive him.  He deserved a better actress. Of course, then comes the matter of a rather dull script.I'm not sure what could've been done to save this one.  I do think it is almost impossible for modern actors to recreate completely authentic women and men of different times.  People of an era share certain mannerisms, ways of speaking and behavioral tics which do not translate .  When Kate Hepburn was interviewed by Cavett she explained that although they could communicate of some level they did NOT speak the same lingo because they were from different generations and she was correct.  Movies suffer from this aspect.  When you watch films (even famous films well received) depicting other eras, as time goes by, they appear almost ludicrous.  I find 'Singin in the Rain' a 50s idea of what the '20s must have been like.  I find 'Bonnie and Clyde' a good film in terms of acting but we are still presented with 1960s humans in wigs, perms and INCORRECT (sorry designers) clothing trying to evoke the 1930s!  I find 'The Great Gatsby' of 1974 an embarrassment for all involved.  Most 1970s period films and all 1980s films in general were atrocious!  What were they thinking?  My only realization has to be that the majority of viewers are ignorant, have no knowledge of previous decades and never read.",2,The Bad Actress Who is Never 'The Girl',1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,2908,"['Subtitle', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'miscast', 'Girl', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'brilliant', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'actress', 'give', 'A', 'clothing/makeup', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'criticisms', 'here', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'who', 'admitted', 'was', 'model', 'not', 'actress', 'when', 'career', 'began', 'had', 'more', 'talent', 'one', 'fingernail', 'Ms.', 'Miller', 'Miss', 'Miller', 'truly', 'wooden', 'worst', 'thing', 'actor', 'can', 'do', 'Acts', 'acting~', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'doing', 'reading', 'script', 'facial', 'features', 'are', 'dull', 'pretense', 'being', 'lady', 'time', 'miserable', 'Ms.', 'Hedren', 'modeling', 'training', 'gave', 'poise', 'grace', 'Hitch', 'wanted', 'glacial', 'humanity', 'intellect', 'charm', 'are', 'own', ""'The"", 'Birds', 'absolutely', 'believable', 'spoiled', 'socialite', 'era', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'woodenness', 'lived', 'NYC', '70s', 'knew', 'some.', ""'Marnie"", 'vulnerability', 'isolation', 'amazing', 'untrained', 'actress', 'second', 'role', 'Hitch', 'bored', 'film', 'thus', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'abrupt', 'contrived.I', 'thought', 'Hitch', 'brilliant', 'film', 'maker', 'still', 'do', 'obviously', 'had', 'character', 'flaws', 'One', 'must', 'remember', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'think', 'can', 'also', 'find', 'what', 'considered', 'classic', ""'Psycho"", 'have', 'same', 'flaws', 'contrived', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'now', 'corny', 'One', 'can', 'watch', 'films', 'think', 'reediting', 'fact', 'one', 'people', 'were', 'budgets', 'set', 'studios', 'sometimes', 'working', 'actors', 'given', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'was', 'given', 'producer', 'order', 'make', 'film', 'forgive', 'deserved', 'better', 'actress', 'course', 'then', 'matter', 'rather', 'dull', 'script.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'save', 'one', 'do', 'think', 'almost', 'impossible', 'modern', 'actors', 'recreate', 'completely', 'authentic', 'women', 'men', 'different', 'times', 'People', 'era', 'share', 'certain', 'mannerisms', 'ways', 'speaking', 'behavioral', 'tics', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'When', 'Kate', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'interviewed', 'Cavett', 'explained', 'could', 'communicate', 'level', 'did', 'NOT', 'speak', 'same', 'lingo', 'were', 'different', 'generations', 'was', 'correct', 'Movies', 'suffer', 'aspect', 'When', 'watch', 'films', 'even', 'famous', 'films', 'well', 'received', 'depicting', 'other', 'eras', 'time', 'appear', 'almost', 'ludicrous', 'find', 'Rain', '50s', 'idea', 'what', ""'20s"", 'must', 'have', 'been', 'find', ""'Bonnie"", 'Clyde', 'good', 'film', 'terms', 'acting', 'are', 'still', 'presented', '1960s', 'humans', 'wigs', 'perms', 'INCORRECT', 'sorry', 'designers', 'clothing', 'trying', 'evoke', '1930s', 'find', ""'The"", 'Great', 'Gatsby', '1974', 'embarrassment', 'involved', 'Most', '1970s', 'period', 'films', '1980s', 'films', 'general', 'were', 'atrocious', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'only', 'realization', 'be', 'majority', 'viewers', 'are', 'ignorant', 'have', 'knowledge', 'previous', 'decades', 'never', 'read']",The Girl
1618597,AU10YGO10MUCA,B00AZESO72,Gary Lee,"[13, 16]","I volunteered at Tippi Hedren's Shambala Preserve for big cats in Acton, California, for 13 years, and for a period during that time Tippi also employed me as her personal assistant.  As drama, I agree with many of the other reviewers who found THE GIRL unsatisfying.  But as someone who has known Ms. Hedren quite well, I have to view it as a documentary.Please understand that I speak here only for myself, not her.  She has no idea I am even writing this review.Tippi has been very clear in her public pronouncements about THE GIRL that it is an accurate portrayal of her relationship with Hitchcock.  She was consulted throughout, and supports the final result that HBO produced (in contrast to the film HITCHCOCK, which she has mentioned to me she finds grossly inaccurate).  She said it was critical to her that THE GIRL show that she never gave in to Hitchcock, never succumbed to his sexual advances, and she initiated the end of her contract with him.  ""He ruined my career.  He didn't ruin my life,"" she reiterates.  She is a lady who knows who she is, has never lowered her standards, and emerged from the Hitchcock debacle with her dignity intact and her head held high.  She was an unknown who had the fortitude and the morals to resist the advances of perhaps the most powerful ""director to the stars"" in Hollywood, and has gone on to lead a rich, full, productive life making a fine contribution to this world with her style and her many charitable works (Shambala is just one!).The difficult time she had with Hitchcock may have been the making of her.  When he refused to cast her in any more of his films or to release her from her contract to work for other directors (most notably, for Francois Truffaut, who wanted her for the dual role played by Julie Christie in FAHRENHEIT 451), she turned her attention from Hollywood to independent film production that eventually led her to found the nonprofit Shambala Preserve.  At Shambala, she has steadfastly rescued big cats from irresponsible owners and breeders for the past 40 years and effectively legislated for federal laws to curb animal abuse and threats to public safety.  Along the way, she has changed the lives of many who have come to Shambala, including my own.In addition to her status today as a Hollywood legend and her international reputation as an animal conservationist, Tippi is the progenitor of an acting dynasty as the mother of Melanie Griffith and grandmother of Dakota Johnson, who is now poised for major stardom after being cast in the female lead of the movie version of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.She always spoke guardedly of Hitchcock (when she spoke of him at all, which was seldom), and always generously acknowledged the contributions he made to her life and career as her mentor and acting coach.  She regularly appears at showings of THE BIRDS at film retrospectives to speak to fans.  This year in particular, for the fiftieth anniversary of the film, she has appeared at the TCM Film Festival, the Motion Picture Academy, a special anniversary showing at Grauman's Chinese Theater, and most recently, she delighted the residents of Bodega Bay, where the film was partially shot, who gave a banquet in her honor.I'm sorry Hitchcock gave her such a rough time.  I love his films, but my estimation of his ""genius"" as a director is tarnished, knowing how unable he was to appreciate the inner beauty of the gorgeous woman he wanted to make a star, but only on his own unconscionable terms.  It has been my privilege to know her and my life is inestimably richer for it.  THE GIRL can certainly be viewed as a cautionary tale for young hopefuls in Hollywood, although times have changed.  As Tippi says, if it happened today, ""I'd be a rich woman.""  But transcending the particular times and locale, it can also be seen as a depiction of the ways that power and ego can debase talent, and how goodness and character creates its own kind of power to endure and triumph.",3,What I Know as a Personal Friend,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",2013,3965,"['volunteered', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'Shambala', 'Preserve', 'big', 'cats', 'Acton', 'California', '13', 'years', 'period', 'time', 'Tippi', 'also', 'employed', 'personal', 'assistant', 'drama', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'found', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'unsatisfying', 'someone', 'who', 'known', 'Ms.', 'Hedren', 'quite', 'well', 'have', 'view', 'documentary.Please', 'understand', 'speak', 'here', 'only', 'not', 'idea', 'am', 'even', 'writing', 'review.Tippi', 'been', 'very', 'clear', 'public', 'pronouncements', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'relationship', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'consulted', 'final', 'result', 'HBO', 'produced', 'contrast', 'film', 'HITCHCOCK', 'mentioned', 'grossly', 'inaccurate', 'said', 'was', 'critical', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'show', 'never', 'gave', 'Hitchcock', 'never', 'succumbed', 'sexual', 'advances', 'initiated', 'end', 'contract', 'ruined', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'life', 'lady', 'who', 'who', 'never', 'lowered', 'standards', 'emerged', 'Hitchcock', 'debacle', 'dignity', 'intact', 'head', 'held', 'high', 'was', 'unknown', 'who', 'had', 'fortitude', 'morals', 'resist', 'advances', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'director', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'gone', 'lead', 'rich', 'full', 'productive', 'life', 'making', 'fine', 'contribution', 'world', 'style', 'many', 'charitable', 'works', 'Shambala', 'just', 'one', 'difficult', 'time', 'had', 'Hitchcock', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'making', 'When', 'refused', 'cast', 'more', 'films', 'release', 'contract', 'work', 'other', 'directors', 'most', 'notably', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'who', 'wanted', 'dual', 'role', 'played', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'FAHRENHEIT', '451', 'turned', 'attention', 'Hollywood', 'independent', 'film', 'production', 'eventually', 'led', 'found', 'nonprofit', 'Shambala', 'Preserve', 'Shambala', 'steadfastly', 'rescued', 'big', 'cats', 'irresponsible', 'owners', 'breeders', 'past', '40', 'years', 'effectively', 'legislated', 'federal', 'laws', 'curb', 'animal', 'abuse', 'threats', 'public', 'safety', 'way', 'changed', 'lives', 'many', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'Shambala', 'including', 'own.In', 'addition', 'status', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'legend', 'international', 'reputation', 'animal', 'conservationist', 'Tippi', 'progenitor', 'acting', 'dynasty', 'mother', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'grandmother', 'Dakota', 'Johnson', 'who', 'now', 'poised', 'major', 'stardom', 'being', 'cast', 'female', 'lead', 'movie', 'version', 'FIFTY', 'SHADES', 'OF', 'GREY.She', 'always', 'spoke', 'guardedly', 'Hitchcock', 'when', 'spoke', 'was', 'seldom', 'always', 'generously', 'acknowledged', 'contributions', 'made', 'life', 'career', 'mentor', 'acting', 'coach', 'regularly', 'showings', 'BIRDS', 'film', 'retrospectives', 'speak', 'fans', 'year', 'particular', 'fiftieth', 'anniversary', 'film', 'appeared', 'TCM', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'special', 'anniversary', 'showing', 'Grauman', 'Chinese', 'Theater', 'most', 'recently', 'delighted', 'residents', 'Bodega', 'Bay', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'partially', 'shot', 'who', 'gave', 'banquet', 'honor.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Hitchcock', 'gave', 'such', 'rough', 'time', 'love', 'films', 'estimation', 'genius', 'director', 'tarnished', 'knowing', 'how', 'unable', 'was', 'appreciate', 'inner', 'beauty', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'wanted', 'make', 'star', 'only', 'own', 'unconscionable', 'terms', 'been', 'privilege', 'know', 'life', 'inestimably', 'richer', 'GIRL', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'viewed', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'young', 'hopefuls', 'Hollywood', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'Tippi', 'happened', 'today', ""'d"", 'be', 'rich', 'woman', 'transcending', 'particular', 'times', 'locale', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'depiction', 'ways', 'power', 'ego', 'can', 'debase', 'talent', 'how', 'goodness', 'character', 'own', 'kind', 'power', 'endure', 'triumph']",The Girl
1618598,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00AZESO72,Grady Harp,"[12, 17]","Probably the road to making this tedious film was paved with good intentions, but despite some isolated tidbits here and there it pretty much fizzled. Apparently based on a book `Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and his Leading Ladies' by Donald Spoto as adapted for the screen by Gwyneth Hughes, the premise seems to be that Alfred Hitchcock was as much a strange personality as his movies were strangely unique. But fixating a film on the making of a single movie really doesn't do anybody justice and leaves the audience wonder `whaa.......?'1963 and Grace Kelly has had the audacity to leave Hollywood to marry a Prince, leaving Alfred Hitchcock (Toby Jones) without his favored leading lady for this newest film.  He finds an attractive blond (his predisposition for blonds becomes apparent) in the form of Tippi Hedren (Sienna Miller) to star in his horror film `The Birds'. Hitchcock's mousy wife Alma (Imelda Staunton) and his faithful secretary Peggy Robertson (Penelope Wilton) tolerate Hitchcock's behavior until Hitchcock demands a five day shoot on the scene where the birds attack Tippi and the scene brings up all manner of rather disgusting aspects of Hitchcock's personality (fact or fiction?). Obsessed with Tippi Hedren, Hitchcock pursues Hedren and makes untoward demands on her - a situation that results in their parting ways  - and contracts.Despite the Shakespearean potential of the grain of story from which this film is taken, the whole thing falls flat and remains as superficial as any Hollywood B movie (despite that it was a film made by HBO for television audiences).

1618599,A1YJ2M23KYI2X7,B00AZESO72,"Hernando DeSoto ""Hernando""","[2, 3]","This film concerns itself with Alfred Hitchcock's Romantic Obsession over Tippi Hedren, the star of the Hitchcock classic THE BIRDS. This is a much better film than HITCHCOCK, but, then again, that's not saying much.Over the years, Tippi Hedren has hinted, not always subtly, that Alfred Hitchcock had pursued her at the time he was filming THE BIRDS. She considered the subject too repugnant for her to elaborate on it. Apparently, she changed her mind after all these years for this film. These sexual allegations are somewhat supported by the fact that Tippi only made one more film for Hitch (MARNIE) before she walked out on her contract.At the time of the filming of THE BIRDS, the elderly and dignified Alfred Hitchcock had been one of Hollywood's top directors for over 20 years and had established himself as a TV star due to his hosting of his anthology series, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS.Based on this story, the affable Sir Alfred was a mean-spirited little lecherous tyrant who was hell-bent on having this girl, threatening to make her life a living hell if she did not comply, resorting to intimidation and even torture to get her to acquiesce to his sexual demands. This is an ugly story, if, in fact it is true.I do not doubt Miss Hedren's veracity. She has dedicated her life to wildlife rescue when she could have had a much easier life as a working actress. Why would she lie?But, why did she wait so long to tell her story? Did she fear retaliation? Did she prefer not to embarass Hitchcock's family and demean his reputation?It's been hinted that Hitchcock was something of a voyeur,  who liked to look but was too embarrassed by his own age and appearance, to touch. It's been rumored that Grace Kelly, who enjoyed the company of older men, would welcome Alfred into her dressing room during her fittings, even fittings for her undergarments. That's just a rumor, of course.On the other hand, Alfred Hitchcock remained devoted to his wife, Alma for all his life. Of course, some marriages, especially back then, were based on artistic partnerships and family concerns. Sexual pecadillos did not enter into the greater picture. It is interesting to note that here, as in HITCHCOCK, his daughter Patricia is not mentioned. The horrible little man depicted here is nothing like the grandfatherly, proper Englishman that you can still see on Television in reruns.So, why bother with this film at all? Well, if you are a diehard Hitchcock fan, as I am, you want to see anything that his name is associated with, even if it's bad.It's not bad, it's cringe-inducing and ugly.The best reason for seeing this movie are the performances of Toby Jones, Imelda Staunton and Sienna Miller. These actors make Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren in HITCHCOCK look as though they are appearing in a sketch for SNL.Imelda Staunton captures the plain camera-shy Alma Hitchcock in all her gentile grace.Miss Miller is lovely and memorable as a working woman locked in a struggle with a Hollywood Legend.Best of all is Toby Jones. Mr. Jones is developing a body of work good enough to be his generation's Claude Rains, i.e., character actor as Star. In INFAMOUS, Jones outdid Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote in CAPOTE. In THE GIRL, Mr. Jones puts Anthony Hopkins' performance in HITCHCOCK on the trailer. Dimiuative Toby looks perhaps a bit more like Hitchcock than Hopkins, but more importantly, he has the famous Hitchcok voice down to a shiver-inducing tee.

1618601,A106016KSI0YQ,B00AZESO72,Jay Dickson,"[0, 0]","The story of how Alfred Hitchcock became obsessed with the television commercial actress Tippi Hedren and turned her into a star of his own making, only to turn on her when she rejected his sexual advances, animated Donald Spoto's infamous biography ALFRED HITCHCOCK: THE DARK SIDE OF GENIUS, and formed the basis again for Spoto's later book SPELLBOUND BY BEAUTY. The story was such a natural to be made into a film some day that it's pretty depressing that all that came of it has been this underdeveloped ninety-minute 2012 HBO film directed by Julian Jarrold. For whatever reason, the film seems to pare down the relevant characters to as few as possible: Hitchcock (Toby Jones) and Hedren (Sienna Miller), of course; Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville (Imelda Staunton) and secretary Peggy Robertson (Penelope Wilton); Hedren's young daughter Melanie; Evan Hunter, the screenwriter for THE BIRDS; Hitchcock's assistant director, Jim Brown; Hedren's best friend; and a woman who works on Hitchcock's sets. Except for a few bird wranglers on location in the studio and in Bodega Bay, that's it. You would never guess for one minute from this movie that Rod Taylor or Jessica Tandy or Suzanne Pleshette were even in THE BIRDS, or that Diane Baker and Louise Latham also played important parts in MARNIE; except for the existence in MARNIE of Sean Connery (who is mentioned here and seen over the shoulder, but who never speaks), both films seem to be entirely one-person shows (like LOST AT SEA).The focus, then, is almost entirely on Hitchcock's obsession with Hedren, with side explorations into his mistreatment of his wife and secretary, and how they had grown to buy into his cruel treatment of his blonde starlets. The problem here is that Tippi Hedren is given almost no personality: she exists to be seen and to be obsessed over, but she's given very little credit for having anything interesting in her personality other than her stoicism (she's here merely to be a victim). Sienna Miller is very beautiful, but she does nothing vocally or with her performance to evoke Tippi Hedren herself: there's no nasal Minnesota accent, nor anything of the inner complexity beneath the marble veneer that continues to make Hedren's performances so fascinating. Toby Jones fares much better as Alfred Hitchcock, and conveys both the self-loathing and the ability to escape into his own fantasies. The best scene is near the end, when Hitchcock wanders the long windowless hallways of a Universal Pictures studio building, seemingly lost in the dark labyrinth of his own mind.",3,Malignant obsession,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,2570,"['story', 'how', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'became', 'obsessed', 'television', 'commercial', 'actress', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'turned', 'star', 'own', 'making', 'only', 'turn', 'when', 'rejected', 'sexual', 'advances', 'animated', 'Donald', 'Spoto', 'infamous', 'biography', 'ALFRED', 'HITCHCOCK', 'DARK', 'SIDE', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'formed', 'basis', 'again', 'Spoto', 'later', 'book', 'SPELLBOUND', 'BY', 'BEAUTY', 'story', 'was', 'natural', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'day', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'came', 'been', 'underdeveloped', 'ninety-minute', '2012', 'HBO', 'film', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Jarrold', 'reason', 'film', 'pare', 'down', 'relevant', 'characters', 'as', 'few', 'possible', 'Hitchcock', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'Hedren', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'course', 'Hitchcock', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Reville', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'secretary', 'Peggy', 'Robertson', 'Penelope', 'Wilton', 'Hedren', 'young', 'daughter', 'Melanie', 'Evan', 'Hunter', 'screenwriter', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'Hitchcock', 'assistant', 'director', 'Jim', 'Brown', 'Hedren', 'best', 'friend', 'woman', 'who', 'Hitchcock', 'sets', 'few', 'bird', 'wranglers', 'location', 'studio', 'Bodega', 'Bay', 'would', 'never', 'guess', 'one', 'minute', 'movie', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Suzanne', 'Pleshette', 'were', 'even', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Louise', 'Latham', 'also', 'played', 'important', 'parts', 'MARNIE', 'existence', 'MARNIE', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'who', 'mentioned', 'here', 'seen', 'shoulder', 'who', 'never', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'entirely', 'one-person', 'shows', 'LOST', 'AT', 'SEA', '.The', 'focus', 'then', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Hitchcock', 'obsession', 'Hedren', 'side', 'explorations', 'mistreatment', 'wife', 'secretary', 'how', 'had', 'grown', 'buy', 'cruel', 'treatment', 'blonde', 'starlets', 'problem', 'here', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'given', 'almost', 'personality', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'obsessed', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'credit', 'having', 'anything', 'interesting', 'personality', 'other', 'stoicism', 'here', 'merely', 'be', 'victim', 'Sienna', 'Miller', 'very', 'beautiful', 'nothing', 'vocally', 'performance', 'evoke', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'nasal', 'Minnesota', 'accent', 'anything', 'inner', 'complexity', 'marble', 'veneer', 'make', 'Hedren', 'performances', 'so', 'fascinating', 'Toby', 'Jones', 'fares', 'much', 'better', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'conveys', 'self-loathing', 'ability', 'escape', 'own', 'fantasies', 'best', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'Hitchcock', 'long', 'windowless', 'hallways', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'studio', 'building', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'dark', 'labyrinth', 'own', 'mind']",The Girl

1618603,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00AZESO72,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[14, 20]","As a lover of movies, it's hard to deny the impact that Alfred Hitchcock had on the history of film.  I was really excited to check out the HBO presentation of ""The Girl"" despite its somewhat incendiary subject matter.  Telling of Hitchcock's obsession with Tippi Hedron, the film promised an unvarnished peek behind the genius.  Hedron was picked from relative obscurity to play the leads in both ""The Birds"" and ""Marnie"" because, as we all know, Hitch had a thing for chilly blondes!  I've certainly heard my fair share of stories about both Hitchcock and this relationship, in particular, through the years--so I had a good idea of what to expect from ""The Girl"" as it is presented from Hedron's vantage point.  I'm sure that the great director had his share of idiosyncrasies and was no saint, but the grimly lascivious centerpiece of this story paints a pretty harrowing portrait of an icon.  I don't even particularly mind that this is a negative portrayal of Hitchcock, I'm open to that interpretation from an intellectual standpoint.  To my mind, the film's fatal flaw is that it's painfully dull in addition to being one-sided.While the big screen ""Hitchcock"" could be accused of being too glib and superficial, ""The Girl"" lacks almost any sign of life.  On the plus side, Toby Jones is absolutely terrific as Hitchcock nailing his mannerisms and vocal patterns.  I also loved Imelda Staunton as the woman behind the man.  The dynamic in the Hitchcock marriage has always been a fascinating story, so I enjoyed seeing these two play off one another.  Sienna Miller plays Tippi Hedron.  Hedron never had much of a career after Hitchcock discovered her, a fact that she completely blames on him.  Truthfully, though, she always came across as somewhat vacant (which she also blames on Hitch) and it is this lack of an interesting center that completely derails ""The Girl.""  Miller has the aloof quality, but I was never convinced of why people were so enamored of her.  The characterization, as presented here, lacked impact.  And as I didn't care about Hedron, the movie became somewhat of a chore.Very briefly, ""The Girl"" tells how Hitchcock discovered Hedron, made her famous, victimized her with birds, and then sexually pursued her.  It is highlighted with many uncomfortable moments, but not much depth.  As Hedron struggles to break from his evil bonds, it is a process of empowerment.  Again, though, I never cared.  Here's my main criticism.  I'm willing to accept absolutely everything at face value about Hitchcock.  But with this subject matter, ""The Girl"" should be absolutely riveting human drama.  Its narrative is so choppy and its characterizations are so thin, there is little to grab onto.  The film got respectable notices with Golden Globe nods for both Jones (well deserved) and Miller.  I just couldn't understand why a film so filled with juicy material could feel so lifeless.

1618606,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B00AZESO72,MacheteJason,"[0, 1]","This is based on a true story. Tippi Hedren, star of Hitchcock's The Birds and Marnie, rocked the world with new allegations that she was sexually harassed by Alfred Hitchcock. This didn't enter the public consciousness until 2012 but Hitchcock was always known as an auteur who pushed his cast and crew to get the most out of them. Overall, the film is fairly average and the bonus supplements are light (the brief interview with Hedren is interesting).Naturally I was interested in the dramatic portrayal of these allegations to decide for myself how much validity there was to them. Unfortunately, the film itself doesn't capture much of the emotional intensity you might expect since Hedren declared Hitchcock destroyed her career. I have also read The Making of the Birds which addresses the other side of the story (being much more sympathetic to Hitchcock). As a result I don't know what to think but I believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle. The Girl looks and feels like a TV movie (which it was) so it is limited in the reaction it can get from the audience. The scenes which were supposed to come across as shocking and dramatic seem to fall flat. For example, real birds were used to attack Hedren in one scene where she explores the attic. It does not come across as particularly horrifying or scary in this film. I feel that is a weakness of the production values and not necessarily the script.Ultimately the reader will have to decide for themselves the truth of the allegations although watching this film won't end the debate about the real relationship between Hitchcock and Hedren.",3,The Girl Looks at Hitchcock and Hedren,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",2013,1609,"['based', 'true', 'story', 'Tippi', 'Hedren', 'star', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds', 'Marnie', 'rocked', 'world', 'new', 'allegations', 'was', 'sexually', 'harassed', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'did', ""n't"", 'enter', 'public', 'consciousness', '2012', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'always', 'known', 'auteur', 'who', 'pushed', 'cast', 'crew', 'get', 'most', 'Overall', 'film', 'fairly', 'average', 'bonus', 'supplements', 'are', 'light', 'brief', 'interview', 'Hedren', 'interesting', '.Naturally', 'was', 'interested', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'allegations', 'decide', 'how', 'much', 'validity', 'there', 'was', 'Unfortunately', 'film', ""n't"", 'capture', 'much', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'might', 'expect', 'Hedren', 'declared', 'Hitchcock', 'destroyed', 'career', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'Making', 'Birds', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Hitchcock', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'believe', 'truth', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Girl', 'feels', 'TV', 'movie', 'was', 'limited', 'reaction', 'can', 'get', 'audience', 'scenes', 'were', 'supposed', 'come', 'shocking', 'dramatic', 'seem', 'fall', 'flat', 'example', 'real', 'birds', 'were', 'used', 'attack', 'Hedren', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'attic', 'not', 'come', 'particularly', 'horrifying', 'scary', 'film', 'feel', 'weakness', 'production', 'values', 'not', 'necessarily', 'script.Ultimately', 'reader', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'truth', 'allegations', 'watching', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'end', 'debate', 'real', 'relationship', 'Hitchcock', 'Hedren']",The Girl
1618607,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00AZESO72,M. Oleson,"[3, 4]","In 2012 audiences were hit by two dramatic biographies about famed director Alfred Hitchcock.  ""Hitchcock"" hit theaters late in the year and focused primarily on the difficulty Hitchcock had getting ""Psycho"" made.  While the film dances around possible dalliances with his blonde leading lady, Janet Leigh in that film or any before, no punches are pulled in ""The Girl.""Hitchcock's next movie after ""Psycho"" was ""The Birds"" in 1963 followed quickly by ""Marnie"" in 1964.  Both films featured Hitchcock's next blonde ""find,"" Tippi Hedren.  While there may be some controversy about the events, the HBO film was written by Gwyneth Hughes and is based on Donald Spoto's book, ""Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and his Leading Ladies.""  The now 80-something Hedren has evidently authenticated much of the story.Hitchcock is played by Toby Jones and does a much better Hitch than Anthony Hopkins did in the commercial film.  Hedren is played by Sienna Miller, the single mother of a daughter, Melanie (actress Melanie Griffith).  A successful model, Tippi was identified by Hitchcock's wife and frequent consultant, Alma (Imelda Staunton).  Neither Hitchcock nor Hedren got what they expected.The film focuses on the shooting of ""The Birds.""  A grueling film to be made by all accounts.  There were weather issues not to mention dealing with the bird actors and various unanimated versions.  Hitchcock's familiarity with his leading ladies would seem to be undeniable but in one scene in this film, he becomes profane and attempts to rape Hedren in his limo.  She's able to fend him off, but Hitchcock takes revenge for the rest of the shoot, including the famous scene in the attic when the birds attack Hedren's character.  He does over 40 re-takes which causes Hedren to enter a hospital for exhaustion and other injuries.Hedren for her part, doesn't give in and quit which she was encouraged to do.  Certainly the director Julian Jarrold and the filmmakers paint a one-sided portrait of Hitchcock's perversion.  There is one scene in the picture that perhaps says it best.  Hitchcock, drunk, is driven home by the assistant director Jim Brown (Carl Beukes).  He suggests to the handsome Brown that he could get Hedren in the sack if he wanted.  Brown, married, demurs.

Both main actors work very hard at making sense of their roles, but the story has been written with such a difficult bias -- meaning it attempts to render Ms. Hedren's dubious version of events with conviction -- that these gifted actors are given characters to play that don't make sense.  I guess I believe that part of the suspension of disbelief that movies require from audiences comes from the development of characters that resonate with psychological authenticity.  In this case, it feels like Ms. Hedren's tale is so full of self-protection and delusional thinking that even her own character fails to make sense, and Hitchcock's behavior seems wildly exaggerated by her vivid agenda.  The overall experience, by the time the film is over, is somewhat distasteful and a little bit shameful, like the slow realization that one has had too much to drink, and that the amusing fun that was had, trashing an acquaintance's reputation, has gone too far.",1,Such an odd film,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1048,"['had', 'unusually', 'negative', 'response', 'film', ""'ll"", 'do', 'best', 'articulate', 'why', 'main', 'actors', 'work', 'very', 'hard', 'making', 'sense', 'roles', 'story', 'been', 'written', 'difficult', 'bias', 'meaning', 'render', 'Ms.', 'Hedren', 'dubious', 'version', 'events', 'conviction', 'gifted', 'actors', 'are', 'given', 'characters', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'guess', 'believe', 'part', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'movies', 'require', 'audiences', 'development', 'characters', 'resonate', 'psychological', 'authenticity', 'case', 'Ms.', 'Hedren', 'tale', 'so', 'full', 'self-protection', 'delusional', 'thinking', 'even', 'own', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'Hitchcock', 'behavior', 'wildly', 'exaggerated', 'vivid', 'agenda', 'overall', 'experience', 'time', 'film', 'somewhat', 'distasteful', 'little', 'bit', 'shameful', 'slow', 'realization', 'one', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'drink', 'amusing', 'fun', 'was', 'had', 'trashing', 'acquaintance', 'reputation', 'gone', 'too', 'far']",The Girl

My guess is she was not the only one of his leading ladies whom he subjected to sexual abuse and harassment.  Tippi Hedren is a great actress whose career was unjustly cut short because of her unwillingness to cater to Hitchcock, and I also think a lot of her because of the wonderful work she did with Shambala and caring for the big cats. She is and was no doubt a strong and determined woman, and that comes across in the film.  What the film fails to develop for the viewer, though, is why she put up with as much as she did for as long as she did.  It just doesn't seem to fit her character, and I am left feeling like something is missing, but I'm not sure what. The other problem with the film is that even though Hitchcock is as abusive as he is toward Tippi Hedren, the only character I ended up feeling truly sorry for was Hitchcock's quietly suffering wife, Alma.  I don't know what it is about this film that makes it difficult to feel as sorry for Tippi Hedren.  I feel like there is a lot more to this story than what the film showed, and would like to know the rest.

This 90 minute HBO television movie did not, I believe, receive theatrical showing in the United States, though it did in the United Kingdom.  It is not to be confused with another Hitchcock picture,Hitchcockreleased in the same year, which did achieve theatrical distribution in the States, with much bigger stars: Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren and Scarlett Johansson.In THE GIRL, with its all- British casting, Sienna Miller and Toby Jones star.  It gives us a disturbing depiction of the turbulent relationship between the iconic Anglo-American film director Alfred Hitchcock and the leading lady  for whom he'd developed feelings we'd have to call inappropriate: Tippi Hedren, another of the  frosty blondes the director loved so well, as he cast her inThe BirdsandMarnie.It was 1962, and Grace Kelly, the director's perfect frosty blonde, had left his employ to take up a role starring on the wider world stage, as princess of Monaco.  Hitchcock, who was known for his twisting psychological thrillers, was at the height of his fame and creativity.  He needed a new blonde.  His wife Alma recommended Hedren, an unknown model she'd seen in a TV commercial. But as the director played Pygmalion, sculpting  the beautiful Hedren into the perfect Hitchcock blonde of his imagination, he became obsessed with her sexually.  She wanted fame and fortune; he wanted her.  During the filming of THE BIRDS, the former model spent five days being attacked by real, live, vicious birds.  Both the director's and the newly-minted actress's careers were damaged, hers more than his, to be sure, in the struggle. For the show business biography/drama, screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes interviewed Hedren, and surviving members of Hitchcock s crew to tell their full unhappy story for the first time.Julian Jarrold (Appropriate Adult Part 1) directed.  The cast does well. The leads, Jones (Titanic,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), and the beauteous Miller (Layer Cake,Alfie), carry their weight.  They are ably supported by Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake) as Alma Reville Hitchcock,  and Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2 Limited Edition Set - Original UK Version, THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL), as Hitchcock's assistant Peggy Robertson. No complaints about photography and the film is quick-moving enough.  But it's undeniably a downer.

As a similarly-timed companion piece that dealt with the process and conflicts within Hitchcock's films from the early-mid 1960s, The Girl focuses on Hitchcock's secretly erotic obsession with newcomer actress Tippi Hedren who starred in The Birds and Marnie.The film takes a rather dramatic and more subtle, eerie tone than the sometimes over-the-top, melodramatic, and darkly humourous Hitchcock film from 2012. Toby Jones and Sienna Miller play well-done and rather convincing roles but the film's take on the idea is controversial and quite unsettling enough to where it is a little difficult to make a quick-call judgment on the film alone.Nonetheless, The Girl manages to provoke two sides of the argument by leaving to ambiguity toward the end of what goes on but things do take a disturbing turn when Hitchcock is willing to see Hedren injured badly from oncoming birds or being sexually coerced by her husband in Marnie. Comparing the two films are quite different in tone and perspective but this film is, without regret, a little tiresome and one-note here than the more varied and delightful other. This is especially the case where Hitchcock's wife, Alma Reville, is shown as being subservient and quiet-minded here which makes the film lose a lot of the film's already gone female appeal.At best, you're at best to read about Hitchcock's time with the two films by research or reading articles online about his behaviour.
