763657,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B0000AK80C,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[2, 2]","It was after being exposed to such films as 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Spirited Away' that I went to a local retailer for what I hoped would be more of the same.  This was several years ago, but then, as now, the selection of Anime feature films that are not lifted directly from a television series are few and far between, which is unfortunate, since this genre offers a unique method of storytelling which could be awkward and unappealing, if not impossible, in a live action effort.  Unfortunate too are the chances that any full length independent feature, at least what is offered to Western viewers, will tread on similar ground as those that have come before.Thankfully, then, we have such films as 'Millenium Actress' and a few others which do not slip neatly into the commonly perceived boundries of this genre, and, to me, hold their own against any other type of film.  At heart a dual story of unrequited and unrealized love, I felt it rose above even that catagorization to touch on some deeper, more subtle themes, and in a manner reminiscent of classical literature coupled with complex technique and plain old fashioned movie fun.The fabled Genei Studios (a stand in for Toho Studios) is in the process of being torn down.  A documentarian, Genya, and his cameraman, Kyoji, track down the face of Genei Studios, the legendary actress Chiyoko Fujiwara, who has lived in seclusion several years after making her last film.  Now in her 70's, the still elegant Chiyoko has granted Genya an interview in return for a memento he has brought her from her studio days.As Chiyoko tells the story of her life for the documentary, a curious blend of fact and fantasy and memory begins.  At first, it has all the trappings of a normal flashback, except to the surprise of Genya and his cameraman, the power of the memory is so strong that it incorporates them into the story as well, and, initially at least, they are passive observers to events 60 years old.  Here they watch as Chiyoko, a pre-adolescent girl during the years before WWII, meets and then assists and then falls in love with an anti-government agitator - a painter, wounded, and on the run from the authorities.  Although she tries to help, the police close in and the painter is forced to flee.At this point, Chiyoko's memory merges into film history - excerpts from her earliest film role, as explained by Genya to his cameraman while they watch, parallel her life's events.  Obsessed with her painter, Chiyoko begins her career as an actress simply as a way to chase after him, first to Manchuria, and then skipping across the country, always a step behind.  Interspersed with her history are scenes from films (always with Genya and Kyoji tagging along), which also feature a heroine in search of her love.  Genya takes a more and more active role in her memories and in the film excerpts, and slowly it becomes apparent that Genya has been chasing Chiyoko almost as long as she had been chasing her painter.Some viewers may find 'Millenium Actress' confusing at first - I did.  Like most anime films, there is not a lot of explanation prior to engulfing the audience in its own quirky universe.  Real world events blend into personal history which in turns fades into popular film that is then hijacked by the kind-hearted Genya as he tries to help his actress in any way that he can.  He and his cameraman ricochet (often comically so) from Kurosawa type samurai films to Godzilla to dynastic period films as they follow Chiyoko as she in turn trails after her painter to the very limits of imagination.  What catapults this film out of the strictly romantic and into another far subtler realm of human obsession are the last words of the film, spoken as Chiyoko begins her final journey.This effort was in part a Dreamworks production, though what degree of infuence they may have had is difficult to know.  The film has a thorough authentic feel to it, and in the extra 'making-of' segment, it's apparent that all the principal players were Japanese.  Some may not appreciate the lack of an English sound track, but I do not feel that this detracted from the movie at all.Aside from the storyline, the animation in this effort far exceeds the director's previous film 'Perfect Blue' (In my opinion, everything about 'Millenium Actress' exceeds 'Perfect Blue').  The only drawback that I noticed was the music, which I felt was to cloying, and that it interfered more than helped.Very enjoyable, though, and highly recommended to fans of all film.",5,A Fantasy of Film and Dreams,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,4524,"['was', 'being', 'exposed', 'such', 'films', ""'Princess"", 'Mononoke', ""'Spirited"", 'Away', 'went', 'local', 'retailer', 'what', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'was', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'now', 'selection', 'Anime', 'feature', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'lifted', 'directly', 'television', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'unfortunate', 'genre', 'unique', 'method', 'storytelling', 'could', 'be', 'awkward', 'unappealing', 'not', 'impossible', 'live', 'action', 'effort', 'Unfortunate', 'too', 'are', 'chances', 'full', 'length', 'independent', 'feature', 'least', 'what', 'offered', 'Western', 'viewers', 'will', 'tread', 'similar', 'ground', 'have', 'come', 'before.Thankfully', 'then', 'have', 'such', 'films', ""'Millenium"", 'Actress', 'few', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'slip', 'neatly', 'commonly', 'perceived', 'boundries', 'genre', 'hold', 'own', 'other', 'type', 'film', 'heart', 'dual', 'story', 'unrequited', 'unrealized', 'love', 'felt', 'rose', 'even', 'catagorization', 'touch', 'deeper', 'more', 'subtle', 'themes', 'manner', 'reminiscent', 'classical', 'literature', 'coupled', 'complex', 'technique', 'plain', 'old', 'fashioned', 'movie', 'fun.The', 'fabled', 'Genei', 'Studios', 'stand', 'Toho', 'Studios', 'process', 'being', 'torn', 'down', 'documentarian', 'Genya', 'cameraman', 'Kyoji', 'track', 'down', 'face', 'Genei', 'Studios', 'legendary', 'actress', 'Chiyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'who', 'lived', 'seclusion', 'several', 'years', 'making', 'last', 'film', 'Now', '70', 'still', 'elegant', 'Chiyoko', 'granted', 'Genya', 'interview', 'return', 'memento', 'brought', 'studio', 'days.As', 'Chiyoko', 'story', 'life', 'documentary', 'curious', 'blend', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'memory', 'begins', 'first', 'trappings', 'normal', 'flashback', 'surprise', 'Genya', 'cameraman', 'power', 'memory', 'so', 'strong', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'initially', 'least', 'are', 'passive', 'observers', 'events', '60', 'years', 'old', 'Here', 'watch', 'Chiyoko', 'pre-adolescent', 'girl', 'years', 'WWII', 'meets', 'then', 'assists', 'then', 'love', 'anti-government', 'agitator', 'painter', 'wounded', 'run', 'authorities', 'help', 'police', 'close', 'painter', 'forced', 'flee.At', 'point', 'Chiyoko', 'memory', 'merges', 'film', 'history', 'excerpts', 'earliest', 'film', 'role', 'explained', 'Genya', 'cameraman', 'watch', 'parallel', 'life', 'events', 'Obsessed', 'painter', 'Chiyoko', 'career', 'actress', 'simply', 'way', 'chase', 'first', 'Manchuria', 'then', 'skipping', 'country', 'always', 'step', 'Interspersed', 'history', 'are', 'scenes', 'films', 'always', 'Genya', 'Kyoji', 'tagging', 'along', 'also', 'feature', 'heroine', 'search', 'love', 'Genya', 'more', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'memories', 'film', 'excerpts', 'slowly', 'apparent', 'Genya', 'been', 'chasing', 'Chiyoko', 'almost', 'as', 'long', 'had', 'been', 'chasing', 'painter.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', ""'Millenium"", 'Actress', 'confusing', 'first', 'did', 'most', 'anime', 'films', 'not', 'lot', 'explanation', 'prior', 'engulfing', 'audience', 'own', 'quirky', 'universe', 'Real', 'world', 'events', 'blend', 'personal', 'history', 'turns', 'fades', 'popular', 'film', 'then', 'hijacked', 'kind-hearted', 'Genya', 'help', 'actress', 'way', 'can', 'cameraman', 'ricochet', 'often', 'comically', 'so', 'Kurosawa', 'type', 'samurai', 'films', 'Godzilla', 'dynastic', 'period', 'films', 'follow', 'Chiyoko', 'turn', 'trails', 'painter', 'very', 'limits', 'imagination', 'What', 'catapults', 'film', 'strictly', 'romantic', 'far', 'subtler', 'realm', 'human', 'obsession', 'are', 'last', 'words', 'film', 'spoken', 'Chiyoko', 'final', 'journey.This', 'effort', 'was', 'part', 'Dreamworks', 'production', 'what', 'degree', 'infuence', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'difficult', 'know', 'film', 'thorough', 'authentic', 'feel', 'extra', ""'making-of"", 'segment', 'apparent', 'principal', 'players', 'were', 'Japanese', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'lack', 'English', 'sound', 'track', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'detracted', 'movie', 'all.Aside', 'storyline', 'animation', 'effort', 'far', 'director', 'previous', 'film', 'Blue', 'opinion', 'everything', ""'Millenium"", 'Actress', 'exceeds', ""'Perfect"", 'Blue', 'only', 'drawback', 'noticed', 'was', 'music', 'felt', 'was', 'cloying', 'interfered', 'more', 'helped.Very', 'enjoyable', 'though', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'film']",Millennium Actress

My wife found it annoying, due to a tendency in Japanese films for what people of northern European descent would consider overacting/overemotionalism. The Russian Jewish film buff and I found it both fascinating and touching.So--which response would you have? I'll try to help.1. The film's structure is complex, and is constructed rather the way a classical symphony is constructed. It's a narrative, but one that loops back in on itself, revisiting leitmotifs throughout, and ending in a way that, say, a Mahler or Brahms fan would find very satisfying. However, someone who wants straight ahead storytelling, with a clear sense of what is actually happening at any given moment, may get lost here and there. I didn't, but I'm a serious film buff. Few filmmaking tricks surprise me any more. This did.If you liked ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Being John Malkovich"" or Carlos Saura's ""Carmen"" those might be clues to you liking. However, my wife like two of these a lot and didn't like ""Millenium Actress.""The real clincher would be if you've seen a bunch of Japanese movies made in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s--because, paralleling the story of the central characters is a loving homage to both Japan's history and to that golden era of Japanese films, whose tropes and styles appear in this, somewhat ""Zelig"" style.My wife thought it jumped around in Japanese history, but it's more accurate to say that it jumped around the different genres of Japanese filmmaking in the postwar era--the samurai films (divided into a bunch of subcategories), realistic modern films, and sci fi, from domestic dramas to war films.A lot of the time what's happening onscreen seems to shimmer magically between the characters' own stories and the stories of the films they're talking/thinking about.2. Another aspect is that the central personal theme is unrequited love, which is the romanticism of a young teenager--so if you find ""Romeo and Juliet"" and all those films young teenage girls swoon at nothing but annoying, that might be a counter-indicator for this film.It's important to add that this film's PG rating might mislead you into thinking kids could see it. But it's only subtitled--not dubbed--and I think its complex musical structuring and the need for you to know something about Japanese history and film history would cut out many young teens who might love wonderful Japanese animes like ""Spirited Away.""3. By ""knowing something about Japanese history"" I mean it helps a lot to recognize from people's makeup and costumes whether you're seeing, say, Heian era or Tokugawa era or Meiji era costume drama. Maybe that's not absolutely required, but I think that's part of why my Indian engineer friend thought it was a stupid jumble of stuff.So here's the trick: emotionally, at its core this film is no more complex than ""Bolt,"" the delightful American animated 3D feature my wife and I saw and loved last year. But cinematically this film is up there with some really sophisticated films. So if you just look at the character and quests of the central characters you might dismiss this as a kids' film only.From my point of view I figure we were all kids once, so I'm OK with seeing something from that simpler perspective as long as there are other things to keep my mind engaged. This did so fully, and I'm very glad I saw it.But if you haven't seen ""Rashomon,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" and a bunch of other Japanese Golden Era classics--the kind that get put out under the Criterion imprint--maybe you should see those first. You'll appreciate this more if you do.I only had one real gripe about the film, but I'm probably wrong about this. In a scene on the Moon, the heroine moves around as if she's moving in Earth gravity, instead of that skippy hoppy thing real astronauts on the Moon do. OTOH in Japanese live-action sci-fi films I'm sure they moved just the way the heroine did. That's why my gripe is probably wrong, since it's not about landing on the moon--it's about movies about landing on the moon.My Russian Jewish friend doesn't know but a tiny fraction of what I know about Japanese history and cinema, yet she enjoyed it. Therefore the caution I just expressed about needing to know Japanese history and cinema may not be necessary. Maybe what's in the film is enough to guide you. I am sure that the more you know about Japanese history and cinema the more you'll enjoy this, though.I'm fine with Euro-restrained cinema too. See my review of ""Let the Right One In"" for an example. But though I'm no fan of unrequited love, and some of my favorite actresses are Helen Mirren and Judy Densch, neither of whom ever act like Chiyoko in this film, I still enjoyed this thoroughly.BTW the main character reminded me slightly of Ingrid Bergman--think Casablanca. That, too, is about unrequited love in ways strongly reminiscent of this film, though visually there's very little connections. From Japanese films of the 50s this made me think of Machiko Kyo, though she could express an earthiness we never see in Chiyoko. Besides Bergman I also thought of Greer Garson and Shirley Jones and other ""good girl"" heroines of our own cinematic golden age (even when they played prostitutes!).One other note--the streets and vehicles and clothing styles of every era shown are all accurate and detailed. The filmmaker did his homework.Lastly, I've seen another animated film by Satoshi Kon, ""Tokyo Godfathers,"" which you might want to see first. It's set squarely in contemporary Tokyo, is emotionally rich and complex, but told in a pretty straightforward narrative form. I really liked this film as interesting cinema but also as powerfully engaging emotionally--somewhat more than ""Millenium Actress,"" though I was moved by the latter.See my Amazon page if you want to

763667,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B0000AK80C,elfdart,"[0, 0]","i've heard of this movie and seen it on and off for several years, but the clips i'd seen and the description turned me off so i didn't watch it, though i'd heard good things about it. after seeing it however, i don't know why i waited so long! the movie is about two guys who want to interview a famous actress for the documentary they're doing on her life, and the movies she was in are used to tell the story of her love for a man she doesn't really know. this sounded extremely boring to me, and the pacing of the movie isn't fast and exciting, but more of a slower building up to the climax, so if one were to fast forward through to see segments of various scenes... well it just looked boring. but, the movie is actually really good.first of all, the art is amazing. a lot of attention paid to detail and it's a pleasure to watch purely from an artistic perspective.so the story is about two guys who interview a famous actress about her life, and she tells this story through movies she's been in. basically when she was young she met a wounded rebel in the streets and hides him from the police for a night. when she goes to see him in the morning he's gone but he left a picture of her that he drew saying something like 'until next time'. so she sort of falls for this man and then obsesses over him for the rest of her life. she gets an offer to be an actress and accepts because the job she was offered took her to where the guys escaped to. so we find out that her success as an actress stems from her desire to find this guy. and this sounds superficial and weak as a motivation to do something with your life, kind of playing off the stereotype that a woman needs a man to complete herself, which is why i like this movie so much. when a typical north amercian thinks of japanese culture, or for some people asian culture in general, they think of the stereotypes of weak- willed, submissive women because of how the media portrays them and such, but this movie subtly twists that stereotype on its head. the girl spends her entire life chasing after this guy and many parts in the movie you wonder why she doesn't just give up on the guy and live her life for herself. at the end of the movie though ... i guess spoiler alert but if i'd known this sooner i'd have watched it sooner... she tells the interviewer that it didn't matter to her if she ever actually caught up with the guy, in fact if she did catch him she would probably get bored of him because it was the chasing that she lived for. and this is like anything in life, if you chase a man o a job or even an ideology of some kind, the journey is the important thing, meaning that she is living for herself. and that made the movie for me. it twisted the stereotype of japanese women western people have. so i liked it.",5,great,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",2009,2797,"['i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'movie', 'seen', 'several', 'years', 'clips', 'i',

They track her down and begin the interview.  What follows is not just the story of Chiyoko's desire to become an actress against the wishes of her family and her search for a mysterious stranger who gave her a key, but also an unusual history of Japanese cinema from pre-WWII and historical films to Godzilla and space adventures.

763673,A3OPF6DIU65CS6,B0000AK80C,Greg Goebel,"[0, 0]","I'm always a little amused at the way many anime fans pass out a five-star rating to almost everything they watch. As far as I'm concerned, an anime that is competently put together and entertaining gets three stars, with four stars reserved for something that's definitely superior. As far as five stars go, if I handed that out to everything, what would I have left to give to something as magnificent as Satoshi Kon's MILLENNIUM ACTRESS?MILLENNIUM ACTRESS starts in the present day, with Genya Tachibana, a long-time movie studio worker nearing retirement, and his young assistant going to interview Chiyoko Fujisawa, thirty years' earlier one of Japan's greatest movie stars but since that time a quiet recluse. They find a delicate, frail, and lovely old woman -- reminding me much of an aunt of mine who was beautiful to the day she died. Genya, who turns out to be her biggest fan, worshipping the ground she walks on, and his assistant then literally take a &#34;trip down memory lane&#34; with her to review her life and career.However, that story is not merely presented as a cinematic fairy tale but as a composite of cinematic fairy tales, something of a homage to the history of Japanese cinema, which in turn acts as a filter for a thousand years of Japenese history. If that sounds confusing, sorry, I don't dare say any more because it would give away too much of the highly imaginative script of this film.Not only is the scriptwork brilliantly imaginative and outstanding everything else is as well. The artwork is not merely technically meticulous, it is also ingenious and stylish. In a &#34;the making of&#34; documentary with this film, the director suggests stopping the DVD every now and then just to take in the backgrounds and the details. The soundtrack work by Susumu Hirasawa is also outstanding, something of a mix of atmospheric movie score and new age with a Japanese flavor, and it works absolutely perfectly.Another thing about most anime fans is that they seem to be suckers for sentimentality. I tend to find it annoying and will get irritated enough at TV melodramas with tiresomely overblown dialogue to turn them off in disgust. However, I was unable to resist MILLENNIUM ACTRESS from the instant it started. There was no way I could hold out against combination of classic cinematic moments, originality, and humor (mostly provided by Genya's assistant with his slacker observations), illuminated with almost hallucinogenic color and light. It is always interesting to find that the Japanese, stereotyped as buttoned-down and reserved, have such a streak of wild passion, and maybe a bit unsettling to find myself carried along on that emotional roller-coaster ride. I could barely sleep after watching this movie and going to bed.The number of anime films released each year that can really be regarded as worth five stars can be counted on the fingers of one hand, with fingers left over. This is one of those films. Somebody who lacks imagination might have some troubles with the story line (is it live or is it Memorex? -- the answer is YES) and find it confusing.

763676,A3PJQ4742VN84H,B0000AK80C,"Hope this helps ""help""","[1, 1]","And I do not use that comparison lightly.  Just as  ""Inceptions"" was a trip through reality, so is this film...but much more romantic.  But don't let the ""romance"" fool you...FOR PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED PEOPLE:There is nothing to fear.  The film is very engaging and immersive...but doing all that without having to stoop to using provocative material, fan service, nor coarse language.  This is not a film for children, though, because it's a very mature and complicated film.MOVING ON:This is the first animated art film to truly draw me in.  I will tell you, this film is a real trip.  So what exactly is this film?  It's a documentary, biography, Godzilla, mystery, drama, stage play, samurai flick, sci-fi...yes...it's that hard to explain.  One thing that can be said for sure is that this is a wonderful psychological romance that will really test your mind...think ""Inception"" but ten times more trippy.  It is also a story about love and identity...and the chase (which you can discover the meaning of if you watch).  The plot is fairly simple...but the execution is very very artistic, engaging, and complexed.  I can't describe it, it's just something to experience.  And your emotions will fly at times.  What I will say, pay attention to the dialogue, it's very purposed.  Also pay attention to repetitions, they are clues.  The 3 main characters (Chiyoko, the Interviewer, and the Cameraman) are also very charming, but more importantly they serve as anchors to each other - and in some cases a mirror.  Also, you get to see the growth and development of people over time in a very unique way...as well as this strange phenomena of choice and retrospect.  Simply put, I can't stress how beautiful this film really is.  And it will take much more than one viewing to even begin to grasp a small portion of it.  The ending is epic btw.Just to let you know, the film is Japanese dubbed with English subtitles.  This is one of the few times that I will say with definite affirmation that this was a wise choice.  Though i'm no purist, I do think in this case a dub would have lost something...not because it would have been bad...but because there's a magical and surreal aspect that the Japanese helps to bring in this film.SPECIAL FEATURES:Well there isn't really any special features except for  a ""making of..."" feature which is an interview/commentary by Satoshi Kon.ALL IN ALL:This film will twist your mind in so many fun and meaningful ways.  It's beautifully pieced together and lovingly crafted.  It is both uplifting, yet sad.  It is so simple and yet so complexed.  You'll need multiple watches...but each watch reveals a new layer of depth and meaning.  All in all, it is a treasured part of my collection.  This is not a film for children.  It is far too complexed and many of the themes will just fly over their heads on top of the complexity.  One cannot watch this passively...but, if you are willing to focus, it can be a rewarding experience.  This film may be difficult for some to follow, but then again...the chase can be quite fun.",5,"Before Inception, There as Millennium Actress...",1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,3068,"['do', 'not', 'use', 'comparison', 'lightly', 'Just', 'Inceptions', 'was', 'trip', 'reality', 'so', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'romantic', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'romance', 'fool', 'PARENTS', 'AND', 'OTHER', 'CONCERNED', 'PEOPLE', 'nothing', 'fear', 'film', 'very', 'engaging', 'immersive', 'doing', 'having', 'stoop', 'using', 'provocative', 'material', 'fan', 'service', 'coarse', 'language', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'though', 'very', 'mature', 'complicated', 'film.MOVING', 'ON', 'first', 'animated', 'art', 'film', 'truly', 'draw', 'will', 'tell', 'film', 'real', 'trip', 'what', 'exactly', 'film', 'documentary', 'biography', 'Godzilla', 'mystery', 'drama', 'stage', 'play', 'samurai', 'flick', 'sci-fi', 'yes', 'hard', 'explain', 'One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'sure', 'wonderful', 'psychological', 'romance', 'will', 'really', 'test', 'mind', 'think', 'Inception', 'ten', 'times', 'more', 'trippy', 'also', 'story', 'love', 'identity', 'chase', 'can', 'discover', 'meaning', 'watch', 'plot', 'fairly', 'simple', 'execution', 'very', 'very', 'artistic', 'engaging', 'complexed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'just', 'something', 'experience', 'emotions', 'will', 'fly', 'times', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'pay', 'attention', 'dialogue', 'very', 'purposed', 'Also', 'pay', 'attention', 'repetitions', 'are', 'clues', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'Chiyoko', 'Interviewer', 'Cameraman', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'charming', 'more', 'importantly', 'serve', 'anchors', 'other', 'cases', 'mirror', 'Also', 'get', 'see', 'growth', 'development', 'people', 'time', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'as', 'well', 'strange', 'phenomena', 'choice', 'retrospect', 'Simply', 'put', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'how', 'beautiful', 'film', 'really', 'will', 'take', 'much', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'even', 'begin', 'grasp', 'small', 'portion', 'ending', 'epic', 'btw.Just', 'let', 'know', 'film', 'Japanese', 'dubbed', 'English', 'subtitles', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'will', 'say', 'definite', 'affirmation', 'was', 'wise', 'choice', 'i', ""'m"", 'purist', 'do', 'think', 'case', 'dub', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'something', 'not', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'magical', 'surreal', 'aspect', 'Japanese', 'helps', 'bring', 'film.SPECIAL', 'FEATURES', 'Well', ""n't"", 'really', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'feature', 'interview/commentary', 'Satoshi', 'Kon.ALL', 'IN', 'ALL', 'film', 'will', 'twist', 'mind', 'so', 'many', 'fun', 'meaningful', 'ways', 'beautifully', 'pieced', 'together', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'uplifting', 'yet', 'sad', 'so', 'simple', 'yet', 'so', 'complexed', ""'ll"", 'need', 'multiple', 'watches', 'watch', 'new', 'layer', 'depth', 'meaning', 'treasured', 'part', 'collection', 'not', 'film', 'children', 'far', 'too', 'complexed', 'many', 'themes', 'will', 'just', 'fly', 'over', 'heads', 'top', 'complexity', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'passively', 'are', 'willing', 'focus', 'can', 'be', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'then', 'again', 'chase', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'fun']",Millennium Actress

763678,A26O0T192IBKY1,B0000AK80C,J. Alford,"[0, 0]","From director Satoshi Kon is this bittersweet look at the life of a Japanese actress, as her history and past roles blend together into a compelling story. Kon is mostly known for doing psychological titles like Perfect Blue, Paranoia Agent, and Paprika. However, despite bending the laws of reality as much in his other works, this one reaches out on a sentimental level.Starting off in modern day, Genya is a director making a documentary on the demolishing of a famous Japanese movie studio, and interviews the belle of the movie set, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who is now a reclusive elderly lady. She recalls when she was a young girl and scouted by an up-and-coming movie director to be his latest star. Before her mother consents to her taking up a movie career, Chiyoko befriends a handsome artist who is on the run from the government for being an activist. He gives her a key and promises to see her again sometime. Chiyoko then sets out to be an actress mainly in the hope to find him somewhere while travelling Japan from set to set. While she conveys the details of her search during the interview, it begins to incorporate parts she played in various movies. She goes from being a samurai princess, a ninja, a geisha, and more, all the while only running into the artist once while he's still on the run, and is finally confronted by an officer who has been ""Zenigataing"" him this whole time. She later learns from him that the artist was captured and tortured to death. Chiyoko then goes on a long running sequence(one of film's several ones)which leads to her remembering her last role as an astronaut who continues to pursue her true love even into the stars. In reality though, she passes away of old age, but reaches a final sense of conclusion when Genya returns her key to her that had been missing for decades.Satoshi Kon delivers a finely animated production with this, while catering to the rich history of Japanese cinema. It might get a little confusing when they're going from parts of Chiyoko's life to her in one of her movies, plus having Genya and his camerman becoming integrated into them too. Aside from the somewhat dramatic overtones in it, there is also some exceptional comedy. Sony Pictures released this on DVD in the U.S. with only a Japanese track on it, probably due to the fact that the film caters alot more to otaku and those familiar with Japanese culture than your average American, however it's still an appealing film and worth checking out.",4,Satoshi Kon's finest film,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2482,"['director', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'bittersweet', 'look', 'life', 'Japanese', 'actress', 'history', 'past', 'roles', 'blend', 'together', 'compelling', 'story', 'Kon', 'mostly', 'known', 'doing', 'psychological', 'titles', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'Paranoia', 'Agent', 'Paprika', 'However', 'bending', 'laws', 'reality', 'much', 'other', 'works', 'one', 'out', 'sentimental', 'level.Starting', 'off', 'modern', 'day', 'Genya', 'director', 'making', 'documentary', 'demolishing', 'famous', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'studio', 'belle', 'movie', 'set', 'Chiyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'who', 'now', 'reclusive', 'elderly', 'lady', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'scouted', 'up-and-coming', 'movie', 'director', 'be', 'latest', 'star', 'mother', 'consents', 'taking', 'up', 'movie', 'career', 'Chiyoko', 'handsome', 'artist', 'who', 'run', 'government', 'being', 'activist', 'key', 'promises', 'see', 'again', 'sometime', 'Chiyoko', 'then', 'out', 'be', 'actress', 'mainly', 'hope', 'find', 'somewhere', 'travelling', 'Japan', 'set', 'set', 'details', 'search', 'interview', 'incorporate', 'parts', 'played', 'various', 'movies', 'being', 'samurai', 'princess', 'ninja', 'geisha', 'more', 'only', 'running', 'artist', 'once', 'still', 'run', 'finally', 'confronted', 'officer', 'who', 'been', 'Zenigataing', 'whole', 'time', 'later', 'artist', 'was', 'captured', 'tortured', 'death', 'Chiyoko', 'then', 'long', 'running', 'sequence', 'one', 'film', 'several', 'ones', 'remembering', 'last', 'role', 'astronaut', 'who', 'pursue', 'true', 'love', 'even', 'stars', 'reality', 'away', 'old', 'age', 'final', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Genya', 'key', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'decades.Satoshi', 'Kon', 'finely', 'animated', 'production', 'catering', 'rich', 'history', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'might', 'get', 'little', 'confusing', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'parts', 'Chiyoko', 'life', 'one', 'movies', 'having', 'Genya', 'camerman', 'becoming', 'integrated', 'too', 'Aside', 'somewhat', 'dramatic', 'overtones', 'also', 'exceptional', 'comedy', 'Sony', 'Pictures', 'released', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'only', 'Japanese', 'track', 'probably', 'due', 'fact', 'film', 'caters', 'alot', 'more', 'otaku', 'familiar', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'average', 'American', 'however', 'still', 'appealing', 'film', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Millennium Actress

""Millenium Actress"" is a biographical film about a fictitious but incredibly attractive Japanese movie star (even at 60!), who gets to be interviewed by a life-long admirer turned journalist. As the audience discovers, her life simply summarizes one century of Japanese cinema (from silents to ""Godzilla""), and her movies themselves, a thousand years of Japanese history (hence the title.)""Millenium Actress"" is a film that wraps the viewer into its perfectly imagined little world from the very first image and never lets him go. In fact, I was so immediately entranced by it that I realized I wanted it to end rapidly, afraid as I was that it might fail to fulfil its promise, and utimately lose momentum. But this obvious labour of love (from all parties involved) does manage to sustain to the end that unique combination of sweet and sour nostalgia, hopeless but ever hopeful romanticism, deliberately clicheed melodrama and occasionally overblown humour.My only regret is renting the film rather than buying it with my eyes closed.

Like the prior film, this beautiful anime steps away from the historical mecha, monster, sci-fi anime breeding ground and tells a story simply with stylized visuals.  The story involves a dedicated fan of a famous Japanese actress who seeks her out when she's in her 70's.

Millenium Actress feels like a normal movie that just happens to be animated.  I won't go into all the details of the plot, but I will just comment that the plot was excellent, very adult but not ""adult"", the characters were good, and of course the visual elements were astounding.  This movie doesn't have the Disney-esque feel that movies like Steamboy (which I didn't care for), in fact it felt more like watching an Oscar worthy picture.

I had a hard time distinguishing life-flashbacks and older movie sequences.  The woodgrains in the background added subtle overtones into the emotional mixtures, but I noticed them because the story totally dragged.According to the extras, Kon's intended the movie as a story stereogram.  A stereogram is an object that resembles different objects depending on your mindset and interpretation.  My opinion is the director went too far, adding non-linear elements to a point where the story itself became unclear.If you are a sophisticated cinema lover, you'll enjoy this movie immensely.  If you wanted to watch an entertaining anime after a mentally taxing day at work, look elsewhere.  The mystery never wrenched me because it could also be a bedtime story.  The suspense never scared me because it could also be romance.  The adventure never thrilled me because it was always a flashback.  My problem with the stereogrammatic approach was the opacity took away purity.Overall I felt unmoved at the end.

A documentary filmmaker interviews the legendary Japanese actress Chiyoko Fujiwara. Now a 70 year old lady, Chiyoko's career has nevertheless spanned a millennium from period drama to science-fiction drama - but it's a single incident from her childhood that serves as a common thread through all her films and is also the key (literally as well as figuratively) inspiration that makes those performances so great.The animation then is fully put to the service of the story, Chiyoko's real-life and the documentary filmmakers all coming together into the landscape of her filmmaking career, the animation fluidly blending between them all, serving to add subtle emotional resonances - and sometimes not quite so subtle it must be admitted, but perfectly in tune nonetheless with the dramatic nature of the subject. In this way, Millennium Actress becomes a tribute not only to Japanese cinema, but to the nature of cinema as a whole, to the necessity of drama and the creation of fiction to make lives all the more vivid and meaningful.

763691,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B0000AK80C,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","The story of the film is done in the style of a ""play within a play.""  Genya Tachibana is working on a documentary about a famous actress named Chiyoko Fujiwara.  Chiyoko is an elderly actress who has withdrawn from public life.  As Genya talks with Chiyoko, we see the story of her life from her teenage years to being a middle aged superstar.  The flashbacks that appear are interspersed with segments from Chiyoko's films.  While Chiyoko's life takes place surrounding World War II, the characters in her films span from the Sengoku period to a futuristic space age.One of the big elements of the story has to do with a dissident artist that Chiyoko helped to escape from the military.  She became attracted to him, but he had to flee.  However, he left behind a key to his suitcase, and Chiyoko wants to find him.  She initially became an actress in order to have the opportunities to travel and to try to find him.  Over the course of the story, we learn that Genya was actually part of Chiyoko's past, although she doesn't realize it right at first.The execution of the story is very well-done, although there are a lot of layers to the storytelling.  You really have to watch it more than once in order to pick up on details that you may have missed the first time you watch it.  While there's nothing visually that would be unacceptable to younger viewers, I think the execution of the storytelling of the film would be rather confusing to them.  I would personally recommend this film to anime viewers who are fifteen or sixteen years of age and older.There are two special features on the DVD.  The first is a forty minute documentary about the making of Millennium Actress.  The documentary is in Japanese with English subtitles.  The narration is done by the voice actor for Genya.  Over the course of the documentary, interviews are included from Satoshi Kon, several members of the production team, and all three voice actresses for Chiyoko.  The other extra is a trailer for Millennium Actress that is slightly over a minute long.  This trailer is in English to promote Dreamworks' release of the film.Millennium Actress is a very well-done anime film, and it has become a classic.  I would personally recommend this DVD for anyone who considers themselves as a fan of Satoshi Kon's work or as a fan of anime in general.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband purchased for me as a gift.",5,A very well-done film,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2432,"['story', 'film', 'done', 'style', 'play', 'play', 'Genya', 'Tachibana', 'working', 'documentary', 'famous', 'actress', 'named', 'Chiyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'Chiyoko', 'elderly', 'actress', 'who', 'withdrawn', 'public', 'life', 'Genya', 'talks', 'Chiyoko', 'see', 'story', 'life', 'teenage', 'years', 'being', 'middle', 'aged', 'superstar', 'flashbacks', 'appear', 'are', 'interspersed', 'segments', 'Chiyoko', 'films', 'Chiyoko', 'life', 'place', 'surrounding', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'characters', 'films', 'span', 'Sengoku', 'period', 'futuristic', 'space', 'age.One', 'big', 'elements', 'story', 'do', 'dissident', 'artist', 'Chiyoko', 'helped', 'escape', 'military', 'became', 'attracted', 'had', 'flee', 'However', 'left', 'behind', 'key', 'suitcase', 'Chiyoko', 'find', 'initially', 'became', 'actress', 'order', 'have', 'opportunities', 'travel', 'try', 'find', 'course', 'story', 'learn', 'Genya', 'was', 'actually', 'part', 'Chiyoko', 'past', ""n't"", 'realize', 'right', 'first.The', 'execution', 'story', 'very', 'well-done', 'are', 'lot', 'layers', 'storytelling', 'really', 'have', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'order', 'pick', 'up', 'details', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'nothing', 'visually', 'would', 'be', 'unacceptable', 'younger', 'viewers', 'think', 'execution', 'storytelling', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'rather', 'confusing', 'would', 'personally', 'recommend', 'film', 'anime', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'years', 'age', 'are', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'first', 'forty', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'documentary', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'narration', 'done', 'voice', 'actor', 'Genya', 'course', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'are', 'included', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'several', 'members', 'production', 'team', 'three', 'voice', 'actresses', 'Chiyoko', 'other', 'extra', 'trailer', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'slightly', 'minute', 'long', 'trailer', 'English', 'promote', 'Dreamworks', 'release', 'film.Millennium', 'Actress', 'very', 'well-done', 'anime', 'film', 'become', 'classic', 'would', 'personally', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'work', 'fan', 'anime', 'general.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'husband', 'purchased', 'gift']",Millennium Actress
763692,A1ZI39BA3KWE1S,B0000AK80C,"Matt Tuozzo ""The Chisa""","[7, 10]","The term &quot;anime&quot; immediately invokes feelings of disgust in a good number of American filmviewers, usually due to it's immediate association with the great bulk of mindless sci-fi and fantasy drivel that makes it to the States (see: Pokemon, Sailor Moon, etc.) and the fact that most people simply think cartoons are for kids.  For the most part, they're right -- I'm certainly not going to sit here and laud the mature, artistic merits of Hand Maid May, for example -- but rightfully acclaimed director Satoshi Kon is the exception that proves the rule.  Perfect Blue, his first film to make it across the Pacific, set new standards for both animation and screenwriting with it's elaborate, psychedelic, and very adult spiral into schizophrenia.  Now, Millennium Actress continues his motif of the mind as a gateway to fantastic, non-linear timelines.  It begins when Genya Tachibana, the director of a documentary commemorating a famous movie studio, seeks out Chiyoko Fujiwara, a legendary actress who disappeared from the studio some 30 years previous.  With his reluctant, ascerbic cameraman in tow, Genya gains the now-elderly Chiyoko's confidence by presenting her with a literal key to her past.  As their interview progresses, the trio travels through Chiyoko's life story, where her movie roles and experiences weave an impossible thousand-year tale of love and commitment -- for Chiyoko and Genya alike.  Sometimes Millennium Actress swings the viewer from heart-wrenching drama to hilarious comic relief (and back) fast enough to leave psychic whiplash; at other times, Chiyoko's particular blend of memoirs and memories cloud the path to her resolution in a haze of geriatric senility -- but this beautifully animated film always keeps just enough grounded in reality to develop a compelling, coherrent, compassionate story.  Millenium Actress is a tribute to the possibilties that Japanimation holds as a cultural artform, and is a terrific sophomore offering from Satoshi Kon.

We watch as she is ""Discovered"" and begins her career Hoping that as she travels from location to location she will be reunited with the mysterious stranger who has touched her heart, and return to him the treassured key that he left in her keeping.For Chioyoko acting is a means to an end, but the longing in her soul is relflected by the films she chooses. A career filled with haunting romantic dramas mix with her memories of unrequited love. It becomes clear that Chioyoko can no longer distinguish between the two. The ending is sad but touching and made all the more heart renching beause of the knowledge that Tachibana has carried for decades.I""ve heard this film called depressing. it's very sad that's true but as the credits rolled I found myself uplifed by the sheer beauty of this film.",5,Praise for the Actress,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,1348,"['Millennium', 'Actress', 'first', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'deeply', 'impressed', 'are', 'picky', 'Anime', 'watch', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film.We', 'meet', 'Chioyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'actress', 'elderly', 'woman', 'travel', 'bakwards', 'past', 'extreemly', 'rare', 'enterview', 'enamored', 'journalist', 'Genya', 'Tachibana', 'who', 'also', 'come', 'return', 'Chioyoko', 'most', 'precious', 'object.The', 'viewer', 'submersed', 'Chioyoko', 'memories', 'witness', 'chance', 'meeting', 'girlhood', 'would', 'drive', 'future', 'watch', 'Discovered', 'career', 'Hoping', 'location', 'location', 'will', 'be', 'reunited', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'touched', 'heart', 'return', 'treassured', 'key', 'left', 'keeping.For', 'Chioyoko', 'acting', 'means', 'end', 'longing', 'soul', 'relflected', 'films', 'career', 'filled', 'haunting', 'romantic', 'dramas', 'mix', 'memories', 'unrequited', 'love', 'clear', 'Chioyoko', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'distinguish', 'two', 'ending', 'sad', 'touching', 'made', 'more', 'heart', 'renching', 'beause', 'knowledge', 'Tachibana', 'carried', 'decades.I', 've', 'heard', 'film', 'called', 'depressing', 'very', 'sad', 'true', 'credits', 'rolled', 'found', 'uplifed', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'film']",Millennium Actress

The story is warm yet tragic, the scenes flow into each other, switching between the reality of the studio and the reality of real life like water flows through a forest.

Sublime, yet raw in emotions and amazing in how much it pulls out of the watcher.The plot is one actress's search for her first love.

I still haven't come up with much. It's a good movie, though a confusing one at times. Full of the depth of character one expects from the top Japanese directors of animation, well-plotted if a bit threadbare in places. In other words, good, but could've been better.The story centers on Chiyoko Fujiwara, a retired actress tracked down by a reporter, Genya Tachibana, and Genya's cameraman Eiko soon after the studio where she rose to fame was torn down. Genya and Chiyoko talk, both reliving the most famous scenes in her movies and putting together the tale of the things that happened in between, as Chiyoko pursued her first love, an anonymous man who had given her a key when she was younger.The first fifteen or twenty minutes, pay very very close attention-- and even then, you may miss a time shift or two. Once you get used to the way things go back and forth in time, though, the movie gets much easier to follow, and you can spend your time getting to know the characters. Things just keep going after that, with the plot really taking a backseat to the character-building; this makes the end of the movie work perfectly. It's quite an enjoyable little movie, really, and worth watching. *** ",3,"Confusing at first, but powerful.",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1331,"['Millennium', 'Actress', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', '2001', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'say', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'week', 'now', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'much', 'good', 'movie', 'confusing', 'one', 'times', 'Full', 'depth', 'character', 'one', 'top', 'Japanese', 'directors', 'animation', 'well-plotted', 'bit', 'threadbare', 'places', 'other', 'words', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better.The', 'story', 'centers', 'Chiyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'retired', 'actress', 'tracked', 'down', 'reporter', 'Genya', 'Tachibana', 'Genya', 'cameraman', 'Eiko', 'soon', 'studio', 'where', 'rose', 'fame', 'was', 'torn', 'down', 'Genya', 'Chiyoko', 'talk', 'reliving', 'most', 'famous', 'scenes', 'movies', 'putting', 'together', 'tale', 'things', 'happened', 'Chiyoko', 'pursued', 'first', 'love', 'anonymous', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'given', 'key', 'when', 'was', 'younger.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'pay', 'very', 'very', 'close', 'attention', 'even', 'then', 'may', 'miss', 'time', 'shift', 'two', 'get', 'used', 'way', 'things', 'go', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'though', 'movie', 'much', 'easier', 'follow', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'Things', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'plot', 'really', 'taking', 'backseat', 'character-building', 'end', 'movie', 'work', 'perfectly', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'movie', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', '***']",Millennium Actress
763703,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0000AK80C,Robert Moore,"[19, 24]","MILLENIUM ACTRESS is an extremely ambitious, brilliantly executed animated film by the extremely talented Satashi Kon, who previously directed the marvelous PERFECT BLUE.  There are many, many exquisite moments, where Kon is clearly pulling out all the stops to try to take animation to a completely new level, with a cascade of marvelous images and attempts to animate effects that have never or rarely been attempted before.  From a sheer technical perspective, this film is really hard to top.  Unfortunately, I personally found the story lagging behind the animation.  Nonetheless, this film is certain to delight any fan of anime.As much as I loved the animation, and even loved many individual scenes, the film as a whole just didn't quite come together.  The story's pretext reminded me a bit of the puzzle facing Billy Pilgrim in SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE:  like Pilgrim, famous and aging actress Chiyoko Fujiwara has become unstuck in time.  Her migrations in time occur during an interview with a representative from her former studio, who turns out to have been in love with her for many years.  During their interview, Chiyoko and her two interviewers travel magically to and fro during the course of her childhood and film career, in many instances reenacting famous scenes in her career.  Throughout it all, she remains obsessed with a key that she has promised to return to a mysterious painter and political revolutionary (despite Japan's political conservativism during many parts of its history in the 20th century, the heroes in this film are all rebels or friends of rebels).The film ends with a theme not dissimilar to one of the &quot;Theses Actually or Possibly Attributable to Lessing&quot; in Kierkegaard's CONCLUDING UNSCIENTIFIC POSTSCRIPT, where Lessing/Kierkegaard, being offered either the Truth which God hold in his right hand or the search for the Truth which he holds in his left, chooses the left hand.  Chiyoko is never able to return the key to her beloved, but at the end of her life she learns that the lifelong attempt and struggle to do so was the most important thing in life.  In this way, her mysterious stranger becomes symbolic for all that is most important.  The problem is that the narrative that would express this becomes too frequently erratic or incoherent.  Furthermore, because of the narrative problems in the film, I found my interest level sagging towards the end of the film.Nonetheless, this remains an absolutely first rate film, and one of the most fascinating examples of adult animation I have seen, though by adult I don't mean in any way obscene.  I'm not certain that a small child would find this film very interesting, but neither would a parent find anything in it inappropriate for a child.",4,A marvelously inventive and ambitious animated film,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",2003,2755,"['MILLENIUM', 'ACTRESS', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'brilliantly', 'executed', 'animated', 'film', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Satashi', 'Kon', 'who', 'previously', 'directed', 'marvelous', 'PERFECT', 'BLUE', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'exquisite', 'moments', 'where', 'Kon', 'clearly', 'pulling', 'out', 'stops', 'try', 'take', 'animation', 'completely', 'new', 'level', 'cascade', 'marvelous', 'images', 'attempts', 'animate', 'effects', 'have', 'never', 'rarely', 'been', 'attempted', 'sheer', 'technical', 'perspective', 'film', 'really', 'hard', 'top', 'Unfortunately', 'personally', 'found', 'story', 'lagging', 'animation', 'Nonetheless', 'film', 'certain', 'delight', 'fan', 'anime.As', 'much', 'loved', 'animation', 'even', 'loved', 'many', 'individual', 'scenes', 'film', 'whole', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'come', 'together', 'story', 'pretext', 'reminded', 'bit', 'puzzle', 'facing', 'Billy', 'Pilgrim', 'SLAUGHTERHOUSE', 'FIVE', 'like', 'Pilgrim', 'famous', 'aging', 'actress', 'Chiyoko', 'Fujiwara', 'become', 'unstuck', 'time', 'migrations', 'time', 'occur', 'interview', 'representative', 'former', 'studio', 'who', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'love', 'many', 'years', 'interview', 'Chiyoko', 'two', 'interviewers', 'travel', 'magically', 'fro', 'course', 'childhood', 'film', 'career', 'many', 'instances', 'reenacting', 'famous', 'scenes', 'career', 'obsessed', 'key', 'promised', 'return', 'mysterious', 'painter', 'political', 'revolutionary', 'Japan', 'political', 'conservativism', 'many', 'parts', 'history', '20th', 'century', 'heroes', 'film', 'are', 'rebels', 'friends', 'rebels', '.The', 'film', 'ends', 'theme', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'one', 'quot', 'Actually', 'Possibly', 'Attributable', 'Lessing', 'quot', 'Kierkegaard', 'CONCLUDING', 'UNSCIENTIFIC', 'POSTSCRIPT', 'where', 'Lessing/Kierkegaard', 'being', 'offered', 'Truth', 'God', 'hold', 'right', 'hand', 'search', 'Truth', 'left', 'left', 'hand', 'Chiyoko', 'never', 'able', 'return', 'key', 'beloved', 'end', 'life', 'lifelong', 'attempt', 'struggle', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'life', 'way', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'symbolic', 'most', 'important', 'problem', 'narrative', 'would', 'express', 'too', 'frequently', 'erratic', 'incoherent', 'Furthermore', 'narrative', 'problems', 'film', 'found', 'interest', 'level', 'sagging', 'end', 'film.Nonetheless', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'examples', 'adult', 'animation', 'have', 'seen', 'adult', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'way', 'obscene', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'small', 'child', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'neither', 'would', 'parent', 'find', 'anything', 'inappropriate', 'child']",Millennium Actress

So far it's the only Satoshi Kon movie I've seen, but I have my eye on Tokyo Godfathers.This movie is about an old former actress who relates her life story to an interviewer who, unbeknownst to her, she met earlier.  The whole story, and basically her whole life, revolves around her relentless search for a political refugee she met before he ran away.  It also spotlights some movies she starred in, and it's nearly impossible to tell what's real and what's not; often, what we're supposed to assume are true events in her life segue directly into what we're supposed to a assume is a movie.  Several elements in her life seem to be equally part of both worlds.  (For anyone not really familiar with anime, this movie is a lot like Big Fish in that fantasy and reality are not vaguely defined, and the timeline doubles back on itself.)This certainly isn't the happiest movie around.

Bell ""spawn96""","[0, 0]","The tale revolves around a documentary being filmed by a older filmmaker, telling the story of a famous actress that he had worked with in his past, but who had retired years earlier. In the midst of interviewing this lost forgotten screen idol, she tells him her story; of her recruitment to act in patriotic films during the Japanese campaign in Manchuria, and the love of her life that both inspired her to become an actress, but also haunted her for the rest of her days.In the telling of the tale, flashbacks are used extensively, many times in such a way that it's hard to tell what is an actual memory and what may have come from the actresses movie roles. In the course of relating the story, the filmmaker continues to appear in the story, probably caused by his prompting in order to both get her story, and show his support for a woman he obviously loves.

As she tells her story, the two men encounter her life by living through them, in an astral-projection way.Full of slapstick comedy, action, mystery and, of course, love.

763711,A3R8PXSFGY9MC2,B0000AK80C,Spider Monkey,"[2, 2]","`Millennium Actress' is an unusual film, with a unique storyline and with stunning animation. Chiyoko is an actress recounting her life story to a film crew and as she tells it, the films she has starred in and her real life become intertwined. The film crew go back in time with her as she acts in various films and searches for a lost love. This can get quite confusing at times, but once you get your head around the premise this makes for a unique and original style of film making. The animation is wonderful and is all the better for being hand drawn rather than the CGI pieces so often produced these days. The soundtrack compliments the film perfectly and the director deliberately requested this respected composer to work on this film for him and it is a stronger film when the soundtrack is coupled with the animation on screen. There is a `making of' feature as an extra on this disc which gives a deeper insight into the film and shows how the film developed. This is definitely a film that will get better with repeated viewings and whilst that first viewing may leave you mildly baffled, when you come to it again you will appreciate it for it's depth and beauty.

763712,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B0000AK80C,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[4, 5]","Now THIS is a hard movie to put into words.  I can easily apply words like excellent, beautiful, mind-blowing, multi-layered and stunning, but that merely conveys my personal rabid enthusiasm for ""Millennium Actress"".  The first ten minutes or so are easy enough to describe - a pair of filmakers set out to profile and interview a famous Japanese actress who's lived as a recluse for many years, having disappeared from public life at the height of her career.  From there the territory it heads into is among the most open-to-interpretation, the most moving, and (in my opinion) the most metaphysical plot ambiguities and mesmerizations ever captured on film.  Ten people could watch this and come up with ten different takes on the movie, ranging from the mundane (as in worldly and rational, NOT dull) to the whimsical to the terrifyingly dark or to the dreamlike, or any combination thereof.  I and the ones I saw this with came up with similar interpretations, but that could be due to our similar ways of thinking.  Someone with a different worldview or imagination or set of beliefs might come up with a vastly different, but no less valid, way of interpreting it.  There are no 'wrongs' in interpreting a movie and what each individual gets out of it.  I still cling to hopes of someday publishing some of the stories floating around in my head, and if I'm fortunate enough to do so, some readers may get quite different takes on it than what I had in mind, and that's not wrong, it's just different.One thing I can say about ""Millennium Actress"" is that it has some of the most realistic animation I've ever seen.  Not realistic in the same sense as ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" of the firs segment in ""Animatrix"" where it looks nearly live-action (brilliantly so), but realistic in terms of body language, facial expressions, personal mannerisms, and so on.  And the subtitling job is dead-on flawless; if you're a viewer who usually avoids subtitled films, this could be a great introduction.In 2001, Millennium Actress split Japan's prestigious Agency of Cultural Affairs Media Arts Festifal Animation Grand Prize with the already-legendary ""Spirited Away"".  The 2 movies are very different, but Millennium Actress is 1000% worthy of tying ""Spirited"" as its full equal.

I lean towards the ""eh"" side.  While watching it, I was kind of bored, but when the movie ended, I thought, ""Hey, that was a pretty good movie.""Millennium Actress is the type of movie that you have to sit through the whole movie to appreciate.  The way the story is told takes a little getting used to, but it is a very innovative way of telling a story.  A movie studio is being torn down, and a movie producer, Tachibana, has been granted an interview with the studio's greatest star, Chiyoko, who has been in seclusion for the past 30 years.  As she tells her story, you get a history of Japan via the actress' roles in jidaigeki (historical period movies).  Her movie roles and personal life are intertwined as she searches for the love of her life. Millennium Actress does what Japanese cinema, historically, does so well: the story of the tragic romance.Objectively, the story-telling itself is admirable.  We learn about the characters incrementally, and tag along with her on her ""journey"" just like the way Tachibana does when as he interviews her.  At the end, everything comes together.Subjectively, how well you like the movie will just depend on how you react towards the characters. Some will be enthralled as the movie goes forward. Some, like me, will appreciate the story and characters more after watching it than while watching it. And some will really not bond with the characters and situation at all.",3,"An ""Either or"" Movie",1267315200,"02 28, 2010",2010,1535,"['one', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'great', 'others', 'wil', 'find', 'eh', 'lean', 'eh', 'side', 'watching', 'was', 'kind', 'bored', 'when', 'movie', 'ended', 'thought', 'Hey', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'type', 'movie', 'have', 'sit', 'whole', 'movie', 'appreciate', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'very', 'innovative', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'movie', 'studio', 'being', 'torn', 'down', 'movie', 'producer', 'Tachibana', 'been', 'granted', 'interview', 'studio', 'greatest', 'star', 'Chiyoko', 'who', 'been', 'seclusion', 'past', '30', 'years', 'story', 'get', 'history', 'Japan', 'actress', 'roles', 'jidaigeki', 'historical', 'period', 'movies', 'movie', 'roles', 'personal', 'life', 'are', 'intertwined', 'love', 'life', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'what', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'historically', 'so', 'well', 'story', 'tragic', 'romance.Objectively', 'story-telling', 'admirable', 'learn', 'characters', 'incrementally', 'tag', 'journey', 'just', 'way', 'Tachibana', 'when', 'end', 'everything', 'together.Subjectively', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'will', 'just', 'depend', 'how', 'react', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'enthralled', 'movie', 'forward', 'will', 'appreciate', 'story', 'characters', 'more', 'watching', 'watching', 'will', 'really', 'not', 'bond', 'characters', 'situation']",Millennium Actress

Not so here. Upon my first viewing of Millennium Actress, it stuck me not simply as anime, or an anime film, but more like something that you would catch a tv channel showing high-art films late at night. All of the elements of film that takes itself seriously are there.In this film there are dramatic camera angles, amazing use of color, a striking film score, incredible dialog and perfect acting. In a normal film you would say that magic was captured by the camera. In this movie it was CRAFTED, because it is not live-action, but animation. Many reviews have talked about the brilliant exploration of the many film genres that this movie recreates (from samurai flicks to war films to sci-fi drama), and I have to say that the way this movei switches seemlessly from reality to flashback, and the way that fantasy and reality fuse together is nothing short of breath-taking. You could say that this movie manages to capture the true nature of memories. As time passes, memories change. And sometimes they run together and seem to happen at the same time. Was it a dream or was it real? That's the mystery, the reason why this movie is so fascinating.Some have remarked that there was some flaw or other with the animation or soundtrack. All I can say in response is that the animation in this film is a work of art. Maybe you don't like it, but to call it flawed would be a terrible insult. The same thing goes with the soundtrack. Cheesy 80's style music?! I would call it more an awesome experimental soundtrack that highlights moments of drama perfectly.Upon reflection there is no doubt in my mind.

One word of warning-there is a version which has an english dub-you need to get the R2 PAL British dvd. The dub is quite good+it has both english and japanese DTS soundtracks-just make sure your dvd player can handle it.,5,Excellent Movie,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,374,"['recent', 'passing', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'was', 'great', 'loss', 'went', 'back', 'select', 'favorite', 'feature', 'winner', 'down', 'was', 'Millennial', 'Actress', 'One', 'word', 'warning-there', 'version', 'english', 'dub-you', 'need', 'get', 'R2', 'PAL', 'British', 'dvd', 'dub', 'quite', 'good+it', 'english', 'japanese', 'DTS', 'soundtracks-just', 'make', 'sure', 'dvd', 'player', 'can', 'handle']",Millennium Actress

This was because I found Satoshi Kon's Perfect Blue a bit ""edgy"". I was pleasantly surprised to find Millennium Actress a delightful film. It is entertaining, engaging and not at all disturbing. While the ending is not a classically happy one it does not leave you feeling sad or dissatisfied. A good buy for anyone who enjoys quality anime.",4,A pleasant surprise,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,421,"['was', 'somewhat', 'nervous', 'buying', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'first', 'seeing', 'was', 'found', 'Satoshi', 'Kon', 'Perfect', 'Blue', 'bit', 'edgy', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'delightful', 'film', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'not', 'disturbing', 'ending', 'not', 'classically', 'happy', 'one', 'not', 'leave', 'feeling', 'sad', 'dissatisfied', 'good', 'buy', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'anime']",Millennium Actress
763723,AUTBHG6070SL4,B0000AK80C,"wiredweird ""wiredweird""","[2, 2]","This is something I haven't seen in a long time: a basically different kind of narrative.Chiyoko was an actress, many years ago. Now, after she's been in retirement for decades, a former co-worker (Genya) interviews her about her life, her career, and the one mysterious strand that connects all the pieces together.The story is told in scenes from her earlier life, mostly in fragments of the movies Chiyoko has made. Occasional cuts back to the present interview keep the story anchored, but the cinematic flashbacks really carry the narrative.The unique aspect was that Genya and his camera-man find themselves transported into each flashback. When a scene from a remembered movie shows fire, they feel the heat. When another scene shows an attack by archers, the camera-man's sleeve is pinned to the wall. At first, the two are ghostlike observers, unable to interact with the scene. Gradually, however, Genya is pulled into the action; he now takes part in the movie-memory.Saying more would be saying too much. There are many surprises in this movie, and I want you to enjoy them the way I did.This anime meets very high technical standards, but competent animation is easy to find. The story and the style of the story-telling really carry this movie. There are layers to unravel, making this much more complex and nuanced than most animation. This almost never happens to me: as soon as the movie ended, I wanted to see it again.My partner and I rented this movie. Just a few minutes in, we realized we should have bought it.",5,A different way to tell a story,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,1533,"['something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'basically', 'different', 'kind', 'narrative.Chiyoko', 'was', 'actress', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Now', 'been', 'retirement', 'decades', 'former', 'co-worker', 'Genya', 'life', 'career', 'one', 'mysterious', 'strand', 'pieces', 'together.The', 'story', 'told', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'life', 'mostly', 'fragments', 'movies', 'Chiyoko', 'made', 'Occasional', 'back', 'present', 'interview', 'keep', 'story', 'anchored', 'cinematic', 'flashbacks', 'really', 'carry', 'narrative.The', 'unique', 'aspect', 'was', 'Genya', 'camera-man', 'find', 'transported', 'flashback', 'When', 'scene', 'remembered', 'movie', 'shows', 'fire', 'feel', 'heat', 'When', 'scene', 'attack', 'archers', 'camera-man', 'sleeve', 'pinned', 'wall', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'ghostlike', 'observers', 'unable', 'interact', 'scene', 'Gradually', 'however', 'Genya', 'pulled', 'action', 'now', 'part', 'movie-memory.Saying', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'saying', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'many', 'surprises', 'movie', 'want', 'enjoy', 'way', 'did.This', 'anime', 'meets', 'very', 'high', 'technical', 'standards', 'competent', 'animation', 'easy', 'find', 'story', 'style', 'story-telling', 'really', 'carry', 'movie', 'are', 'layers', 'unravel', 'making', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'most', 'animation', 'almost', 'never', 'as', 'soon', 'movie', 'ended', 'wanted', 'see', 'again.My', 'partner', 'rented', 'movie', 'Just', 'few', 'minutes', 'realized', 'should', 'have', 'bought']",Millennium Actress

It takes a good look at the medium, and puts forth a story that utilizes the unique strengths of animation, making a film that could not be live-action.  This is a master at work.Both intellectual and emotional, the story is profound and touching, deep with sorrow and hope and unspoken, unrequited love that lasts throughout the years of a lifetime.  The two main stories are Chioyoko, desperately seeking the love of her childhood across the years, a man who gave her a key to &quot;the most important thing&quot; and Genya, the journalist interviewing Chioyoko about her life, and who also has carried a secret, powerful love for most of his lifetime.Drifting across Chioyoko's lifetime as an actress, the story fades in and out of her movies, blending seamlessly fantasy and reality, past, present and future.  The technique is amazing, as is the journey through Japan's history as Chioyoko makes various period films, becoming schoolgirl, peasant, Geisha, prostitute, Samurai princess and astronaut.  Always she is seeking the man she knew as a child, and every role is a quest.A brilliant film, on par with any great animation such as &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; or &quot;Spirited Away.&quot;",5,The love of the chase and the romance of unrequited love,1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,1279,"['quot', 'Millennium', 'Actress', 'quot', 'what', 'good', 'animation', 'should', 'do', 'good', 'look', 'medium', 'forth', 'story', 'unique', 'strengths', 'animation', 'making', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'live-action', 'master', 'work.Both', 'intellectual', 'emotional', 'story', 'profound', 'touching', 'deep', 'sorrow', 'hope', 'unspoken', 'unrequited', 'love', 'years', 'lifetime', 'two', 'main', 'stories', 'are', 'Chioyoko', 'desperately', 'seeking', 'love', 'childhood', 'years', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'key', 'quot', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'quot', 'Genya', 'journalist', 'interviewing', 'Chioyoko', 'life', 'who', 'also', 'carried', 'secret', 'powerful', 'love', 'most', 'lifetime.Drifting', 'Chioyoko', 'lifetime', 'actress', 'story', 'fades', 'movies', 'blending', 'seamlessly', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'technique', 'amazing', 'journey', 'Japan', 'history', 'Chioyoko', 'various', 'period', 'films', 'becoming', 'schoolgirl', 'peasant', 'Geisha', 'prostitute', 'Samurai', 'princess', 'astronaut', 'Always', 'seeking', 'man', 'knew', 'child', 'role', 'quest.A', 'brilliant', 'film', 'par', 'great', 'animation', 'such', 'quot', 'Grave', 'Fireflies', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spirited', 'Away.', 'quot']",Millennium Actress
