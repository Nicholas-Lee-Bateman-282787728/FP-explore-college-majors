I've always been interested in science and the people at the cutting edge, but this autobiographical account of Mr. Hawkings path through life tended to drag.  There were even moments when I almost became convinced that we'd been dragged to the event horizon of one of the black holes he is so famous for working with.  There are some moments of interest that can draw your attention, but they are few and far between.  Unless you are into biographical videos, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this one.",2,An anything but brief history,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,581,"['video', 'was', 'purchased', 'part', 'required', 'material', 'college', 'course', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'science', 'people', 'cutting', 'edge', 'autobiographical', 'account', 'Mr.', 'Hawkings', 'life', 'tended', 'drag', 'were', 'even', 'moments', 'when', 'almost', 'became', 'convinced', ""'d"", 'been', 'dragged', 'event', 'horizon', 'one', 'black', 'holes', 'so', 'famous', 'working', 'are', 'moments', 'interest', 'can', 'draw', 'attention', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'are', 'biographical', 'videos', 'would', ""n't"", 'suggest', 'purchasing', 'one']",A Brief History of Time VHS

At times, it goes through unnecessary stories about Hawking's life; for example, they showed how much he loved Monopoly when he was young. Is this really needed? How many people in the western civilization didn't or haven't played monoply? Nonethless, the movie is mindbending at times, espicially when discussing black holes and the theories of time. Beautiful Philip Glass score, and an inspirational ending.",4,Redundant and Mindbending,981676800,"02 9, 2001",2001,535,"['Brief', 'History', 'Time', 'film', 'story', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'life', 'theories', 'quantum', 'physics', 'times', 'unnecessary', 'stories', 'Hawking', 'life', 'example', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'Monopoly', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'really', 'needed', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'western', 'civilization', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'monoply', 'Nonethless', 'movie', 'mindbending', 'times', 'espicially', 'when', 'discussing', 'black', 'holes', 'theories', 'time', 'Beautiful', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'score', 'inspirational', 'ending']",A Brief History of Time VHS
329129,AAY1YLTKK4JC7,6302718805,"Martin Andrade ""Media Gurgitator""","[9, 10]","This delightful documentary gives a keen look at the intimate parts of Stephen Hawking's remarkable life.  Interviews of friends, family members, and colleagues are artfully weaved with pictures of Hawking, computer graphic illustrations, and the commentary of Hawking himself.  Along with the overview of Hawking's life we get fascinating bits of physics and philosophy that challenges his mind and everyone else's.  If you have an interest in popular physics, then this would be a worthy purchase.This isn't a spectacular documentary, it stays true to the accepted style that is both entertaining and at times predictable and plodding.  It is humorous though, the opening scene involves a chicken and some stars, and much of Hawking's narration is filled with wry wit.The First portion of the film is almost solely devoted to the early years of Professor Hawking's life.  He wasn't good at school we learn surprisingly.  He was never as attentive as he later wished he should have been.  However, his genius was enough, and he got his degrees.  However, it was being diagnosed with ALS that forced him to focus on what really interested him, the aftermath of which has been the cosmologist we know today.Further into the movie there is a discussion of black holes, which is the subject of Hawking's first successes in physics.  This segment alone I consider worth the price of admission, however an even stronger segment comes next; a discussion of the origin and outcome of the universe in which we live.  It's all concluded by some whimsical observations by Hawking.  This isn't a classic, but for those that don't have the time to jump into many works of cosmology and physics and philosophy, this provides entertainment and a fair dose of where physics stands today.",5,Enjoyable and thought provoking,1059696000,"08 1, 2003",2003,1772,"['delightful', 'documentary', 'keen', 'look', 'intimate', 'parts', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'remarkable', 'life', 'Interviews', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'colleagues', 'are', 'artfully', 'weaved', 'pictures', 'Hawking', 'computer', 'graphic', 'illustrations', 'commentary', 'Hawking', 'overview', 'Hawking', 'life', 'get', 'fascinating', 'bits', 'physics', 'philosophy', 'mind', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'interest', 'popular', 'physics', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'worthy', 'purchase.This', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'documentary', 'true', 'accepted', 'style', 'entertaining', 'times', 'predictable', 'plodding', 'humorous', 'opening', 'scene', 'chicken', 'stars', 'much', 'Hawking', 'narration', 'filled', 'wry', 'wit.The', 'First', 'portion', 'film', 'almost', 'solely', 'devoted', 'early', 'years', 'Professor', 'Hawking', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'school', 'learn', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'attentive', 'later', 'wished', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'However', 'genius', 'was', 'enough', 'got', 'degrees', 'However', 'was', 'being', 'diagnosed', 'ALS', 'forced', 'focus', 'really', 'interested', 'aftermath', 'been', 'cosmologist', 'know', 'today.Further', 'movie', 'discussion', 'black', 'holes', 'subject', 'Hawking', 'first', 'successes', 'physics', 'segment', 'alone', 'consider', 'price', 'admission', 'however', 'even', 'stronger', 'segment', 'next', 'discussion', 'origin', 'outcome', 'universe', 'live', 'concluded', 'whimsical', 'observations', 'Hawking', ""n't"", 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'jump', 'many', 'works', 'cosmology', 'physics', 'philosophy', 'entertainment', 'fair', 'dose', 'where', 'physics', 'today']",A Brief History of Time VHS

Buisman,"[0, 1]","Many documentaries focus on either the scientific ideas of a person, trying to explain them to an audience wherein most people can understand what is being talked about.Other documentaries are about people who against the odds do something great that everyone will remember them by.This documentary combines both in a very interesting mix. Through interviews with his mother and sister we get a good insight into his life as a teenager and part of college. From his fellow students we learn more about him as a student at Oxford and Cambridge (with not the best grades btw). From colleagues we learn what a brilliant mind he was.Hawking is the only person to really talk about both sides, about how his disease (ALS) developed and also how he came up with his brilliant ideas, also fully admitting where he was wrong.The maker of this movie has made a very good mix of a biography of Stephen Hawking but inbetween also a good explenation of time, black holes and such that even someone with no feeling for math and physics can understand.",3,Biography and Science,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1038,"['Many', 'documentaries', 'focus', 'scientific', 'ideas', 'person', 'trying', 'explain', 'audience', 'wherein', 'most', 'people', 'can', 'understand', 'what', 'being', 'talked', 'documentaries', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'odds', 'do', 'something', 'great', 'everyone', 'will', 'remember', 'by.This', 'documentary', 'combines', 'very', 'interesting', 'mix', 'interviews', 'mother', 'sister', 'get', 'good', 'insight', 'life', 'teenager', 'part', 'college', 'fellow', 'students', 'learn', 'more', 'about', 'student', 'Oxford', 'Cambridge', 'not', 'best', 'grades', 'btw', 'colleagues', 'learn', 'what', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'was.Hawking', 'only', 'person', 'really', 'talk', 'sides', 'how', 'disease', 'ALS', 'developed', 'also', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'brilliant', 'ideas', 'also', 'fully', 'admitting', 'where', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'maker', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'mix', 'biography', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'inbetween', 'also', 'good', 'explenation', 'time', 'black', 'holes', 'such', 'even', 'someone', 'feeling', 'math', 'physics', 'can', 'understand']",A Brief History of Time VHS

329133,A114YQ7ZT9Y1W5,6302718805,Steiner,"[2, 2]","A very fine and intriguing documentary from Errol Morris about the life and work of physicist/celebrity Stephen Hawking, who revolutionized the way we think about the universe in his monumental book of the same name. The film is really divided into two stories, the life of Hawking as he struggles to overcome his paralysis, and the brilliant work he achieved in spite of his physical limitations. One gets the impression that had Hawking never became ill, he wouldn't have been as compelled to carry out the kind rigorous intellectual work that he of course did carry out, and (he himself notes that he was quite bored with life prior to his paralysis). Morris does a fine job with the material; the first half hour of the film suffers from a dry PBS feel, but the aesthetic and intellectual intensity takes off from there, the film never digresses into a mere sob story. Morris nearly always keeps the material more intellectually intriguing than it is uplifting and sentimental.",3,Interesting Look,1130457600,"10 28, 2005",2005,981,"['very', 'fine', 'intriguing', 'documentary', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'life', 'work', 'physicist/celebrity', 'Stephen', 'Hawking', 'who', 'revolutionized', 'way', 'think', 'universe', 'monumental', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'film', 'really', 'divided', 'two', 'stories', 'life', 'Hawking', 'overcome', 'paralysis', 'brilliant', 'work', 'achieved', 'spite', 'physical', 'limitations', 'One', 'impression', 'had', 'Hawking', 'never', 'became', 'ill', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'as', 'compelled', 'carry', 'out', 'kind', 'rigorous', 'intellectual', 'work', 'course', 'did', 'carry', 'out', 'was', 'quite', 'bored', 'life', 'prior', 'paralysis', 'Morris', 'fine', 'job', 'material', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'suffers', 'dry', 'PBS', 'feel', 'aesthetic', 'intellectual', 'intensity', 'film', 'never', 'mere', 'sob', 'story', 'Morris', 'nearly', 'always', 'material', 'more', 'intellectually', 'intriguing', 'uplifting', 'sentimental']",A Brief History of Time VHS
