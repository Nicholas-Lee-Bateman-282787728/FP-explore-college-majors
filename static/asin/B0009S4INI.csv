912224,AO7RFXGXSY3LN,B0009S4INI,"Amy Wallace ""Buttonsamy""","[51, 61]","I was reccomended this title a few years ago, before it came out on DVD. I searched high and low but found not a trace of it. Finally, I saw it was available here at long last! I purchased it without ever seeing a minute, and I was not too dissapointed.This story is all about an heiress, Clarissa who is innocent enough to make you want to strangle her. She is the perfect lady, with morals and values. Of course, she runs into the most devious and seductive man who wants to charm her out of her virtues and her inheritance, while still sneaking around with her friends and relatives on the side.Though the story begins a little slow, the costumes and settings are charming. The BBC always does an exquisite job of being period accurate when they make these long costume dramas! The house is gorgeous, the dresses are gorgeous, even the ugly men wearing HUGE puffy wigs are gorgeous.A quick plot summary: Clarissa is the heiress to her father's fortune, which makes her sister and brother (possibly having an incestuous relationship?!?) VERY jealous and angry. They begin to plot against her. Enter Mr. Lovelace. Mr. Lovelace is a ""bad guy"", who was making advances on Clarissa's sister. He quickly breaks off their attachment to persue Clarissa, for her fortune at first. As time goes on, Clarrisa denied her inheritance, and tortured by her family to marry a toad-like suitor. When she refuses, all hell breaks loose. Mr. Lovelace undertsnads this predicament and offers to help Clarissa by running away with her.  Throught the movie, Mr. Lovelace has to fight his true feelings for Clarissa (love) and his feelings to rape her (his usual way). His fight with his own feelings are apparent, and Sean Bean is excellent.I will watch anything with costumes and a decent story though, so I will let you be the judge. If you enjoyed films like The Forsyte Saga, Dangerous Liasions, Valmont, He Knew He Was Right and other period BBC slow-moving sagas, then this DVD is for you.",5,Clarissa well worth the wait,1125360000,"08 30, 2005",2005,1976,"['was', 'reccomended', 'title', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'searched', 'high', 'low', 'found', 'not', 'trace', 'Finally', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'here', 'long', 'last', 'purchased', 'ever', 'seeing', 'minute', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'dissapointed.This', 'story', 'heiress', 'Clarissa', 'who', 'innocent', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'strangle', 'perfect', 'lady', 'morals', 'values', 'course', 'most', 'devious', 'seductive', 'man', 'who', 'charm', 'virtues', 'inheritance', 'still', 'sneaking', 'friends', 'relatives', 'side.Though', 'story', 'little', 'slow', 'costumes', 'settings', 'are', 'charming', 'BBC', 'always', 'exquisite', 'job', 'being', 'period', 'accurate', 'when', 'make', 'long', 'costume', 'dramas', 'house', 'gorgeous', 'dresses', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'ugly', 'men', 'wearing', 'HUGE', 'puffy', 'wigs', 'are', 'gorgeous.A', 'quick', 'plot', 'summary', 'Clarissa', 'heiress', 'father', 'fortune', 'sister', 'brother', 'possibly', 'having', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'VERY', 'jealous', 'angry', 'begin', 'plot', 'Enter', 'Mr.', 'Lovelace', 'Mr.', 'Lovelace', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'making', 'advances', 'Clarissa', 'sister', 'quickly', 'breaks', 'off', 'attachment', 'persue', 'Clarissa', 'fortune', 'first', 'time', 'Clarrisa', 'denied', 'inheritance', 'tortured', 'family', 'marry', 'toad-like', 'suitor', 'When', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'Mr.', 'Lovelace', 'predicament', 'help', 'Clarissa', 'running', 'away', 'Throught', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Lovelace', 'fight', 'true', 'feelings', 'Clarissa', 'love', 'feelings', 'rape', 'usual', 'way', 'fight', 'own', 'feelings', 'are', 'apparent', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'excellent.I', 'will', 'watch', 'anything', 'costumes', 'decent', 'story', 'will', 'let', 'be', 'judge', 'enjoyed', 'films', 'Forsyte', 'Saga', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', 'Valmont', 'Knew', 'Was', 'Right', 'other', 'period', 'BBC', 'slow-moving', 'sagas', 'then', 'DVD']",N/A
912225,AAGK7UK5BHSX4,B0009S4INI,"Born-Identity ""19973""","[26, 31]","Yes hated.  I'm at a disavantage having not read the book, but I have to say this movie was not what I expected at all.  I have never felt prompted to write a bad review EVER until now (sorry Sean Bean - whose work I usually love). I hate I bought the DVD instead of renting it first.*The below review is my opinion and contains spoiler info*I'm not the kind of movie watcher who has to have a happy ending because I understand it doesn't always happen in real life, so it doesn't have to happen for me in a movie. In addition to that, I also love a great character study even if some of the characters are of ill-repute. However, this movie was long, drawn out and ALL of the characters REALLY got on my nerves.  I found myself not caring for, wanting to understand or LIKING any of them early on.  I have no problem watching movies where in order for the story to unfold, the viewer must get a little dirty as he/she follows the characters.  I found the characters exhausting in just TRYING to find any reason to care what each one did or didn't do next.  The end result was disturbing in which you wanted to watch Brady Bunch afterwards just to get rid of the dark filthy oppressive feeling you had afterwards. Neither character was believable in their diligence to maintain or obtain what each lived for. Neither character was someone I could sympathize with (which is saying a lot since one of them was held down by a group while being raped! All for love?) I don't see how this movie can benefit anyone on any level.  Again, I can only write an opinion based on this movie version, as I have not read the book.  For all I know, the book may incite compassion and sympathy from it's reader towards one or all of the characters whether they are the victim or the victimizer. This movie does not. It makes you angry that you were ever introduced to either character, angry that it was ever put on film and angry that you wasted any of your time watching it.",1,I hated this movie.,1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,1960,"['Yes', 'hated', ""'m"", 'disavantage', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'prompted', 'write', 'bad', 'review', 'EVER', 'now', 'sorry', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'work', 'usually', 'love', 'hate', 'bought', 'DVD', 'instead', 'renting', 'first', '*The', 'review', 'opinion', 'spoiler', 'info*I', ""'m"", 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'watcher', 'who', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'understand', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'have', 'happen', 'movie', 'addition', 'also', 'love', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'ill-repute', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'characters', 'REALLY', 'got', 'nerves', 'found', 'not', 'caring', 'wanting', 'understand', 'LIKING', 'early', 'have', 'problem', 'watching', 'movies', 'where', 'order', 'story', 'unfold', 'viewer', 'must', 'get', 'little', 'dirty', 'he/she', 'characters', 'found', 'characters', 'exhausting', 'just', 'TRYING', 'find', 'reason', 'care', 'what', 'one', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'next', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'disturbing', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'afterwards', 'just', 'get', 'rid', 'dark', 'filthy', 'oppressive', 'feeling', 'had', 'afterwards', 'character', 'was', 'believable', 'diligence', 'maintain', 'obtain', 'what', 'lived', 'character', 'was', 'someone', 'could', 'sympathize', 'saying', 'lot', 'one', 'was', 'held', 'down', 'group', 'being', 'raped', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'can', 'benefit', 'anyone', 'level', 'Again', 'can', 'only', 'write', 'opinion', 'based', 'movie', 'version', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'book', 'may', 'incite', 'compassion', 'sympathy', 'reader', 'towards', 'one', 'characters', 'are', 'victim', 'victimizer', 'movie', 'not', 'angry', 'were', 'ever', 'introduced', 'character', 'angry', 'was', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'angry', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching']",N/A
912226,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0009S4INI,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Samuel Richardson's CLARISSA is the original tale of Regency revenge and lust, setting the template for the more-familiar ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""Valmont"" which followed shortly after.  This 1991 BBC miniseries stars Sean Bean as the carnally sexual Lovelace, who sets his sights on a virtuous beauty and leads them both down a path to ultimate destruction.Clarissa Harlowe (Saskia Wickham) is the picture of beauty and innocence, and carries a loyal heart that's just as gentle as her exterior.  That is precisely what attracts the attention of Lovelace (Sean Bean), a callow womaniser who decides to bed, soil and discard the girl purely to satisfy his own ego.  When Clarissa inherits the bulk of her grandfather's fortune, her jealous brother and sister (Jonny Phillips and Lynsey Baxter) manipulate Clarissa into Lovelace's clutches by making her a virtual prisoner in the family home.  When Lovelace finally ""dashes to the rescue"", Clarissa's fate is sealed.  Banished from the family and virtually struck from the record altogether, Clarissa is installed as a guest in the London whorehouse where Lovelace is a frequent customer.  The girl proves too steadfast in her convictions, however, leading Lovelace to new depths in his quest to seduce her...It's not the most lighthearted fare - in fact it's almost too depressing - but CLARISSA is a mesmerizing costume drama for fans of the genre.  This was one of Sean Bean's first real acting assignments of note and he delivers a rich performance.  Saskia Wickman's acting career seems to have turned into a more low-key affair (lots of guest spots on various British TV shows) but sadly nothing else to really equal the scale of her monumental Clarissa Harlowe.  She was (or was shortly to be) married to CLARISSA's director Robert Bierman.If you appreciate costume drama you'll really need to add this to your collection.",4,"""You once told me adversity was my shining time, and so I think it is""",1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,1879,"['Samuel', 'Richardson', 'CLARISSA', 'original', 'tale', 'Regency', 'revenge', 'lust', 'setting', 'template', 'more-familiar', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'Valmont', 'followed', 'shortly', '1991', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'carnally', 'sexual', 'Lovelace', 'who', 'sights', 'virtuous', 'beauty', 'down', 'path', 'ultimate', 'destruction.Clarissa', 'Harlowe', 'Saskia', 'Wickham', 'picture', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'loyal', 'heart', 'just', 'as', 'gentle', 'exterior', 'precisely', 'what', 'attention', 'Lovelace', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'callow', 'womaniser', 'who', 'bed', 'soil', 'discard', 'girl', 'purely', 'satisfy', 'own', 'ego', 'When', 'Clarissa', 'bulk', 'grandfather', 'fortune', 'jealous', 'brother', 'sister', 'Jonny', 'Phillips', 'Lynsey', 'Baxter', 'manipulate', 'Clarissa', 'Lovelace', 'clutches', 'making', 'virtual', 'prisoner', 'family', 'home', 'When', 'Lovelace', 'finally', 'dashes', 'rescue', 'Clarissa', 'fate', 'sealed', 'Banished', 'family', 'virtually', 'struck', 'record', 'altogether', 'Clarissa', 'installed', 'guest', 'London', 'whorehouse', 'where', 'Lovelace', 'frequent', 'customer', 'girl', 'proves', 'too', 'steadfast', 'convictions', 'however', 'leading', 'Lovelace', 'new', 'depths', 'quest', 'seduce', 'not', 'most', 'lighthearted', 'fare', 'fact', 'almost', 'too', 'depressing', 'CLARISSA', 'mesmerizing', 'costume', 'drama', 'fans', 'genre', 'was', 'one', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'first', 'real', 'acting', 'assignments', 'note', 'rich', 'performance', 'Saskia', 'Wickman', 'acting', 'career', 'have', 'turned', 'more', 'low-key', 'affair', 'lots', 'guest', 'spots', 'various', 'British', 'TV', 'shows', 'sadly', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'equal', 'scale', 'monumental', 'Clarissa', 'Harlowe', 'was', 'was', 'shortly', 'be', 'married', 'CLARISSA', 'director', 'Robert', 'Bierman.If', 'appreciate', 'costume', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'really', 'need', 'add', 'collection']",N/A
912227,A1N37L78ZREG8Y,B0009S4INI,Carolyn Paetow,"[6, 9]","There is definitely bodice-ripping in this mini-series, but not the kind most females fawn over in period-piece fiction!  That said, as with most BBC offerings, it is well casted, performed, and costumed.  One may perceive a quandry with the production, however, which may simply be the result of a modern eye misted by too many steamy, contemporarily-penned, historical novels. This possible problem (for some viewers) is that the story breezes through its first half with the atmosphere of an airy, rogue-versus-maiden romance and then, in the second, slogs into a sturm-and-drang melodrama. Some characters are so utterly bad-to-the-bone or irredeemably ridiculous that the plot, at times, seems sprinkled with absurdist comedy.  Then, other roles have such a vampirish, schizophrenic quality that the story seems swept into a maelstrom of confused direction.  Thus, the characters' motivations, intentions, and true feelings appear fogged almost to the point of surreality.  Whether the result of a classic (or dated) mentality, this can be said:  if one lives for the hauntingly offbeat, Clarissa should provide a strong gust of fresh air.

The direction, acting, script and recreation of the era are simply stupendous.  The acting, in particular is wonderful.

In fact, the entire cast is wonderful.I've never read Samuel Richardson's book; however, I do feel that this presentation does a stupendous job in its portrayal of the subject matter.  I certainly got a very strong sense from this presentation that women in the 18th century were, for the most part, mere chattel with not very many human rights.  Even if they had money, their lives were controlled by men even if the men were nothing more than scoundrels.

A world where there are not also happy endings and nice people.The character of Clarissa is played to perfection by Saskia. Not for her acting I probably wouldn't have cried for most of episode 3! She plays the role of a woman who is happy to forsake men for her own beliefs and faith. Her family though, who through the generations have become a highstanding family, see Clarissa as a means to acquiring more money and land. Her brother and sister conspire against her and it is her fmaily that leave Clarissa with little choice to be rescued by Lovelace - a decision which she regrets.The saddest thing about this entire movie is the fact that you know what Lovelace's plan is. He has no love for Clarissa, just a desire to break her as a woman as evident with his discussions with his friend Jack.Many have commented on the rape scene - and I did find it confronting myself as it does appear to happen in a line of events rather quickly - but it is where the story has headed since the beginning and is done to show the true nature of Lovelace and bring out the humanity in Jack.Eventually Clarissa gets the forgiveness of her family, but it is all too late - and no matter what her father does, he knows it will never be right.This is certainly a film for adults, not children due to content, but it does tell the story of the darker side of history which many would prefer not to acknowledge.I say buy it (and 2 boxes of tissues!).",5,The darker side of history,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,1597,"['am', 'fan', 'lighter', 'more', 'romantic', 'tales', 'set', 'era', 'Clarissa', 'out', 'showing', 'side', 'history', 'would', 'wish', 'forget', 'world', 'where', 'are', 'not', 'also', 'happy', 'endings', 'nice', 'people.The', 'character', 'Clarissa', 'played', 'perfection', 'Saskia', 'Not', 'acting', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cried', 'most', 'episode', '3', 'role', 'woman', 'who', 'happy', 'forsake', 'men', 'own', 'beliefs', 'faith', 'family', 'who', 'generations', 'have', 'become', 'highstanding', 'family', 'see', 'Clarissa', 'means', 'acquiring', 'more', 'money', 'land', 'brother', 'sister', 'conspire', 'fmaily', 'leave', 'Clarissa', 'little', 'choice', 'be', 'rescued', 'Lovelace', 'decision', 'saddest', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'fact', 'know', 'what', 'Lovelace', 'plan', 'love', 'Clarissa', 'just', 'desire', 'break', 'woman', 'evident', 'discussions', 'friend', 'Jack.Many', 'have', 'commented', 'rape', 'scene', 'did', 'find', 'confronting', 'appear', 'happen', 'line', 'events', 'rather', 'quickly', 'where', 'story', 'headed', 'beginning', 'done', 'show', 'true', 'nature', 'Lovelace', 'bring', 'out', 'humanity', 'Jack.Eventually', 'Clarissa', 'forgiveness', 'family', 'all', 'too', 'late', 'matter', 'what', 'father', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'right.This', 'certainly', 'film', 'adults', 'not', 'children', 'due', 'content', 'tell', 'story', 'darker', 'side', 'history', 'many', 'would', 'prefer', 'not', 'acknowledge.I', 'say', 'buy', '2', 'boxes', 'tissues']",N/A

912236,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,B0009S4INI,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[5, 7]","Wonderful made for TV series tells the classic tale of a young upper class woman Clarissa.  Clarissa is a young lady brought up in a wealthy family, of exceptional virtue.  She is so pure and innocent that her grandfather decides to leave her all of his wealth.  This of course, is a time in England when women (wives and daughters) were property of their fathers and brothers.  In spite of her wealth, Clarissa is persuaded by her parents that she should submit control of her wealth to her family that will manage her money for her.  This turns out to be her death sentence.  Her siblings, father and uncle are angry for being left out from the will.  To test her obedience, Clarissa's family promises her to a marriage to another wealthy man.  This man is repulsive in more ways than one and Clarissa is desparate to find a way to avoid this marriage.  Her (female) friends cannot be her protectors so she is forced to turn to a man for protection.  This man, wealthy and handsome himself, is obsessed with seducing and abandoning Clarissa for the sake of humiliating her and satisfying his own ego.  As the turn of events ends tragic, one cannot stop and think how women's lives, 200 years later have improved so much (at least in the western hemisphere).  Any woman, after watching these series or reading a book, will be delighted to learn that in today's world women are free to make their own decisions and the ""female virtue"" itself is re-defined.  Women are no one's property and with education women can be independant to the point where women can not only manage their money, but also make lots of it their professional careers.  Definitely series that will get one thinking about difference between past and present.  It is also a story of greed and devastating consequences it can bring to friends, family and lovers.",4,Young lady's life in 18th century,1204588800,"03 4, 2008",2008,1831,"['Wonderful', 'made', 'TV', 'series', 'classic', 'tale', 'young', 'upper', 'class', 'woman', 'Clarissa', 'Clarissa', 'young', 'lady', 'brought', 'up', 'wealthy', 'family', 'exceptional', 'virtue', 'so', 'pure', 'innocent', 'grandfather', 'leave', 'wealth', 'course', 'time', 'England', 'when', 'women', 'wives', 'daughters', 'were', 'property', 'fathers', 'brothers', 'spite', 'wealth', 'Clarissa', 'persuaded', 'parents', 'should', 'submit', 'control', 'wealth', 'family', 'will', 'manage', 'money', 'out', 'be', 'death', 'sentence', 'siblings', 'father', 'uncle', 'are', 'angry', 'being', 'left', 'out', 'will', 'test', 'obedience', 'Clarissa', 'family', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'man', 'man', 'repulsive', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Clarissa', 'desparate', 'find', 'way', 'avoid', 'marriage', 'Her', 'female', 'friends', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'protectors', 'forced', 'turn', 'man', 'protection', 'man', 'wealthy', 'handsome', 'obsessed', 'seducing', 'abandoning', 'Clarissa', 'sake', 'humiliating', 'satisfying', 'own', 'ego', 'turn', 'events', 'tragic', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'think', 'how', 'women', 'lives', '200', 'years', 'later', 'have', 'improved', 'so', 'much', 'least', 'western', 'hemisphere', 'woman', 'watching', 'series', 'reading', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'learn', 'today', 'world', 'women', 'are', 'free', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'female', 'virtue', 're-defined', 'Women', 'are', 'one', 'property', 'education', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'independant', 'point', 'where', 'women', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'manage', 'money', 'also', 'make', 'lots', 'professional', 'careers', 'Definitely', 'series', 'will', 'get', 'one', 'thinking', 'difference', 'past', 'present', 'also', 'story', 'greed', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'can', 'bring', 'friends', 'family', 'lovers']",N/A

912239,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0009S4INI,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 7]","Based on one of the (allegedly) longest novels in Anglo canon, ""Clarrisa"" tells the tragic story of a woman whose beauty is matched only by her virtue.  (How tragic?  Let's just say that in the novel, told in a series of letters, the reading of a character's will takes up an entire chapter, or a dozen chapters worth of what you'd find in a contemporary novel.)This TV movie (which I caught years ago on ""Masterpiece Theater"") has a fascinating take on Regency-era England - unwilling to commit to an utterly bleak view or go the ribald ""Tom Jones"" route or even mix the two, ""Clarissa"" starts out light and then suddenly, shockingly, enters utter darkness.  The suddenly-rich Harlowes, eager to cement their place in society, plan to marry off their lovely daughter, Clarissa, as soon as possible.  Clarissa is already marked by fate when her grandfather bequeaths everything to her - passing over her two vindictive siblings.  ""Clarry"" compounds this error by turning over everything to her father - making James and Bella all the more eager to work their frustrations out on their sister by forcing her into an unwanted marriage with the unlikable Solmes.  (In the novel, he's described as obese, and his marriage proposals are rejected even by women of lower social and financial standing than Clarissa; the movie is crueler - imagine one of those rotting corpses you often see haunting the Indiana Jones movies, dress it up ala 18th century, top it off with a peruke, give it a horrific smile, and you've got your man, unfortunately.  One look at the man and you realize how James and Bella must really have it in for her.)To the rescue comes the dashing Lovelace (that name is already a red flag).  Worldly, apparently independent, unspeakably handsome and fearless.  He makes his feelings for Clarry clear, knowing that this will increase her attraction to him.  At this point, the story has that purposefully awkward taste, like a British farce, with Clarry as the prize, James and Bella as the antagonists, Solmes as the comic relied and Lovelace as the hero.  Unfortunately for everybody involved, the story takes a nosedive into Baroque Tragedy.  Lovelace is in every way the soulless rake - literally - he denies the existence of the soul and is determined to conquer Clarissa in flesh and mind.  Clarry is only the latest of Lovelace's conquests - women who began life as girls with small flaws enlarged into gaping chasms of fire and filth when defiled by Lovelace.  Unfortunately for Lovelace, Clarissa very fiercely holds to the idea of a soul and shields it behind the fortitude of her virtues.  With each assault on her body, Lovelace both pushes Clarissa's soul away and realizes a deepening lover for it.  Can this doomed romance end happily?  (Suffice it to say that the novel carried an extended post-text decrying what we now fatuously call the ""Hollywood Ending"".)This adaptation seems short given the original's infamous length, though its brevity can be seen as a saving grace.  Clarissa here seems less virtuous than childish.  Her vindictive sibs don't seem all that bad even if the consequences of their actions are as destructive - which drives home the point that even shallow caprice can lead to great evil.  The high point of this sped-up version is the defilement of our heroine.  Like a train wreck, the assault on Clarry comes out of nowhere with shocking speed.  You can feel its approach and you beg yourself to look away even as you know you can't.  You know that the roguish Lovelace only appears to be subtle, but it isn't until he commits The Overt Act that you realize how monstrously unsubtle he is.  The Clarissa of the novel has plenty of time to build her case for the inviolate soul, sliding the story into the realm of classic tragedy, while the movie's Clarry hasn't enough time or emotional reserve to convince us that her belief isn't anything more than a convenient and protective delusion against her violation.  Instead of slipping into tragedy, the film drives full-speed into the shadow of an endless chasm.  Even Lovelace's descent into expiation seems especially poignant here - the script probably wanted to suggest a happy ending, but it more suggests what we wanted to think all along, namely that for the agony wreaked on others, Lovelace remains his own worst victim.This was a great production - setting and costuming were top-notch without getting in the way of the story.  Sean Bean was probably a natural choice to play the wicked Lovelace - though he excels above type.  As Clarissa, Saskia Wickham will break your heart.  Definitely for those who want to revisit that era in fiction without having to take the way through Austen or Bronte territory.",4,Fast and Dark,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,4720,"['Based', 'one', 'allegedly', 'longest', 'novels', 'Anglo', 'canon', 'Clarrisa', 'tragic', 'story', 'woman', 'beauty', 'matched', 'only', 'virtue', 'How', 'tragic', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'novel', 'told', 'series', 'letters', 'reading', 'character', 'will', 'up', 'entire', 'chapter', 'dozen', 'chapters', 'what', ""'d"", 'find', 'contemporary', 'novel', 'TV', 'movie', 'caught', 'years', 'ago', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'fascinating', 'take', 'Regency-era', 'England', 'unwilling', 'commit', 'utterly', 'bleak', 'view', 'go', 'ribald', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'route', 'even', 'mix', 'two', 'Clarissa', 'out', 'light', 'then', 'suddenly', 'shockingly', 'enters', 'utter', 'darkness', 'suddenly-rich', 'Harlowes', 'eager', 'cement', 'place', 'society', 'plan', 'marry', 'off', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Clarissa', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'Clarissa', 'already', 'marked', 'fate', 'when', 'grandfather', 'bequeaths', 'everything', 'passing', 'two', 'vindictive', 'siblings', 'Clarry', 'error', 'turning', 'over', 'everything', 'father', 'making', 'James', 'Bella', 'more', 'eager', 'work', 'frustrations', 'out', 'sister', 'forcing', 'unwanted', 'marriage', 'unlikable', 'Solmes', 'novel', 'described', 'obese', 'marriage', 'proposals', 'are', 'rejected', 'even', 'women', 'lower', 'social', 'financial', 'standing', 'Clarissa', 'movie', 'crueler', 'imagine', 'one', 'rotting', 'corpses', 'often', 'see', 'haunting', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'movies', 'dress', 'ala', '18th', 'century', 'top', 'off', 'peruke', 'give', 'horrific', 'smile', ""'ve"", 'got', 'man', 'unfortunately', 'One', 'look', 'man', 'realize', 'how', 'James', 'Bella', 'must', 'really', 'have', 'rescue', 'dashing', 'Lovelace', 'name', 'already', 'red', 'flag', 'Worldly', 'apparently', 'independent', 'unspeakably', 'handsome', 'fearless', 'feelings', 'Clarry', 'clear', 'knowing', 'will', 'increase', 'attraction', 'point', 'story', 'purposefully', 'awkward', 'taste', 'British', 'farce', 'Clarry', 'prize', 'James', 'Bella', 'antagonists', 'Solmes', 'comic', 'relied', 'Lovelace', 'hero', 'Unfortunately', 'everybody', 'involved', 'story', 'nosedive', 'Baroque', 'Tragedy', 'Lovelace', 'way', 'soulless', 'rake', 'literally', 'existence', 'soul', 'determined', 'conquer', 'Clarissa', 'flesh', 'mind', 'Clarry', 'only', 'latest', 'Lovelace', 'conquests', 'women', 'who', 'began', 'life', 'girls', 'small', 'flaws', 'enlarged', 'gaping', 'chasms', 'fire', 'filth', 'when', 'defiled', 'Lovelace', 'Unfortunately', 'Lovelace', 'Clarissa', 'very', 'fiercely', 'idea', 'soul', 'shields', 'fortitude', 'virtues', 'assault', 'body', 'Lovelace', 'pushes', 'Clarissa', 'soul', 'away', 'deepening', 'lover', 'Can', 'doomed', 'romance', 'end', 'happily', 'Suffice', 'say', 'novel', 'carried', 'extended', 'post-text', 'decrying', 'what', 'now', 'fatuously', 'call', 'Hollywood', 'Ending', 'adaptation', 'short', 'given', 'original', 'infamous', 'length', 'brevity', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'saving', 'grace', 'Clarissa', 'here', 'less', 'virtuous', 'childish', 'vindictive', 'sibs', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad', 'even', 'consequences', 'actions', 'are', 'destructive', 'home', 'point', 'even', 'shallow', 'caprice', 'can', 'lead', 'great', 'evil', 'high', 'point', 'sped-up', 'version', 'defilement', 'heroine', 'train', 'wreck', 'assault', 'Clarry', 'nowhere', 'shocking', 'speed', 'can', 'feel', 'approach', 'beg', 'look', 'away', 'even', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'roguish', 'Lovelace', 'only', 'be', 'subtle', ""n't"", 'Overt', 'Act', 'realize', 'how', 'monstrously', 'unsubtle', 'Clarissa', 'novel', 'plenty', 'time', 'build', 'case', 'inviolate', 'soul', 'sliding', 'story', 'realm', 'classic', 'tragedy', 'movie', 'Clarry', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'emotional', 'reserve', 'convince', 'belief', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'convenient', 'protective', 'delusion', 'violation', 'Instead', 'slipping', 'tragedy', 'film', 'full-speed', 'shadow', 'endless', 'chasm', 'Even', 'Lovelace', 'descent', 'expiation', 'especially', 'poignant', 'here', 'script', 'probably', 'wanted', 'suggest', 'happy', 'ending', 'more', 'what', 'wanted', 'think', 'along', 'namely', 'agony', 'wreaked', 'others', 'Lovelace', 'own', 'worst', 'victim.This', 'was', 'great', 'production', 'setting', 'costuming', 'were', 'top-notch', 'getting', 'way', 'story', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'was', 'probably', 'natural', 'choice', 'play', 'wicked', 'Lovelace', 'type', 'Clarissa', 'Saskia', 'Wickham', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'Definitely', 'who', 'want', 'revisit', 'era', 'fiction', 'having', 'take', 'way', 'Austen', 'Bronte', 'territory']",N/A

912242,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B0009S4INI,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[16, 16]","Set in the 18th century and based on Samuel Richardson's novel from the same period, Clarissa is a superb 1991 four-part British production (with 50-minute episodes) about a wealthy but lustful, vile rogue's attempt to conquer a pure and virtuous woman; or, on a more basic level, it is the attempt of vice to conquer virtue.  Clarissa, our beautiful heroine, is a good, dutiful and pious woman who, for her kindness and virtue, has, as the story opens, become the heir to her grandfather's fortune--to the exclusion and envy of her spiteful brother and sister, her parents, and her uncle, all of whom have conspired to take their revenge by attempting to force Clarissa into marriage with an intolerable, ugly, fopish idiot.  The irony is that Clarissa really does not want her grandfather's money; certainly she does not desire marriage.Coincident with the reading of her grandfather's will, Clarissa has become the latest object of desire of Robert Lovelace (Sean Bean--Sharpe, Essex Boys, Bravo Two Zero, Extremely Dangerous, Fool's Gold)  a rake and a scoundrel who lives for the hunt--in all its incarnations.  His view of women is no different from his view of the birds he shoots from the sky--both exist for his sport.  He's a man who enjoys a challenge and savours the deflowering of chaste young women--whether by fair means or foul.Clarissa is no fool.  Lovelace's reputation precedes him, and Clarissa wants nothing to do with him.  Tragically, however, the intolerable position she is put in by her family forces her to turn to Lovelace for help.  For Lovelace, it is all a game, and one's blood runs cold when his kind words to Clarissa are juxtaposed with his pub talk--talk which reveals a calculating mind, a cold heart, and a cruel inhumanity.  Lovelace is vice personified.  He is immoral and deceitful, full of trickery and treachery; most frightening of all, however, is that he is amoral, with no discernable concept of what's right from wrong.  Whilst the game is innocent enough at the start (from Lovelace's perspective!), it soon spirals out of control and Lovelace himself becomes a victim of his own trap, ensnared by his own growing obsession.Noteworthy DVD extras include a few brief outtakes, Bean's and Wickham's screen tests, and text-based (but very interesting) production notes.In conclusion, this is an outstanding period drama--one which I found to be very satisfying.  It is an engrossing, captivating tale peppered with an abundance of beautifully rich, witty dialogue.  The acting is impeccable; indeed, of all the villains Sean Bean has portrayed, I can think of none so vile, so utterly loathesome as that of Robert Lovelace.  Yet for all that, Lovelace is a complex character, and there are moments, however brief, when something akin to goodness attempts to break through.Mandatory viewing for fans of Sean Bean, and highly recommended to all fans of quality, intelligent British productions--or indeed to anyone who enjoys period productions in general.",5,"An Outstanding, Chilling, Rivetting British Period Drama!",1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,3000,"['Set', '18th', 'century', 'based', 'Samuel', 'Richardson', 'novel', 'same', 'period', 'Clarissa', 'superb', '1991', 'four-part', 'British', 'production', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'wealthy', 'lustful', 'vile', 'rogue', 'attempt', 'conquer', 'pure', 'virtuous', 'woman', 'more', 'basic', 'level', 'attempt', 'vice', 'conquer', 'virtue', 'Clarissa', 'beautiful', 'heroine', 'good', 'dutiful', 'pious', 'woman', 'who', 'kindness', 'virtue', 'story', 'become', 'heir', 'grandfather', 'fortune', 'exclusion', 'envy', 'spiteful', 'brother', 'sister', 'parents', 'uncle', 'whom', 'have', 'conspired', 'take', 'revenge', 'attempting', 'force', 'Clarissa', 'marriage', 'intolerable', 'ugly', 'fopish', 'idiot', 'irony', 'Clarissa', 'really', 'not', 'want', 'grandfather', 'money', 'certainly', 'not', 'desire', 'marriage.Coincident', 'reading', 'grandfather', 'will', 'Clarissa', 'become', 'latest', 'object', 'desire', 'Robert', 'Lovelace', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Sharpe', 'Essex', 'Boys', 'Bravo', 'Two', 'Zero', 'Extremely', 'Dangerous', 'Fool', 'Gold', 'rake', 'scoundrel', 'who', 'hunt', 'incarnations', 'view', 'women', 'different', 'view', 'birds', 'sky', 'exist', 'sport', 'man', 'who', 'challenge', 'deflowering', 'chaste', 'young', 'women', 'fair', 'means', 'foul.Clarissa', 'fool', 'Lovelace', 'reputation', 'Clarissa', 'nothing', 'do', 'Tragically', 'however', 'intolerable', 'position', 'put', 'family', 'turn', 'Lovelace', 'help', 'Lovelace', 'game', 'one', 'blood', 'runs', 'cold', 'when', 'kind', 'words', 'Clarissa', 'are', 'juxtaposed', 'pub', 'talk', 'talk', 'calculating', 'mind', 'cold', 'heart', 'cruel', 'inhumanity', 'Lovelace', 'vice', 'personified', 'immoral', 'deceitful', 'full', 'trickery', 'treachery', 'most', 'frightening', 'however', 'amoral', 'discernable', 'concept', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'Whilst', 'game', 'innocent', 'enough', 'start', 'Lovelace', 'perspective', 'soon', 'control', 'Lovelace', 'victim', 'own', 'trap', 'ensnared', 'own', 'growing', 'obsession.Noteworthy', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'few', 'brief', 'outtakes', 'Bean', 'Wickham', 'screen', 'tests', 'text-based', 'very', 'interesting', 'production', 'notes.In', 'conclusion', 'outstanding', 'period', 'drama', 'one', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying', 'engrossing', 'captivating', 'tale', 'peppered', 'abundance', 'beautifully', 'rich', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'impeccable', 'indeed', 'villains', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'portrayed', 'can', 'think', 'none', 'so', 'vile', 'so', 'utterly', 'loathesome', 'Robert', 'Lovelace', 'Lovelace', 'complex', 'character', 'are', 'moments', 'however', 'brief', 'when', 'something', 'akin', 'goodness', 'attempts', 'break', 'through.Mandatory', 'viewing', 'fans', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'quality', 'intelligent', 'British', 'productions', 'indeed', 'anyone', 'who', 'period', 'productions', 'general']",N/A
