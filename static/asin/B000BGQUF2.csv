941886,A11KAB0Y2RR2DK,B000BGQUF2,"Alester Buckman ""Horror buff""","[0, 0]","I recall this movie from when it came out.  I have waited to add it to my collection for years and finally had the chance.  I guess it is saying something to view it today and find it wanting after all these years.The plot is very slow and holds onto the old scary movie based on the ""monster-in-the-dark"" theme and not the blood soaked fims of today.  In fact, I don't recall seeing the creatures until the end of the picture, and then I didn't get a very good look at them.  It has dated poorly and almost looks completely fake, even the actual outdoor scenes.  I actually had to recheck the date to be sure it hadn't been made in the 1950s.  However, I'm a fan of bad movies so I just chalked it up to ""poor memory"" and relaxed with it.  There was no serious language issues or even violence.  It wasn't until the ""nudie lovemaking"" scene that I hit the pause button.  Then the fast-forward.  I guess the maker felt it was needed, but I think we could have used someone younger for this scene.  I'm guessing not too many are going to enjoy seeing a 50-year-old couple get it on.  Thankfully, it didn't last long or show much.  Then it was back to the lab to hunt the monster.The ending was still a twist though.  It was a little hard to swallow, but then the date pretty much covered that end too.  If radiation could make giant ants and such, why not have a twisted ending like this one.  Shoot, I ain't gonna spoil it for ya, just in case you do want to see it.

941887,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000BGQUF2,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[6, 8]","Here's part of the product description for the film Bog (1983), as posted on the Amazon website...""When a local begins fishing with dynamite in Bog Lake, something a bit larger pops to the surface""...yeah, something popped to the surface all right, that being a particularly crummy film.  Written by Carl Kitt (his only writing credit), and directed by Don Keeslar (The Capture of Grizzly Adams), Bog stars Gloria DeHaven (The Thin Man Goes Home, Yes Sir That's My Baby) and Aldo Ray (God's Little Acre, The Green Berets), both having seen much better days, cinematically speaking.  Also appearing is Marshall Thompson (Fiend Without a Face, It! The Terror from Beyond Space), Don Daniel (Slumber Party Massacre II), and special guest star (gasp!) Leo Gordon (Hondo, Baby Face Nelson).As the movie begins we see some idiot hick fishin' with dynamite on a secluded lake (cue twangy banjo music from film Deliverance), and guess what?  The fishin' is good...that is until he's pulled into the water by something...so long, stupid!  After this we're into some really shoddy looking credits and lame music played over scenes of a green station wagon cruising the Wisconsin backwoods.  As the credits and music eventually end, the vehicle stops near a lake (the same one we saw at the beginning), and out pops a pair of completely annoying couples.  Just to give you an idea how annoying, the one woman, who wears a tube top and is constantly shoving her camera down the front of her top, refers to her husband as `Chucky-Poo'...shortly after their arrival I began praying to the movie gods for the bog man to show up and exact some sort of divine retribution...my prays were heard, as old slimy pants does appear, but only goes after the two women, off screen, of course.  The men run off to a nearby town and report their misfortune to Sheriff Neal Rydholm (Ray), who organizes a search party.  Eventually the women are found (their corpses, that is), and now it's up to local pathologist Ginny Glenn (DeHaven) what happened, assisted by the local sawbones (as he refers to himself numerous times) Dr. Brad Wednesday (Thompson), a phony baloney name if I ever heard one.  As the bodies begin to pile up, Ginny, based on her investigations, believes something ookie has risen from the murky depths, something that's draining the blood from its victims, while the sheriff, a man of action (when he's not drinking), detonates some plastic explosives in the lake...but that only serves to agitate the creature and more people die (which wasn't a bad thing).  An ichthyologist, played by Gordon, makes the scene, and the townspeople begin to doubt the capabilities of their local law enforcement (with good reason).  Exactly what is the nature of the beast, and what is its relationship to Adriana (also played by DeHaven), the old hag that lives near the lake?Filmed on local in Wisconsin, Bog features a whole slew of people who obviously weren't actors but those culled from the local population, so being overly critical of them would be somewhat unfair...suffice to say, most who appeared in this movie weren't professional actors, and it showed...the worst was the guy who played the hillbilly character Wallace Fry...thankfully, his role is cut short by an untimely, but very welcomed death, one which, sadly, is off screen.  So how about the `professional' performers?  DeHaven was pretty bad in her dual roles, partly because of a ridiculous script, but her dismal showing paled in comparison to Aldo Ray, who appeared inebriated throughout the movie (I guess if I was strapped to such an abysmal production, I'd be inclined to drown myself in the booze also).  The absolute worst aspect of this film for me was the script.  Below is an exchange between Ginny and Dr. Brad Wednesday as they're postulating what kind of creature is running about based on their autopsy invesitgations...Ginny: We know how the blood was taken...but by what?  And Why?Dr. Brad: Don't look at me...with the proper instruments I could duplicate the extractive process, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to...Ginny: For food?  No...yes!  Well, what I mean is, why would (pregnant pause) Brad, don't look at me that way, and don't think I'm crazy...but...could we have a Dracula running loose out there?(cue ominous music and goofy double take by Dr, Brad)And here's another choice bit, the reaction from the sheriff as Ginny and Dr. Brad relate their theories as to the kind of creature responsible for the recent spate of deaths.Sheriff Rydholm: Maybe I'm dense, but what kinda thing would have a hypodemic nerdle for a mouth?And yes, the misspellings are on purpose, as that's exactly how he said it...I think he was supposed to be drunk at the time, I'm unsure.  I also loved the scene where the townspeople storm into the sheriff's office demanding action.Local Yokel: Sheriff, what're you people doing?!Sheriff Rydholm: Slowly losing our marbles!As far as the direction, it's a mess.  There is a sense of forward movement, but the story often gets derailed with pointless interactions and annoying subplots (I could have done without the lame, romantic angle between a middle-aged Ginny and an over-the-hill Dr. Brad, especially their extended `necking' sequence).  And then there were the bits with the old hag Adriana.  Her character could have been removed completely and little would have been lost.  She did serve a purpose, but it was one that could have been dealt with in a different, much more efficient method.  The film runs about an hour and a half, but they could have shaved about 20 minutes off the running time, as the movie wore out its welcome very quickly.  As far as the creature goes, we only get furtive flashes of it throughout most of the film (most all the deaths are of the off screen variety), which I don't rightly understand as once we finally do see the beast, it didn't look that bad...sure, it was fake (and goofy), but obviously something that took awhile to create...why not show it off?  Oh well...also, the creature attacks (when shown) were edited with a series of quick cuts, probably meant to heighten the sense of action, but only served to create a sense of confusion.  I think my favorite sequence involved Sheriff Rydholm calling in a couple of divers, telling them only that they're looking for bodies, but never warning them of the distinct possibility of a dangerous creature swimming about.  The two divers, one of whom the sheriff was obviously good friends with, end up as monster chow, all because the sheriff neglected to impart a critical bit of information...nice...all in all this film is one great, big mess, but if you find entertainment in rotten cinema, there's some fun to be had here.  I would have been inclined to go three stars just for Aldo Ray's character, but the video quality was putrid.The DVD, released by a company called 905 Entertainment, features a terrible, fullscreen picture that looks as if it was taken from a well worn VHS tape.  There's a perpetual `fuzzy' quality to the picture, looking much like someone smeared Vaseline on my TV screen.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio fares a little better.  There are no special features, but there are chapter stops, four of them...really, what's the point of including chapter stops if you're only going to have four of them?  By the way, this film was released in 1983, but it was shot in the late 70s, and supposed to be released in 1978.  Why the five year wait?  I haven't the boggiest...er, I mean foggiest idea...Cookieman108If I learned anything from this film, it's that tube tops do not make good active wear, especially when you're running away from a monster as you have to use one hand to hold it up, else your bazooms will fall out.",2,"""Maybe I'm dense, but what kinda thing would have a hypodemic nerdle for a mouth?""",1131494400,"11 9,

The quality on the DVD is poor, and it looks like they used a worn out VHS tape. This film needs a better release. It's a lesser known monster flick, and it's simply about a fisherman who awakens a ancient monster in a scummy bog; and there's a old hag or witch that lives around there that knows about the creature. There's no gore or nudity, but it's recommended if you like monster movies from the 50s, cheap retro monster flicks, and if you're not hard to please. It has some good creepy atmosphere, and the monster ( which is obviously a guy in a rubber monster suit ) is pretty cool. If this got a better release the film would be so much more enjoyable because the poor DVD quality interferes with the films scenery and atmosphere which are one of the best things about the film.

Fishing with dynamite on Bog Lake releases a deadly creature (although later scenes hint that it has been running around for a while).  We see the action as it pertains to a couple of tourists who are almost never without a beer can in their hands, the local sheriff, the coroner and a doctor.  Although local law enforcement is slow to accept the cause, they do recognize that there is something killing people.Eventually people believe there really is a creature.  That's when it gets really odd.  The Sheriff gets some friends to go diving in the lake after he already knows doing so is deadly.  In the early scenes, the creature's point of view makes it huge but when we see it, it is only man-sized.  The ME and doctor spout a lot of scientific words that make little to no sense as is typical in these movies.  But in the end we have a typical low-budget film with some final revelations and mysteries.Nothing great here although the characterizations are almost all humourous, from the drunken Avery Schrieber look-a-like to the bi-polar sheriff.  Trying to make sense of the science will tie your brain in knots.  There are no clear shots of the creature an only a few un-clear ones.  Mostly we just get the characters running around acting silly.

Not bad but not that good, just very cheesey!",2,Early 80's movie with a 50's soundtrack and a 70's feel.,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,529,"['Buying', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'creature', 'black', 'lake', 'Legend', 'Boggy', 'Creek', 'shock', 'Waves', 'Well', 'Im', 'lover', 'cheesey', 'movies', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'cheesey', 'Very', 'sharp', 'cheesey', 'was', 'time', 'warping', 'watching', 'movie', 'First', 'felt', '70', 'acting', 'Then', 'felt', '50', 'movie', 'music', 'Then', 'felt', '70', 'again', 'theme', 'song', 'begining', 'end', 'movie', 'got', 'what', 'payed', 'very', 'sharp', 'cheesey', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'good', 'just', 'very', 'cheesey']",N/A

I saw the box many times, and thought the movie actually looked kinda scary, but I never rented it for some unknown reason.  Years passed and I'd see it from time to time in various stores and rental places, or read about it in a video guide.  Well, after watching it recently, Bog definitely decided to kick my ass for all the years of neglect(though I should have just gotten it over with back when I was 6).I've always loved the concept of creatures coming out of the ocean/lake/swamp, etc.  This relatively simple story involves a fish-man type creature that attacks folks out in the woods and sucks their blood.  Sounds like fun, but it really isn't.  For me it wasn't the bad acting, the silly music or any of that stuff people usually point out.  What bugs the hell out of me is that it looked so bad.  Fans of low budget films are quite used to cheap looking films and bad picture quality, but even we have our limits from time to time.  The look of Bog isn't camcorder, but it's very grainy, murky, dark and blurry.  You really never get a decent look at the monster because of this.  The movie was nothing to rave about to begin with, but it would have been considerably better if it had simply looked a bit clearer and slicker.  Not Spielberg quality for crying out loud, but something.  Hell, this made the Corpse Grinders look professional.Movies like Bog and Blood Hook make me think that horror films made in Wisconsin should maybe be avoided in the future.  This hurts me to say considering I friggin' live here!!!  But hey, at least I'm being objective and not biased!Venture into the Bog at your own risk, bubba.",2,"Not As Good As The Fog, But Worse Than Trog",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,1702,"['saw', 'film', 'shelf', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'saw', 'box', 'many', 'times', 'thought', 'movie', 'actually', 'looked', 'kinda', 'scary', 'never', 'rented', 'unknown', 'reason', 'Years', 'passed', ""'d"", 'see', 'time', 'time', 'various', 'stores', 'rental', 'places', 'read', 'video', 'guide', 'Well', 'watching', 'recently', 'Bog', 'definitely', 'decided', 'kick', 'ass', 'years', 'neglect', 'should', 'have', 'just', 'gotten', 'back', 'when', 'was', '6', '.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'concept', 'creatures', 'coming', 'ocean/lake/swamp', 'etc', 'relatively', 'simple', 'story', 'fish-man', 'type', 'creature', 'folks', 'out', 'woods', 'sucks', 'blood', 'fun', 'really', ""n't"", 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'acting', 'silly', 'music', 'stuff', 'people', 'usually', 'point', 'out', 'What', 'bugs', 'hell', 'looked', 'so', 'bad', 'Fans', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'used', 'cheap', 'looking', 'films', 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'even', 'have', 'limits', 'time', 'time', 'look', 'Bog', ""n't"", 'camcorder', 'very', 'grainy', 'murky', 'dark', 'blurry', 'really', 'never', 'get', 'decent', 'look', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'rave', 'begin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considerably', 'better', 'had', 'simply', 'looked', 'bit', 'clearer', 'slicker', 'Not', 'Spielberg', 'quality', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'something', 'Hell', 'made', 'Corpse', 'Grinders', 'look', 'professional.Movies', 'Bog', 'Blood', 'Hook', 'make', 'think', 'horror', 'films', 'made', 'Wisconsin', 'should', 'maybe', 'be', 'avoided', 'future', 'say', 'considering', 'friggin', 'live', 'here', 'hey', 'least', ""'m"", 'being', 'objective', 'not', 'biased', 'Venture', 'Bog', 'own', 'risk', 'bubba']",N/A
