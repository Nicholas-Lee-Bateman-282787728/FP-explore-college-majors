I'm a fan of the Leprechaun series and the Chucky series, and while Killjoy 2 doesn't live up to either of those, it's in the same vein.

750779,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00008Z44F,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","Killjoy is back in this sequel to the first film and is being played by Trent Haaga. The main characters are a bunch of teens/young adults who are having their rap sheet read for a bunch of ridiculous crimes they committed. The delinquents are put in a van by detention officers Denise Martinez and Harris Redding and sent off to a detention center across L.A, at least an hour or two away from the city, out in the country and wooded area. The ride lasts all day and by night their engine gives out, leaving them trapped in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone connection at all.One of the miscreants breaks into a house for help only to get fatally shot by a redneck woman who threatens to kill them all, unless they leave. This leads to Redding shooting and killing her. The group then head to another house visible from where they are and discover that a voodoo woman lives there. The voodoo woman claims that she can save the dying delinquent with her magic. One of the girls goes on to tell the story of how Killjoy came about (referencing the plot from the first movie), leading to one of the criminals to convince her to summon Killjoy to save their dying mate.After seemingly to have failed, Nic yells at Ce-Ce and she goes to cry about it in an outhouse. Enter Killjoy. Killjoy arrives on the scene and stalks the girl from outside of the outhouse before slipping a pair of chattering teeth inside to chew her to death. From there on out, the criminals, officers, and voodoo woman learn that Killjoy has been resurrected and that their lives on earth are near its end, unless they can find a way to send him back to hell. Can they survive the night and send Killjoy back to the freak circus or will he show them all that he's not clowning around?",2,Killjoy Returns!,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,1760,"['Killjoy', 'back', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'being', 'played', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'bunch', 'teens/young', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'rap', 'sheet', 'read', 'bunch', 'ridiculous', 'crimes', 'committed', 'delinquents', 'are', 'put', 'van', 'detention', 'officers', 'Denise', 'Martinez', 'Harris', 'Redding', 'sent', 'off', 'detention', 'center', 'L.A', 'least', 'hour', 'two', 'away', 'city', 'country', 'wooded', 'area', 'ride', 'day', 'night', 'engine', 'out', 'leaving', 'trapped', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'cell', 'phone', 'connection', 'all.One', 'miscreants', 'breaks', 'house', 'help', 'only', 'get', 'fatally', 'shot', 'redneck', 'woman', 'who', 'kill', 'leave', 'Redding', 'shooting', 'killing', 'group', 'then', 'head', 'house', 'visible', 'where', 'are', 'discover', 'voodoo', 'woman', 'there', 'voodoo', 'woman', 'can', 'save', 'dying', 'delinquent', 'magic', 'One', 'girls', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'Killjoy', 'came', 'referencing', 'plot', 'first', 'movie', 'leading', 'one', 'criminals', 'convince', 'summon', 'Killjoy', 'save', 'dying', 'mate.After', 'seemingly', 'have', 'failed', 'Nic', 'Ce-Ce', 'cry', 'outhouse', 'Enter', 'Killjoy', 'Killjoy', 'scene', 'girl', 'outside', 'outhouse', 'slipping', 'pair', 'chattering', 'teeth', 'chew', 'death', 'there', 'out', 'criminals', 'officers', 'voodoo', 'woman', 'learn', 'Killjoy', 'been', 'resurrected', 'lives', 'earth', 'are', 'end', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'send', 'back', 'hell', 'Can', 'survive', 'night', 'send', 'Killjoy', 'back', 'freak', 'circus', 'will', 'show', 'not', 'clowning', 'around']",Killjoy 2

A group of youthful offenders are being transported in a van to a work site 200 miles away. They start out in the morning and by night fall they still haven't arrived. The van breaks down and they go for help.After a mishap, they come across a house of a woman versed in the black arts. One of the offenders tells us the story of Killjoy, then he somehow arrives at the scene.The characters in this film are stiff. Killjoy is overly animated with cliche ""Freddy"" style lines.
