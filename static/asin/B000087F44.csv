It's not enough that it is a foreign film and that there are some cultural differences but now that is all taken away for a hip hop feel and the tone of the movie is lost.

The original is smart and layered with dark humor but also very entertaining as it is a martial arts film.

We remember that those movies were full of action but on the flipside they were also full of the most horrendously done dubbing of English voices that would make you laugh for virtually no reason.  Nowadays we can relive those days thanks to Spike TV and their new ""Films of Fury"" series on Saturday afternoons, but last year MTV (Spike TV's big brother channel) decided to try a little experiment.The experiment was to take an actual live-action movie and do the exact same thing the old-school movies did, however the film would be more recent (2001) and the dubbers would be those that the new-schoolers could feel (some of the most popular hip-hop artists around)  The end result would be Volcano High, which did originally air on MTV last year and gets an official DVD release this year.The MTV version, which is a truncated version of the original Korean film (also on the disc)focuses on Kim (voiced by OutKast's Andre 3000), a young man who has a little problem with the fact that he possesses an amazing power but it has gotten him kicked out of 8 schools.  So Kim is sent to his 9th school, the titular school.  Once he arrives he already finds himself hounded by the school bully Jang Yang (voiced by Lil Jon), attracted to a fellow student (voice: Mya) and has a slight run-in with the top student of the school, Hakrim (voice: Snoop Dogg).When an incident occurs that sends the school's beloved principal to the hospital and Hakrim to jail for attempted  murder, the evil Vice Principal (voice: Pat Morita) begins to take over with extreme discipline and rules that are enforced by a group of the meanest substitute teachers around, led by the stone-faced Mr. Ma (voice: Method Man).  When the students learn that an even more insidious plan is in store for the students, Hakrim reveals to Kim that his powers are the only way the principal and Mr. Ma can be stopped.The film is a fun little trip back for some and a total head-trip for others but it does feature some unintentionally funny moments (listen carefully and you'll hear Andre 3000 say a rather OutKast-ian variation on a phrase that made me bust a gut the first time I heard it)  It also features something for the old heads that grew up with this type of film and those of us that are more hip to what's hot.

734710,A1AETOJ2FGD30X,B000087F44,Wally Waffles,"[0, 0]","I don't know if this is the two-side version or not, but the one I bought at a local store is...* Side B - Original Korean, with English captioning for the hearing impaired:This is what I bought the movie for.  I ALMOST DIDN'T because I RESENT MTV making the cover look like it's an American gangster-rapper film, when IT ISN'T.  Anyway, the Korean version is an okay film, but not great.  It's kind of silly.  But it felt like watching a live-action manga, which usually just does not work well.  I'd say it's worth getting if you can get it cheap.But if you find this movie disappointing, rest assured that there are PLENTY of GREAT Korean films out there.  (Check out the TV dramas, too.)* Side A - MTV butchering, dubbed with gangster rappers:I watched this version on a whim one night when I had insomnia.  But I must give praise where due:  MTV did an excellent job of syncronizing the dub.  But that's all they did well.The soundtrack was re-done with hip-hop.  It just didn't fit.  This is not hip-hop film, neither is it really a gangster film.  And the Korean perception of gangsters is very different from the American, anyway.  (I guess if MTV were to dub ""Hi, Dharma!"" it would carry the tag-line of ""Where Hip Hop and Buddism collide."")The MTV version has the scenes cut up and out of order.  One example is the plot device of the tea leaves.  In the original version, this was somewhat subtle, and the key scenes were spread throughout the first part of the film.  In the MTV version, these key scenes were all lumped together so that only an idiot could overlook them.  I guess that shows what MTV thinks about the intellegence of its viewers.There are several scenes with on-screen Korean text.  One is an epilogue, the rest are profiles which are presented when a key character is introduced.  MTV cut most of these, but the few that remain (without being incorporated into the story) stand out really distractingly, probably leaving most viewers wondering, ""What's that?! Why's it there?!""The English script could have been a lot better.  Simply a different choice of words or even order of lines could have made it better.  ...and the script writer showed his true stupidity when the main character introduces him self as ""Kim Kyeong-Su"" and his teacher imediately referes to him as ""Kim Su,"" inferring that a formal address would be ""Mister Su.""  In Eastern culture, the family name comes first:  This character's family name is Kim, and his ENTIRE ""first name"" is Kyeong-Su.The speaking of the English dub wasn't all that great.  You think they could have at least COACHED the voice actors on how to pronounce the names.
