Its amusing and the colors are great. The voice of Beetlejuice is spot on sounding very like Michael Keaton but the voice of Lydia is ALL wrong- it makes her sound too bright and perky. Im in my 30's and so happy to see this cartoon again.",4,Campy But Fun!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,460,"['Beetlejuice', 'cartoon', 'series', 'was', 'short', 'lived', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'project', 'series', 'very', 'movie', 'Lydia', 'Beetlejuice', 'are', 'friends', 'Lydia', 'constantly', 'going', 'netherworld', 'help', 'Beetlejuice', 'way', 'amusing', 'colors', 'are', 'great', 'voice', 'Beetlejuice', 'spot', 'sounding', 'very', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'voice', 'Lydia', 'wrong-', 'sound', 'too', 'bright', 'perky', 'Im', '30', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'cartoon', 'again']",Beetlejuice: Season 1

1625554,A105D0UKK3356E,B00BCMT1PK,Dunestar,"[3, 3]","Ironically, (as with most cartoon adaptations I've witnessed) I watched the show before the actual movie, and loved the animated adaptation.  One reason is unlike Past adaptions of film and TV Shows, Tim Burton, the creator oversaw the show's production and kept it as funny as the film, but acceptable for Saturday Morning:  where Lydia Deetz and her family live in the house, and she somehow discovered Beetlejuice, of course, the former residents from the movie aren't in the show.The premise deals with how Lydia deals with her ghostly friend in and out of the Netherworld, usually contending with supernatural products or Beetlejuice's wild schemes.  Before it was done in Chowder and Flapjack, Beetlejuice utilized different medias rather well.  Basically using computer animation whenever the television was used in the series, sure it wasn't anything like in Futurama (remember this was the 80s), but it helped make the show interesting at times.The First Season spans the Saturday Morning Cartoon Show, which I feel was a bit better than its syndicated part since it was a bit more consistence rather than just being chaotic randomness.  In this series, we see Beetlejuice attempt babysitting, enter a gross-out contest, deal with actual skeletons in the closet.  Also this season introduced Prince Vince and Beetlejuice's (!) parents.  Other supporting members include the Camp Fire Ghouls, Jacque La Lean, Ginger, and the Monster Across the Street (which was loosely based on Warner Bros.' Gossamer character).Basically if you're new to the series, or a classic viewer, Season One is the best place to start visiting the Netherworld and the Ghost with the Most.",5,The Ghost with the Most is back!,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,1672,"['Ironically', 'most', 'cartoon', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'witnessed', 'watched', 'show', 'actual', 'movie', 'loved', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'One', 'reason', 'Past', 'adaptions', 'film', 'TV', 'Shows', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'creator', 'oversaw', 'show', 'production', 'kept', 'as', 'funny', 'film', 'acceptable', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'where', 'Lydia', 'Deetz', 'family', 'live', 'house', 'somehow', 'discovered', 'Beetlejuice', 'course', 'former', 'residents', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'show.The', 'premise', 'deals', 'how', 'Lydia', 'deals', 'ghostly', 'friend', 'Netherworld', 'usually', 'contending', 'supernatural', 'products', 'Beetlejuice', 'wild', 'schemes', 'was', 'done', 'Chowder', 'Flapjack', 'Beetlejuice', 'utilized', 'different', 'medias', 'rather', 'well', 'Basically', 'using', 'computer', 'animation', 'whenever', 'television', 'was', 'used', 'series', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Futurama', 'remember', 'was', '80s', 'helped', 'make', 'show', 'interesting', 'times.The', 'First', 'Season', 'Saturday', 'Morning', 'Cartoon', 'Show', 'feel', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'syndicated', 'part', 'was', 'bit', 'more', 'consistence', 'rather', 'just', 'being', 'chaotic', 'randomness', 'series', 'see', 'Beetlejuice', 'attempt', 'babysitting', 'enter', 'gross-out', 'contest', 'deal', 'actual', 'skeletons', 'closet', 'Also', 'season', 'introduced', 'Prince', 'Vince', 'Beetlejuice', 'parents', 'Other', 'supporting', 'members', 'include', 'Camp', 'Fire', 'Ghouls', 'Jacque', 'La', 'Lean', 'Ginger', 'Monster', 'Street', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Gossamer', 'character', '.Basically', ""'re"", 'new', 'series', 'classic', 'viewer', 'Season', 'One', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'visiting', 'Netherworld', 'Ghost', 'Most']",Beetlejuice: Season 1
