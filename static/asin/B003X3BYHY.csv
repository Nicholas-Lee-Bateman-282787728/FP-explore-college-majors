If you enjoy piano music, and know how hard it is to become good at it, you shoud really enjoy this.It is amazing to see just how outstanding these amateur pianists are and how they take on this competition. I also found it very hard to discern who I would have chosen as the winner, since so many of the competitors were so good.I highly recommend this to piano lovers.",5,Great documentary for piano lovers,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,482,"['watched', 'originally', 'Netflix', 'then', 'bought', 'DVD', 'family', 'member', 'knew', ""'d"", 'love', 'enjoy', 'piano', 'music', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'become', 'good', 'shoud', 'really', 'enjoy', 'this.It', 'amazing', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'outstanding', 'amateur', 'pianists', 'are', 'how', 'take', 'competition', 'also', 'found', 'very', 'hard', 'discern', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'winner', 'so', 'many', 'competitors', 'were', 'so', 'good.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'piano', 'lovers']",They Came to Play

It has great music, exciting piano playing, features fascinating and diverse personalities, and has an excellent picture with very gratifying reproduction of the sound of a Steinway concert grand piano.I was unaware this competition was even taking place but am very happy to see such talented musicians from all over the world given the opportunity to compete and perform. The production and direction of this documentary is beautifully done and involves the viewer in the excitement and growing tension as the competitors prepare and play. What was interesting to me was the diversity of the backgrounds and experiences exhibited by the various competitors.The story was focused on several different pianists who would eventually move on in the competition to the semi-finals and some to the final round. They were so different it was easy to find one you liked the best; there was something for everyone. It was exciting for us when the one we picked as our favorite won the competition.They Came to Play is fun, entertaining, and captivating; it makes for a great evening's entertainment.

Expertly filmed,  the movie is about these amateurs who gave up music to pursue careers in business and medicine,  only to return for this intense competition. As entertaining as the piano playing is, the intimate portraits of the competitors is equally so; a Haitian American doctor, a Russian refugee, an Alabama ophthalmologist, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, an Aids sufferer, a French woman tennis instructor, an engaging and funny Moldavian woman, a jeweler with rings on his fingers,  and more.And the winner is....",5,A wonderful documentary film,1306972800,"06 2, 2011",2011,644,"['Ten', 'non-professional', 'pianists', '35', 'compete', 'Van', 'Cliburn', 'Piano', 'Competition', 'Texas', 'Christian', 'University', 'Expertly', 'filmed', 'movie', 'amateurs', 'who', 'gave', 'up', 'music', 'pursue', 'careers', 'business', 'medicine', 'only', 'return', 'intense', 'competition', 'entertaining', 'piano', 'playing', 'intimate', 'portraits', 'competitors', 'equally', 'so', 'Haitian', 'American', 'doctor', 'Russian', 'refugee', 'Alabama', 'ophthalmologist', 'graduate', 'Air', 'Force', 'Academy', 'Aids', 'sufferer', 'French', 'woman', 'tennis', 'instructor', 'engaging', 'funny', 'Moldavian', 'woman', 'jeweler', 'rings', 'fingers', 'winner']",They Came to Play
1370060,A17SPEC8D1SX85,B003X3BYHY,R. Tobias,"[0, 0]","This is a fascinating look into not only the Cliburn amateur piano competition but into the lives of some of the talented amateurs themselves.  Unless you have been exposed to very talented amateur pianists before, you might be surprised at how gifted and skilled the best of them really are.  A strength of this film is that you get a detailed look into the lives and background of several of the participants in the competition.  Seeing the artists in their own homes, and in many cases with their families gives this documentary a very intimate and personal feel.  The participants span a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures, and for this reason themselves make interesting subjects.  They range from true amateurs to those with extensive formal training and public performance experience, but who qualify as amateur since they don't currently make a living from performing.  As an amateur pianist myself, I was surprised that even some artists with very technically and musically advanced performances did not even make the first cut of 25!!  I also agree with another reviewer that it is difficult to see how the judges determine the prize winners.  For example, how do you decide on who is 'better', the one who pulled off an extremely difficult and long Alkan piece, or the one who gave a commanding and musically satisfying interpretation of a difficult Beethoven sonata?  Subjectivism has to enter into the judgements, it seems.  Anyway, if you are a serious amateur pianist, this is a can't miss film, and due to the human interest angle it will appeal to a much wider audience as well.",5,These Guys (and Gals) are GOOD!,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",2012,1601,"['fascinating', 'look', 'not', 'only', 'Cliburn', 'amateur', 'piano', 'competition', 'lives', 'talented', 'amateurs', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'very', 'talented', 'amateur', 'pianists', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'how', 'gifted', 'skilled', 'best', 'really', 'are', 'strength', 'film', 'get', 'detailed', 'look', 'lives', 'background', 'several', 'participants', 'competition', 'Seeing', 'artists', 'own', 'homes', 'many', 'cases', 'families', 'documentary', 'very', 'intimate', 'personal', 'feel', 'participants', 'span', 'wide', 'variety', 'backgrounds', 'cultures', 'reason', 'make', 'interesting', 'subjects', 'range', 'true', 'amateurs', 'extensive', 'formal', 'training', 'public', 'performance', 'experience', 'who', 'qualify', 'amateur', 'do', ""n't"", 'currently', 'make', 'living', 'performing', 'amateur', 'pianist', 'was', 'surprised', 'even', 'artists', 'very', 'technically', 'musically', 'advanced', 'performances', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'first', 'cut', '25', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'difficult', 'see', 'how', 'judges', 'determine', 'prize', 'winners', 'example', 'how', 'do', 'decide', 'who', ""'better"", 'one', 'who', 'pulled', 'off', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'long', 'Alkan', 'piece', 'one', 'who', 'gave', 'commanding', 'musically', 'satisfying', 'interpretation', 'difficult', 'Beethoven', 'sonata', 'Subjectivism', 'enter', 'judgements', 'Anyway', 'are', 'serious', 'amateur', 'pianist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'due', 'human', 'interest', 'angle', 'will', 'appeal', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'as', 'well']",They Came to Play

I see their 5-star ratings, an opinion I share, but know I won't be able to come close, verbally or musically, to matching their knowledgeable reviews.That out of the way, let me say only that this fascinating, entertaining documentary should be watched by all of us who do something for the love of it, by all of us who have day jobs that pay the rent but who have dreams that pay the soul.It doesn't matter if you don't much like the piano or classical music. This delightful documentary is about people.The pianists are wonderful, both as musicians and as people. The director, editor and cameramen are to be applauded for bringing us a masterpiece. The Van Cliburn folks are due our inadequate gratitude for making all of this possible.This DVD is being added to my Deserted Island list.
