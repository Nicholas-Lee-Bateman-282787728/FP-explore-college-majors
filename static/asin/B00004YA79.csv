I was surprised that the various actresses who appeared nude in the movie agreed to do it.  But I suppose back then, they didn't have any inhibitions about doing this movie and to them it was just another paycheck.  What I like is that what happened as a result of this movie is that Allen Funt decided to do more by doing what he called &#34;Candid Candid Camera&#34; stunts that incorporated what he did in the movie and made it for direct-to-video access.  Its too bad that Vestron Video(the company that originally produced the VHS copies of this movie) will not or cannot make DVD copies so that the general public can purchase them.

Allen Funt, host and creator of TV's ""Candid Camera"", proves to be a genial tour guide that is America's minefield of the birds and bees.  There are any number of amusing stunts on hand here but there are two segments that prove indelible.  One concerns interviews with people about interracial relationships.  Another is interviews with teenagers about their sexual experiences.  I don't know what's sadder the kids' misconceptions or their parents' reactions to what their offspring are saying.  I was expecting a dated exercise but Funt's film is timeless because as much as things have changed so little hasn't.  This was originally slapped with the ""X"" rating but today it would be borderline ""PG-13"".  For you ladies out there it's not only female nudity on display.

559104,AQ01Q3070LT29,B00004YA79,James McDonald,"[10, 10]","FOR ADULTS ONLY! Originally given a ""X"" rating. Now Rated ""R"". Running Time: 85 mins.We all remember the Candid Camera tv series which has been shown on and off since 1960-2004. It was originally known as ""Candid Microphone"" in 1948-49, 1951-52. Very popular on television in the 1960's and 1970's.This show was about a hidden television camera being set up and a practical joke being played on unsuspected real people that walk in by random. For example, a man would walk in to a cafe and sit on the stool to order some soup. Just as he begins to sip the soup with a spoon, the seat begins to lower. Everyone knew who Alan Funt was, the host of ""Candid Camera"", so when they saw him come out and he says ""Smile, Your on Candid Camera"", they knew it was a practical joke. They would then see themselves on television at a later date. (This is not in the movie).They never let a light, simple joke go too far or too long. To end the farce, the person was always told they were on ""Candid Camera"" and shown where the camera was.This movie is ""Candid Camera"" for adults only as it contains female frontal nudity and male frontal nudity with frank conversations about sex.The first joke is played at random on people who stand at an elevator. Suddenly a naked woman comes out and stands to ask them a question. The shock on the people's faces is priceless.Another joke is played where Alan Funt is disguised and talks to a woman in a room. There is a painting of a nude male on an easel.Alan excuses himself and says he will be back in a moment.A naked man enters the room. It is the male model in the painting. He sits in his position. The woman sees everything. Will she look at him or look away out of politeness? Every woman has different manners.Their are many practical jokes here and over 100 people are surprised.The great thing about Alan Funt was he was a great host and good at conversation with people. Always a gentleman, but Right On!Another great segment is you will hear middle-aged and mature senior men and woman share their opinions about sex, a naked statue - should it have a fig leaf or not, and nudity and sex in movies, including this movie. Remember, this is 1969.Another joke is senior citizens see a couple kissing, however this is a black man kissing a white woman in public. Is it right or wrong? Is it shocking? The seniors will give you their opinion.Richard Roundtree ( before ""Shaft"") is the black man with the white girl.Filmed in Miami, Florida.Followed by: Money Talks (1972).Another adult version by Alan Funt titled ""Candid Candid Camera"" was broadcast on HBO and Playboy Channel in 1982-87.I don't think you could do ""Candid Camera"" today as the times are different and people are different. We live in a fast-paced world, some people have become less tolerant and people are in a hurry to get somewhere. Hidden cameras are everywhere now...and Alan Funt has left us.On September 5, 1999, Alan Funt passed away at the age of 84. He had become incapacitated after a stroke in 1993.His son, Peter Funt, hosted with his father in 1987. Peter continued ""Candid Camera"" on television in 1996 with tv specials for the next 8 years.After 56 years of surprising people, Candid Camera came to an end in 2004.Candid Camera is now online at its own official website and is also seen on GMC - Gospel Music Channel.Original Candid Camera:Candid Camera - The Best of the 1960s: Volume OneCandid Camera: The Best of the 1960s: Vol. 2.The Best of Candid Camera: The Best of the 1970s, Vol. 1.Candid Camera - The Best of the 1970s: Volume Two.Candid Camera: The Best of the 1980s.Candid Camera: Greatest Moments(1987)Candid Camera: The Best of the 1990s.Candid Camera the Best of Today Volume One.Candid Camera the Best of Today Volume Two.Candid Camera: 5 Decades of Smiles.Smile...This Was Candid Camera (2010)Candid Camera's Inspirational Smiles (2010)",4,"Smile, Your on Candid Camera!",1311638400,"07 26, 2011",2011,3873,"['ADULTS', 'ONLY', 'Originally', 'given', 'X', 'rating', 'Now', 'Rated', 'R', 'Running', 'Time', '85', 'mins.We', 'remember', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'tv', 'series', 'been', 'shown', '1960-2004', 'was', 'originally', 'known', 'Candid', 'Microphone', '1948-49', '1951-52', 'Very', 'popular', 'television', '1960', ""1970's.This"", 'show', 'was', 'hidden', 'television', 'camera', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'practical', 'joke', 'being', 'played', 'unsuspected', 'real', 'people', 'walk', 'random', 'example', 'man', 'would', 'walk', 'cafe', 'sit', 'stool', 'order', 'soup', 'Just', 'sip', 'soup', 'spoon', 'seat', 'lower', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'who', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'was', 'host', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'so', 'when', 'saw', 'come', 'out', 'Smile', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'knew', 'was', 'practical', 'joke', 'would', 'then', 'see', 'television', 'later', 'date', 'not', 'movie', 'never', 'let', 'light', 'simple', 'joke', 'go', 'too', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'end', 'farce', 'person', 'was', 'always', 'told', 'were', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'shown', 'where', 'camera', 'was.This', 'movie', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'adults', 'only', 'female', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'male', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'frank', 'conversations', 'sex.The', 'first', 'joke', 'played', 'random', 'people', 'who', 'stand', 'elevator', 'Suddenly', 'naked', 'woman', 'out', 'ask', 'question', 'shock', 'people', 'priceless.Another', 'joke', 'played', 'where', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'disguised', 'talks', 'woman', 'room', 'painting', 'nude', 'male', 'easel.Alan', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'moment.A', 'naked', 'man', 'room', 'male', 'model', 'painting', 'position', 'woman', 'everything', 'Will', 'look', 'look', 'away', 'politeness', 'Every', 'woman', 'different', 'manners.Their', 'are', 'many', 'practical', 'jokes', 'here', 'over', '100', 'people', 'are', 'surprised.The', 'great', 'thing', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'was', 'was', 'great', 'host', 'good', 'conversation', 'people', 'gentleman', 'Right', 'great', 'segment', 'will', 'hear', 'middle-aged', 'mature', 'senior', 'men', 'woman', 'share', 'opinions', 'sex', 'naked', 'statue', 'should', 'have', 'fig', 'leaf', 'not', 'nudity', 'sex', 'movies', 'including', 'movie', 'Remember', '1969.Another', 'joke', 'senior', 'citizens', 'see', 'couple', 'kissing', 'however', 'black', 'man', 'kissing', 'white', 'woman', 'public', 'right', 'wrong', 'shocking', 'seniors', 'will', 'give', 'opinion.Richard', 'Roundtree', 'Shaft', 'black', 'man', 'white', 'girl.Filmed', 'Miami', 'Florida.Followed', 'Money', 'Talks', '1972', 'adult', 'version', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'titled', 'Candid', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'was', 'broadcast', 'HBO', 'Playboy', 'Channel', '1982-87.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'do', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'today', 'times', 'are', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'live', 'fast-paced', 'world', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'less', 'tolerant', 'people', 'are', 'hurry', 'get', 'somewhere', 'Hidden', 'cameras', 'are', 'everywhere', 'now', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'left', 'us.On', 'September', '5', '1999', 'Alan', 'Funt', 'passed', 'away', 'age', '84', 'had', 'become', 'incapacitated', 'stroke', '1993.His', 'son', 'Peter', 'Funt', 'hosted', 'father', '1987', 'Peter', 'continued', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'television', '1996', 'tv', 'specials', 'next', '8', 'years.After', '56', 'years', 'surprising', 'people', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'came', 'end', '2004.Candid', 'Camera', 'now', 'online', 'own', 'official', 'website', 'also', 'seen', 'GMC', 'Gospel', 'Music', 'Channel.Original', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1960s', 'Volume', 'OneCandid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1960s', 'Vol', '2.The', 'Best', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1970s', 'Vol', '1.Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1970s', 'Volume', 'Two.Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1980s.Candid', 'Camera', 'Greatest', 'Moments', '1987', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', '1990s.Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', 'Today', 'Volume', 'One.Candid', 'Camera', 'Best', 'Today', 'Volume', 'Two.Candid', 'Camera', '5', 'Decades', 'Smiles.Smile', 'Was', 'Candid', 'Camera', '2010', 'Candid', 'Camera', 'Inspirational', 'Smiles', '2010']",N/A
