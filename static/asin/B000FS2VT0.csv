The first one obviosly the best of them all starts at first introduction of Broly and his father. This movie has some of the best fight scenes ever and there is some great comedy sprinkled in. This movie is definetly a DBZ classic.The second movie goes to when Broly lands on earth after the events of the first film. This time though , its Goten, Trunks, and Videl who end up fighting at first. Later on Gohan comes and starts to fight. This movie has great action but is more focused on comedy.The third and last Broly movie always seems to get dogged but it isnt that bad of a movie. If you love Goten and Trunks then this movie is a must see. My only complaint about the third movie is Broly was deformed 99% of the time.",5,Broly Triple Threat,1269993600,"03 31, 2010",2010,789,"['Broly', 'movies', 'have', 'be', 'best', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'movies', 'ever', 'first', 'one', 'obviosly', 'best', 'starts', 'first', 'introduction', 'Broly', 'father', 'movie', 'best', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ever', 'great', 'comedy', 'sprinkled', 'movie', 'definetly', 'DBZ', 'classic.The', 'second', 'movie', 'when', 'Broly', 'earth', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'time', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'Videl', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'fighting', 'first', 'Later', 'Gohan', 'fight', 'movie', 'great', 'action', 'more', 'focused', 'comedy.The', 'third', 'last', 'Broly', 'movie', 'always', 'get', 'dogged', 'bad', 'movie', 'love', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'then', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'only', 'complaint', 'third', 'movie', 'Broly', 'was', 'deformed', '99', '%', 'time']",N/A
994357,A2VF73N1AI95SQ,B000FS2VT0,Dylan,"[2, 5]","I am a fan of Dragon Ball Z. One of it's most powerful villains is shown in the three movies this box set makes.  Broly, the Legendary Super Saiyan whose powers are unimaginable, survived planet Vegeta's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Now Broly, along with his father Paragus, hope to have their revenge on the last of the Saiyans who left them to die.  In the first movie, our heros meet this monster and must find a way to defeat him and safely get home.  In the second Broly movie, a seemingly dead Broly reveals he is alive, now it is up to Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Videl to finish what Goku could not. The final movie is certainly the most interesting in regard to plot.  A mutant form of Broly has been created through genetic engineering. For one last time our heros must stop Broly.Dragon Ball Z is my favorite television show and these movies have the action and storyline that makes DBZ worth watching. Broly is probably one of my least favorite villains due to his lack of personality, but many fans of DBZ adore him. As a true fan, I had to get these movies. I believe any fan of DBZ will like these movies, and the price is much better than buying them one by one.",4,A Good Buy,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1183,"['am', 'fan', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'One', 'most', 'powerful', 'villains', 'shown', 'three', 'movies', 'box', 'set', 'Broly', 'Legendary', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'powers', 'are', 'unimaginable', 'survived', 'planet', 'Vegeta', 'destruction', 'hands', 'Frieza', 'Now', 'Broly', 'father', 'Paragus', 'hope', 'have', 'revenge', 'last', 'Saiyans', 'who', 'left', 'die', 'first', 'movie', 'heros', 'meet', 'monster', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'safely', 'get', 'home', 'second', 'Broly', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'dead', 'Broly', 'reveals', 'alive', 'now', 'Gohan', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'Videl', 'finish', 'what', 'Goku', 'could', 'not', 'final', 'movie', 'certainly', 'most', 'interesting', 'regard', 'plot', 'mutant', 'form', 'Broly', 'been', 'created', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'heros', 'must', 'stop', 'Broly.Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'favorite', 'television', 'show', 'movies', 'have', 'action', 'storyline', 'DBZ', 'worth', 'watching', 'Broly', 'probably', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'villains', 'due', 'lack', 'personality', 'many', 'fans', 'DBZ', 'adore', 'true', 'fan', 'had', 'get', 'movies', 'believe', 'fan', 'DBZ', 'will', 'like', 'movies', 'price', 'much', 'better', 'buying', 'one', 'one']",N/A

Bio Broly is the best, I give it 3 stars, the first two movies I give 1 star.Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan has a terrible plot to begin with. The most powerful Super Saiyan in the universe is controlled by a collar? Vegeta acts so far out of character its not even funny. Goku ""gathers the energy he needs"" to defeat Broly while the others lay helpless (why does this sound familiar). The last time I watched this was a year ago, I'm not watching it again to write this review- the movie was bad then, it's worse now.Broly Second Coming looks like it was thrown together in one day. The background setting is not consistent. An example is that there was a fight at a waterfall and then the waterfall disappears into the fight scene. The characters health is also inconsistent. The characters are ""hurt"" and then able to fight again as if they were never hurt. Gohan passes out on a rock because he is exhausted fighting with Broly, and then he is able to turn into Super Saiyan again without any rest or sensu beans. Krillin appears in this one but Piccolo decides not to appear for absolutely no stated reason. The Dragon Balls don't work when their suppose to (for no reason) and then work  randomly when their not suppose to (for no reason).  The plot is reused from the Cell saga. When cell is killed, Vegeta throws an energy ball at cell which allows Gohan to destroy him. In Second coming, Trunks (Vegeta's son) throws an energy ball at Broly so that Gohan and Goten are able to kill him (with of course the same move as Gohan used to defeat Cell). Lastly, nothing could save me from the painfully corny dialogue and hideously unfunny jokes throughout the movie and the countless plot holes.Finally we get to Bio Broly. This movie is 3 stars, at least its average. I watched this movie right after Second Coming and the first thing I noticed was the animation. Though nothing compared to modern animation, it looks like some time was put into the details. The second thing I liked about the movie was there were only Krillin, Goten, Trunks, and Android 19 fighting. GOKU IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE.... Finally we can say this is a Dragon Ball Z movie and not a ""How Goku defeats the antagonist"" movie.The plot was better though as biology major, I can't appreciate a lot of the logic. Also, there could have been a little more fighting between Bio Broly and everyone else. Bio Broly does die in an unconventional way, which is good, but it's not too exciting.In conclusion, if your going to watch any of the Brolys, watch Bio Broly. There will be a few unimportant things you don't get but its better than suffering through the first two.",2,The Broly Movies are Terrible!!!,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2760,"['SpoilersI', ""'m"", 'as', 'much', 'fan', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'anyone', 'ignoring', 'how', 'terrible', 'movies', 'are', 'unacceptable', 'Bio', 'Broly', 'best', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'give', '1', 'Legendary', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'terrible', 'plot', 'begin', 'most', 'powerful', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'universe', 'controlled', 'collar', 'Vegeta', 'so', 'far', 'character', 'not', 'even', 'funny', 'Goku', 'gathers', 'energy', 'defeat', 'Broly', 'others', 'lay', 'helpless', 'why', 'sound', 'familiar', 'last', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'year', 'ago', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'again', 'write', 'review-', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'then', 'worse', 'now.Broly', 'Second', 'Coming', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'one', 'day', 'background', 'setting', 'not', 'consistent', 'example', 'was', 'fight', 'waterfall', 'then', 'waterfall', 'fight', 'scene', 'characters', 'health', 'also', 'inconsistent', 'characters', 'are', 'hurt', 'then', 'able', 'fight', 'again', 'were', 'never', 'hurt', 'Gohan', 'out', 'rock', 'exhausted', 'fighting', 'Broly', 'then', 'able', 'turn', 'Super', 'Saiyan', 'again', 'rest', 'sensu', 'beans', 'Krillin', 'one', 'Piccolo', 'not', 'appear', 'absolutely', 'stated', 'reason', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'suppose', 'reason', 'then', 'work', 'randomly', 'when', 'not', 'suppose', 'reason', 'plot', 'reused', 'Cell', 'saga', 'When', 'cell', 'killed', 'Vegeta', 'energy', 'ball', 'cell', 'Gohan', 'destroy', 'Second', 'coming', 'Trunks', 'Vegeta', 'son', 'energy', 'ball', 'Broly', 'Gohan', 'Goten', 'are', 'able', 'kill', 'course', 'same', 'move', 'Gohan', 'used', 'defeat', 'Cell', 'Lastly', 'nothing', 'could', 'save', 'painfully', 'corny', 'dialogue', 'hideously', 'unfunny', 'jokes', 'movie', 'countless', 'plot', 'holes.Finally', 'get', 'Bio', 'Broly', 'movie', '3', 'stars', 'least', 'average', 'watched', 'movie', 'right', 'Second', 'Coming', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'animation', 'nothing', 'compared', 'modern', 'animation', 'time', 'was', 'put', 'details', 'second', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'were', 'only', 'Krillin', 'Goten', 'Trunks', 'Android', '19', 'fighting', 'GOKU', 'NOT', 'IN', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'Finally', 'can', 'say', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'movie', 'not', 'How', 'Goku', 'antagonist', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'was', 'better', 'biology', 'major', 'ca', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'lot', 'logic', 'Also', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'fighting', 'Bio', 'Broly', 'everyone', 'else', 'Bio', 'Broly', 'die', 'unconventional', 'way', 'good', 'not', 'too', 'exciting.In', 'conclusion', 'going', 'watch', 'Brolys', 'watch', 'Bio', 'Broly', 'will', 'be', 'few', 'unimportant', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'suffering', 'first', 'two']",N/A

Like the Cooler's Revenge DVD I just reviewed (it was this that actually taught me to be careful what edition to buy) the music only matches the language that you're hearing, so no English dialogue with Japanese music option! It's not bad for the series, but for the movie they place these annoying songs in it & it's like watching something while the radio's on! I gave this to my cousin, before I got the movies back on the box sets because there was no way I could watch them & enjoy them.
