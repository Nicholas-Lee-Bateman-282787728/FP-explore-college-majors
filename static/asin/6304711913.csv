434092,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304711913,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I still remember seeing this in the theater as a kid; three times.  I was in love with this movie, and it didn't hurt that my father's favorite movie was `Old Yeller' so he was completely ok with seeing a movie about animals over and over again.  As a kid, I watched this at home all the time and dreamed of having a bulldog named Chance and cried when the kids are reunited with their pets and I was continually moved and entertained by everything that happened on the screen.The great thing about a movie like `Homeward Bound' is that it actually holds up, and I can totally understand why my father had no qualms with going back to the movies and seeing this again and again.  Sure, it isn't the smartest movie out there, and it isn't something that I, as an adult, am going to sit down and watch over and over again, but for the kind of movie that this is, it works wonderfully.  It serves as a great family film, and it is one that I'd watch with my kids without hesitation.  It is perilous but never too much, and most of all it has a lot of heart.  You fall in love with these animals and completely buy into their loyalty and the deep love these children have for these animals.The voice work is great.  Sally Field is especially effective as Sassy, the cat, but it is Michael J. Fox's vocal performance as Chance that I will always remember fondly.  I also really like that they didn't go for the obvious and make the animal's mouths move here.  Sure, it works with the cheeky fun that is `Babe' (love that movie) but there is a more earthy and realistic air to `Homeward Bound', and so depicting the animal communication in a more natural state worked to maintain that atmosphere.With beautiful scenery and a climax that is sure to bring the child in you to tears, `Homeward Bound' is quite an incredible journey.",5,Twenty years and still incredible...,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1823,"['still', 'remember', 'seeing', 'theater', 'kid', 'three', 'times', 'was', 'love', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'father', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'Old', 'Yeller', 'so', 'was', 'completely', 'ok', 'seeing', 'movie', 'animals', 'over', 'again', 'kid', 'watched', 'home', 'time', 'dreamed', 'having', 'bulldog', 'named', 'Chance', 'cried', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'reunited', 'pets', 'was', 'continually', 'moved', 'entertained', 'everything', 'happened', 'screen.The', 'great', 'thing', 'movie', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'actually', 'up', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'father', 'had', 'qualms', 'going', 'back', 'movies', 'seeing', 'again', 'again', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'smartest', 'movie', 'there', ""n't"", 'something', 'adult', 'am', 'going', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'kind', 'movie', 'wonderfully', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'one', ""'d"", 'watch', 'kids', 'hesitation', 'perilous', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'most', 'lot', 'heart', 'fall', 'love', 'animals', 'completely', 'buy', 'loyalty', 'deep', 'love', 'children', 'have', 'animals.The', 'voice', 'work', 'great', 'Sally', 'Field', 'especially', 'effective', 'Sassy', 'cat', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Chance', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'fondly', 'also', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'obvious', 'make', 'animal', 'mouths', 'move', 'here', 'Sure', 'cheeky', 'fun', 'Babe', 'movie', 'more', 'earthy', 'realistic', 'air', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'so', 'depicting', 'animal', 'communication', 'more', 'natural', 'state', 'worked', 'maintain', 'atmosphere.With', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'climax', 'sure', 'bring', 'child', 'tears', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'quite', 'incredible', 'journey']",N/A

434140,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,6304711913,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[60, 67]","This is a Disney film based on Sheila Burford's book __The Incredible Journey__, about three household pets (specifically a bulldog named Chance, a Himalayan cat named Sassy, and a golden retriever named Shadow) who run away from a faraway ranch in order to find their way back to their home in San Francisco.  Meanwhile, the owners (specifically 3 kids: a little brother named Jamie, a big brother named Peter, and a sister in the middle named Hope) call a search-and-rescue while at the same time trying to cope with a stepfather.  As you may expect, this film eventually comes to a happy ending where everyone is reunited and all is well.Now, I'm 15 years old and I have loved this film ever since I saw it in the theater at the age of 6.  I had many reasons why I loved it at the time--I thought it was funny, I thought it was exciting, and the ending made me cry (hey, don't snicker, I was six years old back then).  But now I have a reason why this film has stood the test of time against much flashier and less ""cute"" movies that I see nowadays, and that's simply because...well, because it's really a good movie!Don't understand?  Well, this film is so much more than just a movie with talking (sort of) animals that go on a journey in order to entertain little 6-year-olds.  The pets aren't just animals; they exude the human personalities of their owners!  Chance, owned by Jamie, is a mischievious pup who's always sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.  Shadow, owned by Peter, is a wise old golden retriever who's always trying to keep Chance out of trouble.  And Sassy, owned by Hope, is a fickle cat who always acts like she's sick of being stuck with her ""brothers"", if you know what I mean.And then there's the fact that even though the pets start out acting like siblings who drive each other crazy, they wind up going through thick and thin and actually realizing that they really love each other.  Also, this film also has a subplot that turns out happy too; Peter, Hope, and Jamie finally learn to love their stepfather and actually call him ""Dad"".  When the pets are back home in the end (face it, you KNEW it was going to happen) and they see the happy faces of their ecstatic owners, and EVERYONE is actually LOVING each other like a REAL family, Chance thinks with pride, ""For the first time in my life, I was HOME.""

It is a theme that Disney has explored many times through the years, and it is handed with typical Disney style in Homeward Bound (1993), which features some impressive performances by its animal performers.Bob Seaver (Robert Hays) and Laura (Kim Greist) have just married, and are embarking on a new life together.  Bob works at college in San Francisco, and Laura plans to relocate to his home there, along with her three children, Jamie (Kevin Chevalia), Peter (Benj Thall), and Hope (Veronica Lauren).  Each of the kids has their own pet, but unfortunately the animals will not be making the move to the city by the bay.  Instead, Shadow (voiced by Don Ameche) a golden retriever, Chance (voiced by Michael J. Fox) a bulldog, and Sassy (voiced by Sally Field) a Himalayan cat, are turned over to Kate (Jean Smart), a friend who owns a ranch out in the country.  With heavy hearts, the new family drives off headed to a new life.  The kids obviously miss their animal friends, but how they feel about their new stepfather Bob isn't really explored until later, as the focus is on the animals, who decide to leave the ranch, and somehow find their owners.Homeward Bound features voiceovers from each of the three animals, running above the action on the screen.  The tone and dialog are targeted at a younger audience.  The elder dog Shadow is the voice of experience, and at times stubborn overconfidence.  Chance is the exuberant pup who has a lot to learn, while Sassy is a classy lady who is tough enough to hang with the boys.As you might expect, some of the best parts are the scenes in the wilderness.  Getting one animal to perform is tough, but working with three is even more of a challenge, particularly when one of the animals is a cat.  There is an impressive scene featuring an encounter with a cougar, which ends with it taking a flying leap into a river.  When Sassy falls into the river a gets swept over a waterfall, the worst is feared, but with the help of a kind stranger, miraculously the trio is soon reunited.The animals find and comfort a little lost girl in the woods, and then help her to be discovered by a rescue party.  Thanks to flyers that Bob has distributed, the authorities recognize the missing pets and take them to animal shelter.  In the most humorous incident in the film, the animals manage to escape from the well intentioned staff at the shelter, as Sassy gets a chance to show what she can do.  The Seaver family is heartbroken, after expecting to be reunited with their loved ones, but the film finishes on an emotional high, with the pets somehow making their way to the Seaver's new home.Intended for youngsters, Homeward Bound is not one of Disney's finest, but it is certainly another fine example of the kind of solid family entertainment that Disney has been producing for decades.  Image quality is just average, with a lack of sharpness, and the colors seem to off a bit.  The movie is subtitled, but there are no extra features besides some trailers.Veteran actor Don Ameche does a marvelous job as the wise old timer Shadow.

434170,AP3B615GM191G,6304711913,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","As a young child, I watched this movie many times over, enjoying the silly humor of the three animals and being completely sucked in by the sappy message.  Many years later, I again sat down to watch it with my younger sister...and again found myself transported back to my childhood, even to the point of brushing back tears at the final touching scene.It is very obvious why this film was bound to be a hit with children: Almost all children love animals, the humor is at a level that even young ones can laugh at, and the three protagonists are ones that all children can identify with: the aged Golden Retriever Shadow, the frisky pup Chance, and the sharp-tongued and witty cat Sassy.Surprisingly, however, the film will also both touch and entertain viewers who have graduated elementary school.  The ""characters"" aren't too cheesy to make you roll your eyes, the plot isn't so animal-rights leaning (like Free Willy, for example) that it will make your stomach turn, and I think that the simple love between a child and his/her pet is something that we can still relate to long after we've ""grown up"".  If you are not dabbing at your eyes (or at least seeing through some mist) as the end credits roll, then the fault may just lie within your cynical self.So, I would highly recommend this movie for family viewing of any and all kinds.  For your child it will be a wonderful adventure, while at the same time you will be transported back to a time when life was much more innocent...childhood.",5,"Can A Film About Talking Animals Really Make You Cry?
