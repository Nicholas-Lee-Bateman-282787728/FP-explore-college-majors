1020113,A2DQR20UWY2G0Y,B000ICM5WQ,"Dr. Metal ""e23adams""","[0, 0]","I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I had now idea that the director came directly (no pun intended) from the documentary film industry.  That explains why this movie is so on the pluse of the time and era (considering it came out in 2007 during Bush's 2nd Term) and raises important questions about war and peace.While it is quite likely that such a critical film will not be welcomed at all by ""patriotic"" people, the fact, that parts of the cast were arrested during the making of this film, says it all for me!  You can hardly hope for more authenticity when something like that happens.The story is certainly good and even memorable.  A young TV reporter Jake (Nathan Crooker) is working for a middle sized news network in New York who recently came back as an embedded journalist from Iraq and is asked to report on anti-war & anti-Bush/Republican Party demonstrations in New York.  He has clearly an ambiguous attitude toward the whole Iraq war and subliminally even his job, but his  girlfriend Chloe (played by Amy Redford), who also works for the same news company, has a far more practical view of what journalism should be about.  According to her journalism should give the public different view points about an issue so that they can decide what to believe, but not be concerned with trying to discover the truth, since according to her the truth is likely to be many sided, complex, and not some singluar entity.  This is revealed in a brief conversation that they have at a party where many important news media people are as well.  Chloe is an ambitious youg woman who's determined to get ahead in her journalism career, while Jake has been rather disillusioned by what he saw in Iraq.  This becomes obvious in their relationship, while she wants him to do certain tasks on the job, whether or not they suit his beliefs, he often retorts to her that they have become mere distributers of information, rather than being concerned with ethical standards, finding the truth and answers to societal problems.The difference in their philosophy of how to do their jobs as journalists, at the same company, soon strains their relationship.  When Jake accidentally meets a young widow by the name of Amy (Rosaria Dawson) who lost her husband due to the Iraq war, he begins to feel a common bond between them.  Amy is also somehow drawn to Jake, but since he has a girlfriend and she a young son, they kept a distance between them.  It is through their son that the friendship is however maintained, as Jake looks after him from time to time.  Soon they start dating.  Well, I don't want to give away anthing else here cause this movie is really worth while seeing, and is one that makes you think and that has a message beyond mere suspense (of which there is a bit in this film) and action (of which there is also a little).Actually, it is hard to categorize this movie.  Its both within the drama and adventure genres, and maybe also slightly into the thriller genre.  What impressed me was the fact that most of the actors (of course except Dawson) were not at all actors, and thus acting for the first time.  For that, the performances were really excellent.  Go and see this movie if you want a memorable film experience.  If you have any interest in politics and social issues this DVD won't leave you cold.  I also liked the realistic feel that the film had to it, and the fact that it was usually filmed ""live"" on the Streets of central New York.Certainly anyone ever thinking about getting a job in journalism should definitely see this one, even if only for the crucial philosophical disagreements between Jake and his girlfriend of what journalism should be about.All in all, a really impressive movie, especially, since this debut.  Hopefully, we'll be able to see more movies from this director.",4,And now for something different...,1265846400,"02 11, 2010",2010,3831,"['was', 'really', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'movie', 'had', 'now', 'idea', 'director', 'came', 'directly', 'pun', 'intended', 'documentary', 'film', 'industry', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'pluse', 'time', 'era', 'considering', 'came', 'out', '2007', 'Bush', '2nd', 'Term', 'important', 'questions', 'war', 'peace.While', 'quite', 'likely', 'critical', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'welcomed', 'patriotic', 'people', 'fact', 'parts', 'cast', 'were', 'arrested', 'making', 'film', 'can', 'hardly', 'hope', 'more', 'authenticity', 'when', 'something', 'happens.The', 'story', 'certainly', 'good', 'even', 'memorable', 'young', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Jake', 'Nathan', 'Crooker', 'working', 'middle', 'sized', 'news', 'network', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'recently', 'came', 'back', 'embedded', 'journalist', 'Iraq', 'asked', 'report', 'anti-war', 'anti-Bush/Republican', 'Party', 'demonstrations', 'New', 'York', 'clearly', 'ambiguous', 'attitude', 'whole', 'Iraq', 'war', 'subliminally', 'even', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'Chloe', 'played', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'who', 'also', 'same', 'news', 'company', 'far', 'more', 'practical', 'view', 'what', 'journalism', 'should', 'be', 'According', 'journalism', 'should', 'give', 'public', 'different', 'view', 'points', 'issue', 'so', 'can', 'decide', 'what', 'believe', 'not', 'be', 'concerned', 'trying', 'discover', 'truth', 'according', 'truth', 'likely', 'be', 'many', 'sided', 'complex', 'not', 'singluar', 'entity', 'revealed', 'brief', 'conversation', 'have', 'party', 'where', 'many', 'important', 'news', 'media', 'people', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'Chloe', 'ambitious', 'youg', 'woman', 'who', 'determined', 'get', 'ahead', 'journalism', 'career', 'Jake', 'been', 'rather', 'disillusioned', 'what', 'saw', 'Iraq', 'obvious', 'relationship', 'do', 'certain', 'tasks', 'job', 'not', 'suit', 'beliefs', 'often', 'have', 'become', 'mere', 'distributers', 'information', 'rather', 'being', 'concerned', 'ethical', 'standards', 'finding', 'truth', 'answers', 'societal', 'problems.The', 'difference', 'philosophy', 'how', 'do', 'jobs', 'journalists', 'same', 'company', 'soon', 'relationship', 'When', 'Jake', 'accidentally', 'young', 'widow', 'name', 'Amy', 'Rosaria', 'Dawson', 'who', 'lost', 'husband', 'due', 'Iraq', 'war', 'feel', 'common', 'bond', 'Amy', 'also', 'somehow', 'drawn', 'Jake', 'girlfriend', 'young', 'son', 'kept', 'distance', 'son', 'friendship', 'however', 'maintained', 'Jake', 'time', 'time', 'Soon', 'start', 'dating', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'anthing', 'else', 'here', 'cause', 'movie', 'really', 'worth', 'seeing', 'one', 'think', 'message', 'mere', 'suspense', 'bit', 'film', 'action', 'also', 'little', '.Actually', 'hard', 'categorize', 'movie', 'drama', 'adventure', 'genres', 'maybe', 'also', 'slightly', 'thriller', 'genre', 'What', 'impressed', 'was', 'fact', 'most', 'actors', 'course', 'Dawson', 'were', 'not', 'actors', 'thus', 'acting', 'first', 'time', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'excellent', 'Go', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'memorable', 'film', 'experience', 'have', 'interest', 'politics', 'social', 'issues', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'cold', 'also', 'liked', 'realistic', 'feel', 'film', 'had', 'fact', 'was', 'usually', 'filmed', 'live', 'Streets', 'central', 'New', 'York.Certainly', 'anyone', 'ever', 'thinking', 'getting', 'job', 'journalism', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'one', 'even', 'only', 'crucial', 'philosophical', 'disagreements', 'Jake', 'girlfriend', 'what', 'journalism', 'should', 'be', 'about.All', 'really', 'impressive', 'movie', 'especially', 'debut', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'director']",N/A
1020114,A1M5405JH9THP9,B000ICM5WQ,golgotha.gov,"[5, 6]","THIS REVOLUTION (2004)directed by Stephen Marshallapprox. 95 minutesDocumentary director Stephen Marshall takes a shot at a feature-length narrative in 'THIS REVOLUTION'.  The results are mixed.  The movie made quite a splash before it was ever released due to the fact that both Marshall and star Rosario Dawson were arrested during the taping of the movie.The main story follows a cameraman sent to get footage of protestors outside the Republican National Convention held in NYC in 2004.  He is romantically involved with a co-worker, a corporate newswoman with a generally cynical attitude towards politics.  During the course of his work, he meets a single mother whose husband was killed in the recent Iraq War.  She mentions that she's become more politically active since her husband's death and wants to make the world a better place for her son to live in.  The cameraman is in a way forced to ""choose sides"" and take responsibility for his role in the media coverage of current events.Some of the ideas in 'THIS REVOLUTION' are good.  The phony superficial dialogue of the corporate news bunch sounds pretty accurate.  The profanity littered speech of the activists also has a sad element of truth as well, although this doesn't make them seem more ""real"", it makes them seem less articulate.  Funny thing is that sometimes these two paths intersect and basically say the same thing.  For example, there is a scene where rapper Immortal Technique ""acts"".  The corporate girlfriend suggests that they ""go get some shots of him in the hood"".  This is supposed to make her sound ridiculous and it does.  Whats hilarious is that when they go to tape him, one of his buddies says something like ""this is the sound of the STREETS!""  This is a supposed to be a serious line of dialogue even though it sounds like something off of a Funkmaster Flex commercial.We see many activists interviewed and they show varying degrees of talent.  Some of them sound like they are reciting lines from their favorite leaflets whereas others sound more genuine.  Activism is an interesting setting for a dramatic movie and I'm surprised that there haven't been more movies along these lines.  The politics of the movie are pretty transparent, as we get to hear theories about how certain property should be destroyed and some lines that sounded like they were lifted from the Weather Underground.  One activist is given the opportunity to relay the ""New Pearl Harbor theory""-  the idea that the September 11 terrorist attacks were an ""inside job"" alluded to in the Project for the New American Century document ""Rebuilding America's Defenses"".  This is unsurprising considering that one of director Stephen Marshall's other projects include a ""9/11 truth"" documentary featuring militant rapper PARIS.The most interesting segment is the one with artist Arthur Robins.  He used to sell his paintings outside of the Metropolitain museum in NYC.  When he decided to take a break and go see the latest show, a woman blamed him for illegally hanging art inside the museum.  This led to Robins being harassed not only inside the museum but also later at his apartment by NY police.  Amazingly, he was able to record their behavior, some of which is shown in 'THIS REVOLUTION'.  His story was also covered by Julie Salamon in the June 12, 2004 edition of the New York Times.To be honest I was a little disappointed with 'THIS REVOLUTION'.  Its a good vehicle for some of the ideas (even if some of the ideas are silly) and the acting from Rosario Dawson and Amy Redford is great.  Some of the writing however is over the top and will probably confirm people's perceptions about how activists behave.  It has peaked my interest in future projects of Stephen Marshall though.",3,that revolution,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,3754,"['THIS', 'REVOLUTION', '2004', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Marshallapprox', '95', 'minutesDocumentary', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Marshall', 'shot', 'feature-length', 'narrative', ""'THIS"", 'REVOLUTION', 'results', 'are', 'mixed', 'movie', 'made', 'quite', 'splash', 'was', 'ever', 'released', 'due', 'fact', 'Marshall', 'star', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'were', 'arrested', 'taping', 'movie.The', 'main', 'story', 'cameraman', 'sent', 'get', 'footage', 'protestors', 'Republican', 'National', 'Convention', 'held', 'NYC', '2004', 'romantically', 'involved', 'co-worker', 'corporate', 'newswoman', 'generally', 'cynical', 'attitude', 'politics', 'course', 'work', 'single', 'mother', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'recent', 'Iraq', 'War', 'become', 'more', 'politically', 'active', 'husband', 'death', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'son', 'live', 'cameraman', 'way', 'forced', 'choose', 'sides', 'take', 'responsibility', 'role', 'media', 'coverage', 'current', 'events.Some', 'ideas', ""'THIS"", 'REVOLUTION', 'are', 'good', 'phony', 'superficial', 'dialogue', 'corporate', 'news', 'bunch', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'profanity', 'littered', 'speech', 'activists', 'also', 'sad', 'element', 'truth', 'well', ""n't"", 'make', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'seem', 'less', 'articulate', 'Funny', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'two', 'paths', 'intersect', 'basically', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'rapper', 'Immortal', 'Technique', 'acts', 'corporate', 'girlfriend', 'go', 'get', 'shots', 'hood', 'supposed', 'make', 'sound', 'ridiculous', 'Whats', 'hilarious', 'when', 'go', 'tape', 'one', 'buddies', 'something', 'sound', 'STREETS', 'supposed', 'be', 'serious', 'line', 'dialogue', 'even', 'something', 'Funkmaster', 'Flex', 'commercial.We', 'see', 'many', 'activists', 'interviewed', 'show', 'varying', 'degrees', 'talent', 'sound', 'are', 'reciting', 'lines', 'favorite', 'leaflets', 'whereas', 'others', 'sound', 'more', 'genuine', 'Activism', 'interesting', 'setting', 'dramatic', 'movie', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'movies', 'lines', 'politics', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'transparent', 'get', 'hear', 'theories', 'how', 'certain', 'property', 'should', 'be', 'destroyed', 'lines', 'sounded', 'were', 'lifted', 'Weather', 'Underground', 'One', 'activist', 'given', 'opportunity', 'relay', 'New', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'theory', 'idea', 'September', '11', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'were', 'inside', 'job', 'alluded', 'Project', 'New', 'American', 'Century', 'document', 'Rebuilding', 'America', 'Defenses', 'unsurprising', 'considering', 'one', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Marshall', 'other', 'projects', 'include', '9/11', 'truth', 'documentary', 'featuring', 'militant', 'rapper', 'PARIS.The', 'most', 'interesting', 'segment', 'one', 'artist', 'Arthur', 'Robins', 'used', 'sell', 'paintings', 'Metropolitain', 'museum', 'NYC', 'When', 'decided', 'take', 'break', 'go', 'see', 'latest', 'show', 'woman', 'blamed', 'illegally', 'hanging', 'art', 'museum', 'led', 'Robins', 'being', 'harassed', 'not', 'only', 'museum', 'also', 'later', 'apartment', 'NY', 'police', 'Amazingly', 'was', 'able', 'record', 'behavior', 'shown', ""'THIS"", 'REVOLUTION', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'covered', 'Julie', 'Salamon', 'June', '12', '2004', 'edition', 'New', 'York', 'Times.To', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', ""'THIS"", 'REVOLUTION', 'good', 'vehicle', 'ideas', 'even', 'ideas', 'are', 'silly', 'acting', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Amy', 'Redford', 'great', 'writing', 'however', 'top', 'will', 'probably', 'confirm', 'people', 'perceptions', 'how', 'activists', 'behave', 'peaked', 'interest', 'future', 'projects', 'Stephen', 'Marshall']",N/A

It is a message that should be heard by everyone.  The main character in this movie is Jake Cassevetes, played by music video director Nathan Crooker, who is the videographer, and photographer in the movie.  He is the undercover journalist who is the one who ultimately brings us ""This Revolution."" Rosario Dawson plays the widow of a solider who was killed in Iraq.  Her parts in this movie are brilliant.To address the concerns brought forth by the reviewer ""Wes,"" He states that the scenes between certain actors are painful to watch.  While I wouldn't say painful, they are not the most pleasant.  However, the point of the movie is not a love story, nor does it try to be.
