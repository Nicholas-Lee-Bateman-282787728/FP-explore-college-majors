Not at all like the book. First of all they changed the biologist's name from Erik to Dan. Then they make him a penguin biologist. Give me a break! He was a wolf biologist. Then they add in the parts like the wolf eating a little girl. Never happened in the book. and the worse part was the ending. Erik/Dan is suppose to stay with Alice. But whoever made this film did a total 180 and had the guy go back to his ex-wife. Shudder and gag. As werewolf movies this was marginally ok, especially with the effects. But the low rating is from the fact that it is totally and completely different from the book that it is suppose to be based on.
