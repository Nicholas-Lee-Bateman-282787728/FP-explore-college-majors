I got confused after watching it a bit and asking myself, ""Whose show is this: Keenen Ivory Wayans' or Jada Pinkett's?"" At any rate, it is safe to say that the low down dirty shame by Wayans was giving Jada the role. She killed the film, plain and simple. It is like watching the female Will Smith 2.0.

And there is this stupid Shaft getup going on with a very, very expensive automobile for somebody who is supposed to be broke. Finally, the action scenes are overtly dumb and stupid.

But it's all the fun and silly action that occurs in between that really matters! It's a bit like The Last Boy Scout from a spoof-blaxploitation angle.Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) is a former cop who has been blackballed after a major drugs bust went awry, leaving several DEA agents dead. He now works as a private detective, taking on suicide missions for peanuts and barely scraping by. His disapproving secretary Peaches (a very funny and very, very small Jada Pinkett) wants him to get his act together but he's too busy wallowing in self-pity.His old pal from the DEA shows up and offers him a side mission to help get back at the Drug Kingpin who ruined his career. And so, with only a few clues, Shame begins his search and soon all roads lead to lies and deception. Like I said, the plot is certainly nothing special. But it does contain a helluva lot of laughs and decent action.The one thing I can complain of is that the production design is kind of dated now. Action films have evolved so much in the past decade that watching ALDDS 12 years on can be a bit distracting. Wayans (who also directs as well as writing and starring) too often shoots non-actions scenes like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be.The DVD has a slightly soft 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer with a Dolby 5.1 sound design.

735965,A3RA9ZE9ARIUWD,B00008977B,Julius,"[0, 0]","Ok I'm not one to be a movie snob, but this movie was horrible. It doesn't hold my attention the way movies such as The Rock and Empire do, and those two movies are far more superior compared to this one. Keenan Ivory Wayans takes on the triple threat of star, writer, and director, and Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck he is not. Eastwood and Affleck have churned out some great movies taking on the triple role such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, Blood Work, Gran Torino, and The Town. Those movies are smart, character driven stories. This movie is flat out insipid. Now don't get me wrong because I think Keenan Ivory Wayans is talented. But his best work was on In Living Color, whereas he doesn't have the chops to be in movies. His younger brothers Damon and Marlon on the other hand, teamed up for one of the best comedy movies of the '90s. That movie being Mo' Money. But as I make my third different movie comparison, this movie has nothing on Mo' Money. I can't take Keenan Ivory Wayans seriously as an action hero and he just didn't fit the role as Shame. He would have been better off just directing and having someone like Jamie Foxx star in this movie. Foxx as Shame would have been interesting. Charles S. Dutton was actually good as the deceptive DEA agent Sonny Rothmiller and Andrew Divoff as Mendoza was intimidating and charismatic. Those 2 make this film somewhat watchable. Salli Richardson as Angela, was too plain for my liking. Even when she wasn't being cold and callous, Richardson's attempt to make Angela likable was nothing but a failure. Someone like Jennifer Lopez or Delilah Cotto would have done a better job capturing the likability of Angela. And last but not least, Jada Pinkett Smith. See my Jason's Lyric review about her performance in that movie. As for this movie, she's funny as Peaches, the spunky friend and side kick of Shame. But she gets really annoying as she becomes more of a motor mouth. Her performance here is slightly better than Jason's Lyric. Perhaps I shouldn't unveil the ""spoiler"" about Shame and Peaches, but those of you who plan to see this movie will probably figure it out. The action-comedy movie can be successful and the genre has churned out some good movies such as Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2, both Bad Boys, all three Rush Hour movies, All About The Benjamins, and Money Train. But as I make my fourth comparison in this review, A Low Down Dirty Shame isn't in the same class with those movies of it's genre that I mentioned.

Keenan Ivory Wayans does a great job of mixing action and humor in this cool detective story about a PI looking for $20 million in stolen drug money. The supporting cast is very good here; Jada Pinkett and Salli Richardson aren't just eye candy, they give good performances too. However the only fault is with the film is Charles S. Dutton who overacts as usual. ALDDS is a great popcorn movie that will leave you smiling. Definitely buy it.",5,A really fun movie.
