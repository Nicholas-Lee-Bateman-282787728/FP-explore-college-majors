1074857,A1PJ2G9K7VNOQX,B000QCQ71S,Frank &#34;the man&#34;,"[1, 2]","I was really put off with the first 10 minutes or so of Bernstein's presentation.  He looked hung over (probably was) in a heat wave in Tel Aviv.  He was sweating with his shirt open, looked and sounded awful.  Fortunately, the rest was more formally presented.  However, this is an interesting, if not profound ""essay"", as the jacket notes call it, by one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, on Gustav Mahler (1860-1911), one of the most tormented composers whose music went into obscurity after his death and was banned by the Nazis from 1933-1945. Arturo Toscanini, the greatest conductor before Bernstein, was once asked why he never conducted Mahler.  He said he could not understand or identify with the music.  Bernstein, however, could and is arguably credited with bringing Mahler back from the dead with his set of symphonies recorded with the New York Philharmonic in the early 60s and his tireless promotion and elucidation of both the music, the man, and his life.  This ""essay"" tries to explain Mahler's Jewish roots as they appear in his symphonies on the basis of a single story from Das Knaben Wunderhorn...The Little Drummer Boy.  Bernstein then moves from the young ""Jewish"" Mahler to the Roman Catholic Mahler and finally to his obsession with death.  For many historians, Jewish and Christian alike, this conversion has been written off as being necessary to get the appointment as Music Director of the Vienna State Opera.  Not entirely so, says Lennie and he makes a very good point, much clearer than anyone else I have heard, that there is a logical continuum between ""Jewishness"" and Christianity.  Christianity offers redemption and resurrection...a necessary theological and philosophical corollary, according to Bernstein, to Mahler's impoverished and tragic upbringing as a Jew (I suspect Bernstein speaks autobiographically here, too).  Tied up with all this and Mahler's generally black outlook on life is, according to Bernstein, his obsession with death. Mahler includes in all his major symphonies a funeral march of some kind.  Bernsein goes on to say, ""no other composer was as obsessed with death as Mahler"".  Excerpts from the filmed symphony cycle Bernstein conducted for Deutsche Grammophon are included.  This is not light stuff and I recommend you have a pretty good knowledge of Mahler's 1-6, plus the 9th symphonies, ""Das lied von Erde"" and Das Knaben Wunderhorn plus a good familiarity with Mahler's biography to really appreciate this generally fine presentation.  For the uninitiated, this could be a daunting 85 minutes.",4,Lennie tries to make sense of Mahler,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,2581,"['was', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'Bernstein', 'presentation', 'looked', 'hung', 'probably', 'was', 'heat', 'wave', 'Tel', 'Aviv', 'was', 'sweating', 'shirt', 'open', 'looked', 'sounded', 'awful', 'Fortunately', 'rest', 'was', 'more', 'formally', 'presented', 'However', 'interesting', 'not', 'essay', 'jacket', 'call', 'one', 'greatest', 'conductors', '20th', 'century', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', '1860-1911', 'one', 'most', 'tormented', 'composers', 'music', 'went', 'obscurity', 'death', 'was', 'banned', 'Nazis', '1933-1945', 'Arturo', 'Toscanini', 'greatest', 'conductor', 'Bernstein', 'was', 'once', 'asked', 'why', 'never', 'conducted', 'Mahler', 'said', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'identify', 'music', 'Bernstein', 'however', 'could', 'arguably', 'credited', 'bringing', 'Mahler', 'back', 'dead', 'set', 'symphonies', 'recorded', 'New', 'York', 'Philharmonic', 'early', '60s', 'tireless', 'promotion', 'elucidation', 'music', 'man', 'life', 'essay', 'tries', 'explain', 'Mahler', 'Jewish', 'roots', 'appear', 'symphonies', 'basis', 'single', 'story', 'Das', 'Knaben', 'Wunderhorn', 'Little', 'Drummer', 'Boy', 'Bernstein', 'then', 'young', 'Jewish', 'Mahler', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Mahler', 'finally', 'obsession', 'death', 'many', 'historians', 'Jewish', 'Christian', 'alike', 'conversion', 'been', 'written', 'off', 'being', 'necessary', 'get', 'appointment', 'Music', 'Director', 'Vienna', 'State', 'Opera', 'Not', 'entirely', 'so', 'Lennie', 'very', 'good', 'point', 'much', 'clearer', 'anyone', 'else', 'have', 'heard', 'logical', 'continuum', 'Jewishness', 'Christianity', 'Christianity', 'redemption', 'resurrection', 'necessary', 'theological', 'philosophical', 'corollary', 'according', 'Bernstein', 'Mahler', 'impoverished', 'tragic', 'upbringing', 'Jew', 'suspect', 'Bernstein', 'speaks', 'autobiographically', 'here', 'too', 'Tied', 'up', 'Mahler', 'generally', 'black', 'outlook', 'life', 'according', 'Bernstein', 'obsession', 'death', 'Mahler', 'major', 'symphonies', 'funeral', 'march', 'kind', 'Bernsein', 'say', 'other', 'composer', 'was', 'obsessed', 'death', 'Mahler', 'Excerpts', 'filmed', 'symphony', 'cycle', 'Bernstein', 'conducted', 'Deutsche', 'Grammophon', 'are', 'included', 'not', 'light', 'stuff', 'recommend', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'knowledge', 'Mahler', '1-6', '9th', 'symphonies', 'Das', 'lied', 'von', 'Erde', 'Das', 'Knaben', 'Wunderhorn', 'good', 'familiarity', 'Mahler', 'biography', 'really', 'appreciate', 'generally', 'fine', 'presentation', 'uninitiated', 'could', 'be', 'daunting', '85', 'minutes']",N/A

But Bernstein shows us how Mahler was, like most of us, striving to try to come to terms with life--to understand why death has to come and deprive us of the joys of life.To give you an idea of how concrete, knowledgeable and specific this program is, Lenny takes a few minutes, using musical excerpts, to illustrate how there is a funeral march in each of Mahler's nine symphonies.If you like Mahler, and would like to understand him better, get a friend to watch this with you, and learn at the feet of the master.

1074859,A1VKCMOWYX2OEB,B000QCQ71S,R. Gale,"[7, 14]","I love Mahler, and I love Bernstein; in fact, it was Bernstein's recordings of Mahler with the NY Philharmonic that made me appreciate Mahler.  That said, I found this presentation to be more about Bernstein and Bernstein's attempt to force Mahler's music into his own thesis than about Mahler.  In fact, the most interesting parts of the show are the added biographical information which do not involve Bernstein.  Bernstein would have us believe that Mahler's music sounds ""Jewish"" and goes to great lengths to find little phrases in Mahler's music to ""prove"" this.  Exactly what the difference is between music that sounds ""Jewish"" versus music that sounds gypsy-ish or Polish or Bohemian or any other variety of Eastern European folk music is something Bernstein never explains.  In fact, Mahler was ashamed and burdened by his Jewish background, and went to great lengths to separate himself from it, eventually converting to Catholicism.  So the idea that he would put ""Jewish"" elements (whatever they are) into his music -- even subconsciously -- is a real stretch.  I think even Bernstein knows this, as he has to ask ""did you hear that?""  Even more annoying is Bernstein's own exhibitionism, as he chooses to do part of his presentation with his shirt open!  The performances are certainly splendid, and there's some value in the way Bernstein juxtaposes segments from different works.

1074862,A2UCVVYBZVA8YW,B000QCQ71S,Tom Diaz,"[3, 4]","I was embarrassed to watch this and finally had to just shut it down about halfway, feeling slightly nauseous.  I am a very big fan of Bernstein the conductor, and even of some of his other music education videos.But...this!  Disaster! Where to start?First, the biographical content, beginning with Bernstein's fundamental premise, which is that Gustav Mahler was ashamed that he was a Jew, therefore tried to &#34;hide&#34; the fact (through his notorious conversion), and then was ashamed that he had hidden the thing he was ashamed of.  Hence the reference to the &#34;The Little Drummer Boy,&#34; who is being marched off to the gallows for some unspecified crime--which, in this case, according to Bernstein, is Mahler's Jewish thing.This is drivel. Bernstein is trying to make a strained point he obviously preconceived and then stuffed in whatever scraps, odds and ends, miscellany, and invention he thought supported his ludicrous point. Mahler never tired to hide the fact that he was a Jew, nor could he in his time and place!  It was trumpeted in his face virtually everywhere he went. Bernstein slips in early that Mahler was &#34;Orthodox,&#34; but in reality Mahler was not particularly religious in any sense other than a kind of Deist respect for...whatever it is that so beautifully illuminates his music. His conversion was not an attempt to hide his Jewishness, but rather a careerist move to get the job he wanted all of his life. Was the anyone ever in Vienna, nay the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who did NOT know Mahler was Jewish?One is left to wonder whether Bernstein ever actually studied Mahler's life in any detail, or just skimmed through the &#34;good parts,&#34; and is tempted to conclude that &#34;the little drummer boy here&#34; is in fact an elder Bernstein himself working out his own guilt and hangups about his Jewishness.Second, the musicology. Bernstein invents an oddly vague definition of &#34;Jewish music.&#34;  Odd because he could have zeroed in more precisely on some, Eastern European mainly, forms of music that are preeminently Jewish (Ashkenaz, at least, e.g. klemzer) in their origin and use.  Instead, he casts an ambiguous mantle over any music that has multicultural origins and is &#34;traditional,&#34; especially that incorporates of refers to the Phrygian mode. The result is that he appropriates practically the entirety of the folk tunes of Eastern Europe. If Mahler quoted a Slovenian melody somewhere, anywhere, to Benstein, that's Jewishness poking through the fabric!Third, and finally, the video suffers from production values that a 10-year-old could improve upon.  It takes a strong stomach to get through the opening scene: imagine an aging Leonard Bernstein at the piano with his shirt unbuttoned to the navel, looking and sounding like a slightly tipsy, over-suntanned, and unprepared old lounge lizard.  Was he actually drunk when this was filmed?  Who knows, but the effect is the same, as he reads without fluidity from the prompt cards obviously just out of our vision.  Horrid.Clearly, this whole enterprise was salvaged in post-production, with voice over from a narrator and vicious editing.  Alas, failure. Let's not even get into the corny (and poorly lit) rack shots in the cathedral of whatever saint.  Just bad photography and trite concept.On the positive side, Bernstein the conductor has a firm grasp on his vision of Mahler's great music, so the purely musical parts are in general excellent.
