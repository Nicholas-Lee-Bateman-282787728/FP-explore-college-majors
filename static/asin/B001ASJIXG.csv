But seeing this thing all the way through I can't help but say that this is one of the most vapid, sugary, house-wife oriented films ever produced for the small screen.A ""former"" jewel thief with the motherly instincts of a model PTA member?  Give me a break.  She lacks any kind of street savvy other than to talk to a couple of uninspired actors who are allegedly jewel thieves, one being a fence.The acting is abysmal on all levels.  It's a supposed to be a Christmas film, se we can give it a little wiggle room for having to placate to a niche market; the house mom, but beyond that this thing isn't worth the celluloid that it was filmed on.This house mom is allegedly ""on the lam"" after doing ""a job"", but there's nothing in the sense of desperation, nothing in terms of anything other than an opening sequence where she acts like a cavalier Soccer Mom.  She even removes her mask and veil to let down her long flowing brown hair so that we know who it is tinkering with the high tech burglary equipment.The opening sequence is lack luster, and much of the film is static talking bodies.  It's a made for TV film, so there's budgetary constraints, but B-films have more story meat than this junk.  No movement, no action in terms of characterization, absolutely nothing beyond the actresses talking to one another, with the occasional male popping in.Suddenly I regret removing my initial review, but, in defense of the target audience, I'll say this; if you're a house mom with some criminal fantasy but are completely out of touch with how the real world of thieves operates, than this film is for you.  And that was the original intent in the first place.Otherwise pass it up, or donate the disk to the library.This is truly a waste of time.",2,Vapid and uninspired.,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1809,"['removed', 'initial', 'review', 'thinking', 'be', 'too', 'harsh', 'seeing', 'thing', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'vapid', 'sugary', 'house-wife', 'oriented', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'small', 'screen.A', 'former', 'jewel', 'thief', 'motherly', 'instincts', 'model', 'PTA', 'member', 'Give', 'break', 'kind', 'street', 'savvy', 'other', 'talk', 'couple', 'uninspired', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'allegedly', 'jewel', 'thieves', 'one', 'being', 'fence.The', 'acting', 'abysmal', 'levels', 'supposed', 'be', 'Christmas', 'film', 'can', 'give', 'little', 'wiggle', 'room', 'having', 'placate', 'niche', 'market', 'house', 'mom', 'thing', ""n't"", 'worth', 'celluloid', 'was', 'filmed', 'on.This', 'house', 'mom', 'allegedly', 'lam', 'doing', 'job', 'nothing', 'sense', 'desperation', 'nothing', 'terms', 'anything', 'other', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'cavalier', 'Soccer', 'Mom', 'even', 'mask', 'veil', 'let', 'down', 'long', 'flowing', 'brown', 'hair', 'so', 'know', 'who', 'tinkering', 'high', 'tech', 'burglary', 'equipment.The', 'opening', 'sequence', 'lack', 'luster', 'much', 'film', 'static', 'talking', 'bodies', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'budgetary', 'constraints', 'B-films', 'have', 'more', 'story', 'meat', 'junk', 'movement', 'action', 'terms', 'characterization', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'actresses', 'talking', 'one', 'occasional', 'male', 'popping', 'in.Suddenly', 'regret', 'removing', 'initial', 'review', 'defense', 'target', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'say', ""'re"", 'house', 'mom', 'criminal', 'fantasy', 'are', 'completely', 'touch', 'how', 'real', 'world', 'thieves', 'operates', 'film', 'was', 'original', 'intent', 'first', 'place.Otherwise', 'pass', 'up', 'donate', 'disk', 'library.This', 'truly', 'waste', 'time']",Christmas Caper
