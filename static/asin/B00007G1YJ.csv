You can tell it was not touched up or enhance their fixed or anything else. I suspect that they were not planning on people having 46 inch televisions. The credits in the beginning part of the program are really fuzzy. But when it gets down to talking about Adams he gets down to talk about Adams and many of the photographs mysteriously get sharper. We get so engrossed in the subject matter both Adams and his pictures that we know longer care one way or the other were sharp or not.My only complaint is that it was in a soundbite form. I don't know who designed the program that but they could have focused on one person or another instead of person A, and B, and C, and a, and B, and c, again and again and so forth so forth so forth. It breaks the continuity of thought.For me the experience is enhanced because I've been to most of these places several times. I hope to go back again. I've also been intrigued with the mechanics of photography before it became the digital age. I'm now still interested in digital photography. But photography aside by the time that you get to the end of this program you will feel that you've lost your only friend.This presentation gave me a different way of looking at life and being conservative with what nature has brought us.American Experience: The Wizard of Photography",5,A video biography of Ansel and his works,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,1410,"['DVD', 'video', 'was', 'directly', 'copied', 'PBS', 'American', 'Experience', 'program', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'not', 'touched', 'up', 'enhance', 'fixed', 'anything', 'else', 'suspect', 'were', 'not', 'planning', 'people', 'having', '46', 'inch', 'televisions', 'credits', 'beginning', 'part', 'program', 'are', 'really', 'fuzzy', 'when', 'down', 'talking', 'Adams', 'down', 'talk', 'Adams', 'many', 'photographs', 'mysteriously', 'get', 'sharper', 'get', 'so', 'engrossed', 'subject', 'matter', 'Adams', 'pictures', 'know', 'longer', 'care', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'were', 'sharp', 'not.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'soundbite', 'form', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'designed', 'program', 'could', 'have', 'focused', 'one', 'person', 'instead', 'person', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'c', 'again', 'again', 'so', 'forth', 'so', 'forth', 'so', 'forth', 'continuity', 'thought.For', 'experience', 'enhanced', ""'ve"", 'been', 'most', 'places', 'several', 'times', 'hope', 'go', 'back', 'again', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'intrigued', 'mechanics', 'photography', 'became', 'digital', 'age', ""'m"", 'now', 'still', 'interested', 'digital', 'photography', 'photography', 'aside', 'time', 'get', 'end', 'program', 'will', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'only', 'friend.This', 'presentation', 'gave', 'different', 'way', 'looking', 'life', 'being', 'conservative', 'what', 'nature', 'brought', 'us.American', 'Experience', 'Wizard', 'Photography']",Ansel Adams

One quiet evening the documentary was on tv.  So I decided to give it a try. I was blown away by this man's life and body of work.  I rarely have seen a documentary that has moved me so deeply.  By panning and zooming a corner of a photo was a great peice unto itself.  There will never be another artist like it.  Everything after is merely an imitation of something great. I just decided to buy a copy for myself to show my friends and family. Thanks PBS!!!!,5,It won me over,1094860800,"09 11, 2004",2004,561,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ansel', 'prints', 'stores', 'peoples', 'homes', 'never', 'cared', 'too', 'much', 'guy', 'One', 'quiet', 'evening', 'documentary', 'was', 'tv', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'man', 'life', 'body', 'work', 'rarely', 'have', 'seen', 'documentary', 'moved', 'so', 'deeply', 'panning', 'zooming', 'corner', 'photo', 'was', 'great', 'peice', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'artist', 'Everything', 'merely', 'imitation', 'something', 'great', 'just', 'decided', 'buy', 'copy', 'myself', 'show', 'friends', 'family', 'Thanks', 'PBS']",Ansel Adams

Williams,"[1, 1]","Ansel was an obsessive compulsive who had emotional and financial peaks and valleys that mirrored the contrasts within his photographic subject matter.Many of the photos are breathtaking but cannot be adequately portrayed on screen; they are panned and zoomed to depict entire image but you lose the totality of the entire composition. Nevertheless, the documentary is a good introduction to a larger than life image on both ends of a camera lens.",4,Larger than life,1115510400,"05 8, 2005",2005,447,"['Ansel', 'was', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'who', 'had', 'emotional', 'financial', 'peaks', 'valleys', 'mirrored', 'contrasts', 'photographic', 'subject', 'matter.Many', 'photos', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'adequately', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'are', 'panned', 'zoomed', 'depict', 'entire', 'image', 'lose', 'totality', 'entire', 'composition', 'Nevertheless', 'documentary', 'good', 'introduction', 'larger', 'life', 'image', 'ends', 'camera', 'lens']",Ansel Adams
728336,APPG3AAIJLF1,B00007G1YJ,Stokie Dave,"[5, 5]","A moving and very well-constructed tribute to Adams, the film doesn't shy away from things like his affairs, drinking, over-work, poverty, etc. But the film is all the stronger for this. Some of the most perceptive critics and fellow artists give great insight; as Adams himself rarely talked in any depth about his own work on camera or radio. His large images, most of which would look puny if shown whole on a TV screen, are made accessible by panning and zooming. The film has some absences (Adams sympathetic documenting of a Japanese PoW camp comes to mind), and some of the home-movie footage is used 'out of timeline', but overall it is a very satisfying portrayal of a complex artist.  If you like it first time around, you'll watch it again and again.",5,A lyrical and stirring documentary,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,761,"['moving', 'very', 'well-constructed', 'tribute', 'Adams', 'film', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'things', 'affairs', 'drinking', 'over-work', 'poverty', 'etc', 'film', 'stronger', 'most', 'perceptive', 'critics', 'fellow', 'artists', 'give', 'great', 'insight', 'Adams', 'rarely', 'talked', 'depth', 'own', 'work', 'camera', 'radio', 'large', 'images', 'most', 'would', 'look', 'puny', 'shown', 'whole', 'TV', 'screen', 'are', 'made', 'accessible', 'panning', 'zooming', 'film', 'absences', 'Adams', 'sympathetic', 'documenting', 'Japanese', 'PoW', 'camp', 'mind', 'home-movie', 'footage', 'used', 'timeline', 'overall', 'very', 'satisfying', 'portrayal', 'complex', 'artist', 'like', 'first', 'time', 'around', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again', 'again']",Ansel Adams

We both feel like we've spent 90 minutes in the presence of a brilliant, fascinating, passionate visionary.  We are amazed at his life and work.  In short, this documentary does what any good, short documentary should do: It makes you want to know Adams and his work better.PROS:* Nice biography of Adams' life, highlighting the role his father played in facilitating Ansel's self-directed learning as a youth, his introduction to photography, his marriage (with its ups and downs), etc.  We were able to see what drove Ansel Adams.* Need I say anything about his work?  There has never been and never will be another photographer like Adams.  This documentary just makes me want to sit in front of his photos for hours!* Insights into how his photography and extensive time in the wilderness shaped his philosophy/worldview.* Insights into how he exposed and developed photographs to reveal what he saw as he took the pictures--his embrace of realism.CONS:* The television screen is not an ideal place to view Adams' photos.  Ric Burns did a great job of panning and zooming to allow us to experience Adams' work, but if you're really interested in Adams, you need to buy some of his prints or a coffee table book or find a museum with a collection of Adams photos.  This is not Ric Burns fault--he did an amazing job telling this story.PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION:If you are interested in Ansel Adams, photography, or even just interested in art and the creative process, this is an excellent film.
