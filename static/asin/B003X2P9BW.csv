Lewis Black is one of the smartest, funniest comics around today and his take on the horrors of the holidays is delightfully crazy and all too true. No one is safe. If you don't recognize your own family or yourself in this hilarious truth telling, you are missing a funny bone. This is 94 minutes of Holiday Snark at its best.

I have to be honest and say I did not watch the entire dvd.  After about 20 minutes listening to a few one liners from Lewis Black but mainly other comedian's short and supposedly funny gags as to why they don't like Thanksgiving, I cut my losses and took the disc out of the player.  If I got even one chuckle from it, it was one too many.  Is was not a live performance, just snipets of one liners that were not even worth a grin.  Why Lewis Black agreed to make this sorry attempt at poking fun at the holidays is well beyond me.  He is a comedic genius and this doesn't come close to doing him justice.  I bought this because it is PG rated and I thought it would be appropriate to watch with my elderly mother.  That much was correct.  No profanity or sex jokes but unfortunately no humor either.  My advice is that if you like Lewis Black, try any of his other live standup routines on dvd and steer clear of this. I can't think of another dvd I purchased from Amazon where I wish I could get my money back like this one.",1,Disc makes a nice mini frisbee!,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1166,"['What', 'HUGE', 'let', 'love', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'standup', 'routines', ""'re"", 'buying', 'thinking', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'buyer', 'beware', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'entire', 'dvd', '20', 'minutes', 'listening', 'few', 'one', 'liners', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'mainly', 'other', 'comedian', 'short', 'supposedly', 'funny', 'gags', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Thanksgiving', 'cut', 'losses', 'took', 'disc', 'player', 'got', 'even', 'one', 'chuckle', 'was', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'Is', 'was', 'not', 'live', 'performance', 'just', 'snipets', 'one', 'liners', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'grin', 'Why', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'agreed', 'make', 'sorry', 'attempt', 'poking', 'fun', 'holidays', 'well', 'comedic', 'genius', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'doing', 'justice', 'bought', 'PG', 'rated', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'appropriate', 'watch', 'elderly', 'mother', 'much', 'was', 'correct', 'profanity', 'sex', 'jokes', 'unfortunately', 'humor', 'either', 'My', 'advice', 'like', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'try', 'other', 'live', 'standup', 'routines', 'dvd', 'steer', 'clear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'dvd', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'where', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'one']",N/A
