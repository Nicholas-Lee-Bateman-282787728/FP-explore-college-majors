It should be a good story, a good cast and make the viewer feel warm and misty- this hits each mark with gusto. In this age of dozens of dreck (rememember when there were but a decent few gems, instead of the Xmas movie of the day from Hallmark or ABC Family Channel) ""IBHFC"" should be on your calendar each year.Featuring a venerable cast including a curmudgeonly, but surprisingly great Jack Palance, Ann Jillian, Robert Hayes and Ashley Gorrell the plot centers around the widowed Hays as a doctor whose lost his mojo and returns to his small hometown of St. Nicholas, Iowa with his daughter in tow to visit his aging dad Palance. The town is in desparate need of a doctor to replace the deceased physician or its hospital is in jeopardy of closing, foreshadowing the demise of the town, so the town led by the Mayor (and local veterinarian) Jillian, Dr. Mike's childhood sweetheart joins together to woo him and his daughter to return and stay forever home for the holidays.Facing professional struggles and having lost his way, Dr. Mike finds support and love and a renewal of faith and his daughter- "" former child of the big city"" discovers a relationship with her grandfather and love for small town life and values.Surprisingly warm and fuzzy, IBHFC generates a warm holiday glow and enough drama and warmth to make the viewer teary eyed yet not morose. great that it is now available at a resonable priced general release on DVD.This one has become a staple on our holiday viewing list and it should be on yours.
