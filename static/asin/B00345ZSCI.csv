What is waiting for us?""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" never really asks those questions. Instead, this delicate, dreamlike film focuses on a house full of ""funeral ghost"" ghosts, and a young lady who lives alongside them. The first half is a meandering, messy nonplot, but it later gels into a haunting meditation onZel (Angela Bettis) lives in her late grandmother's old house, but not alone. For many years, she has lived with several ghosts, including a suicidal bride, a flapper, a randy priest, an embittered actor, a blind band that plays music all day, and a silent little girl. By day, Zel works as a psychic and a medium, while the ghosts meander about their own business.Then one day, the ghosts see a bright light outside, and attempt to go into it... you know, the way dead people are supposed to. But they're unable to leave the house. They jump to the conclusion that Zel has somehow trapped them inside the house, and decide to make her life a misery until she releases them... but the truth is rarely so simple.The first half of ""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" is kind of a mess -- everybody just meanders around aimlessly, chitchatting and occasionally doing little dances. And while the direction is lovely, we have these interludes where we just see the ghostly musicians diddling around on various instruments.But once the ghosts demand their freedom, their story quietly gels together with Zel's, blossoming into a soft, bittersweet little finale. Director Tim Rutili wraps the entire movie in a sort of blurry twilight atmosphere, with wobbly camerawork and little superstitions that pop up between scenes. The haunting direction fits the story, and adds the feeling that Zel's house is its own little world.And Angela Bettis gives a brilliant, understated performance as a young woman who, because of the ghosts that form her ""family,"" has never really gotten to be a part of the living world. She can't even make out with her boyfriend without the dead crowding her, and mortal dangers don't seem to register. We see Zel when she's frazzled, when she's sad, and eventually when she is embarking on a new life.If there's a problem with the characterization, it's that the ghosts feel underdeveloped -- the actors are quite good, especially the suicidal bride, the stately muttonchop-wearing man, and the languid flapper. But we don't hear much about them except their deaths.""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" drags for its first half, only to blossom into a dried white rose in its second half. Worth seeing, if you like experimental films.",3,I trapped the funeral singers,1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,2688,"['One', 'thing', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'speculating', 'about', 'death', 'What', 'Where', 'do', 'go', 'What', 'waiting', 'My', 'Friends', 'Are', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'never', 'really', 'questions', 'Instead', 'delicate', 'dreamlike', 'film', 'house', 'full', 'funeral', 'ghost', 'ghosts', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'alongside', 'first', 'half', 'meandering', 'messy', 'nonplot', 'later', 'haunting', 'meditation', 'onZel', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'late', 'grandmother', 'old', 'house', 'not', 'alone', 'many', 'years', 'lived', 'several', 'ghosts', 'including', 'suicidal', 'bride', 'flapper', 'randy', 'priest', 'embittered', 'actor', 'blind', 'band', 'music', 'day', 'silent', 'little', 'girl', 'day', 'Zel', 'psychic', 'medium', 'ghosts', 'meander', 'own', 'business.Then', 'one', 'day', 'ghosts', 'see', 'bright', 'light', 'attempt', 'go', 'know', 'way', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', ""'re"", 'unable', 'leave', 'house', 'jump', 'conclusion', 'Zel', 'somehow', 'trapped', 'house', 'decide', 'make', 'life', 'misery', 'truth', 'rarely', 'so', 'simple.The', 'first', 'half', 'My', 'Friends', 'Are', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'kind', 'mess', 'everybody', 'just', 'meanders', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'chitchatting', 'occasionally', 'doing', 'little', 'dances', 'direction', 'lovely', 'have', 'interludes', 'where', 'just', 'see', 'ghostly', 'diddling', 'around', 'various', 'instruments.But', 'ghosts', 'demand', 'freedom', 'story', 'quietly', 'together', 'Zel', 'blossoming', 'soft', 'bittersweet', 'little', 'finale', 'Director', 'Tim', 'Rutili', 'entire', 'movie', 'sort', 'blurry', 'twilight', 'atmosphere', 'wobbly', 'camerawork', 'little', 'superstitions', 'pop', 'up', 'scenes', 'haunting', 'direction', 'story', 'feeling', 'Zel', 'house', 'own', 'little', 'world.And', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'brilliant', 'understated', 'performance', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'ghosts', 'form', 'family', 'never', 'really', 'gotten', 'be', 'part', 'living', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'dead', 'crowding', 'mortal', 'dangers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'register', 'see', 'Zel', 'when', 'frazzled', 'when', 'sad', 'eventually', 'when', 'embarking', 'new', 'life.If', 'problem', 'characterization', 'ghosts', 'feel', 'underdeveloped', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'suicidal', 'bride', 'stately', 'muttonchop-wearing', 'man', 'languid', 'flapper', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'except', 'deaths', 'My', 'Friends', 'Are', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'drags', 'first', 'half', 'only', 'blossom', 'dried', 'white', 'rose', 'second', 'half', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'like', 'experimental', 'films']",N/A
1320785,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00345ZSCI,Haunted Flower,"[1, 3]","""All My Friends Are Funeral Singers"" was written and directed by Tim Rutili and stars Angela Bettis as Zel, a psychic running a business out of her home at the edge of the woods that lives with a large number of ghosts dressed in white that interact around her playing instruments and giving her answers to give to her clients. All is well working in harmony until the ghosts want to move on to the bright light and find they cannot.After a mysterious light appears at the windows during the night, the ghosts want to go to it and find themselves trapped. At first they blame Zel like she is keeping them there and she has to dig into her past to try and come up with a solution for them. Their presence effects every part of her life, her career, her home life, and her relationship with her boyfriend whom she practically ignores when he visits since she is enraptured by the presence of all her friends in white around her like she's the most popular girl in school. Zel must be a very lonely person to rely so heavily on the ghosts' company when they are so noisy and argumentative all the time.The ghosts all discuss theories about what happened to them and try to rationalize points of their lives and talk to the camera like it is a documentary/reality-type format like ""The Office"" for some reason. Zel herself is never interviewed so it is hard to figure out her objectives when she just gazes at them and accepts them as a normal part of her family. The ghosts argue about their sex lives, their deaths, and whatever else they can think of in these asides. It is a very strange situation because Zel and the ghosts have very few interactive conversations and the ghosts mostly talk amongst themselves and play with the answering machine.One man comes to see Zel at her home for her psychic powers in predicting winning race horses which one of her ghosts always gives her the answers to. There is also a woman who is supposed to be a friend of Zel's, but always asks Zel to summon the spirit of her late husband. Zel acts as a medium for the husband to communicate through in his own voice with her mouth moving and this amazing phenomena is taking place and all the couple can do is bicker. He keeps yelling at his wife for waking him up and summoning him again! Apparently this process is very taxing on Zel so it is hard to gauge why she bothers going through this for this woman who is clearing using her.It is a confusing movie and also a very noisy movie! All the trains running through this movie remind me of a house I grew up in near a train track. All the ghosts act like they are in a tribal band when they want attention and are constantly hitting drums and shaking tambourines and maracas. It is about as headache inducing for the audience as it is for the protagonist! They are a lot less like ""funeral singers"" and a lot more like a never ending drum circle.After some research, it turns out that the ghosts in this film are the band Califone and they released an album in 2009 called ""All My Friends are Funeral Singers"" and this film was being written at the same time based on their track list. Is this movie a vehicle for the album or the album a vehicle for the movie? Either way there is a story they wanted to tell visually and musically, but so much focus was put on the music portion that very little was put into the writing of dialogue or fleshing out of the plot.If you like Califone's music, then this film will be wonderful for you. Otherwise it is a lot more hassle than it is worth to sit through and can induce a headache unfortunately. For an interesting concept, it was not carried out well.Bonus Features:There are ghost interviews laced throughout the film to get their perspective on their death and why they feel they are still around and haven't advanced into the after-after life. There is a feature that allows you to see longer segments of those interviews.There is a music video for the song, ""Funeral Singers"" that plays near the end of the movie. There is also a live Califone performance on the film's set of ""Polish Girls"". ""Paper Shoes"" and ""Joe's Ear"" are two more songs that are played in the bonus features section, these are NOT featurettes, just music, no explanation. There is also a longer sequence of a scene of a ghost listening to an answering machine. These featurettes do not remark on the movie, the making of the movie, or interview any cast or crew. They are just extended scenes and deleted musical numbers.",1,All her ghost friends are noisy & annoying!,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,4481,"['My', 'Friends', 'Are', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'was', 'written', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Rutili', 'stars', 'Angela', 'Bettis', 'Zel', 'psychic', 'running', 'business', 'home', 'edge', 'woods', 'large', 'number', 'ghosts', 'dressed', 'white', 'interact', 'playing', 'instruments', 'giving', 'answers', 'give', 'clients', 'well', 'working', 'harmony', 'ghosts', 'want', 'move', 'bright', 'light', 'can', 'not', '.After', 'mysterious', 'light', 'windows', 'night', 'ghosts', 'want', 'go', 'find', 'trapped', 'first', 'blame', 'Zel', 'keeping', 'dig', 'past', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'solution', 'presence', 'effects', 'part', 'life', 'career', 'home', 'life', 'relationship', 'boyfriend', 'whom', 'practically', 'when', 'enraptured', 'presence', 'friends', 'white', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'Zel', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'lonely', 'person', 'rely', 'so', 'heavily', 'ghosts', 'company', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'noisy', 'argumentative', 'time.The', 'ghosts', 'discuss', 'theories', 'what', 'happened', 'try', 'rationalize', 'points', 'lives', 'talk', 'camera', 'documentary/reality-type', 'format', 'Office', 'reason', 'Zel', 'never', 'interviewed', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'objectives', 'when', 'just', 'gazes', 'accepts', 'normal', 'part', 'family', 'ghosts', 'argue', 'sex', 'lives', 'deaths', 'else', 'can', 'think', 'asides', 'very', 'strange', 'situation', 'Zel', 'ghosts', 'have', 'very', 'few', 'interactive', 'conversations', 'ghosts', 'mostly', 'talk', 'amongst', 'play', 'answering', 'machine.One', 'man', 'see', 'Zel', 'home', 'psychic', 'powers', 'predicting', 'winning', 'race', 'horses', 'one', 'ghosts', 'always', 'answers', 'also', 'woman', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'friend', 'Zel', 'always', 'Zel', 'summon', 'spirit', 'late', 'husband', 'Zel', 'acts', 'medium', 'husband', 'communicate', 'own', 'voice', 'mouth', 'moving', 'amazing', 'phenomena', 'taking', 'place', 'couple', 'can', 'do', 'bicker', 'yelling', 'wife', 'waking', 'up', 'summoning', 'again', 'Apparently', 'process', 'very', 'taxing', 'Zel', 'hard', 'gauge', 'why', 'going', 'woman', 'who', 'clearing', 'using', 'her.It', 'confusing', 'movie', 'also', 'very', 'noisy', 'movie', 'trains', 'running', 'movie', 'remind', 'house', 'grew', 'up', 'train', 'track', 'ghosts', 'act', 'are', 'tribal', 'band', 'when', 'want', 'attention', 'are', 'constantly', 'hitting', 'drums', 'shaking', 'tambourines', 'maracas', 'headache', 'inducing', 'audience', 'protagonist', 'are', 'lot', 'less', 'funeral', 'singers', 'lot', 'more', 'never', 'ending', 'drum', 'circle.After', 'research', 'out', 'ghosts', 'film', 'are', 'band', 'Califone', 'released', 'album', '2009', 'called', 'My', 'Friends', 'are', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'written', 'same', 'time', 'based', 'track', 'list', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'album', 'album', 'vehicle', 'movie', 'way', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'visually', 'musically', 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'was', 'put', 'music', 'portion', 'very', 'little', 'was', 'put', 'writing', 'dialogue', 'fleshing', 'plot.If', 'Califone', 'music', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'Otherwise', 'lot', 'more', 'hassle', 'worth', 'sit', 'can', 'induce', 'headache', 'unfortunately', 'interesting', 'concept', 'was', 'not', 'carried', 'out', 'well.Bonus', 'Features', 'are', 'ghost', 'interviews', 'laced', 'film', 'get', 'perspective', 'death', 'why', 'feel', 'are', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'advanced', 'after-after', 'life', 'feature', 'see', 'longer', 'segments', 'music', 'video', 'song', 'Funeral', 'Singers', 'end', 'movie', 'also', 'live', 'Califone', 'performance', 'film', 'set', 'Polish', 'Girls', 'Paper', 'Shoes', 'Joe', 'Ear', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'songs', 'are', 'played', 'bonus', 'section', 'are', 'NOT', 'featurettes', 'just', 'music', 'explanation', 'also', 'longer', 'sequence', 'scene', 'ghost', 'listening', 'answering', 'machine', 'featurettes', 'do', 'not', 'remark', 'movie', 'making', 'movie', 'interview', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'just', 'extended', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'musical', 'numbers']",N/A

Zel lives in a house that has about a dozen ghosts, all dressed in white, which only she can see. She gets along nicely with the ghosts and they with her. There are essentially three kinds of ghosts: There is a set of blind musicians who play strange repetitive music throughout the film, which helps set the film's mood. There is another group of ghosts who do not seem to interact with the musicians, including a clergyman who was struck dead by lightning and a bride who hung herself with ""something blue."" These two spirits constantly make out with each other. There is also a man who drank rubbing alcohol and a woman so attached to carbonated drinks that she took a bath in it. The drinks killed both of them. There are also others. The third ""group"" is a single young girl who is very attached to Zel. She is moot, but she helps Zel perform many psychic feats, such as getting rid of a woman's headache, helping this woman talk (actually squabble) with her dead husband (a humorous interlude), and telling a gambler which horses will win races. This young girl does not interact with the other spirits, but watches them. We have no idea how the ghosts came to live in Zel's house, and neither do they know. Zel sometimes wants to be alone, so she cuts off the ghosts from entering her bedroom by pouring salt across the threshold.The relationship between the house occupants is good until the ghosts realize that at 3 AM a very bright light appears. They understand that if they enter the light, they would be free from the house. However, when they try to leave the house and enter the light, they are inflicted with enormous pain. They tell Zel that they now know that Zel is imprisoning them, and they want her to let them go.Viewers will discover where the spirits came from? How were they imprisoned? How long were they in the house? Will Zel help them leave and thereby loose her ability to use psychic powers? Who is the moot young girl? Why does she show special love to Zel?",4,Unusual but well-worth the time to see it,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,2159,"['film', 'unusual', 'very', 'sober', 'plot', 'line', 'deals', 'fortune', 'teller', 'ghosts', 'not', 'frightening', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'so', 'unusual', 'Zel', 'house', 'dozen', 'ghosts', 'dressed', 'white', 'only', 'can', 'see', 'along', 'nicely', 'ghosts', 'are', 'essentially', 'three', 'kinds', 'ghosts', 'set', 'blind', 'musicians', 'who', 'play', 'strange', 'repetitive', 'music', 'film', 'set', 'film', 'mood', 'group', 'ghosts', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'interact', 'musicians', 'including', 'clergyman', 'who', 'was', 'struck', 'dead', 'lightning', 'bride', 'who', 'hung', 'something', 'blue', 'two', 'spirits', 'constantly', 'make', 'out', 'other', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'rubbing', 'alcohol', 'woman', 'so', 'attached', 'carbonated', 'drinks', 'took', 'bath', 'drinks', 'killed', 'are', 'also', 'others', 'third', 'group', 'single', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'very', 'attached', 'Zel', 'moot', 'Zel', 'perform', 'many', 'psychic', 'feats', 'such', 'getting', 'rid', 'woman', 'headache', 'helping', 'woman', 'talk', 'actually', 'squabble', 'dead', 'husband', 'humorous', 'interlude', 'telling', 'gambler', 'horses', 'will', 'win', 'races', 'young', 'girl', 'not', 'interact', 'other', 'spirits', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'ghosts', 'came', 'live', 'Zel', 'house', 'do', 'know', 'Zel', 'sometimes', 'be', 'alone', 'ghosts', 'entering', 'bedroom', 'pouring', 'salt', 'threshold.The', 'relationship', 'house', 'occupants', 'good', 'ghosts', 'realize', '3', 'AM', 'very', 'bright', 'light', 'understand', 'enter', 'light', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'house', 'However', 'when', 'try', 'leave', 'house', 'enter', 'light', 'are', 'inflicted', 'enormous', 'pain', 'tell', 'Zel', 'now', 'know', 'Zel', 'imprisoning', 'want', 'let', 'go.Viewers', 'will', 'discover', 'where', 'spirits', 'came', 'How', 'were', 'imprisoned', 'How', 'long', 'were', 'house', 'Will', 'Zel', 'help', 'leave', 'thereby', 'loose', 'ability', 'use', 'psychic', 'powers', 'Who', 'moot', 'young', 'girl', 'Why', 'show', 'special', 'love', 'Zel']",N/A
