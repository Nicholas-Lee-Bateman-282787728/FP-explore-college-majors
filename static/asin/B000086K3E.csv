734170,A2IVCG4IILTY6O,B000086K3E,"abt1950 ""abt1950""","[29, 30]","Spencer Wells is the current star of genetic evolutionary studies.  As a student of Luca Cavalli-Sforza, he followed his mentor's lead in tracing the history of human migrations by means of the statistical analysis of genetic variation.  Rather than using mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother's line, as previous researches have done, Wells studies changes on the Y chromosome, which every male inherits directly from his father and his father before him.  By comparing the Y chromosomes of men in many distant populations, he and his colleagues have put together a ""family tree,"" that delineates when different branches of the human family diverged from each other and where they went geographically.  He is currently the moving force behind the National Geographic Society's Genographic Project, the successor to the controversial Human Genomic Diversity Project of a few years back.This particular documentary was originally broadcast on PBS several years ago.  In it, Wells physically recreates the journey of modern Homo sapiens out of Africa approximately 60,000 years ago and retraces the paths taken various groups into India, Australia, Central Asia, Siberia, Europe, and America.  Many of these sequences are fascinating--Wells not only provides the science, but also gives glimpses of the landscapes, the people today, and the challenges faced by their ancestors.  His ultimate conclusion, which will be familiar to any student of anthropology, is that the genetic differences between racial groups are far less important than the similarities. In other words, we are all one unified, genetic family.  Race may be a powerful concept culturally, but biologically Wells demonstrates that it's fatally flawed..So, why have I given this DVD only 4 instead of 5 stars?  It's lushly done and visually stunning.  However, it has some flaws.  One of these is flabby editing.  Too much screen time is given to Well's off-topic ramblings.  For instance, there is a sequence of several minutes wasted on Wells while he waits in a bleak Siberian hotel room to get permission from Russian authorities to visit the Chuckchi.  At times, ""The Journey of Man"" has the feeling of a documentary that was too long for one time slot and not long enough for the next size up.  Also, the unremitting focus on Wells himself does not give adequate credit to his many scientific collaborators.But these are stylistic quibbles.  I also have some reservations about the theoretical underpinnings on which the documentary rests.  First and foremost is Well's adoption of what seems to be an extreme ""Out of Africa"" (""Replacement"") version of the origins of modern Homo sapiens.  According to this view, homo sapiens as a species evolved in Africa; moved out into the Middle East, Asia, and Europe; and replaced existing populations of Homo erectus and Neanderthals without interbreeding.  These older populations would have contributed nothing to the modern human gene pool.  This theory is in contrast to the ""Multiregional Theory,"" which suggests a parallel evolution of local populations into modern homo sapiens and a lot of interbreeding with neighboring populations as well as with the African newcomers.  The former explains the genetic data better, but the latter fits the fossil evidence. The ""Out of Africa"" theory has been dominant for a number of years, but recently a modified ""Out of Africa"" version which allows for some interbreeding by local populations is gaining ground.  This probably wouldn't have affected any of Wells' conclusions, but the documentary would have been less one-sided had he at least mentioned both theories.Wells also relies on a controversial theory of cognitive development that suggests that early homo sapiens may have looked like modern humans by around 100,000 years ago, but that brain development lagged far behind.  According to this theory, somewhere around 60,000 years ago, there was a ""great cognitive leap forward,"" during which the human brain became essentially modern.  This qualitative leap accounts for the rapid expansion of  artifacts of cultural significance that appear in the archaeological record after that date.  The new abilities of our ancestors' brains allowed them think in symbolic terms and to behave in increasingly complex ways.  But not all paleoanthropolgists take this view, and every discovery of an earlier artifact that can be associated with symbolic behavior undermines the theory.Nonetheless, when all is said and done, this is a useful documentary.  I show segments of it to my Physical Anthropology class every year, and the responses are uniformly positive.  I'll give this one a qualified recommendation.",4,Padded but beautifully photographed & occasionally compelling survey of human genetic history,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,4695,"['Spencer', 'Wells', 'current', 'star', 'genetic', 'evolutionary', 'studies', 'student', 'Luca', 'Cavalli-Sforza', 'followed', 'mentor', 'lead', 'tracing', 'history', 'human', 'migrations', 'means', 'statistical', 'analysis', 'genetic', 'variation', 'Rather', 'using', 'mitochondrial', 'DNA', 'inherited', 'only', 'mother', 'line', 'previous', 'researches', 'have', 'done', 'Wells', 'studies', 'changes', 'Y', 'chromosome', 'male', 'inherits', 'directly', 'father', 'father', 'comparing', 'Y', 'chromosomes', 'men', 'many', 'distant', 'populations', 'colleagues', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'family', 'tree', 'when', 'different', 'branches', 'human', 'family', 'diverged', 'other', 'where', 'went', 'geographically', 'currently', 'moving', 'force', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Society', 'Genographic', 'Project', 'successor', 'controversial', 'Human', 'Genomic', 'Diversity', 'Project', 'few', 'years', 'back.This', 'particular', 'documentary', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'PBS', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'Wells', 'physically', 'journey', 'modern', 'Homo', 'Africa', 'approximately', '60,000', 'years', 'ago', 'paths', 'taken', 'various', 'groups', 'India', 'Australia', 'Central', 'Asia', 'Siberia', 'Europe', 'America', 'Many', 'sequences', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Wells', 'not', 'only', 'science', 'also', 'glimpses', 'landscapes', 'people', 'today', 'challenges', 'faced', 'ancestors', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'student', 'anthropology', 'genetic', 'differences', 'racial', 'groups', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'important', 'similarities', 'other', 'words', 'are', 'one', 'unified', 'genetic', 'family', 'Race', 'may', 'be', 'powerful', 'concept', 'culturally', 'biologically', 'Wells', 'fatally', 'flawed..So', 'why', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'only', '4', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'lushly', 'done', 'visually', 'stunning', 'However', 'flaws', 'One', 'flabby', 'editing', 'Too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Well', 'off-topic', 'ramblings', 'instance', 'sequence', 'several', 'minutes', 'wasted', 'Wells', 'bleak', 'Siberian', 'hotel', 'room', 'get', 'permission', 'Russian', 'authorities', 'visit', 'Chuckchi', 'times', 'Journey', 'Man', 'feeling', 'documentary', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'time', 'slot', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'next', 'size', 'up', 'Also', 'unremitting', 'focus', 'Wells', 'not', 'give', 'adequate', 'credit', 'many', 'scientific', 'collaborators.But', 'are', 'stylistic', 'quibbles', 'also', 'have', 'reservations', 'theoretical', 'underpinnings', 'documentary', 'rests', 'First', 'foremost', 'Well', 'adoption', 'what', 'be', 'extreme', 'Africa', 'Replacement', 'version', 'origins', 'modern', 'Homo', 'sapiens', 'According', 'view', 'homo', 'sapiens', 'species', 'evolved', 'Africa', 'moved', 'out', 'Middle', 'East', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'replaced', 'existing', 'populations', 'Homo', 'erectus', 'Neanderthals', 'interbreeding', 'older', 'populations', 'would', 'have', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'modern', 'human', 'gene', 'pool', 'theory', 'contrast', 'Multiregional', 'Theory', 'parallel', 'evolution', 'local', 'populations', 'modern', 'homo', 'sapiens', 'lot', 'interbreeding', 'neighboring', 'populations', 'as', 'well', 'African', 'newcomers', 'former', 'genetic', 'data', 'better', 'latter', 'fossil', 'evidence', 'Out', 'Africa', 'theory', 'been', 'dominant', 'number', 'years', 'recently', 'modified', 'Africa', 'version', 'interbreeding', 'local', 'populations', 'gaining', 'ground', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'affected', 'Wells', 'conclusions', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'less', 'one-sided', 'had', 'least', 'mentioned', 'theories.Wells', 'also', 'controversial', 'theory', 'cognitive', 'development', 'early', 'homo', 'sapiens', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'modern', 'humans', '100,000', 'years', 'ago', 'brain', 'development', 'lagged', 'far', 'According', 'theory', 'somewhere', '60,000', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'great', 'cognitive', 'leap', 'forward', 'human', 'brain', 'became', 'essentially', 'modern', 'qualitative', 'leap', 'accounts', 'rapid', 'expansion', 'artifacts', 'cultural', 'significance', 'appear', 'archaeological', 'record', 'date', 'new', 'abilities', 'ancestors', 'brains', 'allowed', 'think', 'symbolic', 'terms', 'behave', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'ways', 'not', 'paleoanthropolgists', 'take', 'view', 'discovery', 'earlier', 'artifact', 'can', 'be', 'associated', 'symbolic', 'behavior', 'theory.Nonetheless', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'useful', 'documentary', 'show', 'segments', 'Physical', 'Anthropology', 'class', 'year', 'responses', 'are', 'uniformly', 'positive', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', 'qualified', 'recommendation']",Journey of Man VHS

Backtracking markers in the Y chromosome we can theoretically have a very good idea of the long voyage of migration that sent our ancestors to spread all around the world.His theory of the first voyage to Australia is quite solid, as is the central Asian destination as the way point that separated small groups in different directions.Wells also tries to explain the motivators and enablers that allowed that epic endeavor; the answer to both questions was...the ice age; although he also explores several anthropological achievements like art and language as enablers that increased the chances of survival of humankind.There are small questions that the author, being a geneticist, should have included in this documentary. As an example I can mention the fact that most Europeans have a very small percentage (but impossible to ignore) of Homo Neandartalensis DNA. That might have stirred the clear streamlined idea the author wants to clarify. It would raise other hypotheses, variables. But this documentary is quite big, it could have less fillers and more scientific data, or even other theories (even if only for the author stating why he didn't agreed with them).In conclusion, this is a very worthy work, which might be eye opening for many.

734173,ANPCOOQW2YAIG,B000086K3E,Dustin,"[156, 168]","I first saw this when it premiered on PBS while I was at the beginning of my world travels in January 2003.  One of the reasons I quit my job to go traveling was to satisfy my desire to know the truth about religion and spirituality. I traveled throughout Asia (As far West as India & Nepal), Australia, South America, and parts of Arabia.  Africa awaits.The show on PBS couldn't have been more timely as I watched it in a hotel room while in Arizona. (Started with a cross country USA drive) I have read/studied & watched numerous videos and books on evolution, different religions, etc... at least from a scientific standpoint this video in one stroke puts MANY (Not all) of the claims of various religions / belief systems into the category of ""Comfort stories."" THAT IS - if you believe in the science.I found quite interesting the reaction of some of the people when confronted with these new discoveries.  Old habits/beliefs die hard as evidenced by world events today and in the past century of rapid scientific thought and change on our world.  Granted, the host Spencer Wells could have presented some of his findings in a slightly more ""soothing"" manner to some of the target groups. But, he recognized this early on I think and modified his approach. His enthusiasm and confidence are infectious and make watching the video fun - even after I watched it again on DVD since I have returned from traveling.This show is so compelling and complete in its coverage of how we/man evolved and traveled out of Africa. Dr. Wells travels to Namibia, Kazakhstan, Siberia, Arizona, Brazil, North Australia, and South India among other places. He incorporates interviews with other scientists to support his work - such as linguists.  While I didn't use DNA analysis in my travels to answer my questions, my insights into human psychology and observation of behavior only complemented what is in the video.This is one of those videos (BBC's Blue Planet is another one) that I place in a special category of videos that should be mass distributed for free to every household possible around the world.I also *HIGHLY* recommend the Shape of Life 4-DVD set, the logical prequel to the Journey of Man.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 3]","This excellent documentary--I cannot stop talking about it and my wife is ready to kill me--truly illustrates in a beautiful way the new field of genetic archeology. Spearheaded (and hosted) by Dr. Spencer Wells, the director of the Human Genome Project with National Geographic (and with IBM), this takes us on the journey our ancestors took. ALL of our ancestors.Dr. Wells, who is a leading figure in human ancestry and studied under the founder of anthropological genetics research, Dr. Luca Cavalli-Sforza, plows forward across the globe, showing us how our ancestors left Africa (and from where they departed); he takes us into the Middle East, tracks them to of all places Kazakhstan (the true cradle of Indo-Europeans, as it turns out) where Dr. Wells meets up with a man directly descended from the father of all white, Asian, Native and Aborigine people.Dr. Wells discovered most of this on his own, though the research has been there for two or three generations. As an Indo-Europeanologist, I knew about the migration theories, and this one was well known though hotly debated. Dr. Wells has proved that theory now. In the Middle East, our ancestors made beelines for India, China and many stayed in modern Kazakhstan. Some doubled back to Europe and the white people were born. Another thread, related to those who walked to Australia via India, went to Siberia then came here. The Chukchi of Siberia got their photos shown to their closest cousins, the Navajos.I do like the way a Navajo elder put Wells in his place. ""Why do you call our traditions a myth? They are our experiences."" Wells did not like that, but the elder is correct. The Navajos believe they originated right were they live today. In a sense, it's true: Wells thinks the Navajo and other Native ancestors may have numbered only a dozen proto-Chukchi tribespeople originally.What I do not like is the pushing of the Beringia/Bering-Strait crossing theory, nor do I think it is accurate to state ""Europe was empty"" when it was well populated by Neanderthals, but oh well....This documentary sparkles with fact and information.

These people have never let logic and science get in the way of their prejudices anyway and so even this brilliant dvd is probably not going to change much the ""thinking"" among those guys and yet it is still very heartening to know that science has now objectively proven that we are all truly one big family.Just as no one race has a monopoly on intelligence, no one race has a monopoly on inventions and scientific discoveries as well.  What struck me is how inventive our ancestors were in adapting to their environment and to survive be it in the harsh conditions of the Arctic Tundra or the predator invested plains of Western Europe using simple tools and their brains to survive.  Subsequent generations were able to build upon the learnings of previous generations so that humans not only survived but thrived to quickly dominate the planet.Europeans are not responsible for all the great discoveries of the world but benefitted from the previous learnings of other races too.  The Arabs invented algebra and gave us our alphabet script, the Indians invented many important concepts such as chess to the zero, the Chinese invented too many things to mention here and all these inventions/discoveries were borrowed and adapted to add to the collective knowledge of humankind.Since we all come from a common ancestor and have evolved to suit our unique environments, we all developed unique tools to suit our situations.

Wingard ""The Music Maven""","[33, 45]","Put on your most expensive hiking boots and settle in for this trek around the globe in which you will follow the sparse tracks of our ancestors found by geneticist Spencer Wells (and other scientists) on the genetic trail of human evolution.Science is rarely so attractive. And most of us certainly aren't well off enough to sport a wardrobe of Northface gear and travel around the world. What is with PBS and these boyish well-groomed scientists with expertly styled hair? 50% of the film was watching Spencer walk around or close-ups of his mug, albeit it was not an entirely bad-looking one.There is amazingly beautiful scenery in this film and it is interesting to see the small glimpses of the cultures of the native peoples of various lands in between shots of Spencers pensive profile. We visit our distant cousins the Bushmen, Chukti, Navajo, Frenchmen, Kazakhstanis, the descendents of the Dravidians, and the Aboriginies.Another criticism of the film, other than the camera's obsession with Spencer, is that he states erroneously that only the Y-Chromosome can be used for such a study because only it is passed down from father to son. While it is true that only men have the Y chromosome, many anthropologists and their collaborating geneticists are using mitochondrial DNA, passed down from mother to daughter.There is a lot of filler in this drawn-out film but it does showcase rarely-seen in difficult to reach areas of the world. It diagrams some of the hardships that early humans struggled through, and the many beautiful lands we've traversed in our collective genetic history. There may be more branches, perhaps we may even discover our family tree has a divergent trunk, but for now, Spencer has drawn the family ties closer in a film partly designed to bring us all together.",3,"The Meandering ""Journey of Man""",1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,1799,"['Put', 'most', 'expensive', 'hiking', 'boots', 'settle', 'trek', 'globe', 'will', 'follow', 'sparse', 'tracks', 'ancestors', 'found', 'geneticist', 'Spencer', 'Wells', 'other', 'scientists', 'genetic', 'trail', 'human', 'evolution.Science', 'rarely', 'so', 'attractive', 'most', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'off', 'enough', 'sport', 'wardrobe', 'Northface', 'gear', 'travel', 'world', 'What', 'PBS', 'boyish', 'well-groomed', 'scientists', 'expertly', 'styled', 'hair', '50', '%', 'film', 'was', 'watching', 'Spencer', 'walk', 'close-ups', 'mug', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad-looking', 'one.There', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'film', 'interesting', 'see', 'small', 'glimpses', 'cultures', 'native', 'peoples', 'various', 'lands', 'shots', 'Spencers', 'pensive', 'profile', 'visit', 'distant', 'Bushmen', 'Chukti', 'Navajo', 'Frenchmen', 'Kazakhstanis', 'descendents', 'Dravidians', 'Aboriginies.Another', 'criticism', 'film', 'other', 'camera', 'obsession', 'Spencer', 'erroneously', 'only', 'Y-Chromosome', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'such', 'study', 'only', 'passed', 'father', 'son', 'true', 'only', 'men', 'have', 'Y', 'chromosome', 'many', 'anthropologists', 'collaborating', 'geneticists', 'are', 'using', 'mitochondrial', 'DNA', 'passed', 'down', 'mother', 'daughter.There', 'lot', 'filler', 'drawn-out', 'film', 'showcase', 'rarely-seen', 'difficult', 'reach', 'areas', 'world', 'hardships', 'early', 'humans', 'struggled', 'many', 'beautiful', 'lands', ""'ve"", 'traversed', 'collective', 'genetic', 'history', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'branches', 'perhaps', 'may', 'even', 'discover', 'family', 'tree', 'divergent', 'trunk', 'now', 'Spencer', 'drawn', 'family', 'closer', 'film', 'partly', 'designed', 'bring', 'together']",Journey of Man VHS

734179,AOVU5A9GVXHFT,B000086K3E,Margaret Opine,"[7, 62]","Anthropologically speaking,the specie will create a CREATION STORY...it is one of the human(e) universals.  It is a part of the 'homebase' or village experience. Most people want to keep their Creation Story because it was made and envisioned by their own people, identifying their own ethnicity.  Therefore, if your Creation Story is forced upon them then it ends up being your view of the world forced on them when Nature has made the specie so that each population can create its own version of how life begins and how their people came forth to be in life.I'm reminded of the woman, a 'Bushwoman' who was sitting in a classroom in South African and a European woman, a teacher, was teaching them religion, Christian religion.  But the Bushwoman got into trouble with the teacher because she would just look out of the window at the land for hours upon hours.  The teacher asked her why she was not listening and the woman explained that she had her own god and she had her own religion and she was not interested in learning anything about another god or another religion.  She wanted what was her people's for thousands of years and passed down through the ages to her from her ancestors.That story was told to me decades ago by a young student of San ancestry whose family lived in the city and they had escaped from South Africa and came to America to save their lives. Her parents were obth medical doctors. The land was under European colonial rule in South Africa and The People of the Kalahari had been ""captured"" and taken from the desert; their way of life destroyed and they were forbid to go back. When Mandela was released from prison and became president, his government set the People of the Desert free and some of them returned; just some. Some stayed in modern life in the city but thousands and thousands were killed and they died due to diseases as a result of European invasion and colonization.But Spencer Wells inferred (in this video) that their population spanning over 50,000 years in the desert was just dwingling from natural cause and effect, as if their way of life could not sustain further existence. I was looking at the San people wondering what they were thinking. And one of them said, ""Thank you for bringing us the information."" That's the reality now. That's what they have to do; they know what can still happen. So this news from Spencer was met with fear and a yarn. The People would say it if they thought they could, ""I don't need this information. It wasn't long ago that a theorist such as yourself came to us and told us we were subhuman.""Yes. And before that, a theorist developed a thesis and called it: RACES OF PEOPLE..., eventually the idea and ideal was born that some people are inferior to modern people of European decent and thereby sub human.  Spencer said in the program that scientists will come up with ideas...for their careers.Ideas. Some ideas are good, some ideas are bad. And, all science has an error rate and can be 'proven' wrong and changed.The indigenous people: aboriginals and Hopi natives in America have a problem with Spencer's thesis,theory, and science. It didn't mean much to them that Spencer said they were among the oldest strands of human genetics and where they were in the line of development that Spencer describes. They defunct his theory and science and put forth their theory, worldview and belief: All people started with us and from us, kind of thing.  Now which one is true?Bottomline and in an infinite sense: they're both right because both of their stories are Creation Stories, a human universals,which tells what life is, how life got to be, where life came from and what life is all about.  Humans will create their own creation story, which helps to form their own identity and ethnicity,as a People. It's a part of their 'soul'; this is who we are, this is how they know themselves, this is how they know they they came to be: anthropologically speaking.When Spencer got to the European leg of his genetic story and journey he switched allegiance: 'We', to him, became European ancestry but later he did say he was an American citizen. So Spencer identifies his ancestry as European, as ""we"" but he can't understand why a Hopi-Native American wants to identify in the same way and that includes: creation story, history and world view: everything that makes him Hopi...or Australian aboriginal. [It is hard to give up the idea, ideal and vision that the feathers in my hat is far better than the feathers you have stuck in your hair...all humans are likely to adorn themselves with feathers, anthropologically speaking, if they can find them in their environment.]I liked all the pictures of people from different places especially the people who lived in the artic circle but all of them.  They all looked like people with eyes, noses, ears and the rest: what goes on in their minds is different. The Indigenous People know how to live in environments for thousands and years and act as conservationists: other animal life live nearby or a bit away so in modern times we can know what life can shape and form because the humans they live with are conservationists.I found it more to the point that Spencer drove a fancy jeep around and flew in a fancy plane and wore extraordinary clothing to face the elements but the true pioneering, adventuresome humans used their bare feet for thousands and thousands of miles.  They carried a stick, maybe a bow and arrow, and headed out to conquer the world as people.  Just as people; as a legacy to us; they spread the human genome to every environment on earth.  IN WHAT ORDER? We don't know that.  (Most of us don't even care about that.)  We probably will never, ever really know that for sure.  It appears that humans were not engineered to KNOW infinitively but they can have ideas and innovations and create technology.Spencer's big Jeep was parked under the tree; he had his fashions on his body; he has his education and career ahead of him...; The People of the Kalihari don't wear clothes but they still had fashion and body adornments and tiny bows and arrows that they have used for hunting for 50,000 thousand years.Isn't that saying something loud and clear to us--anthropologically speaking?What we know, from academics, is a Western World creation story called 'Evolution' or the Evolutionary Theory and before that 'we'--Americans as Westerners, used a basic creation story called 'Genesis' in the Bible.  (That's why the two of them should be taught in schools together; they enhance the need for people to create a creation story; that behavior is a universal act among humans.)  OUR creation stories are just two stories among many just like the Native Americans said when they said they knew about creation stories.  The Hopi Native American man asked the ""teacher"", ""Why do our sacred stories have to be myths and yours have to be facts?""  Spencer responded with a definite, quiet force, ""Because we are scientists and require proof.  These are your relatives . . ."" he went on with his worldview jamming it into their native reality.  (I FOUND THIS MOST INTERESTING.)  I don't think native people have to be taught that other people are people just like them.  I think they have known that all along.  It has been Western thought in recent centuries that promoted and believed otherwise.)And, why is this a ""Journey of Man""?  That's an erroneous title. This journey and population would not have gone very far if males went off alone without females. We do know that infinitively. The females were giving birth all the way...for Spencer's theory to be credible. So, travelling with pregnant females on foot in all kind of terrains-?-I don't think this documentary was complimentary to Dr. Wells' craft and expertise.  I found it to be a regular market presentation but I never tire of the pictures of people from all over the world and I never tire of the earth's scenery (the little bits and pieces we did see).  I give it 3 stars for that.--Margaret Opine",3,"Anthropologically Speaking, the homo sapien sapiens will create a story...",1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,8026,"['Anthropologically', 'speaking',

The DIFFERENCES are EVERYTHING! Races vary on many intellectual characteristics in regular patterns -- everything from abstract thinking and IQ, to crime and literacy rates. Moreover, the variations are the same in every culture across the globe you find these groups and the differences are stable.Beyond that, the record of science and civilization shows a stark contrast between races -- even when they exist in the same geographical areas together. 99.5% of all scientific advances and great works of art and music are from European people. There are almost no black physicists. (forget about those fake scientific black ""social engineering"" TV characters...). Crime rates can be predicted by racial makeups of all the major cities in the USA at a .8 correlation level. This cannot be due to racism when you consider all the evidence together. Haiti had an infrastructure, etc. and peace until the blacks / mixed killed and /or drove the French out. Now look at them. No science or much literacy there... In every case we find, whether left to themselves or among other races we see the same thing -- so ""prejudice"" is not the cause, it is the effect! We have it ALL backward! So does this DVD.These things are staring us right in the face, yet we want to cling to ideas that we are somehow all the same. That is dangerous to our future. I, for one, want Europeans to survive and not go extinct. They have a different destiny -- they are speciating into a miraculous path among all creatures on the Earth. This video would be great except for that. It is a backward interpretation. Tiny differences mean everything OBVIOUSLY. Over time, they mean the world.Other than that, I do recommend you watch this DVD -- it is very interesting.",3,"What is truly important?

They first looking for the oldest DNA, which is defined as that with the fewest micro mutations. Mutations are cumulative over time, according to the theory, so the population with the fewest modifications is the ""father"" population for all other populations.  They found a tribe in Africa who had DNA from which all other human cultures and migrations have descended.  The video scientific team started their tour there interviewing members of the tribe which still has the oldest DNA.Unsaid, but which logically follows is that the culture of the tribe with the oldest DNA must at some time in their history have had the oldest culture. Their language and culture was the primordial language and culture from which all other human populations have sprung. It's likely that some part of their original language and culture, modified somewhat over time, still survives among their modern day people.  During the interview of tribal members one can't help but notice that their language has many clicking sounds, grunts, and other noises quite unlike most modern languages.I watched this video on PBS on the same day that I watched a documentary about chimpanzees.  In the chimp documentary the scientist had been living with the chimp population for several years trying to learn the chimp language.  He played recordings of several chimp words and phrases that he had been able to learn.  To my astonishment, it sounded very like the clicks and grunt language of the oldest DNA human tribe.  I understand no words of either language, but just listening to the tone, clicks, grunts, noises, tempo of both languages, one after the other, they sounded very similar. Can the oldest human language be linguistically related to that of chimpanzees? It sure sounds similar, and unlike any other language that I'm aware of.  I was amazed.  I had to have the video.The rest of the Journey of Man documents the author's travels following human evolution to India, Australia, China, and finally into Europe and America.

We are all descendants of Africa and, it would seem, all distant cousins of one another, even if that fact, highlighted by this film, does not erase political, social and cultural differences.  If everyone saw this film, perhaps (and only perhaps) there would be less endorsements of war.  Maybe that's a bit too hipeful, since wars are almost always these days presented as humanitarian wars by those who benefit from them.One must marvel at the courage of our ancestors to undertake the great trek out of Africa.

It's very good.However, I have reservations about the certainty with which Dr. Wells approaches his subject, and most particularly the sermonizing at the end about how ""we are all one."" This is Barack Obama territory; Scientists should stick to science, IMHO.Leslie Marmon Silko, in her book, ""The Almanac of The Dead,"" strongly objects to the western scientific view that all Native Americans came from a few hardy souls who crossed the Bering Sea during the last ice age. So, apparently, do the Navajo, who politely told Dr. Wells in the video that their founding myth says they emerged from the earth right there in Arizona. In the video, Dr. Wells blithely dismisses their myth as unscientific, and therefore not worth considering. He offered photos to prove it. To me, this revealing episode smacked of nothing less than the same old white man's imperialism, in its self-evident superiority sweeping away all resistance before it.It may well be that Dr. Wells' and his colleagues' theory about the origin and then spread of mankind is dead on and therefore the case is closed. Based on 3,000 or so blood samples from 2 billion potential donors, and assuming 100% accuracy of the lab results (hope the FBI's lab wasn't involved!). Talk about bold! Nevertheless, I would be willing to bet the ranch that in 50 years this DNA-based theory will have been superceded--or perhaps complemented is a better word--by other discoveries and that Dr. Wells' will not be the accepted scientific wisdom. After all, that's how science works--someone posits a theory, and offers proof, and that theory lasts until someone comes along with another one, and so on.  I would have been happier if in the video (the book may be more nuanced) Dr. Wells had admitted that he was offering a theory only, not the definitive view of human life's origins.One of the least credible portions of the video was the effort of the scientific lady who struggled to explain how northern Europeans gained their appearance (in a mere geologic blink)--as fair skinned and ended up looking like--well, like Dr. Wells.
