578776,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B00005AUJI,Aco,"[2, 2]","This is a fantastic introspective, profound and bold film, that highlights a sensitive and deep aspect of Allen's milieu of  mid-life dis-enchantment.Multiple marriages, psycho-analysis, anguished family dynamics, all of the interpersonal Woody favorites are here, but not given way to laughs, instead to meditation.Gena Rowlands-whose presence as the muse may be a significant reason for the films wonderful idiosyncracies-is Marion, a  50-ish Philosophy professor, who takes a sabbatical to write a book and eavesdrops on therapy sessions next door to her rented studio/workspace. The strife of this other woman propels her into herself, her past, family, marriage, friendships, and the like, ultimately resulting in a clarity essential for this  mid-life crisis to pass, and for her work and passion to continue.Thankfully Woody isn't in this, but Gene Hackman, Ian Holm, Blythe Danner, John Houseman, Mia Farrow-doing her damnedest Allen-film neurotics, Philip Bosco, Sandy Dennis, Harris Yulin, Martha Plimpton and others are, and everyone is terrific. No doubt because the writing is crisp, difficult and honest, and the direction moves from casually circumspect to dream-like and very theatrical.For Woody Allen fans this is a must.

This is a psychological study of a very prim intellectual woman professor.  She begins questioning her own life and it's meaning after eavesdropping on a neighbor, a psychiatrist as he talks to his patients.I actually had no idea Woody Allen directed this when I watched it on Netflix.  I had watched it because I saw that Gene Hackman was in it.  He had a supporting role.  He is a favorite of mine.What I enjoyed was how the lead character gives a voice over of her thoughts and feelings, musing on her life, questioning her past decisions.  Woody Allen loves to make movies that delve into human feelings, particularly the ones that come up when men and women pair off, marry, divorce and take lovers.There was lots of introspection and musings on the meaning of the lead character's life, her marriage and past love affairs.  This is right up my alley.  There are parties and people secretly kissing in the kitchen in this movie.  People are cheating on their spouses.  There is passion, yearning and jealousy shown.All in all, a very satisfying,psychological introspective movie.  Woody Allen carved out this niche in many of the movies he made.

I know that I wouldn't, but Allen has made this confession many times, and when watching some of his more intimate and dramatic works (like `Hannah and Her Sisters' or `Interiors') you can see the influence at work.  For me, `Another Woman' is the clearest example of Woody Allen being influenced by his favorite filmmaker.In `Another Woman' we meet Marion Post, a middle aged woman who happens to be an author married to a divorcee.  Her relationship with her husband Ken is going through some downs at the moment, and distractions have kept her from her work, so she takes up a flat in an apartment complex so as to work for focused on her book.  She happens to occupy the flat next to a psychiatrist's office and because of the vents she can hear the sessions he is having next-door.  She is initially hesitant to listen, but she happens to overhear a young pregnant woman lamenting her relationship and Marion becomes somewhat obsessed.  This trickles into her subconscious as she begins to daydream moments in her past and project moments of her future.  Reliving relationships, indiscretions, lost loves, mistakes and more, Marion slowly starts to lose herself to these fragmented memories.Gena Rowlands is exceptional here, delivering a very quiet yet direct performance that perfectly underscores her character's gradual decline.  Ian Holm is a nice foil to her imbalance, and Gene Hackman is his natural charismatic self (truly one of the VERY best actors of any generation).  Blythe Danner, though, is the star here.  She is in very little of the film and yet she completely steals every frame she graces.It isn't one of my favorite Allen's.  It doesn't feel as complete as I wanted it to, and the dense influence feels almost like a carbon than anything truly `inspired by'.  Still, Allen proves with films like this that he deserves the reputation he has as one of the finest filmmakers ever because he has a range that most would not attribute to him.",4,Yet another reason to admire Woody Allen...,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,2121,"['were', 'watch', 'bulk', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'filmography', 'then', 'were', 'asked', 'who', 'biggest', 'cinematic', 'influence', 'was', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'think', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'know', 'would', ""n't"", 'Allen', 'made', 'confession', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'watching', 'more', 'intimate', 'dramatic', 'works', 'Hannah', 'Sisters', 'Interiors', 'can', 'see', 'influence', 'work', 'Woman', 'clearest', 'example', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'being', 'influenced', 'favorite', 'filmmaker.In', 'Woman', 'meet', 'Marion', 'Post', 'middle', 'aged', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'author', 'married', 'divorcee', 'relationship', 'husband', 'Ken', 'going', 'downs', 'moment', 'distractions', 'have', 'kept', 'work', 'up', 'flat', 'apartment', 'complex', 'so', 'work', 'focused', 'book', 'occupy', 'flat', 'next', 'psychiatrist', 'office', 'vents', 'can', 'hear', 'sessions', 'having', 'next-door', 'initially', 'hesitant', 'listen', 'overhear', 'young', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'lamenting', 'relationship', 'Marion', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'subconscious', 'daydream', 'moments', 'past', 'project', 'moments', 'future', 'Reliving', 'relationships', 'indiscretions', 'lost', 'loves', 'mistakes', 'more', 'Marion', 'slowly', 'lose', 'fragmented', 'memories.Gena', 'Rowlands', 'exceptional', 'here', 'delivering', 'very', 'quiet', 'yet', 'direct', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'character', 'gradual', 'decline', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'nice', 'foil', 'imbalance', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'self', 'truly', 'one', 'VERY', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'though', 'star', 'here', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'yet', 'completely', 'frame', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorite', 'Allen', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'complete', 'wanted', 'dense', 'influence', 'feels', 'almost', 'carbon', 'anything', 'truly', 'inspired', 'Still', 'Allen', 'films', 'reputation', 'one', 'finest', 'filmmakers', 'ever', 'range', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'attribute']",N/A

578781,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005AUJI,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[35, 35]","`Another Woman', written and directed by Woody Allen, is his third and, I believe, last totally serious film, following hard on `September' and several films after his first drama, `Interiors'. Like both earlier dramas, and unlike most of his comedies, the locations are strictly limited to a few interiors and a few nondescript street scenes. The cast may well be the most distinguished ever assembled in an Allen movie, headed up by Gina Rowlands, Gene Hackman, John Houseman, Mia Farrow, and Ian (Bilbo Baggins) Holm. The second rank of actors alone would light up a lesser movie, including Blythe Danner, Betty Buckley, Sandy Dennis, Harris Yulin, and David Ogden Stiers. Some of these well-recognized names and faces such as Blythe Danner and David Ogden Stiers appear in a single scene with but a handful of lines. Even John Houseman has but one scene on camera and about a half dozen lines. It is unusual that while Stiers will appear in several later Allen films, the only actor who has appeared in Allen's earlier films was Farrow.This movie refutes all modest claims on Allen's part to not being an intellectual. His background dialogue and scenes are chocked full of references to high German culture, including the poet Rainer Marie Rilke, the playwright, Bertolt Brecht, the philosopher, Martin Heidigger, and the Viennese painter, Gustav Klimt. These are certainly not gratuitous references, as the principle character Marion, played by Rowlands is the chairman of the Philosophy department at an important college in or near Manhattan who, as the film opens, is beginning on writing a book on philosophy, probably a history or analysis of a major philosopher's work rather than an original work. Marion gets her intellectual heritage from her father, played by both Houseman as an old man and Stiers as a younger man, who is an important professor of history.This intellectual landscape may not be convincing if it were not for Allen's most successful use of one of his most powerful devices of mixing the worlds of reality, imagination, fiction, and dreams. While this conceit is pushed over the edge in `Deconstructing Harry', it is used subtly and to great effect in this movie. The reality is the emotional turmoil of Marion's life based on a marriage which began in illicit liaisons and which is now in crisis based on its own weakness and the strain put upon it by novelist / suitor Larry (played by Gene Hackman), who adds to the reality / fiction theme by stating that he has used Marion as one of the characters in his latest novel.Marion, her husband (Ian Holm) and her best childhood friend Claire (Sandy Dennis) all seem to be raw nerves where the least provocation set them off into arguments over their relations. One can add that most of this is due to the fact that they are seeing an illusory view of their relations, or, are being driven much more by emotion than by reason.Mia Farrow's role, Hope, in this movie is odd. She was scheduled to play the Gena Rowlands part until she became pregnant with her son by Allen, Satchel. Thus, like her role in the comedy `Radio Days', her part is something of a sidebar until near the end of the movie, when her character meets Marion. Appropriate to the name `Hope', contact with Farrow's character is the device that brings Marion out of the emotional turmoil.Like `September', we seem to come upon the characters in the middle of their lives, live through an especially difficult episode in their lives, and leave them just as they barely manage to get their heads above the emotional waters that engulfed them. There is no sense that there is a great renewal that will magically improve their lives from now on.The cinematographer for this film is the great Swedish Ingemar Bergman collaborator, Sven Nykvist. As most of Allen's other lensmen were no slouches in their own right, the change is not immediately apparent. The camera work seems to maintain it's usual very high quality, with a distinct softening in color. Most things seem to be in warm shades of brown and tan, rather than the jarringly prominent reds and greens you see in film color nowadays.Rowlands' performance is every bit as good as her considerable reputation would lead one to expect. Farrow's performance is much like her soft spoken `Rosemary's Baby' and `Purple Rose of Cairo' persona rather than the very strong presence she give for `Broadway Danny Rose' or `Radio Days'.Due mostly to the richly imaginative emotional world of the principle characters, this is a movie one can watch many times over and still get new things from the interactions between the strong personalities brought together here. If you had no feeling for `September' and `Interiors', then don't bother with this film. But, if you really like Allen's movies and have not seen either of these other two dramas, then I suggest you start with `Another Woman' and move on to `September' if you like this one.Unlike virtually every other director I like, such as Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott, Allen seems to show gradual growth and improvement over the years. Some of his later movies are weaker than his best early ones such as `Annie Hall' and `Manhattan', but on average, he gets better with age, and this is one of the best signs of that growth.Highly recommended to Allen fans and film drama fans in general.",5,Woody's best drama.

This one is an all-out copy. Here Allen explores the life of a 50-year-old woman, a philosophy professor, who is unable to express her emotions (i.e. passion). She alienates everyone she's ever known because of it. Through the use of flashbacks and dream sequences (all Bergman techniques - as well as when the woman narrates events and thoughts to herself, and us, along the way) we see how she is a cold creature of reason. But Allen is careless in spots, forgetful, and even goes for the easy way out near the end. The woman is pursued by 2 men, one passionate, the other practical; she, of course, marries the latter. But the passionate man sees something passionate in her after just one kiss. How can he when she obviously isn't - at least we can't see it from what Allen has allowed of her to be developed. And at the end we see her spying her husband in a restaurant with another woman, which becomes the easy explanation for why their sex life has deteriorated.

Of course, if asked to account for their success they will almost invariably say, &quot;Hard work.&quot; Part of the answer no doubt, but far from the whole. To have regrets seems to many people to be faint-hearted and self-pitying; it means looking back from an unhappy present and thinking, &quot;What might have been, if only I had done such and such instead of......Marion. (Gena Rowlands), the protagonist of this film, an outwardly successful and well respected University Professor, has reached the age of fifty without having any self-doubt; she is proud of her achievements and her life-style - or so she has convinced herself. Until one day, in a room she has rented in which to write a book, she hears a woman's voice coming through the ventilator shaft from the psychiatrist's surgery next door. This voice awakens her to her present condition and causes her to question her life. She comes to realise that some decisions she had made in the past, and some of her actions, have brought misery on herself and others. She drove her first husband to suicide by refusing to give him the child he desperately wanted - the child she wishes she now had; she stole her present husband away from his first wife; she alienated by her behaviour both her best friend and her brother; and, worst of all, she refused the offer of love and marriage from a good, warm-hearted, generous man, Larry (Gene Hackman), in order to remain faithful to her cold unresponsive husband Ken (Ian Holm), who she later discovers is unfaithful to her.(&quot;How can you do this?&quot; she says to Larry, &quot;He's your friend.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; replies Larry, &quot;He is my friend and I love him. But he's a prig and he's cold and stuffy.&quot;Can such a person be loved?) She now regrets all of this - but too late. She must now live with the consequences - with the unhappiness she has brought on herself and others. She realises that a successful career and the respect of colleagues is not enough, that her bad choices in life have made her into a sad and disappointed woman.Woody Allen was determined to make a deeply serious film without a hint of humour. And he has succeeded. The whole complex film is quietly depressing and is told in such a way, with flash-backs, dream-sequences, and voice-overs, that you have to keep your wits about you to follow the densely plotted story-line and grasp the meaning of it all - or maybe I'm just stupid. It is quite amazing the detail he manages to pack in to 87 minutes.There are some very dramatic moments; when for instance her husband's ex-wife Kathy (Betty Buckley), invades her anniversary celebrations and denounces her; and when on meeting an old friend Claire (Sandy Dennis), with her current partner, she arouses a storm of anger by repeating the same error that drove her friend away in the first place; so engrossing the attention of the man she is talking to that he becomes oblivious to Claire and everyone else.For people who like films that are serious, philosophic and have a message, films that give you something to think and talk about, this is the film for you.",4,A Spoilt life.,1006732800,"11 26, 2001",2001,3473,"['Many', 'people', 'boast', 'having', 'regrets', 'even', 'sing', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'successful', 'people', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'large', 'slice', 'luck', 'form', 'average', 'intelligence', 'talent', 'presented', 'opportunities', 'parental', 'support', 'encouragement', 'nurturing', 'early', 'experiences', 'have', 'made', 'right', 'decisions', 'early', 'life', 'course', 'asked', 'account', 'success', 'will', 'almost', 'invariably', 'say', 'quot', 'Hard', 'work.', 'quot', 'Part', 'answer', 'doubt', 'far', 'whole', 'have', 'regrets', 'many', 'people', 'be', 'faint-hearted', 'self-pitying', 'looking', 'back', 'unhappy', 'present', 'thinking', 'quot', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'had', 'done', 'such', 'such', 'instead', 'Marion', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'protagonist', 'film', 'outwardly', 'successful', 'well', 'respected', 'University', 'Professor', 'reached', 'age', 'fifty', 'having', 'self-doubt', 'proud', 'achievements', 'life-style', 'so', 'convinced', 'one', 'day', 'room', 'rented', 'write', 'book', 'woman', 'voice', 'coming', 'ventilator', 'shaft', 'psychiatrist', 'surgery', 'next', 'door', 'voice', 'present', 'condition', 'question', 'life', 'realise', 'decisions', 'had', 'made', 'past', 'actions', 'have', 'brought', 'misery', 'others', 'drove', 'first', 'husband', 'suicide', 'refusing', 'give', 'child', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'child', 'now', 'had', 'stole', 'present', 'husband', 'away', 'first', 'wife', 'alienated', 'behaviour', 'best', 'friend', 'brother', 'worst', 'refused', 'offer', 'love', 'marriage', 'good', 'warm-hearted', 'generous', 'man', 'Larry', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'order', 'remain', 'faithful', 'cold', 'unresponsive', 'husband', 'Ken', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'who', 'later', 'discovers', 'unfaithful', 'quot', 'How', 'can', 'do', 'quot', 'Larry', 'quot', 'friend.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yes.', 'quot', 'replies', 'Larry', 'quot', 'friend', 'love', 'prig', 'cold', 'stuffy.', 'quot', 'Can', 'person', 'be', 'loved', 'now', 'too', 'late', 'must', 'now', 'live', 'consequences', 'unhappiness', 'brought', 'others', 'successful', 'career', 'respect', 'colleagues', 'not', 'enough', 'bad', 'choices', 'life', 'have', 'made', 'sad', 'disappointed', 'woman.Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'deeply', 'serious', 'film', 'hint', 'humour', 'succeeded', 'whole', 'complex', 'film', 'quietly', 'depressing', 'told', 'such', 'way', 'flash-backs', 'dream-sequences', 'voice-overs', 'have', 'keep', 'wits', 'follow', 'densely', 'plotted', 'story-line', 'grasp', 'meaning', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'stupid', 'quite', 'amazing', 'detail', 'pack', '87', 'minutes.There', 'are', 'very', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'when', 'instance', 'husband', 'ex-wife', 'Kathy', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'anniversary', 'celebrations', 'when', 'meeting', 'old', 'friend', 'Claire', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'current', 'partner', 'storm', 'anger', 'repeating', 'same', 'error', 'drove', 'friend', 'away', 'first', 'place', 'engrossing', 'attention', 'man', 'talking', 'oblivious', 'Claire', 'everyone', 'else.For', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'are', 'serious', 'philosophic', 'have', 'message', 'films', 'give', 'something', 'think', 'talk', 'film']",N/A

Blanchett's Jasmine may well identify with Marion's (superbly played by Gena Rowlands) self-deceptions, but that's where the similarity ends. Jasmine is superficial, haughty, mono-dimensional, and repellent, while Marion is sophisticated, complex, and alluring in her own right. And while it would be easy to use the M word characterizing Allen's portrayal of Jasmine (misogynist), that's not so easily done with Another Woman. Yes, the film's lead females seem consumed with the question of whether or not they've chosen the right men in their lives. But the story's male leads are given a very unflattering portrayal indeed, while Marion and Hope (Mia Farrow) are contemplative and introspective--presented as the much more emotionally intelligent of the sexes. Renting a Manhattan atelier in order to write (recall the days when simple folk could afford such a thing), Marion overhears the sessions in a psychologist's next-door office. As she listens to Hope questioning the emotional realities in her life, Marion's doubts about her own realities are awakened. Rather than continue with her emotional detachment, she begins the hard task of questioning the inauthenticities in her life. There's her marriage, ties to other people, and her relationship, as a scholar, with intellectualism. As she takes a hard look, there is of course pain. But Marion is brave enough to remain unflinching ... and to reassess. Her journey imparts to us two of the most important of life's lessons. That sadness and pain are part of emotional recovery, because they create a road map to change and wellness. And that the most important intellectual journey a person can take is a journey into his own life and the emotional quality of it; that personal growth is perhaps the most important learning of all.  With it, and despite life's bitters, we can be ""at peace."" Allen gives us wonderful images of a bygone Manhattan, captured in the gold, yellow, and orange hues of the director's signature cinematography, all adorned with the usual sublime selection of standard jazz and classical music (sans swing or big band). One could be forgiven for objecting to the film's overly sad feel, as there really isn't even a single laugh. But as usual, Allen's writing rises well above the gloom, and he gifts us with a pensive and introspective film rich in thought, feeling, imagery, and character.

Haunting and beautiful, this has to be one of my favourite pieces. Written for piano, it was the renowned Debussy who orchestrated the music, adding to its charm. Then it came to me, what film features this wonderful piece of music?...suddenly clear: Another Woman, Directed and Written by Woody Allen. (1988)Out of a slew of Allen's so-called ""serious"" films, this is without a doubt his most well written and directed pieces' without a hint of pretention.Gena Rowlands delivers a superlative performance in the role of Professor Marion Post, in the midst of attempting to finish her book, she hires a flat in Manhatten for the isolation and ""piece & quiet"" to finish it. Little does she know that a psychiatric practice next door will open up memories of her past, her relationships, her marriage and the choices she has made over her life that have altered her destiny.As Marion works on her book, a desperate female voice can be heard filtering through the walls or heating vents. The patient (Mia Farrow) pours out her doubts and failed aspirations, pushing the professor into a reverie of self-analysis: the relationship with her father, played by John Houseman and the man she truly loved but turned away from - Larry Lewis, a stunning performance by Gene Hackman.There is a particular scene where Larry (Hackman) asks, bordering on pleading, for Marion to come back to him. It is raining, of course, and they're standing under a famous bridge in the city while Satie's beautiful music plays in the background. One usually sees Hackman in ""tough"" roles, however, one never sees the sensitive man, a man truly in-love and expressing it with such gut-wrenching honesty. One of the more excellent scenes in the film.This is a film concerning self- reflection, an attempt to be true to one's self, and the pain of having to do so. And once doing so, going back to those you hurt and trying to make some kind of amends; though most times, it's too late.This film is about relationships and the choices we make in life.Wonderfully crafted, beautifully acted and Erik Satie to boot...what more could you want?",5,One of Allen's Better Films,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,2212,"['friends', 'today', 'had', 'Erik', 'Satie', 'CD', 'player', 'Gymnopedie', 'No.3', 'magically', 'filled', 'room', 'Haunting', 'beautiful', 'be', 'one', 'favourite', 'pieces', 'Written', 'piano', 'was', 'renowned', 'Debussy', 'who', 'orchestrated', 'music', 'adding', 'charm', 'Then', 'came', 'what', 'film', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'music', 'suddenly', 'clear', 'Woman', 'Directed', 'Written', 'Woody', 'Allen', '1988', 'slew', 'Allen', 'so-called', 'serious', 'films', 'doubt', 'most', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'pieces', 'hint', 'pretention.Gena', 'Rowlands', 'superlative', 'performance', 'role', 'Professor', 'Marion', 'Post', 'midst', 'attempting', 'finish', 'book', 'flat', 'Manhatten', 'isolation', 'piece', 'quiet', 'finish', 'Little', 'know', 'psychiatric', 'practice', 'next', 'door', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'memories', 'past', 'relationships', 'marriage', 'choices', 'made', 'life', 'have', 'altered', 'destiny.As', 'Marion', 'book', 'desperate', 'female', 'voice', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'filtering', 'walls', 'heating', 'vents', 'patient', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'out', 'doubts', 'failed', 'aspirations', 'pushing', 'professor', 'reverie', 'self-analysis', 'relationship', 'father', 'played', 'John', 'Houseman', 'man', 'truly', 'loved', 'turned', 'away', 'Larry', 'Lewis', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Gene', 'Hackman.There', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Larry', 'Hackman', 'bordering', 'pleading', 'Marion', 'come', 'back', 'raining', 'course', ""'re"", 'standing', 'famous', 'bridge', 'city', 'Satie', 'beautiful', 'music', 'plays', 'background', 'One', 'usually', 'Hackman', 'tough', 'roles', 'however', 'one', 'never', 'sensitive', 'man', 'man', 'truly', 'in-love', 'expressing', 'such', 'gut-wrenching', 'honesty', 'One', 'more', 'excellent', 'scenes', 'film.This', 'film', 'concerning', 'self-', 'reflection', 'attempt', 'be', 'true', 'one', 'self', 'pain', 'having', 'do', 'so', 'once', 'doing', 'so', 'going', 'back', 'hurt', 'trying', 'make', 'kind', 'amends', 'most', 'times', 'too', 'late.This', 'film', 'relationships', 'choices', 'make', 'life.Wonderfully', 'crafted', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'Erik', 'Satie', 'boot', 'what', 'more', 'could', 'want']",N/A

The extras on this DVD are fairly useless, but who cares? It's just fantastic to have a sharp digital copy of this classic film. It's my favorite by Woody Allen (just behind Interiors, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Annie Hall). Of course THE reason to watch this film is the great Gena Rowlands and Sandy Dennis. Yes, folks, it's dark and depressing and sometimes painful to watch. The dialogue could have been tweaked, but my, oh, my when it works it is devastating. The encounter between Rowlands and Dennis (who play estranged friends) at a bar is one of the best written and acted scenes ever committed to celuloid. This was Sandy Dennis' last film and she tears through that moment with such visceral rage. The complexity of this one scene reverberates throughout the film. Rowland's character, Marion, is a by-the-book, emotionally cold college professor. Through wonderfully observed flashbacks (that defy time and logic really)we discover that Marion was once a passionate artist and student and now all that is buried under a thick layer of delusion. Her life and the things happening around her are not what they seem, but she is has deluded herself for so long that it all slips by her. The supporting work here is, of course top notch. Gene Hackman is brilliant as a man who once loved Marion, Ian Holme is letter perfect as her proper husband, Betty Buckley has a one scene cameo that sets the tone early on for much of the story.

578790,A30KQVQI3WI4L7,B00005AUJI,Craig Martin,"[1, 1]","It's no secret that Wood Allen is an enthusiastic fan of Bergman, a director he has attempted to emulate in some of his serious dramas, such as Interiors. Arguably Bergman's most accessible film is Wild Strawberries, which follows an ageing professor on a journey of self-revelation as he travels to Stockholm for a varsity ceremony to be held in his honour. It is a fearless film about lost opportunities and regret, and yet it is not pessimistic. Although Allen denied it in interviews, Another Woman unfolds as though it is the New York director's homage to Wild Strawberries with scenes and sequences that more than resemble the Bergman classic. Allen's film has been described by some as a dour, cold and detached drama, and was not well received on its initial release. During this same period in the 80s, the prolific Allen wrote and directed an offbeat metaphysical comedy called Alice (1990) that contains many of the themes present in Another Woman although wrapped up in comic misadventures and magic realism. Despite its comparative blandness, Alice was well received and may suit some viewers more than this serious and occasionally sombre work. Over time Another Woman has slowly won increasing numbers of fans who have been profoundly moved by its candour.Allen takes his lead character, Marion, on a painful journey through her memories, providing revelations through dreams, chance encounters and flashbacks. Having rented an apartment to work on a new book, Marion discovers she can hear through a ventilation grille the conversations next door between a therapist and his clients. Initially disinterested in eavesdropping, Marion hears the voice of a young woman (Mia Farrow) whose sobs of grief and thoughts about the futility of life grip Marion to such an extent that it sends her on an intense journey of self-discovery in which she confronts misapprehensions about her life and those around her. Marion gradually realizes that her insistent 'life of the mind' has robbed her of more satisfying and fulfilling pursuits such as friendships and family. Gena Rowlands' performance as Marion is an absolute tour de force, and the rest of the cast is equally stunning, especially Sandy Dennis, Blythe Danner, Philip Bosco, Ian Holm, Gene Hackman and John Houseman (in his final role). Allen's dialogue thrusts Rowland's character into some incredibly awkward and confronting situations and the talented actress allows herself to be buffeted by it all, unflinchingly taking us along for the ride towards self-discovery and eventual inner peace.

578791,A2LHFY5QYCRB9X,B00005AUJI,"disco75 ""disco75""","[7, 8]","&quot;Another Woman&quot; vies for my favorite film of all time.  I never tire of watching it, and I have watched many times by now.  It is a fascinating account of a woman's re-assessment of her life after having a series of enlightenments.  In some ways similar to the novel &quot;The Address Book&quot; by Anne Bernays, the film explores in serious ways what Allen's &quot;Alice&quot; looked at in comedy.  &quot;Another Woman,&quot; however, uses excavation of the past and reframing of one's perspective to accomplish the change.  As the character wonders at the conclusion of the film, &quot;is a memory something you have, or something you've lost?&quot;While the themes may be familiar in Allen's work, his inspiration for this project was, of course, Bergman's &quot;Wild Strawberries.&quot;  The context for Allen's project is the upper class New York setting of multiple marriages, shrink's offices, classy restaurants, and art.  Klimt's &quot;Hope,&quot;  Satie's gymnopedie, and German philosophy provide rich symbols for the psychology of Gena Rowland's character.Disciplined and somewhat constricted, she has accomplished a good deal and made true on her father's driving hopes for her achievements.  However strong she is, the depth of her feelings is lacking.  The professor fails to see how others feel about her, aside from their obvious respect for her accomplishments and perhaps intimidation by her force of will.  What does not fit into her plan for her life, she overcomes by ignoring.  This repression leaves her ripe for upheaval following her 50th birthday.A series of rich memories are evoked when her thoughts are jarred out of complacency by overheard fragments of a psychotherapist's work next door to her writing apartment.  Moved by the idea of making a different sense of one's past in therapy, the professor begins experiencing small, revealing encounters with the signficant people in her life.  She begins to see that the self concept she harbored for so long is not congruent with the image others hold of her.  Her repression begins to crumble.An interesting question is whether the Mia Farrow character, patient of the therapist, actually exists or is a symbol of the professor's denied, unfulfilled Hopes.  It seems to be through encounters with the patient that the professor comes into contact with players from her past.  Perhaps this phantom is her repressed ego letting her know that the time has come for opening her eyes to more of the truth and for change to be permitted.In any event, the script is layered and absorbing, Allen's construction of the New York world is seamless, and the acting is pitch perfect.  Rowlands in particular is compelling.  The film creates a spell, an encapsulated world that commands attention until the very end.  Interestingly, this is one of Allen's films that seems to polarize viewers.  For every ecstatic opinion about &quot;Another Woman&quot; there is a scathing rejection.  For my part, the film is part of my &quot;Desert Island&quot; must-haves.

Another reviewer compared it with Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"". There, narration is used to describe dream sequences, but the narration does not substitute for action or interaction as it does for ""Another Woman"" It IS difficult to reveal a character's inner thoughts and feelings without using narration, but here it's excessive. Even the rather clever (though somewhat dubious) mechanism of hearing the neighbor's psychiatric sessions is a form of narration.In the end, the story amounts to a person discovering she was more emotionally repressed and that the costs were worse than she had realized. Afterward, the scene back in her apartment becomes more brightly lit, and she is once again able to write freely. Frankly, I find this pseudo-cathartic release unconvincing.In summation, the plot enters no new territory, and reveals nothing startling to hold our interest, and spends too much time telling, and not enough showing.

578795,A2BPDFR58H9575,B00005AUJI,Galina,"[1, 1]","In Woody Allen's ""Another Woman"", Marion (Gena Rowlands) is the head of a university department of philosophy and also a member of several important committees. She is an expert in Art, music, and an amateur painter. She is in a comfortable and successful marriage to a physician (Ian Holmes), and has a close and friendly relationship with her husband's teenage daughter from an earlier marriage (Martha Plimpton). Marion is writing a book and decides to rents an office in a downtown building. When in the office, she inadvertently overhears a woman (Mia Farrow) in a session with her psychoanalyst and begins to look back at her own life, identity, relationships, and purpose.I watched ""Another Woman"" for the first time last night and I am totally engrossed by it. I love everything about it. Actually, it is the first Allen's strict drama that I love so much. It will go very high on my Woody's favorites list. The film is so Woodyesque even if it doesn't have any laughs - it is still his style, his Manhattan, his favorite music, his long takes, his intellect, his sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses. I think it is one of Allen's most profound and warmest films. Yes, warmest, because Marion looks at the first 50 years of her life in a true and painful light, but she also would learn that there is hope, that anything can be changed and life could be started over even at 50. She will reevaluate her life and her relationships with her husband, father, brother, step-daughter, and friends. She may not find the answers for all the questions but she certainly learns a lot about herself. I've seen John Cassavetes' ""A Woman Under the Influence"" (1974) and I know how great the actress Gena Rowlands is but I was amazed by her performance in ""Another Woman"". Allen gave her wonderful material to work with and she was superb - strong, reserved, brilliant woman, incredibly attractive at her 50. It is a dream role for an intelligent middle-aged actress but sadly, Hollywood does not provide them very often.A lot has been said about Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" (I'd add ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Face to Face"") influence to ""Another Woman"" but it is not a remake. We all at some point of our lives ""lose the way we traveled by and enter a dark forest."" The artists by the power of their talents capture the moments of search for meaning and put them on the canvas, on the paper or on screen. Even if they meditate on the same theme, each artist uses his unique tools, and brings his unique vision and talent.In ""Another Woman"" Allen created an excellent character study which is on par with his best and more famous films. Wonderful Rowlands is surrounded by the first class supporting players including Ian Holms, Blythe Danner, Sandy Dennis, and Gene Hackman. Allen's use of music is touching and delicate as in all his movies. ""Another Woman"" is one of the best unfairly forgotten films and it deserves to be rediscovered, respected, and admired. It is certainly, the best of Allen's pure drama films.",5,"""I wondered if a memory is something you have or something you've lost.""",1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,3075,"['Woody', 'Allen', 'Woman', 'Marion', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'head', 'university', 'department', 'philosophy', 'also', 'member', 'several', 'important', 'committees', 'expert', 'Art', 'music', 'amateur', 'painter', 'comfortable', 'successful', 'marriage', 'physician', 'Ian', 'Holmes', 'close', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'husband', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'earlier', 'marriage', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'Marion', 'writing', 'book', 'rents', 'office', 'downtown', 'building', 'When', 'office', 'inadvertently', 'woman', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'session', 'psychoanalyst', 'look', 'back', 'own', 'life', 'identity', 'relationships', 'purpose.I', 'watched', 'Woman', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'am', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'love', 'everything', 'Actually', 'first', 'Allen', 'strict', 'drama', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'will', 'go', 'very', 'high', 'Woody', 'favorites', 'list', 'film', 'so', 'Woodyesque', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'laughs', 'still', 'style', 'Manhattan', 'favorite', 'music', 'long', 'intellect', 'sincere', 'intelligent', 'emotional', 'contemplations', 'life', 'disappointment', 'regrets', 'losses', 'think', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'profound', 'warmest', 'films', 'Yes', 'warmest', 'Marion', 'first', '50', 'years', 'life', 'true', 'painful', 'light', 'also', 'would', 'learn', 'hope', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'changed', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'started', 'even', '50', 'will', 'reevaluate', 'life', 'relationships', 'husband', 'father', 'brother', 'step-daughter', 'friends', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'answers', 'questions', 'certainly', 'lot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'John', 'Cassavetes', 'A', 'Woman', 'Influence', '1974', 'know', 'how', 'great', 'actress', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'was', 'amazed', 'performance', 'Woman', 'Allen', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'material', 'work', 'was', 'superb', 'strong', 'reserved', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'incredibly', 'attractive', '50', 'dream', 'role', 'intelligent', 'middle-aged', 'actress', 'sadly', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'provide', 'very', 'often.A', 'lot', 'been', 'said', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', ""'d"", 'add', 'Cries', 'Whispers', 'Face', 'Face', 'influence', 'Woman', 'not', 'remake', 'point', 'lives', 'lose', 'way', 'traveled', 'enter', 'dark', 'forest', 'artists', 'power', 'talents', 'capture', 'moments', 'search', 'meaning', 'put', 'canvas', 'paper', 'screen', 'Even', 'meditate', 'same', 'theme', 'artist', 'unique', 'tools', 'unique', 'vision', 'talent.In', 'Woman', 'Allen', 'created', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'par', 'best', 'more', 'famous', 'films', 'Wonderful', 'Rowlands', 'surrounded', 'first', 'class', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Ian', 'Holms', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Allen', 'use', 'music', 'touching', 'delicate', 'movies', 'Woman', 'one', 'best', 'unfairly', 'forgotten', 'films', 'be', 'rediscovered', 'respected', 'admired', 'certainly', 'best', 'Allen', 'pure', 'drama', 'films']",N/A

Every actor in it (and it's quite a line-up of pros) was outstanding.  Fortunately none of the reviews (that I read) gave away the ending or much of the plot.  About the reviews.  Houseman had more than one scene and many more than a dozen lines.  The camera work was good enough (I don't know enough about movies to tell good from bad) I suppose, I found it a little labored, and was stunned by the triteness of seeing shots of the women's feet when one was hurrying to follow the other.  Unlike another review, I did feel that a life-changing event had occurred and that things were going to be decidedly different, better for both the protagonist and others.  Unlike the heroine, I'm turning 60, not 50, and I do not see 50 as old.  But as the heroine said, 30, 40, 50 - she was told to expect to be overwhelmed by each of these birthdays and ""traumatized"" by turning 50.  The woman said that despite these warnings, she was unphased by each birthday until she hit 50, and that that did traumatize her.  I don't remember how I felt turning 50, but not much I don't think, nor much at any of the other ages.  But sigh turning 60 has me down for the count.  And I'm just taking up the violin.  A thing I tried doing for a few months in college many years ago, but gave up. Now that it's ""too late"" to be anything more than a hobby, I feel greatly motivated.  Enough about that.  I doubt it will make you want to watch the picture.  I recommend this movie without reservations.  Allen's protagonist split an infinitive in one of the early scenes.

All of her friends wear Ralph Lauren: everyone in beige, khaki green and gray in corduroy, wool and particularly tweed.One day while Marion is working on her book she overhears through the heating duct, a psychiatrist and his patient (Mia Farrow) during a particularly emotional session.Marion is intrigued with what she is hearing. There is something about how and what this woman is saying that strikes a cord in her heart. Marion avidly listens day after day. These sessions force Marion to examine her past and her present life, resulting in a Catharsis that forces Marion to take another life path.There are many shifts in time in ""Another Woman,"" with Marion acting as a kind of Christmas past, present and future in the re-enactingment of her life and loves.Gena Rowlands, playing against type here, is a revelation as Marion: she is prim and proper, draped in tweeds and turtlenecks, ""always standing above, judging everyone"" as one character (Martha Plimpton) describes her.""Another Woman"" is from the middle period of Woody Allen's career, when he felt it necessary to explore deadly serious subjects, as in his ""Interiors.""

578806,AA0Y6M1TKHNHN,B00005AUJI,Michael Walter,"[2, 2]","The central character in Another Woman is Marion Post. She is direct, precise, and deliberate. These qualities have given Marion, at midlife, money, friends, accomplishments, a respected husband, and a prestigious job. One of her guiding principles is, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" There is, on its surface, nothing broken in Marion's life, and, thus, nothing to fix.Marion, a writer and philosophy professor, has rented an apartment so that she can focus on writing her new book. There is a vent in the apartment through which she can overhear conversations coming from the room next to hers, a psychiatrist's office. She blocks the vent up. She is not interested in juicy details. One afternoon, she falls asleep, and when she wakes up, the pillow that she has used to block the vent has fallen away. She hears the voice of one of the psychiatrist's patients, a woman. The tone-the ""anguish""-of the woman's voice makes an impression on Marion. As a result of this overheard conversation, Marion makes changes in her own life. These changes call for her strengths.The film is magnificent. Much of this is because of Gena Rowlands' presence and performance. Her presence anchors us. Rowlands conveys poise, softness, strength, intensity, and knowledge. The development of Marion's character comes to us, sometimes, as a series of surprises. Rowlands' presence makes these developments seem fluid, organic; it makes nuances of Marion's character accessible. Because of Rowlands, Marion's ability to synthesize intellect and emotion is involving and believable. Marion's synthesis of intellect and emotion is, of course, exactly what the film is about. Rowlands is integral to the film: she gets the essence of the character right, and lifts the film as a whole. Another actress in the role is almost unimaginable.The dream sequence is another highlight. The dream creates harsh, troubling revelations and ways for Marion to understand others and herself. It reveals her capacity to hear the unsaid, to perceive motives behind actions, to accurately assess relationships. Much of Marion's life is circumscribed, but the dream is kaleidoscopic-meaning that Marion's inner life may be more complicated than is convenient. The dream works by cumulative effect, in Marion and on us. Instead of overhearing a conversation in an office next door, Marion sustains the disclosures of her own mind. The overheard conversation and Marion's dream have complementary positive effects. The dream is told clearly, with thoughtful editing and without odd images. This clarity allows for complexity and significance.There are two other factors that I find interesting. First, the film repeatedly uses hallway images. Hallways allow movement from one room to another, so, symbolically, they might reference Marion's willingness to change. They restrict movement to backward-forward motion, so they might also function as symbols of Marion's past, present, and future. Just as hallways surround one, the story's events surround Marion. Second, the film's golden light creates a calm, reflective state in us. It is warm; it invites us. Illuminating some details, blurring others, it creates peaceful synchronicity between itself and its objects. Allen, giving Marion golden-lit environments to inhabit, denotes the beneficial, achievable order in her awkward circumstances. The emblematic light transcends, just as Marion might, depending on what decisions she makes. The golden light minimizes distinctions; Marion, too, might find an equally exquisite balance.Indeed, everything in the film is balanced. Its technical aspects are in harmony with its narrative. It has an intense and soothing quality. It does not slight the past, simplifying inherently difficult decisions. It does not moralize about mistakes.

Through the vent, however, she can overhear conversations from the psychiatrist's office next door--particularly those between the psychiatrist and a distraught woman patient whose life apparently is in crisis. At first Marion tries to shut out the voices, but soon she finds herself listening compulsively, as the other woman's story brings back unwelcome yet compelling memories from her own life. This is the basic story of Woody Allen's ""Another Woman,"" one of his most serious films and--along with ""Interiors""--his most obvious tribute to Ingmar Bergman. ""Another Woman"" is a fascinating variation on Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries""--Marion, like the Victor Sjostrom character in the Bergman film, is a high-minded intellectual who comes to the realization that she has lived far too much in her own mind, in the process cutting off other people and avoiding life. That realization comes to her through memories, dreams, and chance encounters with various people--all unsettling and disturbing, but in the end salutary. At one point Marion quotes Rilke's sonnet ""Archaic Torso of Apollo"": ""There is no place that does not see you. You must change your life."" That is the epigraph for the entire film, and if Allen sometimes has his characters state their intentions too baldly, nevertheless he has crafted a delicate, elegant and hypnotic chamber drama. Above all, Gena Rowlands as Marion gives what I consider the best performance in any Allen film, indeed one of the best performances ever by any film actress. To see Rowlands' performance is to see the range of dramatic possibilities in a human face, and ""Another Woman"" is a tribute to both Rowlands' genius as an actor and to Allen's genius as a director of actors. ""Another Woman"" contains perhaps the finest cast ever assembled for an Allen film--besides Rowlands' brilliant star turn, there are excellent supporting performances by a cornucopia of superb players including Mia Farrow (as the woman in the psychiatrist's office), Gene Hackman, Sandy Dennis, Ian Holm, John Houseman, Harris Yulin, Blythe Danner, Philip Bosco, Betty Buckley and David Ogden Stiers.

578811,A2X25C107CSLOR,B00005AUJI,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[9, 14]","Students of the films of Ingmar Bergman can easily list the similarities between this Woody Allen film and Bergman's Wild Strawberries. In fact there exist so many that I could easily use the 1000 words in listing them, but that would leave no room to draw attention to the things that make this film diverting. Of course Allen's sensibility is very different from Bergman's. Part of what makes Wild Strawberries so memorable are Bergman's gothic dreams - who can forget the driver-less carriage containing a coffin that crashes onto a road in front of Victor Sjostrom, the mask-faced man he meets, the witnessing of his wife's ravishment by another man, the medical exam he fails, or the scenes with Bibi Andersson at his childhood summer house ? Allen wisely doesn't attempt to copy Bergman in this way. Instead he has the overheard voice from a psychiatrist's office as the catalyst for Gena Rowlands (in the Sjostrom role) to re-assess the life she thinks has been one of missed opportunities. By making the character female, Allen can add the choice of having children at the cost of a career to the scale, and the fact that Mia Farrow as the overheard voice is clearly pregnant and carrying Allen's child can be no coincidence. The best scenes are those which involve the expression of emotion, particularly when it is seemingly embarassing, which repeats the theme of Allen's Interiors, with emotionalism associated with being Jewish and unemotionalism Gentile. (You can guess which side childbirth falls on). In memory Betty Buckley as the first wife of Ian Holm, interrupts a party, Sandy Dennis as a childhood friend becomes jealous of the attention her own husband gives &quot;another woman&quot;, and poor Holm can hardly hope when Rowlands confronts him with accusations. When Allen presents characters who are meant to be &quot;cerebral&quot; his dialogue takes on a doughy quality, such as &quot;I seduced you, intellectually&quot;, &quot;There are times when even a historian shouldn't look at the past&quot;, and &quot;I must have seemed very bland to him after he met you&quot;. Lines like the historian one are camp/howlers, so it's a relief when other lines are intended to be funny, like Holm's ineffectual &quot;I accept your condemnation&quot;, and Dennis' &quot;We didn't just drift apart. I withdrew&quot;. It's also refreshing when Allen uses physical action in his confrontations -  Buckley pushing Holm away and Rowlands grappling with Philip Bosco as her first husband. Allen also continues his expressionist use of staging, with actors walking out of frame while still talking, Rowlands following Farrow walking in the street edited to the rhythm of their footsteps, and the screen half split by a wall when Rowlands is in a restaurant. He also scores a laugh after Buckley's scene with the cut to Make Believe played on the piano in a hyper version, and the way the dialogue of Jacques Levy as Dennis' husband brackets Dennis' anger - &quot;You should never drink&quot; . One of the weaknesses in Wild Strawberries was that, because Sjostrom was so likeable, it was hard to believe the accusations made against him, so Rowland's stiffness here works for her character, without hiding the actors skill. The way she is dressed and her hairstyles actually recall Ingrid Thulin from the Bergman film, though in her Movie Love collection of reviews Pauline Kael notes that the braided knot on the back of her head &quot;looks as if it had been cast in bronze&quot;. The fall colour scheme and the use of Kurt Weill's Bilbao Song define the mood of the piece, however the use of Satie's Gymnopedie No. 3 over a memory of Rowlands with Gene Hackman is more effective, with it's suggestion of sadness and longing.",4,another Bergman homage,989280000,"05 8, 2001",2001,3736,"['Students', 'films', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'can', 'easily', 'list', 'similarities', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'fact', 'exist', 'so', 'many', 'could', 'easily', 'use', '1000', 'words', 'listing', 'would', 'leave', 'room', 'draw', 'attention', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'diverting', 'course', 'Allen', 'sensibility', 'very', 'different', 'Bergman', 'Part', 'what', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'so', 'memorable', 'are', 'Bergman', 'gothic', 'dreams', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'driver-less', 'carriage', 'containing', 'coffin', 'road', 'front', 'Victor', 'Sjostrom', 'mask-faced', 'man', 'witnessing', 'wife', 'ravishment', 'man', 'medical', 'exam', 'scenes', 'Bibi', 'Andersson', 'childhood', 'summer', 'house', 'Allen', 'wisely', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'copy', 'Bergman', 'way', 'Instead', 'overheard', 'voice', 'psychiatrist', 'office', 'catalyst', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Sjostrom', 'role', 're-assess', 'life', 'been', 'one', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'making', 'character', 'female', 'Allen', 'can', 'add', 'choice', 'having', 'children', 'cost', 'career', 'scale', 'fact', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'overheard', 'voice', 'clearly', 'pregnant', 'carrying', 'Allen', 'child', 'can', 'be', 'coincidence', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'involve', 'expression', 'emotion', 'particularly', 'when', 'seemingly', 'embarassing', 'theme', 'Allen', 'Interiors', 'emotionalism', 'associated', 'being', 'Jewish', 'unemotionalism', 'Gentile', 'can', 'guess', 'side', 'childbirth', 'memory', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'first', 'wife', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'party', 'Sandy', 'Dennis', 'childhood', 'friend', 'jealous', 'attention', 'own', 'husband', 'quot', 'woman', 'quot', 'poor', 'Holm', 'can', 'hardly', 'hope', 'when', 'Rowlands', 'accusations', 'When', 'Allen', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'quot', 'cerebral', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'doughy', 'quality', 'such', 'seduced', 'intellectually', 'quot', 'quot', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'historian', 'should', ""n't"", 'look', 'past', 'quot', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'very', 'bland', 'met', 'quot', 'Lines', 'historian', 'one', 'are', 'camp/howlers', 'relief', 'when', 'other', 'lines', 'are', 'intended', 'be', 'funny', 'Holm', 'ineffectual', 'quot', 'accept', 'condemnation', 'quot', 'Dennis', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'drift', 'apart', 'withdrew', 'quot', 'also', 'refreshing', 'when', 'Allen', 'physical', 'action', 'confrontations', 'Buckley', 'pushing', 'Holm', 'away', 'grappling', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'first', 'husband', 'Allen', 'also', 'expressionist', 'use', 'staging', 'actors', 'walking', 'frame', 'still', 'talking', 'Rowlands', 'following', 'Farrow', 'walking', 'street', 'edited', 'rhythm', 'footsteps', 'screen', 'half', 'split', 'wall', 'when', 'Rowlands', 'restaurant', 'also', 'laugh', 'Buckley', 'scene', 'cut', 'Make', 'Believe', 'played', 'piano', 'hyper', 'version', 'way', 'dialogue', 'Jacques', 'Levy', 'Dennis', 'husband', 'brackets', 'Dennis', 'anger', 'quot', 'should', 'never', 'drink', 'quot', 'One', 'weaknesses', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'was', 'Sjostrom', 'was', 'so', 'likeable', 'was', 'hard', 'believe', 'accusations', 'made', 'so', 'Rowland', 'stiffness', 'here', 'character', 'hiding', 'actors', 'skill', 'way', 'dressed', 'hairstyles', 'actually', 'recall', 'Ingrid', 'Thulin', 'Bergman', 'film', 'though', 'Movie', 'Love', 'collection', 'reviews', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'braided', 'knot', 'back', 'head', 'quot', 'had', 'been', 'cast', 'bronze', 'quot', 'fall', 'colour', 'scheme', 'use', 'Kurt', 'Weill', 'Bilbao', 'Song', 'define', 'mood', 'piece', 'however', 'use', 'Satie', 'Gymnopedie', 'No', '3', 'memory', 'Rowlands', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'more', 'effective', 'suggestion', 'sadness', 'longing']",N/A

578813,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005AUJI,Sebastian Fernandez,"[16, 17]","There are several aspects that make this movie excellent, including the intelligent dialogues, the psychological aspects of the narration and the fact that a complex story can be presented in only eighty minutes. These are some of the reasons why Woody Allen is considered by many to be one of the most gifted directors ever. Of course, those that usually do not like Allen's style will not find solace in this movie, but the rest of you will probably appreciate the quality of this production.Marion Post (Rowland) is a philosophy professor who is taking a leave of absence to write a book and who has rented an apartment to be able to do this peacefully and without any interruptions. The apartment is next door to the office of a psychiatrist and she realizes that she can hear the sessions through the air vents. At first she covers the vents to prevent invading the patients' privacy, but later she hears the sad voice of a woman (Mia Farrow) after one of the cushions covering the vent moves from its place. From that moment on she is hooked and cannot help herself, so she continues eavesdropping into the sessions of the mysterious woman.Marion starts identifying herself with some of the accounts of this woman and understands that she may actually be dissatisfied with her life too, mainly with her choice of husband and career. From that point forward the psychological aspects of the story become the central focus around which the action revolves. The dreams, memories and reality of Marion's life interact with each other, making us doubt at times if certain events are really happening or not. The final result is an interesting look at the psyche of the main character and her relationship with others.As it is usual in Allen's movies, there are coincidences galore with chance encounters that reunite old friends and current acquaintances, but the story remains believable all the time. One of the most notable aspects of the film is the outstanding cast, with Rowland playing her role to perfection and other renowned actors and actresses adding their fair share. The performance of Gene Hackman is praiseworthy, and even though his participation is fairly brief, he leaves a lasting impression.

The problem with Another Woman is that the main character, Marion, is a shallow and boring person.  Her life is so dull that she has to listen in on sessions with a psychoanalyst and his analysands.  In the process, she learns that she is not as superior as she thinks she is, and has hurt people and pushed those that love her away.  In the process she learns that she is lonely and has been depressed for a while.  The plot is overly simple and the script at times is forced and trite.  The acting is often corny and pretentious.  Gene Hackman, a brilliant actor, does co-star in this movie but only has brief and often irrelevant scenes of dialog.I do not suggest you purchase or even rent this movie unless you want to be bored silly.  This movie is not in the same caliber as Interiors, which was brilliant and well acted.  In Interiors I actually cared about the characters and felt sorry for them and believed that they were having realistic life difficulties.  In Another woman I had almost no interest or pity for the selfish and mildly narcissistic main character.  The supporting cast often displayed selfish and childish behaviors too, therefore cheapening the already tedius and banal plot.  This is not typical of the usual highly intellectual Woody Allen movie, instead it is forced, rushed, and very simple.  I do not suggest you watch it.",2,Cold characters and bland plot make for a bad movie.,1166313600,"12 17, 2006",2006,1491,"['gave', 'movie', 'extra', 'pity', 'star', 'only', 'adore', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'work', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'recieved', 'only', 'one', 'star', 'problem', 'Woman', 'main', 'character', 'Marion', 'shallow', 'boring', 'person', 'life', 'so', 'dull', 'listen', 'sessions', 'psychoanalyst', 'analysands', 'process', 'not', 'as', 'superior', 'hurt', 'people', 'pushed', 'love', 'away', 'process', 'lonely', 'been', 'depressed', 'while', 'plot', 'overly', 'simple', 'script', 'times', 'forced', 'trite', 'acting', 'often', 'corny', 'pretentious', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'co-star', 'movie', 'only', 'brief', 'often', 'irrelevant', 'scenes', 'dialog.I', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'purchase', 'even', 'rent', 'movie', 'want', 'be', 'bored', 'silly', 'movie', 'not', 'same', 'caliber', 'Interiors', 'was', 'brilliant', 'well', 'acted', 'Interiors', 'actually', 'cared', 'characters', 'felt', 'sorry', 'believed', 'were', 'having', 'realistic', 'life', 'difficulties', 'woman', 'had', 'almost', 'interest', 'pity', 'selfish', 'mildly', 'narcissistic', 'main', 'character', 'supporting', 'cast', 'often', 'displayed', 'selfish', 'childish', 'behaviors', 'too', 'therefore', 'cheapening', 'already', 'tedius', 'banal', 'plot', 'not', 'typical', 'usual', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'instead', 'forced', 'rushed', 'very', 'simple', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'watch']",N/A

This movie is amazing in the simplicity of the characters and in the complexity of the characters. The flashbacks are amazing in how Mr. Allen will use the present actor placed in a long ago memory and how he uses a younger actor in the long ago recollection. Your brain easily accepts both. The story makes you wish that what is being churned out by  Hollywood today could be told similarly. This is a really good movie.,5,Another Wonderful Woman's Story Written by Woody Allen,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",2013,520,"['movie', 'extremely', 'long', 'passionate', 'comments', 'reviewers', 'will', 'keep', 'mine', 'simple', 'movie', 'amazing', 'simplicity', 'characters', 'complexity', 'characters', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'amazing', 'how', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'will', 'use', 'present', 'actor', 'placed', 'long', 'ago', 'memory', 'how', 'younger', 'actor', 'long', 'ago', 'recollection', 'brain', 'easily', 'story', 'wish', 'what', 'being', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'similarly', 'really', 'good', 'movie']",N/A
