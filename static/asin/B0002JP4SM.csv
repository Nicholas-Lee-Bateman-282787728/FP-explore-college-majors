838136,A10ODC971MDHV8,B0002JP4SM,John Farr,"[9, 9]","A captivating entry in the ""American Experience"" PBS series, ""Adams"" vividly brings to life the biographical details and working methods of this groundbreaking 20th-century photographer. An accomplished concert pianist, Adams gave up this path to pursue his vision of nature's beauty by illuminating Yosemite's Kings Canyon as it had never been seen before. With great sensitivity to Adams's process, specifically how he achieved the distinctive look of his photos, Burns handles his subject with understated reverence, profiling the artist-as-environmentalist. Adams changed forever the way we view wilderness, and this beautiful film tells us why--and why he and his legacy still matter.",5,Ansel Adams,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,689,"['captivating', 'entry', 'American', 'Experience', 'PBS', 'series', 'Adams', 'vividly', 'life', 'biographical', 'details', 'working', 'methods', 'groundbreaking', '20th-century', 'photographer', 'accomplished', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Adams', 'gave', 'up', 'path', 'pursue', 'vision', 'nature', 'beauty', 'illuminating', 'Yosemite', 'Kings', 'Canyon', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'great', 'sensitivity', 'Adams', 'process', 'specifically', 'how', 'achieved', 'distinctive', 'look', 'photos', 'Burns', 'subject', 'understated', 'reverence', 'profiling', 'artist-as-environmentalist', 'Adams', 'changed', 'forever', 'way', 'view', 'wilderness', 'beautiful', 'film', 'tells', 'why', 'why', 'legacy', 'still', 'matter']",N/A

It's inspirational both visually and mentally; a very humanistic look into who Ansel Adams was as a child, a man, a husband, pianist, and photographer. This is something that should be watched at least once, by photography students and photographers as a whole. I'm sure it won't be viewed just once. The wonderful accounts, spectacular cinematography, and of course, a look at some of the Grand Master's classic photographs round out this finely crafted documentary worthy of Ansel Adams.",5,Another Ric Burns classic,1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,531,"['documentary', 'typical', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'inspirational', 'visually', 'mentally', 'very', 'humanistic', 'look', 'who', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'was', 'child', 'man', 'husband', 'pianist', 'photographer', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'least', 'once', 'photography', 'students', 'photographers', 'whole', ""'m"", 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'viewed', 'just', 'once', 'wonderful', 'accounts', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'course', 'look', 'Grand', 'Master', 'classic', 'photographs', 'round', 'finely', 'crafted', 'documentary', 'worthy', 'Ansel', 'Adams']",N/A

838139,AJZDZ3KG9N9NB,B0002JP4SM,watchit,"[9, 11]","Boy am I out of step when I compare my reaction to most of the others in this thread. You see, I am reviewing the movie, not Ansel Adams, and I find Ric Burns' film cold and unmoving once one removes oneself from the power of Adams' work. Burns benefits from the Kuleshov experiment in which the intercutting of still images produces an effect unrelated to the individual shots themselves. In this case, Burns' marvelous writing, interviewing, and interview subjects go on and on about Adams and his work but there is precious little specific discussion of the works that we're seeing at the time. A few -- the moon over graveyard, moon over Half Dome -- are addressed, and that's a strength, but minimal explanation is given to Adams' technique of burning/dodging prints, his filters, his camera, and even the tonal range of B&W film. If this had been about Rembrandt we would have had a thorough explanation of his brush strokes, pigments, and process. But somehow Adams' work takes place in the realm of magic. I don't have that much of a problem with panning and scanning the photos, except that the movement seldom ties in with the narration, it's just to keep the screen alive. David Ogden Stiers' narration is delivered with boring regularity, dropping the ends of sentences as if being merely perfunctory, until he becomes annoying. Worse, the breathtaking (and undoubtedly expensive) color helicopter shots over Adams' beloved Yosemite have nothing, of course, to do with Adams (color, moving, aerial) and serve to undercut the master's work at every bank. In the end, this documentary says everything about the man but explains little of how he achieved his results.",2,"Looks 10, Dance 2",1309564800,"07 2, 2011",2011,1676,"['Boy', 'am', 'step', 'when', 'compare', 'reaction', 'most', 'others', 'thread', 'see', 'am', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'not', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'find', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'film', 'cold', 'unmoving', 'once', 'one', 'power', 'Adams', 'work', 'Burns', 'benefits', 'Kuleshov', 'experiment', 'intercutting', 'still', 'images', 'effect', 'unrelated', 'individual', 'shots', 'case', 'Burns', 'marvelous', 'writing', 'interviewing', 'interview', 'subjects', 'go', 'Adams', 'work', 'precious', 'little', 'specific', 'discussion', 'works', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'time', 'few', 'moon', 'graveyard', 'moon', 'Half', 'Dome', 'are', 'addressed', 'strength', 'minimal', 'explanation', 'given', 'Adams', 'technique', 'burning/dodging', 'prints', 'filters', 'camera', 'even', 'tonal', 'range', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'about', 'Rembrandt', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'thorough', 'explanation', 'brush', 'strokes', 'pigments', 'process', 'somehow', 'Adams', 'work', 'place', 'realm', 'magic', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'problem', 'panning', 'scanning', 'photos', 'movement', 'seldom', 'ties', 'narration', 'just', 'keep', 'screen', 'alive', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'narration', 'delivered', 'boring', 'regularity', 'dropping', 'ends', 'sentences', 'being', 'merely', 'perfunctory', 'annoying', 'Worse', 'breathtaking', 'undoubtedly', 'expensive', 'color', 'helicopter', 'shots', 'Adams', 'beloved', 'Yosemite', 'have', 'nothing', 'course', 'do', 'Adams', 'color', 'moving', 'aerial', 'serve', 'undercut', 'master', 'work', 'bank', 'end', 'documentary', 'everything', 'man', 'little', 'how', 'achieved', 'results']",N/A
