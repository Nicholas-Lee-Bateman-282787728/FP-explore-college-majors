726998,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007E2F5,A Customer,"[8, 14]","Summary:Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) is an up and coming clothes designer in New York who has fallen in love with Andrew Hennings (Patrick Dempsey), the son of New York City's Mayor, Kate Hennings (Candice Bergen).  When Andrew proposes, Melanie has to return to Alabama to get a divorce from her original husband, Jake Perry (Josh Lucas), whom she left after she decided to abort their child.  When she returns, she is forced to face her past - her parents and friends - all of the things that she has been trying to hide from her new friends in New York.What she ends up realizing is that she really is an Alabama girl and calls off the wedding with Andrew to renew her marriage with Jake.My Comments:For a romantic comedy, this movie was not funny.  Let me re-emphasize that point - not funny at all.  I think it was actually more offensive than anything - poking fun of Southerners.  The story was very contrived, did not make much sense and was not exciting.  The story left a lot of loose ends (what happens with Andrew and his mother; why doesn't Melanie get upset at Kate when she finds out that the 'reporter' that came to interview her was actually Kate's personal secretary, etc.).  Perhaps the best way to describe how bad this movie really is, is to tell you what the original ending was supposed to be.  Instead of having Melanie and Jake end up dancing in the bar, Jake walks into the tent where the original wedding was supposed to take place with Melanie pretending to be dead.  He tells everybody that she is dead and everyone is gasping, then he reveals it is a joke.  And we are supposed to find this funny?After seeing the original ending I felt completely secure in giving this my lowest rating.  The only actors that were worth watching were the parents: Candice Bergen, Mary Kay Place, and Fred Ward and perhaps Melanie's homosexual friend from Alabama, Ethan Embry who she 'outs' in a drunken fit.Overall, the movie is not funny, pokes fun at Southerners, and makes very little sense.  Perhaps they are hoping that they can use the 'Life seldom makes sense' ploy, but it just does not work for this one.

726999,A3QP8RGAUPF2OS,B00007E2F5,"A Customer ""Vicarious sycophants will abuse t...","[3, 41]","Hesitation over the title of this review was purely for consideration of people who might have taken offense at the use of homosexuality in the traditional role as a comedic device for dehumanizing people.  In this Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie role play kit, we are presented with two suspect homosexuals, the flamboyant  Black assistant fashion designer, and the quarry closet  homosexual who has to have his disorder pointed out to him, preferably in an embarrassing public denunciation.  Barbie  has to  learn  the  need for her to  script  and  typecast sexuality around  her because she is the sensation (fem fatal) for persuasion predominant in the sphere of people around her.  A Countrified Fantasy Fashion Designer Barbie Killer Instinct--role play kit.  And it is perhaps an interesting microcosm of analysis to vaguely note the teddy bear appeal assigned to the openly gay Black character, artistic, talented and unflinching.  It is the idea that for women, gay men make the best friends, that I won't quote yet I seem to have heard it somewhere in the cultural media stream at some time in the past.  Thus a possible depolarizing of ""sexual prowess"" is covertly used to adjust traditional racial stereotypes, (and that term is taken straight from multicultural theory).  Further complicating the plight of the Black male character in the film, is the Civil War reinactment-buffooning in the presumably lingering prejudicial South, where no doubt the image of African Americans as sexually iconoclastic, bandages wounded  White male libido traditionally injured by jibes of phallic innuendo.  Surely considerate people everywhere are tired of this dredging up of unpleasant or bawdy associations; circumcision is perhaps the original anthrospecific-insult (precursor to sexual dysfunction then marital dysfunction and the whole syndrom of social ills that erode social fabric from its core) but anthropologically the film is enriched elsewhere.Irving's character Jenny Garp, feminist author, cites being made a ""sexual suspect"", clearly there are procedural tolls long since put in place to accustom these suspicions of men and women.  Half asleep through the whole movie, I forget the Witherspoon character's name, but she essentially indicts a suspect homosexual male at one point, out of an urge perhaps, to solidify a group cathartic that had pleasantly gone on over the life of the individual in that community as a dissatisfactory standard of humane and non-discriminatory practice.  Barbie's tantrum must be a blood letting, her role is too prominent for softer and tactful, retiring or inhibited social display...she must be the ""bell of the ball"", the ""queen bee"" with attendant phalanxes of maidens, a sort of warrior aspect appreciated and encouraged in the feminine; whereas dominant female politicians  must stride more carefully to avoid becoming vilified on a masculine playing field.  There are no masculine defenders of the imasculine, no Garps to befriend gay football players.  Historic Southern  racism is lampooned, only to be replaced with the sexism of preferential or select social stereotyping and discrimination based on repression spawned feminine outlets of gay labeling, a favorite innocuous quarry for young girls influenced by such movies.  It's a man's world, so go kick the ""queers"", it's perfectly safe.--is the message.  Really it is just a comprehensive green light for offensive young women to go around tarring everybody with the gay label they don't particularly approve of--such sweethearts, somebody slap them.  The gay prompt has grown to such dimensions in the mass medias adverse stimulus conditioning we had to endure the whole ""Brokeback Mountain"" odyssey and cultural crisis.  Something just keeps wanting to load it into everybody's heads.Murphy Brown is the elder role model for Fashion  Barbie, what its like to grow up, become a crochety, semi-retired blonde who has scaled political obstacles, become Mayor, wear a suit, and combat the depreciation of appearing older than a plastic toy fresh from the hot injection  mold, while she dotes over the marital selection of her son. Bergen is what happens to Barbies when they grow old, a question that any would be Barbie surely asks, once the question has been loaded for her through symbolism, because just as surely, the pretense of a ""Barbie"" precludes higher order thinking skills, any anticipatory or empathic reflection--Barbie being the conceited thing it is.  That conceit is no more abundantly clear when the quarry queer, a meek and unassuming character is viciously stereotyped, ""Why don't you just admit you're a homosexual!?""  Why don't the movies just admit they're [....] mind control, written by apprentice flunkies who basically jerk-off the emotional susceptibility of innocent victims who paid money for maybe something more enlightening?Barbie has the decidedly impertinent and socially devastating master stroke saved for when after tremendous wedding preparation, long distance coordination with the big city, hundreds of people, relatives, costumes, food, etc. (a large diamond of course, conspicuously selected in a macabre scene with jewelry store ghouls (...full staff after midnight on overtime...right...only the very best for princess)--night of the living dead materialists in their empty catacombs of display cases), she changes her flighty little mind in the nick of time, and before a well timed downpour that punctuates her contempt for the wedding and the wedding party.  Rese Witherspoon needs these infant terrible outlets, her puckish and perky hypercriticality is what this [....] cesspool of a culture thrives on...or so it would be pawned off on us.  You won't like this next paragraph, oh great ones, but never assume All the munchkins where you pop in to do your do-do (make films)  are salivating and wringing their hands to come to greet you, kiss your shoes, or get your damn autograph.Salt Lake City must be summoned, like the great unwashed suddenly up for review by some nether world superiors alighting, to appear as extras  in the upcoming romp Legally Blonde II, (radio ads November 22, 2002 call for the comely and college aged, dark suited political types, and young children).  Sounds like the mothership giving instruction for disembarking, all who remain behind are condemned.  And don't you dare walk your walks where you live and cross paths with the film industry's eminent domain, the larger than life have minions of hounds carrying clipboards to accost all who stray into where the ""magic is made"", Ogden Utah's 25th Street and set for the tv drama 'Hardwood', or 'Viagrawood' or whatever its name was.  The perception is: We are a needed, but despised adjunct to opulence, a rancid and rabble public chattel for them to cull and elect from our insignificance (they pretend to entertain and in fact constantly insult) one or two anointed surfs to stardom.  Who wants to be the next American Idol?  Or, `The One'.  `..or thinks they can dance?'... `...or cook?'  I think its now a rancid (mostly citrus) entertainment media too.",2,Sweet homophobic Alabama,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",2006,7103,"['Hesitation', 'title', 'review', 'was', 'purely', 'consideration',

Plus before the movie started, the audience was packed with high school teenagers with their cellphones.  (They could litterally fiddle around with them for hours while looking seemingly busy.)  But my mom insisted and I obliged.  Anyways, the movie turned out to be pretty sweet and heartwarming.Melanie Carmichael (aka Melanie Smooter), played by Reese Witherspoon, is an up-and-coming New York City fashion designer who has just been proposed to by Andrew (Patrick Dempsey), the mayor's son.  (Quite an impressive proposal I might add, with the Tiffany store open just for them.)  There's only one problem, she's still legally married to Jake (Josh Lucas) in Alabama.  That's where the real story begins.  Melanie drives back to her hometown and nags Jake to sign the divorce papers.  He drags his feet while Melanie gets some time to get reacquainted with his family and friends, whom she left for seven years.  She desperately wants to believe that she's a whole new person (with the last-name change and all), and ends up hurting the ones who love her.  Does she get her divorce and who will she be with in the end?  Ah, for that you'll have to watch the film!I think the more interesting aspect of this film is watching Melanie come to her senses and acknowledge her roots.  In New York, she might have had to cover up who she really is to get to where she's at -- changing her last name and fabricating a tall tale about her family.  But it was a lie waiting to be exposed.  When she goes back to Alabama and brings this pompous personality back with her she is reminded that it won't get her anything but the disappointed looks of her friends and family; the people she left behind.In a nutshell, even though the ending was relatively predictable, the story is poignant enough and had sufficient  humorous scenes in it to keep the audience hooked.  (I particularly liked it when Melanie realizes that being married to Jake means that they still have a joint account at the local bank.)  Also, I think Reese Witherspoon gave a good performance, and it's always nice to see Candice Bergan in a frenzy.This is one of the better romantic comedies I've seen this year.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3 (Cute, has its sentimental moments.

With that said, it is hard to say anything too bad about one of her movies. Like 'Legally Blonde', 'Sweet Home Alabama' is nothing special - a romantic comedy whose romance is fairly predictable, and whose comedy is smile-inducing at best, but never really laugh-out-loud funny. However, that does not mean it is a bad movie. In fact, it is quite charming.Reese plays Melanie Carmichael, an up-and-coming fashion designer who has just been given the marriage purposal of a lifetime by her boyfriend, who is the son of the Mayor of New York City, played by Candice Bergen. In order to marry him, though, she must travel home to Alabama to ask her husband Jake, whom she left 7 years ago, for a divorce. He, of course, keeps putting off signing the divorce papers because we can all see he is still in love with her. Is she still in love with him? Or does she want to leave her past in the past, and move on to bigger and better things? What follows is your average romance story, with no twists or turns, but you're interested in seeing how exactly everything will turn out and when.The performances are good - newcomer Josh Lucas is great as Jake, and I'm sure we will be seeing a lot of him in the future. Reese delivers a great performance, as usual, although I don't think her performance here is as good as her performance in 'Legally Blonde'. And the entire supporting cast does a fine job as well (Candice Bergen is always great at playing snobby, cranky characters). All in all it's a fun film, and the romance, though a tad unoriginal, does not disappoint. And I would also like to say how happy I was that they didn't make Melanie's fiance a bad guy. In most love-triangle movies ('The Wedding Singer' comes to mind), the filmmakers make the fiance out to be a cheating jerk, and we have to wait for her to realize it and choose the right guy. Here in 'Alabama', she has a real decision to make, and it's not an easy one! (Hmm...rich guy who lets me pick out any engagement ring I want at Tiffany's, or my first love...?) So it gets a point there for not following the average romantic comedy formula.If you're looking for something light, and something a little romantic (especially for Valentine's Day) see this movie if you haven't already.

His no nonsense mother is none too pleased. However, there's a hitch. Melanie flies back down to her hometown in Alabama to settle some business. She and her former husband Jake(Josh Lucas), haven't actually gotten divorced. She sends the divorce papers, and he just keeps sending them right back. Melanie, who was once one of the crowd in this good 'ol southern town, now stands out as if she is somebody different. She is. It takes time in her hometown, and being with her parents and old friends, to get Melanie to realize and remember who she was...and still is. This, of course, sets up moments between Mel and Jake that will make the audience either smile because it's charming, or groan because they can play this film in their head without ever having to watch it. The movie is pleasant, but it isn't overly funny. The only funny line belongs to one of Mel's friends in a bar saying why she brings her baby into the bar. The actors, however, stand out more than the film itself. Reese is a wonderful and engaging actress. She is always likeable and credible. If only she had a much better movie to really wow us with. Josh Lucas is a good actor. He's not a non hick 'actor' playing a southern hick, he is the guy. Accent and all. He does a nice job. Candace Bergen is a real pro and she is good as always. Patrick Dempsey has come a ways from his ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Loverboy"" teen days, and he is shaping up to really break that old 'teen' career of his. Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place play Melanie's parents. The rest of the cast include ""Designing Women""'s Jean Smart, and Ethan Embry, who was seen in ""Dutch"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"". The film was competently directed by Andy Tennant. The other good thing about this film is the scenery. The film is shot well and the southern town is really beautiful. A nice little bonus there. One bad thing they did was make the Melanie character kind of unlikeable in the beginning. She comes back home in her ritzy duds and all that, and doesn't show a lot of care towards anybody. It's a bad thing when your main character is someone who the audience won't really like. Of course, they needed to do this so her change towards the end(and we all knew it was coming), would resonate more. All in all, it's a nice little movie that has it's charms, but it is nothing that hasn't been done a million times before. And better.",3,Sweet Reese,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",2003,3667,"['Okay', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'know', 'single', 'twist', 'turn', 'will', 'make', 'already', 'know', 'outcome', 'just', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Why', 'do', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'times', 'took', 'out', 'blueprint', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'followed', 'same', 'pattern', 'point', 'point', 'B', 'point', 'C.', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'star', 'course', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Reese', 'sort', 'become', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Cute', 'charming', 'young', 'actresses', 'who', 'have', 'certain', 'nitch', 'type', 'role', 'movie', 'centers', 'females', 'saw', 'Drew', 'do', 'Ever', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'now', 'Reese', 'following', 'Election', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'film', 'co-star', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'are', 'two', 'saving', 'graces', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'bad', 'cute', 'sweet', 'watchable', ""'ve"", 'just', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'Reese', 'plays', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'hot', 'shot', 'new', 'fashion', 'designer', 'think', 'Stella', 'McCartney', 'who', 'also', 'mentioned', 'film', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dating', 'slick', 'smooth', 'son', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'nicely', 'done', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'One', 'night', 'Melanie', 'Tiffany', 'nonsense', 'mother', 'none', 'too', 'pleased', 'However', 'hitch', 'Melanie', 'back', 'down', 'hometown', 'Alabama', 'settle', 'business', 'former', 'husband', 'Jake', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'have', ""n't"", 'actually', 'gotten', 'divorced', 'divorce', 'papers', 'just', 'sending', 'right', 'back', 'Melanie', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'one', 'crowd', 'good', 'southern', 'town', 'now', 'out', 'somebody', 'different', 'time', 'hometown', 'being', 'parents', 'old', 'friends', 'get', 'Melanie', 'realize', 'remember', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'course', 'up', 'moments', 'Mel', 'Jake', 'will', 'make', 'audience', 'either', 'smile', 'charming', 'groan', 'can', 'play', 'film', 'head', 'ever', 'having', 'watch', 'movie', 'pleasant', ""n't"", 'overly', 'funny', 'only', 'funny', 'line', 'belongs', 'one', 'Mel', 'friends', 'bar', 'saying', 'why', 'baby', 'bar', 'actors', 'however', 'stand', 'out', 'more', 'film', 'Reese', 'wonderful', 'engaging', 'actress', 'always', 'likeable', 'credible', 'only', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'really', 'wow', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'good', 'actor', 'not', 'non', 'hick', ""'actor"", 'playing', 'southern', 'hick', 'guy', 'Accent', 'nice', 'job', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'real', 'pro', 'good', 'always', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'come', 'ways', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Buy', 'Me', 'Love', 'Loverboy', 'teen', 'days', 'shaping', 'up', 'really', 'break', 'old', ""'teen"", 'career', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'play', 'Melanie', 'parents', 'rest', 'cast', 'include', 'Designing', 'Women', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', 'was', 'seen', 'Dutch', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'film', 'was', 'competently', 'directed', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'other', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'scenery', 'film', 'shot', 'well', 'southern', 'town', 'really', 'beautiful', 'nice', 'little', 'bonus', 'there', 'One', 'bad', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'make', 'Melanie', 'character', 'kind', 'unlikeable', 'beginning', 'back', 'home', 'ritzy', 'duds', ""n't"", 'show', 'lot', 'care', 'towards', 'anybody', 'bad', 'thing', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'course', 'needed', 'do', 'change', 'end', 'knew', 'was', 'coming', 'would', 'resonate', 'more', 'nice', 'little', 'movie', 'charms', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'better']",N/A

727021,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00007E2F5,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Sweet Home Alabama is about Reese Witherspoon's character planning to get married, except technically she's still married to a man who lives down south, so what does she get a strong urge to do?  She travels all the way down to Alabama where her (first) husband lives and immediately hands him the divorce papers so they can officially be separated except... he doesn't want to sign them just yet.  Instead he wants to toy around with Reese for a while because apparently the two still have a thing for each other.Now, I never thought Reese Witherspooon was the most attractive woman in the world, but she's absolutely *beautiful* in this film.  Maybe it's her hairstyle that won me over, or perhaps it's that I finally took a long hard look into her eyes and realized I see true beauty- I don't know exactly WHAT it is.  Perhaps I'm just growing older and noticing women more, who knows?Anyway, Sweet Home Alabama has a couple flaws.  For one thing, for a romantic type concept, it's not very emotional or interesting.  It's not even predictable, which is normally the problem with romantic comedies.  It's just... the actual storyline is average.  Extremely average, in fact.  Neither Reese, her husband down south, or her new husband ever really say or do anything that I would consider interesting or, to put it another way, worthy of your time.There's never any lengthy scene devoted to Reese going out of her way to indicate which man she'd like to spend her life with, or for that matter, she doesn't seem to care either way.  It feels more like Reese is just there for a nice quick vacation to check up on the family.  It's never really made clear through the storyline that either Reese's character or her two husbands have a serious thing for Reese- it's more like ""They just do"" and leave it at that.  To me this is a flaw because the movie never builds into an enticing storyline.  It tries to fill in the crucial elements of the storyline towards the end but by that point it feels like you just sat through too much pointless mediocrity to really care.As far as comedy is concerned, there's not a whole lot of laughs either.  The jokes are normally really weak and uninteresting just like the storyline.Now some of the characters are alright, such as the sarcastic and strict mother of the (new) husband, and the bloodhound segments are fun (and scary in one particular case involving an underwater dive) but the actual storyline leaves me completely bored.  I can't really recommend it to anyone except those who absolutely must see what all the fuss is about concerning this movie.

Reese gives us an irresistible charm that usually brightens up any movie that she's in and makes it better than it usually is. The same can be said for Sweet Home Alabama. A movie which is so predictable, you can almost utter each line yourself before the characters get them out of their honky tonk mouths. However, something can be said about predictability and in times like these, I think it's great to have a movie come out that you know you can fall in love with. Sweet Home Alabama is a perfect fit. Reese plays Melanie, a very succesful fashion designer who's left behind her hillbilly home. Living the glamorous life, she ends up falling for the mayor's son played by Patrick Dempsey, a handsome and rich man who happens to honestly adore her. Just when she thinks he couldn't get any more perfect, he proposes to her at Tiffany's. Just one problem ... she's keeping a big secret from him - she's already married. That's when our main character decides to go back to her hometown to get a divorce from her stubborn ex named Jake played by newcomer Josh Lucas. In typical romantic comedy fashion, Melanie and Jake get on eachother's nerves to the point that they wanna either strangle eachother or fall in love all over again. I don't wanna give to much away, but Melanie basically has to decide between her childhood sweetheart and the new prince in her life that wants to sweep her off her feet. It's predictable and very hokey, but you can't help but fall in love with this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when Melanie visits her old dog at a pet semetary and opens up about why she had to leave the animal behind. Its heartbreaking and very touching. Reese won't win any oscars for her portrayal as a confused small town girl, but she sure will win your heart.",4,Reese Gives Us Another Helping Of Her Charm,1033689600,"10 4, 2002",2002,1885,"['other', 'actress', 'lead', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'nearly', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'Reese', 'irresistible', 'charm', 'usually', 'up', 'movie', 'better', 'usually', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'A', 'movie', 'so', 'predictable', 'can', 'almost', 'utter', 'line', 'characters', 'get', 'honky', 'tonk', 'mouths', 'However', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'predictability', 'times', 'think', 'great', 'have', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'know', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Reese', 'plays', 'Melanie', 'very', 'succesful', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'left', 'hillbilly', 'home', 'Living', 'glamorous', 'life', 'up', 'falling', 'mayor', 'son', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'handsome', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'honestly', 'adore', 'Just', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'perfect', 'Tiffany', 'Just', 'one', 'problem', 'keeping', 'big', 'secret', 'already', 'married', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'decides', 'go', 'back', 'hometown', 'get', 'divorce', 'stubborn', 'ex', 'named', 'Jake', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fashion', 'Melanie', 'Jake', 'get', 'eachother', 'nerves', 'point', 'wan', 'strangle', 'eachother', 'fall', 'love', 'over', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'give', 'much', 'away', 'Melanie', 'basically', 'decide', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'new', 'prince', 'life', 'sweep', 'feet', 'predictable', 'very', 'hokey', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'movie', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'Melanie', 'old', 'dog', 'pet', 'semetary', 'up', 'about', 'why', 'had', 'leave', 'animal', 'behind', 'heartbreaking', 'very', 'touching', 'Reese', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'oscars', 'portrayal', 'confused', 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'sure', 'will', 'win', 'heart']",N/A

I like Reese Witherspoon very much- in fact, she is in some of my favorite movies (Election, Pleasantville and Legally Blonde).  I love light romantic comedies so I don't know why I didn't like this movie.  Maybe because I never really ended up laughing - I did smile a few times - and my 15-year old daughter loved the movie.  However, I think you can definitely wait for this one to come out on video.  This movie will appeal to teenage girls and young women who have yet to find out that life is not like the movies.  In other words, pure fairy tale.An adorable, perky, soon to the be the next greatest fashion designer from New York, Melanie Carmichel,  becomes engaged to the mayor's hottie of a son. But before she can marry him, she has to tie up loose ends back home in Alabama by getting her (secret) first husband of seven years to sign the divorce papers. He refuses.  Melanie then acts like a complete jerk to just about everyone she knew back when (which surprises no one in her home town because she was obviously not the most popular person in Pigeon Creek, AL).  Then, because this movie has to have some sort of plot, she begins to feel those old feelings for the first guy.  As they say over and over in the movie, ""Oh my god?!""  What should she do?  Should Melanie marry her rich, loving handsome and powerful fianc&eacute; in New York who defies his mother, the mayor, to marry her? Or, should she surrender to her sexual urges and go back with dull and boring (but cute in an ""aw shucks, maam"" kind of way) husband number one (who's name at this point I've already forgotten) and live in Pigeon Creek, Alabama? Tough choice.

727038,AKVU4HUG6AN1U,B00007E2F5,"""chick_flick""","[4, 6]","&quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, directed by Andy Tennant, is a charming, yet formulatic romantic comedy starring the always talented, Reese Witherspoon.PLOT SUMMARY: Melanie (Reese Witherspoon) is a small town Alabama native who wants something more in her life, so she moves out to New York City and becomes a famous fashion designer. There, she meets the mayor of New York City's son, and completely falls for him. But after he proposes to her, Melanie must go back home to Alabama (the only place she's been avoiding all these years) so she can get a divorce from her childhood best friend...only to discover that he may not actually want to get the divorce. And that there may still be sparks between the two. Now Melanie has a tough decision to make.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; is a very sweet and fun romantic comedy, but it is also very predictable. Still, it is very enjoyable. The dialouge is a little weak, but the storyline is good and the acting from the entire cast is solid. Reese Witherspoon especially shines in this one. The chemistry between Reese and her two love interests are good, and the directing was well-done. The DVD has a few interesting features like a commentary by the director, eight deleted scenes, alternate ending, and a music video, but nothing to go nuts over. If you like romantic comedies...even the formulatic ones, then this film is for you.I recommend &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;.Score:78/100C+",3,"Sweet, but formulatic romantic comedy.",1048032000,"03 19, 2003",2003,1463,"['quot', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'directed', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'charming', 'yet', 'formulatic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'always', 'talented', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon.PLOT', 'SUMMARY', 'Melanie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'small', 'town', 'Alabama', 'native', 'who', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'out', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'famous', 'fashion', 'designer', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'son', 'completely', 'falls', 'Melanie', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'Alabama', 'only', 'place', 'been', 'avoiding', 'years', 'can', 'get', 'divorce', 'childhood', 'best', 'friend', 'only', 'discover', 'may', 'not', 'actually', 'want', 'get', 'divorce', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'sparks', 'two', 'Now', 'Melanie', 'tough', 'decision', 'make.MY', 'OVERALL', 'THOUGHTS', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'very', 'sweet', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'also', 'very', 'predictable', 'Still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'dialouge', 'little', 'weak', 'storyline', 'good', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'solid', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'especially', 'one', 'chemistry', 'Reese', 'two', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'good', 'directing', 'was', 'well-done', 'DVD', 'few', 'interesting', 'features', 'commentary', 'director', 'eight', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'music', 'video', 'nothing', 'go', 'nuts', 'over', 'like', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'even', 'formulatic', 'ones', 'then', 'film', 'you.I', 'recommend', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'quot']",N/A

A beautiful, young Manhattan clothes designer (Witherspoon) becomes engaged to the son of the mayor (the gorgeous Patrick Dempsey). One hitch: unbeknownst to her fiance, she is still married to her high school sweetheart (the also gorgeous Josh Lucas) in Alabama. So our heroine must travel to the South, and to her forgotten past, to get her divorce. Of course, her trip back home does not turn out the way she envisioned and she ends up having to stay there longer than expected.When you see the movie the first time, many of the scenes are very funny. When you see it again, you still enjoy it (if you're a fan of this genre), but more for the romance and the beautiful settings (there is a scene in Tiffany's that  is amazing) than the humor. However, it is still well worth the trip to Alabama again and again. Witherspoon packs so much charm and grace in her role.The DVD is actually a great buy for movie fans. The director takes you through an entire storyline that was cut (Witherspoon's assistant having a crush on Dempsey's character) and explains  why. He also shows you an alternate ending that was shot and cut. His commentary over the film is also interesting, particularly as this was one of the first films shot in NY after September 11th. Plus, he tells you about various choices he made-for example, both guys were good guys, making the heroine's decision harder.I would recommend ""Sweet Home Alabama"" to fans of the romantic comedy genre or Southern flavored movies.

This romantic comedy contrasts the urbane sophistication of New York with the quaint folksiness of small-town Alabama, a motif that's been around since the days of Mark Twain. What makes this rendition work is the performances, particularly that of charming, seemingly-natural Reese Witherspoon. The girl can do no wrong. Once again she shows a remarkable timing for comedy, and projects the right blend of world-weary wisdom and little-girl innocence. Dark-haired Patrick Dempsey and rugged, blond Josh Lucas are perfectly cast as the two men who represent different potential futures for Melanie. It is wonderfully brave that C. Jay Cox (who wrote the screenplay) and director Andy Tennant have refused to make Melanie's choice an easy one--either man would make a wonderful husband, yet only one can be the right choice for Melanie. It is to the screenwriter's credit that he never goes for the easy laugh or the easy way out. The supporting cast is also perfect, especially Mary Kay Place and Jean Smart as a pair of Southern mamas. Candice Bergen's cold, patrician New York mother is a bit of a caricature, albeit a funny one. The George Fenton soundtrack helps establish the hominess of life in Alabama, which represents a past Melanie (in &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; Melanie was the good girl who did everything the right way) tries to escape from. This film is a lovely antidote to all the violence, gore, and video-game commercialism in so many films today. The commentary by the director is interesting and enlightening, as he describes his rationale for deleting certain scenes. The DVD also has the unused original ending, which would have given the film a bit of a different spin. Even if you can see the ending coming a mile away, you can't help but cheer the happy couple on.

The director of the film, Andy Tennant, makes the wise decision to put his leading lady in nearly every scene.  Witherspoon plays New Yorker Melanie Carmichael, a girl with a past.  She is a rising star as a fashion designer and she is engaged to the gorgeous Andrew Hennings, the mayor's son.The problem is that Melanie hails from from Pigeon Creek, Alabama, a town that has not changed much in years, and her past is not pretty. Since she is ashamed of her roots, Melanie has invented a more palatable story about her upbringing, pretending that she grew up as an upper class young lady in a mansion.  Will she be able to keep her secrets hidden long enough to marry Andrew?  Or will the easygoing charm of Pigeon Creek lure her away from the excitement and challenges of life in New York City?If you do not know the answers to these questions, then you are not paying attention.  The entire plot of this movie is telegraphed after the first fifteen minutes.  Since we know where the movie is headed, what makes it watchable?  The answer is the cast.  Witherspoon is cute, charming and spunky.  Both Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey are adorable as the two men who love Melanie.  Good supporting work is provided by Candice Bergen who is typecast as the overbearing and snooty mayor and Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place as Melanie's loving but confused parents.If you want a movie with surprises, twists and turns, this is not the film for you.

Hollywood has found a winner in Reese Witherspoon, and they need to get her out to the ticket-buying public.  So we're probably going to see a lot of light comedies, and if they just don't blow it too much, I'm all for some pleasant, if mindless entertainment.I'm sorry to say that if you see the trailer, you've seen just about all there is to see.  You have Alabama-girl Reese making it big in New York City, and needing to go back home to secure a divorce so she can marry the son of the mayor of New York.  You see the look on her face as she has to observe what she used to be.  We get the predictable clash of cultures.  And we get to breathlessly see who she's going to choose.There are some nice touches in the film that almost hooked me.  For one, her new fianc&eacute; is not  portrayed as the one-dimensional jerk you'd expect.  In fact, you wonder sometimes why there is even an issue on which one to choose.  Another very good scene happens when ""Felony Melanie"" gets blasted in a bar, and says a lot of revealing things in her drunkenness.  This part of the film actually makes some of the characters more interesting, and I thought it might pull it out at that point.But no, we have an ending that dumps all that.

Marriage licenses require proof of divorce if someone was divorced less than a year before applying for the license.

There are some big problems with this movie, which supposedly takes place in New York and someplace in Southern Alabama (has to be Southern Alabama, since &quot;mobile airport&quot; gets a mention).  Yet it presents an idealized New York, where unknown girls with no education become famous designers in seven years, and a mythical Alabama, where, apparently, the evils of Generica are left behind.  Where are the strip malls?  The movie complexes?  The Ruby Tuesday's, or at least the Cracker Barrels?Small town South with one-bar-honky-tonk and water-tower pranks is, alas, hard to find.  What is EASY to find are small towns whose local trade is depleted but which are riddled with chainstores and fast growth.  Since the movie tries to put New York in the present, it ought to at least TRY to put Alabama in the present.  Heck, I don't think I even saw anyone drink sweet tea or eat banana pudding... let alone crunch a palmetto bug.I guess it's too much trouble to take a hard look at what it's really like to live in the South... I live in a city (Montgomery) but I've driven all over the state to visit schools, and there is no place like this town.However. I saw My Cousin Vinny again recently and forgave that movie the same sin.  Why?  Because My Cousin Vinny is FUNNY.(also, despite its mythical, isolated town, at least My Cousin Vinny did get some quirks about Southerners right-- understatement, tendency to give directions by historical/personal landmarks, importance of &quot;visiting&quot; when doing business, etc.)The biggest problem with Sweet Home Alabama isn't it's false fish-out-of-mythical-water quality.  The real trouble is that for the first twenty minutes of the movie, the main character is a self-absorbed, nasty little witch who hasn't seen her parents in years.  She never opens her mouth except to put down the town she's come from, or the people in it...the movie counts on us hanging in there until she feels repentant.  I did, but only because it was a rental.  This character had none of the charm of Elle in Legally Blonde.  She was pretty, but-- no doubt in an attempt to do Southern &quot;feisty&quot;-- she was also aggressive and rude.  She behaves like all the stereotypes of New Yorkers, actually (at least the movie doesn't blame New York for her self-absorbtion)There's no suspense, since a flashback at the beginning of the movie tells us, in case we were unsure, which guy we should want the girl to end up with.We're way ahead of the movie, and the ride is slow.",2,"Not authentically Southern, but really fake/predictable",1070582400,"12 5, 2003",2003,2703,"['Looking', 'something', 'rent', 'visiting', 'family', 'New', 'Jersey', 'saw', 'now', 'live', 'Alabama', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try.BUT', 'are', 'big', 'problems', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'someplace', 'Southern', 'Alabama', 'be', 'Southern', 'Alabama', 'quot', 'mobile', 'airport', 'quot', 'mention', 'idealized', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'unknown', 'girls', 'education', 'become', 'famous', 'designers', 'seven', 'years', 'mythical', 'Alabama', 'where', 'apparently', 'evils', 'Generica', 'are', 'left', 'are', 'strip', 'malls', 'movie', 'complexes', 'Ruby', 'Tuesday', 'least', 'Cracker', 'Barrels', 'Small', 'town', 'South', 'one-bar-honky-tonk', 'water-tower', 'pranks', 'alas', 'hard', 'find', 'What', 'EASY', 'find', 'are', 'small', 'towns', 'local', 'trade', 'depleted', 'are', 'riddled', 'chainstores', 'fast', 'growth', 'movie', 'put', 'New', 'York', 'present', 'ought', 'least', 'TRY', 'put', 'Alabama', 'present', 'Heck', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'saw', 'anyone', 'drink', 'sweet', 'tea', 'eat', 'banana', 'pudding', 'let', 'alone', 'crunch', 'palmetto', 'bug.I', 'guess', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'live', 'South', 'live', 'city', 'Montgomery', ""'ve"", 'driven', 'state', 'visit', 'schools', 'place', 'town.However', 'saw', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'again', 'recently', 'forgave', 'movie', 'same', 'sin', 'Why', 'My', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'FUNNY', 'also', 'mythical', 'isolated', 'town', 'least', 'Cousin', 'Vinny', 'did', 'get', 'quirks', 'Southerners', 'right', 'understatement', 'tendency', 'give', 'directions', 'historical/personal', 'landmarks', 'importance', 'quot', 'visiting', 'quot', 'when', 'doing', 'business', 'etc', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', ""n't"", 'false', 'fish-out-of-mythical-water', 'quality', 'real', 'trouble', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'self-absorbed', 'nasty', 'little', 'witch', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'parents', 'years', 'never', 'mouth', 'put', 'down', 'town', 'come', 'people', 'movie', 'hanging', 'repentant', 'did', 'only', 'was', 'rental', 'character', 'had', 'none', 'charm', 'Elle', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'was', 'pretty', 'doubt', 'attempt', 'do', 'Southern', 'quot', 'feisty', 'quot', 'was', 'also', 'aggressive', 'rude', 'stereotypes', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'actually', 'least', 'movie', ""n't"", 'blame', 'New', 'York', 'self-absorbtion', 'suspense', 'flashback', 'beginning', 'movie', 'case', 'were', 'unsure', 'guy', 'should', 'want', 'girl', 'end', 'up', 'with.We', ""'re"", 'way', 'ahead', 'movie', 'ride', 'slow']",N/A

Best yet, she's believable in just about every role she plays.  However, this is not one of her best films.  Of course, that doesn't mean it's bad either.  Reese plays Melanie Carmichael, an uptown fashion designer who seems to have it all -- beauty, talent, a hunk of a new fiance (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be wealthy and in politics, and her designer star is on the rise.  Just when she thinks life couldn't get better, it gets complicated.  You see, Reese married her childhood sweetheart (Josh Lucas) from Alabama when she was young.  The problem is that she's still married to him ... technically.  After accepting the matrimonial offer from Mr. Dempsey, Reese runs home to Alabama to permanently sever her nuptial ties with Lucas.  Not so surprisingly, it's not that easy.  The majority of the movie is spent with Reese in Alabama trying to convince Lucas to give her the divorce so she can move on.  At first, she tries a downright beligerent approach.  As the movie goes on, her approach softens and so does she -- she gets sweet on Alabama and on Jake (Lucas) again.  Watch the movie to see how it all turns out.  The movie has a few funny moments, courtesy mostly of Candice Bergen who plays Dempsey's mayor mother, but is genuinely endearing throughout most of it.  I would have liked to have given this romantic comedy 4 stars, but it fell just a little short in believability and conviction -- I wasn't 100% behind her final choice, and that's important in romantic comedies.As for the extras ...

A movie of considerable charm can appear overblown and banal when observed in an uncomfortable location, while a less inspired film may gain an added charm or flavor when examined in a more favorable setting. On the evening I went to see Sweet Home Alabama at Loews Cineplex in Glen Cove, I was forced to contend with a dilapidated, dirty screening area, the incessant ringing of cellular phones, and an insufferable audience of rowdy middle school students and talkative old ladies. Perhaps under different circumstances, I might have found more to enjoy in this romantic comedy about second chances and competing values. However, from my narrow seat, the film seamed to be a mirror of the current environment: unpleasant, insulting and ultimately revolting to those who value decorum and good taste.The movie stars the charming and beautiful Reese Witherspoon as Melanie Carmichael, a sophisticated New York City designer who appears to have it all: a successful career, a politically correct assortment of friends, and a marriage proposal from the mayor's son (Patrick Dempsey). Unfortunately, before she can tie the knot with Mr. Right, she must journey to Alabama to divorce the redneck husband (Josh Lucas) she abandoned seven years earlier. As Melanie becomes re-acquainted with her old home town, fate (and a terminally unfunny screenplay by C. Jay Cox) leads her through a series of painfully contrived vignettes that illustrate the simple pleasures of country life and the boisterous charm of Alabama's populace. By the time our heroine is called upon to decide which lifestyle she wishes to lead, director Andy Tennant has managed to insult American citizens on both sides of the Mason Dixon Line, introduce a supporting cast of the most stereotyped southerners this side of a Dukes of Hazzard rerun, and waste the considerable comedic and dramatic talents of Witherspoon (who should have had the good sense to avoid this travesty in the first place).In the film's defense, Candice Bergen made me laugh roughly three times as New York's elitist mayor, and the repeated renditions of the title song were quite pleasant.",1,"Offensive to Southerners, Northerners and Humans in General",1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,2277,"['have', 'come', 'believe', 'enjoyment', 'one', 'watching', 'motion', 'picture', 'often', 'directly', 'linked', 'setting', 'view', 'movie', 'considerable', 'charm', 'can', 'appear', 'overblown', 'banal', 'when', 'observed', 'uncomfortable', 'location', 'less', 'inspired', 'film', 'may', 'gain', 'added', 'charm', 'flavor', 'when', 'examined', 'more', 'favorable', 'setting', 'evening', 'went', 'see', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'Loews', 'Cineplex', 'Glen', 'Cove', 'was', 'forced', 'contend', 'dilapidated', 'dirty', 'screening', 'area', 'incessant', 'ringing', 'cellular', 'phones', 'insufferable', 'audience', 'rowdy', 'middle', 'school', 'students', 'talkative', 'old', 'ladies', 'Perhaps', 'different', 'circumstances', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'more', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'second', 'chances', 'competing', 'values', 'However', 'narrow', 'seat', 'film', 'seamed', 'be', 'mirror', 'current', 'environment', 'unpleasant', 'insulting', 'ultimately', 'revolting', 'who', 'value', 'decorum', 'good', 'taste.The', 'movie', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'sophisticated', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'designer', 'who', 'have', 'successful', 'career', 'politically', 'correct', 'assortment', 'friends', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'mayor', 'son', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Unfortunately', 'can', 'tie', 'knot', 'Mr', 'Right', 'must', 'journey', 'Alabama', 'divorce', 'redneck', 'husband', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'abandoned', 'seven', 'years', 'earlier', 'Melanie', 're-acquainted', 'old', 'home', 'town', 'fate', 'terminally', 'unfunny', 'screenplay', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'series', 'painfully', 'contrived', 'vignettes', 'illustrate', 'simple', 'pleasures', 'country', 'life', 'boisterous', 'charm', 'Alabama', 'populace', 'time', 'heroine', 'called', 'decide', 'lead', 'director', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'managed', 'insult', 'American', 'citizens', 'sides', 'Mason', 'Dixon', 'Line', 'introduce', 'supporting', 'cast', 'most', 'stereotyped', 'southerners', 'side', 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'rerun', 'waste', 'considerable', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'talents', 'Witherspoon', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'avoid', 'travesty', 'first', 'place', 'film', 'defense', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'made', 'roughly', 'three', 'times', 'New', 'York', 'elitist', 'mayor', 'repeated', 'renditions', 'title', 'song', 'were', 'quite', 'pleasant']",N/A

So she goes back to her roots to settle their divorce only to find she can't leave who she is behind or ignore it anymore. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of sweet, romantic comedy, and pure talent. The dialouge and script was written gracefully, and in my opinion, the movie has no flaws.

727097,A3TM66F5GG21EJ,B00007E2F5,J. Jessup,"[4, 5]","Sweet Home Alabama has been playing on a continuous loop on my dvd player. I just can't seem to get enough of this movie. I don't know why I love it so much...or at least I didn't know until I watched the movie AGAIN but this time with the director commentary.The genesis for this film came at the behest of the Andy Tennant's dad who was a prodigious letter writer. He once wrote to his son about witnessing the astonishing effects of lightning hitting the sand. That letter and the visuals of the pools of hot sandy glass was at the core of what inspired this movie.Of course the writers let their imaginations run wild because fulgurites don't usually look like what is shown in the film...but where love stories are concerned fantasy will also beat reality into submission.  In the drudgery of the real world this is usually what happens to sand when lightning strikes itThe scene of the marriage proposal at Tiffany's was also based on a real story. A friend of the directors really did propose to his girlfriend at Tiffany's. In the movie that is no set but the real store and the actual employees of the Tiffany store in New York CityThe dog. Bryant was portrayed by a coon hound named Baron and according to Andy was the ""worst actor on the set"". He refused to bark or sit on command and all of the scenes with him were a ""miracle of editing""The scene where Bryant jumps in the lake after a bone and sinks is based on the movies producer who owned a dog who really could dive to the bottom of a pool and retrieve a ball. In the movie however those scenes were done using a puppet and not the real dog. This includes the scene when Bryant pops up having found the bone and is swimming back to the pier. This is the sculptors rendering of the dogs head that was used in the submersion scenesThe dogs names in the film...Bear (the dog that died) and Bryant are both named for legendary Alabama football coach Paul Bear Bryant.The film was mostly shot in a small town in Georgia called Crawfordville. Jakes fishing cabin, the bank and Stella's Roadhouse really do exist and a lot of the local townspeople were featured in the films party and festival scenes.Speaking of the roadhouse. The first time we see it is when Melanie has followed Jake there to harass him about the divorce. When she walks in there is a band on stage. That band features Keni Thomas.Keni is not just a singer but a survivor who lived through the horrors of Somalia featured in the book and film Blackhawk Down. It was his unit that was caught in the ambush in MogadishuThe popular Vermont glass artisan Simon Pearce was the basis for Jakes character.  In fact Jake's own ""Tiffany scene"" toward the end of the film when Melanie tries to find out more about Southwest Glass features every item from the actual Simon Pearce storeOne of the more rollicking yet controversial aspects of Sweet Home Alabama was the story line as to how Melanie came to be known as ""Felony Melanie"".That part of the film is also based on fact. Andy Tennant's godfather and namesake was a legendary character actor named Andy DevineMelanie's childhood is based on Andy's own wild child upbringing and that includes the story of Fuzz the cat that blew up the bank.According to Devine's relatives;""...the various versions of the ""cat incident"" make Andy sound awful, but she says the incident did indeed occur.  What actually happened was that one of the local judges offered Andy and a friend 50 cents to get rid of a mangy old cat for him.  He emphasized that they do so in  humane manner.  Fifty cents was a princely sum in those days, so Andy and his friend undertook this assignment.. They knew where some dynamite was, so took cat, dynamite and a long, long fuse to the dump where they proceeded to carefully wrap the cat in dynamite.  What could be more humane than instant destruction, they reasoned.  They lit the fuse and ran like crazy.  They looked around and much to their dismay found the cat following them fuse burning vigorously.  The boys ran by the Van Marter house and the cat ran under the house.  Andy said he was terrified that the dynamite would blow up the house, but the cat ran out from under the house and into the woodshed.  The woodshed blew sky high.  No one ever knew what happened until years later Andy, in a personal appearance in Kingman, confessed to the crime.""Even the coon hound cemetery in the film is real, though the one on film is actually a set because producers were worried about traipsing all over the graves of cherished pets. The real coon hound cemetery was established in 1937 and is in Freedom Hills. The cemetery in the film is an exact duplicate of the original right down to the head stones and signsCOON DOG EULOGYLet not your hearts be troubled,for in his master's swamp are many den trees.If it were not so, I would have told you.He has gone to prepare a place for youand where he has gone Ole Red will go also.Dogs, they say, do not have souls.They only have hide and bones.But I believe there is a coon dog heavenand Red is gone were the good coon dogs go.Anybody that coon hunts has to believe in God.If you have known the music of coon hounds on a trailand heard the excitement in their voices when they strike,and seen their eagerness and determination when they tree,if you have seen their courage and braveryin a tough fight with an old boar coon,if you have heard their anguished cries and howls,if you have seen the ugly gashesand bleeding woundsand witnessed their resolve to never quit,you know there has to be a God to make an animal like that.And a God that that would make a coon dogwon't forget him when he is gone.There is a coon dog heaven and Ole Red is there.And every night he runsand the den trees are there in the old swampand the old hunter's moon hangs low in the westand the coons don't go up no slick barked treesand the carbide don't run outand there ain't no bull nettle and saw briarsand old master always knocks the coon outand lets Ole Red grab him and give him a good shake;and then he gets a pat on the headand climbs back into the kennel in the back of the pick-up truckand goes home and sleeps all day.'Cause he knows in coon dog heaven he can hunt againwhen the sun goes down and the tree frogs holler.May the bones of Ole Red rest in peace,through the mercy of Godand may the coon hunters light perpetually shine upon him.AMENAnd so we come to the eight frames of Josh's blue eyes.If you have seen the film, this particular scene happens when Jake comes down stairs in his store to find Melanie there petting Bryant and staring up at him.Andy says in the commentary that he's a guy and did not realize how gorgeous Josh was until he cut a few frames from this scene just to save some time. Apparently one of the female editors on the film had such a conniption fit about this that he immediately put them back.  So when you watch the movie with his commentary he is practically giggling while he literally counts the full 8 frames of Josh's blue eyes.My all time favorite part of the Sweet Home Alabama is at the end.  Andy talks about the wedding cake saying that Rock-em-Sock-em Robots are a rather hilarious representation of the passionate relationship between Jake and Melanie.I don't really want to get married but I sho nuff would like to have a party at a honky tonk with that 3 tiered cake topped with robots.Sweet Home Alabama really is the very essence of the word sweet. I guess that is why I appreciate it so much. Usually when Hollywood goes south we end up with a 2 hour film full of negative stereotypes ala Deliverance. But here Andy Tennant has taken ALL of the stereotypes and presented them in a brighter light. His commentary is BRILLIANT because he is not talking AT you but with you so by the end of the film you feel like you just watched this movie with your best friend.Ultimately I think Melanie and by extension the films viewers got the same lesson that Dorothy did...that sometimes what you want and what you need is right there in front of you and there really is ""no place like home""",5,8 FRAMES

So, Reese Witherspoon plays Melanie, the up and coming New York fashion designer who's won the heart of the Mayor's son, Andrew (Patrick Dempsey). And what a Hunk Andy is! Not only is he reminiscent of JFK, Jr., but he proposes to Melanie by escorting her into Tiffany's after-hours and inviting her to pick out the engagement ring of her choice. What's a poor girl to do but say ""yes""? But, before the nuptials, she must go back home to Alabama to take care of some private business, which is get divorce papers signed by her childhood sweetheart and secret husband Jake (Josh Lucas), long since estranged.Reese is sweet - a worthy successor to MR. And Lucas has that roguish handsomeness and attitude of, say, Matthew McConaughey or a very young Paul Newman. As a matter of fact, the only thing wrong with Jake, according to the scriptwriters, is that he hasn't any prospects, lives with his coon dog in backwater Alabama, plays pool with his good ol' boy buds on Saturday night, was too drunk to dance with Melanie at their wedding reception, and, well, isn't Andrew.Perhaps the best reason to see SWEET HOME ALABAMA is Candice Bergen as Kate, the Big Apple's mayor and Andrew's mother. Kate sees her son as Presidential material, so appearances are everything. She's horrified that he might actually (gulp!) marry someone so plebeian as a fashion designer. Kate's persona is acerbic MURPHY BROWN gone on to bigger things. So how do you suppose she'll react if she discovers that Melanie's parents live in a double-wide? And, speaking of parents, Fred Ward appears as Earl, Melanie's Dad. Where's Fred been since he played the unlucky Gus Grissom in THE RIGHT STUFF (1983)?Now, don't think me a complete curmudgeon. This isn't a badly done or unpleasant movie. But how many times do we have to revisit the storyline? During the film's opening scene, an 11 year-old Melanie shares a first kiss with an equally young Jake on a beach during a thunder and lightning storm.

But when she gets there, she remembers what her life used to be, and what her marriage uset to be. And, suddenly, she starts to like it! If so, why did she run away on everybody and stayed away for seven years??!! ...And also, there are plenty of embarassing scenes, like the final one with the wedding. And the characters' reactions and interactions are all wrong.

Reese Witherspoon delivers a great performance as... Reese Witherspoon, newly crowned ""it"" girl of the 2000s. While she doesn't have the natural homogenous quality that makes Julia Roberts so universally appealing to every other human being, she does have a sass and spunk that help her flesh out an already decently conceived character. The same could be said for Ethan Embry in turning his supporting role as a closeted best friend into something nuanced and nearly dignified, but the script won't completely do away with its cliches, preventing any character from truly offering anything new that we haven't seen already. Candice Bergen is especially wasted as a one-note evil mother-in-law in training, and Fred Ward's embodiment of the ""South Will Rise Again"" mentality sours the whole film. In a time where the differences between the USA and other nations is becoming a crucial focus point worldwide, it's ironic that we have a romantic comedy that celebrates isolationism within our very borders.

727135,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00007E2F5,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 5]","Reese Witherspoon is the main attraction of 2002's SWEET HOME ALABAMA, an almost absurdly formulaic and predictable romantic comedy. Luckily for SWEET HOME ALABAMA, Witherspoon's screen presence lifts this film up from the merely humdrum and makes it watchable, entertaining, and even believable---at least until the last five minutes or so.Alabama-born Melanie Carmichael (Witherspoon) is one of New York's preeminent fashion designers, engaged to the JFK Jr.-like son of New York's woman Mayor (Candice Bergen) who plays her role as a power-mad politician with an unpleasantly realistic air.Shortly after the engagement, Melanie travels Way Down South on the quiet to take care of a little unfinished business---including finally dumping the undivorced, plaid workshirt, mullet-headed, ballcap-wearing, chaw-preferring, beer-guzzling husband she's left behind.Greeted like the Antichrist upon her return home, Melanie's secret life is laid bare, including a teenage pregnancy and an upbringing that was short on Plantation but long on Pickup Truck. As a matter of fact, ""Felony Melanie"" has quite the past reputation, and it isn't helped by her present City Cousin ways---the locals come to her door with pitchforks and torches and a rail on which to run her out of town. For her part, she can't stand her roots and is embarrassed and humiliated by the metaphorical red clay on the soles of her feet.Worse yet, her stubborn not-quite ex is dedicated to making her life miserable by not finalizing the divorce papers. Forced by circumstance to hang around the old back forty, Melanie, willy-nilly begins to reconnect with her past life. Things come to a head when her New York fiance shows up, and she is forced to acknowledge the past she's been denying.As noted, Witherspoon is the best element of the film. She is engaging and likeable, and utterly convincing as the conflicted, emotionally fragile Melanie, so much so that the viewer is compelled to comfort her in her confusion (or this one wishes he had). Witherspoon finds the humor in every situation, and sometimes the tears, playing Melanie with an honesty that is surprising for this genre of film. In short, she acquits herself very well.

727147,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00007E2F5,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","There is nothing wrong with a film having a predictable plot.  After all, in the biggest money making film of all time everybody knew the ship was going to sink.  Not that there is anything wrong with surprising the audience (remember when it dawned on your that Julia Roberts did not deserve to get the guy in ""My Best Friends Wedding""?).  Kenneth Burke defined ""form"" as the creation of an appetite in the mind of an audience and the satisfying of that appetite.  Therefore in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" we know that Toula is going to do the Ugly Duckling bit and live happily ever after.  In ""Sweet Home Alabama"" we know that when Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) goes home to sweet Alabama to get a divorce from Jake Perry (Josh Lucas) in order to marry John John clone Andrew Hennings (Patrick Dempsey) that it just ain't gonna happen.  There is nothing wrong with that.  But where ""Sweet Home Alabama"" fails is in not providing memorable moments of the heroine stopping to smell the magnolias as the movie works to its predictable conclusion.The film begins with a trip down memory lane when young Melanie and Jake shared their first kiss and pledged undying love amidst a lighting strike.  This certainly established an expectation on the part of the audience that a second lightning strike was going to play a pivotal role in the film's climax.  But that is an appetite that is never satisfied.  During the scene where Andrew proposes to Melanie at Tiffany's there are promising signs for the film's prospects in the delighted faces of the people standing behind the counters of diamond rings.  It is a lovely little moment that we are allowed to enjoy.  But early on we also have the fashion show where Melanie becomes a star and despite the cinematic possibilities inherent in beautiful women wearing gorgeous dresses walking down a runway, the film races through the moment.  Instead of showing us that Melanie is a star, the film opts for just telling us she is a star and moves along.The screenplay by C. Jay Cox, based on Douglas J. Eboch's story, does this one pretty much by the numbers.  Melanie goes home and shows disdain for everybody and everything until she learns the error of her ways and the lies upon which she has built her new life are all revealed.  Melanie is really a good girl deep down in her heart, a fact confirmed in our minds by the fact that both Jake's coon dog and his mom (Jean Smart) disregard her histrionics in favor of sedate total acceptance.  The subplot involving Andrew's maniacal mayor mom (Candice Bergen) is just another set of numbers to be played out. True, Andrew does not deserve his fate in this film, but he was pretty much doomed once his mother read the poll results and went ahead with his birth.Ultimately the film comes down to the revelation of Jake's secret.  The reason that he never got the divorce from Melanie is that he wanted to prove he was good enough for her.  On the one hand, what he came up with was an excellent choice, especially given the premises of the film.  But on the other hand Melanie's discovery of the Jake's secret, which could have been the most wonderful moment in the film, goes back to the telling rather than showing.  Melanie is given a couple of big clues to help her alone (My better way of doing it?  Remember that object in Jake's trailer?  It should have been at this place instead).Witherspoon is fine given what she has to work with the script, but Lucas is the one who really shines, which is certainly saying something given his co-star, who is definitely the blonde de jour in American cinema at the moment.  Besides, Jean Smart plays the mother of his character and that is always going to be a good sign in most movies.  Lucas ends up being the lynchpin of ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" and I shudder to think how low this film could have sunk if he did not provide it with some grounding.  The film does little with the once and future happy couple's group of friends, and Mary Kay Place and Fred Ward are wasted as Melanie's parents in their doublewide trailer home.  In the end I get the feeling that as soon as the people who made ""Sweet Home Alabama"" signed Reese Witherspoon to star in the film they stopped working on the script and started counting their profits.",3,A sweet but by the numbers romantic comedy,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,4277,"['nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'having', 'predictable', 'plot', 'biggest', 'money', 'making', 'film', 'time', 'everybody', 'knew', 'ship', 'was', 'going', 'sink', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'surprising', 'audience', 'remember', 'when', 'dawned', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'get', 'guy', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Wedding', 'Kenneth', 'Burke', 'defined', 'form', 'creation', 'appetite', 'mind', 'audience', 'satisfying', 'appetite', 'Therefore', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'know', 'Toula', 'going', 'do', 'Ugly', 'Duckling', 'bit', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'know', 'when', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'home', 'sweet', 'Alabama', 'get', 'divorce', 'Jake', 'Perry', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'order', 'marry', 'John', 'John', 'clone', 'Andrew', 'Hennings', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'happen', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'where', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'not', 'providing', 'memorable', 'moments', 'heroine', 'stopping', 'smell', 'magnolias', 'movie', 'predictable', 'conclusion.The', 'film', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'young', 'Melanie', 'Jake', 'shared', 'first', 'kiss', 'pledged', 'undying', 'love', 'amidst', 'lighting', 'strike', 'certainly', 'established', 'expectation', 'part', 'audience', 'second', 'lightning', 'strike', 'was', 'going', 'play', 'pivotal', 'role', 'film', 'climax', 'appetite', 'never', 'satisfied', 'scene', 'where', 'Andrew', 'Melanie', 'Tiffany', 'are', 'promising', 'signs', 'film', 'prospects', 'delighted', 'people', 'standing', 'counters', 'diamond', 'rings', 'lovely', 'little', 'moment', 'are', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'early', 'also', 'have', 'fashion', 'show', 'where', 'Melanie', 'star', 'cinematic', 'possibilities', 'inherent', 'beautiful', 'women', 'wearing', 'gorgeous', 'dresses', 'walking', 'down', 'runway', 'film', 'races', 'moment', 'Instead', 'showing', 'Melanie', 'star', 'film', 'opts', 'just', 'telling', 'star', 'along.The', 'screenplay', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'based', 'Douglas', 'J.', 'Eboch', 'story', 'one', 'pretty', 'much', 'numbers', 'Melanie', 'home', 'disdain', 'everybody', 'everything', 'error', 'ways', 'lies', 'built', 'new', 'life', 'are', 'revealed', 'Melanie', 'really', 'good', 'girl', 'deep', 'down', 'heart', 'fact', 'confirmed', 'minds', 'fact', 'Jake', 'coon', 'dog', 'mom', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'disregard', 'histrionics', 'favor', 'sedate', 'total', 'acceptance', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Andrew', 'maniacal', 'mayor', 'mom', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'just', 'set', 'numbers', 'be', 'played', 'out', 'True', 'Andrew', 'not', 'deserve', 'fate', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'doomed', 'once', 'mother', 'read', 'poll', 'results', 'went', 'ahead', 'birth.Ultimately', 'film', 'down', 'revelation', 'Jake', 'secret', 'reason', 'never', 'got', 'divorce', 'Melanie', 'wanted', 'prove', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'one', 'hand', 'what', 'came', 'up', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'especially', 'given', 'premises', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'Melanie', 'discovery', 'Jake', 'secret', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'wonderful', 'moment', 'film', 'back', 'telling', 'rather', 'showing', 'Melanie', 'given', 'couple', 'big', 'clues', 'help', 'alone', 'better', 'way', 'doing', 'Remember', 'object', 'Jake', 'trailer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'place', 'instead', '.Witherspoon', 'fine', 'given', 'what', 'work', 'script', 'Lucas', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'shines', 'certainly', 'saying', 'something', 'given', 'co-star', 'who', 'definitely', 'blonde', 'jour', 'American', 'cinema', 'moment', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'mother', 'character', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'sign', 'most', 'movies', 'Lucas', 'up', 'being', 'lynchpin', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'shudder', 'think', 'how', 'low', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'sunk', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'grounding', 'film', 'little', 'once', 'future', 'happy', 'couple', 'group', 'friends', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'are', 'wasted', 'Melanie', 'parents', 'doublewide', 'trailer', 'home', 'end', 'get', 'feeling', 'as', 'soon', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'signed', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'star', 'film', 'stopped', 'working', 'script', 'started', 'counting', 'profits']",N/A

Saying that it's a favorite of mine is actually saying a lot considering I am typically NOT a fan of romantic comedies!  I find them predictable, cheesy and they pretty much all have the same plot!  While this movie definitely is guilty of all of the above, its redeeming qualities make these things all but forgotten!Reese Witherspoon is the perfect actress to play the fun, lighthearted Melanie Carmichael; a fashion designer whose past she would prefer remains buried.  She has worked her way to the top and is finally in the perfect place in life.  She has a successful career and has met a new love played by Patrick Dempsy.  When he proposes to her in Tiffany's and he tells her to pick a ring, she feels her life is complete.  However, reality hits hard when she has to deal with her ex-husband (Josh Lucas) that she never technically divorced. A trip home brings up old memories and feelings she thought were long gone.  She is torn between the future she always hoped and dreamed for and the past that is tugging at her heartstrings. How will she ever choose?Witherspoon is adorable and feisty while Dempsy is dapper and suave with his classic good looks.  Lucas is sweet and humble with the boy next door look.  It's hard to know who to root for initially but one definitely swayed me in the end!  A great supporting cast including Candice Bergan as Dempsy's mom helped make this movie a hit!Directed by Andy Tennant with a fabulous cast and witty script, Sweet Home Alabama in my opinion will go down as one of the great romantic comedies of our time so I'm ecstatic to add this Tenth Anniverary Edition to my collection.",5,A Classic Romantic Comedy,1352332800,"11 8, 2012",2012,1779,"['Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'watch', 'again', 'amazing', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'Saying', 'favorite', 'mine', 'actually', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'am', 'typically', 'NOT', 'fan', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'find', 'predictable', 'cheesy', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'same', 'plot', 'movie', 'definitely', 'guilty', 'above', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'make', 'things', 'forgotten', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'perfect', 'actress', 'play', 'fun', 'lighthearted', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'fashion', 'designer', 'would', 'prefer', 'remains', 'buried', 'worked', 'way', 'top', 'finally', 'perfect', 'place', 'life', 'successful', 'career', 'met', 'new', 'love', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Dempsy', 'When', 'Tiffany', 'pick', 'ring', 'life', 'complete', 'However', 'reality', 'hits', 'hard', 'when', 'deal', 'ex-husband', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'never', 'technically', 'divorced', 'trip', 'home', 'up', 'old', 'memories', 'feelings', 'thought', 'were', 'long', 'gone', 'torn', 'future', 'always', 'hoped', 'dreamed', 'past', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'How', 'will', 'ever', 'choose', 'Witherspoon', 'adorable', 'feisty', 'Dempsy', 'dapper', 'suave', 'classic', 'good', 'looks', 'Lucas', 'sweet', 'humble', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'look', 'hard', 'know', 'who', 'root', 'initially', 'one', 'definitely', 'swayed', 'end', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Candice', 'Bergan', 'Dempsy', 'mom', 'helped', 'make', 'movie', 'hit', 'Directed', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'fabulous', 'cast', 'witty', 'script', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'opinion', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'time', ""'m"", 'ecstatic', 'add', 'Tenth', 'Anniverary', 'Edition', 'collection']",N/A

""Legally Blonde"" is one of my favorite movies, and I believe a truly great one.  But ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" while it had so much promise, just was not a good vehicle for her sweetness and contagious optimistic nature.The story has all the ingredients for a great romantic comedy: a Southern girl leaves her roots and goes to New York City where she makes a name for herself and meets a rich, gorgeous, young hunk.  But her past comes back to haunt her, including her first love.OK, sounds good.  But first, this character, Melanie Carmichael, keeps hurting people in terrible ways.  But she is supposed to be so irresistible that everyone keeps forgiving her.  If I had a dime for everytime someone is humiliated by her, and forgives her when she bats her baby blues and says, ""I'm sorry,"" I would be as rich as her fiancee, who misplaces his Irish accent from between when we are introduced to him and when we see him again.  Melanie has a husband in Alabama, Jake, (Josh Lucas), who has waited for her like a faithful coon dog for SEVEN YEARS while she is screwing another man in New York.  In seven years, he could have mastered Buddhist monasticism.  She blows up a cat with dynamite because it has cancer and she thinks that blowing it up would be more humane??? Excuse me?  She outs her friend, telling everyone he is gay.  And there is a sappy scene where she is sniffling at the grave of her old coon dog that she walked out on, saying of course, ""I'm sorry.""  There is more, but that would spoil the end of the movie.The film's plausibility barely holds together.  The pride of the South and Southern heritage is a good point of the film, however.  The Civil War battlefields and  re-enactments, and the beautiful plantation homes make the film more interesting and real.Candice Bergnen is good as the Mayor of New York City, Melanie's mother-in-law to be.  Mary Kay Place as Melanie's mother, Pearl Smooter, is the best actor in the film.  She is so good she is out of place.  Fred Ward as Earl Smooter, Melanie's dad, sure transforms himself from couch potato to dashing Civil War captain.  I liked that touch.  The only really funny guy is someone whose name I cannot find in any credits anywhere.  He was the African-American, gay man.  His facial expressions and timing are hilarious.Another bright spot is the song by Shedaisy, ""Mine.""  It really made me sit up as the end credits were rolling to a close.  And a extra in the DVD is Shedaisy's music video of ""Mine.""

""Election"", ""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Legally Blonde"" all gave her an opportunity to showcase her skills in completely different types of roles.  Here, she plays the character that used to be cast with Julia Roberts....but like Roberts, she needs to distinguish between the script and director (think ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" vs. ""America's Sweethearts"") and make sure she keeps accepting parts where the director/script  will be able to bring out either the Grace Kelly side of her or the ditzy Goldie Hawn-type role she's been successful with.The director of ""Sweet Home Alabama"", Andy Tennant, is a true romantic.  ""Ever After"", the Drew Barrymore vehicle in 1998 was a visually stunning recreation of a classic fairytale with modern characters in princely clothing.  One of my favorites!  ""Anna and the King"" was a ""shouldabeen"" film; costumes again with the romance that should have surfaced between talented Jodie Foster (who doesn't do romance very well) and a smoldering Chow Yun Fat.  That it failed to do so was perhaps due to Tennant's ability to capture the visuals needed for such a film, while failing at finding the emotional depth and chemistry between characters that makes a romantic film succeed.Script-wise, Tennant doesn't have much to work with - country girl goes to the city and is a big success, finds a handsome and rich man to marry, then has to go back to the country to shake loose of her roots, notably another love.  Cast-wise, he was given the moon.  As Melanie, Reese Witherspoon succeeds at the part of her role that has her a successful designer in the big apple, the shining light of Andrew's (Patrick Dempsey's) future and the bane of his politician mother's (Candice Bergen's) aspirations for her boy.She's less believable as the original Alabama girl - gone home to put an end to a secret marriage to Jake Perry (Josh Lucas), the schism she's planned doesn't go as planned, and she starts to remember what her Alabama life and love were all about.  A triangle, with Reese in the middle, ought to be every director's dream.  It doesn't quite play out that way.  Reese is beautiful, but her character has little of the ditzyness and sweetness that might have made her more believable as an Alabama girl.  Both Dempsey and Lucas are believable, but have little material with which to help the viewer decide who to root for!  Bergen's character is far too sarcastic, and supporting roles from film gems Mary Kay Place, Fred Ward and Jean Smart, intelligent actors all, turn into bit parts instead of contributing to the feeling of the film, and the reasons for Melanie to make the decision she finally reaches.An attractive film that will continue the elevation of the the career of the delightful Reese, but one that could have been far better in the hands of a better director.Worth a watch, but you may want to wait for video.",3,America is in love with Reese Witherspoon.....,1035849600,"10 29, 2002",2002,2929,"['Reese', 'made', 'better', 'choices', 'material', 'past', 'Election', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'Legally', 'Blonde', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'showcase', 'skills', 'completely', 'different', 'types', 'roles', 'Here', 'character', 'used', 'be', 'cast', 'Julia', 'Roberts', '.but', 'Roberts', 'distinguish', 'script', 'director', 'think', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'America', 'Sweethearts', 'make', 'sure', 'accepting', 'parts', 'where', 'director/script', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'out', 'Grace', 'Kelly', 'side', 'ditzy', 'Goldie', 'Hawn-type', 'role', 'been', 'successful', 'with.The', 'director', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'true', 'romantic', 'Ever', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'vehicle', '1998', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'recreation', 'classic', 'fairytale', 'modern', 'characters', 'princely', 'clothing', 'One', 'favorites', 'Anna', 'King', 'was', 'shouldabeen', 'film', 'costumes', 'again', 'romance', 'should', 'have', 'surfaced', 'talented', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'romance', 'very', 'well', 'smoldering', 'Chow', 'Yun', 'Fat', 'failed', 'do', 'so', 'was', 'perhaps', 'due', 'Tennant', 'ability', 'capture', 'visuals', 'needed', 'such', 'film', 'failing', 'finding', 'emotional', 'depth', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'romantic', 'film', 'succeed.Script-wise', 'Tennant', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'work', 'country', 'girl', 'city', 'big', 'success', 'handsome', 'rich', 'man', 'marry', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'country', 'shake', 'loose', 'roots', 'notably', 'love', 'Cast-wise', 'was', 'given', 'moon', 'Melanie', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'part', 'role', 'successful', 'designer', 'big', 'apple', 'shining', 'light', 'Andrew', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'future', 'bane', 'politician', 'mother', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'aspirations', 'boy.She', 'less', 'believable', 'original', 'Alabama', 'girl', 'gone', 'home', 'put', 'end', 'secret', 'marriage', 'Jake', 'Perry', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'schism', 'planned', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'remember', 'what', 'Alabama', 'life', 'love', 'were', 'about', 'triangle', 'Reese', 'middle', 'ought', 'be', 'director', 'dream', ""n't"", 'quite', 'play', 'out', 'way', 'Reese', 'beautiful', 'character', 'little', 'ditzyness', 'sweetness', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'Alabama', 'girl', 'Dempsey', 'Lucas', 'are', 'believable', 'have', 'little', 'material', 'help', 'viewer', 'decide', 'who', 'root', 'Bergen', 'character', 'far', 'too', 'sarcastic', 'supporting', 'roles', 'film', 'gems', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'intelligent', 'actors', 'turn', 'bit', 'parts', 'instead', 'contributing', 'feeling', 'film', 'reasons', 'Melanie', 'make', 'decision', 'finally', 'reaches.An', 'attractive', 'film', 'will', 'continue', 'elevation', 'career', 'delightful', 'Reese', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'better', 'hands', 'better', 'director.Worth', 'watch', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'video']",N/A

What I really liked about this movie in a whole is the slow realization that one must be honest in one's life to really achieve happiness with one's self and others around them.

Reese Witherspoon lights up the screen once again in this otherwise bland tale of a New York City fashion designer who is faced with her past as she sifts her way through the present. Patrick Dempsey is in top form here as her rich fiancee, Candice Bergen is once again wickedly delightful as his overbearing mother, Ethan Embry is great as Melanie's childhood friend, and Josh Lucas is absolutely charming (and sexy) as her husband, who refuses to give Melanie a divorce. With such a great cast and such wonderful performances, it's hard to see how the film went wrong. Perhaps because it was overlong and boring, and the script lacked any sort of charm. Aside from the fact that it was (knowingly) predictable, I didn't find myself caring for the situation Melanie was in, or what its outcome was going to be. (as if it wasn't obvious). The film seemed to struggle with where to go once Melanie enters Alabama, something that was stretched out farther than it should have. Of course, the last 15 minutes or so brought back the magic of the first 15, ending on a sweet note. Perhaps if the film had been 15 minutes shorter, the lack of a good 2nd act wouldn't have been quite as obvious. The first-rate cast does save the film, bringing in the charm missing from the script.

It&#65533;s so predictable that even the movie&#65533;s tagline &#65533; &#65533;Sometimes what you are looking for is right where you left it.&#65533; &#65533; gives the plot away. Still, there is the comfortably predictable and the annoyingly predictable, and this one is in the comfortable category.Much of the credit belongs to its star, Reese Witherspoon. Like Julia Roberts [and many years ago, the young Katherine Hepburn], she has finely-honed comedic timing and isn&#65533;t afraid to be laughably obnoxious when need be. Her flaws are almost as endearing as her charms. When this movie was released theatrically, some critics noted that her character is sometimes a little bitchy and cruel. I agree, but I think that&#65533;s how it should be. Her Melanie is no Pollyanna. She&#65533;s a smart, willful, self-possessed young woman.The story begins in New York, where Melanie is living the high life. She&#65533;s a fashion designer whose first big collection is being shown. She&#65533;s also dating Andrew [Patrick Dempsey], whose mom [Candice Bergan] happens to be Mayor of New York. One night he proposes to her in Tiffany&#65533;s, which he has rented for the occasion. There&#65533;s just one problem: Melanie is still married to Jake [Josh Lucas], who has refused for several years to sign their divorce papers. She is forced to return to her small hometown in Alabama to try to make Jake see reason. Once there, she discovers that some of the values and people she left behind have more meaning than she once thought they did.The depictions of both New York and Alabama life are stereotypical, but good-naturedly so. The point of a movie like this is to entertain, not to educate. &#65533;Sweet Home Alabama&#65533; does this reasonably well, although, without a star like Witherspoon and such a strong supporting cast, it would have been a disaster because its done-a-hundred-times- before plot and relatively weak writing would have been glaringly apparent.",3,Witherspoon shines in formula comedy,1044748800,"02 9, 2003",2003,2035,"['65533', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', '65533', 'innocuous', 'comedy', '65533', 's', 'so', 'predictable', 'even', 'movie', '65533', 's', 'tagline', '65533', '65533', 'Sometimes', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'right', 'where', 'left', 'it.', '65533', '65533', 'plot', 'away', 'Still', 'comfortably', 'predictable', 'annoyingly', 'predictable', 'one', 'comfortable', 'category.Much', 'credit', 'belongs', 'star', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Julia', 'Roberts', '[', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'young', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', ']', 'finely-honed', 'comedic', 'timing', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'afraid', 'be', 'laughably', 'obnoxious', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'flaws', 'are', 'almost', 'as', 'endearing', 'charms', 'When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'critics', 'noted', 'character', 'sometimes', 'little', 'bitchy', 'cruel', 'agree', 'think', '65533', 's', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'Melanie', 'Pollyanna', '65533', 's', 'smart', 'willful', 'self-possessed', 'young', 'woman.The', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'Melanie', 'living', 'high', 'life', '65533', 's', 'fashion', 'designer', 'first', 'big', 'collection', 'being', 'shown', '65533', 's', 'also', 'dating', 'Andrew', '[', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', ']', 'mom', '[', 'Candice', 'Bergan', ']', 'be', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'One', 'night', 'Tiffany', '65533', 's', 'rented', 'occasion', '65533', 's', 'just', 'one', 'problem', 'Melanie', 'still', 'married', 'Jake', '[', 'Josh', 'Lucas', ']', 'who', 'refused', 'several', 'years', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'forced', 'return', 'small', 'hometown', 'Alabama', 'try', 'make', 'Jake', 'see', 'reason', 'Once', 'there', 'values', 'people', 'left', 'behind', 'have', 'more', 'meaning', 'once', 'thought', 'did.The', 'depictions', 'New', 'York', 'Alabama', 'life', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'good-naturedly', 'so', 'point', 'movie', 'entertain', 'not', 'educate', '65533', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', '65533', 'reasonably', 'well', 'star', 'Witherspoon', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'disaster', 'done-a-hundred-times-', 'plot', 'relatively', 'weak', 'writing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'glaringly', 'apparent']",N/A

Until about half an hour before the end, when I started flicking through a magazine I was that bored. The finale drags out way more than it ever should have been. You know what the ending's going to be, you just wish it would hurry up & get there!Apart from that, the actual song ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is well, and overly, used during this movie. Reese Witherspoon's hair is SOOOOOOO much better in this, than that stiff, godawful wig she insisted on wearing during both Legally Blondes, and it really suits her. And imagine having a mother-in-law like Candice Bergen, playing a similar character to the one she played in Miss Congeniality.When Melanie is chasing Andrew through the crowd of people watching the reenactment, she trips over the dolly track. The first movie to be allowed to shoot in New York after the 11 September 2001 attacks.Charlize Theron was originally cast as Melanie Carmichael, but due to the actor's strike, she jumped to a ready-to-go movie Trapped. Reese was cast the same weekend that Legally Blonde opened.An entire character (along with a subplot about her) was deleted from the film, when test audiences consistently misunderstood her relationship with Andrew. Erin Vanderbilt (played by Katharine Towne) survives in the finished movie only in a newspaper wedding announcement shown to Melanie during the closing credits.The ending of the movie was re-written and re-shot after test audiences found the original version to be horrifying rather than funny. In the original ending Melanie and Jake are struck by lightning as they're kissing on the beach (bringing the story full-circle, as it originally started off with a very young Jake and Melanie kissing before struck by lightning). Later we see Jake carrying an apparently dead Melanie into the tent where the ""reception"" is taking place. As everyone gasps in shock and dismay, Jake says ""Melanie Charmichael is dead,"" pauses several seconds for effect, then says ""long live Felony Melanie,"" at which point Melanie pops up to the assembled crowd's delight and relief. (Watch out for a young Dakota Fanning as the young Melanie - is it just me or is this girl in everything at the moment? If she doesn't be careful, she's going to be a burnt out recluse by the time she's a teen, like some other child stars.)This is an OK movie. The runup to the ending pretty much ruins the rest of the movie, so go and make yourself a cup of tea, put the cat out, and do some dishes while this bit is on.

Without question, especially after her success in ""Legally Blond"" and now ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" Witherspoon is now a Star. She is a potent mixture of intelligence, ditzy-ness and sensuality and uses these traits to elevate the story and direction of ""SHA"" into a sweet and warm-hearted success.Witherspoon plays Melanie Carmichael, a NYC fashion designer who must go home to Alabama to seek a quickie divorce from her first husband (Josh Lucas) after being proposed to by her boyfriend, a politician (Patrick Dempsey).All manner of circumstance ensues that prevent Melanie from leaving Alabama immediately and therein lays the conflict that propels the movie forward.There are some good performances, really cameos from Fred Ward, May Kay Place, Candice Bergen and Jean Smart. Josh Lucas finally graduates from the smarmy, greasy roles he played in ""Dead Calm"" and ""Session 9"" but he brings a bit of baggage from those films to his role here that adds resonance to what is basically a reactive rather than active role.But don't fool yourself; this movie is all about Reese, Reese, Reese.

Bergen chews up the scenery with her accustomed gusto and flair.  Now, as far as the movie goes, it's the cast and particularly Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon that elevates this film.  Reese plays an up and coming fashion designer who gets engaged to the mayor's son (an effective Patrick Dempsey) but first has to get divorced from the husband no one in her new life knows about (Josh Lucas playing his usual Josh Lucas he-man roles).  Reese has been trying for 7 years to get hubby Jake to sign the divorce papers but she has to back to sweet home Alabama to convince him to let her free so she can marry handsome Andrew.  Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place are fine as Reese's down to earth parents; Ethan Embry is effective as an old friend with secrets; and Jean Smart is present as Lucas' mama.

It's one of those films where you know the ending before the movie even starts, and after seeing the trailer I honestly didn't have high expectations. But I was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw it. It's sassy and fun I really enjoyed it.Southern-girl-turned-New-York-fashion-designer Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) receives a marriage proposal from her well-to-do boyfriend Andrew Hennings (Patrick Dempsey) and life couldn't be better. The catch? She's still married to high school sweetheart Jake Perry (Josh Lucas) whom she left behind in Alabama seven years ago, when a disastrous young pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage left her feeling that she needed a fresh start. So before the wedding, Melanie needs to go back home and convince her hubby to sign the divorce papers. Now, we know right off the bat that the old flame is going to be rekindled and she'll end up re-evaluating her life and what she left behind. The unavoidable conclusion just stares you in the face from the get go. But the fun part is watching how she arrives at her destination.Yes, it's choc full of stereotypes about New Yorkers and Southerners alike, but it isn't malicious. Just about any movie is going to have its stereotypes, whether people pick up on them or not, and this movie is pretty harmless by comparison. Do the accents sound fake? I guess it depends on where in the South you're from or have been. I've seen both positive and negative critiques from true Southerners. I was born and raised in Alaska, so my ear is hardly fine-tuned (the closest I've come to Alabama is a summer spent in Kentucky), but it sounds natural enough to me. Witherspoon and Lucas are themselves from Louisiana and Arkansas respectively, so I think they'd know what they're doing.The whole cast is wonderful. Witherspoon absolutely shines, and despite Jake's description of Melanie as a ""hoity-toity Yankee b*tch,"" I can't help but like her. She's got character. Josh Lucas just nails his role as Jake. He's charming, he's funny, he's a big greasy teddy bear. Patrick Dempsey is also outstanding as Andrew, whom I really did feel sorry for. Unlike so many love triangle films, where one of the guys is a scoundrel in disguise (i.e. Bridget Jones's Diary, etc.), Andrew is a kind, loving, devoted man. The only thing Jake's got that he doesn't is spunk - Andrew's a little straight-laced and droll. Great performances are also given by Ethan Embry (you can't help but love Bobby Ray!), Candice Bergen, Mary Kay Place, and Fred Ward.So don't expect anything too deep and thought-provoking. It's a ""chick flick"" after all (though I know guys who've enjoyed it, too). But if you're in the mood for a sweet romantic comedy, this movie is worth seeing. Not everyone's going to like it (as is the case with most movies), so rent before you buy, but do give it a shot.",4,"Entirely predictable, but c'mon - it's cute!",1071619200,"12 17, 2003",2003,2935,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'completely', 'original', 'groundbreaking', 'ai', ""n't"", 'one', 'films', 'where', 'know', 'ending', 'movie', 'even', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'actually', 'saw', 'sassy', 'fun', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.Southern-girl-turned-New-York-fashion-designer', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'well-to-do', 'boyfriend', 'Andrew', 'Hennings', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'catch', 'still', 'married', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Jake', 'Perry', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'whom', 'left', 'behind', 'Alabama', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'disastrous', 'young', 'pregnancy', 'subsequent', 'miscarriage', 'left', 'feeling', 'needed', 'fresh', 'start', 'So', 'wedding', 'Melanie', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'convince', 'hubby', 'sign', 'divorce', 'papers', 'Now', 'know', 'right', 'bat', 'old', 'flame', 'going', 'be', 'rekindled', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 're-evaluating', 'life', 'what', 'left', 'behind', 'unavoidable', 'conclusion', 'just', 'face', 'get', 'go', 'fun', 'part', 'watching', 'how', 'destination.Yes', 'choc', 'full', 'stereotypes', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Southerners', 'alike', ""n't"", 'malicious', 'Just', 'movie', 'going', 'have', 'stereotypes', 'people', 'pick', 'up', 'not', 'movie', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'comparison', 'Do', 'accents', 'sound', 'fake', 'guess', 'where', 'South', ""'re"", 'have', 'been', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'positive', 'negative', 'critiques', 'true', 'Southerners', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Alaska', 'ear', 'hardly', 'fine-tuned', 'closest', ""'ve"", 'come', 'Alabama', 'summer', 'spent', 'Kentucky', 'natural', 'enough', 'Witherspoon', 'Lucas', 'are', 'Louisiana', 'Arkansas', 'respectively', 'think', ""'d"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'Witherspoon', 'absolutely', 'Jake', 'description', 'Melanie', 'hoity-toity', 'Yankee', 'b*tch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'got', 'character', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'just', 'role', 'Jake', 'charming', 'funny', 'big', 'greasy', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'also', 'outstanding', 'Andrew', 'whom', 'really', 'did', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'love', 'triangle', 'films', 'where', 'one', 'guys', 'scoundrel', 'disguise', 'i.e', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'etc', 'Andrew', 'kind', 'loving', 'devoted', 'man', 'only', 'thing', 'Jake', 'got', ""n't"", 'spunk', 'Andrew', 'little', 'straight-laced', 'droll', 'Great', 'performances', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'Bobby', 'Ray', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Fred', 'Ward.So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'too', 'deep', 'thought-provoking', 'chick', 'flick', 'know', 'guys', 'who', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'too', ""'re"", 'mood', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Not', 'everyone', 'going', 'like', 'case', 'most', 'movies', 'so', 'rent', 'buy', 'do', 'give', 'shot']",N/A

We get a lot of symbolism about fate and that kinda stuff as we see young Jake and Melanie as young children kissing each other.  Overall, the film is a nice story about finding one's self.  Once Melanie returns to town after being away for 7 years ""making something of herself in New York"" she goes on a voyage of self-discovery and reconnects with the friends, family and life she left behind and comes to realize a few things about herself.  Overall, it's a nice journey and some of the things she experiences along the way are both hilarious as well as heart-warming.THE DVD:Compared to most new release DVDs this film is a little sparse when it comes to extras but the things that are included do a nice job of enhancing the film.  Among the goodies offered here are:1. Director's commentary:  always an interesting listen2. 8 deleted scenes with director's commentary:  nice mixed bag of good scenes and ""ehhhh"" scenes3. Alternate ending with director's commentary:  Definitely not a great alternate ending4. ""Mine All Mine"" music video with the SheDaisysAll in all, the extras are nice if not blow away.THE VERDICT:Overall, this definitely makes a nice rental for you and your loved one to curl up on the couch with but nothing really major to write home about either though.Mildly Recommended",3,Gone Full Circle,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,1892,"['Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'tale', 'childhood', 'romance', 'gone', 'wrong', 'woman', 'search', 'herself.THE', 'STORY', 'When', 'New', 'York', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'boyfriend', 'Andrew', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Melanie', 'forced', 'fly', 'back', 'home', 'Alabama', 'take', 'care', 'loose', 'ends', 'namely', 'finally', 'getting', 'estranged', 'husband', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Jake', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'sign', 'off', 'divorce', 'papers', 'filed', 'seven', 'years', 'previously.THE', 'COOL', 'THINGS', 'Overall', 'romance', 'stories', 'go', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'stand', 'out', 'nice', 'get', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'fate', 'kinda', 'stuff', 'see', 'young', 'Jake', 'Melanie', 'young', 'children', 'kissing', 'other', 'Overall', 'film', 'nice', 'story', 'finding', 'one', 'self', 'Once', 'Melanie', 'returns', 'town', 'being', 'away', '7', 'years', 'making', 'something', 'herself', 'New', 'York', 'voyage', 'self-discovery', 'reconnects', 'friends', 'family', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'realize', 'few', 'things', 'Overall', 'nice', 'journey', 'things', 'way', 'are', 'hilarious', 'as', 'well', 'heart-warming.THE', 'DVD', 'Compared', 'most', 'new', 'release', 'DVDs', 'film', 'little', 'sparse', 'when', 'extras', 'things', 'are', 'included', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'enhancing', 'film', 'goodies', 'offered', 'here', 'are:1', 'Director', 'commentary', 'always', 'interesting', 'listen2', '8', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'director', 'commentary', 'nice', 'mixed', 'bag', 'good', 'scenes', 'ehhhh', 'scenes3', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'director', 'commentary', 'Definitely', 'not', 'great', 'alternate', 'ending4', 'Mine', 'Mine', 'music', 'video', 'SheDaisysAll', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'not', 'blow', 'away.THE', 'VERDICT', 'Overall', 'definitely', 'nice', 'rental', 'loved', 'one', 'curl', 'up', 'couch', 'nothing', 'really', 'major', 'write', 'home', 'though.Mildly', 'Recommended']",N/A

She lit up the screen in Legally Blonde. She doesn't disappoint in Sweet Home Alabama.Reese plays Melanie Carmichael, a big-time New York City fashion designer who is engaged to NY City's most eligible bachelor Andre Hennings, the son of Mayor Kate Hennings. The problem is, technically speaking, she is still married to her old high school boyfriend Jake who, for the past seven years, has continuously refused to sign the divorce papers. Melanie has to travel back to Pigeon Creek, Alabama and force him to sign the divorce papers. This forces her to confront her past and her demons in this small town. Melanie adopted a New York accent and dropped her Southern accent and changed her last name from Smooter to Carmichael. But as she is confronted with her old flame, and gets to know him more and more, she wonders whether it was the right decision to divorce him. It's kinda obvious who she chooses in the end between Jake and the most eligible bachelor in New York, as romantic comedic movies like these run into the same predictable pattern and Sweet Home is no exception.

I liked that she took a few risks and didn't make Melanie too nice - in fact, there were times I thought she was really obnoxious.The plot was paper thin, though, and it was pretty obvious from the get go who Mel would end up with. Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey were both pretty good, but Dempsey should've been in the movie more. I wanted more exploration of Mel's relationship with her parents, too. Mary Kay Place and Candice Bergen were wasted.This is a decent comedy that will give you a few good laughs, but once you leave the theatre you'll forget about it. I don't think you'll regret seeing it, though I wouldn't rush to the theatre.

727190,AP50P603W4BA7,B00007E2F5,"Ms. H. Sinton ""dragondrums""","[1, 1]","This romantic comedy perfectly suits Reese Witherspoon's style. In this film she plays Melanie Carmichael, an up and coming fashion designer who is about to marry Andrew, a politician and son of the New York mayor. What she hasn't told her future husband is that she hasn't actually divorced her previous spouse and she isn't really from a rich southern family.Cue the comedy as Mel returns to the small town in Alabama in order to get her ex to sign divorce papers. No longer part of the small community she left, the community that knew her as 'Felony Melanie', Mel finds herself somewhat out on a limb. She no longer has anything in common with her old friends and her conversations come across as snippy and snobbish.The main story revolves around the relationship between Mel and her ex and there are some real laugh alound moments between the two. Mels ex refuses to sign the papers while an increasingly frantic Mel is trying to keep her wedding on schedule. Things can only get worse when her fiance Andrew decides to turn up.As well as being a comedy this film also has some very poignant moments as Mel has to evaluate the person she has become and whether she in fact likes that person. This is a heart-warming and funny tale...not just a 'chick flick'. There are not a huge amount of extras on the DVD (region 2) but the disc is reasonable enough priced to overlook that.

727194,A1C7BWPATO40VA,B00007E2F5,Nathan T.,"[3, 5]","This movie probably deserves a higher star rating, but I dislike it so much I'm going to give it a 1 star. Watching this movie has made me feel so emotionally confused. I'll elaborate as best as I can.WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! SHOULD READ ONCE YOU'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE OR IF YOU DON'T CARE.The movie is about a young lady, Melanie, who becomes engaged to the major's son, Andrew, also known as the prince of New York. However, she wants to break the news to her parents by herself and wants to keep the marriage a secret, which doesn't happen due to the major finding out that her son got engaged (during the horde of reporters to add). Upon going back to Alabama, we find out that she is still married, the husband being the young boy in the very first beginning scene.Anyhow, this is why the movie is so darn confusing:1. There is a continuous shift in emotional connection with the viewer in terms of Jake Perry, the old husband she's trying to divorce. He appears first as a total D--k, refusing to sign the divorce papers. Then during the scene where he drives her back home after the bar scene half drunked, my views on him changed where I start to see a little bit more of the positive side, then the grave scene gave him some more credits towards the positive side. That's when the fianc&eacute;e comes to Alabama himself and upon meeting Jake, you almost got the impression that Jake would be delicate about Melanie's secret. Instead, he drives her fianc&eacute;e to where she was and announces that she loves keeping lies and pretending she's something that she's not, right in front of the guy, which causes them to fight. This scene made me want to strangle the character somewhat because it was a really messed up move that made him seem like a complete jeeerk. Then when she meets Jake at his glass store, which you find out towards the end and she does this on accident. Towards the end when she's almost married to Andrew, the movie tries to make you feel sympathy for the guy. Personally, I really thought Jake was a complete puuunk. He screws up his marriage, loses her, and the movie wants to make it seem like Melanie was the one that made the mistake. In the end, she dumps Andrew (an incredibly good guy that loves her and respects her) for Jake, who refuses to sign the divorce papers for over 7 years, causing her to chase him all around, begging???!?!?! Utterly frustrating movie to watch.2. Andrew is a nice guy, he was never shown to verbally, mentally, or physically abuse her in any shape and form. He is a calm and nice guy that is shown throughout the movie to love her regardless. Then in the end, Melanie chooses Jake the Jeeerk over him. Jake, the guy that never made anything of his life, the guy that refuses to sign the divorce papers even after she begged, plead, and followed him all around town, many times teasing her about signing the papers..... The movie continuously tries to make you feel some sympathy for Jake, but in all reality and all proof, how she chose him in the end over the obviously much better choice of Andrew is completely beyond me. Now, if Andrew if controlling and tells her to be what she is not, then we'd understand and pick Jake who knows her from childhood. However, Andrew is not like that and there's pretty much no negative points to him. He comforts her, he understands her, he defends her when his mom tries to insult her somehow. Andrew is great! He is the ideal man, so what the heck??? Andrew even pretends to be understanding at the end....3. In the end, the movie tries to make Andrew's mom seem like the bad villain. However, this is not justified. Sure the mom seems bad and tries to dig up dirt about Melanie throughout most of the movie, completely absorbed in politics, which is her main concern. However, towards the end, she really does seem to accept everything and even agreed to hold the wedding down in Alabama. She even arranges everything with Melanie. They seemed to be at peace with each other and suddenly, in the end, Melanie breaks up with Andrew. The mom reacts to it by calling them names (Melanie and her whole town). If I was Andrew's mother and a girl says she loves my son and everything has been arranged and my son has put his heart and soul into it and the girl calls it quits in the end, I'd react the same or worse! Andrew is an incredibly good person throughout the movie, to do that just speaks volume about Melanie's character.CONCLUSION: MELANIE (played by Reese Witherspoon) is an indecisive, unclear, horrible person. She continuously leads Andrew to think he is definitely the one and in the end, dumps him in front of EVERYONE. Andrew has done nothing to deserve that. He worked so hard to set up the wedding. Jake should stop going around this movie like an abandoned puppy. He failed to keep her interested and be a supportive spouse, he got his chance, sign the freaken divorce paper and stop acting like a total puunk.This is a horrific movie. I only watched it because I paid to watch it and I'm going to watch it! I thought I was going to see something warm and heart touching and nice....wow.P.S. The parents are lame as well, especially the Dad. Daughter asks them to come visit her and they don't ever come....hope they rot.

But, it's certainly been done to death and if you can't bring anything fresh and new to the concept, it's best to leave it alone. The producers of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" got lucky. They got Reese Witherspoon. Otherwise, this film would've been a disaster.The's film is so very predictable which, by itself, is not so bad. Charm can take you a long way. However, the charm ends with Witherspoon (OK, Mary Kay Place is great, too). This movie is being marketed as a comedy, yet it's major downfall is that it's just not very funny. Oh, it tries, but it relies on so many stereotypical jokes and situations that it just fails (the ""married your cousin"" joke is an especially egregious example). Since you know how the movie is going to end, there's no suspense and, since the jokes fall flat, there's nothing to keep you interested.Except for Reese. She is consistently good and doesn't fail here.  Her scene in a pet cemetary (it would take too long to explain, BELIEVE me!) is particularly good. She looks great and acquits herself very well. She just doesn't have much to work with.The rest of the supporting cast (Josh Lucas, Patrick Dempsey, Ethan Embry, Candice Bergen, Jean Smart, Melanie Lynsky and Fred Ward) are fine as far as their characters are allowed to go (Smart is sadly underused; Ward, Lynsky and Bergen are all stereotypes). The aforementioned Place is the only one who does anything with what she's given. What a waste.Finally, another stereotype stuck in my craw. There are two gay characters in the film who have a little ""moment"" toward the end of the film. Now, in real life, these two would not look at each other twice. Yet, the filmakers seem to think, as many do in ""real life"", that being gay is all you need to have in common to be ""friends"". Sadly, no. But, that's par for the course in a film that relies on those very stereotypes to get cheap laughs.

727207,A13DQTXG02HZC1,B00007E2F5,Ping Lim,"[1, 2]","As other reviews said, this movie is rather inoffensive.  Yes, the story line is predictable, &amp; that true love never dies.  The movie is built upon the Kennedy-ish premises, where Reese Witherspoon's character came from a shoddy background, hit the big time in the Big Apple as a fashion designer, met her Prince Charming in the guise of Patrick Dempsey (a clone version of late Kennedy Junior).  Before Reese's character was able to marry Patrick's character officially, she needed to divorce from her husband in Alabama.  Thus, she needed to go back to confront her past that she was so ashamed about.  After spending time there, she realised the things that mattered to her heart, her root.  Well, you can pretty much guess the rest of the storyline.  However, what made this DVD collection interesting is the subplot which is eliminated completely.  As the Director, Andy Tennant said himself, there are some deleted scenes which are his favourite.  So as not to confuse the viewers or so as not to have the main idea diluted too much, the subplot about this &quot;Erin&quot; character is eliminated completely.  I would rather have the Erin subplot in the whole movie to make it &quot;grayer&quot;, or projecting a more real life situation.  However, it's not meant to be.  There's also a music video of the theme song.  I find the movie enjoyable to watch.  For those that expect something challenging, forget it.  This is one of those few good movies that you can slouch in your couch &amp; having a good laugh &amp; good cry in.  Highly recommended.

Not bad for a comedy that isn't funny.  With a premise full of laugh-out-loud potential and a very talented lead actress, this should have been a hoot - and an opportunity to do something different with romantic comedy.  What we get instead is a thoroughly conventional bore.  That Melanie didn't sign the divorce papers is supposed to show she ""unconsciously"" wanted to be with Jake all along, and it was only a matter time before her head caught up with her heart.  How sweet.  How convenient, too, that in the meantime Jake's also become independently wealthy, opened a creative business, and bought his own plane - because those electric-blue eyes apparently aren't enough, even if he is her soulmate.  Things only really catch fire during a bar scene where Melanie manages to insult all of her old school friends and `out' the local closet case - but then he's immediately embraced by the townies with the open-hearted liberalism for which Southerners are renowned.  Witherspoon makes the most of it, and Josh Lucas is good enough, but Candice Bergen is truly a breath of fresh air - pity she gets about three minutes on screen.  The only thing that really stays with you is the gratingly invasive title track which will be rocking around your head for days, like a serious hangover you just can't shake.

Little Melanie (Reese Witherspoon) has New York at her feet as This Year's Now fashion designer and the maraschino cherry atop the sundae is a proposal from the suave son (Patrick Dempsey) of the Mayor of New York City (Candice Bergen).  Before the cup can runneth over, Melanie must clear up some loose ends down home in Alabama, namely getting a divorce from her good ole boy husband (Josh Lucas) who she married as a teenager.  Melanie blows into Sweet Home after seven years and is going to get the matter taken care of in a day or so, and then jet back to the City.I'd like to respectfully disagree that Miss Witherspoon ""carries"" the picture.  There is something not entirely charming about a spoiled brat who expects to get the best out any world she happens to occupy.  We needed to see a little more of the charmer and less of the vixen to have a happy ride through the movie.  Mary Kay Place, as Melanie's mom, gives an excellent supporting performance of surprising depth given the light content of the script.  Josh Lucas, as Jake is disarming, funny and appealing.  So much so, I had a hard time understanding why he was so determined to hang on to Melanie. A very nice and perceptive performance by Lurlynn (Melanie Lynsky) who is the old girl friend who stayed home and raised babies, and shows more maturity in a glance than RW displays in the whole movie. A very special mention to Mary Lynn Rajskub (Dorothea) in the best comedic bit in the movie as the bank teller who had lost 100 lbs. and was ready to compete!There were many opportunities to sharpen up and improve the movie.  I would have liked to see an edgier, super chic New Yorker group for contrast, particularly in the fashion department.  Melanie abandoned every grain of sense she ever possessed about fashion when she hit Alabama.  Cowboy boots with Laura Ashley style sun dresses? She spent most of the time with a coiffure that made her look like Meg Ryan on a bad hair day.  Hey, the Deep South is a place where Big Hair is not only celebrated, but embraced.

A Southern Belle at heart, she seeks out her redneck husband Jake, a high school sweetheart played by Josh Lucas, so she may divorce him and marry the mayor of NY City's son.  As she rediscovers her past, she rediscovers herself, learning you can take the girl out of the South, but you can never take the South out of the girl.The ReviewHome is where the heart is and Sweet Home Alabama is definitely all heart.  Yes this is generic mush - but it is good mush, and besides we all need to get in touch with our feelings occasionally.  Ok I'm not cracking up and yes that really was a speck of dust I had in my eye when I was watching the film - honest!So what makes this romantic comedy stand out above the rest:  well for starters it's a well written story about finding ones true love, and no matter how hard the world has made us, at heart we all share that common desire.  Reese Witherspoon plays her role with beautiful eclecticism mixing her home-grown roots and New York adopted attitude in an explosion of sass.  Her clashes with Lucas provide both some quality comic moments and genuine tenderness.  Lucas is the real man of every girl's dreams; with his Nicholas Cage sly smile, he exudes a gruff masculinity that is just waiting to be cared for by his perfect match.Now I'll stop there before I make myself puke, or have to over compensate, reinforcing my status as a man by watching video nasties and drinking beer.  Ok, all jokes aside, Andy Tennant who previously brought us Anna &amp; the King, has done well in making what is a competent but highly unoriginal piece of movie making.  This is generic fair at its best and that's what has limited it to just a three star rating as it has become a victim of its own conventions.  The tag line to the film tells us ""sometimes what you're looking for is right where you left it"" and while that sums up the narrative, its also relevant to how I feel about this film - There's something nice about the familiar, we know where this one is going and if your happy to let it take you for a cruise controlled drive there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy Sweet Home Alabama.The VerdictIf you love romantic comedies then go and see it, its as strong as Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail but this isn't As Good as it Gets.",3,GOOD 'OL AMERICANA,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,2405,"['BriefHigh-flying', 'New', 'York', 'based', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Melanie', 'played', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'home', 'confront', 'past', 'Southern', 'Belle', 'heart', 'out', 'redneck', 'husband', 'Jake', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'played', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'may', 'divorce', 'marry', 'mayor', 'NY', 'City', 'son', 'past', 'learning', 'can', 'take', 'girl', 'South', 'can', 'never', 'take', 'South', 'girl.The', 'ReviewHome', 'where', 'heart', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'definitely', 'heart', 'Yes', 'generic', 'mush', 'good', 'mush', 'need', 'get', 'touch', 'feelings', 'occasionally', ""'m"", 'not', 'cracking', 'up', 'yes', 'really', 'was', 'speck', 'dust', 'had', 'eye', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'honest', 'what', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stand', 'out', 'rest', 'well', 'starters', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'finding', 'ones', 'true', 'love', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'world', 'made', 'heart', 'share', 'common', 'desire', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'role', 'beautiful', 'eclecticism', 'mixing', 'home-grown', 'roots', 'New', 'York', 'adopted', 'attitude', 'explosion', 'sass', 'clashes', 'Lucas', 'provide', 'quality', 'comic', 'moments', 'genuine', 'tenderness', 'Lucas', 'real', 'man', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'sly', 'smile', 'gruff', 'masculinity', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'cared', 'perfect', 'match.Now', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'make', 'puke', 'have', 'over', 'compensate', 'reinforcing', 'status', 'man', 'watching', 'video', 'nasties', 'drinking', 'beer', 'Ok', 'jokes', 'aside', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'who', 'previously', 'brought', 'Anna', 'amp', 'King', 'done', 'well', 'making', 'what', 'competent', 'highly', 'unoriginal', 'piece', 'movie', 'making', 'generic', 'fair', 'best', 'what', 'limited', 'just', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'become', 'victim', 'own', 'conventions', 'tag', 'line', 'film', 'sometimes', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'right', 'where', 'left', 'up', 'narrative', 'also', 'relevant', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'something', 'nice', 'familiar', 'know', 'where', 'one', 'going', 'happy', 'let', 'take', 'cruise', 'controlled', 'drive', 'reason', 'should', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama.The', 'VerdictIf', 'love', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'then', 'go', 'see', 'as', 'strong', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', ""n't"", 'As', 'Good']",N/A

However, the movie itself is far too unpromising in both the screenplay and the actors performance. Witherspoon is the leading role in the movie playing a girl who gained a career success in NY but need to go back to Alabama to settled a marriage that she deemed should not have happened so that she could get hold of her new love and fairy tale marriage. The first half of the movie went well until the moment she arrived Alabama. From that part onward, the plot just like fell apart. The director introduced quite a number of new characters as Witherspoon's old acquaintances and friends back home, but most of them were lack of depth in character. The part of Witherspoon trying to take revenge on her ex in refusing to sign the papers by taking advantage of the joint bank account is funny, but other than that the description between their relationship is shallow and inconvincing.

It is well acted by a first rate cast.Reese Witherspoon is Melanie Carmichael, a New York fashion designer who appears to be on top of the world when she receives rave reviews for her new clothing line and the becomes engaged to Andrew (Patrick Dempsey), HUD secretary and son of the Mayor of NYC (Candice Bergen). Only one small problem looms on the horizon - her past - including a teenage marriage to Jake (Josh Lucas), from whom she has never been divorced due to his refusal to sign the final decree. Thus, a trip back home to Alabama ensues in an effort to clear things up before Andrew and Murphy Brown, I mean Candice Bergen acting to comic perfection as she did in that role, dredge up the truth and she loses her chance at happiness in the big city.Needless to say, things don't quite go according to plan. Jake isn't ready to let go of his childhood sweetheart, and she starts to renew some old high school friendships after her seven year absence. This is not just a fluffy vehicle for Reese Witherspoon's talents; as the story of the past unfolds the movie  even touches on such issues as high school pregnancies, the outing of a gay friend, the role that the history of the Confederacy still plays in the Deep South and parents fulfilling their dreams through the achievements of their children.In addition to the previously mentioned actors and actresses, Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place as Melanie's parents and Jean Smart as Jake's mom add both depth and humor to the movie. And perhaps best of all the country music soundtrack complements the action and Bryan the bloodhound almost steals the show for us dog lovers who only wish that the crucial role he plays was a little more extensive.In the end, this movie keeps you both laughing and guessing while affirmatively answering Jake's question to Melanie about whether we can have both roots and wings.",5,Who Does Melanie Really Love ?,1033862400,"10 6, 2002",2002,1980,"['wonderful', 'heartwarming', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'truly', 'funny', 'one', 'liners', 'interspersed', 'tender', 'moments', 'well', 'acted', 'first', 'rate', 'cast.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Melanie', 'Carmichael', 'New', 'York', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'be', 'top', 'world', 'when', 'rave', 'reviews', 'new', 'clothing', 'line', 'becomes', 'engaged', 'Andrew', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'HUD', 'secretary', 'son', 'Mayor', 'NYC', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Only', 'one', 'small', 'problem', 'horizon', 'past', 'including', 'teenage', 'marriage', 'Jake', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'whom', 'never', 'been', 'divorced', 'due', 'refusal', 'sign', 'final', 'decree', 'Thus', 'trip', 'back', 'home', 'Alabama', 'ensues', 'effort', 'clear', 'things', 'up', 'Andrew', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'mean', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'acting', 'comic', 'perfection', 'did', 'role', 'dredge', 'up', 'truth', 'chance', 'happiness', 'big', 'city.Needless', 'say', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'go', 'according', 'plan', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'ready', 'let', 'go', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'renew', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'friendships', 'seven', 'year', 'absence', 'not', 'just', 'fluffy', 'vehicle', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'talents', 'story', 'past', 'movie', 'even', 'touches', 'such', 'issues', 'high', 'school', 'pregnancies', 'outing', 'gay', 'friend', 'role', 'history', 'Confederacy', 'still', 'Deep', 'South', 'parents', 'fulfilling', 'dreams', 'achievements', 'children.In', 'addition', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Fred', 'Ward', 'Mary', 'Kay', 'Place', 'Melanie', 'parents', 'Jean', 'Smart', 'Jake', 'mom', 'add', 'depth', 'humor', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'best', 'country', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'action', 'Bryan', 'bloodhound', 'almost', 'show', 'dog', 'lovers', 'who', 'only', 'crucial', 'role', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'end', 'movie', 'laughing', 'guessing', 'affirmatively', 'answering', 'Jake', 'question', 'Melanie', 'can', 'have', 'roots', 'wings']",N/A
