1406601,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B004G8QO6Q,Carter,"[5, 5]","There's an old axiom that seldom are individuals all good or all bad.  But if people are generally a little of both, how do we know if they are one or the other?  Mordecai Richler introduces us to a protagonist with a big heart as well as equally big warts and poses this question: Is he a good man or not?  Though most people have good intentions, we don't live with people deep down in their souls where their good intentions lie.  We live with them in the real world, with the choices they make, and the consequences of those choices--generally approaching another's character by way of his choices and actions.  Barney's Version is, foremost, a beautiful piece of art but also a film that presents us with a dilemma to just that approach.  In the first instance, it's a gorgeous film--visually sumptuous, luminous characters, rich in story and emotional authenticity, and laden with golden performances, especially from Giamatti, who's established himself as a dean of American performing arts.  No explosions, no hardware, no ILM special effects--just a movie so sensuously textured you feel as though it reaches out from the screen and wraps you in a sheet of silk.  In the second instance, we see people suffer the choices Barney Panofsky makes.  But Barney is far too multi-dimensional for us, or the people in his life, to write off his moral character so easily.  The elements of his story--the vicissitudes of an ordinary man's life; his delicate relationships with wife, father, and friends; his pleasures and pains; his desires and dreads--might have come to be seen as too ordinary, too unremarkable.  The triumph of this film is that if deftly assembles all the components of remarkable cinema to compel us to see the extraordinary in an ordinary man's--even a flawed man's--life.  And it is with this imperfect and complex individual that Richler and Konyves put forth their question and partially answer it.  Sometimes--and it's not quite clear when--the character of someone with seemingly insurmountable personal defects can't be completely defined by the sum total of his bad choices.  It's not a finite answer, and each viewer is left to reach his own conclusion.  But in presenting us with that challenge and this wonder-filled story, Barney's Version is masterful and, like all great art, rises well above the question it originally poses.",5,Rises Well Above The Question It Poses,1360281600,"02 8, 2013",2013,2362,"['old', 'axiom', 'seldom', 'are', 'individuals', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'are', 'generally', 'little', 'how', 'do', 'know', 'are', 'one', 'other', 'Mordecai', 'Richler', 'protagonist', 'big', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'equally', 'big', 'warts', 'question', 'good', 'man', 'not', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'people', 'deep', 'down', 'souls', 'where', 'good', 'intentions', 'lie', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'choices', 'make', 'consequences', 'choices', 'generally', 'approaching', 'character', 'way', 'choices', 'actions', 'Barney', 'Version', 'foremost', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'art', 'also', 'film', 'dilemma', 'just', 'approach', 'first', 'instance', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'luminous', 'characters', 'rich', 'story', 'emotional', 'authenticity', 'laden', 'golden', 'performances', 'especially', 'Giamatti', 'who', 'established', 'dean', 'American', 'performing', 'arts', 'explosions', 'hardware', 'ILM', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'movie', 'so', 'sensuously', 'textured', 'feel', 'out', 'screen', 'wraps', 'sheet', 'silk', 'second', 'instance', 'see', 'people', 'suffer', 'choices', 'Barney', 'Panofsky', 'Barney', 'far', 'too', 'multi-dimensional', 'people', 'life', 'write', 'off', 'moral', 'character', 'so', 'easily', 'elements', 'story', 'vicissitudes', 'ordinary', 'man', 'life', 'delicate', 'relationships', 'wife', 'father', 'friends', 'pleasures', 'pains', 'desires', 'dreads', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'be', 'seen', 'too', 'ordinary', 'too', 'unremarkable', 'triumph', 'film', 'deftly', 'components', 'remarkable', 'cinema', 'compel', 'see', 'extraordinary', 'ordinary', 'man', 'even', 'flawed', 'man', 'life', 'imperfect', 'complex', 'individual', 'Richler', 'Konyves', 'put', 'forth', 'question', 'partially', 'answer', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'when', 'character', 'someone', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'personal', 'defects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'defined', 'sum', 'total', 'bad', 'choices', 'not', 'finite', 'answer', 'viewer', 'left', 'reach', 'own', 'conclusion', 'presenting', 'challenge', 'wonder-filled', 'story', 'Barney', 'Version', 'masterful', 'great', 'art', 'well', 'question', 'originally']",N/A
1406602,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B004G8QO6Q,Craig Whittle,"[8, 11]","BARNEY'S VERSIONSTARRING: Paul Giamatti, Rosamund Pike, Minnie Driver, Scott Speedman, Bruce Greenwood, Mark Addy, Rachelle Lefevre, Anna Hopkins, Jake Hoffman and Dustin HoffmanWRITTEN BY: Michael Konyves; based on the novel by: Mordecai RichlerDIRECTED BY: Richard J. LewisRated: RGenre: Comedy / DramaRelease Date: 07 October 2010Review Date: 17 February 2011There are a few sensational films that were overlooked for the bulk of Academy Award nominations this year, and Barney's Version is at the top of that list. It received a single nomination for make-up which is much deserved, but it also has far more to offer.Paul Giamatti delivers a groundbreaking performance as Barney Panofsky for which he was awarded a Golden Globe. Barney is a balding, overweight drunk slob who is convicted of murdering his best friend.  This is brought to our attention in the early moments of the film and from there Barney takes us years back, to share with us his version of what transpired. Continuous cuts from past to present display the astounding makeup jobs attributed to the characters.We journey back to his first of three failed marriages and realize quickly that he has been this pudgy drunkard for quite some time. He marries his first wife solely on the basis that she is pregnant. When that doesn't pan out, he marries his second, for her beautiful looks. It probably doesn't hurt that she comes from money to boot.It's during his marriage to his second wife (Minnie Driver) that Barney and his best friend (Scott Speedman) get into a drunken argument and something goes terribly wrong; the details of which involve his being accused of murder (but that's all I can say).Barney leaves wife # 2 for another woman named Mirrian (Rosamund Pike) whom he believes he has fallen in love with at first sight. Mirrian becomes wife # 3 and they bare two children together and this is the relationship we spend the majority of the film with.Given the subject matter this may sound like a heavy drama but it is more often than not a laugh out loud comedy. It has its dark moments and serious ones, but it is a vivid look at a goofball of a man who has surprising luck with exceptional women. We enjoy watching Barney continuously make a fool out of himself and repeatedly sabotage his own life.Barney goes through hell and back to get Mirrian to be his lawfully wedded wife. Yet once he has her, all he can do is let her down, drink excessively and embarrass her in front of her friends at social gatherings. And should any other men come into Mirrian's life, socially or otherwise, Barney is thrown amuck. He even goes so far as to tell one family friend that Mirrian thinks he is gay.Paul Giamatti is dead-on in this role and I was completely captivated every time he entered the frame. Giamatti adds his own likeable qualities to Barney and they are virtually all that is keeping us rooting for this obscure dimwitted character.Dustin Hoffman plays Barney's father and there are some enormously humorous as well as tender moments shared between the two of them. Hoffman's role is a supporting one but thanks to his brilliance, it's a role that really brings the film up a notch or two.And the lovely Mirrian character, which in virtually every way is a perfect creature, is brought to life magnificently by Rosamund Pike. Pike's demeanor is accompanied by such a genuine tranquility that she almost seems unreal. She is sensational and there is literally a glow about her.The dialogue in this film is remarkably entertaining and the story takes us off on very rewarding conflicts and plot twists. The look and feel of it match the perfect writing and acting to a T, and I'm absolutely dumfounded that this was not considered one of the best films of the year. It was so much fun, I consider it one of the best films I've ever seen; and here I've gone on and on about it, and yet there is so much I haven't told you.",5,Barney's Version Review,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,3910,"['BARNEY', 'VERSIONSTARRING', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Mark', 'Addy', 'Rachelle', 'Lefevre', 'Anna', 'Hopkins', 'Jake', 'Hoffman', 'Dustin', 'HoffmanWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Michael', 'Konyves', 'based', 'novel', 'Mordecai', 'RichlerDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Richard', 'J.', 'LewisRated', 'RGenre', 'Comedy', '/', 'DramaRelease', 'Date', '07', 'October', '2010Review', 'Date', '17', 'February', '2011There', 'are', 'few', 'sensational', 'films', 'were', 'overlooked', 'bulk', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominations', 'year', 'Barney', 'Version', 'top', 'list', 'received', 'single', 'nomination', 'make-up', 'much', 'deserved', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'offer.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'groundbreaking', 'performance', 'Barney', 'Panofsky', 'was', 'awarded', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'Barney', 'balding', 'overweight', 'drunk', 'slob', 'who', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'best', 'friend', 'brought', 'attention', 'early', 'moments', 'film', 'Barney', 'years', 'back', 'share', 'version', 'what', 'transpired', 'Continuous', 'cuts', 'past', 'present', 'display', 'astounding', 'makeup', 'jobs', 'attributed', 'characters.We', 'journey', 'back', 'first', 'three', 'failed', 'marriages', 'realize', 'quickly', 'been', 'pudgy', 'drunkard', 'quite', 'time', 'first', 'wife', 'solely', 'basis', 'pregnant', 'When', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'second', 'beautiful', 'looks', 'probably', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'money', 'boot.It', 'marriage', 'second', 'wife', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'Barney', 'best', 'friend', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'get', 'drunken', 'argument', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'details', 'involve', 'being', 'accused', 'murder', 'can', 'say', '.Barney', 'wife', '2', 'woman', 'named', 'Mirrian', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'whom', 'fallen', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Mirrian', 'wife', '3', 'bare', 'two', 'children', 'together', 'relationship', 'spend', 'majority', 'film', 'with.Given', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'sound', 'heavy', 'drama', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'comedy', 'dark', 'moments', 'serious', 'ones', 'vivid', 'look', 'goofball', 'man', 'who', 'surprising', 'luck', 'exceptional', 'women', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Barney', 'continuously', 'make', 'fool', 'repeatedly', 'sabotage', 'own', 'life.Barney', 'hell', 'back', 'get', 'Mirrian', 'be', 'lawfully', 'wedded', 'wife', 'once', 'can', 'do', 'let', 'down', 'drink', 'excessively', 'embarrass', 'front', 'friends', 'social', 'gatherings', 'should', 'other', 'men', 'come', 'Mirrian', 'life', 'socially', 'otherwise', 'Barney', 'thrown', 'amuck', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'tell', 'one', 'family', 'friend', 'Mirrian', 'thinks', 'gay.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'dead-on', 'role', 'was', 'completely', 'captivated', 'time', 'entered', 'frame', 'Giamatti', 'own', 'likeable', 'qualities', 'Barney', 'are', 'virtually', 'keeping', 'rooting', 'obscure', 'dimwitted', 'character.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Barney', 'father', 'are', 'enormously', 'humorous', 'as', 'well', 'tender', 'moments', 'shared', 'two', 'Hoffman', 'role', 'supporting', 'one', 'thanks', 'brilliance', 'role', 'really', 'film', 'up', 'notch', 'two.And', 'lovely', 'Mirrian', 'character', 'virtually', 'way', 'perfect', 'creature', 'brought', 'life', 'magnificently', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Pike', 'demeanor', 'accompanied', 'such', 'genuine', 'tranquility', 'almost', 'unreal', 'sensational', 'literally', 'glow', 'her.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'remarkably', 'entertaining', 'story', 'off', 'very', 'rewarding', 'conflicts', 'plot', 'twists', 'look', 'feel', 'perfect', 'writing', 'acting', 'T', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'dumfounded', 'was', 'not', 'considered', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'here', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'yet', 'so', 'much', 'have', ""n't"", 'told']",N/A

Great!However, even on the surface, this is a story about the life of a flawed and damaged individual, and ends with him dying of a terrible disease. In common parlance, the story is a ""downer"" with no real redeeming social value in terms of moral education, wholesome entertainment, or artistry. Not great!What I found most disturbing is the story at a deeper level. Here was a very decent guy with a couple of bad habits who was ""taken apart"" by: (1) a self-destructive first wife; (2) his uncontrollable, mis-timed passion for the woman who eventually became his third wife; (3) his third wife's decision to punish him by leaving for a week; and (4) his weakness during a chance encounter under worst-case circumstances during that week. Then he dies... slowly and tragically. REALLY NOT GREAT!This is VERY similar to everyman's life in the Baby-Boom generation (including my own)... perhaps everyman's life in the history of the world. No forgiveness when it is needed most, and no Divine Grace when it could have done the most good. This wasn't tragedy, and it wasn't artistry in any elevating sense of the word.

It was.This is a slice of life flick. Quiet, medium paced with no frou frou, but it has a subtle build.Here's the scoop. Paul Giamotti plays a schlock TV producer Barney. A detective writes a book implicating Barney in a murder. Barney subsequently takes some time to reflect upon his life, his three wives and his general approach to things.The director, Richard J. Lewis, is a TV director so this comes as a surprise. This has a certain elegance one doesn't usually find in TV productions, and it isn't paced for commercial breaks. It is as smooth as silk and, at 2 hours 14 min. I wasn't looking at my watch, which is a good thing. It's Giamotti's movie plain and simple. Dustin Hoffman does a great job as his retired, beat cop father. Some complained that the womens' rolls weren't written that well and I can't argue. You really don't get to meet the first wife before she offs herself so she's little more than a sketch. Minnie Driver is good enough as the second wife but it's too much of a J.A.P. stereotype so there isn't much for her to chew on. Rosamund Pike gets the best of the wives' roll as Miriam. It's still a bit shy but not bad.This is simply a good drama. Barney is not a great guy but you still get to like him, warts and all.

Perhaps the reason for that is the popularity of Paul Giamatti, perhaps it is the strong supporting cast including Dustin Hoffman, Minnie Driver, Rosamund Pike, Scott Speedman, directors Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg, and Richard Lewis. Or perhaps the popularity of the original novel by Mordecai Richler, or the need people have to reassure themselves that their lives is not as bad as they are thinking. Whatever the reasons, this movie has been very successful. This viewer found it off-putting.Barney Panofsky (Paul Giamatti) is a cynical, self-absorbed, frumpy schlub of an aging television producer, divorced and comforted only by his cigars and rash drinking habits. As a new book is released detailing some sordid details of an event Barney would rather forget, he starts to look back on his life and all the many mistakes he made. And after three failed marriages, ""many"" may not be the apt word to describe them.'The story is told through a series of flashbacks after we learn a detective has written a book accusing Barney of killing his best friend Boogie (Scott Speedman). Barney's life's a mess: his first marriage happened because of his getting a tacky girlfriend pregnant, a marriage that ends being drowned in alcohol and cynicism and self pity. His second marriage is to a Jewish princess (Minnie Driver) whose mouth never closes. At the marriage ceremony Barney drinks with his father (Dustin Hoffman), watches games on TV, and finally spies the one true love of his life - Miriam (Rosamund Pike) - and this woman has a head on her shoulders.

Swanson,"[4, 5]","4.5 starsBarney's Promise starts a little slow but quickly finds its footing and soon becomes one of the most intelligent and honestly emotional new films I've seen in the past few years. Richler's book gets a crisp script treatment, and one is reminded of what a very funny writer that gentleman was. His work is all about people being human, and Giamatti gets right to the heart of Barney, a very sweet and sour fellow.Pike is the other lynchpin here, and her scenes with PG are often revelatory. THIS is what acting looks like! And feels like. There's a lot of feel in this film, and you can tell by the way it keeps getting better that the whole crew knew as it was being made that they were creating something special.Hoffman takes an over the top part and plays it just below the hilt, and makes it work. His scenes with PG are also gems. Which is of course due, as with Pike, to Giamatti as much as to Hoffman. PG was waiting for a role this juicy, and as with his perfect Miles in Sideways, you can't begin to imagine any one else in this role.This is not a kids' movie; it's for adults who've loved and lost and seen the cycles of life played out a few times, and can laugh and cry at all that comes with that. I did plenty of both, and I haven't cried at a movie in a while. This is a very honest family movie, as in how screwed up most families tend to be, but also how much love there is under the surface. And hate. And so much else.The laughs are often killers, as in the wedding, the best movie nuptials I've seen since Diner...and that was a while back!

While pursuing Miriam she has flaws, playing moral lecturing cat and mouse, ie taking his obsessive calls from a married man, and not pursuing other men. After a decade of marital bliss, Miriam explains to Barney, that she is going back to work as a TV host.  He gives his machissimo control freak speech, that he is the bread winner. He, out of vicious neglect, failed to attend her first TV interviews, watching hockey games habitually at a pub and getting drunk. He did the same abandonment trick at his second wedding. After some snide jealous remark over a colleague's sexuality, Miriam leaves him for space, taking her son along. After Barney has a one night stand despite his begging for forgiveness, she moves in with  her work colleague waiting in the wings.  Princesses dont tolerate mistakes. His main concern after the cheating mistake was if he caught an STD and was devastated by Miriam's final total rejection.

1406617,A129YBX5BVNW2,B004G8QO6Q,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[5, 5]","Sounding not unlike a child's software program - ""Barney's Version"" is a terrible name for a film and nearly put me off renting this 'journey' movie - I'm glad it didn't.Produced by Robert Lantos and Directed by Richard Lewis, the screenplay by Michael Konyves is adapted from Mordecai Richler's 1997 book of the same name. Across 30 eventful years, it tells the story of Barney Panofsky - a Monte Cristo smoking, whiskey guzzling chubby man living in Montreal. Barney is the TV Producing equivalent of ""Gregory House"" - irascible and loveable at the same time. Like his Dad Izzy Panofsky (a scene-stealing Dustin Hoffman) Barney tells it as it is - loves women impulsively - is headstrong in everything he does but has his heart in the right place. But he has a fatal flaw. It isn't that Barney is deliberately cruel or mean, he just keeps on making terrible mistakes over and over again (most of which are of his own making) and learns rather painfully as the years pass and happiness fades that the enemy is not others but 'himself'.It begins in Rome in 1974 when we're introduced to his motley crew of dead-beat friends - there's Thomas Trabacchi as Leo Fasoli - an Italian artistic genius who has yet to find an appreciative audience, a black friend who does a terrible deed on Barney (he later forgives this) and his best-friend - Boogie. Young, cocky, handsome and fancy-free - Boogie is a full-on babe magnet (played beautifully by Scott Speedman) who can't seem to finish his brilliant first novel as he systematically hoovers up every narcotic he can get his sweaty hands on. You sense Barney admires his balls and vicariously lives out his fantasies through Bookie's wanton bohemian lifestyle - but as life and the years go on - Bookie's drug addiction and stupid waste of a God-given talent stop being funny and even lead to a drunken catastrophe by a lake house.We are then introducing to Barney's three women - Clara, Bonnie and Miriam. Each of the actresses get real meat to work with and you can really sense they are relishing good parts in a good film. 1st up is Rachelle LeFevre playing Clara Chambers - a family dysfunctional who is beautiful but bordering on mental illness at every moment. Her performance is short but so astutely done. Barney then meets the equally gorgeous Miriam - a well-connected Jewish lady who can talk to beat the band (has a `Master's Degree') - dryly played by Minnie Driver to maximum effect. But then his eyes meet with the real deal - Miriam - played by the ethereally beautiful British actress Rosamund Pike. Barney is lost from the moment he sees her and pursues Miriam with the relentlessness of a Tomahawk missile. Their relationship's up and downs make up the bulk of the movie and Pike is fabulous in the part. More top moments are provided by the rest of the cast...Hoffman gets some great dialogue which he delivers in that soft understated way of his - regaling a table of elderly po-faced ladies at Barney's 2nd wedding about his 'cop-on-the-beat' past he tells them ""...he came at me with a hard-on the size of a can of hairspray..."" Or when he's giving his son ludicrously inept parental advice about his feelingless marriage to Bonnie ""...you're married to a well-bred woman who is loaded, makes a nice Flaky Kugel and has a beautiful rack - many successful marriages have been built on far less...""Nice supporting roles also go Kate Hopkins and Jake Hoffman who play Kate and Michael (Miriam and Barney's grown-up children) - Jake Hoffman showing more than a passing vocal and visual resemblance to his famous Dad - and glimpses of his acting chops. Bruce Greenwood is Blair - a handsome vegan who tempts Miriam both mentally and spiritually in the later stages of her rocky marriage to Barney - while Macha Grenon is superb as Solange - an aging TV star in the 30th season of Barney's daytime soap ""Malley Of The North"" - a woman who constantly harks back to her looks in the past (her clinging neediness is both protected and derided by Barney in equal measure). England's Mark Addy is excellent as Detective Sean O'Hearne - a bull-headed cop who is convinced that Barney has literally gotten away with murdering one his friends and has published a book to that effect called ""With Friends Like These"" (the mystery is brilliantly resolved at the end of the movie). There's even a great cameo by Saul Rubinek as Clara's Jewish father who tries to guilt away Clara's self-destructive past - but not in a way that shows compassion - but embarrassment for what it brought to their family (Barney makes short shift of him).But the film belongs to Giamatti - who gives his bumbling motormouth of a creation a beating heart - you laugh at Barney's life-grabbing impulsiveness (a particularly nice scene where he chases after Miriam in a train) up to his heart-breaking remorse at doing what he said he would never do to Miriam (crying into her chest on the side of the bed). With the aid of wigs and make-up, Giamatti flits from one time period to the next - and in each his character is wholly believable. In rolls on to 2010 where Barney is now balding and forgetting where he parked his car - but gets one final meet with his beloved Miriam. They talk openly and honestly and despite differences and irreparable harm - express their true feelings (title above). Paul Giamatti is magnificent in the role and fully deserved of his Golden Globes Award for Best Actor.To sum up - while it's a couple of shades short of being a masterpiece - ""Barney's Version"" is that rarity - a really good film that you've neither seen nor heard of - a little filmic gem that deserves a viewing and will reward you for doing so.Put it high on your rental list.",4,"""...Have I

1406618,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004G8QO6Q,Mark Turner,"[7, 7]","BARNEY'S VERSION is one of those movies that critics love. They talk about the depth of the story, the fantastic acting, the way the movie felt and looked. And for once those who would discuss these and others items of the film have it right. This is one fine movie.Paul Giamatti stars as Barney Panofsky, a studio producer looking back at his life. When it opens we see him doing his best to disrupt the life of his ex-wife by calling her husband at 3AM. From there we see him stopping at his favorite bar only to be hassled by an ex-police detective who's just released a book about the murder of Barney's best friend Boogie (Scott Speedman), a murder that the detective still believes Barney committed. But the body was never found. This confrontation leads to Barney's reflecting on his life.We're taken back to the early 70s when Barney was living in Europe surrounding himself with bohemian friends all interested in art. But this isn't a world Barney can be a part of, just an observer of. He marries a free spirit believing he is the father of her child only to part ways with her once the baby is lost and he discovers there was no way he was the father. On a binge with his friend Boogie, he misses a message and goes to his wife only to find she's committed suicide.Barney returns to Canada where he gets work with his uncle and eventually becomes a studio head. Along the way he is introduced to a young woman who catches his eye played by Minnie Driver. This woman is a non-stop talker whose father is a wealthy man. He also possesses the attitudes of such a man, greatly displayed when a dinner for the two prior to their marrying is held. Barney's father Izzy (Dustin Hoffman), an ex-cop, is invited to dinner only to have Driver's father offer him angry glances and demeaning comments.At the wedding things are going as planned. Barney's friends are there, the party is in full swing and much heavy drinking follows. While watching the hockey game at the reception, and after far too many drinks, Barney is told that his father in law has made comments about his own father. Heading to have it out with the man, he gets a glimpse of a woman that he finds amazing. After the confrontation with his father in law finishes, he meets this woman, Miriam (Rosamund Pike). Enamored with her, he follows her to the train station and asks her to run off with him. She turns him down but remains in his heart.The story continues involving all of these characters but to attempting to describe the story without giving away too much is just ridiculous. Suffice to say that Barney does lead and interesting life. And he eventually finds an amazing love that stays with him forever. But with each step he takes, Barney seems destined to screw things up. He doesn't want to, it just seems that he always takes the wrong turn.The film won an Oscar for make up and it was well deserved. The progression in age for Giamatti is amazing to watch. In one of the extras he discusses how much it helped his performance, giving him a reference point with which to grab hold of his character at that time in his life. Giamatti also won the Golden Globe for his performance here and he deserved that as well. This is one of the best things he's ever done.The film may be a bit long for some, may take a while to unwind that today's fast paced movie goers might not want to sit for. But in doing so you'll find a full, rich story that is better than most told these days. And in the end you'll discover a few truly touching moments and that at the heart of it all is a love story that's as sweet as they come.",4,A LIFE OF LOVE,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",2011,3599,"['BARNEY', 'VERSION', 'one', 'movies', 'critics', 'love', 'talk', 'depth', 'story', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'way', 'movie', 'felt', 'looked', 'once', 'who', 'would', 'discuss', 'others', 'items', 'film', 'have', 'right', 'one', 'fine', 'movie.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Barney', 'Panofsky', 'studio', 'producer', 'looking', 'back', 'life', 'When', 'see', 'doing', 'best', 'disrupt', 'life', 'ex-wife', 'calling', 'husband', '3AM', 'see', 'stopping', 'favorite', 'bar', 'only', 'be', 'hassled', 'ex-police', 'detective', 'who', 'just', 'released', 'book', 'murder', 'Barney', 'best', 'friend', 'Boogie', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'murder', 'detective', 'still', 'Barney', 'committed', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'confrontation', 'Barney', 'reflecting', 'life.We', ""'re"", 'taken', 'back', 'early', '70s', 'when', 'Barney', 'was', 'living', 'Europe', 'surrounding', 'bohemian', 'friends', 'interested', 'art', ""n't"", 'world', 'Barney', 'can', 'be', 'part', 'just', 'observer', 'free', 'spirit', 'believing', 'father', 'child', 'only', 'part', 'ways', 'once', 'baby', 'lost', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'father', 'binge', 'friend', 'Boogie', 'message', 'wife', 'only', 'find', 'committed', 'suicide.Barney', 'returns', 'Canada', 'where', 'work', 'uncle', 'eventually', 'studio', 'head', 'way', 'introduced', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'eye', 'played', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'woman', 'non-stop', 'talker', 'father', 'wealthy', 'man', 'also', 'attitudes', 'such', 'man', 'greatly', 'displayed', 'when', 'dinner', 'two', 'prior', 'marrying', 'held', 'Barney', 'father', 'Izzy', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'ex-cop', 'invited', 'dinner', 'only', 'have', 'Driver', 'father', 'offer', 'angry', 'glances', 'demeaning', 'comments.At', 'wedding', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'planned', 'Barney', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'party', 'full', 'swing', 'much', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'watching', 'hockey', 'game', 'reception', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'drinks', 'Barney', 'told', 'father', 'law', 'made', 'comments', 'own', 'father', 'Heading', 'have', 'out', 'man', 'glimpse', 'woman', 'amazing', 'confrontation', 'father', 'law', 'finishes', 'woman', 'Miriam', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Enamored', 'train', 'station', 'run', 'off', 'down', 'heart.The', 'story', 'involving', 'characters', 'attempting', 'describe', 'story', 'giving', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Barney', 'lead', 'interesting', 'life', 'eventually', 'amazing', 'love', 'forever', 'step', 'Barney', 'destined', 'screw', 'things', 'up', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'always', 'wrong', 'turn.The', 'film', 'won', 'Oscar', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'progression', 'age', 'Giamatti', 'amazing', 'watch', 'one', 'extras', 'how', 'much', 'helped', 'performance', 'giving', 'reference', 'point', 'grab', 'hold', 'character', 'time', 'life', 'Giamatti', 'also', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'performance', 'here', 'deserved', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'ever', 'done.The', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'long', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'unwind', 'today', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'goers', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'sit', 'doing', 'so', ""'ll"", 'find', 'full', 'rich', 'story', 'better', 'most', 'told', 'days', 'end', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'few', 'truly', 'touching', 'moments', 'heart', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'sweet', 'come']",N/A

In ""Sideways,"" Giamatti played a man who steals money from his mother to finance a weekend getaway; in Richard J. Lewis' ""Barney's Version,"" based on Mordecai Richler's last novel, Giamatti plays a man who deserts his new bride at their wedding to chase a woman he just met.""Barney's Version"" gives us the panorama of the life of Barney Panofsky (Giamatti), a Montreal soap opera producer, as he careens through three marriages (to Rachelle Lefevre, Minnie Driver, and Rosamund Pike, in that order) and countless other scrapes including a murder rap. Barney is a thoroughgoing rogue--when we first meet, he's crank-calling his ex-wife's new husband at 3 a.m.--but Giamatti gives him an impish twinkle, a bold love of life and a tinge of melancholy that make you want to hug him despite yourself.""Barney's Version"" is obviously a movie made from a novel; it has a firm structure but feels flabby and uncinematic in places. Nevertheless, Giamatti--who won a deserved Golden Globe for his performance and was robbed of an Oscar nomination--will keep you watching happily all the way to the film's poignant end. The other performances are excellent too, including all of Barney's aforementioned wives and also Dustin Hoffman as Barney's low-life cop father, Bruce Greenwood as a pompous radio producer and Scott Speedman as the freeloading, failed-writer buddy Barney may or may not have killed. (Fans of Canadian film will enjoy seeing a roll call of famous Canadian directors in cameo roles, including Atom Egoyan, Ted Kotcheff, Denys Arcand and--goofing on his ""Due South"" persona--Paul Gross.)

The film was 12 years in the making and when finally finished several Canadian actors made cameo appearances.  Tales focuses on a man in the twilight of his years looking back on his life, most notably those of his three wives with a slight subplot of whether he murdered his best friend or not.  The acting is high end and I can see why Giamatti got best comedy actor by the Golden Globe.  Rosamund Pike plays his third soulmate wife who isn't able to forgive him (even though one could argue the husband's drunken action was related to her time spent with an associate she later ends up marrying in the tale) but still remains in his life.

1406623,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B004G8QO6Q,M. Oleson,"[2, 2]","Paul Giamatti gives another powerful performance as Barney Panofsky, a Jewish Canadian TV producer.  Slipping into dementia he reflects back on his life, primarily by referencing his failed 3 marriages.  We get to go along for the ride.  Living in Italy as a young man in 1974, he hangs with a small cadre of friends including Clara (Rachelle Lefevre).  When she becomes pregnant, Barney believing the child was his agrees to marry her.  The baby is stillborn but isn't his, so Barney understandably bolts but with tragic consequences.His second wife is the stereotypical Jewish princess played by Minnie Driver.  Her family is wealthy, but she is every bit as annoying to Barney as she is to us.  But then so is Barney.  He wants a divorce and finds his opportunity when he catches his wife banging his best friend, Boogie (Scott Speedman).  In a subplot, Boogie disappears after falling into a lake after he and Barney get drunk (a common theme throughout) and argue over the fidelity issue.  The police believe Barney killed Boogie but have no evidence or body.Back to the wives.  On Barney's wedding night with wife number 2, he meets future wife number 3, Miriam (Rosamund Pike).  She is surprised by Barney's interest in her, dismissing his actions, yet secretly appreciates his determination.  After his divorce is final with number 2, his vigilance is finally rewarded.  Giamatti's performance is justifiably acknowledged but Rosamund Pike has been overlooked for years.  Her take on the beautiful, smart and charming 3rd Mrs. Panofsky equals her co-star.  Both age over 30 years in the film and I must say that for a small production, it is really well done.Dustin Hoffman has a nice turn as well as Barney's dad, an ex-cop.  The film isn't without flaws however.  While Barney finally has happiness with Miriam and raises 2 children to adulthood, you have to question the attraction she ever had.  Barney is not likeable.  He's loud and obnoxious and a social pariah.  Miriam is just the opposite, and well...just look at the two of them.  The film also pushes the boundaries just being excessive.  The conclusion, while contextually important, goes on too long.  Still this is a very good film directed by Richard J. Lewis.  The Blu ray disc looks great.

A film that creeps up on you- at first laughing and then silently weeping. A marvel of a film with much to say, one of those films you think about long afterr the viewing.'Barney's Version' tells the story of a man not particularly talented or good looking or very rich, but a man who is greatly loved by a beautiful woman and that is a puzzle to many. Barney drinks much too much, smokes cigars, has a paunch, isn't there when she really needs him, but he has something that is palpable. Paul Giamatti plays Barney, and this is a wonder of his acting. He has picked roles of men who are not particularly distinguised, but he makes these men something to behold. Barney was married three times, once to a young woman who killed herself, the second time because the woman loved him, and on his wedding day he met the love of his life and pursued her until they were married. Two children and a wonderful life and then it falls apart. Barney never recovers, and as he ponders his life in flashbacks, we come to understand where he has been but not where he is going. Many lessons in this film, and it is sad that Barney never really gets to understand these lessons.Paul Giamatti's performance is remarkable, a performance that deserved the Oscar. The nuance of his acting is so beautiful. He reminded me of a friend.Highly Recommended. prisrob 08-12-11Win WinSafe Men",5,A Man Distinguished By His Flaws,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,1429,"['could', 'recommend', 'one', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Barney', 'Version', 'film', 'up', 'you-', 'first', 'laughing', 'then', 'silently', 'weeping', 'marvel', 'film', 'much', 'say', 'one', 'films', 'think', 'long', 'afterr', 'viewing', ""'Barney"", 'Version', 'story', 'man', 'not', 'particularly', 'talented', 'good', 'looking', 'very', 'rich', 'man', 'who', 'greatly', 'loved', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'puzzle', 'many', 'Barney', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'smokes', 'cigars', 'paunch', ""n't"", 'when', 'really', 'something', 'palpable', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Barney', 'wonder', 'acting', 'picked', 'roles', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'distinguised', 'men', 'something', 'behold', 'Barney', 'was', 'married', 'three', 'times', 'once', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'killed', 'second', 'time', 'woman', 'loved', 'wedding', 'day', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'pursued', 'were', 'married', 'Two', 'children', 'wonderful', 'life', 'then', 'apart', 'Barney', 'never', 'recovers', 'life', 'flashbacks', 'come', 'understand', 'where', 'been', 'not', 'where', 'going', 'Many', 'lessons', 'film', 'sad', 'Barney', 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'lessons.Paul', 'Giamatti', 'performance', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nuance', 'acting', 'so', 'beautiful', 'reminded', 'friend.Highly', 'Recommended', 'prisrob', '08-12-11Win', 'WinSafe', 'Men']",N/A
1406629,A2ZQXJD7YUIEHB,B004G8QO6Q,rash67,"[3, 6]","I just loved this movie. My heart really went out to Barney Panofsky, the Paul Giamatti character. He seems like a creepy TV executive who may have murdered his wife at first, but the more you see of it the more sympathetic his much maligned character becomes. An ex-cop with an axe to grind has written a hatefilled biography of him, full of lies. But this is ""Barney's Version"" of his life.I think this is Gaimatti's most involving role since his classic ""Sideways"", a similar rascal character. The amazing thing here is makeup for which the movie was nominated for an Academy Award! It is easy to make an young guy old, but practically impossible to make an older guy look young and that's what the makeup people do here, in the beginning Barney is maybe in his twenties and Giamatti, I'm guessing, is in his forties! In the beginning he is a bohemian in Italy, living with his hippie, druggy buddies. His girlfriend (Rachelle Lefevre) is pregnant and convinces him he is the dad and he should marry her. Despite her ambiguous morality, he does the ""right thing"", only to find her love child is black and he's been tricked. Then the girl dies in childbirth!He marries again but at his wedding, he meets the love of his life, Miriam, played by the beautiful and luminous Rosamund Pike. And she isn't the woman he is marrying, (Minnie Driver)(!) I won't tell more. All this happens early in the movie. The movie takes Giammatti from his twenties to his sixties, maybe. Amazing makeup, as I've said.Sad, funny, heartrending. A little known, but heartfelt movie, wonderful acting and much more interesting than Gaimatti's more famous ""Win/Win"".

Oh, Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, with his plump, appealing, roly-poly demeanor.  But scene after scene of him pouring himself another glass of liquor or puffing on a cigar or arguing with someone in a superficial manner as he bounces from marriage to marriage doesn't add up to much of a character portrait.  He seems to find the true love of his life in wife No. 3 -- Miriam.  And lovely she is.  Although how one could so blithely kick the appealing Minnie Driver out of bed seems unlikely at best.  But even the marriage to Miriam doesn't quite catch fire.  All of the actors are good, including a likable Dustin Hoffman as Barney's retired cop father.  But the screenplay is dramatically thin, despite much blustering, lacking in character depth.  None of Barney's relationships come across as anything more than superficial.

Don't read until after you've seen the movie.Who shall say I am not the happy genius of my household?  William Carlos WilliamsBarney's life trajectory is seen in flashbacks from 1974 to 2010, from Rome to Montreal, his three marriages, to a painter, to a religious socioeconomic match, then love which just happens. Barney is a mensch (Yiddish for an ethical kindly gentle good hearted man) a rescuer of family, friends, writers, artists, a loyal, supportive, encouraging enabler.Barney's caregiving and protection begin with his widowed policeman father Izzy Israel Panofsky (Dustin Hoffman): Don't ever tell my father what he will or will not do. He's my father and he will have your respect.Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQBarney's intuition for human suffering and pain guides his choices imperfectly but compassionately; nonjudging caretaking of others matched with denial of how his behavior harms.Barney is the sole buyer of painter Leo Fasoli's works in Rome 1974. Bernard ""Boogie"" is a gifted novelist. Boogie likens Barney to philosopher Heine (Thought precedes action as lightening precedes thunder 1834 compare with DVD Iron Lady: thought becomes action, actions become habits, habits become character, character is destiny. Our thoughts are our destiny). Barney practices tikkun olam (Hebrew repairing the world) persistent in trying to control others, make things better, borrowing money to support insolvent Boogie. Friendship means caretaking without autonomy to Barney without requiring accountability or responsibility in return.Painter Clara cuckholds Barney with best friends Boogie and Anonymous (unimportant characters lack names). Barney's attempt to rescue Clara from artistic emotional instability is thwarted by adultery, a stillborn infant, Boogie's alcoholic forgetfulness heralding incipient dementia. [Last weekend we participated in an eight stage Survivor competition between 18 year olds and parent teams, which affirmed that we live unaware of declining mental dexterity (Trivia competition) never even heard of TV shows or bands]Clara's father's insensitivity to psychiatrist's molestation of Clara and her suicide attempt at age 12 offends Barney, even though Clara spits grief as aggression: you wear your heart on your sleeve, put it away, it is disgusting.Barney moves to Montreal to produce TV soap opera with his uncle, hiring Bulgarian Solange. Fake tabloids faxed from Bulgaria support Solange's self image as sex symbol TV star. Barney intuits other's needs and supports cherished denial and fantasies.At Barney's wedding to his second nameless wife (Minnie Driver), he is entranced by guest Miriam. Miriam is intelligent, curious, reads, is abreast of current events, and cares enough about other people to be interested in what interests them. Miriam sustains dignity and integrity in the face of Barney's adulterous pursuit: sobriety and regret await you.Izzy's wedding present of his first gun becomes an unexpected liability when Boogie disappears in 1980.Firefighting plane hum ties the entire movie together. Ominous whirring brackets Barney's lifeline from 1980 when Boogie disappears to 2010 when 66 year old Barney watches a child swimming with an inflated ball explaining Boogie's skeletal ""skydiving"" fractures.Barney's divorce, then marriage to Miriam is a lovely second act with children Michael and Kate granting him a blessed contented life. Izzy: you did good boychick. Izzy's death ends loving mutual support and encouragement between father and son as Barney drifts between drinking and sports, neglecting Miriam.The honesty in Barney and Miriam's marriage is admirable for dignified communication: I just wanted to be clear what happened here. The one unacceptable for Miriam whose own mother died of cancer and a broken heart from her father's indiscretions is adultery.A female version of Barney isYoung Adult.The most visible creators I know of are those artists whose medium is life itself. The ones who express the impossible - without brush, hammer, clay or guitar. They neither paint nor sculpt - their medium is being. Whatever their presence touches has increased life. They see and don't have to draw. They are the artists of being alive. . .

The performances, writing and locations are all worthy to watch, and even though this is a low impact film, the needed picture clarity and sound yearned to be preserved in Blu. The colors and lens tints in all of the locations shine, especially the Roman streets and New York/Montreal countryside. The DTS sound had only a few surround moments, but the dialogue volume is done well. The supplements include:* Making of, 10:23 minutes. In lodef, very clip heavy, and is almost the least helpful of the supplements.* Mordecai Richler Interview, 3:18 minutes. I suppose big fans of his will have already seen this from a few years back, but a worthy addition to the film here. He talks while shooting pool and reads from his book.* Red carpet, 4:15 minutes. Standard interviews from the carpet at the AFI Fest. Always nice to see everyone all dressed up and sincerely enjoying their art.* 92nd St Q&A;, 35:09 minutes. Big fans of Giamatti will love this one as he gets interviewed in length about a great deal of topics. He does well and provides some honest input (always with a little self loathe and candor).* Crew commentary, honestly I got more from the interviews.* Disc 2 is the DVD version of the film.Region coded A, with audio and subs in English only.

1406637,A1CUOJ9ZMOWD29,B004G8QO6Q,Tassie Ted,"[0, 5]","Barney's Version is one of my favorite books.  The movie/DVD passes muster in many respects.  It is reasonably faithful to the story and the production is good but its one downfall is casting.Dustin Hoffman was not actually my idea of Barney's detective dad but is, nevertheless, excellent. Blair was OK but needed to be more satirized.  Similarly,  Minnie Driver takes the role of Barney's obnoxious, but well-meaning, second wife quite delightfully beyond the reader's imagination.The appearance of the main character, Barney, is far too reminiscent of the presenter in ""Mythbusters"" even down to the short ginger, curly hair and is borderline OK despite Gaimatti's reasonable acting. To have taken the prototype of the unruly haired Mordecai Richler himself (who appears in the ""Special Features"" on the DVD) would have been far more convincing.The druggsy, Buggsy is just too over-the-top Hollywood to be believable. The way directors allow alcoholic characters, schizophrenics and the like such free reign is getting pretty tedious.Despite what others have said, my one real disappointment was my favorite character, Miriam. The quiet dignity and depth of Miriam's character in the book just didn't fit with the bright-eyed face and slender figure of someone more fitted to modeling women's underwear in a Sears' catalogue. That's not to say that Rosamund Pike didn't do a valiant job but she just wasn't Miriam to begin with.  The frilly icing on top of this was, not only did Miriam not age over the span of 40 years, or so, but she actually appeared younger. Maybe it was vanity. The absence of aging make-up could have been a condition of the contract if Rosamund wished to remain so bright-eyed and bushy tailed in the public's mind - for future occasions.  Good luck to her I say, she would actually be excellent and well worth watching if cast in a  more suitable part.Overall, the movie is well worth watching but, as is often the case, slightly disappointing if you've identified too closely with the real characters in Mordecai Richler`s  book.",4,Good but casting could have been much better.,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,2059,"['Barney', 'Version', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'movie/DVD', 'muster', 'many', 'respects', 'reasonably', 'faithful', 'story', 'production', 'good', 'one', 'downfall', 'casting.Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'was', 'not', 'actually', 'idea', 'Barney', 'detective', 'dad', 'nevertheless', 'excellent', 'Blair', 'was', 'OK', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'satirized', 'Similarly', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'role', 'Barney', 'obnoxious', 'well-meaning', 'second', 'wife', 'quite', 'delightfully', 'reader', 'imagination.The', 'appearance', 'main', 'character', 'Barney', 'far', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'presenter', 'Mythbusters', 'even', 'down', 'short', 'ginger', 'curly', 'hair', 'borderline', 'OK', 'Gaimatti', 'reasonable', 'acting', 'have', 'taken', 'prototype', 'unruly', 'haired', 'Mordecai', 'Richler', 'who', 'Special', 'Features', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'convincing.The', 'druggsy', 'Buggsy', 'just', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'Hollywood', 'be', 'believable', 'way', 'directors', 'allow', 'alcoholic', 'characters', 'schizophrenics', 'like', 'such', 'free', 'reign', 'getting', 'pretty', 'tedious.Despite', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'favorite', 'character', 'Miriam', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'depth', 'Miriam', 'character', 'book', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bright-eyed', 'face', 'slender', 'figure', 'someone', 'more', 'fitted', 'modeling', 'women', 'underwear', 'Sears', 'catalogue', 'not', 'say', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'valiant', 'job', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'Miriam', 'begin', 'frilly', 'icing', 'top', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Miriam', 'not', 'age', 'span', '40', 'years', 'so', 'actually', 'appeared', 'younger', 'Maybe', 'was', 'vanity', 'absence', 'aging', 'make-up', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'condition', 'contract', 'Rosamund', 'wished', 'remain', 'so', 'bright-eyed', 'bushy', 'tailed', 'public', 'mind', 'future', 'occasions', 'Good', 'luck', 'say', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'excellent', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'cast', 'more', 'suitable', 'part.Overall', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'often', 'case', 'slightly', 'disappointing', ""'ve"", 'identified', 'too', 'closely', 'real', 'characters', 'Mordecai', 'Richler', 's', 'book']",N/A

She wants to be the perfect wife, but Paul won't let her. Why? Because he is in love with a different woman, Miriam (Rosamund Pike) who he met briefly at his wedding reception. While most men would get over it and move on, Barney does not.

Set between when he was young and got married to his first wife and present day we are treated to ""Barney's Version"" of his life.  This is a movie I can just not say enough about.  The best movie of the year, and one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is impossible to talk about this movie without giving away the ending so I have a hard review to write.  When you do see this movie please make sure you don't give away the ending, so that others may experience it the way you did.  The one big problem I have with this movie is that not only was this movie totally snubbed by the ""Oscars"" with a total of 0 nominations, but that Paul Giammati won the ""Golden Globe"" for best actor in a comedy!!!  Anyone who watches this will tell you that this is about as much of a comedy as ""Schindler's List"".  Giammati gives one of the best performances I have ever seen and to not get noticed by the ""Oscars"" and told that it was comedic is a slap in the face.  I will spare you my usual rant on how the best movies don't get seen because of no use of CGI, but this is another one of them.  Watch this movie, tell everyone you know to watch this movie.  Incredible, incredible film.  Overall, best picture of the year, and top ten of all time.  I give it an A+.Would I watch again? - Absolutely, I will tell as many people to watch this as I can.*Also try - Get Low",5,Paul Giamatti gives one of the best performances ever in one of the greatest movies ever.

1406642,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B004G8QO6Q,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[20, 24]","Barney's Version is the film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Canadian author Mordecai Richler.Barney's Version is at its heart the life of Barney Panofsky, a Jewish man from Montreal who seems at once blessed by fate with opportunities but cursed by flaws that ultimately undo him. Irascible and impulsive, he has a charm that endears even as his behavior often appalls. He has the gift of recognizing the spark of creative genius in others but is seemingly incapable of producing it himself, spending most of his adult life as a producer of a long-running (and painfully banal) Canadian TV soap opera - Constable O'Malley of the North - through his company, the sardonically-named Totally Unnecessary Productions.The film begins with Barney, on the eve of celebrating his soap opera's 30th year of production, having to contend with the publication of a book by an ex-cop purporting to reveal how Barney is guilty of murder. What follows is Barney's Version of the events of his life, starting with his semi-hedonistic hanging about with friends in Europe when he was in his 20's, quickly careening through two disastrous marriages until he meets the one true love of his life, Miriam, who's a guest at his second wedding.As a film, Barney's Version suffers from the choices made for the adaptation by the scriptwriter Michael Konyves, both in terms of the framing, which reduces the overall impact that came across in the novel, and in the reductions and compressions which make some of the characters come across as two-dimensional and others at times baffling in terms of their actions and decisions.But all that said, it is still a movie well worth seeing for the great cast that manage for the most part to overcome the shortcomings of the script and for particularly fine performances by Paul Giamatti as Barney; Rosamund Pike as his third ex-wife (and only real love), Miriam; Dustin Hoffman as his loving but embarrassingly coarse father, Izzy; and Scott Speedman as his friend Boogie, a gifted but spectacularly self-destructive writer whom Barney is suspected of murdering.It is worth noting that for his performance in Barney's Version, Giamatti won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical. His performance is truly what makes the film work as he manages to bring out all of the qualities that make Barney at once sympathetic - his impulsiveness, his capacity for grand gestures, his ability to love - and yet annoyingly pathetic - his passive-aggressiveness, his insecurities, and his inability to realize when he's screwing up. Giamatti seems to slip effortlessly from one to the other, putting Barney Panofsky with all of his human gifts and frailties on full display.  And the film itself was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Makeup as it had to show Giamatti as Barney aging from his 20's through his 60's.  It's subtle but well-done, making you feel that you're really seeing his life as it happened.On a side-note, Canadian film buffs may spot cameos by a number of Canadian directors: Atom Egoyan (as an early director of Barney's soap opera), David Cronenberg (as a later director of the soap), Paul Gross (as a star in the soap), and Denys Arcand (as the Matre'D at Barney & Miriam's last luncheon). And if you notice a surprisingly strong resemblance between Barney's father, Izzy, and his son, Michael (as an adult), it's because Michael is played by Jake Hoffman, who is Dustin Hoffman's real-life son.  And Barney's daughter as a young girl is played by Simone Richler.Definitely recommended as an entertaining and engaging film.",4,Great acting makes this tale of a second-rate life first-rate,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3595,"['Barney', 'Version', 'film', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Canadian', 'author', 'Mordecai', 'Richler.Barney', 'Version', 'heart', 'life', 'Barney', 'Panofsky', 'Jewish', 'man', 'Montreal', 'who', 'once', 'blessed', 'fate', 'opportunities', 'cursed', 'flaws', 'ultimately', 'undo', 'Irascible', 'impulsive', 'charm', 'even', 'behavior', 'often', 'gift', 'recognizing', 'spark', 'creative', 'genius', 'others', 'seemingly', 'incapable', 'producing', 'spending', 'most', 'adult', 'life', 'producer', 'long-running', 'painfully', 'banal', 'Canadian', 'TV', 'soap', 'opera', 'Constable', ""O'Malley"", 'North', 'company', 'sardonically-named', 'Totally', 'Unnecessary', 'Productions.The', 'film', 'Barney', 'eve', 'celebrating', 'soap', 'opera', '30th', 'year', 'production', 'having', 'contend', 'publication', 'book', 'ex-cop', 'purporting', 'reveal', 'how', 'Barney', 'guilty', 'murder', 'What', 'Barney', 'Version', 'events', 'life', 'starting', 'semi-hedonistic', 'hanging', 'friends', 'Europe', 'when', 'was', '20', 'quickly', 'careening', 'two', 'disastrous', 'marriages', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'life', 'Miriam', 'who', 'guest', 'second', 'wedding.As', 'film', 'Barney', 'Version', 'suffers', 'choices', 'made', 'adaptation', 'scriptwriter', 'Michael', 'Konyves', 'terms', 'framing', 'overall', 'impact', 'came', 'novel', 'reductions', 'compressions', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'two-dimensional', 'others', 'times', 'baffling', 'terms', 'actions', 'decisions.But', 'said', 'still', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'great', 'cast', 'manage', 'most', 'part', 'overcome', 'shortcomings', 'script', 'particularly', 'fine', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Barney', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'third', 'ex-wife', 'only', 'real', 'love', 'Miriam', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'loving', 'embarrassingly', 'coarse', 'father', 'Izzy', 'Scott', 'Speedman', 'friend', 'Boogie', 'gifted', 'spectacularly', 'self-destructive', 'writer', 'whom', 'Barney', 'suspected', 'murdering.It', 'worth', 'noting', 'performance', 'Barney', 'Version', 'Giamatti', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Comedy', 'Musical', 'performance', 'truly', 'what', 'film', 'work', 'bring', 'out', 'qualities', 'make', 'Barney', 'once', 'sympathetic', 'impulsiveness', 'capacity', 'grand', 'gestures', 'ability', 'love', 'yet', 'annoyingly', 'pathetic', 'passive-aggressiveness', 'insecurities', 'inability', 'realize', 'when', 'screwing', 'up', 'Giamatti', 'slip', 'effortlessly', 'one', 'other', 'putting', 'Barney', 'Panofsky', 'human', 'gifts', 'frailties', 'full', 'display', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Makeup', 'had', 'show', 'Giamatti', 'Barney', 'aging', '20', '60', 'subtle', 'well-done', 'making', 'feel', ""'re"", 'really', 'seeing', 'life', 'side-note', 'Canadian', 'film', 'buffs', 'may', 'spot', 'cameos', 'number', 'Canadian', 'directors', 'Atom', 'Egoyan', 'early', 'director', 'Barney', 'soap', 'opera', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'later', 'director', 'soap', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'star', 'soap', 'Denys', 'Arcand', 'Matre', ""'D"", 'Barney', 'Miriam', 'last', 'luncheon', 'notice', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'resemblance', 'Barney', 'father', 'Izzy', 'son', 'Michael', 'adult', 'Michael', 'played', 'Jake', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'real-life', 'son', 'Barney', 'daughter', 'young', 'girl', 'played', 'Simone', 'Richler.Definitely', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'film']",N/A
