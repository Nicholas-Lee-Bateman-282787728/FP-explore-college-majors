1659185,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B00DLX766Y,&#308;&#308;,"[0, 0]","In the past year, yoga has become a favorite way to work out for me, and I am always looking to become more flexible and strong. This sounded like the perfect DVD for the way that I like my yoga. While the routines themselves aren't necessarily bad, I've experienced so many more yoga DVDs that are taught better and flow smoother.As you will find when you pull up the extremely basic menu, there are three segments to this DVD: yoga for strength, yoga for flexibility, and meditation. The two yoga workouts are about 30 minutes each, and the meditation is about 7 minutes. They are all done with the same background; a seemingly garden-like area with a pool nearby and the ocean off into the distance, a relaxing albeit strange setting (I'd never expect to see a pool in a workout video).The workouts are definitely NOT for the beginner and are more toward the intermediate yoga student. The moves are sometimes tricky, and the instructor does not verbally explain them well at all. In fact, her cuing isn't that clear or in sync either. Often she doesn't call yoga moves by their actual name, and she'll say something completely ambiguous such as, ""Pull your inner thigh to your outer thigh,"" and I have to look at the screen to see what she's talking about. More often than not, when I do look at the TV, she's already coming out of the pose that she's just now telling you to get into; this lack of synch is really inexcusable considering that this DVD uses a voiceover format of teaching! Also, she never tells you which leg she's talking about; she instead just says ""your leg"" instead of specifying right or left. Obviously, with more repetition, I'll predict how to stay in time with her and how she wants me to do the poses, but my first few views leave me very confused.Another reason that the workouts aren't very beginner is because they move very quickly. You will NEVER see a child's pose on the DVD, because she very rarely slows down or breaks, which I think you should always do in yoga, even if the focus is on strengthening.Other reviewers have done a great job describing the segments, but I'll throw my two cents in. I do agree with several reviewers that complained about there being no warm up/sun salutations. It was very unnatural for my body to go straight into full on poses without first gradually waking up my muscles.YOGA FOR STRENGTH - I did feel like this routine did a sufficient job of challenging my entire body. She begins by breathing with you for a few moments then doing some neck rolls. Then she moved on to poses which included the following: planks, side planks, crunches, bicycles, tricep pushups, crescent lunges, warrior III, split stretch, deep chair, warrior II, side angle, boat, bridge, and corpse. She ended the practice like I've never seen before: by emitting a very loud, jolting ""ohm"" hum. I thought it was odd to end the practice this way.YOGA FOR FLEXIBILITY - Although there were a few good stretches, I honestly didn't feel like this did that great of a job in helping me attain a greater flexibility. Again she starts by breathing and doing some neck circles before moving into arm circles and standing side and back bends. She then emitted the weird ohm hum again and went into some moves that included the following: wide squats (very reminiscent of second position plies from ballet), standing cat/cow, hip circles, hamstring stretch, triangle pose, inner thigh stretch, half straddle stretch, and corpse pose.It should be noted that during each corpse pose, the instructor attempts a motivational talk about being yourself in the moment. Unfortunately, it felt less genuine and more Hollywood/cheesy.MEDITATION - I thought the meditation segment was excellent. I've attended several live meditations very much like this one. She instructs you how to sit cross legged and tall. She all tells you exactly how to breathe and hold your hands. It's a very relaxing few minutes that I honestly wish could have lasted a bit longer.Overall, it's not a HORRIBLE yoga DVD; the teaching and cuing are just a bit sub-par, and I've seen many better yoga DVDs on the market. Crunch - Candlelight Yoga is an excellent relaxation/flexibility option; Crunch: Yoga Body Sculpt is a wonderful lower body strengthening workout; and 10 Minute Solution Yoga is great for total body sculpting, flexibility, and relaxation. I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD to beginners, and I would recommend that intermediates and advanced only try this DVD if they can't find anything else that works for them. While it does give a decent workout, it doesn't seem to capture the true essence of yoga and isn't very well produced at all.",3,Slightly challenging workout that isn't taught well,1385769600,"11 30,

1659186,A2EWLE619WRT1Y,B00DLX766Y,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I have most of the element series, and I have all of Ashley Turner's. I thought the Power Yoga was the hardest, boy was I wrong. Although the Power Yoga series was almost an hour long and incorporated more vinyasa, the strength portion of this video alone was harder. What I enjoyed was that not only in 30 mins can you get a more powerful workout, but that it also really concentrates on the core and glutes. The next two days I was sore from head to toe, and I practice yoga 4 times a week and run no less than 3 miles at a time. So I'd say that even if you are in decent shape, this video will kick your butt. No it is NOT for beginners, but I like that about it. This is the video to give those pesky friends, husbands, or brothers that don't believe yoga can be a challenging workout. I made my brother do this video to prove it's worth and he was huffing and puffing. I haven't fully used the flexibility part yet because I'm so worn out after the strength series, but I just absolutely love it. It does lack some of the yoga familiarity of warm ups and sun salutes etc. However it is definitely a nice addition to rotate in for a challenging day. I think a follow up of flexibility after the strength portion could be just about the perfect session. On a more stressful day I might stick to power yoga or yoga for weight loss instead, but this one rocks.",5,This is my most challenging yoga dvd yet...,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,1361,"['have', 'most', 'element', 'series', 'have', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'thought', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'was', 'hardest', 'boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'series', 'was', 'almost', 'hour', 'long', 'incorporated', 'more', 'vinyasa', 'strength', 'portion', 'video', 'alone', 'was', 'harder', 'What', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'not', 'only', '30', 'mins', 'can', 'get', 'more', 'powerful', 'workout', 'also', 'really', 'core', 'glutes', 'next', 'two', 'days', 'was', 'sore', 'head', 'toe', 'practice', 'yoga', '4', 'times', 'week', 'run', 'no', 'less', '3', 'miles', 'time', 'So', ""'d"", 'say', 'even', 'are', 'decent', 'shape', 'video', 'will', 'kick', 'butt', 'NOT', 'beginners', 'like', 'video', 'give', 'pesky', 'friends', 'husbands', 'brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'yoga', 'can', 'be', 'challenging', 'workout', 'made', 'brother', 'do', 'video', 'prove', 'worth', 'was', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'have', ""n't"", 'fully', 'used', 'flexibility', 'part', 'yet', ""'m"", 'so', 'worn', 'out', 'strength', 'series', 'just', 'absolutely', 'love', 'lack', 'yoga', 'familiarity', 'warm', 'ups', 'sun', 'salutes', 'etc', 'However', 'definitely', 'nice', 'addition', 'rotate', 'challenging', 'day', 'think', 'follow', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'portion', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'perfect', 'session', 'more', 'stressful', 'day', 'might', 'stick', 'power', 'yoga', 'yoga', 'weight', 'loss', 'instead', 'one', 'rocks']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659187,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00DLX766Y,atmj,"[1, 2]","Having prior purchased a Yoga lesson by Ashley Turner, I was prepared to sweat.  I was not disappointed.  As before in the prior lesson, though the routine for the Strength portion was tough, it was doable. She also provides some modifications, if sections are too difficult. I have had some other instructor's routines, to not be doable for beginner to intermediates.  This is not the case here.This was one heck of a core/leg workout.  Your lunges and warrior poses will be all that much stronger for it.The flexibility routine, though not a cinch also was doable.  You will sweat here too.  The first part is predominantly upper body (shoulders/chest) and the latter concentrates on lower body (hips and hamstrings).  While I'm sure beginners (like me) and intermediates may not be able to go as deep in poses as the instructor, there is much room where they can do all the poses.There was a meditation section about 8 minutes long, that while good suffered from the inclusion of too noisy music. It missed the point of the meditation.  In fact I think the whole DVD, could do without the music.If you watch this DVD on a laptop like I do, there is no way to turn down the music separate from the voice.  I know I looked.Her instruction is very good, you don't always have to watch what she is doing to understand what is next. I also like that she looks like an athlete and not a twig.",5,Another great workout by Ashley Turner,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1389,"['Having', 'prior', 'purchased', 'Yoga', 'lesson', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'was', 'prepared', 'sweat', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'prior', 'lesson', 'routine', 'Strength', 'portion', 'was', 'tough', 'was', 'doable', 'also', 'modifications', 'sections', 'are', 'too', 'difficult', 'have', 'had', 'other', 'instructor', 'routines', 'not', 'be', 'doable', 'beginner', 'intermediates', 'not', 'case', 'here.This', 'was', 'one', 'heck', 'core/leg', 'workout', 'lunges', 'warrior', 'poses', 'will', 'be', 'much', 'stronger', 'it.The', 'flexibility', 'routine', 'not', 'cinch', 'also', 'was', 'doable', 'will', 'sweat', 'here', 'too', 'first', 'part', 'predominantly', 'upper', 'body', 'shoulders/chest', 'latter', 'concentrates', 'lower', 'body', 'hips', 'hamstrings', ""'m"", 'sure', 'beginners', 'intermediates', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'as', 'deep', 'poses', 'instructor', 'much', 'room', 'where', 'can', 'do', 'poses.There', 'was', 'meditation', 'section', '8', 'minutes', 'long', 'good', 'suffered', 'inclusion', 'too', 'noisy', 'music', 'missed', 'point', 'meditation', 'fact', 'think', 'whole', 'DVD', 'could', 'do', 'music.If', 'watch', 'DVD', 'laptop', 'do', 'way', 'turn', 'down', 'music', 'separate', 'voice', 'know', 'looked.Her', 'instruction', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'watch', 'what', 'doing', 'understand', 'what', 'next', 'also', 'like', 'athlete', 'not', 'twig']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659188,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00DLX766Y,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[18, 20]","NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.Yoga instructor Ashley Turner has been featured in several previous Element yoga videos, including another DVD with a title very similar to this one,Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility.  This DVD has two routines of approximately 30 minutes in length, with Turner practicing alone in an attractive poolside garden setting showcasing the Pacific ocean in the background. She teaches via voiceover and provides mirrored cuing, using a combination of Sanskrit and English terminology.  Her only prop is her yoga mat, and throughout each practice, she mentions modifications for some of the postures (sometimes shown in inset).The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:*Play Yoga for Strength*Play Yoga for Flexibility*Play MeditationI have broken down each of the practices in greater detail below (times are approximate).YOGA FOR STRENGTH (33.5m)Turner begins standing, with a focus on breath and setting an intention (sankalpa).  For a warm-up, she performs some neck rolls.  Coming to the head of the mat, she moves from a forward bend to plank to side plank, with long holds of the latter on either side.  Transitioning through low cobra and down dog, Turner comes to a lying position for core work, including several variations of crunch/leg lower moves with the legs in the air.  Following the core work, Turner rocks up to a squat position and then into a standing forward bend.  Next is a crescent lunge series where Turner moves in and out of the lunge, adding arm movements, and then continuing into warrior 3 and standing splits.  She performs a chair sequence before repeating the crescent series on the second side.  Turner concludes the standing work with warrior 2 and side angle postures.  She then returns to the floor for what she calls ""bow"" pose (actually a version of locust) and more abdominal work, lowering and lifting into boat pose.  Returning to the back, she performs boat pose with the option of going up into wheel ""if you are familiar with the pose.""  The final posture is a cross-leg twist, and Turner concludes the practice with a short (1 minute) savasana before returning to seated for an affirmation and single ""ohm.""YOGA FOR FLEXIBILITY (31.5m)Turner again opens by initiating ujjayi breathing and engaging in a few stretches, including neck rolls, arm rolls, and side bends.  She then encourages setting a sankalpa that focuses on flexibility, and she chants a single ""ohm.""  Continuing the standing warm-ups, she moves from standing to a squat position to generate some heat, then performs hip circles.  Using a half sun salutation, she transitions to hands and knees.  From this position, Turner moves through thread-the-needle, cat/cow, leg extensions, and hydrant hip circles.  Next she starts with runner's lunge, comes up to pyramid pose, and then opens up into triangle pose.  For the second side, she takes these postures in reverse order, and the transitions felt awkward to me.  Wide-legged stretches follow, including an inner thigh stretch and a twist; Turner then gradually moves into lateral splits.  The final postures include revolved head-to-knee and twisting forward bend.  This time, the affirmation is included as part of the savasana (1.5 minutes) before concluding seated.MEDITATION (7.5m)This is a guided, mindfulness-based meditation practice.  Turner provides instruction for finding a comfortable seated position and arranging the hands comfortably as well.  She encourages use of a ""witness mind"" throughout the practice.  Turner recommends engaging in meditation on a daily basis.As an instructor, Turner is pleasant and encouraging.  While her practices do not provide a level of teaching that would be sufficient for those completely new to yoga, these routines are likely to appeal to yoga students within a wide range of experience levels.  Personally, I did not enjoy the overall flow of the practices on this DVD, which was disappointing since I do particularly like Turner'sElement: Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility.  However, this may be an idiosyncratic preference--other users may find that they prefer this newer release.",4,Two yoga practices with a mix of stronger and more relaxing postures,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,4285,"['NOTE', 'received', 'free', 'copy', 'DVD', 'review', 'web', 'site', 'Metapsychology', 'Online', 'Reviews', 'can', 'read', 'more', 'complete', 'version', 'review', 'site.Yoga', 'instructor', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'been', 'featured', 'several', 'previous', 'Element', 'yoga', 'videos', 'including', 'DVD', 'title', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'Element', 'Yoga', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Flexibility', 'DVD', 'two', 'routines', 'approximately', '30', 'minutes', 'length', 'Turner', 'practicing', 'alone', 'attractive', 'poolside', 'garden', 'setting', 'showcasing', 'Pacific', 'ocean', 'background', 'voiceover', 'mirrored', 'cuing', 'using', 'combination', 'Sanskrit', 'English', 'terminology', 'only', 'prop', 'yoga', 'mat', 'practice', 'modifications', 'postures', 'sometimes', 'shown', 'inset', '.The', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'following', 'options', '*Play', 'Yoga', 'Strength*Play', 'Yoga', 'Flexibility*Play', 'MeditationI', 'have', 'broken', 'down', 'practices', 'greater', 'detail', 'times', 'are', 'approximate', '.YOGA', 'FOR', 'STRENGTH', '33.5m', 'Turner', 'standing', 'focus', 'breath', 'setting', 'intention', 'sankalpa', 'warm-up', 'neck', 'rolls', 'Coming', 'head', 'mat', 'forward', 'bend', 'plank', 'side', 'plank', 'long', 'latter', 'side', 'Transitioning', 'low', 'cobra', 'down', 'dog', 'Turner', 'lying', 'position', 'core', 'work', 'including', 'several', 'variations', 'crunch/leg', 'lower', 'moves', 'legs', 'air', 'Following', 'core', 'work', 'Turner', 'up', 'squat', 'position', 'then', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'Next', 'crescent', 'lunge', 'series', 'where', 'Turner', 'lunge', 'adding', 'arm', 'movements', 'then', 'continuing', 'warrior', '3', 'standing', 'splits', 'chair', 'sequence', 'repeating', 'crescent', 'series', 'second', 'side', 'Turner', 'standing', 'work', 'warrior', '2', 'side', 'angle', 'postures', 'then', 'floor', 'what', 'bow', 'pose', 'actually', 'version', 'locust', 'more', 'abdominal', 'work', 'lowering', 'lifting', 'boat', 'pose', 'Returning', 'back', 'boat', 'pose', 'option', 'going', 'up', 'wheel', 'are', 'familiar', 'pose', 'final', 'posture', 'cross-leg', 'twist', 'Turner', 'practice', 'short', '1', 'minute', 'savasana', 'returning', 'seated', 'affirmation', 'single', 'ohm', 'YOGA', 'FOR', 'FLEXIBILITY', '31.5m', 'Turner', 'again', 'initiating', 'ujjayi', 'breathing', 'engaging', 'few', 'stretches', 'including', 'neck', 'rolls', 'arm', 'rolls', 'side', 'bends', 'then', 'setting', 'sankalpa', 'flexibility', 'single', 'ohm', 'Continuing', 'standing', 'warm-ups', 'standing', 'squat', 'position', 'generate', 'heat', 'then', 'hip', 'circles', 'Using', 'half', 'sun', 'salutation', 'hands', 'knees', 'position', 'Turner', 'thread-the-needle', 'cat/cow', 'leg', 'extensions', 'hydrant', 'hip', 'circles', 'Next', 'runner', 'lunge', 'up', 'pyramid', 'pose', 'then', 'up', 'triangle', 'pose', 'second', 'side', 'postures', 'reverse', 'order', 'transitions', 'felt', 'awkward', 'Wide-legged', 'stretches', 'follow', 'including', 'inner', 'thigh', 'stretch', 'twist', 'Turner', 'then', 'gradually', 'lateral', 'splits', 'final', 'postures', 'include', 'revolved', 'head-to-knee', 'twisting', 'forward', 'bend', 'time', 'affirmation', 'included', 'part', 'savasana', '1.5', 'minutes', 'concluding', 'seated.MEDITATION', '7.5m', 'guided', 'mindfulness-based', 'meditation', 'practice', 'Turner', 'instruction', 'finding', 'comfortable', 'seated', 'position', 'arranging', 'hands', 'comfortably', 'as', 'well', 'use', 'witness', 'mind', 'practice', 'Turner', 'engaging', 'meditation', 'daily', 'basis.As', 'instructor', 'Turner', 'pleasant', 'encouraging', 'practices', 'do', 'not', 'provide', 'level', 'teaching', 'would', 'be', 'sufficient', 'completely', 'new', 'yoga', 'routines', 'are', 'likely', 'appeal', 'yoga', 'students', 'wide', 'range', 'experience', 'levels', 'Personally', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'overall', 'flow', 'practices', 'DVD', 'was', 'disappointing', 'do', 'particularly', ""Turner'sElement"", 'Yoga', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'Flexibility', 'However', 'may', 'be', 'idiosyncratic', 'preference', 'other', 'users', 'may', 'find', 'prefer', 'newer', 'release']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility

My 1st ever review on Amazon in 2004 was Hemalaya Behl's Yoga for Urban LivingHemalaya Behl: Yoga for Urban Livingand is still a classic 10 years later...I still use it several times throughout the year! This new (2013) yoga dvd by Ashley Turner will surely become a classic in my collection!I primarily use the 30 minute flexibility practice along with the 8 minute seated meditation afterwards. Those are the 2 practices I am reviewing. There is a 3rd practice,  30 minute strengthening, and it is quite good as well. I tend to do my strength training using free weights and equipment at my local gym, but for many people, they will enjoy the 3rd practice too.This video is probably not appropriate if you are a beginner and have never had any exposure to yoga. I would recommend taking an instructor lead class if you are complete novice. There is not a lot of instruction on this video, yet good queues to keep you in sync with the practice. If you are fairly familiar with yoga and an advanced beginner or intermediate, you will love this practice. Even advanced yogi's or instructors can definitely pick up some beyond the basic approaches and ideas.The music is really nice and new-agey. It's a little loud for my liking as I have to turn up the volume to hear Ashley's voice. I only wish there was a music volume control or even a way to turn the music off. I like the music, it's just a bit too loud. Ashely gives moderate instruction, doesn't over-talk, and queues are easy to follow without looking up. Ashley has a beautiful, soothing, reassuring voice. Her routine is one of those life-long sequences that you can hang on to and even mix in your own postures. In some cases (during the seated side and forward bends) I have diverted into postures that feel right to me for that day, then pick back up into Ashley's routine. This is a routine you can easily learn and practice without the video after a while. Copy my text below and it's an easy way to take this practice with you for travel or even to your neighborhood park.Here's the lineup on the 30 minute flexibility practice:This is a slow pace, flowing and stretching sequence with a lot of breath and movement. Ashley reminds you to saturate your body with your breath. It's very unique, yet practical and effective. I love it that Ashley uses Sankalpa to set intension (you don't see that much on yoga dvd's) and then reminds you towards the end of the practice to come back to that intension. Most of the practice is standing with a bit of all fours and seated, no lying down postures (except savasana). The pace is perfect, slow and methodical, yet lots of variety to keep you from getting bored. This practice will open your awareness to your intuition of your body's needs and give you an excellent start to your day.1. First 10 minutes are preformed standing, starting with breathing and centering with Ujjayi Breathing for just a minute.2. Energizing arm circles with body rounding, slow and easy (excellent opening for the body).3. Clasping hands overhead with palms out, side bends..film editing OOPS...switches midstream to palms together with pointed, steeple index finger (the queue is for pointed index finger). Funny little slip up if you catch it on the video :) Then side bend to other side, still with steeple index finger. Moving and breathing back and forth slowly.4. Still standing, slight backbend, holding, squeezing and focused breathing.5. Feet together, focusing on feet, widening, stable.6. 5 minutes into standing practice: Sankalpa (setting your intention for the practice). Also sets your focus for the day and an excellent addition to starting the practice, seldom found on yoga DVD's.7. Brief, single, Ohmmmmmm....8. 6 minutes into standing practice: Squats, then moving from standing to squats with breathing. Great to warm up the whole body. Then faster (to open Kundalini Energy!)9. Forward bending, holding. Notice your body with long inhale/exhale.10. Rolling up, then rag doll to standing cat/cow movements.11. Hip circles (bent over). These are so good for warming up the hips. Nice, unique movement!12. Horizontal butterfly opening to hugging with movement.  Again, a very unique opener!13. Front of the mat, 1/2 sun salutation (short). Love it! I get so bored with the same 'ol, never ending sun salutations in other dvd's ;-)14. 10 minutes into practice, downward dog, briefly. Again, happy to see it's just brief. Downward dog is a lot of times so over-done in other videos ;-)15. Hands and knees (on all fours), shoulder opening twists with movement, then holding and stretching. On one side of the body only.16. Cat/Cow movements.17. Still on all fours, 1 leg extended, then rounding forward crunches, movement. On one side of the body only.18. Wonderful hip opener with 1 leg out to the side, rotating deep into the hip joint. On one side of the body only.19. Now switching to the other side, leg extending (same as #17), hip opener (same as #18), then 1 leg extension with forward crunches (same as  #15)20. Half-way into practice (15 minutes), lunge and shaking hips up and down for movement.21. Then straighten front leg for deep stretching of the hamstring first with movement, then holding. This should help with any lower back pain you have by opening your hamstring. One one side of the body only.22. Slowly move into Triangle pose. On one side of the body only.23. Forward side leg twists (holding) on both sides of the body.24. Lunges to other side (same as #21)25. Horizontal Splits (wide leg, bent over). Nice alternative for those who struggle with traditional splits. (At this point, beginners, please be aware that you need to go to your own comfort level. My only critique is there could have been additional students in the video to show beginner level postures.)26. 23 minutes into the practice, hand & knees, to sitting momentarily.27. 1 leg out to the side, keep the other leg bent in, bend knee arm out to the side, stretch, then side bend towards the outstretched leg, torso spinning up. Holding. Breathing. (This is the posture where I tend to do my own thing, depending how I feel, what my body is telling me it needs). Ashely gets into a very advance side bend holding her foot and side twisting...please, beginners, don't feel you have to be there and definitely don't push it here or you will hurt yourself (again, a critique, it would have been helpful to have students showing beginner level posture).28. Then, square hips and 1 legged forward bend with movement, then holding.29. Now, repeat #27 and #28 on the other side.30. Come to cross legged sitting. I love this...come back to your original intension (Sankalpa). Flexibility, go with the flow of your life. I could so connect with this!31. at 28 minutes. Lye down on your back with knees bent, feet on the floor, do some windshield wipers. (Feels so good!)32. Arms and legs outstretch...Savasana (for little over 1 minute only).33. At 30-1/2 minutes come back up to sitting crossed legged, hands to your heart. Thank yourself and be here and now. So perfect. I L-O-V-E this practice. Resonates in my heart. I hope it does in yours too.Here's the sequence on the 8 minute meditation practice:This is one of the best, quick, beautiful meditations I've found that is the perfect way to start your day by feeling calm and centered. It will help you open to the world of meditation. I only wish this audio was available on iTunes for download so I could take it traveling or to the park.1. Sitting cross legged2. Brief reminder from Ashley on how to sit and position3. Hands on knees either face up or face down4. Begin with breathing by inhaling to the crown and exhale to the base. Beautiful, calming, focus on breathing. Repeated and guidance several times.5. Then breathing widening chest on inhale, hold that expansion, and soften to exhale. Repeated and guidance several times.6. 3 minutes into practice, sitting still, listening, sensing your body, temperature. Become aware through mindfulness and attention. Ashley walks you through it with her beautiful, calming voice and makes it so easy.7. Notice the world outside. Notice the world inside yourself.8. Then, just witnessing your thoughts, observing. At one point Ashley says ""Just because you think a thought doesn't mean it's true"" and ""think the thought you choose to invest in"" really resonated with me...so true!9. 6 minutes into practice.  Ashley continues to walk you through the ""witness mind"" letting thoughts fall away and dissolve, breathing effortlessly.10. At the end, Ashley brings you out slowly and gently, hands to heart, thanking yourself for showing up. She reminds you of calmness and clearness and trusting your path.What I really like is Ashley's presences. She is not the typical super-skinny model. She has an average build and radiates calmness and acceptance that you can soak in and carry yourself throughout the day after her practice. She has a lovely, calming voice and leads the practice with clear, concise queues.Cost: $15 is a reasonable price.  The cost of an average single-session yoga class would cost you this much, however you will use this DVD over and over. You will definitely get your money's worth out of this DVD. Even if you're just after a really good meditation, in it's self a great price!Ashley Turner has a few other Element yoga dvd's. One of them, Yoga for Stress Relief & Flexibility, is one I would really like to try and hopefully will review in the future.Element: Yoga for Stress Relief & FlexibilityOne other comment/note on the meditation. I truly believe that you are better off doing a short meditation everyday over a long meditation only occasionally. In short meditations you can easily learn how to turn your brain off and be there in the moment, even for a glimpse it will open your world and improve your life. I also highly recommend Deepak Chopra FREE 21-day mediation which he offers on-line 2 times a year. Just google it to find the next offering.Please check my other yoga dvd reviews.

I have done yoga on and off for years but my daughters are new to it so this DVD worked well for us. I like that we can choose just the flexibility or strength sessions for a shorter workout. The flexibility has been espeically nice to do in the evening to help us wind down. But when we have time for a full workout, we can do both sessions together. The instructor was easy to follow and had a nice calming voice. THe flexibility was a little disappointing to my daughters who are working their way into the splits that there wasn't more hip/leg flexibility. A pigeon pose would have been nice.

I would recommend this to intermediate exercisers.  The set is very relaxing, in a garden type setting overlooking the ocean.  The strength segment is good and you definitely do feel it when you are trying to hold that plank position!  I enjoyed the flexibility section even more-I felt like I was a washcloth that had been wrung out after I did it.  The stretches felt great and were a little different than your average yoga stretches.  The video is done in voice-over, which can be annoying to some, but I didn't have any issue with that.  She instructs well and is very deliberate in her form and explaining the positions.  Her voice is pleasant as is the unintrusive, soft background music.  The video contains two workouts of about 30 minutes and about a 7 minute meditation.  I really liked that!  Maybe one of my new resolutions will be to try to do that 7 minute meditation daily to ground and center myself.

You'll never ever do any of that.It's going to sit on the DVD shelf unopened.But it is for strength and flexibility, I need to work on those before anything else!So yeah, I ordered it.

I also have some health issues that warrant Yoga but also make some of it more difficult (Multiple Sclerosis and Fibromyalgia).  Ashley presents some options for various poses that provide a lighter and less stressful pose for muscles that might be tight or in spasm.  All of it should be taken with a grain of salt and worked at with one's own comfort level.I enjoyed Ashley's voice, tone and pace.  Following along was very doable even if working on some of the poses and exercises is a bit beyond my reach right now.  I have hopes that in time, I will be able to do some of these poses.  The music was soothing, the setting for the DVD is gorgeous and a great vacation away from the soon to be Winter doldrums of Upstate New York.  I enjoyed the meditation as much as I did the two programs.  I see great potential for this Yoga program and I look forward to using it often and gaining some flexibility and strength.In my opinion, this DVD is done very well and seems geared towards the beginner to intermediate Yogi.

I am also female and in my 50s, so I have to be careful about what types of exercise programs I start. So I am approaching this DVD (and this review) as a yoga novice who definitely isn't ready to bend into any pretzel shapes. If you are an experienced yoga devotee you might have a different reaction to the DVD.If you're like me, prepare to be a little sore-- but also prepare to notice immediately improvement in your muscle tone.  My suggestion is that you watch the workouts at least once before you try to do them.  That way you'll be more familiar with her instructions if you're in a posture where it wouldn't be good to turn your neck to try to watch the TV.What I really liked about this DVD:1. The teacher is also a psychotherapist and she includes some nice imagery and thought suggestions during the programs.  For instance, during the strength section, she encourages you to focus on a place in your life where you need to build up mental or emotional strength.2. The workouts are about 30 minutes each and are done slowly and carefully with good explanations about posture.  I felt comfortable taking them at my own pace.3. There are two 30-minute workouts: one focuses on strength and one on flexibility.  You can do one per day or try one in the morning and the other in the evening- whatever works for your schedule. I have been doing one workout a day-- and because I've only been doing this for about a week, I pause throughout to give my muscles a break.4. The teacher uses a conversational style, talking to you throughout the workout.  I could see where a more experienced person might feel she talks too much, but it is just right for me. She has a pleasant voice.5. The 7-minute meditation at the end is nice.  It's a calm breathing session which focuses on mindfulness.6. It's quick, easy, and simple.  The moves are not complicated and there is no need for extra equipment other than some sort of non-slip mat.I can't think of any downside to this workout.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to start a workout program and is looking for a way to build up strength and flexibility.",5,Great for those who want to get back in shape,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,2218,"['Let', 'preface', 'review', 'saying', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'working', 'out', 'awhile', 'so', 'am', 'out-of-shape', 'am', 'also', 'female', '50s', 'so', 'have', 'be', 'careful', 'what', 'types', 'exercise', 'programs', 'start', 'So', 'am', 'approaching', 'DVD', 'review', 'yoga', 'novice', 'who', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'ready', 'bend', 'pretzel', 'shapes', 'are', 'experienced', 'yoga', 'devotee', 'might', 'have', 'different', 'reaction', 'DVD.If', ""'re"", 'prepare', 'be', 'little', 'sore', 'also', 'prepare', 'notice', 'immediately', 'improvement', 'muscle', 'tone', 'suggestion', 'watch', 'workouts', 'least', 'once', 'try', 'do', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'familiar', 'instructions', ""'re"", 'posture', 'where', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'turn', 'neck', 'try', 'watch', 'TV.What', 'really', 'liked', 'DVD:1', 'teacher', 'also', 'psychotherapist', 'nice', 'imagery', 'thought', 'suggestions', 'programs', 'instance', 'strength', 'section', 'focus', 'place', 'life', 'where', 'need', 'build', 'up', 'mental', 'emotional', 'strength.2', 'workouts', 'are', '30', 'minutes', 'are', 'done', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'good', 'explanations', 'posture', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'taking', 'own', 'pace.3', 'are', 'two', '30-minute', 'workouts', 'one', 'strength', 'one', 'flexibility', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'day', 'try', 'one', 'morning', 'other', 'evening-', 'works', 'schedule', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'one', 'workout', 'day', ""'ve"", 'only', 'been', 'doing', 'week', 'pause', 'give', 'muscles', 'break.4', 'teacher', 'conversational', 'style', 'talking', 'workout', 'could', 'see', 'where', 'more', 'experienced', 'person', 'might', 'feel', 'talks', 'too', 'much', 'just', 'right', 'pleasant', 'voice.5', '7-minute', 'meditation', 'end', 'nice', 'calm', 'breathing', 'session', 'mindfulness.6', 'quick', 'easy', 'simple', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'complicated', 'need', 'extra', 'equipment', 'other', 'sort', 'non-slip', 'mat.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'downside', 'workout', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'start', 'workout', 'program', 'looking', 'way', 'build', 'up', 'strength', 'flexibility']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659199,A96AUNSF6GESO,B00DLX766Y,Janeite,"[0, 2]","First the disclaimer: I have NEVER done yoga in any way, shape, or form before receiving this dvd. The short version of my review is in the title; having never done any yoga before I found much in these routines to be difficult if not impossible for me to do. Seeing as how I just received it, I can not say whether I would improve with practice. My general sense is that, as an absolute beginner, these routines are not really for me. I would be better off trying something particularly for those with zero yoga experience.Now here's the longer version. I am a reasonably fit (I run, do Zumba, and hike), and not overweight wife and mom in my mid-40s. I have dabbled a bit in Pilates and found that I like it. It's very relaxing and leaves me feeling energized after. I have heard so many wonderful things about yoga that I've always wanted to try it, so I jumped on this dvd when it became available through Vine. Now after having tried it, I think it's too advanced for a novice such as myself. I honestly haven't decided if I'm going to keep working on it (the introduction recommends practicing 3 to 4 times a week) or give up since I find it quite comical to try and do these routines. The first routine, for strength, starts right off with the trainer, Ashley Turner, doing moves I can not possibly do. She spends a lot of time in the plank position and rotates onto one side being supported by only one hand. I do not have the strength in my shoulders to do this at all, much less when I factor in the severe neck injury I sustained several years ago that still affects my neck and shoulders. I can not guess when or if I might ever be able to do these plank things and yoga pushups, not to mention the back bends and pretzel-like twists Ms. Turner can contort her body into. I don't think I got much out of gawking at her while she did the movement, either. She also did some moves while balanced on one foot, and I couldn't do those either. The stretching routine started out a good bit easier for me The routines are all slow and calming, and the stretching one was nice until she again started doing things I could only gawk at (the move she called ""thread-the -needle"" was particularly tricky for me). So, overall, the level of difficulty might be fine for someone with yoga experience, but for a stone-cold beginner, I was definitely out of my league.Also, I feel I must add that I am so unfamiliar with the whole yoga world that many words and concepts Ms. Turner used sounded like mumbo-jumbo to me. She used quite a few Indian-sounding words that I have no idea what they meant, and then she talked about things like how meditation would allow me to""observe more subtle nuances in the outer world."" Honestly, I wasn't sure I knew what she was talking about half the time, probably because of my incredible of ignorance of yoga, its methods, or terminology. Other reviews by experienced practitioners can speak more to how others might experience this dvd, but I must warn absolute beginners that they might want to consider beginning somewhere else than with this dvd.",3,Difficult for this beginner,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,3085,"['First', 'disclaimer', 'have', 'NEVER', 'done', 'yoga', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'receiving', 'dvd', 'short', 'version', 'review', 'title', 'having', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'found', 'much', 'routines', 'be', 'difficult', 'not', 'impossible', 'do', 'Seeing', 'how', 'just', 'received', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'would', 'improve', 'practice', 'general', 'sense', 'that', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'routines', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'trying', 'something', 'particularly', 'zero', 'yoga', 'experience.Now', 'here', 'longer', 'version', 'am', 'reasonably', 'fit', 'run', 'do', 'Zumba', 'hike', 'not', 'overweight', 'wife', 'mom', 'mid-40s', 'have', 'dabbled', 'bit', 'Pilates', 'found', 'like', 'very', 'relaxing', 'feeling', 'energized', 'have', 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'yoga', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'try', 'so', 'jumped', 'dvd', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'Vine', 'Now', 'having', 'tried', 'think', 'too', 'advanced', 'novice', 'such', 'honestly', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', ""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'working', 'introduction', 'practicing', '3', '4', 'times', 'week', 'give', 'up', 'find', 'quite', 'comical', 'try', 'do', 'routines', 'first', 'routine', 'strength', 'starts', 'right', 'off', 'trainer', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'doing', 'moves', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'do', 'lot', 'time', 'plank', 'position', 'one', 'side', 'being', 'supported', 'only', 'one', 'hand', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'strength', 'shoulders', 'do', 'much', 'less', 'when', 'factor', 'severe', 'neck', 'injury', 'sustained', 'several', 'years', 'still', 'neck', 'shoulders', 'can', 'not', 'guess', 'when', 'might', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'plank', 'things', 'yoga', 'pushups', 'not', 'mention', 'back', 'bends', 'pretzel-like', 'twists', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'can', 'contort', 'body', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'much', 'gawking', 'did', 'movement', 'either', 'also', 'did', 'moves', 'balanced', 'one', 'foot', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'stretching', 'routine', 'started', 'out', 'good', 'bit', 'easier', 'routines', 'are', 'slow', 'calming', 'stretching', 'one', 'was', 'nice', 'again', 'started', 'doing', 'things', 'could', 'only', 'gawk', 'move', 'called', 'thread-the', '-needle', 'was', 'particularly', 'tricky', 'So', 'overall', 'level', 'difficulty', 'might', 'be', 'fine', 'someone', 'yoga', 'experience', 'stone-cold', 'beginner', 'was', 'definitely', 'league.Also', 'feel', 'must', 'add', 'am', 'so', 'unfamiliar', 'whole', 'yoga', 'world', 'many', 'words', 'concepts', 'Ms.', 'Turner', 'used', 'sounded', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'used', 'quite', 'few', 'Indian-sounding', 'words', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'meant', 'then', 'talked', 'things', 'how', 'meditation', 'would', 'allow', 'observe', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'outer', 'world', 'Honestly', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'time', 'probably', 'incredible', 'ignorance', 'yoga', 'methods', 'terminology', 'Other', 'reviews', 'experienced', 'practitioners', 'can', 'speak', 'more', 'how', 'others', 'might', 'experience', 'dvd', 'must', 'warn', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'beginning', 'somewhere', 'else', 'dvd']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659200,A2AWDN78GY6WNM,B00DLX766Y,Jerry Larson,"[1, 6]","Some reviewers have mentioned that the setting of the DVD is not what's shown on the cover; the package shows the instructor in a white outfit in on a white beach, but in the DVD she's wearing a pink top and working out in a grassy garden.  I don't understand why this is a problem, but I suggest the reason for it is probably that she uses the same picture on all her products, but doesn't always wear the same clothes or use the same location.  Just guessing.I will say that both the background and the music are a little distracting, but generally, the DVD is very well done.  It's not for beginners at all, and doesn't make that claim.  It's done at speed, with lots of reminders of proper technique, but no basic instruction.I watch it with closed-captions on, and when she says ""Om"", the captions spell it ""ohm"", which is ridiculous; that's a unit of electrical resistance, not a mystical sound.  If that's my worst complaint, though, I have no complaint.  (But I do have some complaints).Other reviewers have also mentioned that this DVD is not for beginners, which is certainly true.  I'm, for all practical purposes, a beginner, so it's probably not going to work for me-- if it does work out, I'll come back and change this review.  I've done a little yoga a long time ago, it's not strange to me, but I'm definitely not good at actually doing it-- in fact the really hard part is getting myself to actually do it.  It's something that, though natural, is also very foreign to one's way of being--until it isn't.I know this lady has other products, perhaps including beginner's instruction.  Maybe this DVD is better understood in that context.So here are the issues I have:--I don't think much of the bonus meditation.  It just seems like a lot of vague New Age buzzwords to me.  We're told to improve the skillfulness and sublety, ""nuances"", of our perception, but not how to do that.  You can listen to this stuff, or tune out on it, and think you've meditated, but I think if you actually want to meditate, it would be better to learn one or more meditation techniques--mantra, breath counting, something that gives you something to return to when the mind wanders.  I understand that in hatha yoga you don't dare say anything overtly Hindu or spiritual, have to bend over backwards (no pun) to keep it secular; and it certainly is possible to meditate without religious content; but I just don't think listening to this ""meditation"" is the same thing as meditating.  Meditation requires effort-- or noneffort, which is even more difficult-- and it's not the same as spacing out with a gentle voice in your ears.--I question the whole concept of one workout for strength and another for flexibility.  It would seem to me that hatha yoga develops strength and flexibility together, along with what you might call peacefulness, relaxation, poise or stress relief, and a more sensible organization would be easier and more difficult routines, or routines that focus on particular joints or movements.  I find that the ""flexibility"" section has more strength work in it than the ""strength"" routine: squats, lunges, back extension, etc.  There are ""yoga pushups"" (whatever that is; looks like regular pushups to me, but only three of them, so I don't see the point) in the strength section, so OK, that's a strength exercise, but I just don't get it.  If you want to do pushups, fine, do some pushups,  but not just three.  Actually, the ""flexibility"" section, in my opinion, requires more strength,  as well as more flexibility, than the other one.  A lot of the twisting movements will develop flexibility, I'm sure, and in a dynamic fashion, which I approve of, but they require a lot of strength.I'm sure this is a good workout, either section of it, if you know how to do these moves already.  I may actually give it a try for a few weeks, and if so, I'll report.",4,"Pretty good, but....",1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,3877,"['reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'setting', 'DVD', 'not', 'what', 'shown', 'cover', 'package', 'instructor', 'white', 'outfit', 'white', 'beach', 'DVD', 'wearing', 'pink', 'top', 'working', 'out', 'grassy', 'garden', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'problem', 'suggest', 'reason', 'probably', 'same', 'picture', 'products', ""n't"", 'always', 'wear', 'same', 'clothes', 'use', 'same', 'location', 'Just', 'guessing.I', 'will', 'say', 'background', 'music', 'are', 'little', 'distracting', 'generally', 'DVD', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'beginners', ""n't"", 'make', 'claim', 'done', 'speed', 'lots', 'reminders', 'proper', 'technique', 'basic', 'instruction.I', 'watch', 'closed-captions', 'when', 'Om', 'captions', 'spell', 'ohm', 'ridiculous', 'unit', 'electrical', 'resistance', 'not', 'mystical', 'sound', 'worst', 'complaint', 'have', 'complaint', 'do', 'have', 'complaints', '.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'also', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'not', 'beginners', 'certainly', 'true', ""'m"", 'practical', 'purposes', 'beginner', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'work', 'out', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'change', 'review', ""'ve"", 'done', 'little', 'yoga', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'not', 'strange', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'good', 'actually', 'doing', 'fact', 'really', 'hard', 'part', 'getting', 'actually', 'do', 'something', 'natural', 'also', 'very', 'foreign', 'one', 'way', 'being', 'know', 'lady', 'other', 'products', 'perhaps', 'including', 'beginner', 'instruction', 'Maybe', 'DVD', 'better', 'understood', 'context.So', 'here', 'are', 'issues', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'bonus', 'meditation', 'just', 'lot', 'vague', 'New', 'Age', 'buzzwords', ""'re"", 'told', 'improve', 'skillfulness', 'sublety', 'nuances', 'perception', 'not', 'how', 'do', 'can', 'listen', 'stuff', 'out', 'think', ""'ve"", 'meditated', 'think', 'actually', 'want', 'meditate', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'learn', 'one', 'more', 'meditation', 'techniques', 'mantra', 'breath', 'counting', 'something', 'something', 'return', 'when', 'mind', 'wanders', 'understand', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'say', 'anything', 'overtly', 'Hindu', 'spiritual', 'have', 'bend', 'backwards', 'pun', 'keep', 'secular', 'certainly', 'possible', 'meditate', 'religious', 'content', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'listening', 'meditation', 'same', 'thing', 'meditating', 'Meditation', 'effort', 'noneffort', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'not', 'same', 'spacing', 'out', 'gentle', 'voice', 'ears.', 'question', 'whole', 'concept', 'one', 'workout', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'would', 'seem', 'hatha', 'yoga', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'together', 'what', 'might', 'call', 'peacefulness', 'relaxation', 'poise', 'stress', 'relief', 'more', 'sensible', 'organization', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'more', 'difficult', 'routines', 'routines', 'focus', 'particular', 'joints', 'movements', 'find', 'flexibility', 'section', 'more', 'strength', 'work', 'strength', 'routine', 'squats', 'lunges', 'back', 'extension', 'etc', 'are', 'yoga', 'pushups', 'looks', 'regular', 'pushups', 'only', 'three', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'point', 'strength', 'section', 'so', 'OK', 'strength', 'exercise', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'want', 'do', 'pushups', 'fine', 'do', 'pushups', 'not', 'just', 'three', 'Actually', 'flexibility', 'section', 'opinion', 'more', 'strength', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'flexibility', 'other', 'one', 'lot', 'twisting', 'movements', 'will', 'develop', 'flexibility', ""'m"", 'sure', 'dynamic', 'fashion', 'approve', 'require', 'lot', 'strength.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'good', 'workout', 'section', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'already', 'may', 'actually', 'give', 'try', 'few', 'weeks', 'so', ""'ll"", 'report']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility

This dvd provides a decently challenging Strength workout followed by a nice relaxing Flexibility session.  I love to do them back to back.  The first lets you work up a nice sweat whithout wearing you out followed by a nice soothing session that that leaves you feeling relaxed yet invigorated.The instructor is clear and easy to follow and does a good job of focusing on breath and the more meditative side of yoga.  This is essential to me in a Yoga workout.You will  need to have a basic understanding of poses and proper form but I think this is a great dvd for a wide range of people from beginner to advanced.

What she makes look easy is still a work in progress for me.  Thanks to this video, I am getting there, but that nose to knee thing is still a challenge.I have never tried yoga before, but when I saw this video offered sections on both strength and flexibility, I figured why not.  My aging body is starting to protest and just stretching and moving seems to help grease the sticky parts.Having read prior reviews I was concerned, was I supposed to know more about yoga going in or was, as I was hoping, this a good jumping off point.In the beginning of the video, Ashley explains how you can do the two sections either together or separately, well, I voted for separately.  I wanted flexibility.  So here we go.What I love is that she emphasizes the need to listen to your body by listening to your breath, work at your own pace and take breaks when you need to.  This was a great ""permission"" so I did not feel overwhelmed and intimidated.  Three or four times per week for optimal health - I could do that.You are easily walked through each movement, by using both the ""official"" yoga terminology and the easier to understand descriptions.After the first session, I was not sure that I had gotten anything out of it.  That was until I tried to get out of bed the next morning.  I was sore from shoulders to ankles.  I had received more of a workout then I had thought.I have only been using this video for a couple of weeks, and am a long way from moving like her, but I can definitely feel the difference that this video is making.After the exercises, the guided meditation section is a nice way of ending the session.If you are an advanced yoga aficionado this might be too basic for you, but for us beginners, it was perfect.",5,Helps with the sticky parts,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,1802,"['think', 'will', 'be', 'life', 'goal', 'be', 'as', 'flexible', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'What', 'look', 'easy', 'still', 'work', 'progress', 'Thanks', 'video', 'am', 'getting', 'there', 'nose', 'knee', 'thing', 'still', 'challenge.I', 'have', 'never', 'tried', 'yoga', 'when', 'saw', 'video', 'offered', 'sections', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'figured', 'why', 'not', 'aging', 'body', 'starting', 'protest', 'just', 'stretching', 'moving', 'help', 'grease', 'sticky', 'parts.Having', 'read', 'prior', 'reviews', 'was', 'concerned', 'was', 'supposed', 'know', 'more', 'yoga', 'going', 'was', 'was', 'hoping', 'good', 'jumping', 'point.In', 'beginning', 'video', 'Ashley', 'how', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'sections', 'together', 'separately', 'well', 'voted', 'separately', 'wanted', 'flexibility', 'So', 'here', 'go.What', 'love', 'need', 'listen', 'body', 'listening', 'breath', 'work', 'own', 'pace', 'take', 'breaks', 'when', 'need', 'was', 'great', 'permission', 'so', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'overwhelmed', 'intimidated', 'Three', 'four', 'times', 'week', 'optimal', 'health', 'could', 'do', 'that.You', 'are', 'easily', 'walked', 'movement', 'using', 'official', 'yoga', 'terminology', 'easier', 'understand', 'descriptions.After', 'first', 'session', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'had', 'gotten', 'anything', 'was', 'tried', 'get', 'bed', 'next', 'morning', 'was', 'sore', 'shoulders', 'ankles', 'had', 'received', 'more', 'workout', 'then', 'had', 'thought.I', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'using', 'video', 'couple', 'weeks', 'am', 'long', 'way', 'moving', 'can', 'definitely', 'feel', 'difference', 'video', 'making.After', 'exercises', 'guided', 'meditation', 'section', 'nice', 'way', 'ending', 'session.If', 'are', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'aficionado', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'basic', 'beginners', 'was', 'perfect']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659206,A32HAMICRE52M,B00DLX766Y,Pippa Lee,"[1, 2]","It's been awhile since a yoga workout has left me sore.  When my tighs, calves and butt started to ""complain"" just after I finished the first workout of Ashley Turner's Yoga for Strength and Flexibility, I felt that this was one that has really worked my muscles.Yoga for Strength targets the core muscles, upper body and will challenge your balance. This workout lasts about 33 minutes and just right about from the start you will find yourself moving through plank pose, side plank with one arm up, push-ups and about three variations of abdominal curls. All of that is included in the first 11 minutes of the workout. Next come the standing exercises with crescent pose variations that transition into warrior 3 pose and move to standing split pose. From there, you will do traditional chair pose and a variation that requires you to do it on the balls of your feet.  The final group of exercises involve warrior 2, extended warrior pose, bow, boat and wheel poses.The goal of Yoga for Flexibility is to stretch the shoulders, hips, hamstrings and back.  This 32-minute practice starts with head rolls, then to doing backstrokes and butterfly strokes with the arms, moving to a gentle standing back bend and then to squats.  Half sun salutations bring you to all fours where you do the thread the needle pose, cow pose and hip circles. From there, Ashley leads you through side and forward triangle poses, seated spinal twists with one leg extended and the other one bent, and horizontal splits where you bend forward with your legs as far apart as you can.The bonus feature is a 7-minute guided meditation, which you do in cross-legged position.  In this meditation, Ashley encourages you to focus on the breath and be witness to your thoughts. Her pleasant voice is very calming on all the practices in this DVD.  Ashley's cuing is also great and as she demonstrates the poses, she explains what muscles are working and where you should be feeling it as well as reminding you about breathing, practicing affirmations, and setting intentions.Thorough the workout, especially during the first practice, the instructor suggests alternatives for those who are less flexible or are not strong enough to do the more challenging poses. For example, she recommends staying in bridge pose instead of doing the full wheel pose. The Strength practice is doable but I feel it is geared toward ""experienced"" beginners to intermediate level.  It is assumed that you already know what cobra or downward-facing dog is.  There were no new poses for me, but it is how Ashley combined them that made this particular practice intense for me.  I like this DVD a lot and I'm very happy that it's now part of my yoga collection.",4,Left me sore but I like these workouts,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,2710,"['been', 'awhile', 'yoga', 'workout', 'left', 'sore', 'When', 'tighs', 'calves', 'butt', 'started', 'complain', 'just', 'finished', 'first', 'workout', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Flexibility', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'really', 'worked', 'muscles.Yoga', 'Strength', 'core', 'muscles', 'upper', 'body', 'will', 'challenge', 'balance', 'workout', '33', 'minutes', 'just', 'right', 'start', 'will', 'find', 'moving', 'plank', 'pose', 'side', 'plank', 'one', 'arm', 'up', 'push-ups', 'three', 'variations', 'abdominal', 'curls', 'included', 'first', '11', 'minutes', 'workout', 'Next', 'come', 'standing', 'crescent', 'pose', 'variations', 'transition', 'warrior', '3', 'pose', 'move', 'standing', 'split', 'pose', 'there', 'will', 'do', 'traditional', 'chair', 'pose', 'variation', 'do', 'balls', 'feet', 'final', 'group', 'exercises', 'involve', 'warrior', '2', 'extended', 'warrior', 'pose', 'bow', 'boat', 'wheel', 'poses.The', 'goal', 'Yoga', 'Flexibility', 'stretch', 'shoulders', 'hips', 'hamstrings', 'back', '32-minute', 'practice', 'head', 'rolls', 'then', 'doing', 'backstrokes', 'butterfly', 'strokes', 'arms', 'moving', 'gentle', 'standing', 'back', 'bend', 'then', 'squats', 'Half', 'sun', 'salutations', 'bring', 'fours', 'where', 'do', 'thread', 'needle', 'pose', 'cow', 'pose', 'hip', 'circles', 'there', 'Ashley', 'side', 'forward', 'triangle', 'poses', 'seated', 'spinal', 'twists', 'one', 'leg', 'extended', 'other', 'one', 'bent', 'horizontal', 'splits', 'where', 'bend', 'forward', 'legs', 'far', 'apart', 'can.The', 'bonus', 'feature', '7-minute', 'guided', 'meditation', 'do', 'cross-legged', 'position', 'meditation', 'Ashley', 'focus', 'breath', 'be', 'witness', 'thoughts', 'pleasant', 'voice', 'very', 'calming', 'practices', 'DVD', 'Ashley', 'cuing', 'also', 'great', 'poses', 'what', 'muscles', 'are', 'working', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'feeling', 'as', 'well', 'reminding', 'breathing', 'practicing', 'affirmations', 'setting', 'workout', 'especially', 'first', 'practice', 'instructor', 'alternatives', 'who', 'are', 'less', 'flexible', 'are', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'do', 'more', 'challenging', 'poses', 'example', 'staying', 'bridge', 'pose', 'instead', 'doing', 'full', 'wheel', 'pose', 'Strength', 'practice', 'doable', 'feel', 'geared', 'experienced', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'level', 'assumed', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'cobra', 'downward-facing', 'dog', 'were', 'new', 'poses', 'how', 'Ashley', 'combined', 'made', 'particular', 'practice', 'intense', 'DVD', 'lot', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'now', 'part', 'yoga', 'collection']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659207,AQY5XBYSENNZQ,B00DLX766Y,Quickbeam,"[0, 0]","I reviewed this DVD twice, once to simply watch and again to do the practice with the DVD. I am a yogi of 3 years, I take classes every day and have a daily home practice.There is a lot to like about this DVD. The reason I think it is not for beginners is that I think all students should have some hands on instruction before working at home with a DVD. There is not enough time on the DVD (or any DVD) to adequately explain each posture, foot placement and alignment.The strength section of the DVD was very challenging. I did feel it was safe but definitely focused on core strength. Turner is fit,agile and clearly accomplished in both her proactice and teaching. At one point she crosses has ankles in a core move which I have been taught is incorrect. However, this is hardly a traditional pose and I think it gives stability to the exercise. I like that Turner gives Sanskrit names frequently and also demonstrates modified poses.The flexibility section was very strong and probably within the capacity of most viewers. At one point Turner does a squat and stand move a bit faster than I would like to see. For people with knee problems that would be difficult. I think that could easily be slowed down and modified.The guided medication at the end is brief but effective. I overall liked this DVD very much and it is far superior to most of the yoga DVDs I have seen. If Turner ever guest-taught in my area I'd definitely go. There is nothing unsafe here. Turner demonstrates the practice herself with voice over. You see her from every possible angle. You also see the effort which I like.

Ashley gives modifications if the poses are too advanced but does not go into great detail about the particulars of the poses. I think a little exposure to yoga is necessary for this section. I would recommend it for Advance Beginner and Intermediate yogis.The flexibility section of the DVD opened up almost every part of my body - shoulders, hips, hamstrings - you name it. I think this section would be appropriate even if you have never done yoga before but is still a great practice if you're experience.There is a bonus guided mediation section.

There is a bonus meditation practice as well.  Turner is a good yoga instructor, offering clear and specific suggestions.  This DVD, however, is not for beginners.  No yoga modification tools are used.  You will need a yoga mat, obviously.The flexibility practice is simple, mainly staying on the mat and not demanding too much by way of strength or balance.  Modifications are suggested but I did not find them necessary, although they are appreciated.  The practice uses easy dynamic movement to lead into deep stretches, starting with some standing poses before moving onto the mat.  The transitions are smooth and logical, and it is easy to immerse one&#8217;s self in the practice, moving with the breath, which is what a yoga practice should be.The strength practice is too difficult for me and I doubt many will find it easy.  Moving from Crescent Pose into Warrior III.  This is followed by a deep chair pose which is held for a long time.  It&#8217;s definitely not easy.  No doubt, this will build strength but how many people can do these things with ease?  Perhaps a few people who have been practicing yoga a long time but I have my doubts.The bonus meditation practice is a brief 10 minutes, not as long as I would like. It is a mindfulness meditation, focusing on the breath.  I found the background music to be a distraction and am disappointed that the DVD doesn&#8217;t offer the option to turn the music off altogether.  However, I can see where this would be a lovely introduction to a meditation practice for those who are not already meditating on a regular basis.All in all, I like this DVD although I don&#8217;t think I will ever be able to work through the strength practice without significant modification.  I am sure I&#8217;ll enjoy doing the flexibility practice occasionally but I would imagine that I&#8217;ll pass this DVD along to someone stronger, with better balance, and maybe more experience with yoga than I.To the DVD distribution company, however, I have one very clear complaint.  I see no point in added a cardboard sleeve to the DVD case when the content on the sleeve duplicates what is on the case.  Less packaging, in this day and age, is not something to be taken lightly.

1659212,A3JPTQPOKO6TVO,B00DLX766Y,"scot16897 ""scot16897""","[10, 13]","My wife heard about Ashley Turner through the yoga studio she used to go to so we both assumed that this was a Power Yoga DVD.  Unfortunately this DVD is a disappointment.  The DVD contains two 30 minute practices, one focused on ""Strength"" and the other ""Flexibility"".The ""Strength"" section feels more like working out with a gym trainer doing repetitions of poses, then an actual yoga flow which incorporates strength.  My biggest concern is that there is no warm up or sun salutations to warm up the body.  After a brief tadasana and head rolls, she takes you straight into holding plank pose and then into side arm balances, back to plank again, and then side arm balances on the other side.  I felt an immediate shock to my arms and not in a good way.  There is a reason for those sun salutations to warm up the body.  Other poses include several types of crunches with the legs elevated, more planks, crescent poses with arms reaching forward and back, lunges, Warrior III with arms moving forward and back, chair pose, more plank poses, side angle pose on both sides, navasana (boat pose), wheel pose, pose  and then ends with reclining twist on each side and seated meditation.The ""Flexibility"" practice was not much better.  Ashley starts off with tadasana, head rolls, and standing side stretches, and then eventually works her way into seated stretching poses.  There are some deep bends and stretches here, but no sun salutations to warm up the body beforehand .  Only about half of the poses seem to be actual yoga poses, the remainder seemed like just exercises (i.e. ""standing"" cat cow?).  There are lunges, front leg forward bends, and triangle poses as well as some seated side leg bends, but beyond that not much recognizable here.Yoga means ""to yoke"", or to join breath and body.  When the focus becomes just either ""strength"" or ""flexibility"" shoved into a 30 minute workout with no warm up something has to be compromised.  In this case the essence of yoga as it is meant to be was lost.  It feels more like being at the gym with your trainer, rather than moving through and opening up your body.  There are many other yoga DVD's that do integrate both.  Some of my favorites include Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste, and Rodney Yee.",1,More Gym Trainer than Yoga Flow,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,2248,"['wife', 'heard', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'yoga', 'studio', 'used', 'go', 'so', 'assumed', 'was', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'DVD', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'two', '30', 'minute', 'practices', 'one', 'focused', 'Strength', 'other', 'Flexibility', '.The', 'Strength', 'section', 'more', 'working', 'out', 'gym', 'trainer', 'doing', 'repetitions', 'poses', 'then', 'actual', 'yoga', 'flow', 'strength', 'biggest', 'concern', 'warm', 'up', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'brief', 'tadasana', 'head', 'rolls', 'straight', 'holding', 'plank', 'pose', 'then', 'side', 'arm', 'balances', 'back', 'plank', 'again', 'then', 'side', 'arm', 'balances', 'other', 'side', 'felt', 'immediate', 'shock', 'arms', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'reason', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'Other', 'poses', 'include', 'several', 'types', 'crunches', 'legs', 'elevated', 'more', 'planks', 'crescent', 'poses', 'arms', 'reaching', 'forward', 'back', 'lunges', 'Warrior', 'III', 'arms', 'moving', 'forward', 'back', 'chair', 'pose', 'more', 'plank', 'poses', 'side', 'angle', 'pose', 'sides', 'navasana', 'boat', 'pose', 'wheel', 'pose', 'pose', 'then', 'reclining', 'twist', 'side', 'seated', 'meditation.The', 'Flexibility', 'practice', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Ashley', 'tadasana', 'head', 'rolls', 'standing', 'side', 'stretches', 'then', 'eventually', 'way', 'seated', 'stretching', 'poses', 'are', 'deep', 'bends', 'stretches', 'here', 'sun', 'salutations', 'warm', 'up', 'body', 'beforehand', 'Only', 'half', 'poses', 'seem', 'be', 'actual', 'yoga', 'poses', 'remainder', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'exercises', 'i.e', 'standing', 'cat', 'cow', 'are', 'lunges', 'front', 'leg', 'forward', 'triangle', 'poses', 'as', 'well', 'seated', 'side', 'leg', 'not', 'much', 'recognizable', 'here.Yoga', 'yoke', 'join', 'breath', 'body', 'When', 'focus', 'just', 'strength', 'flexibility', 'shoved', '30', 'minute', 'workout', 'warm', 'up', 'something', 'be', 'compromised', 'case', 'essence', 'yoga', 'meant', 'be', 'was', 'lost', 'more', 'being', 'gym', 'trainer', 'rather', 'moving', 'opening', 'up', 'body', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'do', 'integrate', 'favorites', 'include', 'Bryan', 'Kest', 'Baron', 'Baptiste', 'Rodney', 'Yee']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
1659213,A2FFWYG9YYZFA5,B00DLX766Y,She,"[3, 4]","Just for fun and to get fit, I took a yoga class that is meant for fitness majors at my college during the summer semester.  I did it five times a week for the whole semester, and I felt SO much better and learned a lot.  Yoga improves back pain, builds muscle, and just makes you feel great.  It also reduced the amount of migraines I get.  I go to studio yoga classes at my gym sometimes, and I love those as well.  However, I wanted to have a DVD I could do at home, so I picked up Element.There are two 30-minute sections--one focuses on strength and one focuses on flexibility--and a meditation section.  The strength part was too far away from real yoga for my taste.  You do lots of crunches and other ""regular"" exercises.  It wasn't that challenging.The flexibility part modified positions to make them easier and missed out on including really good stretching positions like the Pigeon and Plow.  I felt like I was just screwing around half of the time and not really working out that hard.Honestly, this DVD reminded of the type of exercises the elderly do.  I did like that the instructor didn't chatter and had a nice voice, and the location was beautiful.  I don't think this is the worst workout ever, but if you really want to learn yoga, go to a studio.  The prices usually aren't that bad, especially if you are a student.  If you don't care about the yoga aspect and are not in great shape, then this might do well enough for you in the beginning, but definitely don't rely on this to greatly improve your fitness level.",3,Just okay,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1538,"['Just', 'fun', 'get', 'fit', 'took', 'yoga', 'class', 'meant', 'fitness', 'majors', 'college', 'summer', 'semester', 'did', 'five', 'times', 'week', 'whole', 'semester', 'felt', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'learned', 'lot', 'Yoga', 'back', 'pain', 'builds', 'muscle', 'just', 'feel', 'great', 'also', 'reduced', 'amount', 'migraines', 'get', 'go', 'studio', 'yoga', 'classes', 'gym', 'sometimes', 'love', 'well', 'However', 'wanted', 'have', 'DVD', 'could', 'do', 'home', 'picked', 'up', 'Element.There', 'are', 'two', '30-minute', 'sections', 'one', 'strength', 'one', 'focuses', 'flexibility', 'meditation', 'section', 'strength', 'part', 'was', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'real', 'yoga', 'taste', 'do', 'lots', 'crunches', 'other', 'regular', 'exercises', 'was', ""n't"", 'challenging.The', 'flexibility', 'part', 'modified', 'positions', 'make', 'easier', 'missed', 'out', 'including', 'really', 'good', 'stretching', 'positions', 'Pigeon', 'Plow', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'screwing', 'half', 'time', 'not', 'really', 'working', 'out', 'hard.Honestly', 'DVD', 'reminded', 'type', 'exercises', 'elderly', 'do', 'did', 'instructor', 'did', ""n't"", 'chatter', 'had', 'nice', 'voice', 'location', 'was', 'beautiful', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'worst', 'workout', 'ever', 'really', 'want', 'learn', 'yoga', 'go', 'studio', 'prices', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'especially', 'are', 'student', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'yoga', 'aspect', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'shape', 'then', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'enough', 'beginning', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'greatly', 'improve', 'fitness', 'level']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility

This isn't it.  This is yoga as a workout, designed specifically to make you sweat.The DVD has two main programs, one for strength and one for flexibility.  The strength workout was surprisingly intense; I was sweating and I actually had to stop and rest for a few moments about two-thirds of the way through - I've never had that happen during any yoga session before!  There are no sun salutations or other &#34;warm up&#34; poses - the instructor jumps from head rolls straight to plank exercises, which may be part of why this was so exhausting.

I felt some poses she repeated too many times back/forth like a pilates program instead of holding them longer. I understand the back/forth to add flexibility, but felt she did it too much here, such as planks to low push-ups, or raising on your toes & down in chair pose. It can also be physically demanding with holding planks, push-ups & side planks all at once. This class is better for those who work out at least a little semi-regularly or more often.Yoga for Flexibility - 31 minI enjoyed this music more, it had some piano, but had a good tempo for the movements & had more Enigma feel to it then jazzy. Here, she really focuses on opening up your shoulders, spine, pelvis & hips in a more relaxing way, but not boring, nor so easy you don't feel anything. Her program is unique (I have viewed over 100 yoga dvds at minimum), and I really felt the difference in my joints after, the muscles felt more stretched out/looser.Meditation - 7 minI didn't care for this short meditation, though others might. The music was fast tempo jazzy & she repeated herself too often, saying the same thing over again, many times not even changing the wording.Overall, her style is a combination of the old, true style of yoga with saying the Sanskrit pose names, teaching Ujjayi breathing before each session, and a few spiritual ways of saying how to move your body, and words of encouragement to enjoy the moment and where you are. She also names muscles in their common Western way, and can be very descriptive on how to move your body, and where to feel the stretch, but also leave out some important information for those who are truly new to yoga. I'd say her style of teaching is 3/4 Western & 1/4 Eastern in .This DVD is best for experienced beginners or more of yoga, and those who workout semi-regularly or more.Collagevideo & Totalhealthdvds both have clips on their site, or you can also view them on Youtube.",4,Element: Yoga for Strength & Flexibility,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",2013,2150,"['instructed', 'Ashley', 'Turner', 'alone', 'who', 'voice-over', 'beautiful', 'yard', 'home', 'hotel', 'are', 'two', 'programs', 'Yoga', 'Strength', '33', 'minThis', 'fast', 'tempo', 'piano', 'music', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'session', 'felt', 'poses', 'repeated', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'back/forth', 'pilates', 'program', 'instead', 'holding', 'longer', 'understand', 'back/forth', 'add', 'flexibility', 'felt', 'did', 'too', 'much', 'here', 'such', 'planks', 'low', 'push-ups', 'raising', 'toes', 'down', 'chair', 'pose', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'physically', 'demanding', 'holding', 'planks', 'push-ups', 'side', 'planks', 'once', 'class', 'better', 'who', 'work', 'out', 'least', 'little', 'semi-regularly', 'more', 'often.Yoga', 'Flexibility', '31', 'minI', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'more', 'had', 'piano', 'had', 'good', 'tempo', 'movements', 'had', 'more', 'Enigma', 'feel', 'then', 'Here', 'really', 'opening', 'up', 'shoulders', 'spine', 'pelvis', 'hips', 'more', 'relaxing', 'way', 'not', 'boring', 'so', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'program', 'unique', 'have', 'viewed', '100', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'minimum', 'really', 'felt', 'difference', 'joints', 'muscles', 'felt', 'more', 'stretched', 'out/looser.Meditation', '7', 'minI', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'short', 'meditation', 'others', 'might', 'music', 'was', 'fast', 'tempo', 'jazzy', 'repeated', 'too', 'often', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'again', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'even', 'changing', 'wording.Overall', 'style', 'combination', 'old', 'true', 'style', 'yoga', 'saying', 'Sanskrit', 'pose', 'names', 'teaching', 'Ujjayi', 'breathing', 'session', 'few', 'spiritual', 'ways', 'saying', 'how', 'move', 'body', 'words', 'encouragement', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'where', 'are', 'also', 'muscles', 'common', 'Western', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'descriptive', 'how', 'move', 'body', 'where', 'feel', 'stretch', 'also', 'leave', 'out', 'important', 'information', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'new', 'yoga', ""'d"", 'say', 'style', 'teaching', '3/4', 'Western', '1/4', 'Eastern', '.This', 'DVD', 'best', 'experienced', 'beginners', 'more', 'yoga', 'who', 'workout', 'semi-regularly', 'more.Collagevideo', 'Totalhealthdvds', 'have', 'clips', 'site', 'can', 'also', 'view', 'Youtube']",Element: Yoga for Strengh & Flexibility
