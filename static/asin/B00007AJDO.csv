It is a charming series, which includes romance, adventure, humor, a great cast, great clothing, and more!  Based loosely on the Louisa May Alcott novel of the same name, it is a fun series you should enjoy whether you've read the books or not.There are a few episodes I didn't care for (the Halloween episode, etc.), the very occasional swearing, and a few bits in which lying wasn't discouraged as it should have been, but overall it's good.These first four episodes are very sweet and satisfying. . . . ""Changes"" introduces Nick Riley, the new caretaker, and the first girl student, Nan.  ""Quarantine"" is about the measels epidemic that keeps the school under a quarantine, and the bravery of those willing to do what they could to help (a very touching episode).  In ""Thanksgiving,"" Bess (Amy & Laurie's daughter) arrives at the Plumfield school.  Will Bess ever be happy at Plumfield?  In ""Tough Crimes"" an old friend of Dan's decides he wants to take Dan out West with him--but at what cost?I wish the whole series were on DVD!",5,A wonderful series for the entire family!,1042502400,"01 14, 2003",2003,1113,"['watched', 'when', 'was', 'PAX', 'channel', 'whole', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'charming', 'series', 'romance', 'adventure', 'humor', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'clothing', 'more', 'Based', 'loosely', 'Louisa', 'May', 'Alcott', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'fun', 'series', 'should', 'enjoy', ""'ve"", 'read', 'books', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Halloween', 'episode', 'etc', 'very', 'occasional', 'swearing', 'few', 'bits', 'lying', 'was', ""n't"", 'discouraged', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'overall', 'good.These', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'sweet', 'satisfying', 'Changes', 'introduces', 'Nick', 'Riley', 'new', 'caretaker', 'first', 'girl', 'student', 'Nan', 'Quarantine', 'measels', 'epidemic', 'school', 'quarantine', 'bravery', 'willing', 'do', 'what', 'could', 'help', 'very', 'touching', 'episode', 'Thanksgiving', 'Bess', 'Amy', 'Laurie', 'daughter', 'Plumfield', 'school', 'Will', 'Bess', 'ever', 'be', 'happy', 'Plumfield', 'Tough', 'Crimes', 'old', 'friend', 'Dan', 'decides', 'take', 'Dan', 'out', 'West', 'what', 'cost', 'wish', 'whole', 'series', 'were', 'DVD']",Little Men Set 1

725826,A22MQ2OAHY8SIJ,B00007AJDO,"KittyKins ""KittyKins""","[27, 29]","I can't say enough about this series that unfortunately ran for only 2 seasons.  I recently bought this two DVD set of the first 4 episodes, and the picture & sound quality are excellent.  This series is well acted with good stories appropriate for the whole family.  Although it is an extention of LM Alcott's work and includes invented characters such as Nick, the romantic interest for Jo, it seems realistic and in keeping with the flavour that Miss Alcott was trying to portray through her writings.  The romance between them is very sweet and is in no way ""over the top"".  It isn't one of those productions that leaves purists such as myself feeling betrayed by the presentation of the story or characters, and now I wouldn't want to be without those new characters!  My favourite actors are Trevor Blumas who plays Nat and Robin Dunne as Franz Bhaer.  The DVD includes bios of some of the characters and also there are extra features for those who have a DVD-ROM.  It is interesting to note that one of the executive producers, Carl Binder, (who also produced Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman for 3 years), is Canadian as well as most of the actors/actresses.  It seems to be a joint production between Canada and the United States.  It is very much in the flavour of other outstanding Canadian productions such as Road to Avonlea by Sullivan Entertainment.  Those of you who like those shows will definitely like this as well.  I was also amazed when reading the bios, how much the teenagers have in common with one another in real life.  They are a very athletic and musical group of individuals.  Together they made an excellent team in this outstanding family show.  My biggest disappointment of course is that there are not more episodes available on DVD.  I'm presently ordering copies of this release for my friends.  I am hoping that since this DVD set was just released last year (2003) there is still a chance that they will release the rest.  I hope the producers are reading this!!  Also it would be good if any future releases were closed captioned or subtitled for the hard of hearing, as these were not included in this edition.",5,An Outstanding Release That Leaves You Wanting More!,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,2142,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'series', 'unfortunately', 'ran', 'only', '2', 'seasons', 'recently', 'bought', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent', 'series', 'well', 'acted', 'good', 'stories', 'appropriate', 'whole', 'family', 'extention', 'LM', 'Alcott', 'work', 'invented', 'characters', 'such', 'Nick', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Jo', 'realistic', 'keeping', 'flavour', 'Miss', 'Alcott', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'writings', 'romance', 'very', 'sweet', 'way', 'top', ""n't"", 'one', 'productions', 'purists', 'such', 'feeling', 'betrayed', 'presentation', 'story', 'characters', 'now', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'new', 'characters', 'favourite', 'actors', 'are', 'Trevor', 'Blumas', 'who', 'Nat', 'Robin', 'Dunne', 'Franz', 'Bhaer', 'DVD', 'bios', 'characters', 'also', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'who', 'have', 'DVD-ROM', 'interesting', 'note', 'one', 'executive', 'producers', 'Carl', 'Binder', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'Dr.', 'Quinn', 'Medicine', 'Woman', '3', 'years', 'Canadian', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'actors/actresses', 'be', 'joint', 'production', 'Canada', 'United', 'States', 'very', 'much', 'flavour', 'other', 'outstanding', 'Canadian', 'productions', 'such', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'who', 'shows', 'will', 'definitely', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'also', 'amazed', 'when', 'reading', 'bios', 'how', 'much', 'teenagers', 'have', 'common', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'very', 'athletic', 'musical', 'group', 'individuals', 'Together', 'made', 'excellent', 'team', 'outstanding', 'family', 'show', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'course', 'are', 'not', 'more', 'episodes', 'available', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'presently', 'ordering', 'copies', 'release', 'friends', 'am', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'last', 'year', '2003', 'still', 'chance', 'will', 'release', 'rest', 'hope', 'producers', 'are', 'reading', 'Also', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'future', 'releases', 'were', 'closed', 'captioned', 'subtitled', 'hard', 'hearing', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'edition']",Little Men Set 1
725827,A3J0AQUK0I4C60,B00007AJDO,Linny,"[0, 0]","So very happy to have discovered this series. Have watched the 26 episodes (some more than others beginning in February) repeatedly on Netflix. I've never been so enamored with a series. Very unfortunate that so many members purchased the DVD's and were disappointed, certainly would have felt the same.The story was so wholesome, charming, full of adventure, humor and a very sweet blossoming romance between Jo and Nick. It really has so much to offer, even for the book fans, who wouldn't feel betrayed by giving it a chance.The addition of Nick Riley as caretaker of Plumfield is crucial to the series. He is a man struggling with his own past but brings his own brand of fortitude, charm, masculinity and tenderness to the storyline. Jo has strength and courage that Nick has ever known. Yes, he falls in love with her but never waivers from respect/admiration. In fact he becomes her savior in many ways (including her life). They really learn valuable lessons from each other.The acting was superior by all players. Did not want it to end, would love to own the entire series, will never get tired of watching it. Although the climax was positive it would be great if the story could be continued.FYI: MY REVIEW IS REGARDING THE STORY ONLY!! HAVE NOT PURCHASED THE DVD.Someone mentioned be able to view 40 plus episodes.
