1047025,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000MM0LIM,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 4]","When the Black Christmas remake (It's based on a 1974 slasher flick) was released in 2006, many religious groups were furious that it was released on Christmas. However, many horror fans hated this remake and it is widely regarded as being one of the worst remakes ever made (It even ended up on a list of the worst horror flicks of the decade, but then again, I thought the remakes of Prom Night and The Wicker Man were far worse than any other remake out there). Critics of course trashed the hell out of it (15% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and a 22 out of 100 on Metacritic), which is no real surprise. So you might be wondering why exactly did I enjoy this horror flick. I'm just going to flat-out tell you I'm a gorehound and I love cheesy B-movies, so it was a perfect fit for me. Is this a well made piece of film-making? Hell no! It's pretty damn cheesy, make no mistake about that. It just cannot be taken seriously at any point, which is why I don't exactly recommend it. If you can't stomach really cheesy and stupid horror flicks, then it's best if you don't continue reading and don't even think about buying it. But, if you enjoy cheesy horror flicks let's move on.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: In 1991, a man named Billy who was locked in the attic of his mother and stepfather's home (And also fathered an ugly girl with his mother) killed his mother and stepfather, and tore out the right eye of his inbred daughter and eats it. After he killed his parents, he eats pieces of his dead mother and then gets apprehended and put into a mental institution. Fifteen years later he breaks out and goes back to his home which was turned into a sorority house. Now Billy and his ugly inbred daughter intend to kill all the girls in the house who are trapped inside because a snowstorm knocked out the power and there have been many car crashes on the highway so it will take two hours for the police to show up. One by one the girls get picked off, and they must try and find a way to survive and get away.MUSIC: The music fits the mood as it should in a horror film. No gripes here, and there's also some cheery Christmas tunes as well.ACTING: So, so bad. The dialogue is pure cheese and all of the acting was bad. I just couldn't help but laugh when these stupid girls would get killed off because they seemed to lack logic (Let's stay together! Wait, you stay inside while we go out and investigate! There are plenty of other moments of no logic, but let's move on). Not to mention I really didn't recognize any of these people aside from two actresses from Final Destination 3.ACTION: Gore is  aplenty in this horror flick, and it is awesome. Eyes get ripped out, stabbings are common, slicing and dicing, etc. I was never bored with this horror flick and I was always entertained. This is a very demented and disturbing horror film. This film is gratuitous in both gore and sexual content, so this definitely not for children or people who are deathly afraid of horror films. Is this film scary? No, not if you've seen a lot of horror films. This really isn't a scarefest, it's pretty much just one big gorefest.OVERALL: If you hate just about any horror remake, then I certainly don't recommend this to you. If you can't take stupid and really cheesy horror films then I also don't recommend this to you either. However if you can enjoy mindless and utterly stupid gorefests, then this is a must-have because this is one fun and rather demented horror film.THE GOOD: Lots of blood and gore, gleefully demented, and it's the fun kind of stupid film.THE BAD: Most people will not be able to handle how cheesy and absurd this film is.",4,"A GLEEFULLY DEMENTED SLASHER, I LOVE IT! 8.5 OUT OF 10",1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3630,"['When', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'remake', 'based', '1974', 'slasher', 'flick', 'was', 'released', '2006', 'many', 'religious', 'groups', 'were', 'furious', 'was', 'released', 'Christmas', 'However', 'many', 'horror', 'fans', 'hated', 'remake', 'widely', 'regarded', 'being', 'one', 'worst', 'remakes', 'ever', 'made', 'even', 'ended', 'up', 'list', 'worst', 'horror', 'flicks', 'decade', 'then', 'again', 'thought', 'remakes', 'Prom', 'Night', 'Wicker', 'Man', 'were', 'far', 'worse', 'other', 'remake', 'there', 'Critics', 'course', 'trashed', 'hell', '15', '%', 'Fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', '22', '100', 'Metacritic', 'real', 'surprise', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'exactly', 'did', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'flick', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'flat-out', 'tell', ""'m"", 'gorehound', 'love', 'cheesy', 'B-movies', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'well', 'made', 'piece', 'film-making', 'Hell', 'pretty', 'damn', 'cheesy', 'make', 'mistake', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'point', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'recommend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'really', 'cheesy', 'stupid', 'horror', 'flicks', 'then', 'best', 'do', ""n't"", 'continue', 'reading', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'buying', 'enjoy', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'flicks', 'let', 'move', 'IT', 'ABOUT', '1991', 'man', 'named', 'Billy', 'who', 'was', 'locked', 'attic', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'home', 'also', 'fathered', 'ugly', 'girl', 'mother', 'killed', 'mother', 'stepfather', 'tore', 'out', 'right', 'eye', 'inbred', 'daughter', 'killed', 'parents', 'pieces', 'dead', 'mother', 'then', 'apprehended', 'put', 'mental', 'institution', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'out', 'back', 'home', 'was', 'turned', 'sorority', 'house', 'Now', 'Billy', 'ugly', 'inbred', 'daughter', 'intend', 'kill', 'girls', 'house', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'inside', 'snowstorm', 'knocked', 'out', 'power', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'car', 'crashes', 'highway', 'will', 'take', 'two', 'hours', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'One', 'one', 'girls', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'must', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'survive', 'get', 'away.MUSIC', 'music', 'mood', 'should', 'horror', 'film', 'gripes', 'here', 'also', 'cheery', 'Christmas', 'tunes', 'well.ACTING', 'So', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'pure', 'cheese', 'acting', 'was', 'bad', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'when', 'stupid', 'girls', 'would', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'seemed', 'lack', 'logic', 'Let', 'stay', 'together', 'Wait', 'stay', 'inside', 'go', 'out', 'investigate', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'moments', 'logic', 'let', 'move', 'Not', 'mention', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'people', 'aside', 'two', 'actresses', 'Final', 'Destination', '3.ACTION', 'Gore', 'aplenty', 'horror', 'flick', 'awesome', 'Eyes', 'get', 'ripped', 'out', 'stabbings', 'are', 'common', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'etc', 'was', 'never', 'bored', 'horror', 'flick', 'was', 'always', 'entertained', 'very', 'demented', 'disturbing', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'gratuitous', 'gore', 'sexual', 'content', 'definitely', 'not', 'children', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'deathly', 'afraid', 'horror', 'films', 'film', 'scary', 'No', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horror', 'films', 'really', ""n't"", 'scarefest', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'one', 'big', 'gorefest.OVERALL', 'hate', 'just', 'horror', 'remake', 'then', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'stupid', 'really', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'films', 'then', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'either', 'However', 'can', 'enjoy', 'mindless', 'utterly', 'stupid', 'gorefests', 'then', 'must-have', 'one', 'fun', 'rather', 'demented', 'horror', 'film.THE', 'GOOD', 'Lots', 'blood', 'gore', 'gleefully', 'demented', 'fun', 'kind', 'stupid', 'film.THE', 'BAD', 'Most', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'how', 'cheesy', 'absurd', 'film']",N/A

1047030,AG0TA24LI0XV7,B000MM0LIM,"Baron Sardonicus, Super Genius","[1, 1]","I watched the remake of ""Black Christmas"" last night. Now I know why it got poor reactions and reviews. All I can say to those who haven't experienced it yet is that it's not even mediocre. The original is much better... and actually scary.Anyone who likes this new version might want to stop reading now.(Spoiler Warning... Major plot points given away)I'm really fond of the 1974 original movie but I wanted to give this new version a chance, just to be a fair kinda guy. Part of the original film's appeal and fright factor lies in the fact that we never really see psycho Billly, and we have no clue about his past or why he's a nutjob. (And we don't *need* to know.) This new version actually creates a detailed and sordid backstory explaining Billy's trashy childhood trauma, and also explaining about Agnes. And Agnes is actually in the film killing people at the sorority house while Billy escapes the asylum. (What the--? Huh?)Why Hollywood feels this urge to show flashbacks and create a history for deranged killers is a mystery to me. I heard they did the same thing for the ""Halloween"" revamp from Rob Zombie.Anyway, it seems the sorority house in the story used to be Billy's home. Oooh, scary. Well, to me it's just another way of ripping off John Carpenter and Debra Hill's Halloween bit about the killer coming back home. Yawn. Try something new, folks.The filmmakers took an innovative cult slasher film from three decades ago and altered it significantly without even making the changes interesting or scary. This alone burns my hash. There are many ways they could have changed things and made it innovative and scary. But, no.The beginning is actually baffling because during the first murder at the house, simultaneously we are shown Billy at the mental hospital preparing to bust out (leaving us to wonder, is that a flashback?); were we supposed to figure out that his daughter/sister Agnes was hiding at the sorority house before he broke out? A sign of poor filmmaking. Plus, now we have two looney killers in one movie. It makes things, well, cumbersome. Maybe the filmmakers figured two psychos equals more fright. LOL!! Guess again.The movie is stylish but it comes off as a ""Suspiria"" copycat with similarly garish colors. The characters are all whiny, vapid, pretty b/i/t/c/h/e/s whom we care nothing about. Speaking of characters, we meet the 'plain Jane' of the bunch, Eve, very briefly after the house mother (Andrea Martin, one of the sorority girls in the original) tells the story of Agnes. Eve is the nerdy, creepy librarian type; she'd make a good killer, really, though stereotypically. Were we supposed to assume she might be Agnes? Snore...Even if I try to look at this as a stand-alone film (not a remake) it doesn't work; it's dull and stupid. An icicle falling eight feet can kill a person? I'm all for employing suspension of disbelief during a movie but this is that to the Nth degree, lol.This thing will leave you restless and looking at your watch as you try to figure out if there's going to be a heroine who will survive, and if there's going to be one solitary eyeball left. It seems the screenwriter has a thing about the removal of victim's eyeballs. That wasn't in the first movie (luckily). The laughs here are all unintentional.The most pathetic part of all this is that here you have a situation pregnant with horror possibility-- a sorority house with a handful of girls on Christmas Eve, a snowstorm, and a maniac on the loose. But it's wasted on this klunker of a movie.The original film played with our heads, trying to make us believe that Olivia Hussey's boyfriend Keir Dullea might be the killer. In *this* clumsy version they try to make us think that every character might be the maniac. Possibly that's another way of distracting the viewer from realizing they are experiencing crap.The movie is poorly arranged (flashbacks, scene sequences, editing, camera angles, etc), and it should have ended earlier. The whole hospital sequence was just a reason for me to fidget more and look forward to the end credits. ""Oh, everyone die already"", I was thinking.I must confess that there was one thing that was tolerable. The music score had some nice touches (the incidental, spooky background music... not the endlessly irritating use of Tchaikovsky's 'Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy' from his Nutcracker Suite. After the fourth time hearing that as background melody or cell phone ring tone, it's like ""We get it, it's Christmas time, enough already"").I was bent on making it through this sham to at least say ""I finished it. I am strong. I can make it through utter drivel"". Yes, I had been warned about this movie, that it was an insult to the original and that the characters were non-dimensional. And now that I've seen it, I must agree. This flick is just fodder for mockery, nothing more.",1,Eye'll Be Home For Christmas,1240099200,"04 19, 2009",2009,4857,"['watched', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'last', 'night', 'Now', 'know',

1047031,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000MM0LIM,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","If you are looking for a kitschy throwback to ordinary 80's slasher films with nary an original idea or thought, and were just there for hot babes, gore, and nude scenes, then this film will be for you. If you are expecting anything more substantial, along the lines of a smart, clever and scary ""Scream"", or something like the harder and grittier ""Saw"" films, then you are out of luck. Black Christmas, a re-make of a brilliant 1974 film, has it's own entertaining, guilty pleasure quality to it. What it doesn't have is a good script, memorable characters, or inventive murders. The story is straight forward and simple. A bunch of non descript sorority sisters(all of them lookers, naturally)are snowed in in their sorority house over the Christmas holiday from a horrible blizzard. A psychotic loon who used to live there has escaped from the mental hospital, and starts taking the lovely sorority girls out one by one upon his arrival. This film gives Billy and Agnes more of a back story, and that is not necessarily a good thing. It may give them more reason, but it also takes something away from it. The mystery and the creep factor. Billy and Agnes are hardly scary, and they can't hold a candle to any other slasher icon in the ""inventive kills"" category. Unlike the original, the re-make is a lot bloodier and more violent. That may have it's place in some movies of this kind, but it just feels wrong and out of place here. After a while, it just seems ridiculous. There are no characters here to root for. They are as generic as they come, but nice to look at. Casting Andrea Martin as the house mother was a nice touch. A few more nods to the original would of been nice. Was Margot Kidder too busy?. The film does have a nice atmosphere, and the seasonal setting is used nicely and adds to it. It has a Christmas-y feel. It looks nice and has a pretty good tone. Most of the film seems as if writer/director Glen Morgan took the blue print from every cliched slasher/girls in peril slasher movie, and threw them in, without adding anything new or original. There are no shocks. No real scares. No real twist. You can see everything coming from a mile away...or two. It's too bad. There does seem to be a decent, scary thrill ride buried beneath the mediocre hockum, but Morgan either failed to notice, or just decided to forego it all and to just deliver a no brain slash-a-thon thinking that's what the kids today want. As I said before, there is enjoyment in the movie if you go into it with your brain completely off and your expectations incredibly low. Hopefully, this new movie will turn people who hadn't seen the wonderful original on to seeing that film, and discovering what a fine film it is. This was a lousy attempt to introduce the classic to a new audience. Is there anything good?. Well, the atmosphere is pretty cool. The holiday songs that are played throughout work. The girls are attractive. The house is great. The extras are pretty decent. 3 alternate endings, deleted/extended scenes, and 2 decent documentaries, both of which run just shy of 30 minutes.

The visuals are there, and that's about it. There's one too many killers (and we see them way too early for a movie about ""calls coming from inside the house!""), a bloated, ugly back story that wasn't really necessary (though it's good for a few uncomfortable giggles), and virtually NO tension. I found the girls--both as characters AND as characterizations--to be so absolutely interchangeable that I literally lost track of who was who, and worse, stopped caring about them very early on. Even the hairstyles didn't help me; how sad is that? I kept getting this vibe that the director (Glen Morgan) was TRYING not to utilize the cinematic ""language"" and touchstones that have come to define the slasher genre sparked in large part by the original BLACK CHRISTMAS, which begs the question: why bother? Interview bites in the supplementary material reveal that Morgan does indeed hate many of the tropes of the genre he's working in with this film and was often forced to use them, and he's clearly still sore from the sting left by the critical and commercial failure of his first film, WILLARD, to the point where even he figures his directing career might be over if BLACK CHRISTMAS doesn't make a lot of money. Big surprise that it didn't. Turning genre cliches on their ears (especially with a concept like this one), or avoiding them altogether, takes a much surer hand than Morgan's. His partner James Wong probably has that hand, but then again, there's that  DRAGON BALL thingy, so . . . One piece of humor I found amusing in this otherwise humorless film: when dorky Eve (the only girl that didn't blend with the others) gives one of the other girls a gift of a glass unicorn because ""I know you're into the bible 'n stuff.""

Glen Morgan never attempts to recreate the suspense and mystery of the original, and instead delivers an absurdly hilarious and over-the-top gorefest to bring some holiday cheer to Horror fans. Once again, the Delta Alpha Kappa house is receiving intimidating phone calls on Christmas Eve, the same night when a deranged psychopath killed his family at that very house years earlier. What they don't know is that Billy has escaped from the mental institute and returned home for the holidays! From the very beginning, we are introduced to both villains, which destroys the ambiguity of the original story. In doing so, however, we get to see the makings of these two insane killers in a series of twisted flashbacks. It is no wonder Billy turned into such a model citizen given his pathetic childhood and abusive mother. Back on the loose, he and his inbred daughter wreak terror on the dopey sorority sisters in an eye-popping extravaganza of bloody mayhem! Literally, eye-popping, eye-eating, eye-stabbing... Morgan has found more ways to gouge out people's eyes than anyone ever thought possible! All the while, the onslaught of violence is set to the ironic ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" as one idiot character is mercilessly killed after another. Robert Mann's infuriated performance as Billy earns some great laughs as he sets up the character's building rage, but thankfully the mindless sorority girls are quickly dispatched.

1047040,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000MM0LIM,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 12]","Let's get right to the point: I truly hated ""Black Christmas,"" and I regret ever thinking that seeing it was in any way, shape, or form a good idea. This is a vile, ugly, mean spirited film, filled with characters that deserve absolutely no sympathy. I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who has not seen the original 1974 version directed by Bob Clark (and to think he would later go on to direct ""A Christmas Story""); all I could manage was to read an online plot synopsis. Nonetheless, reading a couple of paragraphs was a better experience than watching this 2006 remake, something so full of venom that it prevents the audience from getting the psychological high associated with watching a horror film. You're supposed to be thrilled when an onscreen victim is slaughtered. You're not supposed to be appalled.Apparently, this film offends certain religious groups who claim that a horror film shouldn't be released during the Christmas season. Don't get the wrong impression; I don't support their position, and I don't care one way or the other if a horror film is released this time of year. I hate this movie for very different reasons, namely that it's poorly acted, poorly written, and completely lacking in decency. If a horror film is going to be released in late December, it should at least be a good horror film, one that doesn't dehumanize the victim characters by making them spiteful and bitter. I didn't like a single character in this film; the way I see it, they're all just as lowly as the ones who actually commit crimes.As if that weren't bad enough, the story is completely implausible, going way past unbelievable and into the realm of utter ridiculousness. It begins when Clair Crosby (Leela Savasta) is upstairs in a room of her sorority house, signing her Christmas card for her sister. Almost immediately, she's killed off; a plastic bag is wrapped around her head, and for good measure, a fountain pen is jammed into her eye. It's interesting that no one heard such a commotion, considering everyone in the house is awake and within earshot. But considering the personalities of the other sorority sisters, it's easy to understand why they wouldn't have heard anything. We're introduced to Kelli (Katie Cassidy), Melissa (Michelle Trachtenberg), Heather (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Lauren (Crystal Lowe), Megan (Jessica Harmon), and Dana (Lacey Chabert), six of the most snobbish characters I've ever seen. They don't care about each other. They don't care about their clueless housemother, Ms. Mac (Andrea Martin, who also appeared in the 1974 version of the film). All they do is badmouth everyone.How convenient: they'll all be under the same roof during Christmas break. And because the weather outside is definitely frightful, with a snowstorm blocking access to the roads, they have nowhere to go. Such a hostile atmosphere doesn't seem right for the annual gift exchange, but they go ahead with it anyway. Of course, they can't exchange their own gifts until they open the one for Billy Lenz (played as an adult by Robert Mann), who as a child lived in the sorority house before it was used by the college. His legend is infamous; back in 1991, at the age of twenty-one, he murdered his mother and stepfather on Christmas Eve. Why the sisters keep this tradition alive is beyond me; Ms. Mac says it's all in good fun, but I find it hard to believe that anyone would feel the same way, especially during the Christmas season.Let's examine this legend a little more closely: Billy Lenz was born in 1970 with a defective liver, giving him yellow skin. His father (Peter Wilds) loved him, but his chain-smoking mother (Karin Konoval) despised him, seeing him only as another version of her husband (who she also despised). Some years later, near the Christmas holiday, she killed her husband and unceremoniously locked her son up in the attic. She then began a new life with her boyfriend (Howard Seigel), and soon after, another child entered the picture. Her name was Agnus (played as a child by Christina Crivici), and as you might expect, her mother loved her dearly. Then came that fateful night in 1991, when Billy completely snapped. Not only did he beat his mother to death with a rolling pin, he also used Christmas themed cookie cutters to slice away chunks of her flesh. He then baked and ate them, with a glass of milk to wash them down.Flash forward to the present day. Both Billy and his sister are in mental institutions, the former for obvious reasons, and the latter for reasons that are not quite so obvious. But whatever the circumstances, it's once again Christmastime, and Billy is determined to go back home. Let's skip all the murderous details and just say that he escapes through a series of convenient events, none of which are even remotely realistic.Back at the sorority house, the girls begin receiving strange phone calls, all of which have a demonic voice rambling, ""You're my family now."" It marks the point at which the bodies start piling up. The second half of this film is nothing more than routine slasher material, defined by a series of over the top death scenes. Common horror movie weapons, such as knives and axes, are replaced by an array of Christmas decorations, including pointy ornaments and strings of lights. I never thought I would see a film where such festive items could be seen as something scary. Even when the decorations aren't being used to bash someone's skull in, they still look bizarre; red and green Christmas lights are commonly seen, and not in a way that seem jolly and pleasant. They blink like caution signs and give the hallways an eerie glow. Not that they managed to make the film effective; if anything, they made the experience worse.I won't bother delving any further into this dismal plot: for one thing, there are a number of plot twists that I can't give away; for another thing, I simply don't care enough to continue. This is an awful, awful, awful movie. The only reason I'm giving it one star is because it's the lowest rating this website will allow. The reality is that it deserves no stars at all. I hated this film. It's unrealistic, it's unpleasant, and the characters' personalities are completely uncalled for.

1047042,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000MM0LIM,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 1]","If you're an aspiring screenwriter, it always helps to just watch one movie a whole bunch of times and make your own with some of your own twists to differentiate it and people won't call you a ripoff. That seems to be the in thing to do now since there have been so many remakes, or as they're called ""re-imaginings"" that you wonder what was the point in making it. Normally I would excuse such films but not in the case of the Black Christmas remake. Written and directed by Glen Morgan and produced by James Wong, it's hard to believe this film is brought to us by the guys who did some amazing episodes on the X-Files.It's Christmas time and a sorority is celebrating the night before they all go off with their families. Around this time, a murderer named Billy Lenz escapes from prison and he's heading to the sorority. Stricken with a liver disease that gives him yellowish skin, he has a weird fixation for eyeballs and he has it in mind to ruin the girls' night.Like a lot of recent horror films, there's a tendency to have the horror come through gore shots and if the phrase ""weird fixation for eyeballs"" doesn't give an idea for what you'll see then look elsewhere. Granted, there is a deleted scene included that's even more extreme yet at the same time, it's still quite gory and after awhile it wears thin. There's almost a sadistic quality in seeing girls not only suffocating through bags over their heads but to ALSO have one repeatedly stabbed is excessive and robs what's already a traumatic event. Another problem is giving the killer a backstory. Just like Leatherface, we can't just simply have characters face real evil and menace, it has to be people who have been screwed over by life and are lashing out. What was scary (when you didn't think about the cheesy stuff) was the fact people are being harassed by a kind of supernatural presence or evil personified and here it just makes everything seem ridiculous.If you're a guy, one good thing about the film is the amount of ladies on hand. From Buffy's Michelle Trachtenberg to Lacey Chabert (Party of Five) to Mary Elizabeth Winstead (of Final Destination 3), it's hard to watch cute ladies getting diced. Of course it doesn't help they all tend to play the same type which is sarcastic, spoiled rich-chick. We get Andrea Martin as well from the original but still, it's disappointing that they don't do much before each girl is ceremoniously offed.Is it worth a watch? Hard to say since only a rare few actually like it but it's hard to like something that's just so bad in the first place and convincing yourself there's some merit in here will take awhile.",2,Dumb and pointless yet watchable somehow,1176163200,"04 10, 2007",2007,2638,"[""'re"", 'aspiring', 'screenwriter', 'always', 'just', 'watch', 'one', 'movie', 'whole', 'bunch', 'times', 'make', 'own', 'own', 'twists', 'differentiate', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', 'ripoff', 'be', 'thing', 'do', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'remakes', ""'re"", 'called', 're-imaginings', 'wonder', 'was', 'point', 'making', 'Normally', 'would', 'excuse', 'such', 'films', 'not', 'case', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'remake', 'Written', 'directed', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'produced', 'James', 'Wong', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'brought', 'guys', 'who', 'did', 'amazing', 'episodes', 'X-Files.It', 'Christmas', 'time', 'sorority', 'celebrating', 'night', 'go', 'off', 'families', 'time', 'murderer', 'named', 'Billy', 'Lenz', 'prison', 'heading', 'sorority', 'Stricken', 'liver', 'disease', 'yellowish', 'skin', 'weird', 'fixation', 'eyeballs', 'mind', 'ruin', 'girls', 'lot', 'recent', 'horror', 'films', 'tendency', 'have', 'horror', 'come', 'gore', 'shots', 'phrase', 'weird', 'fixation', 'eyeballs', ""n't"", 'give', 'idea', 'what', ""'ll"", 'see', 'then', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Granted', 'deleted', 'scene', 'included', 'even', 'more', 'extreme', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'still', 'quite', 'gory', 'thin', 'almost', 'sadistic', 'quality', 'seeing', 'girls', 'not', 'only', 'suffocating', 'bags', 'heads', 'ALSO', 'have', 'one', 'repeatedly', 'stabbed', 'excessive', 'robs', 'what', 'already', 'traumatic', 'event', 'problem', 'giving', 'killer', 'backstory', 'Just', 'Leatherface', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'simply', 'have', 'characters', 'face', 'real', 'evil', 'menace', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'screwed', 'life', 'are', 'lashing', 'out', 'What', 'was', 'scary', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'cheesy', 'stuff', 'was', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'harassed', 'kind', 'supernatural', 'presence', 'evil', 'personified', 'here', 'just', 'everything', 'seem', 'ridiculous.If', ""'re"", 'guy', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'amount', 'ladies', 'hand', 'Buffy', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'Party', 'Five', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Final', 'Destination', '3', 'hard', 'watch', 'cute', 'ladies', 'getting', 'diced', 'course', ""n't"", 'help', 'tend', 'play', 'same', 'type', 'sarcastic', 'spoiled', 'rich-chick', 'get', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'still', 'disappointing', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'girl', 'ceremoniously', 'offed.Is', 'watch', 'Hard', 'say', 'only', 'rare', 'few', 'actually', 'hard', 'like', 'something', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'first', 'place', 'convincing', 'merit', 'here', 'will', 'take', 'awhile']",N/A

This remake/re-imagined version of Bob Clarks original blue-print masterpiece turned out to be pretty much exactly what the critics said it was.

There were scenes when these actors would display there talents and then there were scenes that the very same actor would just crap on there own talent. There was also some serious potential for the story but in the end that Kinda fell through as well. The biggest downfall of the movie was the dialog, it was very unrealistic and straight up lame and insulting to the viewer. This could very well be the explaination for the whole good actors acting bad situation. The sorrority sisters lovy dovy bond thing was pathetic and useless.

1047044,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B000MM0LIM,CryWolf854,"[2, 4]","I'm having a hard time understanding all the negative reviews coming from this title. Its a slasher movie people and its a Post Modern Safe one at that. Ever since Scream brought back the slasher craze, it seems that audiences want the same template which is make it fun, make it gory, but just try and make the gory parts a little cartoony so no one thinks its real. Basically every movie made by Dimension Films before House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects proved that the over 21 set craves ""a bit of the ole ultraviolence"". Black Xmas falls into this category.We have a group of sorority sisters who find themselves snowed in over the Christmas holiday. As it turns out, their house's mascot happens to be a boy named Billy who butchered his family in that very same house several years before the College bought the property. (Great idea for a mascot, ladies. Maniacs are so in the now right now.)Soon, they begin receiving obscene phone calls by a man calling himself Billy and before you know it, the girls begin disappearing one by one until only one or two are left to uncover the final piece of the mystery.I really had a lot of fun with this movie. Billy's backstory was certainly twisted and taboo when it comes to Billy's sexual relations with his own mother and the lineage of Agnes' birth. I even felt really bad for him having witness the murder of his dad whome apparently was the only one who loved him despite being married to that ugly hag version of Lady Macbeth. And the girls were likeable enough as well as sexy enough for me to root for some of their survival. The cast includes Katie Cassidy (""Supernatural""), Michelle Tractenberg (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), Lacey Chabert (Mean Girls), Mary Elizabeth Winestead (Final Destination 3), and Oliver Hudson (""The Rules of Engagment""). The kills were a little over-the-top but graphic enough to keep me interested; one girl gets the back of her head and scalp taken off via an iceskate. And best of all they all look young enough to still be in school whereas in the original the girls all looked way to old with the exception of sexy Olivia Hussy whom I guess only took the role to slum it between Zefferelli period flicks. And the little twist in the end was a nice little added surprise.All in all, its not a bad movie. There are certainly a lot worse ones than this one around (Planet Terror anyone?).

1047045,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000MM0LIM,Cubist,"[3, 7]","Bob Clark's Black Christmas was a clever little horror film that came out of Canada and spawned the slasher genre including, most notably John Carpenter's Halloween. Unfortunately, Clark's film isn't as celebrated or nearly as widely known as Carpenter's but they are both enjoying the remake treatment as of late with the creative team behind the Final Destination films reworking Black Christmas for a whole new generation.Glen Morgan adopts a garish red colour scheme in keeping with the holidays and this includes using blinking Christmas lights for atmospheric lighting. He also effectively uses the setting - a howling snowstorm - to keep the girls confined to the house while also providing a contrasting colour scheme of cool blue and white to the warm red of the interiors. Like Final Destination, this is a beautifully shot movie, even more so with the use of vibrant colours and creative camera angles. In a perverse twist, Morgan also uses a selection of holiday songs and classical Christmas music during some of the numerous murders in a tongue-in-cheek fashion but devoid of hip irony.If you've seen a slasher film from the 1980s then you pretty much know what's going to happen next but that hardly ruins the experience. There is almost something comforting about how it stringently adheres to formula. Black Christmas is a refreshing, old school slasher film that doesn't resort to the same kind of oh-so clever, self-reflexivity of the Scream films and instead remains faithful to the tried and true conventions of the genre including the seemingly indestructible killer motivated by a disturbing family past, and the last girl who must confront him. This is a great looking film that isn't overly ambitious but is very entertaining and a fitting tribute to the original cult classic.There are four deleted scenes, an extended scene and two alternate scenes. The excised footage establishes more atmosphere and shows more give-and-take between the girls as they try to figure out why their sisters have gone missing. There are also a couple of alternate death scenes for two of the characters.Also included are three alternate endings with one that leaves the fate of the surviving characters on a much more ambiguous note; another spells things out a little more while providing a red herring; and the last one leaves things much more open-ended.""What Have They Done?: The Remaking of Black Christmas"" takes a look at how this film was made.

1047046,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000MM0LIM,Dave. K,"[3, 3]","Horror purists weren't too happy about a remake to Bob Clark's 1974 cult classic Black Christmas, but don't go into the remake expecting anything like the original about the only thing this version has in common with the original, is the name and setting. We don't learn much about whom Billy or Agnes is. But in the remake that is all explained.Outside of the opening murder scene, Black Christmas 06 is a totally different movie. If anything this is more of a remake to your run of the mill 80s slasher movie. The original Black Christmas is one of the all time greats and I would recommend any aspiring horror filmmaker to watch it so they can learn how to craft a story, suspense and effective scares. The sense of dread and looming danger never lets up from the opening scene, even in the slower scenes that sense of dread remains. The same cannot be said about the remake; there really was very little suspense or tension. All that is replaced with a high body count and a lot of gore; at least there is some action something this movie needed. Violence and gore doesn't make a movie good, but at least something is happening and again this movie very much needed all of that.The script by Glen Morgan is rather weak; the characters are your standard slasher movie characters with very little depth. But one thing I did like is Kate Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg or Mary Elizabeth Winstead could have easily been the final girl. I won't spoil, which one of them is, but either one could have been. Glen Morgan was one of the writers of the first Final Destination, which I thought was excellent and he also did a good job with Willard, but here it's like a whole different filmmaker.As director Glen Morgan doesn't fair much better; his scenes lack any suspense or tension, but he does make a movie that is absolutely hysterical even if it wasn't the intentions of Glen Morgan. The flashback scenes are so silly and over the top one can't help, but be amused. The last flashback with Billy had me cracking up. Maybe that was the intention?The final act is so over the top I refuse to believe that Glen Morgan was making a serious movie. I think some of the problems were after Willard flopped Glen Morgan had trouble getting another job. On the DVD he clearly shows no passion for the project and says this isn't the type of movie he wanted to make. He's doing what the audience wants. Big mistake, as a filmmaker you have to do what you think is best. Of course you keep the audience in mind, but at the end of the day you have to make the movie you want. If you give in and make a movie you have no passion for it very much shows. I'm sure the Weinstein's played a part as well so I won't put all the blame on Glen Morgan. The Weinstein's are known for interfering with the movies they are involved in and I'm sure they played a part in the outcome.The kills scenes are pretty much the same, when someone is stabbed it's done with such rage, but instead of being scary or disturbing it's rather funny. When Billy stabs someone he does it so fast that odds are you'll be laughing rather than be freaked out. And when did Billy become a cannibal? I wasn't grossed out nor was I disturbed at that. I found it so silly that I couldn't help, but laugh.The cast is your typical cast you'll find in a lot of the more mainstream movies these days. With that said though the cast does do a good job and even though I prefer unknowns or cult actors in horror movies I was pleased with the cast. The one thing Black Christmas has going for it over other horror movies is the women are beautiful. Easily this is one the best looking casts I have ever seen in a horror flick.Just take the movie for what it is. What I found was a decent 80s style slasher movie that has the so bad its good quality. By no means is Black Christmas a good movie; several times I rolled my eyes, but I have to admit I was very entertained. As a remake this movie is no doubt a travesty of a remake, but as it's own film, while still bad, but works on the so bad its good level. I'll be the first to admit I had fun watching this and really enjoyed it.The original is by far the better movie and I highly recommend it, but again the remake is a fun film in how bad it is. Just try and put the original out of your head and take this for what it is; a silly slasher flick.",3,"Bad flick, but I'll admit I had a blast watching it",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,4346,"['Horror', 'purists', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'remake', 'Bob', 'Clark', '1974', 'cult', 'classic', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'remake', 'expecting', 'anything', 'original', 'only', 'thing', 'version', 'common', 'original', 'name', 'setting', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'much', 'whom', 'Billy', 'Agnes', 'remake', 'explained.Outside', 'opening', 'murder', 'scene', 'Black', 'Christmas', '06', 'totally', 'different', 'movie', 'anything', 'more', 'remake', 'run', 'mill', '80s', 'slasher', 'movie', 'original', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'one', 'time', 'greats', 'would', 'recommend', 'aspiring', 'horror', 'filmmaker', 'watch', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'craft', 'story', 'suspense', 'effective', 'scares', 'sense', 'dread', 'looming', 'danger', 'never', 'up', 'opening', 'scene', 'even', 'slower', 'scenes', 'sense', 'dread', 'remains', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'remake', 'really', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'tension', 'replaced', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'lot', 'gore', 'least', 'action', 'something', 'movie', 'needed', 'Violence', 'gore', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'least', 'something', 'happening', 'again', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'needed', 'that.The', 'script', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'rather', 'weak', 'characters', 'are', 'standard', 'slasher', 'movie', 'characters', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'Kate', 'Cassidy', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'final', 'girl', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'one', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'was', 'one', 'writers', 'first', 'Final', 'Destination', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'also', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Willard', 'here', 'whole', 'different', 'filmmaker.As', 'director', 'Glen', 'Morgan', ""n't"", 'fair', 'much', 'better', 'scenes', 'lack', 'suspense', 'tension', 'make', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'intentions', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'silly', 'top', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'amused', 'last', 'flashback', 'Billy', 'had', 'cracking', 'up', 'Maybe', 'was', 'intention', 'final', 'act', 'so', 'top', 'refuse', 'believe', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'was', 'making', 'serious', 'movie', 'think', 'problems', 'were', 'Willard', 'flopped', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'job', 'DVD', 'clearly', 'passion', 'project', ""n't"", 'type', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'doing', 'what', 'audience', 'Big', 'mistake', 'filmmaker', 'have', 'do', 'what', 'think', 'best', 'course', 'keep', 'audience', 'mind', 'end', 'day', 'have', 'make', 'movie', 'want', 'give', 'make', 'movie', 'have', 'passion', 'very', 'much', 'shows', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Weinstein', 'played', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'put', 'blame', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'Weinstein', 'are', 'known', 'interfering', 'movies', 'are', 'involved', ""'m"", 'sure', 'played', 'part', 'outcome.The', 'kills', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'when', 'someone', 'stabbed', 'done', 'such', 'rage', 'instead', 'being', 'scary', 'disturbing', 'rather', 'funny', 'When', 'Billy', 'someone', 'so', 'fast', 'odds', 'are', ""'ll"", 'be', 'laughing', 'rather', 'be', 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'did', 'Billy', 'become', 'cannibal', 'was', ""n't"", 'grossed', 'out', 'was', 'disturbed', 'found', 'so', 'silly', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh.The', 'cast', 'typical', 'cast', ""'ll"", 'find', 'lot', 'more', 'mainstream', 'movies', 'days', 'said', 'cast', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'even', 'prefer', 'unknowns', 'cult', 'actors', 'horror', 'movies', 'was', 'pleased', 'cast', 'one', 'thing', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'going', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Easily', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'casts', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'flick.Just', 'take', 'movie', 'what', 'What', 'found', 'was', 'decent', '80s', 'style', 'slasher', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'quality', 'means', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'good', 'movie', 'several', 'times', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'very', 'entertained', 'remake', 'movie', 'doubt', 'travesty', 'remake', 'own', 'film', 'still', 'bad', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'level', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'original', 'far', 'better', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'again', 'remake', 'fun', 'film', 'how', 'bad', 'Just', 'try', 'put', 'original', 'head', 'take', 'what', 'silly', 'slasher', 'flick']",N/A

1047048,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000MM0LIM,David Girod,"[0, 0]","For the past year I've heard that the remake of ""Black Christmas"" was simply awful. Finally gearing myself up for a viewing after picking it up for $2 I steeled myself for the awfulness to follow.I was actually surprised. No, ""Black Christmas"" is not a great horror film, and when compared to the original it downright blows. But, viewed on it's own, it's a passable slasher flick. Let me clarify a bit. When I want to see a slasher horror flick, I really don't need much storyline other than hapless victims who've stumbled into some deranged killers path. ""Black Christmas"" does this fairly well, in that an escaped killer returns to his childhood home. Unfortunately, the killer's home now houses a sorority. The body count is fairly high, the gore effects are passable, and the college sorority sisters are hot. So while ""Black Christmas"" isn't really scary, it does satisfy the slasher flick craving fairly well.Of course, there is plenty of stuff to tear apart in the flick. The Yellow-Highlighter-Skin-Toned killer is absurd looking, the incest angle is laughably bad as is the killer peeping through floorboards, holes in the ceilings and walls and shower stalls. Instead of creating suspense, it just comes off like a horror film cliche being spoofed. But I can live with it.I think the biggest issue this movie faced, was calling itself ""Black Christmas"". Like Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"", long time fans of the horror genre cannot help but compare the original to the remake of these classics, and almost always the remake will pale in comparison. If this had been released under a different title, or even as a possible sequel to the Bob Clark original, I think fans may have been a little more forgiving. As it stands, ""Black Christmas"" will forever be linked to the mulititude of other failed horror remakes: ""House of Wax"", ""Prom Night"" and ""The Fog"". Still, if you enjoy slasher flicks, and can put the original out of your head, ""Black Christmas"" isn't too bad.",3,The Real Problem was Tying it to the Original,1229040000,"12 12, 2008",2008,1975,"['past', 'year', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'was', 'simply', 'awful', 'Finally', 'gearing', 'up', 'viewing', 'picking', '2', 'steeled', 'awfulness', 'follow.I', 'was', 'actually', 'surprised', 'No', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'not', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'downright', 'blows', 'viewed', 'own', 'passable', 'slasher', 'flick', 'Let', 'clarify', 'bit', 'When', 'want', 'see', 'slasher', 'horror', 'flick', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'much', 'storyline', 'other', 'hapless', 'victims', 'who', ""'ve"", 'stumbled', 'deranged', 'killers', 'path', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'fairly', 'well', 'escaped', 'killer', 'returns', 'childhood', 'home', 'Unfortunately', 'killer', 'home', 'now', 'houses', 'sorority', 'body', 'count', 'fairly', 'high', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'passable', 'college', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'are', 'hot', 'So', 'Black', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'satisfy', 'slasher', 'flick', 'craving', 'fairly', 'well.Of', 'course', 'plenty', 'stuff', 'tear', 'apart', 'flick', 'Yellow-Highlighter-Skin-Toned', 'killer', 'absurd', 'looking', 'incest', 'angle', 'laughably', 'bad', 'killer', 'peeping', 'floorboards', 'holes', 'ceilings', 'walls', 'shower', 'stalls', 'Instead', 'creating', 'suspense', 'just', 'off', 'horror', 'film', 'cliche', 'being', 'spoofed', 'can', 'live', 'it.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'issue', 'movie', 'faced', 'was', 'calling', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'Halloween', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'horror', 'genre', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'compare', 'original', 'remake', 'classics', 'almost', 'always', 'remake', 'will', 'pale', 'comparison', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'different', 'title', 'even', 'possible', 'sequel', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'original', 'think', 'fans', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'forgiving', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'linked', 'mulititude', 'other', 'failed', 'horror', 'remakes', 'House', 'Wax', 'Prom', 'Night', 'Fog', 'Still', 'enjoy', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'can', 'put', 'original', 'head', 'Black', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad']",N/A

This maniacal Twinkie-yellow serial killer is watching you intently through a crack or a knothole, clawing compulsively at his dark surroundings while he loosely plans your ghastly demise. Envision your eyeball dangling limply from the branch of a Christmas tree, the moistly exposed nerve matter reflecting the rhythmic bursts of bright red string lights.Merry Christmas everyone! Just try to pretend that it's that magic time of the year for the duration of this humble review. I only recently got around to seeing this movie, and I somewhat enjoyed it. It seemed disconcerting that the movie had garnished so many negative reviews. While there would be no way possible of duplicating the slippery and monstrous energy of the original Black Christmas, it seems unfair to dismiss this movie as nothing but an inferior remake. Black X-Mas just goes in a different direction, unabashedly exposing the viewer to buckets of gore in the process of tracing the heartwarming misadventures of Billy and Agnes.From a male perspective, it's always refreshing to see a cast crowded with pretty girls; the downside of course is that most of the girls end up dying hideously and comprising a gruesome Yuletide tableau in the attic. Black X-Mas attempts to make sense of the crazed telephone ramblings of the unknown killer from the original Black X-Mas. Billy Lenz finally succeeds in escaping from his cell at the local hospital ward for the criminally insane. Billy returns to his old house, which has now been refurbished into a sorority house.Billy's story is told in flashbacks. A peculiar condition turned his skin deep yellow. His buzzard-like mother hated him. The father, on the other hand, seemed to like Billy, although the father was later murdered by the mother and her lowlife boyfriend. Billy watched the murder as it occurred; the mother and boyfriend, failing to catch him, locked him in the attic. Over the course of time Billy became adept at crawling throughout the internals and hollows of the house. Eventually he killed his mother and made Christmas cookies from angel-shaped patches cut from the skin on her back. Now, in the present day, Billy has returned to start a brand new family. Family = Death.Final Analysis: The movie had its flaws. The sorority girls did varyingly commit some stupid blunders in the process of trying to escape Billy's tough love, but it should be noted that virtually no horror movie scenario can take place without someone, somewhere, doing something stupid. Take it all with a grain of salt. Give yourself the gift that will keep on giving the whole year through. The Black X-Mas DVD includes deleted scenes, three alternate endings, and a couple of small documentaries.And hey, I'll see you all at the Christmas party!",4,I'm eating your eyeballs.

1047064,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,B000MM0LIM,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 2]","Inferior remakes of classic horror movies are the reality of today's horror genre. Most of the remakes are terrible, but many of us horror film lovers go see them anyway out of curiosity.  You know what they say, ""curiosity killed the cat""--as well as my wallet.  As we all know, the very idea of horror film remakes represents a lack of imagination on the part of today's Hollywood.  The horror genre obviously isn't what it used to be, and with movies being produced like the remake of ""The Fog"", it just can't get much worse...or can it?Before I even begin to dissect this remake, I want to make it clear that I think that the original ""Black Christmas"" is one of the greatest horror movies ever produced.  The remake of ""Black Christmas"" involves an insane killer (who killed certain members of his family) who escapes from a mental institution to go on another killing rampage.  This idea is a bit different from the plot of the original ""Black Christmas"" in that the killer in the original film was very mysterious throughout the film, whereas the remake attempts to create a motive for Billy's insanity.  I think the original is more with less.  In other words, by keeping the audience in the dark, the original makes it that much more uncomfortable for the audience, and the killer is scarier that way as opposed to the ""in your face"" style of the remake.  From that standpoint, as well as every other standpoint, the original is clearly superior to the remake.Unfortunately, the liberties that the creators of the remake took with the remaking of this film were largely ill-advised.  Comparisons aside, I must confess that I really disliked the twist in this remake as I felt that it was a rather rash and poorly concocted idea that was unimaginative, unnecessary and completely ineffective.  As far as the good for the remake, the repetitiveness of the ""Nutcracker"" music was a plus in the way it was used insofar as it was effective at producing a creepy atmosphere during Christmas.  I also liked the colored Christmas lights as I thought that this visual aspect along with the music made for an eerie little Christmas setting and an effective horror movie atmosphere; thus, the two stars instead of zero stars.  It's amazing how colors and music can make a big difference in the setting and atmosphere for a given horror movie.  However, with that being said, the creators of this flick really didn't do much with the horror film atmosphere they were able to generate.In this movie, the kills were just okay, but nothing to write home about.  Moreover, there was very little suspense or tension in the movie.  In fact, the movie did not flow well at all, causing it to be boring at times.  It almost seemed like the creators of this flick got lost or didn't know what to do shortly after the film started and, consequently, they tried to fill space with some flashbacks regarding Billy's upbringing, an ill-advised subplot regarding Billy's littler sister, and kills that seemed just thrown in there.  The dialogue was absolutely pathetic, and the characters were largely undeveloped, unlikable and generic.Another criticism of this remake is that the ending seemed forced and very unnatural, almost like they knew that the remake was so inferior to the original that they had to try something over the top.  In short, this movie was unable to sustain any momentum or deliver any consistent horror whatsoever despite the early success with the setting and atmosphere.  While it was set up fairly well, the remake of ""Black Christmas never really got off the ground.Overall, this was a rather disappointing movie.  Still, there is a degree of entertainment value with this movie, but nothing to write home about.  There are very few effective Christmas horror movies, and this one really isn't one of them, but the atmosphere and situation of the movie allows for an effective horror movie setting, but, ultimately, there's just no meat on the bones here.  Indeed, the real losers in this movie were the script, the twist, the acting and the execution of this movie, all of which represent a serious step down from the perfection of the original classic.  I feel like Santa Claus by giving this movie 2 STARS, but that's only for the good setting and atmosphere (which I'm very big on) the movie created along with a few decent kills indicative of a fairly decent slasher.  These are the only qualities that make this movie consumable in any way.  That being said, the remake of ""Black Christmas"" isn't a very scary movie at all, and, quite honestly, that's not nearly enough to make this into a good movie.  My advice is to buy the original classic, but only rent the remake if that curiosity I spoke of above gets the better of you.",2,Couldn't sustain early success with atmosphere and setting.,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,4746,"['Inferior', 'remakes', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'reality', 'today', 'horror', 'genre', 'Most', 'remakes', 'are', 'terrible', 'many', 'horror', 'film', 'lovers', 'go', 'see', 'anyway', 'curiosity', 'know', 'what', 'say', 'curiosity', 'killed', 'cat', 'as', 'well', 'wallet', 'know', 'very', 'idea', 'horror', 'film', 'lack', 'imagination', 'part', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'horror', 'genre', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'what', 'used', 'be', 'movies', 'being', 'produced', 'remake', 'Fog', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'worse', 'can', 'even', 'begin', 'dissect', 'remake', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'think', 'original', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'movies', 'ever', 'produced', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'insane', 'killer', 'who', 'killed', 'certain', 'members', 'family', 'who', 'escapes', 'mental', 'institution', 'go', 'killing', 'rampage', 'idea', 'bit', 'different', 'plot', 'original', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'killer', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'mysterious', 'film', 'remake', 'attempts', 'create', 'motive', 'Billy', 'insanity', 'think', 'original', 'more', 'less', 'other', 'words', 'keeping', 'audience', 'dark', 'original', 'much', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'audience', 'killer', 'scarier', 'way', 'opposed', 'face', 'style', 'remake', 'standpoint', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'standpoint', 'original', 'clearly', 'superior', 'remake.Unfortunately', 'liberties', 'creators', 'remake', 'took', 'remaking', 'film', 'were', 'largely', 'ill-advised', 'Comparisons', 'aside', 'must', 'confess', 'really', 'disliked', 'twist', 'remake', 'felt', 'was', 'rather', 'rash', 'poorly', 'concocted', 'idea', 'was', 'unimaginative', 'unnecessary', 'completely', 'ineffective', 'As', 'far', 'good', 'remake', 'repetitiveness', 'Nutcracker', 'music', 'was', 'plus', 'way', 'was', 'used', 'insofar', 'was', 'effective', 'producing', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'Christmas', 'also', 'liked', 'colored', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'thought', 'visual', 'aspect', 'music', 'made', 'eerie', 'little', 'Christmas', 'setting', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'thus', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'zero', 'stars', 'amazing', 'how', 'colors', 'music', 'can', 'make', 'big', 'difference', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'given', 'horror', 'movie', 'However', 'being', 'said', 'creators', 'flick', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'horror', 'film', 'were', 'able', 'generate.In', 'movie', 'kills', 'were', 'just', 'okay', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Moreover', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'suspense', 'tension', 'movie', 'fact', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'causing', 'be', 'boring', 'times', 'almost', 'seemed', 'creators', 'flick', 'got', 'lost', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'shortly', 'film', 'started', 'consequently', 'tried', 'fill', 'space', 'flashbacks', 'regarding', 'Billy', 'upbringing', 'ill-advised', 'subplot', 'regarding', 'Billy', 'littler', 'sister', 'kills', 'seemed', 'just', 'thrown', 'there', 'dialogue', 'was', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'were', 'largely', 'undeveloped', 'unlikable', 'generic.Another', 'criticism', 'remake', 'ending', 'seemed', 'forced', 'very', 'unnatural', 'almost', 'knew', 'remake', 'was', 'so', 'inferior', 'original', 'had', 'try', 'something', 'top', 'short', 'movie', 'was', 'unable', 'sustain', 'momentum', 'deliver', 'consistent', 'horror', 'early', 'success', 'setting', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'off', 'ground.Overall', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'Still', 'degree', 'entertainment', 'value', 'movie', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'effective', 'Christmas', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'really', ""n't"", 'one', 'atmosphere', 'situation', 'movie', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'setting', 'ultimately', 'just', 'meat', 'bones', 'here', 'Indeed', 'real', 'losers', 'movie', 'were', 'script', 'twist', 'acting', 'execution', 'movie', 'represent', 'serious', 'step', 'down', 'perfection', 'original', 'classic', 'feel', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'giving', 'movie', '2', 'STARS', 'only', 'good', 'setting', 'atmosphere', ""'m"", 'very', 'big', 'movie', 'created', 'along', 'few', 'decent', 'kills', 'indicative', 'fairly', 'decent', 'slasher', 'are', 'only', 'qualities', 'make', 'movie', 'consumable', 'way', 'being', 'said', 'remake', 'Black', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'movie', 'quite', 'honestly', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'advice', 'buy', 'original', 'classic', 'only', 'rent', 'remake', 'curiosity', 'spoke', 'better']",N/A

Just trying to think of all the words to describe this piece of trash. It doesn't deserve one out of five stars, it deserves none. I have no idea who put up the money to make this, but they should ask for a refund. I know I will. Not only do I feel like I need a shower, but I wasted enough money for a McDonald's happy meal on this (insert explicative here).It is the same cycle repeating itself over and over throughout the movie and its pathetic attempt to build suspense is really just telegraphing every move leaving nothing to the imagination or spontaneity.The acting is on par with a typical teenage slasher movie. The gore was overly gratuitous involving a lot of eyeballs often leaving me sick to the stomach. I think they must have had an overage of fake eyes on the set and needed a way to use them. And why do bad horror movies always look to incest as a shortcut to terror? Its so unnecessary. Its almost like a cheap way out because you don't have any better ideas. To make matters worse, the editor and writer should remember some consistency. Hair and eye color changes and one moment someone is accounted for, the next not, for no particular reason.

This classic masterpiece spawned countless imitations that included ""Halloween,"" ""House on Sorority Row,"" ""A Stranger is Calling,"" and ""The Demon.""  It was inevitable that a remake would eventually be released.What it lacks in suspense, realism, and mystery, this ""Black Christmas"" re-imagining more than makes up for in gore and a high body count.  Modern horror fans will love it!  ""Let the Slay Ride Begin"" is one of the truest tag lines I've ever read for a movie.  Though I'm not a big fan of gratuitous, over-the-top gore, I do love a high body count and this film definitely has it.  I estimated about twenty deaths total.  Sure, there are plenty of plot holes.  For instance, why is the killer able to get to the sorority house through the snow storm but the girls can't leave?  And why couldn't they run to a neighbor's house for help?  Most sorority houses are located adjacent to campus, not in the secluded boonies.  However, like I've always said, if you want realism, watch the news.  That will definitely ruin your holidays.The cast is an excellent one and consists of some of the most beautiful, young talent you will ever see assembled in one horror film.  Unfortunately, there were too many brunettes in this bimbo sorority house; after a few glasses of wine, they all began to look alike.""The ""Black Christmas"" remake has enough nonstop action and killing to keep you awake.  It's a slay ride from beginning to end - an amusement ride you don't want to stop.

Just try to ignore that this is a remake of a classic trendsetter and take this for what it is: an 80s-style slasher movie in which gore is celebrated and a shower scene is simply there to deliver bare breasts rather than to convey a sense of vulnerability and ""will she die"" tension.In this is a remake of the 1974 classic Black Christmas, the girls of Alpha Kappa are again slaughtered during Christmas break.Our Alpha Kappas include Kelly (Katie Cassidy), Melissa (Michelle Trachtenberg), Heather (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dana (Lacey Chabert).  To prime the story the girls and their house mother Ms. Mac (Andrea Martin; Phyl of the original Black Christmas) retell the story of Billy the Black Christmas killer, his twisted childhood and his daughter...This background story spends far too much time explaining why Billy is the way he is much as the Halloween (2007) remake did for Michael Myers.  In fact, any explanation is too much explanation.  Both Billy and Michael Myers were originally scary for the same reason: no one knew why they killed or what motivated them.  They just killed without reason and it was terrifying.  This attempt to justify the killer's psyche is an excellent example of how exposition truly is the death of good horror.Another unfortunate fault is that the sorority girls all have very similar personalities.  Sure, one of them gets drunk (probably attempting to mimic Margot Kidder's lushy debutante role from the original) and another is homesick, but under the surface these characters may as well be spun from the same mold.  Stacking on the faults, this movie even failed to capture the creepiness of the call coming from ""inside the house.""  Not because it's now been done so many times, but because it was too hammed up to be creepy.  CALL ""COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE"" FAIL!!!This has a classically perfect set up.  A bunch of attractive college girls are blizzard-bound in their sorority house over Christmas break and an escaped, murderous mental patient who used to live in their house is on the loose.  Through homogenous characters and exposition the story is ruined.  But through brutal, gory deaths an entertaining movie experience was salvaged-for those of us who are in to that anyway.The gore is brutal and abrupt.  Our killer doesn't toy with his victims once they're within reach.  He's really quite the dynamic slayer.  Early on he sets the pace when he gauges then tears out an eyeball with no warning from his still-living coed victim.  In fact, eyeball-gore seems to be a pleasant theme, often accompanied by tongue-in-cheek cannibalism.  We also get some brutally prolonged beatings-to-death, lots of stabbing, loads of gore, and some gore-slathered sound-editing to really bring it together.  Some may say the sloppy-squishy sound effects were overdone.  Perhaps...but overdone damned well!  Gorehounds will be pleased for sure.

Black Christmas is a dull, repetitive slasher.This film isn't a direct remake of the original; in fact, it removes much of the original story. Instead, we get a story that moves from past to present often to tell the story of Billy. This back story was very inconsistent, mainly due to the short runtime and fast pace that ended up taking away from the disturbing backstory. The characters are dull and generic and we never get a proper introduction to them, so I didn't really care for them. There was no build-up, or suspense. I know a few viewers that disliked the original's slow pace (I liked it), but this film simply moves to fast to create a impactful or shocking experience. And the biggest offense, in my opinion, was the extremely underwhelming phone calls in this remake; the original film had some very unsettling, very disturbing phone calls that were the highlight of the film. The ending of the film drags on and is very predictable. The acting was okay, usually bad but often good. Fans of gory horror films will probably enjoy it, the special effects were actually decent; the film packs a lot of violence including eye removal and cannibalism.Overall, Black Christmas is an underwhelming slasher that suffers from the same flaws many other modern horror films suffer from; the decent special effects and gore may redeem the film for some viewers, at least by a slight margin.

As they slowly start disappearing and their numbers dwindle they finally sense that something weird is going on. When blood appears they realize that the house they have lived in hasn't always been a sorority house but a home to a madman, locked away in prison for horrendous crimes that seems to have broken out....One by one they meet some gristly death, and that's what was actually gory, the death scenes were gruesome, focusing on a certain body part, the eye ball. Much more I dare not say but I enjoyed the creepy beginning as something evil stirs in the darkness and quietly starts to take the house apart from the inside out. The characters were pretty much one dimensional, not likable much and there for great prey for the killer as  I can easily say that the not so bright sorority stars who were more likely to be makeup artists than serious scholars almost deserved their fates, that is if they made it all through the night.The bad parts were the bizarre details, the freaky mother and sister of the killer, the glow in the dark skin, what was that about, what psycho madman glows in the dark? It gave me a few chuckles, the incest scene, brief and pretty much not shown still left a weird taste behind but I liked the twist that reveled itself towards the end and also the fact that the killer wasn't working alone but with someone who seemed to betray them all was a great add on. I really liked the Christmas spirit through the movie, the sorority house was really beautiful and made me miss snow and warm cider, decorations and the resiny scent of pine almost filled my nostrils. There were some cozy and creepy parts but they were broken up by chicks who acted dumb and strange madman behavior that was not explained at times. Overall a good horror flick but I'm still a bit split over it, saying that I'm glad I saw it, as it had a certain quality that fulfilled my horror flick appetite for that night.If I had to give my own rating and really nit pick, I'd say it's a 3  star movie but I gave it a 4 because I enjoyed it more than I complained about it so there....- Kasia S.",4,"Jingle bells, your fear smells...like Christmas spirit",1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,2499,"['lover', 'horror', 'movies', 'classy', 'cheesy', 'spooky', 'blood', 'soaked', 'hair', 'rinsing', 'scary', 'subtle', 'terror', 'subplots', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'had', 'little', 'bit', 'yet', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'together', 'as', 'smoothly', 'wished.Few', 'girls', 'are', 'staying', 'snow', 'covered', 'sorority', 'house', 'Christmas', 'Season', 'only', 'discover', 'are', 'being', 'harassed', 'phone', 'maniac', 'slowly', 'start', 'disappearing', 'numbers', 'dwindle', 'finally', 'sense', 'something', 'weird', 'going', 'When', 'blood', 'realize', 'house', 'have', 'lived', ""n't"", 'always', 'been', 'sorority', 'house', 'home', 'madman', 'locked', 'away', 'prison', 'horrendous', 'crimes', 'have', 'broken', 'out', '.One', 'one', 'meet', 'gristly', 'death', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'gory', 'death', 'scenes', 'were', 'gruesome', 'focusing', 'certain', 'body', 'part', 'eye', 'ball', 'Much', 'more', 'dare', 'not', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'creepy', 'beginning', 'something', 'evil', 'stirs', 'darkness', 'quietly', 'take', 'house', 'apart', 'inside', 'characters', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'dimensional', 'not', 'likable', 'much', 'there', 'great', 'prey', 'killer', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'sorority', 'stars', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'likely', 'be', 'makeup', 'artists', 'serious', 'scholars', 'almost', 'deserved', 'fates', 'made', 'night.The', 'bad', 'parts', 'were', 'bizarre', 'details', 'freaky', 'mother', 'sister', 'killer', 'glow', 'dark', 'skin', 'what', 'was', 'what', 'psycho', 'madman', 'glows', 'dark', 'gave', 'few', 'chuckles', 'incest', 'scene', 'brief', 'pretty', 'much', 'not', 'shown', 'still', 'left', 'weird', 'taste', 'liked', 'twist', 'reveled', 'end', 'also', 'fact', 'killer', 'was', ""n't"", 'working', 'alone', 'someone', 'who', 'seemed', 'betray', 'was', 'great', 'add', 'really', 'liked', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'movie', 'sorority', 'house', 'was', 'really', 'beautiful', 'made', 'miss', 'snow', 'warm', 'cider', 'decorations', 'resiny', 'scent', 'pine', 'almost', 'filled', 'nostrils', 'were', 'cozy', 'creepy', 'parts', 'were', 'broken', 'up', 'chicks', 'who', 'acted', 'dumb', 'strange', 'madman', 'behavior', 'was', 'not', 'explained', 'times', 'Overall', 'good', 'horror', 'flick', ""'m"", 'still', 'bit', 'split', 'saying', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'had', 'certain', 'quality', 'fulfilled', 'horror', 'flick', 'appetite', 'night.If', 'had', 'give', 'own', 'rating', 'really', 'nit', 'pick', ""'d"", 'say', '3', 'star', 'movie', 'gave', '4', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'complained', 'so', 'there', '.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

1047090,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000MM0LIM,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[16, 23]","NOTE: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS THINGS THAT ARE NORMALLY CALLED ""SPOILERS.""  HOWEVER, THE WORD ""SPOILERS"" INSINUATES THAT SOMETHING IS FRESH OR NEW TO BEGIN WITH.  SINCE THIS MOVIE IS NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS, LET'S JUST SAY THAT THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS ""RE-SPOILERS.""If there's one thing wrong with ""Black Christmas"" (and, trust me, there's a lot more than one), it's that it hardly feels like a movie at all.  The movie is as hollow as a shiny, Christmas tree ball, all shiny gleaming glass with absolutely nothing underneath.We have the requisites for some mindless horror here: a sorority house full of girls, a road-blocking blizzard, and an escaped mental patient, but, amazingly, this trite little flick fails to do anything even remotely interesting, creative, or suspenseful with these paint-by-numbers elements.  Instead, what we are given is a rushed, uninspired mess, something that plays out like the bare outline of a horror movie script.  I felt like I was watching a treatment of a film idea, and not the actual movie itself.For instance, character development is virtually nonexistent (according to this movie, not only are sorority girls indistinguishable from each other, but they are also all very crabby and self-centered).  This makes it much harder (much, much, so much harder) to care when they are hastily and unceremoniously dispatched by the Killer On The Loose.  The murders themselves never come as a surprise; the movie takes great pains to let you know what's coming.  It's okay for a horror film to be mindless (by all means), but not if it is also lazy and predictable.This movie is both.  It is barely seventy minutes long, but each second scrapes by, relying on token effects (eerie Santa decorations, blood red Christmas lights, lethal Christmas presents) to convey a mood and urgency that the script itself can't be bothered to provide.  Likewise, the heavy lifting of the plot (near misses, motives, and twists) is handled laughably with an improbable story and the eye-rolling inconsistencies.For example, a normally easy fear-builder -- the Call From Inside The House -- is so overdone with vocal effects that you'll be wondering less about the fate of the characters and more about how the killer manages to make himself sound like five different people ... at the same time ... while adding in spooky static hisses and screams ... without alerting anyone to his presence inside the house.  Perhaps he is a demon, calling from another dimension?  No, I'm sorry, he is not.  That would've been too interesting.  Another question: what kind of EMT bags a person who is not dead?  You'll find out!  Are icicles heavy enough to fall straight through a person's skull from a ten foot drop?  Sure!  Some of them!So, what is this movie then?  It's quite simple.  It's an excuse to watch the dull and dumb deaths of roughly a dozen people, most of them young, trash-talking bimbos.  If you want suspense, atmosphere, uncertainty or even just creative gore, you are looking in the wrong place.  If you want goofy exposition, fifth grade dialogue, and an ending that will make you scream, ""Finish already!"" and ""What?  That's it?"" at almost the exact same time, then this movie is your cup of eggnog.",1,"Ho, Ho, Horrible",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",2007,3240,"['NOTE', 'FOLLOWING', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'THINGS', 'THAT', 'ARE', 'NORMALLY', 'CALLED', 'SPOILERS', 'HOWEVER', 'THE', 'WORD', 'SPOILERS', 'SOMETHING', 'IS', 'FRESH', 'OR', 'NEW', 'TO', 'BEGIN', 'WITH', 'SINCE', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'IS', 'NEITHER', 'OF', 'THOSE', 'THINGS', 'LET', 'JUST', 'SAY', 'THE', 'FOLLOWING', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'RE-SPOILERS', 'one', 'thing', 'wrong', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'trust', 'lot', 'more', 'one', 'hardly', 'movie', 'movie', 'as', 'hollow', 'shiny', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ball', 'shiny', 'gleaming', 'glass', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'underneath.We', 'have', 'requisites', 'mindless', 'horror', 'here', 'sorority', 'house', 'full', 'girls', 'road-blocking', 'blizzard', 'escaped', 'mental', 'patient', 'amazingly', 'trite', 'little', 'flick', 'fails', 'do', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'creative', 'suspenseful', 'paint-by-numbers', 'elements', 'Instead', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'rushed', 'uninspired', 'mess', 'something', 'out', 'bare', 'outline', 'horror', 'movie', 'script', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'treatment', 'film', 'idea', 'not', 'actual', 'movie', 'itself.For', 'instance', 'character', 'development', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'according', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'sorority', 'girls', 'indistinguishable', 'other', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'crabby', 'self-centered', 'much', 'harder', 'much', 'much', 'so', 'much', 'harder', 'care', 'when', 'are', 'hastily', 'unceremoniously', 'dispatched', 'Killer', 'Loose', 'murders', 'never', 'come', 'surprise', 'movie', 'great', 'pains', 'let', 'know', 'what', 'coming', 'okay', 'horror', 'film', 'be', 'mindless', 'means', 'not', 'also', 'lazy', 'predictable.This', 'movie', 'barely', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'long', 'second', 'scrapes', 'relying', 'token', 'effects', 'eerie', 'Santa', 'decorations', 'blood', 'red', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'lethal', 'Christmas', 'presents', 'convey', 'mood', 'urgency', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'provide', 'Likewise', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'plot', 'misses', 'motives', 'twists', 'handled', 'laughably', 'improbable', 'story', 'eye-rolling', 'inconsistencies.For', 'example', 'normally', 'easy', 'fear-builder', 'Call', 'From', 'House', 'so', 'overdone', 'vocal', 'effects', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'less', 'fate', 'characters', 'more', 'how', 'killer', 'make', 'five', 'different', 'people', 'same', 'time', 'adding', 'spooky', 'static', 'hisses', 'screams', 'alerting', 'anyone', 'presence', 'house', 'Perhaps', 'demon', 'calling', 'dimension', 'No', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'not', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'too', 'interesting', 'question', 'what', 'kind', 'EMT', 'person', 'who', 'not', 'dead', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'Are', 'heavy', 'enough', 'fall', 'straight', 'person', 'skull', 'ten', 'foot', 'drop', 'Sure', 'So', 'what', 'movie', 'then', 'quite', 'simple', 'excuse', 'watch', 'dull', 'dumb', 'deaths', 'roughly', 'dozen', 'people', 'most', 'young', 'trash-talking', 'bimbos', 'want', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'uncertainty', 'even', 'just', 'creative', 'gore', 'are', 'looking', 'wrong', 'place', 'want', 'goofy', 'exposition', 'fifth', 'grade', 'dialogue', 'ending', 'will', 'make', 'scream', 'Finish', 'already', 'What', 'almost', 'exact', 'same', 'time', 'then', 'movie', 'cup', 'eggnog']",N/A

Over 30 years later, this needless remake of the classic horror film is here, and it's brought to us by none other than former X-Files crew member Glen Morgan, who is also responsible for the Willard remake of a few years ago, as well as producer of Final Destination.  Sadly though, Morgan is unable to inject any kind of originality into this remake, which is a shame considering the solid job I felt he did with Willard.  The story, and I use that with the slightest sense of the word, involves a college sorority (featuring Katie Cassidy, Michelle Trachtenberg, and rising star Mary Elizabeth Winstead from the Morgan produced Final Destination 3) who are picked off one by one by a killer who has an eyeball [...].  Despite having some nice gore scenes and inventive kills, Black Christmas never takes off thanks to some horrible acting, and sad to say, inept direction.  It's boring and utterly predictable until the very end, which is sad considering of all the needless horror remakes of late, this one had the most potential.

1047104,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000MM0LIM,Only-A-Child,"[2, 3]","You have to make certain allowances for the familial horror genre and the sorority house sub-genre, as their target audiences do not place a premium on intelligent scripting, even the few of them who actually have the capacity to appreciate it. Yet even by the low brain wattage standards of its genre, ""Black Xmas"" (2006) ranks pretty near the bottom.It you are looking for self-parody elements the pickings are very slim. The only good one is what the production designers did in setting up the 1991 flashback scene of the kitchen. Instead of a 1991 kitchen they give you a 1948ish ""Christmas Story"" kitchen complete with a returnable glass milk bottle, a self-reflexive reference to that film's director Bob Clark, who also directed the original ""Black Christmas"" (1974). More obvious is having Michelle Trachtenberg's character impaled on an ice skate blade (insert ""Ice Princess"" 2005 here).It used to be that even when this type of film failed on multiple levels: stupid plot (insert talent challenged here), impossibly contrived story (insert lazy here), implausibly indestructible and all-knowing villain (insert lazy again), bad acting and directing (insert talent challenged again), shoddy editing (insert damage control here); it still managed to be at least a little bit creepy. Even something as awful as ""Cabin Fever"" managed that (although I'm still not sure how).And even the worst of the horror parodies and el-cheapo exploitation efforts contained enough hot babes in sexy situations that there was some reason to watch the screen. This might be the most puzzling element about ""Black Xmas"", simply because it would have been so easy to include it. Why would you make the setting a sorority house and then ignore the opportunity to insert those elements? Good grief the director had both Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the cast; two of the hottest looking actresses in Hollywood. Yet they are only shown in wide master shots with lighting as dim as the scriptwriter's brain activity level. In fact the only genuinely homely actress (Crystal Lowe-whose face looks strangely rearranged and who really should avoid scenes with someone who looks like Trachtenberg)  in the entire cast gets all the well-lighted close-ups (insert the sound of gagging here). And they wonder why these things lose money.I'll also point out a major violation of the principles governing the language of film. I don't know if this was ignorance, stupidity, or accident but an error this basic causes a viewer to have total contempt for the production. The film opens with two murders in the sorority house and yet you see that Billy Lentz (the villain) is still locked up in the hospital. Then we get a flashback to the 1975 conception of Billy's sister. They go out of the flashback with a shot of the baby sister, to a match cut close-up of Eve, the somewhat odd (creepy??) sorority sister (although even in nerd glasses she is yet another actress Lowe should stay away from). In film an edit like this is supposed to communicate (director to viewer) a subtle (but always truthful) clue that Eve is Billy's sister; so later you look back and see that the clue was there to see that Eve had committed the murders that occurred prior to Billy's escape.  It would have been a terrific cut and at the time it really raised my expectations the film would be working on multiple levels. Unfortunately Eve is killed almost immediately after, which tends to support the theory that the edit occurred entirely by accident.Speaking of editing, one thing that made the original so effective was the subtle juxtapositions of violence and gore with gently twinkling Christmas lights, songs, traditions, and a feeling or warmth. The remake attempts to capture this same thing but the images are so contrived (both the violence and the decorations) that you never buy into either and even if these had been well edited (they were not) it could not save the day.As bogus as the production is, the most glaring scenes are those that might be considered under the classification of drama. The romance and the sudden appearance of an older sister come to mind as some of the worst acted sequences you are likely to find in any mainstream production. And of course the completely unnecessary insertion of an older actress only takes away from the screen time of the already underutilized ""attractive"" actresses. What was that about wondering why these things lose money?Toward the end the story has to throw out any remaining credibility and ask that you suspend all disbelief and believe that the extremely low-budget storm outside has caused cross-town rescuers a two-hour delay when the characters have been coming and going without incident up until that moment.Then again, what do I know?

1047105,A2JG7P54DEUOB5,B000MM0LIM,Patrick T. Grady,"[5, 6]","The original ""Black Christmas"" is considered a cult classic, but unlike other horror cult classics that have been subject to Hollywood's remake craze (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Halloween""), it's not known outside of horror circles.  Few have seen the original, but then again, as this was a box-office bust, few have seen the remake, either.  In the original, an unknown and unseen psychopath breaks into a sorority house at Christmas break, hides in the attic, makes some of the lewdest, most demented obscene phone calls ever, and picks the house's occupants off one by one.  It's only at the end that the ""Final Girl"" realizes that something is wrong.The remake takes a different approach.  The killers (there are 2 in this movie) are known immediately.  The sorority sisters realize something is wrong right away.  The audience is treated to a whole back story on the house and killers' connection to it.  The problem is that most of this barely works, if it works at all.  Admittedly, the killers are a bit creepy, but the whole back story is completely ludacris and non-sensical.  Actually, I think if they had written that better and did away with the dumbest parts (the incest element is the worst part; a mother completely despises her son's very existence, and yet has sex with him? oh please...) the film could have been much better.  The obscene calls are treated as an after-thought and aren't very disturbing at all.  The sorority sisters are faceless.  Honestly, I couldn't even keep their names straight.  Katie Cassidy emerges as the film's heroine only because she's the last one left.  Early on, there is nothing that stands out about her, unlike Olivia Hussey's character in the original.  Crystal Lowe, the sorority's drunken cynic, sounds unconvincing as she rattles off reasons why Christmas is a farce.  The other girls range from bland to utterly forgettable.  Also, anyone expecting a movie about sorority sisters to contain a lot of T&A; will also be disappointed.  In short, the viewer will not be emotionally invested in any of the characters.  To the contrary, you might be cheering on their deaths.So what's to like?  Well, remember that this is a slasher flick.  The basic point of slasher films is to feed victims to a killer.  And the movie accomplishes that fairly well.  There's a lot of violence, which is what fans of these types of movie really want, so maybe they overlook most of the film's flaws.  Think about it, are the ""Friday the 13th"" movies that much more well-made?  I don't think so, but people love them (myself included).  So, if you are looking for a cheesy dumb horror flick to rent one weekend, this might be one you enjoy.",3,Christmas in Black,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,2723,"['original', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'considered', 'cult', 'classic', 'other', 'horror', 'cult', 'classics', 'have', 'been', 'subject', 'Hollywood', 'remake', 'craze', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Halloween', 'not', 'known', 'horror', 'circles', 'Few', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'box-office', 'bust', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'remake', 'original', 'unknown', 'unseen', 'psychopath', 'breaks', 'sorority', 'house', 'Christmas', 'break', 'hides', 'attic', 'lewdest', 'most', 'demented', 'obscene', 'phone', 'ever', 'house', 'occupants', 'one', 'one', 'only', 'end', 'Final', 'Girl', 'something', 'wrong.The', 'remake', 'different', 'approach', 'killers', 'are', '2', 'movie', 'are', 'known', 'immediately', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'realize', 'something', 'wrong', 'right', 'away', 'audience', 'treated', 'whole', 'back', 'story', 'house', 'killers', 'connection', 'problem', 'most', 'barely', 'Admittedly', 'killers', 'are', 'bit', 'creepy', 'whole', 'back', 'story', 'completely', 'ludacris', 'non-sensical', 'Actually', 'think', 'had', 'written', 'better', 'did', 'away', 'dumbest', 'parts', 'incest', 'element', 'worst', 'part', 'mother', 'completely', 'son', 'very', 'existence', 'yet', 'sex', 'oh', 'please', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'obscene', 'calls', 'are', 'treated', 'after-thought', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'disturbing', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'are', 'faceless', 'Honestly', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'keep', 'names', 'straight', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'film', 'heroine', 'only', 'last', 'one', 'left', 'Early', 'nothing', 'out', 'Olivia', 'Hussey', 'character', 'original', 'Crystal', 'Lowe', 'sorority', 'drunken', 'cynic', 'unconvincing', 'reasons', 'why', 'Christmas', 'farce', 'other', 'girls', 'range', 'bland', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'Also', 'anyone', 'expecting', 'movie', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'contain', 'lot', 'T', 'A', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'disappointed', 'short', 'viewer', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'characters', 'contrary', 'might', 'be', 'cheering', 'deaths.So', 'what', 'like', 'Well', 'remember', 'slasher', 'flick', 'basic', 'point', 'slasher', 'films', 'feed', 'victims', 'killer', 'movie', 'fairly', 'well', 'lot', 'violence', 'what', 'fans', 'types', 'movie', 'really', 'want', 'so', 'maybe', 'overlook', 'most', 'film', 'flaws', 'Think', 'are', 'Friday', '13th', 'movies', 'much', 'more', 'well-made', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'people', 'love', 'included', 'So', 'are', 'looking', 'cheesy', 'dumb', 'horror', 'flick', 'rent', 'one', 'weekend', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'enjoy']",N/A
1047106,A3500UVGFOC9PA,B000MM0LIM,Paulmeister,"[2, 4]","This movie had me cringing, and not from suspense, or fear, but from the awful production. Everything is so bad. The screenplay is terrible. The Editing is terrible. The dialogue is atrocious, and the director must be the worst one out there. This isn't even bad in an entertaining sense, it's just dreadfully dull and disjointed. You're going to the past to the present to the past. None of the sorority girls has any personality. The prank calls are lame. There's more killing and violence, but it's extremely distasteful. If I met the director of this on the street I would laugh in his face. There isn't even a plot. If I could give this minus 5 stars I would. I used to think that 29 Palms was the worst movie ever made. How can you have the blueprint of the best movie of it's kind ever made and still manage to **** it up so bad. They just needed to copy scene for scene and they would have had a decent remake, but now, the director wanted to get creative. If you can call what this is creative??? There's no atmosphere, but what's worse is none of the characters are appealing or even charming -- nothing to make you care about anyone or anything. There's plenty of scenes that are in extremely poor taste, however. It's like taking a turd sandwich and smothering it in diarrhea. For me, the experience is particularly bad since I've just come off the high of discovering the original (I'm in love with the original) and wanted to see how this compared. It's worse than I could ever have imagined. Part of the reason I'm writing this review is to spare myself from having to watch any more of the rest of the film than necessary. Stay away.

It's awesome that he made Christmas cookies out of her skin. I also love the scenes at the asylum where Billy is kept in present day, but escapes and goes back home.

And while it may lose me all sorts of street cred, I have to say that I adore Hooper's movie almost as much as King's novel, though for entirely different reasons; while I don't like Glen Morgan's remake better than Bob Clark's original, I can appreciate it for entirely different reasons and still say ""it's not a completely awful movie"".The two have in common a sorority house at the brink of Christmas break, a crazed killer, and an opening scene. From there, throw away the original movie (well, don't-- watch it, because it's a barrel of fun) and you'll probably like this one a lot better. All of Clark's original ambiguity-- about which slasher film fans will still argue at the drop of a hat-- is gone, but the solution to it that Morgan and co. came up with is so entirely different than any possibility in the original film that it kinda works. The script is just ghastly, though. I'm not one to complain about profanity most of the time (note glowing Inland Empire review elsewhere in this issue), but the script here was either heavily improvised by its stars or was written by a twelve-year-old who thinks such language is an acceptable stand-in for humor. There gets to be a point where it's just plain stupid, and Black Christmas hits that point roughly ten minutes in.The killer's buffet is stocked with the usual array of young-and-beautifuls (including the delectable Lacey Chabert, for whom I'd have watched this even if it were the worst movie I'd ever seen; I'd watch Lacey Chabert read the phone book for ninety minutes, given the chance), and as with most horror films of this stripe, you recognize a number of them from bad teen-oriented TV shows. None of them is a terribly great actress, though SCTV alum Andrea Martin does have a few fun turns as the house mother. And (if you're watching the unrated cut) you can't beat the gore; Morgan out-Roths Eli and out-Miikes Takashi in some places.Looked at from that angle, it's just your typical slasher film all dolled up for the new millennium. But you can't watch this movie and not compare it to the original-- which, laden with interesting and well-developed characters, excellent comic timing, the infamous ambiguous ending, and a passel of real honest-to-Pete stars-- was anything but a typical slasher film. That's what made the 1974 Black Christmas a cult classic, and why it remains such to this day. Glen Morgan's remake, in comparison, is entirely empty calories, but like most empty calories, they're at least momentarily satisfying. ** ",3,"Not great, but not as awful as it might have been.",1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2779,"['Black', 'Christmas', 'Glen', 'Morgan', '2006', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'one', 'remakes', 'perhaps', 'better', 'looked', 'entirely', 'different', 'adaptation', 'Bob', 'Clark', '1974', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', ""'Salem"", 'Lot', 'resembles', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'may', 'lose', 'sorts', 'street', 'cred', 'have', 'say', 'adore', 'Hooper', 'movie', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'King', 'novel', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'remake', 'better', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'original', 'can', 'appreciate', 'entirely', 'different', 'reasons', 'still', 'say', 'not', 'completely', 'awful', 'movie', '.The', 'two', 'have', 'common', 'sorority', 'house', 'brink', 'Christmas', 'break', 'crazed', 'killer', 'opening', 'scene', 'there', 'throw', 'away', 'original', 'movie', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'barrel', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'lot', 'better', 'Clark', 'original', 'ambiguity', 'slasher', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'argue', 'drop', 'gone', 'solution', 'Morgan', 'co.', 'came', 'up', 'so', 'entirely', 'different', 'possibility', 'original', 'film', 'kinda', 'works', 'script', 'just', 'ghastly', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'complain', 'profanity', 'most', 'time', 'note', 'glowing', 'Inland', 'Empire', 'review', 'elsewhere', 'issue', 'script', 'here', 'was', 'heavily', 'improvised', 'stars', 'was', 'written', 'twelve-year-old', 'who', 'such', 'language', 'acceptable', 'stand-in', 'humor', 'be', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'point', 'roughly', 'ten', 'minutes', 'in.The', 'killer', 'buffet', 'stocked', 'usual', 'array', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'including', 'delectable', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'whom', ""'d"", 'have', 'watched', 'even', 'were', 'worst', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'given', 'chance', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'stripe', 'recognize', 'number', 'bad', 'teen-oriented', 'TV', 'shows', 'None', 'terribly', 'great', 'actress', 'SCTV', 'alum', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'have', 'few', 'fun', 'house', 'mother', ""'re"", 'watching', 'unrated', 'cut', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'gore', 'Morgan', 'out-Roths', 'Eli', 'out-Miikes', 'Takashi', 'places.Looked', 'angle', 'just', 'typical', 'slasher', 'film', 'dolled', 'up', 'new', 'millennium', 'ca', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'compare', 'original', 'interesting', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'excellent', 'comic', 'timing', 'infamous', 'ambiguous', 'ending', 'passel', 'real', 'honest-to-Pete', 'stars', 'was', 'anything', 'typical', 'slasher', 'film', 'what', 'made', '1974', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'cult', 'classic', 'why', 'such', 'day', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'remake', 'comparison', 'entirely', 'empty', 'calories', 'most', 'empty', 'calories', ""'re"", 'least', 'momentarily', 'satisfying', '**']",N/A

1047117,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000MM0LIM,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 4]","The remake of ""Black Christmas"" has got to be among the most consistently underappreciated slasher movies ever made, maybe among the most consistently underaappreciated of all movies.  Managing to hit both the bases of being both 'disturbing and tremendously creepy' and 'fun and sexy with dashes of humor', ""Black Christmas"" takes horror slasher backwards in that it's non-supernatural, with a potent but not apparantly-indestructible villain.  It's a route not a lot of its recent peers have taken, with most of the pack trying (and sometimes even succeeding) to follow the path of series like ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Friday The 13th"", which have utilized virtually unstoppable, inhuman, central figures, and often a large dose of additional otherworldly elements, in being great.  (Well, not Every chapter was great, but an awful lot of them were...)With a simple premise that starts to twist and branch out some in the second half, the movie features a group of sorority sisters and their chaperone stormstayed in their campus dormhouse during the Christmas holidays.  The same building that was once the site of a massacre where Billy Lentz killed his abusive mother and stepfather, and maimed his defenceless little sister.  Billy is, at the film's beginning, now locked up in a psych ward, but it probably would have been harder to make this into a great horror movie had he Stayed securely locked up in a place of mental healing...Fans will know a lot of what comes next.  Actually, a lot of it would have been harder to predict had there not been spoilers as to the movie's third act all over the place before it even got released.  For those who fortunately haven't heard, I won't spoil the twists by revealing them here, but focus on some general observations.  First off, even if you've seen a thousand horror movies, this one can be jarring.  The violence is swift and gruesome, and often hits characters you really want to make it out unscathed.  All the horror violence, all the creepy going-ons, and all the disturbing thematic elements (including the origins of Billy and his sister), taking place amidst the gently twinkling Christmas lights, the classic holiday songs on the radio, and a generally pleasant setting, makes for a really twisted and freaky feel to things.  I liked the cast of characters they put together for this (the female contingent, incidentally, being played by perhaps the best-looking ensemble of actresses ever to appear in a single movie, including mega-hottie Mary Elizabeth Winstead from ""Final Destination 3"" and ""The Ring Two"").  I liked the angle with the woman who came looking for her estranged younger sister and a scheduled Christmas reunion, and the bond that developed between her and the girl at the dorm who's never had siblings.  I liked, loved actually, almost the whole thing...except for some glaring details that stand out and keep ""Black Christmas"" from getting the five-star rating that I really want to give it.First of all, there's a major problem with the snow.  In several shots it doesn't even look real, which juts out like a sore thumb when compared to the overall high production values you're seeing it against.  And the storm is supposed to be this big whopper that's snowed everything in, that's knocking down big trees across the roads so vehicles can't get around, etc.  Yet when you see outside the windows a couple of times, and even in a couple of the outdoor scenes, all you've got is a nice hearty downfall of snow, but not the blizzard of the century.  These lapses should have hurt the movie more than they did (would it really have been that hard to add in a nice, howling wind to the outdoor scenes?) but overall it's so good it earns a few moments where you have to suspend disbelief.  Also, during the flashback scenes, although they were very freaky, a case could be made that portions of the earlier flashbacks came off slightly campy.  It doesn't feel right to be spending so much time, though, on the few flaws when as a complete package you've got one of the finest movies of 2006.  This is ten times as good as its reputation makes it out to be, and among the best recent picks for horror fans.  Four-and-a-half stars with regret that it couldn't be more; and highly recommended.

1047121,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B000MM0LIM,The Piper at the Gates,"[1, 1]","Let me first start off by saying I have NOT seen the orginal version of this film. I knew this film was a remake and I had heard of the 1974 Black Christmas and knew what it about, and bought this movie without even seeing it first. So this review isn't going to compare it with the original, but I'm reviewing just by what this movie had to offer, which I must say, wasn't much! First off, the whole basic backstory of the killer is dumb. I won't go into detail, I'll let other reviewers tackle that, but it is quite stupid, even for a horror film. Not only is the backstory dumb, but its broken up into the film as a series of flashbacks, that just slow what pace the movie had, down to a crawl. Next, all the characters are forgettable and unimportant. I watched the film no more than an hour or so ago, and I couldn't give you no more than 2 character names in the film. I just found myself not caring who lived, who died, whatever. Quite frankly, I was kinda bored. Now, on to the death scenes, some were ok, while others were infact, lame. Getting stabbed in the neck with a candycane? Uh, ok. A falling icicle that falls and goes through someone's head? What was the icicle made out of, steel? And, sorry to spoil it for ya if you havent seen the movie, but the ending death scene of Billy in the hospital when he falls on a big Christmas tree and the star on the tree impales him, AND without the tree falling?!! What the hell? Was the star made of Ginsu knives and the tree planted in cement? Hey, I know, its a slasher horror film. Its gonna have some dumb stuff happen. There's gonna be bad acting, there's gonna be a bad plot. But my point is that this was a remake. So unless the orginal was this bad, which I highly doubt, this movie should have been way better. Which brings me to my next point..when will Hollywood learn to write some ORIGINAL stuff, rather than just remaking every movie known to man, which don't even need being remade in the first place.

I heard that they turned the remake into an average teeny bopper slasher flick as opposed to the creepy pyschological horror of the original. What was left out was that in the original there was a extended closeup shot of the girl suffocated in the bag. In the original, the plastic bag was see through or clear so you saw the dead face of the victim. In the remake, we get a brown/black plastic bag so the concept of the plastic bag wasn't creepy or scary. Also, the original was creepy because there was more of the threatening calls as opposed to the remake. In addition, we never saw the face or we never really knew who the killer was so it was more creepy and scary. In the original, the boyfriend of the main female actress was probably a suspect but he was killed by the girlfriend because she thought  her boyfriend was the killer. But that wasn't so. In this stupid remake, they gave to much backstory of the killer and we saw too much of the killer so it wasn't creepy/scary at all. Plus, the death scenes in this remake are stupid amd unrealistic.

1047123,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000MM0LIM,trebe,"[0, 0]","The original Black Christmas (1974) was a minor hit, particularly in Canada, where the film was made.  Unfortunately for those involved, it would not be until four years later that another holiday based horror movie, John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), would launch the slasher genre.The remake of the original cult classic is Black X-mas (2006), a stylish slasher that retains some of the basic elements from the original, while putting a few more macabre twists in the tale.  The film has a high body count, with some trademark kills featuring plastic bags, and a number of nasty eye gougings, as Billy Edward Lenz (Robert Mann) escapes from a mental institution on Christmas Eve, to return home for the holidays.Lenz's former home, is now a sorority house, with Michelle Trachtenberg, Lacey Chabert, Katie Cassidy (daughter of David Cassidy), Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Crystal Lowe, playing some of the sorority sisters living there.  Andrea Martin, who also appeared in the 1974 film, is featured as Ms. Mac, the house mother.  Kristen Cloke plays Leigh Colvin, the sister of a sorority member killed at the opening of the film, and Oliver Hudson is Kyle, a scummy guy dating several of the ladies.Years ago when he was a small boy, Billy Lenz witnessed his mother and her lover murder his father.  Billy was then kept a prisoner in the attic for years, where he eventually fathered a child named Agnes, with his own mother.  After gouging out one of his sister's eyes, and killing his mother and her lover, Billy locked up in an institution, until one Christmas Eve, when he murders an attendant, and a guy in a Santa Claus suit, and makes his escape.Back at the sorority, the residents receive cryptic phone calls, and soon begin to fall prey to a killer, but with the dead bodies dragged up to the attic, it takes a while before the residents realize that their friends have been murdered.  The kills are a bit messy, as the horn of a glass unicorn, often ends up jammed into an eye socket.  The ladies call for assistance, but because of the snow, help won't arrive for some time.  The discovery of a decapitated head, leads some in the group to make an unsuccessful attempt to get help.  The killings shifts into high gear, as the remaining survivors venture into the attic, where they discover just who and what, they are up against.  Just two women manage to escape from the house alive, but the Christmas fun is not quite over yet.Glen Morgan (Final Destination, Willard) wrote the screenplay and also directs.  His long time collaborator James Wong (The X-Files, Millenium, Space: Above and Beyond), serves as one of the co-producers.  Morgan's update of this classic slasher, is a slick treatment that incorporates edgy quick strike violence, and doesn't linger on the gore.  This works well within the story structure, where the mayhem is widespread, and you don't really get to know most of the characters well.  Overall the acting is pretty good, with newcomer to horror films, the long-armed Katie Cassidy, delivering a strong performance.The DVD lacks a commentary track, but the 28 minute featurette, What Have You Done: The Remaking Of Black Christmas provides a nice overview of the production.  The 26 minute featurette, May All Your Christmases Be Black: A Filmmakers Journey, is solid piece that focuses on director Glen Morgan, and his approach to making the film.As with other recent remakes of classic 70's horror films, like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, and I Spit On Your Grave, there may not be too much to be gained by comparing films from different eras.  The current thirst for gore and violence is so high, that filmmakers go to extremes to truly shock.  Morgan is guilty of this to some extent, as the eye gouging is way overdone, and the eating of eyeballs is an unnecessary excess.  Black X-Mas isn't a classic, but it is a competently executed and stylish film that probably contains enough eye-popping violence to satisfy most slasher fans.",3,a reboot of the original yuletide slasher...,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,4003,"['original', 'Black', 'Christmas', '1974', 'was', 'minor', 'hit', 'particularly', 'Canada', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Unfortunately', 'involved', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'four', 'years', 'later', 'holiday', 'based', 'horror', 'movie', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Halloween', '1978', 'would', 'launch', 'slasher', 'genre.The', 'remake', 'original', 'cult', 'classic', 'Black', 'X-mas', '2006', 'stylish', 'slasher', 'basic', 'elements', 'original', 'putting', 'few', 'more', 'macabre', 'twists', 'tale', 'film', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'trademark', 'kills', 'featuring', 'plastic', 'bags', 'number', 'nasty', 'eye', 'gougings', 'Billy', 'Edward', 'Lenz', 'Robert', 'Mann', 'mental', 'institution', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'return', 'home', 'holidays.Lenz', 'former', 'home', 'now', 'sorority', 'house', 'Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'Lacey', 'Chabert', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'daughter', 'David', 'Cassidy', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Winstead', 'Crystal', 'Lowe', 'playing', 'sorority', 'living', 'there', 'Andrea', 'Martin', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', '1974', 'film', 'featured', 'Ms.', 'Mac', 'house', 'mother', 'Kristen', 'Cloke', 'Leigh', 'Colvin', 'sister', 'sorority', 'member', 'killed', 'opening', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Hudson', 'Kyle', 'scummy', 'guy', 'dating', 'several', 'ladies.Years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'boy', 'Billy', 'Lenz', 'witnessed', 'mother', 'lover', 'murder', 'father', 'Billy', 'was', 'then', 'kept', 'prisoner', 'attic', 'years', 'where', 'eventually', 'fathered', 'child', 'named', 'Agnes', 'own', 'mother', 'gouging', 'out', 'one', 'sister', 'eyes', 'killing', 'mother', 'lover', 'Billy', 'locked', 'up', 'institution', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'when', 'attendant', 'guy', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'suit', 'escape.Back', 'sorority', 'residents', 'receive', 'cryptic', 'phone', 'calls', 'soon', 'begin', 'fall', 'prey', 'killer', 'dead', 'bodies', 'dragged', 'up', 'attic', 'while', 'residents', 'realize', 'friends', 'have', 'been', 'murdered', 'kills', 'are', 'bit', 'messy', 'horn', 'glass', 'unicorn', 'often', 'up', 'jammed', 'eye', 'socket', 'ladies', 'call', 'assistance', 'snow', 'help', 'wo', ""n't"", 'arrive', 'time', 'discovery', 'decapitated', 'head', 'group', 'make', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'get', 'help', 'killings', 'shifts', 'high', 'gear', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'venture', 'attic', 'where', 'discover', 'just', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'up', 'Just', 'two', 'women', 'manage', 'escape', 'house', 'alive', 'Christmas', 'fun', 'not', 'quite', 'yet.Glen', 'Morgan', 'Final', 'Destination', 'Willard', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'also', 'directs', 'long', 'time', 'collaborator', 'James', 'Wong', 'X-Files', 'Millenium', 'Space', 'Above', 'Beyond', 'one', 'co-producers', 'Morgan', 'update', 'classic', 'slasher', 'slick', 'treatment', 'edgy', 'quick', 'strike', 'violence', ""n't"", 'linger', 'gore', 'well', 'story', 'structure', 'where', 'mayhem', 'widespread', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'know', 'most', 'characters', 'well', 'Overall', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'newcomer', 'horror', 'films', 'long-armed', 'Katie', 'Cassidy', 'delivering', 'strong', 'performance.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', '28', 'minute', 'featurette', 'What', 'Have', 'Done', 'Remaking', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'nice', 'overview', 'production', '26', 'minute', 'featurette', 'May', 'All', 'Christmases', 'Be', 'Black', 'Filmmakers', 'Journey', 'solid', 'piece', 'director', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'approach', 'making', 'film.As', 'other', 'recent', 'remakes', 'classic', '70', 'horror', 'films', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'be', 'gained', 'comparing', 'films', 'different', 'eras', 'current', 'thirst', 'gore', 'violence', 'so', 'high', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'extremes', 'truly', 'shock', 'Morgan', 'guilty', 'extent', 'eye', 'gouging', 'way', 'overdone', 'eating', 'eyeballs', 'unnecessary', 'excess', 'Black', 'X-Mas', ""n't"", 'classic', 'competently', 'executed', 'stylish', 'film', 'probably', 'enough', 'eye-popping', 'violence', 'satisfy', 'most', 'slasher', 'fans']",N/A

1047125,A2HC5RRZ399BSD,B000MM0LIM,Tyler,"[2, 3]","The original Black Christmas is probably my favorite horror movie. It's a masterpiece of suspense. Unfortunately, this remake has absolutely nothing in common. It fails in just about every way possible. The amateur writing, first and foremost, is atrocious. It's the kind of script that reeks of being written in a day or two and without much effort. The dialogue is completely out of touch with modern college kids, there are contradictory statements left and right, the jokes fall flat, and every character is much more stupid than usual....even for a horror movie.In some ways, this might be closer to what Black Christmas would have been like, were it made in the 80s', full of excessive violence and camp. That could seem like a lot of fun, but it more replicates the BAD horror movies of the 80s'. For a movie with this kind of budget, there is really no excuse for the lack of effort that went into this. The performaces lack as well, mostly because of the poor writing. There is no character development, and for the most part, you can't even remember their names. It's hard to care at all about these people. There is no suspense, everything is either predicable or so rediculously over the top, you cant help but roll your eyes. There is a bit of backstory on ""billy"" for fans of the original, but it comes off as unnecessary, and just filler for a lack of better ideas. There is nothing scary about this movie whatsoever, which is inexcusable, given they had 30 years of planning and such a wonderful original source material to work with. I enjoy holiday themed horror movies, so i can't totally trash it. I cant say that ""it's so bad, it's good"" because really, well, it's just bad. However, I tend to be a horror fan that can find entertainment in a lot of movies that others can't. In a way, this is one of them. I'd give it a viewing at Christmastime to counter all of the annoying holiday cheer, but that's about it. It's sad that the best horror movie to be remade, ended up with the very worst remake, even after another 7 years of endless repeated ideas. The 2006 Black Christmas should be used for ever as the archetypal example of why some movies should remain untouched, or at least put into the hands of competent people.

Freeman ""Zach""","[0, 0]","First of all, it's hard not to compare a remake to its original, but for all intensive purposes, it's just not fair when you're talking about a genre-starter like Black Christmas. Whether or not the movie should have been remade at all is another question, but we'll ignore that too.This reimagined Black Christmas is a bit lackluster, despite the glossy look and feel of the entire film. The flashing red and green Christmas lights that make up much of the lighting effects feel a bit garish sometimes and the whole film just has a bit too much polish for a genuinely frightening horror film. It does pay homage to the original in a few interesting ways, such as the glass unicorn as a murder weapon and the plastic bags blowing in the closet at the beginning.What Black Christmas uses in place of suspenseful terror is generous amounts of gore... eyeball gore for the most part. Throughout the film eyeballs are being popped, pulled out, eaten, and just generally mutilated in a gory attack on both the victims and the viewer's ability to witness.The new Black Christmas does throw in a good amount of back story on Billy Lenz, although he's given an almost mythical representation, with his jaundiced skin tone and blood red eyes, he's more like a demon than a disturbed psychotic. The addition of his sister/daughter Agnes is creative and interesting, but doesn't end up playing out as nicely as it could have. And the general idea that Billy kills because he believes ""that's how you show love"" is just absurd and really detracts from the plot. He might as well just be a psycho killer, that's more entertaining.Okay, I can't help but reference the original. All the suspense and horror in the first movie is based on the fact that the audience doesn't know who the killer is, and that none of the sorority sisters actually know that the other ones have died until it's too late. It all plays out very realistically as they wait for the police to assist them.In an era of cell phones, the new version substitutes a snow storm, downed power lines, and sisterly devotion to account for the girls staying in the house instead of escaping from the killer. It all feels pretty stale, as does the acting by all of the leads. They do the best they can with typical sorority girl lines, but there's not much life to be breathed here.Ultimately Black Christmas is disappointing, but no more disappointing than most other horror remakes that have been coming out recently. In fact, it's a bit better than some others, but not much. These are the horror movies that are threatening to make the horror genre fade into the background for a while as it did in the late 90s.The DVD contains several deleted scenes, and like most deleted scenes, you can tell they were deleted for a reason. There are 3 alternate endings, all a little less interesting than the real one. There are also two featurettes: one about the remaking of the film, one about the making of this film. They're both very interesting and help show that director Glen Morgan is sincere in his admiration for the original Black Christmas and didn't intend to copy or degrade it with his remake. If nothing else, hopefully he'll inspire more people to see the original.",2,"On its own, it stands among contemporary horror schlock, compared to the original... it dies",1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,3225,"['First', 'all', 'hard', 'not', 'compare', 'remake', 'original', 'intensive', 'purposes', 'just', 'not', 'fair', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'genre-starter', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Whether', 'not', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'remade', 'question', ""'ll"", 'ignore', 'too.This', 'reimagined', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'bit', 'lackluster', 'glossy', 'look', 'feel', 'entire', 'film', 'flashing', 'red', 'green', 'Christmas', 'lights', 'make', 'up', 'much', 'lighting', 'effects', 'feel', 'bit', 'garish', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'polish', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'horror', 'film', 'pay', 'homage', 'original', 'few', 'interesting', 'ways', 'such', 'glass', 'unicorn', 'murder', 'weapon', 'plastic', 'bags', 'blowing', 'closet', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'place', 'suspenseful', 'terror', 'generous', 'amounts', 'gore', 'eyeball', 'gore', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'eyeballs', 'are', 'being', 'popped', 'pulled', 'out', 'eaten', 'just', 'generally', 'mutilated', 'gory', 'attack', 'victims', 'viewer', 'ability', 'witness.The', 'new', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'throw', 'good', 'amount', 'back', 'story', 'Billy', 'Lenz', 'given', 'almost', 'mythical', 'representation', 'jaundiced', 'skin', 'tone', 'blood', 'red', 'eyes', 'more', 'demon', 'disturbed', 'psychotic', 'addition', 'sister/daughter', 'Agnes', 'creative', 'interesting', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'playing', 'out', 'as', 'nicely', 'could', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'Billy', 'how', 'show', 'love', 'just', 'absurd', 'really', 'detracts', 'plot', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'be', 'psycho', 'killer', 'more', 'entertaining.Okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'reference', 'original', 'suspense', 'horror', 'first', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'audience', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'killer', 'none', 'sorority', 'sisters', 'actually', 'know', 'other', 'ones', 'have', 'died', 'too', 'late', 'out', 'very', 'realistically', 'wait', 'police', 'assist', 'era', 'cell', 'phones', 'new', 'version', 'snow', 'storm', 'downed', 'power', 'lines', 'sisterly', 'devotion', 'account', 'girls', 'staying', 'house', 'instead', 'escaping', 'killer', 'feels', 'pretty', 'stale', 'acting', 'leads', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'typical', 'sorority', 'girl', 'lines', 'not', 'much', 'life', 'be', 'breathed', 'here.Ultimately', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'disappointing', 'more', 'disappointing', 'most', 'other', 'horror', 'remakes', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'out', 'recently', 'fact', 'bit', 'better', 'others', 'not', 'much', 'are', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'threatening', 'make', 'horror', 'genre', 'fade', 'background', 'while', 'did', 'late', '90s.The', 'DVD', 'contains', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'most', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'deleted', 'reason', 'are', '3', 'alternate', 'endings', 'little', 'less', 'interesting', 'real', 'one', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'featurettes', 'one', 'remaking', 'film', 'one', 'making', 'film', ""'re"", 'very', 'interesting', 'help', 'show', 'director', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'sincere', 'admiration', 'original', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'copy', 'degrade', 'remake', 'nothing', 'else', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'inspire', 'more', 'people', 'see', 'original']",N/A

Is there action?  Yes.  Are the actors good?  Yes.  Does the movie do a good job at portraying the cheery and eerie holiday feeling?  Yes.  I certainly enjoyed it.  It didn't take FOREVER to get into things and show some gore.  The movie was well done, and the bodies pile up quickly like they should in a slasher movie.  It's worth it to add this movie to your collection if you're a true slasher movie fan. I enjoy holiday based movies and gore, so this was the best of both worlds for me.",4,Holiday Horror,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,635,"[""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'compare', 'original', 'remake', 'want', 'go', 'explain', 'why', 'think', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'there', 'gore', 'Yes', 'action', 'Yes', 'Are', 'actors', 'good', 'Yes', 'movie', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'cheery', 'eerie', 'holiday', 'feeling', 'Yes', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'FOREVER', 'get', 'things', 'show', 'gore', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'bodies', 'pile', 'up', 'quickly', 'should', 'slasher', 'movie', 'worth', 'add', 'movie', 'collection', ""'re"", 'true', 'slasher', 'movie', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'holiday', 'based', 'movies', 'gore', 'was', 'best', 'worlds']",N/A
