The music is great and original, and Elvis is playing a surly, rebellious young man with attitude, and he gives a great performance.  I have recently read a couple of books about James Dean, and have watched a program in the past year where Frank Mazzola (""Rebel without a Cause"" cast member) said when Elvis hit it big and went out to Hollywood he asked Mazzola all about Dean, knew all the dialogue from ""Rebel"" etc.  Watching Elvis in ""Jailhouse Rock"" I couldn't help but think of James Dean and how I bet Elvis loved playing that part since he idolized Dean who had died tragically in a car crash before Elvis became a big star.Elvis was always known for being polite and well-mannered, but he plays a rude, big-headed punk very well in this film.

As Vince Everett, a violent young man imprisoned for man-slaughter, Elvis plays the character with ease, at once tender, surly, arrogant and humble. The film studio's motivation may have been to exploit the rock'n'roll bandwagon for all it was worth (this was 1957 after all - rock was just a &quot;passing fad&quot;) but Elvis rose to a greater challenge - to prove that he could pass muster as a big-screen actor, AND fly the rock'n'roll flag. He succeeded - brilliantly.Even if the direction is a little staid at times, and the storyline was an old one even then, the film brought rock'n'roll squarely into the adult marketplace, where it stayed.Alex Romero's imaginative choreography of the title number(with not a little help from Elvis himself), risque dialogue (&quot;that ain't tactics honey, it's just the beast in me&quot;) and the bleak, anti-social central character (the Hollywood stereotype of youth during the 50s - see &quot;The Wild One&quot; and &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;) combined to create an iconic portrayal of the &quot;Rock Rebel&quot;.&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; remains the template for the cinematic fusion of rock music and drama.",4,Elvis at his best,1072483200,"12 27, 2003",2003,1298,"['Elvis', 'came', 'age', 'dramatic', 'character', 'actor', 'third', 'film', 'utilising', 'innate', 'animalism', 'primary', 'character', 'motivation', 'Vince', 'Everett', 'violent', 'young', 'man', 'imprisoned', 'man-slaughter', 'Elvis', 'character', 'ease', 'once', 'tender', 'surly', 'arrogant', 'humble', 'film', 'studio', 'motivation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'exploit', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'bandwagon', 'was', 'worth', 'was', '1957', 'rock', 'was', 'just', 'quot', 'passing', 'fad', 'quot', 'Elvis', 'rose', 'greater', 'challenge', 'prove', 'could', 'pass', 'muster', 'big-screen', 'actor', 'fly', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'flag', 'succeeded', 'brilliantly.Even', 'direction', 'little', 'staid', 'times', 'storyline', 'was', 'old', 'one', 'even', 'then', 'film', 'brought', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'squarely', 'adult', 'marketplace', 'where', 'stayed.Alex', 'Romero', 'imaginative', 'choreography', 'title', 'number', 'not', 'little', 'help', 'Elvis', 'risque', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'ai', ""n't"", 'tactics', 'honey', 'just', 'beast', 'quot', 'bleak', 'anti-social', 'central', 'character', 'Hollywood', 'stereotype', 'youth', '50s', 'see', 'quot', 'Wild', 'One', 'quot', 'quot', 'Blackboard', 'Jungle', 'quot', 'combined', 'create', 'iconic', 'portrayal', 'quot', 'Rock', 'Rebel', 'quot', 'quot', 'Jailhouse', 'Rock', 'quot', 'template', 'cinematic', 'fusion', 'rock', 'music', 'drama']",N/A
