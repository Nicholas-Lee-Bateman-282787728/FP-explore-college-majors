1586564,A2YLZB00HZTM6B,B00975L5WQ,"R. Myers ""ptinaz""","[0, 2]","Boring. Stopped watching midway through second story. I expected funny since I rented it from the comedy section. And if not funny, some drama or action. Would have helped. But the drama and the acting were weak. I wish people would stop rating these boring movies so highly--this movie and The Station Agent were real duds. And they keep getting these 4-5 star ratings. At least it was free on Amazon Prime. Maybe I was missing something brilliant in the other hour of the movie I skipped.The first story is about the last day of a guy quitting his job. Everyone seems to like him but his boss. They show the leaving party where everyone gets drunk and says stuff they will probably regret tomorrow.",2,Couldn't make it through the second story,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,700,"['Boring', 'Stopped', 'watching', 'midway', 'second', 'story', 'expected', 'funny', 'rented', 'comedy', 'section', 'not', 'funny', 'drama', 'action', 'Would', 'have', 'helped', 'drama', 'acting', 'were', 'weak', 'wish', 'people', 'would', 'stop', 'rating', 'boring', 'movies', 'so', 'highly', 'movie', 'Station', 'Agent', 'were', 'real', 'duds', 'keep', 'getting', '4-5', 'star', 'ratings', 'least', 'was', 'free', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'Maybe', 'was', 'missing', 'something', 'brilliant', 'other', 'hour', 'movie', 'skipped.The', 'first', 'story', 'last', 'day', 'guy', 'quitting', 'job', 'Everyone', 'like', 'boss', 'show', 'leaving', 'party', 'where', 'everyone', 'drunk', 'stuff', 'will', 'probably', 'regret', 'tomorrow']",SOMETHING BETTER SOMEWHER
