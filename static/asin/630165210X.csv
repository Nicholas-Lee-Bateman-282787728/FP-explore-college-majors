Mesa,"[33, 35]","For those who have not seen Siesta it contains an almost similar  plot twist much like Jacob's Ladder with actor Tim Robbins;the premise is pretty  much the same. However, where the images in Ladder were macabre and  sinister, Siesta's borders more on scenic and melancholy imagery;Much of  the story takes place in Spain under sunny skies.Ellen Barkin's character  Claire wakes up in the middle of a strip field/airport in Spain with a bout  of amnesia to find she is soaked in blood.In a sense, she is relieved to  discover that it's not her own blood. Terrified, she begins to suspect she  has killed somebody;but who, why or what is what propels the story. As it  unfolds, Claire encounters both eccentric and unsavory characters  throughout her mysterious journey ( special cameos and roles by Jodie  Foster, Grace Jones, Julian Sands). Do these characters help or hinder her  investigation ?While Siesta was a limited release back in'87 it is very  well written and directed for a cult status film or an art house movie (it  almost takes on a foreign feel at times). This sleeper should not be missed  by those seeking to see movies which are &quot;experimental&quot; or  different. This film certainly did not follow the typical big action, big  bucks formula as many other Hollywood films often do...Another honorable  mention is the hauntingly meleancholy yet beautiful soundtrack by the late  Miles Davis and Marcus Miller;a highly recommended soundtrack !",4,Siesta is No Sleeper,965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,1466,"['who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Siesta', 'almost', 'similar', 'plot', 'twist', 'much', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'actor', 'Tim', 'Robbins', 'premise', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'However', 'where', 'images', 'Ladder', 'were', 'macabre', 'sinister', 'Siesta', 'borders', 'more', 'scenic', 'melancholy', 'imagery', 'Much', 'story', 'place', 'Spain', 'sunny', 'skies.Ellen', 'Barkin', 'character', 'Claire', 'up', 'middle', 'strip', 'field/airport', 'Spain', 'bout', 'amnesia', 'find', 'soaked', 'blood.In', 'sense', 'relieved', 'discover', 'not', 'own', 'blood', 'Terrified', 'suspect', 'killed', 'somebody', 'who', 'why', 'what', 'what', 'story', 'Claire', 'eccentric', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'mysterious', 'journey', 'special', 'cameos', 'roles', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Grace', 'Jones', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Do', 'characters', 'help', 'hinder', 'investigation', 'Siesta', 'was', 'limited', 'release', 'back', ""in'87"", 'very', 'well', 'written', 'directed', 'cult', 'status', 'film', 'art', 'house', 'movie', 'almost', 'foreign', 'feel', 'times', 'sleeper', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'seeking', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'quot', 'experimental', 'quot', 'different', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'typical', 'big', 'action', 'big', 'bucks', 'formula', 'many', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'often', 'do', 'honorable', 'mention', 'hauntingly', 'meleancholy', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'late', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Marcus', 'Miller', 'highly', 'recommended', 'soundtrack']",N/A

Yes, it has a SIMILAR conceit to Jacob's Ladder and Carnival of Souls, duh, but it's treatment of 'death's door' is very different. I read the script, and some curious changes were made by final cut, as in the final words ""How can this be true when I feel so much pain"" has been altered to ""How can this be true when I feel so much love."" Hmmmm. Anyway, there are some remarkable moments in this tale of a 'lost soul,' many of which belong to Jodie Foster embodied as an angel wrapped in eurotrash drag, and Julian Sands, delightful as a satyric guide.  There are some choppy sections, looked like budget probs to me, and Marcus Miller kind of overdoes the synth effects a coupla times, but it's still a cut above most sludge out there... and it has SOMETHING on its mind, thank God.
