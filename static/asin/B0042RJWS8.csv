1383513,AOUAET0EL5LS7,B0042RJWS8,Amazon Customer,"[19, 20]","I watched this show starting when I was a teenager and watched every episode from the very beginning. When I found this on Amazon, it was a must have for me. I'm in the middle of the series now. There are many controversial issues talked about in each episode, some not so appropriate for little ones, but very appropriate for teenagers/pre-teens and other episodes that even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys watching. It's a great family show that I do highly recommend. I can't wait for my kids to be able to watch it with us all over again when they are a little older.",5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,564,"['watched', 'show', 'starting', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'watched', 'episode', 'very', 'beginning', 'When', 'found', 'Amazon', 'was', 'must', 'have', ""'m"", 'middle', 'series', 'now', 'are', 'many', 'controversial', 'issues', 'talked', 'episode', 'not', 'so', 'appropriate', 'little', 'ones', 'very', 'appropriate', 'teenagers/pre-teens', 'other', 'episodes', 'even', '2', '1/2', 'year', 'old', 'watching', 'great', 'family', 'show', 'do', 'highly', 'recommend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'kids', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'when', 'are', 'little', 'older']",N/A
1383514,AZZIY8J0XT5OP,B0042RJWS8,book lover,"[6, 7]","I enjoyed this series so much when it was airing and many of the episodes still are topical and relevant today.  The cast is good, for the most part, although there's a bit too much reliance on gimmick casting (Ashley Simpson/Hayley Duff anyone?) in the later seasons.  It's nice to see a show about a family that genuinely loves each other.  Of course there are fights and conflicts, because no family is perfect, but this shows that it is possible to disagree with one another and still be supportive and loving.  The parents are parents, not their kids' best friends.  The brothers and sisters argue and fight on occasion, and rebel against their parents, but they also love and care for each other.  The big disappointment is that there are no extras with any of the seasons.  No episode commentary, no cast interviews, nothing.  The show deserves better than that and so do the fans.",3,Disappointing box set.

1383516,AD5JI9UN98JPH,B0042RJWS8,christmas lover,"[0, 1]",This is a good show. Unfornenally I had no interest in it until they were into season four. I saw the saesons before that later. I remember being surprised and shocked when Lucy announced that she was going to follow Eric into the ministry. Before that happened Lucy met Keven got married and had a kid. After that last one she had just barely graduated but it happened. Meanwhile the show is about more than just the Camden parents and Lucy. Its about the whole family who occaninally youll wish you were a part of.,5,Revend Eric,1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,516,"['good', 'show', 'Unfornenally', 'had', 'interest', 'were', 'season', 'four', 'saw', 'saesons', 'later', 'remember', 'being', 'surprised', 'shocked', 'when', 'Lucy', 'announced', 'was', 'going', 'follow', 'Eric', 'ministry', 'happened', 'Lucy', 'met', 'Keven', 'got', 'married', 'had', 'kid', 'last', 'one', 'had', 'just', 'barely', 'graduated', 'happened', 'Meanwhile', 'show', 'more', 'just', 'Camden', 'parents', 'Lucy', 'whole', 'family', 'who', 'occaninally', 'youll', 'wish', 'were', 'part']",N/A

So far we are on season 2. I am happy I got the entire set. It`s going to be nice to see how the kids grow up. The 3rd episode on each DVD so far does not want to play when I try to play the episode (it might just be my DVD?).
