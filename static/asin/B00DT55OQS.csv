The preview looked great and made it seem like a &#34;Cabin In The Woods&#34; meets &#34;Close Encounters&#34; (or &#34;Fire In The Sky&#34;). Was movie Creepy? Yes. But it was irritating too. Plot: Someone sends a guy video of his loser drug addict friend going &#34;mental&#34; in the woods and he goes to &#34;rescue&#34; him by trying to take him to rehab. No go. Addict refuses. So friend handcuffs addict to a wall in a shoddy cabin addict is living in. Native Americans arrive claiming house is their property. More loser druggies that addict and friend know from High School come to collect on drug debt and threaten addict and buddy. Dog friend of addict drops by to &#34;work&#34; on book she and addict are &#34;writing&#34; about squirrels (Delusion by addict). Weird photos, old books, film loops, and recordings appear. I didn't care. Strange ending that was to be profound or bizarre or funny(?). I felt relief that something came along and movie ended, putting the two leads out of MY misery! TRUELY a total waste of my time, the efforts of talented actors, and of film.",2,Ho hum movie w/ preview being better than film itself.,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1140,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'film', 'saw', 'much', 'point', 'preview', 'looked', 'great', 'made', 'seem', '34', 'Cabin', 'Woods', '34', 'meets', '34', 'Close', 'Encounters', '34', '34', 'Fire', 'Sky', '34', 'Was', 'movie', 'Creepy', 'Yes', 'was', 'irritating', 'too', 'Plot', 'Someone', 'guy', 'video', 'loser', 'drug', 'addict', 'friend', 'going', '34', 'mental', '34', 'woods', '34', 'rescue', '34', 'trying', 'take', 'rehab', 'go', 'Addict', 'So', 'friend', 'handcuffs', 'addict', 'wall', 'shoddy', 'cabin', 'addict', 'living', 'Native', 'Americans', 'arrive', 'claiming', 'house', 'property', 'More', 'loser', 'druggies', 'addict', 'friend', 'know', 'High', 'School', 'come', 'collect', 'drug', 'debt', 'threaten', 'addict', 'buddy', 'Dog', 'friend', 'addict', 'drops', '34', 'work', '34', 'book', 'addict', 'are', '34', 'writing', '34', 'squirrels', 'Delusion', 'addict', 'Weird', 'photos', 'old', 'books', 'film', 'loops', 'recordings', 'appear', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Strange', 'ending', 'was', 'be', 'profound', 'bizarre', 'funny', 'felt', 'relief', 'something', 'came', 'along', 'movie', 'ended', 'putting', 'two', 'MY', 'misery', 'TRUELY', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'efforts', 'talented', 'actors', 'film']",N/A

But, it wasn't clear what the central theme of the story was suppose to be. Too many improbabilities in terms of the actions taken and not taken by our two main characters; too many not clearly presented backstories on what took place at the site. The old tech and new tech modes of communication just seemed hokey and not believable. The &#34;presence&#34; (or source) whatever it was is still not clear. Consequently there's just a vague fading ending to the film.

I also noticed that it had a great score on Rotten Tomatoes, that is why I decided to check it out. Like many other recent horror/suspense ventures that have recieved great reviews; In Fear, Cheap Thrills, the film ultimately fails to live up to it's premise and ultimatley fails to deliver any suspense, interesting story turns, etc... I am not going to go into the premise of the film, you should have an idead about that by now if you are reading this review, however, I will say save yourself the 80 minutes and go checkout some of the recent Shout factory releases if you want a true horror/suspense film. Also, I tend not to notice language as much in most films, however, I would say that I did in this film, it seems absolutely pointless and out of place. The movie is so boring you may find yourself seeing if you can count how many times the supporting character can say F%^&$%&%^.

1661142,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B00DT55OQS,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[1, 4]","Nine Things About ""Resolution""1. I didn't know much about this film before I watched it, I just knew that it was getting good reviews as an indie thriller.2. This is one of those ""polarizing"" movies that you will either really like or really not like.  I really didn't like it.3. It's about a guy, Mike, that goes to visit Chris, his crack-addicted best friend, who is staying out in the country. Mike handcuffs Chris in his cabin and vows to stay with him for a week until he can get off the crack.4. While they are staying in the house, they are visited by a bunch of random characters that live in the area.  They also start getting even more random clues that some strange being is watching them and filming them. They slowly discover they are in real danger.5. I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Characters float in for a scene and then are never seen again. Instead of being mysterious, the movie is disconnected and nonsensical.6. The directors admit that they have no direct experience with crack addiction or withdrawal. They just Googled it. This is extremely obvious. Chris the crack addict doesn't really seem to be very uncomfortable in his withdrawal. It's the worst portrayal of a drug addict I've ever seen. He is really just the comic relief in the film.7. The crack withdrawal plot really has nothing to do with the real story. The directors added it to the script to give it ""structure"". Which means they needed to make it longer. This is a decent 30-minute film that was artificially stretched to last 90 minutes, so the whole point of the movie drowns in it's own ""mysteriousness"".8. In what should have been the most suspenseful scene towards the end, the two guys suddenly take a break to discuss their friendship and how awesome each other is.9. The ending is one of the dumbest and most frustrating endings in recent memory.",1,Nice try.
