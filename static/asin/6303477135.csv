If you read the history of YOUNG you will notice a BIG difference between HESTON and the movie. He is no where near the REAL IRON FISTED LEADER OF THE L.D.S. CHURCH.

377088,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,6303477135,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[10, 15]","A movie trailer for THE AVENGING ANGEL claims that what the viewer will see is the ""true"" story of the Avenging Angel, in this case played by Tom Berenger. Let's face it folks, if this is a ""true"" story from the American West based on historical facts then we need to all go searching for the grave sites of Shane, Conagher and J.B. Books!True? Not nearly! Or as Brigham Young, himself, would have said, ""As false as the hinges of Hell!"" There was no Elder Rigby. Even if this character is supposedly based on Sidney Rigdon the story falls considerably short. Rigdon was nowhere near Utah at any time in his life having left the Church even before its historic days in Nauvoo, Illinois.So, let's see. No Brother Parker, either. No Brother Pike. No gun-packing scorned former wife of Brigham Young coming back from the East with assassins in tow. No Alpheus Young, the fabricated son of the fabricated  gun-slinging ex-wife, with murderous intentions against a loving though supposedly negligent father. No Amanda Young. And, despite what some might claim, no Brother Utley either.But wait, as a western I loved it. Yes, I give it five stars for entertainment value. Berenger is fabulous as the gunfighting avenger who's faster than the devil himself and Charlton Heston portrays Brother Brigham wonderfully. James Coburn brings a smile in his portrayal of Porter Rockwell, the historical Mormon ""outlaw"" who is supposed to have killed more men than John Wesley Hardin.  A marvelous western--though patently fictitious.And don't watch it hoping to look into the cold, dark, historical secrets of Mormon Danism.

This is a very good movie about that very theme. It deals with the protection of Brigham Young how much is true I don't know but it does make a good story. Porter Rockwell was a trapper and also an Avenging Angel. Early on in History after the Mormons moved to the Salt Lake area the angels were assembled to keep the US army at bay which they did for several years.

377099,AWHS1TFR7S1NL,6303477135,Michael A. Quebec,"[6, 8]","This movie, along with ""Rough Riders"", is another fine example of Tom Berenger's (& TNT's) talent for taking a historical setting, fictionalizing it (in a realistic way), putting in some subtle social/political commentary (disguised in a historical setting, kind of like the way science-fiction writers do it), & adding entertaining elements (in this case, rousing action sequences & romance to boot!) to make a story that both entertains & educates at the same time.Most people who wouldn't be able to sit through a history class would, at the same time, enjoy movies like this.  (I'm a history buff, but my friends aren't.  However, when I had them over for a ""movie-night"" get together at my house, they really got into the conspiracy murder plot & they loved the action sequences & love story, as well as seeing Coburn & Heston in their roles as real-life historical figures.)Berenger, as producer & star, knows how to choose a thoughtful subject for a film.  This movie, in a historical context, is really about religious faith & the different levels of belief.  His character, Miles Utley, is devoted to the Mormon church, which is both his strength AND his weakness, since he kills an innocent man at the beginning, in the name of God.  As the film progresses, he uncovers a plot to murder Brigham Young (Charlton Heston, the former ""Moses"" from ""The Ten Commandments!"") by subordinates who wish to take over the church, in order to ""save"" it, according to their own beliefs & purposes.With today's events & headlines concerning both ""The War on Terror"" & the Catholic Church abuse scandals (and cover up), this movie's theme is especially poignant today.Historical dramas serve the same purpose as science-fiction stories.  They make the audience think about current issues without preaching.  The best ones also manage to entertain the audience in the process.  ""Avenging Angel"" succeeds on all counts.  It's a western, a mystery, a thriller, a love story, & an action-drama all rolled into one!  It's ""a thinking man's"" action movie.Besides purchasing this movie, I also suggest checking out the previously mentioned ""Rough Riders"", as well as ""Buffalo Soldiers"", ""The Broken Chain"", ""Geronimo"", ""Wallace"", & ""Andersonville"" (all from TNT), ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" & ""In Pursuit of Honor"" (both from HBO), as well as ""Son of The Morning Star"" (aired on ABC during it's initial run.)  All of these shows prove that tv isn't just ""mindless entertainment"", as some pompous critics have claimed.History isn't about dates & cold facts (the way most history classes are taught in high-school.)  I agree with most people, in that history taught in that manner is boring!  History is about people & the human condition.
