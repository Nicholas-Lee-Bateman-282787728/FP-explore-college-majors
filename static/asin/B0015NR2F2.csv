1150030,AG4D06TQLDFMH,B0015NR2F2,"Chris Reich ""Business Physicist and Astronomer""","[0, 0]","I thoroughly enjoyed this very moving performance though I too agree that Butterfly's entrance was weak. The makeup was weak as well. It was often difficult to suspend belief that she was actually a 15 year old innocent girl. Barker comes off a little closer to Elektra than a duped teen. But generally this is quite well played.Suzuki is great. All the men in the cast are superb. Pinkerton makes you want to scream at him and the U.S. consul conveys sympathy well. The marriage broker is nearly a mime but plays well the character at which to boo and hiss.The child could have had some acting coaching. Granted, his part is nearly irrelevant but he was rather wooden.So I took off a star. Still I'm glad to have this in my collection and wonder if there is anything better available? There are some very tough parts in this opera so I don't see a young, cute Asian being able to carry the music. That said, the performance may be just about as good as it can get.If you're relatively new to opera, this a great DVD to buy. It's not expensive and the story is very compelling. Seasoned viewers may find more fault.Hope this helps someone decide to buy.",4,Enjoyed This Moving Performance,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2013,1153,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'moving', 'performance', 'too', 'agree', 'Butterfly', 'entrance', 'was', 'weak', 'makeup', 'was', 'weak', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'often', 'difficult', 'suspend', 'belief', 'was', 'actually', '15', 'year', 'old', 'innocent', 'girl', 'Barker', 'off', 'little', 'closer', 'Elektra', 'duped', 'teen', 'generally', 'quite', 'well', 'played.Suzuki', 'great', 'men', 'cast', 'are', 'superb', 'Pinkerton', 'want', 'scream', 'U.S.', 'consul', 'conveys', 'sympathy', 'well', 'marriage', 'broker', 'nearly', 'mime', 'well', 'character', 'boo', 'hiss.The', 'child', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'acting', 'coaching', 'Granted', 'part', 'nearly', 'irrelevant', 'was', 'rather', 'wooden.So', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'Still', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'collection', 'wonder', 'anything', 'better', 'available', 'are', 'very', 'tough', 'parts', 'opera', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'young', 'cute', 'Asian', 'being', 'able', 'carry', 'music', 'said', 'performance', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'get.If', ""'re"", 'relatively', 'new', 'opera', 'great', 'DVD', 'buy', 'not', 'expensive', 'story', 'very', 'compelling', 'Seasoned', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'more', 'fault.Hope', 'someone', 'decide', 'buy']","Madama Butterfly / Opera Australia, Cheryl Barker, Jay Hunter Morris"

1150033,A2WG3SXKMQME4,B0015NR2F2,"Peter M. Alexander ""petermalex""","[0, 0]","This is a solid, professional Butterfly, and all around the best version on DVD that I have seen. (I do not claim to have seen all of them, however.) The sound quality is probably the most disappointing factor, and definitely keeps this at 4 stars. That said, the overall level of the performance is high.The production is quite lovely&#8212;as good as you can expect in Sidney's beautiful but compromised opera house&#8212;and honors Puccini's score and understanding of the story. The cast is solid, if not the best that could be imagined, and the orchestra is first-rate. I found the acting good throughout, with many nice touches, especially by Jay Hunter Morris as Pinkerton&#8212;a notoriously ungrateful role to do justice to. He has to be callous enough to reflect the American arrogance toward the culture and the people of Japan (not to mention Butterfly!) but not so nasty that Butterfly's devotion, and their gorgeous love music become meaningless.  I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone who either is looking for one outstanding Butterfly for their collection, or anyone who wants to fill out their collection with a solid, well performed traditional Butterfly.",4,Overall a first-rate production and performance,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,1182,"['solid', 'professional', 'Butterfly', 'best', 'version', 'DVD', 'have', 'seen', 'do', 'not', 'claim', 'have', 'seen', 'however', 'sound', 'quality', 'probably', 'most', 'disappointing', 'factor', 'definitely', 'keeps', '4', 'stars', 'said', 'overall', 'level', 'performance', 'high.The', 'production', 'quite', 'lovely', '8212', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'expect', 'Sidney', 'beautiful', 'compromised', 'opera', 'house', '8212', 'honors', 'Puccini', 'score', 'understanding', 'story', 'cast', 'solid', 'not', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'imagined', 'orchestra', 'first-rate', 'found', 'acting', 'good', 'many', 'nice', 'touches', 'especially', 'Jay', 'Hunter', 'Morris', 'Pinkerton', '8212', 'notoriously', 'ungrateful', 'role', 'do', 'justice', 'be', 'callous', 'enough', 'reflect', 'American', 'arrogance', 'culture', 'people', 'Japan', 'not', 'mention', 'Butterfly', 'not', 'so', 'nasty', 'Butterfly', 'devotion', 'gorgeous', 'love', 'music', 'become', 'meaningless', 'do', 'not', 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'one', 'outstanding', 'Butterfly', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'fill', 'out', 'collection', 'solid', 'well', 'performed', 'traditional', 'Butterfly']","Madama Butterfly / Opera Australia, Cheryl Barker, Jay Hunter Morris"
1150034,A2WCM95GPISEEH,B0015NR2F2,Roderick Keech,"[1, 1]","I can only reiterate what the first reviewer has stated.  Opera Australia has a knack of getting to the heart of the matter, without using distracting gimmickry of staging etc.I have long believed Cheryl Barker to be one of the most under-appreciated sopranos in the world.  Her ability to act are on a par with that outrageous Diva Angela Gheorghiu, yet her 'Australian-ness' has kept her grounded and a complelety professional and delightful performer.The acoustics of the Sydney Opera House have always been difficult.  It is a great pity that the ABC didn't record this in Melbourne during its season, as the acoustics are far superior.  It is clear that no wizardry has been weaved to enhance the sound of this 1997 production, and that is evident also on the CD release (ABC Classics/Universal Music 476104-0).  One can only hope that with all the new technology available for audio and video restoration, that ABC Classics will release an improved version, because this performance, in my mind, is hard to beat.I guess what Opera Australia do best is bring plausibility to their productions, which instantly make them more accessible and enjoyable.  Casting fine singers who look the part is also another part of their success.Despite the caveats of the sound, I still return to this production for sheer enjoyment.  While I don't mind updating Opera settings, I find the 2003 Netherlands Opera performanceMadama Butterfly - Giacomo Puccini / Netherlands Opera, also starring Cheryl Barker, to be alienating in its austerity.Fingers crossed for a complete Blu-Ray restoration of this beautifully sung and staged performance.",5,The best performance,1246492800,"07 2, 2009",2009,1631,"['can', 'only', 'reiterate', 'what', 'first', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'Opera', 'Australia', 'knack', 'getting', 'heart', 'matter', 'using', 'distracting', 'gimmickry', 'staging', 'etc.I', 'have', 'long', 'believed', 'Cheryl', 'Barker', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'under-appreciated', 'sopranos', 'world', 'ability', 'act', 'are', 'par', 'outrageous', 'Diva', 'Angela', 'Gheorghiu', 'yet', ""'Australian-ness"", 'kept', 'grounded', 'complelety', 'professional', 'delightful', 'performer.The', 'acoustics', 'Sydney', 'Opera', 'House', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'difficult', 'great', 'pity', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'record', 'Melbourne', 'season', 'acoustics', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'clear', 'wizardry', 'been', 'weaved', 'enhance', 'sound', '1997', 'production', 'evident', 'also', 'CD', 'release', 'ABC', 'Classics/Universal', 'Music', '476104-0', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'new', 'technology', 'available', 'audio', 'video', 'restoration', 'ABC', 'Classics', 'will', 'release', 'improved', 'version', 'performance', 'mind', 'hard', 'beat.I', 'guess', 'what', 'Opera', 'Australia', 'do', 'best', 'bring', 'plausibility', 'productions', 'instantly', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'enjoyable', 'Casting', 'fine', 'singers', 'who', 'look', 'part', 'also', 'part', 'success.Despite', 'caveats', 'sound', 'still', 'return', 'production', 'sheer', 'enjoyment', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'updating', 'Opera', 'settings', 'find', '2003', 'Netherlands', 'Opera', 'performanceMadama', 'Butterfly', 'Giacomo', 'Puccini', '/', 'Netherlands', 'Opera', 'also', 'starring', 'Cheryl', 'Barker', 'be', 'alienating', 'austerity.Fingers', 'crossed', 'complete', 'Blu-Ray', 'restoration', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'staged', 'performance']","Madama Butterfly / Opera Australia, Cheryl Barker, Jay Hunter Morris"
