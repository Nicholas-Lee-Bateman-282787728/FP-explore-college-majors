I remember the first time I stopped to see what it was. It was Mrs. Slocombe's wildly dyed hair that caught my eye. ""What was a woman in her 50's doing with pink hair?"", I remember thinking to myself. It didn't matter, from that point on I was hooked.I would take blank VHS tapes and every time I would catch an episode on TV I would record it. I ended up with a stack of 30+ tapes filled with episodes, all out of order and often repeats. I watched those tapes so often they eventually wore out.I was beyond thrilled with I discovered they put the whole series into a DVD collection. I was so excited when I found there were even 2 episodes from the last season of the series I had never even seen!All the characters play fun and unique rolls. While the shows setting is almost always the exact same (a department store) the actors are so strong and the dialogue is so witty, it shows just how great a program with outstanding writer and actors can be.For anyone who's a fan of the British Comedy Series, it's a definite MUST HAVE for their DVD collection.

832969,A8YSA65M8ILK2,B0002F6BTM,"cobaltspectre ""Water Rabbit""","[3, 3]","I discovered AYBS on a PBS station during law school.  It was a pleasant, homey program that greatly helped me unwind at bedtime (no mean feat, at the time) so I could eventually fall asleep.  I don't want to imply that it's like a sleeping pill-- it's more like a massage.No sitcoms make me roar with laughter every minute (MST3K came closest, alhough categorizing that as a sitcom, or anything else, is problematic); but, the good ones brighten my mood, especially when the characters come to feel like welcome, comforting, old friends, and I'll always have a warm feeling from seeing the core cast.  John Inman as Mr. Humphries is among my fondest characters from any program, anywhere.The jokes are often pretty silly or over-the-top, making ""The Andy Griffith Show"" seem like ""COPS.""  You come to anticipate the reactions of each character to a given situation with certainty; but, as many reviews will attest, that is something people who like this show enjoy.  I wouldn't quite say that this show is like crossing ""The Office"" with ""Gilligan's Island;"" but, it's tempting (never moreso than when you encounter the ""Guatemalan monkey"").  If I did, I'd say the watchability greatly favored the former parent.  Even though I could see many jokes coming a mile away, they were often done so outrageously that they still sometimes surprised me the first time through.  I found it interesting how the British were prepared (rarely) to make jokes based on cringingly erroneous ethnic stereotypes that wouldn't have been tolerated here in the U.S. decades earlier; and double entendres abound that might have pushed a very mild, harmless program into a later time slot here.When some original cast members had to leave for one reason or another (death being a common one), their replacements had a hard time filling the shoes of their predecessors; but, I'm grateful that they kept the series going as best they could.  Even new cast members contributed to some memorable moments.Unfortunately, I've had horrendous luck with BBC Video quality control with every set I've ever bought, and I'm running into similar problems with the box set of ""Only Fools and Horses,"" also from BBC Video.  The entire current batch of AYBS Disc 11's appears to be corrupt in the same place based on 3 sets I tried (look for it in ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe;"" if yours doesn't start tiling, dropping sound, and generally just becoming a mess when she discusses getting a chip caught in her throat the previous night out with Mrs. Axelby, I envy your good luck).  The second and third sets had a slightly defective Disc 12, as well (I couldn't have known it, but, I should have quit while I was ahead).  Amazon has suspended sales pending correction of the disc defects. I strongly recommend watching any BBC Video release entirely before the inspection period expires if you much mind defective discs; and, I urge you to buy multi-volume sets from sellers like Amazon who can easily replace defective sets, and let you pick out a single set of least-corrupt discs from two sets of mixed quality before you have to send one set back.  Even when I've had to pay a bit more to buy from Amazon, the customer service has made the investment well worthwhile, especially on large, multi-disc sets where the odds favor the occasional bad disc.",5,"Great Show, but BBC Video Quality Control Problems Prevail",1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3324,"['discovered', 'AYBS', 'PBS', 'station', 'law', 'school', 'was', 'pleasant', 'homey', 'program', 'greatly', 'helped', 'unwind', 'bedtime', 'mean', 'feat', 'time', 'so', 'could', 'eventually', 'fall', 'asleep', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'imply', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'more', 'massage.No', 'sitcoms', 'make', 'roar', 'laughter', 'minute', 'MST3K', 'came', 'closest', 'categorizing', 'sitcom', 'anything', 'else', 'problematic', 'good', 'ones', 'brighten', 'mood', 'especially', 'when', 'characters', 'come', 'feel', 'welcome', 'comforting', 'old', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'always', 'have', 'warm', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'core', 'cast', 'John', 'Inman', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'fondest', 'characters', 'program', 'anywhere.The', 'jokes', 'are', 'often', 'pretty', 'silly', 'over-the-top', 'making', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'Show', 'seem', 'COPS', 'come', 'anticipate', 'reactions', 'character', 'given', 'situation', 'certainty', 'many', 'reviews', 'will', 'attest', 'something', 'people', 'who', 'show', 'enjoy', 'would', ""n't"", 'quite', 'say', 'show', 'crossing', 'Office', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'tempting', 'never', 'moreso', 'when', 'encounter', 'Guatemalan', 'monkey', 'did', ""'d"", 'say', 'watchability', 'greatly', 'favored', 'former', 'parent', 'Even', 'could', 'see', 'many', 'jokes', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'were', 'often', 'done', 'so', 'outrageously', 'still', 'sometimes', 'surprised', 'first', 'time', 'found', 'interesting', 'how', 'British', 'were', 'prepared', 'rarely', 'make', 'jokes', 'based', 'cringingly', 'erroneous', 'ethnic', 'stereotypes', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'tolerated', 'here', 'U.S.', 'decades', 'earlier', 'double', 'entendres', 'abound', 'might', 'have', 'pushed', 'very', 'mild', 'harmless', 'program', 'later', 'time', 'slot', 'here.When', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'had', 'leave', 'one', 'reason', 'death', 'being', 'common', 'one', 'replacements', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'filling', 'shoes', 'predecessors', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'kept', 'series', 'going', 'best', 'could', 'Even', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'contributed', 'memorable', 'moments.Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'had', 'horrendous', 'luck', 'BBC', 'Video', 'quality', 'control', 'set', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bought', ""'m"", 'running', 'similar', 'problems', 'box', 'set', 'Only', 'Fools', 'Horses', 'also', 'BBC', 'Video', 'entire', 'current', 'batch', 'AYBS', 'Disc', '11', 'be', 'corrupt', 'same', 'place', 'based', '3', 'sets', 'tried', 'look', 'Erotic', 'Dreams', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'yours', ""n't"", 'start', 'tiling', 'dropping', 'sound', 'generally', 'just', 'becoming', 'mess', 'when', 'getting', 'chip', 'caught', 'throat', 'previous', 'night', 'Mrs.', 'Axelby', 'envy', 'good', 'luck', 'second', 'third', 'sets', 'had', 'slightly', 'defective', 'Disc', '12', 'as', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'should', 'have', 'quit', 'was', 'ahead', 'Amazon', 'suspended', 'sales', 'pending', 'correction', 'disc', 'defects', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'BBC', 'Video', 'release', 'entirely', 'inspection', 'period', 'much', 'defective', 'discs', 'urge', 'buy', 'multi-volume', 'sets', 'sellers', 'Amazon', 'who', 'can', 'easily', 'replace', 'defective', 'sets', 'let', 'pick', 'out', 'single', 'set', 'least-corrupt', 'discs', 'two', 'sets', 'mixed', 'quality', 'have', 'send', 'one', 'set', 'back', 'Even', 'when', ""'ve"", 'had', 'pay', 'bit', 'more', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'service', 'made', 'investment', 'well', 'worthwhile', 'especially', 'large', 'multi-disc', 'sets', 'where', 'odds', 'favor', 'occasional', 'bad', 'disc']",Are You Being Served?

While I obviously have no complaints about the episodes themselves, the DVD set does have a couple of deficiencies.  First, the pilot episode is still only in a black-and-white kinescope; even though the BBC has since restored the pilot's original color, this has not yet been made available on DVD.  Second, the DVD menus are cumbersome, with the unavoidable animation needless and unnecessary.  Moreover, it is not possible to quickly change selection between episodes without having to endure this animation.  Lastly, the bonus features on the 12 episode discs are repetitive and limited, though the two remaining bonus discs contain well-produced programs by PBS and the BBC.

It's just basic fun with no message or subtlety. Forget your political correctness and let yourself be entertained. If you want to know the type of humor in the show, I can't do better than quote John Inman (this isn't in the set, so it's not a spoiler). He was asked which of Mrs. Slocombe's various hair colors he preferred and replied ""I don't mind what color her hair is, as long as it matches her (insert colloquial name for cat here)!""This set has all the episodes from the original AYBS?, plus the first episode of the sequel 'Are You Being Served Again'. (The two series that were made of AYBSA?, some 10 years later, are well worth getting separately.) There are also interviews and specials about the show. Sadly, almost all the cast are gone now; the charm of the series has outlasted its actors. This set is a great memorial for them.",5,Humor in store,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,1356,"['have', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'enjoy', 'secretly', 'knowing', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'grown-up', 'indulge', 'One', 'mine', ""'m"", 'not', 'telling', 'others', 'AYBS', 'most', 'simple', 'unsophisticated', 'humor', 'full', 'double', 'entendres', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'cast', 'put', 'so', 'well', 'especially', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', 'John', 'Inman', 'single', 'middle-aged', 'lady', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'respectively.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'order', 'elevate', 'mind', 'just', 'basic', 'fun', 'message', 'subtlety', 'Forget', 'political', 'correctness', 'let', 'be', 'entertained', 'want', 'know', 'type', 'humor', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'quote', 'John', 'Inman', ""n't"", 'set', 'not', 'spoiler', 'was', 'asked', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'various', 'hair', 'colors', 'preferred', 'replied', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'what', 'color', 'hair', 'as', 'long', 'insert', 'colloquial', 'name', 'cat', 'here', 'set', 'episodes', 'original', 'AYBS', 'first', 'episode', 'sequel', 'Being', 'Served', 'Again', 'two', 'series', 'were', 'made', 'AYBSA', '10', 'years', 'later', 'are', 'well', 'getting', 'separately', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'specials', 'show', 'Sadly', 'almost', 'cast', 'are', 'gone', 'now', 'charm', 'series', 'outlasted', 'actors', 'set', 'great', 'memorial']",Are You Being Served?

I grew up watching sitcoms like Full House, The Cosby Show, Saved By The Bell, The Wonder Years, and Three's Company. Not until just this year have I even seen a BBC sitcom. I have always totally adored British accents and loved the way the British talk and have always found England to be so much better than the U.S. as far as artistic architecture and the way they design the interior of buildings just from what I've seen and read. But I never knew how the British sitcoms were until just a few months ago.I was at a friends' house and we were watching these British sitcoms and Are You Being Served? came on and it was so funny when I saw Mrs. Slocombe staying in this ""apartment"" in the department store and she was going to be with Mr. Humphries after the lights went out and people kept coming in her ""apartment"" and 2 of the guys had to stay in one bed and I was just totally cracking up!! Then the very last thing Mrs. Slocombe says before the credits that I'll never forget, ""Mr. Humphries, Leave My P***y Alone!"" I was just totally rolling on the floor after that. I HAD to buy that episode on DVD and I just got Vol 9 last week and I just totally love this show!! Mr. Humphries and Mrs. Slocombe are just amazing and hilarious!! Since I've seen this episode which is called The Apartment, I have watched many other episodes on PBS and I crack up everytime!! I do plan to own every episode on DVD one day!Another favorite that I also started watching is Keeping Up Appearances and I really wish that was still showing as well. And for years I've heard of Judi Dench and just recently started watching As Time Goes By as well. Judi Dench is also amazing. I really love these British sitcoms so much especially Keeping Up Appearances and Are You Being Served? and now all I can do is watch the DVD's or see re-runs on PBS. I really do wish that they would return Are You Being Served? because in my opinion, it beats any American sitcom any day!!

After choosing an episode, the elevator conductor announces the title and the lift doors open to reveal the plot.The second half of this set (volumes 8-13 with a bonus volume 14) includes some unpopular cast changes but still offers plenty of hilarious episodes. Starting with volume 8, Mr. Grainger is replaced by a string of, mostly unmemorable, characters, and Mr. Lucas will eventually be replaced by the more mean-spirited and less tactful Mr. Spooner.  Still, more of my personal favorites are nestled within the later volumes of this set.  In ""Grounds for Divorce"" it seems almost every female member of Grace Brothers is enamored with Captain Peacock. ""The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocomb"" are about her obsession with you know who (in this case, he's not ""free""). ""The Hero"" with Capt. Peacock developing a boil on his bum is another of my favorites. It also includes Trevor Bannister's last episode ""The Punch and Judy Affair"" which, although I find to be boring and repetitive, is a fan favorite.What I also enjoy about both DVD sets for this series are the extras in volumes 7 and 14. You get half hour bios on John Inman, Molly Sugden, and Wendy Richard. Each bio includes pre-AYBS? clips (Sugden in ""The Liver Birds,"" ""Coronation Street;"" Richard in ""The Newcomers,"" ""Hugh and I,"" ""Up Pompeii!,"" ""Dad's Army,"" etc.). In Richard's bio, there are many clips from the long-running soap opera EastEnders. They also include interview clips with Inman, Bannister, Frank Thornton, Richard, and Sugden as well as others that look like they were recorded fairly recently. ""The Best of..."" extra on volume 14 was disappointing. I thought John Inman would provide commentary to AYBS? clips. Actually, it is just a bunch of random clips (some quite long) that any fan of AYBS? has seen many times before. The piece on Molly Sugden looked as if it was going to be the same clip show but, fortunately, ends up with more interviews with actors and a look at Sugden's life in her own words which makes for a very welcomed extra. The first episode of Grace and Favour is also included and I recommend picking up the DVD with all the episodes of this cute series that is now available. This series was great, and ""I am unanimous in that.""",5,They all did very well,1102809600,"12 12, 2004",2004,3322,"['did', 'not', 'already', 'have', 'season', '1-5', 'box', 'set', 'season', '6-10', 'box', 'set', 'separately', 'would', 'jump', 'deal', 'would', 'have', 'saved', '25', 'percent', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'are', 'fan', 'AYBS', 'are', 'eventually', 'going', 'want', 'whole', 'series', 'so', 'why', 'wait', 'Get', 'enjoy', '69', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'extras', 'now', 'better', 'then', 'waiting', 'PBS', 'air', 'fund', 'raising', 'telethons', 'Here', 'get', 'first', 'half', 'set', 'volumes', '1-6', 'bonus', 'volume', '7', 'best', 'AYBS', 'material', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'Arthur', 'Brough', 'Mr.', 'Grainger', 'Harold', 'Bennett', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Grace', 'Larry', 'Martyn', 'Mr.', 'Mash', 'Trevor', 'Bannister', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'include', 'episodes', 'black', 'white', 'pilot', 'Advertise', 'season', '5', 'Volume', '2', 'also', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'AYBS', 'episode', 'Big', 'Brother', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Rumbold', 'closed', 'circuit', 'television', 'store', 'uncover', 'burglar', 'instead', 'spy', 'Grace', 'Brother', 'staff', 'artistic', 'details', 'AYBS', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'nice', 'choosing', 'episode', 'elevator', 'conductor', 'title', 'lift', 'doors', 'open', 'reveal', 'plot.The', 'second', 'half', 'set', 'volumes', '8-13', 'bonus', 'volume', '14', 'unpopular', 'cast', 'changes', 'still', 'plenty', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'Starting', 'volume', '8', 'Mr.', 'Grainger', 'replaced', 'string', 'mostly', 'unmemorable', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'replaced', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'less', 'tactful', 'Mr.', 'Spooner', 'Still', 'more', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'nestled', 'later', 'volumes', 'set', 'Grounds', 'Divorce', 'almost', 'female', 'member', 'Grace', 'Brothers', 'enamored', 'Captain', 'Peacock', 'Erotic', 'Dreams', 'Mrs.', 'Slocomb', 'are', 'obsession', 'know', 'who', 'case', 'not', 'free', 'Hero', 'Capt', 'Peacock', 'developing', 'boil', 'bum', 'favorites', 'also', 'Trevor', 'Bannister', 'last', 'episode', 'Punch', 'Judy', 'Affair', 'find', 'be', 'boring', 'repetitive', 'fan', 'favorite.What', 'also', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'sets', 'series', 'are', 'extras', 'volumes', '7', '14', 'get', 'half', 'hour', 'bios', 'John', 'Inman', 'Molly', 'Sugden', 'Wendy', 'Richard', 'bio', 'pre-AYBS', 'clips', 'Sugden', 'Liver', 'Birds', 'Coronation', 'Street', 'Richard', 'Newcomers', 'Hugh', 'Up', 'Pompeii', 'Dad', 'Army', 'etc.', 'Richard', 'bio', 'are', 'many', 'clips', 'long-running', 'soap', 'opera', 'EastEnders', 'also', 'include', 'interview', 'clips', 'Inman', 'Bannister', 'Frank', 'Thornton', 'Richard', 'Sugden', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'look', 'were', 'recorded', 'fairly', 'recently', 'Best', 'extra', 'volume', '14', 'was', 'disappointing', 'thought', 'John', 'Inman', 'would', 'provide', 'commentary', 'AYBS', 'clips', 'Actually', 'just', 'bunch', 'random', 'clips', 'quite', 'long', 'fan', 'AYBS', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'piece', 'Molly', 'Sugden', 'looked', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'same', 'clip', 'show', 'fortunately', 'up', 'more', 'interviews', 'actors', 'look', 'Sugden', 'life', 'own', 'words', 'very', 'welcomed', 'extra', 'first', 'episode', 'Grace', 'Favour', 'also', 'included', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'cute', 'series', 'now', 'available', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'am', 'unanimous']",Are You Being Served?

833030,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0002F6BTM,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Are You Being Served(AYBS)which ran from 1972 to 1985,certainly has to go down as one of the BBC's biggest television sitcom triumphs ever.This rather ordinary setting in an old style English department store was populated with some of the most eccentric but lovable characters you would ever find on TV anywhere.Mrs Slocombe(Mollie Sugden)whose hairstyle/colour changed as often as the weather.Her catch phrases were,among others,""weak as water"",when referring to the men.When she wanted to emphasize a statement she would say""...and I am unanimous in that..."".Miss.Brahms(Wendy Richards)was Mrs.Slocombe's assistant in the womens wear department,whose cockney accent and less than stellar mind,would sometimes rate an admonishment from Mrs.Slocombe in the form of""That will all,Miss Brahms"".Mr.Peacock(Frank Thornton)whose pompous attitude and sarcasm/stares as the stores floorwalker were something else to behold.He was always berating the maintenance staff for being on the floor during open hours.Mr.Grainger(Arthur Brough)was the oldest and most crotchety man on the floor and senior salesman in the mens wear department.He seem to be doing a constant reprising of Winston Churchill.If trouble arose for him it was always""...a glass of water for Mr Grainger"".Mr.Humphries(John Inman)was the effeminate/mama's boy who never left home.He was second behind Mr.Grainger.When Capt.Peacock would glance his way with""Are you free,Mr.Humphries"",an inevitably alone Mr.Humphries would respond""Yes,I am free"" and do his famous quick walk over to the Captain.Mr.Lucas(Trevor Bannister) was the young assistant to Mr Humphries,and he always had a comeback,especially towards Mrs.Slocombe.Mr. Rumbold(Nicholas Smith)was the Mickey Mouse eared boss of all(next of course behind the young Mr Grace,the owner).He would steal others suggestions for his own and was sometimes hard to get a point through to;in other words,pretty thick.This cornucopia of characters,along with so many other memorable ones,with all their foibles and quirks were quite lovable and one could easily empathize with them as they all had their feet firmly based in reality;the cornerstone of good comedy.Technically speaking the shows(all 69 eps on 14 discs,two in one slip case)have been transferred wonderfully.The only glitch in the set that I found was on the ep ""Pop Star"".During the beginning music it suddenly stalls(stuck on one note)for two or three seconds then continues.The film itself is still moving so it is either a glitch from the original film master or something from the transfer.Along with the 69 eps are the original pilot.Also are some wonderful extras on the two end discs.They contain featurettes on three of its main stars,the best of AYBS,a AYBS special starring Inman playing Mr Humphries and his mother and ep#1 from Grace and Favour,the sequel series to AYBS.Along with many of the earlier eps comes some trivia about each and each ep features a lead in from a closing and opening elevator door,with the title of the ep being spoken.There is a lexicon of sorts included for those who don't quite get all of the English phraseology.All in all a highly recommended box set of one of the funniest BBC shows ever to air.Some of the funniest double entendre's,farce and even slapstick will have you laughing out loud as you watch them.Highly Recommended.FYI- Out of most of the main cast only Frank Thornton(Mr Peacock) and Nicholas Smith(Mr.Rumbold) are still with us as of this writing.",5,The ultimate box set for all AYBS fans!,1307836800,"06 12, 2011",2011,3479,"['Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'AYBS', 'ran', '1972', '1985',

833034,A10X3LYWCWIDAH,B0002F6BTM,R. Stephen Franks,"[0, 0]","Unless you are living on another planet and never heard of PBS TV, you must have watched at least one episode of Are You Being Served. It was hands down, the funniest, most loved and revered, longest running comedy on British TV. Its plot revolved around an aging department store and its inept management. Its Men and Women departments are thrown together on the same floor and must share, or should I say, compete with each other for floor space and customers. Its employees are an odd lot of characters whose various personalities clash with riotous results. That, coupled with a woman chasing octogenarian owner and a department manager who, though well intended, hasn't a clue how to manage successfully, promises hours of laughs and entertainment.What originally aired as a B&W; pilot and schedule filler turned into a long running comedy of several years.

833047,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B0002F6BTM,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[8, 10]","Well this is not just any department store, this is Grace Bros one of London Towne's finest department stores.  The story line is set in the late early to late 70's a time before the big box stores Like WALMART, Home Depot and the rest.  The Department store was still King and Grace Bros wasone of the UK's  finest and strangest too.  Grace Bros Department store is the backdrop for the antics of Are You Being Served.We come to know the sales team in two of Grace Bros high end departments.  Ladies Intimate Appearl headed by Ms Betty Slocumbe a nice enough lady who at least understands the needs of the posh classes enough to sell to them but a lady equally at home on a bar stool in a trucker or biker bar as you will find out.  Ms. Brahms a brassy young thing who is not just common but some would say dead common or common as muck, with her heavy East End of London accent as second string in the ladies department she adds a bit of spice to all the upper crust goings on.For the men there were a succession of players as the turn over in the Men's Ready Made Area was higher during the shows run.  Two who stayed was the man in the Middle Mr. Claybourne Wilburforce Humpries a dandy foppish fellow in his fine taylored suits by day and wild life by night.  Mr Humphries sometimes came in dressed in ways that told tales that could easily set the heart crossways within you.  Mr. Humphries tape measure in hand was always at the ready to take your inside leg measurements.  He was a man who at middle age still lived with his mother who lives quite an exciting life if Mr Humphries stories do her justice.There is Mr Lucas a skirt chasing dog wrapped in the every so thin vaneer of a gentleman but only while a paying Grace Bros customer is within range.  Mr. Lucas is a nice enough sort but his commissions are always stay low because, his eyes are on the ladies figures not the sales figures.There is the referee of this wild bunch floor walker Captain Peacock a very important man at Grace Bros but only if you count being ""Self Important"".  Captain Peacock who served in the military in the Big War WW2 is at the very bottom rung of Grace Bros, Middle Management with desires to move higher.  Captain Peacosk is not just a dog he is an old dog who can see a woman a mile away on a cloudy day and from further still if he is near an open window.  If you could buy Captain Peacock for what you end up thinking he is worth and sell him at what he thinks he is worth you would be far richer than Bill Gates himself at the end of the transaction.Mr. Cusbert Rumbold is sort of the director of operations for the floor, you must remember department stores of quality had layers of middle management during this era.  Anyways before meeting Mr. Cusbert Rumbold on Are You Being Served I did not know what a Toby Jug was now I do.  Look at the man's ears for goodness sake his humorous value to the show is built in.There is sweet kind if brusk and a tad common voice of the working man, in support staff worker Mr Harman whose appearance on the floor during store opening hours sends Mrs Slocumbe and Captain Peacock into a warp driven tizzy.  There are some floor displays that will just blow you away with their odd ball humorous charm.  The real secret to are you being served is almost everything said in the show has a dual meaning, one clean and another that is slightly less wholesome.  Mrs Slocumbe has a pet cat, she adores and she never fails to tell you of all the high life and drama she has at home with her Pussy named Tittles.Then there is Mr Grace.  An old but lovable man clinging to life by a thread thinner than the fleeting trail left by a tired electron as it circles its atoms nucleas.  Mr Grace still loves the ladies but alas is too feeble to act on any of his desires leaving him fun but harmless.  He is funny in his own right as he brings a certain depth and old world charm to the role it would not have had without his efforts.Remember the flagship item on offer at any old line department store after all was Service, Service Service along with knowledge of products.  With Are You Being Served its not like an on location store where things look way real.  The stories are tame, relics of their times 1973 to the early 80's.  The in store sets are only barely believable sort of like the old Doctor Who Sets.  But you do not buy or enjoy Are You Being Served for the authenticity of the sets or cutting edge storylines.  Are You Being Served provides you comedy that is second to none a task it still delivers does with vigor and power despite its age.  I give Are You Being served 5 stars only because, I can not give it more.  If you love british comedy you must have Are You Being Served in your collection it is one of the staples and for its price of the complete set a pretty good value.Enjoy I brought it so I will be

Her junior is sexy Miss Brahms (Wendy Richard), who is constantly fighting off the advances of the menswear junior, Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister, who left the show after series seven due to a scheduling conflict).  From series eight on, Mr. Spooner (Mike Berry--a former singer) takes over as the new menswear junior, flirting with Miss Brahms and insulting Mrs. Slocombe at every opportunity!  The menswear department is headed by curmudgeonly old Mr. Grainger (Arthur Brough, who died (aged 73) following series five).  In between him and Mr. Lucas is the flamboyant Mr. Humphreys (John Inman).  With his mincing gait, outrageous costumes, and familiar cry of ""I'm free,"" he's my personal favourite--though the whole cast really is terrific!Of course one cannot forget the subtly lecherous floorwalker, Captain Peacock, a pompous ex-army officer (or so he claims).  One gets a sense that this is probably the only position of authority he's ever had, and he milks it for all its worth, barking orders at his underlings at every opportunity.  His favourite target is the rough, bawdy maintenance man, Mr. Mash (replaced by Mr. Harman in the fourth series), a militant trade unionist who loves to goad Cpt. Peacock (and who probably makes more money than Peacock does too!).  Of the four actors who temporarily took over the role of department head following Brough's death, my favourite is Alfie Bass, who played shrewd Mr. Goldberg, himself an ex-army man, and from whom we glean a lot more about Corporal--I mean Captain--Peacock than Peacock would care to have known!Then there is Mr. Rumbold, the bald-pated, jug-eared department manager (like Mollie Sugden, Nicholas Smith was very good-natured in allowing his physical appearance to be the basis of so much humour!).  Finally, there is Young Mr. Grace, the elderly and extremely frail but hilariously lustful store owner (Harold Bennett, who died of a heart attack in 1981 following series eight, was 74 when the series began!).There are two discs of DVD extras, the first of which consists of three 30-minute profiles (John Inman (1999), Mollie Sugden (1998), and Wendy Richard (2001)), each of which provides a brief bio, snippets from the various television productions in which the actor has been involved, and remembrances from fellow actors.  The final feature is ""Are You Being Confused?"", a text-based dictionary of British slang.  The second disc contains two features which have appeared as PBS specials over the years:  Firstly, there is the 75-minute ""The Best of Are You Being Served?"", which is hosted by Mr. Humphreys and his mother (both played by John Inman, of course!), and which contains snippets of some of the funniest moments in the series.  Secondly is the lovely 90-minute profile of Mollie Sugden (2002), which also contains snippets from the shows she's been in and remembrances from fellow actors, yet it doesn't entirely duplicate the other profile.  Also included is the first episode of the 1992 sequel, ""Are You Being Served? Again!"".With scripts liberally laced with double entendres, innuendos and puns, and a cast of characters made all the more memorable by some of the most capable actors in British comedy, this is character comedy at its best--a real Britcom classic!",5,A British Comedy Classic!,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,3878,"['Ten', 'series', 'classic', 'Britcom', 'were', 'produced', '1973-1985', 'sixty-nine', '30-minute', 'episodes', 'including', 'black-and-white', 'pilot', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'positioned', 'chronologically', 'order', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'are', 'here', 'one', 'boxed', 'set.The', 'series', 'staff', 'Grace', 'Brothers', 'Department', 'Store', 'particulary', 'staff', 'menswear', 'ladieswear', 'ladies', 'department', 'headed', 'pompous', 'air-assuming', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', 'bit', 'man', 'eater', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'one', 'forever', 'fretting', 'Tiddles', 'pussy', 'cat', 'junior', 'sexy', 'Miss', 'Brahms', 'Wendy', 'Richard', 'who', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'off', 'advances', 'menswear', 'junior', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'Trevor', 'Bannister', 'who', 'left', 'show', 'series', 'seven', 'due', 'scheduling', 'conflict', 'series', 'eight', 'Mr.', 'Spooner', 'Mike', 'Berry', 'former', 'singer', 'over', 'new', 'menswear', 'junior', 'flirting', 'Miss', 'Brahms', 'insulting', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'opportunity', 'menswear', 'department', 'headed', 'curmudgeonly', 'old', 'Mr.', 'Grainger', 'Arthur', 'Brough', 'who', 'died', 'aged', '73', 'following', 'series', 'five', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'flamboyant', 'Mr.', 'Humphreys', 'John', 'Inman', 'mincing', 'gait', 'outrageous', 'costumes', 'familiar', 'cry', ""'m"", 'free', 'personal', 'favourite', 'whole', 'cast', 'really', 'terrific', 'course', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'forget', 'subtly', 'lecherous', 'floorwalker', 'Captain', 'Peacock', 'pompous', 'ex-army', 'officer', 'so', 'One', 'sense', 'probably', 'only', 'position', 'authority', 'ever', 'had', 'worth', 'barking', 'orders', 'underlings', 'opportunity', 'favourite', 'target', 'rough', 'bawdy', 'maintenance', 'man', 'Mr.', 'Mash', 'replaced', 'Mr.', 'Harman', 'fourth', 'series', 'militant', 'trade', 'unionist', 'who', 'goad', 'Cpt', 'Peacock', 'who', 'probably', 'more', 'money', 'Peacock', 'too', 'four', 'actors', 'who', 'temporarily', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'department', 'head', 'following', 'Brough', 'death', 'favourite', 'Alfie', 'Bass', 'who', 'played', 'shrewd', 'Mr.', 'Goldberg', 'ex-army', 'man', 'whom', 'glean', 'lot', 'more', 'Corporal', 'mean', 'Captain', 'Peacock', 'Peacock', 'would', 'care', 'have', 'known', 'Then', 'Mr.', 'Rumbold', 'bald-pated', 'jug-eared', 'department', 'manager', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', 'Nicholas', 'Smith', 'was', 'very', 'good-natured', 'allowing', 'physical', 'appearance', 'be', 'basis', 'so', 'much', 'humour', 'Finally', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Grace', 'elderly', 'extremely', 'frail', 'hilariously', 'lustful', 'store', 'owner', 'Harold', 'Bennett', 'who', 'died', 'heart', 'attack', '1981', 'following', 'series', 'eight', 'was', '74', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'are', 'two', 'discs', 'DVD', 'extras', 'first', 'three', '30-minute', 'profiles', 'John', 'Inman', '1999', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', '1998', 'Wendy', 'Richard', '2001', 'brief', 'bio', 'snippets', 'various', 'television', 'productions', 'actor', 'been', 'involved', 'remembrances', 'fellow', 'actors', 'final', 'feature', 'Are', 'Being', 'Confused', 'text-based', 'dictionary', 'British', 'slang', 'second', 'disc', 'contains', 'two', 'features', 'have', 'appeared', 'PBS', 'specials', 'years', 'Firstly', '75-minute', 'Best', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'hosted', 'Mr.', 'Humphreys', 'mother', 'played', 'John', 'Inman', 'course', 'snippets', 'funniest', 'moments', 'series', 'Secondly', 'lovely', '90-minute', 'profile', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', '2002', 'also', 'snippets', 'shows', 'been', 'remembrances', 'fellow', 'actors', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'duplicate', 'other', 'profile', 'Also', 'included', 'first', 'episode', '1992', 'sequel', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'Again', '.With', 'scripts', 'liberally', 'laced', 'double', 'entendres', 'innuendos', 'puns', 'cast', 'characters', 'made', 'more', 'memorable', 'most', 'capable', 'actors', 'British', 'comedy', 'character', 'comedy', 'best', 'real', 'Britcom', 'classic']",Are You Being Served?

Now that it is on DVD, I finally bought it. This is a cleverly done show. Innuendo and sly remarks abound to draw the viewer in and laugh out loud. British television doesn't have to be profane or specific to be funny and this is a true example of how they do it.The actors all work well together and one can see the chemistry abound. It is no wonder this show aired on BBC for so long and why it continues to captivate viewers here across the pond, years after its end.This complete collection contains 14 discs that contain all 69 episodes of the series and DVD extras.

If the only thing you know of British comedy is Monty Python, do yourself a favor and get this set.The premise of a sit com set in a department store is, I admit, not the most exciting thing, but the comedy, writing and acting are superb and truly makes this television show so memorable and hilarious.  The first seven discs are magnificent and, though there are a few camera errors here and there, it does not detract from the overall package.However, as you start to get into disc 8 the original cast starts to become replaced.
