928147,A1VY688L9N9QXD,B000AM4PBS,A. Chopra,"[13, 17]","It needs no introduction even to those who never watched it that ""Friends"" is the most popular daily sitcom of all times.  It is a story about six people living together and great friends. All are funny, successful and what they do professionally (except the funniest - Joey), looking for some love, fun, and companionship in their lives (Aren't we all?). The life that is full of challenges and changing relationships, only support and love of your friends can make it easy and sweet.One thing about this sitcom is that unlike other shows, you never get bored of watching them over and over again. That makes the best reason to buy this collector's set of all the ten seasons. I actually had the season 4 and 7 bought individually, but when I saw this Limited edition set, I just couldn't stop myself. Believe me, no point in buying seasons individually, just buy the whole set if you can and you will never regret it. The fun is when you watch the seasons back to back and you don't even realize that this sitcom was entertaining millions of people around the globe for a decade! That's the beauty of it. Having said that, I don't think paying $300 for this entire set is too much. It will entertain you for few more decades to come!",5,The one with all the Fun!,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,1235,"['introduction', 'even', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'Friends', 'most', 'popular', 'daily', 'sitcom', 'times', 'story', 'six', 'people', 'living', 'together', 'great', 'friends', 'are', 'funny', 'successful', 'what', 'do', 'professionally', 'funniest', 'Joey', 'looking', 'love', 'fun', 'companionship', 'lives', 'Are', ""n't"", 'life', 'full', 'challenges', 'changing', 'relationships', 'only', 'support', 'love', 'friends', 'can', 'make', 'easy', 'sweet.One', 'thing', 'sitcom', 'other', 'shows', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'best', 'reason', 'buy', 'collector', 'set', 'ten', 'seasons', 'actually', 'had', 'season', '4', '7', 'bought', 'individually', 'when', 'saw', 'Limited', 'edition', 'set', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Believe', 'point', 'buying', 'seasons', 'individually', 'just', 'buy', 'whole', 'set', 'can', 'will', 'never', 'regret', 'fun', 'when', 'watch', 'seasons', 'back', 'back', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'sitcom', 'was', 'entertaining', 'millions', 'people', 'globe', 'decade', 'beauty', 'Having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'paying', '300', 'entire', 'set', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'entertain', 'few', 'more', 'decades', 'come']",N/A

928149,A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,B000AM4PBS,Adam Wood,"[4, 7]","As other reviewers have stated, these are the original broadcast scripts without the added material on the DVDs.  So, if you want the extended versions founds on the DVDs, then you might be disappointed in this set.  If you want the original broadcast versions, then I highly recommend it.  The video quality and widescreen presentation are very nice.I'm very pleased with this set.  The video is the best that I've seen for this series, and the audio quality is great.  I'm only on the first season so far, and while the video detail isn't at the same level as modern shows, it's definitely better than the DVDs to me.  (I actually like that the video isn't a lot more detailed than when I first saw it.  The original Star Trek series is interesting to watch in HD, but you can tell that the make up job on the actors wasn't intended to be seen in HD.)  I'm also very happy with the audio.  I watched almost the entire original run on a 27"" TV in stereo, so to watch it on a 50"" TV and have it look so good and be in surround sound is awesome for me.I was disappointed that the DVDs didn't include the original broadcast versions (even as a viewing option), but that's because I had watched the original broadcasts with friends/family and liked the nostalgia of it.  I own the first two seasons on DVD, but I don't watch them much because of that.  However, for those of you who like the extra material, or who saw the show for the first time on DVD, I totally understand being disappointed that it isn't on the blu-rays.  It would be nice if the blu-rays had the option to watch either version.  For me, though, this release is perfect.As a note, I own the U.K. version.  I bought it from Amazon.co.uk, and as far as I can tell, the discs and video are identical to the U.S. release.  The packaging is a bit different, though.  I mention this because you can sometimes find it quite a bit cheaper there, and I usually get it in Arizona within 10-12 days of them shipping it.(This was updated on 11/27/2012 to try and make it more helpful.)Update 12/17/2012: I've watched the first three seasons so far, and the video and audio quality have stayed the same throughout.  The video isn't as detailed and sharp as current 1080p shows, but it looks great.",5,Original broadcasts with great video/audio quality,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",2012,2252,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'are', 'original', 'broadcast', 'scripts', 'added', 'material', 'DVDs', 'So', 'want', 'extended', 'versions', 'founds', 'DVDs', 'then', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'want', 'original', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'video', 'quality', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'are', 'very', 'nice.I', ""'m"", 'very', 'pleased', 'set', 'video', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'series', 'audio', 'quality', 'great', ""'m"", 'only', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'far', 'video', 'detail', ""n't"", 'same', 'level', 'modern', 'shows', 'definitely', 'better', 'DVDs', 'actually', 'video', ""n't"", 'lot', 'more', 'detailed', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'interesting', 'watch', 'HD', 'can', 'tell', 'make', 'up', 'job', 'actors', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'seen', 'HD', ""'m"", 'also', 'very', 'happy', 'audio', 'watched', 'almost', 'entire', 'original', 'run', '27', 'TV', 'stereo', 'so', 'watch', '50', 'TV', 'have', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'be', 'surround', 'sound', 'awesome', 'me.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVDs', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'original', 'broadcast', 'versions', 'even', 'viewing', 'option', 'had', 'watched', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'friends/family', 'liked', 'nostalgia', 'own', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'much', 'However', 'who', 'extra', 'material', 'who', 'saw', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'DVD', 'totally', 'understand', 'being', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'blu-rays', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'blu-rays', 'had', 'option', 'watch', 'version', 'though', 'release', 'note', 'own', 'U.K.', 'version', 'bought', 'Amazon.co.uk', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'discs', 'video', 'are', 'identical', 'U.S.', 'release', 'packaging', 'bit', 'different', 'mention', 'can', 'sometimes', 'find', 'quite', 'bit', 'cheaper', 'there', 'usually', 'get', 'Arizona', '10-12', 'days', 'shipping', 'was', 'updated', '11/27/2012', 'try', 'make', 'more', 'helpful', 'Update', '12/17/2012', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'so', 'far', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'have', 'stayed', 'same', 'video', ""n't"", 'as', 'detailed', 'sharp', 'current', '1080p', 'shows', 'great']",N/A

928157,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000AM4PBS,andy8047,"[4, 34]","Some fans of NBC's Friends will begin and end their collection of Friends episodes with this item. Others have already purchased the ten season sets individually. This 1994-2004 sitcom has made big stars out of Jennifer Aniston,Courteney Cox Arquette,Lisa Kudrow,Matt LeBlanc,Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. However,Schwimmer has been out of the public eye mostly since the sitcom ended its run. This might be thought of by some as ""Three's Company times two"",since there are six principal characters. When Friends premiered,other hit sitcoms still in prime-time were Frasier,Fox's Married...With Children,ABC's Roseanne and CBS's Murphy Brown. NBC pulled the plug on Frasier along with Friends. Like on ABC's Three's Company,the six Friends were sharing apartments together to cut back on living expenses. Post-Friends,Aniston has been relentlessly making movies like she has been when the sitcom was still on the air. During the run,in July 2000,she married Brad Pitt,they are now divorced. CCA kept a low profile. Pre-Friends,she had a recurring role as Lauren Miller on another NBC sitcom,Family Ties from 1987 to '89. She co-starred opposite Jim Carrey in his first starring film ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE. When she married David Arquette,she adopted his name. Kudrow currently has a series on Cable TV's Home Box Office. LeBlanc continues his role of Joey Tribbiani on Friends' spinoff Joey. Pre-Friends,he became the star of the MWC not-too-successful spinoff Top Of The Heap opposite Joseph Bologna. Perry,like CCA,maintained a low profile. All six stars have made movies during and after the sitcom's run(Aniston is the most consistent of the six). You can see Aniston in films like OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION,RUMOUR HAS IT and BRUCE ALMIGHTY,to name a few. Perry co-starred with Elizabeth Hurley in the 2002 Paramount comedy SERVING SARA. Schwimmer starred in 1998's KISSING A FOOL. Kudrow co-starred with Mira Sorvino in ROMY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. Also,at least most of the six have guest-hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live on various occasions. These six actors will long be remembered and will eventually receive stars on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.",4,With A Little Help From Our Friends,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2171,"['fans', 'NBC', 'Friends', 'will', 'begin', 'end', 'collection', 'Friends', 'item', 'Others', 'have', 'already', 'purchased', 'ten', 'season', 'sets', 'individually', '1994-2004', 'sitcom', 'made', 'big', 'stars', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'Arquette', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'However', 'Schwimmer', 'been', 'public', 'eye', 'mostly', 'sitcom', 'ended', 'run', 'might', 'be', 'thought', 'Three', 'Company', 'two', 'are', 'six', 'principal', 'characters', 'When', 'Friends', 'premiered', 'other', 'hit', 'sitcoms', 'still', 'prime-time', 'were', 'Frasier', 'Fox', 'Married', 'Children', 'ABC', 'Roseanne', 'CBS', 'Murphy', 'Brown', 'NBC', 'pulled', 'plug', 'Frasier', 'Friends', 'ABC', 'Three', 'Company', 'six', 'Friends', 'were', 'sharing', 'apartments', 'together', 'cut', 'back', 'living', 'expenses', 'Post-Friends', 'Aniston', 'been', 'relentlessly', 'making', 'movies', 'been', 'when', 'sitcom', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'run', 'July', '2000', 'married', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'are', 'now', 'divorced', 'CCA', 'kept', 'low', 'profile', 'Pre-Friends', 'had', 'recurring', 'role', 'Lauren', 'Miller', 'NBC', 'sitcom', 'Family', '1987', ""'89"", 'co-starred', 'opposite', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'first', 'starring', 'film', 'ACE', 'VENTURA-PET', 'DETECTIVE', 'When', 'married', 'David', 'Arquette', 'adopted', 'name', 'Kudrow', 'currently', 'series', 'Cable', 'TV', 'Home', 'Box', 'Office', 'LeBlanc', 'role', 'Joey', 'Tribbiani', 'Friends', 'spinoff', 'Joey', 'Pre-Friends', 'became', 'star', 'MWC', 'not-too-successful', 'spinoff', 'Top', 'Heap', 'opposite', 'Joseph', 'Bologna', 'Perry', 'CCA', 'maintained', 'low', 'profile', 'six', 'stars', 'have', 'made', 'movies', 'sitcom', 'run', 'Aniston', 'most', 'consistent', 'six', 'can', 'see', 'Aniston', 'films', 'OBJECT', 'OF', 'MY', 'AFFECTION', 'RUMOUR', 'IT', 'BRUCE', 'ALMIGHTY', 'name', 'few', 'Perry', 'co-starred', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', '2002', 'Paramount', 'comedy', 'SERVING', 'SARA', 'Schwimmer', 'starred', '1998', 'KISSING', 'A', 'FOOL', 'Kudrow', 'co-starred', 'Mira', 'Sorvino', 'ROMY', 'MICHELLE', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'REUNION', 'Also', 'least', 'most', 'six', 'have', 'guest-hosted', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'various', 'occasions', 'six', 'actors', 'will', 'long', 'be', 'remembered', 'will', 'eventually', 'receive', 'stars', 'Hollywood', 'Walk', 'Fame']",N/A

It is well worth it.  You get all 10 seasons in slim cases, 4 discs per case.  Each disc is labeled with the season & disc number, so there is no confusion as with the earlier complete series release.  Even though Friends is rerun daily on Nick at Nite & TBS, I highly recommend buying this series because you can watch the show whenever you want.  Moreover, it comes in a beautiful box as pictured above, and the receiver of your gift will always be greatful to you.  All Friends fans should buy this set for Christmas.

Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[1, 2]","Thanks to my x fiance, who owns this set and used to have regular Friends nights with her sister when we were together, I began to slowly develop an interest in the show. True I didn't join the ladies as often as I now wish I had, but what I did see still made me laugh. So I purchased a copy for myself with my new Best Buy card when I was at the store this last weekend searching for a cordless phone. The set of course contains all ten seasons in a largeish box. The box contains a series of small cardboard books, for lack of a better term, each page of which contains two disks, one on the front and one on the back. Of course the potential for damage to the disks is there but if you remove and insert them with reasonable care this can be minimized and/or avoided. I haven't had any problems at any rate, and as I'm totally blind and therefore had to make several attempts to find the first season this is a good thing. It took me a few minutes.The show itself is funny and, in my opinion at least, much cleaner than what's considered commedy these days. Oh it has its share of sexual humor but it's clear that the creators made an effort to keep that within reasonable limits. And I suddenly find I can't get enough of the theme song, a tune which often used to annoy the hell out of me when the show would come on TV. It's funny how that sometimes happens. Needless to say so far I find it well worth the 200+ dollars I spent on it.",5,I never used to be into the show but...,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,1441,"['Thanks', 'x', 'fiance', 'who', 'set', 'used', 'have', 'regular', 'Friends', 'nights', 'sister', 'when', 'were', 'together', 'began', 'slowly', 'develop', 'interest', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'join', 'ladies', 'as', 'often', 'now', 'wish', 'had', 'what', 'did', 'see', 'still', 'made', 'laugh', 'So', 'purchased', 'copy', 'myself', 'new', 'Best', 'Buy', 'card', 'when', 'was', 'store', 'last', 'weekend', 'searching', 'cordless', 'phone', 'set', 'course', 'contains', 'ten', 'seasons', 'largeish', 'box', 'box', 'series', 'small', 'cardboard', 'books', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'page', 'two', 'disks', 'one', 'front', 'one', 'back', 'course', 'potential', 'damage', 'disks', 'there', 'remove', 'insert', 'reasonable', 'care', 'can', 'be', 'minimized', 'and/or', 'avoided', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'problems', 'rate', ""'m"", 'totally', 'blind', 'therefore', 'had', 'make', 'several', 'attempts', 'find', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'thing', 'took', 'few', 'minutes.The', 'show', 'funny', 'opinion', 'least', 'much', 'cleaner', 'what', 'considered', 'commedy', 'days', 'Oh', 'share', 'sexual', 'humor', 'clear', 'creators', 'made', 'effort', 'keep', 'reasonable', 'limits', 'suddenly', 'find', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'theme', 'song', 'tune', 'often', 'used', 'annoy', 'hell', 'when', 'show', 'would', 'come', 'TV', 'funny', 'how', 'Needless', 'say', 'so', 'far', 'find', 'well', '200+', 'dollars', 'spent']",N/A
928167,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000AM4PBS,calvinnme,"[529, 547]","Since I notice all the questions seem to concern the logistics of the set, that is the main thing I will address in this review, since you would have to be a resident of another planet to not know the story behind the series ""Friends"". Suffice it to say it is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the ""post-college adolescent phase"" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you ""settle down"" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.As for logistics, this collection fits in a sturdy red box that's less than a foot long. There are 40 DVDs containing 236 episodes that can be found inside. The Friends set just has two pieces of the box that comes together. Flipping the top up exposes the guts of the set consisting of 6 books, with one for each Friend. Thus there are only 6 books to hold the 10 seasons. Each book has a picture of the Friend, a number (1-6), and the episodes you can find in each case. The books flip open from the top, and each disc has its own pouch in the double-sided pages. Every disc has a different photo of the Friend, and they're all inserted into the pouches so that the photo is visible as you flip through the book. The disc number and episode numbers are also visible. The contents of the discs are the same as the previous sets, but they have new artwork.Besides the packaging, there's just one thing to note for this release, that being the episode guide booklet. This 60 page booklet lists every episode with its synopsis and the disc you can find it on. Of course, the bonus material is mentioned along with the disc it can be found on, and the bonus features include 25 documentaries. You'll also get the original treatment for the series written by David Crane and Marta Kauffman. The booklet, which is as wide as the box, can be found behind the DVD books.As for screen format, it's full screen, which is what Friends was filmed in. The full screen ratio is 4:3, which is the same as 1.33:1. You can record in wide screen and chop off parts of the frame to make it fit a traditional 4:3 TV, which is what is done with full screen editions of movies. However, you can't add stuff to a frame that was recorded in 4:3 and make it widescreen.There's very little of value here for someone who already has the season 1-10 boxes, and the book with the episode information is just an upgraded version of the booklets that come with the season sets. If you don't already own the 10 seasons then this is an easy way to buy the show since it is a lot cheaper than buying each set individually.

At this point, Monica, Phoebe and Ross all live alone, while Chandler and Joey live together. Monica's old school friend Rachel enters Central Perk wearing a wedding dress, having just run away from her wedding to Barry Farber and needing somewhere to go. She moves in with Monica, gets a job as a waitress at Central Perk, and struggles to work for a living, having previously lived a rich life.Ross finds his ex-wife Carol is pregnant with his child. In the penultimate episode of the season, she gives birth to a boy, named Ben, who is subsequently raised by Carol and her lover, Susan.In the pilot, Ross reveals he had a crush on Rachel in high school, and we see (unbeknownst to Rachel) that he still has feelings for her. Throughout the season, he fails to make his feelings known to her, and eventually Chandler and Joey persuade him to move on. In the last episode, on Rachel's birthday, Ross leaves for a paleontological trip to China - while he is gone, Chandler accidentally reveals to Rachel that Ross is in love with her. Rachel eventually decides she would like to start a romantic relationship with Ross, and goes to meet him at the airport when he returns from China, unaware that he is getting off the plane with another woman.[edit]Season twoRoss is unaware that Rachel now has feelings for him, and has started a relationship with a paleontologist named Julie whom he knew at grad school and has met again while in China. Rachel is very unhappy about this and makes attempts to sabotage the relationship, eg: when Ross wants to consummate his relationship with Julie, Rachel tells him women find nothing sexier than a man who doesn't want to have sex.Rachel later goes on a date with another man, where she gets very drunk and leaves a message on Ross's answer machine saying she is over him. Next morning, Ross comes to Monica and Rachel's apartment and plays back the message with their phone. Rachel is forced to admit that she likes Ross, causing Ross to get very confused over his own feelings. He later comes to Rachel at Central Perk and angrily tells her she shouldn't have told him, and he is now over her, but after leaving, he comes back and they kiss passionately. Ross is unable to choose between Rachel and Julie - in the process of making a list of pros and cons for both women, he decides he really loves Rachel, and breaks up with Julie. Unfortunately, Rachel discovers the list of pros and cons he made, becomes angry with Ross and rejects him.However, later in the season, the group watches a video of Monica and Rachel getting ready for their high school prom. In the video, it looks like Rachel's date isn't going to show, so Ross's parents persuade him to take her instead. But just as Ross is about to, Rachel's date arrives and they leave together. Rachel is touched by this, and decides to start dating Ross after all.Joey gets a high profile acting job as Dr Drake Ramoray on the soap Days Of Our Lives, and earns enough money to move into his own apartment. Left on his own, Chandler gets a new roommate called Eddie, who turns out to be insane. When Joey states in an interview that he writes his own lines on Days Of Our Lives, the show's writers are offended and kill off his character. With no income for his lavish spending, Joey moves back into Chandler's apartment. Chandler had been struggling to get Eddie to move out due to his mental problems; Eddie continuously forgot that Chandler had asked him to leave. Chandler and Joey solve the problem by moving out Eddie's things, changing the locks, and pretending they don't know Eddie when he comes to the door - Eddie assumes he has the wrong apartment and leaves.Phoebe finds she has a half brother called Frank, from her father's side.For a period, Monica goes out with Richard Burke, a friend of her parents' who is significantly older than her. They become very close, but break up in the last episode when Richard tells her he doesn't want to have children with her, having already had them with his ex-wife.[edit]Season threeRachel quits her job at Central Perk and tries to get one in the fashion industry. She meets a man named Mark who gets her a job in Bloomingdale's, but Ross becomes convinced Mark has ulterior motives, and becomes increasingly jealous. Tension between Ross and Rachel culminates on their anniversary, when Rachel is too busy at work to go to dinner with Ross. Instead, Ross brings some food to her work, but gets in the way and she orders him to leave. Back home, the two have an argument which ends in Rachel suggesting they take a break.Afterward, Ross goes for a drink with Chandler and Joey. Both he and Rachel independently decide to resolve their differences, but when Ross calls Rachel, Mark is there to check if Rachel is all right. Having heard him over the phone, Ross assumes the worst and hangs up. Feeling depressed, he ends up sleeping with a woman named Chloe. He tries to resume his relationship with Rachel without telling her, but she finds out, and after a prolonged argument, they break up.However, towards the end of the season, Rachel becomes upset when Ross starts dating a woman named Bonnie. In the final episode, the group goes on a beach trip, so Phoebe can meet up with a woman (also named Phoebe) who has information about her family. While at the beach, Bonnie unexpectedly turns up. Rachel is unhappy and persuades Bonnie to shave her head so Ross will be less attracted to her. Ross and Rachel argue about this and start to feel like they still love each other. The episode ends with Ross standing between Rachel and Bonnie's bedrooms, picking one, and going in.[edit]Season fourThe season begins with Ross entering one room and finding both Rachel and Bonnie. Ross decides to get back together with Rachel, and breaks up with Bonnie. Rachel writes Ross a letter of her feelings about them getting back together. It turns out to be a request that Ross take full responsibility for everything that went wrong last time, which he finds he cannot do, and they quickly break up again.While still at the beach, Phoebe learns the older Phoebe is actually her real mother. Phoebe tells Ursula, who makes it sound like she knew all along. Ursula produces their mother's ""suicide note"" (which she really wrote herself) which says ""Dear Phoebe and Ursula, I love you both very much. P.S. Your birth mother lives in Montauk.""Phoebe agrees to be a surrogate mother for her half brother Frank and his infertile wife Alice. Frank and Alice's embryos, conceived by in vitro fertilization, are implanted in Phoebe's uterus and she becomes pregnant with triplets.Chandler meets a girl named Kathy who originally dates Joey. The latter two, who are classmates in acting class break-up after Kathy kissed Chandler while Joey was outside the apartment. This made Joey angry and as punishment, Chandler was made to stay in a box for several hours to show him [Joey] how much he wants him to be his [Chandler's] friend again. Joey eventually forgives him and Chandler starts going out with Kathy. The relationship however does not last long as Chandler suspects that Kathy is sleeping with a fellow cast member after watching one of her plays. This actually happens after their first fight and they break up.Chandler & Joey and Monica & Rachel compete in a quiz about each other, put together by Ross, to decide which of them knows more about the other two. The two teams make a bet - if Monica and Rachel win, Chandler and Joey will give up their pets chick and duck, but if Chandler and Joey win, they get Monica and Rachel's apartment. In the end, Chandler and Joey win, and swap apartments with Monica and Rachel. They live like this for a few episodes, then Monica and Rachel try to trade New York Knicks tickets to the boys in exchange for their apartment. Chandler doesn't think it's a fair trade, and they draw cards, with the winner getting the apartment and the tickets. Chandler and Joey win again, but when they get back after the Knicks game, they find the girls have moved all the guys' things back into their original apartment, and moved back into theirs. The boys agree to let living arrangements return to normal when, in exchange, Monica and Rachel kiss each other for one minute in front of them.Ross meets a British woman named Emily and starts dating her. When it is time for Emily to go back to England, she and Ross don't want to leave each other and they decide to get married. In the last episode, the group travels to London for the wedding - except Phoebe, who is too pregnant, and Rachel, who doesn't want to see Ross get married. At the wedding rehearsal dinner, Monica becomes depressed because she's not married, and a drunken man thinks she's Ross' mother. Chandler comforts her and they end up sleeping together.Rachel realizes she still loves Ross and decides to go to London and tell him. When she gets there, she sees him with Emily and decides it wouldn't be right to mess things up for him. The wedding goes ahead, but comes to an abrupt halt when Ross says ""I take thee, Rachel"" instead of ""I take thee, Emily"".[edit]Season fiveRoss and Emily's wedding continues after Ross' faux pas and they are married, but at the reception, Emily argues angrily with Ross and disappears. After everyone has returned to New York, Rachel tells Ross she still loves him and then starts laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation, since he is now married. They both decide to forget it. Emily eventually calls Ross from England and tells him that she will only give the marriage a chance if he promises he will never see Rachel again. Ross agrees, but Emily continues to make unreasonable demands to keep him away from Rachel, such as moving to another apartment. Eventually, he decides the marriage won't work if Emily doesn't trust him and they divorce.Ross has already sublet his old apartment at this point and can't get it back since the leasee is Emily's cousin, so he lives with Chandler and Joey for a period until he gets a new apartment for himself. He later loses his job at a museum when he gets angry at his boss for eating his Thanksgiving leftovers sandwich.In the 100th episode (third of the season), Phoebe gives birth to triplets - a boy named Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls named Leslie and Chandler (they had originally thought it would be two boys and a girl, and Phoebe was going to name one boy after Chandler). Phoebe tries to keep one after becoming attached to them, but finds out that Frank and Alice are unwilling to give up a child.After sleeping together in London, Chandler and Monica feel attracted to each other and continue an intimate relationship in secret. Joey finds out about it, but keeps it a secret for them. Rachel then finds out, but after she tells Monica and Monica denies it, Rachel pretends to be oblivious. Phoebe is the next to find out. However, rather than keeping it a secret or pretending to be oblivious, she plays mind games with Chandler by pretending she is attracted to him. When Chandler and Monica realize she knows about them, Chandler pretends he is attracted to Phoebe, but eventually confesses he is in love with Monica. Ross finds out shortly afterwards, and Chandler and Monica's relationship becomes public.Rachel gets a new job at Ralph Lauren.Towards the end of the season, Joey gets the lead in a movie, but travels to Las Vegas to find production has shut down due to lack of money. In the last episode, Chandler, Monica and Phoebe travel to Las Vegas to see him (he has stayed there waiting for production to restart, but has been lying to them, telling them he is filming for the movie), with Ross and Rachel following them later. They find Joey working as a Roman guard in the Caesar's Palace hotel lobby. On the plane there, Ross draws a mustache on Rachel's face with a felt tip pen - Rachel can't get it off and doesn't want to leave her hotel room, so Ross stays with her. They both get very drunk and Rachel draws on his face in return.Chandler and Monica decide to get married in a Las Vegas chapel, but just before they do, they encounter Ross and Rachel, still drunk, who have just wed at the same chapel.[edit]Season sixIn the opening credits of the first episode of this season, every name is followed by the word ""Arquette"", in reference to Courteney Cox' marriage to David Arquette (and subsequent name change to ""Courteney Cox Arquette"").After finding out that they are now married, Ross and Rachel agree to get an annulment, but Ross doesn't want to have been divorced three times and lies to Rachel, telling her he has had the marriage annulled when he actually hasn't. Rachel eventually learns the truth and forces Ross to go ahead with the annulment, but they are unable to get one as Rachel has added humiliating misinformation about Ross on the form, and they are forced to file for divorce.Ross gets a new job teaching paleontology at New York University (NYU).Despite his divorce record, Ross dates two people: Jill Green, Rachel's sister and Elizabeth Stevens, a student in one of his NYU classes. Jill comes into the city to goes to Rachel to help her look for a job after her father takes away her credit card and in her job hunt, there seems to be a spark with Ross when one of the items she bought at a store isn't confiscated by Rachel. Neither one was planning to ask the other out but when Rachel accidentally says it's OK, Jill asks Ross out and he agrees. But Rachel's true feelings about her sister and ex-boyfriend started to be known to both and she forces Ross to stop seeing Jill. Meanwhile, with Elizabeth, Ross discovers that she is the one who rated him a ""hottie"" in her evaluation form. They start dating despite a university policy that makes it illegal for a teacher to date a student and threats from Ross' colleagues and Elizabeth's father that Ross will be fired for violating that policy. Ross tries to impress Elizabeth's father, Paul but is usually unsuccessful. They break up after Ross figures that there is no future between them.Chandler and Monica decide it's too soon for them to get married, and decide to move in together instead. Chandler moves into Monica's apartment, Rachel moves in with Phoebe, and Joey is left on his own.After Chandler moves out, Joey gets a sexy female roommate named Janine. After a few weeks of carefully avoiding the subject, the two start dating, but the relationship doesn't last long when Janine tells Joey she doesn't like Monica and Chandler. Joey's attempts to make them get along only make the situation worse and Janine moves out.Another interesting aspect of season 6 is Joey's money and career crisis. First Joey, not getting an acting job in a long time loses his insurance. He gets it back by getting a part in a movie which he acted as a dying father. Joey finds it very difficult to keep up with the bills living on his own and as a result of Janine moving out, Joey's telephone and cable service has been cutoff and desperate for money, Joey gets a job at Central Perk. He later tries other ways to get money like participate in a study for identical twins but isn't successful as he and his partner, Tony, aren't identical twins. Also, Joey gets a job as the lead actor on a new TV Series named 'Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.', which revolves around a detective and his robot sidekick. Joey promptly quits his job at Central Perk.Later in the season, a fire wrecks Phoebe and Rachel's apartment. It is assumed that Phoebe's candles started the fire, so while Rachel moves in with Chandler and Monica, Phoebe moves into the less savory conditions of Joey's apartment. However, when the firemen find the fire was actually started by Rachel leaving a hair straightener switched on in the bathroom, Phoebe and Rachel swap. Rachel finds living with Joey quite enjoyable, while Phoebe is annoyed by Monica's constant attention and obsession with cleanliness.Towards the end of the season, Chandler plans to propose to Monica. In the final episode, he fails to propose at a restaurant when Richard, Monica's ex-boyfriend, appears. Later, Richard meets Monica at her workplace and tells her he still loves her. She considers going back to Richard when Chandler pretends he isn't interested in marriage (so she'll be surprised when he proposes) but Joey explains the situation to her. She decides to surprise him with a proposal and he says yes.[edit]Season sevenThe season mainly focuses on Monica and Chandler's wedding plans from the selection of the maid of honour to the wardrobe to the seating arrangement. It was almost thrown in jeopardy when Monica's parents spent all the money from the Monica Wedding fund to acquire a beach house. Chandler agreed to give some money.Rachel gets a promotion in Ralph Lauren and one of its perks includes hiring a new assistant. She hires Tag Jones (as opposed to an experienced applicant), who she has a crush on from the moment she meets him. They got together on Thanksgiving but broke up during her birthday.Phoebe and Rachel's apartment is restored after the fire. Phoebe moves back in on her own, while Rachel continues living with Joey.'Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.' is a ratings failure and is quickly cancelled, but luckily for Joey he is offered his job back on Days Of Our Lives.In the final episode, it is time for Chandler and Monica's wedding, but the night before, Chandler gets cold feet and disappears. While he is gone, Phoebe finds a positive pregnancy test in Monica's bathroom, and assumes Monica is pregnant. Phoebe and Ross find Chandler at his office and persuade him to come back, but Chandler overhears Phoebe and Rachel talking about Monica's ""pregnancy"" and disappears again. He quickly returns on his own, however, deciding that a baby wouldn't be so bad. Chandler and Monica get married, but when Chandler tells Monica he knows about the baby, she says she isn't pregnant, and it wasn't her pregnancy test that Phoebe found. As the episode ends, it is hinted that it is actually Rachel who is pregnant.[edit]Season eightIt is confirmed that Rachel is pregnant, and in the second episode, the group finds out that Ross is the father (we learn they secretly slept together before Chandler and Monica's wedding). Her pregnancy becomes the central focal point of the eighth season.Ross met Mona at the wedding and went out with her for a few months but they broke up because of complications arising from his impending fatherhood with Rachel's child.As Rachel and Joey continue living together, Joey starts to develop feelings for her. Feeling that Ross is missing out on his fatherly duties, Joey reluctantly suggests that Rachel move in with Ross, and she does so. Joey later reveals his feelings to Rachel, who politely rejects him.In the last episode, Rachel goes into labor, and while she's in the hospital Ross's mother approaches him with a ring to give to Rachel. Ross demures, saying it's far too complicated, but keeps the ring in his coat pocket. After Rachel gives birth to their daughter, Emma, Joey goes in to see how Rachel is doing and accidentally knocks over Ross's coat. The engagement ring falls out, and Joey bends down to pick it up. Rachel, seeing Joey on one knee with an engagement ring, thinks that he's proposing to her, and says that she'll marry him.Also in the last episode, Monica and Chandler decide to try for a baby of their own.[edit]Season nineRoss, Rachel, and Emma continue living together until they have a argument about their current relationship.

Phoebe takes her boyfriend David (whom she first met in the first season and got back together with in the previous episode) and Joey takes his girlfriend Charlie (another professor of paleontology whom Ross had welcomed to the city). Monica learns David is planning to top Mike by proposing to Phoebe, and calls Mike to tell him to get back together with Phoebe. Mike originally doesn't want to intervene, but later comes to Barbados and tells Phoebe he loves her and wants to marry her. Phoebe rejects Mike's proposal, but still resumes her relationship with him, letting David down gently.Joey and Charlie break up when they decide they have too little in common, and Joey subsequently learns Rachel has feelings for him. He originally decides not to act on it. Meanwhile, Charlie feels she still likes Ross, and they kiss. Joey sees them doing so, changes his mind about Rachel, and goes to her room and kisses her.[edit]Season tenJoey and Rachel's intimate relationship only lasts for the first three episodes of the season, at which point they find that since their relationship has been platonic for so long, they are too uncomfortable getting physical with each other, and decide to be just friends again.Ross and Charlie on the other hand went through a relationship that started in Barbados and it went well until she decides to get back together with an ex-boyfriend who administers a grant review Ross hopes to get.As the season goes on, Mike proposes to Phoebe again, and they get married in a later episode.

Though Friends cracks me up, episode after episode, it's not really the humor that I find drawing to the show, it's the love that the characters have towards each other.

928180,AZDVOFC2MTIM5,B000AM4PBS,DEAN M. Dent,"[59, 84]","Friends(1994-2004) has not only became NBC's benchmark show for nearly a decade,but an endearing, and somewhat screwball look at late 20/early 30 somethings gained even more new fans today from syndication and DVD sets.Unlike most shows in their first seasons,Friends felt like it was at it's peak,althought it was only the beginning.Thanks to brilliant writing that doesn't talk down to most 20 something at the time(although the creators were mid 30's plus).Another contributing factor were the distinctive characters themselves,Including the wound up,yet nuturing Monica Gellar(Courtney Cox&lt;Arquette>),her brilliant,yet nerdy brother Ross(David Schwimmer),The spoiled,yet endearing Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston)who becomes Monica's roommate after becoming a runaway bride,The sarcastic,uptight Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry),The dopey,loveable out of work actor Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc)and the sweet,yet ditzy new age hippie Phoebe Buffay(Lisa Kudrow).The best episodes include The One with the Thumb(Chandler's Smoking),The One with the Blackout,The One with the Boobies,The One with the Candy Hearts(featuring Chandler's loveably annoying on/off girlfriend Janice&lt;Maggie Wheeler>)The One with all the Poker,and The One where Rachel Finds Out(..about Ross's feeling for her).After a phenomenal debut season like Friends,most shows coast on it's success and start to slip in quality.But Friends would only get better with each successive season.Changes were in the air for the group.Joey joined the cast of Days Of Our Lives as the ill fated Dr.Drake Ramoray,we meet Phoebe's ex husband (Steve Zahn),Chandler gets a new roommate(Adam Goldberg)who turns out to be a psycho,and Monica falls in love with her dad's best friend Dr. Richard Burke(Tom Selleck).The seasons driving force is the beginning of the on/off again relationship between Rachel and Ross.Many classic episodes came from this season including The One where Heckles Dies,...the Baby on the Bus,...where Ross Finds Out,...the List,...where Ross and Rachel ... You Know,...where Dr. Ramoray Dies and ...Two Parties.But also from season two was The One With The Prom Video,considered the greatest Friends episode ever.Not only are we treated to a plot involving a hidious bracelet Joey gives to Chandler,but an old video of Rachel and Monica's prom.Giving a glimpse into to past at an overwieght Monica,a pre-nose job Rachel,and an extremely dorky Ross(""Looking Good Mr. Kotter).The most surprising moment is after the viewing of the video, one of those special moments why Friends beloved by it's many fans.The Third season of Friends would always be remembered as the year Ross and Rachel broke up,showing that the writers would shake up the show to keep it fresh and on it's feet.In this season,the ups and downs of love effects the other characters.Monica's heartbreak after the break up with Richard,Chandler's short term relationship with Janice,Lothario Joey falling for his play's co-star(Dina Meyer),and even Phoebe reunites with her musical partner(E.G. Daily).The best episodes includes The One with The Princess Leia Fantasy,..Where No One's Ready(Going Commando),..with the Flashback,...the Giant Poking Device,...the Football, .. where Chandler can't Remember which Sister,..without the Ski Trip,and..Ultimate Fighting Champion.The unofficial two part The One where Ross and Rachel Take a Break/ the Morning After was the high point of the season in which Ross and Rachel take a break,only to break up when Ross spends the night with Chloe,""The copy girl"".The episode includes some of the funniest moments as well as the most heartbreaking.Although relationships were still an issue in the fourth season of Friends,Thrown into the mix were Chandler's cure for Monica's Jellyfish Stings,Phoebe Uterus,an apartment switch,Chandler's Thanksgiving inside a box,Ross's musical ""sound"",Wedding dresses,free adult TV and Joey's ballroom dancings takes the show to hilarious levels.The season sees both Ross and Rachel make up,then shortly break-up(""WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!)only to find themselves in new relationships,Chandler fall in love with Joey's new girlfriend,Phoebe agreeing to carry her brother Frank Jr.'s triplets,and Monica and Chandler finally consumating their relationship.The best episodes include The One with the Jellyfish,..with the Dirty Girl,..Chandler Crosses the Line/In A Box,.with the Embryos,..Ross's Wedding(I take thee Rachel&lt;!!!!>).The fourth season cliffhanger (Ross saying Rachel's name in his vows,as well as the Monica/Chandler plot) promises a great following season .Season five was somewhat of a transitional time on Friends as the Chandler/Monica thing heats up as well as the actors finally settling into their character that would continue to this day,usually a parody into themselves.Ross gets in over his head thanks to his shrewish new wife,Emily and his sandwich,Phoebe gives birth to her brother's triplets,Joey lands a role in an independent movie,and Rachel's career moves brings her up in the world,while relationships get her down.The best episodes include The One with all the Kissing,..The Hundredth Episode,..the Thanksgiving Flashbacks,...all the Resolutions,...where Everybody Finds Out,...the Ride Along,and The One in Vegas.Even with some signs of wear on the show,Friends fifth season is a lot better than most sitcoms of it's timeThe sixth season of Friends was a turning point in the show as the character grow up and go through various transitions.Even though the sixth doesn't measure up to past seasons,the show is still as reliable on laughs.Monica and Chandler move in together,jarring the winning chemestry a bit.The winning pairing of former roommates Joey and Chandler takes on a new direction.Ross struggles with his third marriage(to Rachel),and Phoebe is still the only reliable constant.The classic episodes include The One where Phoebe Runs,....Ross's Teeth,....the Routine,....Unagi,...and....That Could Have Been.Even after seasons five and six's dip in the show's quality,Friends sixth season still maintained the TV viewer love of this classic ensemble.Season Seven of Friends is considered the weakest ever compared to the quality of the earlier seasons.It was the year leading up to Chandler and Monica's wedding.But with some weak plots, and Matthew Perry's fluctuating physical appearence, the show seemed on the verge of fatigue.Despite such shortcomings, the season boasted such episodes as ...The One with Phoebe's Cookies,... the Engagement Picture,...all the Candy,...all the Cheesecakes,...they all Turn Thirty,...Ross and Monica's Cousin,and Monica and Chandler's Wedding.Just when you think season seven ends with two shark jumping elements (a wedding and pregnancy), The following season bounces back in a way unexpected for any eighth season (if a show even gets that far).Although season seven was the weakest in terms of Friends other seasons, it was still alot funnier than most shows on the air at the time.Season Eight has the show bouncing back and becoming more sucessful than ever.After ending with a wedding, and a pregnancy(two definate Jump The Shark moments),the show uses these two plots to good effects as Monica and Chandler deal with their first year as a married couple, and Rachel carries Ross's baby.Adding to the mix is Joey falling in love with Rachel.Premiering after 9/11,the eighth season of Friends took on a deeper meaning to it's fan as it kept up the laughs as the nationed kept up hope in the wake of disaster.Season Nine of Friends was originally suppose to be the final season,but was extended for another.The season dealt with Ross and Rachel's new role as parents to baby Emma,Chandler and Monica's attempt to have their own, Phoebe meeting her soon to be husband Mike (Paul Rudd),and Joey dealing with his feelings for Rachel.The classic episodes include The One With-Where No One Proposes,...Phoebe's Birthday Dinner,...Rachel's Other Sister(with Christina Applegate),...The Lottery,...,In Barbados (featuring Aisha Tyler as Charlie).Whereas most shows are creatively bankrupt by it's tenth season(with the exception of the Simpsons),Friends manages to have some inspired moments although it's obvious this show has long since seen better days.Aside from the season only having 18 episodes,the season's biggest flaw is knowing the end is near, and wrapping up things in a tidy package.The best episode (obviously) is the Finale whereas we know the fate of Ross and Rachal,seeing it unfold is one of the most inspired moments of the entire series.Other classic episodes include TOW...Ross'Tan,...The Late Thanksgiving,...Phoebe's Wedding,and ...The Goodbye Party.After ten years, 236 episodes, and more classic moments than any show could have given us,Friends will live on in not only Re-runs,DVDs and spinoffs(Joey), but in the hearts of those that it has touched.",5,The entire feast of Friends,1123977600,"08 14, 2005",2005,8872,"['Friends', '1994-2004', 'not',

928181,A1TV78JBIUL244,B000AM4PBS,"Dell ""Chris""","[6, 9]","""Friends"" is my favorite TV show ever. And judging by its success, popularity and longetivity, the best show too. It is well-written and perfectly acted by a fantastic ensembel cast. This was the show that introduced us to Ms. Jennifer Aniston, the most beautiful woman in the world (IMHO). Sadly, now that she is available, I'm married. (Kidding!)Dave Schwimmer cracks me up. They all do, in fact. Especially Lisa Kudrow, the classic dumb blonde.

Just one example, season 7, The One Where Rosita Dies, the opening after-credits scene in the coffee house is cut. The conversation with Ross and Chandler about how Chandler will have to introduce Ross as his brother-in-law rather than his friend, and the end of the scene where Ross calls his dad about the house and asks ""who did you leave a message with"" and Chandler taps on the window and says ""sorry"" and runs off. Other scenes are truncated all throughout the episode and at the epilogue when Joey and Rachel are sitting in the new chair contentedly and Joey says ""mmmm???"" and Rachel says ""mm-mmm"" that part's cut out, too.

Interestingly, I didn't start watching the show until it was in its 9th season. I dismissed it as a ""chick show,"" but when I finally started catching re-runs when I was in college, it had me rolling! It was right at this point that they began releasing the full seasons on DVD. So every time a new season was released on DVD I went right out and bought it. The first time that I saw many of these episodes (probably 80% of the series) was on DVD. For those of you that don't know this, the DVDs actually contained longer episodes than what had been originally broadcast on NBC. Each 20-minute episode contained another 2 or 3 minutes of dialogue/story. And it wasn't excessive stuff that needed to be cut, many of my favorite lines in the show were in these extended scenes. In fact, when I go back and watch re-runs of the show now I can't believe how much of it is missing. I still love my DVDs though, special features and all! But when I watch them now on my 47"" TV I notice that they look pretty rough. There's lots of pixelation and fuzziness, and the episodes aren't formatted for widescreen. Certain channels have been showing the episodes in HD and they look gorgeous! I thought to myself, ""I would actually buy the whole series over again on Blu-Ray if it had all the extended episodes and bonus features from the standard DVD set.""When I learned that ""Friends"" was coming to Blu-Ray I was so excited, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Then I learned that this Blu-Ray boxed set would not contain the previously released extended episodes, but would instead have them as they appeared in the original NBC broadcast. Warner Home Video's reason for this is as follows: ""The extended cuts were special versions created for the DVDs and no longer exist in a form that could be used for a Blu-ray release.""  ...What does THAT mean? You can transfer the short episodes but not the long ones? That makes no sense! Whatever was done to clean up the episodes that they've been showing on TV in HD, they can do for the extended episodes. I think someone just got lazy and decided this would be good enough. While I desperately want my favorite show in HD, I will not fork out over $200 for an inferior product! I know these (extended) episodes like the back of my hand, and I won't be able to truly enjoy the show with the absence of so many great scenes and lines. I'd rather watch bad resolution ""Friends"" in its entirety than watch a cleaned up abridged version. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it's still an awesome show, and for casual fans this might be enough. However, for fans like me this will simply not do. This reminds me of George Lucas only releasing the versions of Star Wars that nobody likes, or Peter Jackson putting out The Lord Of The Rings trilogy on Blu-Ray but waiting over a year to put out the extended versions.

928208,A29CK3R8EIDEJG,B000AM4PBS,JJ Stark,"[18, 42]","My family & I are HUGE fans of FRIENDS. We own all ten seasons as well as every other Spec Ed DVD collection, and watch them often. Before anyone complains about my ""2 star"" rating and/or accuses me of whining about its release (after we bought each season separately), let me explain the reason behind my rating......I'm not giving this a 2-star rating because I'm mad about having bought all ten seasons separately.  I'm giving the PRODUCT 2 stars as I don't really see any product here at all - This collection consists of the same nine seasons previously released, all boxed up together, along with the recently released Season 10. There isn't any new material or special ""extras"" included with this collection, which in my opinion, makes it a waste of money and a missed opportunity. Why the rush to release this series collection? Why not release Season 10 this year and wait a year before releasing the entire series with added features and bonus material? This way, fans of FRIENDS would still have had something to look forward to.  Now that it's all been released (Season 10, as well as the series collection), fans have nothing new to add to their collections.  There was so much that could have been added to this set - additional outtakes, deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews, music, fashion, a special ed book, etc. Not even the one hour retrospect, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, that was originally shown the night of the finale is included in this collection (or any individual season for that matter). Looks like fans will never be able to own that special on any DVD collection, which makes me so mad! I would so rather go back & watch that one hour special again & again, than watch all ten openings from every season (which was included on the Series Finale DVD)! Who's bright idea was that?!?I'm sure it will be nice to have all 10 seasons, packaged together in one boxed set. But the only thing new here is the Special Ed. Collector's box that the set comes packaged in, which is made available for its own separate purchase in the Season 10 collection. It would have made more sense to release Season 10 this year, with only season 10 bloopers & outtakes, THE ONE BEFORE THE LAST ONE, and the other bonus features that are included. Then wait a year and release the Series Collection, with an added bonus disc could that could have included bloopers & outtakes from all ten seasons, as well as other added material & extras - perhaps, the cast's appearances on the Oprah show (from the show's beginning and the end) as well as their appearance on the Tonight Show from the night the finale aired; a look back at how each of the cast members/characters changed & grew throughout the years and what each one has been doing since the series ended; all of the big-name guest stars, the various sets & scene locations, fashions & costumes throughout the series; maybe even a special ed book. There are so many things that could have been added, had the producers just taken their time and really thought about what the fans would want.Earlier this summer, when it was announced that all 6 seasons of Sex & the City were being released, I thought, ""That's kinda strange. Most fans have already purchased all 6 seasons, why would they want to buy them all over again?"" And when I heard that the set was going to cost $300 - well, I thought, ""That's just ridiculous!"" Each individual season costs $20-30 (approx. $200 for all 6 seasons). Why would anyone want to spend $100 more just to own the full set in one box? But then I found out that the Full Series Collection would have lots of ""extras"" not found on the individual season discs, including a deluxe velvet box and a small ""companion"" book. For the average fan, it's probably not worth it to spend the extra money for whatever the extras are, but for the serious fan and/or collector - that's a big deal. Now it made sense to me, and will hopefully be worth the additional cost. But this isn't true about the Full Series Collection of Friends. There are no special extras in this set. The ""One with all Ten Seasons"" is packaged with the same exact discs sold individually as Seasons 1-10. What a waste!I just think that this is a missed opportunity to give fans of FRIENDS something ""special"". If you're going to release a Spec Collector's Edition of all ten seasons, then there should be some added material, bonus features or something that generates a little excitement and makes the fans want to run right out and buy it. It's really a shame, because as big as FRIENDS was and how many fans of the show there still are, there is so much more that could have been included and given to fans - maybe WB & the producers of FRIENDS should have borrowed some ideas from HBO and the producers of Sex & the City. I bet the Sex collection easily outsells the FRIENDS collection just because of all the added material.",2,This Could Have Been So Much Better!,1124755200,"08 23, 2005",2005,4886,"['family', 'are',

Now that the series ended a few years ago, I can look back and see how it iverall was one of the best series in television history.  First, I must commend the excellent writing that each show had.  Funny, sometimes sad, but always entertaining and interesting.  The actors, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Anistron, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox make up this great crew.  I can't give details  becuase it would take to long for this review.  However, from an overall perspective, you can see how the cast matured over the years, how everything fell into place in the lives of the characters, and the great twists of the plot truely made this a must see every Thursday Night.

I was to young to watch it when it was on TV.  But after seeing reruns, I had to have the series set.  My mom got it for me this Christmas and I was super excited.  I decided to open it a few days ago, to see if any of the DVDs were scratched.  Well, I did not even get to open it, I noticed that the left past of the lid was ripped all the way up.  As a collector, I couldn't let this be.  So, Amazon told my mom to send it back and they would send her another one.  I got my other set yesterday.  I opened it today and I was so upset.  Most of the DVDs have marks all over then.  Be it a little mark, or a cluster of marks.  My mom told me to watch them all and see if they worked.  I informed her that there are over 200 episodes.  So, Amazon gave her a partial refund.  I don't think it was really enough.  I mean, I have no clue how many of these DVDs will even play.  I was reading online and it seems the UK version is better.  So NOW I have to either get a or set my DVD player to multi region and get the 15th anniversary edition from the UK amazon.  It is a shame.  Such a great show left stained by the fault of bad packaging.  If you want to get this, I would say be ready to have some DVDs that have marks.  I am not saying they will not play, but to me, not knowing is almost as bad as them not working.Oh, and I am almost sure the pictures of them on the front is a big sticker that you could pull off if you tried hard enough.  If they put this series out on blu ray, let us hope they do a better job!!!!",1,"The show I give a 5.

928225,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000AM4PBS,Mark Baker,"[54, 69]","Friends is a sit com with a simple premise.  It follows six friends as they deal with the challenges of early adulthood in New York City.Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled woman learning to live on her own for the first time.  Her roommate Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette) is a clean freak chef.  Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer) is a nerdy paleontologist.  Across the hall from Monica and Rachel are Chandler (Matthew Perry), a sarcastic office worker, and struggling actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc).  Rounding out the group is free spirit Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) who makes her living as a message therapist and freelance guitarist.  They are usually hanging out at an apartment or the coffee house they all love, Central Perk.Over the course of ten seasons, the show managed to get all the characters through a lot of trials.  They all had many romantic relationships start and fail and all were out of work at one point or another.  Through it all, the friends stuck by each other.Those friendships are one of the things that continue to draw me to the show.  With a few exceptions, any squabbles will be patched up by the time the half hour is over.  If only friends stayed this close in real life.And of course, the show is funny.  From Chandler's one-liners to Joey's ignorant statements of fact or Monica's desire for order, these characters could be counted on to make you laugh.The one storyline that stretches from the pilot to the finale is Ross and Rachel's romantic relationship.  They almost get together and break up so many times, it gets frustrating after a while.  Their relationship is a main focus of the early seasons, but begins to take a back seat to other storylines as the series progresses.  Except, of course, when it's time for a season cliffhanger.  All but one season ended with some twist to the story.  Frankly, it got a little tiresome by the end, but it only detracts a little.Maybe dragging out the Ross/Rachel storyline is one reason for it, but the later seasons do loose a little of their charm.  The early seasons had a warmth to them that later seasons seemed to loose.  I find I enjoy watching the earlier seasons better then the later ones even though the later ones are still entertaining and funny.  Later seasons do, for example, feature Phoebe finding a man to marry and Monica and Chandler's marriage and struggles with having kids.  And, of course, there's Joey's triumphant return to Days of Our Lives and movie debut.This set has everything a fan could want.  All ten seasons of the show are here with a collectable cover to keep the smaller sets in.  The episodes features original full frame picture and 5.1 surround sound.  Scenes cut to make room for commercials are included, some for the first time.  In addition, each set contains interviews, commentary, blooper reels, set tours, trivia challenges, and other behind the scenes fun.For any fan of Friends who has put off getting the DVD's, this collection is a dream come true.  The outer collector shell is the only things those buying them all along are missing, and information about ordering it separately is available is the season 10 set.",5,A Decade of Laughter and Friendship,1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,3153,"['Friends', 'sit', 'com', 'simple', 'premise', 'six', 'friends', 'deal', 'challenges', 'early', 'adulthood', 'New', 'York', 'City.Rachel', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'spoiled', 'woman', 'learning', 'live', 'own', 'first', 'time', 'roommate', 'Monica', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Arquette', 'clean', 'freak', 'chef', 'Monica', 'brother', 'Ross', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'nerdy', 'paleontologist', 'hall', 'Monica', 'Rachel', 'are', 'Chandler', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'sarcastic', 'office', 'worker', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Joey', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'Rounding', 'out', 'group', 'free', 'spirit', 'Phoebe', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'who', 'living', 'message', 'therapist', 'freelance', 'guitarist', 'are', 'usually', 'hanging', 'out', 'apartment', 'coffee', 'house', 'love', 'Central', 'Perk.Over', 'course', 'ten', 'seasons', 'show', 'managed', 'get', 'characters', 'lot', 'trials', 'had', 'many', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'start', 'fail', 'were', 'work', 'one', 'point', 'friends', 'stuck', 'other.Those', 'friendships', 'are', 'one', 'things', 'continue', 'draw', 'show', 'few', 'exceptions', 'squabbles', 'will', 'be', 'patched', 'up', 'time', 'half', 'hour', 'only', 'stayed', 'close', 'real', 'life.And', 'course', 'show', 'funny', 'Chandler', 'one-liners', 'Joey', 'ignorant', 'statements', 'fact', 'Monica', 'desire', 'order', 'characters', 'could', 'be', 'counted', 'make', 'laugh.The', 'one', 'storyline', 'pilot', 'finale', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'almost', 'get', 'together', 'break', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'frustrating', 'while', 'relationship', 'main', 'focus', 'early', 'seasons', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'other', 'storylines', 'series', 'course', 'when', 'time', 'season', 'cliffhanger', 'one', 'season', 'ended', 'twist', 'story', 'Frankly', 'got', 'little', 'tiresome', 'end', 'only', 'little.Maybe', 'dragging', 'out', 'Ross/Rachel', 'storyline', 'one', 'reason', 'later', 'seasons', 'do', 'loose', 'little', 'charm', 'early', 'seasons', 'had', 'warmth', 'later', 'seasons', 'seemed', 'loose', 'find', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'better', 'then', 'later', 'ones', 'even', 'later', 'ones', 'are', 'still', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'Later', 'seasons', 'do', 'example', 'feature', 'Phoebe', 'finding', 'man', 'marry', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'marriage', 'having', 'kids', 'course', 'Joey', 'triumphant', 'return', 'Days', 'Lives', 'movie', 'debut.This', 'set', 'everything', 'fan', 'could', 'want', 'ten', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'here', 'collectable', 'cover', 'keep', 'smaller', 'sets', 'episodes', 'features', 'original', 'full', 'frame', 'picture', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'Scenes', 'cut', 'make', 'room', 'commercials', 'are', 'included', 'first', 'time', 'addition', 'set', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'blooper', 'reels', 'set', 'tours', 'trivia', 'challenges', 'other', 'scenes', 'fun.For', 'fan', 'Friends', 'who', 'put', 'off', 'getting', 'DVD', 'collection', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'outer', 'collector', 'shell', 'only', 'things', 'buying', 'along', 'are', 'missing', 'information', 'ordering', 'separately', 'available', 'season', '10', 'set']",N/A

For that, Friends deserves its good rep.However, when NBC, during Friends' final season, started bellowing that its was ""The Greatest Sitcom of all time,"" I balked (especially since Frasier ended its run at around the same time). I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, All in the Family, Maude, The Bob Newhart Show, MASH, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Sanford & Son, Cheers, Seinfeld, The Simpsons, Frasier and Everybody Loves Raymond, to name a few, deserve that title more.

928233,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B000AM4PBS,Mike S.,"[1, 2]","In the 1990s and early 2000s the two biggest comedies on TV were probably Friends and Seinfeld. Friends was aimed at the younger demographic, going for the viewers that were in their mid to late 20s. I actually never watched the series consistently when it was on the air. I was a senior in high school the year it began, so I just never really got into it and never appreciated how good it really was.It was one of those shows like ER, where the cast was made up of relative no names, but unlike ER the cast stayed together for the entire run. I think that allowed the show to keep the same feel and tone throughout the series. The writing was very very good in that they allowed the characters to evolve and grow over the course of 10 years but never lost the core of who they were over that time. They also did a great job of referring to old jokes without (for the most part) making them stale. The ones that did, it got to the point that they would even poke fun at it (for example ""We were on a break""). I also liked how the show relied on more than just sex jokes for the comedies (unlike many of the sitcoms of today). While there were certainly sex jokes throughout the series, there were a lot smarter jokes in there too, that presumed the audience was smart enough to be entertained by other material.One big drawback (for some) in this release is that the episodes were only the ones that were broadcast. Apparently the DVD sets included a lot of extended episodes, but this is just going to give you the show as it was intended to originally be seen. If that is a deal breaker for you, then don't waste the money. For those who do not see that as a big deal, the series looks and sounds great on Blu Ray and will make a great addition to your collection.",5,A great series,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1767,"['1990s', 'early', '2000s', 'two', 'biggest', 'comedies', 'TV', 'were', 'probably', 'Friends', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', 'was', 'aimed', 'younger', 'demographic', 'going', 'viewers', 'were', 'mid', 'late', '20s', 'actually', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'consistently', 'when', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'senior', 'high', 'school', 'year', 'began', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'never', 'appreciated', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'was.It', 'was', 'one', 'shows', 'ER', 'where', 'cast', 'was', 'made', 'relative', 'names', 'ER', 'cast', 'stayed', 'together', 'entire', 'run', 'think', 'allowed', 'show', 'keep', 'same', 'feel', 'tone', 'series', 'writing', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'allowed', 'characters', 'evolve', 'grow', 'course', '10', 'years', 'never', 'lost', 'core', 'who', 'were', 'time', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'referring', 'old', 'jokes', 'most', 'part', 'making', 'stale', 'ones', 'did', 'got', 'point', 'would', 'even', 'poke', 'fun', 'example', 'were', 'break', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'show', 'relied', 'more', 'just', 'sex', 'jokes', 'comedies', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'today', 'were', 'certainly', 'sex', 'jokes', 'series', 'were', 'lot', 'smarter', 'jokes', 'too', 'presumed', 'audience', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'entertained', 'other', 'material.One', 'big', 'drawback', 'release', 'episodes', 'were', 'only', 'ones', 'were', 'broadcast', 'Apparently', 'DVD', 'sets', 'included', 'lot', 'extended', 'episodes', 'just', 'going', 'give', 'show', 'was', 'intended', 'originally', 'be', 'seen', 'deal', 'breaker', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'big', 'deal', 'series', 'great', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'addition', 'collection']",N/A

Otto ""Mdotto9""","[85, 100]","For anyone who thinks that these episodes are cut, please read this review from Gord Lacey at tvshowsondvd(dot)com:""Alright, let's deal with the ""elephant in the room."" You may have read, or heard that these episodes are cut. That's completely false. These are the original airings of the episodes (with a couple exceptions, which I'll get to later) that were seen on NBC. If you sat down to watch the show on ""Must See TV"" Thursdays, this is what you would have seen, except it's in HD (and widescreen). When Warner Bros released this on DVD, years ago, they added material - stuff that was deleted from the episodes for whatever reason. When you create a TV show you log everything - all the shots, the timecode, everything. It's well-documented, and finding the material you need again is a relatively easy task. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with the extended episodes; records weren't kept, timecode didn't exist. That makes the task of finding the material to recreate the extended episodes a daunting task; one that likely would have made Friends on Blu-ray financial unfeasible. I think a good comparison would be what CBS is going through with Star Trek: The Next Generation, except that they're recreating episodes in HD that can bring them other financial revenue streams, while Friends would have to recoup everything from this one set. I think the irony here is that if Warner Bros didn't go to the trouble to create the extended episodes for the DVDs, there wouldn't be any issue with this Blu-ray set. I've gone through the entire set and noted the times of every episode, which you can find at the end of this review (I think I need a new remote now).There were 4 ""Super-Sized"" episodes in season 7, and while those longer episodes aren't here in HD, they entire episodes are available as SD bonus material. Those are the only episodes that differ from the ""broadcast night"" versions.""[Taken from: tvshowsondvd(dot)com]See, it's not so bad. If they would have gone through to find all the episodes that they extended, it would have taken them much longer and the cost would have been astronomical!Long story short, amazing to see in HD like on TBS/Nick at Nite. If you already have the series on DVD, then maybe you'd be happier with what you have and not buying this Blu-ray set. However, if you have been like me and waiting for the Widescreen HD episodes, then this does just fine. They are pretty much the same as what you'd see on your local TV station's syndicated version or on TBS/Nick at Nite.",4,"Trying to clear up the ""cutting"" confusion...",1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,2523,"['anyone', 'who', 'episodes', 'are', 'cut', 'please', 'read', 'review', 'Gord', 'Lacey', 'tvshowsondvd', 'dot', 'com', 'Alright', 'let', 'deal', 'elephant', 'room', 'may', 'have', 'read', 'heard', 'episodes', 'are', 'cut', 'completely', 'false', 'are', 'original', 'airings', 'episodes', 'couple', 'exceptions', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'were', 'seen', 'NBC', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'show', 'Must', 'See', 'TV', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'HD', 'widescreen', 'When', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'released', 'DVD', 'years', 'ago', 'added', 'material', 'stuff', 'was', 'deleted', 'episodes', 'reason', 'When', 'create', 'TV', 'show', 'log', 'everything', 'shots', 'timecode', 'everything', 'well-documented', 'finding', 'material', 'need', 'again', 'relatively', 'easy', 'task', 'Unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'extended', 'episodes', 'records', 'were', ""n't"", 'kept', 'timecode', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'task', 'finding', 'material', 'recreate', 'extended', 'daunting', 'task', 'one', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Friends', 'Blu-ray', 'financial', 'unfeasible', 'think', 'good', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'what', 'CBS', 'going', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', ""'re"", 'recreating', 'episodes', 'HD', 'can', 'bring', 'other', 'financial', 'revenue', 'streams', 'Friends', 'would', 'have', 'recoup', 'everything', 'one', 'set', 'think', 'irony', 'here', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'trouble', 'create', 'extended', 'episodes', 'DVDs', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'Blu-ray', 'set', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'entire', 'set', 'noted', 'times', 'episode', 'can', 'find', 'end', 'review', 'think', 'need', 'new', 'remote', 'now', 'were', '4', 'Super-Sized', 'episodes', 'season', '7', 'longer', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'here', 'HD', 'entire', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'SD', 'material', 'are', 'only', 'differ', 'broadcast', 'night', 'versions', '[', 'Taken', 'tvshowsondvd', 'dot', 'com', ']', 'See', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'find', 'episodes', 'extended', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'much', 'longer', 'cost', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'astronomical', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'amazing', 'see', 'HD', 'TBS/Nick', 'Nite', 'already', 'have', 'series', 'DVD', 'then', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier', 'what', 'have', 'not', 'buying', 'Blu-ray', 'set', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'Widescreen', 'HD', 'episodes', 'then', 'just', 'fine', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'what', ""'d"", 'see', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'syndicated', 'version', 'TBS/Nick', 'Nite']",N/A
928239,A1UJV4Y9IHNVXQ,B000AM4PBS,MovieManTN,"[25, 31]","Got the ""Friends"" boxed blu ray set today and I love it!I know the controversy surrounding the release of this set, but it honestly does not phase me. When I first saw the episodes when they aired, these were the versions I saw. When the DVD set came out, yes, it was a wonderful bonus to have the extended episodes...but that was it, a bonus. I intend to keep my DVD box set of the complete series, so I can revisit the extended episodes as I wish...but the difference in picture and sound on these blu ray discs is amazing...just like seeing them again for the first time.As of this writing, I have only watched 2 of the first season episodes. I have watched the bonus disc in its entirety.What's in the box:First off, the box is made of a VERY sturdy, thick glossy cardboard. The cover is a lenticular cover which shows the cast in the first season at one angle, and the last season at another angle. This box is held shut by magnets and opens like a chest. When opened, you will find a glossy 40 page episode guide inside with a synopsis of each episode, photos from the episodes, and some cool extra photos. Underneath this booklet, there is another very sturdy cardboard book that houses the 21 discs. There are 2 discs per page with the bonus disc being by itself on the last page of the book. The book is also held closed with magnets as the box is. A ribbon is attached to the inside of the box with these items resting on top of it, so pulling the ribbon raises the items up for easy removal.What's on the bonus disc:Friends From the Start: Approx 30 min, features the creation/origins of ""Friends"" with many of the creators of the show discussing how the show started, casting, creating the sets, etc.When Friends Become Family: Approx 30 min, again featuring creators discussing how everything came together and how the show exploded into the cultureLegacy of Friends: Approx 12 min, focuses on the impact that ""Friends"" had and still has, and shows some emotional footage of the filming of the last episode and tearing down the setProducer's Cut of ""The One Where Rachel Tells Ross"": Approx 24 min, this is the originally planned/filmed episode that was filmed prior to the 9/11 attacks, featuring a sub-plot where Chandler makes a joke about having a bomb as he and Monica are about to board the plane for their honeymoon.Original Script for ""The One Where Rachel Tells Ross"", just as describedMusic Video for The Rembrandts' ""I'll Be There for You""Short clips of ""Friends"" on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"", approx 15 min. Features clips of David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry on ""Ellen"", each appearing individuallyShort clips of ""Friends"" on ""The Tonight Show"", approx 23 min. Features the men of ""Friends"" first, sitting with Jay Leno on a recreation of the Central Perk set, discussing the ride of being on the show. The women appear next, then the men are brought out for a full reunion. This was filmed not long after the airing of the final episode, so it's not anything new.Previously Unreleased Gag Reel, approx 8 min.I, for one, am thrilled to have bought this.

It's a high quality softcover book and is put together well.I certainly understand why a lot of reviewers want the extended versions of the episodes. It's human nature to want ""more"" rather than less but personally I actually prefer the original episodes that were aired, in the correct format as they were intended for TV.The original length episodes have a better pace and are leaner and more effective in my opinion. The extra gags certainly don't contribute to the plots and if anything dwell a little too long on minor occurrences which bog down the plot with cheap one liners. Keep it moving I say :)And on this point I have yet to concede any ""extended"" or ""directors cuts"" (Blade Runner probably being the only exception) to being better than the original featured movie/tv episode.More often than not I walk away thinking the editor was right culling down redundant scenes and tangents that don't really add anything to the story.But I digress, at the end of the day at approx. $150 this boxset will reward the viewer with hours of laughter and joy at an affordable price.So for those of you not willing to wait for the extended versions that may or may not be released I say jump on board and start enjoying this charming and witty TV show and take comfort in knowing that it's a nice box set that has had a lot of thought put into it.",5,Happy With The Purchase,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",2012,1816,"['Featuring', 'very', 'cool', 'lenticular', 'cover', 'neat', 'compact', 'box', 'slip', 'page', 'booklet', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'Bond', '50', 'box', 'set', 'box', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'proud', 'addition', 'anyones', 'collection', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'take', 'pride', 'place', 'typical', 'BD', 'shelf.The', 'HD', 'transfer', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'considering', 'vintage', 'original', 'airings.The', 'episode', 'booklet', 'nice', 'touch', 'better', 'average', 'booklet', 'included', 'most', 'TV', 'show', 'collection', 'sets', 'high', 'quality', 'softcover', 'book', 'put', 'together', 'well.I', 'certainly', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'want', 'extended', 'versions', 'episodes', 'human', 'nature', 'want', 'more', 'rather', 'less', 'personally', 'actually', 'prefer', 'original', 'episodes', 'were', 'aired', 'correct', 'format', 'were', 'intended', 'TV.The', 'original', 'length', 'episodes', 'have', 'better', 'pace', 'are', 'leaner', 'more', 'effective', 'opinion', 'extra', 'gags', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'contribute', 'plots', 'anything', 'dwell', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'minor', 'occurrences', 'bog', 'down', 'plot', 'cheap', 'one', 'liners', 'Keep', 'moving', 'say', 'point', 'have', 'yet', 'concede', 'extended', 'directors', 'cuts', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'probably', 'being', 'only', 'exception', 'being', 'better', 'original', 'featured', 'movie/tv', 'episode.More', 'often', 'not', 'walk', 'away', 'thinking', 'editor', 'was', 'right', 'culling', 'down', 'redundant', 'scenes', 'tangents', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'story.But', 'digress', 'end', 'day', 'approx', '150', 'boxset', 'will', 'reward', 'viewer', 'hours', 'laughter', 'joy', 'affordable', 'price.So', 'not', 'willing', 'wait', 'extended', 'versions', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'released', 'say', 'jump', 'board', 'start', 'enjoying', 'charming', 'witty', 'TV', 'show', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'nice', 'box', 'set', 'had', 'lot', 'thought', 'put']",N/A

That's when they had that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.Ross: Uh actually, there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I don't think he knew what it was.*Chandler: (sarcastically) You guys were cool.Rachel: So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.Will: You went out with her?! We had a pact!Ross: That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.Will: Then why did it have the word eternity in it?*Joey: I'm thinking of joining an ""I Hate Turkey Club""... although I do love a turkey club.Rachel: Joey stop staring!

I meant the team that used to be in Los Angeles and now in St. Louis. (whispers toPhoebe) I actually knew that.*Monica: Ok, quick. Name three players on that team.*Chandler: Gretzky... Agassi (struggles to think of a third, then to Phoebe) I'm a pretty little girl. (Monica Throws him a tea-towel)Monica: It's true?!!Ross: No.Rachel: Yes it is!

Sadly I am very upset, and more bothered than I thought I would be, in all I know I am missing by simply watching these broadcast versions. There is a lot cut out and even the basic cutting of scenes is quicker and made to fit a commercial in.

Not as much plot at the others. : 10/10Season Two - The second funniest season, with the edition of Ross and Rachel's relationship adds more plot. : 10/10Season Three - Some very funny and some very classic episodes : 9/10Season Four - Begginning of Chandler and Monica's relationship, other then that not as good : 8/10Season Five - People discovering Monica and Chandler's relationship, The gang going to Las Vegas, great season. : 10/10Season Six - Joey's money crisis, Ross and Rachel's annulment, Monical and Chandler moving in together, a jam packed season..maybe too jam packed though : 9/10Season Seven - Monica and Chandler's wedding along with other great stuff : 10/10Season Eight - The One With the Videotape is the best one here : 8/10Season Nine - Good moments, not great - 9/10Season Ten - The finale, great classic episodes, great ending, very good season : 10/10I found that the early seasons had less of a plot then the later seasons, making it funnier.

Freinds has had a nice good run (1994-2004) and has developed a very loyal fan base. This show follows a group of six friends while they thry to go through this crazy life. Through heartbreak, divorce, and even death, this how takles serious issues while still keeping the comedy going. If I could only buy 1 TV-on-DVD, it would be the ""Friends"" series. It is great seeing these people evolve and go through relationships with one another. Joey is one of the most funny, partly becuase he is portrayed as the most stupid person alive, and Chandler is his roomate (for the first couple seasons) and his best friend. Chanler is known for his quick witt and making everything more dramatic than it is. Joey and Chandler are the perfect model for a male-bonding relationship. The stick with each other through thick and thin, even when Joey wears Chandler's clothes while going ""commando"" (Could I be wearing any more clothes?!) Later in the series Chandler strikes up a relationship with Monica Gellar, the ex-fatty, neurotic, neat-freak. Monica is known for being extremelly well-organized, and reminising about her days as a fatty. Monica's brother is Ross Gellar, an intelligent Paleantologist who has to put up with all of his freinds insults, and jokes. since the first season he and Rachel Greene have been having an on-agin-off-again relationship. Rachel starts in the series as the typical daddy's girl who just stood up for herself to make a name for herself. She moves in with old high school friend Monica Gellar, and all the Friends begin their bonding. Monica's ex-roomate is Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric loner whose life has been very unfortunate (until now) her mother gave both of her kids away for adoption (Phoebe and her twin) and later in life her adoptive mother killed herself forcing Phoebe to live on the streets. Now she lives by herslef, and works as a masseous.She is not the brightest person, but sometimes she can turn out to be the funniest one of the series. This show is my FAVORITE show of ALL TIME!!!

I watched about the first 7 seasons and missed the last 3.  I purchased the complete series so that I could finish the rest of the series.I have watched all of the discs completely through and did not have any issues with the discs skipping, and none of them were damaged.I have to say after finally finishing the last 3 seasons that I didn't get to see while they were still on TV, I could sit and watch all 10 seasons over again.  This show is the funniest show and I truly miss it being on TV.  Its really sad that there are hardly any shows on TV now that can fill the shoes of this show or other shows that were on TV around this time period.

Her birthday came around so this was a gift for her so she can watch the whole series again from start to finish and not miss a thing. A fair amount of extras are included on the discs but not by today's standards. I've heard this set includes extra footage that has been removed from the Blu-Ray edition which is a bonus but watching the DVD on a Blu-Ray screen isn't the best thing (unless I'm missing a setting to fix that somehow) so we fortunately have the old DVD player and the giant rear projection TV in the spare room to re-watch as we saw it way back when.

Rigney,"[4, 7]","I realize many are disappointed that the episodes do not contain the extended versions of episodes, but neither are these episodes cut SYNDICATED versions, just to clear up possible misunderstandings. These are the versions that aired Thursday nights on NBC for a decade. (Example? Nick at Nite, for whatever prudish reason, ALWAYS cuts the awesome ""You BITCH!"" line from Chandler to Monica during the scene in TOW Phoebe's Husband in S2 where it is discovered by the gang - thanks to Monica - that Chandler has a third nipple. It *is* left intact here.)So, these versions *are* longer than the syndicated versions as shown on TBS and Nick at Nite, but shorter than the extended episodes found on the DVD releases, *minus* the Super-Sized episodes, which keep the longer length.I received the set, and the quality is absolutely stunning. Add in the hours of new bonus materials (*in addition* to the bonus materials found on the DVD sets), and it is well worth the money. Also of note, as I mentioned above, NBC used to do Super Sized episodes in the later seasons, and these *are* present in the set, meaning unedited. So there *are* some longer episodes included here, along with the original script for the episode TOW Rachel Tells Ross.Does it suck that the extended cuts are not used? Sure, I admit it. But I am taking Warner Brothers at its word in that the bonus scenes were not available and/or suitable for inclusion. And considering it is these versions seen in the original run, I can live with it, although I know for others, that is not the case.Still, for the bonus materials and picture quality alone, I think this set is definitely worth the expense.",4,"Yes, the episodes are shorter, but broadcast NOT syndicated cuts!",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1666,"['realize', 'many', 'are', 'disappointed', 'episodes', 'do', 'not', 'contain', 'extended', 'versions', 'episodes', 'are', 'episodes', 'cut', 'SYNDICATED', 'versions', 'just', 'clear', 'up', 'possible', 'misunderstandings', 'are', 'versions', 'aired', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'NBC', 'decade', 'Example', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'prudish', 'reason', 'ALWAYS', 'awesome', 'BITCH', 'line', 'Chandler', 'Monica', 'scene', 'TOW', 'Phoebe', 'Husband', 'S2', 'where', 'discovered', 'gang', 'thanks', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'third', 'nipple', 'left', 'intact', 'here', 'So', 'versions', '*are*', 'longer', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'shown', 'TBS', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'shorter', 'extended', 'episodes', 'found', 'DVD', 'releases', '*minus*', 'Super-Sized', 'episodes', 'keep', 'longer', 'received', 'set', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'Add', 'hours', 'new', 'bonus', 'materials', '*in', 'addition*', 'bonus', 'materials', 'found', 'DVD', 'sets', 'well', 'money', 'Also', 'note', 'mentioned', 'NBC', 'used', 'do', 'Super', 'Sized', 'later', 'seasons', '*are*', 'present', 'set', 'meaning', 'unedited', 'So', '*are*', 'longer', 'episodes', 'included', 'here', 'original', 'script', 'episode', 'TOW', 'Rachel', 'Tells', 'Ross.Does', 'suck', 'extended', 'cuts', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'Sure', 'admit', 'am', 'taking', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'word', 'bonus', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'and/or', 'suitable', 'inclusion', 'considering', 'versions', 'seen', 'original', 'run', 'can', 'live', 'know', 'others', 'not', 'case.Still', 'bonus', 'materials', 'picture', 'quality', 'alone', 'think', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'expense']",N/A
