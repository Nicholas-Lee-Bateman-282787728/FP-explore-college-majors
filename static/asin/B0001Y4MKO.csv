The story has depth, you get to understand why a woman would come to a strange country to try and start a new life, the shallow selfishness of the man who brings her here could have been very cookie cutter but has layers too.  I forget I'm watching a movie and enjoyed it as much as any movie ever.",5,Paradise is in the heart of the viewer,1264550400,"01 27, 2010",2010,357,"['really', 'loved', 'movie', 'quiet', 'interesting', 'lovely', 'story', 'depth', 'get', 'understand', 'why', 'woman', 'would', 'come', 'strange', 'country', 'try', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'shallow', 'selfishness', 'man', 'who', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'layers', 'too', 'forget', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'ever']",N/A

Malonson""","[2, 2]","You might think that Postmark Paradise is another wacky comedy about the trials and travails of a Ukrainian mail order bride.Despite it's flawed premise of a bunch of guys ordering a mail order bride for a co-worker who is jailed for a DUI, the movie is actually more about responding to change in our lives and situations and how we respond to them.Although you might think the movie is about Viktoria, the mail order bride, upon reflection I think it is truly the story of Reenie, the bar woman who takes her in when she has nowhere else to go.Reenie's life has obviously seen better days, she is estranged from her daughter and has never seen her granddaughter. She is the one who really grows in the movie as her experiences with Viktoria give her the courage and desire to move on with her life and begin growing.The movie is a little slow at times and the ending was a little frustrating, but overall not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.Cheers!",4,You can sometimes find Paradise in the strangest of places,1206316800,"03 24, 2008",2008,956,"['might', 'think', 'Postmark', 'Paradise', 'wacky', 'comedy', 'trials', 'travails', 'Ukrainian', 'mail', 'order', 'flawed', 'premise', 'bunch', 'guys', 'ordering', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'co-worker', 'who', 'jailed', 'DUI', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'responding', 'change', 'lives', 'situations', 'how', 'respond', 'them.Although', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'Viktoria', 'mail', 'order', 'bride', 'reflection', 'think', 'truly', 'story', 'Reenie', 'bar', 'woman', 'who', 'when', 'nowhere', 'else', 'go.Reenie', 'life', 'obviously', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'estranged', 'daughter', 'never', 'seen', 'granddaughter', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'movie', 'experiences', 'Viktoria', 'give', 'courage', 'desire', 'move', 'life', 'begin', 'growing.The', 'movie', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'frustrating', 'overall', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half.Cheers']",N/A

No violence, no gunshots, no murders. Just a romantic comedy of the gentlest kind.

In general I have been deeply disappointed with films dealing with this subject because they treat Russian women as sex objects.  Not so with this movie...and that is good. In this film, the Russian female Viktoria comes to the United States in response to a misleading invitation by some ""good ol' boys"" in the middle of nowhere, the town of Paradise in Michigan. She has to fend for herself, restore her self-confidence, learn to be independent in America.  She does this through her kindness, understanding, and skill in treating animals. Vikoria's struggles and successes make this a very touching movie.",5,The emancipation of a Russian mail order bride,1138320000,"01 27, 2006",2006,723,"['obvious', 'economic', 'social', 'reasons', 'many', 'Russian', 'women', 'have', 'come', 'United', 'States', 'mail', 'order', 'brides', 'general', 'have', 'been', 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'films', 'dealing', 'subject', 'treat', 'Russian', 'women', 'sex', 'objects', 'Not', 'so', 'movie', 'good', 'film', 'Russian', 'female', 'Viktoria', 'United', 'States', 'response', 'misleading', 'invitation', 'good', 'ol', 'boys', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'town', 'Paradise', 'Michigan', 'fend', 'restore', 'self-confidence', 'learn', 'be', 'independent', 'America', 'kindness', 'understanding', 'skill', 'treating', 'animals', 'Vikoria', 'struggles', 'successes', 'make', 'very', 'touching', 'movie']",N/A
