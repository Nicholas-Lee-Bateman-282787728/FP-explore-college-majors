726522,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00007CVRF,Charles Ashbacher,"[14, 20]","He has gone down in history as a traitor, which is true. Had he succeeded in his plan to allow the British to capture the fort of West Point and General Washington, there would have been no United States in the eighteenth century. However, the true story is much more complex than that of a man selling out his country. He was the best field general in the U. S. army, his victory at Saratoga, where he personally led the charge to victory, established the Continental army as a viable military force. Seriously wounded in the leg, he was forced to spend a great deal of time convalescing.During this time, an ungrateful Congress forced him to resign and promoted a politically connected incompetent ahead of him. His old friend George Washington manages to convince him to return to service and he is named military governor of Philadelphia after the British depart. He forcefully intervenes to stop mobs from hanging loyalists and looting their property. He also attempts to mend the fences between all factions, inviting all groups to a party. Unfortunately for him, he falls in love with the daughter of a loyalist and eventually marries her. This creates a scandal, he is removed from his position as military governor and is named commander of the fort at West Point. The Congress does not give him his back pay and then sends him a bill for goods. The Philadelphia mob attacks his house and he is humiliated. He is then transferred to the command of the fort at West Point. Urged by his wife, he plots to betray the colonial army and when the plot is discovered, he barely escapes before being captured.The best part of this video is that it destroys the historical myth that all of the colonists fighting against the British in the war of independence were idealists who put country before personal gain. The Continental Congress was split by major political factionalism and most people placed loyalty to their state over that to the new nation. People used their positions of influence to profit, gain revenge and destroy those considered rivals for power. At times not even George Washington could stand against them. While Benedict Arnold did betray his country, he suffered so much before he did so that it is difficult to fault him. Aidan Quinn and Kelsey Grammer give superb performances as Benedict Arnold and George Washington. This is another one of those historical videos that should be required viewing in all history classes covering the American war of independence.",5,The wronging of Benedict Arnold and his reaction,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2489,"['gone', 'down', 'history', 'traitor', 'true', 'Had', 'succeeded', 'plan', 'allow', 'British', 'capture', 'fort', 'West', 'Point', 'General', 'Washington', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'United', 'States', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'However', 'true', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'man', 'selling', 'out', 'country', 'was', 'best', 'field', 'general', 'U.', 'S.', 'army', 'victory', 'Saratoga', 'where', 'personally', 'led', 'charge', 'victory', 'established', 'Continental', 'army', 'viable', 'military', 'force', 'Seriously', 'wounded', 'leg', 'was', 'forced', 'spend', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'convalescing.During', 'time', 'ungrateful', 'Congress', 'forced', 'resign', 'promoted', 'politically', 'connected', 'incompetent', 'ahead', 'old', 'friend', 'George', 'Washington', 'convince', 'return', 'service', 'named', 'military', 'governor', 'Philadelphia', 'British', 'depart', 'forcefully', 'stop', 'mobs', 'hanging', 'loyalists', 'looting', 'property', 'also', 'mend', 'fences', 'factions', 'inviting', 'groups', 'party', 'Unfortunately', 'love', 'daughter', 'loyalist', 'eventually', 'scandal', 'removed', 'position', 'military', 'governor', 'named', 'commander', 'fort', 'West', 'Point', 'Congress', 'not', 'give', 'back', 'pay', 'then', 'bill', 'goods', 'Philadelphia', 'mob', 'house', 'humiliated', 'then', 'transferred', 'command', 'fort', 'West', 'Point', 'Urged', 'wife', 'betray', 'colonial', 'army', 'when', 'plot', 'discovered', 'barely', 'being', 'captured.The', 'best', 'part', 'video', 'historical', 'myth', 'colonists', 'fighting', 'British', 'war', 'independence', 'were', 'idealists', 'who', 'put', 'country', 'personal', 'gain', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'was', 'split', 'major', 'political', 'factionalism', 'most', 'people', 'placed', 'loyalty', 'state', 'new', 'nation', 'People', 'used', 'positions', 'influence', 'profit', 'gain', 'revenge', 'destroy', 'considered', 'rivals', 'power', 'times', 'not', 'even', 'George', 'Washington', 'could', 'stand', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'did', 'betray', 'country', 'suffered', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'so', 'difficult', 'fault', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'give', 'superb', 'performances', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'George', 'Washington', 'one', 'historical', 'videos', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'history', 'classes', 'covering', 'American', 'war', 'independence']",N/A
726523,A27T7FAONDX6VI,B00007CVRF,"Chris ""Chris906""","[3, 3]","'Benedict Arnold - A Question of Honor' is a honest attempt at the very fascinating story of Benedict Arnold but it comes up short. Benedict Arnold's story should be brought to life because it has to be one of the most interesting and tragic stories to come out of the American Revolution. But the A & E version of his story feels too rushed, just not enough detail, and has a lower budget. The battle scenes that depict Arnold's heroic actions for the Americans in the Revolution are rather short and do not have a cast of thousands. There is no real sense of the vastness of the American Revolution. Also valuable time is spent on romantic scenes of Arnold and his wife that would be better used in depicting the machinations of his treason.The acting is good, but is short of great. Aidan Quinn makes a suitably moody Arnold but does not really bring out what made Arnold such an admired American commander before he became a turncoat. Kelsey Grammer is decent as Washington but falls short of the excellent cinematic performances of Washington done by Barry Bostwick, Jeff Daniels, and David Morse. The key figure besides Arnold in the treason John Andre is portrayed in a less than convincing fashion. I did not really like the actor's performance as Andre and he did not bring the figure alive. Many American officers believed that Andre should not hang and were taken by his unique character but none of this comes through in the film.I also believe that the film should have been longer and made on a bigger budget because this is such a interesting tale with so many interesting historical characters involved.The DVD contains a rather good hour-long A & E biography on Arnold that contains nice contributions by many excellent American Revolution historians.I think viewers would be better served by reading the books 'Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor' by Willard Sterne Randall and 'The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John Andre' by James Thomas Flexner than watching the film. Hopefully one day this story can be done correctly on a larger scale and really show all of the complications of this most fascinating time in American history.",3,"Interesting, flawed version of the Benedict Arnold story",1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,2163,"['Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'honest', 'attempt', 'very', 'fascinating', 'story', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'up', 'short', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'brought', 'life', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'tragic', 'stories', 'come', 'American', 'Revolution', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'story', 'feels', 'too', 'rushed', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'detail', 'lower', 'budget', 'battle', 'depict', 'Arnold', 'heroic', 'actions', 'Americans', 'Revolution', 'are', 'rather', 'short', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'cast', 'thousands', 'real', 'sense', 'vastness', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Also', 'valuable', 'time', 'spent', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Arnold', 'wife', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'used', 'depicting', 'machinations', 'treason.The', 'acting', 'good', 'short', 'great', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'suitably', 'moody', 'Arnold', 'not', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'Arnold', 'such', 'admired', 'American', 'commander', 'became', 'turncoat', 'Kelsey', 'Grammer', 'decent', 'Washington', 'short', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'performances', 'Washington', 'done', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'David', 'Morse', 'key', 'figure', 'besides', 'Arnold', 'treason', 'John', 'Andre', 'portrayed', 'less', 'convincing', 'fashion', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'actor', 'performance', 'Andre', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'figure', 'alive', 'Many', 'American', 'officers', 'believed', 'Andre', 'should', 'not', 'hang', 'were', 'taken', 'unique', 'character', 'none', 'film.I', 'also', 'believe', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'made', 'bigger', 'budget', 'such', 'interesting', 'tale', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'historical', 'characters', 'involved.The', 'DVD', 'rather', 'good', 'hour-long', 'A', 'E', 'biography', 'Arnold', 'nice', 'contributions', 'many', 'excellent', 'American', 'Revolution', 'historians.I', 'think', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'reading', 'books', 'Arnold', 'Patriot', 'Traitor', 'Willard', 'Sterne', 'Randall', ""'The"", 'Traitor', 'Spy', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'John', 'Andre', 'James', 'Thomas', 'Flexner', 'watching', 'film', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'correctly', 'larger', 'scale', 'really', 'show', 'complications', 'most', 'fascinating', 'time', 'American', 'history']",N/A

726527,A3KB1H0S7T6JX1,B00007CVRF,L Gontzes,"[13, 19]","Unlike The Patriot which was purely made for propaganda purposes, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, follows a much more pragmatic, realistic, and in effect a more truthful account of events during the American War of Independence (1775-1783).  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Continental General Benedict Arnold trying to survive the turmoil of a country at war with itself, and on the other, the War of Independence and its ripple effects on America in the background.  The movie portrays superbly the hardships endured on the battlefield, and the war's effects on society; the corrupt politics, the different attitudes and mentality of English North American colonists during the war i.e. the Loyalists, the Continentals and the Neutrals.It provides therefore, valuable insight into a very important period of American (and British) History.  Specifically:We get a taste (though a very light one) of what happened to those caught by the other side...Moreover, we get to see or hear about, the double-crossing merchants, farmers, and politicians that supported whichever side the wind happened to be blowing in, always in search of profit and personal gain.The clash between the Loyalist American English and the Continental American English, just like the one between the Continental American English and the British English is fascinating and very well presented throughout the film, but then so is the clash within the Continental side (the undermining, the personality clashes, favoritism, public relations, political connections), between Congress and the Army, as well as the farmers and most importantly the merchants profiteering at the expense of whoever/whichever side etc.There is also the brave admission (by G. Washington) that the Continentals lack public support, and the important role that Washington played throughout the Revolution in keeping the Continentals ""alive,"" long enough for the French (1778), Spaniards (1779), and Dutch (1780) to enter the war against Great Britain.In addition, Washington talks about the Indians with contempt and in a patronizing way, underlining the traditional hatred between the lower class North American colonists and the natives (not a surprise considering the content of the Declaration of Independence: ""the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions"").Moreover, Washington sends Arnold to Philadelphia to protect the Loyalist population from Joseph Reed, the bloodthirsty member of the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, who wants to exact revenge on all those that do not support the rebellion.  ""One Loyalist shall hang every day for the next 500 days!"" (Execute the owner and then conveniently confiscate their property.)The film is also excellent in showing that Arnold among others (as Washington also admits) is no ""saint,"" and clearly portrays his corruption through his encounter/business dealings with the merchant to whom he gave a commercial permit in exchange for 50% of his profits/goods.Therefore, the movie successfully sheds light on aspects of American History that some would rather keep hidden ""under the carpet.""As a result, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor, is a daring movie, which shatters more than a few misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding attitudes towards the War of Independence, and provides for historical truths, which had been suppressed for long years in the name of ""patriotism.""The only setback is in relation to Major David Franks; could his religion be more obvious???  What was the point of that?  Why is it that one gets the feeling that this was more the result of ""modern"" influence...In short, Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor is a movie definitely worth watching, and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection, especially for those interested in History.Strongly recommended along with Revolution starring Al Pacino.",5,NEAR PERFECTION!,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",2005,4013,"['Patriot', 'was', 'purely', 'made', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'much', 'more', 'pragmatic', 'realistic', 'effect', 'more', 'truthful', 'account', 'events', 'American', 'War', 'Independence', '1775-1783', 'film', 'screen', 'two', 'main', 'stories', 'are', 'unfolding', 'simultaneously', 'one', 'hand', 'Continental', 'General', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'trying', 'survive', 'turmoil', 'country', 'war', 'other', 'War', 'Independence', 'ripple', 'effects', 'America', 'background', 'movie', 'superbly', 'hardships', 'endured', 'battlefield', 'war', 'effects', 'society', 'corrupt', 'politics', 'different', 'attitudes', 'mentality', 'English', 'North', 'American', 'colonists', 'war', 'i.e', 'Loyalists', 'Continentals', 'Neutrals.It', 'therefore', 'valuable', 'insight', 'very', 'important', 'period', 'American', 'British', 'History', 'Specifically', 'get', 'taste', 'very', 'light', 'one', 'what', 'happened', 'caught', 'other', 'side', 'Moreover', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'double-crossing', 'merchants', 'farmers', 'politicians', 'supported', 'side', 'wind', 'happened', 'be', 'blowing', 'always', 'search', 'profit', 'personal', 'gain.The', 'clash', 'Loyalist', 'American', 'English', 'Continental', 'American', 'English', 'just', 'one', 'Continental', 'American', 'English', 'British', 'English', 'fascinating', 'very', 'well', 'presented', 'film', 'then', 'so', 'clash', 'Continental', 'side', 'undermining', 'personality', 'clashes', 'favoritism', 'public', 'relations', 'political', 'connections', 'Congress', 'Army', 'as', 'well', 'farmers', 'most', 'importantly', 'merchants', 'profiteering', 'expense', 'whoever/whichever', 'side', 'also', 'brave', 'admission', 'G.', 'Washington', 'Continentals', 'lack', 'public', 'support', 'important', 'role', 'Washington', 'played', 'Revolution', 'keeping', 'Continentals', 'alive', 'long', 'enough', 'French', '1778', 'Spaniards', '1779', 'Dutch', '1780', 'enter', 'war', 'Great', 'Britain.In', 'addition', 'Washington', 'Indians', 'contempt', 'patronizing', 'way', 'underlining', 'traditional', 'hatred', 'lower', 'class', 'North', 'American', 'colonists', 'natives', 'not', 'surprise', 'considering', 'content', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'merciless', 'Indian', 'savages', 'known', 'rule', 'warfare', 'undistinguished', 'destruction', 'ages', 'sexes', 'conditions', '.Moreover', 'Washington', 'Arnold', 'Philadelphia', 'protect', 'Loyalist', 'population', 'Joseph', 'Reed', 'bloodthirsty', 'member', 'Continental', 'Congress', 'Pennsylvania', 'who', 'exact', 'revenge', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'rebellion', 'One', 'Loyalist', 'shall', 'hang', 'day', 'next', '500', 'days', 'Execute', 'owner', 'then', 'conveniently', 'confiscate', 'property', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'showing', 'Arnold', 'others', 'Washington', 'also', 'saint', 'clearly', 'corruption', 'encounter/business', 'dealings', 'merchant', 'whom', 'gave', 'commercial', 'permit', 'exchange', '50', '%', 'profits/goods.Therefore', 'movie', 'successfully', 'light', 'aspects', 'American', 'History', 'would', 'rather', 'keep', 'hidden', 'carpet', 'result', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'daring', 'movie', 'more', 'few', 'misconceptions', 'deliberate', 'not', 'surrounding', 'attitudes', 'War', 'Independence', 'historical', 'truths', 'had', 'been', 'suppressed', 'long', 'years', 'name', 'patriotism', 'only', 'setback', 'relation', 'Major', 'David', 'Franks', 'could', 'religion', 'be', 'more', 'obvious', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'Why', 'one', 'feeling', 'was', 'more', 'result', 'modern', 'influence', 'short', 'Benedict', 'Arnold', 'Question', 'Honor', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'movie', 'collection', 'especially', 'interested', 'History.Strongly', 'recommended', 'along', 'Revolution', 'starring', 'Al', 'Pacino']",N/A
