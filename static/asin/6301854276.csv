270873,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6301854276,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Another 48 Hours, 1990 filmThey say the sequel usually isn't as good as the original. This is not an exception to that rule. The reason is the story. Overall it is an interesting plot, but seems to intense at times. It has a lot of action and killing, maybe too much for a mystery story. Who is the ""Iceman"", the person behind the illegal drug trade in the San Francisco area? The answer lies in uncovering his identity. The original seems to have more humor. This one seems to have too many cardboard characters. The final scenes have a lot of shooting, as if that alone would make a better movie. The premise of this story seems unbelievable to me.The lack of daylight scenes outside of the desert suggests a low budget production. I don't think there will be another sequel.

As I mentioned in the review for the first film,Murphy had a long string of hit films in between that film and this one. Nolte's in-between films include DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS and EXTREME PREJUDICE. Plain clothes cop Jack Cates(Nolte) is on the verge of losing his police badge. We first see Reggie Hammond(Murphy) in jail for a repeat offense and he is awaiting release. Jack visits Reggie,telling him that they have more work to do. Reggie tells Jack,""You and I ain't got s--t to do! I did that cop s--t once before and don't like it."". Reggie reluctantly plays the police game again with Jack who's on suspension and they pursue a drug dealer known as the Iceman,who turns out to be Jack's co-worker Sgt. Ben Kehoe(the late Brion James). On the day of Reggie's release,all subsequent highlights for him are bad. He's been shot at,one of his favorite cassettes was stolen,the bus he rode flipped over 17 times unbelievably,and his car exploded via planted explosives. Reggie was not so thrilled by Jack visit to him in jail(""I haven't seen you in years,I thought you were my friend.""). Reggie even noticed differences in Jack,those being weight loss thanks to giving up booze,a new hairstyle and new clothes. ""Times have changed."",quipps Jack. Yes,apparrel and hairstyles have changed between 1982(when the first film was made) and 1989(when this one was made). Sadly,Jack and Reggie aren't so much ""best buds"" in this film like they were in the first one. In many of the joint scenes,Reggie was so upset with Jack,mostly because Jack failed to repay money to Reggie. There are other heavily armed drug dealers who were out to get the Iceman,who ends up shot to death in one of the last scenes. Reggie,at his demand,is shot by Jack,but not fatally. Reggie is enroute to the hospital via ambulance. Jack claims a cigarette lighter from the Iceman,to remember the adventure by. The barfight scene was pretty cool although Jack initiated it and it ends with Reggie firing a bullet through the nightclub's ceiling. I liked this film better than the first.

Cates is certain to face the loss of his badge if he doesn't wrap this up, so he turns to Hammond to help him bring in the Iceman.  Three sadistic bikers (hired by the Iceman) are also hunting the pair, one of whom is the revenge hungry brother of the psycho Cates killed in the first film.

Sure, the action is loud and sometimes hilarious as when Reggie Hammond, ex-Con, tells the people in the nightclub, ""Anyone else want a limp?"" This is just after he shoots a huge wrestler type bad guy who was going to attack him right in the left kneecap. I liked the action scene with the creepy shootout in the seedy San Francisco Chinatown hotel where the dynamic duo track down the long haired hippie like biker assassins. There is a twist, of course, in fact there is a double twist to the tale. The main culprit called the ""Ice-man"", who is a big time drug dealer, turns out to be someone very close to suspended Police Inspector Cates played by Nick Nolte. Nolte looks a bit old and haggard in this movie. He really needs plastic surgery and Botox if he wants to play any more lead roles.

This movie was so full of holes and imcomplete plot twists I don't even know where to begin.  So why not right here?SPOILER ALERT1)Why the hell would a cop turn out to be the head of an organized crime syndicate?  Why even clock in every day, if your interests lie elsewhere?  Somebody else asked why Eddie Murphy would not recognize Kehoe (or whatever his name was) as the Iceman?  The answer is: you're right, it was a stupid loose end, and quite unbelievable.2)Please just film a movie in the city it's supposed to be in.  We all know it was in San Francisco the first go around.  If its supposed to be in SF the 2nd go around, don't film in LA, or elsewhere, and pretend its SF.  We LOCALS will know the difference, and more importantly, care. (The fake tourist cable cars on wheels was killing me!!!)  And any good writer could have come up with a storyline in a different city.  What a weird coincidence, Jack gets a tip that the ""Iceman"" has moved to LA, and guess who has been transferred down there to another prison?  Anything, please!3)You know that glass in prisons that separate the visitor from the prisoner when they talk on the phone?  It can't be broken.  Trust me, it can't.  The part where the prisoner shatters the glass with his hands was hysterically inacurate.  Why even have that in a movie?  Stupid!!! Can you say ""overkill?""4) Okay, so Jack and Reggie haven't seen each other in 8 years, or however long its supposed to be in the movie.  Does that mean they're complete enemies immediately upon setting eyes upon each other?  Why not have some conflict, which makes their dislike for each other more believable?  Than when Jack throws the baskeball at Reggie's face, we won't think its completely asinine!5)To have Reggie sitting in his prison cell, singing the same exact song (Roxanne by the Police) with a walkman, is ludicrous!  Come on, I'm sure the writers are clever enough to come up with something new!!!6)The musical sequences when the motorcyclists crash through the movie walls, and many other scenes, were exactly the same as the original.  I heard this music about 50 times, that I've watched the original.  I think they could have mixed up the musical scores a bit.  I can understand using the same theme, but even Dirty Harry movies and Star Wars movies mix up the version of music they use in each new movie.7)Back storyline, about Murphy being pressured to get some money to an old friend's daughter was touching, but not very believable, and probably un-necessary.

I'm glad he agreed to direct this 'milk the golden cow' sequel. In somebody else's hands, this might have stunk out loud.Here's the scoop. Eddie Murphy is getting out of prison. Nolte is in the cross hairs of internal affairs and still cannot seem to collar the mercurial ""Iceman."" There are hits contracted on both of them with some mean biker dudes. Will Murphy get his money? Can Nolte collar ""The Iceman"" and save his career? Can the two of them stay alive? Do we care?Yes. I cared. I like the characters and this is a fun watch if only for the adroit directing of Hill. As Murphy and Nolte left on good terms in the original, the writers here were smart enough to know they had to renew the adversarial relationship between them, because that's what worked. They do manage that well enough. The story is Ok. There are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer on their toes.  What's going on here is he directing. Hill knows how to frame a shot and set it up for the next shot. The mayhem scene in the nightclub is choreographed really well. That might not seem like much but it is. The bad gays are over the top, larger than life bad. They can sneer with the worst of them. This is just good tough guy stuff which is what Hill is best at. Murphy is listed as one of the producers so he gives himself some good lines and a lot of smarts to help Nolte figure out what's going on.Some call this an unnecessary sequel. Most sequels are.

(Despite being made in 1990).The first 48 Hours was a bonafide hit that started and/or influenced the cop buddy film genre for years to come. It was Eddie Murphy's first film and along with Trading Places made him a star. It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.Another 48 Hours came on the scene at a different time. Eddie Murphy had just had some high profile cinematic bombs and people were anxious for his next great hit. (Little did we know at the time, how great a wait people would have.) Nothing that worked in the first film works here. Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through his role and the film simply is not funny.The action scenes are not much better. The villains look like a Klingon Biker Gang. There is a muddled story with a reveal at the end that could not make less sense if they tried. The direction by Walter Hill is pedestrian and the jazzy soundtrack practically assaults the audience.There are a few positives. Nick Nolte seems game throughout much of the film despite the ridiculous script and some of the action set pieces are decent. Over-all the film is a clear miss and an example of why sequels got such a bad name back in the Eighties (Okay early Nineties).Overall the film is not worth ten minutes of your time let alone another 48 Hours.And here is an unrelated picture to help cleanse the palate.",1,Another 48 Hours...

270895,A1X910WAOVYV8M,6301854276,"Nathan ""Cawntry-fried Calypso Beach Bum""","[1, 1]","MAA-AAN! It really grinds my gears when a movie develops a bad rep upon release an' e'ybody an' they mother jus' assumes it's bad even before they see it. I hadn't heard hardly ANY positive reaction to this movie, but decided to be me an' check it out for myself. Now I like jus' 'bout e'ything Eddie Murphy did between the early 1980s an' the early to mid-1990s. I think he's a very talented actor an' comedian (though his script choices as of late show a sign of poor judgment) an' to see him reprise the role of Reggie Hammond, the role that turned him into a Hollywood superstar (sure as hell uppin' his bankability, 'ya notice how in this one Eddie's top-billed, whereas in the original Nolte was?), I was pretty psyched. Is' several years later an' a lot has changed; Cates stopped drinkin' an' seems a lil' more laid-back an' easy going because of it, he's trackin' a mysterious druglord called 'The Ice Man' that the rest'a the department doesn't believe exists, an' Reggie is FINALLY about to get outta the pen after servin' an extended five-year sentence for robbin' the payroll (which he CLAIMS he didn't do). While trackin' the Ice Man, Cates discovers that somehow Reggie is involved an' the people he's after have a hit planned. Soooooo with Reggie bein' the only link to a seemingly-unsolveable crime, Cates is standin' there smilin' on the mornin' of Reggie's release from custody. Jus' not to a real receptive friend.I really don't see how people can say that its 'more remake than sequel', 'cause it seems 'ta me like an OBVIOUS extension of the first. The crazy lunatic bikers have vendettas toward Reggie an' Cates that run deeper than the usual business hit, also no matter how much Reggie DOESN'T wanna be involved, Cates has the upper hand bein' that he's still in possession'a his half a million dollars an' gleaming Porsche. Oh yeah, an' Reggie's none-too-happy 'bout rottin' in jail for five years longer than his original sentence an' then comin' out to find out Cates won't give him his hard-stolen cash. Speakin'a which, I like the way Eddie played Reggie in this one; bein' that he had been holed up in prison even LONGER, an' that Cates offered him NO assistance an' put in no good words for him, it would make sense that he would be a lot angrier an' frustrated than in the original where he was mostly jus' smarmy an' fast-talkin'. The scenes where he blows up at Cates with rage are the best in the whole flick. The tension between the two is there once again, but rather than bein' the result of background an' race as in the first one, here is' the result of good old-fashioned spite. Two guys who went from enemies to friends an' back to enemies gotta find a way to get back to friends if they gon' get outta this alive.Now, don't get me wrong, this don't in ANY way eclipse the original. But is' a solid, entertaining effort an' the chemistry between Murphy an' Nolte is as sparkin' an' snappin' as ever. Is' not excellent or anything, there are a few uneven spots an' the guys who play the crazy hillbilly bikers bring new meaning to the term ""over-acting"", but is' not nearly as bad as critics an' stuffed shirts made it out to be. C'mon now, anytime you got a sequel to a bar-raising, near-CLASSIC, how can you expect it to jus' blow you away all over again? Is' not even possible. The original '48 HRS.' set a standard for which buddy cop flicks were to be played by throughout the 1980s.

On his way out of prison, some biker punks shoot up his bus causing it to flip over several time. Nick's character is bent on catching a drug dealer by the name of Iceman and figures out that his case is tied in with Reggie's especially after the same people who shot at him, shot at Reggie too.What ensues is a bunch of pointless bar brawls with stupid hicks and shoot outs with biker gang members. Eddie Murphy looks like he didnt want to be there even though I cant say the same for Nick Nolte. The movie has its moments but for the most part is kind of bland. The humor is forced and so is the chemistry between Murphy and Nolte. If you must get this movie get the two movie (48 Hrs/Another 48 HRS)on one disc deal that they have here on Amazon.

At first viewing it seems sub par to the first, but then gets better with repeat viewing.  Much like Beverly Hills Cop III.  Maybe over time it gains a nostalgic factor?  The last two reviewers are really F'ed in the head!  They are both way off the mark.  The film was shot in the Bay Area and sorrounding region.  Much was filmed in the central valley of California, and the prison was the same one as in the first.  The music is one of the best parts of the movie.  I really like that steel drum sound.  What I don't like is when they try to repeat things that were naturally funny or well recieved in the first film.  It just seems forced and unamusing.  Reggie did eventually recognize the Iceman, but it was difficult, because he only caught a glimpse of him once a long time ago, and was probably scared crapless when he did.  A cop that is the head of a crime ring is the perfect cover, and he would keep going to work everyday to keep his cover, and use his position and knowledge as a police officer to be even more powerful and in control.There are always things done in films that are unreal and exaggerated.  I don't think we all believe there is an island out there with dinosaurs on it, do we?  I mean Breaking glass at a prison visitation booth, really isn't that far fetched, or unbelievable, now is it?  Maybe some of the scenes were filmed down in LA, but suppose to be San Francisco?  I do know that a lot of it was filmed in the N. California area.  Maybe all the liberal crybabies didn't want a violent film shot in their beautiful city?  Maybe they just thought Frisco had become too gay to shoot in?  Who knows and who cares, that's the least of the problems with the movie!The first film was the perfect buddy flick, and had the perfect combination of humor and drama.  Most would agree, so if you don't you're a minority, and most likely WRONG!  Hell, they wouldn't even have made a sequal if the original wasn't so successful, because it was so well done!  The first is a Classic, and the sequel is noteworthy, and gets better as time goes by.
