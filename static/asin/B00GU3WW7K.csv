1681623,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00GU3WW7K,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","Sometimes, as a reviewer, I tend to get caught up in trying to tell you something to either tweak your interest in a particular project or (the opposite) encourage you not to waste your time.  ANTISOCIAL is one of those films that presents a bit of a quandary because &#8211; in the purest estimation of any critical analysis &#8211; it just isn&#8217;t a very good film.  Oh, that isn&#8217;t to say its incompetent &#8211; all of the players hit their marks (however slim that may be); it&#8217;s lit and photographed well enough; and writer/director Cody Calahan (in what appears to be his first feature) pushes it all forward at an acceptable though what I&#8217;d call &#8216;unseasoned&#8217; pace.  The film ends up possessing a respectable workmanship quality to it despite exploring a relatively half-baked premise that could very well have been conceived by those snotty twins Mark Zuckerberg debatably screwed out of Facebook (it&#8217;s very unkind to a Facebook-like knock-off, suggesting it as responsible for the eventual zombie-style downfall of mankind).(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Five medical students gather for a house party to celebrate New Year&#8217;s Eve, but, outside, the world is gradually starting to fall apart thanks to a curious virus that turns its victims first into killers and then causes their heads to explode (???).  Eventually, the murderous horde will stumble across these five friends.  Will they suffer the same fate?  Tune in yourself and find out.As I said, it gets easy to overthink an analysis of ANTISOCIAL, which wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be fair because it&#8217;s probably a film worth watching: just don&#8217;t ask for all of it to make perfect sense.For example, with society presumably collapsing outside, why is it so quiet so much of the time?  The lead characters (their names and their real life counterparts really aren&#8217;t all that important here as what matters most in horror is the premise and its execution so far as I&#8217;m concerned) are watching our deconstruction on television as well as the internet (the Revolution will be streamed, after all), but it&#8217;s mostly quiet in their neighborhood (which, I guess, is good &#8216;cause somebody&#8217;s filming a movie).  It&#8217;s these kind of plot holes that plague small films like ANTISOCIAL, and they serve to keep it from getting a bigger audience &#8230; which I&#8217;ll suggest it deserves as Calahan&#8217;s direction is actually quite good.As for the actors?  As I suggested, there&#8217;s no stand out performance.  Michelle Mylett isn&#8217;t the worst lead I&#8217;ve seen; the fact that she comes across as Mila Kunis&#8217;s younger, less talented sister doesn&#8217;t hurt.  But the males?  They all blend together seamlessly as they&#8217;re just not given enough scenes to distinguish themselves or the plights they suffer respectively.  I see that more as a script failure than I do their fault.So &#8211; keeping it simple &#8211; let me say this: the script is smart enough at times to make me look past some of the obvious weaknesses, and the performances are interesting enough to do the same.  Sure, I wish it had made more sense, but, at the end of the day, it&#8217;s clearly intended as a satire, so I won&#8217;t belabor the point and will leave it up to you to decide whether or not ANTISOCIAL deserves any greater praise than I was willing to give it.I will add this: based on the overall effort, I&#8217;d definitely be interested in seeing what Calahan can come up with given more time, money, and consideration.ANTISOCIAL is produced by Black Fawn Films and Breakthrough Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through Breaking Glass Pictures.  As for the technical specifications, meh.  It&#8217;s a slightly above-average production: the sounds are mostly solid (though there is some middling quality to a few sequences), but cinematographically it all looks like it was draped in a layer of darkness (a thematic touch?) that just didn&#8217;t do much for me.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re looking for, then you&#8217;re in store for a bit of extra investment: there&#8217;s an audio commentary from director Calahan joined by Cinematographer Jeff Maher; a behind-the-scenes featurette; and a photo gallery.RECOMMENDED.  It&#8217;s become too easy to find fault with every little performance, every little plot-hole, and every little premise &#8230; or so the makers of low-budget horror might have you believe.  For all of its obvious foibles, ANTISOCIAL still manages to serve up some old-fashioned horrors.  Sure, it&#8217;s all movie science and movie medicine, but, when the blood and brains start showing up, you know you might be in for something small and special.  Be warned: you have to get through an awfully long set-up process in order to be rewarded with the last thirty minutes where most of the fun is genuinely at.  Otherwise, you might find it easy to turn this one off about 20 minutes in (like I almost did) &#8230; though the last frame defies all of the movie logic the writer/director proposed earlier in the program.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Breaking Glass Pictures provided me with an advance DVD copy of ANTISOCIAL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Adequate ANTISOCIAL A Respectable First Try At Something Different,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",2014,5731,"['Sometimes', 'reviewer', 'tend', 'get', 'caught', 'up',

1681625,ARMUEUP5JKC0U,B00GU3WW7K,"Gigi Fuerte ""Child of the World""","[0, 1]","First, with the bad schtuff...The acting is mediocre to bleh. The female lead is particularly terrible. I couldn't decide if her lack of peripheral vision and overall inability to notice anything at all that was going on around her was part of the movie's point (i.e. we're all so focused on our iPhones to notice the world around us), or if it was simply bad script-writing. Since many of the characters make absolutely terrible choices in the film (e.g. ""Hey, is that our friend outside exhibiting obvious symptoms of the viral infection? I vote we let him in the house with us!""), I was left with the impression that the female lead's incompetence and self-centeredness had more to do with the lackluster script than any intentional attempt to further bolster the movie's underlying themes. Also, the female lead's acting was Kristen Stewart-esque in every terrible way. In her defense, though, the script and dialog she had to work with weren't particularly phenomenal.Some other examples of head-scratching, what-the-huh? moments in the story that aren't necessarily spoilers but maybe you should skip if you don't want to know much more about the movie:- Who knew that arteries weren't actually connected to anything in the body.- Did ya know that one can die from blood loss if an artery is cut, but that removing one won't have the same deleterious effect? I guess that makes sense since, ya know, arteries aren't connected to anything according to this movie.- When your friend is well on his way to becoming a monster, it's a good idea to *plead* for him to stay locked in the house with you, and to then launch into a monologue that is all about you and how you've suffered so.- When said friend tries to leave the house for the safety of its occupants, stop him from doing so so that you can watch a movie together.- Oh, and since that friend is slowly becoming a deranged monster, *plead* with him to handle power tools around you. Brilliant.&lt;sigh>This movie isn't in the least bit scary or disturbing or creepy. If you're hoping for something in the vein of ""28 Days Later"", this ain't it. This is more like ""The Faculty"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" or whatever ""horror"" movies the young kids might watch nowadays. (As an aside, if you *are* in the mood for scary/disturbing/creepy, I'd recommend the movie ""Open Grave"".)Now on to the good stuff...I quite liked the premise of this film; surprisingly, it's quite believable and it left me to wonder if the virus origin story could, in fact, be happening now in real life. For its thought-provoking premise alone, the movie gets 3 stars.This is an excellent, ""low expectations, rainy Sunday afternoon"" flick.
