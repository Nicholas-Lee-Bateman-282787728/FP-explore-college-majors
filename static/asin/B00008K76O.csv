Some will literally hate Michael Moore for expanding the truth and others will love him for uncovering it.  No matter which you feel, we can all agree that Michael Moore has done one great thing ... he has changed the face of documentary filmmaking.  He has kicked down the door for the possibility of others to release their ""unfundable"" projects that studios now see as moneymakers because of Moore's success.  He has introduced documentaries back into the mainstream cinemas, and perhaps our world is ready for it.  I get tired of watching cartoons on the screen, and cannot wait to get my hands around a juicy documentary whenever it is released.That is why when this series was released on DVD I immediately ran to buy it.  Not only do you get some great Michael Moore moments, but also you get to see avenues of our society that we do not take a moment and look at.  There is a lot of wrong in this world, and especially in America.  Those that are not honest sometimes use to media to change their image and therefore giving us a false sense of security.  Moore, in his short lived series, takes random ideas and sets them in motion.  One of my favorites is the FICA for Congress sketches.  I think I enjoyed it so much because it showed America's reaction to his idea.  He was not alone in this battle, and we knew it.As I stated before, Moore is not for everyone.  He is for the open-minded individual that is not afraid to ask the question ""why"".  This was a beautiful series that has made me happy to see on DVD.  For those that cannot stand his longer films, this would be the perfect venue to view his topics.I do want to say that no matter how you feel about his work, you must first see it before you criticize.  Never judge a book by its cover, and never judge a wealthy politician.  While we will think that life is best here in America, sometimes it takes a lone voice to point out the obvious.  Michael Moore has accepted the challenge, and is forcing Americans to look up instead of burying our faces in our day to day activities.  We have the power to change everything ... let us do it!Overall, this series was nothing short than Moore's brilliance in small snippets.  I think this series should be on everyone's DVD must-see list.Grade:  ***** out of *****",5,The Truth is out there!,1096588800,"10 1, 2004",2004,2371,"['Talk', 'anyone', 'will', 'find', 'mixed', 'bag', 'opinions', 'radical', 'filmmaker', 'work', 'will', 'literally', 'hate', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'expanding', 'truth', 'others', 'will', 'love', 'uncovering', 'No', 'matter', 'feel', 'can', 'agree', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'done', 'one', 'great', 'thing', 'changed', 'face', 'documentary', 'filmmaking', 'kicked', 'down', 'door', 'possibility', 'others', 'release', 'unfundable', 'projects', 'studios', 'now', 'see', 'moneymakers', 'Moore', 'success', 'introduced', 'documentaries', 'back', 'mainstream', 'cinemas', 'perhaps', 'world', 'ready', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'cartoons', 'screen', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'juicy', 'documentary', 'whenever', 'released.That', 'why', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'ran', 'buy', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'great', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'moments', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'avenues', 'society', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'moment', 'look', 'lot', 'wrong', 'world', 'especially', 'America', 'are', 'not', 'honest', 'sometimes', 'use', 'media', 'change', 'image', 'therefore', 'giving', 'false', 'sense', 'security', 'Moore', 'short', 'lived', 'series', 'random', 'ideas', 'sets', 'motion', 'One', 'favorites', 'FICA', 'Congress', 'sketches', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'showed', 'America', 'reaction', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'battle', 'knew', 'it.As', 'stated', 'Moore', 'not', 'everyone', 'open-minded', 'individual', 'not', 'afraid', 'ask', 'question', 'why', 'was', 'beautiful', 'series', 'made', 'happy', 'see', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'longer', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'venue', 'view', 'topics.I', 'do', 'want', 'say', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'work', 'must', 'first', 'see', 'criticize', 'Never', 'judge', 'book', 'cover', 'never', 'judge', 'wealthy', 'politician', 'will', 'think', 'life', 'best', 'here', 'America', 'lone', 'voice', 'point', 'out', 'obvious', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'accepted', 'challenge', 'forcing', 'Americans', 'look', 'up', 'instead', 'burying', 'day', 'day', 'activities', 'have', 'power', 'change', 'everything', 'let', 'do', 'Overall', 'series', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'Moore', 'brilliance', 'small', 'snippets', 'think', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'DVD', 'must-see', 'list.Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

743366,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B00008K76O,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[18, 25]","The Awful Truth by Michael Moore. People wonder what makesMichael Moore so great, simple, hes a guy who has the gutsand heart to tell it like it is. Hes a concerned Americanwhose not going to sit idly by and watch this country down the drain. When Moore first made ""Roger and Me"" in 1989, everyone thought he was crazy. American Greed? No, never they said the critics, downsizing? lol Whats thats? No America will never into the capitalistic greedy nation thats hated by other countries and of course it has sadly.Moore already knew this in 1989 and more than twenty yearslater here we are, with the rich elite and the bureacracyof the Presidency doing nothing, though promising,that theywill do something. Then of course with George W. Bushpreaching about moral values and hiring Christian rightwing evangenlist to sing his praises for money and his campaign...America has really sank to a new low and if we dont do something, things will get bad to worse, and that is what Moore has been saying all his life.The Awful Truth not surprising also exposes lies in societyand exposes several greedy corporation who have axploitedand killed the working man all while preaching famiy valuessince their births: Disney, Phiillip Moorris , Camel, UnitedParcel Service. These are just a couple of companies that Mooreexposes in Season 1 and Season2. The stuff he uncovers isntsurprising, its revolting and sad because these companiesare still in business, still killing the working man.In Season 1 Episode 3 Moore uncovers the shameful history of the Disney company how they hire workers overseas who make products in sweatshops, how Disney mistreats their own employees, all while Michael Eisner profits all the way to the troops. The angle with ""Crackers the Corporate fighting Chicken"" is absolute hilarious. Moore as he does, uses a smart character and a hand held camera to uncover the truth about another corrupt firm.Its used to a get of course and lighten the mood to a verysad matter, corporate greed, but Moore as often he doesbrilliantly brings home his points.Yes these are shades of General Motors just in the documentary Roger and Me in this episode, this again its one of thesupposed family organizations out there. Man what a lie that is. Most people dont know that the former Ceo Michael Eisner is involved in a lawsuit with one of his former friends.As Moore uncovers back in 1999, Eisner was makig $60,000 an hour!!! Yet the exploited workers overseas were making thirtycents a day!!!Season one is absolutely brilliant, Moore also paints an ugly picture of George W. Bush and the Republicans, in only more Americans werent brainwashed by this party, perhaps the problemsof the world and 9/11 would not have happened.In episode Four Moore targets another supposed squeaky cleanimage of the UPS and uncovers employees bullying, and employeecuts and practices all while the company was posting a profit,yes shades of General Motors.The highlight of Season one for me was when Moore took a bunchof victims who used to chain smoke and made them sing Christmas Carol's inside the buildings of well known tobacco and cigarette making companies like Phillip Moore and Camel who for years lied and sayed that smoking wasnt harmful and it doesnt damage your body or throat.What a bold face American lie and Moore even goes to the troubleof airing ads in the fifties that show that this lie has been going for ages, its true enlighting as it is englighting and disgusting.Everyone should see this series from Bravo tv, it was a gemof a series and its a pity that it has gotten the recognitionit deserves because its a great series.

Moore tackles serious problems in US society with his inimmitable humour. I think I liked the first season best, when he is on stage in Chicago, his interaction with the audience is fantastic. Moore understands better than most that laughter is a very potent weapon, and also because his targets are such bores! Who can forget the episode of the Sodomobile, where he packs a pink RV with gays, and goes and confronts southern bigots? Or when the dying little girl is granted a last wish to dress in a white hood, and light cross outside the house of an inter-racial couple? As with all good humour, it is very serious beneath. Moore tries to help us see how laughable the right-wing groups that try to usurp the US are. Moore is never aggressive, he talks to everyone, and tries to help them see the errors of their ways. Too bad so few want to talk to him! He must have thicker skin than a rhino.

Palmer,"[69, 85]","First, I just want to say that I tend to be politically conservative, but I usually enjoy Michael Moore's work for what it is - entertainment engineered with a political slant. It's nothing more and nothing less than that.That said, these reviews should be for Michael Moore's show &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. I have watched almost all of these episodes for the show's two year run. The first year's shows were shot before a live audience and you can hear the audience laughing at Moore's clips. The second year of shows were filmed in Times Square with no audience. The episodes for the first year were more humorous, with the majority of the clips focused on corporate issues and crooks. Highlights include a group of people who had lost their voice boxes to cancer from smoking singing Christmas carols to tabacco companies and their lobbyists, Moore's trek to many Manpower temporary offices to see how the employees would react to his visit (since Moore got his hands on an internal memo from Manpower instructing employees how to deal with Moore if he showed up to their offices) and the adventures of Crackers the Crime Fighting Chicken at Disney World. There were many enjoyable moments in the first season of shows.The second season, maybe because there is no audience, seems much, much darker than the first. Not a lot of laughs in the second year. As an example, a story is done about a healthcare facility that had been fined for poor care of the elderly. One of Moore's reporters gets a group of elderly folks together and takes them to a martial arts instructor for lessons. The newly trained elderly martial arts masters are then taken to the offices of said healthcare provider to show them what they can expect if they ever try to mistreat older people in the future. And we are treated to a display of 75+ year old people trying to do punches and leg kicks. It was actually so ridiculous that it was painful to watch. There's many more misses than hits in year two, which probably explains why there was no year three.I would recommend the first year of shows for anybody who enjoys a little over-the-top political and corporate humor. The second year is a little harder to recommend. It just isn't that funny, in general.",3,Read this Review!

Not because of what he believes in, as I am sure there are millions out there who share these beliefs(his chart topping books and films attest to that),it is rather because of his more than a decade long unrelenting dedication to get his message through to as many viewers and readers as he possibly can,with a rare sense purpose,irony,and  poignant sarcasm.He is concerned about many issues that he finds are wrong with American society, from guns, corrupt politicians, greedy corporations and unfounded or distorted myths about minorities be it African Americans or gays.The Awful Truth is his successful TV series, produced for UK's channel 4, and in which not only he addresses yet again the issues he feels so strongly about,but most importantly and this is vital, he CONFRONTS them as well in any way he feels possible,of course all dressed up nicely in his unwavering humour.I see Michael Moore as a sort of modern day Robin Hood, for although he does not steal from the rich to give to the poor,he rather exposes, embarasses the priviledged few and present it to the ordinary man and woman.For example the episode where he tries to help the illegal Mexicans who were about to be deported because the hotel they worked for informed the INS on them after they formed a union (and not before!) and succeeding in not only keeping the illegals in the country after petitions, but getting his own back at the hotel for violation of health and building codes, this was a triumph for the underdog against the double standards and exploitation they faced.Or the episode where he stages a fake funeral for a dying man who needs a life saving transplant his insurance company refuses to pay for, while exposing the huge profits that company made. When the comapny finally agrees to cover the operation and the patient in the audience greets Moore with tears in his eyes, this too is a huge triumph.In this sense I see him as a modern Robin Hood.Awful is the last word to describe this wonderful series..It will make you laugh your head off, while opening your eyes and thinking..hard..",5,Sherwood Forest in Times Square,1064361600,"09 24, 2003",2003,2147,"['Michael', 'Moore', 'very', 'unique', 'individual', 'film-maker', 'writer', 'Not', 'what', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'millions', 'who', 'share', 'beliefs', 'chart', 'topping', 'books', 'films', 'attest', 'rather', 'more', 'decade', 'long', 'unrelenting', 'dedication', 'get', 'message', 'through', 'many', 'viewers', 'readers', 'possibly', 'can', 'rare', 'sense', 'purpose', 'irony', 'poignant', 'sarcasm.He', 'concerned', 'many', 'issues', 'are', 'wrong', 'American', 'society', 'guns', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'greedy', 'corporations', 'unfounded', 'distorted', 'myths', 'minorities', 'be', 'African', 'Americans', 'gays.The', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'successful', 'TV', 'series', 'produced', 'UK', 'channel', '4', 'not', 'only', 'yet', 'again', 'issues', 'so', 'strongly', 'most', 'importantly', 'vital', 'as', 'well', 'way', 'possible', 'course', 'dressed', 'up', 'nicely', 'unwavering', 'humour.I', 'see', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'not', 'steal', 'rich', 'give', 'poor', 'rather', 'priviledged', 'few', 'present', 'ordinary', 'man', 'woman.For', 'example', 'episode', 'where', 'help', 'illegal', 'Mexicans', 'who', 'were', 'about', 'be', 'deported', 'hotel', 'worked', 'informed', 'INS', 'formed', 'union', 'not', 'succeeding', 'not', 'only', 'keeping', 'illegals', 'country', 'petitions', 'getting', 'own', 'back', 'hotel', 'violation', 'health', 'building', 'codes', 'was', 'triumph', 'underdog', 'double', 'standards', 'exploitation', 'faced.Or', 'episode', 'where', 'fake', 'funeral', 'dying', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'saving', 'transplant', 'insurance', 'company', 'pay', 'exposing', 'huge', 'profits', 'company', 'made', 'When', 'comapny', 'finally', 'cover', 'operation', 'patient', 'audience', 'greets', 'Moore', 'tears', 'eyes', 'too', 'huge', 'triumph.In', 'sense', 'see', 'modern', 'Robin', 'Hood.Awful', 'last', 'word', 'describe', 'wonderful', 'series..It', 'will', 'make', 'head', 'opening', 'eyes', 'thinking..hard..']",N/A

743376,A1GF4BH6WPBZ4Y,B00008K76O,Roman Pennington,"[16, 18]","I recently purchased this set because I had never seen the show in my area.  Unlike many of Moore's more recent work, ""The Awful Truth"" is less partisian and more eloquently zeroes in on the issues that form the nucleus of Moore's agenda, which is about people and not parties.  In fact, this series, most of which was produced while Clinton was in the White House, often targets the democrats and issues surrounding Clinton or the government's policy.  Unlike his opponents, Michael Moore is not blindly allied to any political party as evidenced in this series.That's not to say Moore doesn't have an agenda, or doesn't tackle controversial issues.  He most certainly does.  And he demonstrates how intelligent and creative he is in touching upon very sensitive issues, making people think, via humor.The first episode of ""The Awful Truth"" is a great example. It consists of two segments.  In the first one, Michael addresses the overblown Starr investigation against Clinton (which cost taxpayers $50+ million) and proposes that if the Republicans want a ""witch hunt"", he can do it cheaper and more efficiently, and that's exactly what he does.  Hilarity ensues as Moore assembles a group of Salem-era ""pilgrims"" in period costume to parade across capital hill passing judgement on the plethora of hypocritical adulterous politicians.  Do not drink any liquids while viewing this segment or they'll end up all over your living room -- you've been warned.The second segment is even more powerful, and it's required watching for anyone who is prejudiced against Michael Moore.  I showed this clip to a friend who ""hates"" Moore and at the end she was crying.  Her opinion of the man will forever be changed.  That's how powerful the segment is, where Michael Moore follows a young man who's HMO refused to pay for an operation he needs to save his life, and Michael and his people descend upon the corporate offices vowing to not give up until this young man gets the pancreas transplant he desperately needs.  In the end, Michael wins, the young man's life is saved, and the HMO reverses their policy on this issue.  It's clear evidence that Michael Moore has actually saved at least one man's life, and who knows how many others through his lobbying for humane healthcare policies.  I challenge anyone to watch this segment and content that Michael Moore isn't one of the true people left who is really looking out for the common man.  NOBODY who can malign the man could possibly have viewed this segment.That's just the first two spots on this extensive DVD collection.

Now most people want to ignore the truth and stay locked in their happy bubbles. Michael Moore is here to pop those bubbles, and it is about time someone did. This series is a great place to start, since it is not too much information at once when taken episode by episode. As a whole, this program is powerful, revealing, sometimes shocking, and always entertaining. The point here is to THINK, not to accept blindly. This should be required viewing for everyone.",5,can't handle the truth?,1089072000,"07 6, 2004",2004,1380,"['feel', 'overwhelming', 'sadness', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'polarized', 'convictions', 'daddies', 'instilled', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'agenda', 'true', 'also', 'only', 'facts', 'TRUTH', 'lies', 'check', 'out', 'Rush', 'Limbagh', 'Fox', 'News', 'channel', 'Anyone', 'shopping', 'Amazon', 'free', 'country', 'duty', 'free', 'people', 'think', 'look', 'sides', 'issue', 'most', 'America', 'do', 'so', 'travesty', 'heart', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'documentaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'agree', 'everything', 'have', 'be', 'open', 'being', 'challenged', 'facts', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'exposed', 'have', 'realize', 'sometimes', 'gasp', 'powers', 'be', 'LIE', 'Once', 'time', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'were', 'hailed', 'duty', 'people', 'when', 'uncovered', 'hidden', 'truths', 'such', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'Now', 'most', 'people', 'want', 'ignore', 'truth', 'stay', 'locked', 'happy', 'bubbles', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'here', 'pop', 'bubbles', 'time', 'someone', 'did', 'series', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'once', 'when', 'taken', 'episode', 'episode', 'whole', 'program', 'powerful', 'revealing', 'sometimes', 'shocking', 'always', 'entertaining', 'point', 'here', 'THINK', 'not', 'accept', 'blindly', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'everyone']",N/A

I'll try again...I watched the series over a few months so I'll be a little light on detail anyway.If you're looking for comic relief, this series is a good one. I liked, for example, Moore's pilgrim staff proclaiming Ken Starr's eternal damnation, or the Rudy Guiliani porn shop in New York. Then there's the gay guys in the van dancing before the preacher who is, to put it in a very, very diplomatic way, anti-gay.There's some useful information to learn too. For example, while I knew the US has overwhelmed other countries in terms of the number of people in prison, Michael puts it in a comical context: a county in Virginia whose population has increased dramatically because of the prison(s) being constructed there, and providing a new base for the county's economy.Then there's the story of the CEO, paying himself $94 million a year, and a pension of $8 million a year at retirement, while his employee of 30 years is making a pension of barely $500 a month. In the meantime, the CEO is praised by the business press as epitomizing the great corporate chief, while the company is under indictment for several environmental violations, and he's laid off 50,000 American workers for cheaper overseas labor. It's an eye opener.Overall, though, I find Moore to be a little postmodernist for my tastes. An admittedely over-simplified summary of post-modernism to me is that the world is run primarily by Caucasian, male, heterosexuals. To break from any of those ""paradigms"" then is superior to the post-modernist school of thought. With that I strongly disagree. First, beyond any doubt the worst, most oppressive boss I ever had was a woman, and arguably the second worst (at least the most corrupt) was a black woman. In addition, some of the most conservative individuals I know are gay.In this series, Moore implies what I suggest is post-modernism. That I cannot take seriously.So, if you like Michael Moore's work--as I do--and want to laugh at what amounts to be a series of political satires, this series is for you. If you're expecting to take time in your graduate political science course with a little political education, this isn't for you.",3,Comical Moore,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,2276,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Amazon.com', 'did', ""n't"", 'print', 'first', 'review', 'set', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'specific', ""'ll"", 'try', 'again', 'watched', 'series', 'few', 'months', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'little', 'light', 'detail', 'anyway.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'comic', 'relief', 'series', 'good', 'one', 'liked', 'example', 'Moore', 'pilgrim', 'staff', 'proclaiming', 'Ken', 'Starr', 'eternal', 'damnation', 'Rudy', 'Guiliani', 'porn', 'shop', 'New', 'York', 'Then', 'gay', 'guys', 'van', 'dancing', 'preacher', 'who', 'put', 'very', 'very', 'diplomatic', 'way', 'useful', 'information', 'learn', 'too', 'example', 'knew', 'US', 'overwhelmed', 'other', 'countries', 'terms', 'number', 'people', 'prison', 'Michael', 'comical', 'context', 'county', 'Virginia', 'population', 'increased', 'dramatically', 'prison', 's', 'being', 'constructed', 'there', 'providing', 'new', 'base', 'county', 'economy.Then', 'story', 'CEO', 'paying', '94', 'million', 'year', 'pension', '8', 'million', 'year', 'retirement', 'employee', '30', 'years', 'making', 'pension', 'barely', '500', 'month', 'meantime', 'CEO', 'praised', 'business', 'press', 'epitomizing', 'great', 'corporate', 'chief', 'company', 'indictment', 'several', 'environmental', 'violations', 'laid', 'off', '50,000', 'American', 'workers', 'cheaper', 'overseas', 'labor', 'eye', 'opener.Overall', 'find', 'Moore', 'be', 'little', 'postmodernist', 'tastes', 'admittedely', 'over-simplified', 'summary', 'post-modernism', 'world', 'run', 'primarily', 'Caucasian', 'male', 'heterosexuals', 'break', 'paradigms', 'then', 'superior', 'post-modernist', 'school', 'thought', 'strongly', 'disagree', 'First', 'doubt', 'worst', 'most', 'oppressive', 'boss', 'ever', 'had', 'was', 'woman', 'arguably', 'second', 'worst', 'least', 'most', 'corrupt', 'was', 'black', 'woman', 'addition', 'most', 'conservative', 'individuals', 'know', 'are', 'gay.In', 'series', 'Moore', 'what', 'suggest', 'post-modernism', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'seriously.So', 'like', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'work', 'do', 'want', 'laugh', 'what', 'amounts', 'be', 'series', 'political', 'satires', 'series', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'take', 'time', 'graduate', 'political', 'science', 'course', 'little', 'political', 'education', ""n't""]",N/A

If they had, they would have to agree that hounding an HMO until they pay for the necessary medical care of a dying man (who had payed for his health care for years) is quite impressive.  Michael Moore saved the man's life!  That is just one of the many issues Michale Moore took on during the running of this show.  There are a few shows I could see where someone who is conservitive in their politics would not agree with.  Those were not mentined in the negative reviews--so, again, I know they didn't watch.Listen to those of us who HAVE watched the show.  There is humor.  There are some serious stories.
