Nice, easy-to-do warm-up movements without the bar followed by what I find to be unique exercises using the upright bar for support, balance and toning.  This is really good for the legs, hips, and things which I have not found in other bar-type workouts I purchased.",5,"Finally, A Great Upright Bar-Type Workout!",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,366,"['great', 'workout', 'beginners', 'exercises', 'using', 'upright', 'bar', 'support', 'Nice', 'easy-to-do', 'warm-up', 'movements', 'bar', 'followed', 'what', 'find', 'be', 'unique', 'exercises', 'using', 'upright', 'bar', 'support', 'balance', 'toning', 'really', 'good', 'legs', 'hips', 'things', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'other', 'bar-type', 'workouts', 'purchased']",N/A

870882,AISN5WRFPY1LT,B0006KZD1U,Kathleen M. Lehman,"[2, 2]","I really like the Firm workouts.  I've used them off and on over the past few years.  Now that I'm &#34;on&#34; again, I wanted the shorter duration workouts due to work and class constraints on my time.  If time permits, I'll do 15 - 20 minutes on the treadmill or the elliptcial, then pop a 30-minute workout in the DVD player which gets me up to the 45-minute range.  Yes, these Firm workouts are equipment-intensive, but I've accumulated most of it over the years so that's not an issue.  I've got another sculpting stick workout that I alternate with this one, along with the balance ball, express full body workouts, and small weighted ball routines.  Pam's a great instructor and this one (for me) is challenging.  Some general comments regarding all Firm workouts: 1) recommend keeping the remote nearby because some of the transitions are quick and I can't get myself in position, properly, to execute the moves without risk of injury - pause, get in position, continue; 2) keep a floor mat nearby - my knees are not as young as they used to be and I really need the cushioning (again, keep that remote handy).  It's great that these have come down in price and are readily available on Amazon.  That enables me to have many to choose from so I don't get bored with any one.  I do have some of the older 50+ minute workouts, but I find these shorter ones much more enjoyable - they move through the muscle groups quicker, yet target them effectively so you can feel the results that day and the next.",5,Great workout,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1509,"['really', 'Firm', ""'ve"", 'used', 'off', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Now', ""'m"", '34', '34', 'again', 'wanted', 'shorter', 'duration', 'workouts', 'due', 'work', 'class', 'constraints', 'time', 'time', ""'ll"", 'do', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'treadmill', 'elliptcial', 'then', '30-minute', 'workout', 'DVD', 'player', '45-minute', 'range', 'Yes', 'Firm', 'workouts', 'are', 'equipment-intensive', ""'ve"", 'accumulated', 'most', 'years', 'not', 'issue', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sculpting', 'stick', 'alternate', 'one', 'balance', 'ball', 'full', 'body', 'workouts', 'small', 'weighted', 'ball', 'routines', 'Pam', 'great', 'instructor', 'one', 'challenging', 'general', 'comments', 'regarding', 'Firm', '1', 'recommend', 'keeping', 'remote', 'nearby', 'transitions', 'are', 'quick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'position', 'properly', 'execute', 'moves', 'risk', 'injury', 'pause', 'get', 'position', 'continue', '2', 'keep', 'floor', 'mat', 'nearby', 'knees', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'young', 'used', 'be', 'really', 'need', 'cushioning', 'again', 'keep', 'remote', 'handy', 'great', 'have', 'come', 'down', 'price', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'Amazon', 'have', 'many', 'choose', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'one', 'do', 'have', 'older', '50+', 'minute', 'workouts', 'find', 'shorter', 'ones', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'move', 'muscle', 'groups', 'quicker', 'yet', 'target', 'effectively', 'can', 'feel', 'results', 'day', 'next']",N/A

Legs really got worked on which is good. I cant say that I was wheezing or that like some of the other firms but for a 35 minute work out I felt really good afterwards! would recommend.,5,trying something new,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,326,"['loved', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'was', 'just', 'stick', 'equipment', 'could', 'use', 'broomstick', 'as', 'well', 'worked', 'entire', 'body', 'Legs', 'really', 'got', 'worked', 'good', 'cant', 'say', 'was', 'wheezing', 'other', 'firms', '35', 'minute', 'work', 'felt', 'really', 'good', 'afterwards', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A
