If a rating or a warning was present indicating the presence of foul language I would simply have turned it off.  Since I wasted my money and time on a movie of this nature I feel cheated.  I stopped it after playing only a short time.  It's a shame but this is just another movie with great acting and a real message that's trashed up and it had real potential.,1,not appropriate for family; excessive profanity,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,506,"['Several', 'uses', 'F', 'word', 'short', 'time', 'milder', 'still', 'unacceptable', 'profanity', 'make', 'movie', 'unsuitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'rating', 'warning', 'was', 'present', 'indicating', 'presence', 'foul', 'language', 'would', 'simply', 'have', 'turned', 'off', 'wasted', 'money', 'time', 'movie', 'nature', 'feel', 'cheated', 'stopped', 'playing', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'shame', 'just', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'real', 'message', 'trashed', 'up', 'had', 'real', 'potential']",Gospel Hill
1220321,A22RZG1NQ0WAUX,B001NLJ3O4,Katrina L. Burchett,"[36, 36]","Gospel Hill is a community in the small town of Julia. The people there have lived in their homes for generations. The Valley Corporation plans to build on Gospel Hill, so they want to buy these people out, not caring that many of them have no place else to go. Displacing an African-American community means nothing to these developers, while profiting from the new homes and golf course they plan to build means everything. That is called ""the love of money"", which is the root of all evil.Instead of fighting to save Gospel Hill, Dr. Ron Palmer (Giancarlo Esposito) joins the developers, making money by taking advantage of the less fortunate and calling it opportunity. Sarah Malcolm (Angela Bassett) takes a stand against the Valley Corporation. Her husband, John (Danny Glover) shows very little support. He lost his passion to fight for what's right years ago when his father, Paul, was gunned down and left to bleed to death in the street. The 40th anniversary of his father's death is approaching but he's not sure he can bring himself to attend the ceremony to honor Paul Malcolm's legacy. John has to work through the pain he's been feeling for so long. Will he do it in time to save his wife, whose life is in danger?This movie goes from present to past. The past focuses on Paul Malcolm (Samuel L. Jackson), an activist for social justice, and it's filmed in black & white - nice effect.There wasn't as much intensity as I expected for a movie dealing with racial issues, and that was fine because although I was a bit bothered by some of the content I wasn't left feeling angry.Not a whole lot of profanity. Sex scenes weren't graphic. Love Angela Bassett and the strong woman she portrayed. Church scene was touching.
