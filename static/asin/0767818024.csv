And always have up till the day I got it because now I can watch it over, and over, and over again and it still cracks me up everytime. With that aside and Mark Wahlberg being one of my most favorite male actors-- this movie was topnotch in the very element it was supposed to be, a hard-hitting action movie with some right down comedy. It's not a movie to be taken seriously, but not a movie to let you down either of its mockery-- top notch acting and reasons why Mark Wahlberg, as an action star actor can do comedy, unlike Densel Washington who's even asked Jay Leno on his show why he couldn't do comedy, the response was because Densel was just too serious to be taken lightly. Here though, whether this wasn't a role Mark fit ideally to some peeople's benefit of his other marks; I still think it was one hell of a role for him that he did EXTREMELY well as the soft-spoken hitmen who could do everything right but has the incredible turn of luck to always get the crap end of the stick at times.Good movie.Good laughs.Good times.Even my fiancee enjoyed it and she'd never seen the movie up till I showed her some days ago!

14354,A364W6U6YL219D,0767818024,"Craig Edwards ""Media Guy""","[3, 3]","The Big Hit (1998) Poor Mark Wahlberg. He just wants everyone to like him, but when you're a contract killer with a money grubbing fiancee (Christina Applegate), a greedy girlfriend (Lela Rochon), a tough no-nonsense boss (Avery Brooks) and a weaselly coworker (Lou Diamond Phillips) who'd sell his mom for a quick buck, you're not likely to find yourself a happy man. So goes the plot of this goofy action comedy from the producers of Broken Arrow. Though the script to this is at times amusing, with assassins who pause in the middle of a hit for a coffee break, and Wahlberg forced to extreme slapstick measures to keep a kidnap victim he's been stuck with hidden from his fiancee and her stereotypical Jewish parents (Lainie Kazan and Elliot Gould), it also gets smug in its attempts to be hip, which works against the movie as a whole. Also, it's lucky this is a comedy, because while there is some good stuntwork involved, too many scenes are cartoonishly computer assisted to be taken seriously at all. If you see this in the right frame of mind it would probably tickle you, but if not it'll more likely annoy you. If you do see it, you will have to give Lou Diamond Phillips some points for pulling out all the stops as the flamboyantly flaky Chico.

14358,A3L2U581LL17EB,0767818024,Eric,"[14, 14]","I remember first seeing the previews for The Big Hit and thinking to myself, &quot;this is going to be one terrible film.&quot; Then I actually rented it, and found myself enjoying the movie immensely. Oh, it's one silly action film, but it's fun usually for all the right reasons, so that's why I'm recommending it. And this says a lot, believe me, because I find 3/4's of the movie's cast utterly revolting (Antonio Sabato, Jr., Christina Applegate, Bokeem Woodbine, Lela Rochon, and Elliot Gould all in the same movie, and I still somehow enjoyed it).Mark Wahlberg stars as Melvin Smiley, a hitman with a heart of gold, sort of. Outside of his dubious career, he's a relatively nice guy with an airhead fiancee (Applegate). Anyway, his hitman buddies, specifically Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips), devise a plan to kidnap Keiko Nishi (China Chow), the daughter of a super-rich Japanese businessman, not knowing the man has just went bankrupt (shown in a hilarious scene). Anyway, they have to store Keiko at Melvin's house, and he's forgotten that his fiancee and her parents are visiting for the weekend. To make matters worse, Keiko is the goddaughter of the hitmen's boss, Paris (Avery Brooks), who's looking to crack down on the guys who kidnapped her.The Big Hit desires to work as an action and comedy, and succeeds quite well at both. The shootouts are pure Hong Kong-style (no surprise, it's directed by Kirk Wong), outrageous but cool to watch. The fight scenes are kinetic and well-choreographed, with the performers displaying some nice, agile moves without really going into all-out martial arts (by this, I'm referring to the final fight in the video store). None of the action is superspectacular or completely memorable, but it's all exciting and lots of fun, which is what it should be.Director Kirk Wong also shows a capbable hand at humor. For once, the majority of the film's jokes actually work. Even a long-running gag involving Melvin and his overdue rental of King Kong Lives pays off in the end. A lot of people are going to find this humor stupid, but for me, it was stupid and funny. Some of these jokes probably wouldn't naturally be funny, but the cast (particularly Lou Diamond Phillips) pulls them off with a great sense of comic timing. Hell, I even laughed during that obvious &quot;tracebuster&quot; joke.As I said before, most of the cast members are those I generally try to avoid when I watch movies and they're terrible here, but they're offset by the film's leads, thankfully. Mark Wahlberg is not a great actor by any stretch of the imagination, but he's likeable and perfect for this part. The lovely China Chow is a spirited foil for Wahlberg, she's smart, funny, and sassy, and also the film's most genuinely likeable character. Naturally, the film progresses by developing some romantic chemistry between her and Wahlberg, and to my surprise, those scenes actually work.Stealing virtually the whole film is Lou Diamond Phillips (who I've always liked), who's hilarious as the two-timing hitman Cisco. Off the top of my head, I believe this is his only comic performance to date, and he's so good at it, I wish he'd delve into the genre more often.

But for some reason, either by merit of the film itself or some fluke in my taste, I like THE BIG HIT. If the former is true, here is why.There are those of us who peruse the direct-to-video bins of action and horror movies in a desparate search of fun. THE BIG HIT, although released theatrically, is everything that you desire while looking at direct-to-video crap, but never get, and its infinitly better.Make no mistakes: this movie is vulgar, crass, and shameless. It even crossed my line with the vomiting scene, but I managed. The film finds hit man Melvin Smiley set up to take the fall for a major screw-up by his hipster co-workers whilst dealing with being a pushover to his fiancee and girlfriend.Maybe the fact that this film has such a plot, a plot that is relevant to the action and interesting is what makes it exciting. The characters are stimulating and provided vibrant dialogue. Through the pretty routine directing, it's Ben Ramseys script that makes the thing so fun. The action sequences are pretty by the numbers, as I've mentioned, but there are moments or rhythm and  sublime carnage beneath the rest of it.The film has a hard-hitting and pulsating score by Graeme Revell, which is also notable in its genre for its themes and concentration on doing more than making noise.Be warned: those who do not tolerate profanity, violence, and general disregard for morals (these are hit men, after all) should not view. If you do not fall into that category, and like a bit of ultra-violence brimming with wit and style, there is a very good chance you will like this movie, and almost NO chance that you will regret seeing it.Or like I said, it might have just been a fluke in my tastes...",4,What can I say?

Used and exploited by the others, as well as his two manipulative girlfriends, Mel enjoys all the victory but none of the spoils.  When the others in his group want to branch off into kidnapping, Mel's dire financial situation plays his hand for him.  Little does he know, the group's target, Keiko Nishi (China Chow), has a father with epic connections.The Stockholm Syndrome similarities toThe Chaseare strong.  The former stars Charlie Sheen winning! throughout a fairly serious, albeit unbelievable film.  The latter has a subplot involving the late rental return of King Kong Lives to Big Top Video, a less than desirable establishment with rude nerds wielding late fees like video game weapons.  I'll let you figure out which one is the more believable out of the two.Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate, Lela Rochon, and Avery Brooks round out the cast.  LDP plays Cisco, a ruthless killer who uses Mel's insecurities and tendency to whisper to take center stage and extols his own virtues at every turn.Ultimately this is a fun movie.  If not taken too seriously there are enough fights, guns blasting, and cars racing to qualify as an action film.  With a few comedic insertions, mostly from Bokeem Woodbine, there is enough levity to balance the see-saw away from seriousness.If not for the aforementioned bizarre balance, watch it for a ridiculous remake of the famous clay pot scene from Ghost.  The primary difference is that Mel and Keiko are cooking chicken, not molding a pot.  Also, Mel is fisting the chicken with a messy handful of stuffing.

It is a very stylish movie with the action scenes having lots of crazy jumps, flips, and explosions. In here we have Mel, played by Mark Wahlberg, who is a hit man who works as part of a crew for Paris. However he has money problems and stress that gives him a constant upset stomach. His main stress comes from his two women. His fianc&eacute; has arranged for her disapproving parents to come to stay with them for the weekend, while his girlfriend Chantel is determined to get every penny she can out of him. When Cisco offers him a job outside of Paris's contracts he takes it and kidnaps Keiko, the daughter of a rich industrialist who also happens to be Paris's goddaughter. Betrayed by Cisco, Mel finds himself with the hostage but also targeted by plenty of firepower.I've seen this couple of times and fine it worthwhile. The plot is silly but could have worked, however the action scenes don't really have any character and are best described as functional rather than special. The director has chosen to give the film a constant energy and pace rather than work on giving the film it's own character or style. Some of the scenes hint at what could have worked in the script. Quiet scenes between Mel and Keiko show a character that should have been worked into the action better. Instead these are rare and make way for meaningless, overblown action sequences which also, surprisingly for Wong, lack a sense of character or excitement. The effects aren't as good as you'd hope and several blue screen bits are poor.Wahlberg is likeable in a goofy innocent role as Mel. He does well with the action as well as the insecure character. Phillips is either bad or brilliant depending on your feelings about what his role needed. He hams it up so much that at times he's hard to take but he compliments the absurd vein of comedy running through the narrative. Woodbine is wasted despite an amusing running gag about his discovery of [...]. The biggest waste for me was Lela Rochon. In `Knock Off' she proved that she is talented and sexy enough to rise above a bad film, here she hardly has any screen time - another example of wasted talent.However this is disposal more than anything else. It has enough pace and energy to fool you into being entertained and in fairness the time does pass quite easily. My only complaint is that the film's style goes overboard towards the end of the movie, watch it and you'll see what I mean.

I think so.I'm not quite sure how to describe this movie. It's about a likeable hitman, who kicks serious butt and racks up a huge body count, but he's the only person we care about in the movie. His co-horts are untrustworthy and (gasp!) lazy, and his two girlfriends are both horrid in their own special ways.The movie is an action comedy...but not in the way we might expect (a la Rush Hour or its ilk). It is obvious the budget was low, so the makers of the film decided the whole tone of the film should be cheesy.But almost everyone in the movie gets into the style of silliness, and thus a non-finicky viewer has an amusing 90 minutes. Here's one example of the ever-shifting tone: Mark Wahlberg (our likable hit man) is coming home to his fiancee (Christina Applegate...a jewish princess with an over-the-top accent and really tight pants). He is driving with a chopped up body in the trunk, and pulls into his suburban driveway...except its not his house, just one that looks exactly like all the other houses in the neighborhood. Someone yells out ""Wrong house!"" and Wahlberg pulls back out and into the right driveway. The scene takes about three seconds, but it's funny because it's incongruous. How many hit men live in suburbia...at least in movies?Everyone in the movie is WAY OVER THE TOP in their performances. Lanie Kazan actually seems reserved...if that gives you an idea. Elliott Gould is totally gross and very funny. Bokeem Woodbine is amusing in the role of a thug with a fixation on masturbation. Lou Diamond Phillips is totally unlikeable as a character, but gosh darn it, he sures seems to be having fun. The whole film is a lark.It also plays right into Mark Wahlberg's strengths. Wahlberg seems to have the ""nice guy"" act down very well. It's why Boogie Nights worked so well...he was just so innocent and likeable. In PERFECT STORM and THREE KINGS, it was his innocent nature that worked for him. As soon as he starts getting serious or pensive or angry...it stops working. And in FEAR, with Reese Witherspoon, he tries sinister and comes off silly. He takes the ""aw shucks"" nice guy attitude to the nth degree in THE BIG HIT, and we really root for him.This is not a movie for film ""criticism."" It would totally fall apart under scrutiny, whether for logic, continuity or artistry. But if you're in the mood just to have a little fun, and like guns going off, and cars crashing, and a bit of satire while you're at it...you could do worse.",3,MUCH MORE FUN THAT IT should BE!!!,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2592,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'IS', 'RATED', 'PGIs', 'film', 'flawed', 'Oh', 'YEAH', 'Are', 'there', 'ridiculous', 'lapses', 'logic', 'bet', 'fun', 'think', 'so.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'how', 'describe', 'movie', 'likeable', 'hitman', 'who', 'serious', 'butt', 'up', 'huge', 'body', 'count', 'only', 'person', 'care', 'movie', 'co-horts', 'are', 'untrustworthy', 'gasp', 'lazy', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'horrid', 'own', 'special', 'ways.The', 'movie', 'action', 'comedy', 'not', 'way', 'might', 'expect', 'la', 'Rush', 'Hour', 'ilk', 'obvious', 'budget', 'was', 'low', 'makers', 'film', 'decided', 'whole', 'tone', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'cheesy.But', 'almost', 'everyone', 'movie', 'style', 'silliness', 'thus', 'non-finicky', 'viewer', 'amusing', '90', 'minutes', 'Here', 'one', 'example', 'ever-shifting', 'tone', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'likable', 'hit', 'man', 'coming', 'home', 'fiancee', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'jewish', 'princess', 'over-the-top', 'accent', 'really', 'tight', 'pants', 'driving', 'chopped', 'up', 'body', 'trunk', 'suburban', 'driveway', 'not', 'house', 'just', 'one', 'exactly', 'other', 'houses', 'neighborhood', 'Someone', 'out', 'Wrong', 'house', 'Wahlberg', 'back', 'out', 'right', 'driveway', 'scene', 'three', 'seconds', 'funny', 'incongruous', 'How', 'many', 'hit', 'men', 'live', 'suburbia', 'least', 'movies', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'WAY', 'THE', 'TOP', 'performances', 'Lanie', 'Kazan', 'actually', 'reserved', 'idea', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'totally', 'gross', 'very', 'funny', 'Bokeem', 'Woodbine', 'amusing', 'role', 'thug', 'fixation', 'masturbation', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Phillips', 'totally', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'darn', 'be', 'having', 'fun', 'whole', 'film', 'lark.It', 'also', 'right', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'strengths', 'Wahlberg', 'have', 'nice', 'guy', 'act', 'down', 'very', 'well', 'why', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'innocent', 'likeable', 'PERFECT', 'STORM', 'THREE', 'KINGS', 'was', 'innocent', 'nature', 'worked', 'As', 'soon', 'getting', 'serious', 'pensive', 'angry', 'working', 'FEAR', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'sinister', 'off', 'silly', 'aw', 'shucks', 'nice', 'guy', 'attitude', 'nth', 'degree', 'THE', 'BIG', 'HIT', 'really', 'root', 'him.This', 'not', 'movie', 'film', 'criticism', 'would', 'totally', 'fall', 'apart', 'scrutiny', 'logic', 'continuity', 'artistry', ""'re"", 'mood', 'just', 'have', 'little', 'fun', 'guns', 'going', 'off', 'cars', 'crashing', 'bit', 'satire', ""'re"", 'could', 'do', 'worse']",N/A

Can't be compared to Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, but on its own, it is an entertaining film because all the characters and some of the situation devices are treated as a cartoon rather than a serious gangster flick. Mark Wahlberg, a mild mannered hitman, situated in middle suburbia, is forced to do a side job (a kidnapping)to make some quick cash to support a girlfriend and a fiance.  The kidnapping job goes all wrong, and that's when the absurdity of the movie goes into full gear and some hilarious slapstick action occurs. Lou Diamond Phillips shows off some comedic chops as the double crossing hit squad member and is one of the funniest characters in the movie.  Also, some funny moments with Lainie Kazan, Elliott Gould and Avery Brooks. Mark Wahlberg's mild mannered hit man is a surprise and has some nice moments with the kidnap victim (China Chow).
