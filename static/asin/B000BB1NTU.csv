While viewing the events of the book through the narrow prism of nine days in the life of a priest imprisoned in Dachau it fleshes out the plot, and includes some of the most jarring and graphic scenes of the book.The film is also about faithfulness on another level, whether in the midst of the hell was the experience of those in concentration camps, one can maintain a firm grasp on one's faith.The acting was superb, as was the cinematography.

This brilliant film is inspiring to watch once one has got past the two brief incidents of brutality at Dachau which are at the start of the film. One does not need to be a Christian to appreciate this film.

939502,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000BB1NTU,J from NY,"[7, 8]","Director Volker Schl&ouml;ndorff has accomplished with ""The Ninth Day"" what so many filmmakers--American and foreign--fail to do: to depict a believable, human, and realistic clash between the psychic motivations that engender good and evil.Based (loosely) on Father Jean Bernard's memoir ""Priestblock 25487: A Memoir of Dachuau"". Father Bernard was arrested in 1941 for speaking out against the Nuremburg racial ""laws"" and sabotaging Nazi relations in his native Luxembourg.  Though it is difficult to capture the power of the book, Schlondorff has done that and much more: he gives a baby face to the evil surrounding the priest in his memoir, a German actor who is perfect.  August Diehl is Untersturmf&uuml;hrer Gebhardt, a Gestapo agent wholooks like he could barely be past nineteen and and who was once a seminarian.He tries to persuade Father Kremer (Bernard's pseudonym in the film) to get a letter from his Archbishop supporting the union of the Church in Luxembourg and the Third Reich: a Nazi Vatican dialogue in the only German parish left that refuses to welcome them.  He has nine days to accomplish this.  If he doesn't, he will be sent back.The conversations between Kremer and Gerbhardt are what make the movie.  Gerbhardt is a young and super twisted Nazi who considers himself to be carrying out Christ's--or Judas'--mission on earth with his role in the Party.  His demonic theology is as follows: without Judas, without the backstabber of humanity, where would Christ be?  Therefore, extreme evil has just as much of a place in the world as goodness.  More, in fact.  The theological ""debates"" are life and death for Father Kremer and he prevails in the end by touching the only bit of conscience left in Gerbhardt's evil, ruined soul.Many have mistakenly viewed Pope Pius XII as being silent during the Nazi's reign of terror. This film should clear some of that up and show why (and he wasn't, actually) his silence lasted for so long during certain periods of time.  He gave Jews Baptismal Certificates so that if the Gestapo showed up looking for them they could directly refer to his authority.  He saved lives.  He gave Christmas radio broadcasts denouncing the Nazi treatment of the Jews.  Kremer, in desperation, asks his Archbishop what the Holy Father is doing, why he must suffer so, and the Archbishop gives and good and factual explanation.This film is pretty brutal and always realistic.  The triumph of Father Jean Bernard over maddening odds must be seen to be believed.",5,"""Judas.

We stay there long enough to meet Father Henri Kremer and his fellow clergy prisoners and to experience the day to day brutality and persecution they endure. One day, Henri is asked to follow the guard. Fearing the worst, a fellow pastor was just hung from a cross, he heads toward the area where the crosses are set up. Instead, he is redirected to the Commandant's office where, to his utter amazement, he is given his release. He boards the train to his home in Luxembourg. Trudging his way home in the snow from the station, he is picked up by the head of the Gestapo, Herr Gebhardt and told to report to his office promptly in the morning where he will discover, it's not a release he was given but a nine day pass. So begins Day one of nine in which he is to persuade the Bishop of Luxembourg to cooperate with the Nazis or he and his fellow clergy will be transferred to a death camp in the east. Will Father Kremer compromise his faith to save his and the others' lives? Every day he must report his progress to Gebhardt, personally, who uses every psychological trick he knows to persuade Henri to cooperate. Gebhardt is really Evil incarnate. It is a showdown between religion that would use power to dominate and control versus faith that seeks to serve and to love. It is the ultimate showdown of good and evil-the one with the weapons and the power and the one with love and faith. This is a powerful story that never lets up. It is intense to the end.

939511,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000BB1NTU,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","""The Ninth Day"" is not exactly a Holocaust drama in the strict sense as it's main focus is not about the persecution and extermination of Jews by the Nazis during WW II, but about the persecution of anti-Nazi clergy by the Nazis. It is a subject that is often overlooked in movies about WW II, but it was very real and these men of cloth truly suffered for their convictions. Based on the true life story of Father Jean Bernard, the movie centers around the trials and tribulations of Father Henri Kremer, who had been deported to the infamous Dachau concentration camp for his anti-Nazi activities [he had been assisting the Luxembourg resistance].The beginning of the movie portrays Father Kremer and his fellow clergy being at the mercy of the sadistic camp guards, even witnessing the crucifixion of a fellow priest. Then something inconceivable happens - Father Kremer is informed that he has been released and is sent off back home to Luxembourg. It is only upon arrival in Luxembourg that Henri [Ulrich Matthes]realizes that something is afoot - he is whisked off by the Gestapo to meet with an SS official, Gebhardt [August Diehl] and unceremoniously informed that he has not been granted release, but a 'leave' of nine days, in which period he is to accomplish something for the Nazis' benefit.To his utter disgust, Henri discovers that he has nine days to persuade his Bishop to sign a proclamation that confirms the Luxembourg church's allegiance to and alliance with Hitler and Nazi Germany. Henri has been chosen because of his family connections and close rapport with the Bishop, but we discover later that other factors also played a part in Henri being chosen for this role.To collude with the Nazis is unpalatable to the devout and anti-Nazi Henri, but he also realizes the high risks involved in desisting - if he flees, his fellow clergy back in Dachau will be executed, and if he refuses, his family [a sister, a brother and a brother-in-law] will be at risk too. What is a honorable man of the cloth to do in such a position?The movie is very much a human drama with lots of intense dialogue and verbal sparring ,especially between Henri and the SS Gephardt, but the pace never lets up. The audience is always kept on the edge of their seats as we wonder how each encounter with the cunning and evil Gephardt will turn out. There is not much violence in this movie compared to other WW II and Holocaust dramas - but there is a sense of pervasive evil throughout the movie as embodied by Gephardt and the sense of doom hanging over poor Henri.The two main actors, i.e. Ulrich Matthes as Henri and August Diehl as the Nazi Gephardt are incredible in their roles - they truly come to personify the good and the evil. Ulrich Matthes' deep-set black eyes burn with a fervor that commands the screen - his anger & his anguish are effectively conveyed by his eyes without need of any dialogue. August Diehl as the wily Nazi is also a commanding presence on screen - his character seems cultured and deferential but the monster within is quick to emerge when thwarted in his goals. The theological debates between Henri and Gephardt are perhaps the best scenes in the movie - we have on the one hand, the devout Henri who is unmoved by any pleas or bribes to change his convictions, and the evil Nazi who tries to use religion to have his way [he's a former deacon who chose to become an SS over the priesthood]. I can't really describe it - but watching these two debate each other was truly compelling, especially in listening to Father Kremer rebut each point made by Gephardt.All in all, this is a must-see for those who want to learn more about the persecution of anti-Nazi clergy during WW II. There aren't that many movies made on this subject, and this is one of the few stand-outs in terms of it's superior quality.",5,Grim portrayal of Nazi persecution against anti-Nazi clergy,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,3838,"['Ninth', 'Day', 'not', 'exactly', 'Holocaust', 'drama', 'strict', 'sense', 'main', 'focus', 'not', 'persecution', 'extermination', 'Jews', 'Nazis', 'WW', 'II', 'persecution', 'anti-Nazi', 'clergy', 'Nazis', 'subject', 'often', 'overlooked', 'movies', 'WW', 'II', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'men', 'cloth', 'truly', 'suffered', 'convictions', 'Based', 'true', 'life', 'story', 'Father', 'Jean', 'Bernard', 'movie', 'centers', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Father', 'Henri', 'Kremer', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'deported', 'infamous', 'Dachau', 'concentration', 'camp', 'anti-Nazi', 'activities', 'had', 'been', 'assisting', 'Luxembourg', 'resistance', ']', '.The', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Father', 'Kremer', 'fellow', 'clergy', 'being', 'mercy', 'sadistic', 'camp', 'guards', 'even', 'witnessing', 'crucifixion', 'fellow', 'priest', 'Then', 'something', 'inconceivable', 'Father', 'Kremer', 'informed', 'been', 'released', 'sent', 'off', 'back', 'home', 'Luxembourg', 'only', 'upon', 'arrival', 'Luxembourg', 'Henri', '[', 'Ulrich', 'Matthes', ']', 'something', 'afoot', 'whisked', 'off', 'Gestapo', 'meet', 'SS', 'official', 'Gebhardt', '[', 'August', 'Diehl', ']', 'unceremoniously', 'informed', 'not', 'been', 'granted', 'release', ""'leave"", ""'"", 'nine', 'days', 'period', 'accomplish', 'something', 'Nazis', 'benefit.To', 'utter', 'disgust', 'Henri', 'nine', 'days', 'persuade', 'Bishop', 'sign', 'proclamation', 'Luxembourg', 'church', 'allegiance', 'alliance', 'Hitler', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Henri', 'been', 'chosen', 'family', 'connections', 'close', 'rapport', 'Bishop', 'discover', 'later', 'other', 'factors', 'also', 'played', 'part', 'Henri', 'being', 'chosen', 'role.To', 'collude', 'Nazis', 'unpalatable', 'devout', 'anti-Nazi', 'Henri', 'also', 'high', 'risks', 'involved', 'desisting', 'fellow', 'clergy', 'back', 'Dachau', 'will', 'be', 'executed', 'family', 'sister', 'brother', 'brother-in-law', ']', 'will', 'be', 'risk', 'too', 'What', 'honorable', 'man', 'cloth', 'do', 'position', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'human', 'drama', 'lots', 'intense', 'dialogue', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'especially', 'Henri', 'SS', 'Gephardt', 'pace', 'never', 'up', 'audience', 'always', 'kept', 'edge', 'seats', 'wonder', 'how', 'encounter', 'cunning', 'evil', 'Gephardt', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'much', 'violence', 'movie', 'compared', 'other', 'WW', 'II', 'Holocaust', 'dramas', 'sense', 'pervasive', 'evil', 'movie', 'embodied', 'Gephardt', 'sense', 'doom', 'hanging', 'poor', 'Henri.The', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'i.e', 'Ulrich', 'Matthes', 'Henri', 'August', 'Diehl', 'Nazi', 'Gephardt', 'are', 'incredible', 'roles', 'truly', 'come', 'personify', 'good', 'evil', 'Ulrich', 'Matthes', 'deep-set', 'black', 'eyes', 'burn', 'fervor', 'screen', 'anger', 'anguish', 'are', 'effectively', 'conveyed', 'eyes', 'need', 'dialogue', 'August', 'Diehl', 'wily', 'Nazi', 'also', 'commanding', 'presence', 'screen', 'character', 'cultured', 'deferential', 'monster', 'quick', 'emerge', 'when', 'thwarted', 'goals', 'theological', 'debates', 'Henri', 'Gephardt', 'are', 'perhaps', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'have', 'one', 'hand', 'devout', 'Henri', 'who', 'unmoved', 'pleas', 'bribes', 'change', 'convictions', 'evil', 'Nazi', 'who', 'use', 'religion', 'have', 'way', 'former', 'deacon', 'who', 'chose', 'become', 'SS', 'priesthood', ']', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'describe', 'watching', 'two', 'debate', 'other', 'was', 'truly', 'compelling', 'especially', 'listening', 'Father', 'Kremer', 'point', 'made', 'Gephardt.All', 'must-see', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'persecution', 'anti-Nazi', 'clergy', 'WW', 'II', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'made', 'subject', 'one', 'few', 'stand-outs', 'terms', 'superior', 'quality']",The Ninth Day
