I have been using 3 of the 4 dvds regularly; I haven't tried the Meditation dvd yet.  After six weeks, using the dvds 4x a week, I am already seeing amazing results.  More toning in my arms and abs (esp triceps and lower abs, traditionally areas that atrophy easily) and incredible gains in flexibility. Really, incredible, people don't believe how much my hamstrings have stretched.  I used to barely be able to get past my knees, maybe mid-calf if I had stretched very well before hand.  Now, mid-calf is where I start when I'm cold, after these yoga dvds, I can reach to within 1cm of the floor!These dvds are excellent value for money and I can't imagine any beginner buying them and being disappointed.",5,Amazing results after only 6 weeks!,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",2006,828,"['Alan', 'Finger', 'top', 'quality', 'instruction', 'poses', 'are', 'demostrated', 'advanced', 'level', 'beginner', 'one', 'have', 'been', 'using', '3', '4', 'dvds', 'regularly', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Meditation', 'dvd', 'yet', 'six', 'weeks', 'using', 'dvds', '4x', 'week', 'am', 'already', 'seeing', 'amazing', 'results', 'More', 'toning', 'arms', 'abs', 'esp', 'triceps', 'lower', 'abs', 'traditionally', 'areas', 'atrophy', 'easily', 'incredible', 'gains', 'flexibility', 'Really', 'incredible', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'hamstrings', 'have', 'stretched', 'used', 'barely', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'past', 'knees', 'maybe', 'mid-calf', 'had', 'stretched', 'very', 'well', 'hand', 'Now', 'mid-calf', 'where', 'start', 'when', ""'m"", 'cold', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'can', 'reach', '1cm', 'floor', 'dvds', 'are', 'excellent', 'value', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'beginner', 'buying', 'being', 'disappointed']",Yoga Zone - Beginners VHS

After I had myself back in shape again, I went back to see just how challenging it was and was so pleased at the progress I had made.This is a good place to start with beginning yoga practice. Just do what you can do. Keep at it until you can do more of it and do it better. It's a low-key approach, which is my style. If you want a more athletic approach that makes you sweat and you are already in great shape and/or love aerobic exercise, this probably isn't it.",4,I really enjoyed this Beginner Yoga Practice!,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,603,"['was', ""n't"", 'beginner', 'yoga', 'when', 'purchased', 'video', 'had', ""n't"", 'practiced', 'years', 'found', 'challenging', 'was', 'shape', 'had', 'back', 'shape', 'again', 'went', 'back', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'challenging', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'pleased', 'progress', 'had', 'made.This', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'beginning', 'yoga', 'practice', 'Just', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Keep', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'do', 'better', 'low-key', 'approach', 'style', 'want', 'more', 'athletic', 'approach', 'sweat', 'are', 'already', 'great', 'shape', 'and/or', 'love', 'aerobic', 'exercise', 'probably', ""n't""]",Yoga Zone - Beginners VHS

If you are looking for a ground-floor, basic start to your yoga practice, this is an excellent place to start. I made the mistake of trying a more challenging tape first, which made me feel like an uncoordinated loser, and after mastering these tapes I found that I had the basics to take me to more challenging and athletic forms of yoga. I have loaned out my Introduction to Yoga tape to friends that want a taste of doing yoga, and find myself gravitating to the Conditioning and Stress Relief video, even though I've mastered it some time ago. I still love the feeling of the stress just releasing from my back and shoulders. These are the tapes that teach you the fundamentals, the most important of which is the breathing. This, for me, was the most challenging, as I tend to rush and hurry all day and this taught me to slow it down. I find I often use the breathing technique now, not only to get through more challenging poses but during my busy day also. The meditation tapes are wonderful. I don't use them as often as I should, but it would be a great resolution for the new year to start using them more regularly. It is a wonderful set that you will use for many years to come and a great foundation for building your own yoga practice.",5,"....Yes, you CAN do it!",1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,1307,"['Yes', 'even', 'uncoordinated', 'can', 'learn', 'do', 'tapes', 'are', 'looking', 'ground-floor', 'basic', 'start', 'yoga', 'practice', 'excellent', 'place', 'start', 'made', 'mistake', 'trying', 'more', 'challenging', 'tape', 'first', 'made', 'feel', 'uncoordinated', 'loser', 'mastering', 'tapes', 'found', 'had', 'basics', 'take', 'more', 'challenging', 'athletic', 'forms', 'yoga', 'have', 'loaned', 'out', 'Introduction', 'Yoga', 'tape', 'friends', 'want', 'taste', 'doing', 'yoga', 'find', 'gravitating', 'Conditioning', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'video', 'even', ""'ve"", 'mastered', 'time', 'still', 'love', 'feeling', 'stress', 'just', 'releasing', 'back', 'shoulders', 'are', 'tapes', 'teach', 'fundamentals', 'most', 'important', 'breathing', 'was', 'most', 'challenging', 'tend', 'rush', 'hurry', 'day', 'taught', 'slow', 'down', 'find', 'often', 'use', 'breathing', 'technique', 'now', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'challenging', 'poses', 'busy', 'day', 'also', 'meditation', 'tapes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'as', 'often', 'should', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'resolution', 'new', 'year', 'start', 'using', 'more', 'regularly', 'wonderful', 'set', 'will', 'use', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'great', 'foundation', 'building', 'own', 'yoga', 'practice']",Yoga Zone - Beginners VHS

All my life I've been active, an athlete, etc. and suddenly here I was struggling to get up the stairs of my building.This series gave me the kind of activity I needed-- and the encouragement to let my body just go as far as it could *that day*, and not push too far.I still use these programs in my daily routines, and although I have several other YogaZone dvds, this collection is still my favorite!If you're looking for ""power"" yoga, however, you won't be happy with this collection.",5,Still the BEST YogaZone series!,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,644,"['bought', 'collection', 'VHS', 'back', 'well', 'late', '90s', 'time', 'was', 'serious', 'ie', 'disabling', 'Fibromyalgia-myofasial', 'pain', 'syndrome-complex', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'active', 'athlete', 'etc', 'suddenly', 'here', 'was', 'struggling', 'get', 'up', 'stairs', 'building.This', 'series', 'gave', 'kind', 'activity', 'needed', 'encouragement', 'let', 'body', 'just', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'could', '*that', 'day*', 'not', 'push', 'too', 'far.I', 'still', 'programs', 'daily', 'routines', 'have', 'several', 'other', 'YogaZone', 'dvds', 'collection', 'still', 'favorite', ""'re"", 'looking', 'power', 'yoga', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'collection']",Yoga Zone - Beginners VHS
472389,A16HL3GR2CIXUH,6305661731,"Kristin A. Choate ""kristinannie""","[15, 15]","When I purchased these tapes, I was a true beginner at yoga.  I had absolutely no idea what to expect.  These tapes are fantastic.  Alan Finger is a great teacher and keeps you focused on breathing and correct form.  There are two women performing the poses and one of them shows the poses in a modified manner.  Alan is constantly describing modifications to do if you have a weak back, a weak neck, weak knees, etc.  He is also honest by telling you when a pose is very difficult and tells you only to go into the pose further if you can take a full breath.The first tape that I would suggest doing is the Introduction to Yoga tape.  You will learn very basic yoga poses and it is accessible to a beginner.  The other two tapes include some more difficult poses as well as building on the poses you learn in the introduction tape.  A meditation tape is also included which is great for calming your mind and body.Being a beginner, I was a little daunted by yoga.  BUT...this tape really makes you feel comfortable with the poses and allows you to progress at your own speed.  I have noticed a big difference since beginning to use these tapes.  My posture has improved and I sleep better at night.  I hurt my back in a car accident a couple of years ago and have found that yoga helps to eliminate my lower back pain.  You will be surprised by the number of muscles that yoga works.  It helps to tone your entire body and is a great supplement to more traditional cardiovascular exercise.",5,Fantastic Series of Tapes!,1030060800,"08 23, 2002",2002,1490,"['When', 'purchased', 'tapes', 'was', 'true', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'had', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'tapes', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Alan', 'Finger', 'great', 'teacher', 'focused', 'breathing', 'correct', 'form', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'performing', 'poses', 'one', 'poses', 'modified', 'manner', 'Alan', 'constantly', 'describing', 'modifications', 'do', 'have', 'weak', 'back', 'weak', 'neck', 'weak', 'knees', 'etc', 'also', 'honest', 'telling', 'when', 'pose', 'very', 'difficult', 'only', 'go', 'pose', 'further', 'can', 'take', 'full', 'breath.The', 'first', 'tape', 'would', 'suggest', 'doing', 'Introduction', 'Yoga', 'tape', 'will', 'learn', 'very', 'basic', 'yoga', 'poses', 'accessible', 'beginner', 'other', 'two', 'tapes', 'include', 'more', 'difficult', 'poses', 'as', 'well', 'building', 'poses', 'learn', 'introduction', 'tape', 'meditation', 'tape', 'also', 'included', 'great', 'calming', 'mind', 'body.Being', 'beginner', 'was', 'little', 'daunted', 'yoga', 'BUT', 'tape', 'really', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'poses', 'progress', 'own', 'speed', 'have', 'noticed', 'big', 'difference', 'beginning', 'use', 'tapes', 'posture', 'improved', 'sleep', 'better', 'night', 'hurt', 'back', 'car', 'accident', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'found', 'yoga', 'eliminate', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'number', 'muscles', 'yoga', 'tone', 'entire', 'body', 'great', 'supplement', 'more', 'traditional', 'cardiovascular', 'exercise']",Yoga Zone - Beginners VHS

Some of these videos disappeared in a recent garage sale, thank God.  But not these!  I cannot stress more strongly that this series is THE place from which you should start yoga--ANY yoga. I still use these three, in this DVD, the most, because as I go along, my strength accumulates and each practice is different than the last.  Alan Finger is the master of meticulous cueing, instruction, technique, breathing, everything--about yoga.  His teaching style is very friendly and personable.  You will discover that yoga is not about Madonna or pretzels, and boy, will you be glad!  Start with the ""Intro to Yoga"" in this DVD and move forward to the others (in this DVD) at your own pace.  As you progress and become stronger and more confident you will probably continue to use all three, and each time you use each one, you will become stronger, and you will continue to learn more every time you use them.

472392,A2ZBATR2RHHSSO,6305661731,"""omshantih""","[13, 13]","I started doing Yoga 3 years ago but I had to stop due to personal matters. I gained a lot of flexibility and inner peace in a short time. Now I live in Japan and I had NO idea where to take Yoga lessons so I decided to go with a DVD. I'm skeptical about getting ""workout"" videos because many of them are just phoney. But after reading the reviews of this pack, I knew I couldnt go wrong...and I didnt.The asanas (poses) are definitely for begginers but they have their challenges and honestly, they arent very different than the asanas I was practicing before. The instructions are VERY clear, the instructor is great, he has a very ""peaceful voice"" and urges you to give your possible maximum. Another good thing about this series, is that they have 2 other YOga instructors who will perform the asanas, one in the way if you are more flexible and another in a modified way for those who are less flexible..and the great thing about it, they dont have an idiotic smile attached to their faces like many other models in other workout videos have.All of them look very peaceful and concentrated.My reccomendation is, if you'll do it by yourself, to get a full length mirror so you can see yourself and prevent from doing the pose in a wrong way, also, if you'd like, get a cd with Yoga or Meditation music.After the session, you will feel, serene, relaxed, at first a bit drowsy but then you'll feel a rush of energy come to you and in a short while, you will gain more flexibility and you'll be more in tune and in peace with the world around you.Go for it!
