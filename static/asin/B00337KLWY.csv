It shows how Wuzzleburg has a problem with plastic bottles and then what they do to solve their problem.  It is so cute!  Another episode deals with building an awesome park, but to do so trees have to get cut down and animals become homeless.  Other episodes deal with pollution, animals adapting to new environments, and eating a variety of good foods!This DVD has so many good lessons featured that it would be hard for at least one of them not to rub off on kids that watch it.  I think it showcasing some great ways to recycle and love the environment in such an easy way for kids to understand.  The DVD is so colorful and has some catchy music that it is hard too not to smile while watching it!  I really love the design of the Wubbzy show and think it definitely makes it look kid-friendly.  So Wubbzy does it again and won the heart of my family through this adorable DVD.I received this DVD to review.  This is 100% my opinion.",5,Love it!,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,1059,"['am', 'trying', 'teach', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'recycling', 're-using', 'items', 'right', 'now', 'thought', 'DVD', 'was', 'perfect', 'how', 'Wuzzleburg', 'problem', 'plastic', 'bottles', 'then', 'what', 'do', 'solve', 'problem', 'so', 'cute', 'episode', 'deals', 'building', 'awesome', 'park', 'do', 'so', 'trees', 'have', 'get', 'cut', 'down', 'animals', 'become', 'homeless', 'Other', 'episodes', 'deal', 'pollution', 'animals', 'adapting', 'new', 'environments', 'eating', 'variety', 'good', 'foods', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'lessons', 'featured', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'least', 'one', 'not', 'rub', 'off', 'kids', 'watch', 'think', 'showcasing', 'great', 'ways', 'recycle', 'love', 'environment', 'such', 'easy', 'way', 'kids', 'understand', 'DVD', 'so', 'colorful', 'catchy', 'music', 'hard', 'too', 'not', 'smile', 'watching', 'really', 'love', 'design', 'Wubbzy', 'show', 'think', 'definitely', 'look', 'kid-friendly', 'So', 'Wubbzy', 'again', 'won', 'heart', 'family', 'adorable', 'DVD.I', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', '100', '%', 'opinion']",N/A
