1293421,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002VJVCGY,B. E Jackson,"[2, 7]","Big Fan has a drama storyline that all NFL football fans should see, haha.  It's about an obnoxious and obsessed New York Giants fan who constantly makes late night phone calls to radio stations and trashes the other teams in the division, specifically the Eagles.Well one night he spots a famous NFL player going to a night club, and when he comes up to the NFL player, he gets more than he bargained for.  The NFL star completely kicks his rear-end because he believes the Giants fan was stalking him.Eventually a lawsuit occurs (against the wishes of the Giants fan, thanks to a family member) because apparently his devotion to the Giants is more important than getting a LOT of money.The storyline focuses exclusively on the obnoxious behavior of the obsessed fan and less on the actual lawsuit.  I'm a little disappointed with that.The storyline is really ordinary and predictable, so don't expect Big Fan to offer anything remotely different from the description.  It doesn't.It just shows how pathetic it is for a 30-something year old football fan (still living with his mother) taking football WAY too seriously.",3,not bad,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,1122,"['Big', 'Fan', 'drama', 'storyline', 'NFL', 'football', 'fans', 'should', 'see', 'obnoxious', 'obsessed', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'fan', 'who', 'constantly', 'late', 'night', 'phone', 'radio', 'stations', 'trashes', 'other', 'teams', 'division', 'specifically', 'Eagles.Well', 'one', 'night', 'spots', 'famous', 'NFL', 'player', 'going', 'night', 'club', 'when', 'up', 'NFL', 'player', 'more', 'bargained', 'NFL', 'star', 'completely', 'rear-end', 'Giants', 'fan', 'was', 'stalking', 'him.Eventually', 'lawsuit', 'wishes', 'Giants', 'fan', 'thanks', 'family', 'member', 'apparently', 'devotion', 'Giants', 'more', 'important', 'getting', 'LOT', 'money.The', 'storyline', 'exclusively', 'obnoxious', 'behavior', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'less', 'actual', 'lawsuit', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'that.The', 'storyline', 'really', 'ordinary', 'predictable', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Big', 'Fan', 'offer', 'anything', 'remotely', 'different', 'description', 'just', 'how', 'pathetic', '30-something', 'year', 'old', 'football', 'fan', 'still', 'living', 'mother', 'taking', 'football', 'WAY', 'too', 'seriously']",Big Fan

1293425,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,B002VJVCGY,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[7, 21]","I went into this film with moderate expectations and came out very surprised.This is one of the worst, most insulting films I've ever seen.When I watched this film, I thought it would be a decent rent. I had heard that Patton Oswalt, best known for his standup and his recurring role on King of Queens, gave a good performance here in a role that wasn't really funny.  I didn't expect it to be a comedy, but I did expect a decent film.  What I got was a deeply insulting, overblown, plain unbelievable film.  The writer/director, Robert Siegel, has such sniveling contempt for his main character that you feel absolutely nothing for him.  Siegel's contempt bleeds into the actual script as Siegel seems so determined to mock Paul (Patton Oswalt's character) that he doesn't care about reality and/or logic.There are several instances of WTF moments in this film.  Paul is a lonely guy who is obsessed with sports who lives with his mom.  He has no girlfriend and masturbates a lot.  He has a crap job.  He worships the Giants, though, and their star QB.  One night, Paul and his friend (played by Kevin Corrigan) are at a gas station in Staten Island and see the famous QB.  They follow him in their car into Manhattan, and follow him into a really high priced strip club.  This is where the film totally unravels (and it's only in the first third).  Paaul and his friend manage to have enough cash to pay to get into the strip club (20 bucks each), buy a Bud Light (for 9 bucks each), ignore the strippers while they are admiring the Giants' QB from afar (they wouldn't do that in real life), and when they buy him a drink, he flips out on them and beats the crap out of Paul because he thinks that he's being stalked.  In real life, the QB would have taken the drink, talked to Paul briefly, mocked him a little bit, then would have gone back to partying with his entourage.  He wouldn't have flipped out like that at all.  And Paul (who has a job as a parking lot attendant) would never be able to afford that high priced strip club anyway.That's just one of the unbelievable things that happen in this film.  The ending is so preposterous that I won't go into it.  I haven't been this aggravated at a film in years.  Siegel wrote The Wrestler, a film that wasn't very good but was made watchable by the sheer presence, grace, and depth of Mickey Rourke.  He made that film worth watching.  Here, Siegel has such contempt for Paul that Patton can't overcome the mediocre material.  I think I'm so angry at this film because it insulted my intelligence so deeply and Siegel has contempt not only for his lead character, but for his audience and probably himself.  Many men are obsessed with sports, but they don't live at home with their mommies and play with themselves.  They have good jobs.  They have wives, girlfriends, sometimes both.  They have children.  They just love sports.  They like to call into these shows.  That doesn't mean they're losers.The only decent thing about this film is the good cinematography by Michael Simmonds, a fine cinematographer who has shot several indie films and has made them look fabulous.  Even if you're a fan of Patton Oswalt's, this film really isn't worth watching even for him.  Patton did the best he could under the situation.  Avoid this film like the Ebola virus.

Certainly the performance of Patton Oswalt is exemplary.  He plays a 35 year old sports geek who works as a cashier in a late night parking garage.  His only joy in life is the N.Y. Giants football team and ranting on late night talk radio about the team and its opponents.Paul (Oswalt) still lives at home with his mother who is more than annoyed that he won't live a ""normal"" life.  Paul and his buddy spot his QB idol getting gas in Staten Island where they live and follow him to a drug house, then to a Manhattan strip club.

1293435,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B002VJVCGY,ninjasuperstar,"[5, 8]","In my review, I reveal one plot point that occurs towards the beginning of the film.Big Fan (written and directed by Robert Siegel) stars Patton Oswalt as Paul Aufiero, a New York Giants fan who works in a parking garage toll booth, lives with his mother, rants on a sports radio show, and eats sugary and salty food for every meal.  It's not clear that he does anything else with his life.  He is the epitome of arrested development, trapped in living life vicariously through the successes of football player Quantrell Bishop (played by Jonathan Hamm).  Paul is too perfect of a character sketch to be believable, and the writer/director hates him.Why would you make a movie or write a story that centers on a character you despise?  Big Fan is essentially that.  Siegel feels no sympathy for Paul whatsoever--he places Paul in proximity to his hero (Bishop) only to have the man inexplicably beat Paul within a few punches of his life.  Are we really to believe that rich, famous athletes snap every time their ""biggest fan"" turns out to be a little creepy or weird?  Or worse, that obsessed fans might deserve such treatment?Oswalt works hard to make a relatively stock character as dynamic as possible within the cloisters of man-boy.  His performance has more subtlety than I was expecting.  Oswalt works well with the rest of the cast, especially his co-fan, Sal (played by Kevin Corrigan), and his brother, Jeff (played by Gino Cafarelli).I have read other reviews from people who found Big Fan thought-provoking or at least an attempt to make a sports movie less about sports and more about the culture surrounding sports.  I agree that Big Fan accomplishes the latter, but I don't think it's all that thought-provoking.  The movie seemed too obvious to me: Here's a sports fan, this is all he lives for, some things will happen to shake his devotion to his team, but will he still be able to push aside the real world in order to maintain his fantasy?  I think you know the answer to that.",3,It's clear the writer/director hates the protagonist,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,1999,"['review', 'reveal', 'one', 'plot', 'point', 'beginning', 'film.Big', 'Fan', 'written', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Siegel', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Paul', 'Aufiero', 'New', 'York', 'Giants', 'fan', 'who', 'parking', 'garage', 'toll', 'booth', 'mother', 'rants', 'sports', 'radio', 'show', 'eats', 'sugary', 'salty', 'food', 'meal', 'not', 'clear', 'anything', 'else', 'life', 'epitome', 'arrested', 'development', 'trapped', 'living', 'life', 'vicariously', 'successes', 'football', 'player', 'Quantrell', 'Bishop', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Hamm', 'Paul', 'too', 'perfect', 'character', 'sketch', 'be', 'believable', 'writer/director', 'him.Why', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'write', 'story', 'character', 'despise', 'Big', 'Fan', 'essentially', 'Siegel', 'sympathy', 'Paul', 'whatsoever', 'Paul', 'proximity', 'hero', 'Bishop', 'only', 'have', 'man', 'inexplicably', 'beat', 'Paul', 'few', 'punches', 'life', 'Are', 'really', 'believe', 'rich', 'famous', 'athletes', 'snap', 'time', 'biggest', 'fan', 'out', 'be', 'little', 'creepy', 'weird', 'worse', 'obsessed', 'fans', 'might', 'deserve', 'such', 'treatment', 'Oswalt', 'hard', 'make', 'relatively', 'stock', 'character', 'as', 'dynamic', 'possible', 'cloisters', 'man-boy', 'performance', 'more', 'subtlety', 'was', 'expecting', 'Oswalt', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'co-fan', 'Sal', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'brother', 'Jeff', 'played', 'Gino', 'Cafarelli', '.I', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'found', 'Big', 'Fan', 'thought-provoking', 'least', 'attempt', 'make', 'sports', 'movie', 'less', 'sports', 'more', 'culture', 'surrounding', 'sports', 'agree', 'Big', 'Fan', 'latter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'thought-provoking', 'movie', 'seemed', 'too', 'obvious', 'Here', 'sports', 'fan', 'things', 'will', 'happen', 'shake', 'devotion', 'team', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'push', 'aside', 'real', 'world', 'order', 'maintain', 'fantasy', 'think', 'know', 'answer']",Big Fan
1293436,A3FNOMJG1MKQYG,B002VJVCGY,O. Rios,"[8, 11]","i checked out Big Fan with Patton Oswalt and it's a very solid movie.Patton plays Paul, a 40 year old live at home with his mom guy who works at as a parking ticket attendant. His only drive in life is that every night he calls in as Paul from Staten Island on Sports Talk Radio raving about the New York Giants and his favorite player, Quantrell Bishop. He listens to the radio during work, writing down his thoughts for his 1 minute air time each night.His mom and brother are upset because he has no drive in life and is perfectly fine with his parking job and living at home with his mom.Out with his good buddy eating at a resturant, he sees Bishop and the decides to follow his hero around, eventually ending up in Manhattan at a strip club. He finally works up the courage to talk to Bishop only to tell him that he's been following him around the entire time. Bishop, who has been drinking takes it as Paul was stalking him and goes spider monkey on him.Paul wakes up several days later in a hospital to find out he's been beaten so bad, he's suffered bleeding and bruising in the brain, which leads to severe and sudden headaces.His brother wants to sue, the police departments wants to file charges, the NFL suspends Bishop for several games, and his mother is even more outrages because Paul won't do anything about the case. Finally, his brother files a suit for $77 million and all heck breaks loose in New York. Fans and media start saying that the suit is a joke and pressure is put on Paul, even though his loyalty is to the team.overall, the movie is very solid. My only gripe is that the movie couldn't figure out whether Bishop played QB or LB or whatever he played. From the beginning, it's implied Bishop plays linebacker as Patton Oswalt always wears Bishop's #54 jersey, yet in the movie, over and over, they keep refering to Bishop as a QB. The poster in Paul's room of Bishop reads ""QBs Beware"", yet Bishop wears a chain that reads QB.i don't get it....is he a QB or not?other than that, solid movie.

To be clear, the art shows a football field (front/back) with teams playing (never see a field or any team in the film), three quotes from NY publications (a NY Giants story), and rated as ""funny"" (very debatable). Outside of that, Patton Oswalt single-handedly carries an obscure character with exceptional believability.The story follows an 40-something avid sports fan working a bleak job whilst living at home with his mom. This obsession of following the NY Giants consumes his life, to such a point that he shuns any family intimacy and only associates with his idiot buddy - played well by Corrigan. A tragic chance meeting with his favorite player sets in motion a chain of events testing his resolve in being an acceptable part of society. Without exception, this is all about Oswalt as the filming is a tedious process of following this void of a life. Over-long scenes, bad lighting and continuos bouts of discomfort watching this story make for a difficult watch, and reading the numerous dislikes of this film I could not call this a ""crowd pleaser"", but it does preserve a solid talent. The special features are lengthy and include:* Outtakes, 11 minutes. A mix of bad cuts, alternate takes and unfunny moments, skipper.* Q&A; Siegel/Oswalt at a screening, 30 minutes. A worthy watch if just to see more of Oswalt's candid banter, jokes and profanities. Being interviewed by one of the aintitcool guys.* Corrigan recalls his own big fan moment, 7 minutes. He recounts at another Big Fan screening his young idol interaction moment with Deniro.* NPR interview with Siegel & Oswalt. This one you have to do via computer and download, I preferred the Q&A; session.* Downloadable poster, I passed on this one.The 5.1 is deliberately muddled in a variety of scenes as a great deal of this is about watching Patton's facial expressions and displays of emotion.

1293444,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002VJVCGY,Turfseer,"[8, 10]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Robert Siegel, the talented new screenwriter responsible for the indie hit, 'The Wrestler', now has written and directed his own feature on a limited budget. 'Big Fan' chronicles the misadventures of Staten Island resident Paul Aufiero, a fanatical New York (football) Giants fan who's in his mid-thirties and still lives at home with his mother. Paul works at a dead-end job as a parking attendant but has no interest in finding a new career. Instead, he pals around with Sal, his best friend, who is equally fanatical about the Giants. The obsessed couple reminds me of the hapless Garth and Wayne from Wayne's World in that they seem to revel in their social awkwardness.The fun of 'Big Fan is to see just how far Paul will go in his obsession with his beloved Giants. A good part of the obsession revolves around Paul's late night calls to a New York sports talk radio station. He's earned a reputation as the special caller from Staten Island, mainly known for his aggressive put-downs of the Philadelphia Eagle football team as well as their fans (Paul has a particularly noxious rivalry with his counterpart in Philadelphia, who also makes numerous late night calls to the station). In his provincial world, Paul fancies himself the king of all Giant fans but doesn't have the self-confidence to speak spontaneously when he calls into the radio talk show (instead he writes down what he wants to say on a pad of paper and reads it over the air, only to have his canned speech interrupted by his mother who ends up castigating him over the phone while the radio audience can hear everything she says).Due to their low paying jobs, Paul and Sal can't afford to buy a ticket and go inside the stadium to watch the Giants. Instead, they dutifully camp themselves out in the Giant parking lot and watch the game on a mini-TV set every week (Siegel was unable to gain permission from the NFL to film inside the stadium, so he created the above 'parking lot' scenario).We break into the Act Two of 'Big Fan' when Paul and Sal spot one of their favorite Giant players, Quantrell Bishop, hanging out with some friends in the Stapleton section of Staten Island. Paul and Sal drive into the City following Bishop and his entourage in their limousine and they all end up at an x-rated club in Manhattan. Paul attempts to strike up a conversation with Bishop and possibly get a picture taken with him. Things go horribly wrong, when a drunken Bishop believes that Paul is some kind of stalker and ends up pummeling him to the point where Paul ends up in a coma for three days. Bishop is immediately suspended by the NFL and his fate is up in the air.When Paul awakes from his coma in the hospital, his brother, a negligence attorney, wants to sue Bishop for $70 million. Naturally, Paul, the die-hard fan, will have nothing to due with the lawsuit much to the chagrin of his brother. Later, an NYPD detective pays numerous calls to Paul and finds that he's a totally uncooperative witness. Had this happened in real-life, Paul's identity would probably have been revealed in about a day's time and he would have been subject to intense media scrutiny. This is one of the major weaknesses in the plot. Instead, Paul's brother institutes the lawsuit without his permission and only after his brother takes action, does the media get wind that it's Paul who was involved in the incident at the strip club.There are moments of inspired lunacy in Big Fan. I particularly liked the take-off on the infomercial created by Paul's brother. The nagging of Paul by family members is not far removed from reality and the hoarding of the soy sauce by Paul's mother is a classic commentary on the root of Paul's dysfunction. Kudos also to the 'Sportsdog', the manic talk show announcer who I'm told has a sports talk show in real life on Sirius FM radio. More could have been done with Paul's sidekick, Sal, who ends up as a glorified cheerleader and what about Bishop? He simply disappears after the incident at the club.Big Fan becomes darker and less comic at the climax. After Paul's identity has been exposed and he's labeled a turncoat on talk radio, he feels he has to prove his 'loyalty' to the Giants so he puts on some 'warpaint' and drives to Philadelphia where he confronts the despised 'Philadelphia Phil' in a bar bathroom. At first it appears that Paul shoots Phil with a real gun which would have destroyed the entire comic tone of the movie; but as it turns out, the gun is merely a paint ball pistol and he ends up showering Phil with paint. Still, the scene underscores Paul's abject pettiness as he must resort to humiliating his rival by pretending that he's about to shoot him. The scene unfortunately makes Phil a much less likable and much more pathetic character as he resorts to violence to deal with his 'humiliation'. And one wonders if a character such as Paul would have done such a thing in the first place. After all, his goal is to prove to as many people as possible that he did not betray his team but his humiliation of Philadelphia Phil happens in a vacuum--no one else will ever get wind of what he did nor would anyone be impressed by his actions.Big Fan would have been more successful if we come to like Paul at the end despite his obsession. Instead, the lovable loser morphs into someone who's mean-spirited. Siegel however is to be commended for satirizing the fanatics of our society who delude themselves into believing that what they have to offer is meaningful, when in reality their obsessions are reflective of a profound shallowness.",3,Expose of sports fanaticism has inspired moments of lunacy but needs better finale,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,5604,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain',
