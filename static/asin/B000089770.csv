The cast is one of those rare combinations of individuals who seem to bring out the best in one another, like a good rock band.  As with any great film, it is a story well told.  It's a feel-good movie that avoids being sentimental, or overly simple.  The characters are believable and the story is entertaining.So, why three stars for a great movie?  Because, at one time, it was even greater.  When first released to theaters and then to VHS, it was a different film.  It began with a Jerry Garcia video that just set the tone for what was to come.  I also remember more cameos in the film.

735904,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000089770,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","This little gem is one of the unsung classics of the nineties.  Director Wayne Wang and co-director and scenarist Paul Auster have crafted a film that at turns funny, poignant, and tragic in a way that will always stay with you.  Some may be turned off because the film centers on a Brooklyn tobacco shop and for sure there is a lot of casual smoking here but that's just a starting point for a script that follows a variety of interesting characters and many intriguing story twists.  Harvey Keitel as Auggie the owner of the store gave what I thought one of the best performances of his career.  The film is populated by great work(William Hurt, Forrest Whitaker, et. al) but Auggie is the glue that holds the film together.  The extended scene where Auggie relates to the writer played by Hurt a Christmas story is worth the price of admission alone.  Even better is the scene over the end credits where Auggie's story is visualized as Leonard Cohen warbles on the soundtrack.  Also noteworthy is an unforgettable cameo by Ashley Judd as Stockard Channing's drug-addled daughter.  This rank's with Alec Baldwin's work in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" as an example of an actor making a major impact on a film with minimal screen time.",5,"This ""Smoke""  Doesn't Stink",1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,1229,"['little', 'gem', 'one', 'unsung', 'classics', 'nineties', 'Director', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'co-director', 'scenarist', 'Paul', 'Auster', 'have', 'crafted', 'film', 'turns', 'funny', 'poignant', 'tragic', 'way', 'will', 'always', 'stay', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'centers', 'Brooklyn', 'tobacco', 'shop', 'sure', 'lot', 'casual', 'smoking', 'here', 'just', 'starting', 'point', 'script', 'variety', 'interesting', 'characters', 'many', 'intriguing', 'story', 'twists', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Auggie', 'owner', 'store', 'gave', 'what', 'thought', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'film', 'populated', 'great', 'work', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'et', 'al', 'Auggie', 'glue', 'film', 'together', 'extended', 'scene', 'where', 'Auggie', 'writer', 'played', 'Hurt', 'Christmas', 'story', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'Even', 'better', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Auggie', 'story', 'visualized', 'Leonard', 'Cohen', 'soundtrack', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'unforgettable', 'cameo', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'drug-addled', 'daughter', 'rank', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'work', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'example', 'actor', 'making', 'major', 'impact', 'film', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time']",N/A

I like intelligent movies that provoke thought, so I came to this movie based on what I read about it here on Amazon.  I thought it would be perfect for me.  I was wrong. This movie is well-acted.  There are moments of freshness, and I very much liked the scene in which Auggie and Paul are looking through Auggie's photo albums. I thought then this would be a special movie, but I was disappointed. Three-quarters of the way through, I was still waiting for another scene like the early one that really hooked me.  I didn't find one, and I had no idea why I was watching the film.  I understand this is a ""slice of life film,"" and I understand the metaphor of the title, ""Smoke,"" but this movie dissipates too rapidly, is a little too insubstantial. I was never really engaged by the characters; I never really was able to get behind the facade, so to speak.

735906,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B000089770,Gregor von Kallahann,"[3, 3]","I recently programmed an at-home double feature consisting of SMOKE and GOING MY WAY.  Not exactly an obvious pairing, you might say, but they went together surprisingly well and served as proof positive that I like my sentiment with a dollop of metropolitan grit (or in the case of SMOKE, more than a dollop).SMOKE has long numbered among my 10 or 20 favorite films.  It's difficult to say just why I haven't posted a review of it until now.  Perhaps because it is so rich, I have avoided taking on the task of explaining its impact to on me to others.  SMOKE has a hold on me that few others do, but (for once) I'm at something of a loss to explain it.  Which is odd in a way--because I think it has something to do with the way we communicate with each other or fail to.  The dialog in the movie, for the most part, rings truer than in most movies--even most GOOD movies.That doesn't mean that all this authentic talk is meaningful communication.  These are regular Joe's (and a few Joannes) who aren't much into ""sharing.""  That's not to imply that their verbal exchanges are meaningless, but when they're talking sports or cigars, they're doing what the composer of Louis Armstrong's ""Wonderful World"" described so aptly when referring to ""folks shakin'hands, sayin' 'How do you do?""  They really are kinda sorta saying, ""I love you.""But we don't want to get too schmaltzy here.  SMOKE gets in your eyes, and in your heart, by employing such time honored devices as allowing its characters to keep their rough-edged exteriors, but letting the audience see their soft hearts underneath.  Take the two father-child reunion sub-plots.  The father-son re-encounter (the one that ultimately succeeds) contrasts sharply with the father-daughter(?) reunion that, for all intents and purposes, seems like a total failure.  But even in that tragic instance, there may be a grain hope tucked away, thanks to the selflessness of a man who really doesn't believe that he is this lost girl's biological father. His willingness to come to the aide of a young woman who is likely NOT his flesh and blood speaks volumes about the true meaning of ""charity.""  It takes a village--and sometimes it takes a borough.It bothers me somewhat that the film in its DVD and VHS format seems to have been marketed as a laff-riot comedy.  I don't recall if that was true when it was in theatrical release, but whatever the case, it's a big mistake. The cheery illustration of Keitel, flanked by a healthy-looking Ashley Judd and a sexy Stockard Channing, belies the movie's harsher reality.  Yes, SMOKE does offer a few laughs, but they are hard won and even a little bitter.  The tagline ""Where's there's SMOKE, there's laughter..."" isn't even half the story.  There are tears too, of course.  And there's cold reality staring you in the face.  And there are some real ""mensches"" out there who help make it all bearable.",5,SMOKE  Gets In Your Eyes--And Your Heart,1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,2897,"['recently', 'programmed', 'at-home', 'double', 'feature', 'consisting', 'SMOKE', 'GOING', 'MY', 'WAY', 'Not', 'exactly', 'obvious', 'pairing', 'might', 'say', 'went', 'together', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'served', 'proof', 'positive', 'like', 'sentiment', 'dollop', 'metropolitan', 'grit', 'case', 'SMOKE', 'more', 'dollop', '.SMOKE', 'long', 'numbered', '10', '20', 'favorite', 'films', 'difficult', 'say', 'just', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'posted', 'review', 'now', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'rich', 'have', 'avoided', 'taking', 'task', 'explaining', 'impact', 'others', 'SMOKE', 'hold', 'few', 'others', 'do', 'once', ""'m"", 'something', 'loss', 'explain', 'Which', 'odd', 'way', 'think', 'something', 'do', 'way', 'communicate', 'other', 'fail', 'dialog', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'truer', 'most', 'movies', 'even', 'most', 'GOOD', 'movies.That', ""n't"", 'mean', 'authentic', 'talk', 'meaningful', 'communication', 'are', 'regular', 'Joe', 'few', 'Joannes', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'sharing', 'not', 'imply', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'are', 'meaningless', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'sports', 'cigars', ""'re"", 'doing', 'what', 'composer', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'described', 'so', 'aptly', 'when', 'referring', 'folks', ""shakin'hands"", 'sayin', ""'How"", 'do', 'do', 'really', 'are', 'kinda', 'sorta', 'saying', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'schmaltzy', 'here', 'SMOKE', 'eyes', 'heart', 'employing', 'such', 'time', 'honored', 'devices', 'allowing', 'characters', 'keep', 'rough-edged', 'exteriors', 'letting', 'audience', 'see', 'soft', 'hearts', 'underneath', 'Take', 'two', 'father-child', 'reunion', 'sub-plots', 'father-son', 're-encounter', 'one', 'ultimately', 'sharply', 'father-daughter', 'reunion', 'intents', 'purposes', 'total', 'failure', 'even', 'tragic', 'instance', 'may', 'be', 'grain', 'hope', 'tucked', 'away', 'thanks', 'selflessness', 'man', 'who', 'really', ""n't"", 'believe', 'lost', 'girl', 'biological', 'father', 'willingness', 'come', 'aide', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'likely', 'NOT', 'flesh', 'blood', 'speaks', 'volumes', 'true', 'meaning', 'charity', 'village', 'borough.It', 'bothers', 'somewhat', 'film', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'format', 'have', 'been', 'marketed', 'laff-riot', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'was', 'true', 'when', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'case', 'big', 'mistake', 'cheery', 'illustration', 'Keitel', 'flanked', 'healthy-looking', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'sexy', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'movie', 'harsher', 'reality', 'Yes', 'SMOKE', 'offer', 'few', 'laughs', 'are', 'hard', 'won', 'even', 'little', 'bitter', 'tagline', 'Where', 'SMOKE', 'laughter', ""n't"", 'even', 'half', 'story', 'are', 'tears', 'too', 'course', 'cold', 'reality', 'staring', 'face', 'are', 'real', 'mensches', 'who', 'help', 'make', 'bearable']",N/A

For those of you that live in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, you'll love seeing that part of town on film including the ""J"" train as it slowly creeps up the track towards the Williamsburgh Bridge and BedStuy off in the hazy distance and the old Williamsburgh Bank in the foreground.  It's a long lazy shot and I find myself sometimes watching that scene over and over again.  It's a beautiful shot of that part of Brooklyn.  Close enough to hear the train but far enough to keep the other city noises in the background.  Utterly beautiful!This film is full of quirky characters.  Auggie (Harvey Keitel) is probably the most off beat and quirky of them all.  Stockard Channing gives a stunning performance as Auggie's ex girlfriend and Ashley Judd is brilliant, even though she only has one scene, as their drug addicted, poor and bitter daughter.  The film also stars William Hurt (Altered States), Harold Perrineau Jr, (Romeo&Juliet;) and Forest Whitaker (Panic Room).The most unexpected moment in Smoke is Auggie's Christmas story.  I don't want to give too much away but it's sad, touching and funny all at the same time.  Don't look for special effects, explosions, car chases or gun fights here.  There are none.  Just good storytelling.Also interesting are the bonus attractions on the dvd.  Seeing the director (Wayne Wang) direct another director (Forest Whitaker) and watching Whitaker accept and discuss Wang's directions were especially captivating.All in all, a lovely film to curl up with.

Some emphasize the dialogue, some the specialeffects, others the story.In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that arekeep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of themovie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get aglimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of asmall 7-11 style store in a major city.William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises thetough-guy with a big heart role.The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTIONbut it does have a very soft or human side to it, thatwill appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, thoseover 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones ofhuman interaction, the small and introverted lifestylesthat sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.The key here, is showing people their human sides, andwillingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life inpeace with one another, responsibly.Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixedwith urban living, realism, drama and responsibility ineach moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that targetthe below 17 age bracket.Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn toenjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING actingtalent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of myfavorite actresses, she really does a shocking role inthis movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, notunlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Juddthat we used to see, in other movies of the same period,such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performanceswith Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in adifferent phase of her life than before, but inSMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab yourattention.In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of thepicture and audio, is top-notch.",5,A small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting talent,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2123,"['are', 'movies', 'moods', 'tastes', 'alloccasions', 'emphasize', 'dialogue', 'specialeffects', 'others', 'story.In', 'movie', 'wide', 'range', 'aspects', 'arekeep', 'viewers', 'keenly', 'watching', 'unrolling', 'themovie', 'such', 'time', 'quite', 'quickly', 'get', 'aglimpse', 'microcosm', 'surrounding', 'customers', 'asmall', '7-11', 'style', 'store', 'major', 'city.William', 'Hurt', 'character', 'own', 'natural', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'who', 'thetough-guy', 'big', 'heart', 'role.The', 'movie', 'not', 'chick-flick', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'such', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'SOMEONE', 'LIKE', 'YOU/', 'ANIMAL', 'ATTRACTIONbut', 'have', 'very', 'soft', 'human', 'side', 'thatwill', 'appear', 'perhaps', 'older', 'audiences', 'meaning', 'thoseover', '23', 'emphasis', 'various', 'tones', 'ofhuman', 'interaction', 'small', 'introverted', 'lifestylesthat', 'sometimes', 'people', 'have', 'large', 'city', 'neighborhoods.The', 'key', 'here', 'showing', 'people', 'human', 'sides', 'andwillingness', 'grow', 'help', 'neighbors', 'life', 'inpeace', 'one', 'responsibly.Clearly', 'types', 'movies', 'showing', 'nostalgia', 'mixedwith', 'urban', 'living', 'realism', 'drama', 'responsibility', 'ineach', 'moment', 'are', 'not', 'norm', 'considering', 'fantasy', 'unreal', 'stories', 'often', 'chosen', 'Hollywood', 'targetthe', '17', 'age', 'bracket.Perhaps', 'end', 'day', 'everyone', 'will', 'learn', 'toenjoy', 'small', 'urban', 'tale', 'featuring', 'OUTSTANDING', 'actingtalent', 'William', 'Hurt', 'legendary', 'Harvey', 'Keitel.As', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'extremely', 'versatile', 'one', 'myfavorite', 'actresses', 'really', 'shocking', 'role', 'inthis', 'movie', 'playing', 'delinquent', 'adolescent', 'girl', 'other', 'movie', 'NORMAL', 'LIFE', 'old', 'Juddthat', 'used', 'see', 'other', 'movies', 'same', 'period', 'such', 'Ruby', 'Paradise', 'Passion', 'Darkly', 'Noon', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Locusts', 'great', 'performanceswith', 'Judd', 'later', 'movies', 'seem', 'show', 'Judd', 'adifferent', 'phase', 'life', 'before', 'inSMOKE', 'Judd', '5', 'minute', 'performance', 'will', 'surely', 'grab', 'yourattention.In', 'terms', 'DVD', 'edition', 'colors', 'sharpness', 'thepicture', 'audio', 'top-notch']",N/A

Not to say there couldn't have been some things done better here, but Wang takes Paul Auster's script and a fantastic stable of actors and just lets them loose. By all reports, Auster's script ended up taking quite a beating at the hands of the actors-- how much of the movie's dialogue is improvised has been a hotly-debated topic for years, but even the most conservative figures are pretty high-- but the end result is worthwhile.The movie focuses around Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel), the owner of a cigar store, and his customer/friend Paul Benjamin (William Hurt), a writer trying to overcome the recent death of his wife. In the main storyline, into their lives steps Rashid Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau), a kid on the run from a couple of gangsters. The movie then spins off onto tangents involving Rashid, Paul, and Auggie separately-- Rashid finds out his father (Forest Whitaker) is alive and living outside the city, Auggie's ex-girlfriend Ruby (Stockard Channing) shows up to tell him he's got an eighteen-year-old daughter, Paul; of course, is still dealing with his wife, and the resulting writers' block.With all that Wang tries to fit into a surprisingly short movie, some of the plotlines get short shrift. Especially puzzling is the minuscule amount of screen time given Ashley Judd, who plays Auggie's daughter; their brief conversation opens a lot of doors into a lot of different places this movie (or a sequel) could have gone, and there's no follow-up. But still, what's here is grand, and well worth watching. *** ",4,Harvey Keitel... as a GOOD guy!,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1673,"['Smoke', 'Wayne', 'Wang', '1995', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'had', 'kind', 'up-and-down', 'career', 'years', 'Smoke', 'definitely', 'one', 'up', 'moments', 'Not', 'say', 'there', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'things', 'done', 'better', 'here', 'Wang', 'Paul', 'Auster', 'script', 'fantastic', 'stable', 'actors', 'just', 'lets', 'loose', 'reports', 'Auster', 'script', 'ended', 'up', 'taking', 'quite', 'beating', 'hands', 'actors', 'how', 'much', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'improvised', 'been', 'hotly-debated', 'topic', 'years', 'even', 'most', 'conservative', 'figures', 'are', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'result', 'worthwhile.The', 'movie', 'Auggie', 'Wren', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'owner', 'cigar', 'store', 'customer/friend', 'Paul', 'Benjamin', 'William', 'Hurt', 'writer', 'trying', 'overcome', 'recent', 'death', 'wife', 'main', 'storyline', 'lives', 'steps', 'Rashid', 'Cole', 'Lost', 'Harold', 'Perrineau', 'kid', 'run', 'couple', 'gangsters', 'movie', 'then', 'tangents', 'involving', 'Rashid', 'Paul', 'Auggie', 'separately', 'Rashid', 'out', 'father', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'alive', 'living', 'city', 'Auggie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Ruby', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'up', 'tell', 'got', 'eighteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'Paul', 'course', 'still', 'dealing', 'wife', 'resulting', 'writers', 'block.With', 'Wang', 'fit', 'surprisingly', 'short', 'movie', 'plotlines', 'get', 'short', 'shrift', 'Especially', 'puzzling', 'minuscule', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'given', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'who', 'Auggie', 'daughter', 'brief', 'conversation', 'lot', 'doors', 'lot', 'different', 'places', 'movie', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'follow-up', 'still', 'what', 'here', 'grand', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', '***']",N/A

It is a character driven movie and is mostly interesting dialogue between the characters. Harvey Kietel shines as Auggie the part owner of a small tobacco store in Brooklyn. The movie revolves around the characters that he encounters and that come in and out of his store on a daily basis. William Hurt is great as a broken and shattered writer. His scenes with Kietel are the highlights of the movie. The final scene 'Auggies Christmas Story' is touching and brilliant. Forrest Widaker also has a very big part in a subplot involving an accident that cost him his arm and the child that he never knew. Also Stockard Channing and Harvey have great scenes together including with a very young Ashley Judd in her first role (I think).There is a companion piece movie called Blue in the Face that has many of the same characters including Harvey Kietel as Auggie but its not as good and is more of a bunch of thrown together comedy skits and funny short little scenes but its worth watching to especially if you like Smoke but its no where near as good.,4,Weight of Smoke...,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1113,"['just', 'love', 'movie', 'time', 'favorite', 'mine', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', 'mostly', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'shines', 'Auggie', 'part', 'owner', 'small', 'tobacco', 'store', 'Brooklyn', 'movie', 'characters', 'come', 'store', 'daily', 'basis', 'William', 'Hurt', 'great', 'broken', 'shattered', 'writer', 'scenes', 'Kietel', 'are', 'highlights', 'movie', 'final', 'scene', ""'Auggies"", 'Christmas', 'Story', 'touching', 'brilliant', 'Forrest', 'Widaker', 'also', 'very', 'big', 'part', 'subplot', 'involving', 'accident', 'cost', 'arm', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'Also', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'Harvey', 'have', 'great', 'scenes', 'together', 'including', 'very', 'young', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'first', 'role', 'think', 'companion', 'piece', 'movie', 'called', 'Blue', 'Face', 'many', 'same', 'characters', 'including', 'Harvey', 'Kietel', 'Auggie', 'not', 'good', 'more', 'bunch', 'thrown', 'together', 'comedy', 'skits', 'funny', 'short', 'little', 'scenes', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'like', 'Smoke', 'where', 'near', 'good']",N/A
