1149201,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0015AOBOA,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","Blondie - Collectors EditionBlondie and Dagwood were taken from the popular comic strip from the 1930s. Twenty-eight movies were produced from 1938 to 1950 until a scandal with one actor put an end to the series. This is the complete set of `B' pictures that ran for about seventy minutes each. They starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake. Hollywood produced films from characters in newspaper comic strips. The ""Blondie"" comic strip began in the early 1930s and is still published after nearly eight decades. Many other comic strips from that time are long gone. The comic situations which reflect ordinary realities continue. The public accepted Hollywood's portrayal of ordinary family life and its stereotypes. The two or three films produced each year were all good. Some of the details told about the times like other films of that era. Have they aged well? Look at the family comedies of today for comparison. Dorothy McNulty made her debut in ""After the Thin Man"".I don't know the reason why Dagwood is portrayed as a bungler and Blondie as all-knowing, but it was acceptable to the audiences. Dagwood is shown as having a private office and the principal assistant to J. C. Dithers, the owner of a construction company. The shaky employment prospects of Dagwood as a white-collar worker must have resonated with the primarily blue-collar audiences. The Bumsteads live in their own home, they are not renters in an apartment or tenement. Note how few people own a car, people lived near work and shopping. These films provide a look at life from seventy years ago. What did you notice? Note how conflicts over money cause most of the problems. Blondie handles the money and budget in these movies. In real life Dagwood the professional would likely have done this. Here are the movies in historical order.Blondie (1938); Blondie Meets the Boss (1939)Blondie Takes a Vacation (1939); Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939)Blondie on a Budget (1940); Blondie Has Servant Trouble (1940)Blondie Plays Cupid (1940); Blondie Goes Latin (1941)Blondie In Society (1941); Blondie Goes to College (1942)Blondie's Blessed Event (1942); Blondie For Victory (1942)It's a Great Life (1943); Foot Light Glamour (1943)Leave it to Blondie (1945); Life With Blondie (1945)Blondie's Lucky Day (1946); Blondie Knows Best (1946)Blondie's Big Moment (1947); Blondie's Holiday (1947)Blondie's in the Dough (1947); Blondie's Anniversary (1947)Blondie's Reward (1948); Blondie's Secret (1948)Blondie's Big Deal (1949); Blondie Hits the Jackpot (1949)Blondie's Hero (1950); Beware of Blondie (1950)",4,The Twenty-Eight Movies,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,2572,"['Blondie', 'Collectors', 'EditionBlondie', 'Dagwood', 'were', 'taken', 'popular', 'comic', 'strip', '1930s', 'Twenty-eight', 'movies', 'were', 'produced', '1938', '1950', 'scandal', 'one', 'actor', 'put', 'end', 'series', 'complete', 'set', 'B', 'pictures', 'ran', 'seventy', 'minutes', 'starred', 'Penny', 'Singleton', 'Arthur', 'Lake', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'films', 'characters', 'newspaper', 'comic', 'strips', 'Blondie', 'comic', 'strip', 'began', 'early', '1930s', 'still', 'published', 'nearly', 'eight', 'decades', 'Many', 'other', 'comic', 'strips', 'time', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'comic', 'situations', 'reflect', 'ordinary', 'realities', 'continue', 'public', 'accepted', 'Hollywood', 'portrayal', 'ordinary', 'family', 'life', 'stereotypes', 'two', 'three', 'films', 'produced', 'year', 'were', 'good', 'details', 'told', 'times', 'other', 'films', 'era', 'Have', 'aged', 'well', 'Look', 'family', 'comedies', 'today', 'comparison', 'Dorothy', 'McNulty', 'made', 'debut', 'Thin', 'Man', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reason', 'why', 'Dagwood', 'portrayed', 'bungler', 'Blondie', 'all-knowing', 'was', 'acceptable', 'audiences', 'Dagwood', 'shown', 'having', 'private', 'office', 'principal', 'assistant', 'J.', 'C.', 'Dithers', 'owner', 'construction', 'company', 'shaky', 'employment', 'prospects', 'Dagwood', 'white-collar', 'worker', 'must', 'have', 'resonated', 'primarily', 'blue-collar', 'audiences', 'Bumsteads', 'live', 'own', 'home', 'are', 'not', 'renters', 'apartment', 'tenement', 'Note', 'how', 'few', 'people', 'own', 'car', 'people', 'lived', 'work', 'shopping', 'films', 'provide', 'look', 'life', 'seventy', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'did', 'notice', 'Note', 'how', 'conflicts', 'money', 'cause', 'most', 'problems', 'Blondie', 'money', 'budget', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'Dagwood', 'professional', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'done', 'Here', 'are', 'movies', 'historical', 'order.Blondie', '1938', 'Blondie', 'Meets', 'Boss', '1939', 'Blondie', 'Takes', 'Vacation', '1939', 'Blondie', 'Brings', 'Up', 'Baby', '1939', 'Blondie', 'Budget', '1940', 'Blondie', 'Has', 'Servant', 'Trouble', '1940', 'Blondie', 'Plays', 'Cupid', '1940', 'Blondie', 'Goes', 'Latin', '1941', 'Blondie', 'Society', '1941', 'Blondie', 'Goes', 'College', '1942', 'Blondie', 'Blessed', 'Event', '1942', 'Blondie', 'Victory', '1942', 'Great', 'Life', '1943', 'Foot', 'Light', 'Glamour', '1943', 'Leave', 'Blondie', '1945', 'Life', 'Blondie', '1945', 'Blondie', 'Lucky', 'Day', '1946', 'Blondie', 'Knows', 'Best', '1946', 'Blondie', 'Big', 'Moment', '1947', 'Blondie', 'Holiday', '1947', 'Blondie', 'Dough', '1947', 'Blondie', 'Anniversary', '1947', 'Blondie', 'Reward', '1948', 'Blondie', 'Secret', '1948', 'Blondie', 'Big', 'Deal', '1949', 'Blondie', 'Jackpot', '1949', 'Blondie', 'Hero', '1950', 'Beware', 'Blondie', '1950']",BLONDIE-COLLECTORS EDITION-9 DISC BOXED SET-28 MOVIES W/ INTERACTIVE DVD MOTION MENUS

Picture quality varies, with none being either poor or pristine.BLONDIEANA--Penny Singleton co-starred with Arthur Lake in 28 BLONDIE comedies that were based on Chic Young's popular comic strip. Simultaneous to the movie series, they both had a decade-long ""Blondie"" CBS radio show. After the movie series ended in 1950 and with the demise of the Blondie television sitcom, this catalogue found renewed life on TV and ran for many years, most often as an hour-long Saturday afternoon show.Miss Singleton began in vaudeville, where she was part of a children's act with Milton Berle and Gene Raymond. Outside of Blondie, she is best remembered as the voice of Jane Jetson.Originally a child acrobat in the circus and then a dancer, Arthur Lake (along with Barbara Britton) helped resurrect 'Blondie' as a short-lived 1957 TV sitcom. It was his last Show Biz job. Lake's older sister Florence was the motor mouthed wife of long-suffering Edgar Kennedy in dozens ofRKO ""Average Man"" shorts.Larry Simms played toddler Baby Dumpling in the early Blondie films and stayed with the series to the end. In '43 his character name was changed to Alexander. Simms appeared in a handful of films outside of Blondie, receiving screen credit as ""Baby Dumpling"" forMR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON(1939). Under his own name he also played the youthful Pete Bailey inIT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE(1946). Larry's career essentially ended with Blondie.The 1943-50 screen r&eacute;sum&eacute; of Marjorie Ann Mutchie (Cookie Bumstead) consists solely of 16 Blondie films.",4,Bumstead trivia,1259020800,"11 24, 2009",2009,1641,"['mentioned', 'others', 'here', 'BLONDIE', 'programmers', 'do', ""n't"", 'contain', 'original', 'opening', 'credits', 'Picture', 'quality', 'varies', 'none', 'being', 'poor', 'pristine.BLONDIEANA', 'Penny', 'Singleton', 'co-starred', 'Arthur', 'Lake', '28', 'BLONDIE', 'comedies', 'were', 'based', 'Chic', 'Young', 'popular', 'comic', 'strip', 'Simultaneous', 'movie', 'series', 'had', 'decade-long', 'Blondie', 'CBS', 'radio', 'show', 'movie', 'series', 'ended', '1950', 'demise', 'Blondie', 'television', 'sitcom', 'catalogue', 'found', 'renewed', 'life', 'TV', 'ran', 'many', 'years', 'most', 'often', 'hour-long', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'show.Miss', 'Singleton', 'began', 'vaudeville', 'where', 'was', 'part', 'children', 'act', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Gene', 'Raymond', 'Blondie', 'best', 'remembered', 'voice', 'Jane', 'Jetson.Originally', 'child', 'acrobat', 'circus', 'then', 'dancer', 'Arthur', 'Lake', 'Barbara', 'Britton', 'helped', 'resurrect', ""'Blondie"", 'short-lived', '1957', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'was', 'last', 'Show', 'Biz', 'job', 'Lake', 'older', 'sister', 'Florence', 'was', 'motor', 'mouthed', 'wife', 'long-suffering', 'Edgar', 'Kennedy', 'dozens', 'ofRKO', 'Average', 'Man', 'shorts.Larry', 'Simms', 'played', 'toddler', 'Baby', 'Dumpling', 'early', 'Blondie', 'films', 'stayed', 'series', 'end', ""'43"", 'character', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'Alexander', 'Simms', 'appeared', 'handful', 'films', 'Blondie', 'receiving', 'screen', 'credit', 'Baby', 'Dumpling', 'forMR', 'SMITH', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WASHINGTON', '1939', 'own', 'name', 'also', 'played', 'youthful', 'Pete', 'Bailey', 'inIT', 'WONDERFUL', 'LIFE', '1946', 'Larry', 'career', 'essentially', 'ended', 'Blondie.The', '1943-50', 'screen', 'r', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'Marjorie', 'Ann', 'Mutchie', 'Cookie', 'Bumstead', 'solely', '16', 'Blondie', 'films']",BLONDIE-COLLECTORS EDITION-9 DISC BOXED SET-28 MOVIES W/ INTERACTIVE DVD MOTION MENUS

Shemp Howard even guested in one movie (very well).As in many B movie series of those days, the first films were very well made in order to establish the series. The first 4 years of movies were all excellent here. As the series became more established, the quality of the Blondie movies in later years was not as consistent.

I taped most of the series on VHS when shown on various networks about twenty five years ago. When one of the tapes recently came unwound I decided to purchase this set.  I had read various reviews of this stating that the sequencing was off somewhat and that these DVDs were recorded from VHS versions. They are not the movies released by Columbia, they are recorded from the versions released by television. It was also stated that many people found this problem with the pacing irritating, (by the pacing it means that the film may slow somewhat - it's not playing at normal speed). Also the soundtrack was a little creaky as well. I played the first Blondie episode from this set and found the pacing problem very irritating. I have much better quality in my VHS tapes. The second and third episodes that I played from this set weren't as bad as the first, but, there were some pacing problems as well. However, I can live with it as I really love this series.
