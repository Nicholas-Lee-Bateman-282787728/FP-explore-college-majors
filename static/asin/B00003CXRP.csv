When I went to see this, I was expecting a pretty typical film that would pass the time.  I didn't get a whole lot more than that, but it wasn't bogged down with cliches.  I think the movie would have benefited more from going deeper into the feelings of loneliness that, I assume, comes with being stranded on a desert island.  As far as &quot;night-out-with-friends-entertainment&quot; goes, it isn't bad.  One would think that a movie with just a man by himself would get boring, but thanks to somewhat-decent directing, the pace never becomes dull.

Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a busy Federal Express top employee, who's made this time-consuming and often unpredictable job his long-term career. The first plus point before the story takes over is that Hanks is not a man with nothing, who would not see surviving on his own instincts for a long time some sort of religious awakening. He does his best to squeeze his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) into a schedual so busy around the Holidays that he carries a beeper with him to Christmas dinner. On a last minuet flight for Fed-Ex on Christmas eve, a long and realistic plane crash scene leaves him stranded on a deserted island in the Pacific. In the 80s' especially weve scene Hanks' phenomenal comedic abilities, his obvious talent at drama and the trademark ways about him that, well...make him Tom Hanks. All are rolled into one in this movie, when he uses his only resources on the island provided by nature..(and a few Fed-Ex packages that followed him to shore) to stay alive. To tell the truth I thought a big jump in time as you'll see, would ruin the movies' genuine effect...but it does hardly that. I think after his rescue and return to what is now a strange place to him..the entire movie is summed up in a quiet speach he gives to a friend. He realizes that the harshes he faces returning to civilization cannot take-over him, that he has to stay alive. My favorite part would be Hanks striking a candle lighter, beginning to realize all of the things in life he'd taken for granted before his four years on the island. Dont let editorial reviews or Roger 'Fat' Ebert's thoughts on the movie decide for you whether or not to watch 'Cast Away'...sometimes I think movie-reviewers are payed to hate everything. 'Cast Away' is a refreshing and meaningful comedy/drama that will be well appreciated in the years to come...just think of ALL Tom Hanks' recent movies....",5,Tom Hanks Puts Special Touches Into This Role..,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,1996,"[""'Cast"", 'Away', 'emotional', 'more', 'relatable', 'step', 'up', ""'Lord"", 'Flies', 'average', 'quot', 'quot', 'movie', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Hanks', 'busy', 'Federal', 'Express', 'top', 'employee', 'who', 'made', 'time-consuming', 'often', 'unpredictable', 'job', 'long-term', 'career', 'first', 'point', 'story', 'over', 'Hanks', 'not', 'man', 'nothing', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'surviving', 'own', 'instincts', 'long', 'time', 'sort', 'religious', 'awakening', 'best', 'squeeze', 'girlfriend', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'schedual', 'so', 'busy', 'Holidays', 'beeper', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'last', 'minuet', 'flight', 'Fed-Ex', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'long', 'realistic', 'plane', 'crash', 'scene', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'Pacific', '80s', 'especially', 'weve', 'scene', 'Hanks', 'phenomenal', 'comedic', 'abilities', 'obvious', 'talent', 'drama', 'trademark', 'ways', 'well', 'make', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'are', 'rolled', 'one', 'movie', 'when', 'only', 'resources', 'island', 'provided', 'nature..', 'few', 'Fed-Ex', 'packages', 'followed', 'shore', 'stay', 'alive', 'tell', 'truth', 'thought', 'big', 'jump', 'time', ""'ll"", 'see', 'would', 'ruin', 'movies', 'genuine', 'effect', 'hardly', 'think', 'rescue', 'return', 'what', 'now', 'strange', 'place', 'him..the', 'entire', 'movie', 'summed', 'up', 'quiet', 'speach', 'friend', 'harshes', 'returning', 'civilization', 'can', 'not', 'take-over', 'stay', 'alive', 'favorite', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'Hanks', 'striking', 'candle', 'lighter', 'beginning', 'realize', 'things', 'life', ""'d"", 'taken', 'granted', 'four', 'years', 'island', 'Dont', 'let', 'editorial', 'reviews', 'Roger', ""'Fat"", 'Ebert', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'decide', 'not', 'watch', ""'Cast"", 'Away', 'sometimes', 'think', 'movie-reviewers', 'are', 'payed', 'hate', 'everything', ""'Cast"", 'Away', 'refreshing', 'meaningful', 'comedy/drama', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'appreciated', 'years', 'come', 'just', 'think', 'ALL', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'recent', 'movies']",N/A

Two scenes specially got me, when he looses Wilson, some people say to me the crying over a ball is dumb, but watch the movie and you will see why is that so sad.

Okay, put on your glasses and look again: That's right. There is a space between Cast and Away.Still don't get it? Then I have to say you are unable to view a piece of art objectively. This film is full of symbolism (maybe far too subtle for you guys who think this film is disappointing and awkwardly paced) and deliberation of creating spacial and chronical gap. Those who claimed the jump of four years is too sudden to make us sympathise with the character? To be honest if more scenes were included you would start whining that it is too long and boring. When a person is utterly alone on an island, having to learn how to survive from the ground up, time and space do not make sense. The four-year gap created just that.Tom Hanks performance? He is clearly robbed off an Oscar. Not that Russell Crowe is bad, but because Hanks is far more superior. The comments about he was overacting toward Wilson? Imagine if there is anyone else doing the exact same thing to a ball and still make you laugh, at the same time, break your heart. During the time on the island, there are no background music nor spetacular action sequence to keep our attention span running but Hanks' sole performance. Do you still think he is overrated? In the beginning he has already established his personality as this 'must-do-it-right' workaholic, and that last box he did not open is a mission that he needs to accomplish (notice that he only found it after he was settled on the island?) This unopened box is his hope. His hope back to where he was from.Think the ending is disappointing? Of course it is. It is the predicament of life (anyone recall the last scene of the movie?). Nothing in real life is always satisfying, and Cast Away tells us exactly that. At first it mercilessly strips us apart from the civilized materialism, then gives us hope and makes us strong. It shows us the majesty of mother nature and the struggle against the odds. It eventually takes us to where we are so used to call home and shatters us with the inevitiable truth of reality, of how cruel time could be. Finally, it reminds us how tiny we seem when standing in the middle of cross road, yet the hope is still vastly endless.We don't need to know what is in the box, just as we never need to find out what was stored in your neighbor's ice box. He achieved his mission of delivering the box back to its owner, (despite it disobeyed the over-night promise by FedEx) and that is what really matters.If you still don't get it, never mind. You've wasted your time watching a movie you pretend to understand and now you've wasted time reading what I have said. My sincere apology.

On each end of the movie is the story of his life back in the ""real world""; however, that story is somewhat undeveloped and underemphasized.  Before the crash he had just proposed to his fiance, and upon his return he finds that she is married with children (and on a side note, either time moved faster on the mainland or else his loving fiance was married and pregnant in less than a year after his disappearance).  I felt that subplot should have either been left alone or else dealt with in a more elaborate way; the ending left the movie feeling incomplete.However, the heart of the movie involves Chuck's time on the island, and it is simply Hanks at his best.  Chuck is alone, trying to survive; every little task could mean the difference between life and death.  For Hanks, this means he must display the gamut of emotions about seemingly trivial matters with no other actors to help with the illusion.  I know of no other actor that could have me to the point of tears when a volleyball starts to float away from him.  No offense to Russel Crowe, but how he won Best Actor for playing a stoic, monosyllabic gladiator over this performance is one of life's great mysteries.

534581,A1GOI8745FGIDN,B00003CXRP,"""an_avid_book_reviewer""","[6, 8]","This movie reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" because of the sentimental themes, the subtle, creative symbols, and the proactive, determined struggle of the main character, which happens to be played by Tom Hanks in both movies.The theme of this movie is about what is really important.  Chuck Noland (pun for ""no land"") works for Federal Express and oversees time management.  He thinks time is wasting and he doesn't know how right he is.  He's constantly working and flying all over the world.  He exchanges Christmas gifts with his girlfriend at the airport in the car then hands her a wrapped gift which is obviously an engagement ring.  He tells her to hold on to it until New Years Eve, and promises he'll be with her then.  She gave him a family heirloom pocket watch with her picture in it.  He says he'll always keep it set to Dallas time and then rushes to his plane, which tragically crashes into the ocean.He is the sole survivor but luckily he managed to float on a liferaft overnight and by morning stumbled upon a small uninhabited island.  This is where he begins being what is called proactive-- he deals best he can with what life dealt him.  He is resourceful and exercises initiative.  The bulk of the movie, his stay on the island, is very unique because he is the only human being shown, there is no music, yet it never ceases to be fascinating.  He could just wither away and die or even commit suicide, which he almost does, but he decides to live.  But for what?  Namely for his girlfriend, whom he thinks about constantly and keeps the pocketwatch open to her picture.  Symbolically, while the plane was losing control, he dropped the watch and risked his life to get it before it fell out of the broken plane.  The plane crash symbolizes the harm of overcommitment to work and being too busy and focused on schedules and time.  The watch symbolizes his life back at civilization.  The plane crash made the watch stop ticking.  I also think he decides to live just for the sake of life itself even with all its discomforts.  A great turning point and memorable scene of the movie is when he bravely decides to voyage off the island on a raft he constructed.  He could easily die in the middle of the ocean but the reward is to possibly get back to civilization.The reason it is a turning point in the movie is because when he gets back, it actually seems as if he were better off on the island.  As he's floating away from the island, he looks back at it and you can feel that he will miss it because of all his hard work, all he went through, and all he achieved.  Notice the title of the movie is ""Cast Away"" not ""Castaway"".  This is because the real point is that being cast away by his lover was worse than being a castaway for four years.  On the island, he yearned for companionship so bad he actually developed a relationship with a volleyball.  Of course everyone thought he was long dead, including his girlfriend.  So she married someone else and had kids.  His friends throw a party for him, but he seems the least happy one there, thinking of whether or not he'll get his girlfriend back.  Her husband greets him awkwardly as we would expect him to and explains that his wife is confused and doesn't want to see him right away.  However, he should have at least prepared a little better as to what to say to him and been friendlier.  Symbolically, he is a dentist and once performed a root canal on Chuck.  At this point, I really felt contempt for her new husband and I was rooting for Chuck.  I felt he deserved her after all he went through and how he never stopped loving her even after being away for four years.She seems ambivalent and confused at first, having meetings with Chuck and showing him the news articles and scrapbook she has of him and how she kept the Jeep that they were in together last at the airport.  As he drives away in it, she chases him and kisses him and tells him he's the love of her life.  Yet, her decision soon becomes clear as she goes back to her new husband, expensive house, and children.  I felt so sad for Chuck.Of all the packages that washed ashore, he kept the last one unopened.  He finally delivered it in person when he got back.  Saving this package for that purpose shows his determination and hope for the future.  Why else would he have saved it?  Just like in Forrest Gump, this is a subtle, curious action.  He leaves a note saying the package saved his life.  No one is home and we never learn what was in the package or their response.  The package was of no tangible use to him like the contents of the other packages but it was the hope that he would be able to deliver it that saved his life.  As he's leaving, he stands at a crossroads.  He's out west where miles of flat ground stretch all around him.  A pretty, vivacious woman drives up and tells him the names of each of the roads and where they lead.  I wondered why he just let her drive away when she seems interested in him and he's single trying to get over a lost love.  The movie ends there, with Chuck standing at the crossroads not knowing where to go next, symbolizing how his life has been turned upside down twice and the big question on his mind is, ""Now what?""  The messages of the movie are that close relationships are more important than working and that we've got to do the best we can with the cards life deals us.",5,"Great Scenes, Great Story, Great Acting, Great Theme.",1013558400,"02 13, 2002",2002,5379,"['movie', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'sentimental', 'themes', 'subtle', 'creative', 'symbols', 'proactive', 'determined', 'struggle', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movies.The', 'theme', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'pun', 'land', 'Federal', 'Express', 'time', 'management', 'time', 'wasting', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'right', 'constantly', 'working', 'flying', 'world', 'exchanges', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'girlfriend', 'airport', 'car', 'then', 'wrapped', 'gift', 'obviously', 'engagement', 'ring', 'hold', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', ""'ll"", 'be', 'then', 'gave', 'family', 'heirloom', 'pocket', 'watch', 'picture', ""'ll"", 'always', 'keep', 'set', 'Dallas', 'time', 'then', 'rushes', 'plane', 'tragically', 'ocean.He', 'sole', 'survivor', 'luckily', 'managed', 'float', 'liferaft', 'overnight', 'morning', 'stumbled', 'small', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'where', 'being', 'what', 'called', 'proactive', 'can', 'what', 'life', 'dealt', 'resourceful', 'initiative', 'bulk', 'movie', 'stay', 'island', 'very', 'unique', 'only', 'human', 'being', 'shown', 'music', 'never', 'be', 'fascinating', 'could', 'just', 'wither', 'away', 'die', 'even', 'commit', 'suicide', 'almost', 'live', 'what', 'Namely', 'girlfriend', 'whom', 'constantly', 'pocketwatch', 'open', 'picture', 'Symbolically', 'plane', 'was', 'losing', 'control', 'dropped', 'watch', 'risked', 'life', 'get', 'fell', 'broken', 'plane', 'plane', 'crash', 'harm', 'overcommitment', 'work', 'being', 'too', 'busy', 'focused', 'schedules', 'time', 'watch', 'life', 'back', 'civilization', 'plane', 'crash', 'made', 'watch', 'stop', 'ticking', 'also', 'think', 'live', 'just', 'sake', 'life', 'even', 'discomforts', 'great', 'turning', 'point', 'memorable', 'scene', 'movie', 'when', 'bravely', 'voyage', 'off', 'island', 'raft', 'constructed', 'could', 'easily', 'die', 'middle', 'ocean', 'reward', 'possibly', 'get', 'back', 'civilization.The', 'reason', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'because', 'when', 'back', 'actually', 'were', 'better', 'off', 'island', 'floating', 'away', 'island', 'back', 'can', 'feel', 'will', 'miss', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'achieved', 'Notice', 'title', 'movie', 'Cast', 'Away', 'not', 'Castaway', 'real', 'point', 'being', 'cast', 'away', 'lover', 'was', 'worse', 'being', 'castaway', 'four', 'years', 'island', 'yearned', 'companionship', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'developed', 'relationship', 'volleyball', 'course', 'everyone', 'thought', 'was', 'long', 'dead', 'including', 'girlfriend', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'kids', 'friends', 'throw', 'party', 'least', 'happy', 'one', 'there', 'thinking', 'not', ""'ll"", 'get', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'husband', 'awkwardly', 'would', 'expect', 'wife', 'confused', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'right', 'away', 'However', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'prepared', 'little', 'better', 'what', 'say', 'been', 'friendlier', 'Symbolically', 'dentist', 'once', 'performed', 'root', 'canal', 'Chuck', 'point', 'really', 'felt', 'contempt', 'new', 'husband', 'was', 'rooting', 'Chuck', 'felt', 'deserved', 'went', 'how', 'never', 'stopped', 'loving', 'even', 'being', 'away', 'four', 'years.She', 'ambivalent', 'confused', 'first', 'having', 'meetings', 'Chuck', 'showing', 'news', 'articles', 'scrapbook', 'how', 'kept', 'Jeep', 'were', 'together', 'last', 'airport', 'away', 'love', 'life', 'decision', 'soon', 'becomes', 'clear', 'back', 'new', 'husband', 'expensive', 'house', 'children', 'felt', 'so', 'sad', 'Chuck.Of', 'packages', 'washed', 'ashore', 'kept', 'last', 'one', 'unopened', 'finally', 'delivered', 'person', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'Saving', 'package', 'purpose', 'determination', 'hope', 'future', 'Why', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'Just', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'subtle', 'curious', 'action', 'note', 'saying', 'package', 'saved', 'life', 'one', 'home', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'was', 'package', 'response', 'package', 'was', 'tangible', 'use', 'contents', 'other', 'packages', 'was', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'deliver', 'saved', 'life', 'leaving', 'crossroads', 'out', 'west', 'where', 'miles', 'flat', 'ground', 'stretch', 'pretty', 'vivacious', 'woman', 'up', 'names', 'roads', 'where', 'lead', 'wondered', 'why', 'just', 'let', 'drive', 'away', 'when', 'interested', 'single', 'trying', 'get', 'lost', 'love', 'movie', 'there', 'Chuck', 'standing', 'crossroads', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'go', 'next', 'symbolizing', 'how', 'life', 'been', 'turned', 'upside', 'twice', 'big', 'question', 'mind', 'Now', 'what', 'messages', 'movie', 'are', 'close', 'relationships', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'working', ""'ve"", 'got', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'cards', 'life', 'deals']",N/A

And this is a movie fan who has seen Gone With the Wind, The Magnificent Ambersons, and countless other movies a lot of people consider long and boring, more times than I can count.

534585,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXRP,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Everyone that I know either loves this movie or hates it.  They either find it completely engrossing or mind-numbingly boring.  I'm kind of in the middle.  I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.  It has to, since he is the only person on screen for nearly the entire running length.The film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED-EX systems engineer who finds himself stranded on an island for four years after the plain he is on crashes into the ocean during a terrible storm.  He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.For me, it is hard to really build a film based solely on a man's solitary survival.  There is not a whole lot you can do, and while the film's execution of Chuck's adventures are startlingly engaging, when the film ended I felt as if it was just beginning.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.  Yes, his escapades on the island are necessary to establish growth and that survival instinct (and the way that Zemeckis films the island itself perfectly establishes to `gravity' of the whole experience) but when all is said and done, this is about how this experience CHANGES a person, and I feel like we only witnessed to very beginning of that change.Alas, I still really like this movie.Like I mentioned, Tom Hanks is not an actor I am usually drawn to.  I find a lot of his work highly overrated and even gimmicky and amateurish (his two Oscar wins themselves are disgusting) but here he transcends gimmick (I mean, this is a gimmicky character) and develops a REAL man.  He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.  This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.  I think that Hanks' performance is also a reason why I hate the ending of the film.  He was doing such a riveting job that I really wanted him to sink his teeth into Chuck's `afterlife' SOOOOO much (no, he doesn't die...by afterlife I meant `life after his rescue').If I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.Anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.  It has been mentioned (and I agree) that this film lacks a tad of the emotional punch (emotional `human' punch) that it tries to convey, but I feel that that punch would have been achieved had Chuck's story continued.",4,Hanks at his finest...,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,2563,"['Everyone', 'know', 'movie', 'find', 'completely', 'engrossing', 'mind-numbingly', 'boring', ""'m"", 'kind', 'middle', 'find', 'tad', 'long', 'find', 'Hanks', 'be', 'surprisingly', 'riveting', ""'m"", 'not', 'always', 'sold', 'talent', 'strong', 'performance', 'film', 'only', 'person', 'screen', 'nearly', 'entire', 'running', 'length.The', 'film', 'story', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'FED-EX', 'systems', 'engineer', 'who', 'stranded', 'island', 'four', 'years', 'plain', 'crashes', 'ocean', 'terrible', 'storm', 'obviously', 'experience', 'lasting', 'effect', 'Chuck.For', 'hard', 'really', 'build', 'film', 'based', 'solely', 'man', 'solitary', 'survival', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'can', 'do', 'film', 'execution', 'Chuck', 'adventures', 'are', 'startlingly', 'engaging', 'when', 'film', 'ended', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'beginning', 'most', 'intriguing', 'aspect', 'story', 'how', 'Chuck', 'AFTER', 'home', 'find', 'life', 'left', 'behind', 'mere', 'memory', 'Yes', 'escapades', 'island', 'are', 'necessary', 'establish', 'growth', 'survival', 'instinct', 'way', 'Zemeckis', 'films', 'island', 'perfectly', 'gravity', 'whole', 'experience', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'how', 'experience', 'CHANGES', 'person', 'feel', 'only', 'witnessed', 'very', 'beginning', 'change.Alas', 'still', 'really', 'movie.Like', 'mentioned', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'not', 'actor', 'am', 'usually', 'drawn', 'find', 'lot', 'work', 'highly', 'overrated', 'even', 'gimmicky', 'amateurish', 'two', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'are', 'disgusting', 'here', 'gimmick', 'mean', 'gimmicky', 'character', 'REAL', 'man', 'screen', '100', '%', 'time', 'never', 'resorts', 'taking', 'advantage', 'situation', 'entire', 'time', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'one', 'ranks', 'more', 'see', 'think', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'also', 'reason', 'why', 'hate', 'ending', 'film', 'was', 'doing', 'such', 'riveting', 'job', 'really', 'wanted', 'sink', 'teeth', 'Chuck', 'afterlife', 'SOOOOO', 'much', 'no', ""n't"", 'die', 'afterlife', 'meant', 'life', 'rescue', '.If', 'could', 'reshoot', 'reedit', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'happy.Anyways', 'end', 'Cast', 'Away', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'been', 'mentioned', 'agree', 'film', 'tad', 'emotional', 'punch', 'emotional', 'human', 'punch', 'convey', 'feel', 'punch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'achieved', 'had', 'Chuck', 'story', 'continued']",N/A

I just watched it twice again the last couple of days and have found things I missed in earlier viewings.  This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.Its fairly easy to perfunctorily view this film as a simple plot line: that is, man crashes in airplane, survives on island, loses lots of weight, grows beard, builds raft, gets back home, but, alas, not the ending he thought it could be. To view and absorb this movie on this superficial level is a waste of the art and symbolism that it contains.That's where the spiritual aspect of this film comes in that so many viewers have missed.  There is a great deal of spiritual symbolism on a deeper level.One reviewer thought it was weird that Tom Hanks made an imaginary friend in a Wilson Volleyball.  This is not strange at all.  I surmise that viewers that think along these lines have never spent great stretches of time alone without human contact.  To them I say, go camping alone for a month somewhere where you will not see people and you might begin to understand how ""Wilson"" helped keep Hanks alive.SYMBOLISMOK OK what is this symbolism I am speaking of???  The very last scene of the movie breaks us over the head with symbolism.  Hanks is standing in the flattest of the flat parts of Texas at a crossroads. Literally, he does not know what road to take.  Figuratively, metaphorically, his entire life is at a crossroads.  Chuck Logan has learned something new though.  He has been transformed by his experience and has learned how to listen to some voice deep inside instead of rushing around like a Fed Ex mad man.  He waits, contemplates until he feels his guide, the inner man, help him on his way.  This IN ESSENCE, is what this film is all about.THE WHALE:Whats with the whale and the spraying of the water.  Some people have missed that the spraying of the water is actually THE WHALE that has followed along with Hanks on the raft and has sprayed him, that is, woken him up out of his coma, at very key moments.  Some may think:  WOW, that is really far fetched.  Well then, I challenge you to go on a whale watch yourself if you have never done so.  When a whale comes as close to you as was accurately portrayed in this movie, raises its head out of the water, and its eye looks in yours and your eyes look into its eye, you can only come to one conclusion:  you are looking into the eye of an intelligent and sentient being that is quite capable of staying with Hanks.  Sailors have reported these experiences with whales time and again.No one has written about the GOLD WINGS symbol that Chuck Logan says saved his life.  Yes, that symbol saved his life but also Wilson saved his life, Kelly saved his life, the watch saved his life, and Chuck Logan saved his life by recognizing his powerlessness and transforming his life.",5,Awesome - Dig for the Deeper Meaning,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,2887,"['Many', 'have', 'written', 'great', 'reviews', 'awesome', 'movie', 'just', 'watched', 'twice', 'again', 'last', 'couple', 'days', 'have', 'found', 'things', 'missed', 'earlier', 'viewings', 'film', 'definitely', 'list', 'films', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again.Its', 'fairly', 'easy', 'perfunctorily', 'view', 'film', 'simple', 'plot', 'line', 'man', 'crashes', 'airplane', 'island', 'lots', 'weight', 'beard', 'raft', 'back', 'home', 'alas', 'not', 'ending', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'view', 'absorb', 'movie', 'superficial', 'level', 'waste', 'art', 'symbolism', 'contains.That', 'where', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'viewers', 'have', 'missed', 'great', 'deal', 'spiritual', 'symbolism', 'deeper', 'level.One', 'reviewer', 'thought', 'was', 'weird', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'made', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Wilson', 'Volleyball', 'not', 'strange', 'surmise', 'viewers', 'think', 'lines', 'have', 'never', 'spent', 'great', 'stretches', 'time', 'alone', 'human', 'contact', 'say', 'go', 'camping', 'alone', 'month', 'somewhere', 'where', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'people', 'might', 'begin', 'understand', 'how', 'Wilson', 'helped', 'keep', 'Hanks', 'alive.SYMBOLISMOK', 'OK', 'what', 'symbolism', 'am', 'speaking', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'head', 'symbolism', 'Hanks', 'standing', 'flattest', 'flat', 'parts', 'Texas', 'crossroads', 'Literally', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'road', 'take', 'Figuratively', 'metaphorically', 'entire', 'life', 'crossroads', 'Chuck', 'Logan', 'learned', 'something', 'new', 'been', 'transformed', 'experience', 'learned', 'how', 'listen', 'voice', 'deep', 'instead', 'rushing', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'mad', 'man', 'guide', 'inner', 'man', 'help', 'way', 'IN', 'ESSENCE', 'what', 'film', 'about.THE', 'WHALE', 'Whats', 'whale', 'spraying', 'water', 'people', 'have', 'missed', 'spraying', 'water', 'actually', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'followed', 'Hanks', 'raft', 'sprayed', 'woken', 'up', 'coma', 'very', 'key', 'moments', 'may', 'think', 'WOW', 'really', 'far', 'fetched', 'Well', 'then', 'challenge', 'go', 'whale', 'watch', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'so', 'When', 'whale', 'as', 'close', 'was', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'head', 'water', 'eye', 'yours', 'eyes', 'look', 'eye', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'one', 'conclusion', 'are', 'looking', 'eye', 'intelligent', 'sentient', 'being', 'quite', 'capable', 'staying', 'Hanks', 'Sailors', 'have', 'reported', 'experiences', 'whales', 'time', 'again.No', 'one', 'written', 'GOLD', 'WINGS', 'symbol', 'Chuck', 'Logan', 'saved', 'life', 'Yes', 'symbol', 'saved', 'life', 'also', 'Wilson', 'saved', 'life', 'Kelly', 'saved', 'life', 'watch', 'saved', 'life', 'Chuck', 'Logan', 'saved', 'life', 'recognizing', 'powerlessness', 'transforming', 'life']",N/A

It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it. Usually, those types of films are hollow and eye candy. That's okay too, you know. This film shows that they can also be the exact opposite. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a fed-ex worker who goes on a flight for a delivery and the plane crashes into the sea. Chuck drifts(on an inflatible boat)to a remote island. Chuck ends up spending four years on that island. His only companion is a volleyball named Wilson. Chuck wonders about his girlfriend back home, who's played by Helen Hunt. Hanks' performance is a one man showstopper. He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer. He deserves all of the attention and respect. He deserved the Oscar instead of Russell Crowe. Crowe wasn't anything stand-outish. If Hanks hadn't of won twice already, he would've won this too. Helen Hunt is usually good, but she is given way less to do here to really review. Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho. This movie defied all odds. It was one man on a deserted island for the majority of the film. Tons of film were without dialogue and music. Very risky and brave. Director Robert Zemeckis pulled it off brilliantly. He always does. This is a great, up-lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this. This is a Hollywood classic.

The scene in Russia was fabulous with his proving his point that it takes much too long to deliver packages long distance, or here in America.  He's an excellent actor, but as the movie progressed he regressed into a savage from a jungle.  Not just the ultimate survivor on an isolated island somewhere no one else ever comes near.I kept wanting some of the Gilligan's Island silliness to intervene with his deterioration mentally.  ""Wilson"" was the substitute for a real companion, yet only a volleyball gone astray.When I saw it was FedEx featured in this film, it delighted me as several weeks ago I wrote to the owner of a local radio station that maybe he'd never heard of FedEx.  It was taking too long to get a part for the transmitter for his station which aired ""Music Of Your Life"" network.  A few months previously, the same part was needed after a storm struck the antenna and it was 2 months or more before the network was back on local airwaves.  This time, the part apparently was never ordered.  So my reference to FedEx was not impressive to him as he owns a large sports equipment company in Nashville.  No FedEx for him!The preview to becoming a castaway was entertainment par excellence.  Afterward, however, his character becomes a mental case and it was not easy to watch.  Surely no place could be that isolated so as not to even have birds or animals, only a small type of fish and a scorpion which he ate -- showing he is the ultimate survivor.If he'd been stranded in Iceland or the North Pole, the story might have been believable, but on a beautiful island in the middle of nowhere was just too much.Thank goodness, he switched to playing character actors after that ordeal which suits him better anyway, for he is a good actor.  The movie itself was not much and very little dialogue which made it almost like watching a silent movie from the olden days with the exceptions of his grunts and guttural 'help's.",3,Lonely in Paradise.,1096156800,"09 26, 2004",2004,2061,"['started', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'regular', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'handsome', 'administrator', 'nationally', 'known', 'company', 'scene', 'Russia', 'was', 'fabulous', 'proving', 'point', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'deliver', 'packages', 'long', 'distance', 'here', 'America', 'excellent', 'actor', 'movie', 'progressed', 'regressed', 'savage', 'jungle', 'Not', 'just', 'ultimate', 'survivor', 'isolated', 'island', 'somewhere', 'one', 'else', 'ever', 'near.I', 'kept', 'wanting', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'silliness', 'intervene', 'deterioration', 'mentally', 'Wilson', 'was', 'substitute', 'real', 'companion', 'yet', 'only', 'volleyball', 'gone', 'astray.When', 'saw', 'was', 'FedEx', 'featured', 'film', 'delighted', 'several', 'weeks', 'ago', 'wrote', 'owner', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'FedEx', 'was', 'taking', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'part', 'transmitter', 'station', 'aired', 'Music', 'Your', 'Life', 'network', 'few', 'months', 'previously', 'same', 'part', 'was', 'needed', 'storm', 'struck', 'antenna', 'was', '2', 'months', 'more', 'network', 'was', 'back', 'local', 'airwaves', 'time', 'part', 'apparently', 'was', 'never', 'ordered', 'reference', 'FedEx', 'was', 'not', 'impressive', 'large', 'sports', 'equipment', 'company', 'Nashville', 'No', 'FedEx', 'preview', 'becoming', 'castaway', 'was', 'entertainment', 'par', 'excellence', 'Afterward', 'however', 'character', 'mental', 'case', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 'Surely', 'place', 'could', 'be', 'isolated', 'so', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'birds', 'animals', 'only', 'small', 'type', 'fish', 'scorpion', 'showing', 'ultimate', 'survivor.If', ""'d"", 'been', 'stranded', 'Iceland', 'North', 'Pole', 'story', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'beautiful', 'island', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much.Thank', 'goodness', 'switched', 'playing', 'character', 'actors', 'ordeal', 'suits', 'better', 'anyway', 'good', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'made', 'almost', 'watching', 'silent', 'movie', 'olden', 'days', 'exceptions', 'grunts', 'guttural', ""'help""]",N/A

I generally turn off the TV and dash back to my beloved computer. BUT Hanks grabbed me from the first scene of this powerful movie, holding me captive until the bittersweet ending. He's a fine actor and was superb in this role.Hanks plays the part of Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer on company business when the plane crashes and he ends up alone on a deserted island. The photography and visuals are excellent when they follow Chuck's progress as he does everything humanly possible in order to survive. His physical and mental regression are heart-breaking to see, yet the film has its uplifting moments when he makes ""friends"" with a Wilson volleyball, using it as a ""human"" sounding board to keep his sanity. He names the ball ""Wilson,"" of course. The scenes when he talks to the volleyball look rather ""insane,"" but are the few touches of humor in the film.The scene where Chuck ""loses"" Wilson touched my heart; a very moving moment. By that time in the movie, Director Robert Zemeckis's wisdom in choosing stark island scenes to emphasize Chuck's solitude were remarkably evident.Just how does Chuck lose Wilson? How does he react? How is he finally rescued? How has his life changed when he gets back to the real world? How?...How?...How? And Is his girlfriend--played brilliantly by the fine actress Helen Hunt--still waiting for him after four years when everyone thought he was dead?You will learn the answers to those questions as you view this film that is brought vividly to life through Hank's realistic portrayal and the director's keen insight into this character. The sound effects and rhythmic camera moves capture Chuck's emerging survival skills to perfection.""Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"" and after one episode when Chuck almost gives up, he never loses hope again, clinging to it despite the odds he's facing. His hope never seems to fail him until he returns home and faces his new reality in a very moving confrontation with the sweetheart he left behind. (Being a hopeless romantic, at that moment in the movie, I wanted this film to end the way I wanted it to...but that wasn't meant to be...)However, the film had a hopeful ending, one that left it up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. I know what ending I chose, so I was not left with a feeling of wonderment, but with a strong feeling of hope and a fresh start for Chuck. Why not see this film and choose your own ending?Even though it was rather odd for one man to carry an entire movie, that's what happened in this one--and Hanks was up to the job! I agree with the New York Post review: Tom Hanks ""...gives one of the towering screen performances of all time.""

534606,A382TU4RHJIPWL,B00003CXRP,B from America,"[0, 0]","Tom Hanks delivers another exceptional and emotional performance (Don't worry I'll back that up).  The film is not perfect, but it would be silly to expect it to be.  In the first act, you are introduced to Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex engineer.  We are given the idea that he is planning to ask Helen Hunt to marry him (giving her an obvious gift) but he decides to wait until he returns from his trip.  He leaves for his plane exclaiming, &quot;I'll be right back!&quot;, but that doesn't happen.  His plane goes down and he (being the lone survivor) washes up on an island with nothing but his clothes, a load of Fed Ex packages that wash ashore, and an antique watch that Helen Hunt gave him just before he left.  The second act, where the only life you see for a while is Hanks (I don't even think you see a bird or anything else until that whale), is the most compelling and memorable part of the film.  His relationship with &quot;Wilson&quot; the volleyball is more believable than the one he has with Helen Hunt (there is also more chemistry between the two).  I feel more sympathy when he loses &quot;Wilson&quot; than we he finds Hunt married with children.  The ending is a little weird but what did everyone expect, after 4 years?  Hunt's character  single and waiting in front of her house for someone she attended a funeral for?  The most important part of the film concerns his determination to stay alive on that little island, not his relationship with Hunt (Which, by the way, could have been played by just about any actress).  I don't think that this is just having to endure Hunt in every other movie since &quot;Good as it gets&quot; talking either.  There just isn't much chemistry between the two. It is not uncommon for Hunt to lack chemistry with a male character or for there to be some confusion as to why the male is interested in the first place (see Dr. T, What Women Want, etc.).  I think she was cast due to her popularity in other films or maybe Hanks requested her.  Anyway, the film is worth seeing (owning actually) for Hanks' performance and for that little volley ball that took on a larger emotional significance than any other character in the film.",4,&quot;Wilson?!!!&quot;,993427200,"06 25, 2001",2001,2203,"['Tom', 'Hanks', 'exceptional', 'emotional', 'performance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'back', 'up', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'would', 'be', 'silly', 'expect', 'be', 'first', 'act', 'are', 'introduced', 'Hanks', 'character', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'engineer', 'are', 'given', 'idea', 'planning', 'ask', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'marry', 'giving', 'obvious', 'gift', 'wait', 'trip', 'plane', 'exclaiming', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', 'quot', ""n't"", 'happen', 'plane', 'down', 'being', 'lone', 'survivor', 'up', 'island', 'nothing', 'clothes', 'load', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'wash', 'ashore', 'antique', 'watch', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'gave', 'just', 'left', 'second', 'act', 'where', 'only', 'life', 'see', 'while', 'Hanks', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'see', 'bird', 'anything', 'else', 'whale', 'most', 'compelling', 'memorable', 'part', 'film', 'relationship', 'quot', 'Wilson', 'quot', 'volleyball', 'more', 'believable', 'one', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'also', 'more', 'chemistry', 'two', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathy', 'when', 'quot', 'Wilson', 'quot', 'Hunt', 'married', 'children', 'ending', 'little', 'weird', 'what', 'did', 'everyone', 'expect', '4', 'years', 'Hunt', 'character', 'single', 'waiting', 'front', 'house', 'someone', 'attended', 'funeral', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'determination', 'stay', 'alive', 'little', 'island', 'not', 'relationship', 'Hunt', 'Which', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'just', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'having', 'endure', 'Hunt', 'other', 'movie', 'quot', 'Good', 'quot', 'talking', 'just', ""n't"", 'much', 'chemistry', 'two', 'not', 'uncommon', 'Hunt', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'male', 'character', 'be', 'confusion', 'why', 'male', 'interested', 'first', 'place', 'see', 'Dr.', 'T', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'etc.', 'think', 'was', 'cast', 'due', 'popularity', 'other', 'films', 'maybe', 'Hanks', 'requested', 'Anyway', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'owning', 'actually', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'little', 'volley', 'ball', 'took', 'larger', 'emotional', 'significance', 'other', 'character', 'film']",N/A

If you like Tom Hanks, whom I do, you will love this movie.  Only Russell Crowe's outstanding performance in Gladiator prevented Hanks from holding the golden statue again.  He plays the part of a FedEx consultant, Chuck Noland, who often travels across the world on business, yet one day meets peril on a flight across the Pacific.  He winds up on an island, and this is where the survival story ensues, not only for Chuck, but for the movie as well.  An actor on an island must be very creative, especially with little background music, no conversation, and only natural sound effects like the wind, rain, and waves.The real question is why Helen Hunt accepted the role of Chuck's girlfriend, Kelly, a limited one in this movie.  Excuse me, but is this &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; for her?  They must have paid a good nickel to secure her services, but she certainly made the most of her part; nevertheless, the best supporting actor goes to Wilson. This is Chuck's wild-haired, blood brother, and confidant, the person that kept him from losing all his mental faculties.  In fact, Tom had a ball with this little fellow and you will be impressed with his performance.The movie reveals to us the importance of the human relationship. Can a person live alone in life as on an island?  Do we need others to survive and to what extremes will mankind go to have connection with another human being?  The movie answers these questions, and even brings God into the picture.  Do we really have angels watching over us?  Thus, the movie deals with some very real and delicate human issues, issues that we cannot so easily &quot;cast away&quot;!",5,Cast-Away Your Doubts: It's a Great Movie,993081600,"06 21, 2001",2001,2226,"['Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', 'cute', 'show', 'CASTAWAY', 'real', 'thing', 'great', 'movie', 'change', 'seven', 'stranded', 'castaways', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'simply', 'threw', 'quot', 'cast', 'away', 'quot', 'rode', 'waves', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'jingle', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'something', 'plane', 'set', 'down', 'ocean', 'somewhere', 'uncharted', 'Pacific', 'Isle', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Wilson', 'too', 'millionaire', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'star', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Professor', 'Hanks', 'Hanks', 'again', 'Here', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Isle', 'So', 'much', 'parodic', 'attempt', 'be', 'funny', 'true', 'like', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'whom', 'do', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'Only', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Gladiator', 'prevented', 'Hanks', 'holding', 'golden', 'statue', 'again', 'part', 'FedEx', 'consultant', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'who', 'often', 'world', 'business', 'one', 'day', 'peril', 'flight', 'Pacific', 'up', 'island', 'where', 'survival', 'story', 'ensues', 'not', 'only', 'Chuck', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'actor', 'island', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'creative', 'especially', 'little', 'background', 'music', 'conversation', 'only', 'natural', 'sound', 'effects', 'wind', 'rain', 'waves.The', 'real', 'question', 'why', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'accepted', 'role', 'Chuck', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'limited', 'one', 'movie', 'quot', 'As', 'Good', 'Gets', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'paid', 'good', 'nickel', 'secure', 'services', 'certainly', 'made', 'most', 'part', 'nevertheless', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Wilson', 'Chuck', 'wild-haired', 'blood', 'brother', 'confidant', 'person', 'kept', 'losing', 'mental', 'faculties', 'fact', 'Tom', 'had', 'ball', 'little', 'fellow', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'performance.The', 'movie', 'reveals', 'importance', 'human', 'relationship', 'Can', 'person', 'live', 'alone', 'life', 'island', 'Do', 'need', 'others', 'survive', 'what', 'extremes', 'will', 'mankind', 'go', 'have', 'connection', 'human', 'being', 'movie', 'questions', 'even', 'God', 'picture', 'Do', 'really', 'have', 'angels', 'watching', 'Thus', 'movie', 'deals', 'very', 'real', 'delicate', 'human', 'issues', 'issues', 'can', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'quot', 'cast', 'away', 'quot']",N/A

(And remember, he didn't get out by just hanging on;  he found a way to get beyond the reef.)  He must now decide if he is going to survive the loss of the love of his life.If you have ever realized you let go of a great love, then you understood what was great about it.  You have the chance to take that realization, growth, and self-awareness to your next relationship, making it worlds better that the first.  But its not that easy.It takes courage to move on and trust that the future contains unknown miracles. Ironically, that courage may be the thing your next love finds most attractive about you.I absolutely adore the last scene.  He is literally at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere.  He must chose between a misery to which he is completely entitled, or once again, scraping together whatever courage he can find.I imagine that he turns his car around, and drives back toward the woman with the wings (another great metaphor).  We don't know if they start a relationship.  But it doesn't really matter because we know he will continue to find the courage to move on.Of course, I imagine that they do.  I imagine that she initially sees him as an odd, mildly attractive man of her own age.  They discuss the package he left at her door, which leads to an offer of iced tea and a  discussion of his experience on the island which takes all afternoon and into the evening.

534613,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,B00003CXRP,Bob Thompson,"[8, 12]","When I first heard about Castaway, a Tom Hanks/Robert Zemeckis collaboration, I expected something like Robinson Crusoe. Due to the Holywood nature of the project I also expected wild adventure scenes and the movie to be a generally pleasant affair. This however is a trap that I think a lot of other people fell into as well which may have left a lot of viewers feeling short changed.The simple fact is, Castaway is a very depressing movie. Although many people wanted adventure on a tropical island, it would be foolish to write this off as anything other than a great film. The movie is divided up into three seperate parts. The first sees Hanks, a frantic fedex courier,  travelling all around the world in an attempt to keep the mail system up to speed. Part two, he crashes in the pacific ocean. This, incidentally is the most terrifying plane crash scene which you will ever see and is likely to go through your mind the next time you go on vacation.  Anyway, Hanks the sole survivor is marooned on a tropical island and over four years lives a lonely existence. His only connection to civilization is a volleyball.  Lastly, Hanks returns home only to find his wife remarried.It is hard to nail down exactly what is good about Castaway because the movie cannot really be broken up into little scenes and scrutinized. The movie works incredibly well as a mood piece and establishes a huge sense of desolation and loneliness. Hanks puts in a subtle performance that for the most part relies on body language rather than expansive monologues. The film is also very real which definitley helps add to the pervading sense of loss. There are no Holywood touches to Hanks' survival, he lights his own fires (after three days of trying), bleeds when he steps on a reef and doesn't have batteries that last in his flashlight for four years. Unlike other stranded in nature films like &quot;The Edge,&quot; where Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are seen sporting bear coats right after killing a bear with a stick, Castaway is about as real to life as you can imagine.There are of course some flaws. The whole third act is a dissapointment. Throughout the entire film Hanks does a great job so it is a shame to see him reverting to his usual &quot;I have to get home to my wife&quot; type of character taht he has done about three million times before. Helen Hunt is pretty poor as well, her only purpose seems to be to taunt Hanks by chasing him down in the rain to only kiss him once and then go back to her new husband. These are minor quibbles to another wise great movie. Castway is real and the sense of desperation and loneliness it creates is uncommon in movies of this scope.Take it for what it is and don't be expecting Hanks to be setting tiger traps for pirates.",5,A Rare Big Budget Charmer,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,2772,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Castaway', 'Tom', 'Hanks/Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'collaboration', 'expected', 'something', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Due', 'Holywood', 'nature', 'project', 'also', 'expected', 'wild', 'adventure', 'scenes', 'movie', 'be', 'generally', 'pleasant', 'affair', 'however', 'trap', 'think', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'fell', 'as', 'well', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'lot', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'short', 'changed.The', 'simple', 'fact', 'Castaway', 'very', 'depressing', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'wanted', 'adventure', 'tropical', 'island', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'write', 'off', 'anything', 'other', 'great', 'film', 'movie', 'divided', 'up', 'three', 'seperate', 'parts', 'first', 'Hanks', 'frantic', 'fedex', 'courier', 'travelling', 'world', 'attempt', 'keep', 'mail', 'system', 'speed', 'Part', 'two', 'pacific', 'ocean', 'incidentally', 'most', 'terrifying', 'plane', 'crash', 'scene', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'likely', 'go', 'mind', 'next', 'time', 'go', 'vacation', 'Anyway', 'Hanks', 'sole', 'survivor', 'marooned', 'tropical', 'island', 'four', 'years', 'lonely', 'existence', 'only', 'connection', 'civilization', 'volleyball', 'Lastly', 'Hanks', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'wife', 'remarried.It', 'hard', 'nail', 'down', 'exactly', 'what', 'good', 'Castaway', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'broken', 'up', 'little', 'scenes', 'scrutinized', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'well', 'mood', 'piece', 'huge', 'sense', 'desolation', 'loneliness', 'Hanks', 'subtle', 'performance', 'most', 'part', 'relies', 'body', 'language', 'rather', 'expansive', 'monologues', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'real', 'definitley', 'add', 'pervading', 'sense', 'loss', 'are', 'Holywood', 'touches', 'Hanks', 'survival', 'own', 'fires', 'three', 'days', 'trying', 'bleeds', 'when', 'reef', ""n't"", 'have', 'batteries', 'last', 'flashlight', 'four', 'years', 'other', 'stranded', 'nature', 'films', 'quot', 'Edge', 'quot', 'where', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'are', 'seen', 'sporting', 'bear', 'coats', 'right', 'killing', 'bear', 'stick', 'Castaway', 'about', 'as', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'imagine.There', 'are', 'course', 'flaws', 'whole', 'third', 'act', 'dissapointment', 'entire', 'film', 'Hanks', 'great', 'job', 'shame', 'see', 'reverting', 'usual', 'quot', 'have', 'get', 'home', 'wife', 'quot', 'type', 'character', 'taht', 'done', 'three', 'million', 'times', 'before', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'pretty', 'poor', 'well', 'only', 'purpose', 'be', 'taunt', 'Hanks', 'chasing', 'down', 'rain', 'only', 'kiss', 'once', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'new', 'husband', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'wise', 'great', 'movie', 'Castway', 'real', 'sense', 'desperation', 'loneliness', 'uncommon', 'movies', 'scope.Take', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'expecting', 'Hanks', 'be', 'setting', 'tiger', 'traps', 'pirates']",N/A

The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences. Tom Hanks gives the Powerhouse Performance we All Expected him to and Robert Zemeckis uses All of his Skills to pull off this Monumental Achievement. Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.Unless you yourself have been Cast Away on an Island for 3 years, you'll know the films story, so I'll keep my Plot Synopsis short. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee whose plane goes down in a storm and he is washed up on the shore of a remote Island... Which becomes his home for 4 Long Years. ""Cast Away"" chronicles his Survival, his battles with Starvation, Loneliness and Madness, and finally his Eventual Rescue.There was never a Doubt in the Cinema-going Publics minds that Hanks could pull this role off, his On-Screen Transformation is Truly Something to Behold. The whole film Rests on his sole performance, which made him the Obvious (and Only) choice, I doubt the film would have been given the Green Light had he not been involved. He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143-minute running time feel like an even hour. The Supporting cast have Precious-little time to make an Impression, and not One of them Waste that time. Helen Hunt goes through quite a Transformation too as Chuck's Fianc&eacute;, but hers is shown mainly through Facial expression and Body Language. Like Hanks, she Convincingly Conveys to us what She's been through as well, which is a Hell of a lot. Nick Searcy is a Standout as Stan, a Friend of Chucks. His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real. They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.The Screenplay is a Brilliant one, getting Maximum Emotion Impact out of a Situation that Is a tough one to film, but with Zemeckis behind the camera, the filming is in Wonderful Hands.

After getting home you see where his lesson lies ( although for some it may take too long to get there) that life is unpredictable, time waits for no man, and finally what really matters keeping your priorities straight.He realizes to take the work trip instead of staying home started the hole series of events. He realizes that if he had stayed home and never took the business trip he would be probably married to the girl of his dreams. Life is like that, you cant plan it. After seeing his ex fiance married with kids he realizes he just has to go on surviving, as a well written monologue at the end points out.I like that at the end, he is able to deliver one of the Fed Ex boxes he found after the crash. It belongs to a lady that started out the movie sending art to her husband overseas, whose cheating on her. By the end of the film you see the husband is out of the picture, she divorced him. She see's Tom at a crossroads and, after giving directions Tom realizes shes the lady who owns the ranch/art atudio and the last shot is of him looking at all the roads to take, metaphorically choosing his path, and he ends up looking down the road the lady just left on. Hinting that theres a reason for everything.Thats where the message lies. Accept your decisions, becuase as you look back if even one thing is differe nt you wouldnt be where you are. Tom's character has to go through a lot but the ending really does hint at the fact that with the artist lady, is where he was always meant to be.

Hollywood got their fingers into the mix, most likely, and nearly ruined the movie.However, the movie works brilliantly as a documentary.  It really should have been called &quot;How We Learn&quot; (but of course, then, noone would have seen it) because it shows the true iterative process that people go through to learn a new task.  Tom Hanks, and maybe even more the director, was great at showing how inept the castaway was when Hanks first landed on the island at even doing the &quot;simplest&quot; tasks.  The scene where he tries to get a fire started was great, because it took long enough, even in &quot;movie time&quot; for us to know that this is no trivial matter without matches.  (I nearly felt blisters on my fingers by the time that he got his first fire!)  How many times have we seen actors in a movie learn a new task and perform it perfectly the first time (just watch any dance flick)?  It just doesn't happen that way.  Thankfully, Castaway doesn't insult our intelligence and shows us how painful learning really can be.Does the director's cut remove the ending?

If this movie had eliminated some of the commercialism and either stranded both of them or just Hanks without a previous relationship with Hunt it would have been better I think. As it is FedEx was overly thrown in our face and it leaves a bad taste in our mouth when Hunt and Hanks don't get back together at the end of the movie. So along with being stranded on an island for years, poor Hanks has no assurances about his life or a relationship in the end. If you like depressing endings this may appeal to you. There is only a faint hint of a possible chance at a relationship with the sculptor that drew the wings on a package he found on the island. I regret I don't feel like viewing it again like I do towards other castaway movies. This would have been a great movie for Hanks if they had just shown a little part of him working for FedEx, then stranded him on the island after the plane crash. Then use some interesting things on the island perhaps even a native like in Robinson Crusoe, and definitely skip the bit with the volleyball.

534623,AZGXZ2UUK6X,B00003CXRP,"Catherine Hallberg ""(Kate)""","[0, 0]","Oddly enough, I had to get over the hump of thinking ""a guy is on an island by himself with a vollyball.  How interesting can that be?"" before I could watch ""Cast Away"".  Yes, I knew it was a silly thought - after all, it was Tom Hanks playing that guy, and being alone on an island for years is rarely a holiday.At the beginning, Chuck (Tom Hanks) is a very motivated FedEx systems manager who is very invested in making sure the international offices are up to speed on the philosophy of the company.  He travels often, in a cargo plane,  but is very dedicated to his PhD candidate girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) back in Memphis, the FedEx hub.  Around Christmas he returns from Russia and joins Kelly's family for a close, friendly Christmas dinner, but then gets called to a location past the South Pacific.  Immediately before boarding that flight he gives Kelly a box which we assume has an engagement ring and he tells her, ""I'll be right back"".Then they hit a storm, head off course and the plane has an explosion.  To my claustrophobic eye, the plane crash is horrific and Chuck almost doesn't make it away from the sinking plane on his lifeboat.  *shudder*  Luckily, he and his lifeboat, nothing else, wash ashore on a tiny island just shortly after, sparing us scenes of desperate survival on the open sea before he hits land.Chuck manages to figure out how to get water, crack coconuts, make fire, spearfish and devise a buddy, Wilson.  He has next to nothing- just the raft, his clothes, the contents of the very few FedEx boxes that float ashore, and an heirloom pocketwatch given him by Kelly for Christmas, with her picture inside.  Four years- (FOUR years!) later, he is lean, with toughened feet and a longstanding relationship with Wilson, a hunk of a porta-potty wall washes ashore and he has what he needs to make his escape.  He and Wilson build a raft and set off to wherever the wind takes them.Other reviewers have included a spoiler on his relationship with Kelly- skip this if you don't know about that yet-  Of course Craig has high hopes for seeing Kelly since she is how he kept himself alive during his isolation.  But four years is a long time when others are trying to convince you someone is dead, and she eventually caved in and married their dentist.  It's quickly apparent that she still loves him, but he believes she needs to let go of him then- he says he is ""happy she was with him on the island"" and acknowledges her picture and memory were important to his survival.  He contemplates that he doesn't know what the tide might drag in- a reference to his porta-potty sail- and he feels it's important to move on with his life.  I'm not sure I agree, but at the same time, I can understand why someone would be unwilling to cause of breaking up Kelly's family.The commentary on the second disk is interesting- the directors and screenwriters hired experts in stone age living and one of them spent some time living alone on the Baja where he made shelter, learned to catch food, learned to make fire, etc, in order to authentically write the the script for Chuck's survival.  The idea for ""Wilson"" came from that experience and it was their belief that a figure like that would be crucial to keeping a person sane during a solitary trial.  I haven't decided if that would be true for me though.It's fascinating to contemplate how we would do in a situation like that.  How many of us believe we would have the motivation to keep breathing, to work every day to live off the tiny environment supplied by fate?  How many of us believe we would just lay down and give up?  This film can provide lots of good food for thought on sleepless nights, but preferably not on the over the water portion of international flights.",5,few flaws to my eyes,1115164800,"05 4, 2005",2005,3756,"['Oddly', 'enough', 'had', 'get', 'hump', 'thinking', 'guy', 'island', 'vollyball', 'How', 'interesting', 'can', 'be', 'could', 'watch', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Yes', 'knew', 'was', 'silly', 'thought', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'guy', 'being', 'alone', 'island', 'years', 'rarely', 'holiday.At', 'beginning', 'Chuck', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'very', 'motivated', 'FedEx', 'systems', 'manager', 'who', 'very', 'invested', 'making', 'sure', 'international', 'offices', 'are', 'up', 'speed', 'philosophy', 'company', 'often', 'cargo', 'plane', 'very', 'dedicated', 'PhD', 'candidate', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'back', 'Memphis', 'FedEx', 'hub', 'Christmas', 'Russia', 'Kelly', 'family', 'close', 'friendly', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'then', 'called', 'location', 'South', 'Pacific', 'Immediately', 'boarding', 'flight', 'Kelly', 'box', 'assume', 'engagement', 'ring', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', '.Then', 'hit', 'storm', 'head', 'course', 'plane', 'explosion', 'claustrophobic', 'eye', 'plane', 'crash', 'horrific', 'Chuck', 'almost', ""n't"", 'make', 'away', 'sinking', 'plane', 'lifeboat', '*shudder*', 'Luckily', 'lifeboat', 'nothing', 'else', 'ashore', 'tiny', 'island', 'just', 'shortly', 'sparing', 'scenes', 'desperate', 'survival', 'open', 'sea', 'land.Chuck', 'manages', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'water', 'crack', 'coconuts', 'make', 'fire', 'spearfish', 'devise', 'buddy', 'Wilson', 'next', 'nothing-', 'just', 'raft', 'clothes', 'contents', 'very', 'few', 'FedEx', 'boxes', 'float', 'ashore', 'heirloom', 'pocketwatch', 'given', 'Kelly', 'Christmas', 'picture', 'Four', 'years-', 'FOUR', 'years', 'later', 'lean', 'toughened', 'feet', 'longstanding', 'relationship', 'Wilson', 'hunk', 'porta-potty', 'wall', 'washes', 'ashore', 'what', 'make', 'escape', 'Wilson', 'build', 'raft', 'set', 'off', 'wherever', 'wind', 'them.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'included', 'spoiler', 'relationship', 'Kelly-', 'skip', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet-', 'course', 'Craig', 'high', 'hopes', 'seeing', 'Kelly', 'how', 'kept', 'alive', 'isolation', 'four', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'trying', 'convince', 'someone', 'dead', 'eventually', 'caved', 'married', 'dentist', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'still', 'let', 'go', 'then-', 'happy', 'was', 'island', 'picture', 'memory', 'were', 'important', 'survival', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tide', 'might', 'drag', 'in-', 'reference', 'porta-potty', 'sail-', 'important', 'move', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'same', 'time', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'be', 'unwilling', 'cause', 'breaking', 'up', 'Kelly', 'family.The', 'commentary', 'second', 'disk', 'interesting-', 'directors', 'screenwriters', 'hired', 'experts', 'stone', 'age', 'living', 'one', 'spent', 'time', 'living', 'alone', 'Baja', 'where', 'made', 'shelter', 'learned', 'catch', 'food', 'learned', 'make', 'fire', 'etc', 'order', 'authentically', 'write', 'script', 'Chuck', 'survival', 'idea', 'Wilson', 'came', 'experience', 'was', 'belief', 'figure', 'would', 'be', 'crucial', 'keeping', 'person', 'sane', 'solitary', 'trial', 'have', ""n't"", 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'though.It', 'fascinating', 'contemplate', 'how', 'would', 'do', 'situation', 'How', 'many', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'motivation', 'keep', 'breathing', 'work', 'day', 'live', 'off', 'tiny', 'environment', 'supplied', 'fate', 'How', 'many', 'believe', 'would', 'just', 'lay', 'down', 'give', 'up', 'film', 'can', 'provide', 'lots', 'good', 'food', 'thought', 'sleepless', 'nights', 'preferably', 'not', 'water', 'portion', 'international', 'flights']",N/A

It is too bad the director did not put that much effort into making a better movie.This is one of those films that you like when the end credits roll, then wake up in the middle of the night and wonder why you suddenly dislike it.There are over 400 other reviews on this site for this film, so I will spare you another detailed summary of the plot. When it comes right down to it, the plot is very minimal at best. On to the complaining:Why does Zemeckis insist on using special effects for the most mundane scenes? I thought the Oscar winning effects for ""Forrest Gump"" were lousy. The scene I am talking about is an obvious CGI fish swimming in the water before getting speared by Hanks, who is dramatically thin after four years. Why the effect? A fake fish on string would have been more realistic.What I disliked most about this film was the missed opportunities. Where was the scene where Hanks gets on the boat and explains his appearance? His reaction to loud noises after being on a tropical island alone? His reaction to getting back on a plane after going down in a plane at the beginning of the film? His inability to drive a car after four years of not being able to? I also would have liked to see Hanks gradually get used to island life. Instead, he stumbles around like Gilligan, then we jump forward four years later where he looks like a caveman, and is an old pro at island life. Couldn't we see how he adjusts? We know he is going to be rescued, so we are left with muddled scenes regarding his reunification with love of his life Helen Hunt, who is better in this than ""What Women Want.""Where is the emotional reuniting of the pair, instead of the strained meeting when he goes to their house? She still has all of his stuff from the unsuccessful search, and his car, and yet he must go to her.I really did not like the ambiguous ending. Normally, ambiguous endings are the result of the film makers deciding to do something different than the Hollywood norm. Here, it just seems that no one knew how to end this. Having Hanks look back up the road where Lori White had driven is nice, but what was in the package he left at her door? Sure, he is at a crossroads emotionally as well as physically, but the film makers try to be mysterious by leaving him there. Do not take me through two and a half hours with this guy, then leave the both of us hanging on a dirt road in Texas.

534628,A29IYGR7SNPRIV,B00003CXRP,"Charlotte Vale-Allen ""writerinresidence""","[0, 0]","This was a film I wanted to see only because of Tom Hanks, not because a remake of Robinson Crusoe had any particular appeal. What a surprise! This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. It makes The Perfect Storm look precisely like the little boat in a box of water that it was (not to mention paper-thin characters and way too much nonsensical machismo.) The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality. (The only other &quot;wreck&quot; sequence I've seen that was comparable was the train wreck in The Fugitive.)I cannot conceive of any other actor pulling off what Hanks does in this film. He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays. And in this case, one cannot help but watch in awe as he invests his formidable skills in this Fedex employee who miraculously survives not only a horrifying plane crash but also a life of total isolation on an unpopulated little island.What's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity.

His acting ability amazes me.This film harkens back to one of Tom's older films Joe Versus the Volcano, as the main character ends up on a deserted island. In this film, it's because of a plane crash in the pacific. The similarities between Cast Away and JVTV were numerous, with lots of bits of symbolism all through the film.Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex employee who is obsessed with time. Everything has to be done on time (the Fed-Ex motto). When things go wrong in the biz, they call him in. When he gets called away right before Christmas, he figures it's just a short trip. A few hours later, he's in the drink.Trying to survive on the island only one concern. The other is keeping his sanity, which is apparently in short supply. Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film, which hardly got a second glance by critics.While there are a few special effects in the film (the plane crash), the film is mostly centered on Hanks character and follows him while he tries to make some resemblence of a life on the island. Where's Gilligan, the Skipper and the professor when you need them?Any Hanks fan should own this one. This is the one he got robbed of the Oscar on. You can repeat this mantra everytime you watch it. It's a slow constant flow-of-a-film, and is very dramatic and wonderful.

With director Robert Zemeckis teaming up with actor Tom Hanks for the first time since Forrest Gump, movie fans had high expectations for this movie, and were not dissapointed.The movie opens by intorducing us to our main character, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx manager who lives his life according to time. We are also introduced to Kelly (Helen Hunt), Chuck's girlfriend. It is when Noland must take an unexpected delivery overseas that the action starts. Due to mechanical error, Noland's plane goes down, leaving him stranded on an island somewhere in the pacific. He must now find a way to survive alone, with no hope of being rescued.Noland must use what he has to survive, including the packages that were on the plane. A pair of ice skates suffice as knives,  video tapes are used as rope, and a Vollyball, who Noland compassionately names Wilson, becomes his sole companion. Noland survives well, but after four years of solitude, Noland concludes that he would rather die trying to escape the island, than die alone.The basic plot was given to us in the previews; plane crashes, man survives, man finds tropical island, man tries to escape island. But until you see it, you never really know the whole story. You never see Chuck Noland's struggle to obtain water. You dont see his efforts to create fire or find food. And most importantly, you dont see the underlying moral; that sometimes being alone is worse than being dead.The screenplay is excellent, and Hanks had no trouble keeping the audience captivated for the two and a half hour long movie.

534641,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00003CXRP,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 1]","One can make a case that Cast Away was Robert Zemeckis' last great film. After the underrated Contact, he focused attention on making a story in which for a good chunk of the movie, there's no dialogue or score. Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well. It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee obsessed with time and making sure packages are delivered in a speedy manner. With a girlfriend, Kelly, he's planning on marrying, life seems alright until a late Christmas delivery has to be made and while en route, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Entirely alone on an empty island, the once time-obsessed Chuck now has too much of it and has to learn how to survive.Cast Away on my first viewing when it first came out was one of those movies that I liked but didn't necessarily love outright. But now and then, there's that desire to re-watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up. The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions. And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly. Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.If there's some scenes that bring the film down slightly are the non-island scenes where he's about to leave and when he returns home. It's necessary to show his life and daily activities before he gets stranded but you still feel slight cutting down was in order. The post-island scenes are also polarizing since they do feel different and almost alien-feeling to the island but with the film at a relatively healthy 2 h 15 minutes sans credit, it feels like it does take awhile before we get to the ending though I like how it leaves on a slightly ambiguous note.With a terrifying plane crash sequence, a compelling middle section though slightly inferior bookends, the film is good though because the film is better that doesn't make it amazing but considering what it could've been, I'm glad it's this way.",4,4.5; works when it shouldn't,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,2458,"['One', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'Cast', 'Away', 'was', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'last', 'great', 'film', 'underrated', 'Contact', 'focused', 'attention', 'making', 'story', 'good', 'chunk', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'score', 'Whereas', 'more', 'concerned', 'testing', 'new', 'expensive', 'toys', 'CG', 'technology', 'combining', 'story', 'always', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'not', 'exactly', 'one', 'best', 'career', 'was', ""n't"", 'main', 'performance', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'being', 'said', 'good', 'what', 'managed', 'pull', 'off.Chuck', 'Noland', 'FedEx', 'employee', 'obsessed', 'time', 'making', 'sure', 'packages', 'are', 'delivered', 'speedy', 'manner', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'planning', 'marrying', 'life', 'alright', 'late', 'Christmas', 'delivery', 'be', 'made', 'en', 'route', 'plane', 'crashes', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'Entirely', 'alone', 'empty', 'island', 'once', 'time-obsessed', 'Chuck', 'now', 'too', 'much', 'learn', 'how', 'survive.Cast', 'Away', 'first', 'viewing', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'love', 'outright', 'now', 'then', 'desire', 're-watch', 'movie', 'again', 'refresh', 'memory', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'up', 'film', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'got', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'holding', 'attention', 'whole', 'film', 'cinema', 'conventions', 'credit', 'go', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'hold', 'attention', 'own', 'even', 'make', 'scenes', 'where', 'talk', 'volleyball', 'not', 'feel', 'silly', 'dramatic', 'weight', 'loss', 'did', 'further', 'add', 'realism', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'was', 'well', 'scenes', 'bring', 'film', 'down', 'slightly', 'are', 'non-island', 'scenes', 'where', 'leave', 'when', 'home', 'necessary', 'show', 'life', 'daily', 'activities', 'stranded', 'still', 'feel', 'slight', 'cutting', 'down', 'was', 'order', 'post-island', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'polarizing', 'do', 'feel', 'different', 'almost', 'alien-feeling', 'island', 'film', 'relatively', 'healthy', '2', 'h', '15', 'minutes', 'sans', 'credit', 'take', 'awhile', 'get', 'ending', 'like', 'how', 'slightly', 'ambiguous', 'terrifying', 'plane', 'crash', 'sequence', 'compelling', 'middle', 'section', 'slightly', 'inferior', 'bookends', 'film', 'good', 'film', 'better', ""n't"", 'make', 'amazing', 'considering', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', ""'m"", 'glad', 'way']",N/A

We all know the answer is yes.  In fact, with a little more help from the rest of the cast, this movie could have been phenomenal.  Anyways, a quick breakdown of the plot is that Tom Hanks, a FedEx manager whose life is based around a busy schedule that takes him all over the world, is marooned on a deserted island for several years after his plane crashed (a very frightening crash at that) somewhere in the pacific ocean.  Hanks's time on the island is where he truly shines.  Not many actors can make you believe that man could actually cry at losing his volleyball.  I will not go into detail about his time there as it is so entertaining in every way, however after he escapes from the island (yes, we all knew he would) he comes home to find his old girlfriend remarried.

534650,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXRP,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.  You don't just watch this movie; you really have to devote an entire night to it; it's just that powerful and moving.  At almost two and a half hours in length, it is uncommonly long in and of itself (but it does not feel long to the enthralled viewer); figure in all of the incredible special features included in the 2-disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.  Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it; most importantly, it manages, after several cathartic moments, to leave one with a sense of hope and a strange kind of joy.  Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.  There really isn't a lot of dialogue during the time on the island; long drawn-out moments focus on Hanks' expression, body language, and emotion.  When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.Don't think that this is just another Robinson Crusoe remake.  Chuck Noland (Hanks) is an obsessive, deeply committed system engineer for FedEx.  Everything for him must be planned and executed according to the limits of time, and so he is truly a duck out of water when his plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and leaves him stranded all alone on a deserted island.  Time is meaningless for him here, but he has a picture of the woman he loves with him to help him go on living when it would be so easy to just give up.  He learns to survive on his own in the tropical environment, but not without much pain and battles with hopelessness.  When the situation threatens to overwhelm him, the character of Wilson comes along.  Wilson is a volleyball, but he has a face framed with Chuck's own blood and becomes the personification of the world of people he longs to return to.  After four years on the island, Wilson is a true companion whom Chuck talks to, argues with, but dearly loves as a very real friend.  The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.  It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.  You might expect this type of film to end with a long-overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.  Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet; having seemingly lost everyone and everything he cared for four years earlier, his miraculous return becomes another tale of great loss.  This movie is a real tear-jerker; just when you think it's time to rejoice, you are met with more poignant heartbreak.  Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart-warming message.I love Wilson; he is such a great character that, volleyball or not, I think he should have been nominated for a best supporting actor award.  Amazingly, he really slipped into the movie by accident, yet much of this movie's power is conveyed through him.  The inclusion of a featurette on the life and death of Wilson on the second DVD is a testament to his importance to this story.  This second DVD is filled with an incredible selection of bonus features: features on the making of the film, its special effects, and a look at the beautiful and bonafide island paradise location of the filming; there is an interview of Tom Hanks by Charlie Rose, a survivalist documentary, and a movie-length commentary as well.  You can't ask more from a movie than Cast Away gives you, and you can't ask for more from a DVD than this two-disc special edition delivers.",5,"A palpable, incredibly emotional experience",1050364800,"04 15, 2003",2003,3936,"['Cast', 'Away', 'just', 'amazing', 'cinematic', 'achievement', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'really', 'have', 'devote', 'entire', 'night', 'just', 'powerful', 'moving', 'almost', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'length', 'uncommonly', 'long', 'not', 'feel', 'long', 'enthralled', 'viewer', 'figure', 'incredible', 'special', 'features', 'included', '2-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'are', 'looking', 'whole', 'night', 'worth', 'rich', 'entertainment', 'Cast', 'Away', 'just', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'movie', 'romance', 'adventure', 'action', 'heartbreak', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'nature', 'most', 'ugly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'name', 'most', 'importantly', 'several', 'cathartic', 'moments', 'leave', 'one', 'sense', 'hope', 'strange', 'kind', 'joy', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'credit', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'as', 'perfectly', 'really', ""n't"", 'lot', 'dialogue', 'time', 'island', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'moments', 'focus', 'Hanks', 'expression', 'body', 'language', 'emotion', 'When', 'friend', 'talk', 'Wilson', 'character', 'really', 'come', 'alive', 'become', 'very', 'real', 'character', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'just', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'remake', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Hanks', 'obsessive', 'deeply', 'committed', 'system', 'engineer', 'FedEx', 'Everything', 'must', 'be', 'planned', 'executed', 'according', 'limits', 'time', 'so', 'truly', 'duck', 'water', 'when', 'plane', 'down', 'middle', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'stranded', 'alone', 'deserted', 'island', 'Time', 'meaningless', 'here', 'picture', 'woman', 'help', 'go', 'living', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'just', 'give', 'up', 'survive', 'own', 'tropical', 'environment', 'not', 'much', 'pain', 'battles', 'hopelessness', 'When', 'situation', 'overwhelm', 'character', 'Wilson', 'along', 'Wilson', 'volleyball', 'face', 'framed', 'Chuck', 'own', 'blood', 'personification', 'world', 'people', 'return', 'four', 'years', 'island', 'Wilson', 'true', 'companion', 'whom', 'Chuck', 'talks', 'argues', 'dearly', 'very', 'real', 'friend', 'escape', 'attempt', 'island', 'very', 'powerful', 'containing', 'more', 'important', 'truths', 'examples', 'human', 'spirit', 'can', 'name', 'also', 'where', 'first', 'tears', 'begin', 'well', 'up', 'eyes', 'might', 'expect', 'type', 'film', 'end', 'long-overdue', 'rescue', 'return', 'happy', 'life', 'Cast', 'Away', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'just', 'getting', 'started', 'point', 'Chuck', 'return', 'home', 'friends', 'woman', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'bittersweet', 'having', 'seemingly', 'lost', 'everyone', 'everything', 'cared', 'four', 'years', 'earlier', 'miraculous', 'return', 'tale', 'great', 'loss', 'movie', 'real', 'tear-jerker', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'time', 'rejoice', 'are', 'met', 'more', 'poignant', 'heartbreak', 'Hope', 'never', 'dies', 'writers', 'do', 'tremendous', 'job', 'subtly', 'presenting', 'heart-warming', 'message.I', 'Wilson', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'not', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'nominated', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'award', 'Amazingly', 'really', 'slipped', 'movie', 'accident', 'yet', 'much', 'movie', 'power', 'conveyed', 'inclusion', 'featurette', 'life', 'death', 'Wilson', 'second', 'DVD', 'testament', 'importance', 'story', 'second', 'DVD', 'filled', 'incredible', 'selection', 'bonus', 'features', 'features', 'making', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'beautiful', 'bonafide', 'island', 'paradise', 'location', 'filming', 'interview', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'survivalist', 'documentary', 'movie-length', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'movie', 'Cast', 'Away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'more', 'DVD', 'two-disc', 'special', 'edition', 'delivers']",N/A

Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.  The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count ""Wilson"" the volleyball, are just masterful.

In Cable Guy everyone expected another Ace Ventura and instead got a wonderful black comedy. Unfortunately in most people's minds Carrey wasn't supposed to do black comedy and this truly remarkable performance was ignored and the movie floundered.In Cast Away Tom Hanks leaves his gosh-golly everyman and becomes an time obsessed FedEx manager named Chuck Noland. Through circumstances he becomes stranded on an island in the South Pacific. For almost an hour we share the island with Chuck and a ball named Wilson. While it might sound odd it is really very captivating and entertaining.In a stock movie the Hanks character would have been found and lived happily ever after, however in Cast Away the ending is intelligent and much more interesting.The DVD extras are on a separate disk and are complete from trailers through interviews to featurettes. The interview with Charlie Rose is curious but gives you an idea of the time and effort it takes for even Tom Hanks to develop a project and get it filmed. It is curious because throughout the interview Rose appears unprepared, careless, and inept which makes it almost painful yet peculiarly intriguing to watch.People will say of Cast Away that it wasn't Hanks at his best or that the story was flawed. Personally, I think that Hanks was brilliant and the storyline was original and refreshing.

534667,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CXRP,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 7]","The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss (1781-1830); indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats.  It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic ""man versus nature"" theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization.Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan, a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean.  He washes up on a tiny, desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash.  (Incidentally, both ""des-ert island"" and ""de-serted island"" are correct, the words ""des-ert' and ""de-serted"" in this context meaning the same thing.)  His four-year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie-goers is what happens afterwards.Tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling.  Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone.  This has been done before (but I forget where), and is the kind of heart-wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought-provoking, veracious and very affecting.Zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan.  We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense.  Zemeckis, like Spielberg, can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience's identification.  We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy.  But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was.  And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship, like a sea-going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).  The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate ""we're all one world"" feeling like something from a Coca-Cola commercial was pure Spielberg.But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity.  Did the cast away lose weight?  Yes, as a matter of fact, Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds, or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film (or was that body cosmetology?) and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later.  But did he lose enough weight?  For those who have been watching TV's ""Survivor,"" we know he didn't.  And was he tan enough?  His hair was little lighter after his ordeal, but he really needed to be baked a dark brown, which he wasn't.I also look at how he ate.  What was his source of vitamin C?  Do coconuts contain Vitamin C?  I don't know.  But showing him eating seaweed, which does contain vitamin C, would have worked.  Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch.  Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible, but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely.  Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island.  An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land.  Notice there was no clear, encircling shot of the island (as from the air).  In fact we never see the other side of the island.It was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again ""Survivor"" fans--and boy scouts--know how hard that is to do), but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire.I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done.  Of course what I would have done doesn't mean that much, but I would not have left the island for the open ocean (which seemed almost suicidal), unless there was out there on that ocean a ship's corridor, so to speak, which is possible.  Of course, who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island?  I also would not have tried to cure my toothache, regardless of how bad it hurt, by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates.  After all, that might make things worse.  Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy--but how?I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package, and then Chuck's use of the blades as mirror and  knife.  I know why he didn't take the dead man's clothes, but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway.  The washed up metal ""sail"" was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the ""discovery"" of tool-making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle; burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft; the petroglyphs he made in the cave; sleeping on the floor in the hotel room, etc.Best no comment scene: Chuck looking at the Alaskan king crab legs at the buffet.",4,Engrossing

534671,A191FN0R6069WX,B00003CXRP,Dino,"[3, 3]","With no little thanks to a cinematic trailer that revealed far too much of the movie it was selling, the plot of Cast Away could be seen from the distance between the mainland and the remote island that Tom Hanks finds himself marooned on. With a lesser actor in the lead role, this film could have been a straight-to-video release, but Hanks gives a compelling performance. The viewer is drawn into his world and feels the enormous despair his character inevitably endures during his four year stay, alone, on a small desert island with only a volleyball for company. The island scenes, which form the majority of the film's running time, are undoubtedly the highlight of the project. When Hanks is rescued (a sequence which seems rather rushed), his return to suburbia and the fiancee he left behind are filmed to the same standard as your average tv movie. Not bad, just not very interesting. The film ends inconclusively and on an anti-climatic note with Hanks left standing, quite literally, at a crossroads in his life. There is no sense of closure and it almost feels like a different film compared to what has gone on before.

534672,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXRP,D. Litton,"[1, 1]","The most simplistic elements of life are taken for granted everyday of our lives. We turn on the lights without a second thought; we light matches without a moment's hesitation. Water coming out of the faucet is a given, something we know we can always depend on to be there. &quot;Cast Away&quot; takes all of those securities and hides them away, leaving us with an incredible and harrowing story of survival and determination.Taking its time in getting to what the movie is all about, the story first begins with the frenzied life of Fed-Ex systems engineer Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whose number-one rule of life is making sure that everything goes according to schedule. This leaves him little time for his understanding girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), whom he returns to see in Memphis for Christmas. Circumstances intervene, and he finds himself rearranging his schedule in order to make a trip across the Pacific for business. But not before exchanging gifts, one of which is an engagement ring, the other an &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;After a near-10-minute plane crash sequence that raises the intensity, the true Zemeckis style kicks into gear, as Chuck is left in a rubber life raft in stormy seas, the only light source coming from sudden flashes of lightning. At daylight, he finds himself on an island, not another soul in sight and only the sound of crashing waves and wind in the trees for company. Instincts drive him to signal for help at first, and as the days move on, he silently realizes his situation.The story becomes more intriguing with the transition of time during his stay on the island: he learns the secrets of creating life's little commodities. Resorting to stick-rubbing for the creation of fire and collection condensation from leaves for nourishment, the only visible objects that tie his present life to reality are a Fed-Ex box, his battered life-raft, and a volleyball with a blood-painted face whom he calls Wilson. But as Chuck becomes more attached to life on the island, he cannot shake his desire to once again return home to his love, whose picture he repeatedly paints on the wall.Let's be honest: this is probably the best deserted island movie to date, possibly ever made. &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; was less engrossing because there was a family on the island, not a single person. Being alone on the island allows the story to explore the inner human strength and spirit, as well as new methods of companionship.Other techniques bring the movie to a full-force magnitude that keeps us engrossed with what goes on. During the entire island sequence, from the time he arrives to the time he is plucked from the sea, there is a complete absence of music. This leaving out of the musical score gives an added focus to his situation as well as reflecting on his solitude and loneliness. The nature surrounding Chuck is beautifully captured and photographed, and under Zemeckis's helm, the setting is ominous and brooding without becoming too overpowering.Hanks gives, without a doubt, the best performance to date of his career, topping his work in &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; His acting, along with the aforementioned techniques, puts us right there with him as he begins to learns the small things in life can be quite complicated. Even his silence is our key to understanding his realizations about the potential danger he faces, and his comprehension of what seems to him an inescapable situation. At the movie's end, I felt compelled to inquire why Russell Crowe received the Best Actor Oscar for his work in &quot;Gladiator,&quot; when the performance by Hanks is much more involving.But, like any good movie, there are flaws. Luckily, this movie escaped fairly unscathed, until the ending, however. At movie's end, it loses the same luster it had before, and the return to reality and the emotional challenges he will face are less intriguing or involving as those presented in the midsection of the story. And the silence experienced for so long seems shaken in a bad way once everything begins to round itself out.Nonetheless, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a compelling tale spun from the director of &quot;Contact,&quot; who tells the story the way it needs to be told. Hanks brings his best screenwork to the movie, while the entire effect of the movie is one of sheer awe and enamoration. Did you ever wish you were on a deserted island with someone else?

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[3, 3]","I can think of only a handful of movies that have their audiences cheering the indefatigable resiliency of the human spirit.  ""Papillon"" certainly comes to mind, as does ""Bridge Over the River Kwai.""  CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list; director Robert Zemeckis and headliner Tom Hanks deliver an absorbing, intense story about one man's refusal to be involuntarily exiled for the remainder of his days.Oh, the things we take for granted.  Running water.  Hot food.  A roof over our heads.  Imagine your predicament should you suddenly find yourself with none of these things--imagine your predicament if you had virtually no survival skills.  Such is the fate of Tom Hanks' character (a retentive, nondescript FedEx midmanager); one minute he's on a flight over the Pacific; the next he's on a secluded beach.  And thus both the character and the audience embark on a journey of discovery, as neither the cast away nor those viewing this film know how the survivor will be able to. . .survive.Accordingly, the conflict of the plot stubbornly yields to a series of victories--the audience and the character are simultaneously elated:  elated when that first coconut is opened; when that first fire is started; when--after four long, solitary years--a durable raft is built that will transport its lone passenger beyond the unforgiving barrier reef.  And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection--literally in the middle of nowhere.  For the viewers realize, as does the character, that following four years of rugged survival under harsh conditions, any subsequent obstacles or decisions are gravy.  Pure gravy.Tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.  He's believable, compelling, empathetic--funny.

Although it dips rather expectedly into a bit of the sentimentality of Forest Gump in the final few minutes, all involved can be forgiven on the strength of the rest of the film.  That Hanks lost the Oscar for best actor to Russell Crowe of Gladiator is only proof that the Oscars are devoid of whatever artistic integrity they might once have had.  Hanks, in his role as Chuck Noland, is superb in this film.  I was surprised that critics and reviewers haven't made more of what I saw to be the real core of the film--the drama of Noland's return.  While watching Noland (the name can't be coincidental!) surviving through ingenuity on his island was fascinating, the story's emotional heart is played out upon his return, when he finds out he's been cast away by his fiancee.

We first meet Chuck, our hapless workaholic FedEx employee, in Moscow where he's ranting and raving about time usage. Later we meet Helen Hunt, who's his equally busy girlfriend. Over Christmas [or somewhere around it], Chuck is called away for some emergency work. Before he leaves, Helen gives him a watch. In case the viewer hadn't picked up on it, the importance, or rather unimportance, of time is pounded into us from then on. This was one factor that made me angry about the film: it seems to assume the viewer is lacking the vital brain cells needed to pick up on plot elements.After we wade our way through the drawn out opening, Chuck's plane takes a dive, and he finds himself stranded on an island. This is where the heart of the film lies. The whole point of it. So why, I ask, do the start and finish take up just as much time? Anyway, we watch as Chucky Boy moves from the stages of hope, to anger, to acceptance, and eventually to total desperation. In this desperation he creates a friend for himself, a ball named Wilson. Sounds ridiculous, and I suppose it is, but you can sympathise. You don't laugh at a grown man having a discussion with a ball. This is the mark of good story telling.But, saddly, the ending doesn't follow through. It takes too long, and suddenly the walls seem fairly appealing. You might find yourself creating your own friend, naming him Alfredo, and discussing what it's like back out in the world.The directing for the island parts is impressive, even poetic. Hanks gives a solid performance, but it could have been a bit more subtle. In fact, the whole film could have been.The DVD looks to be loaded, so if you truly loved this movie, go for it.

I can safely say this is no ""Forrest Gump"".  FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.  This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.The initial premise was intriguing.  A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive.  At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment.  However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else.  There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles.  There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand.  Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.  Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down.  The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.Tom Hanks was in top form.  He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).  It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt.  She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.  This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough.  I rated it 7/10.  The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks.",4,Mediocre story propped up by outstanding Hanks performance,995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,1911,"['last', 'time', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'teamed', 'up', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'result', 'was', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'FG', 'was', 'terrific', 'story', 'further', 'enhanced', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'decent', 'story', 'propped', 'up', 'phenomenal', 'acting.The', 'initial', 'premise', 'was', 'intriguing', 'Fedex', 'employee', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'forced', 'use', 'ingenuity', 'survive', 'first', 'fascinating', 'watching', 'Chuck', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'adapt', 'stark', 'environment', 'However', 'hour', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'solely', 'island', 'exploits', 'film', 'begged', 'cut', 'somewhere', 'else', 'were', 'numerous', 'themes', 'were', 'running', 'simultaneous', 'island', 'was', 'search', 'rescue', 'Kelly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'coming', 'terms', 'loss', 'mention', 'two', 'most', 'obvious', 'themes', 'were', 'completely', 'neglected.Instead', 'Zemeckis', 'decided', 'should', 'have', 'Tom', 'time', 'gargantuan', 'talent', 'top', 'performance', 'became', 'just', 'bit', 'more', 'Tom', 'could', 'stand', 'Zemeckis', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'photography', 'induced', 'one', 'Hanks', 'best', 'performances', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'became', 'one-dimensional', 'began', 'bog', 'down', 'ending', 'brought', 'relief', 'drudgery', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'adrift', 'emotional', 'release', 'necessary', 'bring', 'story', 'closure.Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'deservedly', 'was', 'nominated', 'yet', 'best', 'actor', 'award', 'Academy', 'fifth', 'everywhere', 'turn', 'lately', 'see', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'made', 'four', 'films', '2000', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'two', 'months', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'year', 'part', 'was', 'small.The', 'film', 'grossed', '200', 'million', 'most', 'people', 'just', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'enough', 'rated', '7/10', 'one-dimensional', 'story', 'flat', 'ending', 'stifled', 'enthusiasm', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'Hanks']",N/A
534701,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B00003CXRP,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 1]","Tom Hank's role in Cast Away is one of his finest performances perhaps due to the difficulty with which the role presents. Playing the role of Fed Ex employee Chuck Nolan, Hank's character gets marooned on a deserted island when his plane goes down. As some reviewers have noted, the scenario for the film might not have sounded that appealing: a man gets stranded on an island and has to learn to survive with no one there, with his only true friend being (yes) a volleyball named Wilson. But, alas, Tom Hanks is able to pull this off and the movie is one of the more enjoyable films from director Robert Zemeckis.The real struggle for Chuck Nolan is his seemingly altered state of life: he goes from being someone very much akin to time and life because of his job and his fianc&eacute;e (played by Helen Hunt) to an individual isolated relying on survival, both physical and mental. He relies on everything he can to get back to the life he once led. The biggest epiphany that he experiences is that he can survive; he only comes to terms with this realization after several failed attempts on the island. Not only does he comprehend the importance of surviving each day, but he has a better understanding later of the significance of pushing forward despite obstacles and changes in life.The special effects and cinematic strategies used in the film are spectacular and vivid. For instance, the airplane crash scene seems to be so powerfully realistic. The moments of turbulence are followed by the big crash scene into the waters, and the struggle to make it to safety ensues. There are instances of no dialogue, where we see Chuck learning about the island and how to do things like attempting to hunt and find food, but Tom Hanks is able to make these moments entertaining and important. For instance, the frustration of trying to open a coconut shell at the beginning is comical, as well as the attempts to start a fire, ending with his own rendition of ""Light My Fire.""The message that I seemed to take away from the film was the idea of second chance. That is, if we were given a second chance at life, how would this play out in our lives. Chuck's biggest obstacle is that life has changed so much since his supposed ""death"" that he has a hard time tackling exactly what he should be doing, and he has a hard time putting everything together once he gets back.Overall, this is an excellent film and works well. If there is one drawback it is that the film length is a bit too long (two and a half hours almost). This probably could have been cut down to two hours. The DVD edition has extras that are worth checking out as well.",4,One of Tom Hank's best performances,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2639,"['Tom', 'Hank', 'role', 'Cast', 'Away', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'perhaps', 'due', 'difficulty', 'role', 'presents', 'Playing', 'role', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'employee', 'Chuck', 'Nolan', 'Hank', 'character', 'marooned', 'deserted', 'island', 'when', 'plane', 'down', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'scenario', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'sounded', 'appealing', 'man', 'stranded', 'island', 'learn', 'survive', 'one', 'there', 'only', 'true', 'friend', 'being', 'yes', 'volleyball', 'named', 'Wilson', 'alas', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'movie', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'films', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis.The', 'real', 'struggle', 'Chuck', 'Nolan', 'seemingly', 'altered', 'state', 'life', 'being', 'someone', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'life', 'job', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'individual', 'isolated', 'relying', 'survival', 'physical', 'mental', 'everything', 'can', 'get', 'back', 'life', 'once', 'led', 'biggest', 'epiphany', 'can', 'survive', 'only', 'terms', 'realization', 'several', 'failed', 'attempts', 'island', 'Not', 'only', 'comprehend', 'importance', 'surviving', 'day', 'better', 'understanding', 'later', 'significance', 'pushing', 'forward', 'obstacles', 'changes', 'life.The', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematic', 'strategies', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'spectacular', 'vivid', 'instance', 'airplane', 'crash', 'scene', 'be', 'so', 'powerfully', 'realistic', 'moments', 'turbulence', 'are', 'followed', 'big', 'crash', 'scene', 'waters', 'struggle', 'make', 'safety', 'ensues', 'are', 'instances', 'dialogue', 'where', 'see', 'Chuck', 'learning', 'island', 'how', 'do', 'things', 'attempting', 'hunt', 'find', 'food', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'able', 'make', 'moments', 'entertaining', 'important', 'instance', 'frustration', 'trying', 'open', 'coconut', 'shell', 'beginning', 'comical', 'as', 'well', 'attempts', 'start', 'fire', 'ending', 'own', 'rendition', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'message', 'seemed', 'take', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'idea', 'second', 'chance', 'were', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'out', 'lives', 'Chuck', 'biggest', 'obstacle', 'life', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'supposed', 'death', 'hard', 'time', 'tackling', 'exactly', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'everything', 'together', 'once', 'back.Overall', 'excellent', 'film', 'well', 'one', 'drawback', 'film', 'length', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'almost', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'down', 'two', 'hours', 'DVD', 'edition', 'extras', 'are', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Why you ask, because I use to date a girl back in 1996 when she lived here in Fitzgerald, GA.  Her name is Kelly aswell.  We dated briefly, but that all ending when her dad had to move to Houston, TX because of his job being transfered from the railcart co. here in Fitzgerld, GA, to Houston, TX.  Me and her lost contact with each other until 2002, when I was able to find where she was and to finally get in touch with her again.  She came back to Fitzgerald and We hugged each other for a long while.  She stayed for a day or so here in town with another family member of her's, then they left to go back to Houston, TX.  Sadly she started dating someone there in January of 2003.  She told me that she did not think she could take having a long distance relationship, which that does make since.  She did however came back later that year, but it was different.  She saw it as a Friendly visit instead. But we still email each other everynow and then.I know you could care less about my experience compared to this movie, but anyway Tom Hanks again brings in a great performance in &quot;CastAway&quot;, just like he did in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  The only thing I dislike about this movie is that he sounds like he is apologizes for not coming back to Kelly(Helen Hunt).  It's not his fault the plane went down and he got stranded on an island, and Kelly(Helen Hunt) should have held out longer to see if he would indid be found.  Which he is found and returns to Texas, and to his job as a Fed-Ex worker.  But Kelly(Helen Hunt) is now remarried and has a daughter.

534703,AY12DBB0U420B,B00003CXRP,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Cast Away"" and starred Tom Hanks. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade. I've always liked camping. I guess it's just a little adventure in  that you're out in the open and don't really know what's going to happen. Plus, it's coping with natural conditions. Well, that's just a micro-adventure, of course. If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give ""Cast Away"" a viewing.Tom Hanks played a globe-trotting, overly busy FedEx employee. He joined his fiance in Memphis at Christmas and promised to be back on New Year's Eve, after a quick trip to the Far East. Well, the FedEx plane went down somewhere in the Western Pacific. Hanks managed to escape and with a small inflatable raft made it to an unknown, apparently uninhabited island. His only possessions were that which he had on him and about a half-dozen FedEx packages which beached along with him plus a dead FedEx employee who was killed in the plane wreck and floated ashore. Well, it was immediately back to The Stone Age for Hanks with no food, no tools no shelter and few clothes. Of course, there were the FedEx packages, which had such useful items as a pair of figure skates, a volleyball and a big collection of VHS tapes. The skates became his only tool and the volleyball, with a face fashioned out of a blood smear, became his only companion He called the ball Wilson, after the brand name.The movie depicted Hanks' struggle to cope with his environment and find enough foodstuffs to survive. He ended up living on coconuts, small crustaceans and the few fish he could catch. Ultimately, he got a fire started, Boy Scout Style. This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted. Ultimately, he built a raft out of wood scraps tied together mostly by vines and the VHS tapes. He managed to get it out beyond the surf zone with him then floating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization. Everyone had given up on his survival. He had been given a funeral. They even buried a casket containing some of his belongings. His fiance was married and had about a three-year-old daughter.This was just a stunningly good movie. Essentially, it's a one-man show with just a bit of minor support at the beginning and end. There is no question in my mind that Hanks should have had the Best Actor Academy Award no matter what the competition was, His performance was just stunning. The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect. Essentially, there was almost no action. It was just a one-man struggle against nature. There were no wild animals, not even birds. No disasters, other than the plane crash. No musical score to accompany the movie. None of the essentials, yet it was a stunningly good movie.Gary Peterson",5,An Adventure Story For All Time.

All he had on his side was to strong will to overcome all problems in hand with undying spirit.No woman is there in this action replay of human history, but it emphasizes enough on importance of a partner in human life through 'Wilson' - the soccer ball.

Usage of dialogue is very economical but thanks to Hanks, its always lively.

534709,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,B00003CXRP,Godly Gadfly,"[2, 3]","Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a modern day Robinson Crusoe.  It's far from it!  Survival is only a small part of the story of Chuck Noland, who ends up on a deserted island in the Pacific after a plane crash.  There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.  Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.  As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot - on the plane as it goes down, on the raft as it bobs in the waves, on the island alone.  It's the realism that's led to the PG-13 rating, and not offensive content.  Admittedly there are a few items of content that are morally questionable, such as a few incidents of blasphemy, a crude sexual joke, and the contemplation of suicide.  Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though-out his stay on the island there's a real absence of religious faith as fatalism replaces providence (while burying a crash victim, Chuck concludes an ""empty"" ceremony with the words ""So.  That's it."")  But on the whole this movie is morally inoffensive, and its PG-13 rating is mainly due to frightening scenes, such as the airplane crash and later a floating dead body, and several injuries including the scraping of skin on coral, a splinter in his hand, and the removal of a tooth.  But even these scenes are more frightening because of the emotional sense of pain than graphic images.  Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening. Hitchcock would have been proud.But even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie. The survival story is framed by the story of Chuck's life in America.  As a result, the movie is like a play with three Acts.  Act 1 introduces us to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx systems engineer whose professional life is ruled by the clock.  ""We live and we die by time.  Let us not commit the sin of turning our back on time.""  His personal life, including his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) is dominated by time, and it is exactly for this reason that Chuck ends up on the doomed plane which crashes into the Pacific in a storm.Acts 2 shows Chuck cast away on the island.  The clock, as it were, has stopped.  His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).  The island is no utopian tropical paradise, and consequently Chuck doesn't succeed with everything right away.  As he seeks to obtain the basic elements needed for human survival - food, water, shelter, fire, and companionship - there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.  There is little dialogue, but a few floating FedEx packages supply him with ""Wilson"" the volleyball, who becomes his companion.  It's somewhat corny, but Wilson becomes a device for Chuck to express his thoughts and hold imaginary conversations.  Time has stopped on the timepiece Kelly gave him, but it is her photo on the clock that inspires Chuck to stay alive.Act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.  His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.  As his colleague says: ""Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life.""  But coming back to life isn't so easy when you return to a world after five years where time hasn't stopped.  If surviving as a castaway on an island was difficult, Chuck discovers that it's just as difficult to be alive in the changed world to which he has returned.  Back at home, he's still a castaway.  Just as on the island, where ""I stayed alive.  I kept breathing"", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring.  A magnificent story-line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.  I was grateful that the story didn't degenerate into a feel-good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live-in relationship).  The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.  There is a note of hope in the end, but it is not shoved down your throat, with Chuck left at the cross-roads of decision: ""Where are you headed?  Well, I was just about to figure that out.""  If there is a criticism, it would perhaps be that we don't get to spend as much time with the changed Chuck in Act 3 as we would like -  he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.  But for viewers whose lives are also governed by the clock, what we do see is already enough to motivate us to spend our few years on earth under the clock wisely.",5,More than a survival

But I just finished watching this movie in theaters about an hour ago and WOW, I was completly amazed!!! (review next, storyline after the space). The screenplay is an excellent one that packs plenty of jokes to keep you laughing throughout a good portion of the movie. Beyond jokes, this movie keeps you constantly on the edge of you seats trying to guess whats gonna happen next from the airplane crashing, how he'll survive on the island, and especially what will be of him &amp; Kelly when he comes back. Tom Hank's preformance was incredible by keeping it real and emotional with that characteristic Tom Hanks touch. The same goes for Helen Hunt whose excellent perfermance being Kelly, Chuck's girlfriend, gave this movie the romantic lighting that only a good female actress can bring. And most of all, unlike other bad movies this year, all the great things about a movie, the wonderful acting, the suspense, the humor, excitement, &amp; complete enraping of the viewer flows from beginning to end at exactly the right times and not just a couple of scenes. The only minor problem I have with this movie is that it never answers our ? of what will happen to Chuck's life now that he's back alive from the island especially with his love life.Its a story about Chuck, a man that works for Fedex, who has to leave for an air flight delivery right before Christmas, but he promises his girlfriend, Kelly, that he'll be home by New Years. Little does he know that after he gets out of the car and goes to the plane with his Christmas present of a gold pocket watch with Kelly's picture in it, that he will not return home to Memphis in a long time. Instead his plane crash lands somewhere in the pacific with him as the only survivor who is fortunate enough to be pushed by the waves to be on an island. From that he finds all sorts of ingenious ways to survive for a long long long long time from island resources and a few FEDEX packages (not giving the details away). When Chuck later did get back to Memphis (how-you gotta see it to believe it) he'll find that he's got his job at FEDEX back but things are a bit different especially his girlfriend Kelly.

The director is bringing out a lot of worthy films at the moment, and choosing to work with Tom Hanks an awful lot is the right answer to success. So, what makes Cast Away worth seeing? From the trailer, it looks like a guy gets stranded on an island, yes? Well, the movie has a deeper meaning to it - it's about not abandoning what you believe in and never giving up on hope. We've probably all heard that meaning before, but since it is only one actor playing all of it out by himself, it seems somehow more complex and detailed. Tom Hanks' performance is absolutely brilliant; his most memorable yet playing a character that has morals everyone should follow.

It was nice and all that (slightly interesting), yet I felt that after walking away from it, there had been too many missed opportunities which might have lifted the feature above a mere ordinary level.Tom Hanks gave a fine performance, though his character seldom appeared realistic to me (that's just me).

I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally get the urge to watch it again about once a year or so. I make no comments whatsoever on which release is what or HD, different versions and tech specs. I speak strictly of the movie itself.It was well done and very haunting with the psychology of loneliness and isolation. The silence and lack of soundtrack through most of the movie drives it home, though when you watch it for the first time, you usually can't put your finger on it. We're so trained to hear music scores and laugh tracks and they are effecting the feel of the story without us ever knowing it. Its almost subliminal. When you remove it, you can't help but know something is off and have a guttural reaction to the intense silence - something most of us rarely hear these days.Considering how many times this movie has been spoofed with the line ""Wilson!"" You almost have to watch just for popularity purposes, but the reason it's popular is its so damn good. Hanks' character is so palpable and real, you feel his frustration, fear and sadness. To imagine being so close, yet so far and knowing for so long that everyone you ever loved is moving on without you. And how such a intelligent, grounded person is driven to making an imaginary friend out of a volleyball to keep his sanity.Bottom line, its well done, well acted and a great story about resilience and loneliness and moving on.

This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.  Tom Hanks is a fantastic Actor who pushes his acting talent to the very limit and beyond.  Its too bad he didint win best actor at the academy awards.  The film itself is excelent.  At first you are treated to Tom fussing about in Russia, eating a gigantic dinner and getting a birthday gift.  All the wile you are waiting for the fantastic Island sequences.  Well trust me its worth it.  The plane crash sequence is the most realistic and frightining crash I have ever seen.  The rest of the film is excellent.  I could go on blabbering about the island, toms acting but a few things stand out above the rest.  The music (All 10 minutes of it) is very good but made me wish for more.  Wilson the vollyball is one of the finest actors hollywood has ever seen.  He has solid acting, a great expression and a great guy all around.  He should have won best supporting actor at the academy awards.  However I should point out this movies 2 flaws.  The first is that some sequences are too scary or too grusome for anyone under 14, heck Im 14 and I had trouble ingesting this stuff.  Tom getting scrapped against the coral, Tom getting a really big splinter in his hand in graphic detail, and (Shudder) the skating shoe in the mouth moment is one of the most painfull scenes I have ever had to watch.  The ending is a big letdown and dissapointing.  But both of those dont flaw this other wise masterpiece movie.The Good: Tom Hanks acting is superb.  Wilson the Vollyball is a great supporting actor.  Lots of funny moments, very exciting and well done movie.The Bad: Some sequences are grusome and hard to watch, what happens to Wilson is really really sad.  Only 10 minutes of music?

The idea SEEMED to be:  man allows work to engulf his life, perfect employee but losing control of his personal life, man gets &quot;second chance&quot; by getting standed on a island giving him a chance to &quot;think about life&quot; and reconsider his priorities.Like Speilberg's newest fiasco A.I., I think Zemeckis just didn't understand what he had.  I instead of making what could have been a very meaningful film, he decided to foof it up, add some tears and some smiles, make that all tears and smiles, to a point that the story doesn't really matter.The first act is the man, Hanks, as he was.  Hard worker, busy little worker be.  But with all the Federal Express logos and pep rallies saturating the screen time, its hard to really tell what's trying to be said.  Big corporations bad?  No?  They turn you into robots though, at their becken call.  But big corporation good for us little guys who need our packages on time (since time rules our lives too, we need things FAST).  Very confusing.The second act, man (Hanks) &quot;finding himself.&quot;  I don't think this is what desolation is about.  Maybe Zemeckis should watch directors such as Antonio, Wenders, and Jarmusch who have perfected the visualization of loneliness on the big screen.  This all plays out being too goofy and rediculous.  Sure this is the &quot;movies&quot; but with a story like this SOME realism is expected!  This could have played out to be a big step for hollywood if Zemeckis did this sequence the right way.  Let the audience feel the pain of loneliness, quiet minimalism CAN be good.  Our attention spans need to be tested and the film could have drawn the viewers in so much more (therefore opening themselves up for even more Zemeckis sap).Third act.  It's all down hill from here.  A strange love story happens.  Its all been done before.  Man loves woman.  Man dissappears, presumed dead.  Woman marries someone else (trust me, I'm not ruining anything for you).  Man comes back finds his wife with another man/family.  Man tries to get woman back.  Man denied.  Man finds new woman.  And the funniest thing about the third act is that he finds himself emerced in work as soon as he gets back to the world again.  And he seems happy doing so.  And he finds his &quot;new love&quot; how else, but by successfully delivering a federal express package to her (one of the packages that washes up on the deserted with Hanks - conveniently nothing is ever mentioned of the other packages, such as the ever so famous volleyball, that the federal express employee opened, rumaged through and used, left or ruined during his stay on the island).

Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express exec who is driven by time and efficiency which have no meaning once he's cast onto a remote tropical island.*** Chuck scratches the surface of insanity trying to eke out an existence.  He forages, he laps rain water puddled in leaves, and he spears fish.  It's pathetic, but each accomplishment in stone age living is poignant in its way.  His loneliness is hugely palpable throughout his ordeal.*** For such a major studio production, it's amazing not to have the extravagant trappings of costuming, makeup, special effects, and stunts.  Dialogue virtually disappears once Hanks' character reaches the island, save for the one-sided exchanges he has with his sole companion -- a volleyball he names &quot;Wilson.&quot;  Even the musical score is held back for much of the movie, and when it does re-emerge, you realize you're back on more familiar territory after extreme deprivation.*** The film is fully realized but oddly unsatisfying.  There's an impersonal pall over the movie that the viewer can't quite shake.  However, the bonus disc interview by Charlie Rose with Tom Hanks is very winning.

But, on his way there on the plane, it crashes in the ocean and he winds up on a deserted island with hardly any food and inevitably no future.  All he can survive on is his primal instincts, lessons learned either from boy scouts or 2001 (the movie), or on a few fed-ex supplies.  To see Hanks like this on the island, doing things is amazing enough.  There is one scene in particular where he is creating fire that might be one of the best scenes by itself ever.  The way he shows his eyes, the way the camera shows the fire being made, the face, even the look on the face of his inanimate volleyball Wilson, is extraordinary.  Speaking of which, even though the volleyball which is named Wilson (intentionally, but possibly not) never speaks, it and Hanks give one of the best on-screen duo's in years.  The fact that he can communicate with this lifeless yet quirkily funny sport's object and make it entertaining in some ways similar to Jay and Silent Bob, is just one of the film's triumphs.Overall, not only does Tom Hanks give the best performance of the year, he gives his second best performance of his career.

Munson,"[4, 5]","I have been a huge Tom Hanks fan for many years and I have seen many of his movies, but I rate ""Cast Away"" as one of the best films he has ever made.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive.Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee, and Helen Hunt stars as Kelly, Chuck's fiancee.  On Christmas Eve, Chuck is scheduled to fly to the Far East on FedEx business, but while in flight, the plane encounters a terrible storm and they are forced to deviate from their original flight plan.  This course change takes them over 400 miles off course.  Even with the coruse change, the storm is still raging, and soon, the plane, damaged greatly by the effects of the storm, plunges into the Pacific Ocean.  Chuck is the only survivor.For the next four years, Chuck is forced to struggle to survive on a deserted island far away from any shipping lanes or air routes.  He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.  Naming the volleyball ""Wilson"", it becomes a companion for Chuck, who uses it to converse with and vent frustration.  Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.  With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.  After drifting for over 500 miles, Chuck is finally picked up by a ship and returned to civilization.Upon returning home, he realizes that much of his former life has changed.  He is told that his fellow FedEx employees held a funeral for him when they thought he was dead, and his former fiancee Kelly is now married to another man and has a child of her own.  Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be together after so much had happened to both of them.The ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.  It shows Chuck standing in a crossroads trying to decide which direction to go.  He is also probably trying to decide which direction to take with his life as well.This is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.  The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.  Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.  It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.  I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.

The whole film is really a setup for Hanks' return to society, but that's the part of the film that gets least developed. Instead, we get Tom Hanks as a Boy Scout becoming one with nature (culminating in a truly embarassing moment in which a whale swims up to Hanks and winks at him.)During his stint on the island, Hanks implausibly talks to Wilson, a volleyball. This might sound refresingly quirky, but for me it was awful (at the very least the moment where Hanks snaps &amp; talks to him the 1st time was unbelievable). The film never really explores any of the psychological issues that a man that does such things must surely have.The first 20 minutes of the film were awful, with Tom Hanks being the prototypical idealized American (bringing Elvis to the Russians, saving them from their own inefficiency, etc..) The casting of Tom Hanks appears to be the film's major characterization. The guy's obsessed with time, and loves his fianc&eacute;, but what else do we know about him? We're expected to assume he's an everyman solely by the typecasting of Hanks.Those are all pretty major concerns in my book... I didn't HATE it, but it's hardly a success. I think that Cast Away spends roughly half its time off the island. It would be nice if the film actually created a believeable set of developed characters for Hanks to interact with when he was off the island. I don'tthink there are any decent characters in the film.What *did* work for me was the decent direction, and the basic narrative. There's something inherently compelling about the situation, even if the movie screwed up on the specifics... I guess my basic complaint is that I've seen Fearless &amp; The Sweet Hereafter, etc... , which deal with this sort of thing in a much better, more realistic manner. A traumatic event like this has wide-ranging emotional effects.

More than likely, that means you already like the movie, but now you're wondering if the DVD is worth the money. This is a 2-disc set loaded with extras, but how good are they? 20th Century Fox puts out some of the best DVD releases around, and this is no exception. The running commentary is by 5 or 6 people, including director Robert Zemeckis, but it is dominated by discussion on sound effects, followed only by visual effects. I found this to be very enlightening, but it started to get repetitive toward the end of the film. I mean, there are only so many ways to say how wind and water sounds replaced music in the film. I was also disappointed that other topics weren't discussed. Fortunately, all of the featurettes included on the 2nd disc take care of the commentary's missing information. In hindsight, it actually seems like careful planning on Fox's part as there is a document for almost every aspect of the production. There is a featurette describing the island location, one describing the story of Wilson, small snippets on visual effects, Charlie Rose's interview with Tom Hanks describing his experiences, and a documentary about the research done for surviving on a deserted island. Anything left out is covered in the above-standard &quot;making-of.&quot;  Fox has once again done a wonderful job with a DVD release: elegant, animated menus and content that has been well thought-out and full of interesting information.

This movie, like almost all of today's films, was poorly sold. In the space of a sixty second commercial, not only did they tell you all of the above info-admittedly this is a simple story-they also took out all of the suspense of the movie by spilling the beans about the 3rd Act and the fact that he gets rescued. All that's left to discover is the last 20 minutes. We don't know much about Hanks' character beside the fact that he's a workaholic, and that his life is dictated by the Clock. And this is where the film falls short. By not knowing what kind of man this is, or even what he thinks he is, there is nothing to discover about his transformation,of which there is very little, other than the physical. Sure there is the isolation and the depression to witness and the creation of fire and the finding of food and shelter, but there is a larger protrait missing here. It's the difference between a good film and a great film. Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland. Noland is more of a statistic than a character. An actress of Helen Hunt's stature, and talent, is badly needed because we can plug in bits of her other characterizations into the story to keep her presence alive. Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not. And like his other big film FORREST GUMP, you're not sure what,if anything, he's trying to say. Zmeckis is a very external director, so it's no wonder many, many people didn't get the last scene of this film. It feels like a different, and more talented director helmed this scene. It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film. Like the director started using a different film language, is the best way I can explain it.No wonder many people didn't get it. It's more in the style of older foreign language films. I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round....As for the DVD, the DTS sound is superb and the extras at times, do a better job of defining the movie's intentions, than the film itself.",4,Enjoyable...but flawed.,994204800,"07 4, 2001",2001,2387,"['Fed-Ex', 'workaholic', 'recently', 'engaged', 'sole', 'survivor', 'plane', 'crash', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'four', 'years', 'movie', 'almost', 'today', 'films', 'was', 'poorly', 'sold', 'space', 'sixty', 'second', 'commercial', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'tell', 'above', 'info-admittedly', 'simple', 'story-they', 'also', 'took', 'out', 'suspense', 'movie', 'spilling', 'beans', '3rd', 'Act', 'fact', 'rescued', 'left', 'discover', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Hanks', 'character', 'fact', 'workaholic', 'life', 'dictated', 'Clock', 'where', 'film', 'short', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'kind', 'man', 'even', 'what', 'nothing', 'discover', 'transformation', 'very', 'little', 'other', 'physical', 'Sure', 'isolation', 'depression', 'witness', 'creation', 'fire', 'finding', 'food', 'shelter', 'larger', 'protrait', 'missing', 'here', 'difference', 'good', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'Hanks', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'truely', 'full', 'dimensional', 'character', 'play', 'Hanks', 'see', 'island', 'not', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Noland', 'more', 'statistic', 'character', 'actress', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'stature', 'talent', 'badly', 'needed', 'can', 'plug', 'bits', 'other', 'characterizations', 'story', 'keep', 'presence', 'alive', 'Robert', 'Zmeckis', 'good', 'director', 'entertainment', 'films', 'got', 'taste', 'class', 'film', 'needed', 'artist', 'Zmeckis', 'not', 'other', 'big', 'film', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'anything', 'trying', 'say', 'Zmeckis', 'very', 'external', 'director', 'wonder', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'different', 'more', 'talented', 'director', 'helmed', 'scene', 'completely', 'odds', 'stylistically', 'rest', 'film', 'director', 'started', 'using', 'different', 'film', 'language', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'explain', 'it.No', 'wonder', 'many', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'style', 'older', 'foreign', 'language', 'films', 'think', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'wish', 'Zmeckis', 'had', 'started', 'filming', 'movie', 'shooting', 'scene', 'instead', 'other', 'way', '.As', 'DVD', 'DTS', 'sound', 'superb', 'extras', 'times', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'defining', 'movie', 'intentions', 'film']",N/A

How he deals with it, and how he tries to deal with being thrust back into society, are the focal points of the film.  It was a film that I thought about over and over in the weeks after seeing it.  It is a Greek tragedy.  Perhaps critics were looking for another &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;.  This film is not it.  There is much criticism regarding the ending.  I confess that I fail to see what's wrong with the ending.  I believe it is realistic.  Perhaps people want a traditional Hollywood &quot;happy&quot; ending.  Life's not like that.  Some viewer's have also picked nits over silly details - like the fact that Hank's fingernails are too nicely manicured for a man stranded on an island for 5 years.  Sheesh!

When I put the movie in to watch, I was quite surprised that I disagreed often with that review.  They gave the picture five out of five stars.  I would give it maybe 3 1/2 out of five.Cast Away is a great film, and it's hard not to like Hanks' performance.  His entertaining interaction with his environment despite its desolation of other humans is reason enough to watch the film, and he truly pulls us in to feeling the same as he does: lonely and nearly hopeless.  Most of the film involves Hanks and no one else, but the lack of socialization does not mean lack of engrossing material.  A+ for story and acting.Since most people are probably interested in this Blu-ray edition for picture and audio reasons, I will give my honest feelings.  I think that the picture is quite inconsistent, with plenty grain, blurred backgrounds, and sometimes dull colors.  This surprised me because of the film's location.  We would expect everything on a tropical island to blow us away on film (Into the Blue is a great example of high definition oceanic beauty), but plenty of times it fails to wow.  As for inconsistencies, the Cast Away can look stunning at times, only to immediately follow up with blur or grain.  If you are interested in stunning photography, don't expect to see it often.  For this reason, I'm quite disappointed (it should have been restored better).There's no complaining on the audio.  This film was nominated for an Oscar for sound, and the Blu-ray displays the audiophile prestige in its full glory.  If you have surround sound and want to truly test its ability, get this film.Overall, I am glad that I purchased this Blu-ray.  The film is great, and for whatever reason, this is the first copy of the film I've owned.

534759,A1KCQ1ZCSCP1KN,B00003CXRP,Jonathan Coish,"[3, 3]","I really enjoyed this movie. At the beginning of the movie you're shown the type of person Tom Hanks character is. And then when he's stranded on the desert island the two people just seem totally opposite, and that's a pretty cool effect. He is a workaholic typer person living a very fast paced life one minute, and then the next he's stranded with nothing trying to survive. The performance by Tom Hanks is very very good as well. It's just him obviously, but it never gets boring. Through much of the island scenes there isn't much talking, but watching his gradual progress on the island is just captivating. Throughout his time on the island you can gradually see his sanity beginning to crack, but always he manages to hold on with his picture of the woman he loves. The caracter Wilson, appropriately named, is pretty silly in a way, but you really find watching the movie that you begin to see &quot;him&quot; as a real character and not an inanimate vollyball. The scene where Tom Hanks character loses Wilson is very good. When you look at the fact that he kicks up such a fuss over losing a vollyball it's hard to feel anything, but it's the idea that he loses his only companion, his friend for all his time on the island that is the idea there. Anyways, then he is rescued and is returned to his home. The scene with him lying on the floor in his hotel room turning the light on and off looking at the picture is absolutely beautiful. It really shows the effect that the island had on him. He's home, but yet he's still the person he was on the island. The highlight of the film however is the meeting with him and the woman he loves. The tension, confusion, anticipation, etc, is all there, and it really pulls the viewer on emotionally as well. The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a crossroads, and he smiles. There is still hope even though his life was stripped away.All in all, this movie is beautiful, and very very good. It takes the viewer through so many emotions, that it's hard not to lose yourself in the film. Oh, and the scene where the plane goes down is totally intense, I almost forgot about that.

While the idea about changes and the motto ...to keep breathing shines but it doesn't make the viewer's heart feel any better because of what happened between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunts characters.

It could be mistaken as slow but the slowness is vital to its very structure. When Hanks got his nomination, I thought again, another year, something is wrong with the academy.

Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role as Chuck Noland, a FedEx executive who is the sole survivor of a cargo plane crash near a remote island in the middle of the ocean way off course, and consequently not in the path of where they would be searching.  His will to survive is strengthened by his love for Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt, whom he was planning to marry when the plane went down.  One of the reasons the film works so well is that Hanks actually lost 50 or 60 lbs during the filming. They literally halted the production for a year or so, giving him that amount of time to lose the weight, so scenes of him on the beach with his shirt off at the beginning of the movie, and then later when he's looking like he truly hasn't eaten anything other than fish for 4 years lends an air of authenticity to the film that could never occur had he merely worn a &#34;fat&#34; suit to begin with, etc.  But it's his portrayal of a man whose spirit than will not give up that gives this movie its soul and in the end.. even though it doesn't have a fairy tale ending.. it definitely satisfies the viewer to the point where you almost don't want it to end.",5,One of my all time favorite movies,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1239,"['just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'good', 'survivor', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'FedEx', 'executive', 'who', 'sole', 'survivor', 'cargo', 'plane', 'crash', 'remote', 'island', 'middle', 'ocean', 'way', 'course', 'consequently', 'not', 'path', 'where', 'would', 'be', 'searching', 'will', 'survive', 'strengthened', 'love', 'Kelly', 'Frears', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'whom', 'was', 'planning', 'marry', 'when', 'plane', 'went', 'down', 'One', 'reasons', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'Hanks', 'actually', 'lost', '50', '60', 'lbs', 'filming', 'literally', 'halted', 'production', 'year', 'so', 'giving', 'amount', 'time', 'lose', 'weight', 'scenes', 'beach', 'shirt', 'off', 'beginning', 'movie', 'then', 'later', 'when', 'looking', 'truly', ""n't"", 'eaten', 'anything', 'other', 'fish', '4', 'years', 'air', 'authenticity', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'occur', 'had', 'merely', 'worn', '34', 'fat', '34', 'suit', 'begin', 'etc', 'portrayal', 'man', 'spirit', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'movie', 'soul', 'end..', 'even', ""n't"", 'have', 'fairy', 'tale', 'ending..', 'definitely', 'viewer', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'end']",N/A

In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.

Heck, one of the most important characters in the film is a volleyball. This is also a great demonstration as to how a good creative team can take something like that and make it work so amazingly well.I'm not sure this could have worked with any actor other than Tom Hanks. Many actors would love to boast that they alone could carry a film, but here Tom Hanks actually does just that by effectively playing the sole character in the film for roughly 3/4ths the films total length.The sense of realism represented in the film in pretty much every respect is amazing. I've never been in a plane crash, but I imagine the depiction we see here has more basis in reality than the flashy effects sequences usually see in film. I also loved that they didn't try to make the island out to be some tropical paradise with postcard shots and filtering. It's obviously a nice location, but they appropriately didn't emphasize that as that would negatively effect the films atmosphere. The trials he faces are a tad basic, but yet the two hours flies by before you know it due to a great script and an amazing performance from Hanks. The score is also minimalistic, likely because filling the scenes with music might effect the sense of isolation you are supposed to have. All in all I loved the art direction they took with the film.The metal case this version of the film arrives in is great. The insert is nothing amazing but they did well with the special features. Sure, they're nothing that will leave you in awe, but it's enough to give you some insight on the films production and regarding the subject matter itself.

""Kimberly""","[1, 2]","Okay what is our obesseion with being deserted on a tropical island that makes human-beings write books, make movies, and now even television shows about it? I suppose it's that we wonder what life would be like if everything we need to survive is taking away.This movie starts out giving us a portrait of Chuck Nolan(Tom Hanks) the Fed-Ex worker who lives and dies by the clock. Chuck appears to be arrogant, smart mouthed, and fast on his feet. The one real good thing in Chuck's life is his girlfriend Kelly(Helen Hunt) who he has been in a long relationship. Well on Christmas Eve everything changes for Chuck- work driven he decides to go on a buisness trip over the up coming Holiday him and Kelly exchanging Christmas gifts in the car. When turbulance strikes the plane, the plane goes down crashing somewhere near the Cook Island- Hanks is suddenly alone being the only survior he learns to cope and make use of FedEx packages that wash ashore from the crash. At this point of desertion on the island you hear little to no dialouge which gives you a sense of solitude that Hanks is feeling except when he talks to a ball that he calls ""Wilson"" giving you the sense that he is craving for social interaction. Hanks struggles with difficult tasks from fishing to making fire. He is helpless. Until four years later, you see a much thinner Hanks, with a long beard, who has learned how to cope with what must be done on the island. Suddenly when a small piece of the wrekage washes ashore- Chuck makes the decision to use it as a sail and go out into the waters risk his life, rather stay on the island waiting to die. When Chuck is saved, by a passing ship he is returned a world he barely remembers anything about, except for Kelly- who is now married and has a child. Nolan's one reason for living on the island was- Kelly now, with that hope smashed he has to learn to survie the heartbreak to go on.Tom Hanks gives a good performance as Nolan but, not his absolute best. Helen Hunt also does a good job as Kelly but, her role in ""Pay It Forward"" in my opinon was her best performance ever. With little to no dialogue in most of the movie, I couldn't help but feel that desertion for Hanks and even I found myself looking upon the ball ""Wilson"" that he talks to a good friend. This movie made me think about all the things I do have in my life and am grateful for. Who wouldn't want to be stuck on a deserted island with Hanks?I also like the message contained in the movie when Hanks said ""Tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide will drag in,"" after he loses Kelly, he goes out to Texas so he can return a package he found on the island- the only one he couldn't open (for the fact it had this gorgeous butterfly painted on it) when, a woman stops to help him as he looks lost-telling him which roads lead to where.

The middle part of the movie, chronicling Noland's struggle for survival and sanity on the lonely outpost, is far and away the most effective portion, not the least because of Hanks' startling physical transformation from a doughy, somewhat overweight landlubber to a lean, tanned survivor.It is also effective because there is very little or no dialogue in this part, and therein lies the problem with the rest of the film. Too often the rest of the script is content with banalities and cliches that sink rather than buoy up the inherent drama in the situations; Helen Hunt, as Hanks' patient fiance, has the worst time of it, particularly in the last portion, after our hero is unexpectedly rescued and must cope with the shock of re-entry into the land of the living. The action here is hurried and superficially treated as well, calling for a separate film to make a truly moving effect.

Tom Hanks reunites with director Zemeckis after Forrest Gump and gives another amazing performance, alongside his co-star, Wilson, a vollyball that gets washed up in the wreckage from the plane crash. And this is where Hanks' brilliant performance shows, with the slowly building friendship that Chuck has with his vollyball buddy.Zemeckis' direction is strong and well-handled when events are on the island; witness Chuck's discovery of the dead pilot, his attempts to start a fire, and a truly wincing moment where he does some DIY dentistry. The fact that Hanks can hold his own as the only guy on the island for two hours (albeit with Wilson) is a true testimony of his unique talent.The problem is, once the film gets to the end, events get tiresome, where we are greeted with far too much exposition , and after a while, you start to get somewhat weary of the over-wrought sentiment.

It is, of course, not a unique theme (what is nowadays?) in that it the story of a modern, successful corporate cog who is suddenly and unexpectedly forced to deal with a situation that requires him to learn anew how to survive.  During the course of which, he naturally is forced to reassess his own worldview as he no longer exists in an environment over which he has control.  I found the symbolism in this movie to be quite significant and relevant.  But overall the movie was not as profound and authentic as it could have been.  In fact, even with my limited knowledge of the subject, it is quite clear that the island could not have sustained any human life over the course of four years.  Interestingly enough, although license was taken in terms of the feasability of Chuch's survival on an isolated ecosystem, the producers had no problem in casting him as the employee of an actual courier company.  We could well have gotten the point of this movie had they devised a superficial company, which makes the movie in essence a three hour commercial.(In regards to the previous review concerning the package.

It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading.

Director Robert Zemeckis(Forrest Gump) and Hanks have combined again and succeeded again.The film opens with Hanks, a Federal Express employee, in Russia drilling the Fed Ex employees there about better time management.  His job for Fed Ex apparently takes him all over the place and leaves little time for his girlfriend played by Helen Hunt.  Another assignment takes him off and while trying to avoid a storm the plane crashes.  This is where the movie really gets going.  Hanks lands on an island and finds himself completely alone.  This turns out to be quite a compelling character study as he tackles the most basic of needs while trying to keep hope.  Four years pass and Hanks is still there and he finally decides to leave.  Unfortunatly as the previews showed us he makes it and then...Since Zemeckis decided to let the audience know ahead of time that Hanks is saved the only real suspense is whether or not he will get Hunt back.  This does not really matter because the film is good one way or another.  Hanks is brilliant.  Very few actors could tackle a project like this and still keep it interesting and engaging, especially for as long as he does in this film.  The island is definatly the best part of this movie and the rest is not as compelling.

It was because of him that I took the time out to watch this movie in the first place (also the case of &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; as well).Second of all, I love to be entertained.  And this movie did it for me.  I don't understand how some people can give it a hard time.  They say the storyline was boring, they say the ending was lackluster.  They just don't find it a very engaging movie.Okay, that's all well and fine.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  But this is where those people and I differ.I don't go to movies looking for some meaning, spiritual or otherwise, to change my life.  I don't really care about whether the storyline makes sense.  I go to and watch movies for the entertainment value, and &quot;Cast Away&quot; entertained the heck out of me.I will admit that the first 20 or so minutes of this movie are a bit slow.  And I will also admit that the ending leaves much to be desired.  It's always a disappointment when anything you're engaged in just stops, and this movie falls right into that category.  But everything in between, from that heart-racing plane crash sequence (without a doubt the most realistic plane crash you will see in a movie) to all the different ways that Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is put through the rigger are great.There is very little musical score in this movie, but that only enhances the &quot;isolated feeling&quot; that one is to feel while watching the movie.  When it does come, it sweeps you away and tugs at your heart.In short, I thought this movie was great.  I loved everything on the island, I thought Wilson was a great side-character (definitely the best acting volleyball I've ever seen), and so many other things that I won't go into here.If you haven't seen it yet, give it a chance.

For me it was a great treat watching Billy. Billy has this sarcastic criticism about the Entertainment Industry - and life overall - that is so close to things I have said about people, places and things that I often wonder if he is following me recording my thoughts! He is hysterical!Now - as far as the film goes....it has a pretty big cast - John Cussack (16 Candles, Say Anything, The Grifters) and Cathrine Zeta Jones (The Mask Of Zorro, the new Chicago, The Haunting) do a great job as the `Hollywood Couple' gone wrong. Except for the public eye and the personalities on camera - off camera they are `oil and water'. Cathrine character is support by the hysterically funny and often underrated Hank Azaria (The Birdcage, Godzilla, Anastasia) as her Cuban lover. He is a scene-stealer! Here's another talent that needs o be given a chance. Through it all, Billy Crystal's character, the publicist (who also has a sidekick - cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich). Quite a cast, right?Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see); Christopher Walkin (Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, Mouse Hunt) There is comedy, slapstick, farce and more. A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines - like - `...oh look, there's the buffet..."" and many many, more!

Who else could carry that much time alone on the screen with nothing to talk to but a volleyball- put in for that very reason.  I enjoyed watching the interpretation of the challenges he would face on a deserted island and how he survived.  I was a little disappointed with how they brought him back- there was such a struggle to survive- only to be shoved in a hotel room with seafood on the table, loved that irony.  I did not like what happens with Hunt's char. Kelly and Hanks' char. upon his return.  I felt that if I had been in Kelly's position I would have fought harder to be with the man that she called 'the love of her life.'  I don't just want a 'feel good' ending but I am not sure that they made the right call with that relationship.  I know that if I had the oppurtunity to be with the love of my life after thinking he was dead I would have wanted nothing more than to be with him and everything else would have worked out around that.  But then again- she is a mom... So much for coming home- only to be alone again.  He had to face the challenge of re-entering society and after 4 years alone that is also difficult, I liked the scenes where they showed him readjusting to life with 'conviences.'  I still think that overall it is an excellent film- one which everyone should watch!

Fernandez ""Bookiewookie""","[0, 0]","In 2000 I saw the movie like almost everyone else and was surprised to sit through more than two hours of it, despite warnings that it was going to be a very slow movie.  I was writing my doctoral thesis and felt for Helen Hunt's character Kelly who was in the process of finishing her Ph.D. studies.  So the ending broke my heart to know that she had pretty much ditched her academic plans down through the tragedy and confusion of it all (I got my degree, fortunately).  Years later, scenes of Tom Hank's character Chuck's frenetic career, the plane crash, and the 4-year existence as an isolated man who could speak to no one but himself, his fiance in his imagination, and his friend Wilson stuck with me.  But nothing like the heart-rending last part of the movie that was anticlimactic at best, especially when Kelly chases after Chuck outside the driveway in the rain.  Thirteen years later, I buy a secondhand DVD, and I am amazed how powerful those scenes are: the near-reunion at the FedEx terminal, the reunion of mixed and conflicting emotions at Kelly's house, now also inhabited by her new husband and young daughter, and Chuck's emotional conversation with his work colleague and friend.  These scenes are powerful evocations of the complexity of human thought and emotion: dealing with a reunion that is awkward, confusing, and undefinable.  The director and the actors Hanks and Hunt were brilliant in putting it together.  I have seen the last series of scenes about four times since I got the DVD yesterday, and man, they speak for the entire movie!  Tom Hanks might have had too high of a profile in the 80s to 2000s, but especially in the 90s, but he is such a very good actor.  So is Helen Hunt, as proven in her latest movie ""The Sessions"".

Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.As probably everybody knows, this is the story of a guy who finds himself stranded on a small, uninhabited island, far from everything - and who has to somehow survive, pending the arrival of possible rescue. The guy's name is Chuck (Tom Hanks) and at the beginning of the film he is a kind of annoying although mostly harmless jerk. I will say no more about the plot here.This is a long (143mn) and rather slow film but, surprise surprise - I didn't really feel all that time passing. And I felt that I had mostly good time when watching it. The story is rather believable, the ordeal lived by the hero has a kind of realistic touch in it and with time I started to care about Chuck - and even more surprisingly, about Wilson... No, I am not saying here who is Wilson - if you don't know it yet, don't look it up on the web, watch the film and find out by yourself.The last 20 minutes are particularly strong and, well, yes - beautiful even, to a certain extent in a ""Forrest Gump""-like bittersweet way. There is some humour, but not TOO much - on another hand there is emotion, by moments even a lot of it...Some lessons in survival can be learned from ""Cast Away"", including that you do not really need to have balls to survive for years on a desert island - but it helps to have at least one...))) Also, it is quite logical that the way out of a tight spot goes through an outhouse...))) Finally, a precious warning - even if you are oficially dead, never trust your dentist...)))This is essentially a ""one man show"" and Tom Hanks is excellent in this film, which seems like his swan song, because to my considerable regret I do not think I liked him in ANYTHING else since 2000 - and I especially hated such his films like ""Terminal"" and ""Ladykillers"" (I didn't see ""Da Vinci code"" and I do not intend to...)So bottom line, I found this film surprisingly good, I had good time watching it and I sincerely recommend to see it.

534820,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,B00003CXRP,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[2, 4]","I admire Tom Hanks as an actor because he doesn't always play the conventional roles, and is willing to go the extra mile to try out different things.  Here he is, playing another role, in which, for most of the picture, he has to play to the camera by himself, as he is stranded on an island by himself.  Is he up to the challenge?  I think he was and his performance is mostly what saves this picture.I've talked to some people who thought the movie was boring, that there wasn't enough going on, and they found the island scenes boring.  Too much quiet, there's not even any music playing or anything, I've heard them complain.  I don't really know what they expected from a movie about a man who is stranded on an island, with no sign of life except for trees all around him.  Since when did we become so dependent on music in movies telling us how we should feel, or feel the need for eye candy popping out every minute to enjoy ourselves at a movie.  The basic idea is for us to feel as Tom Hanks' character does, stranded, and alone.  To empathize with him, and even feel a sense of pity for him as he rambles around at the beginning, desperately calling for someone, anyone, who might hear him.  For myself, I could have done with more of the island scenes, and less of some of the other scenes.In particular, I would have liked to have seen some of the scenes in between the time he learns to make a fire without matches, and the four years later blurb.  It would have been interesting, at least I think so, to have seen him to start to become proficient at catching fish, and learning how to live on his own.  But of course, that was also the time that he begins losing weight, subsiding on a mostly fish and coconut diet.  So, I guess they really didn't want to show us too much because Tom Hanks was actually working on losing weight himself so we could see the difference in him during that four year span.Some people also felt that he was losing his grip by painting a face on a volleyball, and talking to it.  On the contrary, I felt that by doing this, he was trying to preserve his sanity.  Here was a man who was constantly on the go, always dealing with people, and now he's by himself, without a soul to talk to.  The solitude would have driven him crazy in no time if he hadn't found an outlet, and Wilson, which he named the volleyball, was that outlet.  Watch the scene where he throws Wilson away, and then his near desperation in going out to retrieve it, scared to be by himself again, and needing that outlet to remain sane.The end parts of the movie are the weakest ones, especially the poorly done falsely feeling uplifting moment that seems to have been tacked onto the movie at the last moment to keep people from feeling too depressed for Tom Hanks.

534822,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B00003CXRP,Martin Asiner,"[1, 1]","The job that one has makes it likely that one will develop a personality that is a function of that job.  In Robert Zemeckis' CAST AWAY, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) plays a FedEx executive whose life revolves around the clock.  If a package is late for delivery, someone under his command will catch hell.  For him, time is a precious commodity, and can be measured by the units of the clock, not by the ticks of the heart.  This is his life, and he and his fiancee, played briefly by Helen Hunt, do not seem unhappy with that.  His life changes and not just because he is cut off from the world for five years as he is marooned on a tropical island after a plane crash.  Most critics who comment on the movie point out that CAST AWAY is really an allegory of man's struggle for survival in an inhospitable environment against long odds.  Now certainly there is that subtext, but if that is the major point of the film, then why bother to have the first part where he is time driven or the last part where he seeks to re-establish emotional roots that were uprooted years before?  I see a different message: people are a function of their environment, which shapes their behavior, their food, their entertainment, their relations, or even their self-image.  This shaping imprints itself strongly with time, and a change of environment does not result in an immediate change within. The body and the soul need time to 'catch up.'  For Chuck Noland, his years on the island served to whittle away his outer shell of a clock-based life.  Slowly, he learns to eat, to swim, to care for his teeth in a rhythm dictated by the stars overhead, not by the watch that he misses more than all else.  When he miraculously reappears in his former life, he has to reset his internal clock once again.  The scene in which he plays with a match in his hotel room, lighting it effortlessly, producing a flame that he could not on his island, point out that though he is now in a hotel room, his mind has not yet made the temporal leap from the island.  It may take years for him to readjust himself, as the concluding scene with the pretty girl with the truck indicates. But he might, and this lesson in the slow acceptance of how changes in life cause changes in behavior resonate more powerfully than merely pondering the survival techniques of the latest Robinson Crusoe.",4,Cast Away: With Emotions--Not So Easy to Do,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,2354,"['job', 'one', 'likely', 'one', 'will', 'develop', 'personality', 'function', 'job', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'CAST', 'AWAY', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'FedEx', 'executive', 'life', 'clock', 'package', 'late', 'delivery', 'someone', 'command', 'will', 'catch', 'hell', 'time', 'precious', 'commodity', 'can', 'be', 'measured', 'units', 'clock', 'not', 'ticks', 'heart', 'life', 'fiancee', 'played', 'briefly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'unhappy', 'life', 'changes', 'not', 'just', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'five', 'years', 'marooned', 'tropical', 'island', 'plane', 'crash', 'Most', 'critics', 'who', 'comment', 'movie', 'point', 'out', 'CAST', 'AWAY', 'really', 'allegory', 'man', 'struggle', 'survival', 'inhospitable', 'environment', 'long', 'odds', 'Now', 'certainly', 'subtext', 'major', 'point', 'film', 'then', 'why', 'bother', 'have', 'first', 'part', 'where', 'time', 'driven', 'last', 'part', 'where', 're-establish', 'emotional', 'roots', 'were', 'uprooted', 'years', 'see', 'different', 'message', 'people', 'are', 'function', 'environment', 'shapes', 'behavior', 'food', 'entertainment', 'relations', 'even', 'self-image', 'shaping', 'strongly', 'time', 'change', 'environment', 'not', 'result', 'immediate', 'change', 'body', 'soul', 'need', 'time', ""'catch"", 'up', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'years', 'island', 'served', 'whittle', 'away', 'outer', 'shell', 'clock-based', 'life', 'Slowly', 'eat', 'swim', 'care', 'teeth', 'rhythm', 'dictated', 'stars', 'overhead', 'not', 'watch', 'more', 'else', 'When', 'miraculously', 'former', 'life', 'reset', 'internal', 'clock', 'once', 'again', 'scene', 'match', 'hotel', 'room', 'lighting', 'effortlessly', 'producing', 'flame', 'could', 'not', 'island', 'point', 'out', 'now', 'hotel', 'room', 'mind', 'not', 'yet', 'made', 'temporal', 'leap', 'island', 'may', 'take', 'years', 'readjust', 'concluding', 'scene', 'pretty', 'girl', 'truck', 'might', 'lesson', 'slow', 'acceptance', 'how', 'changes', 'life', 'cause', 'changes', 'behavior', 'resonate', 'more', 'powerfully', 'merely', 'pondering', 'survival', 'techniques', 'latest', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe']",N/A

Posing this question will undoubtedly offer no easy answers, which for a film like Cast Away is probably a good thing. Cast Away begins with Fed Ex Executive Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks in another stellar performance) explaining to his employee's that quote ""We live by the clock"". It's Christmas Eve and Chuck is enjoying a good meal with family and friends when his beeper rings and he finds himself forced to go out on a quick job. He tells his beautiful girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) that he will be home in time for new years celebrations. He promises. However a tragic plane crash into the ocean (which is very thrilling and realistic) changes all that. Now Chuck will no longer be living by the clock because he's now got all the time in the world. A trailer that gives away the entire movie ruined cast Away for many people. A spokes man for 20th Century Fox Entertainment said that Cast Away is movie about a man lost at sea and how he deals with coming home to world of change. Frankly I do not see it that way. I am a firm believer that people want to be surprised when they go to the movies. The only other quibble I have about the movie is the ending from which I think we the viewers are left with too many questions. Besides those problems I walked out of the theatre feeling really satisfied with what I had seen. The acting is top flight. The cinematography is excellent and the score is also a plus. One thing to mention to people is that there isn't allot of dialogue in the movie which may turn some people off. However, those people not too fussy may find this film truly riveting.

534830,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXRP,Matthew Horner,"[2, 4]","Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks.This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning.The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island.

534831,A2PAHQDFIKWA3S,B00003CXRP,"Matthew Perri, also...","[2, 2]","Picture a young school-kid who has made a model of Camelot using wood and styrofoam. Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his work into his history class for the eventual top grade. Now watch as fate intervenes as the child trips on an uneven curb, sending his model crashing to the ground. The child cries and sobs...and then looks up to see the model is still VERY much intact. The only thing the child DIDN'T super-glue to death were the little action-figurines used to portray the inhabitants of Camelot...and a tip of Arthur's tower is slightly smashed.It's fixable...but why go to the trouble when 99 percent of the project is very much okay and ready to present and will knock the socks off of all the other kids who used a simple shoebox to present the Round Table room???This is the case for director Robert Zemeckis. Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch. And it's because of beautiful special effects a very real(and VERY Oscar-worthy) performance by the ever-dynamic Tom Hanks, and a(mostly) smart script.CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland(Hanks), a systems-engineer for the FedEx company(methinks FedEx had to be paid a TON to both sponsor the film and portray one of their delivery jets crashing and losing thousands of packages). He's obssessed with time and things going the way they're supposed to. His marriage is what it is: Chuck and his wife Kelly(the overrated Helen Hunt in an underrated performance) see each other in short bursts but are very happy with the agreement they have and actually SMILE at each other during their day-to-day meetings.Then comes Christmas Eve and Chuck's leaving his wife again. He's off to personally escort a few packages(God knows WHY he has to do this but the script demands it for plot-movement) to their destinations by Christmas Day. This scene comes complete with ill-fated dialogue and the totally clich&eacute;d, &quot;I'll be right back&quot;, spoken to Kelly(or yelled-to to be more accurate) by the equally ill-fated Chuck. I remember actually yelling at my T.V. set that you NEVER say that in a movie(see &quot;Scream&quot; and you'll know why) but what the heck do I know???Once aboard, the pilots decide to avert a major storm by flying AROUND it...so much for THAT idea. The plane crashes into the South Pacific faster than a Randy Johnson-fastball and Chuck is outcast via a raft from said plane to a deserted island with no technology, no islanders, no Jurassic Park dinosaurs, and NO WAY TO GET HOME.From here on, we get to watch Noland stumble around the island trying to obtain food, water, and shelter as well as an idea for how he's going to get off the island and get back to his life...all of which takes four years.Now, before the nay-sayers comment that &quot;this could have been really good&quot; and call it BAD, I say that this could have been really BAD and I'm calling it good. It's actor Hanks and director Zemeckis's time and patience that pulls off the impossible(in their first re-teaming since &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;). Noland turns desparate as you see him go through the stages of becoming a survivor(fear, anger, acceptance, etc.), befriend a volleyball(which he paints a face on with his own blood and even goes so far as to implant &quot;hair&quot; using twigs and what-not), create fire(in a hilariously bittersweet scene), and spear fish and crab for edible goods.I've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle. I think this movie is successful. Robert Zemeckis makes a film that touches you not so much on an emotional level(not even the stupid volleyball evoked a sniffle when we witness its fate), but on a philosophical level. Before Hanks hits the island, he's a hurried man who rushes everything and yells at the top of his lungs. After the island, he's transformed into something humbled. You would think he would have trouble accepting his new life after he gets back home...but by now, it's so easy to him. Chuck has survived the hell of isolation and pain by himself. He makes his decisions without sadness, without angst, and with much acceptance. It's the primitive equivilant of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.Yes, the film's point is EXTREMELY heavy-handed: &quot;time is important so make the most of it&quot; and blah, blah, blah...but Zemeckis has such a wonderful way of softening the hand that's slapping you in the face(just like he softened it for &quot;Gump&quot; and the soft-spoken &quot;Contact&quot;), that it's easy to take. His use of sound and the decision to use no music score during the island-scenes was the perfect choice. In my opinion, scoring the island-scenes would have dumbed the film down.Not a great film, not a horrible film. &quot;Castaway&quot; is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.(A couple of notes here: the &quot;winking-whale&quot; effect comes off as silly and why doesn't search-and-rescue follow the trail of loose-drifting packages since most seemed to end up on the isle with Chuck???)--Matt",3,Hanks survives; Zemeckis 3 for 3 since &quot;Gump&quot;,992476800,"06 14, 2001",2001,5147,"['Picture',

It is not as good as ""Forrest Gump"" but is a very viewable movie.The story recreates in some measure the experiences of Robinson Crusoe transposed to our times. A plane crash launches suddenly a FedEx executive on a desert island and leaves him all by himself. His options are very few and the abrupt jump from modern civilization to a stone age's environment is a harsh experience to be sure.Chuck Noland, as his famous predecessor, stubbornly fights to survive in that precarious background. Worst of all the debris he is able to collect, are by far, less useful than Robinson's. Still he sticks to life.The last part of the motion picture faces the watcher with a complex and heartbreaking dilemma.It is not an easy task to keep the audience's attention with great part of the action limited to this barren surroundings. Nevertheless Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances, including a physical transformation, which took him more than a year to accomplish.All in all it is a very commendable film for different audiences.

Leaving his fiance (Helen Hunt) and telling her he'll be right back!!! Indeed!! The jet crashes in some remote area killing the few on board with the exception of Hanks!

Hanks soon realises that there is no life on the island and not much food, he does make use of the washed up federal packages, not least making a 4 year friend with a volley ball named Wilson!! And so begins a fight for survival where he learns to catch fish make fires and even get a septic tooth out!!Hank's performance definatley keeps the film going, and while there is hardly any musical score in the film its still entertaining stuff throughout. You can actually see in his face the will to survive, kept going by a pocket sized picture of his girl!!

534843,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00003CXRP,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","With CAST AWAY, I think Tom Hanks reached a pinnacle of perfection in his role as Chuck Noland, the FedEx exec who gets stranded on a remote Pacific island.  Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.  The performance is a brave one; Hanks had to undergo a considerable physical transformation and took a whole year to do that.  Working again with his Gump director Robert Zemeckis, Hanks is required to work solo for about an hour of the movie, with very little dialogue.  It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.  Wilson the Volleyball is a wonderful addition as Tom's only ""companion"" on the island and when Wilson is lost at sea, Hanks' remorse is nearly devastating to him and the viewer.  The movie's third section is a little depressing in that Hanks' life has changed so much and his loss once again of Kelly (a sturdy but underused Helen Hunt) is heartbreaking.  The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.  Hanks should have won the Oscar for Cast Away, losing it to an over-rated Russell Crowe.

Howe,"[13, 15]","Ok, may'be the title is a little overstated, but out of almost every movie that I heard of this winter, I was looking forward to this one.  Since I was 5, Robert Zemeckis has been one of my favorite directors, and Hanks has been steadily gaining on my popularity chart.  This film will really put his acting skills to the benefit of all.Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland (break down that last name for the joke), a FedEx employee who demands precision and on the clock time delivery.  Anything less to Chuck, and FedEx becomes the US Postal service.  Even through all this, Chuck still tries to maintai his relationship with his Memphis, Tennessee girlfriend Kellie (Helen Hunt).  Chuck completes his latest route, and just when it seems like Christmas and New Years will be a time of peace, Chuck is called in to supervise a flight to Asia.  However, once over the Pacific, turbulance and more trouble causes a terrifying plane crash, of which Chuck soon finds himself &quot;cast away&quot; on an island.  This wouldn't sound so bad, except that the waves coming in prevent Chuck from escaping, and there is no sign of life.Once on the island, Hanks gives us an incredible role, playing Chuck almost entirely through pantomime and body movement.  Chuck does not feel the need to talk only if it is important.  In other words, he is not the possibly gung ho survivor.  Once realizing his fate, Chuck finds several FedEx packages washed up.  Inside them he finds several items he uses to stay alive.  To keep his sanity through loneliness, he takes a Volleyball, smears itn with blood fro a wound of his, and names it &quot;Wilson.&quot;  The interaction between Hanks and Wilson is great, with Hanks talking AND responding to Wilson.Robert Zemeckis keeps the camera on Hanks form teh minute the doors blow open on the plane, all through the island.

This movie succeeds in every way.  Too many movies anymore are big budgets and not much else.  We have such short attention spans that unless there is a friggin' explosion every 10 minutes we can't sit through it.  This movie is for people that love good stories, that can sit through a slow-moving, methodical movie.  Do NOT rent/buy this if  you want some action-packed edge of your seat thriller.  It's not that kind of movie.  The thought of being stranded like Tom is so overwhelmingly depressing, yet there are moments where I couldn't stop laughing.  It's an emotional journey from start to finish.  The ending rips my heart out every time I see it.  To think he survived from the inspiration of his girlfriend only to get back home to find that she has moved on is so sad it brings me to tears every time.  A great movie and one that I always watch at least some of when I see it on TV.  And for those of you who don't ""get"" the ending.  His life was all about structure and schedules before he was stranded.  After he gets back and finds that the one thing he lived for is gone, he has to find a new direction-hence the standing at a crossroads at the end thinking about where to go next.

534850,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00003CXRP,Mike Freed,"[3, 4]","&quot;Cast Away&quot; is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so-so film. In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy.Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express employee who's obsessed with time. We inhabit Noland's go-go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time - no mean feat with Russians.We meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).All of this changes when Noland hops a Federal Express plane for a business trip to the South Pacific. The flight gets lost, then the plane is forced to ditch in the Pacific. After fighting to escape the burning, sinking plane, and struggling to survive in typhoon-racked seas, Noland finds himself stranded on a deserted, hardscrapple island. He instinctively reaches for his pager...and it's dead.Suddenly, the man who is ruled by the clock has nothing but time. Hanks' transformation from helpless castaway to hardened survivor (and back to a civilized man after he's rescued) is alternately funny, sad, triumphant, and downbeat. He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.The sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of &quot;Cast Away,&quot; and taken alone, they're brilliant. Unfortunately, the bookends of the castaway story - the time before Noland is stranded and after he is rescued - don't even begin to approach the power of the island sequences.For starters, once Noland's rescued, he wants above all to see his old girlfriend; unfortunately, in the intervening years, she has written him off for dead (as she should have), and she's married with kids. Director Robert Zemeckis - no stranger to schmaltzy relationships - toys with the audience briefly by suggesting they might get back together, but the mere idea of it is beyond silly, and thankfully, it's never consummated. The two characters are not the same two people who existed before Nolan was lost, after all.But the mere idea of these two reuniting is so silly to begin with that Zemeckis is foolish for even entertaining it. Better to have cut that one off at the root, and had Noland start his journey of rediscovery. I also wish that Hunt would have been given more of a character to work with; she's basically stuck in a &quot;loving housewife&quot; mode, but we don't know what makes her tick, and I didn't see many sparks between her and Hanks.Like all Zemeckis' movies, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style; after all, how do you do &quot;Back To The Future&quot; camera moves on a desert island? Zemeckis compensates by adding other sensory stimulation - namely, sound - to the largely static camera shots to give us a kinetic sense of place.Overall, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes. It's too bad that these pieces didn't make a better whole.",3,Hanks' performance almost makes this a great movie,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,3302,"['quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'nothing', 'else', 'example', 'how', 'one', 'great', 'performance', 'can', 'almost', 'lift', 'so-so', 'film', 'case', 'great', 'performance', 'turned', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'dandy.Hanks', 'plays', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Federal', 'Express', 'employee', 'who', 'obsessed', 'time', 'inhabit', 'Noland', 'go-go', 'world', 'time', 'starting', 'one', 'terrific', 'sequence', 'trying', 'sell', 'Russians', 'virtues', 'being', 'time', 'mean', 'feat', 'Russians.We', 'meet', 'girlfriend', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'sweet', 'woman', 'who', 'compete', 'Noland', 'job', 'affection', 'conductor', 'pocket', 'watch', 'Christmas', ""'ll"", 'always', 'keep', 'home', 'time', '.All', 'changes', 'when', 'Noland', 'Federal', 'Express', 'plane', 'business', 'trip', 'South', 'Pacific', 'flight', 'lost', 'then', 'plane', 'forced', 'ditch', 'Pacific', 'fighting', 'escape', 'burning', 'sinking', 'plane', 'struggling', 'survive', 'typhoon-racked', 'seas', 'Noland', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'hardscrapple', 'island', 'instinctively', 'pager', 'dead.Suddenly', 'man', 'who', 'ruled', 'clock', 'nothing', 'time', 'Hanks', 'transformation', 'helpless', 'castaway', 'hardened', 'survivor', 'back', 'civilized', 'man', 'rescued', 'alternately', 'funny', 'sad', 'triumphant', 'downbeat', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'facial', 'expression', 'body', 'movement', 'most', 'actors', 'can', 'brilliant', 'dialogue.The', 'sequences', 'Hanks', 'survive', 'desert', 'island', 'are', 'far', 'strongest', 'pieces', 'quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'taken', 'alone', ""'re"", 'brilliant', 'Unfortunately', 'bookends', 'castaway', 'story', 'time', 'Noland', 'stranded', 'rescued', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'approach', 'power', 'island', 'sequences.For', 'starters', 'once', 'Noland', 'rescued', 'see', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'unfortunately', 'intervening', 'years', 'written', 'off', 'dead', 'should', 'have', 'married', 'kids', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'stranger', 'schmaltzy', 'relationships', 'toys', 'audience', 'briefly', 'suggesting', 'might', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'mere', 'idea', 'silly', 'thankfully', 'never', 'consummated', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'existed', 'Nolan', 'was', 'lost', 'mere', 'idea', 'two', 'reuniting', 'so', 'silly', 'begin', 'Zemeckis', 'foolish', 'even', 'entertaining', 'Better', 'have', 'cut', 'one', 'off', 'root', 'had', 'Noland', 'start', 'journey', 'rediscovery', 'also', 'wish', 'Hunt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'character', 'work', 'basically', 'stuck', 'quot', 'loving', 'housewife', 'quot', 'mode', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tick', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'sparks', 'Hanks.Like', 'Zemeckis', 'movies', 'quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'technically', 'brilliant', 'island', 'sequences', 'challenge', 'Zemeckis', 'usual', 'hyperactive', 'visual', 'style', 'how', 'do', 'do', 'quot', 'Back', 'Future', 'quot', 'camera', 'desert', 'island', 'Zemeckis', 'compensates', 'adding', 'other', 'sensory', 'stimulation', 'namely', 'sound', 'largely', 'static', 'camera', 'shots', 'give', 'kinetic', 'sense', 'place.Overall', 'quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'very', 'much', 'seeing', 'nothing', 'else', 'Hanks', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'raw', 'power', 'desert', 'island', 'scenes', 'too', 'bad', 'pieces', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'better', 'whole']",N/A

When I walked out of the theater I was like &quot;What was in the package&quot; and &quot;That was weak&quot;. The first statement is a silly and unecessary question, the latter is just an outright lie, now. The one thing I took away from that first viewing was the unique plot device that was Wilson. My fascination with this came a while later. On a happenstance the MTV movie awards paired a clip with a snippet of Green Day's &quot;Castaway&quot;. Now mentioning Green Day won't get you instant acceptance in my book, but it will get you a second chance. So, I watched it again, and again, and again. A certain premium movie channel was very helpful in that respect. In brief, it is enough to say that I fell in love with it. The relationship with Wilson is simply brilliant. In addition, there is something real about this movie. Tom doesn't end up making a palace of reeds or getting back with Helen Hunt once he returns. No, he survives using his senses and items from the downed plane. This movie is a great lesson in overcoming functional fixedness! But another pivotal thing is the fact that he does not renew his relationship once he returns. Instead of idealizing the situation and having him have a fairy-tale reunion, he must deal with the very real fact that she has moved on. A thoroughly realistic storyline and a unique view into the human psyche under immense stress make this a truely original and moving movie.",5,Sweeping and Moving,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,1561,"['one', 'top', 'ten', 'favorite', 'movies', 'interesting', 'note', 'fact', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'hated', 'time', 'When', 'walked', 'theater', 'was', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'package', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'weak', 'quot', 'first', 'statement', 'silly', 'unecessary', 'question', 'latter', 'just', 'outright', 'lie', 'now', 'one', 'thing', 'took', 'away', 'first', 'viewing', 'was', 'unique', 'plot', 'device', 'was', 'Wilson', 'fascination', 'came', 'while', 'later', 'happenstance', 'MTV', 'movie', 'awards', 'paired', 'clip', 'snippet', 'Green', 'Day', 'quot', 'Castaway', 'quot', 'Now', 'mentioning', 'Green', 'Day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'instant', 'acceptance', 'book', 'will', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'So', 'watched', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'certain', 'premium', 'movie', 'channel', 'was', 'very', 'helpful', 'respect', 'brief', 'enough', 'say', 'fell', 'love', 'relationship', 'Wilson', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'addition', 'something', 'real', 'movie', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'making', 'palace', 'reeds', 'getting', 'back', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'once', 'No', 'using', 'senses', 'items', 'downed', 'plane', 'movie', 'great', 'lesson', 'overcoming', 'functional', 'fixedness', 'pivotal', 'thing', 'fact', 'not', 'renew', 'relationship', 'once', 'Instead', 'idealizing', 'situation', 'having', 'have', 'fairy-tale', 'reunion', 'must', 'deal', 'very', 'real', 'fact', 'moved', 'thoroughly', 'realistic', 'storyline', 'unique', 'view', 'human', 'psyche', 'immense', 'stress', 'make', 'truely', 'original', 'moving', 'movie']",N/A

A puzzled look.Four years stranded on an island can leave us with much more than sand in our skin.Four years can change our priorities.The everyday commodities can mean nothing compared to the safety of knowing when we will drink a glass of ice water.The necessity to relate to other people acquires a worthy value when, drowned in the deepest solitude, we start to talk to a volleyball.And those are some of the hard lessons Chuck Noland learns.Cast Away is a rather optimistic vision of how an ordinary man, obsessed with the clock, is forced to let go of the notion of time, physically and emotionally.Tom Hanks is Chuck, a Fedex systems analyst; expert in problem-solving, in connecting people; for him, every minute counts, time is worth everything. A clock is crucial to the success of every taskAnd while his busy agenda keeps him in places like Russia, Asia or Paris, in Memphis his girlfriend Kelly waits for him.One Christmas eve, Chuck has to go away again, leaving Kelly with the words ""I'll be right back"" floating in the air.Life can be full of such ironies.So, instead of coming back, Chuck's plane crashes and leaves him stranded on a desert island for four years.Four years where surviving is the challenge. Learn to fish, to open a coconut, find a shelter, lit a fire, fight nature.And then after overcoming all obstacles, what matters is live. So Chuck starts a rebirthing: talks to a volleyball, which he calls Wilson, and it's a sort of conscience to confide all his fears, frustrations and desires.Finally, all the conditions are given for the survivor to return to civilization.To a world that moved on, where time didn't stop, a world out of sync with Chuck.Cast Away is brilliant showing us how irreversible is the past and how marked we are with our experiences.Director Robert Zemeckis displays Chuck's life changes with a clean and simple technique. Overwhelming and busy at first, slow and full of silences during his isolation, reflexive and enigmatic at the end.Hanks proves his effectiveness carrying the entire movie in his shoulders. Frenetic and exhausting when we meet him, he transmits his busy way of life. And he is equally persuasive and convincing when he goes to that exceptional situation, sympathetic and also worthy of compassion.Chucks' spiritual changes are as obvious as his physical changes. He disconnects from reality and after four years, he loses that spark that shines in our eyes, result from our everyday contact with others.And once his hope to return to his loved ones is given to him, how difficult is to find that you don't fit anymore in that life.

Great concept for a movie, and Tom Hanks was perfectly cast as the cast away.  I doubt that any other actor could have carried the movie - which mostly consists of  just Hanks on the island - so well.  The movie starts with the premise that Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, is a Federal Express executive obsessed with time.  A little obvious but still a nice contrast with his life on the island where time becomes meaningless.  Also, since he's on a Federal Express plane that goes down, several parcels are washed up which provide Chuck with a variety of items he can use try to use in his effort to survive.  By the way, the scenes from the plane crash are particularly well done and seemed very realistic to me (never having been in a plane crash, I can't speak with absolute authority on that).  I can't say enough about how good Hanks' performance was .  Personally, I thought the ending didn't live up to the rest of the movie.

He bonds with a volleyball, &quot;Wilson,&quot; which represents many things: the protagonist's need for a friend, conscience, and is, with its blood-stained face, even a reminder of the protagonist's mortality.So much of the struggle on the island is so universal that people from all over the world could follow the sequences without the aid of subtitles. Primitive and biblical themes are wonderfully developed: the making of fire, the arduous learning process of trial and error, the ecstasy of tasting food as if for the first time.During the protagonist's struggles he learns to grieve and to find a cathartic way to unleash all his pent up sorrow, as when he loses his volleyball companion &quot;Wilson,&quot; and in doing so he finds his humanity.So much detail and mythic power informs the island sequences that it is a frustrating disappointment when we arrive at the movie's final act, the protagonist's attempt to patch things up with his girlfriend, who, having thought he had died in a plane crash, has married and borne children. This final act is sloppy, sappy, and arbitrary and seems to have been made by a lesser director.Nevertheless, I still recommend this film for the very compelling island sequences, which highlight Hanks' talents better than I have ever seen.",4,Hanks is great but sloppy ending,1010361600,"01 7, 2002",2002,1460,"['so', 'much', 'praise', 'movie', 'modern', 'ambitious', 'man', 'who', 'isolated', 'hostile', 'island', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'find', 'hidden', 'depths', 'humanity', 'bonds', 'volleyball', 'quot', 'Wilson', 'quot', 'many', 'things', 'protagonist', 'need', 'friend', 'conscience', 'blood-stained', 'face', 'even', 'reminder', 'protagonist', 'mortality.So', 'much', 'struggle', 'island', 'so', 'universal', 'people', 'world', 'could', 'follow', 'sequences', 'aid', 'subtitles', 'Primitive', 'biblical', 'themes', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'developed', 'making', 'fire', 'arduous', 'learning', 'process', 'trial', 'error', 'ecstasy', 'tasting', 'food', 'first', 'time.During', 'protagonist', 'struggles', 'grieve', 'find', 'cathartic', 'way', 'unleash', 'pent', 'up', 'sorrow', 'when', 'volleyball', 'companion', 'quot', 'Wilson', 'quot', 'doing', 'so', 'humanity.So', 'much', 'detail', 'mythic', 'power', 'island', 'frustrating', 'disappointment', 'when', 'arrive', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'protagonist', 'attempt', 'patch', 'things', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'having', 'thought', 'had', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'married', 'borne', 'children', 'final', 'act', 'sloppy', 'sappy', 'arbitrary', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'lesser', 'director.Nevertheless', 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'very', 'compelling', 'island', 'sequences', 'highlight', 'Hanks', 'talents', 'better', 'have', 'ever', 'seen']",N/A

His films have been critically acclaimed as well as hugely successful, ranging from modest (That Thing You Do! &amp; The Green Mile) to Box Office Kings (Forrest Gump &amp; Saving Private Ryan).  How does he do it?Well with Cast Away, Mr. King Midas strikes Gold again, with a simple tale of a man who crash lands on an island and must survive it's hardships for four years.  Sounds simple, huh?  And you might think a movie, even with Hanks in it, about one person on an island for most of the time may seem boring.  Not a chance.  Cast Away breaks down the human being in us all and lets us discover who we truly are inside, by watching Chuck Noland (NO LAND) discover for himself what it takes to sustain his own life and well being.  The love for a woman he left behind, that he looks at with a picture in a pocket watch she gave him when last they were together.  There are layers and layers of depth to this piece that is so compelling, if you're not emotional by the end, check yourself for a pulse.Those that love this film have already fallen in love with Wilson, a vollyball with a bloodpainted face, drawn by Chuck, to have as a companion.  Sounds nuts, you say?  Try being alone for four years and see how long it takes you to make up a friend to talk to.  Wilson represents Chuck's hopes and determination in himself.  He needs Wilson to be there.  I have never gottan more choked up over a vollyball in my entire life, but when you watch that one scene on the raft, well, your heart just breaks...and I know it's crazy because Wilson is not a real person...or is he?Anyone who scoffs at the ending are really too busy to take the time to get the point of what Cast Away is all about.  I am so tired of these cute little endings where the guy gets the girl in the end, when in reality, we all know it doesn't always work out that way.  But you take from Cast Away what you bring to it, and that's what the ending is about.  Which direction to take now?  Not sure.  But at least &quot;Tomorrow the sun will rise&quot;.The DVD extras are FANTASTIC.  So many featurettes that don't feel like featurettes..they feel like short documentaries..and there's even one all about Wilson!  But my favorite is the Charlie Rose interview with Hanks, who is such a delight..it's truly a great interview.  I really wish he could've participated in the audio commentary, but he's so busy.  One mistake I noticed..the details on the back of the case state that Cast Away is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which is incorrect..it's only 1.85:1.  But with tons of trailers and interviews and featurettes, it really makes little difference to me.Grab this movie on DVD, and get ready for an experience you'll never forget.  And Mr. Hanks?

Whilst Zemeckis touched his audience with 'Forrest Gump' and scared them all with 'What Lies Beneath', this is a film that seems to have been released purely to show us all Tom Hanks' formidable acting skills.  In the film Hanks plays Chuck, who is separated from his wife after his plane crashes and he, the only survivor, is forced to eke out an existence on a tropical island for four years, forging a friendship with a ball called Wilson.Whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.  We see Chuck light a fire, smash a coconut and fish.  This makes up the majority of the movie, with themes such as madness being explained away with a frankly bizarre 'friendship' with a ball.  In this lies the movie's main failure - it's not particularly bad but it is particularly dull.  Devoid of any other characters - save Helen Hunt as his wife in a role so minimal it even rivals Laura Dern's in 'Jurassic Park III' - we're forced to concentrate on the same things over and over.Still, the airplane crash is stunningly done and the ending is thankfully a little less contemporary than would be expected.

Over the span of four years Chuck is on the island, until he devises a plan to get off of the island and return home.  The drama between Chuck and his lone &quot;companion&quot;, a volleyball he calls Wilson, is heartbreaking when he loses him at sea.

The filmmakers said that ""Cast Away"" was filmed in some parts of Memphis, TN, mostly at the FedEx complex, etc. This is pretty much the fourth film to be filmed in Memphis (the first three were John Grisham films based on his novels: ""The Firm"", ""The Client"", and ""The Rainmaker""). The film focuses on a FedEx systems engineer named Chuck Noland (Hanks), who is obsessed with his job in which he comments: ""we live and we die by time"". Chuck has a beautiful life with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). When Chuck gets an unexpected call on his pager, he decides to take it. But after Chuck steps inside the airplane, it has engine trouble and crashes in the ocean. Chuck manages to survive the outcome of it and gets washed away to an island nearby. There he spends 4 years of his life fighting insanity by talking to a volleyball, in which he named ""Wilson"", and how he still manages to survive and figure out a way back home. Robert Zemeckis (""What Lies Beneath"") directed this movie with lots of emotion and powerful storytelling as well. I purchased ""Cast Away"" in its 2-DVD set with lots of extras including behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, TV spots, commentaries, and more. But now, Fox Home Entertainment has re-released ""Cast Away"" again, this time as a one-disc treatment. And this time, you do not get all those extra goodies that are inside the 2-disc set, except for just commentaries, scene selection, and that's it. And, to me, that is just a cheap representation of the real thing (the 2-disc set). In other words, it's not good. But, all in all, this is Tom Hanks' best film since ""Philadelphia"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Green Mile"".

Furthermore, he makes every reaction to his situation seem believable. You do not get the sense of a star trip here. You are made to feel being there with him on that desert isle, terrified for him, rooting for him, and feeling his forlorn sorrow and loneliness. His effortless way of reaching out - without trying to - is often deeply moving. Hanks' enactment of the character's metamorphosis is stunningly worked out, yet uncalculating, organic. The one sly factor in Hanks' persona is his subtle, yet absolutely uproarious sense of humor: he indicates certain touches, ways of registering a situation with such deft irony you're laughing along with your tears. Few actors are more spontaneously skilled than Hanks in registering a human emotion that everyone can relate to. The greatest gift an actor can have is the ability to make the audience feel, understand and react to, the character's emotions; and only an actor who is real, and genuine and borne of an inborn simplicity of truth can really hope to reach audiences on such a universal level.

Hanks committment and sacrifice (The weight loss) for this role should be commended.  (I'm still waiting for the heavy-set dude from Lost to lose weight).  I doubt I would have been able to survive four days let alone four plus years.  The bonding with the volleyball was sad yet totally understandable.

But then when we return to civilization, Chuck is still an island unto himself.  The insensativity of catering seafood as a welcome home party was both amusing and sad.  Kelly unable to see him because it was too emotionally hard had to be one of the most selfish acts I've ever seen.  YOU had it hard?  At that point I didn't want him to reunite with her.  Sure, you've moved on and have a family now-you can explain all that but you at least show up.  I'm not complaining, these things all help you to continuely feel for our hero.  The speech Chuck gave to the theapist about keep breathing sort of reminded me of the same speech from Sleepless in Seattle.  About getting up every morning and breathing in and out.  I swear it's eerily similar.  That last bit of hope at the end of the movie, when he returns the one Fed-ex package confused me.  Because in the begining of the movie wasn't that lady married?

The story and performance transcend the need for constant dialog3. This is a gripping tale of survivalI also think such observations miss the point of the film entirely.While being literally stranded on an island is ostensibly the main plot of the film, the real intent is to use this as an allegory or metaphor for the immense changes that life often brings.Told in three acts, Cast Away is the story of Chuck Noland (Hanks) a man entirely in control of his life (waiting on marriage, dating the right girl, good career, friends, etc.) when he is unexpectedly stranded. After years of waiting he is rescued by an angel's wings in the form a port-a-john wall. When he returns he finds everything he knew has changed.How many of us have undergone similar transitions in life? Times when we seem to plateau or enter a dark tunnel and wonder if we will ever come out at the end. And when we do finally emerge we find we have entered a world unlike the one we left. This is the real story of Cast Away.Symbolism is used frequently. His girlfriend on the island is merely a locket picture. The pocket watch he checks so carefully has stopped. Other images or devices are repeated or used for effect (angel wings, fire, Wilson, Chuck's physical changes).Perhaps I give the story too much credit, but I think if you watch it again (or for the first time), you might see a different film than you were expecting. And perhaps you can find some parrallel to a time in your life when you have been Cast Away, only to return to a new and different world.What more can you ask from a Tom Hanks movie?",4,We live and die by the clock,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,1683,"['will', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers:1', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks2', 'story', 'performance', 'transcend', 'need', 'constant', 'dialog3', 'gripping', 'tale', 'survivalI', 'also', 'think', 'such', 'observations', 'miss', 'point', 'film', 'being', 'literally', 'stranded', 'island', 'ostensibly', 'main', 'plot', 'film', 'real', 'intent', 'use', 'allegory', 'metaphor', 'immense', 'changes', 'life', 'often', 'brings.Told', 'three', 'acts', 'Cast', 'Away', 'story', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Hanks', 'man', 'entirely', 'control', 'life', 'waiting', 'marriage', 'dating', 'right', 'girl', 'good', 'career', 'friends', 'etc', 'when', 'unexpectedly', 'stranded', 'years', 'waiting', 'rescued', 'angel', 'wings', 'form', 'port-a-john', 'wall', 'When', 'everything', 'knew', 'changed.How', 'many', 'have', 'undergone', 'similar', 'transitions', 'life', 'Times', 'when', 'seem', 'plateau', 'enter', 'dark', 'tunnel', 'wonder', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'out', 'end', 'when', 'do', 'finally', 'emerge', 'find', 'have', 'entered', 'world', 'one', 'left', 'real', 'story', 'Cast', 'Away.Symbolism', 'used', 'frequently', 'girlfriend', 'island', 'merely', 'locket', 'picture', 'pocket', 'watch', 'so', 'carefully', 'stopped', 'Other', 'images', 'devices', 'are', 'repeated', 'used', 'effect', 'angel', 'wings', 'fire', 'Wilson', 'Chuck', 'physical', 'changes', '.Perhaps', 'give', 'story', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'think', 'watch', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'might', 'see', 'different', 'film', 'were', 'expecting', 'perhaps', 'can', 'find', 'parrallel', 'time', 'life', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'Cast', 'Away', 'only', 'return', 'new', 'different', 'more', 'can', 'ask', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie']",N/A

534898,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00003CXRP,P Magnum,"[6, 7]","Cast Away reteams director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for their first film together since the Award winning Forrest Gump.  The film tells the story of a Federal Express employee, Chuck,  who is stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific.  He is forced to use his wits to survive.  The survival scenes are sandwiched in between Chuck's life in Memphis pre and post island.  The pre-island scenes show Chuck as a time obsessed man, whose main goal is to make certain packages arrive on time.  He shows off his tyrannical devotion to time in the movie's opening scenes where he is training people at a new depot in Moscow.  Back home for Christmas, we meet his girlfriend, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt.  On Christmas day he is called off again and he promises Kelly he'll be home for New Year's Eve and at the airport they exchange gifts.  Kelly gives Chuck a pocket watch and amongst his gifts is an engagement ring.  On this flight, the plane encounters turbulence and goes down.  The crash is a fiery spectacle that shows off Mr. Zemeckis' skill as a director.  Chuck is the lone survivor and he washes up on the island.  Armed with only a few items (ice skates, videotapes) from Fed Ex packages, he forced to adapt to live on the album.  His lone companion is a volleyball he names Wilson (the ball's maker).  Wilson is really an extension of Chuck himself as his &quot;face&quot; was created a bloody palm print of Chuck's own hand.  It is on the island where we see the acting skills that make Mr. Hanks the best in the business.  Through his struggles to make fire, eat, drink and eventually build a boat to leave the island.  He literally all by himself, with only Wilson to interact with.  Mr. Hanks' draws our sympathy and we share in his frustrations.  We feel his desperation and the scene where he kicks Wilson out of a cave and then desperately searches for him in the dark is utterly heartbreaking.  After four years Chuck leaves the island and is rescued at sea.  Upon his return to Memphis, he finds that he was of course left for dead and even buried.  Kelly has married and has a child.

Hanks does a magnificent job of portraying hopelessness and the longing that kept the character alive and eventually brought him back to civilization.There have been several comments on the &quot;drawn out&quot; scenes in this movie and I have to believe that it is our societies obsession with special effects and action that have allowed this movie to slip through the cracks as one of the better movies ever made.The most compelling parts of the movie were dealing with the character's drive to survive on the island. The fact that Zemekis spent so much of the movie on the island was ingenious! What kind of movie would this have been if 4 years on an island converted to only 30 minutes of screen time? The time spent on the island gave the movie a feeling of authenticity. The real wonder is how the movie keeps you entertained when silence is such a large portion of the movie.

And Helen Hunt was great, too. But from the time Tom Hanks was left on the island really did seem to take forever. And who knows? This film does have a point and could be pretty useful...somebody could get stranded on an island all alone out in the middle of the ocean any day, and wouldn't it be helpful to know how to survive it by seeing this film?

How about escaping to one by yourself? Do you dream of walking on beaches and digging your toes in the sand. Well, don't wish for it if you are on a plane over the ocean. Do you wonder what it would take to survive? Would you go insane being all by yourself or would you enjoy the solitude?While some say this movie was too long and tested their patience level, it is a journey all on its own into the mind of a survivor. Is there an actor out there who can compare to Tom Hanks? I would rather watch Tom Hanks drink coconut milk for hours than to have to endure some of the acting we have to watch in other movies. Tom becomes his character to such an extent I was a bit worried I would forget I was watching Tom Hanks! His transformation from the time-obsessed Fed Ex Chuck No""land"" to the primal ""land""locked survivor blew my mind.At first the movie was slower, then the intensity of Chuck Noland almost scared me. He was obsessed with staying on time and I just wanted to say: ""Buddy, take a vacation."" Well, I guess he did. ;> This movie has all the elements of great storytelling and adventure.First Noland gets thrown into a completely opposite situation that what he is used to. He is no longer in control and must deal with the elements and learn to be one with nature. Not only does Survivor Noland make creative use of the contents of packages that wash up on the beach, he has to decide he is going to live to see his girlfriend (Helen Hunt, who was perfect for the role). Hope, creativity, perseverance and basic survival instincts keep him alive.Chuck is a man who can't sit still for 10 minutes and now he has to make friends with years of solitude and a volleyball (very funny look on his face when he is trying to create fire and the volleyball is hanging out watching him). Did I get bored? No way....although, I kept thinking a shark was going to appear at some point. The spear fishing was pretty cool especially when he is out fishing from his raft in the open water. Tom does some hilarious things. I was laughing out loud so many times during the ""silent"" times. Really, he does talk during the times everyone says he is so silent, it is just a monologue and not dialogue. You almost feel you are on the island yourself. I became that absorbed at some points. He makes very creative use out of ice skates (axe) and a dress (fishing net). There are subtle messages throughout the movie I was picking up on. Like when he takes off his watch right before the plane crashes. It is symbolic of him leaving his hurried world.This was a very thoughtful movie. You get to imagine what Tom is thinking and also when you watch it at home, you can talk about various aspects, like...what would you do? The aspect of ""character"" was very prevalent. If you watched this movie in the theatres, you might have missed out on a great movie experience. I say this because half the fun of this movie is talking about it while you are watching it. Normally it is like pulling teeth to get my husband to watch a movie with me at home and I can rarely get him to take me to a movie. Most of the time it is because of a lack of selection and movie content we are not interested in. This was different.Not only does this movie have romance (for me), it had great ""real man"" adventure for him. There are parts in this movie that will just make you laugh out loud. It is our 6th anniversary and my husband actually watched this entire movie with me. We were totally intrigued, discussed all sorts of things as the movie progressed and really had a great time watching this movie. You will not be casting away any time watching this movie. You will be giving yourself the gift of escape.The ending encourages you to use your imagination, but everyone can guess what will happen.

I'm a big fan of the movie and give the movie itself 5 stars but am only reviewing the quality of this release here. The opening sequence where the FedEx truck drives up and picks up the package for delivery to Russia looks only slightly better than the standard DVD. When the truck opens up and the Russia scene starts it looks a lot better, but still more like 720p quality. Through the rest of the movie the HD quality stays about the same, decent but not great. It's certainly a step up from DVD but there are a few scenes that seem to be no better than my 2 disc DVD edition. The best looking scenes are the closeup scenes where the HD quality becomes more apparent but it still doesn't look anywhere near as good as other HD titles I own. Some of the best looking HD titles I own are: The Matrix collection, 2001, The Fifth Element, Apollo 13, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Pirates of the Caribbean, and number of others.While watching the movie and examining the quality I came to the thought that it might not be the transfer that's the issue but possibly it was the director of photography's filming. It looks like the DP tried hard to keep a balance of focus between the actor and the background thereby not getting a truly sharp focus. I could be wrong but this is what it looked like. The 5.1 surround sound was fantastic. I didn't notice any difference between my DVD and Blu-ray versions, though I do admit I really didn't examine the audio.Overall the movie was nice but I was let down as I was expecting better, especially from a movie with such a great environment. If you own the 2 disc DVD keep in mind the 2 disc set has all those extras and this hi-def release does not. So you may want to hold onto your set. Don't go getting Cast Away expecting the same HD quality you see in all those top notch movies that people use to showcase the format. It still looks great and certainly better than DVD just not leaps and bounds better for most of the scenes. Again, I can't say for sure but it may simply have been the way it was filmed.Viewed on:Sony PS3 (latest update)Samsung LN-T5265F 52"" LCD 1080P (calibrated)Toshiba 5.1 surround sound system",3,Blu-ray version review,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,2381,"['own', 'movies', 'HD', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'formats', 'so', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'many', 'HD', 'movies', 'am', 'well', 'familiar', 'formats', 'capabilities.Being', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Cast', 'Away', 'release', 'Hi-Def', 'got', 'very', 'excited', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'movie', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'only', 'reviewing', 'quality', 'release', 'here', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'FedEx', 'truck', 'up', 'up', 'package', 'delivery', 'Russia', 'only', 'slightly', 'better', 'standard', 'DVD', 'When', 'truck', 'up', 'Russia', 'scene', 'lot', 'better', 'still', 'more', '720p', 'quality', 'rest', 'movie', 'HD', 'quality', 'same', 'decent', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'step', 'up', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'no', 'better', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'edition', 'best', 'looking', 'scenes', 'are', 'closeup', 'scenes', 'where', 'HD', 'quality', 'more', 'apparent', 'still', ""n't"", 'look', 'anywhere', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'HD', 'titles', 'own', 'best', 'looking', 'HD', 'titles', 'own', 'are', 'Matrix', 'collection', '2001', 'Fifth', 'Element', 'Apollo', '13', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'number', 'others.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'examining', 'quality', 'came', 'thought', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'transfer', 'issue', 'possibly', 'was', 'director', 'photography', 'filming', 'DP', 'tried', 'hard', 'keep', 'balance', 'focus', 'actor', 'background', 'thereby', 'not', 'getting', 'truly', 'sharp', 'focus', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'what', 'looked', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'was', 'fantastic', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'difference', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'versions', 'do', 'admit', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'examine', 'audio.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'was', 'expecting', 'better', 'especially', 'movie', 'such', 'great', 'environment', 'own', '2', 'disc', 'DVD', 'keep', 'mind', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'extras', 'hi-def', 'release', 'not', 'may', 'want', 'hold', 'set', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'getting', 'Cast', 'Away', 'expecting', 'same', 'HD', 'quality', 'see', 'top', 'notch', 'movies', 'people', 'use', 'showcase', 'format', 'still', 'great', 'certainly', 'better', 'DVD', 'just', 'not', 'leaps', 'better', 'most', 'scenes', 'Again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'may', 'simply', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'was', 'filmed.Viewed', 'Sony', 'PS3', 'latest', 'update', 'Samsung', 'LN-T5265F', '52', 'LCD', '1080P', 'calibrated', 'Toshiba', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'system']",N/A

534912,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXRP,Reviewer,"[8, 11]","We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis, and the ""Fast Food Generation"" is in charge; everything has to be done yesterday, and there's literally not enough hours in a day to do what ""must"" be done.  In ""Cast Away,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it-- seemingly at random-- and given something new to ponder:  Life.  Life, in it's most basic and primitive form; where all he has for survival are his two hands, his wits, and whatever nature, in all her glory, can provide.  Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a supervisor for Fed-Ex who lives and dies by the clock; a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute.  On Christmas, he exchanges gifts with his intended, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city, another country.  But this time, somewhere over the ocean, elemental forces take charge, his plane is forced to ditch in the sea, and Noland's life-- in a few seconds-- is changed forever.  He survives, only to be washed ashore on a small, uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere, where he must confront Time-- and himself-- as never before.  Though comparisons to ""Robinson Crusoe"" may spring to mind immediately, tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory, because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that.  You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill-fated flight, that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is, what makes him tick, and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both.  And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival; it's an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way-- with the core of his existence, the clock, negated-- what it is that really matters in life.  Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that, indeed, no man is an island; for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide:  Companionship.  Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland; if there is any doubt, consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag.  Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation; that something is just around the corner, about to happen.  The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place; understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day:  The simple creature comforts; a book of matches; water; having someone to share a laugh with.  And most importantly, knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite.  A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe.  The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this; with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks, there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled.  The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy (Stan), Lari White (Bettina) and Geoffrey Blake (Maynard Graham), all of whom add so much to the success of this film.  But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart-felt, memorable character.  It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  ""Cast Away"" is an engrossing film that-- make no mistake-- is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island; it's about enlightenment, and taking stock of the things that matter before it's too late.  A wake-up call, one could say, for a generation mired in technology, and governed by Time.",4,When Time Stands Still,979084800,"01 10, 2001",2001,4361,"['live', 'world', 'latest', 'technology', 'taken', 'granted', 'daily', 'basis', 'Fast', 'Food', 'Generation', 'charge', 'everything', 'be', 'done', 'yesterday', 'literally', 'not', 'enough', 'hours', 'day', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Cast', 'Away', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'man', 'who', 'bought', 'above', 'suddenly', 'plucked', 'seemingly', 'random', 'given', 'something', 'new', 'ponder', 'Life', 'Life', 'most', 'basic', 'primitive', 'form', 'where', 'survival', 'are', 'two', 'hands', 'wits', 'nature', 'glory', 'can', 'provide', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'supervisor', 'Fed-Ex', 'who', 'dies', 'clock', 'world', 'traveler', 'time', 'home', 'loved', 'ones', 'calculated', 'minute', 'Christmas', 'exchanges', 'gifts', 'intended', 'Kelly', 'Frears', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'car', 'boarding', 'yet', 'flight', 'will', 'spirit', 'away', 'oversee', 'job', 'yet', 'city', 'country', 'time', 'somewhere', 'ocean', 'elemental', 'forces', 'take', 'charge', 'plane', 'forced', 'ditch', 'sea', 'Noland', 'life', 'few', 'seconds', 'changed', 'forever', 'only', 'be', 'washed', 'ashore', 'small', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'where', 'must', 'confront', 'Time', 'never', 'comparisons', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'may', 'spring', 'mind', 'immediately', 'tuck', 'away', 'back', 'pocket', 'memory', 'what', 'Zemeckis', 'Hanks', 'give', 'here', 'anything', 'learn', 'enough', 'Noland', 'Kelly', 'time', 'leading', 'up', 'ill-fated', 'flight', 'time', 'Noland', 'island', 'know', 'who', 'man', 'what', 'tick', 'also', 'life', 'love', 'what', 'will', 'mean', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'time', 'island', 'more', 'just', 'handbook', 'survival', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'man', 'coming', 'terms', 'learning', 'hard', 'way', 'core', 'existence', 'clock', 'negated', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'invaluable', 'lessons', 'indeed', 'man', 'island', 'sorely', 'one', 'thing', 'nature', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'Companionship', 'Hanks', 'tremendously', 'subtle', 'yet', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Noland', 'doubt', 'consider', 'fact', 'film', 'more', 'hour', 'allowing', 'tension', 'drama', 'lag', 'Zemeckis', 'course', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'credit', 'keeping', 'task', 'including', 'what', 'star', 'doing', 'together', 'make', 'riveting', 'drama', 'viewer', 'enthralled', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'happening', 'present', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'something', 'just', 'corner', 'happen', 'real', 'strength', 'film', 'way', 'presented', 'way', 'Hanks', 'so', 'successfully', 'audience', 'create', 'empathy', 'viewer', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'feel', 'be', 'place', 'understanding', 'sudden', 'regard', 'things', 'are', 'taken', 'granted', 'day', 'simple', 'creature', 'comforts', 'book', 'matches', 'water', 'having', 'someone', 'share', 'laugh', 'most', 'importantly', 'knowing', 'alternating', 'sense', 'hope', 'despair', 'Noland', 'must', 'live', 'respite', 'message', 'so', 'succinctly', 'driven', 'home', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'real', 'sense', 'awe', 'metaphor', 'man', 'crossroads', 'life', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'nod', 'Zemeckis', 'Hanks', 'purity', 'treatment', 'aforementioned', 'theme', 'film', 'unparalleled', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Stan', 'Lari', 'White', 'Bettina', 'Geoffrey', 'Blake', 'Maynard', 'Graham', 'whom', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'film', 'performance', 'really', 'together', 'given', 'gifted', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'limited', 'amount', 'screen', 'time', 'Kelly', 'heart-felt', 'memorable', 'character', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'worthy', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Cast', 'Away', 'engrossing', 'film', 'make', 'mistake', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'how', 'guy', 'deserted', 'island', 'enlightenment', 'taking', 'stock', 'things', 'matter', 'too', 'late', 'wake-up', 'call', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'generation', 'mired', 'technology', 'governed', 'Time']",N/A

However, when a storm tears down the plane, every passenger on the plane is killed on the plane exept for Chuck Noland. In the most intense and thought provoking scenes in the film, a man is torn from his life, his friends, family, and is drafted in to the ocean. In an incredibly violent storm. Battling the cold and and the storm, barely clinging on to a half beaten raft that he kept on him, Chuck manages to bear it all, and reaches the shore, to come upon his new &quot;home&quot;.For 4 years, the character Chuck Noland, goes from being a &quot;city boy&quot; who could not catch a fish, to an expert in survial and who could spear a fish 20 feet away at the blink of an eye. Eventually, after the horrid time, braving the mystics of the island. Chuck Noland, a some what now battered man, finally gets the courage to go against the waves, and the horrors that the ocean might bring by making a make-shift boat, along with him is &quot;Wilson&quot;, a volley ball, after days and days of drifting,**Do not read if you do not want it spolied**, a ship spots Chuck and takes him out of his misery. When shaved and given a meal, Chuck Noland sets out on his new quest, being able to say to the world, &quot;What more can you bring to me? I say bring it&quot;.Tom Hanks plays the character brilliantly, with little dialouge which I did not mind. The effort put forth in this film by Tom Hanks is great, he first gains about 10 pounds for the role, then loses 50 pounds for the later part which, I can sure appreciate. I think this is a great film, shot with a low budget, you know Tom Hanks is not in it just for the money, the budget like I said is low, and just the atmosphere that Tom Hanks brings to the film is enough to see the film. It is greatly written, and directed with exellent visuals and of course the beautiful Fiji island.An all around great film, with very little flaws if any, and it makes me wonder why anyone would give this a four or lower.

I thought the plane-crash scenes were first-rate and, of course, the parallel with old Robinson Crusoe were very apparent (after four years, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart!). The overly-generous use of the Federal Express name, premises and equipment meant that the movie had to tread awfully carefully (wouldn't Chuck open ALL the packages washed ashore?), still, FedEx ought to be commended for what it did allow. I thought ""Wilson"" (his volleyball ""friend"") was a bit silly, but who knows how any of us will react with no company for four years?

534921,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00003CXRP,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","Cast Away (Robert Zemeckis, 2000)Okay, I have to get this out of my system right now. &quot;Castaway&quot; is ONE WORD. Not two. ONE.And now, on with the review.It has been a painfully long time since Robert Zemeckis made a good film (Peter Jackson was responsible for The Frighteners, Zemeckis only lent his name); depending on your point of view, that could be Death Becomes Her, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Back to the Future, or if you're _really_ a purist, Used Cars. Cast Away was the great white hope, the movie that would bring Robert Zemeckis' career back from the grave he'd dug with such abominable tripe as Forrest Gump and What Lies Beneath.Sorry. No luck.In two and a half tortuously long hours, Zemeckis leads Tom Hanks through Christmas dinner, a plane ride, three raft trips, another plane ride, a taxi, and an SUV. And while there are a few other supporting players in the movie (Helen Hunt, a woefully underused Chris Noth, an even more woefully underused Lari White in her first big-screen appearance since the Ben Cross vehicle The Unholy twelve years before), make no mistake-- this movie is about Tom Hanks and His Ability to Act. Because of that, the only relationship in the movie that actually makes any sense is that which Hanks forms with his well-known pal Wilson, the volleyball who keeps him company during his stint on the island. (In Zemeckis' favor, the volleyball never does develop a voice. I feared that for about an hour.)Given that the movie IS about THaHATA, one wonders why we really needed that hour or so of frame time that surrounded THaHATA. What's Helen Hunt doing here? Despite her role as Hanks' wife-to-be at the beginning and the yardstick we are (presumably) supposed to use to judge how the world has gone on without him at the end, her relatinoahip with Hanks is far less convincing than Wilson's. Like Noth and White, a good actor in a bad role.Trimming forty-five minutes of frame would have made this watchable, at least. As it stands now, rent it if you like Tom Hanks and have a coupon for a ninety-nine cent rental. **",2,Zemeckis does it again,1006732800,"11 26, 2001",2001,2075,"['Cast', 'Away', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', '2000', 'Okay', 'have', 'get', 'out', 'system', 'right', 'now', 'quot', 'Castaway', 'quot', 'ONE', 'WORD', 'Not', 'two', 'now', 'review.It', 'been', 'painfully', 'long', 'time', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'made', 'good', 'film', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'was', 'responsible', 'Frighteners', 'Zemeckis', 'only', 'lent', 'name', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'could', 'be', 'Death', 'Becomes', 'Her', 'Who', 'Framed', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'Back', 'Future', ""'re"", '_really_', 'purist', 'Used', 'Cars', 'Cast', 'Away', 'was', 'great', 'white', 'hope', 'movie', 'would', 'bring', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'career', 'back', 'grave', ""'d"", 'dug', 'such', 'abominable', 'tripe', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'What', 'Beneath.Sorry', 'luck.In', 'two', 'half', 'tortuously', 'long', 'hours', 'Zemeckis', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'plane', 'ride', 'three', 'raft', 'trips', 'plane', 'ride', 'taxi', 'SUV', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'supporting', 'players', 'movie', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'even', 'more', 'woefully', 'underused', 'Lari', 'White', 'first', 'big-screen', 'appearance', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'vehicle', 'Unholy', 'twelve', 'years', 'make', 'mistake', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Ability', 'Act', 'only', 'relationship', 'movie', 'actually', 'sense', 'Hanks', 'forms', 'well-known', 'pal', 'Wilson', 'volleyball', 'who', 'company', 'stint', 'island', 'Zemeckis', 'favor', 'volleyball', 'never', 'develop', 'voice', 'feared', 'hour', 'movie', 'THaHATA', 'one', 'wonders', 'why', 'really', 'needed', 'hour', 'so', 'frame', 'time', 'surrounded', 'THaHATA', 'What', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'doing', 'here', 'role', 'Hanks', 'wife-to-be', 'beginning', 'yardstick', 'are', 'presumably', 'supposed', 'use', 'judge', 'how', 'world', 'gone', 'end', 'relatinoahip', 'Hanks', 'far', 'less', 'convincing', 'Wilson', 'Noth', 'White', 'good', 'actor', 'bad', 'role.Trimming', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'frame', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'watchable', 'least', 'now', 'rent', 'like', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'have', 'coupon', 'ninety-nine', 'cent', 'rental', '**']",N/A

534923,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00003CXRP,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Let me rant first, and then explain my 4 star rating.I watched this on DVD, and I experienced something that is becoming more and more common on DVDs: an irritatingly slow appearance of the menu. When DVDs first came out, I thought it was just incredible that you pop them in, and almost immediately would get the menu that would allow you without delay to access the features you wanted. If you wanted to watch the film immediately with no delay, that is what you did. More and more, however, DVDs are packing pre-Menu material. With CAST AWAY, you get the Interpol warning, followed by previews (that you can close out of), and then, before the menu itself finally comes into view, a slow loading picture of Tom Hanks face that only gruadually fades away to reveal the selection menu. But even then, when you click on your option, it again only very slowly takes you to the feature you want. What I ended up doing was bookmarking the opening credits, so that if I ever wanted to watch the movie again, I could bypass all this nonsense to get right to the film.I wonder if the DVD makers understand what a pain this all is? I wonder if they understand that one of the greatest attractions of DVDs is the fact that DVDs give the viewers what they want. I want widescreen, not full screen. I want to get right to the film. Not watch a bunch of previews and plodding menu graphics. Remember KISS: Keep it Simple Stupid. Some DVDs now even give you nonoptional advertisements and previews. They are ruining a very good thing.Now, the movie. The makers of CAST AWAY did a great job given the fact that this is basically a movie where almost nothing happens, and, what is more, almost nothing could happen. ROBINSON CRUSOE dealt pretty much with the same story. But the difference between it and CAST AWAY is the fact that ROBINSON CRUSOE is very much a novel of ideas. Because it if very difficult to discuss many ideas in a movie without much dialog, that was not really an option for CAST AWAY. The challenge to the filmmakers, therefore, was to flesh out what was necessarily a bare bones plot. They achieved this by chopping the movie into four parts: 1) the prequel to the arrival to the island (including the very exciting plane crash sequence, easily the best part of the movie and one of the best plane crashes I have seen), 2) Tom Hanks's time on the island, the longest segment in the movie, 3) his escape from the island, and 4) his arrival home. The last part was a lot longer than what one might have expected, but because there had been very little action in the film, it was necessary to give it balance.The one real shortcoming in the film is the difficulty of coming up with much dramatic action. The strength in the film is the fact that they did such an incredible job of overcoming so many of the limitations.Tom Hanks was great, as usual. One of the more interesting aspects of his role was the fact that in the first part of his time on the island, he is a bit blobby. Definite gut. Near the end of his time on the island, he has really shaped up. Must have taken a few thousand crunches to get those abs! Great work (out) Tom! One mark at how very, very good he is was shown in his relation with &quot;Wilson&quot;, a volley ball upon which he painted (in his own blood) a face and with whom he developed a relationship. Now, on one level, this was very, very silly. But Hanks played it to the hilt, and at the end, when Wilson and Tom are parted, you feel his intense grief at losing his only friend.The rest of the cast really didn't matter. This was a one man movie. But, for what it is worth, the supporting cast was solid enough.There was, however, one major star of the movie other than Tom Hanks, and that was the island itself. Just a great locale. Dramatic, beautiful, and yet, just forbidding enough, it was the perfect costar for Tom Hanks.So, not a perfect movie, but nonetheless a very good one. And if you enjoy Tom Hanks's work, as I do, it will provide a couple of hours of great entertainment, IF you can get past the opening menu.By the way, I have had a couple of friends ask me if I thought Hanks rather than Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar. I gave them a two part answer, which I will repeat here. First, while I thought he deserved the Oscar more than Crowe (I am a HUGE Russell Crowe fan, and I definitely thought he deserved the Oscar for THE INSIDER, but THE GLADIATOR, while good, is not one of his very best roles), I thought the Oscar for best actor should have gone to someone who was not even nominated: Jamie Bell for BILLY ELIOTT.",4,A positive review combined with a minor rant on the

The only complaint about the film is the length. The first section could have been shorter, more island scenes, and drastically cut out the end.

534925,A1MN1Y3QNUFRBE,B00003CXRP,"Robert W. Berg ""Rob""","[0, 0]","&quot;Cast Away&quot; is one of those all-too rare, brilliant films that is perfectly structured, perfectly conceived, and perfectly acted. In many ways, it is like a three act play, or three short movies. The first act introduces the main character and shows his life up until his being stranded on a desert island. The second act, the major bulk of the film, is a tour de force, one man character piece about the struggles to survive all by oneself.  To craft a film in which most of the action involves one actor by himself for around an hour or more of screen time, and make it absorbing, insightful, and never boring is an amazing achievement, one which can be attributed to the great direction of Robert Zemeckis and the wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, who manages to make his character both an everyman and three-dimensional, living, breathing person. It is in this second act that we really learn about this man. By seeing every creature comfort he has grown up with instantly snatched away from him, and watching a modern man have to utilize talents of survival he didn't even know he had, we the audience are rewarded with the experience of seeing a character closer than usually happens in film. The third act is the resolution: what happens when this man who has had to live a primitive lifestyle, returns to the modern world. The amazing thing is, not much has changed in terms of technology or so forth (therefore it is not a Rip Van Winkle type tale). Instead, he has changed. Watch this movie for one of the most fascinating character portrayals in recent film history,and for the great performance by Tom Hanks. Rarely does a movie so brilliantly set up a life for a character, take it away from him in a flash, thus forcing him to create a new life for himself, and then see the results when he is returned to the old one, forever now a changed man. Notice that the title is not &quot;Castaway,&quot; the noun, but the verb &quot;cast away,&quot; giving the movie much richer, symbolic levels of meaning than what the former would have been.",5,&quot;Cast Away&quot; is brilliant and absorbing.,989366400,"05 9, 2001",2001,2063,"['quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'one', 'all-too', 'rare', 'brilliant', 'films', 'perfectly', 'structured', 'perfectly', 'conceived', 'perfectly', 'acted', 'many', 'ways', 'three', 'act', 'play', 'three', 'short', 'movies', 'first', 'act', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'up', 'being', 'stranded', 'desert', 'island', 'second', 'act', 'major', 'bulk', 'film', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'one', 'man', 'character', 'piece', 'struggles', 'survive', 'craft', 'film', 'most', 'action', 'one', 'actor', 'hour', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'absorbing', 'insightful', 'never', 'boring', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'great', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'make', 'character', 'everyman', 'three-dimensional', 'living', 'breathing', 'person', 'second', 'act', 'really', 'learn', 'man', 'seeing', 'creature', 'comfort', 'grown', 'up', 'instantly', 'snatched', 'away', 'watching', 'modern', 'man', 'have', 'utilize', 'talents', 'survival', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'had', 'audience', 'are', 'rewarded', 'experience', 'seeing', 'character', 'closer', 'usually', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'resolution', 'what', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'live', 'primitive', 'lifestyle', 'returns', 'modern', 'world', 'amazing', 'thing', 'not', 'much', 'changed', 'terms', 'technology', 'so', 'forth', 'not', 'Rip', 'Van', 'Winkle', 'tale', 'Instead', 'changed', 'Watch', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'character', 'portrayals', 'recent', 'film', 'history', 'great', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'set', 'up', 'life', 'character', 'take', 'away', 'flash', 'thus', 'forcing', 'create', 'new', 'life', 'then', 'see', 'results', 'when', 'returned', 'old', 'one', 'forever', 'now', 'changed', 'man', 'Notice', 'title', 'not', 'quot', 'Castaway', 'quot', 'noun', 'verb', 'quot', 'cast', 'away', 'quot', 'giving', 'movie', 'much', 'richer', 'symbolic', 'levels', 'meaning', 'what', 'former', 'would', 'have', 'been']",N/A

In it the rock band choses to call itself the Oneders instead of the Wonders. Why is this movie called Cast Away instead of Castaway? Is this supposed to center the focus of the film where his girlfriend seems to cast him away? I thought this film was about the middle where he is a castaway on an island. Why go with such a deep title? It makes me think too much. I enjoyed Cast Away the first time out. I have friend at work who saw Cast Away the same weekend I did and he told me he walked out of the movie and got his money back after the first half hour! I thought he was an idiot because having seen the whole movie it was pretty good overall. I am no longer so sure he is so dumb, but he did miss most of the entertaining part of the film. Castaway is very engaging after the plane crashes as Chuck Noland (Hanks) must strategise for his survival and rescue. From the film's outset Hanks character is established as hard core dedicated to Federal Express and his customers. It is kind of sweet to see how he remains consistant to that trait even when he is alone on an island. He endures many painful hardships that will have you wincing and covering your eyes at times. It makes you very happy when he finally has a little victory. His relationship with Wilson the volleyball is a memorable touch. Tom Hanks performs his heart out as usual. Castaway takes a long time to get going. Before he becomes stranded the film needs to establish Hanks is dedicated to his job, has a girlfriend he hopes to marry, and has the beginnings of a toothache. Unfortunately it meanders by including an arguably unnecessary sub-story about a package from an anonymous customer and a friend who's wife has cancer. This could have all been much briefer as so much of it was mundane. I am a true believer that no good film can be too long and no bad film can be too short. Castaway falls somewhere in the middle. It is a good film bookended between a dragging mediocre film. After spending eighty plus minutes on the island, Noland is finally rescued there is another extended segment which includes the public national welcome home parties, a failed reunion and a wrap up of the story of the anonymous customer's package. Hanks reflects on his experience and comes up with a metaphysical conclusion that he must just &quot;be&quot; which is neither inpiring or particularly insightful. The film is deeply flawed by continuing the films stay well beyond its welcome point. But of course Tom Hanks plays a character who is easy to care about making the film still worthy of a lackluster recommend. Like the newest Notting Hill super collector's DVD which has six hours of bonus material, Castaway contains more than I ever want to know about the movie. No less than five featurettes, including Hank's interview with Charlie Rose, Artwork, storyboards and commercials and trailers for the film. Plus a full length commentary by Director Robert Zemekis and crew. If you love Castaway you will certainly love this disc. If my review were only about the time spent stranded on the island I would be happy to give this film a stronger grade. Unfortunately over a third of the film drags unnecessarily I reluctantly must say this film can be a bit of a bore.",3,The Castaway part was better than the Cast Away part.,998956800,"08 28, 2001",2001,3311,"['am', 'reminded', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'quot', 'Thing', 'Do', 'quot', 'rock', 'band', 'call', 'Oneders', 'instead', 'Wonders', 'Why', 'movie', 'called', 'Cast', 'Away', 'instead', 'Castaway', 'supposed', 'center', 'focus', 'film', 'where', 'girlfriend', 'cast', 'away', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'middle', 'where', 'castaway', 'island', 'Why', 'go', 'deep', 'title', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Cast', 'Away', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'friend', 'work', 'who', 'saw', 'Cast', 'Away', 'same', 'weekend', 'did', 'told', 'walked', 'movie', 'got', 'money', 'back', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'thought', 'was', 'idiot', 'having', 'seen', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'so', 'sure', 'so', 'dumb', 'did', 'miss', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'film', 'Castaway', 'very', 'engaging', 'plane', 'crashes', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Hanks', 'must', 'strategise', 'survival', 'rescue', 'film', 'outset', 'Hanks', 'character', 'established', 'hard', 'core', 'dedicated', 'Federal', 'Express', 'customers', 'kind', 'sweet', 'see', 'how', 'consistant', 'trait', 'even', 'when', 'alone', 'island', 'many', 'painful', 'hardships', 'will', 'have', 'wincing', 'covering', 'eyes', 'times', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'finally', 'little', 'victory', 'relationship', 'Wilson', 'volleyball', 'memorable', 'touch', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'heart', 'out', 'usual', 'Castaway', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'stranded', 'film', 'establish', 'Hanks', 'dedicated', 'job', 'girlfriend', 'marry', 'beginnings', 'toothache', 'meanders', 'including', 'arguably', 'unnecessary', 'sub-story', 'package', 'anonymous', 'customer', 'friend', 'who', 'wife', 'cancer', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'briefer', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'mundane', 'am', 'true', 'believer', 'good', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'bad', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'short', 'Castaway', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'good', 'film', 'bookended', 'dragging', 'mediocre', 'film', 'spending', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'island', 'Noland', 'finally', 'rescued', 'extended', 'segment', 'public', 'national', 'welcome', 'home', 'parties', 'failed', 'reunion', 'wrap', 'story', 'anonymous', 'customer', 'package', 'Hanks', 'experience', 'up', 'metaphysical', 'conclusion', 'must', 'just', 'quot', 'be', 'quot', 'inpiring', 'particularly', 'insightful', 'film', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'continuing', 'films', 'stay', 'well', 'welcome', 'point', 'course', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'character', 'who', 'easy', 'care', 'making', 'film', 'still', 'lackluster', 'recommend', 'newest', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'super', 'collector', 'DVD', 'six', 'hours', 'bonus', 'material', 'Castaway', 'more', 'ever', 'want', 'know', 'movie', 'No', 'less', 'five', 'featurettes', 'including', 'Hank', 'interview', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Artwork', 'storyboards', 'commercials', 'trailers', 'film', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Zemekis', 'crew', 'love', 'Castaway', 'will', 'certainly', 'love', 'disc', 'review', 'were', 'only', 'time', 'spent', 'stranded', 'island', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'give', 'film', 'stronger', 'grade', 'Unfortunately', 'third', 'film', 'unnecessarily', 'reluctantly', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'bore']",N/A

And he did well in this role as well. A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island. I always worried there would be a threatening person or creature on the island that would eventually attack him but I guess they thought that Tom Hanks being alone on the island was more dramatic, and I could see that. This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well. And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending. It's just an ending, that signifies a new beginning for Hank's character. A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.Overall I really did like this film.

534932,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXRP,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","From such established literary classics as ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" to such products of pop culture idiocy as ""Gilligan's Island"" and the original ""Survivor,"" the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit, ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self-preservation.  Perhaps, those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we, ourselves, could rise to such a challenge.  Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's ""Survivor"" and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away.""""Cast Away"" is a film that works on several different levels at once - but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking.  This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks, during the course of the filming, underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull.""  Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.The story is a simple one:  Chuck Noland is a classic type-A FedEx exec (one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie-in to end all product tie-ins) who is clearly too focused on the split-second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses - or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean, Chuck, as the sole survivor, manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange, forbidding world.  Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.  We watch the step-by-step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence - and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued.""Cast Away"" is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality.  The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love - even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them (children, of course, do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates).  The finale of the film rings true as well, for we know that, in our lives, fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us.  The world marches on and, if, for any reason, we fall off temporarily, all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up, painful as that may be at times.As it is, ""Cast Away"" is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations.",4,fascinating tale of survival,997315200,"08 9, 2001",2001,3286,"['such', 'established', 'literary', 'classics', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'such', 'products', 'pop', 'culture', 'idiocy', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'original', 'Survivor', 'human', 'imagination', 'been', 'fired', 'up', 'tales', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'being', 'suddenly', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'forced', 'survive', 'sheer', 'wit', 'ingenuity', 'unquenchable', 'human', 'instinct', 'self-preservation', 'Perhaps', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'softened', 'amenities', 'have', 'come', 'rely', 'get', 'daily', 'lives', 'wonder', 'could', 'rise', 'challenge', 'underlying', 'motivation', 'lure', 'theme', 'primal', 'seemingly', 'universal', 'evidenced', 'recent', 'popular', 'successes', 'TV', 'Survivor', 'latest', 'movie', 'opus', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Cast', 'Away', 'film', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'once', 'surely', 'most', 'impressive', 'sheer', 'physicality', 'undertaking', 'not', 'only', 'setting', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'course', 'filming', 'underwent', 'change', 'physique', 'matched', 'only', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'Even', 'more', 'impressive', 'Hanks', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'vast', 'stretches', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'nary', 'word', 'hence', 'must', 'convey', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'almost', 'entirely', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bodily', 'gestures.The', 'story', 'simple', 'one', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'classic', 'type-A', 'FedEx', 'exec', 'one', 'tidy', 'sum', 'company', 'forked', 'benefit', 'product', 'tie-in', 'end', 'product', 'tie-ins', 'who', 'clearly', 'too', 'focused', 'split-second', 'requirements', 'hectic', 'job', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'formally', 'propose', 'marriage', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'When', 'company', 'plane', 'crashes', 'Pacific', 'Ocean', 'Chuck', 'sole', 'survivor', 'wash', 'up', 'deserted', 'island', 'forced', 'make', 'own', 'strange', 'forbidding', 'world', 'Zemeckis', 'Hanks', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'making', 'Chuck', 'predicament', 'reaction', 'believable', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'step-by-step', 'process', 'Chuck', 'attempts', 'bring', 'order', 'strange', 'new', 'existence', 'equally', 'intriguing', 'ways', 'cope', 'mounting', 'loneliness', 'solitude', 'will', 'face', 'coming', 'years', 'not', 'rescued', 'Cast', 'Away', 'filled', 'moments', 'surprising', 'warmth', 'emotionality', 'personal', 'relationship', 'Chuck', 'volleyball', 'Wilson', 'strange', 'meaning', 'depth', 'great', 'need', 'have', 'companionship', 'love', 'even', 'have', 'invest', 'human', 'traits', 'inanimate', 'object', 'get', 'children', 'course', 'do', 'time', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'imaginary', 'playmates', 'finale', 'film', 'rings', 'true', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'lives', 'fate', 'often', 'ways', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'time', 'truly', 'not', 'stand', 'still', 'world', 'reason', 'fall', 'off', 'temporarily', 'can', 'do', 'jump', 'back', 'try', 'catch', 'up', 'painful', 'may', 'be', 'times.As', 'Cast', 'Away', 'gripping', 'moving', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'worthy', 'entry', 'genre', 'never', 'lose', 'hold', 'imaginations']",N/A

Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale; from the moment he is in the plane until he is rescued, this is one magnetically charged movie, and in ways you might not expect.  The plane crash itself jolts your senses; it is that kind of big-screen sequence in which you lose all sense of time and place and are in the movie; Cast Away remains that way throughout the entire sequence on the island.  The ocean waves themselves become characters, and their incessant pounding on the surf takes on a horrific quality, even in its natural beauty. But as sure-footed as this movie is when Tom is &quot;cast away&quot;, it is disheartening to report that the final half hour or so, featuring an uninteresting Helen Hunt, robs us of the very buildup we've been mesmerized by for over 90 minutes.

Anyway, I quite liked ""Cast Away"", despite a slightly slow third act.  Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee who happens to get stuck on an island, all by himself and with barely anything to survive with.  What surprises me about the film is it's usage of elements such as a musical score (virtually nonexistent for 2/3 of the film), sound effects (the ""score"" for most of the film), and even photography that have to explain a lot in a film like this.  Even though it is a good film with some good performances, it is marred by a slow third act, but is definitely a commendable effort.  The DVD boasts a few documentaries on the island itself, survival techniques, and one on Wilson, the volleyball.  It also includes a 45-minute interview with Tom Hanks on not just ""Cast Away"", but on some of his previous efforts (including the upcoming HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers"").  Plus, there's some visual effect sequences broken down for your amusement, and the trailers, TV ads, and a nicely hidden Easter Egg that may answer one of the movie's more intruging questions.

I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 24 in the past year and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I just wasn't that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually bought about 24 Blu-Ray discs, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47"" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32"" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.

The whole idea of the picture of his girlfriend keeping him alive for 4 years was okay but when he finally hets back and he learns that she is married with a daughter it is just absurd. Tom Hanks did a fair job of acting but I don't think that he should earn any award for his performance in this film. If you would like to watch Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for nearly two hours, this movie is for you.The only reason the movie earned 2 stars from me is because I thought that the action sequences on the Fed Ex plane were superb.

I want to comment on what seems to have been missed by virtually everyone who has seen the movie.There are TWO things that keep Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) going while on the deserted island: First, and most obviously, he is devoted to his fianc&eacute;. This gives him someone to hold onto in his heart as a reason to survive - and hope. His need for human companionship is demonstrated, of course, in his turning a volleyball - with his own blood as a marking pen - into a pal and fellow castaway with whom he can commiserate. But the other thing that is of no less importance to his will to survive is the Fed Ex package that he does NOT open. He is determined to do his job and deliver this package (though perhaps a bit late). It is this devotion to duty that ultimately leads him to his fateful encounter at the end of the movie. Thus, Zemeckis shows that by staying true to his inner voice, maintaining hope in impossible circumstances and seeing it through to the bitter end -- even though he could not possibly have known that this would lead him to happiness -- he winds up finding his true destiny after all.I loved it.",5,"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also",990057600,"05 17, 2001",2001,1212,"['wo', ""n't"", 'recap', 'plot', 'movie', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'want', 'comment', 'have', 'been', 'missed', 'virtually', 'everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'movie.There', 'are', 'TWO', 'things', 'keep', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'going', 'deserted', 'island', 'First', 'most', 'obviously', 'devoted', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'someone', 'hold', 'onto', 'heart', 'reason', 'survive', 'hope', 'need', 'human', 'companionship', 'demonstrated', 'course', 'turning', 'volleyball', 'own', 'blood', 'marking', 'pen', 'pal', 'fellow', 'castaway', 'whom', 'can', 'commiserate', 'other', 'thing', 'less', 'importance', 'will', 'survive', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'package', 'NOT', 'open', 'determined', 'do', 'job', 'deliver', 'package', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'late', 'devotion', 'duty', 'ultimately', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'end', 'movie', 'Thus', 'Zemeckis', 'staying', 'true', 'inner', 'voice', 'maintaining', 'hope', 'impossible', 'circumstances', 'seeing', 'bitter', 'end', 'even', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'known', 'would', 'lead', 'happiness', 'up', 'finding', 'true', 'destiny', 'all.I', 'loved']",N/A

He kisses his fianc&eacute;e goodbye on Christmas Eve to take a flight on a Federal Express plane. He tells her he will be right back, but we all know by the title of the movie that he doesn't keep his promise. Chuck's plane goes down in bad weather and Chuck washes up on a very small island with a few Federal Express packages. He spends four years on the island with a volleyball as his only friend until the ocean washes hope up on his shore.My Opinion:  There were three main parts to Cast Away. I liked the island part the best. It was the most intriguing and interesting. I wish there had been more to this part. I wanted to know more about how he spent those four long years. I would have liked to see him build things and deal with the solitude. The first part, although setting up the next two parts, was a little long. The last part was not as satisfying as I had hoped. Chuck remains a castaway even though there is some hope at the end. I enjoyed the movie but found it was only good, and not great.DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1, DD6.1 sound.

Maybe that is testament to Tom Hanks who turns out a star performance here. The location and scenery are also amazing and the direction shows it off to excellent effect. This film follows Chuck Noland (Hanks) as he survives a plane crash and has to live on a deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean for four years. You live his loneliness and trials as he struggles to survive and learn the skill necessary to get by. In fact the scene when he finally learns to make fire, and his reaction to it, never fails to raise a smile and you truly feel his jubilation. The middle section of the film on the island is very quiet, as previously noted in other reviews, but it doesn't drag and only heightens the isolation Noland must feel. Hanks keeps you engrossed by his every nuance and movement he makes. It's only when Noland begins to unwrap FedEx parcels (from the plane crash) and finds a Wilson Volley ball, that he paints a face onto, does he start talking again. It actually become quite touching to see him interact with an inanimate object and must be one of the most unique on-screen relationships ever! The ending is a little `Hollywood' and cheesy, but not excessively so and I'll admit to a lump in my throat briefly towards the end. This is a simple premise, excellently executed and although I've seen this film many times it never gets boring or any less gripping.

534960,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B00003CXRP,Stephen A. Haines,"[0, 1]","Being led into a deception is annoying enough.  Leading yourself down some primrose path to confront disappointment is downright awkward.  &quot;Tom Hanks&quot; must mean this will be a film worth investment, right?  Wrong on nearly all counts.  Tom Hanks is a fine actor.  He does a memorable job in this film.  He conveys the agony of isolation with lively intensity.  The viewer shares his struggles with sympathy as he draws you into his daily acts of survival.  Hanks is a superb actor.  The pity is the material he's been given to work with.  No matter how adroitly he conveys the desire to survive in isolation, carrying the memory of his  abandoned love, Helen Hunt, the film is predictable from start to finish.  There isn't a single surprise in this latest entry in Hollywood's Robinson Crusoe sweepstakes.The transformation of a shallow man into someone bringing hidden abilities to bear on a difficult situation is a favourite Hollywood theme.  If it's done well, we can all identify with the individual.  This is Hanks' special talent.  He's done it elsewhere, and he does it superbly here.  A mid-level executive in the FedEx courier firm, he operates under a compulsion to succeed.  He does it by driving others to match his pace.  Thrown on his own resources on a lonely Pacific island, Chuck Noland must develop new skills and strengths.  They're not readily forthcoming as Hanks expresses so well.  When he finds FedEx packages from the wrecked aircraft, his hesitation at opening them is manifest.  It must be the ultimate transgression for a FedEx employee.  Ludicrous as the discovery of ice skates seems, of course they prove valuable tools on the island.  The transformation of another find, a volleyball, into his alter ego is pure Hanks.  He carries the film in splendid isolation.That isolation, given the cast, is this film's greatest shortcoming.  Bringing Helen Hunt into this film in &quot;bookend&quot; scenes at the beginning and end is to do an outstanding actress a great disservice.  Instead, we are given Bill Broyles' experiences in survival schools imparted through Tom Hanks.  Had Zemekis goaded Broyles into broader vision, this film might have been redeemed.  Hunt could have portrayed her grief at his loss and whatever led her to follow the path ultimately revealed.  Slipping from the level of work he achieved in earlier films, Broyles here slips into simplistic and trite formulas.  Hanks calls &quot;I'll be right back!&quot; to Hunt before entering the aircraft.  Did any viewer doubt they wouldn't see each other until the film approached its finale?  Worse, the caption &quot;Four Years Later&quot; flashes on the screen and you know what must inevitably follow.  Hunt's other &quot;bookend&quot; appearance begins with her fainting, a totally inappropriate event for someone who exudes strength.  Even relaxed, Hunt couldn't assume a &quot;shrinking violet&quot; role, yet Broyles forces that unlikely role here.If you're a Hanks fan, this is a film to view once.  If you're a Hunt fan, you may enjoy the brevity of her appearance, which is hardly to her credit.  If you want a captivating story, well presented and rich with innovation, you'll be only partly satisfied.  Watch it once and pass it on.  Anyone wishing to own a copy may contact this reviewer for a bargain deal.  Perhaps you could also explain why the film's title is incorrect grammar.  &quot;Cast Away&quot; is the action of someone disposing something.  &quot;Castaway&quot; is what Tom Hanks plays.",3,Why was this film mis-titled?,1010966400,"01 14, 2002",2002,3519,"['Being', 'led', 'deception', 'annoying', 'enough', 'Leading', 'down', 'primrose', 'path', 'confront', 'disappointment', 'downright', 'awkward', 'quot', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'quot', 'must', 'mean', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'worth', 'investment', 'right', 'Wrong', 'nearly', 'counts', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fine', 'actor', 'memorable', 'job', 'film', 'conveys', 'agony', 'isolation', 'lively', 'intensity', 'viewer', 'shares', 'struggles', 'sympathy', 'daily', 'acts', 'survival', 'Hanks', 'superb', 'actor', 'pity', 'material', 'been', 'given', 'work', 'matter', 'how', 'adroitly', 'desire', 'survive', 'isolation', 'carrying', 'memory', 'abandoned', 'love', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'film', 'predictable', 'start', 'finish', ""n't"", 'single', 'surprise', 'latest', 'entry', 'Hollywood', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'transformation', 'shallow', 'man', 'someone', 'bringing', 'hidden', 'abilities', 'bear', 'difficult', 'situation', 'favourite', 'Hollywood', 'theme', 'done', 'well', 'can', 'identify', 'individual', 'Hanks', 'special', 'talent', 'done', 'elsewhere', 'superbly', 'here', 'mid-level', 'executive', 'FedEx', 'courier', 'firm', 'compulsion', 'succeed', 'driving', 'others', 'match', 'pace', 'Thrown', 'own', 'resources', 'lonely', 'Pacific', 'island', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'must', 'develop', 'new', 'skills', 'strengths', ""'re"", 'not', 'readily', 'forthcoming', 'Hanks', 'so', 'well', 'When', 'FedEx', 'packages', 'wrecked', 'aircraft', 'hesitation', 'opening', 'manifest', 'must', 'be', 'ultimate', 'transgression', 'FedEx', 'employee', 'Ludicrous', 'discovery', 'ice', 'skates', 'course', 'prove', 'valuable', 'tools', 'island', 'transformation', 'find', 'volleyball', 'alter', 'ego', 'pure', 'Hanks', 'film', 'splendid', 'isolation', 'given', 'cast', 'film', 'greatest', 'shortcoming', 'Bringing', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'film', 'quot', 'quot', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'end', 'do', 'outstanding', 'actress', 'great', 'disservice', 'Instead', 'are', 'given', 'Bill', 'Broyles', 'experiences', 'survival', 'schools', 'imparted', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Had', 'Zemekis', 'goaded', 'Broyles', 'broader', 'vision', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'redeemed', 'Hunt', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'grief', 'loss', 'led', 'follow', 'path', 'ultimately', 'revealed', 'Slipping', 'level', 'work', 'achieved', 'earlier', 'films', 'Broyles', 'here', 'simplistic', 'trite', 'formulas', 'Hanks', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'right', 'back', 'quot', 'Hunt', 'entering', 'aircraft', 'Did', 'viewer', 'doubt', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'film', 'approached', 'finale', 'Worse', 'caption', 'quot', 'Four', 'Years', 'Later', 'quot', 'flashes', 'screen', 'know', 'what', 'must', 'inevitably', 'follow', 'Hunt', 'other', 'quot', 'quot', 'appearance', 'fainting', 'totally', 'inappropriate', 'event', 'someone', 'who', 'strength', 'Even', 'relaxed', 'Hunt', 'could', ""n't"", 'assume', 'quot', 'shrinking', 'violet', 'quot', 'role', 'Broyles', 'forces', 'unlikely', 'role', 'here.If', ""'re"", 'Hanks', 'fan', 'film', 'view', 'once', ""'re"", 'Hunt', 'fan', 'may', 'enjoy', 'brevity', 'appearance', 'hardly', 'credit', 'want', 'captivating', 'story', 'well', 'presented', 'rich', 'innovation', ""'ll"", 'be', 'only', 'partly', 'satisfied', 'Watch', 'once', 'pass', 'Anyone', 'wishing', 'own', 'copy', 'may', 'contact', 'reviewer', 'bargain', 'deal', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'also', 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'title', 'incorrect', 'grammar', 'quot', 'Cast', 'Away', 'quot', 'action', 'someone', 'disposing', 'something', 'quot', 'Castaway', 'quot', 'what', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'plays']",N/A

534962,A27A3AZA7L12N6,B00003CXRP,Stephen M. Bauer,"[0, 1]","I don't know.  Definitely see the film, but this is really another character study.  Tom Hanks just happens to be stranded on a tropical island.  It's not about being stranded on a tropical island but about Tom Hanks trying to prove what a great character actor he is.  The similar stories, movies, and T.V. shows that  I saw as a child (Robinson Crusoe, Gilligan's Island, pirate stuff, Billy Budd, Typee, war movies where guys get stranded, etc.) were as fun and exciting or more so.  I think that's because those shows were about the situation more than a person's feelings or emotional adaptation the situation.  The whole idea of the genre is to escape mentally to a tropical island, not escape from one.  We want the imagined fantasy of freedom, running around in our underwear with tropical beauties and eating coconuts, not reality.The ending of Cast Away was cinematic poetry.  People should think (but not too deeply) for a few seconds about what was going on in the last shot.  I wished the moviemakers had stretched for a little more richness and depth in the part of the movie that occurs after Tom Hank's was rescued, including the very end.  They didn't show any change in personality, attitudes, increase in depth of personality, religious awakening, etc.  People who have been in different but far less intense situations, like the Peace Corp, for example, have come back with much more significantly changed attitudes and values about life.  The change could even have been that he came back as a basket case.  It shows a shallowness in the moviemaker's understanding of people both in the Tom Hank's character and in audiences.  I did think Meg Ryan's reactions to Tom Hank's release were well done and authentic.  But this is a movie you watch to be entertained not to analyze!Tom Hank's is trying too hard to be taken seriously as a great character actor.  I think he's trying to compete with Dinero and Nicholson-- ""star"" character actor.When we watch Cast Away, we're watching Tom Hanks, and America loves Tom Hanks.  But when we watch Deniro in movies like Mean Streets and Taxi, we're watching the character.  Everything Deniro does with the character fits in perfectly.  Robert Deniro never draws attention to himself in a movie.  He draws attention to the character he is playing.  The same can be said of the younger Robert Duvall.And sorry, I don't think I can judge female actors.  I sense that many of the great ones were before my time.  But I would put Vivian Leigh on any list of the best.  I am not moved by Merryl Streep.  I think she is more intellectual in preparation than say a Julia Roberts who can emote anything.  Meryl Streep is one who learns accents well, learns to do Irish step dancing, etc to prepare for roles, but can you imagine her trying to play some of the characters Julia Roberts has played?

Therefore, this review will only focus upon the actual quality of the transfer of 'Cast Away' to Blue Ray. Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.VIDEO QUALITY....Shot on film, Cast Away presents a very nice appearance on Blu Ray and, compared to my Standard Definition copy, an overall improvement.  However, this improvement is not night and day.  Color resolution is fairly realistic and skin tones are accurate and not overly saturated.  Focus can be soft in some place but contrast is quite good.  The soft focus can be seen early in the film when there is a aerial pan of the fields...here the grass and plains are justly green but without much detail to the blades, it appears to be a green blur.  However, I am nitpicking on this as the whole of the movie on Blu Ray is quite nice.  At no point did I see any artifacting or other video issues.  The Mbps appeared to average nicely in the high 30's and low 40's.  Four stars for the video.AUDIO QUALITY....The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is the real star of the Blu Ray's quality.  The entire first 30 minutes of film's audio is definitely demo worthy.  It is full of pans across the front and rear channels and many appropriately placed discreet foley fx steered to the individual surrounds.  The music score immerses you as it is steered throughout the entire home theater's audio system. The rest of the film, starting with Tom Hank's character on the island, also has plenty of discreet channeling to the surrounds.  They are just not quite as congested as the first half hour called for.  Still, rain fall and storms throughout the film, as well as ocean waves, whale calls and more make great use of all your surround speakers and LFE sub channel.  I must admit that I was surprised by the outstanding audio editing and sound reproduction.  5  stars easily on the audio.EXTRAS.....Other than the director's commentary, there are no extras.  What the menu calls 'search content' is just another form of scene selection.  There is a trivia track that, if selected, pops up various tidbits during the course of the film but I did not utilize it.  The theatrical trailer is also included.  There are no deleted or alternate scenes but, thankfully, there are also no previews of other films which just take up disc space and call for more compression to the film. I never liked paying for advertising on Blu Rays and, here, I don't.This film was certainly a major hit when it was released and it still retains its movie legs.I do hope that this review has been of some HELP to you in deciding your purchase. All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the actual disc and not redundant summaries and acting opinions.Thanks for reading.",5,Cast Away on Blu Ray,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,3032,"['are', 'already', 'great', 'many', 'reviews', 'here', 'providing', 'summary', 'plot', 'opinions', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'acting', 'Therefore', 'review', 'will', 'only', 'focus', 'actual', 'quality', 'transfer', ""'Cast"", 'Away', 'Blue', 'Ray', 'Keep', 'mind', 'quality', 'what', 'see', 'hear', 'also', 'quality', 'TV', 'monitor', 'are', 'using', 'accompanying', 'home', 'theater', 'processor', 'speakers', 'have', 'pretty', 'high', 'end', 'esoteric', 'system', 'am', 'judging', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'that.VIDEO', 'QUALITY', '.Shot', 'film', 'Cast', 'Away', 'very', 'nice', 'appearance', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'compared', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'copy', 'overall', 'improvement', 'However', 'improvement', 'not', 'night', 'day', 'Color', 'resolution', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'skin', 'tones', 'are', 'accurate', 'not', 'overly', 'saturated', 'Focus', 'can', 'be', 'soft', 'place', 'contrast', 'quite', 'good', 'soft', 'focus', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'aerial', 'pan', 'fields', 'here', 'grass', 'plains', 'are', 'justly', 'green', 'much', 'detail', 'blades', 'be', 'green', 'blur', 'However', 'am', 'nitpicking', 'whole', 'movie', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'quite', 'nice', 'point', 'did', 'see', 'artifacting', 'other', 'video', 'issues', 'Mbps', 'appeared', 'average', 'nicely', 'high', '30', 'low', '40', 'Four', 'stars', 'video.AUDIO', 'QUALITY', '.The', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'lossless', 'audio', 'real', 'star', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'quality', 'entire', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'audio', 'definitely', 'demo', 'worthy', 'full', 'pans', 'front', 'rear', 'channels', 'many', 'appropriately', 'placed', 'discreet', 'foley', 'fx', 'steered', 'individual', 'surrounds', 'music', 'score', 'steered', 'entire', 'home', 'theater', 'audio', 'system', 'rest', 'film', 'starting', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'character', 'island', 'also', 'plenty', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'surrounds', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'congested', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'called', 'Still', 'rain', 'fall', 'storms', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'ocean', 'waves', 'whale', 'calls', 'more', 'make', 'great', 'use', 'surround', 'speakers', 'LFE', 'sub', 'channel', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'surprised', 'outstanding', 'audio', 'editing', 'sound', 'reproduction', '5', 'stars', 'easily', 'audio.EXTRAS', '..Other', 'director', 'commentary', 'are', 'extras', 'What', 'menu', 'content', 'just', 'form', 'scene', 'selection', 'trivia', 'track', 'selected', 'up', 'various', 'tidbits', 'course', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'utilize', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'also', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'thankfully', 'are', 'also', 'previews', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'take', 'up', 'disc', 'space', 'call', 'more', 'compression', 'film', 'never', 'liked', 'paying', 'advertising', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'here', ""don't.This"", 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'major', 'hit', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'still', 'movie', 'legs.I', 'do', 'hope', 'review', 'been', 'HELP', 'deciding', 'purchase', 'reviews', 'focus', 'solely', 'quality', 'actual', 'disc', 'not', 'redundant', 'summaries', 'acting', 'opinions.Thanks', 'reading']",N/A
534965,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00003CXRP,Steven Aldersley,"[1, 1]","Cast Away (2000)Drama, 143 minutesDirected by Robert ZemeckisStarring Tom HanksTom Hanks was probably the biggest box office draw for around 10 years, starting with Philadelphia in 1993. Like Meryl Streep, his performances haven't always won the awards they deserved. We expect excellence from Hanks and Streep, and it's never easy to add an Oscar after you have already won twice. Cast Away sees Hanks give one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot.The opening part of the film introduces us to the life of Chuck Noland (Hanks). He works for FedEx and is obsessed with time. Everything has to happen according to schedule or he considers himself a failure. Noland is in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), but his life is too busy for him to make her his main priority. They have to exchange Christmas gifts in the car on their way to the airport because he doesn't make time for anything more significant. This is a common theme in the lives of too many people. We rush around, earning as much money as we can, barely slowing down long enough to spend time with the people we love. You don't miss it until it's gone.Noland's plane crashes and he's the sole survivor. He manages to swim ashore and finds himself alone on an island. This isn't a new idea, but the execution is excellent. Noland is used to a comfortable life and has to learn how to survive in his new surroundings. Where will he live? What will he eat? Will he need to protect himself? What if he's ill or in pain? How will he remain sane? How will he escape and make his way back to civilization?I enjoy Cast Away because it's such a peaceful movie. All we hear are natural sounds while Noland is trapped on the island. There isn't even any musical score during this extended sequence. It helps us realize what it is like to be completely alone. How would we adapt and survive? Would we have the mental strength to seek escape? It's an examination of how human beings think, and that always appeals to me.",5,Hanks is superb,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",2012,1986,"['Cast', 'Away', '2000', 'Drama', '143', 'minutesDirected', 'Robert', 'ZemeckisStarring', 'Tom', 'HanksTom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'probably', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'draw', '10', 'years', 'starting', 'Philadelphia', '1993', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performances', 'have', ""n't"", 'always', 'won', 'awards', 'deserved', 'expect', 'excellence', 'Hanks', 'Streep', 'never', 'easy', 'add', 'Oscar', 'have', 'already', 'won', 'twice', 'Cast', 'Away', 'Hanks', 'give', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'saying', 'lot.The', 'opening', 'part', 'film', 'life', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Hanks', 'FedEx', 'obsessed', 'time', 'Everything', 'happen', 'according', 'schedule', 'failure', 'Noland', 'love', 'Kelly', 'Frears', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'life', 'too', 'busy', 'make', 'main', 'priority', 'have', 'exchange', 'Christmas', 'gifts', 'car', 'way', 'airport', ""n't"", 'make', 'time', 'anything', 'more', 'significant', 'common', 'theme', 'lives', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'rush', 'around', 'earning', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'barely', 'slowing', 'down', 'long', 'enough', 'spend', 'time', 'people', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'gone.Noland', 'plane', 'crashes', 'sole', 'survivor', 'swim', 'ashore', 'alone', 'island', ""n't"", 'new', 'idea', 'execution', 'excellent', 'Noland', 'used', 'comfortable', 'life', 'learn', 'how', 'survive', 'new', 'surroundings', 'Where', 'will', 'live', 'What', 'will', 'eat', 'Will', 'need', 'protect', 'What', 'ill', 'pain', 'How', 'will', 'remain', 'sane', 'How', 'will', 'escape', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'civilization', 'enjoy', 'Cast', 'Away', 'such', 'peaceful', 'movie', 'hear', 'are', 'natural', 'sounds', 'Noland', 'trapped', 'island', ""n't"", 'even', 'musical', 'score', 'extended', 'sequence', 'realize', 'what', 'be', 'completely', 'alone', 'How', 'would', 'adapt', 'survive', 'Would', 'have', 'mental', 'strength', 'seek', 'escape', 'examination', 'how', 'human', 'beings', 'think', 'always', 'appeals']",N/A

I'd say the answer is ""yes,"" in a quiet sort of way.Chuck Noland (TH) is a fast-talking, time-obsessed workaholic with just enough charm to keep him from being totally obnoxious.  He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.  Chuck barely has time to court the lovely Helen Hunt (her talents totally wasted in this vapid role).  He exchanges Christmas presents with her in the car at the airport before he takes off on his fateful voyage.The plane crashes into the sea near an atoll/island.  The crash is frighteningly horrific and terrifying.  All hands are lost except Chuck who is thrown free of the wreckage and driving propellers, and he struggles onto shore.  Up until this time, the movie is full of movement, sound, voices and has a rather brittle frenetic feel.  Now all is silence.  Chuck slowly gets his bearings and we are shown scenes of him trying to cope with his new situation.  FedEx cargo has washed ashore with him, and he opens boxes containing ice skates, a courtier gown and a volley ball that he names ""Wilson"" after its maker.  He is clumsy and has accidents, but we cannot help but admire his perseverance.  After grueling attempts, he finally gets a fire started and dances around it in pure Tarzan style congratulating himself to the heavens above.  A pause---and it is four years later.  The audience gasps ""Four years!""  The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.  From an open-faced, slightly pudgy all-American boy, he has been transformed into a gaunt, sinewy, bearded predator with wary shifting eyes.With great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.  He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.  After great suffering and privitation, he is rescued and flung back into civilization.He reunites with his now-married girlfriend who announces he ""is the love of her life.""  Does she realize the man standing before her is an entirely different person than the one who left her?  Maybe.  She goes unwillingly back to her family.  Chuck is clearly uncomfortable in almost all social situations and drives to the desolate west, stopping at a crossroads wondering what direction to take.Tom Hanks is marvelous in his role.

No snappy dialogue, no car chases through San Francisco. No ostensible villains. What kind of decent film is that? An excellent one! I was so wrong not to see this earlier. Tom Hanks is riveting in an Oscar-worthy performance. Hanks is Chuck Nolan, a Type-A Fed Ex manager whose life is run by the minute hand. At one point, he even shouts &quot;Tick Tock! Tick Tock!&quot; at a lethargic Fed-Ex'er. When the Fed Ex plane he's riding on crashes in the Pacific, he gets his toughest assignment ever, forced to discover his real resources. It's fascinating to see what happens to a man who was once defined by the shortness of time, suddenly forced to grapple with more idle time than anyone could want. The ensuing battle of wit and survival held my attention completely (contrary to my expectations). The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the ending seemed a little rushed.The promos, part of the DVD bonus disc, ask, &quot;What happens when everything you are is taken away?&quot; Another take on this movie is that almost all of us will sooner or later be in a situation where we feel that this is indeed the case ... loss of a relationship, job, health, etc. can lead to the encroaching sense of isolation and despair we see Nolan fighting.

534975,AMIOLJHCQHGBE,B00003CXRP,"T. A. Wauldron ""iamtoddicus""","[5, 6]","I watched this film again in anticipation of Hanks in The DaVinci Code. And I was amazed at how much I reacted this movie after 2 years. Unlike others, I don't like to give away the film. Details can sometimes make it so the film doesn't need to be seen. I prefer to express the emotion in this movie.At the time this film was released, everyone compared it to Hanks performance in Forest Gump. And I did also. But now, after watching it again, I see the similarities and the differences.Gump was a series of vignettes. A `slower' person haphazardly thrown into historical situations. Castaway, in a quick capsulation, is the end of a man's life due to being stranded on an uncharted island after a plane crash, the loss of the love of his life, and in the final minutes, realizing he has a whole new life to begin. A life with more possibilties than his previous one.Chuck Noland of FedEx, unknowing leaves his life behind when he boards a a plane. The plane goes down and he survives on an island well out of the shipping lanes and travelled waters. The fact that he survives is a miracle. Hanks is superb in the transformation of personalities that surface. At first, he is the civilized clot who has no idea what to do. Then he realizes the hopelessness of his situation (punctuated by a panaramic view of his tiny island from a summit), and succumbs to this hopelessness of his situation with a suicide attempt. When the attempt fails, he accepts his doom as lost soul. Until he is able to create fire. And then, he assumes the role of a survivor. The key is a Volleyball (whom he dubs Wilson due to it's maker) marked by his own bloodly hand. This connection of blood, creates the alterego Hanks imprints upon Wilson. While it appears he is going insane, this is the key to his surviving, as well as his love for his fiance, played by Helen Hunt. His transformation from dweeb to survivor (the scenes with his impacted tooth are wrenching), are a parellel to real life, telling the viewer to never give up, no matter what the odds.It is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me. The realization of both he and Hunt, that their lives had moved on, was at the least, powerfully emotional.While this film recieved mixed reviews when it came out, it has to be viewed again. In today's atmosphere, with the horrors of the world, this movie is about the individual, and not the world.",4,I forgt how powerful this film really was...,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2396,"['watched', 'film', 'again', 'anticipation', 'Hanks', 'DaVinci', 'Code', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'much', 'reacted', 'movie', '2', 'years', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'give', 'away', 'film', 'Details', 'can', 'sometimes', 'make', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'prefer', 'express', 'emotion', 'movie.At', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'everyone', 'compared', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'did', 'also', 'now', 'watching', 'again', 'see', 'similarities', 'differences.Gump', 'was', 'series', 'vignettes', 'slower', 'person', 'haphazardly', 'thrown', 'historical', 'situations', 'Castaway', 'quick', 'capsulation', 'end', 'man', 'life', 'due', 'being', 'stranded', 'uncharted', 'island', 'plane', 'crash', 'loss', 'love', 'life', 'final', 'minutes', 'realizing', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'begin', 'life', 'more', 'possibilties', 'previous', 'one.Chuck', 'Noland', 'FedEx', 'unknowing', 'life', 'when', 'plane', 'plane', 'down', 'island', 'well', 'shipping', 'lanes', 'travelled', 'waters', 'fact', 'miracle', 'Hanks', 'superb', 'transformation', 'personalities', 'surface', 'first', 'civilized', 'clot', 'who', 'idea', 'what', 'do', 'Then', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'punctuated', 'panaramic', 'view', 'tiny', 'island', 'summit', 'hopelessness', 'situation', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'When', 'attempt', 'doom', 'lost', 'soul', 'able', 'create', 'fire', 'then', 'role', 'survivor', 'key', 'Volleyball', 'whom', 'Wilson', 'due', 'maker', 'marked', 'own', 'bloodly', 'hand', 'connection', 'blood', 'alterego', 'Hanks', 'imprints', 'Wilson', 'going', 'insane', 'key', 'surviving', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'fiance', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'transformation', 'dweeb', 'survivor', 'scenes', 'impacted', 'tooth', 'are', 'wrenching', 'are', 'parellel', 'real', 'life', 'telling', 'viewer', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'matter', 'what', 'odds.It', 'ending', 'rescue', 'truly', 'affected', 'realization', 'Hunt', 'lives', 'had', 'moved', 'was', 'least', 'powerfully', 'film', 'recieved', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'be', 'viewed', 'again', 'today', 'atmosphere', 'horrors', 'world', 'movie', 'individual', 'not', 'world']",N/A

Only Hanks could pull it off: Stranded on a deserted island with nothing but sand, coconuts and FedEx packages to see him through. Only Hanks could shed pound after pound of body fat, and grow inch after inch of beard to look the part.The truth is, this is not a story about being on an island. Rather, it is a case study in reclamation, in finding your niche all over again. Put it this way: We've all come home from long vacations, and then dragged ourselves back to the grind of every day life. It's that sublime emotion that stirs in your gut whenever you see your friends and co-workers for the first time after not having seen them in a while. This feeling of adjustment, of 'coming home' is Cast Away. Hanks portrays it well, and the superb, simplistic direction by Robert Zemekis gives it gravity.In short, whatever you thought you might have heard or read about 'Cast Away,' chuck it out the airplane window...

Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks), a Fed Ex employee must live this after his plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic. The film begins on a crossroad in Texas. The title &quot;Cast Away&quot; and not Castaway appears on the screen which means that Tom Hanks does not only become a Castaway but that he is Cast Away from civilized society. A Fed Ex truck turns the corner and picks up a package from an artists barn that is home to a workshop which creates wings as a form of art(This film is full of symbolism). From here we arrive in Russia in which we discover Noland giving a speech on the importance of time. Life for him revolves around time and it is the perfect job for him because Fed Ex is &quot;The World On Time&quot;. He makes it home and has Christmas dinner with his girlfriend Kelly Frears(Helen Hunt). After dinner he must leave Kelly to return to his job. In the air there is a large storm, the plane loses pressure and crashes into the Atlantic. Chuck opens the life raft and becomes the only survivor of the crash. He lands hours later on a desolate island where he will have to make his home. He eventually adapts to his surroundings by drinking coconut milk and making a fire which will allow him to have hot food. His only friend on the island is a personified soccerball named Wilson. Tom Hanks is the type of actor who's acting can make you care about something as inanimate as a soccer ball. He carries this entire film by being on screen by himself for the majority of the film. The character of Kelly Frears is only on screen for about 15 minutes but you can feel her presence throughout. Starting off, this DVD has a crystal clear picture with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The commentary features insight from Robert Zemekis and many members of his crew. There are barely any quiet moments. The extras are composed of special effects vignettes, multiple documentaries, a storyboard to film comparison, and two theatrical trailers and many T.V. spots.

Get busy living or get busy dying."" That quote sums up CAST AWAY. It is a movie about surviving and making choices.Tom Hanks plays Chuck, a Fed-Ex trouble-shooter who is so constrained by time that he plans dates with his girlfriend months in advance. Chuck get called on an emergency assignment and his plane ends up crashing into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, but is abandoned on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re-education in living.This is a Tom Hanks movie, make no doubt about it. He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it. However, if CAST AWAY was simply a Tom Hanks film and nothing more, it would have sunk faster than the drowning plane in the movie.CAST AWAY is unlike any other film I have ever seen. Most people are sick of their existance in life and go to movies to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film. This is a film that was made to make people think. The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life? What do you most revere? What makes a friend? How strong is love? These are all questions that CAST AWAY forces one to examine.

I found myself from time to time, gripping the sides of my seat.  Especially during the fifteen minute plane crash.  Tom Hanks always picks the best of the best to be in and when his name appears you know that the movie is going to be good.  At first, I didn't think that Hanks could pull off a one man show.  And the trailers to me looked like a remake of Robinson Crusoe.  I find myself completely wrong on both counts. The story is about Hanks, who works for the FedEx company and is called out on Christmas.  After telling the love of his life,&quot;I'll be right back&quot;, he boards the plane.

Hanks moves from fear to frustration to anger to illness to vulnerability to joy to fear again...all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.There are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above-mentioned grief over Wilson the volleyball is one; the tooth-pulling scene is another; his joy over catching a fish...there are just no words to accurately convey how brilliant this film really is.

Now, with the new European packaging of ""steelbook"", this new DVD edition serves as a better investment and sure value-holding collection. The ""steelbook"" design has been introduced on several DVD sets in Germany and other European nations over the last several years. With movies like Ice Age 2 and The Grudge 2 just recently gone Steelbook form overseas, the new inovative packaging trend has just reach the US with the introduction of 9 previously released special edition sets--including the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Cast Away.Although this new packaging DVD set is not released, or at least scheduled to be, at the time I'm writing this review, I do assure you that I do have a copy of the Steelbook edition on hand (along with The Day After Tomorrow Steelbook as well). It is a nicely packaged set that really does bring more value to the collection. It's medal on the outside, with clear plastic on the inside. The bind itself is actually part of the plastic inside the two metal tin-like lids that close the book up, but it is very strong and plenty sturdy enough to balance the weight of the metal lids. This is not like a DVD case inside of a tin packaging that many of us have come to know over the years, but really both ideas placed into one packaging. The discs will surely be far better protected than the snapcases, keepcases, and digipaks that we know best.The Steelbook edition of Cast Away is the same, but now OOP, 2-disc Special Collector's Edition released a couple of years ago by 20th Century Fox. Disc 1 is the exact same as the single released version of the movie (in Widescreen). Disc 2 contains the same bonus features as released before. For those wanting the 2-disc experience, you now have a second chance to grasp onto it (and the other movies) with a more lasting alternative.With this newly packaged beautiful set, I do hope that other movies soon will be released after these nine come out June 5th. So far, these movies seem to be geared more toward the fellas with more action packaged/disasterous themed movies.

535011,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CXRP,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","I went to see ""Cast Away"" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office.Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to ""Dick and Bettina"", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end?Like I said, ""Cast Away"" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it.

During Xmas he decides to work and is shipwrecked. He has to survive and tries to get back home.Why it is good.It is a simple story. A majority of the film features Tom by himself on the island. He can hold the screen with no other actors, just by himself. Chuck's situation is a thought provoker. It makes you envision what you would do in his place  and that life is not fair but you have to ""breath everyday"" and there is a bittersweet ending. There is a sweet message in the movie.Maybe not for everyone.Since Hanks is by himself a large part of the movie, there is not too much action sequence which might bore people.",4,Tom Hanks In Castaway,1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,748,"['enjoyed', 'movie.Over', 'ViewTom', 'Hanks', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'ever', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Chuck', 'who', 'workaholic', 'Xmas', 'work', 'shipwrecked', 'survive', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'home.Why', 'good.It', 'simple', 'story', 'majority', 'film', 'features', 'Tom', 'island', 'can', 'hold', 'screen', 'other', 'actors', 'just', 'Chuck', 'situation', 'thought', 'provoker', 'envision', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'place', 'life', 'not', 'fair', 'have', 'breath', 'everyday', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'sweet', 'message', 'movie.Maybe', 'not', 'everyone.Since', 'Hanks', 'large', 'part', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'sequence', 'might', 'bore', 'people']",N/A

535016,AP3B615GM191G,B00003CXRP,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future.  Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen.  All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it ""slow) plot & character development.What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart.  The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!).  It speaks volumes that, within 90, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away.  It has a little something for everyone.  Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end.  All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth.",5,Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1622,"['1985', 'director', 'Rob', 'Zemeckis', 'created', 'perhaps', 'most', 'genre-diverse', 'film', 'all-time', 'Back', 'Future', 'Fifteen', 'years', 'later', 'came', 'close', 'duplicating', 'extraordinary', 'feat', 'Cast', 'Away', 'incredibly', 'diverse', 'movie', 'own', 'right.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Cast', 'Away', 'story', 'Chuck', 'Noland', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'FedEx', 'worker', 'who', 'down', 'Pacific', 'airplane', 'ashore', 'deserted', 'island', 'must', 'fend', 'harsh', 'terrain', 'conditions.The', 'key', 'film', 'ability', 'combine', 'such', 'genres', 'action', 'adventure', 'disaster', 'comedy', 'drama', 'most', 'importantly', 'make', 'mesh', 'together', 'work', 'big', 'screen', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'nicely', 'form', 'moving', 'exciting', 'always-moving', 'never', 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'consider', 'slow', 'plot', 'character', 'really', 'movie', 'classic', 'however', 'human', 'interest', 'flick', 'heart', 'mental', 'physical', 'struggle', 'Chuck', 'center', 'stage', 'here', 'acting', 'Hanks', 'impeccable', 'usual', 'can', 'play', 'anything', 'volumes', '90', 'may', 'be', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'man', 'relationship', 'volleyball.Overall', 'wish', 'more', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'produced', 'Cast', 'Away', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'many', 'film', 'fans', 'consider', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'be', 'Hanks', 'crowning', 'achievement', 'personally', 'enjoy', 'effort', 'tenfold', 'here', 'multiple', 'themes', 'actually', 'converge', 'form', 'coherent', 'dramatic', 'narrative', 'end', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'multiple', 'times', 'catch', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'character', 'growth']",N/A

535018,A318RKL1I9ABCM,B00003CXRP,"""zaloop""","[2, 3]","Cast Away is definitely one of the most memorable films of the year. It does remarkably well with such an old concept, the stranded-on-an-island premise. But thanks to the direction and Tom Hanks, we frequently forget it is rooted in clich&eacute;.Hanks plays a Federal Express employee who is always keeping track of time to deliver the next package. One day his plane crashes in the sea and he becomes stranded on a deserted island.The middle bulk of the film, I'd guess about one and a half hours long, taking place on the island, is fantastic. This is quite an unconventional film, at least in this part of the movie-- it quietly, methodically, silently shows us how Hanks tries to survive the island. There is no music and no dialogue at all for 20-minute stretches at a time, and the only dialogue that does appear is when Hanks makes friends with a volleyball. It lets us simply watch the battle between Hanks and nature. (What's also appreciated is how the film doesn't use any of the standard desert-island clich&eacute;s that have shown up in film recently: no hostile natives and no drug smugglers.)When talking about the acting here, there's only one person you can mention, because no one else is on screen long enough to make an impression. Hanks' acting is great. And no, I don't mean his physical transformation. That is indeed impressive, but that's not acting- that's fitting the physical requirements for the role. No, I'm talking about his acting: the way he convinces us he's going mad on the island without turning it into a comedic parody of itself, the way he makes us feel sympathy for a beach ball, and the way he becomes so attached to the island that he cries at the thought of leaving it. He has a tough job in this film, to not only act well but support the entire film with his acting alone, and he succeeds wonderfully.As for the bookends of the film, the beginning is fairly standard, setting up the themes we know will be touched upon, but the ending is very effective, sad and realistic. It is during this final part of the film that, as a couple of reviewers have already pointed out, we finally understand the true meaning of the title.All in all, Cast Away is a great film, and a great DVD, too. Two discs of features should give one plenty of extra viewing time. Most notable are the always-appreciated director's commentary, supplied by Robert Zemeckis, and a featurette on Wilson, the volleyball.(PS: Be careful if you happen to see any commercials for this movie, because during its theatrical run some ads gave away the ending.)",4,Great,992217600,"06 11, 2001",2001,2571,"['Cast', 'Away', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'films', 'year', 'remarkably', 'well', 'old', 'concept', 'stranded-on-an-island', 'premise', 'thanks', 'direction', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'frequently', 'forget', 'rooted', 'clich', 'eacute', '.Hanks', 'Federal', 'Express', 'employee', 'who', 'always', 'keeping', 'track', 'time', 'deliver', 'next', 'package', 'One', 'day', 'plane', 'crashes', 'sea', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island.The', 'middle', 'bulk', 'film', ""'d"", 'guess', 'one', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'taking', 'place', 'island', 'fantastic', 'quite', 'unconventional', 'film', 'least', 'part', 'movie', 'quietly', 'methodically', 'silently', 'how', 'Hanks', 'survive', 'island', 'music', 'dialogue', '20-minute', 'stretches', 'time', 'only', 'dialogue', 'appear', 'when', 'Hanks', 'friends', 'volleyball', 'simply', 'watch', 'battle', 'Hanks', 'nature', 'What', 'also', 'appreciated', 'how', 'film', ""n't"", 'use', 'standard', 'desert-island', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'shown', 'up', 'film', 'recently', 'hostile', 'natives', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'When', 'talking', 'acting', 'here', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'can', 'mention', 'one', 'else', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'impression', 'Hanks', 'acting', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'physical', 'transformation', 'indeed', 'impressive', 'not', 'acting-', 'fitting', 'physical', 'requirements', 'role', 'No', ""'m"", 'talking', 'acting', 'way', 'going', 'mad', 'island', 'turning', 'comedic', 'parody', 'way', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'beach', 'ball', 'way', 'so', 'attached', 'island', 'thought', 'leaving', 'tough', 'job', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'act', 'well', 'support', 'entire', 'film', 'acting', 'alone', 'wonderfully.As', 'bookends', 'film', 'beginning', 'fairly', 'standard', 'setting', 'up', 'themes', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'ending', 'very', 'effective', 'sad', 'realistic', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'couple', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'pointed', 'out', 'finally', 'understand', 'true', 'meaning', 'title.All', 'Cast', 'Away', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'DVD', 'too', 'Two', 'discs', 'features', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'plenty', 'extra', 'viewing', 'time', 'Most', 'notable', 'are', 'always-appreciated', 'director', 'commentary', 'supplied', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'featurette', 'Wilson', 'volleyball', 'PS', 'Be', 'careful', 'happen', 'see', 'commercials', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'run', 'ads', 'gave', 'away', 'ending']",N/A
