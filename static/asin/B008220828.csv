1541510,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B008220828,Daddy,"[1, 2]","This movie surprised me... after seeing the cast list and some reviews, I didn't expect to like it so much.  But, Jane Fonda is wonderful in her part as Grace, the spiritual hippie mother, who lives her life as if she's still in the 1960's freedom/rebellion decade.  She wears hippie-style clothes, smokes pot, drives a painted VW bus, and attends every protest. She lives in a small house in a small town, where she has chickens as house pets and makes a lot of arts and crafts.  Her daughter, Diane (Catherine Keener), comes to visit her - at the same time her husband, Mark (Kyle MacLachlan - in very short on-screen appearances), announces he wants a divorce. Diane is a conservative lawyer who is slightly estranged from her mother... they haven't seen each other in 20 years.  She brings her teenage son Jake (Nat Wolff) and daughter Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen), who seem to bond well with their grandmother, and both find romance unexpectedly with two locals.  Eventually, and after meeting an amiable friend of Grace's - Jude (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Diane loosens up, puts aside her conservative outlook on life, and draws closer to her mother - though things get bumpy when Diane finds out her mother had sex with Jude (the new man with whom she's developing a relationship) and when her mother is arrested for having pot.  But, things smooth out again quickly.  Grace seems to have a positive effect on everyone around her. The movie is a lot like that... watching the changes and developments in the characters.  It's a good family drama (aside from minor drug references) with a smattering of wit and humor, it's generally a feel-good movie.",5,Open up your heart and mind,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,1646,"['movie', 'surprised', 'seeing', 'cast', 'list', 'reviews', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'wonderful', 'part', 'Grace', 'spiritual', 'hippie', 'mother', 'who', 'life', 'still', '1960', 'freedom/rebellion', 'decade', 'hippie-style', 'clothes', 'smokes', 'pot', 'painted', 'VW', 'bus', 'protest', 'small', 'house', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'chickens', 'house', 'pets', 'lot', 'arts', 'crafts', 'daughter', 'Diane', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'visit', 'same', 'time', 'husband', 'Mark', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'very', 'short', 'on-screen', 'appearances', 'divorce', 'Diane', 'conservative', 'lawyer', 'who', 'slightly', 'estranged', 'mother', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', '20', 'years', 'teenage', 'son', 'Jake', 'Nat', 'Wolff', 'daughter', 'Zoe', 'Elizabeth', 'Olsen', 'who', 'seem', 'bond', 'well', 'grandmother', 'find', 'romance', 'unexpectedly', 'two', 'locals', 'Eventually', 'meeting', 'amiable', 'friend', 'Grace', 'Jude', 'Jeffrey', 'Dean', 'Morgan', 'Diane', 'up', 'aside', 'conservative', 'outlook', 'life', 'closer', 'mother', 'things', 'get', 'bumpy', 'when', 'Diane', 'out', 'mother', 'had', 'sex', 'Jude', 'new', 'man', 'whom', 'developing', 'relationship', 'when', 'mother', 'arrested', 'having', 'pot', 'things', 'smooth', 'out', 'again', 'quickly', 'Grace', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'everyone', 'movie', 'lot', 'watching', 'changes', 'developments', 'characters', 'good', 'family', 'drama', 'aside', 'minor', 'drug', 'references', 'smattering', 'wit', 'humor', 'generally', 'feel-good', 'movie']",N/A

1541520,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B008220828,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 6]","It does seem a shame to cast three generations of compelling actresses as a dysfunctional family and then let them drown in a sea of tired character clich&eacute;s and pop psychology babble. But that's exactly what happens in director Bruce Beresford's 2012 dramedy, a touchy-feely, throwaway vehicle for Jane Fonda, Catherine Keener, and Elizabeth Olsen (Martha Marcy May Marlene), who all try hard to rise above the broad brushstrokes that mark the superficial script by first-time screenwriters Joseph Muszynski and Christina Mengert. There isn't a single surprise that would make anyone reconsider the trite nature of the cross-generational conflict on display here, and Beresford doesn't help matters by the film's odd pacing where the basic set-up is presented in the first three minutes at which point the principal characters go through the most formulaic transformations in an expeditious manner similar in depth to a Lifetime TV-movie.The story begins as Diane, an uptight Manhattan lawyer, is suddenly informed by her husband that he wants a divorce. Instead of discussing the matter, she packs up her two teenaged children - self-righteous vegan daughter Zoe and aspiring filmmaker son Jake - and visits her mother Grace up in Woodstock even though they haven't spoken in twenty years. Of course, Grace is Diane's exact opposite, a free spirit hippie artist, a political rabble-rouser and a successful pot dealer, so naturally conflict ensues immediately. While the perennially glum Diane glares judgmentally at Grace, both Diane and Zoe, of course, find love with local men who are their polar opposites - Diane with a laid-back carpenter and singer named Jude, Zoe with a sensitive butcher named Cole. In the meantime, Jake annoyingly videotapes life in Woodstock while crushing on a girl who works in a local coffee shop.All the while, grandma Grace espouses spiritually uplifting bromides to everyone about how they need to live their lives to the fullest much like a self-help motivational speaker promoting her latest book. Regardless, it's a pleasure to see the 74-year-old Fonda look fit and loose-limbed as Grace even though I was getting the nagging sense she should be doing a lot more than play this dotty caricature. Playing against type, Keener seems particularly one-note as the mostly dour Diane, and some of her natural looseness as an actress would have helped bring more dimension to the role. Current indie ""it girl"" Olsen shows welcome moments of vulnerability that are severely blunted by Zoe's generally insufferable nature. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (P.S. I Love You) appears to be specializing in idealized rebound love interests, and he plays the emotionally accessible Jude with roguish easy charm.Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl) seems to be playing a younger version of the same male stereotype as Cole inexplicably entranced by Zoe. Nat Wolff (The Naked Brothers Band) provides mostly comic relief as hopelessly nave Jake. I'm not sure why Rosanna Arquette is in the film since she's given next to nothing to do. The cinematography by Andre Fleuren nicely captures the bucolic landscape of upstate New York, but I found the original music by Spencer David Hutchings more intrusive than evocative. For his part, Beresford looks to be resuscitating key moments from Fonda's own film of parental alienation,On Golden Pond, but a better story model would have been Lisa Cholodenko'sThe Kids Are All Rightwhich lent layers of emotional complexity to a family unit challenged by a lack of forgiveness.

But that is what happens when discovering PEACE, LOVE AND MISUNDERSTANDING.  Written by first timers Christina Mengert and Joseph Muszynski who also are the film's producers, and directed with splendid sensitivity for character and detail by Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Breaker Morant, Tender Mercies, Bride of the Wind, Mao's Last Dance, etc), this is a story that so easily could have dropped of the edge of the cliff as a flop but instead becomes a transporting study of family, of coming of age, of second chances, and of fining self in this often absurd world in which we live. The cast, down to the most miniscule bit player, is outstanding: this film is likely to be a career boost for all involved.Uptight obsessive compulsive lawyer Diane (Catherine Keener) lives in New York and at film's opening is told by her husband Mark that he wants a divorce. Diane decides to escape the disorganized trauma of that announcement by taking her two teenagers - geeky video camera addict and virginal Jake (Nat Wolff) and vegan daughter Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen) - to visit Diane's hippy mother Grace (Jane Fonda, in a brilliant performance) whom she hasn't seen for 20 years (Grace sold Marijuana to Diane's friends at Diane's wedding and has never been forgiven): Grace lives in Woodstock, a town that has retained its hippie flavor since the 1960s.  Thinking they will only stay for a couple of days the visiting fractured family ends up staying on while Diane slowly appreciates the strange and wacky but intensely felt life her mother has embraced.  Diane meets Jude (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who slowly breaks down Diane's carefully controlled existence, Zoe is attracted to the local butcher Cole (Chace Crawford, definitely a talent to watch) and despite her loathing of slaughtering animals for food she gradually discovers similarities in the tow of them, and Jake falls for Tara (Marissa O'Donnell) - his first physical experience.  Stir all those ingredients, add some hilarious evening of women howling at the full moon, some surprises in character development, and town full of retro-flowerchild status and the film just soars.One of the many reasons this film works so well is the outstanding performance by the always beautiful and gifted Jane Fonda, but Keener, Morgan, Olsen, Crawford and Wolff are also in top form.  For an American comedy that leaves the viewer feeling on top of the world, this movie has it all.  Grady Harp, June 12",5,`Life is a journey.

1541533,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008220828,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 4]","The likable ""Peace, Love, and Misunderstanding"" seems to have struck a positive chord with many viewers and that's terrific.  It's lightweight and fun enough, and it's always great to see Jane Fonda and Catherine Keener.  Personally, I'm happy to watch Keener in just about anything.  And Fonda, well she's a living legend.  I just wish she would do something in these post-comeback years to really challenge herself, she should easily be competing for roles that would bring her a third Oscar.  That said, though, Bruce Beresford's ""Peace, Love, and Misunderstanding"" doesn't have particularly lofty goals.  Beresford himself is an incredible filmmaker who was Oscar nominated for ""Tender Mercies"" and the fantastic Australian film ""Breaker Morant"" (and notoriously excluded when his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was a prominent contender).  This collection of talent makes ""Peace, Love, and Misunderstanding"" worthy of notice, but that doesn't make it particularly compelling.Keener plays an uptight lawyer (you know the type) who is facing an impending divorce from her husband.  It's of little emotional weight however, more of an initiating plot point than something you can care about.  In fact, Kyle MacLachlin (as the cad) doesn't even share a scene with his two kids until the film's final moments, that's how little he factors into this story.  Keener, in a burst of unusual spontaneity, decides that she and the offspring (a very good Elizabeth Olsen and a winning Nat Wolff) should visit her mother in Woodstock.  Enter Fonda, a new age goddess ripe to expound her wisdom over the less enlightened city-dwellers.  Of course, mother and daughter battle over past slights and differing lifestyles but don't expect complex or cathartic real life to intrude too far.  This is fantasy, pure and simple.  And before it is all over, guess who will fall in love (Hint, hint--choose everyone) and who will embrace a whole new change of heart about communal living.  It's nice, predictable, and not even remotely believable--but perhaps that's the allure.A formula film about estranged families and culture clash archetypes, you know how this film will end within the first few minutes of its set-up.  If offers little in the way of surprises or novelty.  But as I said, maybe this comfort factor is what is attractive to certain viewers.  Difficult problems are solved in an expanded sitcom format.  But Fonda is pleasurable to watch and Keener thaws nicely as she has done in countless other roles.  Chace Crawford and Jeffrey Dean Morgan are on hand as convenient love interests (one meeting is all it ever takes).  Olsen continues to impress, though, taking a stock character and investing her with much vitality and charm.

The entire peace, love, dove thing was fine, although, not so good for women. It's easy to drop out when you know someone's got your back. I'm tired of the stereotype.As for the Grace character - the village police would have busted her growing operation.  The average person could not afford to live in Woodstock.

Fast-forward to 2011 and you'll find no such authenticity running through Peace, Love and Misunderstanding -  Jane's dime-bag drama celebrating the enduring (self) righteousness of the 1960's counter culture and free-floating bohemia.Wasted performances are the casualties of a script that makes a virtue of endless cliche' and bumper sticker bromides extolling the indefatigable grooviness of a period remembered as much today for its soundtrack as its misguided nihilism.Unfortunately, the usually reliable Catherine Keener sleepwalks through her role as Fonda's estranged daughter Diane who has retreated from corporate lawyerdom to her mother's Woodstock compound to nurse her post-divorce wounds. In tow are two grandchildren who either fill their time complaining about bad cell reception or stare in wide-eyed wonder at their stoner grandmother's adopted role as matriarch to a community still enthralled by free love, moist herb and wilderness ""happenings"" where clothing (and screenplay) is clearly optional.Jane's revisionist Woodstock is populated with every progressive trendling now known -  flash mob war protests, free-range animals roaming unaccosted throughout the house and even the lovable local nudist who visits daily for breakfast, presumably to scare up a game of penile ring toss with his Cheerios. Given its Woodstock proximity, Peace, Love wouldn't be complete without endless references to ""Jimi, Janice and Jerry."" Even Rosanna Arquette drops by for a roach clipped cameo.Cringe worthy moments abound, witness Fonda barely containing her graternal pride in the telling that ""Dylan had a thing for her."" Further nausea is summoned when Grace reveals that her daughter was delivered backstage ""at the festival"" just as Hendrix delivered his incendiary version of The Star Spangled Banner. Jesus, did the screenwriters ever take their lips off the pipe long enough to read this mess? Pure nonsense. Throughout this late career bummer, Annoi Jane is so consumed in the pushing of every SDS hot button that she finally becomes the hippie chick parody of herself that even the delightfully dreadful Barbarella (or her most ardent critics) could never make stick. A tragic, self-inflicted outcome for such an accomplished actress.Peace, Love and Misunderstanding is atrocious moviemaking - a banal cartoon masquerading as an important ""message"" film. In its own navel gazing way Peace, Love literally accomplishes the impossible, making Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure play like Cinema Paradiso.

I didn't know anything about it other than its cast consists of 3 of the best actresses of their generation.  As it turns out the film was a bomb at the box office and with the critics.  On a boring afternoon, I was looking for something that I didn't have to think about too much and certainly didn't feel like reading subtitles, so I pulled out this film from the summer of 2012.Directed by Oscar nominee Bruce Beresford (""Tender Mercies""), the film is a by-the-numbers family drama, complete with generational conflict, romance, break-ups, and reconciliation.  Catherine Keener plays Diane, a successful, but uptight, New York attorney whose fed up husband (Kyle MacLachlan) walks out on her.  Neither is upset about it as they stopped loving each other long ago.  Diane decides to go visit her hippy mother, Grace (Jane Fonda) who still resides in Woodstock, N. Y. never having left after the first historic musical event in 1969.  And by the looks of the town, all the residents remain 60 something hippies protesting the war, any war, still dressed in psychedelic clothing.Diane brings her 2 kids with her.  Jake (Nat Wolff) is a mid-teen obsessed with a video camera.  Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen) is a college student who has degree of arrogance about her that almost matches Diane's.  Diane hadn't seen her mother for 20 years due to a falling out years earlier.  Grace is a free spirit, then and now.  She smokes weed, does the organic thing, allows chickens in her house, and sleeps around.  It's what drove Diane away and things haven't change.Eventually everyone loosens up, gets paired up, breaks up and gets back together.  Sound familiar?  Sure.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Marissa O'Donnell and Chace Crawford play the local love interests and yes they all look cute together.  That's exactly what this movie is, cute.  Nothing more, nothing less.The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  It is perfectly fine.  There are no distracting issues in the digitally shot movie.  The audio, likewise, is excellent.  Complete with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, the sounds are where they should be.  The dialog is clear, centered and easily understood.  The extras are minimal.

There are compelling, well-drawn and refreshing character performances by the entire cast.  All of the central characters in this film are attractively good people.Walt Whitman's LEAVES OF GRASS is a central motif throughout this film.This film is portrayed as taking place primarily in Woodstock, New York - a signature location for the hippie era of the 1960s.  Woodstock and the hippie era is a central theme of this film.  Another of this film's delights is this film's visual portrait of the enchanting rural landscape.This film contains a lot of humor and compelling wisdom, about a variety of personal relationships, about personal fulfillment and sexual pleasure.Hippie ""grandma"" Jane Fonda is a scream in acting as Cupid, by intuitively finding exactly the right partner not only for her emotionally exasperating daughter (played by  Catherine Keener), but also for her daughter's two adolescent children, and in ensuring that each of these potential partners successfully connects with each other.The film contains one compelling episode in which the actress Catherine Keener joins a male to sing a duet on a stage at an outdoor music festival, in a powerfully sensual performance - particularly because this sensual performance seems out of character for Catherine Keener's film character - even her children are astonished.  If Catherine Keener's seemingly frigid film character, whose film husband has just filed for divorce, has that type of ""music"" in her, she still has ""music"" in her for other future activities.The dialogue in this film is very high-caliber, and is a central attribute.",5,Harmonies: American Poetry,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",2012,1719,"['extremely', 'well-cast', 'film', 'one', 'have', 'become', 'captivated', 'immersed', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'compelling', 'well-drawn', 'refreshing', 'character', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'central', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'attractively', 'good', 'people.Walt', 'Whitman', 'LEAVES', 'OF', 'GRASS', 'central', 'motif', 'film.This', 'film', 'portrayed', 'taking', 'place', 'primarily', 'Woodstock', 'New', 'York', 'signature', 'location', 'hippie', 'era', '1960s', 'Woodstock', 'hippie', 'era', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'film', 'delights', 'film', 'visual', 'portrait', 'enchanting', 'rural', 'landscape.This', 'film', 'lot', 'humor', 'compelling', 'wisdom', 'variety', 'personal', 'relationships', 'personal', 'fulfillment', 'sexual', 'pleasure.Hippie', 'grandma', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'scream', 'acting', 'Cupid', 'intuitively', 'finding', 'exactly', 'right', 'partner', 'not', 'only', 'emotionally', 'exasperating', 'daughter', 'played', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'also', 'daughter', 'two', 'adolescent', 'children', 'ensuring', 'potential', 'partners', 'successfully', 'connects', 'other.The', 'film', 'one', 'compelling', 'episode', 'actress', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'male', 'sing', 'duet', 'stage', 'outdoor', 'music', 'festival', 'powerfully', 'sensual', 'performance', 'particularly', 'sensual', 'performance', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'film', 'character', 'even', 'children', 'are', 'astonished', 'Catherine', 'Keener', 'seemingly', 'frigid', 'film', 'character', 'film', 'husband', 'just', 'filed', 'divorce', 'type', 'music', 'still', 'music', 'other', 'future', 'activities.The', 'dialogue', 'film', 'very', 'high-caliber', 'central', 'attribute']",N/A

By doing so, even with a polar opposite, you have to look inside and find the reason you were fighting the connection, then let go of the fight so you can connect and cherish each other.

""Peace, Love, and Misunderstanding"" is a fun movie with equal parts drama and humor, and made for an engaging viewing experience. I happen to be partial to films dealing with dysfunctional families, and Jane Fonda positively shines in this tailor-made role as Grace, the free-spirited, activist mother of uptight, soon-to-be divorced lawyer mom-of-two, Diane (Catherine Keener). When Diane's husband, Mark (Kyle McLachlan) asks for a divorce, Diane packs up her two teen children, daughter Zoe (Elizabeth Olsen), and son Jake (Nat Wolff) to visit her estranged mom at Woodstock, yes, the very same iconic place. Once they arrive, the old resentments harbored by Diane flare up, making it difficult for her to reconnect with her mom, so grandma Grace focuses on the grandkids, her open and loving gestures warmly embraced by them.Soon, the vacation or escape, whichever way one chooses to view it, turns out to be quite eventful. Zoe is attracted to butcher Cole (Chase Crawford) despite finding his occupation and cigarette-smoking repulsive, Jake finds a soulmate in a young teen that thinks like him, and even Diane, for all her stiff upper lip and reservations, finds herself liking singer-carpenter, Jude (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Presiding over this is matriarch Grace, who grows pot in her basement, hits it up with her grandkids, and engages in casual love affairs, perfectly oblivious, or rather choosing to be oblivious to her daughter's glaring disapproval. Ultimately, family secrets are revealed, and everyone experiences some kind of epiphany. Though the plot was a little too predictable for my liking, it was still fun and and the writing is witty and fun. The ensemble cast delivers a credible performance, full of heart and promise, and elevates this above other humdrum flicks with similar themes.
