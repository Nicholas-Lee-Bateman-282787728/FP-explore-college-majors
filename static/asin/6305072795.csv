Venus Wars tells the story of a group of  motorized uni-cycle racers (believe me, these uni-cycles aren't your  typical uni-cycles) that get involved in the war between two factions  fighting for control of Venus.  The film deals with hope and the tragedy of  war as seen from both the folks not directly involved in the fighting, and  from a soldier's perspective.  The animation is refreshing and very crisp,  and it sounds as if some real thought went into the music as well.  The  added extras are a joke, but I bought this disc for the film, not for any  sort of flashy extras.  If you're a fan of old-school anime, then Venus  Wars definitely belongs in your DVD collection.",5,Not Your Typical Anime,969148800,"09 17, 2000",2000,781,"['Venus', 'Wars', 'resemblance', 'dogmeat', 'Japan', 'turning', 'out', 'terms', 'anime', 'lately', 'Venus', 'Wars', 'story', 'group', 'motorized', 'uni-cycle', 'racers', 'believe', 'uni-cycles', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'uni-cycles', 'get', 'involved', 'war', 'two', 'factions', 'fighting', 'control', 'Venus', 'film', 'deals', 'hope', 'tragedy', 'war', 'seen', 'folks', 'not', 'directly', 'involved', 'fighting', 'soldier', 'perspective', 'animation', 'refreshing', 'very', 'crisp', 'real', 'thought', 'went', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'added', 'extras', 'are', 'joke', 'bought', 'disc', 'film', 'not', 'sort', 'flashy', 'extras', ""'re"", 'fan', 'old-school', 'anime', 'then', 'Venus', 'Wars', 'definitely', 'DVD', 'collection']",Venus Wars

So, I am expecting some sort of id-ego-superego (or what the other one called?) kinda model used in many American movies. like... One character represents the ego, another represents the id and the other represents the superego. However, this is not the case.  Character development is very little. The boy is a kid and then half an hour later, he is a man... with little development at all.  It is like they cut away a big piece of the cartoon right in the middle.  And I think this is what this cartoon is all about: from boy to man and becomes a hero.  The story does not focus much on the other characters either.On the other hand, the animation is very good. It is one of the best looking cartoon I have seen.So, to sum it up, if you look at this as an epic movie, it is a bad epic movie with a little bit of action.

446046,AGR4LKC72JEQ8,6305072795,coopertex,"[6, 9]","takes place in the far future, where humans have already colonized several planets including the planet, Venus. People lived in peace for many years until the humans meet up with an alien race (which look and act human), trying to dominate the universe. The humans were no match alien's weaponry and technology. They weren't even able to make a dent on their battle tanks. The Human alliance did not know how to penetrate the armor of the monstrous tanks the aliens used. The aliens eventually conquered every colony on Venus and became the new world government. The people of Venus were oppressed by the alien's tyranny until a small group of rebels started to fight back and win. Venus wars can be compared to  World War II and how the Germans, tried to dominate the world. Especially the analogy of the tyranny of the aliens and their battle tanks with thick armor which the allies had trouble penetrating. Good story telling with a science fiction twist, and the characters where well developed. Venus Wars feels like an epic movie, but without have the epic length of one (which is a good thing). My only complaint with this movie is that it seems like it was supposed to continue, but a sequel was never made! Silky animation, minor blood and gore.

It's rare for me to go back and see an anime film I only slightly enjoyed, but I found some time and decided to watch this film again so that I could write a review on it. Unfortunately (or fortunately, however you want to look at it) I guess my standards for anime, and film in general, are higher now then they were when I first watched this film. It was fun back then, now its just wasted potential.In the year 2079 Venus is an inhabitable planet and home to thousands of people who scratch off a living off the barren soil of their home world. Although it was supposed to be a paradise, free from the wars and violence which have plagued earth for thousands of years, Venus has taken to looking more like a post apocalyptic earth than the green paradise the people envisioned with they first settled the planet. Plants don't grow, corrupt governments rule the land, and war looms ahead for the entire planet. For amusement the citizens of the city of Io, capital of the nation of Ufrodia, preoccupy themselves with dangerous X game like sports involving mono bikes, which are BTW really, really cool.Sound cool? Well it very well could have been EXTREMELY cool, but ruins all potential it has with an inane script which will make even the most tolerant of anime fans blush with embarrassment. There is simply no describing how awful it is on a consistent basis. Every line, every sentence, every word from either the sub or the dub, is just pathetic. Who wrote this junk? My ten year old little brother has more talent then the writers of this movie. Along with the bad writing, the characters are also pretty badly portrayed, although that could also be attributed to the script. The reluctant hero rebelling against authority, the naive blonde (I don't care how hot she it, she's just too stupid to believe), the feisty red head, the tough/wise mechanic, and all the numerous stupid bikers and overly confident military guys make up the bulk of the clich&eacute; character types to be found here.However, this movie has one saving grace which brings it out of the bowls of obscurity and makes it something half way decent, or at least watch able; it has action, good action, and lots of it. If you can put aside the bad writing and horrendous characters (something I'm sure many of you will have no problem in doing) Venus Wars is about two hours of stuff blowing up, people getting shot, and really awesome military hardware destroying everything in sight. It's a riot, there's no mistaking it. From the moment Ishtar invades with their superior weapons and overwhelms the defenders, reminiscent of Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, until the end the action rarely lets up. The obvious WWII parodies are also there for military history buffs who like seeing old wars fought with new weapons. Venus Wars is WWII; WWII with mono bikes. Cool.Unfortunately this movies age really shows in the animation. Although the battle scenes are pretty good overall, backgrounds and motion shots are blurry, which could just be the DVD, either way it hurts the eyes. The music was done by the amazing Joe Hisaishi, composer for such amazing scores as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.  The music has its moments here and there, but there isn't anywhere close to enough to justify the bold printing on the cover which says ""Features music by Jo Hisaishi, composer for Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro."" The music isn't anywhere near special and is kept as silent as possible for the most part.Is this a film worth watching? Probability, for those who could care less for character development and realism. Is it worth owning though? I don't think so. Rent this one if you can, otherwise let it go.Replay Value; low.",3,A shame to waste such a good idea,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",2008,3764,"['think', 'one', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'rare', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'anime', 'film', 'only', 'slightly', 'enjoyed', 'found', 'time', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'could', 'write', 'review', 'Unfortunately', 'fortunately', 'however', 'want', 'look', 'guess', 'standards', 'anime', 'film', 'general', 'are', 'higher', 'now', 'then', 'were', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'back', 'then', 'now', 'just', 'wasted', 'potential.In', 'year', '2079', 'Venus', 'inhabitable', 'planet', 'home', 'thousands', 'people', 'who', 'scratch', 'living', 'off', 'barren', 'soil', 'home', 'world', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'paradise', 'free', 'wars', 'violence', 'have', 'plagued', 'earth', 'thousands', 'years', 'Venus', 'taken', 'looking', 'more', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'earth', 'green', 'paradise', 'people', 'envisioned', 'first', 'settled', 'planet', 'Plants', 'do', ""n't"", 'grow', 'corrupt', 'governments', 'rule', 'land', 'war', 'looms', 'ahead', 'entire', 'planet', 'amusement', 'citizens', 'city', 'Io', 'capital', 'nation', 'Ufrodia', 'dangerous', 'X', 'game', 'sports', 'involving', 'mono', 'bikes', 'are', 'BTW', 'really', 'really', 'cool.Sound', 'cool', 'Well', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'EXTREMELY', 'cool', 'potential', 'inane', 'script', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'tolerant', 'anime', 'fans', 'blush', 'embarrassment', 'simply', 'describing', 'how', 'awful', 'consistent', 'basis', 'line', 'sentence', 'word', 'sub', 'dub', 'just', 'pathetic', 'Who', 'wrote', 'junk', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'little', 'brother', 'more', 'talent', 'then', 'writers', 'movie', 'bad', 'writing', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'badly', 'portrayed', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'attributed', 'script', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'rebelling', 'authority', 'naive', 'blonde', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'hot', 'just', 'too', 'stupid', 'believe', 'feisty', 'red', 'head', 'tough/wise', 'mechanic', 'numerous', 'stupid', 'bikers', 'overly', 'confident', 'military', 'guys', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'clich', 'eacute', 'character', 'types', 'be', 'found', 'here.However', 'movie', 'one', 'saving', 'grace', 'bowls', 'obscurity', 'something', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'least', 'watch', 'able', 'action', 'good', 'action', 'lots', 'can', 'put', 'aside', 'bad', 'writing', 'horrendous', 'characters', 'something', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'doing', 'Venus', 'Wars', 'two', 'hours', 'stuff', 'blowing', 'up', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'really', 'awesome', 'military', 'hardware', 'destroying', 'everything', 'sight', 'riot', 'mistaking', 'moment', 'Ishtar', 'invades', 'superior', 'weapons', 'overwhelms', 'defenders', 'reminiscent', 'Germany', 'invasion', 'Poland', '1939', 'end', 'action', 'rarely', 'up', 'obvious', 'WWII', 'parodies', 'are', 'also', 'there', 'military', 'history', 'buffs', 'who', 'seeing', 'old', 'wars', 'fought', 'new', 'weapons', 'Venus', 'Wars', 'WWII', 'WWII', 'mono', 'bikes', 'Cool.Unfortunately', 'movies', 'age', 'really', 'animation', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'backgrounds', 'motion', 'shots', 'are', 'blurry', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'DVD', 'way', 'eyes', 'music', 'was', 'done', 'amazing', 'Joe', 'Hisaishi', 'composer', 'such', 'amazing', 'scores', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'music', 'moments', 'here', 'there', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'close', 'enough', 'justify', 'bold', 'printing', 'cover', 'Features', 'music', 'Jo', 'Hisaishi', 'composer', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'music', ""n't"", 'anywhere', 'special', 'kept', 'as', 'silent', 'possible', 'most', 'part.Is', 'film', 'watching', 'Probability', 'who', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'character', 'development', 'realism', 'worth', 'owning', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Rent', 'one', 'can', 'otherwise', 'let', 'go.Replay', 'Value', 'low']",Venus Wars

You go back to the anime/manga back then, it had more of the violence and grit you would crave for. It had less of that feeling where it's quickly hashed out, or obviously influenced and tailored to the American viewers.The only gripes is the views of back then, such as sexism against women (who usually play the extreme princess who can't fight), and music from that time (this is selective to some). Hiro isn't the usual gundam main character: why're we fighting? oh well, i'll fight to protect. Hiro is more of what you'd expect, a hotheaded teenager. Another, thing is that action sci-fi in general, is great at retelling lessons completely based on reality. This is no exception. Venus Wars resembles a lot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (it only took a couple days to gain a surrender). The monobikes w/ railguns, chase scene, liberation, etc. Its all there. The rousing action, where the whole city gets pissed off and overthrows their occupiers!After growing up on handpainted cels, you just don't feel the love and dedicated work presented in modern anime, which uses computer. It feels so impersonal and for the money. Don't get me wrong anime is great, no matter what era its from. Its just that, it's no longer as conceptual art in motion, you no longer see any of the stages, its too clean and straight lined that its like standing in a decontaminated room.
