I had no idea The Wiggles, a mermaid and 4 adult dancers would be the only people on this DVD though. The landscape is very pretty and the songs are good, so I am still giving it a high rating, besides my 3-year-old seems to love it as much as all the others.There is a story to this video. The Wiggles find a sea shell and give it to Dorothy and it directs Dorothy to find the golden key. They do a search on the island and find it and give it to the mermaid and Captain Feathersword who take it out to see to find King Neptune. Mostly there is the songs and dancing, but in-between there are a few story lines of this nature making the video more interesting to watch then the standard format.

Mcginty ""mcdisney2001""","[12, 12]","We preordered this on DVD last month, for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and from the second we turned it on she sat as if in a trance!  Once again, the Wiggles have figured out what kids like, and they deliver.This DVD follows their success with &quot;Wiggly Safari&quot;, and once again uses the outdoor format.  It has more of a story/plot than their past videos, requiring more dialogue in between songs, which I was afraid would bore or distract my toddler, but she never even blinked once the entire time they were talking-The Wiggles can do no wrong!  The story follows The Wiggles, Captain Feathersword, Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog, and Henry the Octopus, as they visit a deserted island for the afternoon, only to become stranded when Captain Feathersword forgets to tie up the boat.  Of course, they manage to get the boat back before long, but not before finding a magic seashell, meeting a mermaid, and lots of singing and dancing.  They're joined by 4 adult dancers, who spice things up with their antics.  Two of the dancers are from &quot;Wiggly Safari&quot;, as is Naomi Wallace, who trades in her dancing shoes for fins to play Magdalena the Mermaid.The songs are charming, catchy, and original, as always.  Every time I hear a new Wiggles song, I think &quot;Hmm, not the greatest&quot;, but after hearing it two or three more times I always find that I know all of the words, and catch myself humming it in the shower or the car!  Several have a sort of retro/beach music sound to them, such as the 60's surf rock and Beach Boys tunes.I absolutely recommend this DVD to all Wiggles fans.  Although the look and feel are much different from the TV show, which uses interior sets and digital backgrounds, your little ones will fall in love with this from the moment you turn it on.
